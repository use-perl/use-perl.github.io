<p>I've created some "Beta-test" MSI installers for Strawberry Perl - they're available at <a href="http://csjewell.comyr.com/perl/strawberryperlbeta.html">http://csjewell.comyr.com/perl/strawberryperlbeta.html</a> for you to test out, hammer on, etc.<p>If more people do this than just me, July's Strawberry Perl will hopefully be just great!</p><p>For production Perl programming environments, you'll still probably want to go to <a href="http://strawberryperl.com/">http://strawberryperl.com/</a> (or to ActiveState, if that works for you) to get your Perl fix on Windows.</p><p>Otherwise, let me know of any problems you have!</p></p>

<p>Hi Folks</p><p>And I couldn't get WinXFP to open strawberry-perl-5.10.0.6-beta-1.msi<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-(.</p><p>But I am thinking a Windows MSI package might be a good idea<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-(.</p><p>Ron</p>

<p>My personal site can sometimes be painful when downloading large files, but it is free, so I think I'm getting what I pay for in that regard.
(Maybe I should put file sizes and checksums up.)</p><p>You may need to use wget or something of the like.</p><p>I'll check that they work (and got uploaded correctly) tomorrow.</p>

<p>Hi Folks</p><p>First time I downloaded it thru my ISP.</p><p>Just tried again via deakin.edu.au.</p><p>Same result. Curious.</p>

<p>Hi Folks</p><p>Yes, I realize adding h: to the list of supported drives is getting a bit ridiculous if they are all separate distros.</p><p>It's just that at educational institutions, every student is given a personal folder on h:.</p><p>Of course, the flash-drive option more or less solves that problem.</p><p>Cheers<br>Ron</p>

<p>Given that we only have a hundred or so downloads a quarter for the D: version, H: would seem to be pushing things a bit<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p><p>Alternatively, if you install Perl::Dist::Strawberry with a little bit of work you could probably spin your own distribution.</p>

<p>And something I admit I'd like to see is a relocatable build where you can choose where the installation goes - but that may not come until <b>late</b> 2009.</p><p>Trying to think of how I can implement that.</p>

<p>At the moment, there's only two ways.</p><p>1. Hardcode the path in at some fixed but easily detectable path, and do a string-replacement to tailor it to your system during the install process.</p><p>2. Tweak Strawberry Portable slightly so it uses all the normal Portable magic for most files, but uses the system paths for File::HomeDir (which currently is magicified to point into the Portable directory).</p>

<h2>Re:And now for H:</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Alias/">Alias</a> on 2009-05-20T09:24:54</h3>
<p>And I should add, whichever of those two you do, go through the entire Perl and GCC toolchain and most of the top 100 CPAN modules to make sure they work with spaces in the path.</p>



<h2>Re:And now for H:</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/DiamondInTheRough/">DiamondInTheRough</a> on 2009-05-20T16:19:40</h3>
<p>And I'm thinking that if perl.exe is not one of the files that would need patched, (i.e. trying to expand the space a string is stored in a binary) #1 would be the better option.  Otherwise, #2.  Maybe I'd do #1 if perl.exe needs patched if we were only changing the <i>drive</i>, as opposed to both the drive and directory.</p><p>The reason being it's easy enough to write a CA that does #1 in C++. (after writing the clear-files CA, I've got an idea of how to do it. Maybe use the pcre library? would have to check.)</p><p>I think the first iteration would not allow spaces, anyway, because I understand it'd be a problem with mingw, not just perl.</p>

Well, Beta 2 is now up at the same location.
