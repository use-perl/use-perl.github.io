<p>jesse writes <i>""Say  I'm going in a swimming, I am. Don't you wish you could? But of<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; course you'd druther work  wouldn't you? Course you would!"<br> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Tom contemplated the boy a bit, and said: "What do you call work?"<br> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; "Why ain't that work?"<br> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Tom resumed his whitewashing, and answered carelessly: "Well, maybe it<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; is, and maybe it aint. All I know, is, it suits Tom Sawyer."<br> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; "Oh come, now, you don't mean to let on that you like it?"<br> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The brush continued to move. "Like it? Well I don't see why I oughtn't<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; to like it. Does a boy get a chance to whitewash a fence every day?"<br> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That put the thing in a new light. Ben stopped nibbling his apple. Tom<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; swept his brush daintily back and forth  stepped back to note the effect<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;  added a touch here and there-criticised the effect again  Ben<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; watching every move and getting more and more interested, more and more<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; absorbed. Presently he said: "Say, Tom, let me whitewash a little."<br> <br>

You can find a list of high-profile changes<br>in this release in the file "perl5113delta.pod" inside the distribution.<br> <br>Perl 5.11.3 is, hopefully, the last release of Perl 5.11.x before<br>code freeze for Perl 5.12.0. At that point, we will only make changes<br>which fix regressions from previous released versions of Perl or which<br>resolve issues we believe would make a stable release of Perl 5.12.0<br>inadvisable.<br> <br>You can (or will shortly be able to) download the 5.11.3 release from:<br> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/jesse/perl-5.11.3/">http://search.cpan.org/user/jesse/perl-5.11.3/</a> <br> <br>The release's SHA1 signatures are:<br> <br>MD5:  0051020f8ae2a89c9d624e01ed56b02c          perl-5.11.3.tar.bz2<br>SHA1: 7fe87005437002f0b515d983429d0bfba36398ac  perl-5.11.3.tar.bz2<br> <br>This release corresponds to commit 9c3f2640bc in Perl's git repository.<br>It is tagged as 'v5.11.3'.<br> <br>We welcome your feedback on this release. If you discover issues<br>with Perl 5.11.3, please use the 'perlbug' tool included in this<br>distribution to report them. If Perl 5.11.3 works well for you, please<br>use the 'perlthanks' tool included with this distribution to tell the<br>all-volunteer development team how much you appreciate their work.<br> <br>If you write software in Perl, it is particularly important that you test<br>your software against development releases. While we strive to maintain<br>source compatibility with prior stable versions of Perl wherever possible,<br>it is always possible that a well-intentioned change can have unexpected<br>consequences. If you spot a change in a development version which breaks<br>your code, it's much more likely that we will be able to fix it before the<br>next stable release. If you only test your code against stable releases<br>of Perl, it may not be possible to undo a backwards-incompatible change<br>which breaks your code.<br> <br>Perl 5.11.3 represents approximately one month of development since<br>Perl 5.11.2 and contains 61407 lines of changes across 396 files<br>from 40 authors and committers:<br> <br>Abigail, Alex Davies, Alexandr Ciornii, Andrew Rodland, Andy<br>Dougherty, Bram, brian d foy, Chip Salzenberg, Chris Williams, Craig<br>A. Berry, Daniel Frederick Crisman, David Golden, Dennis Kaarsemaker,<br>Eric Brine, Father Chrysostomos, Gene Sullivan, Gerard Goossen, H.<br>Merijn Brand, Hugo van der Sanden, Jan Dubois, Jerry D. Hedden,<br>Jesse Vincent, Jim Cromie, Karl Williamson, Leon Brocard, Max<br>Maischein, Michael Breen, Moritz Lenz, Nicholas Clark, Rafael<br>Garcia-Suarez, Reini Urban, Ricardo Signes, Stepan Kasal, Steve<br>Hay, Steve Peters, Tim Bunce, Tony Cook, Vincent Pit and Zefram.<br> <br>Many of the changes included in this version originated in the CPAN<br>modules included in Perl's core. We're grateful to the entire CPAN<br>community for helping Perl to flourish.<br> <br>Notable changes in this release:<br> <br>* Perl is shipped with Unicode version 5.2, itself released in  October<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 2009.<br> <br>* Perl can now handle every Unicode character property.<br> <br>* The experimental 'legacy' pragma, introduced with Perl 5.11.2 has been<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; removed. Its functionality has been replaced with the 'feature' pragma.<br> <br>* Numerous CPAN "toolchain" modules have been updated to what we hope<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; are the final release versions for Perl 5.12.0.<br> <br>* Many crashing bugs or regressions from earlier releases of Perl were fixed<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; for this release.<br> <br>Development versions of Perl are released monthly on or about the 20th<br>of the month by a monthly "release manager". You can expect following<br>upcoming releases:<br> <br>
&nbsp; January 20  Ricardo Signes<br>
&nbsp; February 20  Steve Hay<br>
&nbsp; March 20  Ask Bj&#248;rn Hansen"</i></p>
