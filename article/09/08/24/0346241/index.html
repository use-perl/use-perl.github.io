<p>kyle writes <i>"On behalf of the Rakudo development team, I'm pleased to announce<br>the August 2009 development release of Rakudo Perl #20 "PDX".<br>Rakudo is an implementation of Perl 6 on the Parrot Virtual Machine [1].<br>The tarball for the August 2009 release is available from<br> <a href="http://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/downloads">http://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/downloads</a> .<br> <br>Due to the continued rapid pace of Rakudo development and the<br>frequent addition of new Perl 6 features and bugfixes, we continue<br>to recommend that people wanting to use or work with Rakudo obtain<br>the latest source directly from the main repository at github.<br>More details are available at <a href="http://rakudo.org/how-to-get-rakudo">http://rakudo.org/how-to-get-rakudo</a> .<br> <br>Rakudo Perl follows a monthly release cycle, with each release code named<br>after a Perl Mongers group. August 2009 is code named "PDX" for the<br>Portland Perl Mongers. PDX.pm has been home to several Rakudo<br>contributors (chromatic, Allison Randal, and more) and PDX.pm has<br>held meetings that have produced feature and bugfix patches for Rakudo.<br> <br>Beginning with this release, Rakudo Perl builds from an "installed<br>Parrot" instead of using Parrot's build tree. This release of Rakudo<br>requires Parrot 1.5.0. For the latest information on building and<br>using Rakudo Perl, see the README file section titled "Building and<br>invoking Rakudo". (Quick note: the "--gen-parrot" option still<br>automatically downloads and builds Parrot as before, if you prefer<br>that approach.)<br> <br>Also, unlike previous versions of Rakudo Perl, the "perl6"<br>(or "perl6.exe") executables only work when invoked from the<br>Rakudo root directory until a "make install" is performed.<br>Running "make install" will install Rakudo and its libraries<br>into the Parrot installation that was used to build it, and then<br>the executables will work when invoked from any directory.<br> <br>Some of the specific major changes and improvements occuring<br>with this release include:<br> <br>* Rakudo is now passing 12,369 spectests, an increase of 493<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; passing tests since the July 2009 release. With this release<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Rakudo is now passing 69.98% of the available spectest suite.<br> <br>* We now have a much cleaner traits implementation. Many of the<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Perl 6 built-in traits are now implemented in Perl 6, and<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; user-defined traits can now be defined and applied to classes<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; and roles.<br> <br>* The 'hides' trait on classes can make one class hide another.<br> <br>* Many not-yet-implemented operators and features now provide<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; more helpful error messages instead of simply producing<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; parse errors.<br> <br>* The ROADMAP has been substantially updated and includes some<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; details regarding the "Rakudo Star" release [2].<br> <br>* Embedded comments now require backticks (Perl 6 specification change).<br> <br>Since the Perl 6 specification is still in flux, some deprecated features<br>will be removed from Rakudo. Prominently among those are:<br> <br>
&nbsp; * '=$handle' is deprecated in favor of '$handle.get' (one line)<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and '$handle.lines' (all lines).<br> <br>
&nbsp; * 'int $obj' is deprecated in favor of '$obj.Int'.<br> <br>The development team thanks all of our contributors and sponsors for<br>making Rakudo Perl possible. If you would like to contribute,<br>see <a href="http://rakudo.org/how-to-help">http://rakudo.org/how-to-help</a> , ask on the perl6-compiler@perl.org<br>mailing list, or ask on IRC #perl6 on freenode.<br> <br>The next release of Rakudo (#21) is scheduled for September 17, 2009.<br>A list of the other planned release dates and codenames for 2009 is<br>available in the "docs/release_guide.pod" file. In general, Rakudo<br>development releases are scheduled to occur two days after each<br>Parrot monthly release. Parrot releases the third Tuesday of each month.<br> <br>Have fun!<br> <br>References:<br>[1] Parrot, <a href="http://parrot.org/">http://parrot.org/</a> <br>[2] Rakudo Star, <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/pmichaud/journal/39411">http://use.perl.org/user/pmichaud/journal/39411</a> <br>

<h2>Installable!</h2>

<blockquote><div><p> <i>Running "make install" will install Rakudo and its libraries
into the Parrot installation that was used to build it, and then
the executables will work when invoked from any directory.</i></p></div> </blockquote><p>
So this means that (a) it can be installed as a package and (b) real live scripts in random directories can use it? Yay! This has been holding me back from playing with it.</p>



<h2>Windows or Cygwin?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/furry_marmot/">furry_marmot</a> on 2009-08-25T04:20:54</h3>
<p>Can it be installed under Windows at this point? If not, how about under Cygwin?</p>

<p>Certainly I've tested it on WinXP + MS VC++ and it seems to work fine. The release didn't quite work on MinGW if you wanted to compile with ICU, but we've had a patch submitted/applied to fix that since. Cygwin, I'm afraid I'm not sure about.</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Jonathan</p>

<p>I apologize. I should have been more specific, though I just visited the "How to get Rakudo Perl 6" and got an answer to my question.</p><p>I (like most Windows users) don't have a C compiler and have never been a C/C++/C# developer. I was a Perl/DB/Network developer for a long time and, since moving out of development, have continued using Perl to create tools and systems to help me in my work, which requires Windows. Oh well.</p>

<p>Ah, I see. fperrad++ does produce binary builds of each Parrot release and the Rakudo development release that matches up with it. You can find the Parrot build and the Rakudo add-on (two downloads, Parrot-1.5.0 and Parrot-1.5.0-Rakudo-20) at:</p><p>http://sourceforge.net/projects/parrotwin32/files/</p><p>Hope this helps,</p><p>Jonathan</p>

Oh cool! I had looked around, but missed that.<p>
