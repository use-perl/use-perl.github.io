<h1>$9.99 Learning Perl and Mastering Perl e-books from O'Reilly</h1>

<div class="span8">
<p><p>O'Reilly dropped the regular price of e-books for <a href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596520106/">Learning Perl</a> and <a href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596527242/">Mastering Perl</a> to $9.99. I volunteered to be the guinea pig for pricing experiments. I specifically want to see if this makes it easier to get these books when access to the hard-copies is prohibitively expensive. You can get these books in Mobi, PDF, or ePub directly from O'Reilly. I'd like to do more of these sorts of experiments to get the books into as many hands as possible.
</p><p>
The $9.99 price is the regular price, so all existing discount and coupon codes apply. For instance, you can still use the 35% user group discount to get either book for $6.50.
</p><p>
These are the updated versions of the books too. All reported errata should be corrected, so they are slightly fresher than the hard copies.
</p><p>
Remember, the great thing about PDFs is that they don't take up any shelf space. Buy as many as you like!

<p>Why not the "intermediate" as well?</p>

<p>It's an experiment right now. If it works out, there might be other books added to the list.</p>

<p>I will get them both and hope the intermediate one comes out as well.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>

<p>As a support of affordable ebooks I've made a purchase.</p><p>I'm the kind of freak that likes a dead tree version along with an ebook (preferrably pdf).</p><p>Much easier to carry all my perl book on my usb sticks.</p>

<h3><a href="/user/sigzero/">sigzero</a> on 2009-08-25T15:54:17</h3>
<p>Exactly...and for "learning" books...I can print out a chapter at a time and make annotations. I somehow cringe in writing in a book.</p>

<h2>Discount code</h2>

Hi - I'm interested in both these book - could you remind me of the group discount code please.
Thanks.
Chris

Thanks for the link and the code!!! It worked great for me today!



<h2>Thanks!</h2>

I bought both books.  With the discount, how could I not?  Thanks for the info!



<h2>Great Value</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/meljr/">meljr</a> on 2009-09-04T16:05:51</h3>
Thanks for the posting.  I ended up buying both books.  By the way, I just happened to be reading the 5th edition on Safari as I am considering using Perl instead of PHP for my next project.
