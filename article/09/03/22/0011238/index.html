<p>On behalf of the Rakudo development team, I'm pleased to announce
the March 2009 development release of Rakudo Perl #15 "Oslo".
Rakudo is an implementation of Perl 6 on the Parrot Virtual Machine [1].
The tarball for the March 2009 release is available from <a href="http://www.pmichaud.com/perl6/rakudo-2009-03.tar.gz">http://www.pmichaud.com/perl6/rakudo-2009-03.tar.gz</a> <p>However, because of the rapid pace of Rakudo development and addition
of new features, we still recommend that people wanting to use or work
with Rakudo obtain the latest version directly from the main repository
at github -- more on this in a bit.
</p><p>Rakudo Perl follows a monthly release cycle, with each release code named
after a Perl Mongers group.  This release is named "Oslo" in honor of
the organizers of the <a href="http://www.perlworkshop.no/npw2009/">2009 Nordic Perl Workshop</a> [2], April 16-17, 2009.
The 2009 Nordic Perl Workshop will have a special focus on Perl 6,
Rakudo Perl, and Parrot, including Perl 6 tutorials and hackathons
after the conference itself.
</p><p>A list of the other planned release dates and codenames for 2009 is
available in the "docs/release_guide.pod" file.  In general, Rakudo
development releases are scheduled to occur two days after each
Parrot monthly release.  Parrot releases the third Tuesday of each month.
</p><p>Rakudo Perl now uses git [3] for its version control system, hosted
at <a href="http://github.com/rakudo/rakudo">http://github.com/rakudo/rakudo</a> .  The README file there is kept
up-to-date with the latest instructions for obtaining and building
Rakudo Perl.
</p><p>In this release of Rakudo Perl, we've made the following major changes
and improvements:
</p><ul> <li>Rakudo is now passing 7273 spectests.  This is an increase of 197
passing tests since the February 2009 release.
</li><li>The eval() construct now understands lexical variables from an
outer scope.
</li><li>More of the builtin functions ("settings") are being written in Perl 6.
</li><li>Rakudo supports the "R" (reverse) metaoperator.
</li><li>Parsing of if, unless, while, until, etc. statements after blocks
now works correctly.
</li><li>The Q quote operator is now implemented, along with several adverbial
forms.  In particular, the Q:PIR form allows inline PIR to be
included in Perl 6 code.
</li><li>Multi-method dispatch now works with inheritance also.
</li></ul><p>The development team thanks all of our contributors and sponsors for
making Rakudo Perl possible.  The next release of Rakudo (#16) is
scheduled for April 23, 2009.

<h2>Playing with Rakudo</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ajs/">ajs</a> on 2009-04-03T18:27:19</h3>
I've just downloaded Rakudo and started playing with it. It's a very nice piece of software, and given the power and elegance of the Parrot Compiler Tools, it's wonderful to see something making large-scale use of it.

<p>However, it should be noted that Rakudo really isn't at the point that people should expect to grab it and start hacking on Perl 6 code. It parses a good chunk of the language, but if you're looking to get your feet wet writing P6 you'll probably just end up breaking your keyboard every time it gives you a nonsensical error.

</p><p>Still, very impressive!

</p><p>Once I have more hands-on with it, I'll throw some thoughts up on essays.ajs.com</p>
