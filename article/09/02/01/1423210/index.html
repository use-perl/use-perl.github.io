by virtue of having been placed in these directories for a while,
even though they were never documented as far as I can tell?  Or
are these files considered to be an internal implementation detail

deletion?&quot;</em> -- Karl Williamson, waging war on two fronts simultaneously,
Perl <strong>and</strong> Unicode.</p></p>
<p><h1> <a name="topics_of_interest">Topics of Interest</a> </h1><h2> <a name="interesting_git_based_changelog_workflow">Interesting git-based changelog workflow</a> </h2></p><p>Aristotle Pagaltzis mentioned a workflow he had heard about regarding
git. The aim was to ease the burden of producing the Changelog and
perldelta files, which are huge timesinks as it involves sifting
through thousands of commit messages to look for the big-ticket
items. The solution is to create a more incremental effort.</p><p>Dave Mitchell said he hoped to produce a one line summary for perldelta
for each day of reviewing and merging patches from blead to maint.</p><p>A number of porters highlighted the difficulty of being able
to know precisely when a bug was fixed, since smokers of CPAN
on blead tended to uncover problems a long time after the &quot;final&quot;
patch had landed. David Golden suggested that a <code>add-perldelta</code>

tool might be a step in the right direction to keep track of the
changes at an appropriately high meta-level of changes.</p><p>

</p><h2> <a name="disabling_suidperl_in_configure">disabling <code>suidperl</code> in Configure</a> </h2></p><p>Nicholas Clark put forward a patch to prevent <code>suidperl</code> being
configured in 5.11 and beyond and wondered if there was a better
approach. Andy Dougherty suggested another way, but it had the
disadvantage of increasing the workload for H.Merijn Brand, the

<code>Configure</code> pumpking, and would also not produce a useful error
message if someone attempted to try and build <code>suidperl</code> in 5.12
anyway.</p><p>As it was, H.Merijn applied Nicholas's patch.</p><p>

was some brave maintainer who wanted to resurrect it, all they
had to do was to reverse out one change from their local git
repository.</p><p>

</p><h2> <a name="mingw_libperl_broken"> <code>mingw libperl</code> broken</a> </h2></p><p>Reini Urban reported a discrepancy between mingw and cygwin as to
what public functions were exported to the world at large. Nicholas
Clark thought that mingw (not exporting three particular functions)
was correct, and it was cygwin that was being lax. And further,
modules outside the core had no business in defining <code>PERL_CORE</code>
in order to call functions to which it had no right.</p><p>This problem is not limited to the Windows platform. AIX also has
a strict policy on what is and isn't exported.</p><p>Dmitry Karasik noted that the problem had been found a long time
ago and a patch had been produced, and wondered why it had never
been applied. This allowed Nicholas Clark to recycle his standard
remark about volunteer workers and companies using Perl not making
resources or money forward in order to improve the situation.</p><p>

</p><p>Reini revived cpan bug #28912 to fix <code>B::Generate</code> and deal with
its breakage. He said that three functions, <code>Perl_pad_alloc</code>,
<code>Perl_cv_clone</code> and <code>Perl_fold_constants</code> are exported anyway,
and so should be published in the API as such. Nicholas Clark was
a lot more reticent, saying that while it may indeed be useful for
them to be exported, were they documented, testable, stable and
supportable.</p><p>

</p><h2> <a name="lsb_testing_issue_with_test__harness">LSB testing issue with <code>Test::Harness</code> </a> </h2></p><p>Stew Benedict reported a problem with the LSB project's handling
of perl's test infrastructure. They currently use <code>Test::Harness</code>
version N-1, and run into problems when that is upgraded to the
current version N.</p><p>Yves Orton thought that the best way forward was to deal with the
pain now and upgrade to the current version, even if there were
backward compatible shims available for those who wished to  keep
working with N-1.</p><p>

<pre>
  duty now for the future
  <a href="http://xrl.us/beeigb">http://xrl.us/beeigb</a> </pre>
</p><p>Later on, Stew gave a status report on the second round of Perl
modules included in the LSB. He made a list of modules that had
been pulled out of their core distribution, a list of modules
that might yet be pulled, and a list of those modules that
remain, along with their counts as pre-requisites. Stew explained
that it was easier to pull things out now, possibly to put them
in later, rather than the other way around. Thus, it would pay
to be as aggressive as possible.</p><p>Yves Orton thought that removing parts of the testing infrastructure
was definitely a bad idea. Nicholas Clark pointed out that while
<code>CGI</code> has been in core for a long time, FreeBSD removed it in a
recent release, apparently without much ill effect. He also responded
with a large list of modules that have achieved ubiquity (and thus
must be present) as well as other modules that also must be present
even though we all wish they would curl up in a corner and die.</p><p>

</p><h2> <a name="need_advice_on_gotchas_on_upgrading_unicode_db_to_5_1">Need advice on gotchas on upgrading unicode db to 5.1</a> </h2></p><p>Karl Williamson is currently working on bring the Unicode database
in Perl up to date with the latest and greatest, version 5.1.</p><p>The first problem he encountered was that the previous update didn't
upgrade the Property Value Aliases, which is a hassle, because
upgrading it now may introduce curious backward compatible bugs.</p><p>H.Merijn Brand thought that the problems Karl was raising were
sufficiently far down in the basement that the general public
shouldn't be aware of them, let alone rely on them, and that
anything that allowed Perl to track Unicode with a minimum of
intermediate layers and mappings was a worthy goal. He also
put forward his idea of the list of files in the distribution
that the general public was likely to be aware of, and using.</p><p>Karl went ahead after receiving additional clearance from Nicholas,
and CYAed himself with a &quot;these files are subject  to change without
notice&quot; header.</p><p>

</p><h2> <a name="use_bytes_and_regular_expressions"> <code>use bytes</code> and regular expressions</a> </h2></p><p>Karl is also continuing to wade through the crocodile-infested
swamp of bytes, characters and regular expressions and was
wondering what exactly should be happening when a regular expression
was being compiled when <code>use bytes</code> was effect. The main problem
being a complete lack of guidance insofar as the test suite makes
no attempt to specify what should be happening one way or another.</p><p>

</p><h2> <a name="glob___on_vms_totally_different_to_unix"> <code>glob()</code> on VMS totally different to Unix</a> </h2></p><p>John Malmberg was stunned to learn that <code>glob('foo')</code> on VMS is the
equivalent to <code>glob('foo.*')</code>, as it can lead to some pretty nasty
cross-platform side effects. And even more curiously, there was
explicit code to make things behave differently on VMS if <code>'foo'</code>

were in fact a directory. He wondered what the appropriate fix would
be. The goal was to get <code>Module::Build</code> working correctly on VMS.</p><p>Craig Berry wasn't too sure either, since the observed <code>glob</code>
behaviour had been like that since time immemorial, and it also
happened to reflect the native behaviour in VMS anyway.</p><p>John countered that in actual fact it was the utilities that were
doing the expansion, not the shell.</p><p>Peter Prymmer voiced the opinion that things are working according
to spec already, and pointed out that <code>unlink</code> only removes the
current version of the file (since the RMS filesystem on VMS allows
multiple versions of the same file to exist simultaneously -- a
concept quite alien to Unix where Perl was initially developed).</p><p>Peter also thought that <code>Module::Build</code> really ought to be doing
the <code>opendir</code>/<code>readdir</code>/<code>closedir</code> dance, since differences in
<code>glob</code> behaviour had been observed in the past among different
Unices.</p><p>After some more work, John produced a final patch that cleared up
the remaining <code>Module::Build</code> test errors. He then spotted a
different error, that Craig Berry identified as being fallout
from the Y2038+ code that entered blead recently. Craig
promised to get it sorted out if no-one else wanted to.</p><p>

</p><h2> <a name="lock___on_a_code_ref"> <code>lock()</code> on a code ref?</a> </h2></p><p>Jerry D. Hedden wondered why we check for code references when locking
scalars, since it is meaningless to do so. He wanted to remove it
since he felt it was superfluous. Dave Mitchell suggested putting
an assertion in its place.</p><p>

</p><h2> <a name="a_plan_for_ext_">A plan for <em>ext/</em> </a> </h2></p><p>Nicholas Clark would like to clean up <em>ext/</em> by hoisting anything
that pertains to the build process <em>per se</em>, such as <em>make_ext.pl</em>
so that all that is left are the extensions themselves.</p><p>He also wants to flatten the directory structure so that all module
build directories can be globbed with <code>ext/*</code>.</p><p>The Windows and VMS platforms in particular need some refactoring
done so that everything can be driven off a generic <code>make_ext</code>

build process. Some modules will need to have a <em>Makefile.PL</em>
synthesised as well. Another problem to address is the dependency
chain: ensuring a modules's prerequisites are built before it is.</p><p>Craig A. Berry remembered his classes and noted that <em>ext/</em> used
to represent modules that contained XS components, and <em>lib/</em>
those that didn't. While he didn't have a problem with Nicholas's
idea, he pointed out it would be a good idea to look for cruft
in <code>%Config</code> and <code>installperl</code> that such a change would create.</p><p>And then dual-life modules can migrate from <em>./lib</em> to <em>./ext</em>.</p><p>Stay tuned next week.</p><p>
<pre>
  sounds like a... oh wait

</p><h2> <a name="a_plan_for_pod_">A plan for <em>pod/</em> </a> </h2></p><p>Nicholas also had some good ideas about POD. For instance,
<em>pod/perlapi.pod</em>, <em>pod/perlintern.pod</em> and <em>pod/perltoc.pod</em>
are currently maintained under revision control, but could just
as easily be generated dynamically by <code>./miniperl</code> during the
build. Similarly, the <code>man</code> pages could be built before the
install phase, thus avoiding another step that currently performed
in a task run with super-user privileges.</p><p>One benefit is that it reduces the amount of data shipped in an
perl tarball, and helps reduce the speed at which the generated
documentation drifts out of date.</p><p>

compilers.  People install a free compiler, such as gcc. To work out how to
build extensions, Perl interrogates <code>%Config</code>, so in this situation

<code>%Config</code> describes compilers that aren't there, and extension building
fails. This forces people into choosing between re-compiling perl themselves
using the compiler they have, or only using modules that the vendor ships.</p><p>It would be good to find a way teach <code>Config.pm</code> about the installation setup,
possibly involving probing at install time or later, so that the <code>%Config</code> in
a binary distribution better describes the installed machine, when the
installed machine differs from the build machine in some significant way.</p><hr>

</p><h2> <a name="run_make_patchnum_pl_before_configpm">Run <em>make_patchnum.pl</em> before configpm</a> </h2></p><p>Jerry D. Hedden wanted to ensure that <em>ib/Config_git.pl</em> was
available before <code>configpm</code> was right, but this turned out to be
surprisingly difficult in the light of parallel make environments
and stamping out the possibility of race conditions that could
arise therein.</p><p>

checks designed to prevent <code>mktables</code> from being run repeatedly
during the build process. Just when he thought he had things solved
he ran into another problem. Rafa&#235;l suggested that the remaining
problem was also some sort of bogus optimisation and so maybe it
too should be brute forced.</p><p>

</p><h2> <a name="file__copy_and_permission_bits"> <code>File::Copy</code> and permission bits</a> </h2></p><p>Charles Bailey stumbled across a pot of tuits and spent them on
learning git and cleaning up <code>File::Copy</code>, specifically, the
management of permission bits. The result was to make <code>cp</code> more
POSIXy and <code>copy</code> more native.</p><p>Abigail added a few more tests to look at how the copy dealt with
setuid and sticky bits, and pointed out that there was now a
potential world visibility race condition in the code for anyone
in a Unix session with a <code>022</code> umask (all too common). Charles
thought that <code>File::Copy</code>'s security mandate didn't stretch that
far (the paranoid are invited to look at a hand-rolled solution
involving <code>sysopen</code>).</p><p>

allow a program to <code>require</code> a file (and thus, run code) even
if said file happens to be world writable. There was some talk of
making taint deal with this (refuse to load the file, &#224; la openssh)

on whether or <code>A::B</code> and/or <code>A::B::C</code> are defined. This then
leads to program behaviour that can be difficult to predict.</p><p>Eric Brine pointed out that <code>A::B::-&gt;C</code> is the preferred

<code>Module::Load::Conditional</code> was also upgraded to clear up some
bugs in the test suite itself, smoked out by Win32 and VMS.</p></dd><dd>

</p><p>Ren&#233;e B&#228;cker thought it would be great to <strong>show -E in error message
when called with -E</strong>, and on the surface it is. Except it breaks tests
like <code>$0 eq '-e'</code> and to Do The Right Thing in light of that was so hard
that all hope was abandoned.</p><p>

</p><p>Ben Morrow spotted some curious behaviour when calling
<strong> <code>-t</code>, <code>-T</code> on IO refs</strong> and a variation on the theme
that tripped an assertion failure. He promised to write
a patch after he had audited the rest of the codebase
for uses of <code>isGV()</code>.</p><p>

</p><p>Ricardo Signes wrote a rough patch to <strong>remove indirect
method calls from documentation</strong>. This was applied, but he
admitted that other examples no doubt lie around in obscure
corners of the documentation.(I thought chromatic wrote an exhaustive
patch for this a couple of years ago --ed).</p><p>

<h2>The Previous Indirect Method Call Patch</h2>

<blockquote><div><p> <em>I thought chromatic wrote an exhaustive patch for this a couple of years ago --ed</em></p></div> </blockquote><p>I did, but it was too good: it patched the documentation of several dual-lived modules, and I felt exhausted when I considered contacting all of them separately.</p>
