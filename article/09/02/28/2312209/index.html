<h1>Rakudo Perl development release #14</h1>

<div class="span8">
<p>On behalf of the Rakudo development team, I'm pleased to announce
the February 2009 development release of Rakudo Perl #14 "Vienna".
Rakudo is an implementation of Perl 6 on the Parrot Virtual Machine [1].
The tarball for the February 2009 release is available from
<a href="http://www.pmichaud.com/perl6/rakudo-2009-02.tar.gz">http://www.pmichaud.com/perl6/rakudo-2009-02.tar.gz</a>
<p>However, because of the rapid pace of Rakudo development and addition
of new features, we still recommend that people wanting to use or work
with Rakudo obtain the latest version directly from the main repository
at github -- more on this in a bit.
</p><p>This is the fourteenth development release of Rakudo Perl, but it's
the first release independent from Parrot releases.  We will continue
to follow a monthly release cycle, with each release to be code named
after a Perl Mongers group.  This release is named for Vienna.pm
(<a href="http://vienna.pm.org/">http://vienna.pm.org</a>), who have been sponsoring Jonathan Worthington's
work on Rakudo since April 2008.  A list of the other planned release
dates and codenames for 2009 is available in the "docs/release_guide.pod"
file.  In general, Rakudo development releases are scheduled to occur
two days after each Parrot monthly release.  Parrot releases the third
Tuesday of each month.
</p><p>Rakudo Perl now uses git [2] for its version control system, hosted
at <a href="http://github.com/rakudo/rakudo">http://github.com/rakudo/rakudo</a> .  The README file there is kept
up-to-date with the latest instructions for obtaining and building
Rakudo Perl.
</p><p>In this release of Rakudo Perl, we've made the following major changes
and improvements:
</p><ul> <li>Rakudo is now passing 7076 spectests.  This is an increase of 796
passing tests since the January 2009 release.
</li><li>The Configure.pl script supports a "--gen-parrot" option to
automatically fetch and build the appropriate version of Parrot.
</li><li>The default make target now builds a binary executable directly, either
perl6 or perl6.exe.  It's still a Parrot "fakecutable", but we think
we've made it more reliable so that it doesn't generate segmentation
faults on exits.  (If you don't know what a "fakecutable" is you can
safely ignore this.)
</li><li>Many builtins are beginning to be written in pure Perl 6, or Perl 6
functions with inline PIR.  These builtins are part of the core
"setting" for Perl 6, and appear in the src/setting/ directory.
Previously this was known as the "prelude".
</li><li>Improved Test.pm diagnostic output.
</li></ul><p>Also, Rakudo now implements the following Perl 6 features:
</p><ul> <li>Anonymous classes may be specified using ::
</li><li>Existing parameterized roles are now reused instead of creating new ones.
</li><li>Roles pun a class when .new is invoked on them.
</li><li>"proto" now marks all same-named routines as "multi".
</li><li>"XopX" is now "Xop".
</li><li>&lt;-&gt; (rw) pointy blocks.
</li><li>min= and max= metaoperators.
</li><li>Many many bugfixes and documentation improvements.
</li></ul><p>The development team thanks all of our contributors and sponsors for
making Rakudo Perl possible.  The next release of Rakudo (#15) is
scheduled for March 19, 2009.

<h2>nice name :-)</h2>

(that's all I wanted to say but use.perl forces me to enter something here...)



<h2>Wow</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/bpphillips/">bpphillips</a> on 2009-02-27T13:20:37</h3>
Really, this is too easy.  I find myself looking for the man behind the curtain (I saw someone who looks like Father Christmas).



<h2>More info?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/sheriff_p/">sheriff_p</a> on 2009-03-06T06:54:20</h3>
Would it be possible to get updates on what's MISSING as well in these release notes? It'd be much easier to get an idea of the progress of the project with a "and this is what's stopping this from being a production release of Perl6"...<br/><br/>-P
