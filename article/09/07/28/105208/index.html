<p><a href="http://perlgeek.de/blog-en/">moritz</a> writes <i>"On behalf of the Rakudo development team, I'm pleased to announce the June 2009 development release of Rakudo Perl #19 "Chicago".<br> <br>Rakudo is an implementation of Perl 6 on the <a href="http://parrot.org/">Parrot Virtual Machine</a>.<br> <br>The tarball for the July 2009 release is available from <a href="http://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/downloads">http://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/downloads</a> </i> .</p>
<p><i>Due to the continued rapid pace of Rakudo development and the<br>frequent addition of new Perl 6 features and bugfixes, we continue<br>to recommend that people wanting to use or work with Rakudo obtain<br>the latest source directly from the main repository at github.<br>More details are available at <a href="http://rakudo.org/how-to-get-rakudo">http://rakudo.org/how-to-get-rakudo</a> .<br> <br>Rakudo Perl follows a monthly release cycle, with each release code named<br>after a Perl Mongers group.  The July 2009 release is named "Chicago",<br>as chosen by Perl 6 contributor Kyle Hasselbacher.  Kyle has been<br>doing a truly outstanding job of turning open tickets in the RT queues<br>into tests for the spectest suite.  Chicago.pm has been the host for<br>the 2006 and 2008 YAPC::NA conferences and sponsored Perl 6 hackathons<br>at each conference.<br> <br>In this release of Rakudo Perl, we've focused our efforts on quality<br>improvements and bootstrapping.  We now have operators and additional<br>builtin functions written in Perl 6.<br> <br>Some of the specific major changes and improvements in this release include:<br> <br>* Rakudo is now passing 11,876 spectests, an increase of 340<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; passing tests since the June 2009 release.  With this release<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Rakudo is now passing 68% of the available spectest suite.<br> <br>* Operators can now be written in Perl 6, and this has been done for the<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; series operator '...', 'eqv' and the 'leg' operator.<br> <br>* The multi dispatcher has been refactored extensively, and now handles many<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; more edge cases correctly.<br> <br>* User defined traits now follow the specification much more closely; some<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; built-in traits are written in Perl 6.<br> <br>* Improved testing: Null PMC Access exceptions are never considered<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; "successful" by the test suite, even if the test was expecting a<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; (different) exception to be thrown.<br> <br>* Improved introspection: you can now get a list of roles composed into a<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; class, and a list of attributes.<br> <br>Since the Perl 6 specification is still in flux, some deprecated features<br>will be removed from Rakudo. Prominently among those are:<br> <br>
&nbsp; * '=$handle' is deprecated in favor of '$handle.get' (one line)<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and '$handle.lines' (all lines).<br> <br>
&nbsp; * 'int $obj' is deprecated in favor of '$obj.Int'.<br> <br>The development team thanks all of our contributors and sponsors for<br>making Rakudo Perl possible.  If you would like to contribute,<br>see <a href="http://rakudo.org/how-to-help">http://rakudo.org/how-to-help</a> , ask on the perl6-compiler@perl.org<br>mailing list, or ask on IRC <i>#perl6 on freenode.<br> <br>The next release of Rakudo (#20) is scheduled for August 20, 2009.<br>A list of the other planned release dates and codenames for 2009 is<br>available in the "docs/release_guide.pod" file.  In general, Rakudo<br>development releases are scheduled to occur two days after each<br>Parrot monthly release.  Parrot releases the third Tuesday of each month.<br> <br>Have fun!</i> </i></p>
