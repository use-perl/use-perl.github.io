It gives me great pleasure to announce the release of Perl 5.11.2.
 <br> <br>
This is the third DEVELOPMENT release in the 5.11.x series leading to a
stable release of Perl 5.12.0. You can find a list of high-profile changes
in this release in the file &quot;perl5112delta.pod&quot; inside the distribution.

 <br> <br>
You can download the 5.11.2 release from:

The release&#39;s SHA1 signatures are:

 0014442fdd0492444e1102e1a80089b6a4649682 &#160;perl-5.11.2.tar.bz2</p></div></div></p>
<p>
<br>
We welcome your feedback on this release. If you discover issues
with Perl 5.11.2, please use the &#39;perlbug&#39; tool included in this
distribution to report them. If Perl 5.11.2 works well for you, please
use the &#39;perlthanks&#39; tool included with this distribution to tell the
all-volunteer development team how much you appreciate their work.<br>
<br>
If you write software in Perl, it is particularly important that you test
your software against development releases. While we strive to maintain
source compatibility with prior stable versions of Perl wherever possible,
it is always possible that a well-intentioned change can have unexpected
consequences. If you spot a change in a development version which breaks
your code, it&#39;s much more likely that we will be able to fix it before the
next stable release. If you only test your code against stable releases
of Perl, it may not be possible to undo a backwards-incompatible change
which breaks your code.<br>
<br>
Notable changes in this release:<ul> <li>

It is now possible to overload the C operator</li><li>
Extension modules can now cleanly hook into the Perl parser to define new kinds of keyword-headed expression and compound statement</li><li>
The lowest layers of the lexer and parts of the pad system now have C APIs available to XS extensions</li><li>
Use of C&lt;:=&gt; to mean an empty attribute list is now deprecated</li></ul><p>




Perl 5.11.2 represents approximately 3 weeks development since Perl

modules included in Perl&#39;s core. We&#39;re grateful to the entire CPAN
