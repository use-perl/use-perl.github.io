<p><p>Announce: Rakudo Perl 6 development release #23 ("Lisbon")</p><p>On behalf of the Rakudo development team, I'm pleased to announce the<br>November 2009 development release of Rakudo Perl #23 "Lisbon".<br>Rakudo is an implementation of Perl 6 on the Parrot Virtual Machine<br>(see http://www.parrot.org).  The tarball for the November 2009 release<br>is available from http://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/downloads</p><p>Due to the continued rapid pace of Rakudo development and the frequent<br>addition of new Perl 6 features and bugfixes, we recommend building Rakudo<br>from the latest source, available from the main repository at github.<br>More details are available at http://rakudo.org/how-to-get-rakudo.</p><p>Rakudo Perl follows a monthly release cycle, with each release code<br>named after a Perl Mongers group.  The November 2009 release is code<br>named "Lisbon" for Lisbon.pm, who did a marvellous job arranging this<br>year's YAPC::EU.</p><p>Shortly after the October 2009 (#22) release, the Rakudo team<br>began a new branch of Rakudo development ("ng") that refactors<br>the grammar to much more closely align with STD.pm as well as<br>update some core features that have been difficult to achieve<br>in the master branch [1, 2].  Most of our effort for the past month<br>has been in this new branch, but as of the release date the new<br>version had not sufficiently progressed to be the release copy.<br>We expect to have the new version in place in the December 2009 release.</p><p>This release of Rakudo requires Parrot 1.8.0.  One must still<br>perform "make install" in the Rakudo directory before the "perl6"<br>executable will run anywhere other than the Rakudo build directory.<br>For the latest information on building and using Rakudo Perl, see the<br>readme file section titled "Building and invoking Rakudo".</p><p>Some of the specific changes and improvements occuring with this<br>release include:</p><p>* Rakudo is now passing 32,753 spectests, an increase of 171 passing<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; tests since the October 2009 release.  With this release Rakudo is<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; now passing 85.5% of the available spectest suite.</p><p>* As mentioned above, most development effort for Rakudo in November<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; has taken place in the "ng" branch, and will likely be reflected<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; in the December 2009 release.</p><p>* Rakudo now supports unpacking of arrays, hashes and objects in<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; signatures</p><p>* Rakudo has been updated to use Parrot's new internal calling conventions,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; resulting in a slight performance increase.</p><p>The development team thanks all of our contributors and sponsors for<br>making Rakudo Perl possible.  If you would like to contribute,<br>see http://rakudo.org/how-to-help , ask on the perl6-compiler@perl.org<br>mailing list, or ask on IRC #perl6 on freenode.</p><p>The next release of Rakudo (#24) is scheduled for December 17, 2009.<br>A list of the other planned release dates and codenames for 2009 is<br>available in the "docs/release_guide.pod" file.  In general, Rakudo<br>development releases are scheduled to occur two days after each<br>Parrot monthly release.  Parrot releases the third Tuesday of each month.</p><p>Have fun!</p><p>[1] http://use.perl.org/user/pmichaud/journal/39779<br>[2] http://use.perl.org/user/pmichaud/journal/39874</p></p>
