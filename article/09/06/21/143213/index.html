<p>The Perl 6 design team met by phone on 06 May 2009.  Larry, Allison,
Patrick, Nicholas, and chromatic attended.</p>
<p>&gt; <strong>Larry:</strong><ul>
<li>refactored my phone</li><li>refactored various functions</li><li> <code>comb</code> now defaults to matching single characters</li><li>a <code>words</code> method now does what <code>comb</code> used to do</li><li>did some work on <code>pick</code> </li><li>looked at most of the functions in containers to see whether they out to return a <code>List</code> or a <code>Capture</code> which returns an <code>Item</code> </li><li>depends on whether the function would ever be used to pull a single thing out</li><li>whether people expected it to do the right thing as an <code>Item</code> </li><li> <code>pick</code> is one of those functions</li><li>worked on the semantics of <code>has</code> </li><li>the initializer semantics; the syntax hasn't changed</li><li>worked on the relationship between multiple <code>has</code> if you have multiple attributes</li><li>straightened out a mismatch between prefix parsing specification and implementation</li><li>turned the term "protoobject" into "type object"</li><li>thinking about the notion of braided languages</li><li>Perl isn't a single language</li><li>also a regexp language, a quoting language, a quasi-quoting language</li><li>they hand off to each other</li><li>they have to keep track of each other; I call that a "braid"</li><li>how you override one language in another</li><li>how do you handle regexp language changes from regular Perl, when you're not in the regexp language at the time?</li><li>thinking about how to get the derivations to work correctly</li><li>when you parse a regexp or a quote</li><li>now instead of starting at a language like <code>q</code>, it starts at the current <code>q</code>-ish language in your braid</li><li>in support of that, I implemented temporization of context variables in <code>gimme5</code> </li><li>used to temporize current braids to a lexical scope</li><li>added a block after <code>try</code> in parsing</li><li>it uses that rather than parsing the block as the first argument of a list operator</li><li>likewise the other statement prefix operators</li><li>added the auxiliary <code>hides</code> trait</li><li>the <code>\c</code> notation for characters allows any radix of integer inside the list</li><li>the <code>\c</code>, <code>\o</code>, and <code>\x</code> notations all parse consistently now</li><li>enums are parsed more correctly</li><li>they don't give bogus duplicate warnings</li><li>if you declare a lexical symbol with <code>::</code> in it, assumes you're referring to a subpackage of the current lexical scope</li><li>means something different from a symbol intended to scan outward</li><li>along with the notion of braided languages and derivability, derived languages can add more parser variables (<code>$?foo</code>) with a virtual function for lookup</li><li>avoids clobbering the core definitions</li><li>worked on role parameters</li><li>they're now in the role's pad, like normal signature parameters</li><li>started playing with the <code>YOU_ARE_HERE</code> stub used to define the effective insertion location of your code into a <code>Setting</code> </li><li>determining which lexical pad to dump as the <code>Setting</code>'s context for use by other compilation units</li><li>did a lot of work on error messsages</li><li>some of my <code>||</code>s suppressed panic messages</li><li>more useful error message on the null pattern (<code>//</code>)</li><li>gives a better message if you slurp your control block in the preceding expression</li></ul><p> <strong>Patrick:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>had a lot of discussions online</li><li>not as much coding as I like</li><li>seem to be answering questions for others</li><li>quite a bit of work on Rakudo internals refactoring</li><li>that'll make it easier to switch it over to be its own HLL in Parrot</li><li>moved things around</li><li>made a single constant definition we can change when we move it over to its own HLL</li><li>also moved all of the Parrot HLL mangling into its own source code files</li><li>easy for us to manage there</li><li>fixed some bugs</li><li>talked with Jonathan about refactoring the P6object implementation</li><li>used in Rakudo and PCT for Perl 6 object-like behaviors</li><li>he's working on that refactoring now</li><li>found and fixed a couple of bugs handling implicit slurpy positionals</li><li>made Rakudo's standard IO handles default to UTF-8 encoding</li><li>gives people behavior more like they expect</li><li>working on changes to the <code>Array</code> and <code>List</code> implementation</li><li>currently <code>List</code> inherits from <code>ResizablePMCArray</code> </li><li>we'll change that to contain it</li><li>that should clean up a lot of behavior</li><li>Rakudo passed the 11,000 spectest mark as of two days ago</li></ul><p> <strong>Allison:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>spent some time on ticket, milestone, and roadmap maintenance</li><li>helping other people start or continue their tasks</li><li>launched the install PDD out of draft</li><li>it doesn't address every question, but I cleaned out all of the inaccuracies</li><li>fits our current plan</li><li>probably needs more expansion when we figure out the source of some of our problems building Rakudo and Partcl</li><li>the general problem is that we've built all of our languages from the build tree, never and installed Parrot</li></ul><p> <strong>c:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>I've been explaning Perl 6 roles on my new weblog</li><li>lots of feedback</li><li>still lots of explaining to do</li><li>also been profiling Parrot and Rakudo startup</li><li>Parrot's a lot faster now (cotto and bacek's work on vtable init helped immensely)</li><li>Rakudo's getting faster, but it has a ways to go</li><li>will keep working on that, but the progress has been decent with little investment</li><li>discussed exception handling with Allison</li><li>came up with a preliminary design to handle the interior runloop exit there</li><li>just syntax to hide tricky semantics</li></ul><p> <strong>Patrick:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>when dealing with exceptions, handlers, and returns for subroutines</li><li>it'd be nice to force a return from a subroutine higher up in the caller chain</li><li>akin to Perl 6's <code>leave</code> semantics</li><li>trying to do that without throwing an exception....</li><li>if we do it with exceptions requires every block to have a handler</li></ul><p> <strong>Allison:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>invoke the return continuation several levels back?</li></ul><p> <strong>Patrick:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>is that easily doable at this point</li></ul><p> <strong>Allison:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>we have all of the ability for that, but no syntax for it</li></ul><p> <strong>Patrick:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>I don't necessarily need syntax for it</li><li>the natural approach is to find the appropriate caller</li><li>I need to do that anyway</li><li>then ask for its <code>ReturnContinuation</code> </li><li>then invoke that with the values I want to return to its caller</li></ul><p> <strong>c:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>makes sense to me</li></ul><p> <strong>Patrick:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>that may exist in PIR syntax like that anyway</li><li>if the easy invoke doesn't work, use some combination of <code>set_returns</code> </li></ul><p> <strong>Allison:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>not sure if we have in PIR right now the way to ask the caller for its return continuation</li><li>you can do it from C</li><li>we can add something which does that</li></ul><p> <strong>Patrick:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>if I ask for a <code>Sub</code>'s current context</li><li>I could write a method on a sub to do that</li><li>it'll be easier and nicer when our contexts are PMCs</li><li>as an intermediate case, that would be it</li><li>related to that, this might be there too</li><li>is there a way for a <code>Sub</code> to register behavior to execute just before it exits</li></ul><p> <strong>Allison:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>are those like the <code>LEAVE</code> hooks in Perl 6?</li><li>we have a place to store them now</li><li>we don't right now have a way of flagging a particular handler to execute at block scope exit</li><li>would it make sense to call that an event?</li></ul><p> <strong>Patrick:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>it might</li><li>before saying what we do and don't have</li><li>one piece of this is that there's still a <code>push_action</code> opcode</li></ul><p> <strong>Allison:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>it never worked</li><li>we're removing it</li><li>the global stack never synchronized with continuations</li><li>it dummied up to work, but it doesn't have the automatic stack cleanup behavior</li></ul><p> <strong>Patrick:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>the other possibility is the presence of <code>ONEXIT</code> or <code>LEAVE</code> hooks on <code>Sub</code>s in Parrot</li></ul><p> <strong>Allison:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>do you want all <code>Sub</code>s to have that</li><li>or at runtime would you want to attach a handler to that sub?</li></ul><p> <strong>Patrick:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>it might be nice to have that at compile time</li><li>I suspect it'll end up being an attached block</li></ul><p> <strong>Allison:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>can we tie that cleanly with other execution pieces?</li><li> <code>NEXT</code> and <code>LAST</code> etc</li></ul><p> <strong>Patrick:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>the biggest difference with <code>LEAVE</code> is that it's not exception-based</li><li>Larry thinks of it as natural to a block</li><li>PCT models the rest as exceptional</li></ul><p> <strong>Allison:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>it sounds like a handler to store in the local handler list</li><li>mark it so that it's clearly not an exception</li><li>we have handler flags -- exception, event, etc</li><li>we add to the execution code for <code>Sub</code>s</li><li>as it returns or ends, it checks to see if there was a handler</li><li>invokes it if so</li></ul><p> <strong>Patrick:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>sounds good to me</li><li>it's come up if you're thinking about these issues anyway</li></ul><p> <strong>Nicholas:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>how useful is MAD that's in Perl 5 blead still?</li></ul><p> <strong>Larry:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>I don't know</li><li>it may turn out to be very important</li><li>depends on how possible it is to write a decent Perl 5 parser in Perl 6</li><li>where <em>decent</em> is a very peculiar definition meaning "indecent"</li><li>this is unknown</li><li>for interleaving Perl 5 and Perl 6 on various VMs, some VMs will use a Perl 5 compiler written in Perl 6</li><li>that may not be a solution as nice as using the real Perl 5 parser which knows its own idiosyncracies</li></ul><p> <strong>c:</strong> </p><ul>
<li> <em>sometimes</em> it does</li></ul><p> <strong>Larry:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>that's the point</li><li>I'd hate to have to have to hack it up again</li><li>that was a lot of work</li></ul><p> <strong>Nicholas:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>it seems to suffer slow bitrot</li><li>no one seems to try to keep it up to date</li><li>when people change the parser, they don't change it</li><li>the question is if people still use it</li></ul><p> <strong>Larry:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>the vision is still to have a Perl 5 to Perl 6 translator</li><li>that's been on hold until we have a viable target to translate to</li><li>the demand for that will re-arise at some point</li><li>if it bitrots, it bitrots</li><li>that doesn't bother me as much as if people felt like ripping it out</li><li>the way to unbitrot it was roundtripping the test suite and fixing any problems</li><li>we'd just go back to doing that again until everything was reannotated the way it needs to be</li><li>the standard for when you know you're storing enough information is being able to reproduce it</li></ul><p> <strong>c:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>is there a test target to handle that?</li></ul><p> <strong>Larry:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>I used special scripts to do that</li><li>didn't expect other people to maintain that</li><li>it's MAD for a reason</li><li>nobody's tried to write a Perl 5 parser in Perl 6 yet</li><li>it's theoretically possible</li></ul><p> <strong>Patrick:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>depending how much fidelity you need for the actual Perl 5, you can get a pretty good way</li></ul><p> <strong>Larry:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>considering how much effort has gone into PPI, you can get a PPI-like result</li><li>that only takes you so far though</li></ul><p> <strong>Patrick:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>maybe a GSoC project next year would be for someone to start hacking something together with PPI</li><li>it'd be a worthwhile project</li></ul><p> <strong>Larry:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>we already have a Perl 5 to Perl 6 translator based on the state of MAD</li></ul></p>
