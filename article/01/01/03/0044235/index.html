<p><a href="http://www.earthweb.com/">EarthWeb</a> bought <a href="http://www.tpj.com/">The Perl Journal</a> back in <a href="__SLASHLINK__" sect="news" sid="99/05/07/0758200" sn="article" tid="11">May 1999</a>, and now EarthWeb has <a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/mf/001228/news01_001228.html">sold its web sites and newsletters</a> to <a href="http://internet.com/">Internet.com</a>.  It is not clear how TPJ will be affected.  Jon Orwant, editor of TPJ, sent out some email telling us what's going on: TPJ is apparently still owned by EarthWeb, issue #20 is done but waiting to be printed, and the future of TPJ is uncertain.</p>

From: Jon Orwant &lt;orwant@oreilly.com&gt;
To: Jon Orwant &lt;orwant@oreilly.com&gt;
Subject: The state of TPJ<br/><br/>January 2, 2001<br/><br/>Some folks have been asking me about the status of The Perl
Journal #20, and prospective authors have been asking me
about deadlines for future issues.  The answers: TPJ #20 is
in press and ready to print, but EarthWeb (the owner of TPJ)
has told the printer to stop the presses until further
notice.  I am currently responding to proposals sent to me
with approximately "I don't know if there's going to be
another issue, but when I do I'll respond to your proposal."<br/><br/>Since the future of the magazine is in doubt, I can't in
good conscience greenlight proposals; I will not encourage
an author to spend weeks writing an article when I know that
it might never be printed.  So I've told people who've asked
what I know about the current situation: while EarthWeb has
sold many of its properties to internet.com so that it can
focus on "career services", it has not sold TPJ.  However,
EarthWeb has also made it clear that they don't want to
publish TPJ any more.<br/><br/>This story has started to leak out to the Perl community and
has already mutated a bit in not-quite-correct directions,
so I wanted to write this note to set the record straight.
Or as straight as I can, given what little I know about
EarthWeb's decisions.<br/><br/>While TPJ's future is very much up in the air, people
shouldn't take this as any indicator about Perl itself.
TPJ was doing just fine back when I ran it, there's no
shortage of content out there, and the magazine could easily
go bimonthly and then monthly -- indeed, when EarthWeb
acquired TPJ I had thought that was the plan.  I still enjoy
the editing, the authors enjoy the writing, and the
designers enjoy the designing.  What happens now is up to
EarthWeb.  And no, I'm not suggesting that people bombard
them with email.  Heck, they just laid off 100 people, so
I'm not even sure who to bombard.  Eventually there will be
some resolution, and when there is I'll write again to let
everyone know.<br/><br/>As of December 27th, this matter is now in the courts, and
so I have to adopt the "just the facts" tone of this letter
without portraying my opinions.  Someday I'll be able to
talk more about what is happening in these strange days;
until then, you'll have to conjure up your own adjectives on
my behalf.<br/><br/>Cheers,<br/><br/>Jon Orwant</pre></p>

A few days ago I got an reply from custserv@tpj.com.  According to them:
<br>
<br>Earthweb is still fulfilling orders for back issues.
<br>
<br>Earthweb will be refunding a prorated amount to all subscribers of TPJ.
<br>
<br>From the sound of this, I doubt we will see another issue.

<i>From the sound of this, I doubt we will see another issue.</i> <p>I fear you are right. TPJ was the first really good tech journal since BYTE started falling apart in the late 1980's.</p>

Eep. This is unfortunate, since I had one issue left on my old subscription and decided to renew it. So I spend $25 (I think) for four issues that I'll probably never see. Might as well have waited with that renewal, then....
