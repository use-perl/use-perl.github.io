<p>brockgr writes <i>"We are all on the edge of our seats here. The <a href="__SLASHLINK__" sect="news" sid="00/12/18/1244208" sn="article" tid="6">trial release</a> came out in mid-December, and then silence. Are there problems, or is it just too good to give to the masses?"</i>

<p>Well, as Simon Cozens reports in the most recent <a href="http://www.perl.com/pub/q/archivep5p">P5P Digest</a> (which has gone out to the mailing list, but has yet to appear online):<pre>
  5.6.x delayed

   People seemed to think that this was monumental and catastrophic; it's
   not, but I mention it anyway: Alan asked what was happening to 5.6.1 -
   we've seen one trial release, and another one is eagerly expected.
   Sarathy replied that he probably won't have time to do anything much
   with it for the next few weeks, and offered to hand over maintainance
   of 5.6.x to anyone who wants it. People get busy; it's not the end of
   the world.

   Still, it does look like 5.6.1 is going to take a while to get out
   there. Hold on tight, though; my crystal ball tells me that Jarkko's
   been doing some work merging bleadperl patches into the 5.6
   maintainance branch.</pre></p></p>
