<h2>How?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/pudge/">pudge</a> on 2001-01-02T00:14:47</h3>
How did PHP get such a high installation rate?  I am not prepared to accept that there are more than three times as many Apache sites using PHP than perl.  Are there some Apache packages or something that come with PHP and not Perl?

I think there's one very significant contributing factor: you don't have to install a module to use Perl and installing a module is the easiest way to use PHP.
<p>
IOW: if you just want to allow people to use Perl and PHP, you only install mod_php, not mod_perl.  Once you've reached a point where performance of Perl programs is an issue (or you want to do something more interesting than a CGI) mod_perl is likely to get installed.
</p><p>
And IIRC, getting mod_php installed alongside Apache is very simple in RedHat (pick Apache and PHP and you get mod_php) but it's not quite so easy to get mod_perl (Pick Apache and Perl and then you still need to pick mod_perl to get it)</p>

It blows my mind as well, but a lot of people have the impression that PHP is LOADS easier than Perl. For some reason, it seems people think PHP is ok for web designers, but Perl is relegated only to the ranks of hardcore programmers. <br>
I've also spoken to some friends who, although they know Perl, use PHP because mod_php is so much easier to install and maintain. <br>
I think it has something to do with PHP's embedded nature. All you need to use the full power of PHP is mod_php installed, and then start chucking PHP in the middle of your HTML. With mod_perl you have to write a handler module and install it somewhere. Or use Apache::Registry, but even so, it's quite a bit more intimidating.<br> <br>
Now, of course, I think the easy to learn thing is a load of bollocks. I think PHP has all of Perl's syntax with none of the elegance or power. But I must admit, for real quick and dirty stuff, PHP's embedded-ness is quite nice.

They have ready to use out of the box applications for people to build mysql/php driven sites. I looked around rather extensively at one point and found nothing of similar features in the mysql/perl realm.
<br>
<br>Something that is up and running upon installation will always be attractive, moreso than something you have to read 5 manuals for before having something basic going.

<h2>Mostly, perl-{usage} ne mod_perl-{usage}</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/gwolf/">gwolf</a> on 2001-01-02T19:30:12</h3>
From what I have seen, most Perl users do NOT use mod_perl - Some do... But for quick, simple CGIs, CGI is enough.<br/><br/>Also... I know some sick guys who write simple sysadmin scripts in PHP - Yes, unembedded PHP. But I think they are not the bulk of PHP users. Most PHP users I have talked to are web designers who do not like coding, they want only to include a header/footer/CSS-stuff in their pages. PHP is great for that.

<h3><a href="/user/modred/">modred</a> on 2001-01-02T19:35:52</h3>
The high number for PHP is also contributed to by ISPs and web hosting services, PHP is less of a security headache than mod_perl. mod_perl allows anyone using it access to the Apache internals and that is generally not something most sysadmins want to expose.<br/><br/>mod_perl is also not aimed at the same user that PHP is. There is a much broader user base for PHP than for mod_perl.



<h2>mod_perl is often hidden</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/autarch/">autarch</a> on 2001-01-03T23:50:09</h3>
Its important to remember that mod_perl is often hidden away on a high port number with a plain vanilla mod_perl up front.  For mod_php this is probably less common.  For other modules who knows?
<br>
<br>This would almost definitely skew the numbers so I figure this survey is a load of poo.

How does that work, putting mod_perl on a different port?

it doesn't matter what we are prepared to accept
<br>as individuals: the market has spoken; and better
<br>technology - php - has prevailed, spectacularly...
<br>just as perl failed to meet "consumers" needs and
<br>allowed python to win mind - and market - share,
<br>perl allowed php (which rules...) to take the lead.
<br>
<br>perl's and python's "failures" have given birth to a
<br>superior language - ruby - which, with mod_ruby
<br>&amp; eruby (embedded ruby - like php) has already
<br>defeated python in japan. ruby will (eventually...)
<br>defeat perl and python globally, unless ruby takes
<br>the same road and fails to understand the market.
<br>
<br>i don't expect that to happen...
<br>
<br>i'm waiting to see what - if anything - perl people
<br>will do to prevent perl from being marginalized...
<br>
<br>no matter what's next, perl has been a good time.
