<p><a href="mailto:jjn1056@yahoo.com">jjn1056</a> writes <em>"As a follow up to the Gartner announcement regarding Apache, I logged on to their web site to see what they have to say about Perl.  I was shocked to find that there were only 93 articles in the database (compared to the 200 listed for Java) and that most of the articles had nothing to do with Perl.  For example, a report from August 31st, 2001 was titled "The Gartner Survey on Java Usage in Brazil."  The only listing that actually had the word "Perl" in the title was from the middle of 1997, entitled, "Perl: Is it still a Gem?"   Searching on "mod_perl" returned 3 results, 2 of which were primarily about Apache.  Search for "Servlets" in the same database returns 177 hits, while "JSP" returns 117."</em></p>
<p><em>"Is it really the case that Java is that much more popular, or are we just doing a very bad job of getting coverage from highly weighted sources like Gartner?  Just to compare, I did the same search at Forrester, and only found 4 articles about Perl, compared to the 200 about Java.

</em><p><em>In the era of IT downsizing, can we afford to ignore this trend?  Lots of great things are happening in the Perl community, but the outside world is not recognizing it.  I really wonder that if Apache can get such positive press, why can't Perl?"</em>

</p><p>This is a hot topic among some people.  My view is that people don't talk about perl the same way they don't talk about English and electricity.  It is just there, and lots of people use it, and it works great<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... what's there to say?  Sure, this kind of perception has its own problems, but I think Perl is widely viewed as this great tool that almost everyone uses, which is overall a good thing.</p></p>

<h2>promote perl with analysts, esp for web services</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/bbacker/">bbacker</a> on 2001-09-26T18:34:08</h3>

Especially alarming to me -- most of
the articles I've read recently about
web services (SOAP, UDDI, WSDL) talk
exclusively about java, or java vs.
microsoft's<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.NET. This ignores the great
work being done in other languages,
especially perl, and continues the
the mindset "it's enterprise web
related so it must be java". This
may not be reality, but that's the way
it's expressed in many software
trade magazines.<br/><br/>Are there any perl based implementations
of web services to point Gartner, et al
at? I mean functioning sites and services,
not the modules and libraries, to demonstrate
that web services are already being done
with perl in a corporate environment.
It seems like a business currently running their
web services with SOAP::Lite or Activestate perl<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.NET would make a convincing
counter-java case.



<h2>Gartner and vendors</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jdfox/">jdfox</a> on 2001-09-28T14:41:44</h3>
Gartner don't really deal in technology: they analyze vendors.  They never really wrote about Linux until significant commercial names like IBM started investing in it.
<p>Similarly, there will never be any notice taken of Perl at Gartner apart from brief, mostly disparaging comparisons when writing about similar technologies, until there is a "Perl vendor" who can go kiss Gartner's ring.  This means attending lots of their conferences, phoning them frequently with the "Perl story" on related developments, and generally arguing the business case for Perl.
</p><p>I'm hoping the pending PerlMongers/YAS merger will produce someone with the responsibility, time and talent for this kind of advocacy.  Otherwise, Gartner, Meta and the rest will continue thinking of Perl as "legacy technology".</p>

What about ActiveState?  They've been around for a while and provide enterprise support?  They are also actively developing Perl for MS<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.Net, so maybe they would be enough to convince people Perl is not a legacy technology.

A good idea: I'd be glad to hear of them coordinating with PM/YAS on this, sharing info etc.

<h2>Well said, sir!</h2>

<p>
 That's the best summary of Gartner I've heard...
 and you even managed not to be disparaging.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)
</p>
<p>
 Here are some Gartner pronouncements I find
 give a good assessment of their overall
 cluefulness:
</p>
 <ul>
<li> 1993: Windows NT (3.5) will have 80% of
 the desktop market within 2 years of release</li>
 <li> 1994: Internet will grow to 6 million
 users by 2005</li>
 <li> 1995: Cobol is used in over 65% of
 new application development</li>
 <li> 1996: Windows NT 4.0 will have 80% of
 the internet server market by 1998.</li>
 <li> 1996: Cobol is the world's
 'premier language for application deployment'
 and 'there should be no worries about the
 viability of COBOL for any project on any
 platform'</li>
 <li> 1987: 75 percent of the Internet
 services for large enterprises will move to
 usage-based pricing by 2001</li>
 <li> 1998: '[Y2K] failures in less developed
countries, smaller companies, and companies with
high global dependencies will cause a negative
impact to the world economy'</li>
 <li> 1999: Linux is 'Hype du Jour'. 'The
 lack of standards in the Linux community,
 coupled with a lack of key productivity
 applications and with Unix complexity, will
 continue to make Linux a poor choice for the
 mainstream business productivity user'. It
 soon appears that Microsoft sponsored
 the study. Gartner Group denies, but also
 quickly pulls the page from their site.
