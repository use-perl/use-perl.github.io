<p>hfb continues: <em>"O'Reilly may be hosting a Open Source licensing tutorial with a real lawyer, not Perry Mason, at TPC so be sure to check the schedule if you are interested in learning more about licenses and the benefits of using them.</em>

<p> <em>Again, please, please, please, license your modules and remind authors when you see unlicensed code on CPAN to add a statement of copyright/license and upload a new version to CPAN.

<h2>License? Licencing?</h2>

You see? This is why jjohn can't read...

In writing for an international audience, the best policy when confronted by words that are <strong>spelled</strong> differently by different English-speaking communities is to flip a coin each time such a word appears.  Inconsistency is preferable to giving <strong>offence</strong>.  The obvious extension is to pick a random language for each word as you go.

<p>Actually, I used 'Licence' because it was already spelled that way in h2xs where you will find that little code snippet.</p>

<p>If this gets your panties in a bunch, I suggest you get a A to Zed dictionary and get over it.</p>
