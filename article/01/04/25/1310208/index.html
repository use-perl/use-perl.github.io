<p>He said he would send in a submission to use Perl, but did not.  Nevertheless, Artur Bergman has been doing some promising work on an iThreads module, and has a <a href="mailto:perl-ithreads-subscribe@perl.org">perl-ithreads@perl.org mailing list</a> set up for it.

<p>iThreads are the new interpreter threading model, to replace the threading model introduced in perl 5.005.  The only way they are currently used in perl is to emulate fork on Windows, but they can also be accessed directly from Perl, if there's a module for it<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... hence Artur's work.  Help him out and make this something Really Cool for everyone.</p></p>

Talking to Artur on IRC, it seems he's got
<tt>iThread-&gt;create(sub {print "I am a thread"});</tt> working, with no races detected over 100 threads, too. This is fantastically important and fantastically cool.

<h3><a href="/user/pudge/">pudge</a> on 2001-04-25T15:27:07</h3>
Indeed.  After I get MacPerl 5.6/5.8/whatever released, this might become one of my priorities: getting threads working, so we can have not only forking (a la ActivePerl), but in-Perl threading.
<br>
<br>Now if only Mac OS had better memory management<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... (all you Mac OS X weenies can just shut up right now<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)



<h2>Documenting it</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/sky/">sky</a> on 2001-04-26T05:45:06</h3>
I will document my struggle with iThread in my use.perl.org journal.



<h2>Re:He's Done It!</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Simon/">Simon</a> on 2001-04-26T12:39:22</h3>
See, I said iThreads was the new Mac threading library, and everyone thought I was joking...



<h2>Re:He's Done It!</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jhi/">jhi</a> on 2001-04-27T04:26:02</h3>
So iThreads must be an evil proprietary plot of Apple! Pudge will sell us all to Jobs!<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

<p>Just look what's happened in the last year.  Everyone is using ibooks now.  Apparently you were right.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

Yep,  it will be avaible in iThread::Lime and iThread::Orange from the start. And we are working on licensing issues with the flowerpower patterns that Apple hold copyright on.
