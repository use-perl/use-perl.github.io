<p>Thyrsus wrote in about it first, but it is better to get it straight from O-Dogg himself: <a href="mailto:orwant@tpj.com">orwant</a> writes <em>"I'm happy to announce that I've gotten TPJ back from EarthWeb.  I
expect to find a permanent publisher for it shortly, but this is just
a short note to let everyone know that the magazine will definitely
continue.  Issue #20 (which has been in press since December) will be
printed and mailed in short order, and I'm once again accepting
article proposals.  There's a placeholder page up at <a href="http://tpj.com/">tpj.com</a>; I expect
old article content to become available in May.
</em><p><em>
It's been a very long winter, full of angst and attorneys.  I'll write
more later, but wanted to share the good news as soon as possible."</em></p></p>

<h2>Congratulations and Thanks</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/davorg/">davorg</a> on 2001-04-11T16:03:15</h3>
Jon,
<br>
<br>Congratulations on getting TPJ back and heartfelt thanks for taking the time to fight for it.
<br>
<br>I'm sure we all look forward to hearing the full story.
<br>
<br>Dave...
<br>



<h2>Good work</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/kellan/">kellan</a> on 2001-04-11T17:31:56</h3>
Having seen projects snatched away by greed and lawyers, I can only imagine how much work it has been to get TPJ back.  Good work, thanks for carrying the flame, I'm looking forward to new issues.

<p>Let me second that! The Perl Journal has been my favorite industry magazine for a long time. It's definitely the one I find most useful. Jon Orwant was an excellent (and entertaining) editor. I'm looking forward to having it in my book store again.</p>
<br> <p>Jon, if you're reading, thank you.</p>



<h2>Thank you and a Concern</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/_bitwise/">_bitwise</a> on 2001-04-11T18:07:17</h3>
Thank you for your hard work in saving our magazine.
<br>
<br>I have a concern, though.  I had just renewed my subscription before the problem with Earthweb.  I still have access to the online stuff.  I also signed up for the free Linux magazine offer to TPJ subscribers.  My question, of course, is, "Will we still have a year's subscription even though it's be six months since a magazine's been published?"



<h2>Yipee!</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/perlmonkey/">perlmonkey</a> on 2001-04-11T19:43:38</h3>
This is fantastic news.  Thanks so much, Jon et al.
<br>
<br>Mark one for the good guys<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... at last.



<h2>Aha!</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/emmet/">emmet</a> on 2001-04-11T20:09:27</h3>
This explains it --- I had been wondering where my PJs were<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;o)
<br>
<br>Emmet.

<h2>Re:Thank you and a Concern</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/orwant/">orwant</a> on 2001-04-12T01:57:59</h3>
The "right thing" will happen -- a one-year subscription means four issues, not a calendar year.  If you renewed last fall, your "year" will be issues 20, 21, 22, and 23, which might span 18 months.<p>(If a one-year subscription meant a calendar year, it'd be too easy to fencepost you out of 1/4 of your subscription<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>



<h2>Long live TPJ</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/montesquieu/">montesquieu</a> on 2001-04-12T02:44:14</h3>
So, tpj wasn't dead. It was just pining for the fjords.
<br>
<br>Great news. Congrats!
<br>



<h2>The long winter</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/bhilton/">bhilton</a> on 2001-04-12T15:17:39</h3>
<i>"It's been a very long winter, full of angst and attorneys."</i>
<p>
Where attorneys go, angst is sure to follow.</p>

Too true. The problem is, when you need 'em, you NEED 'em.



<h2>The long dark teatime...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/hanamaki/">hanamaki</a> on 2001-04-12T19:01:39</h3>
Many thanks to Jon Orwant for his effort to get TPJ back. Another long dark teatime of the soul seems to end... .
<br>I could survive by reading old articles which were available on the web, but damm -- I need dead trees.
<br>
<br>Thanks again!
<br>
<br>Andreas Marcel
