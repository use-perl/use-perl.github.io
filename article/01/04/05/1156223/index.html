<p>KM writes <em>"Tonight I was watching <a href="http://www.thescreensavers.com/">The Screen Savers</a> on <a href="http://www.techtv.com/">TechTV</a> when they were interviewing the guy who edits <a href="http://www.usethesource.com/">UseTheSource.com</a>. That site uses <a href="http://slashcode.com/">Slashcode</a>, so they mentioned Slashcode, a bit about Perl (mainly that Slashcode is done in Perl and you should know a little Perl to set it up), and Apache/mod_perl. A few minutes later the host was talking about message boards, and one that was written in Perl. He said, &quot;You can write these in C, PHP or the like but Perl is very popular for CGI&quot; So, maybe this isn't too exciting, but I had never heard anyone discuss (or even mention) Perl on TV before."</em>

<p>Hey, cool.  Of course, this site uses Slash, too.  And Perl has been mentioned on TV plenty of times, especially on TechTV.  It has been mentioned on TechTV (including a previous occasion where Slash was mentioned, in a story about <a href="http://www.plastic.com/">Plastic.com</a>), and it has been on other programs on that channel.

</p><p>And then there was my personal favorite mention of Perl on TV, on <a href="http://www.comedycentral.com/sportsnight/">Sports Night</a> (a sitcom/drama formerly on ABC, now in reruns on Comedy Central), in an episode where the resident geek on the show, Jeremy, rigged an online sports poll, and said, <a href="http://mfile.akamai.com/2597/rm/comcent.download.akamai.com/2597/sports/126.ram"> <em>"We're going to telnet into the network mainframe and FTP a perl script right through a DK trap door into the CGI server."</em> </a>  I don't know what it means, but it sure sounds cool<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...</p></p>

As if anyone <i>WE</i> know would do such a thing.;-)

<p>Yeah, <a href="http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/baseball/mlb/news/1999/07/07/hacker_votes/" title="cnn.com">where</a cnn.com> could the <i>Sports Night</i> writers possibly have gotten the idea? </p>
