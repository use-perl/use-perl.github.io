<h2>What about the San Diego Perl Mongers?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/$Bob/">$Bob</a> on 2001-04-09T19:41:14</h3>
Has anyone contacted the San Diego Perl Mongers about helping out in the conference?  Several of the members have expressed interest in helping out but none of the conference organizer's I've contact has expressed interest in having us help out.



<h2>Journal slashbox?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/acme/">acme</a> on 2001-04-10T14:04:18</h3>
Excellent! It would be useful to have a "recent journal entires" slashbox, otherwise I don't really see how we're going to keep up with these...

For most of the conference, we actually don't need help (but thanks for the kind offer!).  I discussed the SD.pm offer with the conference
<br>folks, and I believe the plan was to direct your efforts toward getting the word out to local companies.  If nobody's been contacted about that, I'll go electrocute someone now<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)
<br>
<br>The other place we might need help is session chairs.  Anyone who's going to be going to the conference and wants to help out can moderate a session.  All you do is turn up early, meet the speakers (making sure they're there), introduce the speakers, and keep them to time.  It can put a cramp in your style because you can't jump from room to room during the session you're moderating, but it's still a fun way to meet the speakers and get involved.
<br>
<br>So drop me a line in email (gnat@oreilly.com) and let me know whether anyone got back to you.  If you and anyone else wants to moderate a session, also feel free to send me mail.
<br>
<br>Thanks, and sorry if we blew it!

If you click on "Journals" you have a "friends" list.  You can also click "Top 10" there, which lists the most recent entries.

<br>
<br>There's just something distressing about seeing a big heading for "Silver's Friends" followed by... nothing.  Heh.</p><p>
