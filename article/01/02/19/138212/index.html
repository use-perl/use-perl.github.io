<p>An anonymous user asks, <i>"What's happening to the perl sites? First perlmonth sits unattended for months and now perl.org points to perl.com..."</i>

<p>I dunno, I haven't really heard anything about either site.  A bunch of other pm.org/perl.org sites, including news.perl.org, are down too.  Does anyone out there know the scoop?</p></p>

<h2>perl.org problems.</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/hfb/">hfb</a> on 2001-02-19T18:38:47</h3>
<p>brian d foy and the PM have generously hosted www.perl.org and www.pm.org for some time, however, due to a change of employer, that will no longer be the case. We had the www.perl.org point to perl.com for the moment so that people would get a Perl related site until something agreeable could be worked out since brian was out of town when the trouble began. </p>

<p>The resolution to this has been mostly worked out at this time as follows;</p>
<ul>
<li>Ask Bjorn Hansen will be hosting www.perl.org and all of its content</li>
<li>Wayne Walker will be hosting www.pm.org and all of the mailing lists</li>
<li>hfb will host CPANTS</li>
</ul>

<p>This is a nice division since Ask already hosts all of the perl.org mailing lists and Wayne has been the SA for pm.org for a while. DNS shouldn't be interrupted during the move.</p>

<p>The pm.org box may be a few days on coming back in service since it is being physically shipped to Wayne in Texas though I do believe he may have the content up and running in the interim on another system he has.</p>

<p>I urge everyone to thank brian d foy, Kurt Starsinic, Ask Bjorn Hansen, Wayne Walker and Ben Hockenhull for working together to get this issue resolved so quickly</p>
