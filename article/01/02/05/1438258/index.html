<div class="span8">
<p>XML-RPC.  SOAP.  CORBA.  Buzzwords galore, but possibly useful ones: this is, essentially, technology that allows you to use web sites as a big API.  Below we have an article about XML-RPC; you might also want to check out an article by Paul Kulchenko on <a href="http://www.perl.com/">www.perl.com</a>, "<a href="http://www.perl.com/pub/2001/01/soap.html">Quick Start with SOAP</a>".</p>
<p><h1> Web Services Are More Than HTTP</h1>
<p>One of Perl's enduring strengths is in allowing the programmer to
easily manipulate UNIX system resources, like<nobr> <wbr></nobr><code>/etc/passwd</code> files,
<code>syslog</code> and the filesystem. Perl is also a great tool for building
network applications (for more on this, see Lincoln Stein's excellent
<a href="http://www.awlonline.com/product/0,2627,0201615711,00.html">Network Programming with Perl</a>). As Nathan Torkington pointed out at
YAPC 19100, the Perl community hasn't yet fully embraced a component
model of programming. Components are libraries that can be used by
programs written in any language. If you've dealt with Windows
programming particularly ASP coding, you are probably familiar
with COM objects already. But COM is just one vendor's implementation of
components. <a href="http://udell.roninhouse.com/">Jon Udell</a> argues that
web applications can be used in a component fashion. How many
of you have stolen the HTML from your favorite search engine's FORM
and pasted it into your homepage?
(I hope I'm not the only one raising my hand!)
</p><p>Although LWP is a powerful tool for "page scraping", you probably
don't want to be parsing HTML every time you make an object call.
Fortunately, others have been working on this problem. XML-RPC is
a protocol for Remote Procedure Calls whose conversation over TCP
port 80 is encoded into XML. There are XML-RPC implementations
written in many languages for many platforms, including Perl.
</p><p>Every XML-RPC application must have two parts, but there's a third
that ought to be required. If your script is making an XML-RPC
request to some web service, you are making <b>client</b> calls. If your
script is answering XML-RPC requests, it is a <b>listener</b>. This
seems to describe a typical client-server system; what could be
the third piece? Because XML-RPC is language and platform neutral,
it is essential that the listener's API be adequately documented.
Listing what procedures are expecting for input and the datatypes
of the return values is a necessity when dealing with sub-Perl
languages, like Microsoft's VBScript.
</p><p>The XML-RPC protocol is a call and response system, very much
akin to HTTP. One consequence of this is that XML-RPC doesn't
support transactions or maintaining state. Another problem is
the conversation between listener and client is in clear-text.
Despite these limitations, there are still a number of applications
for which XML-RPC is well suited.
<h1> Building a Client</h1>
</p><p>The first quandary the novice XML-RPC Perl programmer will encounter
is the name of the module. <a href="http://bitsko.slc.ut.us/user/ken/">Ken MacLeod</a>'s
implementation is called <code>Frontier::RPC</code>, because XML-RPC was the
brain child of UserLand's
Dave Winer, also of <a href="http://frontier.userland.com/">Frontier</a>
Naming issues aside, you can find this module on your local CPAN.
Installation follows the normal
<code>"perl Makefile.PL &amp;&amp; make test &amp;&amp; make install"</code> cycle.
</p><p>Let's assume there's an existing XML-RPC service you want to
talk to. It defines the following API:
</p><p> <table border="0"> <tr bgcolor="#DDDDDD"> <td> <pre>
Procedure Name | Input    | Output
-------------------------------------
hello_world    | &lt;STRING&gt; | &lt;STRING&gt;
-------------------------------------
sum            | &lt;INT&gt;,   |
               | &lt;INT&gt;    | &lt;INT&gt;
--------------------------------------
</pre> </td> </tr>
<tr> <th>Figure 1<th> </tr> </table> </p><p>Remember, XML-RPC is designed to be language neutral. Every
language's implementation of XML-RPC translates the RPC
into an XML description that tags
each argument with a specific XML-RPC datatype. Although Perl's
DWIM-FU is strong, other languages are strongly typed and need
this additional information. When the listener responds,
<code>Frontier::RPC</code> translates the XML back into Perl datatypes.
</p><p>Besides the API, we need to know the URL of the listener. For this
example, we will use an NT machine on my private network.
</p><p>Enough yakkin'. Here's a simple test of this web service.
</p><p> <table border="0"> <tr bgcolor="#DDDDDD"> <td> <pre>
     1	#!/usr/bin/perl --
     2
     3	use strict;
     4	use Frontier::Client;
     5
     6	my $rps = Frontier::Client-&gt;new(
     7		   url =&gt; "http://durgan.daisypark.net/jjohn/rpc_simple.asp",
     8					);
     9
    10	print "Calling hello_world()\n";
    11	eval { print $rps-&gt;call("hello_world", "jjohn"), "\n" };
    12
    13	print "\n=-----------------=\n";
    14	print "Calling sum()\n";
    15	eval { print $rps-&gt;call("sum", "1024", "128"), "\n" };
    16
    17	print "\ndone\n";

</pre> </td> </tr>
<tr> <th>Figure 2<th> </tr> </table> </p><p>After including the library, we instantiate a new <code>Frontier::Client</code>
object by passing the URL of the web service. We can now make our
RPC by using the <code>call()</code> method, which expects the name of the remote
procedure followed by a list of its arguments. If all goes well, <code>call()</code>
converts the return value of the procedure into a normal Perl datatype.
Why am I wrapping the method calls in <code>eval</code>s? According to the XML
spec, an XML parser is supposed to halt as soon as it finds a parsing
error. Since <code>Frontier::RPC</code> is encoding and decoding XML, this is a
precaution. Sometimes, bad things happen to good network packets.
</p><p>The output looks like this:
<table border="0"> <tr bgcolor="#DDDDDD"> <td> <pre>
[jjohn@marian xmlrpc]$<nobr> <wbr></nobr>./test_simple
Calling hello_world()
Hello, jjohn

=-----------------=
Calling sum()

done
</pre> </td> </tr>
<tr> <th>Figure 3<th> </tr> </table> </p><p>Sure, strings and numbers are useful but Real Functions &#153; use collection
types like arrays and dictionaries. XML-RPC can handle those datatypes
as well.
</p><p>Here's an example of a procedure that returns an array of hashes.
It is getting all the records from an Access database stored on the
aforementioend NT system. Notice that we are talking to a different
XML-RPC listener now.
</p><p> <table border="0"> <tr bgcolor="#DDDDDD"> <td> <pre>
     1	#!/usr/bin/perl --
     2
     3	use strict;
     4	use Frontier::Client;
     5	use Data::Dumper;
     6
     7	my $rps = Frontier::Client-&gt;new(
     8		 url =&gt; "http://durgan.daisypark.net/jjohn/rpc_addresses.asp",
     9					);
    10
    11	print "\nCalling dump_address_book()\n";
    12
    13	eval { my $aref = $rps-&gt;call("dump_address_book");
    14	       print Dumper($aref);
    15	     };
    16
    17	print "\ndone\n";
</pre> </td> </tr>
<tr> <th>Figure 4<th> </tr> </table> </p><p>All the usual <code>Frontier::RPC</code> suspects are here. This time, we
are explicitly assigning the <code>call</code> method's return value. A
collection type is always returned as a reference by this library.
We can use this reference as we would an normal Perl variable, but
<code>Data::Dumper</code> is a simple way to verify that the call succeed.
For the record, here's a pared down version of the output.
</p><p> <table border="0"> <tr bgcolor="#DDDDDD"> <td> <pre>
[jjohn@marian xmlrpc]$<nobr> <wbr></nobr>./use_perl_taddrs

Calling dump_address_book()
$VAR1 = [
          {
            'email' =&gt; 'mc@nowhere.com',
            'firstname' =&gt; 'Macky',
            'phone' =&gt; '999 555 1234',
            'lastname' =&gt; 'McCormack'
          },
          {
            'email' =&gt; 'jjohn@cs.umb.edu',
            'firstname' =&gt; 'Joe',
            'phone' =&gt; 'no way, dude!',
            'lastname' =&gt; 'Johnston'
          }
        ];
done

</pre> </td> </tr>
<tr> <th>Figure 5<th> </tr> </table> <h1> Building a Listener</h1>
</p><p>For those system administrators out there who want to build a
monitoring system for the health of each machine on their network,
installing simple XML-RPC listeners on each machine is one easy way
to collect system statistics. Here is the code for a listener that
returns a structure (really a hash) that is a snapshot of the current
system health.
</p><p> <table border="0"> <tr bgcolor="#DDDDDD"> <td> <pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl --
use strict;
use Frontier::Daemon;

Frontier::Daemon-&gt;new( methods =&gt; {
				   status =&gt; sub {
				                   return {
						     uptime =&gt;
						        (join "&lt;BR&gt;",`uptime`),
						     df     =&gt;
							(join "&lt;BR&gt;", `df`),
							  };
				                 },
                                  },
		       LocalPort =&gt; 80,
		       LocalAddr =&gt; 'edith.daisypark.net',
		     );
</pre> </td> </tr>
<tr> <th>Figure 6<th> </tr> </table> </p><p>The <code>Frontier::Daemon</code> class is a sub-class of HTTP::Daemon. The <code>new</code>
method doesn't return; it waits to service requests. Because
<code>HTTP::Daemon</code> is a sub-class of <code>IO::Socket::INET</code>, we can control
the TCP port and address to which this server will bind
(ain't Object Orient Programming grand?). The
procedures that XML-RPC clients can call are contained in the hash
pointed to by the <code>methods</code> parameter. The keys of this hash
are the names of the procedures that clients call. The
values of this hash are references to subroutines that implement
the given procedure. Here, there is only one procedure that our service
provides, <code>status</code>. To reduce the display burden on the clients,
I'm converting newlines into HTML &lt;BR&gt; tags. Here's a screenshot
of an ASP page that is making XML-RPC calls to two machines running
this monitoring service.

<h1> Documenting Your API</h1>
<p>Like the weather, everyone talks about documentation but no one
ever does anything about it. Without documenting the API to your
XML-RPC web service, no one will be able to take advantage of it.
There is no official way to "discover" the procedures that a
web service offers, so I recommend a simple web page that lists
the procedure names, the XML-RPC datatypes expected for input and
the XML-RPC datatypes that are returned. Something like <b>Figure 1</b>
is good a minimum. Of course, it might be nice to explain what those
procedures do. POD is very amenable to this purpose.
<h1> Links to More Information</h1>
</p><p>XML-RPC is a great tool for creating platform independent, network
application gateways. Its simplicity is its strength. For more
information on XML-RPC, check out the homepage at <a href="http://www.xmlrpc.com/">www.xmlrpc.com</a>
or wait for the O'Reilly book
Programming Web Applications with XML-RPC, due out this summer.</p></p>
