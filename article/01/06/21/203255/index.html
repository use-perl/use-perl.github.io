<p>Over at <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=01/06/21/1810258">Slashdot</a> is the story of how <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/">Microsoft</a> has a <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdn-files/027/001/516/eula_mit.htm">user license</a> for is Microsoft Mobile Internet Toolkit SDK that restricts mixing that code with Open Source code, even in just using some tools in developing with the SDK.  One of the licenses mentioned as software that cannot be distributed with their software is the Artistic License, along with the GPL and others.

<p>What does this mean for Perl, if anything?  Does it restrict <a href="http://www.activestate.com/">ActiveState</a> from writing Perl interfaces to the software?</p></p>

<h2>I think you've missunderstood</h2>

&lt;sarcasm&gt;
<br>
<br>You see, it's the open source software that restricts what you can and can't do with your source. Remembmer: "GPL is Bad". So, the only potential problem with this licensing scheme is for folks with GPL and Artisitic licenses. If they didn't have those anti-IP licenses they wouldn't be in that pickle, now would they?
<br>
<br>The proper solution is for perl to move away from these anit-IP licenses. Future releases of perl should be closed source. Usage should be subscription based with fees going to the pumpking (to be distributed among p5p at his discression). Neither source nor binary may be modified, distributed, or included in any other projects. CPAN should institute a micropayment system, where downloads will result in proper payment to authors. Modules will need to be re-downloaded periodically to ensure that licenses are kept current.
<br>
<br>Perl the tool and perl the culture will both be better for this change, and not only that, but perl will no longer have any conflict with the Mobile Internet Toolkit SDK terms. Everyone will be happy.
<br>

<br>
<br>when the preliminary anti-trust hearings/discussions were on in the congress and everyone was generally agreed that microsoft was an evil monopoly, someone asked for a show of hands of those who owned an operating system besides windows. none was raised in a room of several hundred representatives and various staff.
<br>
<br>this was supposed to be proof of the monopoly. it was only proof of the idiocy and hypocrisy of the market that makes microsoft rich (instead of buying or finding alternative software--many of us have owned nothing but macs or *nix boxes for the last two decades) but condemns them for it.
<br>
<br>microsoft's back is to the wall in some serious ways and they understand better than most of us. the anti-trust suit isn't a problem. they'll split if they must and get bigger and richer, just like at&amp;t and the bells, and re-merge in 2023; if they're around. they might not be.
<br>
<br>the web got out of control before they could get a stick in the spokes. bsd, linux, and cousins (and the human ability to use/love something more complex than an auto-turd of a gui) similarly came out of nowhere (if you mark redmond, wa as they do--the only "somewhere").
<br>
<br>c++, perl, python, ruby, mysql, postgres, java, apache... and the response is vb.net, asp, and c#? it would be laughable if microsoft (and aol and others) hadn't already proven countless times that it *is* possible to sell second-rate, buggy, bloated, insecure, lowest-common-denominator, self-marketing floaters to americans (and by extension, the world). why won't this thing flush?
<br>
<br>they've lost, for the next few years at least, the battle to franchise the www. they haven't lost the developers entirely, yet. most of the best software in the world is now free. they've gotta be peeing in their chinos.
<br>
<br>_of_course_ they're going to seek ways to undermine or co-license anything opensource. look at redhat and activestate. anything good and free is a goldmine. if they get their skeevy fingers in the cracks (so to speak) they'll pry it all open, slowly but surely, till the time comes when you can't pay anyone to be a pumpking b/c they'll have options and a vp on their door down seattle way.
<br>
<br>well, that might be raving paranoia but imagine if you could go back to 1975 and tell the kids at xparc what the next 20 years would bring them. would they soberly listen and respond, "my, god. you're right. we must take action!" or would they have tossed you out on your rear to look for a programming job in some town that hadn't heard of your madness, like albuquerque.
<br>
<br>the solution? don't take microsoft to court; that's twice as weasely. just don't give them your money; that's a free choice. ride your info-tech managers at your workplace to go *nix (like you never have before, like a jihad, like a virgin). see through the propaganda and admit that a motorola chip at 500 megahertz *does* do all computations faster than an intel at 750; make others see. buy that dual g4 mac not just b/c it's moral but b/c it's a better computer and it's bsd under there.
<br>
<br>do it while it's easy. every one of us that does makes it easier for the next.
<br>
<br>anyway, too much coffee. forgive our neighbors typos as they forgive... oh, and while i'm on a crusade. it's gigabyte with a "J" sound. learn some latin why don't you?
<br>

<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Visual Studio.Net software product, on the Visual Studio.NET
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Start page, in the Web Hosting Section. The Approved Hoster may
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; require a separate hosting agreement with the Recipient and
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Microsoft disclaims all liability related to any agreements or
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; services provided by the Approved Hoster. In addition,
<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; delivered to Recipient by Microsoft shall be subject to this
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Agreement); (iii) that Recipient is solely responsible for
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; updating its customers with versions of Applications that
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; operate satisfactorily with the final commercially released
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; version of the Software; (iv) not to use Microsoft's name,
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; logo, or trademarks to market the Application, provided
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; however, that any Application that includes the Device Adapter
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Code or any derivatives thereof must include a clear statement
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; indicating that such Application is based upon the Microsoft
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Mobile Internet Toolkit; (v) to include a valid copyright
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; notice on the Applications in Recipient's name; (vi) to
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; indemnify and hold harmless Microsoft from and against any
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; claims or lawsuits, including attorneys' fees, that arise from
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; or result from the use or deployment of the Application; (vii)
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to otherwise comply with the terms of this EULA; and
<br>(c) that Microsoft reserves all rights not expressly granted.
<br>
&nbsp; 4. TERM OF AGREEMENT. The term of this Agreement shall commence on
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the date accepted by Recipient and shall continue until
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; terminated by Microsoft in writing at any time, with or without
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; cause. This Agreement will terminate without notice upon the
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; earlier of (i) commercial release of the Software or (ii) one
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; year after the last date Recipient receives the Software or any
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Update thereto, unless terminated earlier by Microsoft. Upon the
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; termination of this Agreement (or upon request by Microsoft),
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Recipient shall promptly return to Microsoft, or certify
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; destruction of, all full or partial copies of the Software
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; provided by Microsoft. The following Sections shall survive
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; termination or expiration of this Agreement: Sections 2, 7, 8,
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 9, 10 and 11.

<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; provide any support with respect to the Applications. However,
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Microsoft may, in its sole discretion, provide further
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; pre-release versions, technical support, updates and/or
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; supplements of the Software and/or related information
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ("Updates") to Recipient hereunder, in which case such Updates
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; shall also be deemed to be included in the "Software" and
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; therefore governed by this Agreement, unless other terms of use
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; are provided by Microsoft with such Updates. In no event shall
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Microsoft be obligated to provide Recipient a copy of the
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; commercial release version of the Software in connection with
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Recipient's participation in the testing program. Microsoft is
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; not obligated to make the Software commercially available.

Is something like this really new?
<p>
If I write an app in Visual C++, and link it to the Microsoft Foundation Class library I can't redistribute the code in the MFC library.
</p><p>
Microsoft has a Knowledge Base article on this:
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/Q108/1/92.asp" title="microsoft.com">Q108192</a microsoft.com>
</p><p>
Now as far as GPL being viral, if you want to see viral install an NT server on your network -- from that point forward everything that connects to it better be microsoft your you'll have to fight with it to get it to work.

<p>&lt;pedantry&gt;"Giga" comes from Greek, not Latin, and the pronunciation of Latin <i>g</i> before <i>i</i> depends on what era of Latin you're speaking anyway. You're right that it's "j" in ecclesiastical Latin, but real pedants use classical.&lt;/pedantry&gt;</p>
