<p>The good news: the <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/perlcdbs2/">Perl CD Bookshelf, Version 2.0</a> seems to work just fine under Mac OS, even the Java-based search, so I can carry several good Perl books in my bag without taking up much room.  A Very Good Thing.  And it is more useful to me than the previous edition, with the addition of Perl for System Administration instead of Learning Perl (of course, YMMV).

<p>The bad news: whereas the search on the old version worked fine on Unix and had trouble on Mac OS, the new version doesn't work on Unix.  At least, I can't get it to.  It looks for a file "FieldedSearchApplet.class", but the file on the CD is "fieldedsearchapplet.class".  So it looks like the case is broken on the files, and it will only work on case-insensitive machines.  Maybe I did something wrong.  If so, somebody please fix me.

</p><p> <b>Update: 06/19 15:19 PM GMT</b> by <b> <a href="http://pudge.net/">P</a> </b>: Finally got the case problem figured out (read more to see the solution).  Now the only problem with the CD is that I like hard copy books better than soft copies.  But those won't fit on my hard drive.</p></p>

I found all six instances of "fieldedsearchapplet.class" (after copying the CD to my hard disk) and did `ln -s fieldedsearchapplet.class FieldedSearchApplet.class`, and it seems to work.  I wonder if some of the other files have case problems too, though.



<h2>Great buy!</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/wickline/">wickline</a> on 2001-06-18T20:28:50</h3>
I snagged mine for $60 canadian (that's about half price) at the YAPC auction.
<br>
<br>Best book buy I've every made.... and then my boss said to go ahead and expense it! Yippie!
<br>
<br>I think the only change I'd make if I were ora.com would be to replace the panther (a bit aged now) with either Friedl's book (aged, but still a killer reference) or the DBI book (very wide apeal, IMO)... or maybe some other perl book to be forthcomming from O'Reilly before the CD Bookshelf 3rd edition hits the burners.
<br>
<br>Guess I'd best send that comment to ora as well (even though I suspect gnat's reading this) to be sure it goes through the proper channels...

You will probably find that the case of file
<br>systems on CDs varies between Unix flavors.
<br>Some (commercial) Unixes will mount an ISO 9660 filesystem and render everything in UPPERCASE,
<br>some in MixedPreservedCase (ideal), while still others in all_lower_case.  It may also depend on which version of the OS and/or patchlevel that you are at.  HTH.

Yeah, I tried various things and couldn't get it to work.  I noticed on Mac OS it was in mixed case, but it was all lower on Linux (Red Hat 6.x).
<br>
<br>But I finally figured it out:
<br>
<br> <tt>mount -tiso9660 -o check=r<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/dev/cdrom<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/mnt/cdrom</tt>
<br>
<br>That works for me.  Now the filesystem is case-insensitive.  Yay!

I suspect Friedl's book will make 3.0.. he's working on a new version as we speak. (and since it's always been an on-again-off-again, I'm going to mention it so its "out there" and he can't delay getting to it again).<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
<br>
<br>But seriously, I know he's doing MRE2, so probably when it comes out, ORA might consider it (although MRE is relevant to other non-perl languages as well....)

<h2>Why Learning Perl wasn't on this CD</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/merlyn/">merlyn</a> on 2001-06-22T04:25:58</h3>
Learning Perl 2ed was on its last legs, and Learning Perl 3ed wasn't ready in time for press.
<p>
Otherwise, it would have been on there, I was assured.  Durn, missed it by <i>that</i> much. {grin}</p>



<h2>Mac OS X?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/kevin/">kevin</a> on 2001-06-25T03:14:32</h3>
Anyone got the search part to work under Mac OS X?  Java is disabled by default in IE 5.1, but even after enabling it the app still pukes.<br/><br/>I tried using the applet launcher to launch outside of a web browser but not sure I picked the right applet (nothing happened when I launched it)<br/><br/>Kevin
