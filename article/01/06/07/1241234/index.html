Well, download and try it. Buy it only if one of the free and open source solutions don't fit your needs<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p></p>

<h2>Thanks for reminding us its not Open-Source</h2>

<p> <i>Well, download and try it. Buy it only if one of the free and open source solutions don't fit your needs<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</i> </p>

<p>Or, if you want to help us all, download it, try it, and write something better that is free.</p>



<h2>What about Perl (and mod_perl)?</h2>

Has anyone actually <i>verified</i> this information?  I mean; trying to beat the combination of Apache, Perl and mod_perl when it comes to speed is <i>hard</i>.  I've tried previous versions of Velocigen, and no way they out-performed the three <i>free</i> software solutions mentioned above.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br><br/><br/><br/><br/><br>I think I'll stick to Apache for quite a while yet.  I might have a look at TUX if I want my web server to deliver <i>static</i> pages fast, though...<br/><br/><br/><br/><br><br/><br/><br/><br/><br>Anyone; please download and test Velocigen (I will), and post your experiences here.



<h2>Re:What about Perl (and mod_perl)?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/c_monster/">c_monster</a> on 2001-06-07T21:51:34</h3>
<p>Just a little clarification:</p>

<p>VelociGen EE doesn't replace Perl or Apache with anything proprietary or closed. It uses Perl 5.6.1 (stock), and it can be installed under Apache. It's not designed to "compete" with either of them.</p>

<p>The big points for using VelociGen are:</p>
<ul>
<li>High performance for any existing Perl CGI, with <b>no changes to the code.</b> Nothing else offers that. That's also where the 60x figure comes in.</li>
<li>Compatibility with Netscape, iPlanet, Zeus, and IIS servers as well as Apache. mod_perl is solely an Apache module, which isn't always an option.</li>
<li>Scalability over multiple servers right out of the box, regardless of server platform.</li>
<li>Most of all, an <b>easy install</b> that Fortune 500 companies love.</li>
</ul>

<p>The point of all this isn't to take away from existing Perl solutions, but to get the word out that Perl is useful for high-transaction Web applications. I'd rather see a company like Ford using Perl than JSP, so I don't mind selling it to them.</p>

<p>As an aside, I'm all for open source, too. I don't make that decision at VelociGen, but I have opened up some of the components we use, like the <a href="http://www.velometer.com/" title="velometer.com">VeloMeter</a velometer.com> load tester and Apache::PSP for Perl Server Pages. I've even posted the entire contents of <a href="http://www.globalspin.com/thebook/" title="globalspin.com">my book on Perl</a globalspin.com> on my Web site. However, not everyone is comfortable with the GPL, so it's best not to throw out something really useful (VGEE) when it has the chance to do some good in the corporate world.</p>

<p>Whew! Somebody shut me up!<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<br>...the baby with the bathwater. There <b>are</b> other licenses, you know, the Artistic/GPL combination being a business-friendly one.

Hi, I am the guy who runs use Perl.
<br>
<br>I hate to try to stifle discussion, but I really hate to see a flamewar over open source licenses, or free vs. commercial, etc. on this site.
<br>
<br>So I suggest we drop the licensing advocacy.  Take it to Slashdot.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)
