<h2>disappointed</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/kellan/">kellan</a> on 2001-03-29T17:00:43</h3>
not sure what i expected, but i didn't find it in this article.  if you've built a perl cgi with dbi before then this series of articles doesn't have much for you. (and if you're still building cgis shame on you)
<p>
the most interesting part of the series is in the second article where the author details getting and installing a free version of Oracle.
</p><p>
if you're still intersted, and don't feel like hunting around linux.com for the first three articles (the story links directly to the fourth), they can be found in the <a href="http://www.linux.com/news.phtml?stream=featured_articles&amp;offset=1" title="linux.com">feature archive</a linux.com>.</p>

I had to go no further than the books they recommended before I became skeptical:
<br>
<br>1)"Teach yourself CGI" (Rafe Colburn) Sams
<br>2)"Programming Perl (3rd. Edition)"
<br>3)"CGI/Perl Cookbook" (Craig Patchett and Matthew Wright).
<br>
<br>One good recommendation out of three.
<br>
<br>I would have probably chosen:
<br>
<br>1) "CGI Programming", 2nd Edition
<br>2) "Programming Perl", 3rd Edition
<br>3) "Programming the Perl" DBI or maybe the "Perl Cookbook" or maybe even "Database Design for Mere Mortals" or some other DB design book.
<br>
<br>Not a bad article in general.
<br>



<h2>Was ok</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/mbadolato/">mbadolato</a> on 2001-03-30T04:34:46</h3>
I've refered some people to those articles over the last few weeks, but... it was because the articles were a very basic introduction.
<br>
<br>There was absolutley nothing of use for anyone who has done even a little of DBI work (save for the Oracle discussion), but for people brand new it was a decent enough intro.
<br>
<br>Though I will say I liked the first couple of articles in the series better than the final couple.
<br>
<br>



<h2>Nasty Perl Code</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/davorg/">davorg</a> on 2001-03-30T13:49:01</h3>
These articles are full of the type of code that gives Perl a bad name. No <tt>-w</tt>, <tt>use strict</tt> or <tt>CGI.pm</tt>. I really wouldn't recommend them to anyone as they'd only pick up bad habits.
<br>

It gets even better. I quote from the article:<br/><br/><blockquote><div>
Recommended Books:
[...]
"CGI/Perl Cookbook" (Craig Patchett and Matthew  Wright). I've heard about this book but I haven't had a chance to take a look at it. If you do, let us know !!
</div></blockquote><br/><br/>I encourage all to, uh, "let them know", by <a href="mailto:marcelo@linux.com" title="mailto">email</a mailto> and on the <a href="http://www.linux.com/newsitem.phtml?sid=93&amp;aid=11857#comments_post_comment" title="linux.com">comments section</a linux.com>...
