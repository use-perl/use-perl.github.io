sparkling wine made in the German city of Perl.  Dessert was to have
been ice cream made from camel's milk, but some government agency
forbade it because of the possibility of mad cow disease."</em>

<p>Mmmmm, mad cow.</p></p>

Just got back from GPW; it was fantastic. Kudos to the organizers who worked tirelessly to make sure everything ran with german efficiency. Damian's Quantum::Superpositions talk caused people to sprout stupid quantum jokes for the next 24 hours; he and Jon Orwant also did a Perl6 overview; Marc Lehmann enlightened us (amongst other things) about Perl's Unicode handling; Jost Krieger had some constructive criticism about CPAN; and Brian Ingerson's Inline.pm won an award.<br>
<br>
The talks were generally of a high quality with a good mix of german end english talks; but even better was the socializing - enough ideas were floating around to provide hacking fodder for the next few months.<br>
<br>
Well done, everyone, and I'm already looking forward to GPW 2002.
