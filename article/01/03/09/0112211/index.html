I've been looking at building a weblog, and slash/scoop are overkill for me. This seems to be ideal--I like the customization that users can do. I only wish the admin had more customization options (such as themes). I can hack the perl and html, but I'm no artist. <a href="http://phpnuke.org/" title="phpnuke.org">phpNuke</a phpnuke.org> is a good example. It has many themes, and you can even make them user selectable (you have to login to change them).
<p>
Which brings me to another thing. You can't really tell what Metadot can do from browsing the site without logging in, and that's not clear. It would benefit potential users if there was an easily accessible feature tour with screenshots.

If you think Slash is overkill, you should check out <a href="http://slashcode.com/" title="slashcode.com">Slash</a slashcode.com> again soon.  We are just about finished with 2.0 (the site is running the 2.0 beta code), and it is far more stable, customizable, easier to install, extensible, etc. ad nauseum.  An almost complete rewrite.  It's going to take over the world!

Yeah, you're paid to say that.  I'll bet it's

I was going to retort with something about how you suck at picking XFL games, but<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... that might be something to be proud of.

<br>Geez.
<br>
<br>That sounds like something the <a href="http://tmtowtdi.perl.org/user/ask/buzz" title="perl.org">buzz generator</a perl.org> came up with.

I am unfortunate enough to work at a company that uses Metadot. It is hands-down the worst product I have ever had to support. When you are personally acquainted with how bad the code is (Google Code Search has it), the above buzzword nonsense becomes even more risible.
