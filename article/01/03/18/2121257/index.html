<p>use Perl is soon moving to <a href="http://slashcode.com/">Slash</a> 2.0, the new version of the software the site runs on (it currently runs Slash 1.0.9, the latest release).  In preparation for the move, you can check out <a href="http://beta.use.perl.org/">the beta site</a>, and describe your experiences here.

<p>

Also, <a href="http://news.perl.org/">Perl News</a> is going away soon (one might argue it already has<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:). <a href="http://use.perl.org/">use Perl</a> is that site's sister site, having all the same news, plus reviews, articles, discussions, and more. The coincidence of the recent technical difficulties of Perl News and the imminent migration of use Perl to its new home makes now a good time to finalize the merging of the two sites.

</p><p>

We'll be modifying Slash to send out the complete text of new stories every evening, so this will be done automatically instead of now, where it's sent out manually.  More news on that when it is ready, but until then, there won't be mailings again.  It should be ready in a week or two.

</p><p>

Over the next few weeks, please let us know of any problems you're having with the new site, and we'll try to take care of them so we can have a smooth transition.</p></p>

When I first went the beta site, the stories
column was very narrow, but when I logged in,
it got better.  And are these lefthand boxes
even really needed?  Seems fine with the
FAQ/About/Submit/etc links being across the
top of the page, as it is right now.
</p>



<h2>It doesn't validate!</h2>

I fed <b>&lt;beta.use.perl.org&gt;</b> to the wolves - No, sorry! - to the HTML validator at <b>&lt;http://validator.w3.org/&gt;</b>, and the result was not pretty, not pretty at all. Something like a zillion errors.
</p>

<p>Try it yourself:<br>
<a href="http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fbeta.use.perl.org%2F" title="w3.org">http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fbet a.use.perl.org%2F</a w3.org>.
</p>

<p>
Maybe I should try the wolves after all... or maby the pigs...

The layout is not complete.  I have done exactly zero customization to the beta site; all I did was copy a dozen files and convert the database.  The lefthand boxes will be removed from the final version, and the top image size will be fixed, etc.



<h2>Re:It doesn't validate!</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/pudge/">pudge</a> on 2001-03-19T03:13:21</h3>
Neither does this site.

<p>

If properly motivated, the new site will <em>eventually</em> become valid HTML, but it is a fairly low priority for me.</p>



<h2>Complete text of stories</h2>

Pudge,

 <p> <i>&gt; We'll be modifying Slash to send out the complete text of new stories every evening</i> </p>

<p>I am very interested in this feature and I also made a <a href="http://www.sevenseas.org/user/alessio/slash/" title="sevenseas.org">patch for 1.0.9</a sevenseas.org>. Please let me know.</p>



<h2>Re:Complete text of stories</h2>

Thanks; I'll have a look at your patch.  I envision I will roll it in to dailyStuff, and offer THREE preferences for Daily Mailings instead of the current TWO.  So users can select to have nothing, just headlines, or full text every night.  Of course, admins of sites would be able to disable the latter, if they don't want full text mailed every night.

<p>

I have two patches planned for the next two weeks; that is one of them.  The other is a patch to allow pseudo-HTML tags, like [CODE] and [REPLY], in a post.  I might not get around to that one right now, though.</p>
