<h2>AxKit</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/zehrer/">zehrer</a> on 2001-08-23T07:44:21</h3>
It's part of the Apache-Project now.



<h2>Eeek!</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Matts/">Matts</a> on 2001-08-23T08:11:36</h3>
Yes, I'm moving. Actually I've moved (to <a href="/journal.pl?op=display&amp;uid=1087" title="perl.org">The house from hell</a perl.org>). The site was hosted on a 64k leased line at my last house.
<br>
<br>The intention is to get a DSL line (increasing outgoing bandwidth to 256K), since Gloucester is DSL enabled. I suspect I'll probably be told my house doesn't have sufficient signal strenght or something for DSL, but I'll find out in about "20 working days".
<br>
<br>Meanwhile, I wanted to get everything transfered over to the ASF (Apache Software Foundation), but they require everyone who has ever contributed code to sign a waver, and so getting those people to do that and fax it in has proved a pain, and slower than I had hoped for. Once that's done though, I suspect axkit.org will be a redirector to something like xml.apache.org/axkit.
<br>
<br>But don't fret - AxKit is alive and well. Kip Hampton has stashed away a copy of the CVS archives in case my server won't restart, and he's also hosting the downloads for anyone who wants the latest beta (still 1.4_82). But use CPAN if you just want the current stable release.
<br>
<br>Any questions, I have work email at msergeant@star.net.uk. There's also an AxKit IRC channel which I'm on daily at irc.openprojects.net/#axkit
