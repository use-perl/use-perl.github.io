Is it possible to use Perl to manipulate the Windows 2000 Active Directory?"</em>

<h2>All AD can be manipulated via WSH</h2>

All of the Active Directory API is available to a script running unders Windows Scripting Host, including perl scripts.<br/><br/>So yes, you can manipulate AD via perl, assuming your perl is running on a W2K box.



<h2>Not difficult at all</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Bryan_Casto/">Bryan_Casto</a> on 2001-10-27T16:58:41</h3>
If you're running the scripts from Win32 platforms, you can use Win32::OLE to interface to AD.  Check out Perl for System Administrators from O'Reilly.  We do this all the time to create and query user accounts in AD.

Whilst currently I have no need to do this kind of thing - it would nonetheless be nice to see some kind of tutorial on this.  Perhaps one of you guys could write an article for here or perl.com about how you would approach this.

<h2>ADSILDAP Perl Module</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jeremy.brinkman/">jeremy.brinkman</a> on 2004-08-13T12:40:02</h3>
I have created a rudimentary perl module which allows user and group account management through ADSI.  The ADSILDAP module has worked very well for the applications I have written.  It is based on the NT user and group names as opposed to their LDAP distinguished names (although this functionality is also supported).  The program is documented, with samples.<br/><br/>Many of the concepts are derived from other perl programmers in the community, such as Steven Manross who wrote the Win32::Exchange module.<br/><br/>Enough with the rambling, I hope this link helps:

<h2>A sample</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jonnosan/">jonnosan</a> on 2001-10-28T09:58:41</h3>
Here's a sample to get you started:
<p>---------------------
<br>
use Win32::OLE;<br>
use strict;<br>
<br>
my $sysinfo = Win32::OLE-&gt;new('ADSystemInfo') || die ("Can't get sysinfo: ".Win32::OLE-&gt;LastError()."\n");<br>
<br>
my $username=$sysinfo-&gt;{UserName};<br>
print "Username:$username\n";<br>
<br>
my $adsuser = Win32::OLE-&gt;GetObject("LDAP://$username") || die ("Can't find user: ".Win32::OLE-&gt;LastError()."\n");<br>
print "CN: $adsuser-&gt;{cn}\n";<br>
print "Email address: $adsuser-&gt;{EmailAddress}\n";
<br>
---------------------
</p><p>
This first uses the ADSystemInfo object to return the username of the currently logged in user. This is actually in the form of an LDAP path (cn=foo, ou=bar, DC=example, DC=com).<br>
Then it uses GetObject to return a handle to an IADsUser object. This object has a bunch of properties that you can read/write (depending on your permissions).
<br>
Note that the properties are case sensitive in perl, while they are not in vbscript, and most of the documentation about the ADSI interface will have examples in VBscript.
<br>
Here's the same code in VBScript, so you can get a handle of what you need to do to convert betweent perl/vbscript:
</p><p>
---------
<br>
Set oSysInfo = CreateObject("ADSystemInfo")<br>
WScript.echo oSysinfo.username<br>
<br>
Set adsUser = GetObject("LDAP://" &amp; oSysInfo.username)<br>
Wscript.Echo adsUser.cn<br>
Wscript.Echo adsUser.EmailAddress<br>
<br>
---------</p>



<h2>ugly code available</h2>

<br>
<br>This was some code I was monkeying with in an effort to grok ADSI a while back. It doesn't try to write anything, but just lets you nose around the directory structure via cgi. It's not pretty, but maybe you'd find it useful. The comments reference a couple of other resources I used when working on that stuff
