He's talking about the submission queue. On K5, articles that have been submitted are available for review, before they hit the front page. Registered users can vote the article up or down, and offer comments. If the article hits a certain threshold up, it goes into the main site.



<blockquote>

<h2>Re:Look at K5 for a lead...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/pudge/">pudge</a> on 2001-10-18T21:36:39</h3>
Ah.  I don't think that would be too useful at this point; we do not get very many submissions as it is, and the only things we don't post are things I really want not posted (like CGI questions, repeated stories, etc.).
<br>
<br>But this brings up something YOU all can do to make use Perl better: submit stories!  We don't get enough.



<blockquote>

<h2>Re:Look at K5 for a lead...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/gaudior/">gaudior</a> on 2001-10-19T14:19:11</h3>
It's a hard problem. How do you get more submissions? Get more readers, who are interested in participating. How do you do that? Have a lot of new interesting stories.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-/ Catch-22.<p>It's especially hard when there is another thriving perl community, <a href="http://perlmonks.org/" title="perlmonks.org">Perl Monks</a perlmonks.org>. The amount of time and attention available to each of us is limited. We can't be everywhere, with deep attention to each place.</p>



<blockquote>

<h2>Re:Look at K5 for a lead...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/pudge/">pudge</a> on 2001-10-19T14:58:13</h3>
I don't consider use Perl and PerlMonks competing sites.  use Perl is devoted primarily to Perl news and issues, while PerlMonks seems devoted to code issues.  I suppose there's something to be said that the communities themselves overlaps<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... but I never gave much thought to the overlap, and am not sure I should.
<br>
<br>But the issue isn't really getting more readers, it is making the site cater as well as possible to its readers.  There are plenty of regular readers who know of important perl news who simply don't submit it, so it doesn't get posted, and fewer people therefore know about it.  You might notice that Parrot 0.0.2 release was not posted.  Why?  Because no one submitted it, and I am too busy to find all the news and write and post all the stories myself.  If the regular users and readers would submit more, that would go a very long way toward improving the content of the site.
<br>
<br>I might sound like I am complaining, but that is only because I am.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)  I want the site to disseminate to its readers important and interesting Perl news, but I can't do it by myself.

<p>Pudge, I'm doing my part.  I just submitted an ask use Perl; !  But, in so doing, I discovered I had a (piddling small and uninteresting, to be true)  story submission still pending since July 6.  Nowadays, I realize it would be better as a journal entry, but did you realize it was there at all or is there a bug somewhere?</p>

<h2>cpan module corner</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/hfb/">hfb</a> on 2001-10-17T22:54:08</h3>
<p>Well, over a year ago I did try to get some people interested in doing how-tos and genre bits on things like 'Apache::*, has your head spun off your neck yet?' but noone seemed enthused enough to try it for the now dead idea of 'use.cpan.org'...which is why I moved CPAN newsy stuff over here. Maybe some firsthand accounts of modules and the people who love them would be interesting.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) </p>



<h2>Naked Jello Wrestling and Barely Legal Teens</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jjohn/">jjohn</a> on 2001-10-18T02:24:26</h3>
<p>Adding more adult content to this site will really help drive eyeballs here. You could then relaunch the site as "PerlAfterDark.com" and charge for content like those bastards at salon.com.

</p><p>I think the journals have been a really great feature to use.perl.org. In fact, I read them a lot. Do people really want yet another tech article site? Do they want to see interviews? Comedy? I like the site the way it is, but then I don't have a day job.</p>



<h2>More</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/belg4mit/">belg4mit</a> on 2001-10-18T02:51:15</h3>
That's all I would do to "change" the site/
<br>I want more!
<br>
<br>I read some of the articles those that interest me), so if there are more articles it stands to chance that there'll be more I read.
<br>
<br>I checkout a lot of the new modules;
<br>I suppose you have no control over
<br>how much new material people write;
<br>but it might be interesting to say
<br>have a daily link to some random
<br>pre-existing module (ignoring multiple
<br>versions and splicing out
<br>those that are in CPAN Uploads)
<br>
<br>Humor and some kind of comic could
<br>be interesting but not really necessary
<br>(the quotes are good humor, and we don't need more links to penny-arcade etc.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)

More humor and more modules... why not stories about the funny module of the day ? There are plenty of them on CPAN, sometimes doing something funny with the language, sometimes just plain funny (the <a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?mode=module&amp;query=Acme" title="cpan.org">Acme::</a cpan.org> hierarchy, some of <a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?mode=author&amp;query=SCHWERN" title="cpan.org">Schwern</a cpan.org>'s modules).

<p>I second the "random module of the day" idea.  It's small, but still a good idea.  I'm always looking for increased knowledge of CPAN, shorting of going through and memorizing the whole thing.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)  It's good to know what's out there.</p>

<p>What if, every seven days, someone wrote a short intro to the most interesting random module of the day to come up in the past week?</p>



<blockquote>

<h2>Re:More</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/belg4mit/">belg4mit</a> on 2001-10-18T18:32:14</h3>
That would work too. I was just thinking of something that would:
<br>a) be less discriminating (you never know what gems someone else might look over)
<br>b) could be fully automated (just periodically fetch the module list from CPAN, remove different versions of the same module, and display the dox of a random selection from the set)

<p>If you can figure out how to make us post more comments, you'll have it made!  That's when Slash works best.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, there's just too many places where Perl programmers go to talk: p5p, usenet, irc, perlmonks.  You have to convince people to come here first.  And that's not only a difficult proposition, it's probably not politically correct.</p>

I am not sure if it matters if users talk much here.  Sometimes, a site is just informational, and that is fine, if people are getting things out of it.  More discussion is welcome, of course.

<h2>favorite code snippets for newbies/ex-newbies?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/xanthos/">xanthos</a> on 2001-10-19T00:55:53</h3>
Everyone knows that there is more than one way to do it, and we all would <i>Love</i> to post that "really cool(tm)" script/module we've been thinking about but don't have time to write.
<br> <br>
But just possibly we do have time to post that bit of code we have to parse the good stuff out of a tcpdump trace, or what is obviously the definitive regex for an ip address.
<br> <br>
Or we could do ourselves and the community a public service and rewrite all of Matt Wright's old scripts. Google shows over 10k refs for wwwboard.pl, 2.7 million for just wwwboard.  People are still using some of this stuff,  security holes and all, because it is free and <i>it is all they can find.</i>
<br> <br>
Any takers?

<h2>Module Authors and Source Forge</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ajm/">ajm</a> on 2001-10-19T15:49:02</h3>
You could try to get some of the module authors to write about their modules.<br/><br/>You could also point to projects on Source Forge that are in Perl or are Perl tools.



<h2>Interviews</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/unixdown/">unixdown</a> on 2001-10-19T16:49:00</h3>
What about the typical Interview.  You know the drill:  1) someone finds a dude willing to participate and posts a story.  2) the readers post and mod questions.  3) 2nd story with the responses.  The only problem I see is that I am a nobody, and couldn't ever get a hold of a good person to interview.



<blockquote>

<h2>Re:Interviews</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/pudge/">pudge</a> on 2001-10-20T16:11:54</h3>
Anyone who wants to write interviews or write about their modules are welcome to approach me.  In case you hadn't noticed, my theme here seems to be "what  you can do to help me, and how I can facilitate you helping me help you help others."  Or something.
<br>
<br>So anyone who wants to write, please contact me<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...
<br>
<br>And don't think you are a nobody.  Nobody is a nobody, and the less you think of yourself as a nobody, the more you actually are a nobody.  Or something.  I certainly don't care who is or isn't a nobody.   If you don't think you can get someone good to be interviewed, A. you are probably wrong, and B. it doesn't hurt to try.
<br>
<br>The point is, if you want to do an interview or an article, and you have decent writing skills, then mail me.
