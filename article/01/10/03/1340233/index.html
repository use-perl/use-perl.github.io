<div class="span8">
<p>One of the cool new enhancements to use Perl (via <a href="http://slashcode.com/">Slash 2.2</a>) is the Message system.  You can sign up to get messages when people reply to you, moderate you, and metamoderate you.  Currently, you can get those messages mailed to you, or provided via the web site.  You can also get the daily news either in headline form as before, or with the text of the articles, mailed to you.

<p>Head over to your <a href="//use.perl.org/messages.pl?op=display_prefs">message preferences</a> to set it up.

</p><p> <b>Update: 10/03 18:29 GMT</b> by <b> <a href="http://pudge.net/">P</a> </b>: Oh, another new feature I forgot to mention was that you can use URLs now like http://use.perl.org/user/gnat/journal/.  Instead of "~user" you can also put "my" for your own page.  In place of "journal" you can also put "discussions" to see what discussions the user has created, and "pubkey" to see his public key.  And without the "journal/" you go to the user's info page, as before.</p></p>

<h2>Mailed Journal Entries</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/2shortplanks/">2shortplanks</a> on 2001-10-03T17:25:06</h3>
Is there anyway that I can get use perl itself to email me the text of journal entries mailed to me when they're filled in rather than just having notification that they're on the website?
<br>



<h2>Again, in english</h2>

Have you ever had one of those days when whatever you say comes out really confusing?   Even when you've hit that Preview button about ten times first.  Let me try again.
<p>
use perl can email me whenever one of my 'friends' submits a journal entry to tell me that this content is on the website.  What I want to know is, can use perl mail me the actual text of the journal entry?  And by this I mean use perl itself, not some extra script that trawls the website (which are out there, and I use, and are very good.)</p>

It is possible<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... but I would be concerned that the users would give permission for their words to be emailed out.  So not only would we have to code the sending, but we would have to code some permission system.  Possible, but not right now.

You're concerned "that the users would give permission for their words to be emailed out". Surely they've given consent for their words to be on a website, and as we all know, whatever is on a website is in full public view and can never be taken away. I don't really see a distinction between the "put on web" "emailed to random people who would have seen it on the web anyway" (apart from driving traffic away from the site and losing banner impressions, of course).
<br>
<br>I use the same script as 2shortplanks and of course it broke when you upgraded use.perl.org recently so I wonder if there's a better solution to the one we currently have. A full SOAP interface to slashcode?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)

Well, *you* might not see a disinction, but I have been around long enough to know there *is* a distinction, and some people (though probably not most of them) care what it is.  Perhaps I am being oversensitive about it, I don't know.  Maybe we can conduct a poll?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)
<br>
<br>As to SOAP, well, a web services interface to Slash would be great.  Imagine have a command line program, "useperl-journal", and executing it, which launches your text editor, and then you write your journal, and it sends it off to the web site for you.  Web services are nifty.  Slash is Open Source<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... patches welcome!  &lt;ducking<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...&gt;

Hmm. Basically what I was suggesting, only I was removing the need to have any sort of program - email updates could be done while on holiday, perhaps (the signing thing could prove problematic, so some password mechanism could be provided in addition perhaps).
<br>
<br>Of course, it would only *augment* a SOAP interface rather than be there instead. Of course, of course.

<h2>The inverse operation</h2>

How about being able to email to submit journal entries?
<br>
<br>e.g. I could send an email to journal@use.perl.org and it adds it to my journal (since I sent it from the address I have registered).
<br>
<br>Password stuff could be obviated by the use of GPG/PGP signing (since you're storing public keys).
<br>
<br>I ask because as a regular vim user I tend to press escape when I finish typing things. In IE this tends to clear the text entry box. Not good when you've written a long entry. Or a short entry.
<br>
<br>It would be great to be able to just use mutt+vim to submit journal entries - might even make more people use the journals since it would make it easier for a lot of people since they wouldn't have to worry about loading browsers, coming here, going through all the links, etc.
<br> <br>Of course, one could just make a procmail recipe to call a Perl program to fabricate an HTTP sesssion that would result in the message body being posted, but I think it would be a feature that should be standard.
<br> <br>Yay/nay?

<a href="http://ithought.sourceforge.net/" title="sourceforge.net">ithought</a sourceforge.net> can be used to post to <a href="http://advogat.org/" title="advogat.org">Advogato</a advogat.org>, among other places.  It'd probably be an easy modification.
<p>
Of course, it probably wouldn't be too difficult to add an XML-RPC plugin to Slash, either.  Maybe next week.</p>

<a href="/user/acme/journal" title="perl.org">acme</a perl.org> has such a thing that he uses. Why not ask him for a copy?
