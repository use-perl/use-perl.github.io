<p><a href="mailto:jjn1056@yahoo.IAMNOTaNUMBERIAMaFREEMAN.com">jjn1056</a> writes <i>"Okay, here's what I am always talking about.  My team built an XML and Perl based content management and publishing system which my company used to replace all our paper publications, saving us a lot of money.  We get mentioned <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/articles/fe/xml/01/11/26/011126feblurbs.xml">on InfoWorld</a>.  You'll need to jump down to the blurb on 'Bristol-Myers Squibb'.

</i><p><i>Of course, Perl isn't mentioned."</i></p></p>
<p><i>"If we had used some proprietary system, such as Plumtree (which we looked at), it is more likely to have been mentioned, since the PR people at Plumtree has an invested interest in getting their name associated with a company as big as mine.  This is why Perl is so low on the list with companies like Gartner.  They never see Perl being mentioned in little ways like this.

</i><p><i>I wish I could find the people in my company that sends out press releases, to make sure they mention perl.  Unfortunately, it is a never ending battle for recognition in a company dominated by Oracle and PLSQL.

</i></p><p><i>Any thoughts on what we can do, or who I could contact when I notice things like the above?  Maybe we could start a list of such things and point Gartner to it?

</i></p><p><i>BTW, our company internet site uses the same system.  It was even mentioned in a book on corporate web sites, but of course Perl was left out AGAIN!"</i></p></p>
