<p><a href="http://perl-foundation.org/">The Perl Foundation</a> is open for your donations to the 2002 Perl Development Grants to Damian Conway and Dan Sugalski.  I've given $100, bringing the total so far to just shy of $2500.  If it goes above $5000 by Friday night, I'll give another $100.  $100 might not sound like much, but it's more than I was planning to spend on my family's Christmas presents combined!  So take the challenge and <a href="http://www.perl-foundation.org/index.cgi?page=donate">donate</a> what you can.</p>

<p>Since Perl is the reason I got a much better job this year (after far too long in a rut), I decided the least I could do was match Nat's contribution. And now I'm caught up in the pledge-drive fever.</p>
<p>I'm hoping enough of the Slashdot crowd actually contributes (they've got to be good for something!) that Nat's challenge is met easily, so I'll set a slightly higher goal: I'll give another $100 if the total reaches $7500 by Friday night (of course, I'm depending on Nat to know the total).</p>

I should have set my goal at $10,000!  I already owe my other $100, and I suspect that your goal of $7,500 will also be reached.<p>

I honestly get teary-eyed when I think of the spirit in this community.  Or maybe that's just my wife beating me for donating our Christmas money<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p><p>

<h2>How to determine progress of fundraising?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ggoebel/">ggoebel</a> on 2001-12-14T13:24:31</h3>
I'm just curious how we find out where we're at? I'd like to do a dare too. I just don't want to put the bar below the current level of funds raised.

<h3><a href="/user/gnat/">gnat</a> on 2001-12-14T17:07:50</h3>
Update: I owe another $100 already, as does vsergu.
The current level is $7785, with an average donation of $117.95.
There have been two $1000 donations and two $500, all but one from
individuals.  There have been a lot of $10, $20, and $50 donations,
but I think $100 is the mode.  Thanks to everyone who already donated,
and thank to everyone who will donate today.

<h2>Ok. I'll put up $1,000 if we reach $10,000 today!</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ggoebel/">ggoebel</a> on 2001-12-14T18:04:47</h3>
The subject says it all...
<br>
<br>gnat is it possible for you to update the original story to reflect this dare? Or should it be a new one?

<h2>Where?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Cine/">Cine</a> on 2001-12-14T17:54:46</h3>
Where do you actually see how much has been gathered?
<br>I've been to practically all pages on that site<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-(

Nowhere. It isn't posted on the site. Though hint, hint, nudge, nudge... it wouldn't be a bad idea.

<h3><a href="/user/gnat/">gnat</a> on 2001-12-17T17:11:52</h3>
At the end of Friday we had $12,095.  Way to go!  We're nearly up to $15k today.<p>

We've passed that. $16.2K so far. Yay!
