<p>Our esteemed pumpking and chief CPAN librarian, Jarkko Hietaniemi, writes:<br/><br/><blockquote><div>If you see "www.perl.com/CPAN-local" links somewhere, please tell the
maintainer of that document to fix that to "www.cpan.org".
For example, "http://www.perl.com/CPAN-local/ports/" should be
"http://www.cpan.org/ports/". This unfortunate bug spread all around
the world for quite some time because of perl.com's slightly broken
redirect feature. www.perl.com never was intended to be the definitive
CPAN site. www.cpan.org is a load-balancing cluster of more than 200
hosts around the globe, www.perl.com/CPAN is just one mirror of it.
Spread the word.</div></blockquote></p>

<h2>Rewrite?</h2>

Why not have the fine folks at O'Reillynet simply redirect all requests for CPAN-local to www.cpan.org?

Maybe I was not clear enough.
<br>
<br>The problem is not www.perl.com/CPAN-local not working (it does).
<br>
<br>The problem is people thinking www.perl.com/CPAN-local is the canonical CPAN base URL (it isn't).
<br>
<br>Background: there used to be a "multiplexor" in perl.com, that from the reverse-DNS of your IP redirected you to a (hopefully) closer site (since the pipe to perl.com was tiny).  Then, at some point in time, the multiplexor broke so that it *ALWAYS* directed people to perl.com, and more precisely, to "www.perl.com/CPAN-local".  Now, thanks to the books of certain Perl book publisher, people thought that (a) www.perl.com is the right place to go to for CPAN (b) when they did go there, the broken multiplexor threw them to "CPAN-local".  This resulting unfortunate URL then got enshrined in countless documents, and I think, unfortunately, in further books.
<br>
<br>The perl.com multiplexor has since then been fixed (I think), but the bad seed is out there.

Well, if you change your mind<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... we can always take jjohn's suggestion, and put our CPAN archive elsewhere...

<p>There's no need to move it anywhere and, in every manuscript I've gotten from ORA and others I always circle the CPAN-local in red and put the correct URL in there instead. We put the 'FUNET' logo on the bottom of the front page to remind people that it is FUNET supplying the power,pipe,ping and disks for CPAN and to give them a few warm fuzzies.</p>

<p>As a male of the species who put their names on the tiniest of patches to Perl you might understand the wish to firmly form an identity for CPAN outside the realm of ORA.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

I just sent mail to Linda, the Perl editor at O'Reilly, telling her about the move away from perl.com and to cpan.org.  Now she knows it, it'll be right in future books.<p>

A search on google for<br/><br/>link:http://www.perl.com/CPAN-local/<br/><br/>Turned up 4 pages of results. Anyone want to undertake emailing the web masters of all linking sites? Got a standard mail to send out to those people?

Maybe if we ask google real nice, and send them some chocolate they'll do a massive search and replace for us.

<p>Wouldn't it be cool if there was a great software tool or programming language they could use for that?  Hmmm... What a good idea!</p>

<p>Not by your evidence: 39 results == 4 pages of results.</p>
