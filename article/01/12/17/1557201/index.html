<h2>Monash Matching</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/garth/">garth</a> on 2001-12-17T23:23:10</h3>
<p>
<br>I seem to remember last year that the funding was relatively cheap because it was being matched by <a href="http://www.monash.edu.au/" title="monash.edu.au">Monash Uni</a monash.edu.au> were Damian worked. Is this happening again, at least for the Damian portion of the fund?
<br> </p><p>
<br>I would hate to think that the Perl community was not taking full opportunity to make use of Australian tax payer funds to develop Perl 6<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>

Don't think so. We had to make sure we had enough to cover Damian for the year so he could go on sabbatical or whatever. <a href="http://www.blackstar.co.uk/" title="blackstar.co.uk">Blackstar</a blackstar.co.uk> actually put up half the amount.
<p>
Check out the <a href="http://www.yetanother.org/damian/sponsors.html" title="yetanother.org">sponsors page</a yetanother.org> for Damian last year.

Cheers.

<p>
Actually, quite the opposite.  Damian is so cheap because he realized that if YAS could pay out his contract at Monash (A$90,000), then he could work
on Perl all year long, basically offering him a research grant to work on our project, instead of teaching undergrads how to program in C++.
</p><p>
The reasons why picking up Damian's contract was so cheap were that (1) he likes living in Rural Australia (2) where there's a very favorable exchange rate WRT the US Dollar and the English Pound, and (3) some of his expenses were picked up through other work he did for Perl.</p>

Actually, Monash did contribute very significantly this year, and will again next year.
<br>
<br>They provided about half my hardware, all my software and technical support, administrative assistance, financial services, travel insurance, a private office, telephone, international postage, subsidized gym membership, world-wide internet access, and a cable modem at home. Considered at commercial rates that probably makes them about the third largest single contributor to my 2001 Year For Perl.
<br>
<br>And they've already agreed to provide a similar amount of support in 2002 (provided we manage to raise the funds required to buy out my teaching contract again).

Whilst I can understand VALinux (or whatever they
call themselves these days) won't be stumping up
the cash, where's O'Reilly, IBM et al?
