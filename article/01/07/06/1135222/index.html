That's exciting.  I've always been a <i>big</i> fan of Dr. Dobb's and SysAdmin.<br> <br>Does this mean in the future we will be able to order the FULL history of the Perl Journal on CD (just as you can with SysAdmin)?<br> <br>c

Good question.  That hasn't been discussed, to my knowledge.



<h2>Bundled with SysAdmin</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/bmccoy/">bmccoy</a> on 2001-07-06T19:08:50</h3>
Going by what it says in the Press Release, does this mean we have to subscribe to SysAdmin to get TPJ?  Will current subscriptions still be honored?



<h2>time of subscription vs # of issues (of which mag)</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/wickline/">wickline</a> on 2001-07-07T00:21:43</h3>
First off, I'm pleased as punch that TPJ has a publisher, and I'll enjoy every issue I get in the mail. What I'm about to type, I put out there in the spirit of "here's my opinion, just in case these things are still being decided and opinions are useful" rather than in the spirit of "do this or I'll be pissed"...
<br>
<br>I'd rather have my full dose of TPJ than any number of SysAdmin issues. So, if I've got four years left of prepaid TPJ subscription, I'd rather get 16 quarterly issues of TPJ than 16 monthly issues of SySAdmin plus about 5 quarterly TPJ supplements.
<br>
<br>If this is likely to be an issue, and anyone makes it possible to write a letter or make a phone call or fill out a web form to request zero SysAdmin issues in order to receive the full dose of TPJ, I'd jump at that opportunity.
<br>
<br>If I'm likely to get the full does of TPJ anyways, then cool<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
<br>
<br>If I'm just out of luck, then I'll mope around the living room a bit and complain to my cats (the wife is out of town right now).

My reading of it is that all TPJ subscriptions will be tranferred to SysAdmin subscriptions. Plus we'll get our quarterly TPJ to boot.
<br>
<br>So it means TPJ less often (don't know if the size will change). But at least it lives...

TPJ less often than what?  Not less often than before.  TPJ has been quarterly for a long time now.

<h3><a href="/user/pudge/">pudge</a> on 2001-07-08T20:00:19</h3>
I believe what you paid for is $x issues, or $y years, of TPJ.  If they don't honor that agreement, but instead give you $x issues of SysAdmin<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... well, I don't think they are allowed to do that.

As a not-yet TPJ subscriber, I emailed SysAdmin this morning about getting a TPJ subscription. Their answer: It will come free with a SysAdmin sub.
<p>
Since I've been wavering about a SysAdmin sub for some time, this is fine for me, though it doesn't answer any questions for existing TPJ subscribers.
</p><p>
(For those who don't know, Randal writes a monthly column for SysAdmin).
</p><p>Here's what SysAdmin wrote me:
</p><blockquote><div>
"TPJ is no longer being published by itself, however, it is now being published
as a quarterly supplement to Sys Admin.  A 1-year subscription to SA, which
includes 12 monthly issues of SA and 4 quarterly issues of TPJ, is $39 ($58 for
Canada and $69 for Int'l).  You can either go to www.sysadminmag.com/sub or call
800.365.2210 to subscribe."
