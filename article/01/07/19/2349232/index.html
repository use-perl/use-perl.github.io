<h1>CPAN forcing upgrade from 5.6.0 to 5.6.1?</h1>

<p><A HREF="http://marius (at) kjeldahl (dot) net">kjeldahl</A> writes <EM>"I've been using "perl -MCPAN -e shell" to auto install a lot of perl stuff that some of my software use. It used to be so easy; flip that CD onto the machine, load up the OS (usually RedHat or Mandrake) and have perl CPAN fix the rest. This used to work so well. Now it does not any longer. For some reason, sometimes when I install some perl module (very often MLDBM, but I am not sure) CPAN decides I need to upgrade perl 5.6.1. If I stop it and install using (inside the CPAN shell) "look MLDBM", and the usual perl Makefile.pl;make;make test;make install everything seems to build and work fine. At least until I hit another perl module that try to do me a favour by upgrading to 5.6.1.<br/><br/>It is not that I do not want to upgrade. However, for a lot of machines it is simply not worth the effort. I do not want to recompile the web server and do the mod_perl and ssl stuff manually; I just want to install the stuff on one of my development laptops.<br/><br/>So, to summarize: Can this behaviour be turned off? Is there any reason why it _insists_ on installing 5.6.1 when I do not want it to? Is there any MAJOR flaw in 5.6.0 that make it unusable?"</EM><br/><br/><P>This problem never seems to go away, and I don't know the solution.</p>

<h2>Upgrade CPAN</h2>

IIRC, this was an issue in older versions of CPAN.  Newer versions do not try to force this

Ok, hopefully that solves it then. install Bundle::CPAN (using the "old" CPAN module) definitively also wants to put perl 5.6.1 in there, but hopefully look+installing manually works better. Thanks for the tip.

<p>My procedure for doing this:

</p><p> <tt>
perl -MCPAN -e shell<br>
install CPAN<br>
install Bundle::CPAN<br>
install Whatever::Module
</tt> </p>

<p>Doing the <tt>install CPAN</tt> as opposed to the <tt>install Bundle::CPAN</tt> might seem counterintuitive but it ensures that you don't pull in any of the dependencies before pulling in the newest CPAN version, which usually takes care of the perl upgrade issue.</p>

You need "reload CPAN" between install CPAN and install Bundle::CPAN; other than that you are right.
