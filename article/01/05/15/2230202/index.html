Can someone do an exegetical study of your exegesis?



<h2>I thought an exegesis</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jjohn/">jjohn</a> on 2001-05-16T11:28:10</h3>
was an operation to remove one's liver. Go figure.



<h2>Question</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/pudge/">pudge</a> on 2001-05-16T12:51:54</h3>
Is <tt>$val is Found(0)</tt> the same as <tt>$val.Found = 0</tt>?  If so, wouldn't that be easier to write and read?  Of course, I realize that in the context, putting it together in one statement like <tt>%node{VALUE} = $val is Found(0)</tt> would be harder the other way, but I would probably want to just put it into two statements, I think.  Please learn me.

<p>Far be it from me to quibble in matters of perlescent theology with Damian Cardinal Conway, Patriarch of the See of the Southern Cross and Legate Plenipotentiary [<i>to stretch the revealed-religion metaphor past it's limit of elasticity</i>]<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... but<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...</p>

<p>Apocalypse 1 spoke of needing some form of declaration, syntax TBD, that Perl6 syntax as opposed to backwards-compatible Perl5 syntax was to be in force. Shouldn't each Exegisis start with "use 6.0;", since that's the presumptive syntax (Larry's e.g. in Ap.1) until/unless superceded in later Apocalypses?

<blockquote><div> <i>For a programmer to enter nirvana, first unravel a camel and thread it through the eye of a needle.</i> </div></blockquote>
-- My first interesting Perl program removed session-threading from webpages to recover lost versions for the graphics designers. So the memo documenting it was subtitled "unthreading the camel". So I'm amused by the ongoing revealed religion schtick.

<tt>$val is Found(0)</tt> has the same <i>side-effect</i> as <tt>$val.Found = 0</tt>, but not the same <i>evaluation</i>. They both set the property, but the first form evaluates to an alias to its left operand, and the second evaluates to an alias to the property.

<p>
In addition -- for obvious reasons -- you can use the <tt>is</tt> syntax in declarations, but not the<nobr> <wbr></nobr><tt>.</tt> syntax:

</p><blockquote><div> <tt>
	my $PI is constant = 3;
</tt> </div></blockquote>

<p>
And, of course, <tt>is</tt> chains in a usefully different way from<nobr> <wbr></nobr><tt>.</tt></p>

<blockquote><div> <i>

I mean: to have to explicitly tell the Perl 6 compiler <i>every single time</i> that a simple Perl 6 script  in standard Perl 6 syntax is written in (can you believe it!)

</p><p>Instead, I think you'll find there will be some kind of <tt>use Perl5</tt> pragma.

Nobody knows how this is going to play out, but my
<br>guess is that we'll go down the easy route of saying
<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; #!/usr/bin/perl
<br>
<br>is perl5 initially, while perl6 installs as
<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; #!/usr/bin/perl6
<br>
<br>This is what people did for about four years
<br>with the changeover from perl5 to perl6.

I don't know whether perl 5 or perl 6 syntax will be the default (and under what circumstances) but we'll definitely have something simple like a -5 or -6 switch to specify perl 5 or perl 6 mode (respectively) explicitly.

<br>
<br>Yeah, that's what I figured.  OK.



<h2>Re:Use 6.0 required?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/pudge/">pudge</a> on 2001-05-17T18:10:03</h3>
Yeah.  And my new system has perl 5.6.1 installed as perl6! (I've been meaning to flog the SA over that, but I've been bothering him enough lately.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)



<h2>Re:Use 6.0 required?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/n1vux/">n1vux</a> on 2001-05-17T19:44:01</h3>
Dropping the leading digit sounds like a Solaris thing.  I heard someone else refer to 5.6.1 as Perl6 too -- a Solaris SA.

Ahh, that makes sense, thank you for explaining.

<h2>Add this to the timeline</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/persicom/">persicom</a> on 2001-05-18T14:03:19</h3>
Is this the first published instance of Perl6 code? Shouldn't we somehow mark the date? Or add it to the timeline....
<br>
<br>darn, now where is that perl history page?



<h2>Re:Use 6.0 required?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ask/">ask</a> on 2001-05-21T23:52:56</h3>
heh, Perl 5.x is so old now that people don't think the 5 means anything and just considers 5.6 to be the next major release, hence perl6.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)
<br> <br>
&nbsp; - ask



<h2>Re:Add this to the timeline</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ask/">ask</a> on 2001-05-21T23:55:39</h3>
The history page is at (surprise!) <a href="http://history.perl.org/" title="perl.org">history.perl.org</a perl.org>.
