the information age along with the bar code, the<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.signature file, the lab mouse, the

Observations...
<br>
<br>O: "Perl has been hailed..."
<br>R: The empahasis is on "has been"
<br>
<br>O: "Perl is a poster child for the open-source software revolution."
<br>R: Poster child...I agree.
<br>
<br>O: "Perl was created by linguist Larry Wall to mimic natural languages."
<br>R: In no true sense of the word "linguist" is Larry Wall a linguist. He may be (a) "linguist after a fashion"; (b) "self-styled linguist";
<br>or an "amatuer linguist". Just because something is repeated over and over does not make it so.
<br>
<br>O: "This allows Perl programmers a large measure of creative expression in the way that they build sites..."
<br>R: And a large measure of creative expression in producing unmaintainable code. The advantages of rapid deployment time are lost to the disadvantages of maintaining a "write-once" language. Of course, the guilty have long since fled the scene (kinda' like deadbeat dad's...).
<br>
<br>O: "It's one of the many indications of the cultlike following..."
<br>R: Again...I agree. Businesses need solutions, not cults. "No thank you, I gave at the office."
<br>
<br>O: "With my linguistics background..."
<br>R: "Exposure to linguistics" would be more correct.
<br>
<br>O: "I've learned that a language without a culture is a dead language"
<br>R: And what about a language with a debased culture...a culture of theft...a culture bereft of vision...a culture of elitism...that is to say, the culture of Perl?
<br>
<br>Cheers!
