<p><a href="mailto:jesse+useperl@bestpractical.com">Jesse</a> writes <i>"I'm pleased to announce the public beta of <a href="http://rt.cpan.org/">rt.cpan.org</a>, a public bug tracking system for every distribution in the CPAN.
Anybody can use the public interface to look at current and past bugs in distributions and to report new bugs.

</i><p><i>Over the next couple weeks, I'd like the community to put the system through its paces, so we can work out the kinks before we invite the masses to start reporting bugs.


</i></p><p><i>Authors can sign in with their PAUSE credentials to work with and resolve bugs.  If you don't have a PAUSE account or if RT's concept of your list of distributions looks wrong, send mail to <a href="mailto:jesse+cpan@bestpractical.com">jesse+cpan@bestpractical.com</a> and I'll take care of it.

</i></p><p><i>In addition to the web interface, anyone can report a bug in a distribution by sending mail to bug-<i>distname</i>@rt.cpan.org  (ex: bug-dbix-searchbuilder@rt.cpan.org)."</i>

</p><p>Thanks, Jesse.  I've heard a lot of good things about <a href="http://www.fsck.com/projects/rt/">RT</a>, and this is another great service that the Perl community can offer to developers.</p></p>

<h2>VERY nice</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/andypetdance.com/">andypetdance.com</a> on 2001-11-07T21:22:47</h3>
Very nice.  I'm glad to see such a thing.  I'll have to dump my to-do list for MARC::Record into there.
<br>
<br>Thanks much...



<h2>We at CPAN</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/hfb/">hfb</a> on 2001-11-07T21:52:33</h3>
<p>Thank you<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) Not only for seeing a problem to be solved, but for coming through with an attractive and useful solution. I'll update the CPAN FAQ to indicate users should open bugs through rt.cpan.org as well as encourage authors to use it as well. The testers should find this handy too when reporting bugs to authors.</p>

<p>You and Dave Cross are my heros of the "Just STFU and do it" revolution<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) Thanks and thanks and thanks! </p>



<h2>auto bug reports from cpantest</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/hossman/">hossman</a> on 2001-11-07T23:09:49</h3>
What would really be sweet is if the cpantest script automatically CCed bug-<i>distname</i>@rt.cpan.org if the test failed.
<p>

(And if each package page on search.cpan.org &amp; testers.cpan.org were hyperlinked to the corrisponding buglist on rt.cpan.org<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... <b>sweeeeeeet!!</b>)</p>

I'm sure this can be fixed - I'll have a look at it some time today<nobr> <wbr></nobr>....

Ditto to the kudos.  I think this will really help communication.  Thanks Jesse.



<h2>It should be optional</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/gbarr/">gbarr</a> on 2001-11-09T18:59:28</h3>
While I tagree that this is a good idea. The appearance of an authers distributions should be optional by the author.
<br> <p>
<br>I remember in the early days of cpan-testers there were a lot of complaints from authers that bug reports were put in such a public place before they had a chance to address them.</p>

Some authors (notably DCONWAY) have cited that they receive too much email as it is, and adding another channel to send bug reports is likely to be ignored.  In those cases, the presence of a page to receive bug reports that will be ignored by the author will likely give the appearance that the module is buggy/dead, or that the author doesn't care (when in fact the author doesn't want to spend time weeding out duplicate/bogus reports and would rather write modules instead).
<p>
Nevertheless, having a central bug report repository is certainly a step in the right direction.  The issues that Graham (and Damian) raise are just tweaks, not fundemental flaws.
</p><p>
Thanks.</p>

Exactly, I did not mean anything else.

<p>Well, do take some care not to discourage someone who has some enthusiasm and is putting his money where his mouth is. The person who does something as opposed to whines, bitches and generally postulates about problems is a rare breed....please to not be making them extinct<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<p>I think bugs for public source/open source software should be the same since it would seem to be contradictory to have it open source with closed bug reports. Noone writes perfect code and it should be publicly available information.</p>

<p>Also, I don't think the intent was to force authors into using the system but it can't hurt for authors to at least try it and see if it works for them. I've heard a lot of good feedback and maybe Jesse can make it so the few who adamantly don't wish to use it can make it so that there is at least a pointer the authors bug list or a 'FOAD I don't write bugs in my CODE' page where a bug list would have been.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<p>Give the system a chance. Hey, remember the 'mailing list for every module' idea....?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>
