Do you know what is weird about this post?<br> <br>At our October 27th Perl Monger meeting, we decided to add what we've dubbed the <b>Monthly Module</b>.  A Monthly Module section is being added to the website and at each Perl Monger meeting we will have a 5-10 talk on said module.<br> <br>Great minds think alike, eh?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br> <br>So, should we proceed with our local version of this idea and just submit a link to the Monthly Module articles there are exceptionally written?  Or should we just post the Monthly Modules to <a href="http://use.perl.org/" title="perl.org">http://use.perl.org</a perl.org> and forgo the local webpage?<br> <br>We are also adding another column to our Perl Monger site, <b>Algorithm Alley</b>.  We have several teacher types lurking in the group and wanted to provide a way to present short articles without submitting to formal zines and such.<br> <br>Thanks!

Please post them here. use Perl; could really use some more content.

Actually, the Algorithm Alley column name is already used in Dr. Dobb's Journal.  I knew it sounded familiar when it was suggested at the meeting.  I was just reading the latest DDJ and flipped to <i>Algorithm Alley</i>.  Rats!

<p>Sure, submit them to use Perl;<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) We don't require exclusive rights to material.</p>

<h2>articles on modules some might find interesting...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/tzz/">tzz</a> on 2001-11-02T14:52:57</h3>
I've written several articles on particular CPAN modules that others might find interesting:
<br>
<br> <a href="http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/library/l-perl3/index.html" title="ibm.com">
</a ibm.com><br>AppConfig
<br> <p>
<br> <a href="http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/library/perl-speak.html" title="ibm.com">
</a ibm.com><br>Parse::RecDescent
<br> 
<br> </p><p>
<br> <a href="http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/library/perl2/index.html" title="ibm.com">The Persistent classes
</a ibm.com><br> 
<br> </p><p>
<br>
<br>And I rely heavily on modules in other articles I've written for IBM DeveloperWorks.  I can allow most of them (depending on the IBM publishing date because of the contract; the three above are OK) to be republished for free, if anyone is interested.

<p> Nice articles<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) I'm looking for anything module related as unrestrained creativity could produce some interesting articles. I'm working on an article that will describe my painful quest for a perl/apache photo album comparing 2 apache modules and 3 scripts/modules that are not on CPAN. It doesn't have to be for the high-end tea drinking crowd<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

Damn damn, DAMN!
<br>
<br>I'm just working on AxKit::PhotoAlbum. Though it's proving slower (to develop) than I'd prefer. I mean I had to write XML::LibRSVG first (for the SVG thumbnails, in case you couldn't guess)<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)
