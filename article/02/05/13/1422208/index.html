How will writing C extensions in Perl 6 compare to Perl 5 (XS)?  Will it be easier?

Perl 6 extensions in C will depends on the Parrot implementation the same way that perl 5 extensions rely on the perl 5 engine.<br> <br>Now, if you'd asked "Will I be able to do Inline::C type things in Perl 6 to write C extensions", or "Will I be able to interface to external libraries without all this XS/extension nonsense, then that'd be different.

I think I disagree, unless you think that the Parrot team will be designing the new version of XS.  To my mind XS is basically a programming language unto itself, and one that is sorely in need of re<i>design</i>, not just reimplementation.

I think it needs to be addressed in the Perl 6 design and not just left to the geeks in the trenches.

Oh, you're talking about the CODE:/PPCODE:/MODULE stuff? Yeah, that's all going. Parrot extensions will be plain  with at best some metainformation in a separate file to drive the linking and possibly the yanking in or autogeneration of some default routines.

That sounds pretty bare-metal to me.  Maybe the Parrot guys design this layer and then the Perl 6 designers add something on top?

It's possible to build "plain" Perl 5 modules too, but who would want to?  XS exists to make programming Perl 5 modules in C easier.  Is there good reason to think that Perl 6 won't need something similar?

XS exists because programming perl 5 modules in C is so hard. Programming bare against Parrot will be easier than programming with XS.<br> <br>Don't forget that the same standard also needs to be there for any other language hosted on Parrot--a C extension should look the same for Perl as it does for Ruby, Python, Scheme, or BASIC. That puts the responsibility of how it looks and works on the shoulders of the Parrot folks, not the Perl language design folks.

Is there a design spec that can back up this statement?  I've heard this said before but I fear that simply wishing won't make it so.  In particular, I wonder if the register architecture will be difficult to manipulate at a low level.  Stack machines have their faults but they do generally win in accessibility.

Color me unconvinced.  Perl extenstions typically deal quite closely with Perl data structures and builtin functionality.  Much of this will, by its very nature, not be available in other Parrot run-times.

Extensions won't be touching the registers. In general, extensions won't have any knowledge of the workings of the interpreter, since we might, and probably will, at some point do a good-sized reworking of the internals.<br> <br>As for perl special stuff at the XS level... there isn't much. In fact, there's almost nothing at all. (I'd say nothing, as I can't think of anything perl specific, but there may be something small that I'm missing) Variables, stashes, calling conventions, methods, and all that stuff are language independent.<br> <br>The differences between the languages are almost entirely syntactic.

Ok - new question
<p>
Given this:</p><blockquote><div> <tt>my $obj = SomeObject-&gt;new;</tt> </div></blockquote>Will Perl 6 allow a programmer to distinguish between these within <i>method1</i> somehow?<blockquote><div> <tt>my $val = $obj-&gt;method1; # want_scalar<br>my @val = $obj-&gt;method1; # want_array<br>my %val = $obj-&gt;method1; # want_hash<br> <br>my $val2 = [];<br>my $val3 = {};<br> <br>$val2 = $obj-&gt;method1; # want_anon_array<br>$val3 = $obj-&gt;method1; # want_anon_hash</tt> </div></blockquote>Along those lines, will there be better support for method chaining, along the lines of Robin Houston's 'Want' module?<blockquote><div> <tt>my $val = $obj-&gt;method1-&gt;method2; # want_object</tt> </div></blockquote>In the above example, method1 would return a reference to $self, while method2 would return a value.
<p>
Again, along the same lines, will methods modify a receiver in place by default or not?</p>

<p>The (true) comment is often made about Perl 5, "Only Perl can parse Perl".  It appears Perl 6 will also have many nice DWIM-y features, some of which depend on interpreting input flexibly.  I like that a lot, but I also wonder how much weight is being given to making Perl 6 easy to parse; without resorting to tightly coupling the scanner and parser, for example.</p>

Very little as far as I can tell!  I think working too hard in this direction would very quickly run up against the "let Perl stay Perl dictum."  The stuff that's generally the hardest for the non-perl parser I use (Emacs cperl-mode) - regexes, quote operators and here docs - don't appear to be changing much at all.

<h2>Platform specific functionality (alarm/fork) etc.</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/osfameron/">osfameron</a> on 2002-05-13T20:13:23</h3>
Some core functionality of Perl is OS related.
<code>alarm</code>, <code>fork</code>, <code>flock</code>,
signal handlers etc.<br>i.e. with Perl 5, they
aren't fully implemented on the Win32 platform.
It is argued that this is because of
insufficiencies in the OS, but they <i>are</i>
part of the language, and I'd argue that they
should work as much as possible on all platforms.

<p>

With Perl 6, will these be natively implemented within the language (e.g. within the capabilities
of Parrot I suppose)?  Or would they be transparently wrapped?  Or will Win32 etc.
users still have to make do with the
non- or partially- implemented versions?

(I'm hoping of course that we will be able to
play with the big boys soon!)</p>

<h2>Tainting, Safe compartments, Security</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ziggy/">ziggy</a> on 2002-05-13T22:44:44</h3>
A few questions, all somewhat interrelated.
<p><ol>
<li>What big changes are in store with tainting in Perl6?  Will there be new builtins to handle tainting/untainting of data?  (And does forceful untainting of data <i>really</i> make sense, anyway?)</li>
<li>Ruby handles tainting by starting a restricted thread (Safe compartment), and allowing the thread to fail if the requested operations would fail.  Will the taint model for Perl6 be like the current Perl5 model, something different that we've seen before (like the Ruby hack), or something totally new (with the appropriate amount of backwards-compatibility pixie dust)?</li>
<li>Is Perl6 going to offer "safe compartments" to execute questionable code, or (source|byte) code that came from outside the currently running program?  Will modules be loaded in a safe compartment (when desired)?</li>
<li>Is there going to be a point where things like BEGIN blocks can be intercepted before they're executed, or will they continue to be executed prior to "runtime"?</li>
<li>Will there be hooks in Perl6 to adapt/retro-fit a Java-like security model so that foreign source/bytecode can be checked for some measure of safety before it's integrated into the runtime environment?</li>
</ol>

That won't work, since the point of BEGIN blocks is to run even earlier than that.  They have to execute while the parse is still in progress or they can't mangle the current grammar by installing subroutine definitions and such.

<h2>`Source Filters'</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/pdcawley/">pdcawley</a> on 2002-05-14T08:06:30</h3>
In perl 5, source filters will only work if the modules they apply to are <code>use</code>d during the initial startup phase of Perl's execution. If you do a runtime <code>require</code> of a module then its source filters don't get applied. This is somewhat annoying. (And that's putting it mildly; the whole BEGIN/CHECK/INIT cycle only works at perl start time, which makes delayed loading of all sorts of modules impossible.)<br> <br>So, assuming perl 6 retains BEGIN/CHECK/INIT and source filters (and I hope it does), will these now work for modules that get loaded after the startup phase?

very often, I notice beginners having problems with interpolation of variables in regexes, especially if there are "strange" chars, e.g:</p><p><blockquote><div> <tt>c:\work&gt; perl -w<br>$match = "\\";<br>$string =~<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/$match/;<br>^Z<br>Quantifier follows nothing before HERE mark in regex m/+ &lt;&lt; HERE \/ at - line 2.</tt> </div></blockquote>because they often forget <blockquote><div> <tt>\Q$match\E</tt> </div></blockquote> or the like.<p>

In my eyes, changing the default-behaviour to no-auto-evaluation it will make it easier for beginners to not writing programs that accitentally work, because just by changing the content of a variable, you might get syntax errors, or much stranger, unicode errors.
Perhaps using \E....\Q or the like explicitely for auto-evaluation.</p><p>

Best regards,</p><p>

<h2>event loop ? &amp;amp; misc...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/raptor/">raptor</a> on 2002-05-21T10:47:58</h3>
i read<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...can't remember probably in RFC's that there should be event-loop integreted in Perl ? will there be such if yes can u provide a simple example ?
<br> <br>
There will be filters ? in the spirit of Apache2 that u can chain the in/out or this is more mod_perl thingy ?
<br> <br>
there was discussion on perl-language list about MACRO language ? or it will be like a separate module in the CORE-packages ?
<br> <br>
it was mentioned that Parrot will allow freezing/thawing stuff ? will there be keywords for this or it will be separate modules like it is today with Perl5 ?
<br> <br>
I asked in the past about this, but<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:")<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...Will there be two way hashes i.e.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... to be possible to use both keys and values of hashes like hash-KEYS
<br> <br>
tie-ing will be fast aren't it ?
<br> <br>
What you designers of the Perl6 like most in it ?
<br> <br>
Will there be a new keyword in Perl6 named "dwim" ? U know what it have to do<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:") i.e. write dwim and that's all. All your problems solved<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:")
<br> <br>
One last thing may be not in the context of all this i was wondering... one thing that amazes me about languages like Lisp &amp; Prolog is the possibilities to treat the program as DATA i.e. to be able to change the CODE on the fly ?
Or the Perl language is diifferent in this aspect and such thing is not feasable/worth ? Probably the reason that Perl6 parser will be in Perl will give us some freedom on this issue<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...
<br> <br>
Thanx alot and keep the good work<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.....Perl rocks<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:")
