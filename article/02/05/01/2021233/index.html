<p><a href="mailto:dave@dave.org.uk">davorg</a> writes <i>"The <a href="http://nms-cgi.soureforge.net/">nms</a> project has stepped slightly outside of its remit to rewrite Matt Wright's scripts. We've released <a href="http://nms-cgi.sourceforge.net/scripts.shtml">nms_sendmail</a> which is a standalone, pure-perl replacement for sendmail (or, at least, for the parts of sendmail that you need to send emails from a CGI program). Its main purpose is so that people whose web server is on a Windows machine can use our formmail program with needing sendmail -- all you need is access to an SMTP server."</i></p>

No, no no, that's not statically valid.  We'll have to start up a new poll and then do the whole thing again for another five months<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)

<h2>New meaning for nms?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Buck/">Buck</a> on 2002-05-01T21:40:11</h3>
From their website: "There was some discussion on PerlMonks about alternative meanings for nms, and whilst I like many of those ideas, I think that nms probably doesn't actually stand for anything."<br> <br>I guess, in this case, it stands for No More Sendmail. (Lame, I know, but *somebody* had to say it)<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br> <br>



<h2>Yeah but...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/belg4mit/">belg4mit</a> on 2002-05-01T22:57:29</h3>
I was about to say "what about the modules for this", and then realized who the audience was. Nevermind, nothing to see here.

There seems to be a typo in the link for 'nms'.



<h2>some history ?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/rabbits77/">rabbits77</a> on 2002-05-08T13:41:22</h3>
Has anyone bothered asking Matt Wright about this? What has his response been? I mean, if I released something that was bothering people this much I would just fix it myself. Either that or just release binaries &gt;:) <br>
Seriously though, has anyone ever asked him and gotten his opinions on these matters?

<p>Binaries wouldn't fix the security flaws.  It's not just that the code looks bad; it's that the things that are wrong with the code translate into real problems.</p>

<p>I believe Matt has basically said that people are welcome to use his programs, but he is aware that they have problems and is no longer interested in fixing them (he's gone on to other things).  I may have imagined I read that, though.</p>

Of course a binary woudn't fix problems. I didn't imply that at all. A binary would help *conceal* the problem until the symptoms showed up instead of failing at code review stage. Oh yeah, and it was a joke. Now that summer is upon us , in my hemisphere anyway, maybe you can go outside and find a sense of humor.

<p>Sorry, man.  I didn't realize the joke.  Since there are plenty of people who think the only problem with Matt's scripts is that the "Perl cabal" thinks they're bad scripts, it didn't seem farfetched to me that someone might think compiling them to binaries would be fine, because no one would ever know it was bad code.  I was trying to be helpful and provide more information.  If you already knew that, great!  Maybe it will help someone else.</p>

<p>I've been in touch with Matt quite a lot over the last few months. He's recently released a new version (1.92) of formmail which fixes just about all of the insecurities and prevents it being used as a spam-relay.</p>
<p>All the scripts still use pretty nasty code tho'. Matt doesn't see that as an issue although he freely admits that he was just learning to program when he wrote those scripts.</p>
<p>He's also talked about linking to <a href="http://nms-cgi.sf.net/" title="sf.net">nms</a sf.net> from the MSA web site, but that hasn't happened yet.</p>

<h2>O'Reilly recommends MSA scripts!?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/demerphq/">demerphq</a> on 2002-05-08T14:54:34</h3>
Ive been reading "Web Design in a nutshell" (2nd ed.) by Jennifer Niederst and came across a copy of a MSA script as well as recommendations for using it as a resource.<p>
No mention is made of the security issues and etc of MSA scripts.  It appears it was printed in 2001 so perhaps it might be a good idea for you to let them know about the issues and about NMS.</p><p>

<p>I spotted this some time ago and have already brought it to the attention of O'Reilly. Of course I wouldn't complain if other people did as well...</p>
