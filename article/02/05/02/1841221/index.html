Now evey book that remotely deal with XML is going to spend a chapter "introducing" XML to us.<br> <br>It stands to reason that if we are buying a book about processing XML with Perl that we either already  know Perl and XML or we have viable documentation for each technology.<br> <br>O'Reilly is particularly bad for this. They need to factor out the overlap and make their books thinner.

In this case the "XML Recap" chapter is just 22 pages out of 194. That's not much and I don't think it is a waste of pages.<br> <br>

<p>It's hard to guage the book audience.  I want it to introduce XML to me, because while I know the concepts, I've never really used it for much. (yet)  The other respondent below says the intro was only 22 pages; that sounds good.  We'll have to wait longer if we want Advanced Perl and XML.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

  I concur. I would personally skip that chapter, but you get so many questions on the perl-xml list that are no more than pure XML questions that it has to be useful. And the way jdavidb puts it almost a paraphrase of what the book says: <em>"you are free to skip this chapter, but don't complain later that you don't know a namespace from an en-dash"</em>.

<h2>Recommendation</h2>

<p>
  I've read this book (no I do not read into the future, I'm just translating it) and it definitely is good. I've felt for a long time that was has been missing, more than documentation, is something that tells Perlians what really is so cool about XML (ie all the nice stuff that's hidden behind the silly hype smoke).
</p>

<p>
  XML was created <em>by</em> Perlians, <em>for</em> Perlians. It's there for us to take if only we quit being snobbish and silly and left it to PHB-lovin' folks.
</p>

<p>
  This book, while I did have a certain amount of things to write to the authors about (but what do you expect<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;), does try hard and imho succeeds in starting to give XML the Perlish spin it wanted to have from day one (ever wondered why the requirements document talked about the Desperate Perl Hacker?).
</p>

<p>
  If you're already fluent with Perl and XML interplay you might not need it (I've seen space enough for an Advanced Perl &amp; XML in there), but if you're curious or just starting out, I think that this book could definitely help.
</p>



<h2>A very good introduction</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/mir/">mir</a> on 2002-05-04T09:32:23</h3>
<p>I like this book. I like its informal style, I appreciate the examples
   about monkeys and comic books instead of the usual e-commerce. I also like
   the fact that it strikes the right balance between the "old-generation"
   modules (based on XML::Parser) and the new ones (SAX-based). It covers
   the most popular modules and does a good job at explaining how and
   when to use them.</p>
<p>Other nice points: the discussion of Unicode is pretty good, describing
   its impact on XML
   processing and the various ways to do conversions between encodings.
   The book also includes the right amount of reference material; SAX and SAX2,
   and DOM. The final chapter offers a bunch of detailed examples that
   show quite well what a typical XML application is.</p>
<p>Even the description of XML::Twig is good... what else would you (or at
   least I<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;--) ask for?</p>
<p>A couple of minor complaints: the part about the DOM should definitely
   mention XML::GDOME, which is similar to XML::DOM but based on the GNOME
   DOM, and is less mature but more actively maintained than XML::DOM.
   IMHO it should also include a warning about the low-levelness of the DOM
   API and show some of the pitfalls that can trip un-experienced users (OK,
   that's one of my pet peeves, but still, a well-placed XML comment or line
   return can often crash naively designed DOM code). Some
   problems with the description of Unicode (page 22, latin-1 and Unicode
   code points are the same (for all 0-255 characters), but UTF-8 and latin-1
   are only similar for characters 0-127). I suspect a longer discussion
   of the respective merits of Perl vs XSLT could also have been useful for
   some readers, to help them justify sticking with Perl when their
   management wants them to be buzzword compliant or when to give in and
   switch to XSLT when appropriate.</p>
<p>Finally it could be argued that the book is quite thin, about 200 pages.
   The problem is that there are so many modules, and they have so much
   documentation already, that I think this is the right format: an
   introduction, that gives the big picture and lets you pick which processing
   model and ultimately which module to use depending on the specifics of the
   project at hand. It gives readers enough information to be able to go
   further, without overwhelming them with tons of details about each module,
   which can be found in the POD anyway, updated with each new release.</p>
<p>Overall it is a very good introduction, targeted at Perl hackers who are
   new to XML, or have outgrown XML::Simple.
   With this book and <a href="http://xml.com/pub/q/perlxml" title="xml.com">Kip Hampton's
   columns</a xml.com> on XML.com they should be up-to-speed and ready to do serious
   XML processing in no time. Although it is probably not essential for people
   already familiar with the subject I liked the SAX and DOM references, and
   I was not familiar with all the modules mentioned in the book (who is?).
   So even if I agree with Robin on the need for
   an "Advanced Perl and XML" or a "Perl and XML Cookbook" companion I think
   as it is, it is still useful for me.</p>

<p> <b>Small prints</b>:I was one of the technical reviewer of this book,
so I might be considered involved in it. As no one else posted a review I
decided to write this one though.</p>
