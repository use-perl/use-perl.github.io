<p><a href="http://slashdot.org/user/jdavidb/">jdavidb</a> writes <i>"In my recent distributed systems class I was required to write several multithreaded client-servers (they were both) in Java.  As usual, I thought constantly about how Perl would be better suited for the job, except that the threading in Java was so obviously useful that I actually felt Java worked out better.

</i><p><i>A year ago, use Perl; carried the story that the iThreads mailing list had been established.  I read p5p summaries every couple of weeks that told of dozens of bugs being squashed on the road to usable iThreads.  Unfortunately, it looks like that push has fallen off the face of the earth.

<h2>It's not dead</h2>

In fact, it's very much alive. ithreads are the default thread model if you choose one for 5.8, and the old 5.005-style threads are getting removed for 5.10.

From a recent p5p post by jhi:<br> <br>MINISTRY OF TRUTH OFFICIAL ANNOUNCEMENT 17-13/711.3.55b<br> <br>5.005 threads is dead, deprecated and expected to be removed in 5.10.<br> <br>ithreads is the new recommended threads model. Authors of multithreaded<br>applications are urged to reshape their code for the brave new world.<br>

<p>Thanks!  Now that I know what I'm looking for, I was able to find <a href="http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2002-05/msg00583.html" title="mpe.mpg.de">the announcement</a mpe.mpg.de>.</p>
