<p><a href="http://www.activestate.com/">Lori Pike</a> writes <i>"ActiveState is delighted to announce the second annual Programmers' Choice and Activators' Choice Awards. The awards honor the unnamed heroes who <b>actively</b> contribute to open languages and display excellence in their programming efforts."</i> More inside. And remember, that's "unnamed", folks - who needs more encouragement and credit than they're currently getting?</p>
<p>

<p> This year we're expanding the categories to include each of our key technologies: Perl, PHP, Python, Tcl, and XSLT.</p>

<p>The Programmers' Choice recipients are nominated and chosen by members of the programming community - like you.  Know someone who's really made a difference using these languages? <a href="http://www.activestate.com/Corporate/Awards/ActiveAwards.html">Tell us about them!</a> </p>

<p>We'll also be acknowledging our personal favorites with the Activators' Choice Awards. While you're busy voting for your favorites our development team will do the same, selecting one deserving programmer in each language.</p>

<p> <a href="http://www.activestate.com/Corporate/Awards/ActiveAwards.html">Get out the vote</a> and stay tuned! Nominees will be announced July 2, 2002. Perl, PHP, Python and XSLT winners will be announced at OSCON July 23, 2002.  Tcl winners will be announced at the Tcl conference in September.</p></p>

I'm assuming that they intended it for people that don't get recognition, rather than Damian, Larry et al who get their names up in lights.
<p>
I was thinking more of people like Matts and Simon who should get awards for being prolific module writers.

Ack, not me! I made sure "actively" was in bold, since I'm officially retired.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;) Matts, on the other hand - good choice. Him, myself and Schwern are collectively responsible for quite a large chunk of CPAN.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

Yep I'd rather see this going to someone other than "the big two" as there are clearly other unsung heros of Perl.  Along with Matts &amp; Simon I'd also add Jarkko to that particular list.<br> <br> <code>my $cents = 2;</code>

<p>It seems like a good way to come up with names
would be to look through the Perl 5.8 CHANGES
file and see who has contributed a lot of patches
since 5.6.1.  Then strike off the names that you hear a lot.</p>

<p>Here's the count I got: </p> <blockquote><div> <tt>&nbsp; &nbsp; 100 H.Merijn Brand<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; 101 Simon Cozens<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; 120 Ilya Zakharevich<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; 128 Rafael Garcia-Suarez<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; 167 Craig A. Berry<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; 176 Peter Prymmer<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; 245 Nicholas Clark<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; 258 Michael G Schwern<br> <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;oo Jarkko Hietaniemi</tt> </div></blockquote> <p>
All of these seem like reasonable choices.
Craig Berry is on the list for doing tons of work
on the VMS port; similarly a lot of Peter Prymmer's contributions are for VMS, so you might want to drop them from consideration.  (Not that their tireless contributions aren't enormously valuable, of course, but because they benefit a smaller segment of the community.)  Brand is a tougher case.  Most of his contributions are for
unusual platforms, but there are a lot of them, and they include
Cygwin, AIX, and HP-UX.</p>

<p>As Simon mentioned elsewhere, he retired, and if you run the same list with just the entries
from the last twelve months, you see that.  You get the same names in the same order, except that Simon is missing and chromatic has appeared at the bottom instead.</p>

<p>That leaves:  Jarkko, Schwern, Nick Clark, Rafael Garcia-Suarez, Ilya, and maybe Brand, in that order.  Rafael was my own pick before I
actually looked at the data, simply because about six months ago I said to myself "Who's this Garcia-Suarez guy?" and then was aastonished to discover how many patches he had contributed
without my ever really noticing him.  Having seen the data, I'd have to give the award to Michael or Nick, assuming that Jarkko was considered too well-known to receive it.</p>

<p>That's a good list.  It's a bit odd that the deputy pumpkings (ams and sky) aren't on the list, though.</p>

MJD obviously did a grep on Changes. The names of Abhijit and Arthur (and mine, BTW<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-) don't appear in Changes for patches they apply directly to Perforce.

One of the great things about Perl is it's wide platform support.  Perl patches that apply to all platforms often support an odd corner of the language from which few will reap any benefit, also.<br> </p><p>That being said, while the count is a good place to start, some analysis of the patches beyond just the count is a good thing.  <br> </p><p>I would like to point out that Michael Schwern has lent a much appreciated hand to the VMS port.  As far as I could tell, Michael learned VMS from ground zero and did a lot of work on getting the tests in order, as well as a fix here and there to the VMS specific code.<br> </p><p>Seeing as Michael is not, as far as I know, a user of VMS at all, this is a selfless act of personal sacrifice.  Typically, projects like these get by on conglomerated self-interest.  It's refreshing when you see someone who pitches in where there is help needed without some personal interest of their own.<br> </p><p>His winning the "patch count" race doesn't hurt his standing at all, either.<br> </p><p>I know who I'm voting for.</p>
