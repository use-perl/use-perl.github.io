I have no idea what Damian's "Space::Time::Continuum" is about, but I know I want to see it.  Let's not forget that <a href="http://www.dice-con.com/Life.html" title="dice-con.com">Damian was mining cellular automata</a dice-con.com> long before <a href="http://www.wolframscience.com/" title="wolframscience.com">Stephen Wolfram discovered the answer to life, the universe, and everything</a wolframscience.com>.<p>

I'll be attending every Perl 6 session, too.  I've been so busy on books that I've not been keeping track of the details of the Apocalypses, I'm embarrassed to say.  I try to make the Apocalypses, Exegeses, and new Parrot releases happen with some regularity, but buggered if I could tell you how to parse expressions in Perl 6<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p><p>

I'll keep an eye on Sean Quinlan's bioinformatics talk because, well, I'm a biowhore now.  I had so much fun at our first bioinformatics conference that I will attend Sean's talk if only for nostalgia value.  And, well, I can talk the talk, but I need to take a class so I can walk the walk! (are you spotting a pattern here in my alleged competencies?)</p><p>

And, of course, the lightning talks.  I've not heard yet whether mine was accepted.  I hope so, although I'll have to do some quick writing if it is!  If it's not accepted, I'll do it at OSCON anyway--there have to be some benefits to being the big cheese!</p><p>

What are you all interested in?  CPANPLUS?  mod_perl?  Getting the conference organizer drunk and dancing topless?  (Hint: it'll be harder to do that at TPC than YAPC<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p><p>

Is that a subtle hint that the conference organizer wants to get drunk?  <a href="http://www.dogfish.com/midas.html" title="dogfish.com">That</a dogfish.com> <a href="http://www.brooklynbrewery.com/beer_monster.html" title="brooklynbrewery.com">can</a brooklynbrewery.com> <a href="http://www.sierranevada.com/html/beers/bigfoot.htm" title="sierranevada.com">be</a sierranevada.com> <a href="http://www.anchorbrewing.com/bottles.htm" title="anchorbrewing.com">arranged</a anchorbrewing.com>...

Basic rule of thumb: the conference organizer <i>always</i> wants to get drunk.<p>

Actually, I'm wary of drinking at TPC.  I don't want to be hungover the next day and unable to function or enjoy what's going on.  Getting drunk at YAPC, though<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... ho boy.  No family and gone for a week?  You better believe I'll be drinking like a dehydrated fish with hollow legs.  (That's a twisted simile basically meaning "a lot").</p><p>

A couple of my new-to-perl coworkers are attending<br>YAPC as it's clearly the best perl experience one<br>can buy for $85 (we're located in saint louis, so<br>there are no travel expenses).<br> <br>The schedule was a bit opaque to them, so I prepared<br>a document to try to help them figure out which sessions<br>they might want to see.<br> <br>Certainly none of you care which sessions I'm going<br>to attend, but if you're new to perl, then some of<br>the notes and links and HTML titles (tooltips in many<br>recent browsers) may be of interest to you.<br> <br>Note that some of the links/titles may be totally<br>misleading. In some cases I just guessed. In others<br>I just had no idea.<br> <br>(corrections welcomed)<br> <br> <a href="http://wickline.org/yapc/" title="wickline.org">http://wickline.org/yapc/</a wickline.org> <br> <br>also note that this version may fall out of sync with<br>the real schedule as the real schedule is updated. The<br>top of the document links to the real schedule which<br>should be the final word (until it is revised verbally<br>the morning of the 26th, 27th, and/or 29th).<br> <br>-matt<br>

<tt>hmmmm...<br> <br>folks new to perl probably don't read this stuff.<br> <br>If you know someone new to perl who will be attending<br>YAPC, and you think some of this might be of use to<br>them, please feel free to pass the link on to them.<br> <br>Thanks<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br> <br>-matt<br> </tt>
