<div class="span8">
<p>OK, you know already <em>the</em> big news of the week, don't you ?
This report will tell you what happened behind the scenes of the 5.8.0
final releasing.</p>
<p><h2>Module upgrades</h2>
<p>Russ Allbery released new versions of <code>Term::ANSIColor</code> (1.05) and of
<code>podlators</code> (1.23), with documentation changes only, which were promptly
assimilated.</p>
<p>
<h2>.pmc files</h2>
<p>Nick Ing-Simmons found an old, unused feature that was deeply burried into
the perl code : when loading a module via <code>use</code> or <code>require</code>, perl
checks whether there's a<nobr> <wbr></nobr><code>.pmc</code> file along the<nobr> <wbr></nobr><code>.pm</code> file, and newer; if
it finds it, it gets loaded in place of the<nobr> <wbr></nobr><code>.pm</code>. This was intended to
be used by the byteloader, but apparently isn't used at all (unless
something was missed.) Anyway it was too late to remove it.</p>

<p>
<h2>Working on the bug database</h2>
<p>The perlbug database has switched from the old perlbug system to a new
system running Request Tracker (at <em> <a href="http://rt.perl.org/perlbug/">http://rt.perl.org/perlbug/</a> </em>). The new
system will probably need a few weeks of tuning before it finds a stable
state. It's worth nothing that bug ids (now known as ticket numbers) have
changed -- the new system converting them internally.</p>
<p>Many thanks to Robert Spier, Jesse Vincent, Robert Foley, and to everyone
that works (and has worked) on implementing and improving the bug report
system ! Quoting Jarkko, <em>it's a very thankless task</em>, and it's one of
the key elements in successful software projects.</p>
<p>Robert Spier and Ask Bjoern Hansen also built
<em> <a href="http://dev.perl.org/perl5/">http://dev.perl.org/perl5/</a> </em> that now centralizes the Perl 5 development
resources.</p>

<p>
<h2>Insure</h2>
<p>Aaron J Mackey built perl RC 3 with Insure (a tool to check memory access
and leaks). As he summarized the results : <em>in short: not too bad</em>.
Nevertheless, some of the points he uncovered will need some checking in
the future.</p>

<p>
<h2>A PerlIO bug</h2>
<p>Marcel Gruenauer found a new bug in the PerlIO system, related to stacking
the <code>via</code> and the <code>scalar</code> layers. Apparently, something like</p>
<pre>
    open my $fh, &quot;&gt;:scalar:via(QuotedPrint)&quot;, \$x or die $!;</pre>
<p>didn't work as intended. This buglet was promptly fixed by Nick Ing-Simmons.</p>
<p>Moreover Elizabeth Mattijsen found a workaround -- postponing the push of
the <code>via</code> layer makes this example work<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:</p>
<pre>
    open( my $fh, &quot;&gt;&quot;, \$x );           # equivalent to &quot;&gt;:scalar&quot;
    binmode( $fh,&quot;:via(QuotedPrint)&quot; );</pre>

<p>
<h2>PerlIO and MacPerl line endings</h2>
<p>Chris Nandor, maintainer of MacPerl, asked about the better way to add
support for programs with MacOS-style end of lines : a straight
modification of the tokenizer, or a<nobr> <wbr></nobr><code>:mac</code> PerlIO layer ? Gurusamy
Sarathy and Nick Ing-Simmons said that modifying the tokenizer is probably
best done by using the source filter hook that is already in place. But
Chris decided to work on a PerlIO-based solution, that will be in MacPerl
5.8.0 (and hopefully in Perl 5.8.1).</p>

<p>
<h2>About the maintenance releases</h2>
<p>Sarathy said that <em>there will be a 5.6.2 at some point, but I don't care
to speculate on when. I foresee no urgency for a 5.6.2 if 5.8.0 turns out
to be the high quality release all of us expect it to be.</em> </p>
<p>Chip Salzenberg began to work on a new maintenance release of the 5.005
branch, aimed at keeping it buildable with modern systems and compilers.
Welcome back to Perl development, Chip !</p>

<h2>The pumpking is dead, long live the pumpking !</h2>
<p> <em>I can see the light at the end of the tunnel... or is it the oncoming
upset dragon?</em> -- Jarkko Hietaniemi</p>
<p>Now that Perl 5.8.0 has been released, Jarkko will now be able to get some
well-deserved vacation. Kudos to him for his unbelievable amount of work,
his helpfulness, his competence, his professionalism, and his humor.
Jarkko, this was a pleasure to work with you.</p>
<p>The pumpking for the 5.9 development branch is Hugo van der Sanden,
who says<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:</p>
<blockquote><div> <em>I'll be in San Diego for the next week, so don't expect anything
much during that time. Please start thinking off-list about what
should go into 5.9; the lists will be opened when I get back.</em> </div></blockquote>
<p>
<h2>Do hashes waste memory ?</h2>
<p>Chip Salzenberg, working on 5.005_04, discovered an apparent memory waste
on hash buckets allocation. This suboptimal memory allocation is still
present in perl 5.8.0, for perls built without <code>-Dusemymalloc</code> or without
the C preprocessor symbol <code>STRANGE_MALLOC</code> (that you should define
yourself, as it is never set by <code>Configure</code>.)</p>
<p>Chip suggested to build perl with <code>-DSTRANGE_MALLOC</code> when perl's malloc
isn't used. Nick Clark ran a benchmark and this option doesn't seem to
increase perl's speed ; but the memory usage should go down significantly
in programs that use large hashes or lots of hashes. What's missing is a
benchmark that outputs comprehensive memory stats.</p>

<p>
<h2>About the <code>sort</code> pragma</h2>
<p>Michael G Schwern pointed a small inaccuracy in the docs for the <code>sort</code>
pragma. John P Linderman (expert in sorting), while trying to improve
those docs, realized that the interface to this pragma was rather minimal
and threw up a couple of new options in its import and unimport methods.</p>
<p> <a href="http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2002-07/msg01176.html">http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2002-07/msg01176.html</a> </p>
<p>
<h2>defined or</h2>
<p>Brent Dax submitted a patch that adds the<nobr> <wbr></nobr><code>//</code>,<nobr> <wbr></nobr><code>//=</code> and <code>err</code>
operators to Perl 5. As you know if you've read the Apocalypses, these
operators are borrowed from Perl 6. As Brent puts it in the doc part of
his patch :<nobr> <wbr></nobr><code>//</code> [...] is <em>exactly the same as <code>||</code>, except that it
tests the left hand side's definedness instead of its truth.</em> </p>
<p>As this patch adds new ops, various tweaks are necessary to the rest of
perl to make it work flawlessly ; Brent provided an assorted patch to
<code>B::Deparse</code>, and pointed out that the <code>Opcode</code> and <code>Safe</code> modules may
need some work.</p>
