<p>The <a href="//use.perl.org/topics.shtml">topic images</a> on use Perl; mostly really suck.  Please make me new ones.  Be mindful of the size, and make them transparent where appropriate.  I suppose PNG is probably OK (anyone, please tell me if their browsers don't do PNG well these days), and GIF and JPEG are acceptable as well.

<p>I reserve the right to reject your topic images, and maybe we'll have votes (ha!) for competing images.  Some of the images are OK in my opinion, like Python, Tcl, The Conway Channel<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... it's pretty obvious which ones don't need replacing in many cases.  The ones that have a camel because we couldn't come up with anything else pretty much all need replacing.

</p><p>So help me, those who are graphically inclined.  I suck at this sort of thing, and we could really use improved topic images here.</p></p>

Maybe throw together an index page with the
good and the bad so noted?  Give people an
idea what you're looking for.

I don't feel the images are all that useful anyway.  I turned them off on day 1.
<p>
If the images were updated on a frequent basis (like every day &nbsp;:), then I might find them entertaining and leave them on.

But if you consider them as eye-candy to draw in new users, go ahead.

Yeah, I agree.  What Icons?<br> <p>I always go to "Light" mode on Slash sites.  I really prefer the clean look of content, without somebody else's idea of visual design.  I wish all sites had a "Light" mode.  It's the way the Web was meant to be.<br> </p><p>

<h2>commentary on existing icons</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/n1vux/">n1vux</a> on 2002-07-09T19:09:22</h3>
<p>I'd say most of the existing icons only need to have <b>WHITE</b> set to Transparent to be useful. (Might be able to just close some sections that only have 1..3 posts in 'em though.)
</p>
<ul>
<li> <b>Events</b> -- Good concept, busy background
<br>Maybe the Events icon could have the sky airbrushed to <b>transparent</b>. Otherwise a conflagration of camels seems quite appropriate.</li>
<li> <b>Modules</b> -- could use something <i>Different</i>. Maybe Camels stacked like elephants on a tortoise? How do you draw a modular camel?  Camels with Lego-like attachment points?</li>
<li> <b>Perl 6</b> -- ??
<br>If Perl is a camel, what is Perl 6? Maybe a camel with racing number 6 on the saddle?</li>
<li> <b>TCL</b> -- Keep (but)<br> It is considered poor icon practice to use monolinguistic oral puns to get connotation in visual language. And since Tickle-me-Elmo refers indirectly through a specific spinoff product, this is really a reach. But it's marvellous, so I woulnd't change it even though it's WRONG. &nbsp;;-)</li>
<li> <b>Python</b> -- Keep.<br>At least this is not a linguistic pun, but an actual reference to the non-animal source of the name. Keep.</li>
<li> <b>Release </b>-- how about a camel escaping from a gate? <br>[<i> A Railfan magazine just ran a picture of a camel being lead off a RBB&amp;B Circus Train car, not sure if it would reduce to an icon nicely.</i>]</li>
<li> <b>Windows</b> -- Less contentious than &nbsp;/. 's. Keep.</li>
<li> <b>Llama</b> -- Why not? <br> Should have a Learning Perl section with a Llama icon!</li>
<li> <b>Unix</b> -- OK <br>Existing is probably better than using an Ox or harem-guard. &nbsp;;-) [modulo transparency, but then Unix isn't very]</li>

<h2>Elmo</h2>

<p>I'm sooo slow.  (Witness my response to <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/jdavidb/journal/6068" title="perl.org">the really good pun about "faster than C" during Damian's Time::Space::Continuum talk</a perl.org>.)  It took me about a month of reading use Perl; to get the pun involved with Elmo and TCL.</p>

<p>I had always pronounced "Tee Cee Ell," so it wasn't immediately apparent.  I thought the icon was saying TCL was a Sesame Street language. &nbsp;:)</p>

I would strongly suggest to dump all references to camels and llama's. Yes I'm still pissed off at O'Reilly for their [IMO] ridiculous attitude with regards to the association between a camel and Perl.<p>Dump the lot. I don't want it any more. We don't need it.</p>

<h2>Size of images</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/alessio/">alessio</a> on 2002-07-10T08:11:03</h3>
One problem I see is that all icons should have a similar size. I usually use a simple script that acts as a wrapper to imagemagick and rearranges all icons to a fixed area value. An icon can then be taller or wider than the others, but they look the same size.<br> <br>This thing looks very obvious on the topic list page.



<h2>Transparency</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/octo/">octo</a> on 2002-07-10T08:21:42</h3>
<p>While I love transparency in PNGs and I love seeing other webmasters to turn to PNG and use it's features, there still is a downside. Namely that few browsers just don't have propper support for it. This is true for Opera (all versions before 6), Netscape 4.x and (of course..) MSIE (up to the highest version, AFAIK). You can check wether your browser has propper <em>transparency</em> support for PNGs by checking out this <a href="http://entropymine.com/jason/testbed/pngtrans/" title="entropymine.com">Transparency Test</a entropymine.com> [entropymine.com].</p>
<p>But as for most bugs (or features?) in MSIE there is a workaround. In this particular case there's more than one, but the easiest do accomplish is certainly saving a background-image with the PNG. This can be done very easyly with the GIMP and helps a lot, since lots of browsers don't do <em>real</em> transparency, but they have full alpha blending relative to the image's background.</p>
<p>Just something I wanted to note just so you don't get into this &quot;won't run in IE, so I won't use this&quot; position..</p>
<p>Regards,<br>
-octo</p>

<h2>Re:Transparency</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/n1vux/">n1vux</a> on 2002-07-12T16:40:14</h3>
So IE only works with PNG transparency at 4bit color, which is what truely iconic icons always used in the old days, and probably SHOULD still be using anyway, if they're really icons and not miniature JPEGs.  So maybe the Camel crowd scene can't stay photo-reallistic and have transparency<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... unless someone photoshops it to use a real old GIF format.

<h2>BSD daemon</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Silver/">Silver</a> on 2002-07-11T21:38:20</h3>
Not exactly relevant, but looking at the page of images made me think of it:  There's a (defunct) place in the mall called (IIRC) Cin City, which apparently sold cinnamon rolls and cookies and things.  I'm going to have to get a picture of their signage before it gets taken down, because their logo is the BSD daemon with a chef's hat and, I think, a cinnamon roll on his pitchfork. The first time I saw it, I had one of those "That's familiar, but so out of place I can't figure out why" moments.
