Having just read thru perldelta, that looks like a huge body of work.  Of course, now ever Perl author is scurrying off to check that their code still works under 5.8!<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)

Great job on compatibility, for my very complex application (Interchange) worked flawlessly once all the modules were updated. This was the easiest of the major releases to update for -- and I have done from 5.003 all the way up.</p>

<h2>New PODs in 5.8.0</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jdavidb/">jdavidb</a> on 2002-07-19T18:02:12</h3>
<p>I suddenly remembered that every time there's a new Perl release,
there's a whole slew of new documentation that makes me a better Perl
programmer.  I decided to go hunting and diffing between<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/usr/local/perl561/lib/5.6.1/pod and<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/usr/local/perl580/lib/5.8.0/pod
to see what's new.  Many of you have no doubt known about these for a
long time, but I don't read p5p, so they're new to me.</p>

<p>New PODs in 5.8.0:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>perl561delta.pod</li>
<li>perl56delta.pod</li>
<li>perl570delta.pod</li>
<li>perl571delta.pod</li>
<li>perl572delta.pod</li>
</ul>
What changed in all the releases since 5.6.
</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>perlapollo.pod</li>
<li>perlbeos.pod</li>
<li>perlce.pod: perl on WinCE (new)</li>
<li>perldgux.pod (new)</li>
<li>perlfreebsd.pod (new, surprisingly)</li>
<li>perlhurd.pod (not new, surprisingly)</li>
<li>perlirix.pod (new)</li>
<li>perlmint.pod</li>
<li>perlnetware.pod (new)</li>
<li>perlplan9.pod</li>
<li>perlqnx.pod</li>
<li>perltru64.pod</li>
<li>perluts.pod (new)</li>
</ul>
Various OSes have their README files available with perldoc after
installation now.  I'd love to know what all these are (I know what
most are), but some of them I've never heard of and will never use.  I
tried to note which ones were new (all the old ones were previously
available as README.platform in the perl-5.6.1 source directory).
Several of the README.platforms from 5.6.1 don't seem to have wound up
in my installed PODs directory, like README.solaris and README.dos.  I
wonder what the pattern is.
</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>perlcn.pod</li>
<li>perljp.pod</li>
<li>perlko.pod</li>
<li>perltw.pod</li>
</ul>
These little gems seem to really mess up my GNOME terminals.  I
presume they have something to do with internationalization.  There is
little comprehensible text in them when viewed through perldoc.
</li>
<li>perlintro.pod: new introductory guide to Perl by Kirrily "Skud."
I've been seeing a need for this for awhile; great addition!</li>
<li>perliol.pod: C API for Perl's new IO layers</li>
<li>perlmodstyle.pod: Best practices for writing modules</li>
<li>perlothrtut.pod: tutorial for the old, deprecated threads.  That
must mean that...</li>
<li>perlthrtut.pod, which didn't show up on my diff, is a tutorial for
the new threads.  Hooray!  Now I can go back and show up my
distributed systems professor!</li>
<li>perlpacktut.pod: using binary data in Perl (pack)</li>
<li>perlpodspec.pod: the once and for all specification for POD, until
it changes</li>

<li>
<p>perltooc.pod =&gt; perltootc.pod</p>
<p>Mysteriously renamed, or else it's a mistake.  See, if you people used
CVS instead of that OTHER version control software, these kinds of
things would never happen.  Seriously, I can't see what this will do
for us other than to confuse people on IRC when they are pointed to
documentation they don't have.  But I don't read p5p, so I'm sure
there's a logical reason.</p>
</li>

<li>perluniintro.pod: now you finally know how to use all those great
new unicode features that have been arriving since 5.6</li> </ul>

<p>That's what I suspected, but no such changes seemed to have happened with any of the other long POD filenames, like perlthrtut.</p>

So perltootc.pod becomes perltoot.pod and you have a problem, one will usually overwrite the other.  So the problem isn't with filenames being to long, it's with long filenames truncating to the same short name.<br> <br>perlthrtut.pod doesn't have this problem.  If there was, say, a perlthrtenaciousd.pod, then there would be problems (8.3 filesystems would be the least of them).<br>

Which mythical OSes and filesystems would these be, then?
<p>
I've always thought that the whole 8.3 issue is a red herring; Perl can't run on MS-DOS, and MS-DOS is one of the very few 8.3 filesystems left on the planet.</p>

<p>perldelta explains the perltooc.</p>

<p>If you didn't get perlsolaris, perldos, and so forth, something went wrong in your installation.  I sure do get them.  All README.$platform pods get installed as perl$platform.pod.</p>

<p>If the README.{cn,jp,ko,tw} mess up your terminal, change your terminal.  If your terminal would not wimp out, you would see the the first lines of the pod telling the Eastern Asian encoding they are in.
After that, you need to know how to read Chinese/Japanese/Korean.  I sure don't<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>

<p>Your CVS quip I almost resisted replying to, but I failed... CVS is in many ways technically inferior compared with Perforce, that's why Perforce is being used.
If all you want is to read the changes, there's a mailing list, perl5-changes@perl.org, see either perlhack.pod or lists.perl.org.</p>

<p>I hope my tone wasn't mistaken.  There wasn't any criticism implied.  Especially about CVS.  In fact the CVS comment was a joke about CVS's abilities; the joke is that with CVS renaming a file is made so difficult that you would "never" have been able to rename the file.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<p>BTW, I thought you would be sleeping the whole release cycle off, now.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)  Thanks for a job well done.</p>

Just for the record, in Perforce renaming is done like this:
<p>
<code>
p4 integate -i oldfile newfile<br>
p4 delete oldfile<br>
p4 submit<br>
</code>
</p><p>
To rename directories, replace <tt>oldfile</tt> with <tt>oldpath/...</tt> and <tt>newfile</tt> to <tt>newpath/...</tt>.
</p><p>
Whether that sucks or not is largely a amtter of personal preference.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>

Now the CVS developers know that it can be done, I'm sure they'll be tripping over themselves to implement it. [Not<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-(]
