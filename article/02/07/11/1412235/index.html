<p>cwest writes <i>"For those of you attending the Perl Conference 6 (or Open Source Convention), there is a golden opportunity to get some free coaching
and consultation on your work.  A Birds-of-a-Feather session on '<a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/pub/w/15/bof.html#thursday">Perl
Mentoring/Code Reviews</a>' will be given for the third year running.  Some top Perl People will be on hand as resident experts to advise
you on your own Perl projects.
</i><blockquote><div><i>
Date:  Thursday 7/25<br>
Time: 7:00pm - 9:00pm<br>
Location: Grande Ballroom A in the East Tower"</i>
</div></blockquote></p>
<p><i>"Here's how it works: You bring some Perl code (ideally at most 3 pages,
as a printout, or on a laptop, handheld, or floppy) and receive
specific advice which might normally cost a large amount of money in
consulting fees.  Feel free to ask for advice on anything from style to efficiency.
</i><p><i>
This is *one-on-one* coaching: No spectators, no audience, no
distractions; just personal mentoring, targeted to your
specific application, from some of the best people qualified to give it.
</i></p><p><i>
Time spent with the expert will depend on supply and demand."</i></p></p>

<p>Dan Sugalski very kindly sat down an explained much of the parrot internals to me during last year's session. Although I have yet to go very deeply into parrot, Dan's mentoring did a lot to reduce my anxiety about at least playing with the project (thank you!). No matter what your skill level is, do drop by this event. You will get something useful out of it.</p>

I'll be there again this year, time willing. It's fun, and nice to be able to help people in person.
