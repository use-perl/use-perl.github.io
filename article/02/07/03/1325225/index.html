The Perl nominees are Michael Schwern, Matt Sergeant, Michael Peppler, Damian Conway and Bill Luebkert.  Unfortunately you also have to vote for the Tcl, Python, PHP and XSLT programmer and given that the respective communities know little about each other, this seems to make the results a bit of a lottery."</i><nobr> <wbr></nobr>... except that Matt Sergeant was also nominated for XSLT.

<h2>Anyone know the LEAST qualified in the others?</h2>

It'd be an interesting social experiment to say "If you're going to make vote on people I know nothing about, I'll make the least informed decision possible".<br> <br>Maybe that might convince AS to fix the broken logic in their present voting scheme. &nbsp;;-)



<h2>Also...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/davorg/">davorg</a> on 2002-07-03T15:30:39</h3>
<p>Note that Damian has <a href="http://use.perl.org/comments.pl?sid=6688&amp;cid=10186" title="perl.org">asked</a perl.org> ActiveState to remove his name from the list.</p>

<h2>Re:Also...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Damian/">Damian</a> on 2002-07-03T22:02:20</h3>
And ActiveState has subsequently asked me *not* to remove myself:<br> <br> <blockquote><div> <br>Agreed that as far as Perl heroes go you're about as named as they come &nbsp;:) The number of nominations you received easily attests to that.<br> <br>'Unnamed heroes' was a poor phrase to use in reference to the nominees. Most of the finalists this year are quite well known in their specific communities.<br> <br>We've removed it from the site and made note not to reference it in subsequent Active Awards.<br> <br>Still, the spirit of the nomination is the same. Your peers have selected you for this honor, and ActiveState certainly views you as eligible.<br> <br>We hope sincerely that you'll reconsider removing your name from the ballot.<br> </div></blockquote> <br> <br>So, out of respect for the people who took the trouble to nominate me, I shall stay nominated. I don't expect it makes much difference, since this concerted pro-Schwern, vote-early, vote-often campaign will surely seal the result anyway<nobr> <wbr></nobr><tt>;-)</tt>

<h2>Fixed</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Matts/">Matts</a> on 2002-07-03T18:43:53</h3>
I just got a reply from ActiveState. The voting is now fixed so you can just pick one category if you want to.
