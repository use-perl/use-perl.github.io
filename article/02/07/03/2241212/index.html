<div class="span8">
<p><a href="http://yetanother.org/dan/">Dan</a> writes <i>"First, and most importantly, the grants have been a huge
success. Damian was funded for eighteen months, Larry for six, and
Dan* for six. We raised over $200K total in the two grant
years, in tough economic times, with a large portion of that coming
from individuals. That's damned impressive. That we haven't raised
sufficient funds to cover all three grants for the full year is
unfortunate, but not a failure."</i></p>
<p><i>"Secondly, be aware that this is not official.  Official word has
to come from the YAS board members (Kevin Lenzo, Kurt De Maagd, and Nat
Torkington). This is from the perspective of a grantee, though that
does have more access than you might get from the outside.**

Unfortunately, like it or not, the grant fund is close to empty. That
means steps have to be taken, since we all like to eat and have
families to support, and planning
for the future helps with that.

</i><p><i>
<b>Current Plans</b>
</i></p><p><i>
There's some cash in the pipeline. The current plan is to dedicate the
first $20K of that cash to hiring a professional grant writer, with
any excess (up to the pending grant amount) going to fund Larry. This
is a reasonable and good thing. Perl 6 and Parrot development does
dovetail nicely with what a number of government agencies and
companies want, but getting that money is both time consuming and a
bit dicey. A professional grant writer knows what to do and where to
go, as well as the hoops to jump through. It's money well-spent, which
should ensure the long-term viability of both the development grants
and The Perl Foundation.

</i></p><p><i>
<b>Grantee status</b>
</i></p><p><i>
Damian is done as a grantee. He's had an 18 month run and, by his own
choice as well as circumstances, has gone solo. As Kevin put it at the
YAPC::NA 2002 town meeting, 'He's reached escape velocity.' This is a
cool thing. Circumstances willing, Damian is more than happy to
continue on as much as he can with Perl 6 development.
</i></p><p><i>
Dan's grant is up at the end of July (having started at the beginning
of February rather than January) and, barring a massive influx of
funds quickly, that will be that. Like Damian, Dan is also willing to
do as much as possible with Parrot development, again circumstances
willing.
</i></p><p><i>
Larry's grant is up at the end of June, but he's willing and able to
let things go for a bit before other measures must be taken. There
should be sufficient funds, if some promised things are followed
through on, to let him go on for a while past that, and fundraising
will hopefully get him to the end of this year's grant.

</i></p><p><i>
<b>How can you help?</b>
</i></p><p><i>
<a href="https://donate.perl-foundation.org/index.pl?node=Contribution+Info">Donations</a>
to the <a href="http://perl-foundation.org/">Perl Foundation</a> are
always welcome. This is A Good Thing.
</i></p><p><i>
Damian and Dan both do training classes, and Dan does consulting
work.*** If your company is unwilling to do a general
donation to the foundation, hire one of them to train, speak at, or
do work for your company. This is often an easier sell than a plain
donation. (Though unless sufficient consulting/training comes through
in the next few weeks, Dan will get a full-time job and likely pass on
the Parrot Design Hat.)

</i></p><p><i>
<b>Future Plans</b>
</i></p><p><i>
YAS's**** plans for next year have yet to be made, though
announcements should come within the next few months. Things are
looking up, more or less, economically, so that should be a help. (The
framework and hard-won experience from the past two cycles of fundraising will
help guide things.)

</i></p><p><i>
*You'll pardon me for talking in the third person here.
<br>
**It's possible that this will all turn up wrong, but it's
best information at the moment
<br>
***Yes, this is somewhat self-serving but, being really
blunt, training and consulting work both pay sufficiently well that we
can eat, provide for our families, and still work on perl. Full-time
jobs don't have that level of flexibility, nor do they provide
sufficient free time.
<br>
****Note for the grammar weenies: yes, the apostrophe is
appropriate there. YAS is an acronym."</i></p></p>

<h2>Why pass on the design hat?</h2>

<blockquote><div>(Though unless sufficient consulting/training comes through in the next few weeks, Dan will get a full-time job and likely pass on the Parrot Design Hat.)</div></blockquote>

<p>I can't see that Dan passing on the design hat is a good thing. I fear parrot could lose consistency of design if someone else has to pick things up with some major things (eg the extension API) still not fleshed out. Particularly as anyone taking over hasn't got access to all the undocumented bits in Dan's head.</p>

<p>In the worst case scenario ($60,000 isn't dontated to YAS in the next 30 days, <b>and</b> Dan doesn't get enough consulting/training), I'd hope that some sort of hat-loan arrangement occurs instead, where  Dan stays on as chief architect, overseeing the design and ensuring it retains the consistency it currently has, but design of sections is delegated out.</p>

<p>Ultimately, it's Dan's decision, and whatever he chooses to do next, I'd like to thank him for the hard work he's already put in.</p>

I'm trying to scribble down notes on everything pending, so there's at least some sort of framework to go from. (One of the reasons for the opcode docs &nbsp;:) Hopefully it'll be sufficient if it becomes necessary.<br>

Hopefully it won't come to this. <a href="http://www.ntk.net/2002/07/05" title="ntk.net">This week's NTK</a ntk.net> has "please donate to perl" as its top story. I've no idea how much extra this publicity will actually raise, but NTK has quite a lot of readers, so it's no bad thing. We shall see.

Heh. I'd never run across NTK before. Not sure it'll <i>help</i>, but... &nbsp;:) (Almost like seeing <a href="http://www.theonion.com/" title="theonion.com">The Onion</a theonion.com> running public service announcements)

<h2>So, did the slashdot effect</h2>

from <a href="http://developers.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=02/07/06/1556223" title="slashdot.org">this</a slashdot.org> story generate many more donations ??<br> <br>I notice "use Perl;" groaned under the weight, but seemed to keep going.<br> <br>--<br>T<br>

OK, so I'm sad enough to answer my own post, a quick process of the <a href="https://donate.perl-foundation.org/index.pl?node_id=305" title="perl-foundation.org">donations page</a perl-foundation.org> to sort by date shows (story posted on slashdot on the 6th):<br> <br>2002-07-02 : 4<br>2002-07-03 : 2<br>2002-07-04 : 7<br>2002-07-05 : 4<br>2002-07-06 : 4<br>2002-07-07 : 1<br>2002-07-08 : 61<br>2002-07-09 : 25<br> <br>So allowing for normal levels, I'd guess 70 or so slashdot-inspired donations so far &nbsp;... more people donated than trolled the story &nbsp;... got to be a healthy sign...<br> <br>

FWIW, I was stupid and linked the Slashdot story to a dynamic page instead of a static one.  Oopsie.  It still handled it OK, but when I changed the Slashdot link to a static page, things improved.
