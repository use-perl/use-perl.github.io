No, not Hugo van der Sanden, who hopefully everyone knows is taking on the task of 5.9 and 5.10. No, I'm talking about the inimitable Michael Schwern, who's now holder of the perl 1 pumpkin and, I'm assured, is well on the way to a new maintenance release. Details are over on <a href="http://dev.perl.org/perl1/">dev.perl.org</a>. Join the porters list and help Schwern out!"</i>  Yes, he said "perl 1".</p>

 <p> Okay, you guys win the award for least informative communication in English since Stallman tried to explain the definition of "free software."  I saw this yesterday, and today I still have no idea what it's about. </p>

Chip is taking over pumpkingship of 5.005_03 to make a new version (5.005_04) that doesn't break with more modern compilers. <p> Schwern is doing pretty much the same thing with perl1 from 1988. </p><p> No, no one is using perl1 on a production system, but this makes it easier for someone like Damian to backport Perligata to perl1.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>

 <p> I was glad to hear what Chip's doing; after all, we all know there's still a maintainer for the Linux 2.0 and 2.2 kernels.  And I figured that's what Schwern was doing. </p>  <p> Anyone up for grabbing Perls 2, 3, and 4?  4 was a nice little language, although I'd hate for anyone to have an excuse to continue to program in it today.  (Still upset at a professor from two years ago who told me Perl wasn't object oriented.  Way too much out of date info out there.  At least I made his eyes bulge out when I told him Perl could do "factory classes" and everything a Java mobile agent could do.) </p>

<h2>Could be useful</h2>

Does anyone have an overview of the basic functionality that Perl 1 provided? <p> Wouldn't Perl 1 be useful as something to port to a small memory embedded system?  Eg a toaster?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) </p><p> Call it 'micro-perl'. </p><p> <i>No, my Palm M100 doesn't run Perl 5.8.0, but it runs micro-perl.</i></p>

A good idea maybe. I wonder wich Perl version would be the most convenient (with regard to usability &amp; stability vs. weight) to look into for such a 'micro-perl'.<br> <br>Maybe even a stripped down version of Perl 5 or 6 (or even parrot ?) would do...<br> <br>I also wonder where to get those ancient Perls from? CPAN?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)<br> <br>Whaddayathink?

<a href="http://www.samag.com/documents/s=1272/sam05030003/" title="samag.com">TPJ article about microperl</a samag.com> from a couple of years ago. Didn't work on the Palm, the tokenizer's too big.

Yes, I remembered that.  It's based on 5.7.0.  The point of my asking what was the feature set of 1.x was whether 1.x would be actually useful, assuming that 1.x is so small that it could be ported to small systems easier that 5.7.0 did.<br> <br>Maybe 1.x was just a sed+awk+regex+shell language and nothing more.  I don't know.

<h2>modules</h2>

 <p> Out of curiosity, is Schwern going to port Test::Simple and friends to perl 1? </p>

WOW, this news system is really cool... Could you send the perl to: support@cyberfics.com plz?



<h2>Re:modules</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/chromatic/">chromatic</a> on 2002-08-02T05:13:43</h3>
 <p> First, I think we need to port it to Perl 6.  (Strangely enough, the test suite for Perl 1 has a lot of the good stuff already.  Larry amazes me.) </p>

 <p> Thanks!  That produced a cute little 122501 byte perl 1 on my machine.  (Stripped: 111152). </p>  <p> Didn't notice the crypt thing until later; take note that this required setting LDFLAGS = -lcrypt in the Makefile.  (There are other ways.) </p>  <p> I also commented out the entire section in Configure looking for the preprocessor and just set cpp=/usr/bin/cpp and cppminus='' .  The test was expecting the string "abc.xyz" to be in the output but was getting "abc . xyz" . </p>
