Sam must be cursing me. I change the look of search, just before his book is published<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

Yup!  If it had happened just a couple weeks earlier I would have had time to reshoot it...
<p>
Actually, I'm overjoyed at how much better search.cpan.org has been working since the change.  Excellent work!

<h2>cpanplus</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/2shortplanks/">2shortplanks</a> on 2002-08-13T14:36:23</h3>
I see the first chapter shows how to install a CPAN module with CPAN.pm...though there's no mention of CPANPLUS.  I was wondering why this is?  Was CPANPLUS's development too late to be included, or was is left out for simplicity, or for some other reason?<br>

You guessed it.  I wrote chapter one almost exactly a year ago.  I thought about going back and adding a sidebar or a footnote but in the end there just wasn't time.

<h2>packrats</h2>

<p>I see the sample chapter mentions the perlpackrats mailing list was active from 1993 until 1996, more or less replaced by CPAN.  Yesterday I thought I heard hfb <a href="http://use.perl.org/comments.pl?sid=7633&amp;cid=11617" title="perl.org">mention the packrats list</a perl.org> was still active as a group collecting items of historical note.  Is this the same group, or two groups with a different name?</p>

<p>I've always had an acute interest in history.  I'm the one who always wanted to know who discovered an algorithm or coded a program and why, even more than wanting to know how it works.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

I believe hfb made an attempt to restart packrats some time back, but looking at the archives it didn't look like it succeeded.  Certainly the mailing-list did end in 1996 although it may have risen from the grave more recently.  I'll be happy to put in an errata about it if someone would be so kind as to point me to subscription instructions.
<p>
Thanks,<br>

Thanks.  This will go in the errata as soon as I get a few more errors together.
<p>
Actually, I now realize that I've seen this page before.  I looked in the archives to determine whether the list was live and decided that it wasn't.  Looking again I'm forced to conclude the same, but perhaps pointing interested people to it will change that.

<h2>other chapters?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/gav/">gav</a> on 2002-08-14T00:02:10</h3>
Is there any chance that other chapters would be released? I'd like to see a more indepth topic.
<p>
How does CGI::Application fits in with the rest of the book? It seems a bit out of place.</p>



<blockquote>

<h2>Re:other chapters?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/samtregar/">samtregar</a> on 2002-08-14T14:51:19</h3>
I don't think there will be any more PDF releases, although it's possible I'll adapt a chapter as an article at some point.
<p>
However, I'll be happy to explain the CGI::Application tie-in.  CGI::Application is a module that allows you to build CGI programs as Perl modules.  Given this ability it is now possible to build reusable CGI programs and release them on CPAN for all to enjoy.  See CGI::Application::MailPage for my proof-of-concept.  It's not what I would call "core material" but it is an area where I think CPAN could grow in the future.

<h2>Just wondering...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/hsmyers/">hsmyers</a> on 2002-08-14T02:09:28</h3>
I've got it on order, but I was wondering if there was any information about how to do more advanced things than a simple module. For instance one of mine builds three Berkeley DB's from CSV files and I had a hell of a time figuring out how to do that in a cross-platform way-- I'd like to seem more along these lines...<br/><br/>--hsm

<h2>Re:Just wondering...</h2>

The book definitely covers more than just simple modules.  Tying, overloading and OO are all covered.  So is generating methods with Class::Struct and Class::MethodMaker.  I also cover cross-platform module-building techniques, although I don't know if I hit on any of the problems you faced.
