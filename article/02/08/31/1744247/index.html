<h2>Recent experience with CPAN/ports</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/samtregar/">samtregar</a> on 2002-08-31T21:05:36</h3>
While working on a 5.8.0 threading experiment I had the idea to test my program under Windows, figuring that it might uncover some unportable assumptions in my use of threads.  So I headed over to ActiveState.com only to discover that ActivePerl isn't running 5.8.0 yet.  Next stop, CPAN/ports, where I encountered a similar situation.  Shouldn't we provide a pre-built binary of 5.8.0 for Windows?  I'm sure I'm not alone in running my Windows systems without a compiler installed!
<p>
If there's a general lesson in this, I guess it's that we need to keep our ports up-to-date if they're to be generally useful.

</cite>

<p>
Ahhh, okay.  Let's clear one misconception away: <b>we</b> (as we the CPAN) don't provide any of the builds.  Other people do.  Either via their PAUSE accounts, or external sites, or in some rare cases CPAN hosts a copy of  a binary directly under the CPAN/ports/ (usually when the user does not have the disk space or a public server to host the binary themselves).
</p>

<p>In other words: the Ports is a metaservice.</p>

<p>In other words: Win32 Perl 5.8.0 will appear there as soon as someone (ActiveState, or anybody else) builds one and someone tells us the CPAN of it.</p>

Sorry, I should have been clearer.  By "we" I meant the CPAN author community.  I realize the people that run CPAN don't create the ports themselves.

Your comment was useful, though, we've (the CPAN hive mind, that is) got that question before.  I added clarification on that now.<br> <br>

We have a perl-5.8 Win32 binary distribution under
ftp://theoryx5.uwinnipeg.ca/pub/other/, as
perl-5.8-win32-bin.tar.gz. It was compiled with
VC++, and comes with Apache2/mod_perl-2, and a
number of common modules. It unpacks into
Apache2/ and Perl/ subdirectories, with a top-level
INSTALL file.

How stable is this<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/pub/other for the win32 build going to be?  If stable enough (as in: it's not going to go away before 5.8.1 comes out), I could add a link to the ports page.<br>

I intend to have the perl-5.8-win32-bin.tar.gz in
<a href="ftp://theoryx5.uwinnipeg.ca/pub/other/" title="uwinnipeg.ca">
ftp://theoryx5.uwinnipeg.ca/pub/other/</a uwinnipeg.ca>
around for as long as it's useful (probably
at least until ActiveState releases a 5.8 build).
It'll be routinely updated, especially the
Apache-2/modperl-2 side.

<h2>Very effective</h2>

This CPAN page is very well organized. Looking there some time ago for info about where to get the 5.8 release, I who don't have any CS background discovered I could download a GNU compiler that works on Windows and thus install 5.8 without waiting for the binaries. All the instructions were very clear and I installed the compiler and Perl 5.8 with little difficulty. Bravo!
