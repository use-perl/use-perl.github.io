<p>This week, the report comes a little bit earlier than expected,
due to a short schedule. However it will not be shorter -- this week was
rich in events and in discussions about the future of Perl 5.</p>
<p><h2>Experiments with the defined-or operator</h2>
<p>Hugo applied the patch by Brent Dax that introduces the<nobr> <wbr></nobr><code>//</code>, <code>err</code> and<nobr> <wbr></nobr><code>//=</code> operators (defined-or, low-priority defined-or, and defined-or
assignment). H.Merijn Brand seriously thinks <em>about building 5.8.0 with
it and put it production</em>. However this new syntax introduces minor
incompatibilities, so Hugo wants to make it available in the future
through a new pragma <code>use perl6ish</code>.</p>
<p>On this same topic, Chris Reinhardt noticed that <code>shift<nobr> <wbr></nobr>// 0</code> is a syntax
error. In fact, the parser, seeing the tokens <code>shift<nobr> <wbr></nobr>//</code>, can't decide
between <code>shift(//)</code> (the regexp) and <code>shift<nobr> <wbr></nobr>//<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...</code> (the operator). I
suggested that, although difficult to solve in the general case (e.g. with
<code>split</code>), this can be made to work for the <code>shift</code> operator and most
of others. (That's what we call DWIMmery.)</p>
<p>This problem doesn't occur in Perl 6, where<nobr> <wbr></nobr><code>//</code> is not a valid pattern.</p>

<p>
<h2>Improving $^H and %^H</h2>
<p>To implement new pragmas (such as <code>perl6ish</code>) or to make the existing
<code>sort</code> pragma work with lexical scopes, it's necessary to have a
mechanism to retrieve the existing set of pragmas in any scope during the
compilation. This mechanism is currently provided by the <code>$^H</code> and <code>%^H</code>
special variables. But <code>%^H</code> has at least one problem : it's not
propagated to <code>eval &quot;&quot;</code> statements. This has to be fixed.</p>
<p>It would also be handy to access, after the compilation phase, the set of
pragmas a particular op has been compiled with. For example, this could be
useful for the <code>B::</code> modules, or for anything that manipulates the
optree. For the moment, this works only with the <code>integer</code>, <code>strict
'refs'</code>, <code>locale</code> and <code>bytes</code> pragmas (you can for example get them
through the 9th value returned by caller(N)).</p>

<h2>v-strings bite again</h2>
<p>Abigail reported a (known) bug (#16010) : the fat comma doesn't quote
v-strings. Hence</p>
<pre>
    perl -we 'print v65 =&gt; &quot;\n&quot;'</pre>
<p>prints ``A\n'' (at least on ASCII platforms). John Peacock (who knows the
v-strings inner odds and ends, for having worked on them) explained the
root of the problem : the parser immediately converts <code>v65</code> into a string
<code>&quot;A&quot;</code> and there is currently no way to distinguish them after
compilation.</p>
<p>John then supplied quickly a patch to add magic to v-string scalars, so a
copy of the initial string representation is preserved. With this
information in place, it will be probably possible to correct a large part
of the annoyances caused by v-strings.</p>

<p>
<h2>Plans for Perl 5.10</h2>
<p>Arthur Bergman posted a list of ideas for Perl 5.10. Shortly : replace
magic by parrot-like PMCs, provide a strict typing pragma, decrease
general memory overhead, improve threads, and improve the introspection
mechanisms of Perl (e.g. the <code>B::</code> modules). This triggered quite a bit
of comments -- especially about the proposed replacement of the magic
system, used to implement all Perl magic variables, and other things too.</p>
<p>Benjamin Goldberg then dropped some additional ideas of his own : for
example, allow <code>$/</code> to be a regexp. Nicholas Clark added that more tests
can't hurt.</p>

<p>
<h2>Pseudo-hashes</h2>
<p>Michael G Schwern submitted a complete patch to remove pseudo-hashes. With
his patch, places that were using pseudo-hashes (as fields.pm) use the new
(as of 5.8.0) restricted hashes. He added that some future improvements
can be made on the top of his patch. He made also some benchmarking and
noticed (quite surprisingly) no performance improvement ; some more
digging is needed on this, as he previously estimated an average 15%
speedup on hash operations.</p>

<p>Johannes Plass, a pseudo-hash user, wondered if the compile-time checking
features of the current pseudo-hashes will be preserved with the new
implementation of fields.pm and base.pm.</p>

<p>
<h2>In brief</h2>
<p>Dave Mitchell added a new debugging option, <code>-Dv</code>, aimed at making the
other debugging options more verbose. He supplied also a verbose version
of <code>-Ds</code> (to trace stack contents).</p>

<p>Robin Berjon pointed the P5P readers at an entry in Leon Brocard's
use.perl journal, about securing CPAN. Only Andreas Koenig replied, but I
feel that this idea is finding its way in the porters' minds.</p>
<pre>
    <a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=02080502111402.12618%40morgaine">http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=02080502111402.12618%40morgaine</a> </pre>
<p>Tim Bunce suggested that porting XS core modules to <code>Inline::C</code> might
make them more easily portable to Perl 6. Brian Ingerson and Dan Sugalski
disagreed, unless someone defines a compatibility API on top of XS and
Parrot.</p>
<p>The perl5-changes mailing list (where commits to the Perl 5 source
repository are sent) seems to be allergic to Hugo.</p>
<p>A couple of bug reports about gcc 3.1 not being able to build perl 5.6.1
were sent. This is a known problem with gcc 3.1. H.Merijn Brand suggested
to make a patch available on CPAN.</p>
<p>John P. Linderman found that<nobr> <wbr></nobr><code>/.{,3}/</code> is not the same pattern as<nobr> <wbr></nobr><code>/.{0,3}/</code> : the lower bound is not optional. Mark-Jason Dominus says :
<em>It turns out it has been this way since Perl 1.</em> </p>
<p>Vadim Konovalov found a bug in seek/tell when the<nobr> <wbr></nobr><code>:crlf</code> PerlIO layer
is used, and found also the root cause of it (Bug #15986). This was fixed
by Nick Ing-Simmons.</p>
<p>Hugo released the first development snapshot. The smoke tests are up
again.</p>
