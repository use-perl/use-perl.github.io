But I haven't seen a copy since the previous publishers were turning it out, and it wasn't<br>all that hard to find here in Boston then...<br> <br>What about the webified content? Can we get<br>our hands on that and make tpj.perl.org?

Most of the content is available for sale on the SysAdmin CD, and ORA is releasing the Best Of TPJ in three volumes (or was it reduced to two?).<br> <br>I don't understand this, though.  TPJ was essentially a handful (2-3) articles in SysAdmin every three months.  If they are saying they can't afford to have 2-3 Perl articles in SysAdmin every 3 months<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... then THAT is a worse problem than TPJ dying.

<h2>No more TPJ.</h2>

If this is true, then it really is bad news.  All the more reason to get behind the folks at <a href="http://www.theperlreview.com/" title="theperlreview.com">The Perl Review</a theperlreview.com>.  By the way, TPJ back-issue archives are <a href="http://www.sysadminmag.com/tpj/issues/" title="sysadminmag.com">available here</a sysadminmag.com>.  Let's hope they stay available.

I knew it was a bad sign when TPJ disappeared into
the back pages of Sys Admin, and customers kept
looking at me with disbelief when I'd ask if they'd seen <a href="http://teachmeperl.com/tpj_june.gif" title="teachmeperl.com">my company's training ads</a teachmeperl.com> there!
<p>
As I told <b>Jon Orwant</b> himself over Chinese food during <i>YAPC</i>, all us JAPHs owe him a great debt of gratitude for creating this (once) magnificent resource, that was so instrumental in developing our community.  </p><p>Moreover, I'd venture to say
that all readers of contemporary technical literature are similarly indebted to him, for
showing a whole generation of technical editors how their job should be done!</p><p>



<h2>The Archive CD</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/lemon_lysol/">lemon_lysol</a> on 2002-08-19T16:36:32</h3>
Do you think that I should buy the archive CD now or wait and hope for a complete TPJ archive after they cease production?

As a newbie in Perl I found many good articles on TPJ. I just hope somebody can take over the TPJ from CMP might be Oreilly. Don't die TPJ<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:(

I'd noticed that the pagecounts in SysAdmin itself were dwindling, when I came across some <i>x</i> year old copies in the attic, so I guess it isn't shocking.<br/><br/>Still, I just renewed.  Hopefully they'll maintain some decent perl oriented content, even if it isn't highlighted as such.<br/><br/>And onward w/PerlReview!

My <a href="http://www.stonehenge.com/merlyn/UnixReview/" title="stonehenge.com">long-running Perl column</a stonehenge.com> continues to appear there bi-monthly, so don't all cancel your subscriptions just yet, or that's likely to cause me to lose a job as well.  And for many of the past 12 months, my column income has been my <i>only</i> income.

Although loosing Perl Journal portion is tough, I don't see how people would throw the whole mag out.  I take it that many of the Perl hackers around here have to do some sys admin work.  So, the mag is definitely there to stay..<br/><br/>Certainly, the overall number of subscriptions may (and most likely will) fluctuate over the course of a couple centuries, but I hardly doubt the mag itself will cease to exist entirly.  Unless, of course, the pointy-haired bosses insist otherwise<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;/.<br/><br/>As for your articles, [merlyn], I appreciate them quite a bit.  Keep them going...

<h2>Another InfoPoint...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Purdy/">Purdy</a> on 2002-08-18T04:54:44</h3>
I racked up some knowledge on <a href="http://www.tripwire.org/" title="tripwire.org">tripwire</a tripwire.org> and when SysAdmin called for papers on Intrusion Detection, I sent a proposal to introduce tripwire, which didn't make it through the cut.  I haven't received my Intrusion Detection issue yet, but it will be interesting to see what did make the cut.
<p>
I don't understand why they're in dire straights if content is available... perhaps it's a sales/marketing thing.
</p><p>
Either way, this economy situation stinks!

<h2>And just after I renewed for another year</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/pne/">pne</a> on 2002-08-19T10:42:14</h3>
And this comes just after I renewed my subscription for another year, even though it wasn't quite up for renewal yet... I read SA nearly exclusively for TPJ. Bummer.



<blockquote>

<h2>Re:And just after I renewed for another year</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/barryp/">barryp</a> on 2002-08-19T20:12:07</h3>
Yeah<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... I renewed after reading Damian Conway's article on Perl 6 (which appeared in TPJ).  Having a SysAdmin subscription was the only way to ensure the continued flow of articles of this calibre<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... and then TPJ gets canned!  Bummer, indeed.  (However, to be fair, the regular SysAdmin stuff does include its fair share of Perl-related stuff).

<h2>I Really Miss the The Perl Journal</h2>

 I was happy when SysAdmin picked up TPJ, but it<br>
&nbsp; just wasn't the same.  I will continue to get<br>
&nbsp; SysAdmin it is a good resource.  I enjoy reading<br>
&nbsp; my old copies of the TPJ, the printed copies.  The<br>
&nbsp; online ones are good for reference(or if that is<br>
&nbsp; all you can get), but I looked foward to getting <br>
&nbsp; my printed TPJ every Quarter.  Oh well enough   <br>
&nbsp; whinning.  Support the "The Perl Review", maybe<br>
&nbsp; there will be printed versions when the economy <br>
&nbsp; gets better.<br> <br>

<i>The Perl Review</i> can be printed now really---the economy doesn't matter that much.   i just need the money to pay the printers, but i don't want to take a bunch of subscriptions before i know that i can deliver the goods.  that's why i've gone slowly.  Several magazine people assure me that "subscriber" fees can cover printing and mailing costs.  Ad revenues pay for Manhattan offices and employees, neither or which i have right now.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br> <br>i'm experimenting with PayPal donations on a small scale right now.  when i have enough money to pay to print and mail a bunch of issues, the next issue will be printed.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br> <br> <a href="http://www.theperlreview.org/" title="theperlreview.org">http://www.theperlreview.org</a theperlreview.org>
