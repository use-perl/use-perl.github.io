<p>Please, if you feel inclined, make sure some <a href="http://interviews.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=02/08/25/236217&amp;tid=145">reasonable questions are asked</a> of him.</p>

<h2>Spreading the Word</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Theory/">Theory</a> on 2002-08-26T19:13:59</h3>
<p>The questions so far posted make me realize just how little people know about Perl. They're asking things like (paraphrasing here), &quot;Where do you see Perl going?&quot; and &quot;How do you respond to the criticisms that Perl isn't OO because it doesn't support inheritance?&quot;</p>

<p>I'm not sure how to do it, but somehow, we in the Perl community have to do a better job explaining just what Perl is, what features it offers, and where it's going. Fortunately, I think that the Slashdot interview will contribute to the solution, since Larry himself will be helping the very people asking those questions to better understand Perl.</p>

<p>Kudos to Larry for agreeing to submit to the Slashdot &quot;Ask&quot; process!</p>

I replied to one or two that showed<br>a fundamental lack of understanding<br>(bytecode, interpreted, etc.)... but<br>it gets tiring. Too many people who<br>don't RTFM

<h2>Mod points!!!</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jdavidb/">jdavidb</a> on 2002-08-26T19:18:00</h3>
<p>Woohoo, finally an article on Perl is posted on a day when I had mod points!</p>

<p>(No, it doesn't take much to get me excited.  Sigh....)</p>

What a pitty! You get the chance for moderation on a Perl topic, get exited, and instantly loose your<br> <i>biggest</i> chance by talking about it.<br> <br>Live can be cruel.

<h3><a href="/user/jdavidb/">jdavidb</a> on 2002-08-27T11:31:49</h3>
<p>Actually I moderated first.</p>

Doesn't matter.  Posting on a thread that you've moderated in undoes all your moderation.

<h2>Re:Mod points!!!</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jdavidb/">jdavidb</a> on 2002-08-27T14:43:47</h3>
<p>Yes, but I posted on a thread on this site, while I was moderating on slashdot.</p>

<p>Oh, now I see.  I don't think you understand.  I didn't mean I had mod points <i>here</i>, and those points wouldn't have done any good anyway since this is not the site conducting the interview.</p>

Oops!...my mistake.

I had some mod points and after the article fell off the front page I modded down everything that was: Perl 6-related, "Where's Perl Going?", "Why did you write Perl?", etc..<br> <br>With luck some interesting *new* questions will be leftover.

<h2>Why Perl 6?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jordan/">jordan</a> on 2002-08-26T20:23:14</h3>
While a lot of the questions will be (already are) about Perl6, I don't expect even most of them to be.<br> <p>Why the Perl6 topic for this?  OTOH, I don't know what topic this should go under and Larry is probably doing this as part of his Perl6 proselytizing.</p>



<h2>they should have stipulated</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/hfb/">hfb</a> on 2002-08-26T22:20:42</h3>
<p>that the questions be phrased in some form of haiku, clerihew, or limerick which would have weeded out much of the line noise<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<p>Hey! You! Larry Wall<br>
Think you have it all?<br>
Or does your nose curl<br>
at the thought of mangling Perl?<br>
</p>

Somewhere, I have a bit of code that will one day turn into Slash::YouMustBeAtLeastThisSmartToPostHere.  On the other hand, it'd keep me from posting to Slashdot too.  Talk about mixed blessings!
</p>



<h2>ok, what about a limerick?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/grinder/">grinder</a> on 2002-08-28T14:09:41</h3>
How about...<br>
<p>If you had your way, my dear Larry,<br>
What baggage would you rather not carry?<br>
autoflush typeglobs,<br>
or regexps with knobs,<br>
or something even more scarey?</p>

Larry is a nice guy.  Let's see if exposure to the teeming jackasses of Slashdotistan turn him into a serial killer.  Fava beans, nice chianti, etc etc.

Larry's well aware of the 'fun' that is slashdot. I don't think he'll go psycho over it.
