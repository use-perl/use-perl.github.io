Actually, davorg has prohibited me from making everything orange<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-( The content is (apparently!) more important - some of it is <i>really</i> out of date. I mostly want to concentrate on getting an automated way to keep the groups list up to date and full of useful information.

<p>I think you'll find I've prohibited you from making <b>anything</b> orange.</p>

<p>/me feels ever so slightly like a Golgafrinchan discussing what colour it should be and whether people want web sites that can be nasally inserted</p>

<p>Quite reasonable, IMHO. If you make both the foreground <b>and</b> background colours orange, then many people would find it hard to read</p>

  To keep the group list up to date it may be a good idea to delegate handling of those at the country level, it's easier to keep track on a more local basis.

A good idea, but I think it breaks down for any country much bigger than the UK. It's all very well to have a delegate representing the handful of [very active, from what I can tell] UK groups, but that would break down very quickly for the USA. Going regional might make more sense over here: northeast, midwst, south, etc. Something that arranges it so that the regional delegate only has to keep track of say a couple dozen groups at most, and finding a geographic distribution that accomodates that. 'course, this all starts getting very bureaucratic very fast...<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:/

<h2>Oslo.pm very much dead :-/</h2>

Hi.<p>
I just thought I'd mention that I've tried to contact several people about norwegian perl mongers, however, I haven't been getting 1 reply in mail.</p><p> Either they don't take well to strangers (They are norwegian, after all), or Oslo.pm is dead dead dead (much more likely).</p><p> Unless it's alive, and they just hate me, I'd be interested in reanimating it, or at least giving it a shot<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)</p><p>

<p>This is a problem I've already identified. It's all very well having 500 local Perl Monger groups listed on the site, but if a third of them don't respond to email then it just gives a bad impression.</p>
<p>I'll be attempting to contact every local group and those that don't respond will be marked as defunct.</p>

<h2>Visibility on perl.com</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/grinder/">grinder</a> on 2002-08-08T08:13:11</h3>
This reminds me of a pet peeve of mine: Perl Mongers have just about zero visibility on perl.com.
<p>Scroll down the page to the part where it talks about "resources" and have a look.</p>
<p>If you know that 'Perl Users Groups' eq 'Mongers' you won't find anything under 'M'. Further down, one sees 'User Groups'. Follow that link and you come to another page that contains a solitary group: ny.pm.org.</p>
<p>The only other link is in the "Perl Sites" textbox down the bottom of the left hand column, and personally my eyes ignore the contents of the margins on the basis that they usually contain adverts.</p>
<p>So I'd be eternally grateful if anyone could do something about raising the visibility in the middle of the page.</p>

<p>I hadn't noticed that. Thanks for pointing it out. That's certainly something I can address.</p>
