<h2>CPAN is Unusable</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/bart/">bart</a> on 2002-08-09T22:40:32</h3>
The new version still offers no substantial improvements with regards to what was said in the Lightning Talk <a href="http://omor.com/perl/yapc2002l/" title="omor.com">CPAN is Unusable</a omor.com>. The problems were, and actually still are, that it's not clear which links lead to downloads (the top section), and which to documentation (the rest). Only people familiar with CPAN know where to click for what.

I dunno, I don't find it too hard to<br>mouse-over and look at the status bar.<br>It's a technique anybody that's surfed<br>the web for a decent amount of time<br>should have accquired.

I think I disagree.
The search results page gives
you 2 links that are barely differentiated:
for example
<blockquote><div>
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/author/LEMBARK/Quantum-Superpositions-1.05/lib/Quantum/Superpositions.pm" title="cpan.org">Quantum::Superpositions</a cpan.org>
<br>vs<br>
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/author/LEMBARK/Quantum-Superpositions-1.05/" title="cpan.org">
Quantum-Entanglement-0.32</a cpan.org>.
</div></blockquote>
These <b>should</b> be differentiated (download, docs).
<p>
Looking at the status bar while hovering over the
link doesn't help either:

</p><blockquote><div>
<tt>
http://search.cpan.org/author/LEMBARK/Quantum-Superpositions-1.05/lib/Quantum/S<nobr>u<wbr></nobr>  perpositions.pm</tt> <br> vs. <br> <tt>
http://search.cpan.org/author/LEMBARK/Quantum-Superpositions-1.05/</tt>
</div></blockquote>
(On a different topic, I also wish that there was
still an option to see all hits on one page.)

Due to the nature of the search now it is not practical to show all results on one page. However there will be an option to increase the number of results you see



<h2>Re:CPAN is Unusable</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jdavidb/">jdavidb</a> on 2002-08-13T15:23:29</h3>
<ul><li>Quantum::Superpositions</li>
<li>Quantum-Entanglement-0.32</li>
</ul>
 

<p>You know, those make perfect sense to me.  The first is the page for the module (offering an abstract, author info, links to the docs and tarball, etc.), while the second is the tarball for a specific version of the module itself.  I'm just guessing; now I'll click over there and see if I'm right.</p>

<p>Oddly enough, I'm wrong.  The first is the docs for the module, while the second is the page for the module with links to everything else.</p>

<p>But I don't anticipate that will take more than a day to get used to.</p>

If it sucks so much, do something about it!  Mock up a "better" version.  If people like it, find out from the appropriate people what kind of templates they need, and provide them!  I'm sure something helpful would be much better received than "this sucks.  But I won't tell you in any specific manner how to fix it.  I expect you to do so."

<p>I'm not sure what the issue here is. The download links take the form of a(n admittedly small) disk icon. Everything else appears to be links for docs, browsing, etc.</p>

<p>But if you want to make suggestiongs, I suggest you use the <a href="http://search.cpan.org/feedback/" title="cpan.org">feedback form</a cpan.org>. Graham is very responsive to comments right now.</p>

<p>So click something and figure it out or use the other search engines listed on the front page of CPAN. I've not finished the new FAQ but, then again, the old one with pictures and arrows with detailed explanations didn't seem to help that guy out before so I wouldn't expect it to help him or you now. Be adventurous...go ahead, click a link and live a little.</p>

<p>Or, in the words of MJD: "You know, this sort of thing is amenable to experimental observation," and "What happens when you try?"</p>

<p>Heh, getting to hear MJD record his ENTIRE "file of good advice" at YAPC was a treat.  You guys just got the parts gnat selected; I was there for the whole thing.</p>

<p>After the "unusable" lightning talk, I did remember my first experience with search.cpan.org (which came almost two years after my first experience with CPAN, I'm guessing).  I remember being slightly confused.  And I remember figuring it out.  Maybe I'm just weird that way.</p>



<blockquote>

<h2>(Figure it out) Re:CPAN is Unusable</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/osfameron/">osfameron</a> on 2002-08-14T15:13:06</h3>
Quite a few answers here are along the lines
of "figure it out", "hover over the link",
"you'll soon get used to it".
<p>
I agree (sort of).  That's what I did too, and yes, I love CPAN too.
</p><p>
But I also disagree.  <a href="http://search.cpan.org/" title="cpan.org">search.cpan.org</a cpan.org>
 isn't
(just) a tool for developers, for the kind of
person that enjoys trying all the options to figure something out.
(And no, I don't think jdavidb is "wierd" for being
this kind of person, it's a great type of
person to be.)
</p><p>
But not everyone is like that, and I didn't realise that CPAN was aimed only at this
audience.
I thought is was also for, for example, accidental programmers who are
handed a task by their PHB; that it was designed to encourage them to
take a step in the
right direction by trying to incorporate good quality,
reusable, code.  The alternative being rolling their own kludged version: I think we need to support
this audience too.
</p><p>
The mantra of "Just deal with it, hey I did!"
does not help someone who is still unsure of
what a module is, and why they would want to
use one.  I would suggest
that it doesn't help the Perl community if a
newbie gives up on CPAN and writes buggy insecure
Perl code that Java programmers will laugh at.
</p><p>
I wouldn't complain about PAUSE, or any of the
rest of the structure involved in
<i>developing</i> Perl.  I get confused with
<tt>cvs</tt> but that's my problem.  CPAN, on the other hand, is
(or IMHO should be) a service for Perl
<i>users</i> as well.</p>

<h3><a href="/user/jdavidb/">jdavidb</a> on 2002-08-14T16:08:40</h3>
<p>You have valid points, but I think I (and many others) have an as yet unspoken assumption here: you could change search.cpan.org, but it would not inherently be any more obvious.  We can have users figure it out one way, or figure it out a different way, but I don't think I've seen any proposed rearrangements that make the situation any better.</p>

<p>If there is a more intuitive way of laying out the site that eliminates some of the "figure it out"-iveness, then will someone please prepare an HTML mockup?</p>

<p> <i>The mantra of "Just deal with it, hey I did!" does not help someone who is still unsure of what a module is,</i> </p>

<p>For a user in that state, I don't think search.cpan.org is going to be their biggest obstacle.  Even if search.cpan.org successfully guides the newbie through its stated mission of finding a useful module, reading its description and documentation, and downloading, the user will still not really know how to use what he has.  That's going to be a much bigger problem than accidentally pulling up the documentation link when you wanted the download link.  If you make search.cpan.org easier you have spent 80% of your effort to fix less than 20% of the problem.</p>

<p>I have been in that state.  The solution was time and education.  Does anyone know someone who has been stuck in that state for, say, over a year?  The accidental developer can take steps toward quality and reuse, as you say, but he cannot do all of these on his first program.  No amount of changes to CPAN or search.cpan.org can make his first program of that quality.  CPAN is not a magic wand that makes good programs; you have to have a good programmer for that.  (In related news, yesterday I read <a href="http://www.io.com/user/mccoy/beginning_print.html" title="io.com">In the Beginning was the Command Line</a io.com>; check it out and note the part about the Hole Hawg.)</p>

<p>Unless we have evidence that people are having trouble with search.cpan.org on an ongoing basis, the site should be targetted at those who have to live with it long term.  No sense changing it to fit the newbie when the newbie soon changes to be an experienced developer and would like it differently.</p>

<p>I think a significant number of people see a code snippet in<br>
the <i>Cookbook</i> or on Perl.com, try it out, and are <br>
discouraged when their code snippet fails because
it uses a <br>
non-standard module.</p>

<p>I'd like such people to find a gentler
introduction to <br>
adding modules to their distribution than clicking around <br>
in circles.  Offering an easier CPAN is I think better direction <br>
than dumbing down public code, eg</p>

<blockquote><div>Any contributed scripts must therefore follow certain rules:<br>

They must not use any non-standard Perl modules. <br>
I know this is a bit contentious, but I really <br>
think that the target audience will have<br>
problems installing modules from CPAN<br> </div></blockquote>  (from <a href="http://nms-cgi.sourceforge.net/" title="sourceforge.net">nms</a sourceforge.net>).

<p>search.cpan.org is amongst the most obvious
presences of<br>
and entry points to CPAN, hence my interest
in improving <br>search.cpan.org.</p>

<p>(I'll save my views on division of labour between <em>finding<br>
problems</em> and <em>offering improvements</em>
for another time.)</p>

<p>I'll post some <strong>style=newbie</strong> mockup before YAPC03.</p>

<p>eg, could be used as<br>
http://search.cpan.org/search?mode=module&amp;<em> <strong>style=newbie</strong>&amp;query=RSS

The new search.cpan offers an improvement in the presentation <br>
of<nobr> <wbr></nobr><code>.pm</code> documentation pages;
they now have navigation and <br>
a textbox for a new search.<br>
<p>
Also, the<nobr> <wbr></nobr><code>.pm</code> file now offers a link

appropriately enough labeled as <em>source</em>.
