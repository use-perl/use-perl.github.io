I picked up some of these from a guy on the street in New York.  The sound was mushy and he couldn't hold the camera still.  Somebody in front of the person doing the recording kept getting up. <p> Oh and there was somebody close by who kept talking through the whole thing. </p><p> Better just to lay down the $8.50 and go see it yourself in the theater, or wait 'till it comes out on DVD.</p>

 <p> And if the onion were similarly available, or even just in MP3 or transcript, that'd be great.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) </p>  <p> --jdb, who got to go to YAPC, but didn't get to go to OSCON. </p>

<h2>It Was I</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Theory/">Theory</a> on 2002-08-06T21:18:49</h3>
<p>I was sitting right in front taping MJD. I also taped both of Damian's talks and Allison's Tagmemics talk. Here's the status report on the videos:</p>

<p>I dumped the Tagmemics talk to one of the G4s at the conference, and aevil picked it up on her Firewire drive. She says that she'll try to get it compressed and delivered to Gnat. As for the other talks, I still have them on tape, and as soon as Gnat sends me his new Firewire drive, I'll get them transferred to disk and either send them back to Gnat on disk, or edit them and compress them in iMovie myself and send them to Ask for posting on perl.org.</p>

<p>So it's going to be a little while yet, but worry not! The videos <strong>will</strong> be made available!</p>

Did you get the part of Tagmemics where Dominus not only realized he was in the second row, but had a nice conversation with himself about it?  That was very nearly my favorite part.

<p>Quite possibly. I did a lot of camera swinging in that one. I got Larry and Gloria and Damian and ESR all waxing philosophical. I got you, too, asking a question. As soon as Elaine finds the time to get it into QT format, I'm sure it'll be a hit!</p>

When you encode it, can you pick a format that doesn't require MacOS or Windows to view it?  Sorenson 1 is ok for example.  Sorenson 3 is not.  I know the compression is not as good, but in that way more people can benefit from the effort.  Much appreciated.  -M.

<p>That was already the third  time that week that I found myself sitting in the second row on the aisle without meaning to.
And then I got up and went off to John Bjornstad's talk,
scheduled  at the same time, and
just barely stopped myself from inadvertently sitting in the second row on the aisle.</p>

<p>Many years ago I was seeing a psychotherapist, and I forgot to pay her before I left the office; she stopped me on the way out.  The next time I visited, we had a long discussion about that, and at the end of the discussion, I got up to leave, and walked out the door without paying her.</p>

<p>"Sometimes," she said, "these things are very deeply rooted."</p>
