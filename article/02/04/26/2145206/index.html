<p><i>"I think there'll be a sample chapter put up some time or other, but in the mean time, here's a descriptive ToC from the Preface:

</i><blockquote><div><i> <cite>Chapter 1, Preparing for LWP,</cite> covers in general terms what LWP does, the alternatives to using LWP, and when you shouldn't use LWP.

</i><p><i> <cite>Chapter 2, HTTP and LWP::Simple,</cite> explains how the web works and the easy-to-use yet limited functions for accessing it.

</i></p><p><i> <cite>Chapter 3, The LWP Classes for HTTP,</cite> covers the more powerful interface to the web.

</i></p><p><i> <cite>Chapter 4, The LWP Classes for URLs,</cite> shows how to parse URLs with the URI class, and how to convert between relative and absolute URLs.

</i></p><p><i> <cite>Chapter 5, Forms,</cite> describes how to submit GET and POST forms.

</i></p><p><i> <cite>Chapter 6, HTML Processing with Regular Expressions,</cite> shows how to extract information from HTML using regular expressions.

</i></p><p><i> <cite>Chapter 7, HTML Processing with Tokens,</cite> provides an alternative approach to extracting data from HTML using the HTML::TokeParser module.

</i></p><p><i> <cite>Chapter 8, Tokenizing Walkthrough,</cite> is a case study of data extraction using tokens.

</i></p><p><i> <cite>Chapter 9, HTML Processing with Trees,</cite> shows how to extract data from HTML using the HTML::TreeBuilder module.

</i></p><p><i> <cite>Chapter 10, Modifying HTML with Trees,</cite> covers the use of HTML::TreeBuilder to modify HTML files.

</i></p><p><i> <cite>Chapter 11, Cookies, Authentication, and Advanced Requests,</cite> deals with the tougher parts of requests.

</i></p><p><i> <cite>Chapter 12, Spiders,</cite> explores the technological issues involved in automating the download of more than one page from a site.

</i></p><p><i> <cite>Appendix A,  LWP Modules,</cite> is a complete list of the LWP modules.

</i></p><p><i> <cite>Appendix B, HTTP Status Codes,</cite> is a list of HTTP codes, what they mean, and whether LWP considers them error or succcess.

</i></p><p><i> <cite>Appendix C, Common MIME Types,</cite> contains the most common MIME types and what they mean.

</i></p><p><i> <cite>Appendix D, Common Language Tags,</cite> is a list of the most common language tags and what they mean (e.g., "zh-cn" means Mainland Chinese, while "sv" is Swedish).

</i></p><p><i> <cite>Appendix E, Common Content Encodings,</cite> is a list of the most common character encodings ("character sets") and the tags that identify them.

</i></p><p><i> <cite>Appendix F, ASCII Table,</cite> is a table to help you make sense of the most common Unicode characters.  It shows the character, its numeric code (in decimal, octal, and hex), and any HTML escapes there may be for it.

</i></p><p><i> <cite>Appendix G, User's View of Object-Oriented Modules,</cite> is an introduction to the use of Perl's object-oriented programming features.</i></p>

<p>I would love it if people here 1) ordered the book, and 2) wrote reviews about how happy they are with it, as compared to not having it at all (which is the only alternative, as this is the only book on LWP out there).  There is an unwelcome trend lately toward only malcontents bothering to write Amazon reviews of tech books.  ("And on p 43 he misspells 'Bette Midler' as 'Bette Middler' so ZERO STARS THIS BOOK SUCKS!")
Hopefully more germane reviews can be written for my lucious book!"</p></p>

Congratulations, Sean!  I put in my order and I'll write up a review as soon as I read it.

<h2>Question to the author...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/MeerCat/">MeerCat</a> on 2002-04-27T08:48:26</h3>
Sean,<br> <br>I look forward to reading your book as I've only ever used LWP in the shallowest way, and found it hard to find any material to let me cross over to "full-blown" use, but I was wondering if you could answer an LWP question for me (cheeky I know, but you can always say no).<br> <br>A few years back I wrote <a href="http://www.schmerg.com/code.asp" title="schmerg.com">HttpSniffer.pl</a schmerg.com> as an HTTP tunnel, or monitor (cf xmon) as I think of it - this was for debugging cookies and similar headers for scripted pages, but has proved quite popular for other people. At the time, LWP was all about being an HTTP client, but HttpSniffer has to play both client and server and should NOT follow redirects etc. so I wrote all my own HTTP handling code.<br> <br>Now I understand LWP has been extended over time - so I was thinking about re-writing HttpSniffer using LWP - if it makes it easy for me to read and write the HTTP stream without modifiying it in any way... any hints, clues or gotchas that I should look out for, or do you think it should prove ridiculously easy.... ??<br> <br>Cheers and TIA<br> <br>T<br> <br>

<p>O'Reilly has a "Web Client Programming With Perl" book out there; you can even read it online for free.  That's where I've pointed people in the past when they wanted to do something LWP was suited for.</p>
<p>I'll be glad to have a new book on the subject!  I haven't done much with LWP myself, but I know it's there and have all sorts of ideas for it.</p>
