Yes, you can use all the new expressiveness of Perl 6 in painfully obfuscatory ways, but it's also possible to use them to improve readability. For instance, on the perl6 language list we discussed how you'd declare an abstract method in Perl 6. <br> <br>There's no formal way to do that in Perl5. You could use one of the various Class building helper modules on CPAN (<tt>Class::MethodMaker</tt> et al), or you could just do<blockquote><div> <tt>sub an_abstract_method;</tt> </div></blockquote>But how can a reader tell the difference between your abstract method and<blockquote><div> <tt>sub a_forward_declaration;</tt> </div></blockquote>say? Sure you could add a comment, but (speaking personally) any comment that isn't a 'class comment' at the top of the class declaration stating what the class is for generally starts me worrying that either the comment is unnecessary, or the code it's commenting on is too complex.<br> <br>In Perl 6, the problem goes away:<blockquote><div> <tt>method display_on ($a_medium) is abstract {...}</tt> </div></blockquote>Simple, expressive, self documenting. And, the documentation stays in place through the vicissitudes of <tt>perl -MO=Deparse SomeFile.pm</tt> or whatever it's going to be called in Perl 6. Which is important when you're trying to write a refactoring browser.

Well, <tt>@args</tt> is already a two item list, but I think that, as written, you'll see <tt>$^a</tt> becoming <tt>@args</tt> and <tt>$^b</tt> becoming <tt>undef</tt>.<br> <br>The fix is simple though; just change the invocation to <tt>push @stack, %operator{$token}(*@args)</tt>, unary '*' being the list flattening operator introduced in Apocalypse 3.

Hmmmmm. Interesting point. I've asked Larry to clarify the semantics in such situations, and will post an update here when I get an answer.

Even if <tt>*@args</tt> isn't required, I argue that it should be considered good style; you're making your assumptions explicit.

Are you saying that the =~ is going to be defined such that <code>($paco =~ $yakko) == ($paco =~ $yakko)</code> will allways be true? (or are you saying that just the 4 examples $Bob listed will allways be true)
<p>

What if $paco and $yakko are both sub refs? there's no garuntee that $yakko.($paco) will ever be equal to $paco.($yakko).
</p><p>

for that matter, what about the list behavior Damian describes...

</p><blockquote><div>
<i>
    if $value =~ ('a',/\s/,7) {...} <br>
      # true if $value is eq to 'a'<br>
      #   or if $value contains whitespace<br>
      #   or if $value is == to 7<br>
</i><p><i>

That final example illustrates some of the extra intelligence that Perl 6's =~ has: When one of its
arguments is a list (not an array), the "smart match" operator recursively "smart matches" each element and ORs the results together, short-circuiting if possible.
</i></p>
</div></blockquote>

What happens in this scenerio...
<p>

<code>
if ($sub1 =~ ($sub2, $sub3)) {<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... }
</code>
</p><p>

is it equivilent to <code>($sub1.($sub2) || $sub1.($sub3))</code> ? Or <code>($sub2.($sub1) || $sub3.($sub1))</code> ?</p>

He's saying the latter.

The matching rules are supposed to be "sensible" and "reasonable" (for sufficiently vague values of those two words<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)

<p> <a href="http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2002/01/15/apo4.html?page=2#table1:matchingaswitchvalueagainstacasevalue" title="perl.com">The table in A4</a perl.com> lists
the behaviours of <tt>=~</tt> under various combinations of arguments.

</p><blockquote><div> <i>

</i> </div></blockquote>

That table doesn't mention the sub-ref/sub-ref case, but it would seem sensible and reasonable (to me, at least) that <tt>=~</tt> would just try referential equality there. Of course, Larry's mileage may vary on that point.


<blockquote><div> <i>

According to the table, it's reversible too.

<blockquote><div> <i>

<code>
       if ($sub1 =~ ($sub2, $sub3)) {<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... }
</code>
is it equivilent to ($sub1.($sub2) || $sub1.($sub3)) ? Or ($sub2.($sub1) || $sub3.($sub1)) ?

Neither, I think. IMHO it should be distributed referential equality: <tt>$sub1 == $sub2 || $sub1 == $sub3</tt>

<h2>when %var</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jaffray/">jaffray</a> on 2002-04-07T23:57:14</h3>
In the example code, calc($$) stores a value "but true" in %var, which then allows get_data($) to use "given $data { when %var {...} }" and have the result be "key $data exists in %var" even though the usual hash/scalar match is "%var{$data} is true".<br> <br>I suspect this would become an idiom with the given/when construct described in Apocalypse 4, and that worries me, since it looks like bad style - the meaning of the "when" condition is defined by an attribute attached to data elsewhere in the code.  The condition behaves in an unexpected way if you look only at the local code, and the attribute could easily cause unexpected effects if the data gets used in other conditionals.<br> <br>It's nice to be able to redefine truth, but to minimize confusion, it ought to be a relatively seldom occurrence...<br> <br>It seems like the example of hash/scalar matching in the example code - if we have a result or a handler or whatever for the given value, then use it - is going to be really common.  It also seems easier for hash/scalar matching to mean "scalar exists as a hash key", and write "when %var{$_}" when you want truth, than to have it mean "value associated with scalar is true", and write "when exists %var{$_}" when you want existence.<br> <br>It's late in the game, and I'm sure this has already been debated half to death, but... I figured I'd toss in two cents anyway.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br> <br>Thanks for another great article.

</cite>

<p>Personally, I would agree, especially from a "hash-keys-form-a-set" perspective. But we also have the case of sometimes wanting:</p><blockquote><div> <tt>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;when defined %var{$_} {...}</tt> </div></blockquote>which might also be useful in the example.

<p>So we have three viable alternatives and only one of them can be the DWIMish one.

</p><p>When designing the original Switch.pm module (the prototype for given/whens) I chose the "is true" variant, rather than the "is defined" or "is existent" alternatives.

</p><p>The main reason was because that it's still relatively easy to get the other behaviours:</p><blockquote><div> <tt>&nbsp; &nbsp; # Switch according to definedness...<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; given { defined %data{^$key} } {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; when 'key1' {...}<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; when 'key2' {...}<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; }<br> <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; # Switch according to existence...<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; given { exists %data{$^key} } {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; when 'key1' {...}<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; when 'key2' {...}<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; }<br> <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; # Switch according to either...<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; sub def($key) { { defined %^hash{$key} } }<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; sub ex($key)&nbsp; { { exists&nbsp; %^hash{$key} } }<br> <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; given %data {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; when def 'key1' {...}<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; when ex&nbsp; 'key1' {...}<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; when def 'key2' {...}<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; when ex&nbsp; 'key2' {...}<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; }</tt> </div></blockquote> <p>(By the way, Oh ye Gods of Use Perl, the lameness filter rejected the above post until I added enough pointless extra text here to satisfy it.
