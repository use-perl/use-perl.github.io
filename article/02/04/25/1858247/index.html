I generally use vim when I work under Linux (but not so much by choice, more because it's what comes up when I type 'vi', which is my editor more or less because it's the first Unix editor I became acquainted with). When I work on Windows, I usually use TextPad, and when I write code on our HP-UX machine at work, I usually use gvim.<br> <br>I wouldn't necessarily advocate them since I didn't choose those based on careful evaluation of two dozen editors; they're just what I happen to use.

Code completion annoys me.  It seems intended to be a crutch for those who don't yet know the language very well.<br> <br>Syntax highlighting on the other hand makes it very easy to spot typos in Perl.  If you mis-quote something, or leave off something you shouln't, you'll know it because the next few 'paragraphs' of code will be the wrong color.

<p>In Java, I find it useful for when I'm learning a new library. It's also decent for using libraries that <code>implementLongFunctionNamesForEverything()</code> so I can just type 'imp&lt;TAB&gt;' and pick the right one. In that other language, it's also useful for argument order, particularly for overloaded methods.</p>

<p>Automatic code completion would probably annoy me too, but in <cite>Vim</cite> I find <code>Ctrl+P</code> invaluable for completing partially typed words.</p>

<p>For example if you have a variable called <code>$inner_template_filename</code> then merely typing <code>$inn</code> then pressing <code>Ctrl+P</code> will type this.  It's a great time-saver, reduces typos, and means that using meaningful identifier names is much less painful.</p>

<p>(There's actually slightly more to it: <code>Ctrl+P</code> repeatedly cycles through different previously-used words that can complete what you've already typed; <code>Ctrl+N</code> cycles t'other way (for the &#8216;next&#8217; word); and once you've completed a word <code>Ctrl+X Ctrl+P</code> will type the following word for you.)</p>

<p>I'd really hate to go without syntax highlighting for anything significant.  It helps catch a lot of errors earlier.  The implementation in <a href="http://vim.org/" title="vim.org">vim</a vim.org> catches a number of stupid typos before I try to run the code.  I've tried various code completion things, but I've never found any that worked better than just typing.

<h2>Kate, or gvim with cream</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Matts/">Matts</a> on 2002-04-25T20:00:45</h3>
Kate is nice, though there's a really nasty bug in the KDE 3.0 release version which slows down the editor significantly using the Perl syntax highlighting. Apparently it's fixed in KDE 3.1 though.<br> <br>So when I have to edit larger files, I use gvim (looking forward to kvim though) with the <a href="http://cream.sf.net/" title="sf.net">Cream</a sf.net> extension, which turns vim into a single-mode editor with CUA keystrokes. It's a little buggy, but quite usable.

<h2>Komodo or HTML-Kit</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jwbozzy/">jwbozzy</a> on 2002-04-25T20:22:32</h3>
I use Komodo extensively for all of my development, its builtin feature set is the most useful I've ever seen in an IDE. ActiveState offers a trial for it, give it a shot <a href="http://www.activestate.com/Products/Komodo" title="activestate.com">here</a activestate.com>.
HTML-Kit is nice too, and is totally free. It lacks some of the things Komodo has, but overall, it's very useful. Both of these allow editing over ftp, which is quite useful for me, saves alot of time. You can find HTML-Kit(Win32 only<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:&lt; ) <a href="http://www.chami.com/html-kit" title="chami.com">here</a chami.com>.

<h3><a href="/user/jwbozzy/">jwbozzy</a> on 2002-04-25T21:12:52</h3>
Komodo can be had for $29.95 for personal use, and it supports Ctrl-C, Ctrl-V copy and paste better than normal mouse based cut and paste. What version were you using?



<blockquote>

<h2>Re:Komodo or HTML-Kit</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Chad/">Chad</a> on 2002-04-25T21:44:39</h3>
I downloaded the trial version of Komodo 1.2 and had major problems with cut, copy, and paste. Specifically, sometimes when I would block out huge chunks of code, then hit Ctrl-X, all the code would disappear as expected. Then I would reposition my cursor to the desired insertion point, hit Ctrl-V, and<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.... nothing. It ate the cut text.<br> <br>In addition, I had problems with code-folding, which is a great idea for coding. Sometimes the code folding would work great; other times it would fold up the entire rest of the file even though it should have only slurped up the next few lines. Other times it would slurp up about a page and a half, and then stop somewhere in the middle of another subroutine. Weird.<br> <br>Another problem I had with Komodo is that while I was trying it out, I went through a file that I had been working on, and typed in a bunch of garbage all over the place, to see how it would handle things. When I got done, I exited the editor, and told it not to save any changes. When I opened it back up, a lot of that garbage was still in there. Apparently I got bit by the "auto-save" feature, which I had ignorantly assumed worked like the one in XEmacs. I turned that off in a big hurry.<br> <br>The $29.95 version that you mention is not for personal use. It is for teaching/learning use. I can't honestly say that I would use it for teaching/learning, even though I would not be selling any programs that I write while using it. So the $295 version is the only one available to me, and with all the problems it has, it seems a bit steep.<br> <br>If those problems were fixed, though, I like what Komodo offers, probably even enough to fork out the $295 for it. (Now if it only had incremental search...! )

<h2>Editor Choice does matter</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/hossman/">hossman</a> on 2002-04-25T20:40:38</h3>
First and formost, choice of editor should be based on individual comfort/style, not how well it's integrated with a particular language.  I like emacs commands, I like most of the emacs default key-bindings, I like the overall feel of emacs -- so I use emacs.  Other people can say the same thing about vim, or Komodo, or Kwrite, or TextPad or whatever you want -- that's the first step towards narrowing down your seletion, make sure you like the editor as a basic editor.
<p>

Odds are, if an editor is good enough to pass that first test, it's ging to offer customizations, it's going to offer support for particular programming languages, then go look at those and decided if you want to use them.  If you want syntax highlighting, turn it on; If you want auto indenting, turn it on; If you want code completion, turn it on.  Personally, I hate code ompletion, but I love auto-tabbing and syntax highlighting.  They help me see typos faster.
</p><p>

Personally, I use perl-mode, and the only problems I've ever had with it not highlighting the way I think it should is when I put funky characters like '#' or '"' inside qq() or qw().  The only time it doesn't auto-indent in a way that makes sense is when it sees something it thinkgs is code in here docs.  I don't mind either of these, because it shows me places where other people would probably be confused by my code at first glance as well.
</p><p>

Again, any editor worth using is going to be customizable, if you don't like the default tabing depth in perl-mode, tweak it; if you don't like the colours used or comments, tweak it.  But those aren't reasons NOT to use an editor, or not to use the language speciffic support in an editor.
</p><p>



<h2>Emacs</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jdavidb/">jdavidb</a> on 2002-04-25T20:57:29</h3>
<p>I'm currently drinking the Emacs Kool-Aid.  Choice of flavor: GNU.</p>

<p>I used to swear by VIM.  From the day I discovered emacs, I had the feeling that I was supposed to learn it, and that I would, "some day."  It just seemed like the thing a UNIX person was eventually supposed to do.  My switch from straight vi to vim just about killed that desire; I figured it was good enough, and I was highly productive with it.</p>

<p>Then I started noticing that a <b>lot</b> of the programmers I respect use emacs.  I started suspecting that there was something I was missing, and that if I changed editors, I would see some incredible results.</p>

<p>I'm reasonably emacs competent now.  I force myself not to use the mouse so I can do everything with the keyboard and truly learn emacs features (I always did the same thing with vim.)  I'm currently living with the emacs default indenting style for Perl.  (I realize now there are at least two Perl modes; when I grow stronger in the ways of the emacs force, I'll check the other one out in detail.)  What I really want is to some day program the way I did in THINK Pascal for Macintosh: I would never press return or tab; the editor handled it for me.  Some day I hope to know enough about emacs to make that happen.  Even (especially!) if it means I have to do LISP.</p>

<p>Today I discovered how emacs integrates with version control.  I was ecstatic, and shared it with some coworkers who haven't started down this path yet.  They thought it was neat, too.</p>

<p>Looking forward to all the wonderful things emacs has in store for me.  Like UNIX, Perl, and vi, there seems to be something new to learn every day.</p>

GNU emacs and cperl-mode.  I don't use colouring, but I do use indents.  (I find cperl knows more about how to indent code than does perl-mode, but both still get confused.  I hope to hell perl6 makes it easier and not harder for indenters).<p>

I've been yearning to treat my code like a collapsable outline, hiding everything but the subroutine I'm working on and the names of other top-level subroutines.  I think I remember cperl having something like that, so I guess it's time to RTFM<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p><p>

Another hint: cperl-mode can handle allmost all Perl code correctly but sometimes you need to explicitly ask it to reparse buffer with commands M-x load-library cperl-mode RET M-x normal-mode RET. It may fix some highlighting problems.</p>

I am using XEmacs, and at the bottom in parentheses, where it lists the major mode, it says CPerl automatically whenever I edit a Perl file.  However, just to make sure, I entered M-x cperl-mode.
<p>
However, I still have problems with a line like this:
</p><p>
<tt>my $weird_highlighting=qq|Don't do this!|;</tt>
</p><p>
because the syntax highlighter doesn't seem to understand the qq function, and suddenly the rest of my code is marked as a string, which makes syntax highlighting worse than worthless.
</p><p>
I had been having problems with POD highlighting as well, but that seems to have been fixed by enabling <tt>hairy</tt>, whatever that means.</p>

My GNU Emacs 21.1 handles such syntax in cperl-mode just fine. Maybe XEmacs you are using has old version of cperl-mode. You may try downloading latest version from <a href="http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/CPAN/ILYAZ/cperl-mode/" title="cpan.org"> http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/CPAN/ILYAZ/cperl-mode/</a cpan.org>.

<h2>Jedit</h2>

One editor I forgot to mention in my post below is <a href="http://www.jedit.org/" title="jedit.org">jedit</a jedit.org>.<br> <br>Now you need a snappy PC for it, since it's Java+Swing, but if you have that, it's probably the kick-iest ass-est editor around. It's got some absolutely lovely features in it, like if you hover over a brace, it doesn't just highlight the other brace - it shows you in the left-hand column a foldable section marker, from the start of the block to the end. And it will do this while you're in a block too. It's got some sweet plugins, like an XML plugin that shows MS-Word-like squiggly red lines when you type the XML wrong. Built in project management. Console windows. FTP plugins. Email plugins. Basically it's like emacs but usable<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)<br> <br>All in all, I'd use jedit all the time if I had a 2Ghz PC. But I don't, so I don't use it - it's just too darn slow.

Everyone's already thrown emacs and vi, in their various flavors, into the mix. I find personally that I tend to use emacs the most, but....
<p>
When writing code for <a href="http://camelbones.sourceforge.net/" title="sourceforge.net">CamelBones</a sourceforge.net> on my mac, I use Project Builder. Sure, it's not quite as full-featured as emacs, nor as keyboard-terse as vi, but it works pretty well, and as an integrated editor/build environment it more than meets my needs.</p>

Sure. Project builder works fine as a plain editor, or a plain editor with CVS connections. (And it's worth it to set CVS up)<br> <br>For CamelBones, the easiest thing to do is check out the Peoject Builder extras from the repository and use them--they'll add a Cocoa-Perl template project with all the bits in it you need to build an app.<br> <br>Just make sure you install the developer tools for all the pieces you need. It's worth it to sign up for the Apple Developer Connection program too, to get the reasonably latest versions of the dev tools.

Cursor anywhere on the line, you hit tab and the whole line moves to just the right spot. No tab inserted at the cursor, no multiple tab stops. It just does the right thing, time and time again. There have been times I've edited quick code in VIM and then later gone back in with emacs simply to indent it pretty.<br/><br/>Show me that functionality in vim, and I'll never need emacs again.

The [Tab] key in CPerl is one of the main reasons I like XEmacs. It's wonderful! Why can't every text editor have something similar? Now if I could just figure out a way to tell XEmacs to [Tab] every line of a file with a single keystroke seyquence...

(Actually, this is just my Perl config.  I have a few that are set based on filetype.  I can give you my<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.vimrc if you're interested.)
Then, things basically are just magically formatted.  I've found a couple of bugs with Vim 6, but those are really rare, and I'm not sure I really found a bug.  Use the<nobr> <wbr></nobr><code>:help</code> command to learn how these work.  Particularly<nobr> <wbr></nobr><code>:help 'cinoptions'</code>

<p>
In the cases where you need to reformat, use the <code>gq</code> <i>+ movement</i> command.  (Incidentally, with the correct config--which I'll post if you want--you can use <code>gq</code> to rewrap quotes sent in email.  Which I find <strong>terribly</strong> useful.

Either double-tap '=' on a line (i.e. == ) or do a motion with = (e.g. 4=j to format the line you're on and 4 below; or =% to format the paren pair you're in, or 1G0=G to reformat the entire file, although that can probably be made shorter it's a rare occurence since vim generally gets it right for me).

<h2>Another (GNU) emacs and cperl user</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/MeerCat/">MeerCat</a> on 2002-04-26T05:36:54</h3>
<br>Don't forget that emacs understands the perl debugger (or rather, the perl debugger recognises emacs and reacts accordingly) so debug your perl in emacs - one window shows the debugger, the other window steps thru your source with a highglight for "the current line". Plus emacs understands perldocs, you can run a shell within emacs and so integrate your command line with your editor, it understands most source code control systems<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... the point of emacs is not "just an editor" but "an environment for software development".<br> <br>T<br>



<h2>my favorite Perl editors</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/perlgrrl/">perlgrrl</a> on 2002-04-26T11:00:27</h3>
SlickEdit on Unix (expensive though it is), UltraEdit on Win32 (way cheaper, not quite as nice). I find syntax highlighting and macros helpful.



<h2>EditPlus and Vim</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/cabes/">cabes</a> on 2002-04-26T12:23:02</h3>
After trying many, many editors on Windows (and working for a cheap company) I started using EditPlus (<a href="http://www.editplus.com/" title="editplus.com">www.editplus.com</a editplus.com>) on Win32.  It has nice syntax highlighting, etc.  A great value at $30.  BUT... Perl, Apache, and HTML::Mason have recently been banished here for C#, IIS, and ASP.NET... and 'a Vis-u-al Studio'ing I go...<br> <br><br/><br/>I use vim on my Slack8 box.  It's awesome.  Vim 6.x for Linux is the ultimate editor!  (Sorry emacs fans!)
<br> <br>



<h2>TextPad</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/DysonSphere/">DysonSphere</a> on 2002-04-26T13:47:46</h3>
I (unfortunately) am stuck in the NT/2K world for most of my daily activities, and have found that TextPad really works well. Plugins are available for syntax highlighting (or you can create your own document class), indenting, macros, custom toolbars, and a host of other features. The left hand file list also comes in really handy for editing multiple files. Get it <a href="http://www.textpad.com/" title="textpad.com">here.</a textpad.com>



<h2>UltraEdit, on Win2K</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/user2048/">user2048</a> on 2002-04-26T17:36:43</h3>
I use UltraEdit, on Win2K. It has customizable syntax highlighting, and other programming features (ctags, function lists, etc.).<br> <br>I chose it over TextPad, because UE considers a quoted string to end at the end of a line, whereas TP doesn't. This is essential for those cases in Perl where the editor mistakenly interprets a quote char as the start of a string, ex. q{a"b};. (I wonder how other syntax-highlighting editors handle those tough Perl cases?)<br> <br>TP is inexpensive shareware, with good support.

<h2>Cperl-Mode Hooks, Customizations?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Illiad/">Illiad</a> on 2002-04-26T18:55:27</h3>
I use XEmacs for Win32, with Cperl-mode.  I found myself having to go into the cperl-mode.el file to add a number of constructs keywords and the like inorder to make the synatax highlighting work as I preferred it.
<p>
It does have the odd problem with print <code>
print qq(&lt;!--#include<nobr> <wbr></nobr>....);
</code> </p><p>
works in perl, but breaks in cperl-mode.  Easy fix is just to escape the \#, which works in both.
</p><p>
So, does anyone have any extensive customizations to their cperl-mode, or some<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.emacs customizations they'd like to share with the perl community?
</p><p>
Here's mine:
</p><p>
<code>
(add-hook 'cperl-mode-hook
          (lambda ()
	    (set (make-local-variable 'compile-command)
		 (concat "perl -w " buffer-file-name))
            (set-face-background 'modeline "slategray" (current-buffer))))

(setq cperl-hairy t)
(setq cperl-electric-parens-string nil)

(global-set-key "\C-j" 'cperl-linefeed)

each one is a compromise but - overall perlEdit has a good mix of features for editing,  syntax checking, debugging.
