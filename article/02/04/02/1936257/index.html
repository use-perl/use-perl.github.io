Anyone knows if this draw is open to US citizens only or can anyone can take part?

<p>Didn't say anything about only being for the US on the page. And the survey asked what country I was from. So I'm going to assume that us non-merkans have just as much chance as anyone.</p>

I crosschecked with the marketing people, and yes, it is open to anyone, independent of residence or citizenship.

in part of the survey they ask for periodicals you read for programming info. Presumably this is to help them better spend their marketing moneies.<br> <br>The Perl Review is not on that list. If you read TPR, write them in the "other" category. I do read it, and I did write it in.<br> <br>I am not affiliated with TPR in any way other than being a reader. However, add revenue for TPR will certainly help the odds that I'll be able to continue being a reader (ie: that it'll continue to exist).<br> <br>I'm not asking anyone to lie. If you don't read TPR, don't put them in. If you do read them, do put them in.<br> <br>-matt<br>

<p>Strangely enough, use.perl.org was not on the list either.  Since this is where I found out about the survey, I thought it was rather odd that they didn't include it.  I usually come here for news about Perl, so it was one of my write-ins.  Others may wish to do the same.</p>
