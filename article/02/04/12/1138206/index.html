There's already one <a href="http://www.interconnected.org/home/more/GoogleSearch.pl.txt">example search script using SOAP::Lite</a> available on the web. How long until <a href="http://www.infobot.org/">infobots</a> get the ability to Google back?"</i>

I've hacked together a really quick infobot plugin, that Laotse on Rhizomatic uses.<br/><br/>However, there's someone working in a WWW:Search interface, so when that's released, I'll write a plugin around that, and apply it to CVS.

And here it is: <a href="http://www.astray.com/tmp/WWW-Search-Google-0.17.tar.gz" title="astray.com">WWW::Search::Google</a astray.com> that uses the SOAP API (note: you'll need a Google API license key!). I'm waiting on Google's consent before pushing it onto the CPAN.

The infobot plugin is finished and now in CVS (www.sourceforge.net/projects/infobot), as are a number of other new and fun plugins...<br>
&lt;/plug&gt;

The security problems don't affect the SOAP client in SOAP::Lite.

Here here.  The SOAP::Lite FUD on use.perl is getting old fast.<br> <br>-sam<br>

<h3><a href="/user/pudge/">pudge</a> on 2002-04-14T14:43:35</h3>
Rubbish.  There's no FUD.  It is a very serious security problem that people need to know about it before they install the module, or if they have already installed it.  You don't like it?  Tough.



<blockquote>

<h2>Re:Security</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/samtregar/">samtregar</a> on 2002-04-14T21:03:03</h3>
So just having the module installed puts you at risk?  That, my friend, is pure FUD.  In fact, most usages of the module put you in no appreciable risk at all.  The only risky situation requires:
<p><ol>
<li>You setup a public SOAP server outside your internal network.</li>
<li>You use autodispatch, which is certainly not the most obvious was to use SOAP::Lite.</li>
</ol>
<p>
Neither of these has anything to do with using SOAP::Lite to call methods in Google's SOAP service.

<em>So just having the module installed puts you at risk?</em> <br> <br>No one ever said or hinted that.  It is very simple: the module has a serious security problem and people who install it should know about it.  This is not rocket science.  Please stop with your nonsense.  Thanks.<br>

I'm sorry for being rude in the two previous posts, it wasn't proper.  I stand by the substance, though.  I am very grateful to Paul Kulchenko and I like SOAP::Lite a lot, but I will continue to notify people of security problems like this in the future.<br>

Before criticizing someone's grammar, make sure they're using the same dialect you are. Just because something's <a href="http://www.bartleby.com/64/C001/020.html" title="bartleby.com">different from what you're used to</a bartleby.com> doesn't mean it's wrong.

<p>And while nitpicking I'll flame myself for missing a parenthesis.</p>

<p>I also stand surprised, as well as corrected.  I thought that was something like an immutable grammar law for many languages, and I figured British English would have been a real stickler for it.</p>

Let's use this to continuously search for terms that will titillate the eavesdroppers!<br/><br/>From <a href="http://www.eff.org/Privacy/Surveillance/Terrorism_militias/20011031_eff_usa_patriot_analysis.html" title="eff.org">EFF's US Patriot Act analysis</a eff.org>.<br/><br/>"Be careful what you put in that Google search. The government may now spy on web surfing of innocent Americans, including terms entered into search engines, by merely telling a judge anywhere in the U.S. that the spying could lead to information that is "relevant" to an ongoing criminal investigation. The person spied on does not have to be the target of the investigation. This application must be granted and the government is not obligated to report to the court or tell the person spied up what it has done."
