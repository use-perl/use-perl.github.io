<h2>In case you're interested</h2>

I've actually tried this using a demo of Visual Perl and Beta 2 of the<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.NET framework (including Visual Studio).
<p>
While I'm no fan of Microsoft, this piece of software is hands down the best IDE for Perl that I've ever seen.  Very slick interface with all the bells and whistles.  Debugger, watch variables, variable inspection, code folding and even version control. The works.
</p><p>
If you're doing Perl in a Windows environment and<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.NET is something your company is into, this is the tool for you (assuming you can afford it).</p>

<h3><a href="/user/lachoy/">lachoy</a> on 2002-05-02T19:28:38</h3>
Did you use any sort of CVS plugin for the Visual Studio<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.NET version control? We've been poking around for this with minimal luck.

Actually, I didn't have any luck with the version control, but then I thought that was something that would be worked out by the time the official release came out (I was using Beta 2).
<p>
I *suspect* they're going to try and drive folks to their propietary versioning system (SourceSafe I think its called).</p>

You suspect correctly: Visual SourceSafe is <b>the</b> supported VC mechanism. There is a Source Code Control API for both VS.NET and VS6, but you can only use one type of version control at a time -- to work on CVS projects and VSS project you'd need to change registry settings or something. Blech. (Plus the CVS integration wasn't very good anyway, apparently.)

<h2>Welcome, if not for me...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/MeerCat/">MeerCat</a> on 2002-05-01T21:26:26</h3>
I welcome AS's effort in doing this, as in many people's eyes it legitimises Perl on Win32 (if not in general).<br> <br>Unfortunately, I think the MS IDE is particularly poor at being anything like a professional development environment - I spend plenty of time trying to wean my C++ developers off the VC++ IDE if only to open their eyes to how there are better ways to do things, integrate with other tools, use open rather than closed toolsets, to be aware of what they do rather than rely on wizards and similar... in short to spend more time making their intent clear in the code they write (which is what other developers have to read), rather than making their intent clear to an IDE which takes delight in doing what they want, but recording only the obscure end result. Sort of like a compiler that writes the object file but deletes the source code...<br> <br>Of course, if AS can take this a chance to turn Perl into a competitor in the VB market (ie simple drag'n'drop of GUI design and hooking up handlers) then I think Perl could revolutionise GUI prototyping and "small-GUI" apps in the same way that it made such a huge impact on the "text-and-file manipulation" area. I recently prototyped a custom 3 tier global system in perl, but the (thick) client had to be done in VB to get all the work done in a reasonable timescale (using PerlCOM to let VB call the Perl communications layer) - if I could have written the GUI mock-up in Perl too I think I could have done a much better prototype much quicker, but the Tk and Win32::GUI modules need some visual tools...<br> <br>--<br>T<br>
