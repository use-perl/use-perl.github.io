<a href="http://www.perlbox.org/">perlBox</a> is a pluggable desktop manager for Unix-type operating systems. It is written in perl/TK and integrates well with the blackbox window manager, thus the name. It can be used with any window manager you choose, however. perlBox is full featured and configurable. It's primary feature is a built in voice response system. That's right, you say it and it happens. It's that easy... <a href="http://www.perlbox.org/about.shtml">more</a></i>

Has anyone played around with this?"</p>

<h2>Things that make you go hmmm...</h2>

Are others reaching 'Camelot Naturals' when attempting to go to perlbox.org or is it just me?  The DNS I'm using must be somewhat confused methinks<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

I'm not getting any Camelot Naturals, but I'm not getting any real content either (just a blank page).  I think the site is slashdotted and having some problems, though your DNS problems must be a separate issue.

Hmm, now it's working (well, not working <i>per se</i> as I'm getting the blank page too).  Still, I'm glad I'm not getting the bloody Camelot Naturals page anymore.  I like my DNS again<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

Naturally google has it cached <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=+site:www.perlbox.org+perlbox" title="google.com">here</a google.com>.

<h2>It's still down</h2>

Methinks the<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/. effect took down the server.  It's still down as of 0700 CST.



<h2>Not just down</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ct/">ct</a> on 2002-04-18T14:38:17</h3>
Gone. The front page is blank, and all the subdirs you see listed on the google cache return 404. (And a Cobalt Raq 404 screen to boot).
<p>
Oh Well.</p>

There is <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/perlbox" title="sourceforge.net">a sourceforge project</a sourceforge.net> too.

<h2>perlbox crashed hostgo!</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/scmason/">scmason</a> on 2002-04-21T09:00:25</h3>
Hi, Sorry that the site was down, but it seems that perlbox.org received so many hits (10,000 unique ip's in 2 hours) that it kept crashing the raq it was on at hostgo.com. This was due to a tremendous response to an article posted on slashdot.com. I have moved the site to an rs6000 running SuSePPC at the lab where I work at the University of Montana. The site is up, and very capable of handling any traffic thrown at it. <p>
I am interested to see what the consensus here is, the conversation at slashdot degenerated into a "perl is too slow for that" and "you should spend your time on more productive tasks" and "java is better than perl" type thing.</p><p>

I would appreciate any feedback! Anyone who wants to contribute some time and coding, there is an interest out there in this project. It's moving like hotcakes! I have been averaging around 400 downloads a day for the last three days.</p><p>
