<p><a href="http://yetanother.org/dan/">Dan</a> writes <i>"On April 8th (That's this monday) I'll be making a presentation to the New York Perlmongers on the design and current state of Parrot. Talk is at 7:00, precursor stuff around 6:30 (including swag).
</i><p><i>
This presentation is a fundraiser for the <a href="http://perl-foundation.org/">Perl Foundation</a>. All donations made at the meeting, or afterwards at the social to-do, will be matched by David Hand, up to $1500. Suggested donation is $100 for those of you who've got the means.
</i></p><p><i>
The meeting is being hosted by the kind folks at Morgan Stanley. 750 7th Avenue, 4th floor conference room. (You'll need to check in with the guard at the front desk.)"</i></p></p>

<h2>I forgot...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Elian/">Elian</a> on 2002-04-08T15:20:28</h3>
Two things:<br> <br>1) Bring photo ID. Building security checks.<br> <br>2) Nobody gets turned away if they don't donate or are Python programmers other such things. We won't toss you out or shake you down if you don't, or can't, kick in.



<h2>Did anybody take notes?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Trey/">Trey</a> on 2002-04-09T07:45:41</h3>
Or record the talk?  I shoulda been there, I <i>work</i> in the building for goshsakes, but of course today was the day for me to come down with a nasty case of food poisoning...

I don't think so, unfortunately. I can give it again if SAGE wants. (Or anyone else for that matter)<br> <p> <br>The lighter-weight version of this talk, the one I presented at the April DC.pm meeting, was taped. I think MP3s of it should be available at some point.</p>

<h2>'Twas a good night</h2>

As a followup, we collected $2215, including a generous donation fromn Ben Tilly of $1000. With David Hand's matching of $1500, the total for the night was $3715. Thanks to everyone who donated. Everything helps.
