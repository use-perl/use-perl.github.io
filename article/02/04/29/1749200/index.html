<h2>Supported Platforms</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/chbarr/">chbarr</a> on 2002-04-29T19:30:00</h3>
Which platforms will Parrot support? Specifically, will there be a port of Parrot (and, in turn, hopefully Perl 6) to PalmOS?



<h2>Other languages</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Ovid/">Ovid</a> on 2002-04-29T19:38:55</h3>
<p>I'm excited as heck about Perl6.  I can't wait to start taking advantage of coroutines, continuations, and hyper-operators.  Since Parrot is being built largely with Perl6 in mind, this suggests that Parrot will have a flexibility that few other languages can touch.  While much of the Perl community seems excited about this, I can't help but wonder about non-Perl communities?  We'd like to see other languages such as Python or Java use the Parrot VM, but do their communities see any benefit to using Parrot?</p>

<p>Rephrased:  we're inviting other people to the party.  Do they want to come?</p>

I think you'll see Ruby and Python jump on for the performance increase if nothing else.

<h3><a href="/user/cjf/">cjf</a> on 2002-05-01T07:19:58</h3>
<p>From what I've heard there are a lot of other Ruby people who see benefits to using Parrot. The ones who don't already will quickly be won over by the improved speed and flexibility. I'm sure a lot of these people will also contribute to the project. I see it as a start of a beautiful friendship<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:).</p>

<p>I think Python will be on in no time. Python has a thing for multiple implementations. I think that as the tension between the two settles down then Parrot is coming at just the right time. My guess is that there'll be a Parrot based implementation in no time, and then some clever fellow will get Python and Perl to talk . . . and I will hug them tightly.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<h2>Is it a BEEFY Parrot?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/erikharrison/">erikharrison</a> on 2002-04-29T23:22:15</h3>
I realize that some of this is dependent on Perl 6 design, but what kind of performance increase is there, potentially. <b>Is</b> there in fact, a performance boost, or is Parrot really a maintainabilty/feature choice?



<h2>Timeline/Support/etc.?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/johnseq/">johnseq</a> on 2002-04-29T23:33:25</h3>
What functionality do you expect to deliver in a Parrot 1.0 release?  Is it just Perl 6.0 support (with other languages supported or unsupported as the case may be) or are things like JVM/CLR support  considered must-have?<br> <br>I know with predominantly volunteer efforts timeframes are notoriously difficult,  but is there a date by which you _hope_ to have parrot-based systems (with 1.0 features above) in production?  <br>



<h2>Parrot Inspirations</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/johnseq/">johnseq</a> on 2002-04-29T23:41:16</h3>
Was there particular virtual machine prior art that played a major role inspiring Parrot's design?  <br> <br>If I was interested in learning more about the philosophy behind the Parrot VM are there any specific projects/languages/papers you could point me to (that weren't necessarily about Parrot)?



<h2>smart strings and lazy arrays</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/LunaticLeo/">LunaticLeo</a> on 2002-04-30T03:56:37</h3>
Is Parrot the place and will it...<br> <br>- implement Copy-on-write strings?<br> <br>- implement smart strings? IE using a tree structure for appends, insertions, etc.<br> <br>- lazy arrays ala (0..Inf)?<br> <br>

<p>A corollary to this question: What are the plans to coordinate the Parrot release with the Perl 6 release?  Will Parrot 1.0 coincide with Perl 6.0, or are there sub-milestones that you'll be trying to synchronize to?  Or will the timelines be essentially independent of each other?

<h2>Documentation</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/2shortplanks/">2shortplanks</a> on 2002-04-30T09:37:38</h3>
How do you feel about the level of documentation and commenting in the current project?
<p>
Do you feel that someone wanting to use Parrot for their own ends could just pick up and work, or do you think that they'd have a big learning curve first?</p>



<h2>persistence</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/mtk/">mtk</a> on 2002-04-30T13:05:05</h3>
josh pritikin integrated ObjectStore into perl.  and while ObjectStore is problematic (pointer swizzling on the back of SEGV's), the goal is golden: simple, transparent persistence for perl runtime data.  i'm not talking about DBFile and friends.  i'm talking about storing arbitrary graphs of data (e.g. a hash
whose values are hash references), perhaps under a transaction.  i'm not asking if parrot will implement something like this.  i just want to know that the developers have thought about the issue.  i'd hate to see perl6 make it difficult for others to implement this style of persistence, e.g. by making it impossible to work with or work around the garbage collector.<br/><br/>thoughts/comments?



<h2>p52p6</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/rafael/">rafael</a> on 2002-04-30T20:28:45</h3>
Have you an idea about the implementation of the "official" p52p6 translator ? OK, that's not really parrot-related. Just to know how you feel about this.



<h2>Timely, well-ordered destructors</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/tye/">tye</a> on 2002-04-30T23:12:57</h3>
<p>
Will Parrot support timely, well-ordered destructors?  Perl's reference counting provides this but such appears to be impossible with "modern garbage collection".
</p> <p>
"Well-ordered" means that if $x references (depends on) $y (and there is no circular dependence), then $x's destructor will fire before $y's.
</p> <p>
"Timely" means that destructors fire quite quickly so that they can free related resources for reuse.
</p> <p>
For example, an easy and powerful technique is to construct a "lock" object that automatically releases the lock when it is destroyed.
</p>



<h2>Efficiency versus computer science</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/toma/">toma</a> on 2002-05-01T06:10:20</h3>
I have heard that perl has fast regular
expressions in part because the code has
good locality for both data and instructions,
which keeps them inside of the processor
cache.<p>

I have heard that the previous perl
regex engine beautification
attempts were abandoned due to speed
problems. Is parrot going to preserve the
speed-is-more-important-than-beautiful-code
philosophy?</p>



<h2>Parrot</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/hemabe/">hemabe</a> on 2002-05-01T09:49:51</h3>
Hello.
I'm really looking forward for the final parrot. Of course, like everyone else, I would like to know, when it will be finished.<br/><br/>But my 2 "real" questions:
One of the major benefits of parrot (for me) will be the possibility, to give my software to customers without the source. Will it be possible, to run software developed in perl on a foreign computer, without first installing perl? Will there be a port to Windows Computers (i assume)?<br/><br/>I have no knowledge about internals like "register based machine" or "stack based machine". I read on http://www.parrotcode.org/faq/ , that parrot will use a "register-based vm". Simply, because i'm curious: Why register-based? What are the pros and cons of the both systems (speed, simplicity)? Would be nice, if your could explain this a little bit more.<br/><br/>Thanks, Hermi



<h2>Perl in Perl (for Parrot on Parrot)</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Petruchio/">Petruchio</a> on 2002-05-01T11:39:25</h3>
<p>
 So Perl6 is going to be a compiler for Parrot.
 And being a regular compiler, rather than the
 just-in-time dynamic sort Perl5 has, one would
 tend to think that compiler performance will
 be a bit less important; compile once, run
 repeatedly.  And rumor even has it that Perl6
 will be designed in such a fashion that
 non-Damians will be able to parse it.
</p>
<p>
 So what are our prospects for a Perl compiler
 written in Perl?
</p>
<p>
 At a glance, from a distance, by a layman,
 it seems like you could do a pretty reasonable
 job of writing a Parrot compiler for language
 <i>n</i> in a high-level language (say, Perl5).
 Then write another Parrot compiler for language
 <i>n</i> in language <i>n</i>, compile the
 second compiler with the first, and find
 yourself up and running pretty darned quickly.
</p>
<p>
 Is there a future for this sort of thing
 on Parrot, at least for rapid prototyping?
 Might we see a Perl6 compiler written in
 Perl6? And if it's not plausible or useful,
 why so?
</p>
<p>
 Those of us who are not (yet) skillful
 enough to participate in the design and
 implementation of important languages
 really like a good story, with things to
 think about.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)  Feel free to embellish.
</p>



<h2>Too Perlish</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/erikharrison/">erikharrison</a> on 2002-05-02T03:22:23</h3>
I understand that Parrot is to run Perl 6 primarily and that those hacking on it are all Perl Hackers (tm). But do you feel that the level to which Parrot, at least the assembler, is too much in the Perlish idiom? Are you afraid that you might scare off other languages? (And if you are, then why did you do it? What made it worth the sacrifice?)

<h2>Support for threads and parallelism</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ponder/">ponder</a> on 2002-05-03T14:34:54</h3>
I know that Perl 5 has had a chequered history with embracing the subject of threads. What of the Parrot? In particular, this could be important to the future take-up, as Parrot aims to be a common bytecode for several languages including Java.<p>
Also, can Parrot be run in a multi-CPU environment (SMP), and
is there provision for instruction interlocks or spinlocks across the configuration?</p>



<h2>Creating Platform-Specific Code</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Petruchio/">Petruchio</a> on 2002-05-03T14:38:44</h3>
<p>
 It has been <i>possible</i>, for some time now,
 to create stand-alone executables from Perl
 programs.  Not the most pleasant process,
 but possible.  Dumping from memory, perl2exe
 on Win32 (I'm told), and so on.  What are the
 prospects for this sort of thing using the
 Parrot?
</p>
<p>
 Will the situation improve?  What are likely
 to be the limitations?  Will it ever be
 possible to create, for instance, a<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.so or<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.dll file in such a fashion, for linking
 with a normal compiled C program?  For
 rapid prototyping, this sort of thing would
 be very handy.
</p>



<h2>Sandbox, Browser, In &amp;amp; As Kernel, Hardware.</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Petruchio/">Petruchio</a> on 2002-05-03T15:12:54</h3>
<p>
 I'd like to expand greatly upon these questions,
 but I'm rushed for time; the questions are
 being collected now.
</p>
<p>
 What are the plans for safe, sandboxed code
 in Parrot?  It would be nice to be able
 to run untrusted code.  It would be nicer
 still if the Parrot could cooperate with
 browsers in this capacity... we might have
 language-independant browser scripting,
 rather than being locked into JavaScript
 or the like.
</p>
<p>
 It would be most interesting if the Parrot
 found its way into, say, the Linux kernel.
 One could envision replacing many, or even
 all, the programs in a *nix system with
 Parrot versions.  Sort of like taking the
 <a href="http://www.perl.com/language/ppt/" title="perl.com">PPT</a perl.com>
 project to another level.  Does this seem
 reasonable, or likely?
</p>
<p>
 But then... if you were going to replace
 <i>all</i> the software with Parrot versions,
 one might wonder why a Unix API was needed
 at all.  Could Parrot in some way, serve as
 OS?  In a minimal sense, perhaps; some stuff
 like process scheduling could be done by
 Parrot code, but Parrot itself would seem
 to need to provide access to hardware...
 this is certainly not part of what's being
 talked about, but I find the idea intriguing.
</p>
<p>
 And finally, Sun has implemented the JVM
 without the V... as hardware.  Has anybody
 thought much about this?  It seems even
 wilder than the possibility just
 raised, but perhaps someone has an interesting
 perspective on the idea.
</p>

Sandbox...<br> <br>I really would like to hear a good answer to this - it was the question I was going to ask. More specifically, the JVM has proved to be a particularly secure piece of software (yes there have been security bugs, but not nearly as many as other products with such a large market reach). We really need to study carefully how they've implemented sandboxing in the JVM.<br> <br>Does someone have a task to do that, and will we be following their implementation, or at least copying what's good about it?
