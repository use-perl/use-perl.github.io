<h3><a href="/user/Matts/">Matts</a> on 2002-04-23T14:53:22</h3>
Yes, I knew it was coming, ultimately Larry's plan is merely to encode regexps as XML! This will make things so much easier in porting from Perl 5 to Perl 6. No longer will you need uglinesses like:<p><blockquote><div><nobr> <wbr></nobr><tt>/^<br>&nbsp; (\d+)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; # id<br>&nbsp; (T?)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;# TP<br>&nbsp; _<br>&nbsp; (\d+)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; # SeqNo<br>&nbsp; X<br>/xg</tt> </div></blockquote> <p> <br>And instead we can have beautiful XML regexps like:<br> </p><p><blockquote><div><nobr> <wbr></nobr><tt>/<br>&nbsp; &lt;start-of-string/&gt;<br>&nbsp; &lt;capture&gt;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;one-or-more&gt;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;number/&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;!-- id --&gt;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;/one-or-more&gt;<br>&nbsp; &lt;/capture&gt;<br>&nbsp; &lt;capture&gt;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;optional&gt;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;string&gt;T&lt;/string&gt;&nbsp; &lt;!-- TP --&gt;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;/optional&gt;<br>&nbsp; &lt;/capture&gt;<br>&nbsp; &lt;string&gt;_&lt;/string&gt;<br>&nbsp; &lt;capture&gt;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;one-or-more&gt;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;number/&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;!-- Seq No. --&gt;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;/one-or-more&gt;<br>&nbsp; &lt;/capture&gt;<br>&nbsp; &lt;string&gt;X&lt;/string&gt;<br>/xml</tt> </div></blockquote> <p>(and yes, I'm just kidding)</p>

I know Perl is used for many things, but a lot of what Perl is used for is dealing with tag based languages on some level. The use of angle brackets I think is sure to cause headaches and line noise. On the other hand, maybe most people will stop trying to roll their own parsers.

That is actually a genuine concern of mine - all of a sudden anything used for parsing angle-brackets stuff has to use \&lt; instead of plain &lt;<br> <br>*shrug*, it's no bigger or smaller a concern for me than the entire thing that is Perl6.

What I'd like to see are more articles on what one can do with XML and the XML modules and *why* you'd use XML for it rather than any other method.<br> <br>I've been casually observing XML for a while (and had to study it for half a semester or so, which means my knowledge went down rather than up) but it hasn't energised me into doing anything with it. The most I do is aggregate some RSS/RDF feeds for regular news emails.<br> <br>So what is the practical side of XML? Can we see more XML and Perl articles on perl.com? Should I absorb xml.com perhaps?

Is anyone else concerned that just as the rest of the programming languages in the world are getting arround to including regex support in the core language (or core libraries), and doing so by adopting the exact same syntax as "perl regular expressions", perl regular expression syntax is changing?
<p>

I mean, it's the nature of things to change, but we're not going to win over converts from other languages if they have to learn all new regex syntax to use perl 6.</p>

In other words, Perl's regexps drive the other languages' implementations.<p>Note that the new syntax is also there to allow more powerful, BNF-like, constructs.</p>

<p>
Yes, but if all those millions of young'ns out there that only know java, and are just now learning the wonders of regexps read about "Perl regular expressions" in their javadocs, and then try to use perl6 and discover that the syntax has completely changed, they aren't going to be eager to figure it out.
</p><p>
<i>Note that the new syntax is also there to allow more powerful, BNF-like, constructs.</i>
</p><p>
Don't get me wrong, I'd love if if Perl made it trivial to write a parser for a BNF expressable grammer, but wouldn't that functionality be better left to a module (Parse::BNF sounds like a great name) with methods for defining grammers using hashes of hashes of arrays of hashes of tokens =&gt; subs?
</p><p>
I mean, consider how many people use regexps on a daily basis to how many would even want to use BNF grammers on a weekly basis.</p>

They'll cope.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
<p>
The current regex syntax is past the point where adding new syntax is conceptually feasable.
</p><p>
Also, if you really really want perl 5 syntax, I expect that can be arranged somehow. If we're going to be able to parse perl, we're going to have to be able to parse perl 5 regexes...</p>

<p>Adding constructs to the current regex syntax has been difficult - not impossible, but the (?x . .<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.) syntax is incredibly strained. As such the syntax needs a change, and I would argue that since Perl is so widely known for being innovative in it's regexes that we should be willing to take the plunge to change it, should it be necessary.</p>
<p>One of the things Larry has pointed out over the perl6-language list is that Perl isn't realy good at writing parsers. We can write lexers and tokenizers pretty well, but true parsers are non trivial. This is a strange weakness for a text processing language.</p>
<p>The angles getting new uses enhances Perl regexes wihtout breaking to much. Newbies Perl 5 regexes will port with only some backslashes to keep tags kosher, most of the time. If we are worried about the newbies, it should be pointed out that at the basic level regexes do what they always did.<nobr> <wbr></nobr><code>/start(.*)stop/; print $1;</code> still does what we expect. Few languages offer 'Perl compatible Regexes', but plenty offer 'Perl like regexes'. We're gonna have to teach the Java Junkies they can't &amp;&amp; their character classes anyway, so why not teach them about angles?</p><p><p>All in all I find that interlanguage communication shouldn't be a reason to disapprove of Larry's changes. The only case where I'd be worried is Python, and that is because Guido himself asked p5p about whether or not certain syntax would be used so that Python could extend Perl's regex abilities a little. Since they are the only ones that asked, they're the only ones I'm worried about. As I said before, if everyone agrees that Perl is king of regexes, then we shouldn't let that fame prevent us from enhancing our regex syntax and ability.</p>

Why is this new language being called Perl at all?

Having done a chunk of non trivial perl 6 coding (A Scheme Interpreter), I can tell you that it 'feels' like Perl. My general feeling was along the lines of  "Why can't I do this in Perl <em>now</em>", and not just for the<nobr> <wbr></nobr><tt>//</tt> operator. <tt>given</tt>/<tt>when</tt>, the new subroutine prototyping rules, lexically scoped subs and all the rest just felt <em>right</em>.

Hmmm.  I've had this argument several times.
<p>
I've argued that this language is still Perl in the sense that the code (as Piers says above) still feels a lot like Perl.  Remember that the stuff always being talked about are the <em>differences</em> not what has stayed the same.
</p><p>
I've argued (recently, with limited success) that Perl 6 is Perl because Perl is the community and the devlopers, not any one bit of software or code.
</p><p>
However, I've also argued quite a lot that maybe it should have a different name (if just for branding) as this is to a certain respect a different language and a new direction, and deserves (at least from a marketting point of view) to have a fresh start.  Somewhat like a sub-brand of an existing product.
</p><p>
Of course, I'm Just Another Perl Hacker, not anyone who's actually doing anything constructive towords Perl 6, so in the end I'm just waffling...</p>

I found "...And Now" a very reassuring document - If the examples are typical of the amount of conversion necessary then we have little to fear. I hope that Damian will be able to update the document or produce additional ones when the regex details are finalised.
