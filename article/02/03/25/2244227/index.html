<p>hfb writes <i>"From the be-careful-what-you-wish-for department:

</i><p><i>A couple of weeks ago I was feeling a bit frustrated from the load on the two boxes that answer to the name <a href="http://search.cpan.org/">search.cpan.org</a> as I watched them being crushed by their own success. On a whim, I sent an email to a friend at Sun asking him if, haha, Sun might have some spare hardware they would like to donate to help ease the CPU bound load.</i></p>

<p>Two weeks ago they shipped us a <a href="http://store.sun.com/catalog/doc/BrowsePage.jhtml?cid=48596&amp;parentId=48589">2-way E250 with 1GB memory and enough disk</a> to do some squid caching. I configured it and drove it out to St. Louis this past weekend and, other than a minor burp that I fixed last night, it would appear to be running smoothly and hardly straining at the load.</p>

<p>So, if you should notice or care that the CPAN search engine is running a bit faster these days, thank Sun and the generosity of a few engineers who felt like sending us a box to help out in a time of need.</p>

<p> <b>Please join me in sending Andrew.Roach@sun.com, Tim.Sparlin@Eng.Sun.COM, and Alan.Burlison@sun.com a big Thank You!<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</b> </p>

<p>I've put a few pictures of Ben, Sarah, the machine and the <a href="http://www.axis-of-aevil.net/archives/000089.html#000089">road trip adventure</a> on-line.</p></p>

I haven't gotten search responses back this quickly in a LONG time! Thanks Sun, and thanks hfb for driving out there to get it installed.

PS. You need to update the FAQ and site info now. Gotta tell people about your sexy hardware...</p>

<h2>It does not work for me...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Random Logic/">Random Logic</a> on 2002-03-26T07:40:07</h3>
I just tried to do a search on CPAN, but all I got was a pretty black page, with the title "Chaos!" written in real bad HTML (seem like some poeple can hack before the can think or write)<br/><br/>search.cpan.org resolves to 198.246.0.28, hope that is correct.<br/><br/>Maybe you should get the real search.cpan back in place<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)

  Great thanks to hfb for being insane(ly helpful), and to Sun for the hardware.

  Is anyone else getting some trouble with Mozilla 0.9.9 on linux for <a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?mode=module;query=XML" title="cpan.org">this query</a cpan.org> ? Mine simply freezes, but I'm very tempted to believe it's a problem on my side.

<h2>Mozilla 0.9.9</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/vek/">vek</a> on 2002-03-26T13:26:45</h3>
It looks like a Mozilla thing.  I get the same results as you (i.e the freeze) with Mozilla 0.9.9 on Windows XP.  Works like a charm with IE 6 though, hmmmm...



<h2>Re:Great thanks!</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/solhell/">solhell</a> on 2002-03-27T11:39:30</h3>
off topic, but since I upgraded to 0.99 from 0.98, there are several new problems I am experiencing with mozilla.

<p>I'm happy to partecipate to the general thanksgiving to SUN. Yep, how fun it is that one of the most important Perl site is being helped by a "rival" language company!</p>

<p>Yes, yes, I know there is no rivality but... hey! I can't traslate better the Italian that's in my head<nobr> <wbr></nobr><tt>:-)</tt> </p>

Rival languages?  Surely you mean complementary?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)<br/><br/>After all, we do ship perl as part of Solaris...

<p>I didn't mean to be rude<nobr> <wbr></nobr><tt>:-(</tt>, sorry if you had that impression. I am really grateful to SUN for what they did for CPAN, I really mean it. I have no reason to be rude with people at SUN, Solaris is one of three preferred UNIXes of mine (the other two being Debian Linux and SGI IRIX).</p>

<p>Anyway, since you published the email addresses to send the thanks to, I'll do it RSN.</p>

<p>Sorry again for the misunderstanding, it really was a translation problem from my mother tongue (Italian) to english.</p>

<h2>Sun and Perl</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/barryp/">barryp</a> on 2002-03-26T17:49:08</h3>
Sun are big Perl users<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... to the best of my knowledge, a lot of their benchmarking work performed here in Ireland uses an Sun-internally modified release of Perl.  It may not be called Perl, but that's what it is.  I'm even pretty sure they send a lot of their new-hire grad students on training courses for the language.  So, it does not surprise me that Sun is being good to the Perl community.

<h2>Re:Sun and Perl</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Alan Burlison/">Alan Burlison</a> on 2002-03-26T21:31:36</h3>
I know nothing about the existence of a modified version of perl (seems unlikely...), but we shipped perl 5.005_03 as part of Solaris 8, 5.6.1 will be in Solaris 9.  Perl is included in the base OS, and you can even write JumpStart scripts in perl if you wish (it is in the Solaris install image).  The kstat(1) command is a perl script, as are the proj[add|del|mod] commands.  We also use perl in several parts of the Solaris build environment.  We have an active internal perl mailing list, at least one internal CPAN mirror that I know of.  In short, yes we use it too!
<p>
Like most other folks, we use perl because it makes our lives easier<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>

..to Sun for the equipment.  It probably means a lot more to us than it did to you!<br> <br>..to hfb for installing and maintaining the search box (with others!).  All this and no nicotine: double karma for you.



<h2>They also gave us &quot;duct-tape of the internet&quot;</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/merlyn/">merlyn</a> on 2002-03-27T18:13:10</h3>
"Duct Tape of the Internet" was from the <tt>sun.com</tt> webmaster.  So, Perl's already gotten a lot from Sun. {grin}

The sun.com webmaster has just forwarded the comments that you have all posted to the feedback page on www.sun.com, and I have had quite a few hit my inbox - many thanks to everyone who took the time to express their appreciation, it is much appreciated<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)
