<p><a href="mailto:paul.barry@itcarlow.ie">Paul Barry (barryp)</a> writes <i>"My book, <b>Programming the Network with Perl</b>, has just been published by John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd.</i><p><i>

I've spent the last 18 months (or so) writing the book which uses Perl as a vehicle through which to study computer networking.  Based on a final year, software engineering undergraduate module that I've taught for a number of years now (at The Institute of Technology, Carlow, in Ireland), the book begins with a 35 page tutorial introduction to Perl.  I then devote an individual chapter to five computer networking topics, each presented from the perspective of a software engineer using Perl.  The topics are: Ethernet Network Analysis, Sockets Programming, Internet Protocols Programming, Network Management and Mobile Agents.   Along the way, readers of the book (hopefully) learn a little more about Perl and a lot about computer networking.</i></p></p>
<p>Standard and CPAN modules/libraries covered include: NetPacket, Net::Pcap, Net::PcapUtils, Socket, IO::Socket::INET, libnet, libwww-perl, Net::Telnet, Net::Ping, Net::SNMP and Agent Perl.<p>

Although primarily targeted at third level education, I feel there's plenty in the book to interest the Perl programming community at large, specifically those of you involved in systems administration, network management and/or network applications development.</p><p>

It is my impression that Perl is becoming more popular (and accepted) within the academic world.  It has (obviously) always been covered in relation to the Web and CGI.  I strongly believe that Perl as a programming technology is now mature enough to be considered for use in other areas of study.  I hope my book is the first of many such "Perl textbooks".</p><p>

<h2>35 page intro?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/djberg96/">djberg96</a> on 2002-03-01T13:47:18</h3>
Personally, I say remove the "Intro to Perl" portion of the book.  People buy books like this because they want to expand their knowledge of Perl.  They'll buy an intro to Perl book in order to actually learn the language.

Note that the book is primarily aimed at students (or programmers of other languages).  The introduction to Perl was included to give them enough to get going.  Obviously, I don't for a second assume that my short introductory chapter is enough.  In fact, at the end of the chapter I provide a list of what I feel are the essential Perl books.  I do think, however, that I needed to include the chapter so as to make sure everyone was on the same (or better) level before getting into the main topics. Note that the 35 pages is a small portion of the 400 or so in the book.  Thanks for the comment.

<h2>How different from L. Stein's book</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/rochlin/">rochlin</a> on 2002-03-01T18:08:11</h3>
Hopefully this book is substantially different from Lincoln Stein's excellent <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0201615711/qid=1015005152/sr=2-1/ref=sr_2_1/104-9527080-3477526" title="amazon.com">Network Programming With Perl</a amazon.com>.   Just from the description it seems like there's a heck of a lot of overlap, though the new book seems more focussed on teaching general concepts, using Perl as a teaching tool.

Glad you mentioned this.  My book complements Lincoln's.  I refer to his book within mine, and they are very different (although on the face of things, they do sound similar).  I really did not want to write a "me too" book, as doing so would not have added anything to the community.  In brief (and as you mentioned), my book is focused on teaching computer networking with Perl.  Lincoln's is aimed at the professional programmer - it is a great book and one that I recommend to all my students.  But, I teach from mine.  Thanks.

Lincoln Stein's book is incredibly well written. And I am happy to see that another book has been published about perl &amp; network programming.

I agree - Lincoln's book is great.  It it my hope that Perl programmers serious about network programming would have a copy of <i>both</i> Lincoln's and my book on their Perl bookshelf.  Let's face it: I'd be a <i>nut</i> to try and compete directly with Lincoln.  That's why I stated in an earlier reply that I feel my book complements his.  There is a certain amount of unavoidable overlap, but we both cover topics (in some detail) that the other doesn't.  <p>I'm pleased you welcome another book in this area.  I hope you find mine to be well written, too.  Thanks.</p>
