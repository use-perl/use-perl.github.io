<h2>Strange goings-on on RedHat 7.2</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/barryp/">barryp</a> on 2002-03-06T14:22:41</h3>
I recently installed  RedHat 7.2 on my laptop.  I was pretty upset to find 5.6.0 installed, seeing as 5.6.1 has been out for (what seems like) ages.  On top of this, I noticed a problem with some of my network code on 7.2, and I've documented the problem and solution <a href="http://glasnost.itcarlow.ie/user/pnb/errata.html" title="itcarlow.ie">here</a itcarlow.ie>.

Interesting.  I looked at your sample code.  Have you tried stepping this through the debugger?  My guess is that there's a warning generated on that line.
<p>
Put a permanent watch on $! and $@ and see if anything happens.  Perhaps wrap it in an 'eval' as well.  Please let me know what happens - we're running on RH 7.2 here as well for some machines.</p>

Wow!  That was a fast response!<p>
Thanks for the suggestions.  I will do what you suggest.</p><p>
Actually I'm pretty sure the assignment to the '$from_who' variable (as a result from the 'recv' call) is redundant.  As I'm using TCP, the connection is already established, so it makes no sense to ask 'recv' to identify the other end of the connection, as the call to 'accept' has aready done this.  It does make sense when using UDP, however.  Thanks again.</p><p>



<h2>Re:Strange ... (response to your suggestions)</h2>

To my undying shame, I had to read 'man perldebug' to remind myself how to use the debugger<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... <p>Now, wrapping the code within an 'eval' had no effect - it still died with the same error message.  Note - surprisingly - that the code that contained the 'eval' died, not the evaled code (which was very strange and unexpected).  The program was killed by RedHat!<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p><p>I then ran the original code through the debugger, with watches on $@ and $!, as you suggested.  The code died again with the same message, with the debugger reporting "Debugged Program Terminated".  Just prior to the programs death, the debugger printed 'Illegal Seek' three times for the $@ variable.  Note, too, that the original code was run as 'perl -w' by default, and that it compiled cleanly (with 'perl -c').</p><p>So, the mystery remains: how come this code works on most platforms other than RedHat 7.2?  Emmm<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.... </p><p>Whatever the answer is, removing the assignment to the '$from_who' variable fixes things.</p>

Ah, yes.  Ye 'ol "Illegal Seek" warnings.  That and "Bad File Descriptor" are my favorite warnings, especially since no one in clpm can ever explain them and there's no way to step into core functions.
<p>
My *guess* is that there's some difference in socket.h on RH 7.2 that's causing that problem.  If you're feeling particularly frisky, you could look into it.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<h2>Re:Chip Turner Gets To The Bottom Of Things</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/barryp/">barryp</a> on 2002-03-07T21:38:03</h3>
Chip Turner at RedHat has tracked down the problem.  As was suspected, my code incorrectly assigned the result from <b>recv</b> to the <b>$from_who</b> variable.  Here's the contents of the e-mail from Chip:<p>

<i>Hey Paul,</i></p><p><i>

I've traced down the problem.  recvfrom isn't required by the UNIX98
spec to populate the from fields for connection-oriented sockets (in
this case, TCP).  I've confirmed that this is standard behavior in
the default Linux 2.4 kernel.</i></p><p><i>

The man page for recvfrom (which is what Perl's recv ends up using, as
can be seen from strace) states:</i></p><p>If from is not NULL, and the socket is not connection-oriented,
    the source address of the message is filled in.  The argument
    fromlen is a value-result parameter, initialized to the size of
    the buffer associated with from, and modified on return to
    indicate the actual size of the address stored there.
</p><p>

<i>So<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... it's a change from the 2.2 kernel to the 2.4 kernel, and is
within UNIX98 specifications (and documented in the man page).  From a
Perl perspective, just don't use the return value of recv when not
using a connection-oriented socket (TCP, UNIX domain socket, etc).</i></p><p><i>

Chip.
</i>

</p><p>And here's my reply (I believe this is called 'eating some crow' in North America):</p><p>

<i>Thanks for this.  Great to have the issue resolved.</i></p><p><i>

I need to be more careful.  I'd written a client/server pair using UDP, then re-written it to use TCP (and, being lazy, copied/pasted from the UDP code into the TCP programs).  That assignment as a result of the call to recv should never have stayed in the TCP code.  I'll pay more attention to these details in future.</i></p><p><i>

Thanks for taking the time to devote to this problem.  I very much appreciate it.</i>

</p><p>It's a case of RTFM for me.</p>

<h2>Illegal Seek</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/pne/">pne</a> on 2002-03-07T16:10:46</h3>
IIRC, "illegal seek" sometimes comes from checking $! when you have no business doing so (that is, when the operation you just completed did not signal an error, such as through its return code).<br> <br>ISTR reading something about how the stdio innards do some trickery to find out whether a file descriptor is connected to a TTY or something, and that this can result in the errno getting set to "illegal seek" -- but that this "error" is expected in that context and is therefore not passed on as an error return value from whatever routine you called.<br> <br>Don't know whether that applies to you here, but still: only check $! if you know that an error occurred (even setting it to zero beforehand won't guarantee that it will be zero after a successful system call).

<h2>I never use the system Perl</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jdavidb/">jdavidb</a> on 2002-03-06T18:25:32</h3>
<p>I love RedHat 7.[12].  In fact, my response after a day of using RedHat 7.1 was, "I'm getting rid of my Macintosh."  The system is well integrated, pleasant to use, and had all the software anyone else in my family might want.</p>

<p>That said, I never use the system Perl on any machine.  If there's a Perl that came with the OS in<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/usr/bin, I leave it alone.  I don't install modules with it, I don't upgrade it, and I don't program with it.  All my programs start with <tt>#!/usr/local/bin/perl5.6.1</tt> so they are hardwired to the exact Perl installation I wrote them with and won't break on an upgrade.</p>

<p>I have found installing modules with a vendor supplied Perl is often difficult, although I think the situation has gotten better.  I would never want to be in a situation where I decided to upgrade<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/usr/bin/perl and broke a vendor-supplied program, either.  And finally, if I move my program to a machine with an older (or newer) Perl in<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/usr/bin, it should just work, and the only way I can ensure that is by personally installing 5.6.1 in the location I want it (/usr/local/perl561 with symlinks from<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/usr/local/bin).  I routinely use newer features without realizing they are new (<tt>my $fh; open($fh, "file")</tt>, for example), so this policy makes sense for me.</p>

<p>So I'm thrilled RedHat upgraded, because that means I can trust any Perl programs they include more, but it won't affect my daily work as much as one might expect.</p>

<p>To us on the fasttrack (those who install versions like 5.7.3 and 5.8.0-rc1), RedHat seems light-years behind.  However, it takes time to do real integration testing to verify that everything else included with RedHat and based on Perl still works with the new version.  Sure, <b>we're</b> convinced it does, but the corporate world wants it tested, and I'd hate to have one mistake leave people who only see RedHat's packages saying, "Perl has bugs."  That integration testing it what makes RedHat better than <a href="http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/" title="linuxfromscratch.org">doing it yourself</a linuxfromscratch.org>, at least for some purposes.  So, a commercial distro can always be expected to lag behind, sometimes dramatically, not just with Perl but also with the kernel, python, and what-have-you.</p>
<p>When did Debian upgrade to 5.6.1?  I'm thinking it was actually quite recently.</p>

&gt; When did Debian upgrade to 5.6.1?  I'm thinking it was actually quite recently.<br> <br>"Depends"<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br> <br>Debian is actually four concurrent distributions:  security, stable, testing and unstable.  Each distribution is a tradeoff between stablity and up-to-dateness.  Packages flow from unstable to testing and down to stable.<br> <br>Perl 5.6.1 entered Debian unstable on May 21st, 2001.  If I recall correctly it went into the testing distribution shortly after that and has been there since.  It has yet to reach stable (which is still using 5.005_03 I think).<br> <br>Debian's idea of "stable" is a little different than other distributions.  When they say stable, the mean <b>stable</b>.  Because it revs so slowly, most people use the testing distribution which means its already been through a <a href="http://people.debian.org/user/jules/testingfaq.html" title="debian.org">good deal of QA</a debian.org>.  Because Debian is so easy to seemlessly upgrade, and because there's a choice of distributions, there's little pressure to prematurely put anything into stable.

<p>Security isn't a distribution actually.  If you must, call it a component of <tt>stable</tt>.  Security upgrades are included in <tt>proposed-updates</tt> which get folded into <tt>stable</tt> every now and then.</p>
<p>Perl 5.6.1 will be included in <tt>stable</tt> when Debian 3.0 (woody) releases.  With some luck that will be sometime this millenium, and with truckloads of luck even before 5.8.0 sees the light of day.</p>

If you're brave, you can go through the modules that came with the distribution. Get those for your 5.6.1 installation in<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/usr/local. Then, in a piece of bold genious,<br/><br/>mv<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/usr/bin/perl<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/usr/bin/perl.junk
ln -s<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/usr/local/bin/perl<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/usr/bin/perl<br/><br/>If the Gods smile upon thee, you might find yourself with a gorgeous new 5.6.1 system.<br/><br/>However, I doubt that'll work in the highly integrated modern distributions. Never know, tho. Shouldn't be unbootable if I'm wrong. A simple<br/><br/>rm<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/usr/bin/perl
mv<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/usr/bin/perl.junk<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/usr/bin/perl<br/><br/>and you're back to your known problems if this should fsck up your box.

<h2>RPM for Modules</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/klotz/">klotz</a> on 2002-03-09T13:23:08</h3>
At one point RedHat had a CD of RPMs for Perl modules; it was called the DMA "Developer Module Archive" and there was one for RedHat 7.1.  I can't find the same for 7.2 or for this new update with Perl 5.6.1.  Can anybody point me to the RPMs?  (I've installed perl modules by hand, but I prefer RPMs for version tracking.)<br> <br>Thanks,<br>Leigh.<br>



<h2>Heckuva deal</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/kwilliams/">kwilliams</a> on 2002-03-15T17:54:29</h3>
Real nice.  Now if there were only a corresponding update to mod_perl... =)
