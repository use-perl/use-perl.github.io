<h1>This Week on perl5-porters (21-27 October 2002)</h1>

<div class="span8">
<p>This week was moderately busy for the Perl 5 porters. The highlights
feature various crashes and considerations about Unicode string handling;
not forgetting, as usual, about newly fixed bugs, and bugs yet to be fixed.</p>
<p><h2>Crash perl by trashing symbol tables</h2>
<p>Tassilo v. Parseval <a href="http://archive.develooper.com/perl5-porters@perl.org/msg88248.html">reported</a> a way to make Perl dump core (bug #18045):
emptying the %main:: symbol table, and issuing a warning. This bug has
been already corrected in bleadperl (it's due to the standard error file
handle being freed when it's removed from %main::.) But Tassilo and
Andreas J. Koenig came up with two other ways to issue a core dump: using
<code>require()</code> after emptying %main::, and emptying %main:: in a BEGIN block.</p>
<p>Rafael Garcia-Suarez explained that this kind of bugs have a common cause:
<em>emptying %:: removes the subroutine or the currently executing code,
which then tries to walk on a vanishing floor, and crashes.</em> (However he
didn't provide a patch, because he didn't found a way to protect perl
efficiently against all those cases once and for all.)</p>
<p>
<h2>Parser crash</h2>
<p> <a href="http://archive.develooper.com/perl5-porters@perl.org/msg87122.html">A
bug</a> reported last month (bug #17589) had been reduced to a small use
case by Dave Mitchell : sometimes, when the incorrect construct <code>sub;</code>
(an empty forward declaration) is encountered, the Perl parser segfaults.
This is due to the annoying fact that the parser constructs here an
internal state that is never restored properly, and this leads to a core
dump before it has a chance to report the syntax error. To fix this, one
could prevent the parser to get the offending tokens by hard-coding the
verification directly into the lexer. Apparently, Rafael Garcia-Suarez is
working on a patch.</p>
<p>
<h2>Unicode questions</h2>
<p>That's been a long time since the last long Unicode thread. H.Merijn Brand
<a href="http://archive.develooper.com/perl5-porters@perl.org/msg88360.html">began
to ask</a> what was the exact behavior of perl, when printing an Unicode
character to STDOUT. Andreas Koenig pointed out that the output filter
should be set to<nobr> <wbr></nobr><code>:utf8</code> (via binmode()), since Merijn is not using an
UTF8 locale. Another way to achieve this result is to set the PERLIO
environment variable to <code>utf8</code>, or to use the <code>open</code> pragma, but this
sets an input and/or output filter on all handles, which is too strong in
many cases.</p>
<p>What Merijn is actually asking for, is a <em>command line option to turn on<nobr> <wbr></nobr><code>:utf8</code> for <code>STD(IN|OUT|ERR)</code> </em> (maybe a pragma? Hugo proposed something
like <code>-Mstdlayer=utf8</code>).</p>
<p>The discussion also implied some consideration over charnames aliases. As
Merijn says <em>that charnames is an exception as such, and<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/could/
warrant promotion of strings with \N{...} to utf8, since \N{...}<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/needs/
charnames anyway.</em> Andreas disagreed.</p>
<p>Later in the thread, Merijn wrote that he's <i>not volunteering to take
over the summaries</i>.</p>
<p>
<h2>Nested FETCHes</h2>
<p>Dave Mitchell reported that  <a href="http://archive.develooper.com/perl5-porters@perl.org/msg88288.html">nested
FETCHes</a> on tied arrays and hashes don't
work, because the fetched values are temporarily stored in global
variables. After a little discussion with Hugo, Dave announced that he's
going to see what he can do about it.</p>
<p>
<h2>In brief</h2>
<p>chromatic added a test for the (previously untested) IO module. However it
doesn't test yet for the new deprecation warning on a parameterless
<code>use IO;</code>, introduced last week.</p>
<p>Dan Kogai provided a patch, on the behalf of Inaba Hiroto, to make
<code>tr///</code> work with Unicode ranges, when the <code>encoding</code> pragma is used.</p>
<p>Dan Kogai was apparently the first to notice that one of the tests to the
new Net::Ping 2.23 module fails on some platforms, due to portability
problems. This test is now skipped for now in bleadperl.</p>
<p>Barrie Slaymaker reported that read()ing on an unopened filehandle doesn't
set $!. Slaven Rezic provided a patch, that corrects also a similar
problem for binmode(), <code>getc()</code> and write(). (Bug #18048).</p>
<p>Rafael provided a patch to ExtUtils::MakeMaker to make life easier for
those of us who keep Perl modules (or bleadperl itself) in a Subversion
repository. Not applied yet. (This Rafael guy also advertised his latest
hack, <code>perlpatch2svn</code>, a script that imports bleadperl patches into a
Subversion repository.)</p>
<p>David Kernen reported that the -I command-line option split paths on
colons (on Unix), as if they were provided via the PERL5LIB environment
variable (bug #18066). Slaven Rezic pointed a way to fix this (but,
although being a prolific patcher, he didn't provide a patch.)</p>
<p>H.Merijn Brand found that the installation of DBD-ODBC-0.45_18 reports an
error <code>DBI version 1.201 required--this is only version 1.30</code> with
bleadperl. This is due to the recent changes in the version handling ;
John Peacock commented that the DBI versioning scheme doesn't follow the
current mainstream model (which implicitly splits floating-point versions
at three decimal place intervals.)</p>
<p>Matthew O. Persico pointed out that ExtUtils::Installed only looks for
installed modules only in the standard archlib and sitearch directories,
and suggested that it could optionally search other directories (e.g.
those in @INC).</p>
<p>Yves Orton began to test Perl on Windows 2000, compiled with MS Visual
Studio 6. Apparently non-threaded builds don't feel well. Moreover, the
threaded builds on Windows started to show errors on the usual portability
suspects: forks and socketpairs.</p>
<p>Dan Kogai released Encode 1.80. Paul Marquess released DB_File 1.806 (and
also Compress::Zlib 1.17, but that's not a core module).</p>
