<p>Odud writes <i>"RATS, the Rough Auditing Tool for Security, is a security auditing utility for C, C++, Python, Perl and PHP code. RATS scans source code, finding potentially dangerous function calls. The goal of this project is not to definitively find bugs. The current goal is to provide a reasonable starting point for performing manual security audits.
Produced by <a href="http://www.securesoftware.com/rats.php">Secure Software</a>"</i> Uses a database so you can alter what you want it to look for. Not a replacement for using stricture or your head but is a good place to start some security auditing on your Perl.</p>

You can also get FlawFinder from David Wheelers page: http://www.dwheeler.com/flawfinder/<br> <br>Flawfinder does the same kind of scan that RATS does so why not use both?

Here's some sample output from running RATS against a random script of mine.<br>
&nbsp; <code>$ rats<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/usr/contrib/bin/difference.pl<br>Entries in perl database: 33<br>Entries in python database: 62<br>Entries in c database: 334<br>Entries in php database: 55<br>Analyzing<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/usr/contrib/bin/difference.pl<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/usr/contrib/bin/difference.pl:75: Medium: open<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/usr/contrib/bin/difference.pl:88: Medium: open<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/usr/contrib/bin/difference.pl:116: Medium: open<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/usr/contrib/bin/difference.pl:210: Medium: open<br>The filename argument of open should be carefully checked if it is being created<br>
&nbsp; with any user-supplied string as a compontent of it. Strings should be checked <br>for occurences of path backtracking/relative path components (../ as an example)<br>, or nulls, which may cause the underlying C call to interpret the filename to o<br>pen differently than expected. It is also important to make sure that the final <br>filename does not end in a "|", as this will cause the path to be executed.</code> <br> <br>Basically all the open statements are of the form<br>
&nbsp; <code>open(FILE1,"$input1") or die "Can't open $input1 $!";</code> <br>so these are reasonable comments.<br>
&nbsp; <br>The product depends on filename suffices to determine the language - although you can override this by argument.

Context is quite important. I ran this recently on a  bunch of scripts and it mistakenly complained about DBI connect calls (where it was searching for potential socket connect issues - oops) and it complained about eval in some embedded JavaScript code (as if it was Perl's eval). Well, yes, but it's JavaScript: you can't do anything useful without eval. I caught many more problems by hand, unfortunately, such as SQL injection issues and in fact most of the problems listed on <a href="http://www.owasp.org/asac/" title="owasp.org">owasp</a owasp.org>. Knowing about security issues is important<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)
