It only works if Google has indexed your user pages.  The wickline.org stuff is really pretty irrelevant.  All it does is redirect to http://www.google.com/search?q=Download+site%3Ause.perl.org+inurl%3AYOURUSERNAM<nobr>E<wbr></nobr>  +YOURUSERNAME (unless I'm missing something).

<h2>guess I'm just lucky</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/wickline/">wickline</a> on 2002-02-03T18:07:42</h3>
I should have tried it with other usernames before posting, I guess.
<br> <br>I've started getting spam on a couple of email addresses I'd used of perl-related postings, so I hopped over to google to see just how many places those addresses might appear on the web.
<br> <br>My first query was <strong>wickline perl</strong> which included two use.perl.org hits... my 'fans' and 'friends' pages. The Google page summary grabbed my name and some surrounding text, then grabbed "download perl" from the page footer, along with the quote of the day... and the combination happened to be entertaining.
<br> <br>So, I tweaked the query to pull up only those sorts hits. I used the word 'Download' instead of 'Perl' to have google include more of the quote of the day. I limited queries to use.perl.org, and only pages that had my username in the url and in the body of the page (without the body requirement, my name didn't show up in the page summaries).
<br> <br>The results were
<br> <a href="http://wickline.org/ug.cgi?wickline" title="wickline.org">entertaining</a wickline.org>,  and so I whipped up simple redirect so that nobody else would have to type the google query, and posted the story.
<br> <br>Now that I'm reading folks' reactions, I can see that you have to be sufficiently like me in order for this to work. You have to have had your user page indexed by google, which means that you have to register and you have to have ether submited a story or a comment or had a recent journal article when google indexed use.perl.org (or have a link out there somewhere to your user page). You also have to be sufficiently invisible on use.perl.org so that there aren't a bunch of folks refering to your username and giving less entertaining hits. You probably also get less entertaining hits if you use your username in your own comments, as they will then show up as well. And for maximal entertainment value, you have to have no friends, no fans, and get lucky enough to get one of the quotes that fit google's context window.
<br> <br>basically, it turns out that most folks won't get as entertaining a set of results as I did. Many folks will get zero hits from google, and other folks will get hits that just ain't funny.
<br> <br>For what it's worth, here's some of the more or less interesting hits:
