So, if you're part of an active perlmongers group, please send me (at dan @ sidhe . org) the group name, putative leader (if there is one), where it is, and either a contact e-mail address or a your group's mailing list posting address.

<p>Remember, if you will, that <a href="http://yetanother.org/">Yet Another Society</a> is not only handling Perl Development Grants to fund folks like Dan and Damian, but is also now the organizational head of Perl Mongers.  As such, they should probably, at some point, have a good up-to-date list of all the groups.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p></p>

<p>
Granted, the Perl Monger group <a href="http://www.pm.org/XML/perl_mongers.xml" title="pm.org">XML file</a pm.org> is slightly out of date, but it remains the greatest resource we have. All lists go out of date, perhaps more so with Perl Mongers where people may start groups with a couple of meetings and then never have another one, however, it'd be good to have a publically-available list kept up to date. Do you intend on folding your updates back to the XML file? [hey, I'll even do it if you send me the data].
</p><p>
And of course, there are side benefits of having the XML file as it is easily searchable and thus enables things as the <a href="http://astray.com/Bath.pm/" title="astray.com">Perl Monger World Map</a astray.com>.</p>

I'll be more than happy to fold the results back in with a "confirmed as of X date" marker.

<h2>Leader's list?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/blech/">blech</a> on 2002-02-01T13:15:42</h3>
Barbie just mentioned on london.pm the existence of a Perl Monger group leader's list, which might also be useful. Unfortunately he didn't mention where it was, and a quick look at pm.org didn't help either. Does anyone know anything about this?

I believe that's groups@lists.pm.org; standard majordomo setup and such.  It's been incredibly dormant for about two years now...

The one I was subscribed to was groups@lists.panix.com, which explains why I haven't heard anything on the list for over 6 months!
<p>
Perhaps there needs to be a shake up of all the documentation that is available for group leaders, so we know who is looking after the appropriate lists, etc. Perhaps a non-public link that can be used to reference material for group leaders, including a form to indicate when group leaders or their addresses change.
</p><p>
Or is this what Dan is intending to do?</p>

This wasn't, strictly speaking, what I'd indended to do. I was planning on building this list so I have an idea of what mongers groups are active where, so if (and when) I travel I can make sure to get in touch with the local groups in case people'd like presentations and such.
<br>
<br>Getting the active list up to date would fall under my community relations mandate, though, so it seems a good idea. After the PythonCon, I'll get that going.

<h2>Don't forget the details</h2>

And <i>please</i> remember to add the state/province and country when you identify yourself--I've a pretty good clue that London.pm is London, England, and not London, Ontario, but I'd rather not guess if I don't have to.

Ah, right. Well, if it said State/Country I'd have put it in. Bloomin' US-centric schema<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
