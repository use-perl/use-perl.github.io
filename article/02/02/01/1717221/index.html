brian, the above line is misleading as there is currently only a PDF version. Do you plan on having an HTML version of each issue? While PDF is nice for sort of tieing a bow on a publication and making it layout exactly as you wish, it is <b>not</b> so nice for cut/paste which I expect a lot of us to do as we try out pieces of code.
<p>
And by the way, very nice first issue!</p>

That's my mistake.  There was an HTML version briefly during the production.  It's not there anymore though.

So the question that remains is: In the future, will there be an HTML version of each issue?
<p>
Or can the code files for each issue be made
available in a *.tar.gz ? If these were available,
then no real need for an HTML version.</p>

<br> </p><p>I think splintering the market of Perl publications is a really bad idea.  Unless TPJ is actively being closed down, having a competing publication in this small a market is madness.

<br> <p> <b>Why</b> contributing articles to TPJ and thus making CMP to see the value of it, maybe considering spinning it back to a magazine of its own, wasn't an option, I don't know.

But I still stand behind my opinion that balkanizing this small a market is foolish.  Also, from what I've heard, working with CMP works well, no problems in there. I hope the people participating in this are doing it for all the good reasons, and none of the bad.</p>

<p>The people at TPJ/SA assure me that they have "plenty" of submissions as it is.

i'm happy to see another perl magazine, just as i'm happy to see another perl book at the bookstore.  each author, each magazine, brings a different perspective to the topic.  that expands the audience.
<p>i'm happy for a less philosophical reason too. i loved my subscription to the old <i>tpj</i> as much as i hate reading <i>sys admin</i> magazine.  <i>sys admin</i>'s page layout and slapdash design and crude typography is so ugly.  perl deserves better.  so do we.
</p><p>cmp magazines in general (and <i>sys admin</i> in particular) have sloppier designs than anything else on the newsstand.  even <i>sys admin</i>'s ads are amateurish&#151;they're embarrassing to my profession.  i had high hopes after hearing that <i>tpj</i> would be published again, but my heart sank when i saw the first "issue" relegated to the back pages of the dumpiest magazine on the rack (or my mailbox).
</p><p>with a magazine, the form is as important as the function.  we don't need <i>vanity fair</i> here, but the audience is certainly not expanded by repellent design.
geeks appreciate good design, too:  <i>linux journal</i> just got a redesign and looks great.

<p>Well, there is certainly nothing like hubris in the Perl community, that's for bloody sure.</p>

<p>I dropped 90% of the approximately 25 periodicals I used to subscribe to this year not because of layout but because of finance and focus. I don't know that I'd subscribe to Yet Another Perl Journal as I think the time for that idea has come and long since gone.</p>

<p>If layout and spin in the initial issue are the only gain over SA/TPJ there may be fewer compelling reasons to advertise or subscribe than you may think.</p>

<blockquote><div> <i>

</i> </div></blockquote>
That really depends on what you mean by "splintering" and "the market" (and, while we're at it, what the meaning of "is" is<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-).  You could say that a <i>magazine</i> per se is competition for TPJ.  You could also say with equal conviction that perl.com, the Dr. Dobb's Perl column, various columns in Unix Review and TMFKA Web Techniques are examples of how the market was already splintered.  I've never heard anyone say that the various existing outlets for Perl articles are proof that the market is splintered, or that their existance separate from TPJ is a Bad Thing(tm).  With that POV, I don't see TPR as a splintering of the market for TPJ, nor do I see TPR as a Bad Thing(tm), so long as they remain different in a meaningful way.

<blockquote><div> <i>
But I still stand behind my opinion that balkanizing this small a market is foolish.
</i> </div></blockquote>

As for "the market", Perl has a very large community, and I don't agree that it's a small market at all.  I would also go on to say that it is already balkanized, and that it is a <b>good</b> thing.  How many sysadmins want to read about CGI techniques?  How many genomicists really care about Perligata?  How many web developers care about Tk, wxPerl, Gnome/GTK or Qt?
<p>
On a much broader note, we as a community do not think with one mind, we do not march to the beat of one drum, and we generally believe there is more than one way to do it.  (If you want single-minded devotion to an idea, there's a snake herders conference this week in DC...) There are many different Perl sub-communities out there, and it is unfair to expect that TPJ serve them all equally.  That's why we have perl.com and the others.  Now, we have TPR as well.
</p><blockquote><div> <i>
I don't know any details behind the project (came as a complete surprise to me), but I see this as a knife in the still-healing guts of TPJ.
</i> </div></blockquote>
TPR is the result of a mostly (er, almost entirely) dormant effort for the past 3 years to produce another Perl magazine.  Jon knew about it when the topic first came up at TPC3, and was quite clear that there was a lot to say about Perl and a lot of different ways to say it (e.g. enough content for TPJ and another magazine to go monthly).  Back then, there was room for at least two Perl magazines (so long as they had disjoint missions).  In the intervening three years, there have been about 5 projects that I've heard about to produce a magazine of some sort containing Perl content; TPR is the first to actually solve the problem of getting the logistics down to produce a first issue.
<p>
Instead of seeing TPR as the death knell for TPJ, I choose to see it as a positive sign of the continued health and vibrance that is Perl.</p>

<h2>TPJ: &quot;Reports of My Death are Greatly Exaggerated&quot;</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/yumpy/">yumpy</a> on 2002-02-06T23:32:20</h3>
I join other Perl Mongers in wishing all the best to the folks over at <b>The Perl Review</b> (TPR) with the success of their new publication, <a href="http://www.perl.org/ThePerlReview" title="perl.org">http://www.perl.org/ThePerlReview</a perl.org>.
<br>
<br>But I hasten to add that despite rumours to the contrary, <b>The Perl Journal</b> (<b>TPJ</b>) is still in existence, as a "Supplement" to <b>Sys Admin</b> magazine, and it needs our help to survive.
<br>
<br> <b>TPJ</b> has an outstanding record of providing up to date and authoritative information on the Perl world. It is produced by some of the most talented people in our community, and
<br>is one of the most finely edited technical publications of its time.
<br>
<br>With our continued support, and an anticipated rebound in advertising revenue as the economy recovers, <b>TPJ</b> could once again become a financially stable, standalone publication,
<br>
<br>It would be a great shame if the historically strong support of the Perl community  for
<br> <b>TPJ</b> were to become fragmented in the direction of other Perl publications, some of which might have the attraction of being (temporarily) free, and ultimately cause <b>TPJ</b> to fold.
<br>
<br>Don't get me wrong, I'm all for competition and alternative sources of information,  but let's be careful not to burn our bridges behind us. If <b>TPJ</b> were to descend from its currently precarious financial condition into oblivion, it would be a great and irretrievable loss to our community.
<br>
<br>So my recommendation is to support both <b>TPJ</b> AND the other Perl publications, so that we expand the resources available to the Perl community, without further
<br>endangering the best one we've ever had, <b>TPJ</b>.
<br>
<br>To obtain more information about  <b>TPJ</b>, see <a href="http://www.tpj.com/" title="tpj.com">http://www.tpj.com</a tpj.com> <tt>
