<div class="span8">
<p>Jarkko Hietaniemi, venerable pumpking of the perl 5.8.0 development, Monday posted a timeline for finishing up perl 5.8.0, hopefully now before the end of May.  It's shaping up very well, and all the help you can provide is welcome.</p>
<p><pre> The Plan as of now:<br/><br/>- 5.7.3 in two weeks
- the Release Candidate One two weeks after that
  (this being the first release that installs as 'perl',
   as opposed to perl5.7.X)
- then RCs in quick procession (weekly or so), as many as it takes
- 5.8.0 hopefully out before the end of May<br/><br/>Therefore:<br/><br/>- test build on as many platforms as you can, especially rarer ones:
  self-sufficiency in fixing test failures highly appreciated<br/><br/>- test as many modules as you can: note that failures here are not
  necessarily the end of the world since this is still 5.***7***.3,
  but of course act appropriately: figure out whose fault it is
  (bleadperl or the module or both), and notify appropriate parties<br/><br/>- if your module is in the core but bleadperl doesn't have the latest
  version, let us know<br/><br/>- if you know of a module in CPAN but bleadperl doesn't have the latest
  version let us know (Text::Soundex doesn't count, it's a known exception)<br/><br/>- there is one module I'm still eyeing for inclusion: Math::BigRat
  (to round off our bignum support), on which mjd is working<br/><br/>- if you have been working on your pet patch, now is the time
  to finish it and propose it<br/><br/>- make Schwern poorer<br/><br/>- remind us of your pet bugs: I know I have been filing many under
  "later" lately since I've been concentrating on the remaining
  EBCDIC problems<br/><br/>- go to bugs.perl.org and squash as many as you can</pre></p>

<h2>BSD platforms</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/rafael/">rafael</a> on 2002-02-23T14:22:39</h3>
<i>"test build on as many platforms as you can, especially rarer ones"</i> : I believe that tests are needed, for example, on *BSD. See <a href="http://qa.perl.org/" title="perl.org">qa.perl.org</a perl.org> if you're interested in running smoke tests.



<h2>Press Release</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/davorg/">davorg</a> on 2002-02-23T14:55:59</h3>
<p>We should turn this into a proper press release and distribute it via the <a href="http://www.perl-foundation.org/" title="perl-foundation.org">Perl Foundation</a perl-foundation.org>. OK, so strictly it's vapourware[1] right now but <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/" title="microsoft.com">other</a microsoft.com> <a href="http://www.sun.com/" title="sun.com">people</a sun.com> get away with pre-announcing vapourware all the time.</p>

<p>[1] Ok, so it's not really vapourware as pre-release versions already exist. Maybe we should jsut say they're betas<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

This would be a good idea, I agree. Of course, you'd need to say what's new in 5.8.0, and why it's worth upgrading. I don't follow p5p; could someone either point out the changes here or link to something that does?

<h2>developer snapshots</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jhi/">jhi</a> on 2002-02-23T20:30:34</h3>
<p>In case you are not a perl5-porters regular (maybe because you have a life, or something similar), you can get the latest developer snaphots from <a href="ftp://ftp.funet.fi/pub/languages/perl/snap/" title="funet.fi">funet</a funet.fi>.
As of now, the latest one is <tt>perl@14833</tt>,
snapshots came out at the rate of about three a week.</p>
<tt>
Configure -des -Dusedevel; make all test
</tt>
<p>and if all goes well, rebuild with some testing prefix</p>
<tt>
Configure -des -Dusedevel -Dprefix=/usr/local/test;make all test install
</tt>
<p>and then you can test your software and favourite modules.  Note that before RC1 the binaries will have <tt>5.7.3</tt> tacked onto them.</p>



<h2>So what's in 5.8.0?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/2shortplanks/">2shortplanks</a> on 2002-02-25T10:29:10</h3>
So we now know when 5.8.0 is going to be released.  So do we now know what's going to be in it?
<p>
Where can I get a list of what reasons I should have for upgrading to 5.8.0? I'm running 5.6.1 on most of my machines now.  What differences can I expect?</p>
