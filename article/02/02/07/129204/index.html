<h2>But can we submit Perl as a solution??</h2>

But they don't accept Perl as a solution only Java and C++!!!!!
<p>
That sucks!!!!

Wow.  That's retarded.

Well, it doesn't explicitly say that only C++ and Java are acceptable, though it does imply it.  You can also list required software packages; so just require Perl<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)  There's no reason you can't write a Makefile that would "compile" and install your Perl script - that seems to be the only major requirement.  And I'm sure if enough people complained, they might add Perl.  So start your letter-writing now!<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

Must admit those were my initial thoughts before I read Sharon's (Google Employee) <a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?hl=en&amp;threadm=9f3197fe.0202062156.672b2487%40posting.google.com&amp;prev=/groups%3Fq%3Dgoogle.public.programming-contest" title="google.com">comment </a google.com> but they still might hold true.
<p>
Even though I have already written my letter asking, begging and pleading for them to accept my entry in Perl..
</p><p>
(Not that I have a clue what I'm doing yet).</p>

Don't bother.  If the contest were being judged on a quantitative measure then you might have a shot.  But it's being judged on a subjective scale by "staff scientists" - read, "dedicated C++ programmers."  They'll take one look at even the best Perl and run screaming in the other direction.

On the other hand, if taken literally, submitting Perl as 'the' solution might work too: "Just install this, and any huge amount of data will suddenly make sense..."
<p>
As an extention, that could allow users to write arbitary data-mining perl code on agent.google.com, to be run in a Safe compartment or so... &#9786;</p>

As if to maximize outrage in the Perl community, they've now added Python as the third acceptable language.
