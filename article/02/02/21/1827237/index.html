for the forthcoming 1.4.0 release. It features many bug fixes planned

    operates in an Apache/mod_perl environment, and uses the PostgreSQL
    RDBMS for its repository.</i></div></blockquote>

<h2>It is worth a go!</h2>

The Bric environment is very well thought out,  the workflow, access control, and notification systems are thorough.   It makes me want to see a design article from the authors, because it seems to be a lot more app-like than ACS, say.
<p>
Although there is a current lack of Howto-style documentation, the code is very well documented, the mailing lists are easy to follow.  You could leverage any Mason skills immediately, and the code is modular enough to envision where YOUR next feature contrib would go.

Thanks to the Bric team for giving me a great reason not to use Zope! (much respect to them, too! but its not Perl!)</p>

<p>Thanks for the warm fuzzies, drowsy. Actually, I might be willing to write up some sort of design document for perl.com or something. In fact, I was thinking of submitting a paper propsal to the O'Reilly conference on building large applications in Perl. Just need to find the tuits...</p>
