Java <i>finally</i> has native support of regular expressions, one of the first things I found lacking when I took a shot at Java programming some time ago.

<p>The <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/docs/guide/nio/example/Grep.java" title="sun.com">
example program</a sun.com> takes 92 lines to implement a file grep.  It implements the pattern<nobr> <wbr></nobr><tt>.*\r?\n</tt>, and if you wonder why that's bad, read Ovid's <a href="http://perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=24640" title="perlmonks.org">Death to Dot Star post</a perlmonks.org> over at PerlMonks.  (I'm presuming the Java regex engine backtracks, like other regex engines I know of.)</p>

<p>Hmmm... now I'm rather curious as to what's going on here.  Here's the regex code to match a line:</p>

<p> <tt><nobr> <wbr></nobr>// Pattern used to parse lines<br>
    private static Pattern linePattern<br>
    = Pattern.compile(".*\r?\n");<br> </tt> </p>

<p>I don't think VSarkiss' criticism of the dot star is appropriate in this case as <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html#lt" title="sun.com">Java documentation</a sun.com> states that the dot does not match a line terminator.  However, they appear to have goofed up the line terminator!  What about \r on Macs?  From what I can tell from their docs, the carriage return/newline in the regex is superfluous.  They could at least get their regexes straight if they post sample code.  They have <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html#MULTILINE" title="sun.com">multiline mode</a sun.com> which appears to be what they were actually looking for and would be more robust than the listed solution.</p>

Argh. Don't have to convince me that Java is a big fat slug, but let's be fair: The first 43 lines of that are comments. A far cry from Perl, but only half as far<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...

<p>I only counted the code, not the comments.  With the comments it's 135 lines.</p>

I believe there's something broken about Java's split() fuction from the regexp class. If you do split(/=/, "foo=bar=20", 2) in Java, then you get two return values, as you would expect. What you might not expect is those return values to be "foo" and "bar". I know this was the case in the betas, but I haven't checked if they fixed this or not. I'd love it if someone could confirm that.

This was fixed between beta 2 and beta 3. eg:import java.util.regex.*;<br/><br/>public class Regexp {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Pattern p = Pattern.compile("=");
		String[] theStrings = p.split("foo=bar=20", 2);<br/><br/>		for (int i=0; itheStrings.length; i++) {
			System.out.println(i + " : " + theStrings[i]);
		}
	}
}<br/><br/>
Gives<br/><br/>0 : foo
1 : bar=20<br/><br/>as expected on 1.4.0 beta3 (and final release), but<br/><br/>0 : foo
1 : bar<br/><br/>on the beta 2.

<p>I don't understand your example.  <tt>split(/=/, "foo=bar=20", 2)</tt>  I presume the "2" means "only give me two return values," because you say we'd expect to get two return values.  Without the 2 I'd expect to get a list of {foo bar 2}, with the 2 I'd expect to get what you say I wouldn't expect: {foo bar}.  Huh?</p>

<p>Oh, wow!  I just learned something about Perl.</p>

<p>I've rarely used the final parameter to split, so I didn't know.</p>

<h3><a href="/user/Matts/">Matts</a> on 2002-02-15T18:57:14</h3>
That final parameter is *incredibly* useful. Imagine parsing email headers, or cookies, or config files, or... the list goes on. Glad to hear they fixed it though.

<h2>Regexps are not everything</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Shlomi Fish/">Shlomi Fish</a> on 2002-02-17T08:13:28</h3>
<p>
Perl has other features besides Regexps, which I like very much. Stuff like nested data-structures, dynamic typing, functions as first-order values, closures, eval, multiple-inheritance, etc. etc.
</p>

<p>
I don't think Java has all that, or should. That's why I still prefer Perl for most purposes.
</p>



<h2>Perl like regexes for Java</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/erikharrison/">erikharrison</a> on 2002-02-18T00:20:10</h3>
Yes, the new Java regex package is almost identical to Perl regexes. The description is <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html" title="sun.com">here</a sun.com>, including a description of the differences, most of which seem to be insignifigant (although I like having character classes be an allowable part of a character class.)



<h2>separate java library offers regexp too</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jeppe/">jeppe</a> on 2002-02-20T15:09:47</h3>
The Jakarta subproject <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/oro/index.html" title="apache.org">Oro</a apache.org>
offers perl5-compatible regexps. I never really stress-tested it, but it did what I needed to do (which was doing basic sanity testing on email addresses).
