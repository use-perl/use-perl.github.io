<p><a href="http://david.wheeler.net/">Theory</a> writes <i>"Announcing the release of Bricolage 1.2.1. This version is primarily a
maintenance release with many bug fixes. It does offer one major new
feature, however. Configuring Bricolage in your Apache server has become
much simpler with the introduction of the new Bric::App::ApacheConfig
module. Using this module, configuring Apache can now be done in two
lines:
</i><blockquote><div><i> <tt>
PerlPassEnv BRICOLAGE_ROOT<br>
PerlModule Bric::App::ApacheConfig
</tt></i> </div></blockquote>

<p>See INSTALL for information on how to configure Bricolage itself, and on how to
run Bricolage as a virtual host on your server.</p>

<p>Here's a brief description of Bricolage:</p>

<blockquote><div>    Bricolage is a full-featured, open-source, enterprise-class content
    management system. It offers a browser-based interface for ease-of
    use, a full-fledged templating system with complete programming
    language support for flexibility, and many other features. It
    operates in an Apache/mod_perl environment, and uses the PostgreSQL
    RDBMS for its repository.</div></blockquote>

<p>More information on Bricolage can be found on its <a href="http://bricolage.thepirtgroup.com/">home page</a>, and it can be downloaded from <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=34789">SourceForge</a>."</p></p>

I must admit, bricolage looks really quite cool.<br> <br>What I cannot seem to find anywhere though is what itch got scratched in writing this thing? Whose site is the canonical example bricolage site? Are there any "live" sites yet?

<p>Salon has been using the proof-of-concept precursor to Bricoalge for almost two years. Otherwise, there are no major sites using Bricolage just yet, but Primedia and the World Health Organization are both deep in the planning stages for deploying it enterprise-wide.</p>

I'm working on a site for launch Real Soon Now.
<p>
I only have time to say that this is scratching a generic CMS itch, in that there are none in perl, and perl professionals spend a great deal of time in other environments because there are end-user apps ready for userland.
</p><p>
There are good frameworks, to be sure , your axkit is one of them.  But this is an app, and as such, I would say that this is "the Cliffs Notes for Mason" to steal a phrase.</p>

Thanks for your answer - I wasn't suggesting AxKit was a replacement - it's fundamentally not a CMS - it's a publishing framework with some cool dynamic capabilities. Of course people are building CMS's on top of AxKit, just like they have mason, but nothing has been released yet. And I've been saying for over 2 years now we need a solid CMS for mod_perl users. Thank god you guys wrote one!<br> <br>Interesting times ahead<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)

AxKit could probably be used as a "burner" (output engine thingy) for bricolage.<br> <br>In other news then I'm looking at using it for www.perl.org and that kind of sites.<br> <br>

That would be great, noting that some people have used Mason has a handler in AxKit!
<p>
For XSLT, I'd rather use AxKit than anything else.  </p><p>
That said, I would use Bric to manage XML/XPathScript docs (you could use the new SOAP process), and publish to an AxKit server.</p><p>
Mason would still be the burner for me. The way autohandlers, etc. work in Mason seem very well suited for the care and feeding of XML/XSL docs.</p>

<blockquote><div>AxKit could probably be used as a "burner" (output engine thingy) for bricolage.</div></blockquote> <br> <br> <p>Personally, I'd like nothing better than to see this happen. I think that Sam did a nice job developing the subclassable burner architecture, and it'd be really cool to see AxKit, <a href="http://www.geocrawler.com/mail/msg.php3?msg_id=7793018&amp;list=15308" title="geocrawler.com">XSLT</a geocrawler.com>, EmbPerl, Apache::ASP, and Template Toolkit burners added. It'd make Bricolage the ideal solution for just about any Perl web maven.</p>

except this thing with the database support...  Wait; who's that guy in the mirror who said he would get MySQL to work?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...?!<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br> <br>
