<p><a href="http://www.activestate.com/">Lori Pike</a> writes <i>"ActiveState released the <a href="http://www.activestate.com/Products/Perl_Dev_Kit/">Perl Dev Kit</a> (PDK) 4.0, which adds support for the Microsoft<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.NET Framework, Win 9x and HP-UX.  Existing Perl scripts can now be turned into<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.NET components and used seamlessly in<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.NET Framework applications.  Current users will find that PDK 4.0 creates Perl components on Windows that are 30% to 50% smaller.

<h2>This is Good News (no, really, I mean it)</h2>

<p>Do we or don't we?  Some will, so resisting it may be like shoveling back
the ocean with a fork.  I'm rather concerned about the<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.NET initiative since
it seems to merely increase Microsoft's power.  However, with<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.NET, we could
write a Perl software service that people can access and utilize, even if
they don't have Perl installed.  Perl seems to do a good job of "sneaking in
the back door", but maybe this can allow Perl to come out of the kitchen. I
don't know about you, but I am getting sick of people telling me that Perl is
not a real language and can't do serious work (ever notice how the harshest
criticism comes from those who don't know Perl well, or don't know how's it's
<em>really</em> being used?).</p>

<p>I can see it now, some Java developer gloating over his strong typing supremacy
and real exception handling (okay, that one hurts<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) sitting down to write a<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.NET component and getting it done in a week.  I sit down with Perl and get it
done in half the time with one third of the code.  Maybe, just maybe, that
Java guy will finally "get it".</p>

<p> <strong>Disclaimer:</strong>  I have no beef with Java.  Like Perl, it has
weaknesses, but that doesn't invalidate the language as a whole.  I don't think
I'm a language bigot -- well, don't ask me about when I developed in COBOL<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:).
I just drop this little note to point out that, in my opinion, developers in
other languages often fail to realize that Perl can operate in the same problem
space ("What?  I thought Perl was sed++!").  Having an identical problem space
means a more meaningful comparison of solutions.  This is great.</p>
