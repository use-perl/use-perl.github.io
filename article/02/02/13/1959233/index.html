<h1>Rindolf - A Perl Dialect</h1>

</div> <!-- /span4 -->


<div class="span8">
<p><a href="http://t2.technion.ac.il/user/shlomif/">Shlomi Fish</a> writes <i>"
I started forming the SPEC for Rindolf - a Perl dialect based on Perl 5.
I'm doing it because I found most of the suggestions in the Apocalypses
and Exegesis either incomprehensible or redundant. I think Perl 5 is
all in all a good language that just needs a little cleaning up. Hence:
Rindolf."</i></p>
<p>I consider Perl as a family of languages rather than a single language.
Rindolf aims to be another dialect in this language which will be derived
from Perl 5, with some influences from other languages, I am familiar with.
The architect of Rindolf is me, but I'll accept suggestions and input from
other Perl lovers (or haters). If you are interested join the
<a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/rindolf-discuss/">mailing list</a> which
I set up.


<p>
What is Rindolf? Rindolf to Perl 5 is like Java is to C++, or
<a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/arc.html">Arc</a> is to LISP. I.e: not as
much a revolution but rather a re-organization of the language to make it
cleaner, more consistent and more fun. Which is good because computer
languages generally evolve rather than revolve.
</p>

<p>
Rindolf will not be backward compatible to Perl 5, because I think some of
elements of Perl 5 are frustrating and need a little re-thinking and
re-designing. I do hope that most Rindolf code will look like Perl 5 code at
first glance, and that most Perl 5 scripts and code would be ported to
Rindolf pretty easily.
</p>

<p>
I told Larry Wall and Damian Conway about Rindolf. Damian said he could
not help me too much, but that I can go for designing it in any case. Larry
suggested that I should propose the changes to the Perl 5 people, and try
to get it there first. However, I see Rindolf as a distinct language and
quite a leap forward from Perl 5. If the Perl 5 declares it as the next Perl 5
or accept its most important changes, I may stick to Perl 5. Else, Rindolf
will stand on its own.
</p>

<p>
In the rest of this scope I will bring some highlights from the decisions I
have made so far, about cleanups and modifications that will be
brought by Rindolf. Note that nothing is implemented yet, they are just
proposals "on paper". Also, they are subject to change, because I've only been
Rindolfing around for a few days.
</p>

<p>
1. The <tt>-&gt;</tt> operators and<nobr> <wbr></nobr><tt>.</tt> will remain the same as in
Perl 5.
</p>

<p>
2. Classes will be declared with a <tt>class {<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... }</tt> construct
and several can exist in the same module.
</p>

<p>
3. An <tt>on_destroy()</tt> primitive that calls a callback when it
is garbage collected
</p>

<p>
4. Globs will be replaced by return values:
</p>

<p>

my $I = open("&lt;file.txt");
print $I, "Hello there!\n";
close($I);

</p>

<p>
5. <tt>local</tt> is gone. Long live <tt>my()</tt> and <tt>our()</tt>.
</p>

<p>
6. Distinction between <tt>=&lt;</tt> and<nobr> <wbr></nobr><tt>,</tt>. No more possible
hashes mishaps.
</p>

<p>
7. Re-organization features: easier stubs programming, a better garbage
collector that can handle circular references, Full Unicode support.
</p>

<p>
8. A command-line switch that toggles proper tail recursion on and off.
</p>

<p>
9. Factories: setting the default behaviour of Perl in an Object-Oriented way.
You can keep several same settings at the same time, and they will be
de-allocated when they go out of scope.
</p>

<p>
10. Unambiguous "x" operator:
</p>

<p>

"hello" x 5 ==&gt; ("hello","hello","hello","hello","hello")
join("", "hello" x 5) ==&gt; "hellohellohellohellohello"
repeat_string("hello", 5) ==&gt; "hellohellohellohellohello"

</p>

<p>
11. General Depreciation of the <tt>scalar()</tt> context. <tt>scalar(@a)</tt>
will be replaced by <tt>count(@a)</tt>. Reversing a string will be performed by a function other than <tt>reverse()</tt>.
</p>

<p>
There are other changes I have in mind which I'm not too sure about. Like being
able to define new operators at the code's compile time. Or a "block" structure
with which one can define <tt>map</tt>, <tt>sort</tt> and friends in user-land. Or a default integrated literate programming Scheme for either TeX/LaTeX or
DocBook.
</p>

<p>
However, I'm also going to consider the overhead of implementing those changes,
and make sure the compiler or the back-end would not be too slow that way. Like
I said, I think Perl 5 is a great language (probably my favourite for most
practical purposes), but I think it could use a little cleaning up and
re-organization. So, enter Rindolf...

You could define:

Please preview your comments before submitting them. It appears that there is some text missing... you probably used literal &lt; and &gt; characters rather than &amp;lt; and &amp;gt;, causing use.perl to discard the unknown "tags"? At any rate, it looks as if $text is not assigned at all, the only thing in the parentheses of the open command is one double-quote character.

I did preview but perhaps I missed it. I used

<br>use &amp;lt and &amp;gt.
<br>
<br>Sorry.



<blockquote>

<h2>Re:hmmm....</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/pne/">pne</a> on 2002-02-14T12:09:52</h3>
Yes, that's right. That's because even in plain text you can use tags such as <b>bold</b> or <i>italic</i> (or <em>emphasised</em> and <strong>strongly emphasised</strong>). I suppose the only difference is that returns are replaced with &lt;br&gt; in "Plain Old Text" mode while with "HTML Formatted" you have to do it yourself with &lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;.

I think what bothers people is losing the freedom and ability to do it simply without going to such a function.
<br>
<br>What is the target audience for this new language?  Do you expect people to use it instead of Perl 5 or Perl 6?  That is, do you expect people to say "I hate typeglobs and scalar context so much that I am willing to use a language that has very little support instead of the very well-supported Perl 5 or Perl 6"?  Or do you expect there to be a large developer following for it?  Or is this mainly for fun?

<h3><a href="/user/pne/">pne</a> on 2002-02-14T09:12:02</h3>
<p>Well, I usually use "<tt>read FH, $data, -s FH</tt>", which is supposed to be pretty fast. That would work even without local, $/, or scalar vs. list context.</p>

I too am not looking forwards to

<br>
<br>I don't much care either way for 2 or 3

<br>
<br>I dislike #4, it drastically changes

<br>are at best weird, at worst dysfuinctional,
<br>but there must be a better way than this.
<br>
<br>As somebody else pointed out local serves
<br>a purpose that neither my nor our can serve.
<br>That is unless you allow my on special variables.
<br>
<br>I am unsure what you are trying to convey with #6.
<br>
<br>I see no reason for the statement in the second half of #11. reverse does not handle strings as

<br>
<br>I had a typo regarding =&gt; and , (I used = $b) would be an atomic

<br>
<br>A hash will need to be intialized with

<h2>Special Variables</h2>

I don't like "global" special variables one. They
<br>are a bit hard to understand and can wreak havoc in
<br>multi-threaded programs. I'd like to thing of a better
<br>solution that will eliminate most of them, while keeping
<br>the important ones of $_, $@, @_, etc. in a thread
<br>safe, possibly lexically-scoped manner.
<br>
<br>At the moment my best solution is Rindolf factories,
<br>which I probably did not explain too well. Here is
<br>a snippet of code from my "Ideas" file:
<br>
<br>new();
<br>$f-&gt;set_line_delimiter("\n\n");
<br>
<br>sub myfunc
<br>{
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; my $local_f = Rindolf::Factory-&gt;new();
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; $local_f-&gt;set_line_delimiter("\n");
<br>

<h2>Reservations</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Ovid/">Ovid</a> on 2002-02-14T00:19:20</h3>
<p> <em>Rindolf to Perl 5 is like Java is to C++</em> </p>

<p>Are you saying that you want to take a Byzantine language and create a dumber, slightly broken implementation?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<p> <em>1. The -&gt; operators and . will remain the same as in Perl 5.</em> </p>

<p>I like dropping the arrow in favor of the dot.  I didn't at first, but I see no reason to raise the barrier of entry to Perl by not using what is almost an industry standard syntax.  I can't think of any reason <em>not</em> to switch to the dot as this will help to eliminate one of the most prevalent (and ridiculous) objections about Perl.</p>

<p> <em>3. An on_destroy() primitive that calls a callback when it is garbage collected</em> </p>

<p>Well, how is garbage collection going to be handled?  Perl's GC is essentially in a random order and this can cause some subtle bugs.  I've had database transactions fail to commit because an object containing a reference to the db handle was reaped prior to my committing a transaction (that was using DESTROY as a fallback).  Very annoying.  You mention later that you want a better garbage collector, so I'm curious to see how you'll do that.</p>

<p> <em>5. local is gone. Long live my() and our(). </em> </p>

<p>I hope you weren't serious about "long live<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... our".  I think <tt>our</tt> was a mistake.  Lexically scoped globals?  If that doesn't cause the occasional BrainMelt, I don't know what will.  "use vars" is better.</p>

<p> <em>10. Unambiguous "x" operator:</em> </p>

<p>This is not a serious design issue that would merit the rewrite of a language.  It might be an appropriate thing to change (I dunno, I have no problem with how "x" currently works), but it seems a bit trivial in comparison to what else you have here.</p>

<p> <em>11. General Depreciation of the scalar() context. scalar(@a) will be replaced by count(@a). </em> </p>

<p>I <em>like</em> scalar context.  In fact, I sometimes use it with "x" to assign defaults to a hash:</p>

<p> <tt>my %hash;<br>
@hash{ @array } = (1) x @array; #<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</tt> </p>

<p>The question that I have to ask is:  why is this better than Perl5?  Further, the changes in Perl6 are so exciting (well, to me at least), that I think you're better off building on Perl6 than Perl5, if you want to clean things up.  I have no problem with anyone coming along trying to create something new, but I want to be sold on why it's better than what we already have.  I don't see that here, but I'd like to hear more.</p>

There is no reason to prefer a dot over an arrow

Are you going to implement all these language changes yourself?

At the moment, I'm not going to implement
everything. I'm just going to write and present a
SPEC of its changes from Perl 5. After I have a SPEC,
I'll see what to do next.

<p>
Making the SPEC is enough hard work as it is because
I need to solve the small problems and inconsistencies,

<p>Best of luck, Shlomi.  I'm going the way of Perl 6, but I keep toying with thoughts of "how I would do it."  (Zero time to design or implement anything myself.  Make that negative time.)  Do Rindolf, but do it for yourself.  Put what you want in it, and take out what you want.  (It's interesting to me to compare the feature set you've chosen with what I would have chosen.)</p>

<p>Don't let anyone dissuade you, because Rindolf is <b>for you</b>.  If you do what <b>you want</b>, you may someday find that people who think like you like what you did, and that would be a bonus, but building something like Rindolf for yourself may be the neatest project you ever work on.  If people don't like it, fine, they don't have to use Rindolf, and neither Perl 5 nor Perl 6 have to be like it.</p>

<p>If you go on to implementation, I seriously recommend you consider using C with glib or C++ with STL.</p>

<p>If you go any further, please keep us posted.  Keep a journal here at use Perl; and/or start a Rindolf site.</p>

<p>google seems to find only this article and a posting by Shlomi on advogato.  Oh, and also someone on the python email lists with an email address of rindolf2@yahoo.com .  Same person as Shlomi?  If so, I noted another weird intersection of space and time: the same person has posted to mailing lists for the lilypond project, something I'm interested in.  (And stayed up hacking on last night.)</p>

<h2>On context...</h2>

Personally I dont really think that you have through this very well.  To me a number of your points strongly suggest that you havent grokked certain ideas, and that for that reason wish to remove them.<p>

The two most glaring examples of this are your comments about local() and scalar context.</p><p>

local is an absolutely useful feature, (albeit somewhat misnamed) that afaict cant be replaced.  Or at least cant be replaced with any degree of elegance without simply renaming the thing.</p><p>

Scalar context is through being part of the overall concept of context is one of the fundamental cool ideas of Perl, one that massively distinguishes it from every other language I have ever seen.  I routinely write code that behaves completely differently, yet completely intuitively depending on the context.
A good example of this elgance and beauty is the localtime() function (as I hope you know well).  If you call it in scalar context it returns a nice formatted version of the time.  If you call it in list context it returns all of the time parts.  So if you remove scalar context what do you do with functions like this? Add a flag to the function? Have two functions? Sounds like a mess to me.</p><p>

If anything I would say that there should be _more_ forms of context (it would be lovely to be able to say </p><p>
<code>
return wantarray ? @list : wantstring ? "This is a string" : wantref ? \@list;
</code> </p><p>
or the like [err i am aware that might not be the best example.])</p><p>

Anyway, I think you should review your thoughts on this subject and enhance your knowledge and understanding about perl before you propose to change it in such fundamental and IMO misguided ways.</p><p>

Do you know about Contextual::Return by <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/dconway/" title="cpan.org">Damian Conway</a cpan.org>? Even if I don't fully agree with having that many contexts, I can understand that others may find them useful.
