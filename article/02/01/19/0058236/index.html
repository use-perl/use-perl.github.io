<h2>Wow</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/bschoate/">bschoate</a> on 2002-01-19T16:41:04</h3>
Don't know about you guys, but this astounds me.  A volunteer-run, user donation-supported organization funding volunteers for a free software project.
<br>
<br>Puts the corporate world to shame.



<h2>Updates</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/krellis/">krellis</a> on 2002-01-20T20:42:45</h3>
FYI, the <a href="http://www.dyndns.org/news/2002/perl.php" title="dyndns.org">Press Release</a dyndns.org> has been updated with photos from the event, and some additional quotes.  And if anyone wants to ask, yes Damian and Larry really did say those things - in fact, they wrote their quotes directly into the release themselves after the presentation!

This rocks so hard.  The very generous donation from the good folks at dyndns has put us to the point where we have enough money to begin <i>doing</i> something with it.  Look for news soon<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...<p>

<h2>What about Pair?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Matts/">Matts</a> on 2002-01-21T10:11:50</h3>
It seems there's also been a rather large donation from Pair Networks, but as an individual donation from Tim Gaichas. Odd that they wouldn't capitalise on the advertising value of the donation...

Maybe they've read the biblical edict about
what makes "good charity"<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)
<p>
I Emailed Tim O'Reilly and asked why he hadn't
made a specific donation this year (I thought
the publicity would be good, what with hackers
thinking the company's turning into a veritable
Microsoft shop).
</p><p>
I hadn't realised that O'Reilly was in such
serious trouble, though, so I won't blame him
if he doesn't this year!</p>

<br>
<br>Actually that's a very fair point. Good on them for not bragging about it (though I won't deride them if they do<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)
<br>
<br>As for O'Reilly, yes, they're in a very tough spot. As is everyone. I'm sure Tim feels pretty bad for not having surplus cash to donate. That's just the way things are these days.

"Bragging" about it is exactly what turns the heads of CEO's and Managers and all the people who can decide where 20k of pocket change can go this year.
<br>
<br>That was the strategic design goal of this.

The fund status page does now say pair Networks, though we are still alphabetized by "Gaichas."<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

<h2>Simcity Papers?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/russell/">russell</a> on 2002-01-21T15:23:16</h3>
Anyone played Simcity and can remember the random things people would say in the papers? This immediately reminded me of it.<br>
<br>
From the article:<br>
Larry:<br>
<br><br/><br/>"Wow! I've seen crowd surfing before, but I've never done it myself. It's a fabulous feeling to throw yourself out over the mosh pit and find yourself so solidly supported. The future is bright for both Perl and the community that brings it to life. Wow!"
