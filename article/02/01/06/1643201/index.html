<p>O'Reilly's got a new book coming out called <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/runblogslash/">Running Weblogs with Slash</a>, authored by our very own <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/chromatic/">chromatic</a>, along with David&#160;Krieger and one of the <a href="http://slashcode.com/">Slash</a> programmers, <a href="http://tangent.org/user/brian/">Brian Aker</a>.

<p>As you may know, this site runs Slash (as does a little-known site called <a href="http://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</a>).  And as you may also know, Slash lacks a bit in the documentation area.  Hopefully this book will be a big help.</p></p>

This is really cool, I would like to take a look at it, but knowing my barnes &amp; nobel I wont see this title there. I guess I will have to wait awhile until half price books gets one maybe in like a year or two<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:(

Or you could read the Slash source code, like we did.  *twitch*
<p>
Have any of the other book authors here wondered if people would absolutely hate your work?  (I've had a few "strangle the baby" moments myself.)</p>

I decided not to care if people liked my book, since I was making so much money from it.
<br>
<br>HA!
<br>
<br>Seriously, we wrote the MacPerl book "open", so every time a chapter was "completed" (each draft), we threw a PDF online for all to see (mostly just notified the macperl list, but that is a few thousand people, I think).  So, we knew from the start that our primary audience liked or didn't like something.
<br>
<br>That's not to say I didn't get entirely frustrated at times, but I must say that the MacPerl book was not as much of a struggle as I expected it to be.  On the other hand, it was done for a tiny budget and without a big organization on top of it (three people total, really).  And it is better than a lot of Perl books out there, in my estimation.
<br>
<br>Sorry, didn't mean to bring you down<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)

<p>
  Do you know if it will be available immediately on Safari or will we have to wait? I'm considering a Safari subscription and this book could be a very good reason to go there.
