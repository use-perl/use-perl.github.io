<h2>No url links???</h2>

Why are ther no links to Matt's Script Archive or the CGI Resource Index. Was it intentional?

Pretty much. Why would you want to link to places like that<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

<h3><a href="/user/solhell/">solhell</a> on 2002-01-31T11:34:22</h3>
Only because their names are referred in the article with no links. As if the athor assumes that these are so well known places that there is no need for a url.

<h3><a href="/user/davorg/">davorg</a> on 2002-01-31T14:58:45</h3>
<p>Actually the author (that's me) assumed that no sane person would want to go there<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

Fair enough<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:). But I want to comment that cgi resources is not as bad a place as Matt's scripts. There are some decent code there.



<blockquote>

<h2>Re:No url links???</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/davorg/">davorg</a> on 2002-02-01T11:55:24</h3>
<p>That's quite possible. But the problem that I have with places like the CGI Resource Index is that they don't apply any kind of quality control on the scritps that they list. Possibly because the people that run the sites don't have the technical knowledge to rate the scripts.</p>

Actually Matt is running the CGI resource index (or was).<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

Matts scripts are replaced by
<a href="http://nms-cgi.sourceforge.net/" title="sourceforge.net">http://nms-cgi.sourceforge.net/</a sourceforge.net><br/><br/>I don't know what Matt does for a living knowadays. It can't be secure programming anyway.



<h2>Re:No url links???</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/holyman/">holyman</a> on 2002-01-31T11:42:30</h3>
Are you joking?  Of course it was intentional.  For years the Perl community has been in what amounts to a holy war, trying to undo the horrible damage done to Perl by Matt's scripts.<br/><br/>Because of him, Perl has the reputation in many circles of being unreadable and insecure.<br/><br/>Just say no to Matt's scripts.

<h2>CGI - Google</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/erikharrison/">erikharrison</a> on 2002-02-01T19:36:43</h3>
We should Google bomb nms.<br/><br/>If you are not familiar with Google bombing, it is a technique for uping your return on Google by taking advantage of Google's search algorithm.<br/><br/>Encouraging people to link to nms increases the chance nms will hit top ranks on Google, and the other search engines usually search Google anyway. I think it's important that webmasters and young impressionable programmers looking for code to learn on should see nms before anyone else.

<h2>Re:CGI - Google</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/pudge/">pudge</a> on 2002-02-01T19:43:59</h3>
Then maybe you should have linked to <a href="http://nms-cgi.sourceforge.net/" title="sourceforge.net">nms</a sourceforge.net> in your reply!
