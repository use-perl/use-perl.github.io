<p>also has given search.cpan a home for the last 3 years<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) The campus is lovely and there are lots of cool things to do within walking distance of the campus. Thanks to Sarah and STL.pm for getting the most perfect venue for YAPC yet<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

It's going to be a great conference.  Thanks to Sarah and the local crew for getting this together; there are going to be some monumental things happening.

For the second year in a row, I won't be able to attend YAPC because of a prior commitment.  If these things were only decided about a month or two earlier (hint hint), this might not happen.  My schedule fills in about six months in advance.  In fact, I signed contract on the conflicting event only last week.  {sigh}  Even YAPC-Europe plans further out, so it got priority on my calendar.

Agreed.  I waited and waited to see when YAPC was going to be, and because it took too long to plan, I have work commitments I can't push aside.
<br> <br>
oh well.

Sorry about that, it was done the way it worked out.  We do our best.

They really should have set the date earlier.<br/><br/>All the students at Wash U will already be home for the summer (unless you're me who will be living on Frat row).  They should have made the date earlier in the year while school is still in session and the campus is abuzz with activities, people and fun.<br/><br/>This campus is _dead_ in the summers.

<p>For those of us who used to work at WU we consider that a feature.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) </p>

&gt; consider that a feature<br> <br>also, dead campuses are what allow events like this to book time in lecture halls and to take advantage of available dorm rooms<br> <br>i expect that most future YAPC's will be on university campuses, shortly after school gets out<br> <br>-matt<br>

That is correct.  We get facilities more easily, and dorms spaces if possible.  <br> <br>Kevin<br>
