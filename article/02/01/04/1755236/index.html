I shipped Ben Hockenhull a new card over the holidays and it was installed on Wednesday. So far, the problem seems to have been solved and, hopefully, the search engine is a lot less frustratingly slow. Enjoy."</i></p>

One of the unsung heroes of the perl world is Randy Kobes. My hat goes off to this guy - not only does he create PPM packages of every compiled module that is really a requirement, but not found on activestate's repository, he also fixes them if they don't compile on windows, and sends the author's patches. Hats off.
<br>
<br>Anyway, he's created a great alternative to search.cpan.org at <a href="http://kobesearch.cpan.org/" title="cpan.org">kobesearch.cpan.org</a cpan.org>.  It seems consistently faster than search.cpan.org (even after the upgrade), and the doc views are slightly nicer too.

<p>There is also WAIT and cpan2.org too. Randy is well appreciated by those of us at CPAN<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) perldoc.cpan.org and perlfaq.cpan.org also point to the uwinnipeg site. There's room for everyone here...some people will like different servers for different reasons. I don't have any more free sparcs or free datacenters to give to search at this point and Graham isn't ready yet to release the code so it chugs away doing the best it can and we try to be happy with that. There aren't many 140Mhz sparcs with 4GB of disk that perform with 97% uptime over 3 years with so few problems under such a load.</p>

I can't get cpan2.org to resolve to anything. IE just gives me the "cannot find server or DNS error". Anybody know what happened to it? I really liked it...

Erk,
<br>
<br>I really didn't want to sound unappreciative of the work you (and andreas and others) do on cpan.org. Lord knows I know what it's like to slave away at something to have it received by deafening silence, or whatever.
<br>
<br>I just wanted people to know about kobesearch too. That's all. In much the same way I think Jarkko rocks, but I still tell people about Ruby<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

<p>It was an inopportune moment to point out that Randy's is better and faster as it took me 3 weeks to find an old SBUS hme card for the U1 and I had to trade a quad PCI hme card for it. Tracking down the problem, getting the part and listening to people complain bitterly about the slowness wasn't a joy either. Perhaps it is too much to expect a simple thank you or at least a comforting silence.</p>

<p>Perl, where no good deed goes unpunished.</p>

Well, thank you. Search.cpan.org is great, and  invaluable to the Perl community. I still think it's the best and haven't bothered to try anything else. Thank you!

Righty-o, we can then ask Ben to put the broken NIC back since the new one didn't help anything?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

This is what bugs me about search.cpan.org:
<br>
<br>jake@arrakis:~$ curl search.cpan.org/robots.txt
<br>User-agent: *
<br>Disallow: /
<br>User-agent: MuscatFerret/*
<br>Disallow: /
<br>
<br>The site would be a hell of a lot faster if we could just google it.

The content you see is dynamically generated and the original content from which the dynamical content is generated from changes rather quickly, too (modules get updated).  Therefore indexing by something as infrequently updating as Google would be both inconvenient and a disservice.
<br>
<br>Don't get me wrong, Google is great (I rarely use bookmarks anymore, I use Google), but it's not just as nimble for volatile data.
