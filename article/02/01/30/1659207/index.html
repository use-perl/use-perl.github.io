<h2>Has been up, sort of...</h2>

<br>The site was up after the server move on monday night, but it was very sluggish -- Never the less, I was able to make a few posts.
<br>
<br>On Tuesday morning, I had sporadic success in loading pages, occasionally getting the front page to load after letting my browser sit and wait for a few minutes.
<br>
<br>I emailed vroom  blockstackers  com to amke sure he was aware of the problem, but since then i've had zero success, and reieved no reply.

This was what was up on the site just now:<br/><br/>this obviously isn't working.
I'm looking at some other contingencies.<br/><br/>--[nate]

<h2>Up on a backup server</h2>

<p>Right now the address redirects to <a href="http://blockstackers.com/user/vroom" title="blockstackers.com">
http://blockstackers.com/user/vroom</a blockstackers.com>.  There's a message from Nate saying
</p><blockquote><div>We're still having problems with the Pair set up, so we're trying to create a makeshift solution using a <em>bunch</em> of old Pentium IIs. Hang in there. </div></blockquote>
in addition to a brief description of the problems they've been having.
<p>Expect cookies to break, as well as finding out which monastery URLs had hard-coded <tt>perlmonks.org</tt>.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)</p>



<h2>They are up at pair now</h2>

DNS isn't updated, but you can reach them at:

It came live this morning but voting was all over the place, most people didn't have any.

<p>A few minutes ago votes became active for most people, but since then I've not been able to get through to the site.

</p><p>Good luck guys!</p>

I still haven't been able to log in, but I'm probably just being impatient and not letting it load.

<h2>#perlmonks irc channel</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/blakem/">blakem</a> on 2002-02-01T09:35:49</h3>
For future reference, a good place to ask this type of question is on the #perlmonks irc channel at irc.slashnet.org.  Lots of perlmonks junkies hang out there especially when the site goes down and we can't get our fix.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)



<h2>Special Thanks...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/boo_radley/">boo_radley</a> on 2002-02-01T14:23:30</h3>
I'd like to recognize and thank Nate for all the effort and work he put into getting the monastery back up and running <b> <i>and</i> </b> for the time he spent on IRC updating the eagerly awaiting.
