I think it'd be neat if we could also rate books <i>grouped</i> into a single unit (the obvious example would be a package composed of Learning Perl, Programming Perl and Perl Pocket Reference, by O'Reilly).

Ah, yes,

<br>
<br>I'm kind of split between wanting it here on use perl, which is sort of an existing community hub, or on books.perl.org, because it deserves its own site.  For various reasons which may become apparent later, I'm leaning towards the latter at the moment.

The good thing about doing it on use Perl is you already have the usersin the database with access etc.  It's up to whoever wants to do it; if you want to do it on use.perl.org, I can help you do it.  books.perl.org could redirect to use.perl.org etc. too.  But if you have other plans, go for it.

Yep, I thought of that too.  It'd be one less login for people to deal with, which is nice.  OTOH, it might be a conflict if we wanted to give me admin access to the books stuff, but not the rest of use Perl (I don't know how fine-grained the access controls are).

Well _I_, of course, am a paragon of trustworthiness!  But there are some shady characters like that Uri Guttman fellow who might be considered for admin duties related to book things as well.  But you have to keep that guy on a _very_ tight leash!
<br>
<br>(I'm joking, for those who aren't sure)
<br>
<br>More seriously, I was thinking generally about whether we'd want to require a 100% overlap between having admin powers for book stuff and admin powers for use Perl in general.  I, being a paranoid sort, tend to favor isolating systems.
<br>
<br>For example, jobs.perl.org is only admin-able by a few designated people (me, Ask and Uri, for the curious) and that seems like a good default access level.

Well, it would require a fairly complex bit of POD (title, edition, author(s), publisher, categories, rating, etc).
<br>
<br>And people'd screw it up (or forget about it) on a regular basis.  With a nice simple set of web forms it'd be easy to add info.

I'm not talking about creating the whole application with one tag.  Just the text of the review.
<br>
<br>There's something terrific about not having to interrupt your blog train of thought,  log in to a separate application,  look up all those attributes you mentioned,  then type in your book review.  Instead,  use a tag to mark off your review,  and either Slash outputs the necessary RSS-like file for bot consumption,  or a web harvester comes along, parses your blog and dumps the text into some web-accessible ratings Db.  This is the semantic web.
<br> <br>If the bookreview tag only had a title (ISBN optional),  I'm guessing you could intuit the rest of the items you mentioned, except for ratings.  Ratings would be entered on the web site that harvested reviews from blogs, as well as directly inputted in the traditional CGI fashion you describe.
<br>
<br>With the straight CGI system you describe there's no technical risk,  just the (large?) risk that people won't bother to enter the data they're already entering in their blogs.

I know you can find reviews out there.  But these are generally all a single person's reviews.
<br>
<br>My idea was that it'd be nice to:
<br>
<br>A) Be able to see what others in the Perl community are reading (and not just Perl books, but other programming/tech books, design books, whatever).
<br>
<br>B) Be able to see how much people liked certain books.  Book X has a rating of 7.8 out of 10, with 200 votes is useful info, though I'd still like to hear that some particular person I trust liked it (but that would be there too, in the form of individual comments/reviews).
<br>
<br>Polls don't really lend themselves to _lots_ of books, plus they're very top down (admins decide what books to poll for) as opposed to bottom up (anyone gets an account and enters info on some books they just read).

I thought that books.perl.org would be the logical place for a community book review site.  With this added request / requirement / feature, I'm not so sure.
<p>
Since slash now offers the friend/foe feature, a slash plugin on use.perl seems more reasonable.  How difficult would it be to note that 200 people liked a particular book, including 8 of my friends?  Conversely, showing that 8 of my friends liked a book while 12 disliked it would be similarly useful.
</p><p>
I don't see the value in reimplementing the logon/friend+foe system into books.perl.org (even if it were simply a slash site), since the whole point about use.perl is to build a coherent sense of community.  books.perl.org might be useful insofar as it would point to a specific area on use.perl...

None of that would be difficult.  It would just take some work, but less work than starting from scratch.



<h2>Re:Re-inventing the Perl book review wheel</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/autarch/">autarch</a> on 2002-01-07T22:06:05</h3>
Yep, I agree that re-inventing those wheels would be silly.
<br>
<br>I'm still not sure that the whole use Perl structure is ideal for a books site though.  The general feel here is 'blog' style, both the front page, the boxes, and the journals.
<br>
<br>OTOH, a books site is more of a searchable database type of feel where you'd like to be able to browse by category, search by author and title, browse by reviewer, etc.
<br>
<br>So I just had a thought.  How about if we shared the use Perl database for user info and let people login via use Perl but constructed basically a new look and feel for the books piece of the site?
<br>
<br>This seems like the best of both worlds, perhaps.
<br>
<br>People would be able to go to either use.perl.org or books.perl.org and log in, but the login would be good for either site.  Then if on use Perl there'd be a nice prominent link to the "Perl community book site".  You'd click on that and be on what looks like a basically different site (different layout, different navigation paradigm).
<br>
<br>Or you'd login at books.perl.org and could go to use.perl.org with the same layout.
<br>
<br>If we wanted a 'book review' slashbox, that's certainly easy enough to do via RSS.  And books.perl.org could host RSS feeds from elsewhere (jobs, use Perl, CPAN, etc).
<br>
<br>I think it'd be technically feasible.  Basically, whatever machine books.perl.org was on (maybe even on the use.perl.org machine itself) would have access to the use.perl.org DB for user info.  Not too big a hurdle, I wouldn't imagine.

Heh, and I'm avoiding finishing an article on how and why to write Slash plugins.  Suffice it to say that it's *easy* to use the existing Slash framework to create something with an entirely different feel.  If books.perl.org is more appropriate, that's fine, but there aren't any technical reasons against having it on here (and a few good reasons *for* doing that).

<br>
<br>books.perl.org can always redirect to use.perl.org/books, right?

<br>Anyway, I really don't know enough about Slash yet so I'm mostly just guessing.  Hopefully your article will help me in that area.

use Perl is in a place where you cannot have direct DB access.  Sorry, it just isn't possible.  Specifically, it is on the OSDN servers, right next to Slashdot, and we can't allow that kind of access into our network.  If this kind of thing were to happen, it would have to be non-realtime.  Also, unless it is a part of use.perl.org, it can't be on the server.

<br> <p>Unless, of course, we move use Perl to another server.

I thought of that too.
<br>
<br>I still can't decide how best to pursue it.
<br>
<br>Here's my thoughts so far:
<br>
<br>Pros for use Perl plugin:
<br>
<br>- one login is easy to do.
<br>- infrastructure already exists (servers and such)
<br>- one-stop "shopping" for users, just go to use Perl for all your Perl community needs.
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>
<br>- I don't know squat about Slash.  I can learn  but the idea of learning someone else's DB wrapper, templating system, etc is kind of a drag (and also a time issue for me).  This means it'll probably take longer for me to put together.
<br>- It might be better for the books site in the long run to have a separate identity.
<br>- If its not Mason I can't use it as the sample site for the Mason book (my previously mentioned hidden motive) but there are other possibilities for that.
<br> <br>Anyway, back to login, I think it'd be _very_ cool to have some sort Passport-like system for the *.perl.org domains, with a login on any system being transferable to any other (well, except jobs since only employers login there right now).  This seems like it could be done with cookies and a centralized auth server.
<br>
<br>All login forms would post to auth.perl.org, which gives a cookie set for ".perl.org".  All *.perl.org sites would see the cookie, and would be able to use HTTP/SOAP/whatever to say to auth.perl.org, "Is this a valid token?  What access levels does this person have for my site?"

Strangely enough, Amazon already does these things for you...
</p>
<p> <i>A) Be able to see what others in the Perl community are reading (and not just Perl books, but other programming/tech books, design books,
whatever). </i>
</p>
<p><nobr> <wbr></nobr>..."Customers who bought this book also bought:".  If that's not enough, follow the link that says "Explore similar items".  If that's not enough, click on "More Results".  Read the reviews of
each title you are interested in along the way.
Read the "Customers who bought this book also bought" lists, ad infinitum.
</p>
<p> <i>B) Be able to see how much people liked certain books. Book X has a rating of 7.8 out of 10, with 200 votes is useful info,
</i> </p>
<p><nobr> <wbr></nobr>..."Average Customer Review: ***** Based on 55 reviews".
</p>
<p> <i>though I'd still like
       to hear that some particular person I trust liked it (but that would be there too, in the form of individual comments/reviews).
</i>
</p>
<p><nobr> <wbr></nobr>...Amazon even provides you with the means to manage your list of trusted reviewers, called the Favorite People List.
</p>

<p>
So then, the only issue is getting people you trust to post reviews, either on Amazon or elsewhere.  If there is someone you trust,
why not just email them directly and ask
them what they think of a particular book?
If you'd like to browse reviews, why not use Amazon?  It seems to me to be a large pool of
potential "people you [can] trust".

<p>
Well, well, well.  We sure have an axe to grind, don't we.
</p>

<p>
All I did was give you a cost-free solution to your problem, which met or exceeded your stated requirements.  Only now did you choose to reveal your hidden agenda.  Far be it from me to suggest
that you soil yourself with free help from Amazon.
</p>

<p>
I'm sure you'll keep track of all the hours you'll
spend developing this, and factor that into
the total cost of your book purchas(es).
</p>

<p>
Best of luck with your little pet project!

<h2>Amazon</h2>

My agenda was never hidden.  I wanted to make a nice resource for the Perl community, that was of and for that community.  As Ziggy pointed out, Amazon is out for Amazon, not for us.  They do these things inasmuch as they think it'll promote sales, not inasmuch as it will help build the Perl community.
<br>
<br>Besides the fact that it probably doesn't have all the features that I think would be useful, there's the other fact that people in the community (and not just me, either) would not want to participate simply because they don't want to be involved with Amazon (for one reason or another).  That would be a problem for a community-building project, don't you think?
<br>
<br>Maybe I didn't state that community-supported and -supporting were part of the goal, but I kind of thought it was implied.

Now, now.  Let's be fair here.
<p>
You and Dave are looking at the "criteria" for evaluating "requirements" for books.perl.org with a host of unstated goals in mind.
</p><p>
Just because Amazon provides a zero-cost solution does not make it optimal.
</p><p>
Just because *.perl.org requires sweat equity to work does not make it "more costly".  (Especially if Dave is looking for his next Mason/Slash project.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)</p>

<p>The real problem with Amazon is that we have a higher concentration of Perl awareness here.  I mean, way too many people out there are still programming Perl like it's perl4 because they've read the wrong books and never gotten in touch with the community.  We don't want those reviews, at least not as much.  The fact that a new guy read a book that never mentioned C&lt;strict&gt; or C&lt;use&gt; and thinks it is wonderful doesn't really provide us with a lot of useful information.</p>

Strangely enough, Amazon already does these things for you...

Amazon even provides you with the means to manage your list of trusted reviewers, called the Favorite People List.

Perhaps, but I've got to agree with autarch, mjd and numerous other Perl people on this one: Amazon isn't where this belongs.
<p>
Amazon can't be reasonably expected to create anything other than a community of book/stuff buyers.  That's their goal, not ours, and they're certainly within their rights to try and create the best buyer's community they can.  But this isn't about a buyer community, this is about <b>our</b> community.  It's more important for us to know that 4 out of 5 DBI users recommend the DBI book, something that's much more useful to us than "95% of all buyers bought the DBI book also bought the Camel" (which is effectively a non-statement).
</p><p>
Another thing that Amazon can't track is recommendations from people who <i>aren't</i> buying books at there.  For example, if 3 Perl trainers have good things to say about Damian's OOPerl, that has much more weight for me than three random reviewers or book buyers at Amazon.</p>

<p>I've covered this in journals <i>passim</i>.
The problem with the Amazon review and rating
system is that people who don't know what they're
talking about, use it.</p>
<p>Now I really don't want to come across as an
intellectual snob, but I'd far rather read the
reviews and ratings of the people who's opinions
I respect.</p>
<p>For example, currently <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0596000278" title="amazon.com"> <i>Programming Perl</i> </a amazon.com> has 45 reviews and an average rating of 4.5 stars, but <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0966942604" title="amazon.com"> <i>CGI Programming 101</i> </a amazon.com> has 43 reviews and also 4.5 stars. Even <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0471168963" title="amazon.com">Matt Wright's book</a amazon.com> manages and average rating of 3.5 across its 46 reviews.</p>
<p>How is anyone supposed to work out that two of those three books really aren't worth buying and the third is an essential part of every Perl programmers library?</p>

I agree! I don't know <i>where</i> I'd be without Matt Wright's CGI/Perl Cookbook. It even taught me how to develop custom subroutine libraries for my CGI programs, and comes absolutely packed with ready-to-use CGI programs to add interactivity to my web site!

Yes, we can do book reviews.  It's best to contact me before submitting one, to make sure we're on the same page, though (don't go through all the work for nothing).

<h2>same argument, different day.</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/hfb/">hfb</a> on 2002-01-09T15:31:50</h3>
<p>The trainers list recently chewed a guy a new ass for having a site at perltraining.com as it might be reinventing the wheel of what is dead on mouldering on perl.org. I encouraged this person to continue on anyway.</p>

<p>If someone wants to do book reviews, <b> <i>LET THEM</i> </b>. Besides, it's usually the people bitching who we can count on not to help in any way.</p>



<h2>Ack, web page overload</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/autarch/">autarch</a> on 2002-01-09T20:55:46</h3>
This discussion is getting a bit hard to follow.  I'm going to sign onto the books-workers list because I think it'll be easier to continue on with discussion there.  It looks like people are definitely interested in having such a site.  Whether its on use Perl or not, I think it'll get used so I'm not too worried about that issue.
<br>
<br>So if you have strong opinions on what features it should have lets keep discussing this on the mailing list.
