<h1>This Week on perl5-porters (16-22 December 2002)</h1>
<h2><a href="/user/rafael/">rafael</a> on 2002-12-23T14:12:09</h2>
</div> <!-- /span4 -->


<div class="span8">
<p>  This week, in spite of the approaching holidays, the Perl 5 porters
  mailing list wasn't completely silent. Read about version objects,
  various warnings, operator precedence design, and a birthday.</p>
<p><h2>Version object updates</h2>
<p>The (apparently) never-tired John Peacock pulled <a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=3DFF94D7.6020605%40rowman.com">another
improvement of his version object patches</a>, that should now, as he
says, satisfy everyone. Basically we have now (in version.pm v0.25, found
on CPAN)</p>
<pre>
    version-&gt;new(1.10)   &lt; version-&gt;new(1.2)   # 1.100 &lt; 1.200
    version-&gt;new(&quot;1.10&quot;) &gt; version-&gt;new(&quot;1.2&quot;) # 1.010 &gt; 1.002</pre>
<p>The integration of this into bleadperl will wait until next year, if a
full consensus is reached -- see the thread for the porters' comments.</p>
<p>
<h2>New warning discussed</h2>
</p><p>Benjamin Goldberg <a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=3E001681.BC9B0946%40earthlink.net">proposed
to introduce a new warning</a>, aimed at warning
programmers against using a <code>$DIGIT</code> variable when the previous regular
expression didn't match, as in<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:</p>
<pre>
    $str =~<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/(something)/; print $1;</pre>
<p>In fact he proposes the warning to be triggerred whenever a regular
expression match is used in void context. Among the points discussed were:
should this be a run-time or a compile-time warning ? Should it be limited
to failing matches ? Should it warn when the <code>$DIGIT</code> variables aren't
used ? What about regular expression with side-effects ?</p>
<p>
<h2>A bit of language design</h2>
</p><p>Larry Wall <a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=200212200035.gBK0ZRm29309%40crypt.compulink.co.uk">commented</a> about the recently modified parsing of the <code>?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:</code>
ternary operator, proposed by Stephen McCamant one month ago. Current
perls reject <code>$cond ? $a and $b : $c;</code> as a syntax error, and Stephen
provided a patch to accept this. However, Larry notes that with this
patch,</p>
<pre>
    $cond ? $a and $b : $c and $d;</pre>
<p>would be equivalent to</p>
<pre>
    ($cond ? $a and $b : $c) and $d;</pre>
<p>which doesn't look like the Right Thing.</p>
<p>
<h2>Perl birthday present</h2>
</p><p>Perl is 15 years old ! To commemorate this event, perl 1.0.15, the
latest maintenance release of Perl 1, <a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=20021218235532.GA852%40blackrider.schwern.org">was
released</a> by Michael G Schwern.</p>
<p>
<h2>In brief</h2>
</p><p>Michael also released an alpha version (6.06_01) of MakeMaker, and asked
for testers, notably on non-Unix platforms, and for complex modules.
Some problems were reported on Windows.</p>
<p>Jos Boumans remarks that on Windows, both <code>'Foo/Bar.pm'</code> and
<code>'Foo\\Bar.pm'</code> could be set as keys in the %INC hash. This behavior
could cause problems, notably with IPC::Run. (Bug #19213)</p>
<p>Steve Noynaert reported a couple of strange build problems on AIX, one of
them involving breakage of the <code>glob()</code> function. Nicholas Clark suggested
that his system (libraries and/or compiler versions) could be blamed for
this.</p>
<p>H. Merijn Brand suggested that <code>perl -v</code> should report the patchlevel on
developement build (as <code>perl -V</code> does).</p>
<p>Dave Mitchell continues to patch the lexical engine, first by proposing to
remove the useless SvPADBUSY flag, then by introducing a new flag
SvPADSTALE, <em>set on a lexical in a pad which has gone out of scope</em>.</p>
<p>Paul Marquess asked for a good generic way to catch C++ exceptions in XSUB
code and to pass them back to Perl code.</p>
<p>Jeff Sumler notes that the infamous warning <em>Use of uninitialized value</em>
would be better written <em>Use of undefined value</em>, as one could initialize
a value to <code>undef</code> on purpose.</p>
<p>Clinton Pierce reported bug #18917, about <code>system()</code> executing external
commands twice on Win32 in some cases, when its exit status is non null.</p>
