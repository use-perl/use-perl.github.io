<h1>This Week on perl5-porters (2-8 December 2002)</h1>
<h2><a href="/user/rafael/">rafael</a> on 2002-12-09T22:44:42</h2>

<div class="span8">
<p>This week, besides some bug reports involving UTF8 locales, the porters
discussed a wide range of subjects, from Mathematics to English, not
forgetting about some old Unix thingies, such as system calls and
termcaps.</p>
<p><h2>Alisiasing magic variables (in English.pm)</h2>
<p>Kevin Moore reported bug #18874 : sometimes, with perl 5.8.0, the $&amp;
variable is not correctly aliased to $MATCH. Andreas Koenig's little
gnomes quickly identified the patch that introduced this regression, and
it was reverted, with a proper regression test added. The root cause of
the bug is apparently that aliasing variables (via <code>*MATCH = \$&amp;</code>)
doesn't work as well with magic than aliasing globs (<code>*MATCH = *&amp;</code>).
In other words, it's a can of worms.</p>
<p>
<h2>Mathematics</h2>
<p>Tels was busy this week on the Math::Big* modules. He fixed several
bugs, and apparently his fixes led to performance improvements.
I won't summarize Tels' eloquent missive, so here it is :
<a href="http://archive.develooper.com/perl5-porters@perl.org/msg89601.html">Tels' eloquent missive</a> </p>
<p>He also worked on the <a href="http://archive.develooper.com/perl5-porters@perl.org/msg89639.html">square
root</a> and nth root functions. Nobody
commented on his work, but I think that's because (1) these modules are
scary, (2) mathematics are scary, (3) quoting Tels, <em>the deeper you dig,
the more sh*t you find.</em> </p>
<p>
<h2>getservbyport</h2>
<p>Alan Burlison <a href="http://archive.develooper.com/perl5-porters@perl.org/msg89644.html">found
that getservbyport()</a>, unlike getservbyname(), doesn't
accept an empty string as its second argument (the protocol). This is not
consistent (and not consistent with the <code>getservent(3)</code> manpage.) Slaven
Rezic provided a fix.</p>
<p>
<h2>$ENV{TERM} and taint checks</h2>
<p>After some discussion on the causes of bug #18717, Rafael Garcia-Suarez
put in minor change in the set of characters that are considered to be
<a href="http://archive.develooper.com/perl5-porters@perl.org/msg89431.html">safe
in $ENV{TERM}</a> regarding the tainting mechanism. Now, if you run perl
with -T, and if your terminal name contains a character which is
non-alphanumeric and not in <code>[-_.+]</code>, perl will consider $ENV{TERM}
tainted.</p>
<p>
<h2>More UTF8 locale bugs</h2>
<p>UTF8-locale-related bugs continue to flood the porters. Wilbur Goltermann
reported bug #18857, about a <code>s///</code> substitution that fails with a
coredump, under a UTF8 locale. Vilem Marsik reported a bug in the perl
debugger (#18915) that appears to be related to a capturing regexp that
doesn't like UTF8. Bug #18931, reported by Bhavesh Davda, is about a
<code>\U...\E</code> expression not behaving correctly, also under an UFT8 locale.
It seems to be related as well to regular expressions. Last but not least,
warnings reported by perl are not UTF8-aware (bug-#5956-revival).</p>
<p>
<h2>ExtUtils::ParseXS</h2>
<p>Ken Williams is working on converting xsubpp (the part of MakeMaker that
preprocesses XS files to C code) into a module, for which he proposed the
name <a href="http://archive.develooper.com/perl5-porters@perl.org/msg89698.html">ExtUtils::ParseXS</a>. He explains : <em>The reason I'm doing this is so
that the functionality can be used in other contexts, other platforms, and
other build environments like Module::Build.</em> Brian Ingerson found the
idea interesting for Inline::C.</p>
<p>
<h2>In brief</h2>
<p>Hugo van der Sanden integrated into the core the new version of perldoc
(and the relevant Pod::Perldoc::* modules), by Sean M. Burke. (This new
perldoc is also available from the CPAN.)</p>
<p>Nicholas Clark fixed the bug (#18651) reported last week, pertaining to
restricted hashes.</p>
<p>Rafael fixed three obscure memory corruption bugs in the
lexer, and apparently found some other ones.</p>
<p>
