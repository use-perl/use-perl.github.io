<h1>This Week on perl5-porters (9-15 September 2002)</h1>

<div class="span8">
<p>This was not a very busy week, with people packing for YAPC::Europe, and all that... Nevertheless, the smoke tests were running, the bug reports
were flying, and an appropriate amount of patches were sent. Read about printf formats, serialized tied thingies, built-in leak testing, syntax
oddities, et alii.</p>
<p><h2>printf format documentation</h2>
<p>Allen Smith pointed out (in bug report #17075) that the documentation
for printf in perlfunc is innaccurate regarding the <code>%g</code> and <code>%G</code> format
specifiers. In fact, the thread goes through commentary of the C standard,
and its implementation (or should I say interpretation) on various
platforms (e.g. the availability of the <code>long long</code> type).</p>
<pre>
    <a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=rt-17075-36916.14.3025032754936%40bugs6.perl.org">http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=...</a> </pre>
<p>
<h2>Data::Dumper and tied objects</h2>
<p>Slaven Rezic asked whether Data::Dumper should support tied objects. Brian
Ingerson answered that no, his opinion is that the tiedness should lay
outside of serialization.</p>
<p>Slaven also provided a new test file for Data::Dumper, containing some
TODO tests for a bug he just found. Apparently this is a rather obscure
bug, which <em>seems only be triggered if Freeze/Thaw is used in the pure
perl version of Dump (Dumpxs works fine) and the object type changes.</em> </p>

<p>
<h2> <code>-DLEAKTEST</code> doesn't work</h2>
<p>It has been reported (bug #17197) that perl 5.8.0 cannot be built with
threads and with the CPP symbol <code>LEAKTEST</code> (once referred to in perlrun.)
Andy Dougherty mentioned that <em>LEAKTEST didn't really work in any case,
and has not really been supported since before version 5.000.</em>
Nick Ing-Simmons and H.Merijn Brand voted for its removal.</p>

<p>
<h2>Testing for magic</h2>
<p>The discussion on v-strings from the previous week continued. The new
v-strings, if you don't remember, are scalars with 'V'-magic attached to
them. So, to test whether a given scalar is a v-string, we should test
whether it has 'V' magic. It's possible with XS or by using the B module,
but that's not actually very straightforward, so John Peacock proposed a
patch to add a function <code>isvstring()</code> to Scalar::Util.</p>

<p>
<h2>Syntax incompatibility with the<nobr> <wbr></nobr><code>//</code> operator</h2>
<p>Rafael Garcia-Suarez found that</p>
<pre>
    sub f ($) { } f $x / 2;</pre>
<p>wasn't anymore accepted by bleadperl. This was due to a parsing
incompatibility introduced by the new<nobr> <wbr></nobr><code>//</code> operator. This was
corrected, but the following construct is still a syntax error with
bleadperl<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:</p>
<pre>
    print $fh<nobr> <wbr></nobr>//;</pre>

    <a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=20020912151731.1076c91b.rgarcia%40hexaflux.com">http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=...</a> </pre>
<p>
<h2>In brief</h2>
<p>After some gcc-ism being tracked down, ANSI C compilers are now able to
compile Nicholas Clark's copy-on-write code.</p>
<p>H.Merijn Brand has now write access to the Perforce repository where the
source for bleadperl is kept.</p>
<p>Josh b Jore noticed (bug #17088) that once a scalar variable is
local()ised, its <code>pos()</code> is lost.</p>
<p>Perl 5.8.0 can't be built on NetBSD/alpha with an older gcc, due to a bug
in gcc's optimizer. The fix is to pick up a newest compiler, or to compile
without optimization. Jarkko Hietaniemi provided a patch to the hintsfile
for NetBSD to check this. (Bug #17174.)</p>
<p>chromatic proposed a patch that reimplements AutoLoader::import() to avoid
a dependency on the Exporter module. Not applied, it was flawed. So he
proposed a second (better) patch, that waits for its turn in the queue.</p>
<p>Alain Barbet provided a impressive stack of smoke tests (various
combinations of Cygwin, Solaris, Linux, *BSD, on Sparc, PPC and x86!)</p>
<p>Following a bug report (#17208) by Vincent Lefevre to fix small typos in
the perlmodlib man page, I found that it included an incomplete list of
modules. Fixed.</p>
<p> <code>Cwd::chdir('.')</code> apparently hangs on Solaris. Bug #17227, reported by
Akim Demaille, and on which nobody commented.</p>
<p>Brian Korver reported that the <code>alarm()</code> system call is broken with perl
5.8.0, at least on FreeBSD, when mixed with the <code>gethostbyname()</code> system
call. See bug #17341. This is probably caused by the new safe signals
in perl 5.8.0 (see the corresponding entry in perldelta).</p>
