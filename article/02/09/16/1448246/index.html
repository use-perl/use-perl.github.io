Ignoring the speed issue, the java code is 100 lines long vs. 15 for the perl. Though the perl code isn't that well written it is both easier to maintain and extend than the java equivalent.
<p>
I think it would have been less deceptive if the Java code used regular expressions making it more of a fair test.</p>

<h2>Uhmmm. the java code isn't using regex's</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/LunaticLeo/">LunaticLeo</a> on 2002-09-16T16:04:34</h3>
The java code posted in that link is not using Java Regular expressions; ie java.util.regex. Hence, the equivalent code in perl should not be using Perl Regular expressions, instead using index().<p>

This kind of think irks me. The author didn't even try to compare apples to apples. He compared fixed string indexing to perl regexes. Furhter, the code structure was fundementally different.</p><p>

What a joke.</p>

<p>"<em>the equivalent code in perl should not be using Perl Regular expressions, instead using index().</em>"</p>

<p>What I think you were saying is that the Java code should have been using regexes, but if you were saying that without regexes (a relatively recent addition to Java), Perl's should have also been excluded, then I would have to disagree.  If I am going to compare, say, the performance of C and Java, I can't argue that Java isn't allowed to use OO features because C lacks them.  If I use both Perl and Prolog to solve the 'N-Queens' problem, I can't arbitrarily rule that unification is not allowed because Perl doesn't have it.  Should we argue that because Java doesn't allow variable interpolation that Perl must use <tt>printf</tt>?</p>

<p>If, in a comparison of languages, we exclude features because one of the languages doesn't have the appropriate feature, we're reduced down to the lowest common denominator.  In fact, it might even be <em>impossible</em> to compare a Logic language to a Procedural one for some problems that both can solve.</p>

<p>When comparing languages, it's important to let those languages use their proper strengths.  Otherwise, there is no real comparison beyond whether or not language X can execute a <tt>for</tt> loop faster than language Y.</p>

In a general language comparison, I would agree with your point. But the articles author threw down the guantlet of "Pattern Matching" then compared a trivial feature of Java, the string indexer method indexOf(), to the non-trivial regex engine of perl. I believe when comparing specific language features, you should try to keep the comparison as close to possible, OR make the bolder argument that disparate features are required by good idiomatic practice.

<h2>Precompile regexes</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/m2/">m2</a> on 2002-09-16T16:06:47</h3>
<p>First thing to say is that the author is comparing substring matches with regex matches.  Someone already posted code to convert the Perl version to substring matches.</p>
<p>Second, this code:</p>
<code>
@fileext=("\\.gif","\\.jpg","\\.css","\\.GIF","\\.JPG","\\.CSS");<br><nobr> <wbr></nobr>...<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;foreach $fileext (@fileext) {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;next LINE if ($_ =~<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/$fileext HTTP/);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}</code>
<p>recompiles the regex every time it's evaluated.  Something like this is better, methinks:</p>
<code>
@fileext=qw( gif jpg css GIF JPG CSS );<br>
$fileextre="\.(?:" . join("|", @fileext) . ") HTTP";<br>
$fileextre=qr/$fileextre/o;<br><nobr> <wbr></nobr>...<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;next LINE if<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/$fileextre/;
</code>
<p>Which is, IMO, easier to read inside a larger blob of code.</p>

Hmm. For me (perl 5.6.1), I get slightly <i>slower</i> times using precompiled regexes.  Of course, the<nobr> <wbr></nobr><tt>/o</tt> is a nice boost.<br>



<blockquote>

<h2>Re:Precompile regexes</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/bart/">bart</a> on 2002-09-22T22:08:22</h3>
Yeah, me too. Tests have shown that<br> <code> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; next if<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/$patA|$patB/o<br> </code> <br>is quite a bit slower than<br> <code> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; next if<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/$patA/o ||<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/$patB/o<br> </code> <br>So I imagine that a faster way could be to construct a Perl expression as a string, and eval it, to compile it and include it in you code.<br> <br>Also, as long as you don't modify the patterns, it turns out that the<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/o doesn't gain you too much any more (unlike in the old days), because Perl does some "Is it the same string? Oh, then I won't recompile!" optimisation behind the scenes.<br> <br>You'll see an immediate slowdown as soon as you start changing the pattern for one regex.

As soon as I saw that ~100 line Java program, I immediately wrote a one-line Perl equivalent:<br> <br> <tt>while () { print unless<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/^(192\.(9|18|29)\.|\.(?i:(gif|jpg|css)) HTTP)/; }</tt> <br> <br>Of course, you could match his argument conventions precisely, but why bother?  This form is the normal Perl way to do it, and the author's Perl and Java arguments were already different.<br> <br>I haven't benchmarked this one-liner, but I bet it's faster than the author's Perl version, and likely faster than the Java code as well.  It might be a shade faster to drop the outermost parens, and avoid capturing with <tt>(?:...)</tt> and avoid an alternation by replacing <tt>9|18|29</tt> with <tt>2?9|18</tt>, but these would come at the expense of readability and might not make a noticable performance impact.<br> <br>Also, that one line of Perl code took me only about 2 minutes to write (slowed down slightly be double-checking the <tt>(?i:...)</tt> construct).  I'm betting that 100 lines of Java code took quite a bit longer to write and debug, and it's harder to maintain 100 lines of code than one.  In real life, I'd probably have used a<nobr> <wbr></nobr><tt>/i</tt> modifier on the end of the regex instead of using the less-readable <tt>(?i:...)</tt> construct, but I wanted to match <i>exactly</i> what the author was matching to make it a valid comparison.<br> <br>As far as I'm concerned, Perl's "home turf" includes being efficient for the <i>programmer</i> to write programs.  Sometimes, highly-optimized runtime is important, but optimizing <i>programming time</i> is frequently more valuable.  Even so, short Perl programs like this often have hard-to-beat runtimes if written well, so you can often have your cake and eat it too...

<p>Seriously folks, Java is a nice language and all, but why not use the right tool for the job? As demonstrated most effectively by Professor Hoffman, it's quite cumbersome to parse text files using Java. Now with Perl, you can do something like this:</p>

<p> <code>perl -ne "print unless<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/^192\.(9|18|29)\./o||/\.(gif|jpg|css|GIF|JPG|CSS) HTTP/o" &lt; access-log &gt; clean-log</code> </p>

<p>Heck, you could even make it your<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.sig. Not to mention that it runs faster than the Java version. The regex solution is even a tad bit faster than testing individual values using the index function. Go figure.</p>

Oddly enough, I can't see how that would make it go any faster than Java's non-regex solution.  It seems like it would only lose ground!

<p>Those two o's above, as in<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/.../o, seem quite useless because the regex's are constant. Is there a reason for them?</p>

<p>I guess not<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)  Silly me, I thought<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/o always helped when using the same regex pattern in a loop such as this. And I hadn't thought about specifying the non-capturing syntax, also suggested in this thread. The final result:</p>

<p> <code>perl -ne "print unless<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/^192\.(?:9|18|29)\./||/\.(?:gif|jpg|css|GIF|JPG|CSS) HTTP/" &lt; input &gt; output</code> </p>

<p>The fastest of all so far... any other improvements?</p>

Try the following... if you are much more likely to have gif, jpg, css file than local files switch the regexps around and try:
</p>
<p>
<code>
perl -ne 'print unless<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/\.(?:gif|jpg|css|GIF|JPG|CSS) HTTP/||/^192\.(?:9|18|29)\./;' input &gt; output
</code>
</p>

Wouldn't an immediate retraction be in order,
showing the perl one-liner and java 100-liner
side by side with corrected timings?
(and a note that the benchmark was designed for the purposes of java advocacy).

<p>It is faster still if you use non-capturing parens. i.e. change (9|18|29) to (?:9|18|29), ditto for the parens around gif|jpg etc. And the 'o' modifier should be removed.</p>

It's much faster still if you don't use alternation in the regex.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/foo/ ||<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/bar/ is significantly faster than<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/(foo|bar), since the former will be optimized to a pair of substr matches.

Everyone knows that java is a piece of shit made by out of an ass handed losers to make money on even worst losers.<br/><br/>You have to be a retard to choose java over perl.
