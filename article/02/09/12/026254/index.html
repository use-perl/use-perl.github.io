<p>CMP, owners of <a href="http://www.tpj.com/">The Perl Journal</a>, have brought the journal back, in the form of an online monthly magazine, in PDF form.  The subscription rate is $12 a year.  They need 3,000 subscriptions to move forward (no word if existing subscriptions will be honored, or included in the 3,000).  <a href="http://www.tpj.com/">Read the site</a> for more details.

<p>I think some of the more interesting notes are that it will include "a healthy dose of opinion", as well a broadening of coverage including languages other than Perl (will this mean a name change?) and platforms other than Unix (I'd always thought one of TPJ's strengths was that it covered a wide variety of platforms).</p></p>

It's interesting that The Perl Journal is moving from a print mag to PDF, while - at the same time - brian d foy is trying to move The Perl Review from PDF to a print mag<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... PDF's are fine, but there's something about getting a Perl mag in the mail!

Maybe I should offer the same deal.  If 3000 people give me $12 dollars, I'll make 4 print issues in the next year.  It's completely doable---I think we've figure out putting a magazine together by now<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

<i>If 3000 people give me $12 dollars</i> <br> <br>You only need 2999 now. <br> <br>You might want to consider having your paypal donation link(s) have a $12 option hardcoded, in addition to the $2 link now. I  had to do the whole thing manually to send you $12. No big deal, but...<br> <br>Just a thought. Good luck!

Brian,<br> <br>I thought that the PDF publication route was brilliant. XP publishing that works.<br> <br>Why take a step backwards and produce a <br>print version with all the troubles and loss that<br>it entails?<br> <br>Maybe a HTML online version would be a better idea.<br>Or even producing each article in its oen separated PDF file (Maybe). That is who the developerworks site from IBM works wich is not too bad.<br> <br>Why kill more trees than what is necessary?<br> <br>Content is the key, not the transport!<br> <br>Sergio<br> <br>

I would produce a print version if people wanted it.  Content is not key - readers are.  Content makes no difference if nobody reads it.  A lot of people have asked for a print version. A lot places around the world do not have easy access to the internet, and some that do don't have fast access.<br> <br>I still read print magazines because I can take them places I wouldn't take a computer, or I can read them between 0 and 10,000 feet on an airplane, or on the subway, or other places.  A lot of people have told me they want a print magazine for similar reasons.<br> <br>it's a readers choice issue.  If enough people would like a print magazine, I will make one.  I just need people to put their money on the table.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br> <br>I like the idea of separate PDFs for each article though.  Look for that soon.  We're also working on HTML versions, but if anyone wants to help out with that they can convert what's already in CVS and I'll figure out an appropriate award.

There is a lot of good information elsewhere, and I hope to be able to add to that information through TPR.  Although we reproduced a few existing things to get going, we have been adding new things and giving more people a chance to express themselves.  We've published a lot of first-time writers who probably wouldn't make it onto Perl.com, for instance.<br> <br>We're trying to hit topics that other people haven't explored.  One hole in the Perl literature is how it plays with other tools.  We've published articles about Perl's relationship to Python and Java, and have one in the works on Ruby.  We also want to work on the perception that Perl isn't good for programming in the large, so we're working on some testing and quality control articles too.  I was really pleased to add Phil Crow's article on how he uses Perl to teach his college courses.<br> <br>I'm reading <i>I Thought My Father was God</i>, the collected works of the National Story Project.  Paul Auster put the book together because he got many good story submissions that he couldn't read on the radio.  I think TPR and TPJ provide the same opportunity for people---they'll write if someone else might publish it<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

&gt; as well a broadening of coverage including languages other than Perl (will this mean a name change?) and platforms other than Unix (I'd always thought one of TPJ's strengths was that it covered a wide variety of platforms). <br> <br>You all know that this means "not enough Java/.Net and not enough Windows".<br>

Shudder.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)  But I can't see how they thought TPJ didn't cover Windows enough, unless they want half the magazine to cover Windows<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... aieeeeeee!<br> <br>I do expect to see articles on Mac OS X, though, so that's a good thing.<br>

Nah, it just means we've assimilated them into the Parrot collective. I expect we'll see articles on Scheme, Forth, and Befunge-93 in it soon.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

Like there's any shortage of *that* around here.  <p>
I'd site threads in p6i, p6l, use perl, perlmonks, usenet, perl blogs, and p5p but there isn't <i>nearly</i> enough room...</p>

Maybe they mean a healthier <em>level</em> of opinion.  That, of course, would be less than found anywhere else.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
