<h2>Perl 6: The Big Knob Release</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jjohn/">jjohn</a> on 2002-09-06T19:00:42</h3>
<p>As has been mentioned, Larry believes Perl 6 will have more robust policy tools to allow programmers all the B&amp;D-style development they've come to expect from other languages. In the spirit of Red Hat, I suggest we begin giving releases titles. Therefore, Perl 6 should be called 'The Big Knob Release' -- something for both Perl boosters and booers to cheer. Think of the T-shirt sales!</p>

Great idea.  Although do we even dare start a thread about what title to give instead of "pumpking"?

I have to say I was quite surprised when Larry said, "We'll be sticking with explicit <i>my</i> declarations".  Gah!  How did Ruby get it wrong by using implicit lexical scoping?  It's better to have <i>my</i> sprayed everywhere?  If globals are the exception to the rule in virtually every program, why make them the default scope?  I thought this was one thing that would *definitely* be changed.
<p>
Blech.</p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; my $x = shift;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; if($x) {<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; $y = 'yes';<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; } else {<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; $y = 'no';<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; }<br>}<br> </code> <br>So... Is there one $y, or two? What is the scope of these $y's? Implicit lexical scoping would, IMO, mean that there are two variable's $y, both limited to their own block.<br> <p>I think this is what Larry means when he says that this kind of features look nice in short examples, but break down in larger code.<br></p>

<i>Let me give you this example:</i>
<p>
So, you're not using <i>strict</i>?  And *not* using <i>strict</i> is about the only way you can make an argument for this it seems to me.  Since the hard-and-fast rule in Perl *is* to use <i>strict</i>, situations like this just don't occur.
</p><p>
In addition, you can emulate <i>my</i> in Ruby by simply pre-declaring the variable.</p><blockquote><div> <tt>def foo(x)<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;y = "" # or 'y = String.new' or 'y = nil'<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;if x<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; y = "yes"<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;else<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; y = "no"<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;end<br>end</tt> </div></blockquote>In fact, you will get an error if you *don't* predeclare y in this case.
<p>
The reality, for me anyway, is that it just doesn't come up, because you just don't code this way in Ruby (i.e. procedurally / stand alone defs).  Your example would be refactored in Ruby as:</p><blockquote><div> <tt>def foo(x=nil)<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;y = 'no'<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;y = 'yes' if x<br>end</tt> </div></blockquote>I'm not trying to be contrite by using your example.  My point is that any example you can create that causes confusion with local vs global scope, I can refactor so that it doesn't.  At worst, I can just declare a global variable with '$' somewhere near the top of my code.
<p>
<i>I think this is what Larry means when he says that this kind of features look nice in short examples, but break down in larger code.</i>
</p><p>
Again, I think this comment comes as a result of years of procedural programming versus OO-style programming.  "Larger code", in Ruby (as in Java, C#, etc), would (or should) be a collection of classes, each with a collection of methods.  Since no one method is going to be very large, the global/scope issue *just doesn't happen*.
</p><p>
Maybe the end result of all this, as I write this response, is that using global scope as the default is right for languages geared towards procedural programming and wrong for languages geared towards OO.</p>

One of the things that I love about Perl is that I don't _have to_ do things strictly.  I must have missed the parts where Larry said that "use strict" is madatory.  Gosh, I thought that TMTOWTDI.<br> <br>*sigh*  and yes, it would be silly to have global scoping amongst objects, but don't they have their own namespaces to take care of that?<br> <br>I tell Perl what I want.  It does what I mean - I make sure of it.  Don't you?<br> <br>I use variables that have meaningful names (mostly) and they take care of themselves.  <br> <br>Check the URL at the top of my post here (www.cmdl.noaa.gov...).  It's generated by ~1000 lines of code and uses CGI.pm, libnet, and PGPLOT.pm to get the job done.  It's not OO, but doesn't need to be.  I seriously doubt that most programs _need_ to be object oriented.<br> <br>I'm not the sharpest Perl hacker, but I'm learning as I need to.  I vote for keeping global scoping as default.<br> <br>Thanks for your time.<br> <br>Hebrews 11:6b<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;^)

<h2>Focus of the /. comments</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/dapperdan/">dapperdan</a> on 2002-09-16T05:48:02</h3>
<p>It's too bad that the majority of the comments on slashdot focused on Larry's religious beliefs. As a religious software developer I respect Larry for answering the questions but it was sad to see the banter that was posted after his eloquent and gracious reply. I wish the discussion could have followed that path that this group appears to be following, commenting on upcoming developments and new developments in the language. </p>
<p>Am I the only one that sees the massively anti-perl sentiment on<nobr> <wbr></nobr>./? It seems to me that Perl is ripped to shreds each time a relevant article is posted by the trolls that tend to post on the message boards. I guess it goes back to the old bible saying that you shouldn't cast your perls before swine.</p>.
<p>I'd really like to see this site grow in content. So far it looks great.I'm happy I stumbled upon it!</p>

Well, I'm sure we're just a different type of swine.  Perhaps more regenerate, but who's to say, really?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:^)  <br> <br>I didn't have nearly enough time to read all the comments, but I did enjoy Larry's (yeah, "Larry" like he's a good buddy or something<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:^) answers.<br> <br>Check Hebrews 11:6b and see if you don't recognize Larry's two point summation of his theology.<br> <br>Perhaps it is just a matter of us being faithful by telling people about Perl and those who believe and diligently seek it will be rewarded...
