<h1>This Week on perl5-porters (16-22 September 2002)</h1>

</div> <!-- /span4 -->


<div class="span8">
<p>That's on a week like this that you realize that lots of porters are European (and managed to free themselves for YAPC::Europe.) Or were they,       on the contrary, too busy in the big blue room ? On the other hand, the         number of bug reports stayed at its habitual average level.</p>
<p><h2>Pedantic compilation</h2>
<p>Jarkko Hietaniemi provided a patch to add the -ansi -pedantic flags for
gcc on core C files. This triggered a bit of discussion, as those B&amp;D
flags will be useful for the porters only, but may cause trouble to casual
users who want to compile perl on less common platforms. Jarkko then
reworked his patch so -ansi -pedantic get enabled only if
<code>-Dgccansipedantic</code> is passed to Configure.</p>
<pre>
    <a href="http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2002-09/msg00720.html">http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/...</a> </pre>
<p>
<h2>Default install location</h2>
<p>Jarkko also proposed that the Configure symbol <code>installusrbinperl</code> should
be turned off by default. Currently, unless <code>-Uinstallusrbinperl</code> is
passed to Configure, (or if you're building a development version), a copy
of perl will be installed in<nobr> <wbr></nobr><code>/usr/bin/perl</code>, overwriting any previous
(and maybe vendor-supplied) version, and regardless the installation
prefix you passed to Configure.</p>
<p>Jarkko's idea was followed by a massive approval. He then offered a patch
that <em>defaults to not overwriting<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/usr/bin/perl if one exists, but it
will still default to creating one if one does not exist.</em> </p>

<p>
<h2>Closures in BEGIN blocks don't feel OK</h2>
<p>Rafael Garcia-Suarez proposed to the audience a coredump case<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:</p>
<pre>
    BEGIN { $f = sub { eval $_[0] } }
    $bar = &quot;ok\n&quot;;
    print $f-&gt;( '$bar' )<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;</pre>
<p>The cause of the coredump wasn't difficult to trace : the memory for the
BEGIN block has been free'd, and the closure still refers to the
non-existent lexical scope of the enclosing BEGIN block, where it looks
for $bar -- provoking a core dump.</p>
<p>The problem, still not solved, is to figure out what is the right thing
perl has to do in this case (and in some other similar cases, e.g. when
there's a lexical $bar in the BEGIN block.)</p>

<p>
<h2>perlopentut</h2>
<p>Andy Lester courageously began to work on the perlopentut manpage, that
wasn't actually up-to-date with the last improvements that were made on
the <code>open()</code> syntax. He produced three successive versions of a patch,
introducing to perlopentut the 3-arg form of <code>open()</code> and the indirect
(lexical) filehandles.</p>

<p>
<h2>Smoke effort</h2>
<p>Alain Barbet continued to produce huge smoke reports, adding new compilers
to his list (now with Borland on Windows). He also suggested to build a
web-accessible database of smoke builds. And not only suggested. He
actually provided a draft application containing his results. Thanks Alain !</p>

<h2>In brief</h2>
<p>H.Merijn Brand provided a patch to remove the support for <code>-DLEAKTEST</code>,
which was broken anyway (see previous week's summary).</p>
<p>John Peacock told us that he was in the process of releasing a v-string
module, <code>version.pm</code>, to CPAN. As he says, <em>the code is intended to be
basically 100% equivalent to the code which will be included in 5.10</em>, but
backported to perl 5.005_03 ! (or should it be v5.5.3 now ?)</p>
<p>Abhijit Menon-Sen, who was rare on the list these few last months, rapidly
fixed obscure bug #17375 (<code>$r<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.= &lt;FH&gt;</code> not working properly when $r
has been undefined.)</p>
<p>The person who reported bug #17422 -- the RT system didn't gave his name
-- reported that the GLOB_NOCASE flag of File::Glob doesn't appear to have
any effect when one wants to glob a wildcard pattern that doesn't contain a
wildcard character. Rafael Garcia-Suarez suggested that this might be the
desired behavior. No further comments were made.</p>
<p>Another memory leak problem with shared arrays has been reported (bug
#17460). In fact this problem is already known and will be hopefully fixed
by an upcoming release of the threads::* modules on CPAN.</p>
<p>H.Merijn Brand is now officially the Configure pumpking (and that's a
scary task). The new mailing list <em>perl5-build</em> (at the usual domain)
will be dedicated to discussions about Configure and metaconfig (the tool
used to generate the Configure script).</p>
<p>
<h2>About this summary</h2>
<p>This summary brought to you by Rafael Garcia-Suarez, from Lyon, France, a
city that's not that close to Munich. It's also available via a mailing
list, which subscription address is <em> <a href="mailto:perl5-summary-subscribe@perl.org">perl5-summary-subscribe@perl.org</a><nobr> <wbr></nobr></em>.</p></p>

<h2>5.005_03 in vstring notation</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/pne/">pne</a> on 2002-09-27T14:26:46</h3>
<blockquote><div> <p> <i>perl 5.005_03 ! (or should it be v5.5.3 now ?)</i> </p> </div></blockquote>

<p>No, it shouldn't: it should be v5.5.30. v5.5.3 would be 5.005_003 in the old style. (Which is why 5.005_56 became 5.5.560 when v-strings were first introduced; at least, I <em>think</em> that was where the changeover was.)</p>
