Over the last month or so, I've been making strenuous efforts to contact all of the groups we had listed to see which ones were still active. What you see is the result of this exercise. Almost half of the groups have been removed because they haven't responded to my emails.
</i><p><i>If your local group still exists but is no longer listed, then that means that I don't have an update to date contact for your group. Please <a href="mailto:user_groups@pm.org">let me know</a> if that's the case."</i></p></p>

<h2>NY.pm outlasts Boston.pm</h2>

Those Red Sox fans weren't real Perl hackers anyway. Some guy who thinks he knows every thing about slashcode and hides behind some ball player's name was never a match for the Ruthless, Godless Dictator David H. Adler, Perl Monger #2.  I'm pretty sure the Brits were out to get Boston.pm for that tea thing, too.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br> <br>

Yeah, wtf?! Boston.pm is even listed on lists.perl.org

<h3><a href="/user/hfb/">hfb</a> on 2002-09-24T03:10:01</h3>
<p>well, that info is outdated since the lists were moved but, yes, as far as I know, Boston.pm still meets once a month at boston.com. Someone better prod Ron<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) </p>

<h2>Congratulations!</h2>

Nice to see the census^Wsurvey idea we discussed at TPC6 put at work.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)
<p>
However, Japan groups are not listed at the <a href="http://www.pm.org/groups/asia.html" title="pm.org">'Asia' section</a pm.org>, which is probably wrong.
</p><p>
Thanks again for the wonderful work as the Chief Perl Monger!</p>

<p>That would appear to be because I have had no responses from any of the Japanese groups. If you have any contect with them, then you might like to prod them.</p>

<h2>Sending corrections</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/davorg/">davorg</a> on 2002-09-24T09:22:01</h3>
<p>Please note that I prefer updates via email to <a href="mailto:user_groups@pm.org" title="mailto">user_groups@pm.org</a mailto>. It's also better for me if updates come from the group leader.</p>
<p>Until I get most of the problems fixed, the list on the web site will be rebuilt once a day (during the evening UK time).</p>



<h2>Norwich?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Odud/">Odud</a> on 2002-09-24T13:35:23</h3>
Why is it in Great Britain when everywhere else is in the United Kingdom - should we be told? - should they be told?

<h2>Re:Norwich?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/davorg/">davorg</a> on 2002-09-24T14:53:14</h3>
<p>I've wondered that ever since they appeared on the list. I never found the solution but I <i>have</i> now moved them back to their rightful place in the UK (the feeling of power!)</p>

<h2>What emails?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/chipmunk/">chipmunk</a> on 2002-09-24T14:00:39</h3>
I have not received any emails from davorg in the last month about Perl Mongers.  I doubt that davorg really exists.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br> <br>Actually, I did receive the following email, in early August, on the groups list:<br> <br>---<br> <br>As you may have read on &lt;http://use.perl.org/&gt; or<br>&lt;http://www.perl-foundation.org/&gt;. I've recently taken over as Perl<br>Mongers user groups co-ordinator.<br>
&nbsp; <br>The first task I've set myself is to find out just what groups exist.<br>
&nbsp; <br>This list is supposed to have all local group leaders on it. If you<br>recieve this email and you're not a Perl Monger local group leader then<br>can you please let me know who has taken over leadership of the group.<br>
&nbsp; <br>If the group is currently sleeping, then please let me know that as well<br>so I can mark it as such in the Perl Monger groups list.<br>
&nbsp; <br>Replies to me please, not to the list.<br>
&nbsp; <br>And if you have any further questions about Perl Mongers and its future<br>then please get in touch with me.<br> <br>---<br> <br>Since I <i>am</i> a local Perl Monger group leader, and my group is not currently sleeping, and I had no further questions about Perl Mongers or its future, I did not respond.<br> <br>Rest assured that Boston Perl Mongers is alive and well.  We had a technical meeting just last week.<br> <br>chipmunk<br>

<p>Oops. That <i>was</i> rather loosely worded wasn't it. I must be more careful in future.</p>
<p>Boston.pm have been restored to their rightful place (or rather, they will be the next time Leon rebuilts the web site).</p><p><p>Sorry for any unintentional slight to the Bostonians - it had nothing to do with the tea.</p>

Yeah. Sure it doesn't. <i>Sure</i> it was a mistake...<p>Just be sure to watch your English backs while making any plans <a href="http://london.pm.org/pipermail/london.pm" title="pm.org">against continental Europe</a pm.org>. Wouldn't want anything bad to happen while the ruffians are distracted, eh? </p><p>:-)</p>

...and only now, a day later, do I realize that I linked to the general London.pm archives, rather than this thread: <a href="http://penderel.state51.co.uk/pipermail/london.pm/Week-of-Mon-20020923/013790.html" title="state51.co.uk">Time to declare war on Paris.pm</a state51.co.uk>. But then the whole list could be interpreted as a declaration of war of sorts, so I guess it works out anyway...<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

I reacted just the same way as chipmunk.<br>Yes, Tokyo.pm is active.<br>I'll send the info about Tokyo.pm to <br>user_groups @ pm . org in a separate mail.<br> <br>Anyway, I appreciate your work, davorg.
