<h1>This Week on perl5-porters (2-8 September 2002)</h1>

<div class="span8">
<p>As September begins, the perl5-porters, ignoring the changing weather,
continue to work. This week, some small things, and a few bigger ones,
are selected in the report. Read below.</p>
<p><h2>Precision on CLONEs</h2>
<p>Elizabeth Mattijsen found that, while executing a CLONE method (the hook
to support cloning of data when new threads are created), <code>threads-&gt;tid</code>
returns the thread id of the original thread. This is because the cloning
is actually performed (at the C level) in the parent thread.</p>
<p>However, to execute some routine when a new thread starts, and from this
new thread, a workaround is to hijack <code>threads::new</code>. Nick Ing-Simmons
also suggested to implement some sort of post-clone handler via another
special subroutine (for example CLONED).</p>
<p>
<h2>A point on v-strings</h2>
<p>John Peacock, the man who courageously continues to struggle with
v-strings, posted a <em>restatement of current objections to version
objects</em> -- version objects being what the v-strings should be compiled to
internally by perl, in order to make them less unusable.</p>
<p>The thread is worth a read if you are annoyed by v-strings and if you want
to have some idea on how they're likely to change.</p>
<pre>
    <a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=3D73752A.701%40rowman.com">http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=...</a> </pre>
<p>To quote Hugo, <em>Larry continues to like them</em> [the v-strings] <em>despite
various attempts to convince him otherwise, so they are here to stay. I
think they could become much less of a bugbear if John's sterling work
culminates in a consistent and appropriately documented set of
behaviours.</em> Waiting for the v-string objects Apocalypse...</p>
<p>
<h2>Pseudo-hashes should warn before they die</h2>
<p>Now that pseudo-hashes are removed from bleadperl, Gurusamy Sarathy
noticed that using them doesn't trigger any deprecation warning in perl
5.8.0. Jarkko is considering adding one in perl 5.8.1.</p>
<p>Benjamin Goldberg also started a thread on the implementation-to-be
of the <code>fields</code> pragma in perl 5.10.</p>

<p>
<h2>Jaguar and Camel</h2>
<p>Jarkko Hietaniemi found out that Perl 5.8.0 doesn't compile on Mac OS X
10.2 with the August update of the Developers Tools, due to a small
communication problem between the Configure script and Apple's modified
gcc 3. He also provided a fix for that, which you can grab here if you
need it<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:</p>

<p> <em>Last minute update</em> : has Jarkko dreamed ? have the sunspots moved ?
He's apparently no longer able to reproduce this bug.</p>
<p>
<h2>In brief</h2>
<p>Abe Timmerman is now the official maintainer of Test::Smoke.
See <em> <a href="http://qa.perl.org/">http://qa.perl.org/</a> </em> for more info about smoke testing.</p>
<p>Steve Piner reported an (already known, IIRC) bug : <code>my $x; our $x;</code>
doesn't generate a warning, whereas <code>our $x; my $x;</code> does. (Bug #16922.)</p>
<p>H.Merijn Brand, doing some speed experiments, <em>found that perlio has
slowed down considerably compared to stdio from 17805 to 17821</em>. No
confirmation or comment was issued.</p>
<p>Allen Smith provided some patches to bleadperl and to perl 5.8.0 to
improve IRIX support, namely on long doubles, and their handling by
<code>s?printf()</code>.</p>
<p>The perl5-changes mailing list now carries the changes committed by Hugo,
and all previously dropped changes have been sent back to it, for the
purpose of archiving.</p>
<p>Sadahiro Tomoyuki released a new version (0.23) of Unicode::Collate.</p>
<p>Elizabeth Mattijsen, after having uploaded a first version of
<code>Thread::Exit</code> on CPAN, found that <code>POSIX::_exit()</code> makes perl hang on
Linux when called from within a thread (bug #17057). This problem is
probably related to the Linux implementation of threads.</p>
<p>Elizabeth emitted the idea to start a new FAQ section on
threads.</p>
<p>Hugo is leaving for Zurich (the Perl 6 mini-conference) and to Munich
(YAPC::Europe).</p>

Jarkko pointed out a mistake (thanks!). He <a href="http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2002-09/msg00411.html" title="mpe.mpg.de">was
referring</a mpe.mpg.de> to another bug. Compilation of 5.8.0 on Jaguar
with the August Developers Tools is reproducibly broken. Grab the patch if you need to.

&gt; reproducibly broken

<p>
If I may point out a bit more...<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)  I wouldn't call the build "broken", just "noisy".  It builds and tests fine (modulo the "standard" Berkeley DB failures).
</p>

<p>
It's just that because the Configure as it was before my patch and the new gcc setup of Apple don't communicate that well, one gets a noisy (two-line) warning about -I/usr/local/include for each and every compiled C file.  With the patch, one doesn't.

OK, next time I won't start the weekly summary on sunday evening -- at least not <i>too late</i> on sunday evening.

<p>Interesting. I found this problem on Jaguar with 5.8.0 and the original 10.2 build tools, not just the latest ones. It only happened when I actually <i>had</i> a<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/usr/local/include directory. I was going to post a bug, but never got round to it. Thanks, Jarkko!</p>
