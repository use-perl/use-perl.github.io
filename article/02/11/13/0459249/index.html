<p>Mac::Carbon is a Carbon/Mac OS X port of the Mac:: modules included with MacPerl.  It's in development, but a lot of it works, and it is available, on the CPAN (soon) and on <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=7940&amp;release_id=122065">SourceForge.net</a> (now).  To discuss Mac::Carbon, check out the <a href="http://lists.perl.org/showlist.cgi?name=macosx">macosx@perl</a> mailing list.</p>
<p><pre>NAME
    README - Carbon API for perl on Mac OS X<br/><br/>SYNOPSIS
    This is not release-quality software. It is still in development, and
    not recommend for use in a production environment.<br/><br/>    Mac::Carbon is a collection of perl modules for accessing the Carbon API
    under Mac OS X. It is a port of the Toolbox modules written by Matthias
    Neeracher for MacPerl.<br/><br/>    Part of the current strategy is to make Mac::Carbon the intersection of
    the old and new Mac OS APIs. We will not be adding new functionality
    from Carbon, except as needed, for now. This may change over time as
    Mac::Carbon stabilizes.<br/><br/>    See the documentation in the Mac::Carbon manpage for more implementation
    details, bugs, etc.<br/><br/>HELP ME
    There are probably a lot of bugs, especially in Carbon.h. Bugs are
    listed in the section on "Known Bugs" in the Mac::Carbon manpage; please
    feel free to report them on the MacPerl bug reporting page, in the "Mac
    Toolbox" category. Patches are welcome, too, of course. For large
    patches, such as stuff for test suites and building, please do
    coordinate with me before spending much time on it.<br/><br/>            <a href="http://sf.net/projects/macperl/">http://sf.net/projects/macperl/</a><br/><br/>REQUIREMENTS
  Mac OS<br/><br/>    These modules all build under Mac OS, but it is recommended you build
    them as a part of MacPerl itself, or at least under the MacPerl source.
    See <a href="http://dev.macperl.org/">http://dev.macperl.org/</a> for more information.<br/><br/>    Under Mac OS, the full Mac OS API is available, not just the
    Carbon-compatible routines.<br/><br/>  Mac OS X<br/><br/>    To build these modules on Mac OS X, the Developer Tools are required.<br/><br/>    The Test::More module is required for running tests.<br/><br/>    The separate Mac::Errors module is not required, but is highly
    recommended.<br/><br/>    These modules have only been tested with perl 5.6.0 on Mac OS X. See the
    note in the BUILDING manpage.<br/><br/>    The modules will compile and test remotely (such as via ssh, instead of
    via the Terminal), but some of the tests might not run properly, and one
    of the tests (for Mac::Notification) wants user feedback (though will
    work without it).<br/><br/>BUILDING
    Matthias added some extensions to XS for his Toolbox modules; they were
    never fully embraced by p5p, and as a result, we have a separate xsubpp
    for these additional XS macros. There is currently no resolution to this
    problem. Either we write a pre-preprocessor that converts the<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.xs files
    to be able to be handled by perl's xsubpp, or we modify the<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.xs so that
    it can be handled by perl's xsubpp, or we distribute a separate xsubpp
    (which is dangerous, as xsubpp changes with versions of perl).<br/><br/>    Currently, Mac::Carbon is distributed with the already-processed<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.c
    files. If you really want to compile with the<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.xs files, you can use the
    xsubpp programs (either the 5.6 or 5.8 versions) included in the
    distribution. This is only temporary, until we have a permanent
    resolution to these issues.<br/><br/>    You might want to run the test suite with `make test TEST_VERBOSE=1'.
    It's cool.<br/><br/>SUPPORTED MODULES
    Currently, only a subset of the modules are supported. The ported
    modules are:<br/><br/>            Mac::Components
            Mac::Files
            Mac::Gestalt
            Mac::Memory
            Mac::MoreFiles
            Mac::Notification
            Mac::Processes
            Mac::Resources
            Mac::Sound
            Mac::Speech
            Mac::Types<br/><br/>    Coming next, hopefully:<br/><br/>            Mac::AppleEvents
            Mac::OSA<br/><br/>    Mac::AppleEvents is going to take more work than the others, as it
    involves some significant API changes.<br/><br/>    Following those, the pure-perl modules, which should not take much work,
    as long as the core XS modules they rely on are working:<br/><br/>            Mac::AppleEvents::Simple
            Mac::OSA::Simple
            Mac::Glue<br/><br/>    And, possibly:<br/><br/>            Mac::InternetConfig
            Mac::SpeechRecognition<br/><br/>    There are currently no plans for the other (GUI) modules, including:<br/><br/>            Mac::Controls
            Mac::Dialogs
            Mac::Events
            Mac::Fonts
            Mac::Lists
            Mac::Menus
            Mac::Movies
            Mac::Navigation
            Mac::QDOffScreen
            Mac::QuickDraw
            Mac::QuickTimeVR
            Mac::TextEdit
            Mac::Windows<br/><br/>    We could do these eventually, if there is enough interest. They don't
    port as easily as some of the others, for many reasons, not the least of
    which is that we need a framework to handle events etc., which for
    MacPerl is mostly implemented in macish.c / macish.h.<br/><br/>AUTHOR
    The Mac Toolbox modules were written by Matthias Neeracher.
    They are currently maintained by Chris Nandor.<br/><br/>VERSION
