...but at least we know the offical colour.  "Pink", if memory serves.

From Googlism: "toulouse is a charming city known as the ville rose" (aka the Pink City).<br> <br>Congrats to BooK and the rest of Paris.pm! I'll see you there.<br>

<p>Mmm, the official <i>staff</i> shirts will
be in some shade of pink, yes. It's all my
fault, I know.</p>
<p>But wait until you see the official website!<nobr> <wbr></nobr><tt>;-)</tt> </p>

Orange?  Or are you finally freeing yourself from the tyranny of that colour now that acme has managed to taint the entire of the <a href="http://london.pm.org/" title="pm.org">london.pm</a pm.org> site with it.

Tyranny? I think the site looks much better in orange. As everyone knows, orange is the One True YAPC::Europe Colour...

Orange is also <a href="http://www.tamsin.com/why/" title="tamsin.com">the new black</a tamsin.com>. Which is probably why <a href="http://www.tamsin.com/" title="tamsin.com">her site</a tamsin.com> has "added orangey bits".



<h2>Re:Very few details there may be...</h2>

Orange is a perky and positive colour.  More things should be orange.
<br>
Hmmm, if it's the colour of YAPC::Europe I may just have to go<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...

(Yes,  I wondered why use.perl.org was turning up in my referrer logs)<br> <br>

<h2>This may be premature, but...</h2>

I suppose offering suggestions on how the conference should be organised in perhaps a bit premature at this stage. However, I think it is important.<p>
At YAPC::Europe 2001, there were public-access computers available. This was great for people like me who hadn't got a laptop. At YAPC::Europe 2002, sadly, there were no public access computers. Wireless and cabled Ethernet was provided, but that still leaves people without laptops in trouble. It would be great if the YAPC::Europe 2003 team could organise public computers.</p><p>
As an aside, I did raise this point with the YAPC::Europe 2002 organisers. Apparently they had planned to offer public computers, but for some last-minute reason they couldn't. As the YAPC recommends that YAPC organisers should contact previous organisers, for advice, I hope my concerns will be addressed<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>

YAPC::Europe 2000 (the first one ever) also had public-access computers, FWIW.

<h2>Dinner location?</h2>

If it's at the Cleopatra, I'll attend.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
