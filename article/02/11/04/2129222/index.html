<h1>This Week on perl5-porters (28th October / 3rd November 2002)</h1>

<div class="span8">
<p>This week's summary features UTF8 and locale incompatibility problems,
discovered on RedHat 8, but pertaining to UTF8 locales ; various bugs fixed ;
various bugs discovered ; the<nobr> <wbr></nobr><code>//</code> operator reappearing shortly ; and a
new way to consider goto harmful.</p>
<p><h2>Problems with RedHat 8</h2>
<p>Paul Marquess reported that the test suite for Compress::Zlib fails on the
newest RedHat 8.0. <a href="http://archive.develooper.com/perl5-porters@perl.org/msg88580.html">This
problem</a> is due to a string holding binary data
which, once written to a file, gets apparently corrupted.</p>
<p>Gurusamy Sarathy pointed out that marking the output filehandle with
<code>binmode()</code> solves the problem. In fact, RedHat 8's default configuration
apparently use UTF-8 locales, which are recognized by perl 5.8.0. Gurusamy
quoted the <a href="http://www.perldoc.com/perl5.8.0/pod/perldelta.html#PerlIO-is-Now-The-Default">appropriate
paragraph</a> from the perldelta manpage for perl 5.8.0<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:</p>
<blockquote><div>
Note for code authors: if you want to enable your users to use UTF-8 as
their default encoding but in your code still have eight-bit I/O streams
(such as images or zip files), you need to explicitly <code>open()</code> or <code>binmode()</code>
with<nobr> <wbr></nobr><code>:bytes</code> (see perlfunc/open and perlfunc/binmode), or you can just
use <code>binmode(FH)</code> (nice for pre-5.8.0 backward compatibility).
</div></blockquote>
<p>Tom Horsley added that there are probably additional bugs in RedHat 8.0
Unicode handling, judging from mysterious coredumps from system libraries.</p>
<p>Finally, Jarkko Hietaniemi proposed a patch to fix UTF-8 enabling via
locales. The LANGUAGE environment variable should not be used (as it is in
5.8.0) to enable UTF-8.</p>
<p>
<h2>AUTOLOAD subroutines from undefined stashes</h2>
<p>Jan Dubois reported a <a href="http://archive.develooper.com/perl5-porters@perl.org/msg88519.html">bug
on AUTOLOADed subroutines</a> (bug #18113, also
reported previously as #17967) : AUTOLOAD is not called on packages that
haven't been encountered by perl before. This used to work with perl
5.6.1, but is broken with perl 5.8.0. Gurusamy Sarathy provided a fix.</p>
<p>
<h2>goto considered harmful in __DIE__ handlers</h2>
<p>Peter Scott reported an <a href="http://archive.develooper.com/perl5-porters@perl.org/msg88578.html">interesting
behavior</a> : when using a magical
<code>goto</code> to exit from a __DIE__ handler, one could generate an infinite
loop<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:</p>
<pre>
    $SIG{__DIE__} = sub { goto &amp;foo };
    sub foo { print &quot;foo\n&quot;; die &quot;rethrow&quot; }
    die &quot;throw&quot;;</pre>
<p>Whether it's actually a bug is open to discussion.</p>
<p>
<h2>B::* adjustments</h2>
<p>Yitzchak Scott-Thoennes remarked that <a href="http://archive.develooper.com/perl5-porters@perl.org/msg88595.html">B::Concise doesn't handle</a> well the
new<nobr> <wbr></nobr><code>//</code> and<nobr> <wbr></nobr><code>//=</code> operators (bug #18175). Stephen McCamant sent a fix,
but a similar problem on other B:: modules (at least B::Terse) should be
fixed as well.</p>
<p>
<h2>Tied hashes in boolean context</h2>
<p> <a href="http://archive.develooper.com/perl5-porters@perl.org/msg88626.html">Bug
#18186</a> was already reported as #17718 : one can't test the emptyness
of a tied hash by using it in scalar context. Yitzchak points out that
it's difficult to fix, and explains why. Mark-Jason Dominus proposed an
alternative solution (a HASHSIZE method), which was already suggested a
while back by Rick Delaney, and rejected at this time.</p>
<p>
<h2>In brief</h2>
<p>Autrijus Tang reported that uc(), <code>lc()</code> and <code>ucfirst()</code> don't appear to work
correctly on the right side of <code>s///e</code> expressions, applied on UTF-8
strings. Strangely, this bug (#18107) doesn't affect lcfirst().</p>
<p>Mark Pease found a problem on offset calculations in regular expressions
(bug #18154) and offered a patch.</p>
<p>Nicholas Clark proposed to replace the current implementation of the
makefile target <code>regen_headers</code> by a perl script, which he provided.</p>
<p>Rafael Garcia-Suarez asked why DESTROY is called in scalar context (and
proposed a patch to have it called in void context), and faced Warnock's
dilemma.</p>
<p>Abhijit Menon-Sen and Slaven Rezic fixed a problem with the<nobr> <wbr></nobr><code>..</code>
operator, that didn't handle well some cases where the operands were
strings (<code>&quot;-4&quot;..&quot;0&quot;</code> and <code>&quot;-4\n&quot;..&quot;0\n&quot;</code>). (bugs #18114 and #18165.)</p>
