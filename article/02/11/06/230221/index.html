Perhaps the single most important URL for OSCON 2003--the one for <a href="http://www.powells.com/" title="powells.com">Powell's Books</a powells.com>. Bring money, and lots of it. A spare suitcase can't hurt either...

Another great reason to visit Portland is the *great* beer available in the Pacific Northwest. Even Europeans should be impressed by the selection and quality. Also, if you are a fan of *ahem* "folk dancing", Portland happens to be THE capital in the United States. Adults only.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)

Thank god their stacks are color coded in the actual building.  I don't know how many times I've (happily) gotten lost there.

<h2>Early warning</h2>

That's what I call early warning; it's not in the web page yet (at least in conferences.oreilly.com)



<blockquote>

<h2>Re:Early warning</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/gnat/">gnat</a> on 2002-11-07T15:28:33</h3>
I posted it as soon as I had the dates.  Independent guerilla publishing!  Weblogs!  Rah rah!  BigCos!  [insert Dave Winer blather here]<p>

<h2>Nuts</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Matts/">Matts</a> on 2002-11-07T08:01:14</h3>
Rotten timing. The Perl Conference was always great because it fell during school holidays so I could bring my wife. That's before schools break up in the UK, so this year I'll either not be coming, or coming alone.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-(



<blockquote>

<h2>Re:Nuts</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/gnat/">gnat</a> on 2002-11-07T15:35:05</h3>
Bummer!  We were constrained by dates available at the hotel.  If it's any consolation, it would have been much worse if we stayed in San Diego.<p>

<p>Dates are good for me.  All kinds of things may happen by then, but hopefully I'll see you there!</p>

<p>The pacific northwest is nice.  I've never been to OSCON, but <i>I'm</i> tired of it being there just from hearing everyone whine.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<p>Must get a wireless card before then...</p>

<h2>Go East</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/htoug/">htoug</a> on 2002-11-07T10:50:56</h3>
Still on the far far away west coast.<br>OK after 6 years you do leave California, so at this rate we'll be in Siberia at the turn of the century<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)<br> <br>Well: YAPC::EU 2003 <b>will</b> be much more fun and will have much better talks - won't it?<br>



<blockquote>

<h2>Re:Go East</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/gnat/">gnat</a> on 2002-11-07T15:45:20</h3>
Hey, that first step is the hardest.  As evidenced by the fact that it took six years AND A BLOODY RECESSION to make it happen<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)  That said, I don't think we'll see an east coast conference until we can consistently produce successful conferences on the west coast.  The fear is that moving away from our established customer base (a large percentage of OSCON attendees are from California) will leave us with insufficient attendees to meet higher costs (venue costs at east coast tech centres are higher than the west coast).<p>

Either way, YAPC and YAPC::EU will be fun and well worth attending.  I fantasize that O'Reilly will send me to Europe in '03<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...</p><p>

<h2>Excellent</h2>

Sometimes I feel I'm the only high-tech guy who's never been to Portland, so this should be fun.<br> <br>I was getting a little tired of CA.<br>

<h2>Damn....</h2>

Well, Guess all good things must come to an end. I live 20 minutes from the hotel here in San Diego where OSCON has been held. I loved attending, but won't make that kind of trek...



<h2>Stonehenge parties</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/merlyn/">merlyn</a> on 2002-11-07T18:26:14</h3>
If you thought the Stonehenge parties were cool in California...
<p>
Just wait 'til you see what we pull off in our home city!</p>

<h2>Re:Stonehenge parties</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/mako132/">mako132</a> on 2002-11-08T17:28:50</h3>
Wow, does this mean it will be held at the Schwartz mansion?  Can we bring out swimsuits?



<h2>Re:Stonehenge parties</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/triv/">triv</a> on 2002-11-10T12:53:23</h3>
Don't make me send Casey after you to remind you that it wasn't just a stonehedge party!<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)



<blockquote>

<h2>Re:Stonehenge parties</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/merlyn/">merlyn</a> on 2002-11-11T14:25:32</h3>
It was never a "stonehedge" party.
<p>
And while the party at TPC6 was a joint venture, the other California parties at TPC5 and TPC4 were bigger (in some ways), and I don't recall Casey kicking in any dough for those.
</p><p>
So, please to not be so fast on that trigger.</p>

The scuttlebutt I've heard is that tech conferences in Chicago don't get high attendance--it gets neither the California nor the Eastern Corridor convenience traffic.<p>

Hmm, I would think it would be easy to fly into
O'Hare Airport, from anywhere.  Oh well, I'll
keep suggesting Chicago<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br/><br/>

Easy but annoying.  That airport's unlucky, I tell you!
</p>



<h2>through</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jmm/">jmm</a> on 2002-11-08T18:40:54</h3>
It's easy to (have to) fly through O'Hare, if you want to go somewhere else.

<h2>Hot Damn!</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Ovid/">Ovid</a> on 2002-11-07T23:12:45</h3>
<p>I'll finally attend a Perl conference and I won't even have to pay for a hotel room.  I'm a happy man.  I guess I had better put in my vacation request now before the hordes (2) of other Perl programmers here see this.</p>



<h2>Great City</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/dug/">dug</a> on 2002-11-08T14:03:00</h3>
I'm flying out to the Gorge this weekend to (fingers crossed) close a deal on a
house right outside of Carson, WA.  Natural hot springs in walking distance, 35
minute drive into Portland, 3 minute walk to one of the best windsurfing launch
points in the world, 50 minute drive to my favorite ski slope...  Did I mention
I have my fingers crossed?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:^)
<br>
<br>
I *love* Portland.  Urban but laid back, great coffee, great beer.  The most
beautiful hike I've ever been on is Eagle Creek.  It's about a 15 minute drive
east of Portland at the Bonneville Fish Hatchery exit.  If you're going to be
hanging out post conference I highly recommend a quick day trip.  Even a
quick hike a couple miles up the trail head is well worth the time.
<br>
<br>
I look forward to meeting some of you.
