<p><a href="mailto:jhi@iki.fi">jhi</a> writes <i>"It seems that there is a lot of interest in having similar archives
for other languages like <a href="http://www.cpan.org/">CPAN</a> [1] is
for Perl.  I should know; over the years people from at least Python,
Ruby, and Java communities have approached me or other core CPAN
people to ask basically 'How did we do it?'.  Very recently I've seen
even more interest from some people in the Perl community wanting to
actively reach out a helping hand to other communities.  This
'missive' tries to describe my thinking and help people wanting to
build their own CANs.  Since I hope this message will somehow end up
reaching the other language communities I will explicitly include URLs
that are (hopefully) obvious to Perl people."</i></p>
<p>      [1] <a href="http://www.cpan.org/">http://www.cpan.org/</a>

<p>
I'll start negatively and end with hopefully more constructive notes,
however these will build on the denials.
</p>

<p>
In the following Mumble and mumble stand for any other language than
Perl or a combination of languages other than Perl.
</p>

<p>
First, the negative statements.
</p>

<ol>
<li>CPAN shall not 'piggyback' other languages.
    (There shall not be a mumble/ top level directory.)
<ul>
<li>Rationale: CPAN is CPAN is CPAN.  CPAN carries Perl.
    This implies all kinds of different contracts, explicit
    and implicit.
</li>
<li>Some people in the Mumble community will take offense to CPAN
    carrying Mumble.
</li>
<li>Some people in the Perl community will take offense to CPAN
    carrying Mumble.
</li>
<li>Some CPAN mirrors will take offense to suddenly having to carry
    also Mumble.
</li>
<li>Some CPAN mirrors will become resource (bandwidth, disk) constrained
    after having to suddenly carry also Mumble.
</li>
</ul></li>
<li>CPAN cannot 'piggyback' other languages.
<ul>
<li>The building blocks or 'plumbing' of CPAN (the basic directory
    structure, the PAUSE) is a reasonably good match for Perl.
    I'm not so certain that it is for all the other languages.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Now, on to the hopefully more constructive suggestions.
</p>

<p>
First and foremost-- I'm not against other language communities
having a CPAN.  I would love to have such archives.  I'm willing
to help the other language communities.  I'm only against too
straightforward "let's just slap it on to the CPAN" solutions to
the problem.  Other languages are not like Perl, they are different,
to a smaller or larger degree.  Let's allow them their own degree of
dignity and careful thought.
</p>

<p>
Then on to the technical questions, a.k.a. "How did you do it?"  Well,
people always ask that from me and I go speechless... "Errrr, ummm, I
kind of pulled all this stuff together and organized it a bit, and put
it on a ftp server".  After this a brooding silence always falls...
"And...?"<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... "And what?"<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... "That's it?"  "That's it."
</p>

<p>
Well, that's not really it, of course.  The above is how CPAN
started.  How it grew is another story.  First, Larry designed
Perl to grow by letting it have modules (in other words, namespaces).
Then we had a couple of wise men (like Tim Bunce) to have the vision
of good module naming guidelines.  Finally, we had Andreas K&ouml;nig
who single-handedly wrote <a href="http://pause.perl.org/">PAUSE</a> [2],
the module submission machinery,
where Perl module authors can register, submit, and manage their
submissions.  This allowed for a rapid but still controlled growth
of modules.  Because of the growth, it finally became too arduous
to know what was out there, and luckily Graham Barr's scratch to
this itch become large enough to be published as
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/">search.cpan.org</a> [3].
Later <a href="http://history.perl.org/backpan/">backPAN</a> [4]
was added by Andreas to hold all the old versions
of submissions deleted by their authors; this ties back into simple
basic things that the master server(s) must have, like good backups.
Last but not least, feedback for the modules can given through
the <a href="http://rt.cpan.org/">RT ticketing system</a>
set up be Jesse Vincent.
</p>

        [2] <a href="http://pause.cpan.org/">http://pause.cpan.org/</a> (or <a href="https://pause.cpan.org/">https://pause.cpan.org/</a>)
        [3] <a href="http://search.cpan.org/">http://search.cpan.org/</a>
        [4] <a href="http://history.perl.org/backpan/">http://history.perl.org/backpan/</a>
        [5] <a href="http://rt.cpan.org/">http://rt.cpan.org/</a>

<p>
<a href="http://mirrors.cpan.org/">CPAN mirrors</a> [6],
then?  How did they come about?  The original ones,
dozen or so, were easy: I just asked the maintainers of the original
ftp sites I had found the seeds of CPAN from whether they might be
interested in carrying this slightly bigger amalgamated Perl archive.
Well, they foolishly agreed...  I have to remind people once again
that CPAN was conceived as a FTP archive.  Not a website.  And it
still is that way.  search.cpan.org just gives a nice interface.  I'm
sorry but I'm a dry CS engineer, not a graphic designer.  Information,
not animation.
</p>

        [6] <a href="http://mirrors.cpan.org/">http://mirrors.cpan.org/</a>

<p>
Oh, back to the CPAN mirrors.  After the original ones, we grew slowly
for a while, by word of mouth in the Perl community.  However, since
this was the time before the billions dollars worth fiber dug into the
ground, Internet connections were still a bit dodgy and spotty.
Therefore I started doing two things: scanning ftp logs for sites that
obviously were mirroring CPAN but were not registered mirrors, and
sites that were good representatives for their particular top level
domain, especially outside the big seven TLD.  This way I could track
down where Perl was used and by asking those sites to participate to
push back the load from the master site.  Later I also filled in
missing countries by going for sites like the sunsites, and other
vendor/public funded sites that had a good chance of having good
connectivity.  Usually I could find a sympathetic soul, oftentimes a
system administrator.
</p>

<p>
Summary of the mirror tirade: I went for sites that liked and/or
used Perl.  I have no way of knowing off-hand whether they would
like Mumble.  The mirrors are donating their network and storage
capacity and some amount of their administrative time for the
Perl community.  If we would like to extend that in any way
we would have to ask them, from all of them individually.
</p>

<p>
You can learn more about CPAN's history from the <a href="http://history.perl.org/PerlTimeline.html">Perl timeline</a> [7].
Things didn't happen overnight.

<p>
A quite important thing for both the authors and the users is that the
language must get the naming scheme of its modules right, or at least
reasonably close.  Perl's/CPAN's is far from perfect, but at least it
was once designed, and it has been enhanced over the years as new
needs have appeared.  A good naming scheme allows hierarchical
browsing, gives good hints for search engines (a good name is
effectively a string of uniquely identifying keywords), and
coordinates community efforts.  Some sort of conflict resolution
mechanism in case of competing and identically named implementations
is important.  Keeping all those guidelines well documented and all
these processes public is important.
One naming issue I think Perl 5 got wrong is that module
namespaces are first-come-first-served, two or more different
authors cannot have an identically named module.  This may lead
into unintentional or intentional squatting, which is not good
for the community.
</p>

<p>
When designing your author/module/whatever hierarchy think
scalability.  We originally got it wrong by having all authors as
subdirectories in one single directory which quickly became a
bottleneck. (The solution to this was simply to 'hash' based on the
leading two characters of the user ids.)  Think also several different
views to your data: by author, by module, by category, by date, by
keywords, and so forth.  Don't think only hierarchical views will
be enough: you will need searching capabilities.
</p>

<p>
Get your license policy clear from the day one.  No, day minus one.
In this day and age it is very important that every piece of software
gets clearly marked as to what license it carries.  Build your module
packaging tools so that they suggest, maybe even demand that the
author picks a license.  This way both the users of modules and
distributors of software wanting to include the module don't have
to keep guessing.
</p>

<p>
Very much related to the licensing is of course commercial use:
CPAN took the easy and clear policy of no commercial software
of any kind, not even share/guilt/donateware would be allowed.
We felt that any other policy would be open to nitpicking, or
maybe even legal challenges, and as a volunteer ragtag group
we had no time or other resources for any of such.
</p>

<p>
Security?  Should you have PGP keys and triply-written-in-blood
signatures?  Maybe.  Currently CPAN has only MD5 checksums-- but
so far they have been enough.  There are some ongoing projects that
enable using PGP keys for verifying the origin of the software; but
as always with PKI systems, bootstrapping the web of trust is hard,
some say even not worth the trouble.
</p>

<p>
Code quality?  Ratings/reviews?  Moderation/metamoderation?
"Approved" SDKs?  These all are hotly debated subjects and will not be
addressed here since the CPAN is and will stay an open and free forum,
where the authors decide what they upload.  Any further selection
belongs to different fora.
</p>

<p>
The scripts that maintain the CPAN are dreadfully simple.  They are
just simple shell scripts that copy sites A, B,<nobr> <wbr></nobr>..., Z to the CPAN
master site at ftp.funet.fi, launched from cron.  Many of them use
Ye Olde Original mirror.pl, some of them are just rsyncs.  No magic.
I really don't have anything to give away, no magic bags full of
powerful CPAN spells.  The most complex script I think I have is the
script that probes the mirror sites for uptodateness-- and even that
is not rocket science, just multiplexing ftp and http downloads and
comparing timestamps.  If someone wants that code, they can have it.
</p>

<p>
Andreas has the webserver code for PAUSE available online.  That code
is slightly more complex than the core CPAN scripts, or the scripts
supporting the PAUSE; but even here, the code is there.  No tricks up
our sleeves.
</p>

<p>
There is no magic.  All it takes is a few people that sit down and get
first something running, a rough cut.  Then iteratively enhance it.
Perhaps the most demanding thing is commitment: someone must keep
things running.  A slowly decaying and dusty archive is almost worse
(and certainly more sad) than no archive at all.
</p>

<p>
Oook and out.

<h2>CPAN.pm</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Dom2/">Dom2</a> on 2002-11-12T17:58:54</h3>
Don't forget CPAN.pm.  That's the other end of the stick that lets people access the stuff inside CPAN in the most incredibly useful and lazy fashion.

<p>I honestly feel that without CPAN.pm, CPAN as a whole would not be as popular as it is today.  Look at something like HTML::Mason, which has a half dozen dependencies.  CPAN.pm Just Takes Care Of It[tm].

</p><p>-Dom

</p><p>P.S.  I know that CPAN.pm has many flaws, but it makes up for them by 1) being useful and 2) being installed by default with perl.</p>

Oops, a very good point, thanks.  But since Andreas himself didn't notice that omission in his proofreading of the article I don't feel that bad about forgetting it...<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)  But yes, an automatic network-aware installation mechanism, with the dependency resolving and checksum checking, is a very important step.<br> <br>I guess I'll start maintaining the master copy of<br>this article somewhere at CPAN, once the feedback settles down.<br> <br>



<h2>Re:CPAN.pm</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Elian/">Elian</a> on 2002-11-12T21:31:14</h3>
While CPAN.pm is important (as is search.cpan.org, and the DNS magic Ask has set up) they're really less important than many people think.<br> <br>It's not been that long since I managed systems where CPAN.pm was completely unusable, and I had to do it all by hand--FTP, make, and the like. No automatic dependency checking, no fetching, no module lists, nothing. (Plus it was five miles uphill in the snow to the nearest mirror!) The only thing available was the base mirror functionality. And with that... CPAN was phenomenally useful. Yeah, sure, I had to track dependencies by hand, but that wasn't a big deal. <br> <br>The CPAN mirror net and the naming conventions that were set up at the beginning are what provides the power, and drives the toys. CPAN.pm, CPANPLUS.pm, and all the rest are useful, certainly, but without the underpinnings they'd be useless.<br> <br>That so few people have ever gotten around to building a CPAN says something about the other language communities. (Likely that too few of them are sysadmins) As Jarkko said, it's not rocket science, and it's not even all that tough to get set up. Pity it happens so rarely.

CPAN.pm is what makes it possible for people who aren't admins, don't know how to become admins, and don't want to be admins to install perl modules.<br> <br>There may be some modules that don't install cleanly, or have strange external dependancies that they don't make clear<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... but those are special circumstances of the modules.  The bottom line is: if I write a pure perl module, and someone wants to use it, they can install it without needing to know anything other then perl.  As far as I'm concerned that's the most powerful part of CPAN. <br> <br>The mirroring and archiving and PAUSE are great, but the fact that anybody can install CPAN modules, without even needing to know what "make" is, or how to run "ftp" is what makes CPAN really great -- it gives all of those modules users.<br> <br>If someone wanted to try and duplicate the success of CPAN in another language, I think they would HAVE to have a "client" that worked just as well as CPAN.pm

<h3><a href="/user/Elian/">Elian</a> on 2002-11-12T23:21:24</h3>
I'm not knocking CPAN clients like CPAN.pm or CPANPLUS. I like 'em both, and I'm glad they're around, but... they're not what's made CPAN a success. They built on the success that CPAN had. Yes, they moved CPAN to a new level, and that was good, but the base mirror net and its infrastructure is what's made this all possible. The rest are (nearly inevitable) conveniences, bells, and whistles--often massively useful, but ultimately optional.



<blockquote>

<h2>Re:CPAN.pm</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/hfb/">hfb</a> on 2002-11-13T02:31:24</h3>
<p>Actually, I'd say the one thing that really 'made' CPAN was search.cpan....once it caught on it made CPAN accessible to a much wider audience which is why it is so often confused for the archive itself. CPAN was a success just by existing at a time when you had to ftp to 15 different sites just to get the kit you wanted for your systems. CPAN.pm made it convenient and search.cpan made it navigable and less intimidating for those a lot less familiar with CPAN. WAIT and UWinnipeg had been around for at least 2 years before search.cpan but something about the interface and design made it take off in spite of some of the problems I had keeping the box running when the load increased well beyond capacity. It is a very interesting chapter in the annals of perl.</p>

Besides CPAN.pm, you should not forget MakeMaker, that has simplified the process of building, installing, testing and packaging a module, portably, and consistently. People started to install modules from CPAN because they were easy to install ; they started to upload modules to CPAN because it was easy to produce an installable tarball.

<h2>MakeMaker</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Dom2/">Dom2</a> on 2002-11-13T11:35:01</h3>
Agreed.  MakeMaker is an important part of this process.  In fact, I hold high hopes for python modules now that they have had distutils.py for a year or more.  It'll make building an archive for them much easier.  I think ruby has something similiar as well, but I'm not sure...

<h2>Namespaces</h2>

I actually think that Java got it right when they used domain names as part of the namespace.  And really, I agree with Tim B-L when he says that we should be using URIs to identify such things.

<p>Mind you, I don't want to go down the route of SGML catalog files.  That's too much like hard work.

</p><p>-Dom</p>



<blockquote>

<h2>Re:Namespaces</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jhi/">jhi</a> on 2002-11-13T12:56:13</h3>
<p>I think the problem with using domain names is using domain names... that is, you make an implicit assumption that everybody
</p>
<ul>
<li>(a) is in possession of a domain name that they want to use and can use for tagging their software with</li>
<li>(b) tagging stuff with domain names may mean tagging stuff with trademarks and other legal stuff which may turn out to be a burden later if the software needs to be renamed for any reason.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Other way of putting it is that using domainnames works okay-ish for stabl-ish organizations like big companies, it might be less convenient for more mobile entities.  A smaller nit is that the DNS structure might give you wrong trust in class hierarchies that don't exist (this, of course being a Perl specific feature of naming).  Especially in larger organizations the hierarchy of DNS names might reflect very poorly the organizational (or software production) hierarchy. </p>
<p>
Summary: I think DNS was a step in the right 90 degrees sector, but not in the right direction.  DNS names are reasonably nice as opaque IDs, and their uniqueness is guaranteed by an outside entity, and they give you a reasonable rough idea who was produced the software, but that's where it end.  I think any module naming hierarchy should be independent of DNS.
</p>
<p>Using URIs would suffer from much of the same problems as using DNS.  It would be a little bit
better since the administration of the namespace
can be divided more, but still...</p>
<p>In fact I think the key for naming is to kiss goodbye to hierarchies.  I think the Rule One of Hierarchies is that you can never get hierarchies right.  If you think you got it right, you probably didn't ask enough people for their opinions. One should think in rules. A module should be identified by a (primarily) unordered set of rules: name, author, version, and so forth.

Thanks, excellent points.  When I update my document I'll underline the KISS principle with bold strokes, and also the issue of precompiling to byte/object code.<br> <br>

<h2>RT Ticketing</h2>

Just though I would add how much I like the RT system for CPAN. It's of great use to people like me on minority platforms (Solaris<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-).<br> <br>Pity the search.cpan.org web interface changed about a week after RT was released. Still the blue and white is nostalgic.<br> <br>One thing though - looks like ther SSL certificate for rt.cpan.org has expired on November 7th.<br> <br>Gavin

<h2>Source Code</h2>

At work we use CPAN.pm to install our own non CPAN modules.  Essentially this involves examining the modules building compatible index files with a simple script...
<p>
I'd love to have a look at the source code for PAUSE and the other systems.  Is it on the CPAN somewhere, or somewhere else online?</p>



<h2>There's also CTAN</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/m2/">m2</a> on 2002-11-13T14:04:03</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.ctan.org/" title="ctan.org">Comprehensive TeX Archive Network</a ctan.org>.  For some reason I've always thought that CTAN preceeded CPAN, but I'm not really sure which one was there first.  Like CPAN, CTAN was conceived as a FTP-based service and then the web came and people moved on and you know the rest.  Since I use both CTAN and CPAN on a regular basis, sometimes I find myself wishing CTAN to be more CPAN-like.  The CTAN Catalog is superb, but I think the killer CPAN feature is the ability to browse the documentation in a nice easy to read format.  (La)TeX packages have great documentation, but you sort of requiere a DVI or PS viewer, which aren't really documentation browsing tools (cut and pasting code is hard or impossible).</p>

CTAN was there first, and we freely acknowledge our debt and inspiration in naming<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br>CPAN is "only" seven years old, while CTAN is, gee, older than that.  I can't off-hand find out how old CTAN is.<br>

We (George Greewade in the US, Sebastian Rahtz in UK, Rainer Sch&#246;pf and myself in Germany) built CTAN in 1992. It was "officially" announced at the EuroTeX conference in Aston, 1993.
<p>
CTAN was an effort to bring together the separating ftp servers with TeX material. I'm proud to say that it was triggered by a podium discussion I organized at the EuroTeX conference 1991, in Paris. George came up with the name CTAN, I think I have his email still somewhere in my archives. I got involved since I ran one of the largest ftp servers in Germany at this time (ftp.tu-darmstadt.de) and had heavily modified mirror.pl from Lee for this purpose.
</p><p>
The CTAN site structure were actually put together at the start of 1992 (Sebastian did the main work, as he did later with TeXLive), and synchronized at the start of 1993. The TeX Users Group provided a framework for this task's organization, there was a Technical Working Group  for this purpose.

Effort in CTAN package documentation actually goes into TeXlive. The new distribution has most of the documentation in PDF. HTML is not practical, since most of the documentation will demonstrate some layout example.
<p>
Maybe we'll find sometime the volunteers to transport this effort back to CTAN.
</p><p>
Actually, there's a lot in CPAN we'd like to have in CTAN as well, and never got around it. Most important, something similar to PAUSE, and commonly agreed upon package structures.
</p><p>
Sigh, so much to do, so few time. (w/ apologies to jwz.)
