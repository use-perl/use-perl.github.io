<p>Fletch writes <i>"According to <a href="http://www.deadly.org/article.php3?sid=20021113033153">deadly.org</a>, perl has been upgraded from 5.6.1 to 5.8.0 in openbsd-current.  Several other modules in the ports collection were also updated to newer versions."</i>  These changes were made <i>after</i> the release of OpenBSD 3.2.  To get a version of OpenBSD with Perl 5.8.0 as your stock Perl, upgrade to the CVS version of OpenBSD, or wait a few months for OpenBSD 3.3.  Enjoy!</p>

<h2>packages are nice</h2>

FreeBSD and NetBSD both have perl in the package system, rather than the base system.  While most of us may have no desire whatsoever to run a computer without perl, I can imagine that someone else might.<br> <br>In fact, I'd love it if these systems made all parts of the base system into packages.  That would avoid the strangeness of having e.g. postfix, BIND, sendmail, and openssh maintained both in the base system *and* as packages.<br>

<p>Well, as with every thing else, there is a reason for that:</p>
<p>The base system is suppose to be a complete system.  A system shipping with all nessessary components for a running UNIX system.  It is like buying a car.  A car comes with tyres and steering wheel, eventhough some people replaces them with low-profile wheels and a sports car steering wheel.  So it is with Sendmail/Apache/Named.  If you don't like it, install something else, but it comes with the base.</p>
<p>Of course there are good reasons to put it in packages, but what about the rest: I don't like vi, i'd rather install pico, awk is stupid, I want Ruby.  I have seen Linux rescue disk without the basic UNIX set, and spend 20 minutes just guessing which editor was there.</p>

<i>The base system is suppose to be a complete system.</i> <br> <br>Sure, I can imagine a set of applications being labelled "complete system," and distributed on CDs to the public, etc..  But that is not a reason to have those programs exist outside a package system.  In fact, having all parts of the system as packages means that you can have different visions of "base system":  for instance, a workstation may not need sshd, and I doubt anyone really needs *both* mail servers that are in the NetBSD base system.  Another example is name servers:  my friend runs djbdns (yes, I know the license sucks) on a NetBSD machine, but has no easy way to uninstall BIND. This is one (maybe the only) place where I feel like Red Hat did something nicer than NetBSD.<br> <br>(I am talking about NetBSD because that is what I have the most experience with; these arguments apply to the other BSDs as well, I believe.  Please straighten me out if I am libelling OpenBSD!)
