<p><a href="mailto:luismunoz@the-place-where-you-get-your-perl-modu">lem</a> writes <i>"In the very near future, I will most likely have to write an interface for a few boxes that speak <a href="http://www.tl1.com/">TL1</a>. I failed miserably at CPAN while looking for an implementation of this, so I'll write it from scratch. I just would hate to start from zero here. My obvious question is if anybody is already working on something like this, as I don't want to reinvent the wheel and find out two hours before uploading to CPAN, that the namespace has been taken by a module that does the same thing."</i>  Is this the sort of thing one would discuss on <a href="http://lists.perl.org/showlist.cgi?name=module-authors">module-authors</a>?</p>

<h2>I've done that</h2>

I have implemented a TL1 parsing, object oriented module. Problem is I did it for work, and releasing the code is very unlikely. I am a CPAN contributor. I can help you with advice. Look up my CPAN ID "SEGAN".



<h2>RE: TL1 anyone?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/icarus/">icarus</a> on 2002-11-29T12:59:53</h3>
I also recently created a GUI for TL1 commands that had been stored/created in XML format, using perl with a standard XML parser module and the Tk module I was able to extract, sort and process all the verb-modifiers, AID's and individual parameter blocks of the TL1 commands. I don't believe that there are currently any off the shelf modules for TL1. Can provide you with advice and help but not code the that I had written as I also had done this for work.
