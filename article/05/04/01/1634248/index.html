<p><a href="http://yapc.org/America/">RichDice</a> writes <i>"Just a reminder -- the Call-For-Papers deadline for Yet Another Perl Conference North America 2005 in Toronto is April 18 -- that's only 2.5 weeks away from now.  As a reminder that this is coming up soon, we are issuing this Second Call-For-Papers.

</i><p><i>
Once all papers are submitted, the YAPC conference organizing team will review them over the following week and hopefully have a draft conference schedule by Monday 25 April.

</i></p><p><i>
Also, if you haven't registered yet, please do!  Prompt registration is <b>very</b> recommended as hotel and other accommodations in Toronto are going to book up quickly for the end of June.  Book by the first week of May -- you're good.  After that, nothing can be guaranteed.

ok, it looks like the website says the rooms are booked, but if you call you can get one.  at least that's what they said when they took my charge number...



<h2>Re:booked</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/RichDice/">RichDice</a> on 2005-04-07T18:03:17</h3>
No, the rooms are not all booked.  Not even close.
<p>
The Toronto.pm organizers, in their eternal lack for organizational time, are only now on the cusp of releasing to the world the actual booking information, including booking codes.
</p><p>
We have 250 rooms reserved (until Thu. 12 May) at 89 Chestnut Street, which is the conference location as well.  If you booked one there then you are the first.  So, 249 left.  I don't even know if your booking was counted as a YAPC booking, as we haven't publicized the YAPC booking code yet.  (We only got it ourselves earlier this week.)
</p><p>
We have another 150 rooms reserved at Ryerson University, about a 10 minute walk away.
</p><p>
A lot of things are under control;  accommodations is one of them.  Communications efforts are getting better.  Thanks for the patience.  If anyone has any questions, please email <a href="mailto:na-help@yapc.org" title="mailto">na-help@yapc.org</a mailto>.  This is probably the best way to minimize public and private confusion and mixed messages.
</p><p>
Geoffrey, thanks for your paper submissions, by the way.  More from others are very welcome and hoped-for!
</p><p>
Cheers,<br>
Richard</p>

ok, no problem.  I tried their online booking tool and it showed the entire week blocked out, which got me worried.  but I guess that was just yapc reserving the entire place<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br> <br><br/><br/>and you're right about the booking code - I said I was attending the conference and they hunted around for about 10 minutes trying to figure out which one.  but they eventually said they found it ("P E R L?") and gave me a $79 rate.<br> <br><br/><br/>wrt the submissions, no problem - I'm looking forward to it<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
