Yea, I liked it too - great to be able to acquire Perl related information while *not* sitting on your ass. Keep it up.

<h2>It's a good start</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/brian_d_foy/">brian_d_foy</a> on 2005-04-27T02:32:50</h3>
The Perlcast is a really good start. I'm not a big fan of podcasts, but that doesn't make any difference<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br> <br>I listened to the first six episodes while I was in the airport yesterday, and the production values of each one got better and better.<br> <br>He does need more news sources besides use.perl, though<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)



<h2>Perl Podcasting</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/blackmylar/">blackmylar</a> on 2005-04-28T02:55:06</h3>
I discovered the podcast a week ago and I have to say that I'm grateful for the content (I spend 3 hrs a day commuting).  My <a href="http://www.audible.com/" title="audible.com">Audible</a audible.com> account gives me 2 books a month, and it's nice to have something perlish to fill in the gaps once I finish the second book of the month.
Many thanks<br>

<h2>I love it</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Brent/">Brent</a> on 2005-05-02T20:31:55</h3>
I've been listening to the Perlcast for a couple of weeks now, and I love it.  I find Josh's voice very easy to listen to, and the content hits my sweet spot -- technical without being arcane.



<h2>The interviews rock.</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/nmcfarl/">nmcfarl</a> on 2005-05-11T23:09:31</h3>
I just got through listening to the  latest perlcasts, 7&amp;8 -  which where posted after this article it looks like.  They both have interview, and they are excellent.  What is going on with interesting projects right from the horses mouth. It couldn't be better!



<h2>$commute++</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/silent11/">silent11</a> on 2005-06-24T15:41:01</h3>
The casts I've listened to (about 7 in total) have been great! It makes my +1hr commute more bearable.

<p>

I really enjoy the interviews, module reviews (especially the obscure ones), application reviews, and news. Even hearing about problems you've run into and how you've overcome them is interesting. I like how there is something for people of all levels (beginner to advanced).

</p> <p>

Oh, and don't worry about the casts being too long, IMHO there is no such think as a cast lasting too long. Not yours anyway. If is in any way related to Perl then the chances are that we're interested in what you have to say about it -- and so far even your tangents have been interesting<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

</p> <p>

Keep up the good work. Yours is the only podcast I've found worthy of listening to.</p>
