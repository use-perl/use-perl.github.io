<p>Registration for <a href="http://yapc.org/America/">YAPC::NA</a> (Yet Another Perl Conference, North America)
2005 in Toronto, Ontario, Canada is now open.
<p>
The conference registration price is USD$85.  This price includes
admission to all aspects of the conference, respectable amounts of
catering, several activities and a few conference goodies.

Please see <a href="http://yapc.org/America/register-2005.shtml">the website</a> for full details, and we hope to see you in Toronto this summer!</p></p>

I will probably go to YAPC::NA instead of OSCON this year, and stay at Toronto for a couple more days to work with people willing to hack Pugs, handing out committer bits on the spot, and pair/group program a bit. All is welcome to join.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

Autrijus,

<p>
I really look forward to seeing you at YAPC.  If you plan on staying for a few days afterwards then I suggest you book yourself accommodations Real Soon Now.  Toronto will be hosting a <b>major</b> convention right after YAPC concludes and hotel space in the city for that time frame is disappearing fast.  To add to things, the weekend following YAPC is Canada's national holiday weekend, so there will be a lot of tourists around looking for hotel rooms too.

</p><p>
Please contact me and I'll help you through the process, give you some ideas and suggestions, etc.

</p><p>
Cheers,<br>
Richard<br>
(The YAPC Toronto conference chairman guy)</p>

Just curious, but if it's in Canada, why isn't the price also listed in CAD?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

Two reasons:<br> <br>1.  The back-end systems are run by The Perl Foundation, which is based in Michigan.  I don't know if they could charge CAD$ even if I wanted them to.<br> <br>2.  I expect that something like 60% of the conference attendees will be American, and I want to make it easy on them.  Canadians will have no difficulties making the needed mental adjustments to the CAD$-consequences of the conference being paid for in USD$, because we have to do these kinds of mental adjustments for things all the time.  Americans rarely-if-ever have to "think in CAD$", so that might be a problem for some.<br> <br>Cheers,<br>Richard<br>

I live in Michigan, too.  I just asked out of curiosity, because I was halfway expecting it to be listed in both on the YAPC::NA website.

<h2>Hotel Accommodation</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/barbie/">barbie</a> on 2005-03-21T09:28:49</h3>
Is there going to be an announcement regarding the recommended conference hotel real soon?
<p>Given the content in other comments, that there is going to be a lot of interest in getting a hotel booked that time of year, it would be really helpful for those of us coming from afar, to know which hotels we should be looking at (and those to avoid) as soon as possible. It is only 3 months away after all<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<h2>Re:Hotel Accommodation</h2>

Yes, the information will all be up on the <a href="http://yapc.org/America/" title="yapc.org">http://yapc.org/America/</a yapc.org> web site Real Soon Now.
<p>
Also, all registrants will receive an email with instructions on the recommended how-and-where to get accommodations booked within a few days of registering.
</p><p>
There should be no practical problem associated with registering for the conference now and then booking accomodations a few days from now when we (for example) are given the group registration code from the hotel.  We have several hundred rooms reserved so there won't be any problem getting one... until when the group reservation expires, which is on Thu 12 May.  After that, getting a room will be more difficult.
</p><p>
Cheers,<br>
Richard</p>

As of a few days ago, all registered attendees had emails sent out to them with hotel booking information.  This information is also available on the YAPC::NA web site now, too:  <a href="http://yapc.org/America/accommodations-2005.shtml" title="yapc.org">http://yapc.org/America/accommodations-2005.shtml</a yapc.org>
