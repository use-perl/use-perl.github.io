<p><a href="http://www.askbjoernhansen.com/">Ask Bj&#248;rn Hansen</a> writes <i>"<a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/os2005/">OSCON</a> is headed back to friendly, economical Portland, Oregon during the week of August 1-5, 2005. If you've ever wanted to join the OSCON speaker firmament, now's your chance to submit a proposal (or two) by February 13, 2005.<br> </i></p>
<p><br>Complete details are available on the OSCON web site, but we're particularly interested in exploring how software development is moving to another level, and how developers and businesses are adjusting to new business models and architectures. We're looking for sessions, tutorials, and workshops proposals that appeal to developers, systems and network administrators, and their managers in the following areas:<br> <br>- All aspects of building applications, services, and systems that use the new capabilities of the open source platform<br>- Burning issues for Java, Mozilla, web apps, and beyond<br>- The commoditization of software: who and/or what can show us the money?<br>- Network-enabled collaboration<br>- Software customizability, including software as a service<br>- Law, licensing, politics, and how best to navigate other troubled waters<br> <br>Specific topics and tracks at OSCON 2005 include: Linux and other open source operating systems, Java, PHP, Python, Perl, Databases (including MySQL and PostgreSQL), Apache, XML, Applications, Ruby, and Security.<br> <br>Attendees have a wide range of experience, so be sure to target a particular level of experience: beginner, intermediate, advanced. Talks and tutorials should be technical; strictly no marketing presentations. Session presentations are 45 or 90 minutes long, and tutorials are either a half-day (3 hours) or a full day (6 hours).<br> <br>Feel free to spread the word about the Call for Proposals to your friends, family, colleagues, and compatriots. We want everyone to submit, from American women hacking artificial life into the Linux kernel to Belgian men building a better mousetrap from PHP and recycled military hardware. We mean everyone!<br> <br>Even if you don't want to participate as a speaker, send us your suggestions--topics you'd like to see covered, groups we should bring into the OSCON fold, extra-curricular activities we should organize--to oscon-idea@oreilly.com<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.<br> <br>This year, we're moving to the wide open spaces of the Oregon Convention Center. We've arranged for the nearby Doubletree Hotel to be our headquarters hotel--it's a short, free Max light rail ride (or a lovely walk) from the Convention Center.<br> <br>Registration opens in April 2005; hotel information will be available shortly.<br> <br>Deadline to submit a proposal is Midnight (PST), February 13.<br> <br>For all the conference details, go to:<br> <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/os2005/">http://conferences.oreillynet.com/os2005/</a> <br> <br>Press coverage, blogs, photos, and news from the 2004 O'Reilly Open Source Convention can be found at: <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/oscon2004/">http://www.oreillynet.com/oscon2004/</a> <br> <br>Would your company like to make a big impression on the open source community? If so, consider exhibiting or becoming a sponsor. Contact Andrew Calvo at (707) 827-7176, or andrewc@oreilly.com for more info.<br> <br>See you Portland next summer,<br> <br>The O'Reilly OSCON Team"</p>
