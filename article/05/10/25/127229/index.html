<p>hfb writes <i>"Today marks the 10th Anniversary of the CPAN archive. Ten years and countless mirrors and modules later its still alive and growing. The <a href="http://www.funet.fi/pub/languages/perl/CPAN/misc/CPAN.ANNOUNCE">original announcement</a> sure can make you get all misty for the early days of the net. The mention of perl5-ext almost makes me tingle.<br/><br/><br> <br>
The doc/ tree still needs someone of the packrat persuasion to give it life again should anyone be interested. We've been looking for a volunteer for a few years so maybe 10 years will be the charm. :)<br/><br/><br> <br>
Happy 10th Birthday CPAN!"</i></p>

Then world-wide web came driving him,<br>

Thank you, jhi, andk, as well as numerous other keepers and librarians, for giving us a vocabulary to express our thoughts and shape the reality with.  Many happy returns!</p>

Happy Birthday to CPAN!

<p>Thanks to the librarians, the sysadmins, the several alternate search providers, and of course, the myriad PAUSE module authors.

I may be interested in that.  I'm quite the packrat... really, you should see my office!  Drop me a line and let me know more... you just might have a volunteer!

What's involved? updating www.cpan.org/docs? (is there something we can look at as a guideline?). I might be able to give GeekOnDemand a hand if he's open to it (and it doesn't require my firstborn...actually, that's appealing, but the wife will veto me...)

Well, there's nothing specific I/We had in mind other than populating the tree with stuff/docs that have some historical interest as the perldoc.com site has much of the documentation covered. I have a pile of stuff like slides from talks at conferences, a few pictures of note, the archive of clpa, perl.com announcements, #perl group pics, etc. that might be appropriate. As long as it isn't porn or advertisements, it's pretty much whatever might be interesting down the road.  Being organized and slow, but consistent, with an interest in archiving bits for posterity is optimal.
