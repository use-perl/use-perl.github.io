<p>That was another busy week. Steve Peters has been shaking
the bag of (old and new) Perl RT tickets, raising
a lot of activity and enticing answers for long
forgotten issues. A lot of action in disparate
corners which Perl integrates: VMS, Win32,
EBCDIC platforms, Symbian, among others.</p>
<p><h2>Issues on Older Perls</h2>
<p>Do you think nobody cares anymore with
ancient Perl 5 sources? You're plain wrong
if you answered yes.</p>
<p> <strong>If You Really Want perl5.004</strong>
Back in Sep 13, Shaun Daredia started a thread
by asking for help to compile perl5.004_05,
which was amended with some clues this week.
Steven Schubiger mentioned there are some known
issues compiling perl5.00x with gcc and upgrading
would be the best to do. Andy Dougherty said
it could be done by hand-editing <em>makefile</em>
and maybe <em>x2p/makefile</em>. Marcus Holland-Moritz
suggested using the <em>buildperl.pl</em> script
from <code>Devel::PPPort</code>, which does the extraordinary
work to (batch)
build 5.003, 5.004_0[0-5], 5.005_0[0-4] and 5.x.x.</p>
<pre>
    <a href="http://xrl.us/ht7j">http://xrl.us/ht7j</a> </pre>
<p> <strong> Fixes to perl5.00504 and <code>DB_File</code> </strong>
In a followup to bug #27188, Steve Peters
pointed two issues in the ticket. First, the suggested patch
which should fix the problem (failing test due to <em>DB_File.pm</em>)
had not been applied to the 5.00504 branch.
Second, the perlbug mail addresses were just wrong,
and Steve attached a patch to fix that.
The patch expected to make <em>lib/db-tree.t</em> work
on all platforms where <code>DB_File</code> isn't built
attracted the attention of Paul Marquess who
volunteered to apply the change to the CPAN
and 5.9.3 version of <code>DB_File</code>. Warnocked by now.</p>

<h2>New Core Module Releases</h2>
</p><p>Only a new core module release this
week, when S&#233;bastien Aperghis-Tramoni announced
the upload of XSLoader 0.04 to CPAN and a patch for blead.</p>
<pre>
    <a href="http://xrl.us/ht7m">http://xrl.us/ht7m</a> </pre>
<p>Michael Schwern and Yitzchak Scott-Thoennes had
some observations, which pressed for a new release.
On Michael's suggestion, the test scripts
were rewritten to use <code>Test::More</code>, getting
rid of a lot of clunky constructs. Michael also said
that <code>XSLoader</code> should prefer
<code>DynaLoader</code>'s <code>bootstrap_inherit()</code> should it exist
and S&#233;bastien agreed and implemented.</p>
<p>As chromatic didn't understand why the idiom</p>
<pre>
    ::ok( ref Cwd-&gt;can('fastcwd'),'CODE' )</pre>
<p>was used, Michael answered it addressed one of the
pitfalls of <code>Test.pm</code>'s swiss-army <code>ok()</code> which
executes code references. So you almost never
want to pass it a code ref. Just another reason
for <code>Test::More</code>. (The things you learn in p5p!)</p>
<p>To Yitzchak, <code>use strict</code> did not seem a good idea for
a module supposed to be light. S&#233;bastien relieved
Yitzchak's concern saying
<code>XSLoader</code> is now strict-safe, but <code>use strict</code> is not
actually used to avoid the cost of loading it. Yitzchak
pointed a forgotten <code>no strict 'refs'</code> that caused <em>strict.pm</em>
to be loaded.</p>
<p>After this, S&#233;bastien announced the 0.05 version
of <code>XSLoader</code> which was applied to blead.</p>
<pre>
    <a href="http://xrl.us/ht7n">http://xrl.us/ht7n</a> </pre>
<p>
<h2>Platform-Specific Issues</h2>
</p><p> <strong>No Symlinks to be Found on Win32</strong>
Steve Peters seemed to have concluded the investigation on broken <code>File::Find::find</code>
on Win32 with <code>follow =&gt; 1</code>. Not being able to tell exactly what change caused
the problem, Steve Peters posted a patch which makes Win32 to never follow
symbolic links (which aren't available anyway). All tests pass, which Steve Peters
finds scary. Steve Hay applied the patch and thought it was weirder before when
tests succeeded with a broken <code>find()</code>.</p>
<pre>
    <a href="http://xrl.us/ht7o">http://xrl.us/ht7o</a> </pre>
<p> <strong>Path Behavior on Win32</strong>
Back in Sep 17, Gisle Aas posted a patch to make
<code>File::Spec::Win32-&gt;path</code>
behave more like an internal utility often used. Steve Hay
reported on a failure seen on <em>lib/ExtUtils/t/MM_Win32.t</em>
and proposed a patch to fix it.
Gisle, Michael Schwern and Jan Dubois engaged in
a discussion where the main fact was that Win32
always searches in the current directory first,
before searching in the directories in the command path
- an anomaly in Unix terms.
That prompted for a fix to the test and the application
of Gisle's original patch. Microsoft makes a point
of honor
to keep buggy third part running on new versions of
Windows just like they were used to do and Perl on Win32
has to live with that.</p>
<pre>
    <a href="http://xrl.us/ht7p">http://xrl.us/ht7p</a> </pre>
<p> <strong>Compiling Perl on HP-UX</strong>
Steve Peters prods Rahul Sharma about the outcome of
discussion of bug #37162 about a failure to compile Perl 5.8.6
with <em>cc</em> on HP-UX, with no answer so far.</p>
<pre>
    <a href="http://xrl.us/ht7q">http://xrl.us/ht7q</a> </pre>
<p> <strong>Compiling Perl on AIX</strong>
Alan Olsen noticed none of the compile problems for AIX 5.3
(discussed in previous week between him and Campo Weijerman)
was entered to RT and asked if he should do it. H.Merijn
Brand said he would prefer a patch to docs and
a workaround in <em>hints/aix.sh</em>. Campo Weijerman posted
a partial summary of the current states of affairs, where
some unresolved issues remain. Alan and H.Merijn in a long
sequence of messages exchanged hints and findings
while doing experiments with different versions of AIX
and different versions of gcc and vac compilers.
That included recommendations to build one's own
gcc, use IBM's ld and whether <code>-bbigtoc</code> is needed or
not (whatever it is). Maybe in the next week, we see
the outcome of all this.</p>
<pre>
    <a href="http://xrl.us/ht7r">http://xrl.us/ht7r</a> </pre>
<p> <strong>Symbian Update</strong>
Jarkko Hietaniemi posted a tiny patch tweaking symbols
and an <code>#include</code> for Symbian, which was applied after
a minor fix Jarkko himself found necessary.</p>

<h2>Perl5 Bug Summary</h2>
</p><p>Robert Spier brought the Perl5 Bug Summary with the count of 1516
open tickets against 1513 in the last week. Nicholas Clark still kept
the lead. Robert remembered Queen Mary I, More's Utopia and
Reinheitsgebot (which is about beer).</p>

<p>
<h2>Perl on VMS</h2>
</p><p>John E. Malmberg continued to champion an effort towards
adding support
to the ODS-5 file system for Perl on VMS. To make it work
right, he engaged in discussions with other Perl 5 porters
about VMS specific modules
and extensions to general core modules.</p>
<p> <strong>VMS Modules</strong>
Peter Prymmer made a few points about adding new modules
like <code>VMS::Config</code> or <code>VMS::FeatureSet</code> to the VMS
Perl distribution and how it could help John Malmberg's
desire to alter perl's tests. With respect to changes
to <code>vmsish</code>, Peter noticed that scripts with</p>
<pre>
    use vmsish;</pre>
<p>may run on Unix as well, what fosters cross platform
perl scripting. Either this would change or John
would take the burden of making a perl extension
which runs everywhere.
John E. Malmberg proceeded to explain how he thought
the proposed VMS changes could enter <code>VMS::Filespec</code>
and a newly created <code>VMS::Config</code>. Peter told
about a number of issues that may weight the decisions
about the actual API, including how interpretation
of some parameters is arbitrary and at the whim of
OS vendors.</p>
<pre>
    <a href="http://xrl.us/ht7u">http://xrl.us/ht7u</a> </pre>
<p> <strong> Adding Methods to <em>Filespec.pm</em> </strong>
When trying to add some methods in <em>Filespec.pm</em>,
John E. Malmberg realized it was not as simple as he thought.
Michael Schwern explained <em>Filespec.pm</em> uses <code>AutoLoader</code>
and asked if John remembered to whack out the <code>Autoloader</code> bits.
John went on to find out more about <code>AutoLoader</code>.</p>
<pre>
    <a href="http://xrl.us/ht7v">http://xrl.us/ht7v</a> </pre>
<p> <strong> <code>VMS::Filespec</code> Update </strong>
John E. Malmberg posted a patch for <code>VMS::Filespec</code> adding
the methods needed for other core modules to properly
interpret VMS file specifications.
He showed a long list of modules that need to be changed
to test for the existence of the new methods, and called
for suggestions about the best way to make it work.</p>
<p>Michael Schwern expressed concern about John's long list:
too much platform-specific code for a rare case.
John explained his rationale was to demand
less or no modification
for CPAN modules and Perl scripts not yet ported to VMS,
something made possible with the new Unix-related modes.
He also posted a
roadmap for continuing with changes in tests
coherent with the new VMS functionality.</p>
<p>Michael thought some of the mentioned problems were
basic cross-platform compat issues. He would
prefer to see code that works everywhere or
things like "if this system has feature X, do Y"
but not platform-tied behavior. He suggested
John to code the logic in a CPAN module and
admitted he meant for long to write basic
modules to allow easy answers for the sorts
of questions John had.</p>
<pre>
    <a href="http://xrl.us/ht7w">http://xrl.us/ht7w</a> </pre>
<p> <strong> Introducing <code>File::System::Spec</code> </strong>
After Michael Schwern's suggestion, John E. Malmberg wrote
and showed up a <code>File::System::Spec</code> module
to abstract getting filesystem information, working for Unix and VMS.
Yuval Kogman said how important is being able to ask
about a specific file system for OSes, like OSX and VMS, supporting many
at the same time with different properties.
Michael asks John for coordinating with the work
already done in the subject, which can be seen in the link</p>
<pre>
    <a href="http://svn.schwern.org/svn/CPAN/File-System-Spec/trunk/lib/File/System/Spec.pm">http://svn.schwern.org/svn/CPAN/File-System-Spec/trunk/lib/File/System/Spec.pm</a> </pre>
<p>John made a lot of observations and wondered what
timeframe can be planned to release this improved
functionality, as it is blocking the Perl on VMS
support for current features of the ODS-5 file system.</p>

<h2>A Warning, <em>perldiag</em>, <code>splain</code> </h2>
</p><p>Mark-Jason Dominus has opened bug #36950 in the last week
to say about a bizarre warning emitted by the following
piece of code.</p>
<pre>
    use Data::Dumper;
    open my($O), &quot;&gt;&quot;, &quot;/tmp/out&quot;;
    print $O Data::Dumper-&gt;Dump([], []);</pre>
<pre>
    Bareword found where operator expected at /tmp/bug.pl line 3, near &quot;$O Data::Dumper&quot;
            (Missing operator before Data::Dumper?)</pre>
<p>As Rafael could not reproduce it with maint or blead,
Mark thought the warning didn't need to find its way to <em>perldiag</em>.
But Ronald J. Kimball pointed it is already there with
a variable first word and Yitzchak Scott-Thoennes showed
how to find the corresponding diagnostics with the <code>splain</code>
utility.  Abigail found that it probably has been fixed somewhere
between 5.8.0 and 5.8.1.</p>

<h2> <code>exit()</code> Status Code Made Right</h2>
</p><p>Ken Hirsch pointed how the perl code assumes <code>$?&gt;&gt;8</code> as
the status code from <code>exit()</code>, which
is true on most systems, but not all. This causes
the build of 5.9.3 to fail in at least one platform.
Ken asked if the macro <code>WEXITSTATUS()</code> from POSIX
module could be the way to go. Steve Hay pointed
the existence of <code>${^CHILD_ERROR_NATIVE}</code> in blead
which could be of some use. With Steve's hint,
Ken Hirsch made it work for the MPE/iX system,
but a couple of issues persisted. Gisle Aas
explained the need to override the
default behavior of the <code>STATUS_UNIT_SET()</code> macro,
something which can't be done portably with POSIX macros.</p>

<p>
<h2>The Future of <em>mv-if-diff</em> </h2>
</p><p>In a continuation to the previous week's discussion, Vadim
Konovalov sketched how the build problems could be worked
out with helper file and script. The solution displeased
Rafael Garcia-Suarez because of the extra complexity to maintenance.
Vadim mentioned <em>win32/sync_ext.pl</em> as a precedent
to the proposed approach.</p>
<p>Andy Dougherty guessed the dependency tree evolution
made the <em>mv-if-diff</em> optimization no longer useful
and voted for letting it go. Nicholas wondered ways
to reconcile the script's role at the present,
but prefers a simple <em>Makefile</em>. Alan Burlison is
not sad to see it going as perl build on Solaris
doesn't use it anyway.</p>
<p>Mike Guy pointed the bug in build logic was that
making <em>Config.pm</em> doesn't require that <em>miniperl</em> is
up to date, just that it exists at all. Nicholas agreed,
but has no clue how to specify a portable rule to
do such thing. Mike Guy and Yitzchak Scott-Thoennes
had things to say about the issue.</p>
<pre>
    <a href="http://xrl.us/ht72">http://xrl.us/ht72</a> </pre>
<p>
<h2> <code>require</code> (takes 1 and 2)</h2>
</p><p>Michael Schwern reported <code>CORE::GLOBAL::require</code>
and <code>require 5</code> being broken in blead and supplied a test patch.
Rafael Garcia-Suarez filled in the issue by patching
the <code>require</code> patch recently applied.</p>
<pre>
    <a href="http://xrl.us/ht73">http://xrl.us/ht73</a> </pre>
<p>In bug #37274, Michael Schwern reported on how strange
was the behavior of <code>CORE::require</code> and <code>CORE::GLOBAL::require</code>
and how perl could be sent to deep recursion with his findings.
Rafael noticed how overriding <code>require()</code> is special
to guarantee</p>
<pre>
    require Foo::Bar;</pre>
<p>pass <em>Foo/Bar.pm</em> as an argument and pointed that the problem
was already fixed by patch 25599. He also added that
sometimes contortions to the code, like a new token
and a couple of new rules, can be added to avoid impacting
performance with an added new flag and test for each
time a new unary op is built. Schwern conceded
and wondered about <code>CORE::do</code> and <code>CORE::glob</code> which, during
his investigations, have been found to display
potentially similar bugs. Rafael fixed <code>do()</code>
single-handedly and stood staring at the big scary case
of <code>glob()</code>.</p>
<pre>

<p>
<h2>Reason #19389 to Use Explicit Returns</h2>
</p><p>Ron Savage, in bug #37289, reported on a script which
made Perl erratic on returning hash refs.
Yitzchak Scott-Thoennes called for more details, guessing
it could be due to perl choosing
to interpret the ambiguous <code>{ }</code> as a block or as an anonymous
hash constructor. And that's exactly what's happening, said
Michael Schwern, which called it Reason #19389 to use explicit return
statements. Ron tried with <code>+</code>
and <code>return</code> to disambiguate the syntactic constructions and everything
worked. He asked if it would be possible to output a warning in such cases.
Steven Schubiger replied by telling such warnings
would be superfluous and undesirable against
programmers' habits and the body of code out there.
Maybe the functionality could be added in a
pragma similar to <code>use strict 'return'</code>,
but disabled by default.</p>
<pre>
    <a href="http://xrl.us/ht75">http://xrl.us/ht75</a> </pre>
<p>
<h2>Untested Builtins</h2>
</p><p>Continuing on a discussion on writing tests for builtins
(dated back to Aug 8), Steven Schubiger wondered how
tests for <code>getprotoent()</code> could be written and expected
to be consistent on all systems. Then he announced to have
started to work out basic tests of <code>getprotobynumber()</code>.
He called for ideas and critiques, warning that the tests
should throw plenty of errors on non-native Unix systems.
Steve Hay confirmed Steven's suspicions with the
output of a Windows XP box and protocols file of this system.
Steven adjusted the tests, hoping to see it tested
on other platforms.
Steve Hay said the last patch worked on XP, but he's
not sure about other Windows flavors. He was going to
give a try with NT4, 2000 and a ferret.
Steven Schubiger propose that <em>getprotobynumber.t</em>
gets integrated
to bleadperl so that subsequent smokes will reveal which
further adjustments are in order.</p>

<p>
<h2> <code>Compress::Zlib</code> and <code>vsnprintf</code> </h2>
</p><p>During his work to port 5.9.3 to MPE/iX (HP3000) operating system,
Ken Hirsch found out that some zlib defines caused
trouble when building the perl source
automatically and called for help.
H.Merijn Brand pointed hint files could be used and
were the right thing to do.
Some modules have their own hints folder and one could be
created for <code>Compress::Zlib</code>.
As the problem was related to <code>vsnprintf</code> availability,
Nicholas Clark thought it could be handy to add a probe
for <code>vsnprintf</code> on the top level perl Configure, which
in turn could drive that choice.</p>
<p>Paul Marquess (<code>Compress::Zlib</code> author) has agreed
on the two solutions and said it would be prepared
to make it work. He adds that
<code>Compress::Zlib</code> only uses a subset of the zlib sources
and the beta of version 2 on CPAN uses even less.
The most significant difference is that building <em>gzio.c</em>
is unnecessary, and that's where lives all of zlib file IO
(including the uses of <code>vsnprintf</code>).
Ken Hirsch posted a hint file that worked for him.</p>

<h2>The Big Thread <code>&quot;use Foo 1&quot;</code> </h2>
</p><p>This was the winner thread of this week,
counting 61 messages or so.
In bug #37292, Yves Orton disliked the discrepancy on how a module
which uses <code>Exporter</code> and one that does not react to
module version checks. In the command line</p>
<pre>
    perl -MTestVersion=100 -e1</pre>
<p>does version checking (and probably throws an
error) for Exporter-based modules while
this doesn't happen with non-Exporter-based
modules. Rafael answered this issue is
documented in <code>perlrun</code> and</p>
<pre>
    perl -MTestVersion\ 100 -e1</pre>
<p>is more like what Yves wanted. Yves' one-liner
compiles to <code>use TestVersion split(/,/,'100',0)</code>.
And that calls attention for the subtle
distinction of the statements below.</p>
<pre>
    use Foo 1;   # does version checking
    use Foo &quot;1&quot;; # calls import(&quot;1&quot;)</pre>
<p>If the later inherits from <code>Exporter</code>,
version checking is done in <code>Exporter::import()</code>,
which accounts for the difference of behavior
that triggered the discussion. Many others
entered the discussion, including Graham Barr
teaching us a bit of Perl history.
The version checking capability (added by him)
was meant to remedy the fact
that modules that did not inherit from Exporter
could not be checked. "I am not saying this
is the right way, but this is how it came about."
In short, the documentation in <code>perldoc -f use</code>
has the final saying and this won't change
without causing incompatibility issues.</p>
<p>A lot of lateral discussions spawned from
the thread. For example, I have been taught
about perl on Windows by Ivan Tubert-Brohman,
Rafael (and <code>perlrun</code>), Abigail and Yves Orton.
The summary is</p>
<pre>
    perl &quot;-MFoo 1&quot;  -e 1     (ok, Ivan)
    perl &quot;-MFoo\ 1&quot; -e 1     (doh, I tried this as if Windows knew about escapes)
    perl -M&quot;Foo 1&quot;  -e 1     (ok, Rafael and adapted perlrun)
    perl -M'Foo 1'  -e 1     (nope, it doesn't like single quotes)</pre>
<p>Another subthread grew from Graham Barr
mentioning <code>perl -MFoo\ 100</code> used
for perl saying which version of a module you have installed.
E.Merijn Brand thought the unpublished Abe's <code>V</code>
module did a better job. Randy W. Sims voted for
<code>Module::Info</code> for the task. Yitzchak and
John Peacock argued about the pros and cons
of</p>
<pre>
  perl -MModule -le 'print Module::-&gt;VERSION'`
  perl -MModule -le 'print $Module::VERSION'`</pre>

<h2>Perl on EBCDIC Platforms</h2>
</p><p> <strong>tr// and Character Ranges</strong>
Sastry and Sadahiro Tomoyuki kept alive the thread
on issues with <code>tr//</code> on EBCDIC platforms,
by exchanging and analyzing test outputs.
To let go the failures, Sadahiro advises
skipping the failing tests could be the "best"
fix if one remembers <em>perlod.pod</em> clearly
mentions that character ranges are unportable
except for a few special cases.</p>
<pre>
    <a href="http://xrl.us/ht79">http://xrl.us/ht79</a> </pre>
<p> <strong>Fixing Unicode in EBCDIC</strong>
Sadahiro Tomoyuki detected some problems
in <em>utf.c</em> with handling Unicode on
EBCDIC platforms and posted patches
to fix it. Jarkko Hietaniemi thanked
Sadahiro for the excellent work and
prompted him for preparing a final set of
patches to enter 5.9.x and then 5.8.x.
Sadahiro provided some answers and soon
we hope to have Perl Unicode working
just fine on EBCDIC.</p>

<h2>Shifting Bitvecs</h2>
</p><p>A long time ago, in bug #969, Steve Peters wondered why</p>
<pre>
    vec($b, 2, 8) &gt;&gt;= 2</pre>
<p>would not work as expected for bit vectors. Jarkko Hietaniemi
joined in to say it's a murky corner of Perl semantics,
having to do
with the all-things-scalar (string | number | bitvec | etc.) semantics.
The shift operator treats scalars as numbers,
and that's the default way of doing these things.
Steve Peters returned this week to figure out
what should results look like if shifting bitvecs
worked allright. Jarkko replied and glanced
at a hypothetical new pragma <code>bitvec</code> under
which bitvec operations just work as they should.
Yitzchak Scott-Thoennes
elaborated further with a bunch of generalizations
and extensions.</p>

<h2>Meanwhile in <em>maint</em> </h2>
</p><p>There is much happening with <em>maint</em>, which is
being prepared for the 5.8.8 release candidate in this October.
Nicholas Clark, the pumpkin, declared open
the season on warning fixing patches. But do not
mess with <em>embed.fnc</em>, as he advised:
"Don't change the prototype of any non-static function
in [there]."</p>
<pre>
    <a href="http://xrl.us/ht8c">http://xrl.us/ht8c</a> </pre>
<p>The two following threads directly concern <em>maint</em>.</p>
<p> <strong> <code>NN/NULLOK</code> in <em>embed.fnc</em> </strong>
Andy Lester proclaimed to send the last of his patches
to <em>embed.fnc</em>. Now every pointer argument must be
specified either as <code>NN</code> if it can't be null or <code>NULLOK</code>.
Newer GCCs will catch it. Answering Nicholas Clark about
his next moves, Andy said he will have much to do
now he's in charge of PR for the Perl Foundation
and there is also MANY warnings on core macros he wants
to look at.</p>

<p> <strong>Where Devel Goes</strong>
Last week, Yitzchak Scott-Thoennes was bitten by
installing a snapshot release of maint over a 5.8.7
installation, which triggered a discussion on when/how
to make the version bump to prevent such things.</p>
<p>Nicholas Clark wondered if a different solution
could work out: to change where the libraries are installed/loaded
from. His first proposal was to install 5.8.7+maint to
5.8.8, to prevent something to be overwritten.
The solution made Andrew Dougherty uneasy with the possibility
of a forgotten broken 5.8.7 snapshot lurking around as 5.8.8.
Andrew suggested something like 5.8.7-MAINT23456, which
was immediately followed by Stas Bekman which hinted
it could be called 5.8.8-dev just like it is done with Apache.
Yitzchak said it could be done by just setting the
version variable to this, with the possibility to override
the behavior via <em>Configure -Dversion=</em>. Stas said it
was ok too and this is waiting for some decision.</p>

<h2>EuroOSCON</h2>
</p><p>Nathan Torkington wrote to say he had some passes for EuroOSCON
and was determined to hand them to whoever people on list decide.
EuroOSCON is the first European O'Reilly conference with no
p5p party planned, but with a promising Maker Faire (open to all).
Some people nominated his favourites. Some favourites
declined for the most various reasons. I bet Nathan thought
it would be easier.</p>

<h2>Can't locate when too many open files</h2>
</p><p>Steve Peters proposed a real fix, instead of a workaround,
to the problem of perl
reporting <code>&quot;Can't locate ... in @INC&quot;</code> when the maximum
number of open filehandles is reached. He asked
for feedback on the patch and Nicholas Clark came
to say it would better to produce a message like</p>
<pre>
   Can't locate Carp.pm - Too many open files.</pre>
<p>After a few days, Steve committed to blead a patch
to do just this.</p>

<h2>Wrong Line Numbers in Warnings</h2>
</p><p>In bug #37302, "ludeman" reopened the can of worms related
to warnings reporting the wrong line number.
Yitzchak and Paul Johnson explained how it has to
do with the compiled form of the code, that
does not store this information, using the nearest one
which does. Rafael Garcia-Suarez reported it can't
be done without adding such data to <code>OP_SCOPE</code> and
making the core deal with it everywhere, which
is likely to cause performance decreases.
Steven Schubiger and David Landgren wondered how the warning
message could be improved, but Dave Mitchell
said that, without some special-case code, the best
that can be done is to report a description of the
operator currently being executed.</p>

<h2>Case-Folding on Turkish Characters</h2>
</p><p>Someone (via RT's guest account)
asked about updates on the issue of ticket #36953:
a problem on converting between lower
and uppercase on Turkish characters. Dominic Dunlop
pointed how the desired conversion was problematic and mentioned
some references. The behavior is probably due to Perl relying
on the locale of the system which does not do the full case-folding
as the ticket requestor wants to. Some ways to remedy this:
(1) Find a locale which does what you want, (2)
Let Perl do full case folding and fix up special cases
with regex substitutions.</p>

<h2>Deprecated <code>my $v if 0</code> </h2>
</p><p>Oh my! Dean Herington opens yet another RT ticket, #37315, on
<code>my $v if 0</code>. Charles E. DeRykus pointed that the use
of this idiom had been deprecated and posted the link
to the thread of two weeks before. Steven Schubiger
pointed to a five-years-old summary
of the "feature" by Mark-Jason Dominus and the corresponding
thread on p5p.</p>

Parrot is a virtual machine aimed at running Perl6 and other dynamic
languages, but you already knew that.</p>

<h2>In Brief</h2>
</p><p> <strong> <code>cmp_ok</code> Changes Made Visible </strong>
Michael Schwern has welcome some "uninitialized value" warnings
imputable to the new <code>Test::More</code> behavior
of <code>cmp_ok()</code> to not supress warnings. This was
a Good Thing helping out to spot problems, like these for
which Michael provided a patch.</p>

<p> <strong>Issues with rt.perl.org</strong>
Philip M. Golluci reported
not being able to file new tickets on <code>rt.perl.org</code>. But Steve Peters and Robert
Spier explained new tickets can't be open via the web interface.
They should be created via the perlbug tool or sending an email
detailing the bug to <a href="mailto:perlbug@perl.org.">perlbug@perl.org.</a> </p>

<p> <strong> Revert Consting for Tk's Sake </strong>
Jan Dubois argues that the consting of <code>mark</code> in <code>dAXMARK</code>

<code>printf</code> doesn't interface well with perl's
way of using whatever kind of storage fits best.</p>

<p> <strong> Setting up Nightly Builds </strong>
Kean Johnston was interested in setting up
a nightly build of Perl and several CPAN modules.
He asked how it could be done using the non-installed
perl installation rather than the one used in the
build system.</p>
<p>That angry sympathetic man, Michael Schwern,
gave some instructions on how he could do it.
In short, read teh MakeMaker docs. After a while,
Kean came back after not groking what MakeMaker docs says
and disatisfied about a bad warning of the build process.
Yitzchak Scott-Thoennes suggested the use of the <code>-Dversiononly</code>
configure flag. Michael taught to just
set <code>PERL_SRC</code> to the location of the Perl source directory and
let MakeMaker take care of the rest.</p>
<pre>

<p> <strong> Magic Open of <code>ARGV</code> </strong>
Bug #2783 started with the report that the magic
in opening <code>ARGV</code> could be dangerous. File names like
<em>"| rm -rf *;"</em> could do evil things. Steve Peters
revived the ticket with the hope that the flaw
had been fixed, while Ton Hospel, one of the requestors,
said it was not the case. Adriano Ferreira
believed the documentation in <code>perldoc -f open</code>
and <code>perldoc perlopentut</code> was quite sufficient.
<code>ARGV</code> should be
preprocessed if one doesn't trust his users
and Ronald Kimball remembers safety with <code>-e</code> options
could be enforced by using <code>--</code> before user arguments.
The ticket and discussion remains open.</p>

<p> <strong>Yitzchak's Notes</strong>
Yitzchak Scott-Thoennes called for two additions to the last summaries.
With respect to the thread on list slice subscripting,
his intention was to say that people writing non-backwards-compatible
code was no reason at all to keep the feature out of blead.
To be true, he did not think it was not good enough
to keep it out of maint and asks Nicholas Clark
"Can this go in?"</p>
<pre>
    <a href="http://xrl.us/ht8w">http://xrl.us/ht8w</a> </pre>
<p>When Yitzchak pinged the list about a patch to silence
some warnings in blead, it was less to apply it and more
to get some response from anybody. This time,
Dave Mitchell answered that it seemed correct
to him, with a minor glitch he patched.</p>

<p> <strong> <code>chop</code> and <code>chomp</code> Prototypes? </strong>
In bug #37276, Michael Schwern asked where had <code>chop</code> and <code>chomp</code>
prototype gone?</p>
<pre>
  $ perl -wle 'print prototype &quot;CORE::chop&quot;'
  Use of uninitialized value in print at -e line 1.</pre>
<p>Easy answer by Rafael Garcia-Suarez: in <em>perl58delta</em> we read
event though <code>chomp()</code> and <code>chop()</code> are overridable, their
prototype however are undefined.
"Not a fixable bug, unless we change the way <code>chop()</code> is parsed, which
would lead to backward compatibility nightmares."</p>

<p> <strong> <em>perl -u</em> is for Dumping </strong>
David Boyce reports on bug #37300 that "perl -Vue1" dumps core.
Steve Peters says it really does because <code>-u</code> is an obsolete
switch to, well, dump core after compiling.</p>

<p> <strong> <code>-DT -e 'use warnings;'</code> Crashes </strong>
Dave Mitchell came back after studying changes he made
which caused <code>-DT -e 'use warnings;'</code> to go bang.
He actually solved the issue improving the debugging
output. Hurray for Dave!</p>
