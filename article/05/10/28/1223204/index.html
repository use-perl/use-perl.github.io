<p><a href="mailto:osdc-help@osdc.com.au">jarich</a> writes <i>"Registrations for Australia&#8217;s second Open Source Developers&#8217; Conference are now open. Last year&#8217;s conference was a huge hit with 60 high quality talks running in three streams over three days. If you were not able to join us last year make sure you don&#8217;t miss out this year! The conference is running from Monday 5th &#8211; Wednesday 7th December 2005. If you <a href="http://www.osdc.com.au/registration/index.html">register</a> before Sunday 30th October you will receive a conference t-shirt and a $50 discount."</i></p>
<p><p>OSDC is a grass roots, YAPC-style conference designed by developers for developers, covering open source languages, tools, libraries, operating systems, licences and business models. We&#8217;re booking 3 lecture rooms each day for the 3 days to hold a new set 60 different talks.</p>

<p>Talks topics range from the safety of Perl&#8217;s Safe.pm, to rapid game development in Python, to using PHP for unorthodox applications, to utilizing Java&#8217;s Groovy in your next application. We also have talks on conference skills, database integration, digital forensics, Gumstix and Nagios. You can find the full list of speakers and talk titles at <a href="http://osdc2005.cgpublisher.com/session_descriptions.html">http://osdc2005.cgpublisher.com/session_descriptions.html</a>.</p>

<p>Because there are so many good talks, you can be certain that there will be something that interests you in every talk session. Each day will start with a keynote by our excellent keynote speakers. These include Damian Conway, Jonathan Oxer, Richard Farnsworth (from the Australian Synchrotron) and Anthony Baxter. The rest of the day will be filled with up to 5 hours of talks and plentiful food breaks. Our catering choices should result in you being extraordinarily well fed throughout the days of the conference.</p>

<p>There will also be several BOFs (yet to be organised), lots of opportunities to socialise, a semi-formal dinner, a partners&#8217; programme and other usual conference stuff.</p>

<p>If you have any other questions about what is happening, please don&#8217;t hesitate to ask: osdc-help@osdc.com.au</p></p>
