<p>During the Perl Lightning talks at EuroOSCON I presented some early results from the 2005 Perl Mongers Census. There will be more details appearing at some point soon, but in the meantime I've made <a href="http://pm.org/census.pdf">my slides</a> available for download.</p>

<h2>Spanish/Portuguese ?</h2>

Just curious, what was the comment/joke about learning Spanish/Portuguese about?

IIRC, I think it had something to do with a lot of PM groups in Portugal and Brazil (6 + 11, making these rank in 5th and 3rd), but I don't recall the Spanish thing.<br><br>Also, out of the six most active mailing lists, three are in Brazil.<br><br>Plus, out of the three most frequented technical meetings, two are in Brazil.<br><br>Just check out the slides<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

Yes, my curiosity is more about the Spanish bit.

Er... that was me having a brain glitch and forgetting that they speak Portuguese in Brazil and not Spanish. Sorry about that<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-/<br>

<h2>duplicate membership</h2>

many mongers are on multiple lists (i am on 4) so subscriber counts aren't a good way to measure group sizes. it might be fine for smaller groups or ones which are more isolated but i am sure london.pm's size is due to many outsiders on its list.<br><br>but this is an interesting exercise anyway, regardless of its serious statistical flaws.<br><br>uri

<i>statistical flaws</i>

<p>That was mentioned in the talk, actually<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>

<blockquote> <div><i> many mongers are on multiple lists</i></div> </blockquote>

<p>In the talk that accompanied the slides I estimated that up to 25% of the 8,300 mailing list subscriptions might be taken up by David Adler being subscribed to every PM mailing list<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<p>Which got the desired laugh, but also made the point that this stats are pretty close to being meaningless. I'm on about a dozen PM group mailing lists.</p>

being the uber-fearless leader of all of perl mongers, i would expect you to be on every single pm list!<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br><br>and i am glad you mentioned my point in the talk. i just didn't see it on the slides.<br><br>uri
