<div class="span8">
<p>This week had seen the development of the responses of Perl community
to the Webmin security hole, with the usual assortment of activity
on many other fronts in the advancement of the Perl interpreter.
<code>Pod::Simple</code> integration, issues in newer Windows, better OpenVMS
support illustrate the discussion diversity.</p>
<p><h2> <a name="sprintf_patches">sprintf patches</a> </h2>
<p>This week, the responses around the security breach found on Webmin
had been dominated by patching the culprits, namely, <code>Sys::Syslog</code>
and the Perl domestic implementation of <code>sprintf</code>.
Nicholas presented the bundle of prepared sprintf patches
to 5.8.x and triggered a rather impressive cooperation to
test them in the most varied architectures Perl runs in.
Lots of people in Perl community reported on the (fortunately
successful) outcomes of the fixes.
Some tricks were needed (like using context rather than
unified diffs) to get the maximum portability but it was
worthy.</p>

<h2> <a name="sys__syslog_fixes"> <code>Sys::Syslog</code> Fixes</a> </h2>
</p> <p>Upon requests, S&#233;bastien Aperghis-Tramoni prepared a CPAN
release of <code>Sys::Syslog</code> which is now dual-lived. The
release 0.09 sprouted from blead@26281 (with the corresponding
last week's fixes) and a few tweaks.
To be honest, 0.10 is already there for public
comsumption (in CPAN, <em>blead</em> and maybe <em>maint</em>).</p>

<h2> <a name="still_vulnerable">Still vulnerable?</a> </h2>
</p> <p>Brendan O'Dea essayed an answer to a bug report on Debian
for the one-liner below, which suggested another security risk.
To Steve Langaseek, even though it was not a buffer overflow,
but a probable read of "uninitialized" locations in memory,
it does not exclude the possibility of an exploit, as had already
been done for C programs. Gisle Aas acknowledged <code>&quot;%vs&quot;</code>
did strange things, as well as <code>&quot;%vc&quot;</code>, <code>&quot;%vn&quot;</code>, <code>&quot;%v%&quot;</code> and
fixed them all with change #26321.</p>

<h2> <a name="improving_cwd_pm">Improving <em>Cwd.pm</em> </a> </h2>
</p> <p>The thread started in the previous week on <em>Cwd.pm</em> continued this week.
Nick Ing-Simmons seconded Ken William's proposal to mess with <code>getcwd()</code>
for performance/enhancement purposes. Nicholas Clark asked
about the behavior of current Perl implementation of <code>getcwd</code>: a directory
can be changed in a way that can't be recovered (unlike determined by POSIX)?
Ken thought it could be done more safely, but the risk exists actually.
Ken announced a new beta of <code>PathTools</code> to CPAN, where the scan of <code>$ENV{PATH}</code>
that started this thread was "fixed", <code>Cwd::getcwd</code> maps to the underlying
C <code>getcwd()</code> when possible, besides contributions by John E. Malmberg and
Bryan Daimler. Ken awaits for comments and test reports towards a non-beta
release.</p>

<h2> <a name="takeuchi_benchmark">Takeuchi Benchmark</a> </h2>
</p> <p>Recai Oktas posted his concerns about a bad performance
shown by Perl 5.8.7 running the Takeuchi benchmark test:
too much memory and slow to a crawl. Dave Mitchell rewrote the
code in a perl55 rather than perl4 style, cutting down
execution time and memory usage. Rekai felt more confident,
seeing an improvement from ~23 s to &lt; 1 s and asked
if Dave's version should replace the code in the
"Computer Language Shootout". chromatic reminded <code>use Memoize</code>
could make it even faster at the expense of memory, but
that's not a fair technique for the benchmark purposes.</p>

<h2> <a name="crosscompilation_with_uclibc">Cross-compilation with uClibc</a> </h2>
</p> <p>Philippe Ney had been trying to cross-compile Perl with
an eye for using <strong>uClibc</strong>, a C library for developing
embedded Linux systems, and <strong>buildroot</strong>, a cross-compilation
toolkit for <code>uClibc</code>. In his way,
Philippe stumbled with some strangeness and asked for help.
Rafael Garcia-Suarez recommended the use of the same version of perl
on the host machine as on the target system, since Philippe
was using perl 5.8.4 as host for building a 5.8.7 target.
Vadim Konovalov explained that the <em>./configpm</em> script
generates <em>Config.pm</em> (possibly for another target system)
and, via <em>Config.pm</em> manipulations, a host <em>miniperl</em> produces
binaries for the target platform. This used to work only for WinCE
cross-compiling but had been worked out for general
cross-compiling. Vadim also advised on the differences
of <em>Config.pm</em> in 5.8.4 and 5.8.7 (where the later
uses a second file <em>Config_heavy.pl</em>).</p>

<h2> <a name="apc_relocated">APC Relocated</a> </h2>
</p> <p>Just to make sure you have heard about the relocation of the Archive
of Perl Changes (APC) by Philippe "gozer" Chiasson, let me repeat the
URLs below.</p>
<pre>
    rsync://public.activestate.com/
    <a href="http://public.activestate.com/pub/apc/">http://public.activestate.com/pub/apc/</a>
    <a href="ftp://public.activestate.com/pub/apc/">ftp://public.activestate.com/pub/apc/</a> </pre>
<p>In the thread "-Duse64bitint on HP-UX", Jan Dubois reminded APC now also has
the feature to fetch a tarball instead of all the files individually
(which can speed FTP access). Jan also thought a symlink to the latest snapshot
could be a good idea so that smoke code doesn't have to parse
the directory listing. Yitzchak Scott-Thoennes suggested that <em>.bz2</em> files
would also be a good addition. Philippe did both of them.</p>
<pre>
    You find snapshots here
    <a href="http://public.activestate.com/pub/apc/perl-current-snap/">http://public.activestate.com/pub/apc/perl-current-snap/</a>

<h2> <a name="duse64bitint_on_hpux"> <code>-Duse64bitint</code> on HP-UX</a> </h2>
</p> <p>Jan Dubois found a little odd that H.Merijn Brand had stated that
HP-UX does allow only 32/32 or 64/64 for int/pointer sizes.
Jan was used to build Perl 5.8.7 with <code>-Duse64bitint</code> on HP-UX 11.00
PA-RISC successfully. H.Merijn Brand explained <code>-Duse64bitint</code>
is automatically promoted to <code>-Duse64bitall</code> so that you always
end with 64bit ints and pointers.</p>
<pre>
    <a href="http://xrl.us/i7zy">http://xrl.us/i7zy</a> </pre>
<p>While Merijn gave some touches to make the documentation more precise,
Jan made some suggestions and asked why the HP-UX code/docs were so
focused on PA-RISC and what to expect on IA64.
Merijn explained this is due to the fact that most of the contributions
was based on his use of those systems, and his limited access to Itanium.
Spider Boardman volunteered to do some smoke with rx2600 machines -
being concerned about the smoke interface not playing with firewalls
that refuse rsync. Merijn pointed that ftp should work and Jan introduced
the new features of APC (mentioned in the APC section above).</p>
<p>
<h2> <a name="what_andy_lester_did_this_week">What Andy Lester Did This Week</a> </h2>
</p> <p>The tireless Andy Lester brought a new patch of consting
plus some stuff to <em>embed.fnc</em> and a couple of minor fixes.
Vadim Konovalov had a small doubt about
some of Andy's updates and Andy assured him that everything
was fine. Contamplating Andy's work, Jim Cromie noticed
what he thought was <strong>the way</strong>
to share small bits of interface between core parts and
asked about ideas for him to complete his work on arenas.
Rafael applied Andy's patches and Jim's questions went on unanswered.</p>
<pre>
    <a href="http://xrl.us/i7zz">http://xrl.us/i7zz</a> </pre>
<p>Andy ruled that arguments of function in <em>embed.fnc</em> were a
good idea, cleaned it up and added a check to ensure this in the future.
He then noticed some pad funcs, which weren't called when DEBUGGING
was off, were still getting compiled and changed that.
And asked for some attention to make sure a few code changes he did
wasn't on crack. Steve Peters reconciled Andy's patch with some recent
changes and applied the changes.</p>
<pre>
    We need names
    <a href="http://xrl.us/i7z2">http://xrl.us/i7z2</a>

<p>
<h2> <a name="stringification_of_vstring_references">stringification of v-string references</a> </h2>
</p> <p>Nicholas Clark noticed how v-strings were given different
treatment on stringification of references.</p>
<pre>
    $ ./perl -Ilib -le 'print $_, &quot; &quot;, ref $_ foreach \v1, \\v1, \@a, *STDOUT{IO}, qr/a/'
    SCALAR(0x8145f00) VSTRING
    REF(0x8145f30) REF
    ARRAY(0x8145f70) ARRAY
    IO::Handle=IO(0x8145b60) IO::Handle
    (?-xism:a) Regexp</pre>
<p>All other references stringify their name given by <code>sv_reftype</code>.
Nicholas asked if that was an intentional change and John
Peacock told the story about how v-strings prior to 5.8.1
were evil and how the changes Nicholas found made v-strings
into objects which act like scalars with a bit of magic inside.
John then prepared a patch so that v-strings references now
stringify according to the convention of everything else
in Perl. Nicholas had already a patch to do this,
besides some rearrangement and tidying up for a couple of things.</p>
<pre>
    $ ./perl -Ilib -le 'print $_, &quot; &quot;, ref $_ foreach \v1'
    VSTRING(0x8145f00) VSTRING</pre>

<h2> <a name="podlators_2_00"> <code>podlators</code> 2.00</a> </h2>
</p> <p>Russ Albery announced a new major release of <code>podlators</code>, 2.00, which
uses <code>Pod::Simple</code> rather than <code>Pod::Parser</code>.
Steve Peters added it to the core together with <code>Pod::Simple</code> itself
and <code>Pod::Escapes</code>. Steve observed that the new <code>Pod::Text</code> broke
<code>Pod::Usage</code> and Russ Albery remembered to have submitted a patch to fix that a while ago.
Steve applied Russ's patch to <code>Pod::Usage</code>, even though things do not look perfect yet.</p>
<pre>
    <a href="http://xrl.us/i7z6">http://xrl.us/i7z6</a> </pre>
<p>
<h2> <a name="pod__simple_integration"> <code>Pod::Simple</code> Integration</a> </h2>
</p> <p>During <code>Pod::Simple</code> integration, Andreas Koenig noticed some issues with files from
<code>Pod-Simple</code> distribution, worked out with Steve Peters.
Craig Berry also found that <code>Pod::Simple</code> brought into the core directories
with names like <em>lib/Pod/Simple/t/other^test^lib</em> which do not play
well with the recommendations on filenames on <em>perlport.pod</em> and which cause
trouble on VMS systems. Yves Orton pointed these caused some annoyances
in Win32 as well. Yitzchak Scott-Thoennes reminded <em>Porting/check83.pl</em>
checks for filenames portable enough to go in the
perl distribution and showed the list of guilty parts where the script actually complains.
I bet we'll see it fixed by the next week. Oops, next week is here
and these are not issues anymore - but I am anticipating.</p>

<h2> <a name="alarm___on_windows_2003_and_vista"> <code>alarm()</code> on Windows 2003 and Vista</a> </h2>
</p> <p>Jan Dubois noticed that the <code>alarm()</code> function isn't working
on newer Windows (Windows 2003 64-bit and Windows Vista Beta 1 32-bit)
and pointed the change in <em>win32/win32.c</em> that did the feat
and opened it up for discussion. Nick Ing-Simmons, which wrote
the original code and the change, entered the thread
and he and Jan talked a lot about Windows programming
tricks with events, while searching the simplest solution
which fixed the problem without adding others.
Nick even digged up a forgotten suggestion to change
the code in question, which did not turn up to be a solution
to the original problem. Jan envisioned an attempt to mix
one of the Nick's ideas with some modifications to cope with additional
complications, some Windows 2000 features and some nice
improvements to current Perl handling of Windows message queue.</p>

<h2> <a name="switch">switch</a> </h2>
</p> <p>Robin Houston had been quite busy this week
advancing his idea on bringing the Perl 6 <code>switch</code>
into Perl 5. He demonstrated how it was added with
a new syntax enabled by
a lexically-scoped pragma "use feature". Paul Johnson,
David Nicol and Damian Conway contributed with comments.
Maybe soon we'll see Robin's addition to standard Perl
which is indeed a general mechanism for extending syntax
and semantics of Perl programs.</p>

<h2> <a name="what_john_e__malmberg_did_this_week">What John E. Malmberg Did This Week</a> </h2>
</p> <p> <strong> Patching <em>lib/File/Spec/VMS.pm</em> </strong>
John E. Malmberg went on with his work on the VMS front, paving the
way for a more capable Perl on newer OpenVMS systems.
John brought a patch to <em>lib/File/Spec/VMS.pm</em>
to fix bugs in <code>abs2rel()</code> and <code>canonpath()</code> when handling
the exquisite VMS paths like <code>'[t1.t2.t3]file'</code>.
John remembered there is a lot to do yet for handling
the OpenVMS file specifications. Ken Williams applied the
patch and prodded John for tests to exercise the dead bugs.
John noticed the tests were already included by someone else,
which forced him to propose these fixes so that tests succeed
again and let him go on with dealing with a bunch of unresolved issues
with VAX legacy, support for Unix formats and ODS-5 features,
and other scary things.</p>
<pre>
    <a href="http://xrl.us/i72b">http://xrl.us/i72b</a> </pre>
<p> <strong>Commands with Embedded New Lines</strong>
John questioned if there was a reason to truncate
commands with embedded new lines (as done in <em>vms/vms.c</em>) and pointed
that some tests on VMS succeed or improve if truncation is not done.
OpenVMS will pass all non-null binary data though to the program
without DCL interpreter processing.
To Craig A. Berry, it looks probable that older versions of DCL
would choke on newlines.</p>
<pre>
    <a href="http://xrl.us/i72c">http://xrl.us/i72c</a> </pre>
<p> <strong>Towards Long Filenames</strong>
John announced a code shakeup to remove the characteristic
limitation of VMS filenames to 256 characters. Craig Berry
listened, applied the changes and suggested some of the next actions
towards the complete handling of long filenames on VMS</p>

<h2> <a name="in_brief">In Brief</a> </h2>
</p> <p> <strong>A While Back in the Last Summary</strong>
there was a confusion about the <code>%m</code>
format (which <code>Sys::Syslog::syslog()</code> replaces with the contents of <code>$!</code>)
and <code>%n</code> (a special conversion of Perl <code>sprintf</code>),
spotted by Ronald J. Kimball. Please consider it patched, <code>s/%n/%m/g</code>.</p>

<p> <strong>False Matches with Bad utf-8</strong>
Ralph Bolton opened RT ticket #37836 to tell about a very simple
regex run on specific data causing a SEGV. Dave Mitchell
immediately trimmed down the problem to the piece of code below.</p>
<pre>
    my $s = &quot;\xa2\xf8&quot;;
    open F, &quot;&lt;:utf8&quot;, \$s;
    while(&lt;F&gt;) {
        s/[\000]+//g;       # Causes a SEGV
    }</pre>
<p>Nicholas Clark found that feeding in
malformed uft8 was producing a bad length of -1 on a call to
<code>memmove</code>.
Sadahiro Tomoyuki observed <em>regexec.c</em> (falsely) matched <code>[\000]</code>
with malformed utf-8 and proposed a tiny patch to fix that, which was
applied and the ticket closed.</p>

<p> <strong>Bye to Autovivification Bug</strong>
Steve Peters revisited RT ticket #8409 about an autovivification bug
that made some expressions to succeed when errors like
"Modification of a read-only value attempted" should be expected.
Steve confirmed all of the reported troublesome expressions
produce consistent errors since 5.8.6.</p>

<p> <strong> <code>$Data::Dumper::Sortkeys</code> <em>d&#233;j&#224; vu</em> </strong>
Jerry Hebert rediscovered the trouble with <code>Data::Dumper::Sortkeys</code>
causing <code>each()</code> failures which was already fixed in 5.8.8
codebase (change #25308) as reported by Paul Johnson and Yitzchak Scott-Thoennes.
Yitzchak also pointed the current workaround of using a void-context <code>keys %hash</code>
after dumping.</p>

<p> <strong>the 'syntax error during sub, use or no' problem</strong>
In bug #37864, Brian Hirt showed up a syntax error that
causes perl to crash. Paul Johnson pointed the issue was
already fixed in bleadperl (since 5.9.2), and Dave Mitchell
identified the bug as an instance of the standard
'syntax error during sub, use or no' problem,
which required a fix in bleed too complex to be comfortably packported
to 5.8.x.</p>

<p> <strong>Improving <em>ithreads</em> clone time</strong>
Nicholas Clark noticed ithreads clone time is less than
desirable. The clone code uses a custom hash table to keep
track of copied parts and it seems the used hash
function is lousy. So Nicholas proposed the task to
find a better one and immediately did the first experiment
with the regular perl hash function, posting stats
and patches for others to try out.</p>

Gisle Aas reported a failure on Windows XP when testing
the behavior of <code>timelocal</code> as the reverse of <code>localtime</code>
on a certain time zone and summer time adjustment.
Steve Hay had something to add to the corresponding CPAN
ticket #12068 (<code>libwww-perl</code>) and Dave Rolsky noticed the problem
can reproduced on Linux boxes as well. Dave also detected
the problematic code in <code>Time::Local</code>, posted a fix
that worked for Gisle and a new release of <code>Time::Local</code>
should be released in no time.</p>

<p> <strong> <code>Term::ReadKey</code>, Solaris, gcc </strong>
Jonathan Stowe, author of <code>Term::ReadKey</code>, forwarded to the list
a CPAN RT ticket where a user complained about trouble building
<code>Term::ReadKey</code> on Solaris 10. Jonathan explained <code>Term::ReadKey</code>
would not work unless the module has access to the same shared
C runtime library objects as Perl do, a problem common to all modules
with XS components. Yitzchak Scott-Thoennes remembered that building
add-on modules for perl shipped with Solaris requires
the CPAN modules <code>Solaris::PerlGcc</code>.</p>

Jim Shi opened RT ticket #37855 to tell about what he thought to be
an odd behavior from a simple Perl script and was taught
by Ronald J. Kimball, Paul Johnson and chromatic to always

and to not abuse prototypes and <code>&amp;</code> sigils when none
is necessary.</p>
