<h1>This Week on perl5-porters - 21-27 November 2005</h1>

<div class="span8">
<p>A quiet week with a bit of action at many corners of Perl development,
including some shiny new ones like Lamp. Improvement to docs and
threads on <code>Switch</code>, <code>Module::Build</code> modules are among
the discussion themes.</p>
<p><h2> <a name="no_brute_force_anymore">No Brute Force Anymore</a> </h2>
<p>The last summary mentioned bug #37710 about a failed <code>require</code>
succeeding in a second time. Rafael Garcia-Suarez pointed this
is fixed in bleadperl and
Yitzchak Scott-Thoennes noticed the bug goes back
to 5.6.1 through current maint.
Rick Delaney entered the discussion to say the fix never made into maint
because of the introduction of the new semantic that
an <code>undef</code> value for an entry in <code>%INC</code> means the module failed to compile.
Rick mumbled on the unfortunate passing of the
corresponding change to <code>L&lt;perlfunc/require&gt;</code>
which actually shows implementation details in blead but not in 5.8.</p>
<pre>
    <a href="http://xrl.us/izox">http://xrl.us/izox</a> </pre>
<p>
<h2> <a name="save_safe_pm">Save <em>Safe.pm</em> </a> </h2>
</p> <p>Andreas Koenig opened RT ticket #37713 to warn about <em>Safe.pm</em>,
which fails miserably with modules like <code>POSIX</code>, <code>version</code>, and others.
Even when no opcode restriction is made, examples like the one below
fails with blead and even worse with 5.8.7.</p>
<pre>
    perl -le '
     use Safe;
     use Opcode;
     my $comp = Safe-&gt;new;
     my $opset = Opcode::full_opset;
     $comp-&gt;permit($opset);
     $comp-&gt;reval(&quot;use version; \$VERSION = qv(q{1.0.3}); print \$VERSION&quot;);
     print $@ if $@;
     '
    Undefined subroutine &amp;version::qv called at (eval 2) line 1.</pre>
<p>Yves Orton remembered Tim Bunce declared <code>Safe.pm</code> to be a failed experiment and
wondered which is the current status of the module now that Raphael owns it.
Rafael answered he continues to fix things, backport the changes to CPAN
and thought this issue should be fixed.</p>

<h2> <a name="linked_list_of_arenas">Linked List of Arenas</a> </h2>
</p> <p>Jim Cromie came back this week to polish its previous RFC patch
based on Nicholas Clark's feedback. Jim concentrated on the
idea of having arena-size per sv-type and included comments/docs
for posterity, say, posterior maintenance. Later, Nicholas
Clark pointed some confusion in the patch and kept waiting
for Jim's answers.</p>

<p>
<h2> <a name="pod__perldoc_and_localized_docs"> <code>Pod::Perldoc</code> and Localized Docs</a> </h2>
</p> <p>Enrico Sorcinelli, one of the authors of <code>POD2::IT</code>, a project
to translate Perl man pages into Italian, proposed again
a patch against <code>Pod::Perldoc</code> to support viewing translated pods.
Rafael Garcia-Suarez applied to bleadperl the patch.
Enrico noticed <code>POD2::FR</code> just started, Portuguese fellows announced
<code>POD2::PT</code> shortly, and there is also a little <code>POD2::LT</code> for Lithuanian.
This may become a trend.</p>
<pre>
    <a href="http://xrl.us/izo3">http://xrl.us/izo3</a> </pre>
<p>
<h2> <a name="documentation_conventions">Documentation Conventions</a> </h2>
</p> <p>S&#233;bastien Aperghis-Tramoni triggered a discussion asking about the convenience
of a patch to POD files setting up a consistent pattern in the formatting
of functions, modules, variables, and others. Andy Lester suggested
S&#233;bastien to have a go, see the reaction and go from there.
Rafael Garcia-Suarez and others remembered it could be a good idea taking into
account the differences in rendering
in POD formatters, since <em>pod2text</em> (via <em>perldoc</em>), <em>pod2html</em> to
the custom formatters in sites like search.cpan.org and perldoc.perl.org.
After a suggestion by David Landgren, S&#233;bastien's patch
which touched <em>perlstyle.pod</em> adopted the use of <code>F&lt;&gt;</code> for
files, <code>C&lt;&gt;</code> for generally anything that can be considered part of
code and <code>B&lt;&gt;</code> for command names. I think it basically
sums up to being simple as POD already is, which doesn't preclude
POD formatters to be clever and improved.
The patch was applied after a few minor fixes.</p>

<p>
<h2> <a name="concat_misbehavior_with_magic"> <em>concat</em> Misbehavior with Magic</a> </h2>
</p> <p>Michele Dondi opened ticket #37722 to report how weird
can be the interaction of concat and magic in <code>tie()</code>d
variables. Robin Houston summed it up to the bit of code</p>
<pre>
      sub TIESCALAR { bless {} }
      sub FETCH { shift()-&gt;{i} ++ }
      tie $h, &quot;main&quot;;
      print $h.$h;</pre>
<p>which may output "00" rather than "01" and posted a patch.
Rafael Garcia-Suarez noticed the patch broke the warning test
case</p>
<pre>
    $ ./perl -we '$x.=$x'</pre>
<p>which should report a use of uninitialized value error.
On the grounds of a comment by Dave Mitchell on Michele's
finding, Rafael conceded the behavior was not really a bug
but the undefined result of execution order in expressions
involving side-effects. Robin Houston insisted it could
not be that difficult to fix, and tweaked the patch that
now provides a left-to-right order on evaluation of
subexpressions. The change has been applied as #26192.</p>

<h2> <a name="perl_on_lamp">Perl on Lamp</a> </h2>
</p> <p>Joshua Juran started a thread by posting some test results
from the starting Lamp port for perl 5.6.1. Nicholas Clark curiously
asked what led Joshua to elect 5.6.1 as a departing point
rather than 5.6.2 or even better 5.8.something. Joshua explained
he started working from Chris Nandor's MacPerl codebase,
which is at 5.6.1 and promised to leave 5.6 behind as soon
as he gets tests passing, approaching 5.8.x or blead.
Rafael Garcia-Suarez suggested that, by starting at 5.6.2,
Joshua's changes could be incorporated in this
or in MacPerl branch. Joshua pointed that Lamp, a project
for a Mac-hosted unix-like environment is similar in
spirit to Cygwin and will hopefully have more in common
with standard Perl than with MacPerl.</p>

<h2> <a name="win32_lean_and_mean">Win32 Lean and Mean</a> </h2>
</p> <p>Jan Dubois appreciated the analysis by Thomas Kratz (in ticket #37708)
about issues with socket-related declarations on Win32 whether
<em>winsock2.h</em> or <em>winsock.h</em> is included. The problem being that
Perl compiles using <code>winsock2.h</code> but <em>perl.h</em> includes <em>winsock.h</em>
leading to wrong winsock 1.1 constants and errors due to
redefined structs. Jan considered the best way to do it, avoiding
the breakage of existing modules, which may not need to know about
this and neither want it. H.Merijn Brand applied Jan's patch
as change #26189.</p>

<h2> <a name="module__build_issues_on_win32"> <code>Module::Build</code> Issues on Win32</a> </h2>
</p> <p>A long thread started with a RT report on problems building <code>PathTools</code>
on Win2K
which was forwarded by Ken Williams to the list. Yves Orton spotted
that it was a <code>Module::Build</code> thing, related to the fact
that you can't unlink a DLL that is loaded into the memory.
<code>ExtUtils::MakeMaker</code> works around the issue because
it does the install via make so it
doesn't need to load anything that it might be installing over.
Yves suggested <code>Module::Build</code> on Win32 should produce a <em>Build.bat</em>
rather than a <em>Build</em> perl script, which would allow a more
Unixy behavior. Yves, Ken and Randy Sims discussed some
issues involving what should force the user to rerun <code>Build.PL</code>
and, while on this, Randy produced a patch to <code>ExtUtils::CBuilder</code>
to fix an encountered issue. The original case was made to work
and more permanent solutions to <code>Module::Build</code> on Win32
should be near (besides the recommendation to use another OS).</p>

<h2> <a name="fast_unicode_with_swashget_in_xs">Fast Unicode with <code>SWASHGET</code> in XS</a> </h2>
</p> <p>This week, Sadahiro Tomoyuki thought it would be a good idea
to speedup the retrieval of Unicode properties and transliterations
mappings, which was done by the pure perl method SWASHGET.
He rewrote SWASHGET in XS, which was welcome and commented by
Dave Mitchell, Tels and Steve Peters. By the end of the week,
an improved patch was already commited to blead.</p>

<h2> <a name="bad_switch_boy">Bad <code>Switch</code> Boy</a> </h2>
</p> <p>Offer Kaye opened a can of worms when he did the simple question
of whether the bug #5607 in <code>Switch</code> had any chance to be fixed.
Ronald J. Kimball explained how
the issue of an unbalanced "/" causing a fatal error under
<code>use Switch</code> is due to the source filter nature of the module
and the small probability of a fix due to technical constraints.
David Landgren pointed Damian's module was always meant to
be an experiment and not for production purposes. There ensued
some discussion about the unpredictibility of source-filtered
modules, the requirements for a module to enter the core
and the possibilities of doing the opposite, removing a module from core.
Ah, and there were some advertisement on the DOR operator.</p>

<h2> <a name="upgrade_to_pathtools_3_14_in_maint">Upgrade to <code>PathTools</code> 3.14 in <em>maint</em> </a> </h2>
</p> <p>Ken Williams reflected with Nicholas Clark about the
alternatives to merge <code>PathTools</code> 3.14 to maint,
after the change that fixed <code>absrel($x, $x)</code> to
return <code>curdir()</code> and which is backwards incompatible
from the point of view of who risked to depend on
this buggy behavior.</p>

<p>
<h2> <a name="pipes___threads_broken_in_blead_on_vms">Pipes + Threads Broken in <em>blead</em> on VMS</a> </h2>
</p> <p>Craig Berry wrote to say how the simplest command line piping in
a threaded build of bleadperl on VMS now emits errors:</p>
<pre>
    $ perl  -e &quot;print 'ok';&quot; | exit
    panic: free from wrong pool.
    panic: free from wrong pool during global destruction.
    %C-F-EBADF, bad file number</pre>
<p>On VMS, command-line piping is implemented by Perl itself,
and such pipe is opened before any thread context has
been initialized.  The problem is a check to yelp when
deallocating from a different thread than the one which
did the allocation and the no context case actually
falls into this trap. To Rafael Garcia-Suarez, it looks
like this check should be bypassed, which can help also
applications that embed a perl interpreter.</p>

<h2> <a name="switch_in_the_core">Switch in the Core</a> </h2>
</p> <p>Robin Houston started an effort to implement
the <code>switch</code> construct in core (in manner which is
as-compatible-as-possible with <em>Switch.pm</em> by Damian Conway)
and called for feedback on his initial proposal, with
replies by Rafael Garcia-Suarez, Dave Mitchel, Nicholas
Clark and Damian Conway.</p>

<h2> <a name="in_brief">In Brief</a> </h2>
</p> <p> <strong>valgrind finding from blead</strong>
Following on Steve Peters trying to guess the source of
the leak in a sympathetic bit of code Jarkko Hietaniemi
posted, Jarkko delved into the gory combination that was
causing the problem: His latest conclusions point to
problems with the approach of determining whether <code>$`</code>, <code>$&amp;</code>,
<code>$'</code> were found , the corresponding <code>PL_sawampersand</code>
and the eluding problem of how we can foresee what eval
is going to do to us. With a bit more of investigation,
Jarkko is yet not convinced he really found the guilty part.</p>

<p> <strong>Fighting Compilers Again</strong>
Steve Hay reported how change #26152 ("All that can be in the first switch
statement ofsv_upgrade is now") broke the windows build using VC++ 6.
Steve and Nicholas Clark worked out a fixing change (concerning the use
of unary minus to unsigned types), which, despite Nicholas' hopes,
produces no errors but a bunch of warnings in VC++ 6, 7 and Borland.</p>

<p> <strong>Thread Failures due to Interleaved Output</strong>

on AIX (and others) caused by interleaved output.</p>

<p> <strong> <code>libnet</code> 1.19 on HP-UX on Perl 5.6.0 </strong>
Yves Orton reported how he has met with core dumps while building
<code>libnet</code> 1.19 on HP-UX on Perl 5.6.0 and asked for any
recommendations. H.Merijn Brand brought some clues and
made a lot of questions to help diagnosing the problem, which
basically pointed to the non-root status of Yves, missing
installed patches, and issues with trusted HP-UX systems,
the beginning of perl 5.6 and outdated software.</p>

<p> <strong> <code>GDBM_file</code> realloc failures </strong>
On a threads-enabled perl, Rafael Garcia-Suarez noticed the tests
<em>ext/GDBM_File/t/gdbm.t</em> and <em>lib/Memoize/t/tie_gdbm.t</em> were
failing with the message:</p>
<pre>
    panic: realloc from wrong pool</pre>
<p>Rafael proposed a patch which reconciled the trouble
due to memory alloc'd by <strong>libgdbm</strong> and realloc'd by perl.
It was applied as change #26193 to bleadperl.</p>

<p> <strong> Where is <code>Perl_do_open</code>? </strong>
Stas Bekman noticed blead @ 26185 broke mod_perl2 after a
problem to find out <code>Perl_do_open</code> function. Rafael Garcia-Suarez
explained <code>Perl_do_open</code> now lives in <em>mathoms.c</em> and the
<code>do_open</code> macro in <em>perl.h</em> is the way to go. Stas' issues
revealed a bug in that <code>Perl_do_open</code> should be visible anyway
unless <code>-DNO_MATHOMS</code> were used. Stas did it by dropping the
<code>Perl_</code> prefix on <code>do_open</code>/<code>do_close</code>.</p>
<pre>

<p> <strong> Can't reset <code>%ENV</code> on VMS </strong>
John Malmberg noticed <em>t/op/array.t</em> and <em>t/op/pat.t</em> failed
on VMS because the test scripts call <code>reset 'X'</code>, and
perl can not reset <code>%ENV</code> hash values on VMS.</p>

<p> <strong> Trouble with <code>for (reverse @array)</code> </strong>
Chris Duryee opened RT ticket #37725 to tell about
a segfault on a script using a <code>for (reverse @array)</code>
construction. Dave Mitchell found the bug to be due to
an optimization error to handle this very construction
and fixed the problem. After this, the one-liner</p>
<pre>
    perl -e '$a[3] = 1; $i = 3; for my $x (reverse @a) { $x = $i-- }; print &quot;@a&quot;'</pre>
<p>prints "0 1 2 3" instead of "1 0".</p>

<p> <strong> Sort subs <strong>can</strong> now be recursive </strong>

that sort subs may not be recursive, thanks to the
sort/multicall patch worked out in the last weeks.</p>

<p> <strong> Version Check Failures due to <code>locale</code> </strong>
In ticket #37714, "dakkar" showed how version checks can made
to fail when a locale is in effect due to conversions of float
to strings. John Peacock explained how it is happening in maint and
blead and will do some research to make version comparisons
independent of locales.</p>
<pre>
    <a href="http://xrl.us/izpr">http://xrl.us/izpr</a> </pre>
<p> <strong> VMS Issues with <code>__FILE__</code> assuming UNIX Pathnames </strong>
John E. Malmberg pointed <em>ext/List/Util/t/p_tainted.t</em> assumes
<code>__FILE__</code> returns a Unix pathname, which called for a fix on VMS.
On John's question about where <code>__FILE__</code> is set, Rafael Garcia-Suarez
disclosed the relevant points in code. There remained some uncertainty
about the adequacy of John's fix, which should be hammered by
the discussion among Rafael, John and Craig A. Berry.</p>

<p> <strong> <code>Tk</code> Compatibility </strong>
Gisle Aas pointed how <code>Tk</code> programs segfault when tried
with blead and wondered when it happened. Gisle also reminded
of changes needed to be applied for compiling and running
<code>Tk</code> in the perl-5.8.x branch.</p>

<p> <strong> Fast <code>IS_UTF8_CHAR()</code> for EBCDIC </strong>
A couple of weeks ago, it was noticed EBCDIC platforms UTF8
handling was broken, which Sadahiro Tomoyuki promptly fixed -
the guilty part was found to be on a change to speedup <code>IS_UTF8_CHAR</code>.
This week, Jarkko Hietaniemi tried to redeem himself with
a patch to bring the <code>IS_UTF8_CHAR()</code> speedup to (UTF-)EBCDIC
platforms and called for feedback from people which have
access to EBCDIC platforms.</p>
