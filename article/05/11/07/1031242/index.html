<div class="span8">
<p>This week sees consolidation on several fronts: mathoms, ops,
env handling, futimes, sort... plus the usual assortment of
bug fixes and enhancements.</p>
<p><h2> <a name="feedback_from_last_week_s_summary">Feedback from last week's summary</a> </h2><p>Steve Peters remembered the history of <em>mathoms.c</em> in p5p dated back
to 2001 and not only June/July this year, when it came to life again.
Also, the <em>Configure</em> option which was anticipated were not ready yet at
the summary time, but it is now.</p><p>

commented that he was referring to the Cygwin DLL source code and not perl
when illustrating how <code>unlink</code> in Cygwin mapped to the Windows API.</p><p>

</p><h2> <a name="more_on_extutils__constant">More on <code>ExtUtils::Constant</code> </a> </h2></p><p>chromatic raised an eyebrow at S&#233;bastien Aperghis-Tramoni's use
of indirect object notation (current best practices these days
dictating that one should say <code>Object-&gt;method</code> rather than
<code>method Object</code>. Nicholas Clark discovered that the patch causes
a bad failure in <code>blead</code> due to dependency orderings, because
somehow in <code>blead</code>, <code>FileHandle</code> now requires <code>IO::File</code> which
is not yet available during the build. Nicholas fixed it up by
with some conditional <code>require</code>ing in patch #25927.</p><p>

</p><h2> <a name="bring_out_yer_dead__ops_">Bring out yer dead (ops)</a> </h2></p><p>After running perl under <code>gcov</code>, Nicholas noticed that about twenty ops
were never hit by the test suite. It could be expected that an op like
<code>pp_dump</code> (which exists solely to make perl dump core) would not be
covered by the test suite, but maybe some ops should (which Dave Mitchell
said was the case for <code>pp_regcmaybe</code> and provided a snippet to prove it).</p><p>Maybe some are obsolete and could thus be chainsawed away. Rafael
Garcia-Suarez pointed out that a certain number of ops are required during
compilation, but are optimised away afterwards, and thus it would be a
non-trivial effort to truly get rid of them. Although he thought that
<code>pp_threadsv</code> and <code>pp_setstate</code> could probably be let go.</p><p>Rafael then noted that he had written some XS code in the past that
called some <code>pp_*</code> routines directly, and mentioned that he had published
a module on CPAN that lets you change the interpreter runloop on the fly.</p><p>This led Nicholas to think about the possibility of making the runloop
deal with the handling of signals differently. That is, getting rid of the
current <code>PERL_ASYNC_CHECK()</code> (<code>safe signals</code>) call in the runloop, and
merely switching to a runloop that knows how to deal with a signal, when
a signal is encountered.</p><p>

</p><h2> <a name="db_file_patched_to_deal_with_berkeley_db_4_4">DB_File patched to deal with Berkeley DB 4.4</a> </h2></p><p>Paul Marquess supplied a patch to get DB_File to run with the
upcoming 4.4 release of Berkeley DB. Steve Peters applied the patch
and Yitzchak wondered whether it was important enough to make sure
it made its way into 5.8.8.</p><p>

</p><h2> <a name="let_the_good_futimes_roll">Let the good futimes roll</a> </h2></p><p>Gisle Aas continued on the thread last week about using <code>futimes</code>
on platforms where it is available, noting that the MacOS X manpage
says that <code>utime</code> is obsolete and <code>utimes</code> should be used, but
the Posix manpage says that <code>utimes</code> is legacy, and <code>utime</code> should
be used for maximum portability. Sigh. Steve Peters and Gisle
discussed the problem of getting <em>Configure</em> to probe for this.</p><p>Also, Solaris 10 has a function called <code>futimesat</code>, which does
everything, and more besides. (In case you were wondering, these
functions deal with setting the access and modification times for
files).</p><p>

</p><h2> <a name="sort_multicall_patch_in_blead">sort/multicall patch in blead</a> </h2></p><p>Robin Houston's sort/multicall patch went into blead. Rafael noticed
a few puffs of smoke escape from the lab, and saw that one functionality
that the patch broke was the ability to empty the array <em>while you
sort it</em> and still retrieve the results afterwards. Since no-one
was really sure why anyone would want to do a thing like that, the
test was quietly dropped.</p><p>So don't try the following at home, because it's not going to work
any more:</p><p>
<pre>
  @a = (1..10);
  @b = sort { @a=(); ($a+1)&lt;=&gt;($b+1) } @a;</pre>
</p><p>Nicholas was worried that the test was a guard to check for core
dumps, but perl wasn't dumping core, just sorting an array of
undefined elements (which seems to be the right behaviour under the
circumstances).</p><p>Paul Marquess found that <code>DB_File</code> revealed a couple of problems
in the patch, and these problems were fixed. Jim Cromie pitched in
and fixed a couple of other test errors.</p><p>Dave Mitchell had a couple of minor queries about the code but
basically liked it. The conversation went on between Robin and Dave
for a while. Robin summed it up best:</p><p>
<pre>
  It's the usual perl internals story really: everything
  depends on everything else in mysterious and undocumented
  ways, and it's hard to make apparently innocent changes
  without subtle breakage...</pre>

</p><h2> <a name="compiling_5_8_7_with_visual_studio_2005">Compiling 5.8.7 with Visual Studio 2005</a> </h2></p><p>Joel Reed wrote in to say that he was having some difficulty
in compiling 5.8.7 with Microsoft's latest compiler, especially
in the area of <code>perlio</code> and related some very wacky symptoms.
He also tried 5.9.2, and that didn't work, either. And
unfortunately for Joel, he was Warnocked.</p><p>

</p><h2> <a name="the_prototype_of_perl_magic_clear_all_env">The prototype of <code>Perl_magic_clear_all_env</code> </a> </h2></p><p>Alan Burlison, in his quest to make the environment code a little
less icky, wanted to change the signature of the
<code>Perl_magic_clear_all_env</code> function. This would prevent memory
leaks when one lets perl manage the environment.</p><p>The main problem is whether or not this would break binary
compatibility. Steve Peters used the CPAN source code search and
found that no-one outside of core is using it, and thought that it
is unlikely that any other code does so, but the possibility
cannot be ruled out.</p><p>Alan was worried about platforms using different calling conventions
and decided that the best way forward would be to put the new smarts
in a new routine, and thereby not allow the possibility of breaking
binary compatibility.</p><p>Alan subsequently posted a patch to make use perl use <code>clearenv</code> on
platforms where it makes sense, and called for feedback on other
platforms such as MacOS, Symbian, VMS and Win32.</p><p>

  Segmentation fault</pre>
</p><p>and wondered why it was happening. Dave Mitchell promptly described the
problem and fixed it. Sadahiro Tomoyuki found that many other <code>pp_*</code>
functions exhibit similar behaviour and provided a patch to fix them too.
Tels wanted tests.</p><p>

</p><h2> <a name="see_perl_say__">See perl <code>say()</code> </a> </h2></p><p>Steve Peters proposed a patch to bring Perl 6's <code>say()</code> to Perl 5. (Which
is roughly <code>print</code> with a <code>\n</code> tacked on). Robin Houston pointed to a
prior thread (and patch) on the issue, that was not well received at the
time. The main problem is one of backwards compatibility: how do you deal
with a program that has defined a subroutine named <code>say</code>?</p><p>(The summariser recalls a thread on Perlmonks where someone suggested
using <code>-l</code> on the command line to get equivalent <code>say</code> functionality
with <code>print</code> and use <code>printf</code> (not necessarily with <code>%</code> args) to
get non-newline print behaviour).

a beta version). Some of the new features include: plays nicely with
<em>version.pm</em>, support for <code>sudo</code>, new commands, better error messages
and better handling of configuration variables.</p><h2> <a name="perl_5_bug_summary">Perl 5 Bug Summary</a> </h2></p><p>1520 open items, six items less that 2 weeks old have not been

</p><p>Alan Burlison was still wondering about the <code>malloc_wrap</code> compiler
warnings being produced. After discussing the issue with Nicholas, he

</p><p>Andreas J. Koenig took a stab at fixing bug #19049 (Incorrect <code>$`</code> after
