<p><a href="mailto:wdr@world.std.com">n1vux</a> writes <i>"Boston.pm will have a tech meeting next Tuesday, September 13, at MIT, in building E51, room 376 (directions below), starting at 7pm. Several local Mongers have been looking for a site for a possible YAPC::Boston 2006, so we'll talk about how the search is going. Uri has a bag full of schwag (a schwag bag, if you will) to give out. That is, admittedly, not a lot for a meeting.  Either I'll find something to speak on or we'll adjourn early and go out for drinks. :) RSVP to me if you're planning to attend - rjk-bostonpm(at)tamias.net. Pizza and soda will be provided. For more information about Boston Perl Mongers, or to subscribe to one of our mailing lists, visit our website at <a href="http://boston.pm.org/">http://boston.pm.org/</a> "</i></p>
<p><p>"Directions to MIT, Building E51:</p>
<p>Building E51 (the Tang Center) is located at the corners of Amherst and Wadsworth Streets in Cambridge.</p>
<p> <a href="http://whereis.mit.edu/map-jpg?mapterms=e51">http://whereis.mit.edu/map-jpg?mapterms=e51</a> </p>  <p>Directions by T:</p>
<p>Take the Red Line to Kendall. Building E51 is right around the corner from the T stop. From the Inbound side, facing into Main Street, turn right (toward Boston) and walk down the block. Turn right on Wadsworth Street and walk to the corner of Amherst Street. Building E51 is the building across the street directly in front of you with the metal canopy.</p>
<p>Directions by Car:</p>
<p>General directions provided by MIT:</p>
<p> <a href="http://whereis.mit.edu/map-jpg?section=directions">http://whereis.mit.edu/map-jpg?section=directions</a> </p> <p>The Boston Linux and Unix user group also meets at E51, so you may find their directions helpful as well (keeping in mind that we will be meeting in room 376, not room 315):</p>
<p> <a href="http://www.blu.org/directions/mit/e51-315.php">http://www.blu.org/directions/mit/e51-315.php</a> </p> <p>Parking Information:</p>
<p>MIT's Amherst Street Lot is adjacent to the building:</p>
<p> <a href="http://whereis.mit.edu/map-jpg?selection=P4&amp;Parking=go">http://whereis.mit.edu/map-jpg?selection=P4&amp;Parking=go</a> </p> <p>Officially, a sticker is required to park in the lot. However, we've been told unofficially that there is no enforcement after 3pm weekdays, nor on the weekends. Chances are very slim that cars will be ticketed. Nonetheless, parking in the lot is at your own risk."</p></p>
