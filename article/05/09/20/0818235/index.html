<p>Nicholas Clark announced the plan for perl 5.8.8, so it
was only fitting that someone should post a question asking
how to compile 5.004. Elsewhere there continued to be lots
of discussion of VMS, carrying on from last week. All told,
a fairly busy week with lots of single post threads, which
made summarising a bit difficult.</p>
<p><h2>5.8.8 is Coming</h2>
<p>Nicholas Clark posted a plan for 5.8.8.</p>
<p>The deadline for changes (in blead, to be integrated in maint) is
<strong>16th October 2005</strong>. He will be "mostly incommunicado" for the first
weeks of October, but explained that it isn't a problem. Fixes of
bugs in pseudohashes and 5.005 threads go directly to maint and
little else does. Steve Peters suggested that changes to re-entrant
functions could be another exception, but for Nicholas it would
have to wait for someone to figure out how to merge the code.</p>

  The Current TODO
  <a href="http://mirrors.develooper.com/perl/APC/perl-current/pod/perltodo.pod">http://mirrors.develooper.com/perl/APC/perl-current/pod/perltodo.pod</a> </pre>
<p>
<h2>New Core Module Releases</h2>
</p> <p>Jarkko Hietaniemi, fulfilling the promise of last week's "Math::Complex
atan2 bug" thread, announced a patch with several pending updates
for <code>Math::Complex</code> and <code>Math::Trig</code>.</p>
<p>The result of <code>atan2(0,0)</code> is now documented as being
dependent on the underlying library.</p>
<p>Nadeem Douba pointed what he called a small technical bug. He called
for an optional argument, <code>rho</code>, to the subroutine
<code>great_circle_destination</code> and explained the rationale of a solution.
Jarkko countered that he was confused by the proposal, which does
not fit the usual concept of radians. The default coordinate system
cannot be changed without breaking existing code and there is no
<em>correct</em> spherical coordinate system. He proposed a special export
tag as a possible way to incorporate Nadeem's suggestion.</p>
<p>John Peacock released version-0.48 to CPAN and a corresponding patch
vs. bleadperl. A pure Perl implementation is coming and John hopes
he soon will be done with this project. But before that, the PAUSE
indexer needs to be fixed and <code>CPANPLUS</code>, <code>CPAN</code>, <code>Module::Build</code>
patched to use <em>version.pm</em> "fulltime".</p>
<p>
<h2>Zlib on VMS</h2>
</p> <p>The efforts to make <code>Compress::Zlib</code> work in blead on VMS continue.
A long thread developed involving John E. Malmberg, Paul Marquess
(<code>Compress::Zlib</code>), Tom Hughes (<code>IO::Zlib</code>), Jarkko Hietaniemi (external
gzip support in <code>IO::Zlib</code>). It seems there are a zillion options
to configure VMS Unix emulation and not all of these are handled
gracefully by the Perl source code. Uncertainty concerning
the differences of environment remains.</p>
<p>The thread went on under the subject "Zlib 2.00_03 / Blead 25366
on VMS + patched vms.c" where John Malmberg and Paul Marquess
continued the detective work. John's last message is investigating
a possible problem with <code>glob()</code> on VMS which can be responsible for
some of the test failures. It was found that by just removing
leading "./" from directory variables on a test script
made all its tests to pass. Craig Berry explained how limited
is the home-grown <code>glob()</code> on VMS and John Malmberg
notices that, as of OpenVMS 7.3-2, a <code>glob()</code> function is
provided in the C library that is better be used on
releases that supported it.</p>
<p>Paul Marquess and John Malmberg went on to discuss
issues on the consistency of VMS conversions
and how it could be made better. Peter Prymer
confirmed some VMS oddities on filename handling.</p>

<h2>More VMS Issues</h2>
</p> <p>John E. Malmberg spotted a bug on the VMS specific <code>Perl_cando()</code>
and squashed it with patch @25388. H. Merijn Brand applied it.</p>
<pre>

    <a href="http://xrl.us/hn2q">http://xrl.us/hn2q</a> </pre>

<pre>
    <a href="http://xrl.us/hn2r">http://xrl.us/hn2r</a> </pre>
<p>He added a few comments on the discussion with Ken Williams about
an enhanced file spec handling for current VMS versions.</p>
<p>The week closed with the posting by John Malmberg of an RFC
proposing some VMS behavior changes. Apparently those changes
may improve the consistency and precision of VMS perl.</p>

<h2>Fiddling with the Bloody Grammar</h2>
</p> <p>After the closing act of Michael Schwern, there was some subsequent
traffic. Randal Schwartz discussed using "for example", "such as",
"and so on" to say precisely what we mean. He thought it may be
used as a general guideline for future writings, without crusades
to fix it "in the past".</p>
<p>There was silence for a while. And then David Nicol offered a 92K
patch over 5.9.2 replacing every <code>e\.?g\.?</code> and <code>i\.?e\.?</code> with
<em>for example</em> and <em>that is</em>. Adding commas and removing <code>I&lt;italics&gt;</code>
were left as an exercise for some willing person. No one volunteered.</p>

<h2>OS X 10.4 Issues</h2>
</p> <p>"make test" for maint on OXS 10.4 fails <em>lib/locale.t</em>.
Randal says: "At least it fails on only one thing".
Rafael remembers it's a problem
with system locales. Dominic Dunlop notices
this problem is recorded as bug #35895 (and
logged as a bug with Apple as well - with no
return). Dominic proposes a patch on Darwin
to skip lib/locale.t tests on locales containing
eu_ES as well as Byelorussian and Catalan locales.
It applies to versions between 8.0.0 and 8.2.0,
and hopefully will get fixed on the next Apple release.
Patch applied.</p>
<pre>
    <a href="http://xrl.us/hn2w">http://xrl.us/hn2w</a> </pre>
<p>Randal L. Schwartz posted a test failure building Storable on OS X.
It basically said "no weak references here". Steve Peters
remembered seeing something similar before: the default Perl on
OS X 10.4 was built without compiling the XS portion of <code>Scalar::Utils</code>.
A fresh install of <code>Scalar::Utils</code> fixes the problem. Randal checked
it and thought Storable would need <code>Scalar::Util</code> as a prereq in order
to have the the issue handled automatically.</p>
<p>Fixing the Storable's test to ignore the "weak isn't supported"
error would be the bug report for p5p. Nicholas Clark said that
Randal should send a bug report to his Perl distributor asking "why isn't it
installing the XS version of a core module?"
Randal insisted that 'maintperl' was used. Nicholas
and Randal have not reached a consensus yet.</p>
<p>To be continued, no doubt, next week.</p>

<h2>Configuring ranlib for perl on OSX</h2>
</p> <p>Steve Peters revived the interest in a bug (#36448) and patch
reported by Luke Closs back in July. It concerned a change
Apple did in how ar works in Tiger and was a "rather simple change".
As a matter of fact, H. Merijn Brand had it in his queue and had
been waiting for someone with access to a MacOS-like OS. Nicholas
checked it and applied it.</p>

<h2>The Return of the Consting</h2>
</p> <p>Background: Andy Lester has been spending his copious spare time
in the recent months bringing const (and other goodies) to the perl
sources, the rationale being to piggy-back the analysis that modern
compilers can perform as a way to help squash bugs.</p>
<p>Andy was back with a 13K "patch of accumulated goodness", promptly
applied by H. Merijn. Robin Barker reported still getting warning
messages related to attributes.</p>

<h2>Optional arrow operator on <code>(LIST)[LIST]-&gt;</code> </h2>
</p> <p>The thread named "perlref Documentation About Optional -&gt; Is Too Vague"
has long changed to a proposal on a syntax extension.
Prodded by Yitzchak Scott-Thoennes, Rafael Garcia-Suarez applied a
patch that made the following syntactically correct:</p>
<pre>
    my $x = (foo())[0][1];</pre>
<p>just like</p>
<pre>
    my $x = (foo())[0]-&gt;[1];</pre>
<p>Sometime ago, he had expressed a minor concern on the possibility
it allows to people unaware of the problem write
non-backwards-compatible code with 5.10. Back then, Yitzchak
answered that could be a reason not to
include the patch in maint. Rafael thought that was the case, but
Nicholas Clark has the final word.</p>

<h2>Pod Indexing Project Status and Plan</h2>
</p> <p>Ivan Tubert-Brohman reported on the current status of the Pod
Indexing Project, with a nice summary and details. He pointed the
perl-5.8.8 deadline at Oct 16, 2005 and the opportunity to maximize
the number of indexed files. Volunteers are anxiously waited.</p>

<h2>Instrumenting perl at Runtime</h2>
</p> <p>Alexander Kolbasov kicked off a long, fascinating thread discussing
DTrace, a Solaris tool that allows one to dynamically instrument a
running program and gather useful information about its behaviour.
The first difficulty Alexander encountered was matching the underlying
C code to the Perl code being executed.</p>
<p>DTrace is being ported to FreeBSD and already
understands Java, PHP and Ruby.</p>
<p>Rafael pointed to Alan Burlison's work in the same
area, and pimped his own <code>Runops::Switch</code> module, that allows you to
replace perl's runloop at (script) compile time. He also answered,
or provided pointers for, a number of questions raised by Alexander.</p>
<p>For it to really work, some adaptations need to be made to the
sources.</p>

<h2>Compiling perl 5.004</h2>
</p> <p>Shaun Daredia pleaded for help to get 5.004 running on some
Linux-type platform. The trouble is essentially that
5.004 is old, and the configuration script gets confused by
the results that modern versions of <code>gcc</code> emit in response
to its probes. H. Merijn Brand provided a clue as to how to
fix the problem, but with no certainty.</p>

<h2>PXPerl New Site</h2>
</p> <p>PXPerl is a full-featured Perl, Pugs and Parrot binary
distribution for Windows. Gr&#233;goire P&#233;an announced
the new address for the project.</p>
<p>The current distribution PXPerl 5.8.7-4 contains Perl 5.8.7,
Pugs 6.2.9 and Parrot 0.2.2.</p>
<p>The aim of the project is to provide
an always up-to-date build. Vive Perl!
Vive Gr&#233;goire! Windows users must be grateful.</p>

<h2>Parallel Testing</h2>
</p> <p>Nicholas notices how the core regression test is getting more
comprehensive. This is a good thing, except that it takes longer
to run. He asks: would it be feasible to run tests in parallel?
Of course, it involves some issues to solve and he advances some
of them. This topic was entered in <code>perltodo</code> which was reordered
so as to not scare people any more with brain-melting things.</p>
<p>Yuval Kogman stated that Pugs (the experimental Perl 6 compiler)
actually supports running tests in parallel.</p>

<h2>Lots of warnings building 5.8.8@24637</h2>
</p> <p>Paul Marquess reports lots of warnings while
building 5.8.8@24637. Nicholas Clark answers most of
them are the same errors blead showed up
when Andy Lester started adding const to blead.
He hopes to see these warnings going away as
he brings in fixing patches. VMS or Windows
can be broken by those last changes, as Nicholas
were not able to try them yet. Andy asks
whether he can provide some help on this effort
and Nicholas says Andy's later changes needs
to be merged and then some work will be in
order to get maint warning free again.</p>
<p>After carping on glibc headers,
Nicholas adds clean system headers to his growing wish list .</p>

<h2> <code>malloc_size</code> and <code>malloc_good_size</code> </h2>
</p> <p>Steve Peters announced the detection
of malloc_size/malloc_good_size added to Configure.</p>
<p>John E. Malmberg produces a patch for VMS in
order to deal with the new configure parameters
<code>malloc_size</code> and <code>malloc_good_size</code>. Merijn
applied it and also asked if someone tested
for problems with win32. Steve
Peters reported to not have seen any problems.</p>

<h2>UTF8-Related Bug Reports</h2>
</p> <p>Christian Jaeger reported that taint mode still
breaks UTF-8 handling.
Problems can be seen with code as simple as</p>
<pre>
    use Encode;
    open F,&quot;some/file/containing_utf8_text&quot; or die $!;
    my $buf;
    read F,$buf,10,1000 or die $!;
    my $str= Encode::decode_utf8($buf);</pre>
<p>Things work fine unless the -T switch is used. Dan "the Encode Maintainer" Kogai
duplicated the behaviour on 5.8.6, isolated it and wondered if a POD
fix is in order or is it an authentic undocumented bug?</p>
<pre>
    <a href="http://xrl.us/hn3c">http://xrl.us/hn3c</a> </pre>
<p>John Gardiner Myers shows a code snippet in bug #37161
where a thread writes ISO-88591-1 encoded
data when it should output UTF-8 instead. Code in
threads seems not to respect the <code>:utf8</code> discipline.</p>

<h2>In Brief</h2>
</p> <p>Nicholas Clark followed up on a conversation
with Salvador Fandi&#241;o about how
assertion support could be improved, including
opening new possibilities for what independent
modules can achieve with hooks affecting code in
compile time.</p>
<pre>
    <a href="http://xrl.us/hn3f">http://xrl.us/hn3f</a> </pre>
<p>In bug #37190, Nicholas Clark reports OS X
and FreeBSD crashing when using <code>-DT</code> with
<code>use warnings;</code> He suspects of a real bug
somewhere. Rick Delaney gives some clues
on the interpretation of the debugging log.</p>
<p>John Damm S&#248;rensen reports in #37156 on a problem
on compiling 5.8.7 on IA64. It concerns
a well known issue for which some workarounds
are listed and have been found to work fine.
Nevertheless, these are not mentioned
in perl README files.</p>
<pre>

<p>Rahul Sharma reported (in bug #37162) a problem during
'make test' on HP-UX using cc to compile Perl.
It had to do with missing gmake. But gmake
should not have being used. Merijn, Nicholas,
and Andy Dougherty discussed how it could have
happened, it it were a bug and how to fix it.</p>
<pre>
    <a href="http://xrl.us/hn3h">http://xrl.us/hn3h</a> </pre>
<p>Hiroshi Manabe reported bug #37144, showing sample code which causes
very unpredictable results when running under the debugger.</p>
<pre>
    for ($i = 0; $i &lt; 10; ++$i) {
        $temp = &quot;\x{100}X&quot;;
        $temp =~ s/[^X]+//;  # bad things happen here (under the debugger)
    }</pre>
<p>No-one offered any insights as to what was happening. Things like
this make you wonder how nobody encountered it before.</p>

<p>During work on a Pod processor, Joshua Hobblit
found quirks in the POD specs, <code>Pod::Perldoc</code> and
<code>Pod::Parser</code>. Should the chunk</p>
<pre>
    bar
       baz</pre>
<p>parse as an ordinary paragraph or
two separate ones (with "   baz" in a verbatim paragraph)?
Rafael points Sean Burke as the one to clarify matters.</p>

<p>Aaron Kaplan reported in #37142 that <code>h2xs</code> produces no code for
an enum constant with explicit negative value like
<code>enum foo { bar = -1 }</code>. He supplied a patch and it was applied.</p>
<pre>
    <a href="http://xrl.us/hn3k">http://xrl.us/hn3k</a> </pre>
<p>"Dentom_Sam" states in bug #37191 that he can consistently get the error:</p>
<pre>
    Can't call method &quot;close&quot; on an undefined value</pre>
<p>on <code>IPC::Open3</code>. He diagnosed it has to do with redirections
leading to failure and suggested a possible fix.</p>
<p>David Austin complains about <code>IO::Select</code>
not having a way to distinguish between
timeout and errors. He suggests how
a timeout must be returned and mentions
how it is not documented what <code>IO::Select-&gt;select</code>
returns after a timeout.</p>
