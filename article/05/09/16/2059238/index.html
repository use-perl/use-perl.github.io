<p>S&#233;bastien Aperghis-Tramoni, Adriano Ferreira and David Landgren have
stepped up to the plate to bring you the weekly p5p summaries.  We
make no promises as to how long we can keep this up, but we'll give
it a go for as long as we can.</p>
<p>

<h2> <a name="the_return_of_the_perl5porters_summaries">The Return of the perl5-porters Summaries</a> </h2>

<p>There has been a lot of action happening in Perl 5 land, and we
hope that these messages will help people keep abreast of the latest
developments.</p>
<p>Onto last week's traffic:</p>
<p>
<h2> <a name="sub___________and_x__">sub _ { ... } and -X _</a> </h2>
</p><p>Peter Dintelmann pondered over the meaning of <code>-X _</code> when
<code>sub _ { ... }</code> defined, as it can lead to some surprising behaviour.
Mark-Jason Dominus pointed to
<a href="http://hop.perl.plover.com/errata/byid.cgi/131">http://hop.perl.plover.com/errata/byid.cgi/131</a> and
<a href="http://hop.perl.plover.com/user/alias/list.cgi?2:mss:264">http://hop.perl.plover.com/user/alias/list.cgi?2:mss:264</a> for more
information on the matter.</p>
<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/hkyk">http://xrl.us/hkyk</a> </pre>
<p>
<h2> <a name="vms_issues">VMS Issues</a> </h2>
</p><p>John E. Malmberg asked for advice on how to deal with File::Copy
on VMS.  The library test fails because the copied file ends up
with a timestamp of 'now', which is consistent with the way things
are done in the DCL command shell. Part of the problem was that the
test suite failure message was misleading. John fixed things up as
best he could.</p>
<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/hkym">http://xrl.us/hkym</a> </pre>
<p>He also landed a patch for ExtUtils::CBuilder. After a bit of work,
he and Ken Williams got it working correctly.</p>
<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/hkyn">http://xrl.us/hkyn</a> </pre>
<p>In other VMS news, the current bleadperl is testing fairly well.
The main show-stopper being  problems with Compress::Zlib.</p>
<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/hkyo">http://xrl.us/hkyo</a> </pre>
<p>
<h2> <a name="eliminating_arenaroots">Eliminating arenaroots</a> </h2>
</p><p>Internally, perl uses arenas of memory to allocate fixed-length
objects quickly and efficiently. The current plan is the shrink the
number of roots down to one. Jim Cromie supplied a patch. The test
smokes produced a number of odd results that had people scratching
their heads, until it was realised that the problem was a single
statement <code>if</code> that lost its braces.</p>
<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/hkyp">http://xrl.us/hkyp</a> </pre>
<p>
<h2> <a name="dying_in_a_grep">Dying in a grep</a> </h2>
</p><p>Chris Heath noted the following:</p>
<pre>
  $ perl -e 'for (&quot;foo&quot;) { grep(die, &quot;bar&quot;) }'
  Died at -e line 1.
  Attempt to free unreferenced scalar: SV 0x96c61dc, Perl interpreter: 0x96ae008.</pre>
<p>Normally, the third line shouldn't appear. And <code>map</code> will do the
same thing. Salvador Fandi&#241;o noted that this had already been recorded
as bug #24254.</p>
<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/hkyq">http://xrl.us/hkyq</a> </pre>
<p>
<h2> <a name="eg_should_be_e_g__in_the_documentation">eg should be e.g. in the documentation</a> </h2>
</p><p>David Landgren was peeved that <em>exempli gratia</em> is often abbreviated
to ``eg'' in the documentation, rather than ``e.g.''. Mark-Jason Dominus
wondered why it was not abbreviated to ``for example''. Michael Schwern
brought the discussion to a close by performing a simple cost/benefit
analysis.</p>
<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/hkyr">http://xrl.us/hkyr</a> </pre>
<p>
<h2> <a name="math__complex_atan2_bug">Math::Complex atan2 bug</a> </h2>
</p><p>Steffen M&#252;ller observed the following</p>
<pre>
  [...] in the complex plane, we get:
  perl -MMath::Complex -e &quot;print atan2(0,i)&quot;
  i/0: Division by zero.
  Died at c:/perl/perl58/lib/Math/Complex.pm line 1284.</pre>
<pre>
  This is not correct.
  Obviously, 0/i is the same as 0/1 which is 0.
  Thus atan2(0,i) == atan2(0,1) == atan(0) == 0</pre>
<p>Jarkko Hietaniemi said that he'd cook up a patch, but that he had
other outstanding things to do with Math::Complex and Math::Trig.</p>
<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/hkys">http://xrl.us/hkys</a> </pre>
<p>
<h2> <a name="undefing__foo_code_">undefing *foo{CODE}</a> </h2>
</p><p>Ben Tilly reported that undef'ing the CODE slot of a typeglob doesn't
quite work well enough to be useful, and supplied a short snippet
of code showing the problem.</p>
<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/hkyt">http://xrl.us/hkyt</a> </pre>
<p>Dave Mitchell shed some light on what was going on under the covers
``the thing continues to exist, but has no useful 'value''', and
Rafael Garcia-Suarez noted that</p>
<pre>
   delete &amp;mysub</pre>
<p>is on the TODO list, but getting it right in all cases is extremely
tricky.</p>
<p>
<h2> <a name="tr___on_ebcdic_platforms">tr// on EBCDIC platforms</a> </h2>
</p><p>Sadahiro Tomoyuki found problems with transliterating Unicode
characters. I can only offer my deepest sympathy.</p>
<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/hkyu">http://xrl.us/hkyu</a> </pre>
<p>
<h2> <a name="new_core_module_releases">New core module releases</a> </h2>
</p><p>Graham Barr released IO version 1.22. There was concern about what
the impact would be on the 5.6 series.</p>
<pre>
  <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/IO/">http://search.cpan.org/dist/IO/</a> </pre>
<p>Dan Kogai released Encode 2.12...</p>
<pre>
  <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Encode/">http://search.cpan.org/dist/Encode/</a> </pre>
<p>... and Ruslan U. Zakirov spotted a problem with an example in the
documentation.</p>
<p>
<h2> <a name="the_return_value_of_svutf8__">The return value of <code>SvUTF8()</code> </a> </h2>
</p><p>In December 2004, Ton Hospel raised bug #32884. The internal perl
API defines <code>SvUTF8()</code> as taking a pointer to an SV, and returning
a boolean value indicating whether the SV contains utf-8 encoded
data. Compilers, casting between chars and ints, can arrive at
the situation whereby...</p>
<pre>
  if (SvUTF8(sv)) { ... }</pre>
<p>... and ...</p>
<pre>
  bool utf8 = SvUTF8(sv);
  if (utf8) { ... }</pre>
<p>... don't behave in the same way. Steve Peters revived interest in
the bug, by asking whether returning a U32 value instead of a bool
would fix matters.</p>
<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/hmtr">http://xrl.us/hmtr</a> </pre>
<p>
<h2> <a name="in_brief">In Brief</a> </h2>
</p><p>Rajarshi Das found a problem with Encode on EBCDIC. Dan Kogai noted
that the code is not well tested on EBCDIC. There was another thread
on the matter:</p>
<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/hkyv">http://xrl.us/hkyv</a> </pre>
<p>Robert Spier released the latest version of the Perl5 bug summary</p>
<pre>
  <a href="http://rt.perl.org/rt3/NoAuth/perl5/Overview.html">http://rt.perl.org/rt3/NoAuth/perl5/Overview.html</a> </pre>
<p>Summary of the summary: there are 1500 open tickets.</p>
<p>``brucer'' filed a bug report for <code>my $var if 0</code>. Michael Schwern
demonstrated that this now produces a warning in bleadperl.</p>
<pre>
  $ bleadperl -wle 'my $v if 0;'
  Deprecated use of my() in false conditional at -e line 1.</pre>
<p>Ikegami reported bug #37076, a snippet involving threads and 'require
IO'. Using 'use IO' makes the bug go away. Nicholas Clark suggested
that this is caused by threads scribbling over memory that doesn't
belong to them.</p>
<p>``sgromoll'' reported #37133, a crash related to threads and lock().
Nicholas thought this was could be a deadlock in the threads
implementation.</p>
<p>Michael Schwern noted that #7615 <code>if (local $a = 1){ ... }</code> is
still a problem:</p>
<pre>
  $ bleadperl -wle '$a = 10;  if( local $a = 1 ) {}  print $a'
  Found = in conditional, should be == at -e line 1.
  1
  $ bleadperl -wle '$a = 10;  if( my $a = 1 ) {}  print $a'
  Found = in conditional, should be == at -e line 1.
  10</pre>
<p>Michael Schwern also followed up on the test suite of PathTools 3.10, which
was released some time ago.</p>
<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/hkyw">http://xrl.us/hkyw</a> </pre>
<p>In bug #36075, Nicholas Clark wants to get <code>malloc_size</code> and
<code>malloc_good_size</code> into <code>Configure</code>, because this would help perl
on Darwin. Steve Peters and H.Merijn Brand discussed various schemes
for doing this</p>
<p>Garry reported a memory leak with threads in #37134. Dave Mitchell
managed to come up with some remarkably concise code that demonstrates
the bug:</p>
<pre>
  use threads;
  sub ThreadRoutine {}
  while (1) {
    $thread = threads-&gt;new(\&amp;ThreadRoutine);
    $thread-&gt;join;
  }</pre>
<p>Brendan O'Dea supplied a few tweaks for <code>a2p</code>, thereby closing a
couple of Debian bugs, and wondered if anyone still uses it (<code>a2p</code>,
that is).</p>
