<p>KM writes <i>"With the close of another successful YAPC::NA, it is now
time to throw open the call for venues for next year's (2006) YAPC::NA
conference.
<br> <br>
You can get details on what a YAPC venue needs at
<a href="http://www.yapc.org/venue-reqs.txt">http://www.yapc.org/venue-reqs.txt</a>. When making your proposal, in
addition to venue information and possible dates, do please make sure to include
details on airport locations, local public transit (as well as transit
to the venue from the airport!), local cultural attractions, and
accommodation information. (See the docs for more details) The more
information you provide, within reason, the better.
<br> <br>
As with last year, we are also making available the different categories, and
weight for those categories, for prospective proposers. Please visit
<a href="http://yapc.org/yapc-crit.txt">http://yapc.org/yapc-crit.txt</a> for more information on this. This shows
the catgeories under which venues will be reviewed to be able to bring
another great conference to you, at the lowest cost possible.
<br> <br>
Send the proposals to yapc-venues AT yetanother DOT org. Proposals are
due by Friday, September 2 2005, with a decision due on September 16
2005. (If the summertime vacation blahs catch everyone out we may
extend the deadline. Don't count on that) This gives about N weeks,
which should be manageable, and should still fit within most college
and university scheduling requirements.
<br> <br>
This is your chance to bring a YAPC to your town. It's a very rewarding
experience, and is a great way to give to the Perl community."</i></p>
