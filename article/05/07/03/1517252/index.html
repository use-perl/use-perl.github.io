<p><a href="mailto:fhew3atcogecodotca">Fulko Hew</a> writes <i>"Now that YAPC::NA::2005 is over, and was a resounding success, work has started (as promised) on assembling the proceedings.  For the presenters: this is your chance to update your slide show or presentation material that you want to include in the proceedings.  It also gives you one last chance to update your photo and biography.  (you should already know how to do that!)  For all of you who attended: please submit any photos and movies that your took during your visit and they wiil be added to the proceedings.  By going to <a href="http://hew.ca/yapc.html">http://hew.ca/yapc.html</a>  you can select
the talk on the appropriate day, push the appropriate button, and upload the appropriate item.
<br> <br>
If you are uploading photos or movies, try to file them according to the session or activity when they were taken, don't forget to add a caption, and most importantly, you have to upload them one at a time, not a zip'ed file!  Since the automatted audio and video recording system didn't quite work out as smoothly as I had hoped, it will be a while before the ~100 hours of recorded material can be processed and filed.  Once completed there will be another announcement about how you can download ISOs, individual sessions, or purchase CDs/DVDs of the conference.  In the meantime, you can scan the proceedings for the photos and presentation material currently submitted, by clicking on the titles of the sessions at the same URL.  (Please be gentle on my web server.)"</i></p>

<h2>Fulko, is the YAPC page working?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/davebaker/">davebaker</a> on 2005-07-03T21:06:29</h3>
I'm getting a blank page when I go to the YAPC upload page you mentioned. The home page at <a href="http://hew.ca/" title="hew.ca">http://hew.ca/</a hew.ca> is working, though. (Cool domain name!)

That URL does a re-direct to the appropriate location.  Maybe your having a problem with re-directs.
You can still use the direct link:<br>  <a href="http://hew.ca/cgi-bin/page.pl?Day=Day%201" title="hew.ca">http://hew.ca/cgi-bin/page.pl?Day=Day%201</a hew.ca>

The direct link doesn't appear to be working. The header data coming back contains lots of 'Client Junk:' entries but no content<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:(

It turns out I had left some debugging code in, and its been in there for weeks.  I just noticed that the page didn't work in Konqueror, but it _was_ working fine with Firefox.  Since I used Firefox, I never saw the problem.  Sorry... It has been fixed.

just a note that:<br/><br/>all buttons are for upload
click on the talk to see what's available now.<br/><br/>i  will pick few pictures to upload.<br/><br/>by the way, will the file be overwrited if i upload  one with the same name that already exist?<br/><br/>also, is it okay to upload a 50MB movie ? the  speed is a concern too.

Yes, you can upload movies too, until I run out of space.  As for the speed... The speed is the speed.
<p>
Eventually download will be via bitTorrent on a faster link once I finish assembling the proceedings.
</p> <p>
And the 'rotate' picture feature doesn't work right now on that server, sorry.</p>
