<p><a href="http://reversethis-gro.napctagoc/">cog</a> writes <i>"<a href="http://braga.yapceurope.org/">YAPC::EU::2005</a>, Braga, Portugal, 31 of August to 02 of September 2005. <a href="http://conferences.yapceurope.org/2005/schedule">The schedule is out</a>, things are on the move. T-shirts are being made, proceedings are being printed, and the organizers feel the growing sensation of panic in their guts growing larger and larger everyday that passes, and keep wondering why the hell they got into this."</i></p>
<p><i>"There are two things on our minds right now:<br> <br>1) Convincing people to come.<br> <br>Three whole days of Perl, three whole days surrounded by hundreds of Perl programmers. Enjoyful conversations, tasty meals in great company, and awesome speakers doing their talks.<br> <br>Lots of interesting subjects being discussed, lots of extra activities, most of which still Perl related. BOF's, walks and talks.<br> <br>2) Convincing people who are coming to <a href="http://conferences.yapceurope.org/2005/register">register</a> themselves and <a href="http://conferences.yapceurope.org/2005/change">update their data</a>.<br> <br>Yes, you wouldn't imagine how important this is. We have absolutely no idea at the moment of how many mongers we'll have with us. The more the better, sure, but a more approximate number would make things easier on our side. We really wouldn't like to be start the conference with not enough t-shirts, not enough proceedings, not enough food, not enough of all the surprises we'll have for you.<br> <br>If you're coming, please <a href="http://conferences.yapceurope.org/2005/register">register yourself</a>. All you need to put there is you name and email, so it doesn't even take a minute and you'll be helping us a lot.<br> <br>We currently have <a href="http://conferences.yapceurope.org/2005/stats">over 160 attendees registered</a> and that numbers grows everyday. Out of those, 87 have already confirmed their presence (which means they're speakers or have payed their entrances). Do consider doing this (paying) as soon as possible, too. It's easier to organize a conference when there's money O:-)<br> <br>Also, if possible, take the time to <a href="http://conferences.yapceurope.org/2005/change">update your personal data</a> in that system, namely your t-shirt size, or you'll risk using a t-shirt that seems to be a skirt on you or, on the oposite side of things, having trouble moving from room to room.<br> <br>Help us make a great conference.<br> <br>Do come, and do register yourself.<br> <br>We'll be waiting for you, and we promise to do everything in our hands to make your stay in Portugal a pleasant one. [1]<br> <br>The organizers.<br> <br>[1] - Unless, of course, you voted for <a href="http://braga.yapceurope.org/index.cgi?TheFishnetsIncident">fishnets</a>...<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)"</i></p>
