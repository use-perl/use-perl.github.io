<p><a href="mailto:acme@astray.com">acme</a> writes <i>"The Perl Foundation has migrated Perl 5 to the Git<br>version control system, making it easier than ever for Perl's development<br>team to continue to improve the language that powers many websites."</i> <p>Read below for the full announcement (and the instructions for getting the sources).</p></p>
<p>Moving from Perforce to git provides a number of benefits to the Perl<br>community:<br> <br>- With a public repository and Git's extensive support for distributed<br>and offline work, working on Perl 5's source becomes easier for everyone<br>involved.<br> <br>- Because Git is open source, all developers now have equal access to<br>the tools required to work on Perl's codebase.<br> <br>- Core committers have less administrative work to do when integrating<br>contributed changes.<br> <br>- Developers outside the core team can more easily work on experimental<br>changes to Perl before proposing them for inclusion in the next release.<br> <br>- A vast array of improved repository and change analysis tools are now<br>available to Perl's developers.<br> <br>- The new Git repository includes every version of Perl 5 ever released,<br>as well as every revision made during development.<br> <br>Interested developers can get a copy of the Perl 5 Git repository at<br>at <a href="http://perl5.git.perl.org/perl.git">http://perl5.git.perl.org/perl.git</a> <br> <br>In true open source style, Sam Vilain converted Perl's history from<br>Perforce to Git. He did the work both in his spare time and in time<br>donated by his employer, Catalyst IT. He spent more than a year building<br>custom tools to transform 21 years of Perl history into the first<br>ever unified repository of every single change to Perl. In addition<br>to changes from Perforce, Sam patched together a comprehensive view<br>of Perl's history incorporating publicly available snapshot releases,<br>changes from historical mailing list archives and patch sets recovered<br>from the hard drives of previous Perl release engineers.<br> <br>Perl 5 is used by businesses around the world including the BBC,<br>Amazon.com, LiveJournal, Ticketmaster, Craigslist and IMDb. Larry Wall<br>created Perl in 1987 while working as a systems administrator for NASA.<br> <br>Larry released Perl 1.000 on December 18th 1987. Over the past 21 years,<br>Perl has grown into a high-level, general-purpose, dynamic programming<br>language and is widely used for Web development, Systems Administration,<br>Genomics and in many other disciplines. The most recent major version<br>of Perl 5 (5.10.0) was released one year ago.<br> <br>Git is an open source version control system designed to handle very<br>large projects with speed and efficiency. Created by Linus Torvalds,<br>the inventor of Linux to handle the vast number of contributions to<br>the Linux Kernel, Git is highly flexible and extensible. Perl's motto,<br>"There's More Than One Way To Do It!" perfectly matches the Git workflow.<br> <br>Nicholas Clark, the manager for Perl 5.8.9 which was released this week,<br>said "I'm looking forward to Git giving me the ability to work either<br>online or offline. Perforce is great when I have a network connection,<br>but until now those times when I've been trying to develop on trains<br>or planes, at stations or airports, I'm back in the 'dark ages' before<br>version control. Git solves this problem and more".<br> <br>The hardware behind this and the systems administration time to maintain<br>it is donated by Booking.com. Booking.com has also recently donated<br>$50,000 to The Perl Foundation, to aid in the further development and<br>maintenance of the Perl programming language in general, and Perl 5.10<br>in particular.<br> <br>Perl originally used the Revision Control System (RCS) until March<br>1997 when it switched to the Perforce Software Configuration Management<br>System. The Perforce repository was graciously hosted and maintained,<br>free of charge, by ActiveState. Perforce provided the core developers<br>with powerful tools, but these tools were not available to users outside<br>the core team. The switch to Git removes this barrier.<br> <br>About The Perl Foundation (http://www.perlfoundation.org/) | The Perl<br>Foundation is dedicated to the advancement of the Perl programming<br>language through open discussion, collaboration, design, and code. The<br>Perl Foundation coordinates the efforts of numerous grass-roots Perl-based<br>groups, including: International Yet Another Perl Conferences (YAPC's),<br>Carries the legal responsibility for Perl 5 and Perl 6 and the Artistic<br>and Artistic 2.0 licenses, perl.org, Perl Mongers, and PerlMonks.<br> <br>About Booking.com (http://www.booking.com/) | Booking.com is part of<br>Priceline.com (Nasdaq: PCLN). Its website attracts an average of 30<br>million unique visitors each month. Booking.com works with more than<br>57,000 affiliated hotels in 15,000 destinations around the world. Its<br>services are available in 21 languages. Booking.com currently has 24<br>offices in Amsterdam, Athens, Barcelona, Berlin, Cambridge, Cape Town,<br>Dubai, Dublin, London, Loul&#233; (Portugal), Lyon, Madrid, Moscow, Munich,<br>New York, Orlando, Paris, Rome, San Francisco, Sydney, Singapore,<br>Stockholm, Vienna and Warsaw.<br> <br>About Catalyst IT (NZ) Ltd (http://www.catalyst.net.nz/) | Catalyst IT<br>is New Zealand's premiere Open Source development house. Catalyst looks<br>after the development requirements for the NZ Electoral Enrolment Centre,<br>manage the .NZ registry, the largest NZ newspaper's online presence,<br>the NZ TAB and many other exciting projects.</p>
