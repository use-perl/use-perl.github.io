<p><p>A few months ago, brian posted a blog entry
about
<a href="http://use.perl.org/user/brian_d_foy/journal/37664" title="perl.org">patching modules using Git</a>.
In the ensuing discussion, I pointed at a possible way to
automatise the process a step further by punting the generated
patch to rt.cpan.org.  The hack was well-received  and, with
(very) minimal coaxing, I was subsequently convinced to
expand on the idea for <a href="http://www.theperlreview.com/">The Perl Review</a>.</p></p>
<p>The resulting piece is now available in TPR 5.1. In the article, the initial command-line hack has morphed into four scripts -- git-cpan-init, git-cpan-clone, git-cpan-update and git-cpan-sendpatch -- that pretty much take care of all the administrative overhead of module patching. In most cases, grabbing a distro, fixing a bug and sending the patch can be done in four lines:<blockquote><div><p> <tt>&nbsp; &nbsp; $ git cpan-init Some::Module<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; $ git checkout -b mypatch<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; ...hack hack hack...<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; $ git rebase -i cpan<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; $ git cpan-sendpatch</tt> </p></div></blockquote><p>And, no, the lack of hyphen between git and cpan-X isn't a typo; the article also covers how to seamlessly integrate the new scripts into the git infrastructure (as Edna Mode would say, it's a non-feature, dahling).

Of course, I'm burning to say more, but I'll have to stop here. To know the whole story, you'll have to wait for <a href="http://www.theperlreview.com/">The Perl Review</a> to land in your mailbox (you are subscribed to TPR, right?).

<p>I wrote a CPAN/BACKPAN -&gt; git gateway a while back.  The code is here:</p><p><a href="http://git.jrock.us/?p=MetaCPAN.git;a=blob;f=bin/git-cpan;hb=HEAD" title="jrock.us">http://git.jrock.us/?p=MetaCPAN.git;a=blob;f=bin/git-cpan;hb=HEAD</a jrock.us></p><p>I have been meaning to index the whole BACKPAN and host the generated YAML files publicly... but if you want to play with it right now, point the indexer at a minicpan or cpan mirror, and then say "git-cpan Foo::Bar".  (The reason we need an index here is because Foo::Bar is not necessarily in a distribution called Foo-Bar, and the distribution name isn't necessarily the same between releases of Foo::Bar.)</p>

<p>Interesting.  I've not been quite able to get it work, but it seems like a much more all-encompassing version of my quick hack.  I'll have to keep my eye on it.</p><p>Are you still actively developing that project, or is it more sitting on the back burner?</p>
