<p>David Landgren replied to Jan Dubois on the subject of inodes on
Win32.  <code>perlport</code> says the second value in the return list from
<code>stat</code> is always 0, and this throws off the code that detects race
conditions.  As such, there's no way to determine if an attacker
is manipulating the filesystem for some nefarious purpose while a
long-running <code>rmtree()</code> call is running.</p>

<p>As it turns out, Windows filesystems may be intrinsically immune
to the attack, since you cannot move (or remove) a directory if any
process whatsoever has set their current working directory to it,
or any directory underneath it.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, Rafa&#235;l Garcia-Suarez applied a patch from
Alexandr Ciornii to get the bleading <code>Data::Dumper</code> to compile
on older perls. Dave Mitchell wondered whether C compilers
understood Perl comments. If not, this may mean that the patch
needs patching.</p>

<p>Bram looked at change #30608, which involved commenting out a <code>study</code>
operation in <em>op/taint.t</em>. This results in the tests not really testing
what they set out to test.</p>
<p>He asked if anyone could recall why the line was commented out. No takers,
but I wonder if it has something to do with Yves Orton discovering and
UTF-8 and <code>study</code> studiously ignored each other in the regexp engine.</p>

<h2> <a name="module__build_changes_for_vms"> <code>Module::Build</code> changes for VMS</a> </h2>
<p>John E. Malmberg revived the stranded changes for <code>Module::Build</code> that
were put aside in the lead up to 5.10.0. Essentially a number of
Unixisms needed to be excised from the code.</p>
<p>Craig A. Berry went through the changes with a fine-toothed comb and
picked up a number of glitches that needed work. John revised his work
and then had a patch ready for consideration by Ken Williams.</p>
<p>Craig found it hard to reconcile blead's <code>Module::Build</code> with Ken's
own repository. Ken found himself regretting Perforce's ability to
track the integration of patches. The plan at the end of the week
was to attack Ken's repository directly, and then dump something from
that back into blead.</p>
<p>John also figured out what was going wrong with <code>Archive::Tar</code>

creating an unopenable archive on VMS, which would have them within
an inch of having <code>Module::Build</code> build and test perfectly on VMS.</p>

  <a href="http://xrl.us/bmj6c">http://xrl.us/bmj6c</a> </pre>
<p>John detailed the <code>Archive::Tar</code> issue with VMS regarding
<em>Module/Build/t/ppm.t</em> in more detail in another thread. The problem
boils down to the different ways (stream and record oriented) that
one may employ to read a file on VMS. After this is fixed all that
will be needed is to mark VMS as having case-insensitive file names.</p>

<h2> <a name="confused_about_close_stdin">Confused about <code>close STDIN</code> </a> </h2>
<p>Bram was looking over an old bug report and trying to understand
what happens when one closes <code>STDIN</code>, and wondered if the
documentation for <code>close</code> needed improvement.</p>
<p>Mark Mielke explained the difference between file descriptor 0 and
the <code>STDIN</code> file handle, which, through an extraordinary coincidence
of fate are usually the same, but sometimes aren't.</p>

<p>In which case, the documentation about <code>STDIN</code> needs to be worked
on, rather than <code>close</code>.</p>

<p>(And the rest of the title of the thread is &quot;...but not under test
(and not failing with threads under harness)&quot;). Bram spent some time
working to reduce the problem down to the tiniest test case possible,
and in getting down to about five lines of real code, succeeded.</p>
<p>When he asked if anyone had an explanation for what was happening,
however, he met with less success.</p>

<p>The <code>installman</code> script is slow. All it is doing text processing, which we're
told is something Perl is good at. So it would be nice to know what it is doing
that is taking so much CPU, and where possible address it.</p>

<h2> <a name="testing____with_in_memory_files">Testing <code>$/</code> with in memory files</a> </h2>
<p>Back in April, Bram had added some new regression tests for bug
#44833, that had itself been resolved many moons ago. At the time,
Rafa&#235;l applied them. Early in May, Ben Morrow suggested that
Bram's technique was not very cross-platform compatible, relying
as it did on a specific environment variable that specific Unix
shells leave behind. At the same time, Ben suggested a better
internal-to-Perl condition, so Bram rewrote the test to use that.</p>
<p>This week Bram pinged the list since the change still hadn't been
committed.</p>

<p>Steffen M&#239;ller was keen to see an updated <em>lib.pm</em> make it
out to CPAN, since that would allow him to upgrade older perl
installations. This in turn would stop <code>use lib 'foo.par'</code>
from issuing a useless warning.</p>
<p>He tracked down Tim Bunce, who was listed as the current author.
Tim pleaded amnesia. Steffen took over maintenance, and posted
a few tweaks that would allow him to ready the module for a
CPAN release. Rafa&#235;l tweaked the license section to make it
friendlier to license lawyers.</p>

<h2> <a name="document_behaviour_when_optional_match_does_not_match___3589_">Document behaviour when optional match does not match (#3589)</a> </h2>
<p>Reini Urban wrote a patch for <code>perlre</code> in an attempt to resolve an eight
year old bug report from Hugo van der Sanden, in which he was misled by
the documentation (or rather, its ambiguity) to think that</p>

<pre>
  &quot;babadad&quot; =~ /^((.)?a\2)+$/</pre>
<p>should succeed. Other porters explained the reasoning behind the observed
behaviour, and it was agreed that the documentation needed to clarify this
issue.</p>
<p>And so it came to pass that Reini added a paragraph to <code>perlre</code>
to do just that. Bram considered the explanation without looking
at the bug report, and admitted that he didn't have a clue as to
what it meant.</p>

<p>As Bram continued his culling of RT issues, he came across the issue
of <code>qq[&gt;10\n] =~ /&gt;\d+$ \n/ix</code> failing, where the original ticket
author thought it should succeed.</p>
<p>As it turns out, on 5.10 and beyond, it does in fact succeed. But
then Bram thought it might be worthwhile checking what happens
when one omits the <code>/x</code> modifier, and was surprised to see that
it failed, along with four other variations on a theme.</p>
<p>Zefram explained that this was to be expected, since the lack
of spaces meant that &quot;dollar something&quot; turned into a real
Perl scalar that contained something completely different,
thus causing the match to fail.</p>

<p>Ren&#233;e B&#228;cker thought that a prototyped function that has no body
should be an error. Rafa&#235;l thought so too, but said that he needed
to think about the ramifications a bit more. In the meantime, Ren&#233;e
revised the path.</p>

<p>H.Merijn Brand was puzzled as to why Reini Urban had only recently

the code in question has been touched in over a year. Andy Dougherty
suspected that something must have changed in Reini's setup, to trigger
a walk down a previously unvisited codepath.</p>

<p>Reini concurred, saying that an upgrade to <em>cygwin2.dll</em> could have
changed the result from a <code>fflush(NULL)</code> call, which is what tripped up

<p>Goro Fuji reported an issue with <code>PerlIORaw_pushed()</code> and offered

<p>Sebastien Rodriguez suffered segmentation faults with 5.10 when
trying to use this module. Steve Peters built the module, and was
alarmed by the number of compiler warnings it emitted. He also
saw it fail an assertion.</p>
<p>&#198;var Arnfj&#246;r&#240; Bjarmason traced the problem down to the
fact that it used the PV slot of a GV to store a pointer to a custom
data structure, which reminded him of <code>Math::Pari</code> (another module
that gave the porters grief a few weeks back).</p>

<p>On IRC, the concensus was that it would be very difficult to
tweak the core to play nicely with the module, so the module will
just have to adapt. What is more, despite the extensive test
campaign that the porters conducted, it turns out that the test
suite itself was hopelessly inadequate, since it passed, and yet
the most basic real usage failed.</p>
<p>Which also meant that not a single person had tried 5.9.x with
the module in the months leading up to 5.10.</p>

him bonus points for taking the time to bisect the change log and isolate
the offending patch.</p>

<p>Armed with that information, Rafa&#235;l Garcia-Suarez was able to supply a patch
that fixed up the problem, but he had a sneaking feeling that it might
