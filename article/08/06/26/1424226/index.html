<p>The Pittsburgh Perl Mongers are hard at work planning this years Pittsburgh Perl Workshop. (We are also planing YAPC::NA 09 but more on that later. But go ahead and mark your calendars for June 22 through Wednesday, June 24, 2009). Mark your calendars this years PPW will be October 11th and 12th 2008.
<br> <br>
At this year YAPC::NA I was surprised at how much was going on before and after YAPC. So if you plan on coming to PPW and would like to have a hack-a-thon or something before or after the official PPW event and would like some help planing that let us know and we will do what we can.
<br> <br>
PPW09 will have more training, more fun, and more talks than every before but if you think we might be missing something send us a note about it and maybe we can make it happen. We can not make everyone's wishes come true but we would like to try.
<br> <br>
If you want to keep up with PPW announcements we have an announce mailing list <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/ppw-announce/">http://groups.google.com/group/ppw-announce/</a>.
<br> <br>
Also you can keep an eye on <a href="http://pghpw.org/">http://pghpw.org/</a>.
<br> <br>
If you want to contact the PPW organizers you can email us at  ppw-cabal at googlegroups.com.
<br> <br>
If you are interested being a sponsor you can contact us at sponsors at <a href="http://pghpw.org/">http://pghpw.org/</a>.
<br> <br>
This year we are going to be offering a speaker mentor program.  This is a chance to have someone work with you to polish your talk from idea to delivery.  If you are interested in being a mentor or being mentored please let us know.
<br> <br>
If you have already have a talk proposal you can send it to us now at ppw-proposals at googlegroups.com.</p>
