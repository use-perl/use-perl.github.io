<p> <em>Traditional exception handling is more like equipping each Klingon
with a dead-man's switch attached to a nuke. Dying by accident in
someone else's nuke blast would be a death without honor. So the
point of the Perl 6 exception model is to try to keep as many
warriors alive as long as possible in order to inflict the maximum
possible damage on the enemy, which is our highest goal, after
all. :)</em> -- Larry Wall, on the issue of dealing gracefully with
errors.</p></p>

<h2> <a name="io__dir_destructor"> <code>IO::Dir</code> destructor</a> </h2>
</p> <p>Peter Dintelmann looked at Zefram's fix for <code>IO::Dir</code> (which was
clobbering global variables like <code>$!</code>) and realised that the same
criticism could be levelled at <code>DirHandle</code>. So he adopted Zefram's
initial approach to <code>DirHandle</code> as well, and Steve Peters made
sure it got into blead.</p>

<h2> <a name="fatal_autodie_exception_hierarchies_for_perl_5">Fatal/autodie exception hierarchies for Perl 5</a> </h2>
</p> <p>Paul Fenwick laid out a more detailed description of his exceptions
hierarchy for Perl 5. chromatic thought that an attempt at hierarchies,
whether they be singly or multiply rooted, was doomed to failure. A
much better approach would be to define a set of roles, and any given
exception would implement one or more roles. Larry Wall explained what
was going on over in Perl 6 and detailed a most interesting shift in
the design philosophy of handling exceptions, in that errors are
treated as data rather than interruptions to control flow.</p>
<p>Mark J. Reed offered a useful Klingon directive (yIQap pagh yIHegh!).
Joshua ben Jore reminded people of the danger of inspecting <code>$@</code> and
wiping it in the process, thus resulting in a error-on-error condition
known as exception suicide. He went on to show how paranoid you
really need to be in order to avoid exceptions vanishing through
carelessness.</p>
<pre>
  they *are* out to get you

<p>
<h2> <a name="autodie_pm_design_questions"> <code>autodie.pm</code> design questions</a> </h2>
</p> <p>Paul, no Bruce, Fenwick had a couple of questions to ask the porters.
The first one was how to apply autodie semantics to <code>system</code>, which
is more difficult that one might imagine since it has some really
weird variant calling conventions. The second question was the
possibility to grant <code>autodie</code> core status at some point (the
problem being that it currently depends four non-trivial non-core
modules).</p>
<p>Roland Giersig accidentally opened old wounds asking why it couldn't
be possible to retrofit the new <code>autodie</code> semantics onto <code>Fatal</code>,
but Aristotle Pagaltzis and Abigail made short order of that issue.</p>

<p>Of the prerequisite modules needed by <code>autodie</code>, Roland thought that
<code>IPC::System::Simple</code> sounded like something useful in its own right.</p>
<p>As to the <code>system</code> issue, Abigail thought that it would be nice to
<code>autodie</code> along with the rest, as long as there was an <code>no autodie
'system'</code> escape hatch.</p>

<p>Paul, err Bruce, no Paul sneaked in a subsequent question, which was
should a bare <code>use autodie</code> enable the Fatality of everything it
knew how to lay its hands on, or just a conservative (but nevertheless
broad) subset. In other words, does it mean <code>use autodie ':all'</code> or
<code>use autodie ':default'</code>? The latter approach is innately conservative,
forcing the client code to ask explicitly for any semantics for which
no solid concensus has emerged.</p>
<p>Paul dumped his current thoughts into POD here:</p>
<pre>
  <a href="http://github.com/pfenwick/autodie/tree/master/DESIGN.pod">http://github.com/pfenwick/autodie/tree/master/DESIGN.pod</a> </pre>
<p>and admitted it would be better to put it in a wiki, but the tram he
was in at the time didn't have wireless (loser!).</p>

<p>Another issue (the bloke just kept sneaking them in) is that old
Fatal messages sucked the big one, and Paul wanted to make them
prettier in the new version. Aristotle Pagaltzis argued that their
ugliness had never hindered widespread adoption of the module in
the first place.  Therefore it was important to retain the bletcherously
ugly error messages of <code>Fatal</code>, and introduce soothing, elegant
messages in <code>autodie</code>, since that would only increase the velocity
of adoption of the latter. And you never could eliminate the
possibility that someone, somewhere, was scraping the exact output
of a Fatal error message.</p>

<h2> <a name="perl5opt__m_processed_after_command_line__m"> <code>PERL5OPT -M</code> processed after command line -M?</a> </h2>

</p> <p>David Golden was surprised to discover that the effect of a <code>-M</code>
switch in the <code>PERL5OPT</code> environment variable takes place after
a <code>-M</code> switch on the command line. And I imagine that few people
would have expected the contrary.</p>
<p>Rafa&#235;l Garcia-Suarez argued that it was intentional, since
traditionally, the command-line overrides the environment and
when one thinks about the precedence of module loading it sort
of makes sense. On the other hand <code>-T</code> gets noticed straight away.
David agreed that while that was useful behaviour, the inconsistency
bothered him.  What was lacking was the documentation that would
explain which switches overrode which context.</p>

<h2> <a name="more_results_from_llvm_gcc">More results from llvm-gcc</a> </h2>
</p> <p>Yuval Kogman reported on some research he had conducted with llvm-gcc
(the Low Level Virtual Machine project) by using it to compile the
5.10 perl codebase. He saw an improvement of around 15% (which is
a serious improvement) but had trouble trying to get XS modules to
work (which is a serious disadvantage). On the other hand, it may
open the door to putting Perl apps on Apple's iPhone, which earns
serious cred points in the mindshare department.</p>
<p>Steve Peters wanted to see how current Intel C++ and Sun Studio
fare, since they usually leave gcc in the dust.</p>

<h2> <a name="ruminations_on_devel__cover">Ruminations on <code>Devel::Cover</code> </a> </h2>
</p> <p>In a side remark on the Summer of code mentor applications starting
(and ending) next week thread, Paul Johnson, on the subject of
modules that maintain a rather incestuous relationship with the
core, said that for better or worse, <code>Devel::Cover</code> was destined
to remain a module that remained outside of core.</p>
<p>He admitted that while it would be nice to have someone step in and
fix up its breakage following significant changes to the core, he
was sufficiently lucid to realise that the resources available to
develop the core are thin, and that in releasing such a module, he
was responsible for expending the appropriate effort to keep it
working. Joshua ben Jore admitted that his love-hate relationship
with the core veered strongly to the hate side.</p>

<h2> <a name="____closure_semantics"> <code>??{ }</code> closure semantics</a> </h2>
</p> <p>Yuval Kogman also ran into some trouble in some hairy patterns using
<code>??{ }</code> constructs, and assumed it was a bug. Rafa&#235;l confirmed the
issue, saying that it was indeed a bug, Dave Mitchell knew about it,
and wanted to fix it. David Nicol asked if it was more difficult that
just incrementing the refcount on lexicals encountered within
<code>??{...}</code> constructs and maintaining a list of same to decrement
when the regexp goes out of scope, and Dave said yes.</p>

<h2> <a name="smoking_from_git">Smoking from GIT</a> </h2>
</p> <p>H.Merijn Brand idly wondered how we were supposed to smoke from a git
repository, since a nice monotonic sequence, a feature that endears us
to Perforce, is replaced by a SHA-1 digest that only an idiot savant
could love. Rafael sidestepped the issue by saying that the 'HEAD'
tag gets you what you need.</p>

<h2> <a name="_once__warnings_from_xs_modules_in_perl_5_10_0">'once' warnings from xs modules in perl 5.10.0</a> </h2>
</p> <p>Chia-liang Kao noticed that 5.10.0 spews out &quot;used only once:
possible typo&quot; where before silence used to reign. He wondered if
it was possible for the core to suppress the warning if it emanated
from an XS boot block.</p>

<p>Nicholas Clark thought that something needed to be done to address
the problem, so Chia-liang will file a bug next week.</p>

ask the porters for an idea of what really needs to be done. Even
TODOing the TODO would be helpful at this point).</p>

</p> <p>Following Craig A. Berry's belated follow-up on the change in <code>File::Copy</code>'s
behaviour, Charles Bailey, made an even more belated follow-up, and it was
full of good stuff. Charles explained the original rationale behind <code>copy</code>
and <code>syscopy</code> and how things have drifted over the years since the original
implementation was drafted.</p>

<p>He also agreed that the new changes were likely to cause trouble on non
POSIXish platforms. Abigail expressed surprise that the patch was even
accepted in the first place, given the provisos surrounding it (that it
was non-backwards compatible and that it was unclear what it would do on
non-POSIX platforms).</p>
<p>While no clear concensus emerged as to what should be done, most people
that commented suggesting that backwards compatibility was paramount, and
in any event the code needs a thorough overhaul.</p>

</p> <p>Robert Norris, who goes for tied file handles in a big way, delved into
the guts in order to allow <code>stat</code> and <code>-X</code> (where X is f, d, b, ...)
to do something sane. Rafa&#235;l Garcia-Suarez looked upon it favourably,
but waited to see if other people had any opinions, as he doesn't really
do tied handles at all.</p>

Ed Avis thought that /d would do just as well; the letter is not

having a generalised quoting mechanism for non-interpolating patterns,
&#224; la <code>q()</code> and <code>qq()</code>, so long as it didn't break any existing
code. Ed pointed out that <code>m/./d</code> was currently a syntax error.</p>

<p>Steve Peters reported that <code>Pod::Simple</code> was slightly broken for a
while since it initiated an undeclared dependency on <code>HTML::Parser</code>
in order to scoop out <code>decode_entites</code>. But everything was straightened
out in the end.</p>

<p>S&#233;bastien Aperghis-Tramoni realised that 0.25 had not made it into core,
which was a pity, since it contained fixes to all sorts of issues.</p>

<p>Nicholas went out for a smoke, and discovered lots of errors on
blead. S&#233;bastien was able to reduce the problem to a tiny test case
involving <code>constant</code>. After some more detective work, he confirmed
that there was a discrepancy between <code>ExtUtils::Constant</code> in blead
and on CPAN. And further that the discrepancy was an issue of proxy
subroutines.</p>

</dd>
<dd>
<p>This in turn led to the discovery that there wasn't any documentation
for <code>ExtUtils::Constant::ProxySubs</code>, which, at the very least, makes
it difficult for anyone to realise that it could be of any use.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Working together, S&#233;bastien and Nicholas ironed out all the bugs
that were deemed necessary to fix.</p>
