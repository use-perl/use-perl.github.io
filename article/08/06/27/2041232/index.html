<p><h1> <a name="this_week_on_perl5_porters___14_20_june_2008">This Week on perl5-porters - 14-20 June 2008</a> </h1><p>David Nicol: Does pushing all exceptions to @@ whenever $@ gets
assigned to break anything?</p><p>Abigail: In theory, it could, as @@ is a &quot;normal&quot; array that can
be used as such.  But I doubt anything serious will break. I'd say
anyone that uses a punctuation variable that currently has no special
meaning does so at his/her own risk, and doesn't have the right to
complain if it does get special meaning.</p><p>-- Abigail, suggesting that a little backwards compatibility
breakage from time to time can be good for the soul.</p></p>

<h2> <a name="module__build_changes_for_vms">Module::Build changes for VMS</a> </h2></p><p>Craig Berry sorted out the changes for <code>Module::Build</code> that had
made it to blead but not to the <code>M::B</code> repository, and tidied
them up so that Ken Williams could apply them with a minimum of
fuss.</p><p>

<h2> <a name="attempt_to_configure_under_bash_on_vms_results_">Attempt to Configure under Bash on VMS results.</a> </h2></p><p>John E. Malmberg, at a loss as to how to entertain himself, tried
to configure Perl using the GNV/bash subsystem on VMS. After examining
dozens of problems, he concluded that &quot;it looks like a bit of work
before VMS can run the UNIX configure script&quot;.</p><p>One fundamental problem is that the test programs are there to test
for C routines, but if Configure fails to spot the required header
file in the first place, it will skip the test altogether, even
though VMS compilers have ways of finding header files in all sorts
of VMS-specific ways.</p><p>Peter Prymmer suggested that a <em>hints/vms.sh</em> might allow a sane
GNV environment to be set up, which could improve Configure's
chances of success.</p><p>Paul Green, paramount wrangler of Perl on Stratus VOS suggested that
it was unlikely that pushing changes back to the <code>autoconf</code>
authors was a viable approach. He did that five years ago, and he's
still waiting for the changes to propagate out to various projects
that use it. He advised John to tweak the VMS to work with the
existing framework.</p><p>

in 5.10 to make <code>pack</code>/<code>unpack</code> self consistent. He wasn't sure
what technique should be used to ensure the same behaviour on
both versions of Perl; Nicholas Clark suggested side-stepping the
problem altogether.</p><p>

<h2> <a name="empty_regex">Empty regex</a> </h2></p><p>Alfie accidentally trod in a thread from last month concerning
the use of <code>qr/$var/</code> when <code>$var</code> is empty, thus reusing the
previous pattern used for matching.</p><p>This attracted a considerable amount of discussion, with
Yitzchak Scott-Thoennes contributing the following gem:</p><p>
<pre>
 my $x = qr//;
  ok(&quot;foo&quot; =~ /foo/ &amp;&amp; &quot;bar&quot; =~ /$x$x/);
  ok(&quot;foo&quot; =~ /foo/ &amp;&amp; &quot;bar&quot; =~ /$x/);</pre>

</p><p>in which the first test succeeds, and the second test fails.
Nicholas Clark wanted to know if there was a TODO for this
(Yitzchak thought probably not), and which behaviour was the
most desirable.</p><p>

<h2> <a name="how_to_dig_through_symbol_tables">How to dig through symbol tables</a> </h2></p><p>Sean O'Rourke was trying to inspect symbol tables, and noticed that
<code>*FOO{SCALAR}</code> was always defined, and wondered if that was because
he was prodding too hard. Ben Morrow confirmed that he was seeing
the expected behaviour, although Yitzchak Scott-Thoennes pointed
out that <code>PERL_DONT_CREATE_GVSV</code> changes the picture somewhat.</p><p>

<h2> <a name="a_project_to_get_perl_supported_on_google_app_engine">A Project to get Perl supported on Google App Engine</a> </h2></p><p>Steven Adkins mentioned the project (at this stage not much more
than a wish) to get Perl supported as a language for Google's
App Engine.</p><p>Not much came out of the discussion, apart from &#198;var Arnfj&#246;r&#240; Bjarmason
who asked if there was a precise description of the sandbox environment
the hosted applications would run in (such as no XS modules or system
calls).</p><p>

uninitialized value&quot; warnings with a simple code snippet. Dave
Mitchell fixed the problem a few hours later.</p><p>This inspired Nicholas Clark to go looking, and find a more devious
case that remained broken. Dave went looking and found a few more,
and theoretically nailed them all with an additional patch.</p><p>

codebase until Rafa&#235;l Garcia-Suarez gently explained that the
files didn't exist in the repository yet, given that the porters
had not yet switched over to git.</p><p>Sam Vilain, owner and manager of the git mirror of the Perforce
repository, outlined a mechanism he intended to put into place to
allow people to start using git now, while not interfering with
Perforce. Rafa&#235;l gave the approach the thumbs up.</p><p>

<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/gpjwx">http://xrl.us/gpjwx</a> </pre>

use a DNS resolver whenever it finds one, regardless of what

<code>$h{a}</code> and <code>$h{b}</code>, when it would have been nice not to. Ren&#233;e didn't
see why it should, but since it's been known about and relied upon for so

<h2> <a name="regexp_optimisation_affected_by_threads___55600_">Regexp optimisation affected by threads (#55600)</a> </h2></p><p>John Gardiner Myers had identified a problem with pattern matches
being performed slowly in threads, since a character class optimisation
was skipped. Dave Mitchell grovelled through the source and discovered
why the optimisation was suppressed, and why it wasn't be re-enabled.
Unfortunately Dave isn't familiar with this part of the code and
didn't want to hazard a fix.</p><p>

last week. Paul Johnson stopped by to comment that he hated the
linguistic drift that has made &quot;issue&quot; become synonymous with &quot;bug&quot;,
&quot;problem&quot; or &quot;question&quot;. (note to self: guilty as charged).</p><p>On a completely different note, Paul also thought that <code>autodie</code>

(the name, not the concept) is awful.</p><p>

<h2> <a name="h2xs_does_not_handle_properly_enum_constants___55896_"> <code>h2xs</code> does not handle properly enum constants (#55896)</a> </h2></p><p>Domi@hp reported an issue, no, <em>problem</em>, with XS bindings to interface
C code that uses <code>enum</code>s, and a pointer to a blog that provides
additional commentary.</p><p>Steve Peters thought that all the problems that were known at the time
the blog entry was written had been addressed, so he wasn't sure if it
was still relevant. But he did want to find out more about the specific
problem being encountered, in case there was more <code>enum</code> work that
needed doing.</p><p>

<h2> <a name="iteration_order_of_hash_keys_doesn_t_appear_random___55952_">Iteration order of hash keys doesn't appear random (#55952)</a> </h2></p><p>Jonathon Sailor wondered why hash keys were always iterated in the
same order, regardless of how <code>PERL_HASH_SEED</code> is set. Turns out the
documentation was wrong.</p><p>

Dougherty made a few educated guesses about what the problem was, and

figure what the problem was.</p><p>

box not being picked up. Andy explained that the problem was resolved
in 5.10 (which was released six months (!) ago). For people stuck with
5.8, the fix is simple, just requiring <em>/lib64</em> and <em>/usr/lib64</em> to
be specified during configuration.</p><p>

<h2> <a name="return_return___56150_"> <code>return return</code> (#56150)</a> </h2></p><p>Nicholas Clark wondered why this wasn't a syntax error. Rafa&#235;l
Garcia-Suarez showed him why it was a feature.</p><p>The thread then expanded into a very long discussion about the
(f)utility of using an explicit <code>return</code> statement.</p><p>
<pre>
  obviously you've never tried to return a reference to a hash

that <code>123 =~ /^(\d)(((??{1+$^N})))+$/ ? 1 : 0</code> return 0 or 1,
depending on whether one uses 5.10.0 or 5.11.0 (or any suitable
blead) to run the code. No replies, but it's obviously some sort of
regression that wasn't nailed down by a test.</p><p>
<pre>
  of course, it didn't work at all in 5.8

<h2> <a name="attempt_to_free_unreferenced_scalar__sv______56202_">Attempt to free unreferenced scalar: SV... (#56202)</a> </h2></p><p>Mike Capella reported a problem with an enormous list of <code>qr/.../o</code>
patterns producing some interesting emergent behaviour. Bram
suggested he get rid of the <code>/o</code> modifiers. Mike wanted to know the
reason but no-one clued him in. In the meantime, Mike came up with a
work-around, but since the appearance of the error seemed to be
dependent on the number of patterns used, he thought it indicated
some sort of overflow situation, should someone with the necessary
internals skills feel like looking into it.</p><p>

<h2> <a name="last_week_s_summary">Last week's summary</a> </h2></p><p>Jan Dubois picked up on last week's summary of why <code>IPC::Run</code> is preferable
to <code>system</code>, explaining that on Win32 it is rather inefficient as it depends
on additional helper processes to get the job done. As a result, the variable
<code>$^X</code> (the name of the current copy of Perl) doesn't contain what one might
expect.</p><p>An additional complication is that the exit status counter on Win32 is a 32-bit
quantity and thus does not even fit in <code>$?</code>. One solution would be to borrow
from VMS, and implement a sane <code>${^CHILD_ERROR_NATIVE}</code> variable.</p><p>Worse, if a child process returns -1... In certain circumstances,
the parent runs the child a second time.</p><p>And then they started talking about losing <code>$@</code> from an <code>eval</code> all over
again. Mark Mielke nailed the problem when he said that the problem is
that <code>$@</code> is a global, but <code>eval</code> is inherently recursive.</p><p>
