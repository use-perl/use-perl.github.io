<h2> <a name="rt_bugtrackers__note_the_changes_in_5_10">RT bugtrackers, note the changes in 5.10</a> </h2>
<p>H.Merijn Brand wished to draw attention to the main changes in the
more complex structures derived from an SV, so that people who were
going through tickets on RT would remember to keep an eye open for
the types of problems this might cause on badly-written XS code.</p>
<p>Nicholas Clark and Reini Urban pointed out a few more gotchas.</p>

<p>Ovid reported that a certain use of <code>overload</code> led to a segmentation
fault. Various people reported that various platforms did more or less
the same thing.</p>
<p>Rick Delaney solved the matter with with some minor changes to the
code, the test suite and the documentation. Rafael checked it in.</p>

<p>John E. Malmberg wanted to get <code>realpath</code> working on VMS, and wondered
what the cross-platform concensus was for dealing with path specifications
that don't exist. Once he had that information, he would be able to
decide what would be best for VMS.</p>
<p>Early feedback showed that different platforms handled John's examples
quite differently. Thus he felt free to go ahead and do what made
the most sense on VMS.</p>

<h1> <a name="todo_of_the_week">TODO of the week</a> </h1>
<p>A task that need a little sysadmin-type knowledge</p>
<p>
<h2> <a name="profile_perl___am_i_hot_or_not">Profile Perl - am I hot or not?</a> </h2>
<p>The Perl source code is stable enough that it makes sense to profile it,
identify and optimise the hotspots. It would be good to measure the
performance of the Perl interpreter using free tools such as cachegrind,
gprof, and dtrace, and work to reduce the bottlenecks they reveal.</p>
<p>As part of this, the idea of <em>pp_hot.c</em> is that it contains the <em>hot</em> ops,
the ops that are most commonly used. The idea is that by grouping them, their
object code will be adjacent in the executable, so they have a greater chance
of already being in the CPU cache (or swapped in) due to being near another op
already in use.</p>

<p>Except that it's not clear if these really are the most commonly used ops. So
as part of exercising your skills with coverage and profiling tools you might
want to determine what ops <em>really</em> are the most commonly used. And in turn
suggest evictions and promotions to achieve a better <em>pp_hot.c</em>.</p>
<p>One piece of Perl code that might make a good testbed is <em>installman</em>.</p>

<h1> <a name="patches_of_interest">Patches of Interest</a> </h1>
<p>
<h2> <a name="perlbug_prose_patch__and_some_evals__too_"> <code>perlbug</code> prose patch (and some evals, too)</a> </h2>
<p>It all started out when clkao wondered why it wasn't possible to set
the From: header on a perlbug report. Jesse Vincent thought &quot;ho ho ho,
a five-minute, one-line patch sent to perl5-porters coming up&quot;.</p>
<p>One Saturday afternoon later, Jesse sent in a 740 line patch that did
just about everything except just that, discovering that <code>perlbug</code>
was in desperate need for some tender loving care.</p>
<p>Ronald J. Kimball greeted the patch enthusiastically and went
through it with a fine-toothed comb adjusting various changes to
Jesse's prose.</p>
<p>Jesse was still a bit doubtful as to how to write a patch for a PL
file in the <em>utils/</em> directory (since said files are used to
generate the final program that gets installed). Craig A. Berry
hinted darkly at how things were done in concrete bunkers at
secret locations.</p>

<pre>
  now i have to kill you
  <a href="http://xrl.us/et7rk">http://xrl.us/et7rk</a> </pre>
<p>Jesse then set to work cleaning up the twisty maze of user
prompt routines, all alike. Rafael tried to apply the patch
but failed, since the target of Jesse's intentions was the
post-generated file. Jesse pointed Rafa&#235;l to the previous
patch that was to applied against <em>perlbug.PL</em>.</p>
<pre>
  perlbug prompting
  <a href="http://xrl.us/et7rp">http://xrl.us/et7rp</a> </pre>
<p>Jesse finished for the week by overhauling the code that does the
mailing of the bug report. Reini Urban suggested using <code>readline</code>,
to get rid of those pesky ^H characters that sometimes appear in
actual bug reports.</p>

<p>Jesse was hesitant to entertain the concept of optional dependencies
within <code>perlbug</code>, but admitted that at least things were getting
to the stage where such a change would not be the major surgery
that it would have been before he started cleaning things in the
first place.</p>
<pre>

<h2> <a name="perlsyn__equivalent_code_for_hash____array"> <code>perlsyn</code>: equivalent code for HASH ~~ ARRAY</a> </h2>
<p>brian d foy asked for clarifications on smart matching behaviour
just after 5.10.0 was released. He returned this week with a tweak
to the documentation.</p>

<p>
<h2> <a name="readable_assertion_names">Readable assertion names</a> </h2>
<p>Reini Urban went on a spring clean to strip out the metasyntactic
variable names used in assertion errors and replaced them with
names that conveyed useful information. Minor discussion followed
as to whether the macro names that Reini used would mask or shadow
real variable names, but Reini thought everything was safe.</p>
<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/et7r9">http://xrl.us/et7r9</a> </pre>
<p>He then carried on with the rest of the files and Rafa&#235;l applied
all of it.</p>

<p>
<h2> <a name="testing____with_in_memory_files">testing $/ with in memory files</a> </h2>
<p>Bram had worked out a patch some time ago that addressed this problem,
but had used <code>$ENV{_}</code> as a sneaky shortcut for the current process.
After it was pointed out that this was highly non-portable he had
switched to a more robust technique. Rafa&#235;l applied the latter
version, but in the meantime Bram had noticed that the patch ran into
difficulties with <code>-Uuseperlio</code>.</p>
<p>But that was ok, because Bram had a patch for that as well. So Rafa&#235;l
applied it too.</p>

<p>
<h2> <a name="more_cow_lvalues">More COW lvalues</a> </h2>
<p>Reini Urban used <code>-DPERL_DEBUG_COW</code> and found a couple of macros
that are used as lvalues. He was able to solve one issue easily,
since an assigning macro existed, but he was stuck as to how to
rewrite <code>SvIVX(sv_dat)++</code> in a safe manner.</p>
<p>Nicholas Clark had a look, and noticed that the end result boiled
down to <code>a = a + 1</code>, and gcc's optimiser (at least) reduced that
to the same assembly instructions as <code>a++</code> and concluded that it
was safe to use an apparently long-hand macro assignment, since it
would wind up as a simple post increment.</p>

  <a href="http://xrl.us/et7sq">http://xrl.us/et7sq</a> </pre>
<p>
<h2> <a name="_gitignore_file"> <em>.gitignore</em> file</a> </h2>
<p>Paul Fenwick develops with git, and thus is endlessly annoyed by
git moaning about files it encounters but doesn't know what to
do about them. So he wrote a crude <em>.gitignore</em> file to teach
git to not pay attention to them.</p>
<p>Rafa&#235;l had admitted planning doing such a thing, but was waiting
until 5.8.9 was out the door. At the same time, he thought there
existed a certain opportunity for factoring Paul's list through the
judicious use of wildcards.</p>

<p>Sam Vilain took Paul's list and laid some serious ignore-fu upon
it.</p>

<p>Bram made the distinction between <code>my $var : locked .= &quot;test&quot;</code> (a syntax

whether the inconsistency should remain.</p>

<p>Sebastien Rodriguez followed &#198;var Arnfj&#246;r&#240; Bjarmason's advice,
which seemed to be essentially a diagnosis of the problem, and reported
that things now worked. Hence his wish to contact the module author in order

<p>&quot;Fiji&quot; wondered why a simple call to <code>IPC::Open3</code> never has the
child's STDERR being connected to the lexical variable that is
supposed to hold it. Looking at the code, it was clear why it didn't
work, but the question was should the documentation be clearer, or
should the code be changed.</p>
<p>Bram thought that is was doubtful as to whether the behaviour could be
changed, since there may be people that have written code that depends
on how things work currently.</p>
<p>Ben Morrow agreed that refining the POD was the only course of action,
although Rafa&#235;l suggested that an API shift could be handled in
a dual-life version.</p>
<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/et7us">http://xrl.us/et7us</a> </pre>

<p>Ren&#233;e B&#228;cker supplied a patch to change the behaviour, and it
was up to Eric Brine to explain that the crux of the matter was that
the behaviour should not be changed. Instead, Eric showed how to
solve the problem with a teeny amount of client make-work code.</p>

<p>John Gardiner Myers showed that when the regular expression engine
is passed a pattern containing character classes (e.g. <code>[a-e]+</code>),
the performance becomes abysmal if the call is issued from within
a thread. John traced the problem to the code path not ever
hitting the <code>find_byclass</code> routine which causes it to rely much
more heavily on the backtracking mechanism.</p>

<p>Jason Van Dias sent in a reasonably concise test program that showed
how to generate a panic in perl 5.10.0. Nicholas Clark pointed him
to the latest source of the 5.10 track (which will become 5.10.1).</p>
<p>Jason took that for a spin, and the only result was that the coredump
message changed slightly. He had to tweak the Perl source slightly
to get it to work at all. He noted that everything was fine with 5.8.4
and 5.8.0 on other platforms.</p>

that both constructs are flawed, that the more robust <code>&lt;

leaving only the slightly horrendous <code>&quot;Dumpvalue&quot;-&gt;new()</code>.</p>
