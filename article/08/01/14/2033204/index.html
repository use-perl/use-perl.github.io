<div class="span8">
<p><p>With closing dates for the 2008 northern conference season coming up soon, I need to make a decision on what I do this year. My ideal situation would be, if only once, to do the entire trek starting at YAPC::NA, to OSCON, and then to YAPC::EU. After 5 years of blood sweat and tears with little time off, I could REALLY use a sabbatical.</p></p>
<p><p>
Lacking extreme amounts of cash, but with enough to be able to cover most flights and most meals, it is feasible. My goal is roughly to spend each week in a different city, heading in a generally eastwards direction from Sydney -&gt; US -&gt; Europe -&gt; Sydney.
</p>
<p>
So if you'd like to have me come to your city (anywhere in North America or Europe should be ok, and I have potential short stops in Asia (outbound and inbound flight changes) and I could probably be lured down to the top half of South America.
</p>
<p>
I intend to grab a round the world ticket to cover the main legs, with domestic hops in between. I don't really mind how big these detours are, especially if you can find a Perl-friendly company happy to pick the tabs for the detour flights.
</p>
<p>In exchange for a bed or a couch for the week, I'm happy to fill as many speaking engagements or hackathons in as you can schedule, and in the gaps I intend to hack on a variety of things that have been lacking attention. If I can find a chance to hook up with Perl 6 people, I wouldn't mind taking a stab at some Parrot/Perl6 toolchain stuff or a Perl 6 Win32 distribution as well.
</p>
<p>I've got around a week or so to finalize a list of cities that I can take to my travel agent and see if we can work this whole thing out, so feel free to spam your monger lists and see if they are interested.
</p>
<p>So, can I stay at your place?
</p></p>

<h2>Vienna</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/domm/">domm</a> on 2008-01-14T16:06:02</h3>
As I said allready, we can definitly find a bed for you in Vienna. Either at my place (sofa or bed in one kids room), or at somebody elses place...



<h2>Karlsruhe</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/tsee/">tsee</a> on 2008-01-14T17:50:02</h3>
I told you before that you're welcome in Karlsruhe, Germany. I don't know whether I can accomodate you for a full week*, but a couple of days is no problem at all. There are no Perl Mongers here who you could speak to, as far as I know. But quiet hacking time is in good supply.<br><br>Cheers,<br>Steffen<br><br>* Given that I probably can't take as much vacation...

I by no means expect you to take a whole week off work just for me<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br><br>I'm quite an experienced traveler, and I'm sure I can look after myself if you have to work.<br><br>Renee Baeker, when he was staying with me, mentioned that's 4 major cities in Germany for Perl (but I forget which off the top of my head).<br><br>Are you nearish to any of them?

<p>Basically, everything is "near" in Germany, if you don't mind 4 to 6 hours of train travel or by car. <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=de&amp;geocode=&amp;time=&amp;date=&amp;ttype=&amp;q=frankfurt+am+main&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;z=11&amp;iwloc=addr&amp;om=1" title="google.com">
Frankfurt (am Main)</a google.com> is the most central city because it has fast train connections to every major city in Germany (4 hours to <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=de&amp;geocode=&amp;time=&amp;date=&amp;ttype=&amp;q=hamburg&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;z=10&amp;iwloc=addr&amp;om=1" title="google.com">
Hamburg</a google.com>, 4 hours to <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=de&amp;geocode=&amp;time=&amp;date=&amp;ttype=&amp;q=m%C3%BCnchen&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;z=11&amp;iwloc=addr&amp;om=1" title="google.com">
Munich</a google.com>, 4 hours to <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=de&amp;geocode=&amp;time=&amp;date=&amp;ttype=&amp;q=berlin&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;z=10&amp;iwloc=addr&amp;om=1" title="google.com">
Berlin</a google.com>). I'm not sure which "four cities of Perl" Ren&#233;e meant - he lives near Frankfurt, Yves Orton lives in Frankfurt, as do I, and I know of people in Munich and Berlin who are active Perl Mongers.</p>

@Corion: I mentioned the same four cities as you did in your post: Frankfurt, Hamburg, Berlin and Munich.
<br> <br>
@Alias: I've sent you an email... I think I can host you a couple of days...

As Corion points out, there are quite a few mongers in Frankfurt. Frankfurt's about an hour by car or train from my place. I wouldn't be surprised if there were Stuttgart Perl Mongers, but haven't checked. Stuttgart is also about an hour. Munich is three. Berlin and Hamburg are rather far away.<br>

In which case it would both a) Appear that I have an airport to aim for b) I can do some warm up talks for Frankfurt.pm?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

<h2>SF welcomes you</h2>

<p>You're welcome to stay at my place here in San Francisco for a spell.  The quarters are quite small and meager, but I'd be happy to buy you a beer or two to compensate<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)  I'm sure we could get you an audience with SF.pm</p>



<h2>Barcelona</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/brunorc/">brunorc</a> on 2008-01-15T10:34:52</h3>
Drop me a note, if you would like to spend some days near the Mediterranean Sea<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;) And Barcelona.pm will be glad to see you!

"Forget it, Stavros..." - no, Sagrada Familia isn't finished yet. But you'll be able to see the difference<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

Let's hope the church doesn't break down with the soon-to-be-started works for a super-speed train which crosses the city underground, just a few centimeters from the church<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-/<br><br>Anyway, Barcelona Perl Mongers have been always eager to meet Perl travelers, so you'll be most welcome.
