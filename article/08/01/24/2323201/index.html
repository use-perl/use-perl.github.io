<p><p> <i>&quot;Shifting something that's not a number shouldn't produce a number.&quot;</i>
-- Abigail</p>

<p>
Here's a summary of what happened on perl5porters last week:
</p></p>
<p><h2> <a name="topics_of_interest">Topics of Interest</a> </h2>
<p>
<h3> <a name="grep_and_smart_match_should_warn_in_void_context"> <code>grep</code> and smart match should warn in void context</a> </h3>

</p> <p>Larry Wall remarked last week that Zefram's suggestion regarding
the propagation of context from <code>grep</code>s and <code>map</code>s was how he
deal with the matter. Nicholas spelled out his understanding of the
matter. Zefram ventured further into the internals than he had ever been
before and succeeded in returning with a patch to implement warnings in void
context.</p>
<p>Abigail thought that the exercise was a bit of a witch hunt but
Larry was thought that it was unlikely that people had used the
syntax intentionally, so the weight of backwards compatibility
was not so great, in this particular case.</p>
<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/betef">http://xrl.us/betef</a> </pre>
<p>
<h3> <a name="_inf___inf_and_nan__and_maybe__0_0_for_good_measure_"> <code>+Inf</code>, <code>-Inf</code> and <code>NaN</code> (and maybe -0.0 for good measure)</a> </h3>

</p> <p>In the thread about the latest <code>Math::Complex</code> release, Jarkko
Hietaniemi had noted that some platforms will dump core if you
try to perform floating point arithmetic on a value set to
infinity. Nicholas Clark wondered whether it was worth probing for
the behaviour of these special quantities at configuration time,
in order to Do The Right Thing on as many platforms as possible.</p>
<p>Zefram suggested peeking at <code>Data::Float</code>, which can already
isolate exotic floating point values in pure Perl. Craig Berry
pointed out that it wasn't so much a problem of arithmetic
<em>per se</em>, since just about everything in use today implements
IEEE 754 floats. It's not even a problem of exception handling,
since that is governed by the IEEE standard as well.</p>
<p>The tricky part is determining what exception handling is
enabled by default on a given platform, and what can be turned
on if you ask for it politely. His gave some pointers to
additional resources on the web regarding the matter.</p>
<pre>
  there's a point to all this
  <a href="http://xrl.us/beteh">http://xrl.us/beteh</a> </pre>

<p>
<h3> <a name="inconsistent_bigint_behaviour__with_ranges_">Inconsistent bigint behaviour (with ranges)</a> </h3>
</p> <p>Moritz Lenz ran into difficulties using the range (<code>$x .. $y</code>)
operator appearing to use floating point numbers instead of
integers (and hence, bigints). Tels was quick to point out that
this was due to a long-standing bug in perl: one cannot
overload the <code>..</code> operator. The <code>bigint</code> package could do so
if it were possible, but alas, the implementation is not there yet.</p>
<pre>
  want your 15 minutes of fame?
  <a href="http://xrl.us/betej">http://xrl.us/betej</a> </pre>

<p>Jerry D. Hedden wrote a patch to make the range operator behave
in a slightly more sane manner, and this was applied by Rafael.</p>

<p>
<h3> <a name="implementation_of_rand___in_perl_5_8_8">Implementation of <code>rand()</code> in Perl 5.8.8</a> </h3>
</p> <p>Dennis Williams wanted to implement <code>rand</code> in Java and wondered how
it was defined (having become lost after wading through some 18000
lines of the <em>Configure</em> shell script.</p>

<p>Robin Barker told him how Configure chooses the best available
implementation. Bennett told him how to find out what was chosen.</p>
<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/beteo">http://xrl.us/beteo</a> </pre>
<p>
<h3> <a name="inf____1"> <code>Inf</code> &gt;&gt; 1</a> </h3>
</p> <p>Abigail was rather surprised to discover that left- or right-shifting
infinity returns merely a really huge number, rather than infinity.
And shifting <code>NaN</code> produces zero.</p>

<p>Zefram explained that infinity only really works when dealing with
floating point numbers, and bit-shifting a floating point number
would probably do no good to anyone. And the shift operators force
integer context anyway. Tels was happy to report that <code>bigint</code>
gets it right.</p>
<p>Yitzchak Scott-Thoennes argued that it made sense to allow infinity
to be shifted down among the integers. David Nicol did not agree
with this and suggested that the way things were currently made
some sort of sense.</p>
<p>Zefram came back and said that it was probably too late to try and
be more strict on the matter: no doubt there's someone out there
who's relying on the property that 3 &#62;&#62; 1 == 1. Roland
Giersig wondered what Inf &#62;&#62; Inf and Inf &#60;&#60; Inf
should return, to which Zefram made a reasonable proposition.</p>
<pre>
  and I thought they said Perl was for text processing
  <a href="http://xrl.us/beteq">http://xrl.us/beteq</a> </pre>

<p>Continuing in a numerical recipes vein, Nicholas reported that he
had committed a change that will generate a warning if code tries
to increment or decrement an integer beyond the last possible
integer representation.</p>
<pre>
  at the end of the line
  <a href="http://xrl.us/betes">http://xrl.us/betes</a> </pre>
<p>Unfortunately, Andreas K&#246;nig was able to foil this plan with
the careful application of the <code>-O2</code> optimisation switch. This
caused <code>t/op/inc.t</code> to begin to fail. Nicholas Clark couldn't
see a way to sneak a couple of instructions past the compiler to
make it do the right thing. Jerry D. Hedden also found that it
warned about things that we really don't care about.</p>
<pre>
  back to the drawing board
  <a href="http://xrl.us/beteu">http://xrl.us/beteu</a> </pre>

<p>
<h3> <a name="mime_types_for_module_data">MIME types for module data</a> </h3>
</p> <p>Mark Overmeer wondered if there was some overall MIME type available
for Perl that would allow module slinging around private data sets
in a more orderly manner. Zefram gave an example of what an
officially sanctioned IANA MIME type would look like. Mark wondered
if you would have to pay a visit to IANA for each module.</p>
<pre>
  is this free as in beer?
  <a href="http://xrl.us/betew">http://xrl.us/betew</a> </pre>
<p>
<h3> <a name="onto_perl_5_8_9__perl___32984_">Onto perl 5.8.9 (Perl @ 32984)</a> </h3>
</p> <p>Nicholas Clark took a snapshot of the maintenance track to see how it
would fare as a putative 5.8.9. He was hoping such a thing could be
released before the German Perl Workshop, 5.10.1 or Christmas.</p>

<p>Windows is behaving pretty well at the moment, thanks to Steve Hay's
tireless smoking. Other platforms were doing less well: VMS was grumpy
although Craig Berry and John E. Malmberg were on hand to smooth
over the rough bits.</p>
<p>David Cantrell noted severe breakage on a Cray, a Silicon Graphics
IRIX box and NetBSD/Alpha as well.</p>
<pre>
  in need of TLC
  <a href="http://xrl.us/bete2">http://xrl.us/bete2</a> </pre>
<p>In fact, IRIX cannot compile 5.10.0, for that matter.</p>
<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/bete4">http://xrl.us/bete4</a> </pre>
<p>Jerry D. Hedden also wondered about how the maint patch level
should be defined in <em>patchlevel.h</em>.</p>

<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/bete8">http://xrl.us/bete8</a> </pre>
<p>
<h3> <a name="c_for_perl_programmers">C for Perl programmers?</a> </h3>
</p> <p>Michael G. Schwern asked how a Perl programmer who knows no C might
go about picking it up. A number of techniques were suggested, and
books proposed.</p>

</p> <p>Aristotle Pagaltzis wanted <code>foo 1, 2, 3, 4 { say @_ }</code> to do
something nifty, given an appropriate <code>foo</code> routine. Rafael
nodded and said it would be nice to have.</p>

<h3> <a name="named_parameters___prototypes___methods___aliases">named parameters + prototypes + methods + aliases</a> </h3>
</p> <p>The thread on naming subroutine parameters continued on this week
with all sorts of syntax ideas and semantic considerations bandied
about.</p>
<p>Rafael brought it down to earth with the restating of the
aliasing syntax that has been proposed in the TODO list for a long
time.  The best aspect of his proposal was that it was simple
enough to stand a reasonable chance of being implemented.</p>

<h3> <a name="empty_attributes">Empty attributes</a> </h3>
</p> <p>As part of the named parameters thread, Peter Scott wondered
why <code>my $x := 24</code> compiled and ran normally. It turns out
that it's being parsed as an empty attribute list. So it's
allowed, but it does absolutely nothing. Peter wondered
why it was so. No-one was able to give an explanation.
Rafael thought it was a parser bug until Peter pointed to
the tests that pin down the behaviour.</p>

<h3> <a name="recurse_into_current_qr__">Recurse into current <code>qr//</code> </a> </h3>

</p> <p>Moritz Lenz has started to play with the new <code>(?R)</code> recursive
sub pattern and was saddened to discover that it couldn't
recurse across a <code>qr</code> boundary.</p>
<p>Yves Orton didn't dismiss the idea out of hand, but said that it didn't
weigh much against his current list of priorities. The best chance
of it happening would depend on what Dave Mitchell and he planned
to do to the regexp engine in the future.</p>
<pre>
  maybe we'll get it for free
  <a href="http://xrl.us/betfv">http://xrl.us/betfv</a> </pre>
<p>

<h3> <a name="tail_calls_for_methods">Tail calls for methods</a> </h3>
</p> <p>Yuval Kogman noted that it was difficult to do tail recursion
cleanly in Perl, and suggested that with a dash of <code>tailcall</code>
syntactic sugar, it would allow the compilation phase to do the
right thing. Part of the problem concerns what to do with <code>caller</code>,
which was covered in a thread a few weeks ago.</p>
<p>Jim Cromie restated his op mashup idea, of combining adjacent
<code>leavesub</code>/<code>entersub</code> ops. Nicholas Clark thought that it
could be prototyped using an external XS module.</p>

<p>
<h3> <a name="a_working_super">A working SUPER</a> </h3>
</p> <p>Johann Vromans lamented that <code>SUPER</code> referred to the superclass(es)
of the package, and not that or those of the object. Stevan Little
thought that the new MRO infrastructure in 5.10 may be of some help.</p>
<p>Some people mentioned <code>NEXT</code> as coming close, but a common theme was
that it was too slow. At the end of the week, no real concensus had
been reached.</p>

<pre>
  that's really super, super-girl
  <a href="http://xrl.us/betfz">http://xrl.us/betfz</a> </pre>
<p>
<h3> <a name="clean_up_dereferencing_syntax_for_slices">Clean up dereferencing syntax for slices</a> </h3>
</p> <p>Curtis &quot;Ovid&quot; Poe proposed a simplification for slicing arrays
and hashes. Everyone agrees the current syntax, especially when
references come into the picture, is pretty horrendous.</p>
<p>Ricardo Signes found the fatal flaw, and so Ovid suggested a more
alien syntax with a sigil after the arrow, which made Ricardo
wonder if it couldn't be done with an autoboxed method, at the
expense of a bit of verbiage.</p>
<p>Zefram found the fatal flaw in that idea: if the thing being
sliced is a blessed reference then the method resolution may
call something else.</p>

<h3> <a name="2__inf_and_beyond">2..Inf and beyond</a> </h3>
</p> <p>The thread continued this week, with the more pragmatic porters
pointing out that one should really use a <code>while(1)</code> loop and
increment a counter variable each time through the loop. Michael
G. Schwern said that was okay if you were used to procedural
languages, but if all you had ever known were Perl ranges it
would be nice if they did the right thing.</p>

<p>At the end of thread, people started to coalesce upon the idea
of an new internal type that would provide a direct connection
to a bigintish datatype, be it a fast C library like GMP or a
slower pure-Perl implementation.</p>

</p> <p>Imacat offered to take over the maintenance of <code>Test::Harness::Straps</code>
(insofar as this involves watching over a dying patient and waiting until
it is safe to pull the plug on the life support systems, and made an
impassioned plea defending her approach to smoke testing CPAN modules.</p>

<p>Apart from that, the thread devolved into your standard argument
regarding <code>Module::Build</code> <em>versus</em> <code>ExtUtils::MakeMaker</code>. Everyone
remained very polite, more credit to the porters, but the reader
must forgive the summariser for not going into more detail than
saying that the versions of the CPAN shell bundled
with older releases of Perl are the root of many problems @@@FIXME@@@</p>
<p>One new item to come out the discussion, however, was Michael G.
Schwern's observation that <code>Module::Build</code>'s auto-generated <em>README</em>
was pretty hopeless, yet it would be a Simple Matter Of Programming
to make it do a better job.</p>

<p>H.Merijn Brand tried building perl on Cygwin and ran into trouble.
Reini Urban stepped up to help him out, offering a few suggestions
every Cygwin blead smoker needs to know.</p>

<p>Jerry D. Hedden had a pile of taint test fixes for Cygwin, and this
made all the tests pass. This made Nicholas Clark happy.</p>

<p>David Landgren wondered whether <code>is</code> behaved correctly for
tied objects when one needs to write <code>ok($x == 1)</code> instead
of <code>cmp_ok($x, '==', 1)</code> but received no reply.</p>

  fringe benefits
  <a href="http://xrl.us/bethc">http://xrl.us/bethc</a> </pre>
<p>Jan Dubois noted that <code>File::GlobMapper</code>, part of the <code>IO::Compress</code>
infrastructure, should not be marked as an alpha release (since it's now
in 5.10). Paul Marquess agreed, and promised to push out a new version,
<em>sans</em> the message of doom.</p>
<pre>
  good thing it's dual-lifed

<p>S&#233;bastien Aperghis-Tramoni found a small bug in microperl
regarding <em>uconfig.h</em>; Steve Peters regenerated it into a healthy
state.</p>
<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/bethg">http://xrl.us/bethg</a> </pre>
<p>Steven Schubiger thought that the documentation for <code>sv_cmp_locale</code>
should not say &quot;see also <code>sv_cmp_locale</code>&quot;. Not applied.</p>
<pre>

  recursion: see recursion
  <a href="http://xrl.us/bethi">http://xrl.us/bethi</a> </pre>
<p>Salvador Fandi&#241;o wondered if the new hints infrastructure could
help solve the bug regarding overloading constants not propagating
into string <code>eval</code>s.</p>

  <a href="http://xrl.us/bethk">http://xrl.us/bethk</a> </pre>
<p>Jan Dubois reported that <code>Compress::Zlib</code> 1.42 was failing tests
on both blead and maint, and pointed to an older thread on the
matter. Nicholas Clark backed the change out of maint.</p>

<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/bethn">http://xrl.us/bethn</a> </pre>
<p> <code>Text::Balance</code> received a better version number in maint.</p>
<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/bethp">http://xrl.us/bethp</a> </pre>
<p>Nicholas also suggested that distinguishing between <code>use warnings</code>
and <code>use warnings 'all'</code> would allow the porters to ease the
restrictions in adding new warnings to maintenance releases.</p>

<pre>
  it never used to do that!
  <a href="http://xrl.us/bethr">http://xrl.us/bethr</a> </pre>
<p>Johan Vromans complained about smoke runs complaining about inconsistent
test results between TEST and harness. Some tests are known to be very
sensitive to timing issues and system load. So the tests should either
go, or be marked as informational (and thus insufficient grounds for
aborting a launch).</p>
<pre>
  all systems go
  <a href="http://xrl.us/betht">http://xrl.us/betht</a> </pre>
<p>While hacking on kurila, Gerard Goossen spotted what he thought may
be a latent bug in the routine <code>do_openn</code> in <em>doio.c</em>, and thought
someone more intimate with the code should see if it was a problem.</p>

<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/bethv">http://xrl.us/bethv</a> </pre>
<p>He also proposed a patch, not applied, that would cause <code>-DT</code>
to report forced tokens (during tokenisation).</p>
<pre>
  what you always wanted to know
  <a href="http://xrl.us/bethx">http://xrl.us/bethx</a> </pre>
<p>Andrea K&#246;nig produced a patch for <code>YAML::Syck</code> to make it aware
of the 5.11 native REGEXP type. Audrey Tang took the patch and pushed
version 1.01 out the door. Michael G. Schwern thought the patch was
a bit clunky, but Nicholas pointed out that the way it was written
prevents dead code from forming in 5.10 and below.</p>

<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/bethz">http://xrl.us/bethz</a> </pre>
<p>Jerry D. Hedden uncovered a problem with a target needed for <code>suidperl</code>.
Even though the resulting binary is vaguely deprecated, Nicholas Clark
managed to get thing running smoothly again.</p>
<pre>
  until the next time it breaks
  <a href="http://xrl.us/beth3">http://xrl.us/beth3</a> </pre>
<p>Jerry noted that the change didn't make it past the door.</p>
<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/beth5">http://xrl.us/beth5</a> </pre>

<p>David Cantrell wanted to be able to <code>lchown</code> in perl 5.12, so Yitzchak
wrote a patch to do it for him.</p>
<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/beth7">http://xrl.us/beth7</a> </pre>
<p>Nicholas Clark had a bit of trouble fiddling with version numbers
in <code>Test::Harness</code>, as there are now three active branches in
the repository.</p>
<pre>
  head, explodes
  <a href="http://xrl.us/beth9">http://xrl.us/beth9</a> </pre>

<p>Johnathon Rockway related a question from the <code>perl-qa</code> mailing list,
as it relates to <code>is_deeply</code> and <code>qr//</code> on 5.11</p>
<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/betib">http://xrl.us/betib</a> </pre>
<p>Nicholas saw how <code>itersave</code> in used <code>struct block_loop</code>, but wondered
why, and whether it was ever, or still, necessary.</p>
