I'm not affiliated with <a href="http://jobs.perl.org/">jobs.perl.org</a>, and this is only the simplest of analyses. I didn't try to correct for duplicate posts where the same job was re-advertised. <a href="http://jobs.perl.org/about/stats">jobs.perl.org has their own stats</a>, although <a href="http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.jobs.discuss/2007/01/msg1642.html">Dave Rolsky seemed to think my numbers might be better</a>. I don't know if I believe him. :)
</p>

<p>
I don't attempt to draw any conclusions about the popularity (up or down) of Perl from these numbers. In general, I think that the continual uptrend is more about people finding out about the free service than the same market having more jobs.
</p>

<p>
I made <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/brian_d_foy/journal/32142">this same report in 2006 too</a>, and there are some interesting links in the comments. Also interesting is <a href="__SLASHLINK__" sect="mainpage" sid="07/09/14/0027216" sn="article" tid="34">renodino's graphs about jobs on Dice</a> and the <a href="http://www.perlmonks.com/?node_id=638927">code he wrote to make them</a>, along with the discussion about the usefulness of any conclusions.

I haven't done anything tricky to pull apart the actual jobs, but I expect the number of unique job sources is up too.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

"perl Jobs market is growing and stifled only by the time it takes to train new blood"
<p>
Yes, there has certainly been a lot of stability in Perl jobs recently.  It's good to be busy, but the difficulty of finding qualified Perl programmers combined with the steep learning curve for the rest carries with it the temptation to develop new projects in other languages and keep the slim Perl staff busy with maintenance of existing code.<br>  That is a dangerous trend, which I observe in my company.  I hope many of you are seeing the opposite.</p>

Actually, I see the opposite trend. More and more new projects starting in Perl, thanks to new and better modules. Again, a tribute to CPAN.<br><br>My fear is that the pool of well behaving Perl developers is drying out, and companies have to depend on people coming from the Java world with lower standards for code quality.

That's very encouraging to hear indeed.<br>
And an interesting point regarding the shrinking numbers of well behaved Perl developers.  Why do you think that is?

<h2>Re:works for me</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/chromatic/">chromatic</a> on 2008-01-03T19:32:00</h3>
<p>From the rumors I hear, well-behaved Perl developers aren't willing to work in,  for example, London for 30k quid.</p>



<h2>Re:works for me</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/kaare/">kaare</a> on 2008-01-03T22:44:31</h3>
Sorry, it should read "<b>free</b> well behaved Perl developers"<p>

Meaning that it's hard to find Perl people for jobs now; they (we) are all busy.</p>

What steep learning curve?<br><br>do you think the current crop of experienced perl developers battled a steep learning curve, or got hooked because the curve was so shallow and easy to climb?<br><br>I haven't had any difficulty in training new perl programmers, the excellent Learning Perl and Perl Cookbook can get a complete newbie up to speed and productive quite quickly with only minimal review and supervision.

Just an FYI RE: The <a href="http://www.presicient.com/langjobs.html" title="presicient.com">Dynamic Languages Jobs Barometer</a presicient.com>:
The current numbers vs. baseline numbers have been way off the last week, presumably due to the holidaze. It'll be interesting to see how they rebound, tho.

<p>
Also, here's <a href="http://www.zedshaw.com/rants/rails_is_a_ghetto.html" title="zedshaw.com">someone </a zedshaw.com>who's looking for a job. Perhaps someone can help this poor Rails refugee out ?
