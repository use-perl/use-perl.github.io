<p>I'm spending a big chunk of Spring 2008 in Northwestern Europe, and I want to make it around to as many Perl Mongers groups as I can. I can do any of the talks I've done before, or come up with something out of <i>Mastering Perl</i> given enough notice.<br> <br>Looking at <a href="http://www.theperlreview.com/community_calendar">The Perl Review Community Calendar</a>, here's how I think it might work out:<br> <br> <ul> <li>April - Nordic Perl Workshop in Stockholm???<br> </li> <li>April 24-27 Germany somewhere (talk to Ren&#233;e B&#228;cker)<br> </li> <li>April 28-May 2 Frankfurt for Big Nerd Ranch's <a href="http://www.bignerdranch.com/schedule.shtml">Perl Bootcamp</a> <br> </li> <li>May 2 - May 4 Germany somewhere (talk to Ren&#233;e B&#228;cker)<br> </li> <li>May 6 - Amsterdam.pm<br> </li> <li>May ?? - Paris.pm<br> </li> <li>May ?? - London.pm<br> </li> <li>May 13 - Brussels.pm<br> </li> <li>May  21 - Vlaanderen.pm<br> </li> <li>May 27th-ish - Geneva.pm<br> </li> <li>May 29th-ish - Northern Italy?<br> </li> </ul> <br> <br>I've created the <a href="http://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=0mn6eufk5ohctvqetkh9r2crpk%40group.calendar.google.com&amp;ctz=America/Tegucigalpa">brian d foy's European Perl Tour Google Calendar</a> to help me figure it all out. If your group would like me to visit, let's figure out when I can fit it in.<br> <br>And, I would certainly appreciate anything a Perl Mongers group might be able to do to help me pay the expenses of visiting them. That will mostly be a train ride from Lille. I'm also interested in doing full day Perl master classes (for pay) in any of the nearby cities.</p>

<h2>Vienna</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/domm/">domm</a> on 2008-01-07T14:42:20</h3>
We'd love to meet you in Vienna! Our regular meetings happen on the first Monday each month, so 5th May or 2nd June would be convenient. But of course we'd host an emergency meeting on any other day.<br/><br/>Vienna.pm can also pay for your train/plain ticket.

I'd like to come to Vienna, too, but I think that it's too far away. I have to be back in Lille every couple of days, and once I finish in Frankfurt I start traveling northwest so I end up in Lille. Once there, I have time for short day trips that I can take on a train (because anything involving an airport sucks away precious hours).<br><br>If it doesn't work out this spring, it might work out next year<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

<h2>Milan</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/alessio/">alessio</a> on 2008-01-20T16:24:25</h3>
Hi brian,<br>I'd love to organise an event for Italian Perl Mongers in Milan. I expect Milan to be the easiest to get to, and at this moment (winter timetable) there is an airline flying Lille-Milan every couple of days.<br><br>Is it going to be on May 29th, you prefer another date?
