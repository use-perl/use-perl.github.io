<p><p>
The latest release of <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/stevan/Moose-0.34/">Moose</a> (0.34) brings with it some very nice features as well as a major re-factoring of the role system (I am finally happy with the design now too) and a re-factoring of the parameterized types. While most of the information on the new features is in the <a href="http://search.cpan.org/src/STEVAN/Moose-0.34/Changes">Changes</a> file, I figured that they are cool enough to be blog-worthy too, so here goes:
</p></p>
<p><p>
<b>New Maybe[`a] parameterized type</b>
</p>
<p>
The handling of parameterized types has been re-factored so that it is now possible to add new parameterized types without needing them to be based off the ArrayRef or HashRef type (no syntactic sugar yet though). As a demonstration of this, and because it's just a useful thing anyway I have added the Maybe[`a] type. This type basically means "maybe there will be a value, and if there is, it will be of type `a", users of Haskell will be familiar with this (as will O'Caml users, it is similar to the 'option' type). Here is an example of the usage:
</p> <p><blockquote> <div> <tt>package Person;<br>use Moose;<br> <br>has 'first_name'&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;=&gt; (is =&gt; 'rw', isa =&gt; 'Str');<br>has 'last_name'&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; =&gt; (is =&gt; 'rw', isa =&gt; 'Str');<br>has 'middle_initial' =&gt; (is =&gt; 'rw', isa =&gt; 'Maybe[Str]');</tt> </div> </blockquote>  <p>
The 'middle_initial' attribute now allows either a string or an undefined value to be stored.
</p>
<p>
<b>Role method exclusion and aliasing</b>
</p>
<p>
Role composition follows a strictly defined set of rules, this is one of the benefits of roles over your basic mix-ins or multiple inheritance. But sometimes, you want to subvert those rules and have more control over the composition process. The <a href="http://www.iam.unibe.ch/user/scg/Research/Traits/">original Traits paper</a> (on which Roles are based) included both 'exclusion' and 'aliasing' operations as a way of modifying the composition process. I included these features when I originally wrote <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Class-Trait/">Class::Trait</a>, but since @larry had not added them into Perl 6 I hadn't included support in <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/stevan/Moose-0.34/">Moose</a>. Now after several months of using Roles I now see the original wisdom of the Traits paper authors and these features are now available in <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/stevan/Moose-0.34/">Moose</a>. Here are some examples of usage:
</p>
<p>
Lets create an Equality role, which provides the mechanism for determining, well, equality.</p> <p><blockquote> <div> <tt>package Equality;<br>use Moose::Role;<br> <br>requires 'equal';<br>sub not_equal { not((shift)-&gt;equal(@_)) }</tt> </div> </blockquote> Now lets define two more roles which do the Equality role, first a 'HasColor' role:<p><blockquote> <div> <tt>package HasColor;<br>use Moose::Role;<br> <br>with 'Equality';<br> <br># create an attribute to hold RGB values<br>has 'rgb' =&gt; (is =&gt; 'rw', isa =&gt; 'ArrayRef[Int]');<br> <br>sub equal { ... code to compare RBG values ... }</tt> </div> </blockquote> And now a 'HasCoordinate' role<p><blockquote> <div> <tt>package HasCoordinate;<br>use Moose::Role;<br> <br>with 'Equality';<br> <br># create an attribute to hold x/y values<br>has 'coord' =&gt; (is =&gt; 'rw', isa =&gt; 'ArrayRef[Int]');<br> <br>sub equal { ... code to compare x/y values ... }</tt> </div> </blockquote> Now if my 'Pixel' class wanted to use both the 'HasColor' and 'HasCoordinate' roles, ...<p><blockquote> <div> <tt>package Pixel;<br>use Moose;<br> <br>with 'HasColor', 'HasCoordinate';</tt> </div> </blockquote> I would have a problem because their 'equal' methods would conflict. The conflict means that the 'Pixel' class must then implement an 'equal' method of it's own. I could implement it like so:<p><blockquote> <div> <tt>sub equal {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; my ($self, $other) = @_;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; $self-&gt;HasColor::equal($other) &amp;&amp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; $self-&gt;HasCoordinate::equal($other);<br>}</tt> </div> </blockquote> but the hardcoding of role names like this is a design smell IMO. We also have lost color and coordinate comparison abilities in our 'Pixel' class. Here is a different approach using exclusion and aliasing to provide (IMO) a much superior solution.
 <p><blockquote> <div> <tt>package Pixel;<br>use Moose;<br> <br>with 'HasColor' =&gt; {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; excludes =&gt; 'equal',<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; alias&nbsp; &nbsp; =&gt; { equal =&gt; 'color_equal' }<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;},<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'HasCoordinate' =&gt; {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; excludes =&gt; 'equal',<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; alias&nbsp; &nbsp; =&gt; { equal =&gt; 'coord_equal' }<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;};<br> <br>sub equal {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; my ($self, $other) = @_;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; $self-&gt;color_equal($other) &amp;&amp; $self-&gt;coord_equal($other);<br>}</tt> </div> </blockquote>  <p>
The above code now removes the conflict between the 'equal' methods, but aliases them so that the features are not lost and finally implements equals in terms of them.
</p>
<p>
Of course this example is a little on the contrived side, but you get the point. Anyone who has messed around with roles enough will surely rejoice at this new feature addition.
</p>
<p>
<b>Attribute Metaclass traits</b>
</p>
<p>
We already have support for custom attribute metaclasses and this feature is used in a number of modules, <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/MooseX-Getopt/">MooseX::Getopt</a>, <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/MooseX-Storage/">MooseX::Storage</a> and <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/MooseX-AttributeHelpers/">MooseX::AttributeHelpers</a> to name a few. It allows you to extend the features of <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/stevan/Moose-0.34/">Moose</a> attributes to provide additional functionality within the same <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/stevan/Moose-0.34/">Moose</a> framework. The one problem with this feature has always been that it is very difficult to combine these extensions and use more than one at a time. Here is a (very contrived) example of how this feature will be useful.
</p> <p><blockquote> <div> <tt>package My::App;<br>use Moose;<br>use MooseX::Storage;<br>use MooseX::Getopt;<br> <br>has 'some_thing' =&gt; (<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; traits =&gt; [qw/DoNotSerialize NoGetopt/],<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; is&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;=&gt; 'rw',<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; isa&nbsp; &nbsp; =&gt; 'ArrayRef[Big::Heavy::Things]',<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; # ...<br>);</tt> </div> </blockquote>  <p>
Currently <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/MooseX-Storage/">MooseX::Storage</a> provides a DoNotSerialize metaclass which lets the <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/MooseX-Storage/">MooseX::Storage</a> engine know to skip that attribute when serializing. This is fine, until you need to also use the <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/MooseX-Getopt/">MooseX::Getopt</a> provided NoGetopt metaclass (which, yes you guessed it, tells <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/MooseX-Getopt/">MooseX::Getopt</a> that this is not a command line parameter). I will soon be releasing versions of those two modules which will make the above example work, allowing you to easily combine both non-serialization with non-getopt-parsing. (Sorry, that was the best example I could come up with right now, we are working on a possible cookbook entry so if this interests you keep you eyes out).
</p>
<p>
<b>And lastly ...</b>
</p>
<p>
And lastly, in addition to all this new functionality, I would like to announce the upcoming release of MooseX::Compile 0.01 (possibly by tomorrow morning). MooseX::Compile is a project here at $work which takes all the stored meta-information of a <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/stevan/Moose-0.34/">Moose</a> class and compiles a .pmc file which defers loading the bulk of the <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/stevan/Moose-0.34/">Moose</a> infrastructure and caches the already computed metaclasses. It is still in it's very early stages, and only supports a subset of <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/stevan/Moose-0.34/">Moose</a>, but results are extremely promising.
