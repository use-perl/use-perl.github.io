<h2> <a name="more_c_for_perl_programmers">More C for Perl programmers</a> </h2>
<p>The &quot;I know Perl, how to learn C&quot; thread continued this week with a number
of book and and web site references given. The thread then veered off into
a discussion of memory alignment issues, what is a word (in computer
memory parlance) and other sundry technical arcana of great interest to
C programmers. Many people pointed out (quite rightly) that K&amp;R is still
a very good read.</p>

<h2> <a name="regression_with_autobox">Regression with autobox</a> </h2>
<p>Alexandr Ciornii discovered that <code>Perl_ck_subr</code> lost its public status
in the API somewhere between 5.8 and 5.10. This resulted in a compilation
failure on Windows for <code>autobox</code>, the hippest module on the block. He
noted that he could provoke the same behaviour on Linux if he removed
the <code>PERL_CORE</code> preprocessor definition. Silence ensued.</p>

<h2> <a name="making_perl5_crosscompilable__or_adventures_in_autoconf_">Making perl5 crosscompilable (or adventures in <code>autoconf</code>)</a> </h2>

<p>Enrico Weigelt reported that he had managed to set up an
<code>autoconf</code>-based technique for building perl. This would allow
him to make it easier to cross-compile Perl. He had managed to
build the core interpreter but was stuck on how to build the
standard extensions.</p>
<p>The porters explained that they were unlikely to move away from
the current <code>metaconf</code> system, since it allows the source to
build build on many non-GNU, non-POSIX hosts.</p>
<p>People tried to explain how the current cross-compilation mechanism
works but it appears that few people have any real experience in
the matter. No <code>autoconf</code> experts were able to answer Enrico's
questions concerning how to build extensions, either.</p>

<h2> <a name="decade_old_regexp_tainting_bug">Decade old regexp tainting bug?</a> </h2>
<p>Nicholas Clark uncovered an ancient bug in the regexp code. It started of with
a boolean value that was able to take values other than 0 and 1, which was
a nice touch. It turned out that it was then binary-or'ed with a bit that
happened to lie way past the most significant bit of the datatype being
used to hold the boolean. Since the bit in question was to indicate that
the pattern was tainted, we have a bit of a problem on our hands.</p>
<p>The first thing was able to see whether it was possible to construct a
test case that could expose the flawed behaviour. Rick Delaney was first
past the post with a test that demonstrated the problem, and a fix that
produced the correct behaviour.</p>
<p>Ben Morrow proposed a different test, that Abigail tweaked to show that
the problem existed all the way back to 5.004. This was important, for
the code the Nicholas found was traced back to change #267, committed
to the repository in 1997. Unfortunately, the change was a jumbo patch
that changed all sorts of things in the regexp engine.</p>

<h2> <a name="dear_c_gurus">Dear C gurus</a> </h2>
<p>Nicholas Clark discovered that an innocuous change to <em>perl.c</em> created
a &quot;argument 'flags' might be clobbered by `longjmp' or `vfork'&quot; warning
and wondered what needed to be done to the code in order to make <code>gcc</code>
happy again. Zefram and Hugo van der Sanden explained that the <code>flags</code>
variable needed to be made <code>volatile</code>. Zefram went on to explain why
it was so, in sufficient detail to merit the badge of &quot;resident C guru&quot;.</p>

<h2> <a name="module__build_interim_release"> <code>Module::Build</code> interim release</a> </h2>
<p>Ken Williams wanted to integrate the changes that were required to get
5.10 out the door back into the mainline <code>Module::Build</code> codebase. Most
of the changes are test tweaks to skip troublesome issues on VMS.</p>
<p>Craig Berry agreed that the VMS porters ran out of time in the run-up
to 5.10, and it would be nice to go back and tidy up the loose ends.</p>

<h2> <a name="unshifting_pl_curstack_is_a_no_no">Unshifting PL_curstack is a no-no?</a> </h2>
<p>Nicholas Clark was up to his elbows as usual, grovelling around in <em>pp.c</em>
and <em>pp_hot.c</em>, seeing if you could shift elements off <code>PL_curstack</code>.
Presumably to make things go faster. After watching things blow up for a
while, he concluded that what he wanted to do couldn't be done.</p>

<h2> <a name="binding_operators__void_context__and_documentation">Binding operators, void context, and documentation</a> </h2>
<p>Kaye Offer wondered why <code>$foo =~ /(bar)/;</code> in void context does not warn,
but <code>$foo !~ /(bar)/;</code> does. Aristotle Pagaltzis and Rafael Garcia-Suarez
did a pretty good job of explaining why thing were the way they were.</p>

<pre>

<p>
<h2> <a name="reviving_the_perl_compiler">Reviving the perl compiler</a> </h2>
<p>Reini Urban announced that he had taken a look at the perl compiler
that had been removed from the 5.10.0 release. He lavished sufficient
care upon it to get to compile again, although there were problems with
the test suite.</p>
<p>Reini thought that the simple stack-based op-tree could be JITted easily
into machine code and was looking at the GNU lightning library. He wanted
to know if anyone else had had a look at this approach before.</p>
<p>Nicholas Clark explained that overloaded or tied SVs make JITting <em>really</em>
hard, and that some of the ops were so high-level that JITting them would
produce copious amounts of machine instructions which in turn would make
a mess of a CPU instruction cache.</p>

<p>Joshua ben Jore pointed to Marc Lehmann's Faster project, that takes
a Perl routine and turns it into C.</p>

<h2> <a name="floats_to_strings_issue">Floats to strings issue</a> </h2>
<p>Jerry D. Hedden asked why <code>Configure</code> probes for alternatives to
<code>sprintf</code> that produce identical behaviour to <code>sprint(&quot;%g&quot;)</code>, and
why not just use <code>sprintf</code> and be done with it. Andy Dougherty
explained that some platforms, such as Solaris, have alternate
functions available in the system C library that offer much better
performance. In such cases, <code>Configure</code> favours them over <code>sprintf</code>.</p>

<h2> <a name="updating_runops__switch___problem_testing_op_say">Updating <code>Runops::Switch</code> - problem testing <code>OP_SAY</code> </a> </h2>
<p>Jim Cromie discovered that <code>Runops::Switch</code> needed a tweak to recognise
the new <code>say</code> in 5.10 and made a preliminary patch to get it to work.
Rafael upgraded the module in any event, but Jim's patch reminded Jan
Dubois that people should never link directly to the <code>Perl_pp_*</code>

routines, since they are not part of the public API.</p>

<h2> <a name="perl5_6_2__e__delete__env_path___segfault_on_solaris_10"> <code>perl5.6.2 -e 'delete $ENV{PATH}'</code> segfault on Solaris 10</a> </h2>
<p>Ralf Hack provided a recipe for people to follow, should they be
stuck on a modern Solaris with an old perl, and attempt to delete
environment variables.</p>

<h2> <a name="win32_precision_configuration">Win32 precision configuration</a> </h2>
<p>Following on from change #33049 when warnings about loss of
precision were tweaked, Nicholas Clark noticed that the
<em>win32/config.bc</em> file failed the Don't Repeat Yourself
principle, and wondered whether it would be possible to
have it generated automatically.</p>
<p>Steve Hay mumbled something about keeping things in sync and
having a mind to write a script to do it, but not actually
having got around to doing something about it.</p>

<h2> <a name="struct_context_now_12_5__smaller_than_5_10"> <code>struct context</code> now 12.5% smaller than 5.10</a> </h2>
<p>Nicholas Clark was as pleased as Punch after pulling out an <code>IV</code>
and a pointer from <code>struct context</code>. And after thinking about it
a bit more, thought of another possible restructuring to save a bit
more space. Benjamin Smith took Nicholas's second idea and coded
a patch to implement it, and in the process discovered another
improvement that Nicholas missed initially.</p>
<p>At the end, Nicholas applied all the discovered slimming goodness to blead.</p>

<p>
<h2> <a name="lc_undef__is_not_undef__bug_or_feature"> <code>lc(undef)</code> is not <code>undef</code>: bug or feature?</a> </h2>
<p>Alberto Sim&#245;es was a little surprised to learn that <code>lc(undef)</code>
returns the empty string, and does not warn when doing so. Abigail
reminded people that Perl's <code>undef</code> is not like SQL's <code>null</code> with
its capacity to turn everything it touches to <code>null</code>. Perl will
turn <code>undef</code> into zero or the empty string as appropriate and
will warn when it does so, if you ask for it.</p>

<p>Jonathon Rockway noticed that <code>\L</code>, <code>\u</code> and the like also behaved
the same way. Michael G. Schwern bet the contents of a capture
variable that <code>\L</code> and <code>lc</code> were implemented using the same
underlying opcode, which was confirmed by a quick glance at
<em>toke.c</em>.</p>
<p>Rafael Garcia-Suarez added some code to make things warn, along
with a few regression tests as change #33088. He hoped that people
would bang on it and see if anything breaks.</p>

<pre>

<p>
<h2> <a name="a_warning_i_d_like_to_see">A warning I'd like to see</a> </h2>
<p>David Nicol wished that a warning would be issued when map
was fed a reference to an array, instead of an array. This
reminded Aristotle Pagaltzis that this was exactly the thing
that Mark-Jason Dominus's proposal a few weeks ago was
designed to approach: raising a warning when a reference is
directly stringified or numified.</p>
<p>Juerd Waalboer pointed out <code>map</code> takes a list, and an arrayref
is merely a one element list. In fact, you cannot do anything
other than give a list to map. It just might not contain what you
thought it should.</p>

<p>
<h2> <a name="extra_stricture_for_hard_refs_in_5_12">Extra stricture for hard refs in 5.12</a> </h2>
<p>Following on from the above thread, Aristotle then restarted the
&quot;references should not stringify&quot; discussion, which covered more
or less the same ground as it did last month. Michael G. Schwern
summed it up pretty well &quot;there are times when you just want an
object to stringify, usually for debugging purposes, and there are
times when you don't, usually for production purposes.&quot;</p>
<p>At the moment, no-one knows how to reconcile these differences,
although Ben Morrow revealed a clever use of <code>Hash::Util::Fieldhash</code>.</p>

<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/bev3m">http://xrl.us/bev3m</a> </pre>
<p>
<h2> <a name="not_a_pad_error">Not a pad error</a> </h2>
<p>Elsewhere in his wanderings around the codebase, Nicholas Clark caught sight
of an oddity in <code>pp_enteriter</code> (that sets up a <code>foreach</code> loop). He
thought that be undoing an 8 year old change by Gurusamy Sarathy, it should
be possible to provoke the bug the change was designed to fix. But, rather
surprisingly, the code continued to work anyway.</p>
<p>Dave Mitchell's work on lexical and closure cleanups for 5.10 turned out to
simplify matters considerably which in turn allows Nicholas to chop out a
certain amount of redundant checks.</p>

<p>Jarkko Hietaniemi reported a failure compiling with C++ on a Tru64
Alpha.  Steve Peters couldn't find any problems when using g++, but
thankfully Solaris's C++ compiler obligingly fell over, which allowed
him to compose a first patch to get IPC::SysV up and running again.</p>
<p>Jarkko followed up with an improved patch to do the same on Tru64.
Rafael applied this, which then caused Solaris to break again, so
Steve had to go back and tweak the tweak.</p>

<h2> <a name="state_variable_not_available___49522_"> <code>state</code> variable not available (#49522)</a> </h2>
<p>Dave Mitchell worked out what the problem was with Abigail's state
variables, tracing it to a problem with the <code>Svf_PADSTALE</code> flag,
which meant, in the context of state variables, that the variable
had not been initialised, rather than having gone out of scope. A
few lines of code, some tests, and the job was done.</p>

<p>Simon Cozens reported that he had heard from the Postgresql developers
running into trouble embedding Perl in Pg. Their simple recipe that
worked in 5.8 no longer works in 5.10, as <code>strict</code> makes use of <code>caller</code>

and the latter is not in the default list of permitted operations.</p>

<p>Johan Vromans posted the nth bug report concerning a problem with
an explicit shift of <code>@ARGV</code> within a subroutine. Dave Mitchell
explained that it was a long-standing bug due to the fact that items
weren't reference counted on the stack, and that perl really ought
to start doing the right thing.</p>

<h2> <a name="file__temp_and_unsafe_shell_characters___50146_"> <code>File::Temp</code> and unsafe shell characters (#50146)</a> </h2>
<p>Ed Avis was alarmed to discover that if you move into a directory
named <code>`rm -rf /`</code>, ask <code>File::Temp</code> to create a file
in said directory and open the file, you can be in a lot of
trouble if it's the super-user that's running the script.</p>
<p>To counter this, Ed felt that <code>File::Temp</code> should ensure that
anything it returned to client code should be filtered to strip
out shellish meta-characters.</p>

<p>Mark Overmeer pointed out that the problem doesn't exist with the
3-arg form of <code>open</code> and that maybe the best solution was to
deprecate the 2-arg form in 5.12.</p>

<p>Eric Promislow had some code that developed a tricky regexp with
a <code>(??{...})</code> construct and wondered why it issued a &quot;will not

<p>Heinz Knutzen discovered that a simple loop involving a <code>pos</code> was
about 2000 times slower in 5.10 compared with 5.8.8. Dave Mitchell
profiled the code and discovered that <code>Perl_utf_length</code> was
soaking up an inordinate number of cycles. This led him to conclude
that there was something broken in the UTF-8 length cache code.</p>

<p>Jerry D. Hedden made the <code>installperl</code> target not complain about
finding <code>perl</code> in the build directory.</p>

<p>H.Merijn Brand reported good results with his <code>Configure</code> and metaunits work.
He was down to 16 warnings, and the promise of several files that could
be removed from the branch once everything was wrapped up. Andy Dougherty
rejoiced.</p>
<pre>
  and we all breathed a sigh of relief
  <a href="http://xrl.us/bevzs">http://xrl.us/bevzs</a> </pre>
<p>Andy Dougherty suggested a pre-5.005-compatible patch to <code>Configure</code> to
get the 5.8.9 snapshot to compile on IRIX. Alas, David Cantrell reported
no joy.</p>

<p>Elsewhere in the push to bring on 5.8.9, Alexey Tourbin noticed that
a recent change was causing tests to fail in <code>Term::ReadLine::Gnu</code> </p>
<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/bev2c">http://xrl.us/bev2c</a> </pre>
<p>Steven Schubiger had a <code>make test</code> fail with copious reports of
<code>undefined symbol: __stack_chk_fail_local</code>. No-one ventured a
reason as to what or why things blew up.</p>

<p>Yamashina Hio wrote some POD in English which was fine, but the same
POD in Japanese failed to produce correct text for link references.
No-one was able to provide any clues.</p>

<p>Nicholas Clark made <em>t/op/inc.t</em> happy again, regarding the overflowing of
an integer following an increment (change #33049)</p>

<p>Andreas K&#246;nig reported that the All Perl Changes (APC) repository now
deals with 5.10 correctly, and all sorts of tarballs of assorted versions
of Perl are available.</p>
<pre>
  and there was much rejoicing
  <a href="http://xrl.us/bev2r">http://xrl.us/bev2r</a> </pre>
<p>Regarding the BBC and <code>Apache::DB</code>, Richard Foley wondered if there was
a parallel with the problems he was having with other modules with
Apache on 5.10, such as <code>B::TerseSize</code>.</p>
<pre>

  <a href="http://xrl.us/bev2z">http://xrl.us/bev2z</a> </pre>
<p>Abigail added some regression tests to <em>t/cmd/for.t</em> to ensure that
<code>for reverse ..</code> does not break one day.</p>

  <a href="http://xrl.us/bev38">http://xrl.us/bev38</a> </pre>
<p>Jerry D. Hedden wrote a patch tp suppress imprecision warnings in
<em>t/op/64bitint.t</em>. Applied by Nicholas.</p>

<p>Jan Dubois pointed out that <code>socketpair()</code> <em>is</em> available on Win32, and
has been for quite some time (as in, prior to 5.8).</p>
<pre>
  only the documentation was buggy

<h2> <a name="about_this_summary">About this summary</a> </h2>
<p>This summary was written by David Landgren.</p>
<p>In last week's summary, I explained that Moritz Lenz was disappointed
that a regexp would not recurse into an interpolated <code>qr//</code>. In
actual fact it does, and Moritz was really wishing that it wouldn't.
Apologies to those confused by my confusion.</p>
<p>Aristotle Pagaltzis also noticed that my xrl.us short linkifier has no
error checking, and it spewed garbage into last week's summary.</p>
