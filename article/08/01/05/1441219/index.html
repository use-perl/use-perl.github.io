<h2> <a name="grep_and_smart_match_should_warn_in_void_context"> <code>grep</code> and smart match should warn in void context</a> </h2>
</p> <p>Michael G. Schwern wondered why a <code>grep</code> operation performed in void
context produced no warnings. The idea being that since a grep is a
filtering operation over a list, you either want to get back some, all or
none of the list, or possibly the number of elements that matched. But to
want nothing at all was either stupid, an error, or some sort of obfuscation.</p>
<p>Nicholas Clark asked Michael to write some TODO tests to nail down the
desired behaviour, but Michael went one better and produced a first cut
at a patch to do what he wanted.</p>

<p>Yitzchak Scott-Thoennes wasn't against the idea, but wanted to make sure
there was a simple way to disable the warning message, just in case.
Rather than introduce a new <code>void</code> keyword, Michael pointed out that
<code>scalar grep foo(), list()</code> works just as well.</p>

<h2> <a name="big_slowdown_in_5_10____parameter_passing">Big slowdown in 5.10 <code>@_</code> parameter passing</a> </h2>

</p> <p>Yves Orton forwarded a message from the DBIx-Class mailing list, where
they had discovered with horror that</p>
<pre>
  my ($x, $y, $z) = @_;</pre>
<p>has become unacceptably slow in 5.10 (whereas a semantically equivalent
code block using <code>shift</code> ran as swiftly as ever). Dave Mitchell
discovered that the optimiser had become confused, and was running the list
assignment through the code path that spends the extra cycles that makes
sure that</p>
<pre>
  ($x, $y) = ($y, $x)</pre>
<p>works as expected. That is, extra care has to be taken when there are
variables common to both sides of the assignment, otherwise things get
clobbered.</p>

<h2> <a name="should_lexicals_used_only_once_warn">Should lexicals used only once warn?</a> </h2>
</p> <p>Nicholas Clark asked innocently whether it would make sense to have
the interpreter warn about lexical variables that were defined and
then never used afterwards. A volley of reasons as to why this would
not be a good idea followed, and ten days later the thread was still
bubbling along nicely. Lots of nice idioms in there worth pondering;
I liked Hugo van der Sanden's resource lock trick.</p>

<h2> <a name="extra_warnings_for_beginners">Extra warnings for beginners</a> </h2>
</p> <p>Gabor Szabo kicked off a slightly shorter thread as to whether it would
help to have extra warnings that would help beginners not fall prey to
some types of simple errors. A concensus formed rather rapidly that this
would not be a Good Idea.</p>

<h2> <a name="configure__dunknown_config_var_should_exit_with_error"> <code>Configure -Dunknown_config_var</code> should exit with error</a> </h2>
</p> <p>Jim Cromie wrote a simple patch to make <code>Configure</code> do sanity
checking on its command line. Andy Dougherty explained just how
hard it was to do such a thing correctly, as hints files complicate
the picture.</p>
<p>H.Merijn Brand began to work on the scripts used to build the
<em>Configure</em> file itself, and pulled his hair out over the bizarro
coding style used. Jim Cromie was worried that if H.Merijn and Andy
were simultaneously unable to work on shepherding the configuration
infrastructure, The Perl project would be seriously stalled.</p>

<h2> <a name="optimising_opcodes">Optimising opcodes</a> </h2>
</p> <p>Jim Cromie had been wondering whether all the null op-codes left
behind after the optimiser was done with an op-tree could cause
cache misses due to bloat, as the CPU ran ahead of the data pipeline.
Nicholas Clark wanted to find out whether adding another pass that
threw away the dead ops, rearranging the ops into a more sensible
order and storing them with a slab allocator would be a win.</p>
<p>Paul Johnson pointed out that one consequence would be that some error
messages would no longer be able to relate to line number, as currently
that information is stored in the very nullops that Nicholas was
proposing to throw away.</p>
<pre>
  need some running code for concensus
  <a href="http://xrl.us/bdtg7">http://xrl.us/bdtg7</a> </pre>
<p>Later on in the week, Jim returned with a patch to move op-sibling pointers
out of OPs, the theory being that it reduces the optree's cache footprint
by 20%. Unfortunately the MJD advice about getting the wrong answer as fast
as possible applies, since the patch (which Jim admits is a work in progress)
causes things to dump core.</p>
<pre>
  it's a start

<p>
<h2> <a name="storable_for_bytecode">Storable for bytecode?</a> </h2>
</p> <p>Since the decision to jettison the Perl compiler for 5.10, perl no
longer has a bytecode loader. Nicholas observed that <code>Storable</code>
can serialise stuff, so, how much effort would it take before it
could store an optree? And, at that point, would we have a byteloader?
First up, Storable doesn't do regular expressions or typeglobs or...
a whole lot of things it turns out, all of which are vital for an
optree. Nicholas wondered whether it was feasible, easy or impossible.</p>
<p>Hugo said that the first step (this no doubt applies to the above
thread of optimising opcodes as well) would be to overhaul the
optimiser to separate the manditory fixups (that if absent, would
cause the code to be unrunnable) from the true optimisations.</p>
<p>chromatic thought that a more promising avenue would be to remove
the pessimisation in Perl 5 that makes the interpreter to poke at
everything incessantly in case there's some sort of magic behaviour
lying in ambush to do something completely different.</p>

<h2> <a name="apc_now_includes_perl_5_10">APC now includes perl-5.10</a> </h2>
</p> <p>Philippe M. Chiasson updated the APC (All Perl Changes repository) to
include the 5.10 track. Since it has been over five years since the 5.8
track was created, there was considerable head-scratching on how to do
a couple of things that had been lost in the mists of time.</p>
<p>Philippe was hoping that Sarathy could chip in with what he recalled of
the process.</p>

<h2> <a name="array____any">Array ~~ Any</a> </h2>

</p> <p>Michael G. Schwern caught wind of a thread on Perlmonks discussing the
behaviour in something like</p>
<pre>
  42 ~~ ['foo', 15]</pre>
<p>warning, which some people find rather unsettling, about &quot;foo&quot; not
being numeric. Michael wondered if something could be done about the
matter.</p>

<h2> <a name="smart_matching_with_objects">Smart matching with objects</a> </h2>
</p> <p>Ricardo Signes thought that smart matching and objects didn't mix very
well as things stand, and suggested that objects participate in smart
matching only if they overload <code>~~</code>. This is a pretty reasonable
suggestion, as it gives the object the power to decide how it smart
matches, rather than the operator blindly assume that anything behind
the implementation curtain is fair game.</p>
<p>Tels was surprised to learn that it was even possible to overload <code>~~</code>
and began to wonder whether <code>Math::BigInt</code> objects and their relatives
needed to do so. (Answer: yes, probably).</p>
<p>Michael thought that the path of least resistance would be to make
a smart match against an object die, unless the class had overloaded
<code>~~</code>. Ricardo was a little squeamish at first, but realised that
it solves future backward-compatibility concerns nicely: no need
to suffer the result of a poor choice in what tricksy dwimmery <code>~~</code>

the porters could invent on the spur of the moment to deal with a
not-smart-match-aware object.</p>
<p>Larry Wall chipped in to point out that the smart match, as implemented
in Perl 5 today, is now considered a misfeature in Perl 6, and there
smart match behaves differently. That is, the match is determined solely
by the nature of the RHS argument. Which means that if Perl 5 wants
to borrow from the future and implement Perl 6 ideas, we need to track
things more closely.</p>

<h2> <a name="___changing_behaviour_after_using___"> <code>~~</code> changing behaviour after using <code>==</code>?</a> </h2>

</p> <p>In a similar vein, Gabor Szabo reported being tripped up by two
scalars being smart matched, then tested for numeric equality, and
then watching a subsequent smart match return a different result.
This was in spite of the fact that the scalars had not changed value.</p>
<p>No-one had a really good answer, but Mark-Jason Dominus thought
it reminded him of a heisenproblem with <code>vec</code> a few years back
which in his recollection wound up labelled as, at best, a misfeature.</p>
<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/bdthj">http://xrl.us/bdthj</a> </pre>
<p>In the final thread of the week concerning smart matching, Jerry D. Hedden
patched the documentation to indicate that <code>~~</code> is not a feature.</p>

<h2> <a name="always_to_use_strict">Always to use strict</a> </h2>
</p> <p>Steffen M&#252;ller, whose post for some reason isn't showing up on Xray
(and thus we point you to the first follow-up in the thread),
suggested that it would be a really great idea to enable <code>use
strict</code> by default for 5.11 (and hence 5.12).</p>
<p>While I was expecting a flamefest, surprisingly, everyone was more
or less in agreement, although a push to enable <code>use warnings</code>
as well had Abigail wringing her hands in dismay.</p>

<pre>
  there is no strict
  <a href="http://xrl.us/bdthq">http://xrl.us/bdthq</a> </pre>
<p>Steffen cooked up a first cut at a patch to implement the desired

<h2> <a name="weird_begin_block_cv_assignment_behaviour">Weird BEGIN block CV assignment behaviour</a> </h2>
</p> <p>Peter Scott reported a question seen on c.l.p.m concerning typeglobs,

<code>BEGIN</code> blocks and comments, for which he had no satisfactory
answer. Nicholas and Dave Mitchell weren't able to do much better
apart from some sympathetic waving of hands.</p>

<h2> <a name="regexps_are_people__too">Regexps are people, too</a> </h2>
</p> <p>Ricardo dreamt about the possibility letting an object knowing when it
was being used in a regexp context, which would allow it to be used with ease
in pattern matches and substitutions, and splits.</p>
<pre>
  my life is made of patterns
  <a href="http://xrl.us/bdthw">http://xrl.us/bdthw</a> </pre>

<p>So Nicholas set about making regexps orange (no, don't ask). As part of the
fallout, Jerry D. Hedden noticed that it caused threads tests to fail and
proposed a patch to fix it.</p>
<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/bdthy">http://xrl.us/bdthy</a> </pre>
<p>Jerry then fixed the &quot;orange&quot; regexps in threads.</p>
<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/bdth2">http://xrl.us/bdth2</a> </pre>
<p>The shaking up of the code base in this way uncovered something else we
weren't testing for, so Nicholas added a test:</p>

<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/bdth4">http://xrl.us/bdth4</a> </pre>
<p>And that brought us first class regexps (like <code>ARRAY</code> and <code>HASH</code>), rather
than <code>Regexp</code> objects. Nicholas tried to change it to <code>REGEXP</code>
but too many things broke. The underlying implementation structure is nothing
more (for the moment) than a PVMG (a thing of magic) with a pointer to the
regexp structure. The quest was on to see what could be hoisted out of the
latter structure (such as reference counting) into the PVMG, since it had a
slew of unused elements begging to be used.</p>

<p>Yves Orton liked the idea, and felt that it could go quite some way in
reducing the complexity of the regexp engine. Nicholas continued to chip away
at now-obsolete infrastructure code... until his monitor gave up the ghost.</p>
<p>There was idle chatter about renaming the REGEXP type to REGEX, RULE and
PATTERN. ORANGE and PLUM also got a look in.</p>
<pre>

<p>
<h2> <a name="when_strict__refs__is_not_strict_enough">When <code>strict 'refs'</code> is not strict enough</a> </h2>
</p> <p>Mark-Jason Dominus penned a thoughtful critique of why he thought
strict 'refs' was not good enough. it was well-written enough to
be summarised as: &quot;stringifying a reference is probably an error&quot;.
If you really need to do so, you should be explicit about it. Having
it done implicitly is probably unwise.</p>

<p>Michael S. made a couple of pertinent remarks as to why things had
to be the way they were.</p>

<h2> <a name="loss_of_context_with_return_do___my__x__1__constructs">Loss of context with <code>return do { my $x; 1}</code> constructs</a> </h2>
</p> <p>Some years back, Vincent Pit reported a bug (#38809) that reveals
how <code>return do {my $x; 1}</code> returns undef, yet <code>return do {1}</code>
returns 1 (except in taint mode).</p>
<p>It's all slightly confusing until you look at the output from
<code>B::Concise</code>, which shows how the result from the <code>do</code> block gets
discarded. Vincent Pit proposed a simple brute-force patch that
does better, pointing out that a more subtle approach would be
better, and requested comments (but received none) on the matter.</p>

<h2> <a name="factor_out_duplicate_code_in_struct_xpv_">Factor out duplicate code in <code>struct xpv*</code> </a> </h2>
</p> <p>Marcus Holland-Moritz was puzzled, because with a short amount of work,
he removed 377 lines of code and reduced the duplication of some
hard-to-keep-in-sync code. He wondered if it was so blindingly obvious
that no-one had spotted it before, or whether it was that way because
of some impossibly subtle edge case.</p>
<p>On the downside, some struct members need to be wrapped in macros. On
the other hand, some structures become identical, for instance, <code>XPVIV</code>
and <code>XPVUV</code> are defined the same way.</p>
<p>Nicholas Clark was worried that the extra macroification might cause
cranky compilers, such as the one on AIX, to have a fit. H.Merijn
Brand took the patch for a spin on an AIX machine he had handy and
gave it a clean bill of health.</p>
<p>Marcus discovered that there are 63 macros in the codebase that expand
to more than 533 bytes, the grand-daddy of them all being

<code>REXEC_TRIE_READ_CHAR</code> weighing in at 3697. In the end the patch
was applied.</p>

for detecting the building of modules under the core. The <code>PERL_CORE=1</code>
