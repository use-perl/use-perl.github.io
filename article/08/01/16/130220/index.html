<p>&quot;Um, I think you caused me negative work. I rather wanted <code>dtrace</code>
support and it seemed that because of you I didn't have to write
it.&quot; -- Nicholas Clark, on the joys of having other people do your
work for you.</p></p>

<h2> <a name="ever_more_strict">Ever more strict</a> </h2>
<p>In the continuing &quot;strict by default in 5.12&quot; thread, Glenn Linderman made a
most pertinent remark: Perl 6 has staked the &quot;strict be default&quot; claim.
Perl 5 may approach the same place, but will have to do so more slowly. Not
that it shouldn't be done, we need not burden ourselves with bad practices
forever, but deprecation cycles and dealing with dormant CPAN modules and
code in the DarkPAN means it will take time.</p>

<p>The other contentious issue (should extra strictures be activated from a
<code>feature</code> pragma) was addressed by Abigail, who put forward the argument
that <code>feature</code> should be considered no more than a message from the
programmer to the interpreter indicating that constraints regarding
backwards compatibility are hereby waived.</p>

<h2> <a name="___changing_behaviour_after_using___"> <code>~~</code> changing behaviour after using <code>==</code> </a> </h2>
<p>brian d foy was puzzled upon learning that smart matching suffered
from action at a distance, and wondered if it was all documented.
David Landgren explained that it was a problem due to the <code>IOK</code>
flag being set, which caused the smart matching code to use
numishness, rather than stringiness as a basis for matching.</p>
<p>Zefram rightly pointed out that this was exactly the sort of
problem that prevented Perl from being able to be used in very
large projects. Nicholas Clark asked himself what would happen if
the IOK flag was not set during a numish comparison, were the number
not truly numeric. And so now blead does just that.</p>
<pre>

<h2> <a name="dtrace_and_perl"> <code>dtrace</code> and Perl</a> </h2>
<p>Andy Armstrong added dtrace support to perl to probe subroutine entry
and exit points and was happy to announce that it incurs no measurable
performance hit.</p>
<p>Nicholas Clark made a number of comments regarding the patch: things
that need to be done and the ways to do it. He went ahead and cleared
up the nits and applied it all.</p>
<pre>
  the patch itself
  <a href="http://xrl.us/bec85">http://xrl.us/bec85</a> </pre>
<p>The main issue with the patch was dealing with <code>Configure</code>, partly
because not many people have strong <code>Configure</code>-fu (and H.Merijn
Brand was busy using his fu to attend to some sorely needed work
on it).</p>

<p>Andy Dougherty helped out with a rough sketch of what needed to be
done. Bryan Allen of pobox.com generously provided shell access to
a Solaris box to get the kinks sorted out.</p>
<pre>
  dtrace sees delight
  <a href="http://xrl.us/bec87">http://xrl.us/bec87</a> </pre>
<p>Once that was more or less under control, the next question to ask was
what probes should we have? The following items were put forward:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Creation and destruction of SVs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Interpreter set-up and tear down.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Module loading (<code>use</code> and <code>require</code>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Filesystem access.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>opcode arguments</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p>One of things that needs to be addressed is that in order to trace
the stack (C's or Perl's, really), a so-called ustack helper is
what's needed, but these are fiendishly difficult to write. For a
start, much of dtrace runs in the kernel, not in userland.</p>
<p>Much of the more esoteric discussion was cross-posted from the
dtrace-discuss mailing list, where talk of ustacks certainly
appeared to give them The Fear.</p>
<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/bec89">http://xrl.us/bec89</a> </pre>
<p>In the process of producing <code>dtrace</code> support, Andy ran into trouble
with getting the shellish idiom of if-not-condition-then correct.</p>
<p>H.Merijn Brand showed one way to do it, Zefram, another.</p>

<h2> <a name="grep_and_smart_match_should_warn_in_void_context">grep and smart match should warn in void context</a> </h2>
<p>The discussion continued this week as to whether or not this would
be a good idea. Michael Schwern started to jot down the history of
why &quot;map in void context&quot; played such an important part in the
history of Perl.</p>
<pre>
  we have a wiki, man
  <a href="http://xrl.us/beddu">http://xrl.us/beddu</a> </pre>

<p>Abigail maintained that it would be insane to start warning about
a construct that has not previously triggered a warning, even if
the construct was not considered to be a best practice (in which
case a Perl::Critic policy would be more suitable).</p>
<p>Zefram put forward a suggestion that was endorsed by Larry Wall.</p>

<h2> <a name="feature_pm_needs_some_version_comparison_code_somewhere"> <code>feature.pm</code> needs some version comparison code somewhere</a> </h2>
<p>Rafa&#235;l Garcia-Suarez waved his hands vaguely at the new error that
comes out of <code>bleadperl -e 'use 5.10.1'</code> and hoped something could
be done about it. Steffen M&#252;ller showed how difficult it would be
to solve the general case.</p>

<p>The only sane approach is for bleadperl to track feature sets
in the current maintenance release. No new features could be
added to 5.10.x after 5.12.0 comes out. Dave Mitchell thought
add new features to a maintenance track was a bad idea anyway.</p>

<h2> <a name="first_pass_at_meta_yml_support_for_the_core">First pass at <em>META.yml</em> support for the core</a> </h2>
<p>Adam Kennedy took his <code>YAML::Tiny</code> module and made it even tinier by
throwing everything that is not required to parse a <em>META.yml</em> file.
He named it <code>Parse::CPAN::Meta</code> so that it doesn't say &quot;YAML&quot; on the
tin. The idea being is that it will permit richer semantics in dealing
with module requirements. This could come in handy for dual-lifed
modules and modules that depend on external libraries.</p>

<p>&#198;var Arnfj&#246;r&#240; Bjarmason found a minor YAML remnant in the test
suite.</p>

<h2> <a name="segmentation_violations_with_ithreads_and_regexps">Segmentation violations with ithreads and regexps</a> </h2>
<p>Nicholas Clark was wondering what change caused a particular language
construct to go boom! and asked Andreas K&#246;nig to fire up his magic
binary search patch locator to find the offending change.</p>
<p>Andreas wasn't around, but Marcus Holland-Moritz was, and in about an
hour had identified change #30755 as being the culprit. This enabled
Nicholas to make the required correction.</p>

<p>Following that (if it's the same bug we're talking about) Dave
Mitchell, Yves Orton and he kicked the problem around for a little
while, and they appeared to arrive at the right solution by the end
of the week.</p>

<h2> <a name="for__2__inf_"> <code>for (2..Inf)</code> </a> </h2>
<p>Michael G. Schwern had a chance encounter with a C-style <code>for</code>
loop, and realising that the range operation (<code>..</code>) used a lazy
implementation, noted that it was a Simple Matter Of Programming
to get <code>for my $var (2..Inf)</code> to Do The Right Thing. So he
coded a quick and dirty patch (with a test!) to prove that it
could be done. Much of the discussion that followed, apart from
mentioning Ruby and <code>bc</code> involved what to do when adding 1 to an
integer value overflows.</p>

<pre>
  from her to eternity
  <a href="http://xrl.us/bec9m">http://xrl.us/bec9m</a> </pre>
<p>Jerry D. Hedden picked up the patch and ran with it, delivering a
whole pile of code, documentation and tests to implement the whole
show. Michael made a number of good comments, so Jerry returned to
the lab and cooked up a fresh patch.</p>
<p>One sticking point was whether the range should stop or not, when
the value outgrew the maximum size of an integer. Yves thought that
if that was a problem, people should really be using <code>while (1)</code>.</p>
<p>But even that approach is flawed, since after a few billion or
quintillion loops any integer-based counter will begin to lose
precision (after it is upgraded to a float following the overflow
an integer). And transparently switching over to <code>Math::BigInt</code>
would be Really Hard.</p>

<h1> <a name="what_do_we_want_to_see_in_5_12">What do we want to see in 5.12?</a> </h1>
<p>A number of porters described the innovations they would like to
see in perl 5.12, the next major release after 5.10. Nicholas Clark
commented that a lot of the suggestions had high niftiness values,
but noted that the difference between suggesting and implementing
will impose its own natural selection of what gets done.</p>
<p>
<h2> <a name="deprecated_items_removed_in_5_12">Deprecated items removed in 5.12</a> </h2>
<p>Firstly, a number of items were marked as deprecated in 5.10 and
thus may be removed from 5.12. All that could be recalled for the
moment was the <code>-P</code> command-line switch and unnamed <code>package;</code>

declarations (which actually disappeared in 5.10).</p>
<pre>
  all gone

<p>
<h2> <a name="am_i_a_method_call">Am I a method call?</a> </h2>
<p>Ricardo Signes wanted support from the language to let him know if the
routine had been called as a method. Currently, there is no mechanism
that lets you do this in the general case. One possible approach is to
do it by extending <code>caller</code>.</p>
<p>Given that <code>caller</code> already returns an impossible-to-remember list of values,
Mark Jason Dominus wondered whether the last element should be a hashref, or
whether an alternate hashified <code>caller</code> hashref should be made available.
This suggestion attracted significant discussion, which evolved into calls
for having <code>autobox</code> brought into core. Nicholas Clark warned against
making that decision lightly.</p>

<pre>
  just so long as the hashref is purple

<p>
<h2> <a name="method_declaration">Method declaration</a> </h2>
<p>Michael G. Schwern proposed a <code>method foo</code> declaration, that would work like
a <code>sub foo</code>, except that it fetches the <code>$self</code> object from <code>@_</code> for free.</p>

<p>The open issues are, can you call it as a bare subroutine, what if you don't
like using the name <code>$self</code>, what about class methods, and should <code>$self</code>
be removed from <code>@_</code> or should it remain?</p>
<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/bec9u">http://xrl.us/bec9u</a> </pre>
<pre>
  and it's on the wiki
  <a href="http://xrl.us/beddw">http://xrl.us/beddw</a> </pre>

<p>
<h2> <a name="lexical_named_subroutines">Lexical named subroutines</a> </h2>
<p>Ricardo also suggested named lexical subroutines, to be used in situations
such as comparator routines for <code>sort</code>, while avoiding namespace pollution.</p>
<p>Dave Mitchell pointed out the problems this would have in terms of
closures. He sketched out two possible implementations and pointed
out the flaws in both of them.</p>
<p>Nicholas Clark recalled that Mark Jason Dominus was believed to be in the
possession of a list of examples of the corner cases that would need to be
addressed in any such proposal. Dave thought he could come up with one of
his own at a pinch.</p>
<pre>
  just a spoonful of sugar

<p>
<h2> <a name="anonymous_packages">Anonymous packages</a> </h2>
<p>Ricardo also mentioned a conversation with Matt Trout concerning the issue
of creating anonymous packages. Currently it can be hacked together using
<code>Package::Generator</code> or <code>Class::Mix</code>. In any event, more thought needs to
go into what the syntax should be.</p>
<pre>
  heh, inherit from *that*
  <a href="http://xrl.us/bec9y">http://xrl.us/bec9y</a> </pre>
<p>
<h2> <a name="named_parameters">Named parameters</a> </h2>
<p>Michael then kicked off a very large thread by p5p standards, proposing
real honest-to-goodness named parameters. One point he stressed was that
what ever solution is implemented, it doesn't have to be perfect. We could
apply the 80/20 rule and strive for a simple solution that is satisfactory
80% of the time.</p>
<p>Then the difficulties began to surface: should the parameters that are named
be removed (or not) from <code>@_</code> (see also: the method declaration thread).
Should the parameters be aliases (fast, but dangerous) or copies (slow and
safe, and conforms to the Principle of Least Surprise). What happens if
not enough parameters are passed. Can we have defaults? How does this tie
in with prototype specifications?</p>
<p>One useful item to come out of the discussion was a post from Juerd
Waalboer who stepped of with a review of subroutine signatures in Perl 6,
and is worth stealing from it for Perl 5. Another point is that, one way
or another, we'll need better support for aliases in the language. Solve
that problem, and named parameters are a piece of cake.</p>

<h2> <a name="saner_behaviour_for_length">Saner behaviour for <code>length</code> </a> </h2>
<p>Aristotle Pagaltzis put forward an elegant suggestion to deal with
<code>length(undef)</code>. Rather than issuing a warning, it should quietly
return <code>undef</code>. Rafa&#235;l Garcia-Suarez liked the idea so much
that he tried to implement, but was stumped by a number of strange
failures in the test suite.</p>
<p>Nicholas Clark picked up where he left off, and discovered that it
is horrendously hard to get it to work correctly with tied variables.
After a number of patches, the implementation was satisfactory, and
in the process, Nicholas uncovered a bug involving (drum roll) UTF-8.</p>

the issue identified by Dave Mitchell, where the <code>OPpASSIGN_COMMON</code>

pretend to, or cannot. This was corrected, and Steve Hay recommended
that for dual-lifed modules that need to test forking, the best
practices may be found in <em>Test/Simple/t/fork.t</em> and <em>IO/t/io_pipe.t</em>.</p>

<pre>
  there is no fork

<p>A bug involving a child reading from a file and looping back to the
beginning and reading again, and again was posted nearly eight years
ago (hence the low bug id). The problem was kicked around for a
while, but no-one was able to figure out what was going wrong.</p>
<p>And there the bug slumbered from many years, until Franz Fischer
revived it a few days ago, having run into the same behaviour on
HP-UX.</p>

<p>Abigail posted this bug four years ago, and noting that the problem
was still present, created a TODO test for it.</p>
<p>Yves Orton wondered if the problem occurred outside of a <code>map</code> but
Abigail listed a number of variations on theme that produced an
interesting variety of segfaults, valgrind errors or memory exhaustion,
and some that worked just fine.</p>

<h2> <a name="outdated_test__harness__straps___49504_">Outdated <code>Test::Harness::Straps</code> (#49504)</a> </h2>
<p>Imacat from Taiwan, who runs a very tight testing ship, reported
that the <code>Test::Harness::Straps</code> shipped with 5.10.0 is quite
far behind the current CPAN version. Furthermore, upgrading the
module copies it to the <em>site</em> directory, hence shadowed by
the older core version. Michael G. Schwern fixed this.</p>

<p>Imacat also asked Michael to bundle a <em>Makefile.PL</em>, to enable
a vanilla 5.8.8 distribution (<em>sans</em> <code>Module::Build</code> to
install THS automatically in a CPAN shell.</p>
<p>Michael was a little more reluctant to take on this additional
technical debt, but Andreas K&#246;nig thought he had little choice.</p>

<p>Yves Orton complained that development version numbers, warnings,

in a version number to signify the beta release of a module to PAUSE
blows chunks, and a much better idea would be to have something in
<em>META.yml</em>.</p>
