<p>I'd like to announce that I finished transcribing
<a href="http://perl.net.au/wiki/Perlcast_Transcript_-_Interview_with_Tom_Limoncelli">the
Perlcast Interview with Tom Limoncelli</a>, with some help in correcting
mis-transcribed phrases from "fax". There are still some phrases I'm uncertain
of in the document, which are marked with "[?]" or "FILL IN" (and I could use
some help in correcting), but as a general rule, the transcript should be
usable.


<p>
On a similar note, I was referred to
<a href="http://linuxhelp.blogspot.com/2008/01/getting-things-done-two-aspects-of-self.html">this
talk about "Getting things done"</a> (which I did not watch yet) by a friend,
and "Getting Things Done" is mentioned in the Tom Limoncelli interview.</p></p>

<h2>&quot;Practice [?] Time&quot;</h2>

Project Time, probably.

Probably, 'Oh, boy!'

<h2>good email time management</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/mr_bean/">mr_bean</a> on 2008-02-10T12:13:47</h3>
At 28:00 he says:<br/><br/>and to keep my E-mail locks clean, I realise that the strategy has to include the end of all these takes [?] the E-mail being deleted or filed away someplace or archived<br/><br/>I don't here him say 'E-mail box'. He does talk about his 'inbox' later.<br/><br/>I wonder if 'takes' is 'tactics' or 'techniques.'<br/><br/>'..the end of all these techniques/tactics. It has to end with the email being deleted or file away..'<br/><br/>Good advice. I was able to unsubscribe from all my mailing lists. I wasn't able to keep my inbox clean.



<h2>34:13</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/mr_bean/">mr_bean</a> on 2008-02-10T12:23:08</h3>
Josh says, perhaps:<br><br>'So I can use them on my own time.'<br><br>'You always put your gas tank on Sundays.' Or does he say, 'fill your gas tank?'



<h2>car door closing routine</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/mr_bean/">mr_bean</a> on 2008-02-10T12:35:23</h3>
He says, 'I know this sounds kind of anal-retentive,'<br><br>He squeezes his car keys as he closes his car door to prevent closing the door without having them with him.<br><br>I make this a practice too, but then I forget what I'm jangling the keys in my pocket for.
