<h2> <a name="exception_roles__take_1">Exception roles, take 1</a> </h2>

</p><p>Ricardo Signes wrapped up the year with a first cut at doing exception
roles in Perl (the idea being that one would manage errors with some
formal mechanism, anything, than matching <code>$!</code> with regexps).</p>
<p>Zefram quoted lisp back at him for more background on handling error
conditions.</p>

to avoid creating elaborate Exception hierarchies that would wind up
looking like Java.</p>

<h2> <a name="lexicals_used_only_once_should_warn__redux_i_">Lexicals used only once should warn (redux I)</a> </h2>
</p><p>This thread from last week, err month, um year continued in full
swing this week. There are two main points to come out of it.
Firstly, given the following statement:</p>
<pre>
  my $opaque = xyzzy();</pre>
<p>if <code>$opaque</code> appears nowhere else in the current scope, it is not
possible to determine at compile time whether or not its purpose is
to hold a reference to an acquired resource (and thus cannot be
considered &quot;unused&quot;).</p>

<p>Secondly, and in light of the above, is it worth expending so much
effort to hunt down and carp about truly unused lexicals? From a
purist's point of view, the answer is yes, but from a pragmatist's
point of view, the better solution lies in a <code>lint</code>-like analysis.</p>

<p>
<h2> <a name="lexicals_used_only_once_should_warn__redux_ii_">Lexicals used only once should warn (redux II)</a> </h2>
</p><p>Another part of the thread from last week reminded Fergal Daly
how much he would like, in a loop like</p>
<pre>
  for my $x (@list) { ... }</pre>

<p>to obtain a trace that not only shows the call stack, but also
shows the value of <code>$x</code>. Even knowing that the loop was in the
Nth iteration would be better than nothing. chromatic suspected
that if code were written to handle that, it would come in
handy for dealing with tail-call optimisations.</p>
<p>That reminded Yves Orton about a <code>$^SUB</code> variable which would
provide a hinting mechanism to the compiler, thereby side-stepping
the issue of introducing unnecessary slowdowns in the general
case, and putting the onus on the programmer to get things right.</p>

<p>
<h2> <a name="sub_2007______goto__2008__"> <code>sub 2007{ ... goto &amp;2008 }</code> </a> </h2>
</p><p>David Nicol broke out of the monster warnings thread and wondered
about tail recursion the light of RAII. The trouble is that an
opaque scalar in <code>@_</code> holding a resource lock would get wiped out
during the tail recursion call. He was of the opinion that tail
recursion could not be done automatically by the compiler, but that
it could be possible to set it up yourself, if one was able to set
up a new <code>@_</code> explicitly, just before transfer.</p>
<pre>
  finding the right syntax
  <a href="http://xrl.us/bd458">http://xrl.us/bd458</a> </pre>

<p>In the new year, Aristotle Pagaltzis cautioned against diddling with
<code>@_</code> since it is built for speed and thus behaves oddly in a number
of edge cases. Better to invent some sort of syntax that looks like
a regular function call, and deals with @_ itself away from prying
eyes.</p>
<p>Jim Cromie pondered whether some sort of <code>pp_goto</code>/<code>pp_entersub</code>
mashup would do the trick.</p>

<p>
<h2> <a name="optimising_opcodes">Optimising opcodes</a> </h2>
</p><p>Rafa&#235;l Garcia-Suarez, Nicholas Clark and Paul Johnson continued
to ponder ways to obtain line number information for warning messages
if all the nullops were thrown away.</p>

<h2> <a name="negated_smart_match">Negated smart match</a> </h2>
</p><p>Ron Blaschke wanted to know why there was no <code>!~~</code> negated smart
match operator. There's one in Perl 6. In Perl 5.10, it gets parsed
as the slightly useless <code>!~ ~</code>. In the meantime, one can get by
with <code>!($thud ~~ @qux)</code>.</p>

<pre>

<p>
<h2> <a name="strictly_by_default">strictly by default</a> </h2>
</p><p>The debate continued over how and when strict would be enabled by
default in future versions of Perl. The key was to specify some sort
of <code>use 5.12</code> pragma or a feature, but there was disagreement over
whether they should behave the same, or differently.</p>

<p>
<h2> <a name="sv_leak">SV leak</a> </h2>
</p><p>Nicholas Clark looked at some code in <code>XS_PerlIO_get_layers</code>
and realised that it was probably leaking <code>SV</code>s. This made him
wonder if other XS code committed the same sin.</p>
<p>Marcus Holland-Moritz seemed to think so, and committed change #32816
it. And then committed #32817 when he realised that the routine's
<code>dTARGET</code> was now unused.</p>
<p>Vincent Pit had a look around and came up with a number of other
places where the same kind of misbehaviour was occurring. He
whipped up a patch, that Marcus applied.</p>

<p>
<h2> <a name="handling_of_set_magic_in_mxpush_macros">Handling of SET magic in <code>mX?PUSH</code> macros</a> </h2>
</p><p>After the above adventure, Marcus noted that there was no need
to handle the setting of magic in the <code>mPUSH</code> family of macros,
since they are creating new mortals that cannot have any magic
on them (yet). Which makes for less make-work code.</p>

<h2> <a name="mro_and_av_clear">MRO and <code>av_clear</code> </a> </h2>
</p><p>Torsten Sch&#246;nfeld was having problems with perl 5.10 and XS code diddling
<code>@ISA</code> to change package hierarchies. As it happens, Torsten was using the
<code>av_clear</code> API call to clear out <code>@ISA</code>.</p>

<p>The problem is that <code>@ISA</code> has a certain amount of magic associated with it.
Rick Delaney had a look at what Torsten was trying to do, and once he
understood what was needed, was able to cook up a patch and toss in a couple
of regression tests to wrap things up.</p>

<h2> <a name="when_will_perl_5_10_be_stable">When will perl 5.10 be stable?</a> </h2>
</p><p>Alberto Sim&#245;es asked why <em>stable.tar.gz</em> refers to 5.8.8 and not 5.10.0.
A long discussion ensued. Most people were happy to accept that it is
probably premature to label 5.10.0 to be stable, but it's going to happen
sooner or later. So when?</p>

<p>Michael G. Schwern suggested adopting Debian's stable/testing/unstable/experimental
labels. The main problem was that people had difficulty trying to match
Perl releases into the above four categories. Dave Mitchell came up with
an alternative eminently pragmatic approach.</p>
<pre>
  5.8 is the new 5.6

<p>
<h2> <a name="svook___now_doesn_t__ab_use_svivx"> <code>SvOOK()</code> now doesn't (ab)use <code>SvIVX</code> </a> </h2>
</p><p>Nicholas Clark, looking more closely at how macros expand, put forward an
alternative technique to deal with strings that get clipped from the beginning.
Instead of recopying the string, perl has always kept the string as is, and
moved a pointer forwards to point to the new beginning.</p>
<p>Until now, the macro expanded to some bit-twiddling and possibly a function call.
By rearranging things, Nicholas was able to get rid of the function call, but
wondered if there was a way to trip things up because of that.</p>

<p>After having played with it a bit more, Nicholas determined that it was simpler
to store an offset.</p>

<h2> <a name="solving_the____changing_behaviour_after_using___">Solving the <code>~~</code> changing behaviour after using <code>==</code> </a> </h2>
</p><p>Following on from the thread from last week where Gabor Szabo reported that
smart match could return a differing results from the same inputs, Nicholas
changed the behaviour in bleadperl so that <code>&quot;42x&quot;</code> (a numeric value with
trailing garbage) never gets the IOK or NOK flags set. Thus solving the problem
neatly.</p>

<p>It turns out that doing so didn't break the test suite, but the question to ask
is whether there were no tests for it. In which case, careful analysis will
be required to see whether it is safe to backport to the 5.10 line.</p>

</p><p>Marcus Holland-Moritz was in the mood for adding a new op flag, and suffered
considerable pain when he gazed upon <em>opcode.pl</em>, as well as some
8-year old code contributed by Ilya Zakharevich which he thought was a
&quot;can't happen&quot; scenario.</p>
<p>In tightening things up, he discovered a dormant bug that meant that <code>helem</code>
had an incorrect specification so he corrected it.</p>

<h2> <a name="loading_a_loadable_object_with_a_non_standard_file_extension">Loading a &quot;loadable object&quot; with a non-standard file extension</a> </h2>
</p><p>One of things that was pushed for in 5.10 was to embed platform-specific
decisions into DynaLoader.pm when it was generated during the build of
Perl instead of deferring things until run-time. The move proved to be a
shade too aggressive and broke established behaviour in 5.6 and 5.10.</p>
<p>Jan Dubois restored the old behaviour with a patch that was applied by
Rafa&#235;l.</p>

blead to reduce the breakage. To a certain extent, however, some changes have

<p>Nicholas responded to Larry's remarks about the fact that the Perl 5
smart match was not quite the same as the Perl 6 smart match. The
problem is that there is insufficient cross-pollination between the
two development camps. Certainly, there have been no patches from
Perl 6 developers to adjust the Perl 5 implementations of Perl 6
ideas to keep them in line with the functionality du jour.</p>
