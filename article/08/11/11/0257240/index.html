<p><p>The Perl Foundation is pleased to announce the first <a href="http://news.perlfoundation.org/2008/05/tpf_receives_large_donation_in.html">Hague Grant</a>.  It is being awarded to Patrick Michaud, the head of the 'Rakudo' Perl 6 implementation effort on top of the Parrot VM.  Conceptually it is an extension of Patrick's earlier Mozilla Foundation / Perl Foundation Perl 6 development grant that he worked on between late 2007 and mid 2008.</p></p>
<p><p>The details of Patrick's grant proposal are below.  Jesse Vincent, the project manager of the Perl 6 effort, has agreed to volunteer as the grant manager for Patrick's grant.  Jesse will provide updates to TPF on Patrick's status and will judge acceptances of the various milestones and deliverables.</p><p>We look forward to Patrick's continued success on the Rakudo Perl 6 implementation and we are proud to be able to support him in this work over the next 4 months.</p><p>Name:           Patrick R. Michaud</p><p>Project Title:  Rakudo Perl and PCT improvements</p><p>Synopsis:<br>
This project will aim to coordinate and implement many key features<br>
needed for Rakudo Perl, the implementation of Perl 6 on Parrot.  In<br>
particular, this project aims to continue and extend the work performed<br>
under my existing grants from the Mozilla Foundation and TPF.<br>
As with the the Mozilla/TPF grants, the overarching goal of this<br>
project will be to (1) focus on areas that enable others to more<br>
easily and directly participate in Perl 6 development, and (2) to<br>
work on features critical to Perl 6 implementation for which I<br>
have special skills.  These critical features include compiler<br>
architecture and design, protoregex and longest token matching<br>
in Perl 6 regular expressions, Rakudo alignment with STD.pm,<br>
builtin and external library development, and continued<br>
work on the official test suite.</p><p>Benefits to Perl 6 Development:<br>
All of the items listed in the synopsis above are on the critical<br>
path for a Perl 6 release implementation.  In particular, it is<br>
vital that the core parsing and builtin library features are<br>
correct with respect to the Synopses and STD.pm specifications;<br>
achieving these requires some intensive development and coordination<br>
effort that will be provided by this project.</p><p>Deliverables:<br>
D1. Implementation of protoregexes and longest token matching in<br>
    Parrot's Parser Grammar Engine (PGE).  This is needed for completion<br>
    of regex features described in Synopsis 5, as well as the ability<br>
    to use STD.pm in deliverable #2 below.</p><p>D2. Alignment of Rakudo's parser and grammar with STD.pm.  STD.pm<br>
    is the reference model for parsing Perl 6 programs, Rakudo Perl<br>
    must be consistent with STD.pm to be an accurate implementation of<br>
    Perl 6.</p><p>D3. Continue coordination and development of Perl 6 builtins for Rakudo,<br>
    and investigate development of a common p6-based "Prelude" that can<br>
    be used as a reference (or even directly) by other Rakudo and<br>
    other Perl 6 implementations.  These builtins come from the<br>
    Synopses and form the basis of any working Perl 6 environment.</p><p>D4. Develop and improve Rakudo's ability to make use of external<br>
    libraries, including those written in Perl 6 and other Parrot<br>
    target languages.</p><p>D5. Continue developing, reviewing, and refactoring the official<br>
    Perl 6 test suite and coordinating test suite features among <br>
    various implementations.</p><p>D6. Create additional tests and test suites for the PGE and<br>
    library components developed under the project.</p><p>D7. Publish weekly reports on Perl 6 implementation progress.  This will<br>
    certainly include information about Rakudo Perl, language spec changes,<br>
    and test suite improvements, but can also include information from<br>
    IRC discussions and other Perl 6 implementation efforts.  This is<br>
    needed to continue visibility into Perl 6 progress and to recruit<br>
    more contributors to Perl 6 development.</p><p>Project Details:<br>
The work performed under the Mozilla Foundation/TPF grant has been<br>
highly effective at building development momentum for Rakudo Perl<br>
(Perl 6 on Parrot).  The activities listed under this project seek<br>
to continue and dramatically extend the work performed under that<br>
grant.  In the past few months many more of the precise details needed<br>
for a Perl 6 release have come into focus -- these include:<br>
  * a correct, efficient implementation of parsing tools utilizing<br>
    the concepts embodied in Synopsis 5 and STD.pm,<br>
  * a cleanly organized set of builtin functions and classes that<br>
    function properly and that others can understand and extend, and<br>
  * continued oversight, coordination, and reporting of compiler,<br>
    library, and test suite implementation efforts.</p><p>In particular, this project and its deliverables follow the<br>
same general principles of the Mozilla/TPF grants; in particular:<br>
(1) implement key core components (e.g., longest-token-matching)<br>
that are necessary to a Perl 6 compiler and require intensive<br>
or specialized design or development effort, (2) clear obstacles<br>
and coordinate development efforts to allow others to be active<br>
participants, and (3) promote awareness of progress on Perl 6 to<br>
bring more contributors into the process.</p><p>Project Schedule:<br>
The project will take approximately four calendar months.  It will <br>
begin as soon as possible after the conclusion of the Mozilla/TPF <br>
grant in July 2008.  The test suite development and reporting tasks <br>
(D5-D7) are ongoing throughout the project, other work is divided <br>
into four specific "monthly" milestones:</p><p>M1. PGE internal refactors and initial protoregex implementation (D1),<br>
    selected protoregex constructs added to Rakudo's grammar (D2),<br>
    interface design for pre-compilation and external libraries (D3, D4).</p><p>M2. Completed protoregex implementation (D1),<br>
    initial implementation of longest token matching in PGE (D1),<br>
    completed Rakudo grammar migration to protoregexes (D2),<br>
    beginning of P6-based "Prelude" implementation for Rakudo (D3),<br>
    initial implementations of external HLL library support (D4).</p><p>M3. Substantially complete longest token matching in PGE (D1),<br>
    Rakudo using protoregexes and longest token matching in grammar (D2),<br>
    full protoregex and LTM support in Rakudo (D3),<br>
    integrate P6-based Prelude into Rakudo implementation (D3),<br>
    continued improvement of HLL library support (D4).</p><p>M4. Completed PGE protoregex and longest token matching implementation (D1),<br>
    update Rakudo bottom-up parser to align with STD.pm (D2),<br>
    Rakudo and/or compiler tools able to parse STD.pm directly (D2),<br>
    substantial implementation of a P6-based Prelude for Rakudo (D3),<br>
    substantially complete external HLL libraries support (D4).<br>
    updated documentation and tests for all work performed, final report.</p><p>Throughout the project we should also see substantial improvements<br>
in overall Rakudo Perl compiler performance as a direct result of <br>
the work performed in this project.</p><p>Report Schedule:<br>
In addition to the weekly "Perl 6 Status" reports given above (D7),<br>
at the end of each project milestone (approximately monthly) there <br>
will be a progress report detailing progress on the corresponding<br>
specific deliverables listed above.  These milestone reports will <br>
also serve as checkpoints to authorize interim project completion<br>
payments.</p><p>Public Repository and License:<br>
In general, all code and documents will be developed and <br>
stored either in the Parrot or Pugs subversion repositories as<br>
appropriate.  Work on the official Perl 6 test suite will<br>
be committed to the Pugs repository; improvements to PGE<br>
and Rakudo will be committed to the Parrot repository with<br>
any copyrights to be held by The Perl Foundation.  All work<br>
will be licensed under the Artistic License 2.0 .</p><p>Bio:<br>
Since 2004 I have been the lead architect, developer, and project<br>
manager for what is now Rakudo Perl (Perl 6 on Parrot), the Parser<br>
Grammar Engine (PGE), and the Parrot Compiler Toolkit (PCT).  My<br>
previous work on these and other components provides me with unique<br>
experience and insight into the critical needs for designing and<br>
the core Perl 6 features described by this project.</p><p>Amount Requested:<br>
4 months at US$5,000/month  == US$20,000</p><p>Country of Origin:<br>
United States</p><p>Okay to publish proposal? :<br>
Absolutely.</p><p> <a href="http://news.perlfoundation.org/2008/11/tpf_awards_first_hague_grant_t.html">Link To Original Source</a> </p></p>
