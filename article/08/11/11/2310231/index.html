<p><h1> <a name="this_week_on_perl5_porters___27_october_2_november_2008">This Week on perl5-porters - 27 October-2 November 2008</a> </h1><p> <em>&quot;So we're doing things at BEGIN time in UNIVERSAL with source
filters. With a garnish of messing with @ISA in some other classes.
What could possibly go wrong?&quot;</em> -- Nicholas Clark, trying to address
serious bugs lurking somewhere in code this funky.</p></p>
<p><h1> <a name="topics_of_interest">Topics of Interest</a> </h1><h2> <a name="perl_34559">perl@34559</a> </h2></p><p>More feedback on the march to 5.8.9. Dave Mitchell fixed up the
problems with <code>SUPER</code> method caching. Nicholas uncovered a can of
worms in <code>Attribute::Persistent</code>.</p><p>Indeed, imacat had found the problem six
months ago.</p><p> <code>File::Path</code> was the long pole holding up the tent for
the past couple of weeks (my fault). 2.07 is now on CPAN, and
addresses the symlink flaw that the Debian project uncovered.</p><p>

without dropping down into single-step mode. This made him sad, because
it meant that <code>eval</code>ed code was more or less out of reach of his
current obsession, <code>Devel::NYTProf</code>.</p><p>Not letting such a minor issue get in his way, Tim proposed a patch to
give him sufficient fine-grained control to achieve his ends. Nicholas
Clark found the time to run with the patch and produce something that
was compatible with 5.8.9-RC1 (yes, coming soon to a mirror near you).</p><p>

</p><h2> <a name="perl_unicode_bug">Perl Unicode bug</a> </h2></p><p>On the continuing saga of Karl Williamson's single-handed battle to slay
the Unicode deficiencies in Perl, Juerd Waalboer commented that <code>use ascii</code>

had a lot going for it as a putative pragma to deal with the matter. Rafa&#235;l
wanted to see 'legacy' appear somewhere in the name.</p><p>Tom Christiansen penned a fine missive on the perils of <code>\w</code>, <code>\s</code>, <code>\b</code>
and even <code>\d</code>, pointing out that a certain dingbat character is classified
as a digit, but alas, MATHEMATICAL SANS-SERIF BOLD ITALIC CAPITAL PI
isn't. Which is he's given up on all those shortcuts. As a parting gift,
he offered some code to check ASCII characters against all Unicode
properties and so forth.</p><p>Yves Orton had a look at the matter from the perspective of the regular
expression engine, and felt that adding <code>/a</code> and <code>/u</code> modifiers to
enforce ASCII or Unicode semantics would be horribly painful to implement,
and said that he was leaning more towards ASCIIish semantics (for instance

<code>\d</code>, <code>\w</code> and <code>\s</code> would recover their pre-Unicode meanings), the idea
being that people doing Unicode can use properties instead.</p><p>

</p><h2> <a name="perl5db_questions"> <code>perl5db</code> questions</a> </h2></p><p>Edward Peschko had some questions about how the Perl debugger
interacts with the perl binary, so that he could debug the debugger
debugging a Perl script with gdb. Nicholas Clark pointed him in
vaguely the right direction. Richard Foley suggested quite innocently
to Edward that if he came up with anything useful it would be
worthwhile patching the debugger or <code>Devel::Trace</code>.</p><p>

</p><h2> <a name="why_are_the_file_test_operators_in_perlfunc">Why are the file test operators in perlfunc?</a> </h2></p><p>Michael G. Schwern wondered with the documentation for file test
operators (<code>-f</code>, <code>-s</code> ...) lives in <code>perlfunc</code> rather than

<code>perlop</code>. Eirik Berg Hanssen pointed out that if such a change
was made, then he would miss the <code>perldoc -f -X</code> shortcut.</p><p>David Nicol pointed out that <code>perlfunc</code> also mentions <code>last</code>,
<code>next</code> and <code>redo</code>, which are flow control syntax. And thus it's
easy to get at them with <code>perldoc -f</code> too.</p><p>Ren&#233;e B&#228;cker had a patch lying around in an RT ticket
(bug #27886) that, if applied, would extend the <code>-f</code> switch
to look inside <code>perlop</code> as well.</p><p>In the end, the problem is no so much where the documentation
lies, but rather one of how easy it is to obtain.</p><p>

code (and the injection of things into the UNIVERSAL namespace),
John Peacock put forward a proposal to try and put an end to the
confusion that surrounds the issue of handling version numbers in
Perl.</p><p>Michael G. Schwern penned a very thoughtful reply describing the
problems in terms the mental representations that people have
developed to remember how (they think, correctly or otherwise)
version numbers work. He continued by reviewing the documentation,
suggesting better examples, and pointing out that the fact that
1.2 is considered greater than 1.3.0 is a trap waiting to fool
the unwary.</p><p>Dave Golden also chipped in with a number of sensible suggestions
and volunteered to rewrite the documentation in terms of whatever
changes were finally agreed upon.</p><p>

shell slated to be included in 5.8.9. Since the p5p summariser was
busy with other matters In Real Life and had not wrapped up the
final version of <code>File::Path</code>, Nicholas had the time to confer
with Andreas K&#246;nig to determine the right thing to do.</p><p>

Time::Local in terms of it, and add a warning saying it was deprecated
and just use Time::y2038 instead kthx.</p><p>Jesse Vincent wanted to know if Dave meant a warning in the documentation,
rather than the code, since there must be an awful lot of code in the DarkPAN
that uses it. Dave did indeed mean a disclaimer in the documentation.</p><p>He had a second look, and decided that it wasn't even worth the hassle
of trying to do anything, other than just recommending people use Time::y2038
and be done with it.</p><p>

<h1> <a name="todo_of_the_week">TODO of the week</a> </h1></p><p>A task that needs some Perl and internals knowledge.</p><h2> <a name="deparse_inlined_constants">Deparse inlined constants</a> </h2></p><p>Code such as this</p><p>
<pre>
  use constant PI =&gt; 4;
  warn PI;</pre>

</p><p>will currently deparse as</p><p>
<pre>
  use constant ('PI', 4);
  warn 4;</pre>
</p><p>because the tokenizer inlines the value of the constant subroutine <code>PI</code>.
This allows various compile time optimisations, such as constant folding
and dead code elimination. Where these haven't happened (such as the example
above) it ought be possible to make <code>B::Deparse</code> work out the name of the
original constant, because just enough information survives in the symbol
table to do this. Specifically, the same scalar is used for the constant in
the optree as is used for the constant subroutine, so by iterating over all
symbol tables and generating a mapping of SV address to constant name, it
would be possible to provide <code>B::Deparse</code> with this functionality.</p><h2> <a name="checkpods____podchecker"> <code>checkpods</code> -&gt; <code>podchecker</code> </a> </h2></p><p>Woohoo! Alex Vandiver took a crack at solving the <code>checkpods</code>/<code>podchecker</code>
redundancies, and supplied patches galore to do the deed.</p><p>

the <code>PREFIX</code> environment variable is set. Michael G. Schwern thanked
him for his work, and tossed in a couple more suspect variables names
into the mix.</p><p>

constructs to <code>while(cond) {}</code>. He thought this made the empty loops more

the Tolkien quotes that appear at the top, and explained why it
was so important. Johan Vromans wondered why Tom had cited page
numbers, since these may change from edition to edition. Tom
thought that a good place to note the editions used would be in
<code>perlhack</code>, since only hackers would be likely to encounter
them in the source. This was accepted.</p><p>Jan Dubois gathered all the Tolkien quotes Sarathy used to announce
the 5.005 builds.</p><p>Tom went back and produced a second patch, this time against blead.
He noted that <em>ext/threads/shared/shared.xs</em> contains a non-Tolkien
quote, and wondered if a better Tolkien quote might not be found,
should the original authors of the file agree. Artur responded
positively to the idea.</p><p>Working further afield, Tom found another quote that could be
applied to <em>ext/Win32CORE/Win32CORE.c</em>.</p><p>

Rafa&#235;l didn't like the patch format, and also asked about a

impossible to reconcile octal escapes and backreferences within a
regular expression, and that by perl 5.14, octal escapes in a regular
expression should be illegal. For instance, the interpretation of
<code>\17</code> is either the seventeenth back-reference or <code>chr(15)</code>,
depending on spooky action at a distance.</p><p>Karl Williamson reiterated his request for a verdict on whether his
patch is worthy or not (the main sticking point being whether it should
be silent, a warning or an error, contingent as it is on machines
having other than 8-bit bytes). Glenn Linderman replied, but said that
the final cut belonged to the pumpking.</p><p>

</p><h2> <a name="program_to_look_at_char_class_complements___60156_">Program to look at char class complements  (#60156)</a> </h2></p><p>Karl Williamson noted that some characters are matched by both
a POSIX character class... and the complement of the same
character class. Ideally, all characters should be matched
by only one or the other, not both.</p><p>Yves Orton ran some code to probe the Unicode space, and discovered
a distressingly high number of Unicode characters with the same
behaviour. He explained that the problem is essentially due to a
speed optimisation, and the difficulty is reconciling not slowing
down non-Unicode matches against a complete rewrite of the character
class implementation.</p><p>Yves also noted that, to a certain extent, some of the problems
are of our own making, such as a discrepancy between what POSIX
defines, and what is implemented in <em>mktables</em>. Rafa&#235;l deflected
some of Yves's criticism by pointing out that <code>perltodo</code> already
stated the how the current situation was broken. Yves continued
with a post mortem of decisions past, pointing out where and when
we messed up when bringing Unicode handling into Perl.</p><p>In another sub-thread, it took considerable traffic to define
the exact POSIX equivalency of <code>\w</code>.</p><p>

not correctly terminating C strings with a binary <code>\0</code>. The second
was with the regular expression engine incorrectly relying on C string
behaviour and looking for a zero-terminated string, instead of using
the internal length attribute of the string. He suspected that it might

<p>Dave Rolsky uploaded a new version of <code>Time::Local</code> for the 5.10.1
and 5.8.9 maintenance branches, grumbling over the fact that core
was patched instead of having the changes dealt with first in the CPAN

how to deal with the module in the light of Michael G. Schwern's
Y2038+ work.</p></dd><dd>

<p>This followed on from a thread started by Jan Dubois, who was anxious
to see <code>Time::Local</code> working on 64-bit platforms post-2038.</p></dd><dd>

check if this small code snippet looks correct</strong>. But no-one did!
I mean really, is it so difficult to confirm the right way to create
a scalar value containing a single arbitrary unicode codepoint in
UTF-8?</p><p>
