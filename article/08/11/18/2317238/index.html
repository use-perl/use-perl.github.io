back on the chain gang.</p></p>
<p>
<h1> <a name="topics_of_interest">Topics of Interest</a> </h1><h2> <a name="version_pm_synopsis_thoughts_and_an_additional_version_pm_affordance"> <em>version.pm</em> synopsis thoughts and an additional version.pm affordance</a> </h2></p><p>David Golden made good on his promise to write a better synopsis for
version.pm to help steer people out of trouble when dealing with version
numbers and their comparisons.</p><p>Michael G. Schwern pointed out a couple of places where things weren't
locked down, but said that he thought David's take was much clearer.
But as usual in matters of versioning, counter examples popped up to
muddy the waters.</p><p>

</p><h2> <a name="should___upper___match_title_case">Should <code>[:upper:]</code> match title case?</a> </h2></p><p>Karl Williamson read the documentation and saw that <code>[:upper:]</code> should
match title case, except that it doesn't, and an undocumented <code>\p{IsTitle}</code>
does. What to do?</p><p>Tom Christiansen noted that there is still a lot of POSIXy stuff that
Perl doesn't do, but that part of the reason for that is that it's
full of subtlety and traps for the unwary. He would really like to
see a decent collation infrastructure in Perl, but Jarkko Hietaniemi
said that the issues are insanely difficult to resolve.</p><p>

</p><h2> <a name="perl_5_8_8_34711_on_aix_5_3">Perl 5.8.8 34711 on AIX 5.3</a> </h2></p><p>Rainer Tammer sent in the information he had gleaned from building what
will be 5.8.9 on AIX 5.3. He wondered whether it was worth the effort to
continue to deal with 5.1 since it is no longer supported. H.Merijn Brand
explained that the porters have a long traditional of continuing to support
Perl on orphaned architectures; all that's really needed is shell access.</p><p>H.Merijn and Andy Dougherty offered some suggestions and insights to
help Rainer move forward.</p><p>
<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/oxqw4">http://xrl.us/oxqw4</a> </pre>
</p><p>In a 64-bit build, Rainer had exactly one failure in

<em>lib/ExtUtils/t/Embed.t</em>.</p><p>

</p><h2> <a name="_config_archname__on_amd64_windows"> <code>$Config{archname}</code> on AMD64 Windows</a> </h2></p><p>Sisyphus had trouble keeping track of the differences between 32-bit
and 64-bit builds on his Vista box. Jan Dubois and Steve Hay provided
the vital clues to help him figure out what he should be doing.</p><p>
<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/oxqw8">http://xrl.us/oxqw8</a> </pre>

</p><h2> <a name="future_maintenance_plans_for_5_8_x">Future maintenance plans for 5.8.x</a> </h2></p><p>Nicholas Clark added a paragraph to <em>perl589delta</em> explaining that this
release (perl 5.8.9) was likely to be the last of the 5.8 series.</p><p>Jan Dubois pointed out that 5.10.0 has a &quot;testing&quot; feel to it, to which
Dave Mitchell stated that his plan was to have 5.10.1 out by the end of
the year as well.</p><p>Matt S. Trout mentioned that he had found that users of <code>DBIx::Class</code>

do pay attention to <strong>EXPERIMENTAL</strong> labels, and don't mind as much when
things break. But he'd love to figure out how to get them to take development
snapshots for a spin on a regular basis.</p><p>

</p><h2> <a name="change_prefix_to_install_base_in_perlfaq8_and_perlmodinstall">Change <code>PREFIX</code> to <code>INSTALL_BASE</code> in <em>perlfaq8</em> and <em>perlmodinstall</em> </a> </h2></p><p>Michael G. Schwern noticed a dead meme still doing the round, on stackoverflow.com.
So went through the documentation and excised <code>PREFIX</code> and replaced it with
<code>INSTALL_BASE</code>, which is the officially anointed new way of installing modules.</p><p>
<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/oxqxc">http://xrl.us/oxqxc</a> </pre>

</p><h2> <a name="syntax_for_macros___function_composition_at_compile_time">Syntax for macros / function composition at compile time</a> </h2></p><p>Erwan Lemonnier asked for some general syntax advice on implementing
Python-style function decorators to Perl. Michael G. Schwern pointed
him at <code>Method::Signatures</code> and subroutine attributes.</p><p>Matt S. Trout mentioned a secret IRC channel and mailing list where
meddling with syntax takes place.</p><p>

being the poster child for unexpected consequences from low-level changes).
Marcus Holland-Moritz tweaked thing around to get Tk passing again.</p><p>

</p><h2> <a name="questions_about_regcomp_c">Questions about <em>regcomp.c</em> </a> </h2></p><p>Karl Williamson had some very detailed, precise questions to ask regarding
<em>regcomp.c</em>, from which we can conclude that Karl already knows more about
the regular expression than 94% of all Perl 5 Porters. Yves Orton provided
the answers and saw that there was a bug that he needed to fix.</p><p>

  <a href="http://xrl.us/oxqxk">http://xrl.us/oxqxk</a> </pre>
</p><h2> <a name="_34775_causes_run_cloexec_t_to_hang">#34775 causes <em>run/cloexec.t</em> to hang</a> </h2></p><p>Marcus Holland-Moritz uncovered a smoke failure regarding the recent bug
fixes for leaks in PerlIO layers.</p><p>Steve Peters confirmed the failure and reverted the change. For Goro,
it's back to the drawing board.</p><p>
<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/oxqxn">http://xrl.us/oxqxn</a> </pre>

</p><h2> <a name="perl_newsvpvf__lld__is_broken">&quot;Perl_newSVpvf(&quot;%lld&quot;)&quot; is broken</a> </h2></p><p>Hugo van der Sanden picked up the gauntlet thrown down by Michael G.
Schwern regarding the weird results with printf formats, traced it
down through a dense thicket of #ifdefs, and proposed a patch to tidy it
up.</p><p>A long discussion about printf format specifiers and error messages
ensued.</p><p>
<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/oxqxp">http://xrl.us/oxqxp</a> </pre>
</p><h2> <a name="regular_expression_character_classes_and_unicode_">Regular expression character classes and unicode.</a> </h2></p><p>Yves Orton kicked of a request for comments regarding the rewrite/revamp
of character classes and the breakage that has crept in since Unicode. He
received many comments.</p><p>
<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/oxqxr">http://xrl.us/oxqxr</a> </pre>
</p><h2> <a name="add_upstream_flag_to_maintainers_pl">Add UPSTREAM flag to <em>Maintainers.pl</em> </a> </h2></p><p>Dave Mitchell wanted to gauge the interest in adding some metadata for
dual-lifed modules, to track whether changes to blead should be pushed
upstream to the maintainer first, or whether they were happy to fold
changes back at their own speed. Those who replied were in favour.</p><p>Steffen M&#252;ller patched all that was necessary in order to implement
the idea.</p><p>

<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/oxqxt">http://xrl.us/oxqxt</a> </pre>
</p><h2> <a name="clone_fails_to_build_with_blead_34780">Clone fails to build with blead@34780</a> </h2></p><p>Michael G. Schwern reported a failure with <code>Clone</code>, that Marcus
explained was due to the slightly naughty use of an lvalue macro.
But he fixed things anyway.</p><p>

<h1> <a name="todo_of_the_week">TODO of the week</a> </h1></p><p>Here's a biggie for the bored. This task needs C knowledge, and
knowledge of how the interpreter works, or a willingness to learn.</p><h2> <a name="optimize_tail_calls">optimize tail-calls</a> </h2></p><p>Tail-calls present an opportunity for broadly applicable optimization;
anywhere that <code>return foo(...)</code> is called, the outer return can
be replaced by a goto, and foo will return directly to the outer
caller, saving (conservatively) 25% of perl's call&amp;return cost, which
is relatively higher than in C.  The scheme language is known to do
this heavily.  B::Concise provides good insight into where this
optimization is possible, ie anywhere entersub,leavesub op-sequence
occurs.</p><p>
<pre>

  perl -MO=Concise,-exec,a,b,-main -e 'sub a{ 1 }; sub b {a()}; b(2)'</pre>
</p><p>Bottom line on this is probably a new pp_tailcall function which
combines the code in pp_entersub, pp_leavesub.  This should probably
be done 1st in XS, and using B::Generate to patch the new OP into the
optrees.</p><hr>
<h1> <a name="patches_of_interest">Patches of Interest</a> </h1></p><h2> <a name="v5_10_0_pod_text_pm_can_t_call_method_pod2text_without_a_package_or_object">v5.10.0 <em>Pod/Text.pm</em> Can't call method <code>pod2text</code> without a package or object</a> </h2></p><p>Jari Aalto had a problem using <code>pod2text</code> in 5.10 and offered a patch
to reinstate the previous behaviour.</p><p>Michael G. Schwern had a closer look at what was going on and concluded
that the real problem was the fact that <code>Pod::Text</code> was using
<code>Pod::Simple</code> incorrectly. He also pointed out that <code>pod2text</code> as a
function has been deprecated for nearly half of Perl 5's lifetime.</p><p>

</p><h2> <a name="configure_ndbm_file_add_prototype_detection_for_ndbm_header_files"> <em>Configure/NDBM_File</em> Add prototype detection for NDBM header files</a> </h2></p><p>Marcus Holland-Moritz offered a couple of patches to sort out the
problems that have been observed recently with respect to determining
the availability of NDBM. He and H.Merijn Brand had everything settled
down by the end of the week.</p><p>

</p><h2> <a name="threads_changes">threads Changes</a> </h2></p><p>Nicholas Clark is busy wrapping up 5.8.9, and he noted the fact that
5.8.8 shipped with <code>threads</code> 1.07, but 5.8.9 will ship with 1.71.
An amazing amount of work was done, mostly by Jerry D. Hedden, and
Nicholas wanted to know if it was possible to summarise the main
changes in three or fours points.</p><p>Jerry responded with a patch that contained what he thought were the
most important improvements, which Nicholas applied with thanks.</p><p>

documenting sub-optimal behaviour was not the same improving the behaviour.</p><p>

</p><h2> <a name="map_leaks_memory___53038_">map leaks memory (#53038)</a> </h2></p><p>Marcus Holland-Moritz suggests that this has been fixed by change #34776
and that bug #48004 is something else altogether (a question of maps within
maps not freeing intermediate temporaries and thus consuming 300Mb when
9Mb should suffice).</p><p>

being applied.</p><p>

</p><h2> <a name="h2xs_does_not_handle_properly_enum_constants___55896_">h2xs does not handle properly enum constants (#55896)</a> </h2></p><p>Back in June, Steve Peters said that he thought fixes applied to <code>h2xs</code>
in the meantime should have resolved the problems encountered in the bug
report. Jeremy Ratcliffe replied this week, saying that only one bug
had been fixed in 5.10, all the others remained.</p><p>

minus character are interpreted in the presence of a unary minus.</p><p>

the directory containing your home directory does not have the read bit
set (in order to prevent you from snooping the names of the other accounts
in a shared environment -- which seems pretty dumb if <em>/etc/passwd</em> is
readable, but who am I to argue with an ISP?)</p><p>

summons no black smoke, then a CPAN release of <code>PerlIO::via</code> will fix
older Perls as well.</p><p>

where he suggested that octal escapes in regular expression be outlawed.
He agreed that they should be put on board the deprecation train, but
could be retained inside character classes. He also noted some marvellous
inconsistencies in error messages.</p><p>Glenn Linderman suggested stealing Python's OoNNN octal notation.</p><p>It will take considerable effort on the part of the porters to convince
Tom Christiansen of the need to deprecate octal in regular expressions.
His main argument is that today, the <code>\g</code> escape can be used to
disambiguate backreferences from octal. Chip Salzenberg waltzed in to
say that he threw his lot in with Tom.</p><p>Undaunted, Glenn replied that there is a definite problem in that
certain octal numbers may not be expressed in a pattern, depending
on the number of backreferences. And when patterns are created by
<code>qr//</code> composition, which was Yves Orton's point, this may not
even be evident by casual inspection).</p><p>Tom subsequently posed to Andrew Hume, one of the original authors
along with Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie, of C, Unix and regular
expression, the question of how they dealt with the octal notation
backreference ambiguity at the very beginning. And provided a whole
pile of links for people who want to know more about the history
of the matter.</p><p>

that consider some ferociously large numbers that end in 89.2 being
larger than the same number ending in 90. Appending a .0 to the latter
makes things work, but is considered distasteful.</p><p>

fact that the default handler is loaded transiently in the switch from
the old handler to the new.</p><p>Chip Salzenberg brought the house down with an awesome patch to solve
the problem, which he thought would probably fix up some sub-optimal
behaviour that has probably been around ever since 5.000.</p><p>Amid the general applause, Marcus Holland-Moritz expressed concern Chip's
patch alters the signature of a public API. Chip took Marcus's concerns
on board and wanted to know what the current policy was regarding the
modification of a public call.</p><p>In a side note, Chip noted why companies like IBM et al invest on Linux
but not FreeBSD, in a sub-thread relating to how difficult it is to
get companies interested in supporting Perl.</p><p>Chip came back afterwards with a second iteration of the patch that
Marcus applied with a minor tweak or two.</p><p>

routines in a Safe compartment on a threaded perl. He mentioned
that Andrew Gierth had tracked the problem down to a difference in
the implementation of stashes. In a non-threaded perl, a cop points
to the stash, but in a threaded-perl a level of indirection is
introduced and it points to the name of the stash.</p><p>

<h1> <a name="in_brief">In Brief</a> </h1></p><p>Tom Christiansen wondered about <code>strange permissions</code> on files, such
as executable bits of files that would never be executed.</p><p>

<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/oxqze">http://xrl.us/oxqze</a> </pre>
</p><p>He'd also like to see a useful <strong> <code>ctags</code> target in <em>Makefile</em> </strong>, which
would probably require some Configure probes.</p><p>

  <a href="http://xrl.us/oxqzg">http://xrl.us/oxqzg</a> </pre>
</p><p>Joshua Hobbit wondered whether replacing <strong> <code>Time::Local</code> by <code>Time::Y2038</code> </strong>

(that is, a notorious bug) was particularly wise in terms of names.</p><p>

</p><p>Jerry D. Hedden saw that change #34653 breaks DBM functionality, but
Marcus was quick to make a change that he thought would repair it.</p><p>

  <a href="http://xrl.us/oxqzk">http://xrl.us/oxqzk</a> </pre>
</p><p>Yves Orton <strong>added some files to <em>.gitignore</em> </strong>.</p><p>

  <a href="http://xrl.us/oxqzn">http://xrl.us/oxqzn</a> </pre>
</p><p>PerlIO resource leaks on <strong> <code>open()</code> and then :pop in :unix and :stdio</strong>
(bug #56644). Leaks no longer, thanks to GFUJI's patches, applied
by Steve Peters.</p><p>
<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/oxqzp">http://xrl.us/oxqzp</a> </pre>
</p><p>And another: <strong> <code>ungetc()</code> to :scalar</strong> might cause problems (bug #57322).
I suspect Steve went through Ren&#233;e B&#228;cker's list of bug reports
containing patches.</p><p>

</p><p>John E. Malmberg began to <strong>get POSIX exit mode working/tested on VMS</strong>.
Applied by Craig A. Berry.</p><p>

</p><p>Karl Williamson wanted to <strong>use charnames in <code>Test::More</code> </strong> <code>like</code>

tests, and was told to use <code>qr//</code> to minimise the pain.</p><p>
