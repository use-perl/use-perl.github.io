<p><h1> <a name="this_week_on_perl5_porters___20_26_october_2008">This Week on perl5-porters - 20-26 October 2008</a> </h1><p> &quot;So we have an existing bug. Sometimes \400 matches \400, and
sometimes it matches \01\00, depending on what I would call spooky
action at a distance. I'm trying to get rid of these inconsistencies.
I think something should be done here, but perhaps its not what I
thought it should be. My patch follows what the code was intending
to do, but perhaps we should change that intention. Please guide
me.&quot; -- Karl Williamson, trudging around in the depths of Unicode.</p></p>
<p><h1> <a name="topics_of_interest">Topics of Interest</a> </h1><h2> <a name="exported_symbols__the_perl_api">Exported symbols: the perl API</a> </h2></p><p>H.Merijn Brand shared with us one of the more exciting aspects of
configuring perl. The <em>embed.pl</em> program goes through the source
and pulls out the name of every function marked as public and saves
them in <em>global.sym</em>.</p><p>H.Merijn discovered that there's no test to check see if what is
found is truly available. Configure a perl with <code>-Duseshrplib</code> for
example, and many are not.</p><p>Using some unportable code, he whipped up a program to list
everything that was supposed to be available but wasn't. He
wanted to know if a Windows expert could code up something
similar that would work on that platform.</p><p>

the perl binary) but got things sorted out. I'm not sure if
Ken Williams pushed the changes upstream to his repository.</p><p>

</p><h2> <a name="git_info"> <code>git-info</code> </a> </h2></p><p>Michael G. Schwern lamented the lack of an equivalent command
in git for <code>svn info</code>, so he wrote an analogue in Perl.
Aristotle thought that he had just reinvented EasyGit. Michael
had a look, was impressed, but decided that the information
<code>eg info</code> produced wasn't of vital importance.</p><p>

</p><h2> <a name="freebsd_7_libc_r_detection">FreeBSD 7 <code>libc_r</code> detection</a> </h2></p><p>Tony Cook supplied a very welcome patch to solve the problem
of configuring perl on FreeBSD 7 with threads, when the
threads compatibility shims are not installed. Chris Williams
had a feeling that this would allow bug #57458 to be closed.</p><p>So Chris set about checking the results and confirmed that
the patch was good and the bug was dead.</p><p>

</p><h2> <a name="problems_attempt_to_load_storable">Problems attempt to load <code>Storable</code> </a> </h2></p><p>While <code>Storable</code> was the symptom, the cause was trying
to compile XS extensions with Sun's C compiler for a perl 5.6.1
compiled with gcc.</p><p>Nicholas Clark wrote an elaborate recipe for modifying
<em>Config.pm</em> to make things work. Andy Dougherty thought
that it all made sense, but both were in agreement that
the easiest way forward for Tim Smith, who posed the
question initially, would be to recompile everything with
Sun's compiler.</p><p>

</p><h2> <a name="pl_ors_sv_in_devel__ppport"> <code>PL_ors_sv</code> in <code>Devel::PPPort</code> </a> </h2></p><p>H.Merijn Brand needed to perform a <code>local</code>ised <code>undef $\</code>,
which was trivial under 5.8.x and beyond, but just about
impossible under 5.6 due to radical differences in the
underlying implementations.</p><p>He wondered if there was a way of pushing the problem off
onto <code>Devel::PPPort</code>. Marcus Holland-Moritz thought it was
pretty much impossible. H.Merijn contented himself with
marking the module as unsuitable for use with 5.6 and below.</p><p>

problem, and therein lay the solution.</p><p>

</p><h2> <a name="perl_34559">perl@34559</a> </h2></p><p>Nicholas Clark produced what he fervently hopes is the last
snapshot for perl 5.8.9, with six issues outstanding. If
anything else is broken, it will be for anyone else to fix.</p><p>Slaven Rezic posted an impressive list of modules that he
had tested against recent versions of 5.8-maint, and he and
Nicholas went through them. A number of failures were
deemed acceptable, since they represented the nailing down
of greyer parts of the implementation. Other failures were
due to relying on implementation bugs that were also fixed.</p><p>Of the six main problems, David Landgren posted updates for
<code>File::Path</code> and Ken Williams gave p5p co-maintainer
status for <code>Pathtools</code>.</p><p>Modules were looked at, such as <code>IO::Mark</code>, <code>constant</code> and
<code>Business::ISBN</code>. SUPER method caching was examined, as
were format references.</p><p>

</p><h2> <a name="next_api_question_for_devel__ppport">Next API question for <code>Devel::PPPort</code> </a> </h2></p><p>H.Merijn Brand wanted to be able to rely on <code>Perl_pv_pretty</code> and
<code>Perl_pv_escape</code> in any version of Perl. Marcus Holland-Moritz
initially said that it would be difficult, but went ahead and
did it anyway. This now gives H.Merijn a <code>pv_display</code> that does
UTF-8 right.</p><p>

to a change in behaviour of MRO (method resolution order).
Nicholas Clark hoped that Brandon Black, author of <em>mro.c</em>
would be able to shed some light on the matter.</p><p>Matt S. Trout said that Brandon hasn't been available to look
at Perl stuff for months and so he would try and find the time
to look at it, but didn't make any promises as to when that
could be.</p><p>

Schwern offered a couple of tips to get it to work.</p><p>

thread library was meant to apply to 6.x or not, since there was
a discrepancy between the log message and code.</p><p>Nicholas admitted that the patch was wrong and 6.x was being
treated the same way... but since things continued to work on
6.x, he wasn't sure whether to take it out or leave it.</p><p>

<h1> <a name="todo_of_the_week">TODO of the week</a> </h1></p><p>A new task that only need Perl knowledge (and an ability to use
<code>grep</code> or <code>ack</code>).</p><h2> <a name="parallel_testing">Parallel testing</a> </h2></p><p>(This probably impacts much more than the core: also the Test::Harness
and TAP::* modules on CPAN.)</p><p>All of the tests in <em>t/</em> can now be run in parallel, if <code>$ENV{TEST_JOBS}</code>

is set. However, tests within each directory in <em>ext</em> and <em>lib</em> are still
run in series, with directories run in parallel. This is an adequate
heuristic, but it might be possible to relax it further, and get more
throughput. Specifically, it would be good to audit all of <em>lib/*.t</em>, and
make them use <code>File::Temp</code>.</p><hr>
<h1> <a name="patches_of_interest">Patches of Interest</a> </h1></p><h2> <a name="revert_const_ing_in_cygwin_c">Revert const'ing in <em>cygwin.c</em> </a> </h2></p><p>Changes to blead and backports to 5.10 left some consting
problems that caused the compiler to grumble a bit. This
patch was to clean up the warnings on 5.10, and appears to
be Warnocked.</p><p>

</p><h2> <a name="refactor_perl_mem_log___functions">Refactor <code>Perl_mem_log_*</code> functions</a> </h2></p><p>Marcus Holland-Moritz discovered a nest of duplicate code
in various logging functions, and factored out what he could
into a workhorse function. He hinted that this patch needed
to go in, so that he could deliver a putative &quot;SV allocation
tracing&quot; patch.</p><p>
<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/owapt">http://xrl.us/owapt</a> </pre>
</p><h2> <a name="add_sv_allocation_tracing_to__dm_and_perl_mem_log">Add SV allocation tracing to <code>-Dm</code> and <code>PERL_MEM_LOG</code> </a> </h2></p><p>Despite receiving no feedback from the above patch, Marcus
went ahead and applied his SV tracing patch. This works by
adding an additional field in debugging build to SVs, in
which a unique serial number can be stored.</p><p>When a leak is spotted, the serial number can be read. The
code is run a second time, this time setting a break-point
on <code>new_SV()</code> watching for the creation of the SV with the
same serial number. From there it usually become a trivial
matter to work out who's responsible for making the mess.</p><p>

</p><h2> <a name="fix_prototype_detection_for_c__">Fix prototype detection for C++</a> </h2></p><p>Marcus Holland-Moritz isolated a problem with incorrect
function prototypes for C++ and suggested an improvement.
H.Merijn Brand, as Configure pumpking was a bit concerned
since the change would have a potentially large impact.
But as it turned out, the fact that he had switched
Configure over entirely to git simplified the house-keeping
tasks considerably.</p><p>

</p><h2> <a name="use_of_freed_comppad_array_during_clear_yystack__">Use of freed comppad array during <code>clear_yystack()</code> </a> </h2></p><p>Marcus Holland-Moritz spotted a bug that using PERL_POISON picked
up. (That is, filling the contents of deallocated pointers with
garbage to trigger segfaults from attempts to dereference said freed
pointers).</p><p>The problem was that a variable was freed, set to NULL,
and freed again. And in real life this works out nicely.</p><p>But for the sake of correctness, Marcus wrote a patch to
make things work correctly, whether PERL_POISON is defined
or not.</p><p>

</p><h2> <a name="not_silently_casting_away_constness_in_sv_macros">Not silently casting away constness in SV macros</a> </h2></p><p>Marcus also noticed that change #34600 corrected an erroneously
consted SV, and reflected that such problems can lie buried
for a long time since macros like <code>SvREFCNT_dec</code> blindly
cast away constness, thus preventing the compiler from doing
the job we asked it to do in the first place.</p><p>So he thought about how one might go about fixing it, and came
up with some more preprocessor trickery that would allow the
compiler to spot when constness was being cast away.</p><p>Nicholas Clark thought that this was a great idea and committed
a patch to implement it. He then began to start using it, and
it allowed him to fix up some problems straight away.</p><p>

Clark asked for someone else with access to Windows to run
the tests and provide the details to understand what was going
wrong. Tony Cook dug down and found that it was due to an
undefined subroutine <code>&amp;Cwd::getdcwd</code>.</p><p>This allowed Nicholas to understand what was going wrong and
suggest a fix, and Tony reported that it was good.</p><p>

reports in the RT queue about them getting clobbered.</p><p>Abigail explained that this was already possible, and showed how.

and regretted to say he wouldn't be able to fix it properly in time
for 5.8.9. All is not lost though, since he thought it should be possible
to push out a new version via CPAN at some later date.</p><p>

Christiansen wondered if this introduced yet another meaning to
octal representations, backslashed or otherwise. Karl responded that
it was already a mess and he just wanted it cleaned up.</p><p>Glenn Linderman suggested that a better alternative would be to
outlaw octal escapes larger than \377 on 8-bit-byte platforms (as
one can always work around that by using hex encodings).</p><p>Abigail, not usually known to be fond of adding new warnings to
old behaviours thought that in this particular case it might be
worth spitting out a warning if an \NNN octal escape (where NNN
is greater than 0377) is found in a regular expression, on the
basis that it would probably point out buggy assumptions.</p><p>All the people who responded were in favour of Karl's patch being
applied.</p><p>

up in 5.10.0. Abigail thought that this was due to a variation on
the theme of leaky implementation details, like the way A* is
implemented as A(between 0 and 32767 times). Vincent Pit identified
change #29916 as the cause.</p><p>Once Vincent identified the problem, he was able to suggest a few
ways for solving it, each with various costs and benefits. He
produced a patch for 5.8, to get rid of the immediate show-stopper.</p><p>5.10/blead will require a different approach and more work.</p><p>
