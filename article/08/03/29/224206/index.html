<p> <em>&quot;I suspect that by now the Parrot code base has moved on sufficiently
that it's faster and cleaner to start from scratch than to try to
merge over that code.  I might be wrong, but I'd suggest keeping
&quot;redo from start&quot; as an option.&quot;</em> -- Nicholas Clark, not wishing

<h2> <a name="lexical_fatal_pm_and_autodie_pm">Lexical <code>Fatal.pm</code> and <code>autodie.pm</code> </a> </h2>
<p>We now return you to last week's discussion about <code>Fatal</code> (issuing
a warning become a fatal error that halts execution) and how Paul
Fenwick has begun work to make the effect lexical (that is, scoped
to the current code block).</p>

<p>First off, it appears that <code>use lethal</code> has lost out to <code>use
autodie</code>, which doesn't seem like an improvement, but it has the
pumpking's favour.</p>
<p>As the code was more or less ready to be pulled into the code base,
the question was what to do about dual-lifing the module, since
lexical pragmas aren't available in 5.8 and below. Nonetheless,
it would be nice to get rid of the AUTOLOAD craziness on 5.8 and
5.6. Further backwards compatibility would not be required as it
is doubtful that anyone stuck on such ancient versions would be
using <code>Fatal</code> in the first place.</p>
<p>Aristotle Pagaltzis thought it would be useful to have shorthand
import lists to make warnings from all core functions dealing with,
for instance, I/O, to invoke the Fatal machinery. He was also a
little doubtful about wedging the pragma into the Fatal namespace.
It would be better to have Fatal and the autodie pragma be APIs
into the same underlying code.</p>
<p>There was a certain amount of discussion about what happens when
<code>Fatal</code> is used at the package level, and then a <code>no autodie</code>

pragma is invoked in a scope. Paul hinted that he'd be happy to
implement whatever the concensus turned out to be, but while there
wasn't exactly disagreement over anything, some of the corner
cases had some pretty horrible choices.</p>
<p>The messages that <code>Fatal</code> produces when it does its stuff also
came under fire. Paul said he'd look cleaning that up. Aristotle
even volunteered to chip in with the task if needed.</p>

<h2> <a name="wanted__interesting_self_contained_task">Wanted: interesting self contained task</a> </h2>
<p>Nicholas Clark was a bit sad that the idea of learning about how
to hack on perl's internals attracted so little interest. He concluded
that it would not be worth the effort to write up a conference talk
on the matter if it was likely that no new people became interested
in hacking on perl.</p>
<p>Rick Delaney disagreed and said he that thought the self-contained
task idea was worth pursuing. All that is needed is to find another
task, and set up a mentor.</p>

<h2> <a name="perl___33536">Perl @ 33536</a> </h2>

<p>Nicholas Clark released another snapshot that is asymptotically
approaching 5.8.9. At this point the <code>ExtUtils::Install</code> issues
haven't quite settled down on Windows (but subsequent patches to
the list indicate that this is close to being fixed).</p>
<p>Improvements in this snapshot include the quashing of intermittent
threads failures and that it builds out of the box on Stratus VOS.</p>
<p>Steve Hay mentioned that there a couple of his patches that ought
to go in as they quieten a number of compiler warnings on Windows.</p>

<h2> <a name="devel__size_and_bleadperl"> <code>Devel::Size</code> and bleadperl</a> </h2>

<p>Tels noticed (in bug #33530) that <code>Devel::Size</code> was no longer buildable
under bleadperl, mainly due to the promotion of regexps to first-class
REGEXP datatypes. Reini Urban fixed it up as best he could and added an
error message that pleased Paul Johnson's sense of whimsy.</p>

<p>
<h2> <a name="perl_and_cpan_distributors">perl and CPAN distributors</a> </h2>
<p>It all started out with the simple wish of Gabor Szabo to hoist the
information about Perl ports from cpan.org out onto the Perl5 wiki
in order to allow many hands keep it up to date.</p>
<p>The thread then developed into a long discussion about how distributors
of operating systems (such as Debian) go about including Perl in
their distribution. There was much talk about the relative merits
of strategies for dealing with architecture-dependant (read: XS)
components, dual-life modules, and fitting in the distribution
packaging schemes.</p>

<p>Rafael Garcia-Suarez hinted that he wanted to take a fresh approach
to these issues in 5.12.</p>
<p>One of the main problems, articulated by Michael G. Schwern, is the
persistent (literally) difficulty in modifying <code>@INC</code> locally,
without resorting to sub-optimal hacks like <em>sitecustomize.pl</em>.</p>
<p>In the final analysis, we need to allow Perl to allow itself to
be driven by the host packaging system whilst retaining the ability
for a local site to include a fresh new Perl module of which the
packaging system has not yet caught up with.</p>

<h2> <a name="is_posix_fallocate___a_possible_candidate_for_posix_pm">Is <code>posix_fallocate()</code> a possible candidate for <em>POSIX.pm</em> </a> </h2>
<p>Joshau Hoblitt wondered if there was any interest in exposing the
<code>posix_fallocate</code> function to Perl, which allows one to ask the
host for enough contiguous space in which to write out really huge
files, the idea being to minimise fragmentation as far as possible.</p>
<p>Craig A. Berry replied that any serious patch would be
seriously considered.</p>

<h2> <a name="eliminate_cutnpaste_code_in_dump_c">Eliminate cut-n-paste code in <em>dump.c</em> </a> </h2>
<p>Jim Cromie spotted a quick way to chop around 150 lines from
<em>dump.c</em>. Reini Urban noted that part of the code in question
was duplicated in various B and Op modules, so it would be nice
to expose the underlying code via an API, which would simplify
the task of keeping these ancillary modules in sync.</p>

<p>
<h2> <a name="faster_safe_signals">Faster safe signals?</a> </h2>

<p>Nicholas Clark wondered if we could have faster safe signals by
pushing the safe signal check down out of the core runloop into
a small number of suitably hot opcodes.</p>
<p>Tim Bunce wondered if adding branch prediction hints in suitable
places might not produce an even greater performance boost.</p>
<p>All of the experiments tended to produce results whose differences
were lost in the noise.</p>

<h2> <a name="perl_5_10_1_plan">perl 5.10.1 plan</a> </h2>
<p>Dave Mitchell asked what was needed in order to release 5.10.1, such
as outright breakages from 5.8.x and fixes for new things in 5.10.0,
such as some of the quirky edges in <code>given</code>/<code>when</code>, where it is
important to nail them down quickly before too many people get used
to them the way they are now.</p>

<p>Michael G. Schwern mentioned the <code>@_</code> slowdown (which is no more),
problems with <code>ExtUtils::Install</code>, making sure things build out
of the box on Vista and a list of issues that have arisen with smart
matching.</p>

<h2> <a name="local____has_an_unwanted_side_effect"> <code>local $@</code> has an unwanted side effect</a> </h2>

<p>Yuval Kogman described a scenario in which <code>local $@</code> doesn't do
the right thing. It boils down to the latter day <code>DESTROY</code> method
interfering with the orderly behaviour of unwinding exceptions and
transferring information via <code>$@</code>.</p>
<p>After a long discussion as to whether it would be possible to fix
the current behaviour, short of introducing a putative <code>@@</code> variable,
David Nicol suggested a documentation improvement to describe
exactly how things are now, and that's what made it in.</p>

<p>(based on a suggestion by Nicholas Clark in private correspondence).</p>

<p>Here's <em>your</em> chance to get your name in lights, or at least in the
following section of &quot;This Week on perl5-porters&quot;. Take a TODO item,
and... do it! Each week, a random TODO will be featured. To start
the ball rolling, we have:</p>
<p>
<h2> <a name="merge_common_code_in_installperl_and_installman">Merge common code in installperl and installman</a> </h2>
<p>There are some common subroutines and a common <code>BEGIN</code> block in
installperl and installman. These should probably be merged.  It
would also be good to check for duplication in all the utility
scripts supplied in the source tarball. It might be good to move
them all to a subdirectory, but this would require careful checking
to find all places that call them, and change those correctly.</p>

<p>Steve Hay thought he had the patch to end all patches to get
<code>POSIX::access</code> working sensibly on Cygwin using all the compilers
he could get his hands on. No-one commented on it, apart from
Yves Orton via IRC, so Nicholas Clark committed it.</p>

<code>U+10FFFF</code> and waved through as being valid characters.</p>

<p>John Gardiner Myers offered a patch (but no tests) to convert an
attempt to call <code>exit</code> into a warning. This is a highly desirable
feature to have in a multi-threaded environment where a single
<code>exit</code> can really ruin your day (especially when the <code>exit</code> comes
hidden in something downloaded from CPAN)...</p>

<p>The patch makes a Perl stack trace available to a <code>__WARN__</code> handler
so that the offending code can be tracked down.</p>

<h1> <a name="in_brief">In Brief</a> </h1>
<p>S&#233;rgio Durigan J&#250;nior had a few questions about <strong>compiling a
64-bit Perl in a 32-bit system</strong> following on from his problems with
failed tests on PPC64. H.Merijn Brand set him straight.</p>
<pre>
  64 bits for all
  <a href="http://xrl.us/bik4e">http://xrl.us/bik4e</a> </pre>

<p>S&#233;rgio also asked about <strong>make distclean and config.arch</strong> but
received no answers.</p>
<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/bik4g">http://xrl.us/bik4g</a> </pre>
<p>But feedback from H.Merijn on how to solve his problem in a better
way led to the resurrection of <strong>the rarely used <em>config.over</em> </strong>
technique for overwriting Configure behaviour.</p>
<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/bik4i">http://xrl.us/bik4i</a> </pre>

<p>As well as some <strong>problems when setting the libraries' installation path</strong>.</p>
<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/bik4k">http://xrl.us/bik4k</a> </pre>
<p>Having pulled the rug up over things long since swept away and
forgotten about, S&#233;rgio added some smarts <strong>to <code>make distclean</code>
remove <em>config.arch</em>.</strong> H.Merijn applied the concept, if not the
patch itself, to <em>Makefile.SH</em>.</p>

<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/bik4n">http://xrl.us/bik4n</a> </pre>
<p>Paul Green reported that a smoke of <strong>perl@33536 on Stratus VOS</strong>
issued a number of errors that were all due to Stratus VOS's
own take on reality, and not (or nearly never) Perl's fault. He
thus lifted Stratus's option to stall the release of 5.8.9.</p>
<pre>
  98.68% ok
  <a href="http://xrl.us/bik4p">http://xrl.us/bik4p</a> </pre>
<p>Jim Cromie wrote <strong>a patch to improve IS_NUM_COMPARE</strong> by coalescing
all the opcode numbers involved to be contiguous. He was a bit peeved
that it didn't reduce the resulting assembly code, but figured that
at least it renders the code less sensitive to the ability of the C
compiler to perform sophisticated optimisations.</p>

  <a href="http://xrl.us/bik4r">http://xrl.us/bik4r</a> </pre>
<p>Thanks in large part to Eric Wilhelm's tireless efforts, Perl is again

<p>Michael G. Schwern reported that the <strong>patent for &quot;Software Package
Verification&quot;</strong> was nothing to worry about. There had been some concern

by its scope.</p>

  <a href="http://xrl.us/bik47">http://xrl.us/bik47</a> </pre>
<p>H.Merijn Brand reported that perl's Configure script had been
<strong>ported to <code>meta-3.5-20</code> </strong>.</p>
<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/bik49">http://xrl.us/bik49</a> </pre>

<p>Vincent Pit went looking for double warnings for single errors,
and found two. <code>perl -we '\&amp;$x'</code> used to spit out the same
error twice (along with four others).</p>
<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/bik5b">http://xrl.us/bik5b</a> </pre>
<p>and <code>perl -we 'my $a; substr $a, 0, 10, &quot;foo&quot;'</code> did much the
same, so he arranged things to have <code>$a</code> silently upgraded to
an empty string beforehand. Both patches applied.</p>
