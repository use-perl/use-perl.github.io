<h2> <a name="use_encoding__utf8__bug_for_latin1_range"> <code>use encoding 'utf8'</code> bug for Latin-1 range</a> </h2>

<p>The thread about <code>use encoding</code> continued this week. Juerd Waalboer
gave one of the best concise explanations as to why the current model
Perl uses for dealing with Unicode is broken, which is that the <code>\x</code>
hex escape is overloaded for bytes (<code>\x2b</code> <em>versus</em> <code>\x{d0b2}</code>),
and that it takes place too early, while the source is being read.</p>
<p>The result of which is that a source code file encoded in an
Asian language cannot embed a latin-1 character like an e-acute.</p>
<p>Much discussion of remarkable civility followed, regarding what
to do about the matter. Glenn Lindemann put forward the following
ideas:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Deprecate <code>use encoding</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Deprecate non-ASCII characters in 5.12 source code, unless a
source encoding has been specified.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Allow Unicode semantics to be applied to all character operations
on strings (case conversion, caseless comparisons and so on),
regardless of their internal representations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sort out the timing of when <code>\x</code>, <code>\x{}</code> and <code>\N</code> take effect.</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p>No-one appeared to lament the idea of letting <code>encoding</code> go.</p>
<p>Yves Orton pointed out that Microsoft managed to get their Unicode
handling more or less right, albeit at a certain cost to their API,
and regretted that Unix-like operating systems supplied the absolute
strict minimum, pushing all the work onto each and every client
program. Which meant that nothing really worked at all, not even
the so-called shebang line.</p>
<p>Juerd and Nicholas put forward that there is a case to be made for
perl to figure out itself whether a given source file is in ASCII,
Latin-1 or UTF-8. It turns out that it's just about impossible to
construct a sensible Latin-1 file that also turns out to be be valid
UTF-8. The idea is to start out in 7-bit ASCII and carry on until a
byte with the high bit set is encountered.</p>
<p>If this byte introduces a valid UTF-8 character, the rest of the
file must be, too.  Any invalid byte sequences thereafter trigger
a fatal compile-time error. Otherwise it means it must be Latin-1,
in which case similar but different rules apply which also cause
the compilation to halt if encodings change mid-stream. The key
issue is to determine that the encoding does indeed change.</p>
<p>EBCDIC was also mentioned in passing. Sadly, Perl no longer runs
on EBCDIC due to a general lack of nurturing. Then again, if it was
important, Nicholas felt that someone from IBM would have been in
touch at some point.</p>

<h2> <a name="interrupting_system___with_signal_depends_on_signal_handler">Interrupting <code>system()</code> with signal depends on signal handler</a> </h2>
<p>Steffen Ullrich noticed that an <code>alarm</code> signal handler that does
a <code>syswrite</code> as opposed to a <code>print</code> behave differently. After
diving in through <em>pp_sys.c</em>, he noticed that he could make the

<code>print</code> version (which was working correctly) behave the same
incorrect way, by setting <code>$!</code> to undef.</p>
<p>He produced a one-line patch that fixed the behaviour (hmm, did we
get a test?) and Rafael applied it as change #33408.</p>

<h2> <a name="cpan_netbios_broadcasts">CPAN NetBIOS broadcasts</a> </h2>

<p>Linda W was scratching her head wondering why CPAN installations on
cygwin were glacially slow. After running a network trace, she
discovered that what had been a path <em>/var/cache/cpan</em> was being
interpreted as a UNC path (/cache/cpan on host //var).</p>
<p>This caused the local host to send out plaintive calls for host //var
to please call home. Michael G. Schwern thought that this sounded
like the same problem described in CPAN bug #32813, as did Linda.</p>
<p>Yves Orton, current maintainer of <code>ExtUtils::Install</code>, which is were
the problem originated, pushed out a new version and Linda confirmed
that it solved the problem.</p>
<p>Ken Williams was not around to comment on how hard it is to use
File::Spec correctly.</p>

<p>Steven Schubiger's consting patch number 4 from the beginning of the month
was applied. This lead to patches 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9, all applying ever
more consting to <em>sv.c</em> being issued by Steven, which in turn were all
applied by various porters.</p>

would continue to use it locally.</p>

<h1> <a name="thread_patches">Thread patches</a> </h1>
<p>Jerry D. Hedden is doing so much work on threads at the moment, he
deserves his own section.</p>
<p>First off, the patch to not install threads on non-thread builds was
reverted (Michael G. Schwern killer argument being that at least that
way you get a nice error message).</p>
<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/bg94k">http://xrl.us/bg94k</a> </pre>

<p>Then the CPAN 1.69 version of <code>threads</code> was synch'ed with blead.</p>
<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/bg94n">http://xrl.us/bg94n</a> </pre>
<p>As was <code>threads::shared</code> 1.17.</p>
<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/bg94p">http://xrl.us/bg94p</a> </pre>

<p>At the end of the week, he also delivered version 1.18, which added
some diagnostics to help track down what's going wrong when
<em>t/stress.t</em> decides to go belly up.</p>
<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/bg94r">http://xrl.us/bg94r</a> </pre>
<p>Moving along, <code>Thread::Semaphore</code> 2.07 checked in.</p>
<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/bg94t">http://xrl.us/bg94t</a> </pre>

<p>and last but not least, <code>Thread::Queue</code> 2.06 did too.</p>

<p>It looked like <em>t/stress.t</em> in the threads module failed, and so
Jerry asked if there was any chance of seeing what the new diagnostics
had to say. Steve Hay discovered that the problem was in fact a TODO
test that had started to pass, and Test::Smoke got confused and
recorded it as a failure.</p>

<p>David Landgren thought that the test that Rafael Garcia-Suarez added as
part of the fix for this bug should have had the RT bug number embedded
in it somewhere. In other other news, we discovered that there are 485

<p>To the best of my knowledge that statement is not true.
Specifically, it asserts that it is known that Perl does not run on EBCDIC.</p>

<p>All that can be said is that we know that we have no idea of the state of
Perl on EBCDIC, because no-one using EBCDIC sends any feedback whatsoever,
positive or negative.</p>

<p>Is there anybody out there?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...</p>

<h2>Re:he's not dead, he's, he's restin'!</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/speters/">speters</a> on 2008-04-16T18:09:45</h3>
<p>We did hear from the MPE/iX folks a while ago, so, obviously it works there.  It might be more correct to say "legacy IBM operating system" since support on z/OS is suspect and support for i5/OS (the OS formerly known as OS/400) is unknown since we've not heard from them in ages.</p>

<p>The problem here is not a lack of trying as it is a lack of access.  I'm sure there is someone knowledgeable enough to help get Perl working well on EBCDIC operating system, but its not easy to come by on a desktop.  Access to existing servers with those OS's is what we need to be able to support them.</p>
