<p> <i>"Take our command, strip off the package, pass the short name and
the calling package to <code>_make_fatal()</code>, and then use magic-goto
to call our subroutine at the end. It's simple, right?  Yet I
struggle to find any time when it's <strong>correct</strong>."</i> -- Paul Fenwick

<h2> <a name="getting_blead_via_git">Getting blead via git</a> </h2>
</p><p>Nicholas Clark pondered the layout of files in the build directory.
He thought that it would be useful to have dual-lifed modules
positioned under <em>ext/</em>, and in git parlance they would become
submodules. This would simplify managing the changes between the
CPAN version and blead or maint. But he was wondered how git would
keep track of the same file that is in <em>lib/</em> for maint but in
<em>ext/</em> for blead.</p>

<p>S&#233;bastien Aperghis-Tramoni wondered if Nicholas was thinking
about pragma modules (like <code>strict</code> and <code>constant</code>) too.</p>
<p>Nicholas also wanted to know what support git provided to answer
questions such as ``which changes from this branch have been integrated
into that branch''. Rafael seemed to think it should be possible,
but no people with strong git-fu responded.</p>

<h2> <a name="a_lexical_fatal_for_perl_5_10">A lexical Fatal for Perl 5.10</a> </h2>
</p><p>Now that 5.10 allows people to write lexical pragmas, Paul Fenwick set about
writing a scoped version of the <code>Fatal</code> module (whereby warnings become
fatal errors).</p>
<p>He thought that it would be possible to bolt the additional functionality onto
a dual-lifed <code>Fatal</code> module, but the syntax seemed clumsy, and a better
idea would be to build on <code>Fatal</code> to produce an all-new <code>lethal</code> pragma.</p>

<p>There was a certain amount of bikeshed discussion to suggest better
names, such as <code>deadly</code>, <code>autodie</code> and sillier, but <code>lethal</code>
gathered currency as the thread moved along.</p>

<p>
<h2> <a name="fatal__autoload__feature_or_bug"> <code>Fatal::AUTOLOAD</code> - Feature or Bug?</a> </h2>

</p><p>In the middle of adding lethal support to Perl, Paul stumbled upon
a thing of wond'rous beauty. It turns out that you can inherit from
<code>Fatal</code> in a package, and through the magic of <code>AUTOLOAD</code>, invoke
Fatal behaviour by prepending an ampersand to a builtin (&#224; la
<code>&amp;open my $in, '&lt;', '/no/such/file'</code>) or not, by omitting it.</p>
<p>Of course, this functionality is not documented anywhere: neither
the POD, nor code, nor test suite make any allusion to it. As such,
Rafael Garcia-Suarez and a chorus of porters called for the chain-saw
to have the beast put out of its misery.</p>

</p><p>Tom Callaway was happy to announce that, thanks in large part to the efforts of
Andy Armstrong, Nicholas Clark and Rafael Garcia-Suarez, the upcoming Fedora
9 release will contain perl 5.10.0. This should be available in late April.</p>

<h2> <a name="safely_supporting_posix_sa_siginfo">Safely supporting POSIX <code>SA_SIGINFO</code> </a> </h2>
</p><p>POSIX offers various ways to define C routines that may be used as
signal handlers, one of which gives the routine access to additional
information. This in turn offers the handler more context with which
to figure out what is going on. Some years back, Jarkko Hietaniemi
wrote some code to expose this richer interface to a signal handler
written in Perl.</p>
<p>Nicholas Clark ran across Jarkko's work this week, and realised
that it no longer worked in the age of safe signals, because the
lag between the signal's arrival and its delivery to Perl results
in the extra information being lost. He thought that there was a
way to make things work, as one of the allowed system calls in a
signal handler is <code>write</code>, and with this he could squirrel the
information away somewhere until it is safe to fetch it.</p>

<p>His scheme was to install a shim at the signal arrival to write the
information to a conveniently pre-opened pipe, and then after the
current opcode has been run, see if there are any piped signals
waiting.  If there are, then the information is pulled out of the
pipe, unpacked (since it is all intra-host communication, we'd be
free to write out raw structs), prettied up, and then the safe
signal handler is called.</p>
<p>Tim Bunce admired the deviousness, but wondered if using pipes was
overkill, and asked whether a slab of memory could be set aside for
this use instead. Nicholas pointed out that there is nothing from
preventing a process from receiving multiple signals simultaneously
(they are asynchronous after all), so when all is said and done
one would probably wind up with something that resembled the pipe
infrastructure anyway, only buggy.</p>
<p>Current flaws in the idea include the fact that on a couple of
platforms the siginfo structure is larger than 512 bytes, the largest
atomic write permitted to a pipe. Craig Berry reminded people that
for multiple deliveries of the same signal during the execution of
an opcode are thrown away. Nicholas wondered if that was a bug that
needed fixing. Craig pointed back to previous thoughts he had had on
the subject perl's signal implementation.</p>
<p>Nicholas also mentioned the hoops one would have to jump through in
order to deliver the signal to the right thread in a multi-threaded
environment.</p>

<h2> <a name="refine_make_regen_to_be_more_selective">Refine <code>make regen</code> to be more selective</a> </h2>

</p><p>Jim Cromie was annoyed by the fact that running a <code>make regen</code> will
cause everything to be recompiled (because it generates a slew of
files that tickle major <em>Makefile</em> target rules). So Jim added smarts
to <em>regen.pl</em> to have each file built in a holding pen, and only update
the target file when it differs from previous run.</p>
<p>At first there was considerable debate about using checksums and hash
digests to check whether the files differed. Ben Morrow pointed out
that as both the old and new files were present, and read in their
entirety one could do away with extra trickery and just perform a
simple byte-for-byte comparison.</p>

<h2> <a name="a_question_of_inheritance__encoding_and_aliases">A question of inheritance, encoding and aliases</a> </h2>
</p><p>It started out with H.Merijn Brand tracking down the cause of <em>utf8.t</em>
(from <code>Test::Simple</code>) failure on HP-UX.</p>
<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/bh4ej">http://xrl.us/bh4ej</a> </pre>
<p>This in turn led Michael G. Schwern to discover that there was
something wrong with <em>open.pm</em> and <code>Encode</code>. Rafael Garcia-Suarez
realised that the cause of the problem was due to some sort of
assumption of a routine name being present in the <code>Encode</code> namespace,
something that the new method dispatch of 5.10 may have broken.</p>

<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/bh4em">http://xrl.us/bh4em</a> </pre>
<p>Michael G.Schwern extracted the problem and filed it as a bug.
Rafael fixed that up with change #33486. H. Merijn Brand produced
a similarly entertaining error message by using <code>Encode</code> and
<code>encoding</code> without an encoding name. Michael thought the results
were very pretty, but a better error message wouldn't go astray.</p>
<pre>
  Encode::Alias + open go boom (#51608)
  <a href="http://xrl.us/bh4eo">http://xrl.us/bh4eo</a> </pre>

<p>After the dust settled, Dan Kogai, the Encode maintainer, release
Encode 2.24. H.Merijn was, however, still having difficulties with
the <em>utf8.t</em> with open failing to know what to do about <code>roman8</code>
encoding which appears to be an HP specialty. Michael G. Schwern
tried, and failed, to understand what <code>Encode::Alias</code> was doing,
and/or whether it was doing it incorrectly.</p>
<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/bh4eq">http://xrl.us/bh4eq</a> </pre>
<p>Unfortunately, at about the same time, David Cantrell discovered
that his own 5.10 smoke tests were spewing black, and so Rafael and
H.Merijn suggested he try upgrading to Encode 2.24. Alas, that did
not solve the problem.</p>

<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/bh4es">http://xrl.us/bh4es</a> </pre>
<p>Fortunately, Jarkko Hietaniemi came to the rescue with his ``646''
patch, and this had David up and running again. Alas, Jarkko did
not think that this would help with H.Merijn's roman8 problem.</p>

<h2> <a name="taint__pl_tainting__svtainted_on__svtainted_off__svtaint_">Taint (<code>PL_tainting</code>, <code>SvTAINTED_on</code>, <code>SvTAINTED_off</code>, <code>SvTAINT</code>)</a> </h2>

</p><p>Bram has a large application that wasn't designed to be taint-clean.
Nevertheless, in the middle of the code, he wanted to enable taint
mode briefly in order to bring taint checks to bear on unsafe feeds
coming into the system.</p>
<p>So he used <code>Taint::Util</code> and <code>Taint::Runtime</code> for his nefarious
purposes, yet was surprised when reality didn't quite meet his
expectations, in that a scalar, created before taint mode was
enabled, reading from <code>STDIN</code> will <em>not</em> be considered to have
tainted contents.</p>
<p>Paul Fenwick was horrified by the idea of enabling taint mode at
an arbitrary point during the execution of a program (perhaps missing
the point that Bram's application wasn't taint-clean in the first
place, in which case some taint is better than none). He thought
that the problem of scalars not honouring taint mode if created
before tainting was enables was probably a performance consideration.</p>

<h2> <a name="5_8_9_for_vms">5.8.9 for VMS</a> </h2>
</p><p>Craig Berry issued a status report for the current 5.8 snapshot on
VMS. There are four main problems (three in ExtUtils, one to do
with threads).  Solutions exist for two problems in ExtUtils, the
third may be a question of housecleaning. The threads issue is
related to bug #45053. As this is failing with 5.8.8, Craig suggested
that it could be left documented that way so as not to hold up
5.8.9.</p>

</p><p>S&#233;rgio Durigan J&#250;nior reported a couple of failures in the
test suite when building 5.10 on the PPC64 platform. Dominic Dunlop
realised that the messages were semi-harmless, being indicative of
tests making assumptions on the availability of modules that had
not yet been built.</p>
<p>Since none of the porters run PPC64 machines, it seems likely that
some new hints will be needed for the configuration process to allow
building straight out of the box.</p>

failures. He traced this down to the fact that the source was built using
Sun's <code>make</code>, but that some tests wind up running with a different make,
and they fail.</p>

</p><p>This problem continued to occupy Steve Hay, Nicholas Clark and Jan
Dubois this week. The underlying issue is whether a read-only directory
may not be added to, or may not be deleted. Compounding the problem was
the fact that different compilers return contradictory information
concerning the information returned from the operating system.</p>

<p>Rafael thought the patch looked safe enough, but wondered if it would not
be papering over a deeper bug in handling magic. Vincent Pit was able to

should have used heavier machinery for saving and restoring magic; Vincent

versus <code>builtin( () )</code> </strong> (extra parentheses in the call) and
discovered that she had been bitten by prototypes.</p>

<p>In the process of tidying up a bug report for <code>CGI</code>, Nicholas Clark wondered
if the current <strong>dual life module bug/patch work-flow</strong> was optimal. The
distinctly sub-optimal part is having perl bugs reported to an RT queue at
perl.org, and dual-life module bugs reported to cpan.org RT queues. This alone
makes it difficult to bounce tickets from one queue to another.</p>

<p>Which begs the question, why are we even using RT in two separate domains?</p>

the <strong>cleaning out of RT non-bugs</strong>.</p>
