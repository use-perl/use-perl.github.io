<p>Stockholm.pm has announced the preliminary dates of the 6th. Nordic Perl Workshop.<br> <br>The dates are the 24-25th. of May 2008<br> <br>I am so happy our <i>NPW-ball</i> just keep rolling, if we just could get Finland and Iceland to get involved it would be perfect - I have never visited these countries and I would love to have an excuse to go.<br> <br>But for now I am looking forward to the 2008 NPW in Stockholm.</p>

I'm torn: I have to be in Lille (France) on the evening of May 25th, and I think going into London or Paris for a flight would make the travel time longer than the conference time. Not only that, I've set myself up for way too much travel and I'm still trying to pay for it all.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br><br>As for Iceland, Josh and I are scouting that after YAPC::EU. I think I've found a venue for a workshop. The trick is getting people to want to go to Iceland.

I second this. The Perl Workshop, especially the Nordic, are a great way to visit new countries<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

Iceland might not be so bad a draw - it is in the middle of the Atlantic and might be easier to reach for those coming from the US, albeit there are not many of those for the NPW.<br/><br/>One generally has to fly anyway if one is traveling within Scandinavia, although the train system is pretty good it is more expensive often than flying.<br/><br/>(Iceland)++
