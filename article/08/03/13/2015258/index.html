<p>The Perl 6 design team met by phone on 05 March 2008.  Larry, Allison, Jerry, Will, and chromatic attended.</p>
<p><p> <strong>Larry:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>very little official work appeared to get done this week</li>
<li>corresponded with Simon, Allison, and Patrick on a possible implementation of grapheme-oriented encoding</li>
<li>looks good there</li>
<li>no real spec work thanks to health issues, day job, and my daughter and son in law visiting</li>
<li>working on the <code>gimme5</code> translation of the standard grammar</li>
<li>working on the correct way to extract matches, given a current match state</li>
<li>how to present them to the user</li>
<li>... through the constraints of the Perl 5 type system which really dislikes having capture objects...</li>
<li>went down one dead end</li>
<li>digging my way out of that</li>
<li>also working with putter, who's trying to pull together threads around the concept of a unified AST</li>
<li>that's a valuable work</li>
<li>trying to encourage him in that</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Allison:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>launched the security PDD</li>
<li>reviewed Simon's first draft of the character sets PDD</li>
<li>includes an interesting new way of representing graphemes</li>
<li>we've gone through various names</li>
<li>UCS-4/NFG seems to be the most comprehensive name</li>
<li>finalizing a few details now on the PMC branch</li>
<li>we plan to merge that in on Saturday</li>
<li>tracking down one segfault on Windows</li>
<li>prevents PGE from compiling to bytecode</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Jerry:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>focusing on Summer of Code applications</li>
<li>I volunteered to manage Parrot and Rakudo projects</li>
<li>submitted as part of TPF</li>
<li>working with Eric Wilhelm, who really has his act together</li>
<li>Will will be my backup</li>
<li>good to have backups for all of our positions</li>
<li>trying to offload some of my tasks to other willing hackers</li>
<li>one of those is the YAML serialization</li>
<li>hope to give that over to Will or Stephen Weeks this week</li>
<li>spending the rest of my time debugging PDD 17 branch on Windows with Allison</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Will:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>working on Tcl on the PDD 17 branch</li>
<li>nothing particularly Perl 6-y</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>c:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>fixed the HLL segfaults</li>
<li>fixed a segfault in the copy opcode</li>
<li>this seems to have fixed most of Tcl and Lua</li>
<li>did more work on the PDD 17 PMC update</li>
<li>made a list of potential tasks for sponsored development</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Jerry:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>does Moose buy you anything on Perl 5, Larry?</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Larry:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>possibly</li>
<li>can it easily produce an object which has all of hash, scalar, and array interfaces simultaneously?</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Jerry:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>I don't know that offhand</li>
<li>I know someone who does though</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Larry:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>my problems are not so much the implementation as on the conceptual end</li>
<li>getting my brain around what a match object is</li>
<li>when you say <code>make</code> something or other, how much that replaces what's there and how much that augments the scalar part of what's there</li>
<li>trying to think through that</li>
<li>the main issue that I have is confusing the harvesting of subnodes with the stacking up of subnodes at the same level</li>
<li>the latter should make lists of matches rather than embedding them</li>
<li>just a matter of getting a translation to Perl that will do that once I've thought it through</li>
<li>maybe Moose will help me there</li>
<li>it's a good idea</li>
<li>it might run slower</li>
<li>my purpose in translating to Perl 5 is not to get a perfect translation but just to get one that will run the standard grammar</li>
<li>doesn't have to be pretty</li>
<li>only correct enough in the areas that matter to get it to run</li>
<li>if correctness were a bigger goal, I'd certainly use Moose</li>
</ul></p>
