<p>The Perl 6 design team met by phone on 12 March 2008.  Allison, Jerry, Will, Mitchell, Nicholas, Jesse, and chromatic attended.</p>
<p><p> <strong>Allison:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>concurrency summit was very eye-opening</li>
<li>the discusses circled around and came close to what I concluded for the Parrot concurrency model</li>
<li>launched the PDD 17 implementation</li>
<li>a lot of this implementation was cleaning up old, bad PMC implementations</li>
<li>it shakes out old bugs</li>
<li>gives us a chance to do some general cleanup</li>
<li>working on OSCON now for the next few days</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Jerry:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>haven't had much time to make commits this week</li>
<li>just a couple of fixes to Tcl</li>
<li>good to see that working so well on Windows</li>
<li>working with Eric on Google's SoC</li>
<li>he sent off the application earlier this week</li>
<li>we're waiting for the good news</li>
<li>Patrick's getting married on Friday</li>
<li>next week, he and Paula will be traveling around the southwest, generally having a fun vacation</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Jerry:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>there's a thread on the mailing list about setting up a Parrot workshop at YAPC::NA</li>
<li>Patrick plans to submit a few talks</li>
<li>I may too</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>c:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>I rewrote a lot of PMCs</li>
<li>that helped us do the merge</li>
<li>did some profiling, made some optimizations</li>
<li>looking into an alignment bug with GCable elements</li>
<li>Andy Dougherty and Jerry are seeing it on Solaris and Windows, respectively</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Will:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>new Parrot monthly release next Tuesday, 0.6.0</li>
<li>includes all of the PMC updates</li>
<li>a lot of languages are in a better state now than they were before the merge</li>
<li>I did some Tcl work recently</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Nicholas:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>trying to work out what Perl 5 needs in terms of day-to-day bug flux</li>
<li>might be useful to employ someone to handle that full time</li>
<li>we have about a week's worth of bugs that comes in every week</li>
<li>volunteers aren't doing that</li>
<li>that'll be relevant to Perl 6 in the long term</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Richard:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>TPF elections are underway, should be over in two or three days</li>
<li>supporting Eric with the GSoC stuff</li>
<li>lurking on the p5p discussion that Nick mentioned</li>
<li>trying to figure out where the funding is coming from</li>
<li>I'd like to get TPF to help out there</li>
<li>discussing similar things with regard to Perl 6 in the past weeks</li>
<li>those are positive</li>
<li>they want to support people and get TPF to the place where it can disperse that support</li>
<li>hoping that the elections help get TPF in better shape for that</li>
<li>I'll be at Eclipse Con next week</li>
<li>closed-door meetings with their brass</li>
<li>they're supportive of TPF</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Mitchell:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>my hacking's speculative</li>
<li>looking at several pieces of Perl 6 implementations that have accumulated</li>
<li>trying to find a way to combine them into a usable implementation to help an active P6 coding community re-gel</li>
<li>sometimes trying to make it easier to access existing components</li>
<li>sometimes trying to make them more accessible to reuse other parts</li>
<li>we've had five or six intended full stack pieces, but none of them expose a parse tree (Pugs doesn't really have one)</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Jesse:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>is it a small matter of programming, or are things blocking your way?</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Mitchell:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>mostly my time now</li>
<li>may be Parrot resources in the future</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Jerry:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>we should coordinate talk submissions for YAPC</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Jesse:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>is there a hackathon scheduled?</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Jerry:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>just the workshop</li>
</ul></p>
