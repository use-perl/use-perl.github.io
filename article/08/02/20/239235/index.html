<p> <i>&quot;So should we punt in this case and revert to the old warning for
<code>SvGAMAGICAL</code>? My personal opinion is to leave it. People doing
strange things should not be surprised by strange results.&quot;</i> --
Rick Delaney, debating the Principle of Least Surprise (or something
like that).</p></p>

<h2> <a name="stratus_vos_patches">Stratus VOS patches</a> </h2>
<p>Paul Green delivered his work to make perl 5.8, 5.10 and blead work
on Stratus VOS. The main sticking points are a filename that begins
with a '-' (minus), and filenames longer than 32 characters.</p>
<p>Some of the remaining test suite failures were due to VOS's slightly
funky TCP stack implementation, and Paul was slightly suspicious
that one of the failures indicated a problem in VOS's implementation
of UDP.</p>
<p>Martien Verbruggen explained the finer points of POSIX's <code>ctime</code>
behaviour to help Paul understand another failure, and that <code>%e</code>
would be the best thing to use. Unfortunately, other so-called
POSIX-compliant platforms <em>don't</em> implement <code>%e</code>, so it can't
be used in perl's test suite.</p>

<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/bghyh">http://xrl.us/bghyh</a> </pre>
<p>Paul later listed the remaining issues on Stratus VOS and was happy
to learn that in some ways VMS is even more restrictive than VOS.</p>

<h2> <a name="ext_time_piece_piece_xs_use_of_strptime"> <em>ext/Time/Piece/Piece.xs</em> use of <code>strptime</code> </a> </h2>

<p>In the above process, Paul had a close look at <code>strptime</code> used in
<code>Time::Piece</code> and thought it looked suspiciously identical to
FreeBSD's own implementation, but it lacked the grace to acknowledge
FreeBSD with a copyright.</p>
<p>Jerry D. Hedden demanded it be pulled from the core. People explained why
this was not possible (modules check in, but they never check out) and
that the module had received Larry Wall's blessing of The Right Way to
do time manipulations. Other people complained that while the module
was useful, the name was too cutesy by half.</p>
<p>Matt Sergeant owned up to being the responsible party, and said he'd
reinstate the copyright, which probably was chopped in an edit by mistake.</p>

<h2> <a name="syntax_proposal_for_matching_balanced_strings">Syntax proposal for matching balanced strings</a> </h2>
<p>Johan Vromans noted that 5.10 regexp enhancements had made it much easier
to write regular expressions that match balanced strings, but that it
would be nice to special-case the easy problems with some syntactic sugar.</p>
<p>Abigail found three flaws in the proposal. David Nicol thought that it
would be better, on the Teach A Person to Fish principle, to provide
a good tutorial to help people figure out how to write the expressions
themselves.</p>
<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/bghyo">http://xrl.us/bghyo</a> </pre>
<p>David then suggested an alternate syntax for matching balanced strings,
but no code. And I think <code>\R</code> already means something Unicodish.</p>

<h2> <a name="show_constant_in_useless_use_of_a_constant_in_void_context">Show constant in <code>Useless use of a constant in void context</code> </a> </h2>
<p>Rick Delaney mentioned that he would like to see exactly which useless
constant was being used in void context, rather than the current vague
error message which isn't very helpful. To show he was serious, he offered
a patch that did just that. Rafael thought the idea was Good and
applied the patch.</p>
<p>Hugo van der Sanden listed a number of edge cases where this could lead
to trouble, but Rafael thought that people who triggered the edge cases
should probably know why they were triggering them, and Rick agreed.</p>

<h2> <a name="change_33302_breaks_my_win32_build">Change 33302 breaks my Win32 build</a> </h2>
<p>Steve Hay noticed that change #33302 was falling over on Win32,
with even <code>miniperl</code> crashing. The problem was in <em>pp_hot.c</em>,
where an equality against <code>cLISTOP-&gt;op_last-&gt;op_type</code> was broken,
because <code>op_last</code>, while not <code>NULL</code>, was pointing out the window.
Sven Dowideit reported similar problems on Solaris.</p>

<h2> <a name="change_33313_causing_failures">Change 33313 causing failures</a> </h2>
<p>Jerry D. Hedden reported a new failure in <em>t/op/pat.t</em> that manifested
itself when run with <code>TEST</code>, but not in the harness. Much discussion
followed regarding how the TAP parser deals with garbage.</p>
<p>The failure in <em>t/op/pat.t</em> was resolved to most people's satisfaction. The
underlying problem was a typo: <code>$ = ~/.../</code> rather than <code>$ =~ /.../</code>

and there was a bit of discussion about why that returns the complement of 0.</p>

<p>Sven Dowideit tried added more DTrace probes to perl, notably to track SV
allocations, and module loads but was still having trouble with getting
<em>op.c</em> to cooperate.</p>

<h2> <a name="shell_patterns_are_subject_to_tilde_expansion">Shell patterns are subject to tilde expansion</a> </h2>
<p>Nicholas Clark discovered a latent bug in Configure that would manifest
itself on a machine without a <code>csh</code> C shell installed. He was rather
surprised to trace the origin of the bug all the way back to Perl 1,
and defied anyone to find a more ancient bug.</p>
<p>Given the crappiness of <code>csh</code>, the true miracle is that no-one discovered
this bug sooner.</p>

<p>
<h2> <a name="slowdown_of_sort_keys__hash_under_use_locale">Slowdown of <code>sort keys %hash</code> under <code>use locale</code> </a> </h2>
<p>Marcus Holland-Moritz noticed that <code>use locale</code> prevented a hot C routine
from being cached during a sort of hash keys, and suggested a simple solution,
although he was uncertain whether it could break code out in the wild.</p>
<p>Rafael thought the patch looked fine, and suggested that if a bug did
indeed emerge afterwards, it would probably be due to the magic
handling code (and so the fix would be made there).</p>

  $start-&gt;class;</pre>
<p>produced a <code>Can't locate object method</code> error message. Eirik Berg
Hanssen explained why and suggested an alternate syntax that would
do want Jim wanted. Joshua ben Jore said that it was that way because
no-one had bothered to implement it.</p>

<h2> <a name="testing_b">Testing <code>B</code> </a> </h2>
<p>Jim Cromie said that a full test suite for the <code>B</code> modules would be
a great idea. In the process of improving <code>B::Generate</code>, he had begun
made a good start on doing just that. He posted his current work in
progress and asked if there was interest in having it in blead.</p>

<p>Michael G. Schwern made some very good suggestions on how to better
leverage the testing infrastructure to make Jim's work easier and
improve the quality of the diagnostics when things break.</p>

<h2> <a name="assistance_with_ipc_modules_and_perl_5_10">Assistance with IPC modules and perl 5.10</a> </h2>
<p>Tom Callaway wrote to say that he was preparing perl 5.10 for inclusion
in the upcoming Fedora 9 release, and was having troubles with
<code>IPC::ShareLite</code> and <code>IPC::SharedCache</code>. This was holding up the process
and time was running out, which meant he'd have to go with 5.8.</p>

<p>That these two particular modules were deemed to be on the critical path
puzzled a number of the porters who had either never heard of them or had
only a vague idea what purpose they served. A careful examination of the
failures indicated that these two modules were in fact optional, and
weren't sufficient reason to block the Fedora release.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Tom wanted to know if and how they could be fixed. The
concensus was that it was a 32/64 bit issue rearing its ugly head.</p>
<p>Dave Rolsky was of the opinion that these two modules sucked so much
that no-one in their right mind should be using them.</p>

<h2> <a name="perl_magic_uvar_elem_should_be__u__in_dump_c"> <code>PERL_MAGIC_uvar_elem</code> should be 'u' in <em>dump.c</em> </a> </h2>
<p>Vincent Pit discovered an inconsistency between the magic type <code>uvar_elem</code>
and its symbolic name. He also wondered whether it was even used any more.
Rafael applied the fix and mentioned that <code>DBI</code> and/or <code>Tk</code> use it.</p>

<p>Marcus Holland-Moritz wanted to know if Steve Peters and Jarkko Hietaniemi
were still seeing black smoke compiling this module. If not, this
would allow him to proceed in the release of a new version.</p>

<h2> <a name="use_svtype">use svtype</a> </h2>
<p>Robin Barker straightened out the declaration of <code>sv_type</code> as an <code>svtype</code>
instead of the current mish-mash of <code>I32</code> and <code>U32</code> types, and added a
sprinkle of consting goodness into the mix. Applied by Rafael.</p>

<h2> <a name="doio_c_perl_my_lstat_revisited"> <em>doio.c</em> <code>Perl_my_lstat</code> revisited</a> </h2>
<p>Vincent Pit had a look at the implementation of <code>my_lstat</code> and discovered
that magic was called two times too many and could generate a slew of
superfluous warnings with <code>-l undef</code>. He corrected that and also fixed a test
that was passing when it shouldn't. Steve Peters thought the change looked
good enough and applied it.</p>

<h2> <a name="splitting_op_const">Splitting OP_CONST</a> </h2>
<p>Vincent took Nicholas Clark at his word (from the pp_const, not,
that, hot thread) and split <code>OP_CONST</code> into two separate ops.  He
had it running correctly on both threaded and non-threaded builds,
although no-one picked it up to apply it to blead.</p>

<h2> <a name="updating_thread__semaphore_and_thread__queue">Updating <code>Thread::Semaphore</code> and <code>Thread::Queue</code> </a> </h2>
<p>Jerry D. Hedden cast his net wider in the threads infrastructure and
spent some time working with <code>Thread::Semaphore</code>. After a couple of
false starts and doing battle with <code>Test::More</code> on 5.8.0, he was
able to release version 2.04, which Rafael applied to blead.</p>
<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/bghzn">http://xrl.us/bghzn</a> </pre>

<p>Once that was out of the way, Jerry took a look at <code>Thread::Queue</code> and
added some useful functionality and a whole pile of tests.</p>
<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/bghzp">http://xrl.us/bghzp</a> </pre>
<p>Jerry discovered that <code>Thread::Semaphore</code> will barf on non-numeric
parameters, but will happily accept <code>$sem-&gt;up(0.5)</code> or <code>&lt;

$sem-&gt;down(-1) </code>&gt;.  Whilst these could be construed as being a
semaphore that can't make up its mind and a semaphore being raised,
respectively, Jerry was inclined to classify them as errors as well.</p>
<p>If no-one voices objections soon, that's probably what such shenanigans
will become.</p>

<h2> <a name="don_t_install_threads_files_on_non_threaded_perls">Don't install threads files on non-threaded Perls</a> </h2>
<p>H.Merijn Brand thought that all the threads files that were installed on
a non-threaded build were pretty pointless, untidy and/or a waste of
space. So Jerry D. Hedden patched the installer to prevent that from
happening. Rafael Garcia-Suarez applied it, and H.Merijn rejoiced.</p>
<p>Then he discovered another set of thready files and wondered if they
could be axed as well.</p>

<h2> <a name="more_adventures_on_irix___33849_">More adventures on IRIX (#33849)</a> </h2>
<p>David Cantrell announced that he had warmed up his IRIX iron, and had
taken the previous suggestions and fixes out for a spin. He reported
that the compilation had proceeded somewhat further, but still wound
up crashing and burning.</p>
<p>Andy Dougherty, unfazed by such minor trivialities, moved onto Plan B,
which involves using <code>make minitest</code>, to run a health check on <code>miniperl</code>.
He warned that there may many spurious errors due to tests relying on
modules that have not yet been built but nevertheless may provide some
clues to what is going wrong.</p>

<p>Andy's Plan C would be to compile without <code>-O3</code> optimisation (his
initial suspicion being that the C compiler optimiser is getting
confused). Were David feeling particularly brave, he could pin-point
the offending file by compiling files with personalised optimisation
settings, and the resulting knowledge gleaned from the exercise could
be safely stowed away in the IRIX hints file.</p>
<p>Nicholas suggested David investigate <code>ccache</code> if he was serious
about trying this last approach.</p>
<pre>
  the real question is, how many people still use IRIX?

<h2> <a name="use_of_inherited_autoload_for_non_method_is_deprecated___47047_">Use of inherited AUTOLOAD for non-method is deprecated (#47047)</a> </h2>
<p>Rick Delaney revived a dead bug that had slipped through the cracks in
the run-up to 5.10. Steve Peters applied it, and Rafael Garcia-Suarez
hastily unapplied it, since a minor detail that Rick overlooked in the
implementation caused segfaults on other platforms.</p>
<p>Rafael explained that the ultimate correct fix would add a lot of make-work
code and wasn't sure that the cost was worth it. Rick concurred.</p>

<h2> <a name="__h_affecting_outside_file_scopes___50706_"> <code>%^H</code> affecting outside file scopes (#50706)</a> </h2>
<p>Rick Delaney discovered that <code>%^H</code> hints could leak across file
scopes and thought that this wasn't right. He then created a small
patch that he thought should fix the problem. Rafael believed that
Rick was right, so he applied it.</p>

  <a href="http://xrl.us/bgh2b">http://xrl.us/bgh2b</a> </pre>

  <a href="http://xrl.us/bgh2d">http://xrl.us/bgh2d</a> </pre>
<p>Jerry then needed <strong>help with a <code>threads::shared</code> code issue</strong> that
works on blead but warns on maint.  Rafael solved it neatly by
pointing out that the code in question would never be backported
to maint since the change is technically a change in the API. And
thus it could be wrapped up in <code>#ifdef</code>s.</p>
<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/bgh2f">http://xrl.us/bgh2f</a> </pre>

<p>Nicholas Clark isolated an <strong>interesting self contained task</strong> dealing
with replacing two ops by one op, that would be a nice introduction for
someone wanting to get their hands dirty working on the internals.</p>
<p>Philippe Bruhat expressed interest, but then Nicholas spoiled the fun
by discovering that a one-character patch to <em>opcode.pl</em> solved the
problem nicely.</p>

<pre>
  why is this not automatic?
  <a href="http://xrl.us/bgh2j">http://xrl.us/bgh2j</a> </pre>
<p>Abigail also thought that her TODO tests for issues relating to <strong> <code>keys %+</code>
does not return the correct keys</strong> (bug #50496) had been ignored. Rafael
replied that one of the non-TODO tests was also failing, so he TODOified
it as well, and applied it all in change #33313.</p>
<pre>

  <a href="http://xrl.us/bgh2m">http://xrl.us/bgh2m</a> </pre>
<p>Abigail also tweaked <em>perlfunc.pod</em> regarding &quot;%+d&quot; (plus) <code>sprintf</code>
