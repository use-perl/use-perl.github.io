<h1>64 bit Fedora Core shell account?</h1>
<h2><a href="/user/brian_d_foy/">brian_d_foy</a> on 2008-02-24T00:47:00</h2>
</div> <!-- /span4 -->


<div class="span8">
<p>I'm currently attempting to resolve a problem that the Red Hat folks are
having with <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/IPC-ShareLite/">IPC::ShareLite</a> on 64 bit Fedora Core with Perl 5.10. It's
quite important; in fact it's critical to getting 5.10 on FC.

<p>Unfortunately I don't own a 64 bit box. It seems (thanks <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/nicholas/">Nicholas</a>) that it might be possible
to reproduce the problem using a Perl built with 64 bit ints on a non-64 bit
platform - but I've had no luck in that direction yet and, in any case, I'd
like to test on a 64 bit machine just to be sure.</p>

<p>Is there anyone out there in Perl land who could provide me with a
temporary shell account on a 64 bit Fedora Core machine? That'd have to be
someone who didn't mind me burning enough CPU cycles to build Perl 5.10 from source.</p>

<p>If you can help with getting 5.10 into Fedora by providing access to a
suitable box please drop me a line and earn the eternal gratitude of, well,
everyone really.</p>

<p>Thanks.</p></p>
<p></p>

<h2>Is qemu-system-x86_64 a solution?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/dpavlin/">dpavlin</a> on 2008-02-23T22:44:51</h3>
When I needed 64 box to test Fuse bindings, I used <a href="http://www.rot13.org/user/dpavlin/debian-amd64.html" title="rot13.org">qemu-system-x86_64</a rot13.org> to install and build Debian system. It was slow, but quite useful (sorry, disk image disappointed over time, but you need FC anyway...)



<h2>Good idea!</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/AndyArmstrong/">AndyArmstrong</a> on 2008-02-23T23:09:09</h3>
<p>I didn't know it did 64 bit emulation. That's definitely a possibility, thanks.</p>

<p>Although if anyone <i>does</i> have a real machine that'd be cool too. I can't imagine Perl builds quickly under emulation...</p>



<h2>VMWare?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/sigzero/">sigzero</a> on 2008-02-24T03:59:30</h3>
You could get a VM Image of it...load up VMWare and the FC image and presto. You can download a time limited version of VMWare for your purposes.

<h2>Re:VMWare?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/DAxelrod/">DAxelrod</a> on 2008-02-24T09:17:12</h3>
Unfortunately, according to <a href="http://kb.vmware.com/selfservice/microsites/search.do?language=en_US&amp;cmd=displayKC&amp;externalId=1901" title="vmware.com">the VMWare Knowledge Base</a vmware.com> a 64-bit processor is required on the host in order to support a 64-bit guest.

<h2>I might be able to help</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/DAxelrod/">DAxelrod</a> on 2008-02-24T07:42:22</h3>
My laptop is 64 bit. It's not currently running Fedora Core, but I could install it in a VMWare virtual machine (virtualizing a 64 bit machine on a 64 bit machine shouldn't be too bad). The other option might just be to boot from a Fedora Core livecd.<br><br>Drop me a line at my gmail address (my gmail username is the same as my use.perl username) if I can be of help.



<h2>I can set up such a machine for you if you need</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/numbercruncher/">numbercruncher</a> on 2008-02-24T13:48:07</h3>
Just let me know the parameters you need.  Contact me offline at landman _at_ scalableinformatics _dot_ com



<h2>Thanks all</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/AndyArmstrong/">AndyArmstrong</a> on 2008-02-24T14:20:11</h3>
<p>I think the problem is now solved. I'm going to ask Tom @ RedHat to run the tests on his system again and if they pass then we're done and 5.10 will make it into Fedora.</p>

<p>Thanks for the kind offers of assistance.</p>



<h2>Stupid question...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Alias/">Alias</a> on 2008-02-25T01:17:53</h3>
Didn't the "RedHat folks" have a Fedora Core 64bit box you could use?



<blockquote>

<h2>Re:Stupid question...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/AndyArmstrong/">AndyArmstrong</a> on 2008-02-25T11:04:53</h3>
No, surprisingly.

<h2>Really?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/perrin/">perrin</a> on 2008-02-26T06:08:46</h3>
No offense, but why is IPC::ShareLite necessary for getting 5.10 on Fedora?  There are other ways to share data between processes and some of them out-perform IPC::ShareLite.



<blockquote>

<h2>Re:Really?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/AndyArmstrong/">AndyArmstrong</a> on 2008-02-26T10:43:19</h3>
Yes, certainly. But we had the discussion on p5p and they wanted IPC::ShareLite. So rather than argue back and forth and then miss getting 5.10 in FC I fixed it.



<blockquote>

<h2>Re:Really?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/perrin/">perrin</a> on 2008-02-26T15:51:33</h3>
I just read the p5p thread.  It's unfortunate that Tom didn't believe the people who told him these  modules should be avoided, but I think you handled the situation well.

<h2>you can try test drive</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jozef/">jozef</a> on 2008-02-27T10:14:58</h3>
You can get a free shell access to many architectures and operating systems at <a href="http://www.testdrive.hp.com/" title="hp.com">http://www.testdrive.hp.com/</a hp.com>. Access is only allowed through telnet and ftp and no outbound connections. For testing that doesn't need network connection should be fine.
