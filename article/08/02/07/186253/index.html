<h2> <a name="integrating_blead_changes_back_to_maint">Integrating blead changes back to maint</a> </h2>
<p>Some of the changes regarding Safe for 5.10 crept into the
5.8 maintenance track during change #33111, and Jerry D. Hedden
wondered if this was a bug or a feature. Nicholas Clark cursed
Perforce but felt that it could all go into 5.8 in the long
run.</p>

<h2> <a name="5_8_x_usemymalloc_failures">5.8.x <code>usemymalloc</code> failures</a> </h2>

<p>In a discussion in a bug report (see #50352 below), it will be
revealed that Perl's own <code>malloc</code> is usually faster than the
<code>malloc</code> delivered with the C library. Jerry D. Hedden removed
the <code>-Uusemymalloc</code> from his Cygwin build, thereby switching from
the system <code>malloc</code> to Perl's, thereby gaining a boost in speed
for free.</p>
<p>He reported success for 5.10 and blead, but a few tests failed in
5.8. In fact, the error appears to be there as far as he was able
to go back in history.</p>

<code>catfile</code> and <code>canonpath</code> caused major failures in

<code>ExtUtils::MakeMaker</code> handling on Windows. The more Steve
looked, the more he found the new behaviour confusing.</p>
<p>Michael G. Schwern believed that part of the problem was the
use of <code>catdir</code>, when in fact <code>catpath</code> was what was called
for (regarding the handling of <code>C:</code> as a volume specification).</p>
<p>Ken Williams chalked it up as another case of &quot;<code>File::Spec</code> is
just hard to use correctly&quot;.</p>

<h2> <a name="next_resetting_match_variables___bug_or_feature"> <code>next</code> resetting match variables - bug or feature?</a> </h2>
<p>Nicholas Clark was puzzled by <em>ext/B/t/deparse.t</em> issuing a
warning on 5.10 but not on 5.11, and narrowed it down to
what remained in a match variable at the beginning of a loop.
There was a difference, depending on whether the loop had
reached the end of its scope, or had been short-circuited
via a <code>next</code>.</p>

<h2> <a name="make_perl_y2038_safe">Make Perl Y2038 safe</a> </h2>
<p>After the initial silence following Michael G. Schwern's plea to make
Perl survive 2038, the thread kicked off in earnest this past week.</p>
<p>Some people believed that it was just a question of having a 64-bit
machine and 64-bit <code>time_t</code> datatype. To a certain extent, this is
already the case for many platforms other than Unix, be they IBM
mainframes, VMS minis or even Windows micros. In this case, 32-bit <code>time_t</code>

quantities are shims over datatypes of greater precision, provided only for
compatibility with Unix.</p>
<p>The real problem is that of programs that store 4-byte <code>time_t</code> quantities
in binary files. The other problem is with <code>localtime</code> which is currently
specified for 32 bit quantities, which means that if the system can handle
the year 2050 as an epoch, it might be unable to format it a readable
manner. And one nice thing that <code>localtime</code> does, more or less for free,
is to figure out which time zone you're in.</p>
<p>Craig Berry suggested that the first step would be to plan some tests
to check the results of date arithmetic that push past 2038, mark them
as TODO, and then go about fixing them. It would seem evident that
some <code>%Config</code> variables would be useful to help people determine
what is implemented natively and what needs to be worked around.</p>

<p>Mark Mielke pointed out that the <code>DateTime</code> modules are perfectly
2038-safe, but you still run into problems if you try to map a
DateTime value outside the 1970-2038 range onto an 32-bit epoch value.
Unfortunately, for some people, it's just too slow.</p>
<p>Aaron Crane gave a fascinating historical overview of time handling
in Unix.</p>

<p>Rob &quot;Sisyphus&quot; observed incorrect <code>sprintf</code> behaviour with the
latest MinGW runtime and wondered if anyone else had encountered the
problem. He was hesitant to label it a MinGW bug, since simple C
programs using <code>sprintf</code> worked as expected.</p>
<p>Yitzchak Scott-Thoennes said that he'd heard that the MinGW
developers had tweaked the behaviour of <code>vnsprintf</code>, and that
put Rob on the right track.</p>

<p>Now that <code>lc(undef)</code> issues a warning as it return an empty string,
one of the first (no doubt of many) consequences was that <code>CGI</code>'s
test suite issued a couple of warnings. Lincoln Stein folded the fix

<p>Steve Hay used <code>CGI</code> and uncovered a
bug due to the fact that in 5.10, <code>printf</code> format strings are now
considered tainted. In the case of <code>CGI</code>, the routine in question
reads the contents of an environment variable when composing the
canonical name of the temporary file.</p>
<p>Steffen M&#252;ller suggested a couple of fixes to resolve the issue,
the first one being the least intrusive, the second one being more
to his likely.</p>
<p>Tim Jenness wondered why <code>CGI</code> didn't use <code>File::Spec-&gt;tmpdir</code>

instead, since this particular wheel has already been invented over

<h2> <a name="perl_5_10_storable_extremely_slow_for_large_trees_of_data___50352_">Perl 5.10 <code>Storable</code> extremely slow for large trees of data (#50352)</a> </h2>

<p>Clinton Pierce had a data structure that when dumped with
<code>Data::Dumper</code>, produced about 8Mb of output. The same structure
takes less than a second to be dumped with <code>Storable</code>, as long as
perl 5.6 is used. If perl 5.10 is employed instead, the time taken
balloons out to 5 to 8 seconds.</p>
<p>Naturally he wanted to know whether this was a bug. Nicholas Clark
suggested he take the 2.18 version available on CPAN (which is
bundled with 5.10) to see if there was any difference on 5.6 (thereby
isolating the problem to the module or the core. Unfortunately
Clinton was on a Windows box without a compiler. Fortunately, Steve
Hay was around and he was able to compile 2.18 on 5.6, and confirmed
the slowdown on both 5.8 and 5.10 (while 5.6 remained fast).</p>
<p>After some more research, Steve reported that the choice of <code>malloc</code>
(Perl's or the C library) made a very significant difference to the
time taken. In both cases, Perl's own <code>malloc</code> was a couple of orders of
magnitude faster. He noted that Activestate built their Perl
distribution on Windows with the system <code>malloc</code> since it was a
necessary precondition for their <code>fork</code> emulation.</p>

<p>Curiously enough, Clinton's 5.6 installation was already using the
system <code>malloc</code>. No-one was able to pin down the precise reason
for the slowdown, although it was likely that 5.8 and 5.10's full
UTF-8 implementation may be a culprit.</p>

<p>Robert May reported some strife with <code>GIMME_V</code> always returning
<code>G_VOID</code> regardless of context with an Activestate perl and XS
compiled with gcc. On the other hand, the same code compiled with
VC++ 6 behaved as expected.</p>

<p>Jan Dubois explained that this was due to a difference in how gcc and
VC++ laid out their bitfields. It turns out that VC++ is rather
profligate in its use of memory to store a number of bitfields, and
Jan promised to deliver a patch that would allow VC to be more
parsimonious in its memory consumption.</p>
<p>Armed with this information, Robert was able to twiddle a switch on
gcc to order it to lay out bitfields in an identical manner to VC++,
which solved his immediate problem.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, a blanket compiler switch override would then cause
a gcc for a Strawberry Perl to compile his XS module incorrectly,
and thus Rob needed to know how one could figure out what compiler
was used to build the perl within a <em>Makefile.PL</em>. Jan suggested
probing for values in the <code>Config</code> hash, as well as all you ever
wanted to know but were too afraid to ask about distinguishing an
Activestate build of perl from a perl built directly from source.</p>

<p>Jerry D. Hedden todoified <strong>yet another <code>threads::shared</code> bug</strong>
concerning a shared object that is attached to a shared scalar.</p>
<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/bfs43">http://xrl.us/bfs43</a> </pre>
<p>The bug in <code>ExtUtils::CBuilder</code> not honouring <code>extra_compiler_flags</code>,
that leads to the <code>GIMME_V</code> problem was filed by Robert May as a
ticket on the <code>ExtUtils::CBuilder</code> queue.</p>

<p>Daniel Frederick Crisman spotted a typo in a test name from last
week's additions from Abigail regarding the test of <code>for reverse ...</code>.</p>

<p>Daniel also identified a <strong>possible POD markup error</strong> in the Japanese
POD question last week.</p>

<p>Robert May thought that the <strong>POD in <em>encoding.pm</em> </strong> talked about
side effects far too much, so he dragged out the chain-saw and
<strong>removed two duplicate sections</strong>.</p>

<p>Reini Urban made some progress with his <strong>perl compiler</strong> project this
week.</p>
<pre>
  just in time
  <a href="http://xrl.us/bfs5b">http://xrl.us/bfs5b</a> </pre>
<p>Robin Barker noticed some <strong>sub-optimal POD formatting</strong> in <code>File::Find</code>
with C&lt;{ bydepth =E&lt;gt&gt; 1 }&gt; and proposed
an alternative.</p>

<p>Nicholas Clark took a lateral thinking approach to solving the
<strong>parallel make bug for <code>SDBM_File</code> </strong> by provoking the same error
but in the <code>POSIX</code> module.</p>
<pre>
  but not all the time

<p>Philippe Bruhat ran into a spot of bother trying to <strong>build 5.8.8 with a
particularly recent version of the gcc compiler</strong>. Andy Dougherty and Andreas
K&#246;nig gave him a couple of work-arounds, and Nicholas promised to make
sure 5.8.9 (coming Real Soon Now) should have the fix.</p>

<p>Watching the smoke signals, failure reports came in from Steve Hay
for Win32, as far as change #33169. No reports from other platforms.</p>

  <a href="http://xrl.us/bfs5j">http://xrl.us/bfs5j</a> </pre>

<p>Yitzchak Scott-Thoennes clarified the panic on copying a freed scalar: I
thought the magic of <code>@ARGV</code> was part of the problem, Yitzchak said that
any array at all will suffer the same erroneous behaviour.</p>

<h2>about Yitzchak clarification.</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/steph/">steph</a> on 2008-02-07T20:44:37</h3>
<p>Just curious. I don't see this bug with 5.8.[78] on cygwin,
even putting a loop around it (in case I were lucky).
From Dave Mitchell's explanations in the thread I would have thought it should show up in previous versions of perl.
</p>

nice summary!
thanks
