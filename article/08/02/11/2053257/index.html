<div class="span8">
<p>For <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/renodino/journal/34444">"Tired of Perl Is Dead FUD"</a>,
I generated a
<a href="http://www.presicient.com/langjobs.html">simple chart</a>
of Perl, PHP, Python, and Ruby job listings. It generated a lot more interest
than I expected.
<p>
One of the common comments went something like, "Yeah, but
there's no Perl jobs <i>in my backyard</i>".
</p> <p>
Which aggravated a chronic itch I've had since first
releasing <a href="http://www.presicient.com/dbdchart">DBD::Chart/
</a> <a href="http://www.presicient.com/dbixchart">DBIx::Chart</a>
several years ago: how to support some kind of GIS
visualizations. I've occasionally had users ask about
GIS support, but it seemed like such a huge challenge that
I've always begged off.
</p> <p>
All the online mapping services are about "geo-location";
I'm interested in "geo-intelligence".
</p> <p>
So when people asked "yeah, but where are those jobs ?", I decided
to scratch that itch.
</p> <p>
I found <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?GD::Map">GD::Map</a>,
but its interface and rendering weren't quite what I wanted.
So I've created
<a href="http://www.presicient.com/gdmapmerc">GD::Map::Mercator</a>.
(Alas, I still haven't figured out how to integrate it into
DBIx::Chart, but the experience helped me better understand the issues)
</p> <p>
With that, and a Javascript widget I've been working on for
another project, and a bit more detailed screenscraping, I've
whipped up a <a href="http://www.presicient.com/langjobs/usajobs.html">
Dynamic Language Jobs Map</a> that provides some relative indicators
of where those jobs are, along with a drill-down breakout of the Javascript,
Perl, PHP, Python, and Ruby job counts. <i>(Sorry, USA only; free/open,
current detail GIS data for other locations is hard to find)</i>
</p> <p>
Note that I've added Javascript to the list, because
its become increasingly important to <i>me</i> personally,
and I suspect it either already is, or soon will be, important to
other dynamic language users.
</p> <p>
The cosmetics are still a bit rough in spots (despite minor intervention
with Microsoft Paint), but hopefully its a bit more insightful. I'd hoped
to get a deeper drill down using area code GIS data, but I've been unable
to locate a free/open source for the data (if anyone knows of a source of
such data, I'd be grateful if you passed along the info).
</p> <p>
I'll try to update the data every couple of weeks; I've imposed on DICE's
hospitatilty a bit more than I should; hopefully they'll continue
to be gracious about my occasional scraping.</p></p>

<h2>Real nice but...</h2>

<p>This is some interesting information, however, I wouldn't jump to conclusions.</p>

<p>From what I have seen, It's hard to find Perl programmers, often times you see the same companies running ads for long periods of time, I think PHP positions are filled up with greater ease as the pool of candidates seems to be larger.</p>

<p>As an aside, at last month's LA.pm meetings we had 5 different companies pitching positions.</p>



<h2>Comparative Language Job Trend Graphs</h2>

That's great.<br><br>It's prompted me to finally post my comparative language job trend research as a shiny blog post with live graphs:<br><a href="http://blog.timbunce.org/2008/02/12/comparative-language-job-trend-graphs/" title="timbunce.org">http://blog.timbunce.org/2008/02/12/comparative-language-job-trend-graphs/</a timbunce.org><br>



<h2>About Perl GIS support</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ari/">ari</a> on 2008-02-12T13:02:18</h3>
There are a bunch of good modules in the Geo:: namespace, and also Geography::. Many are interfaces to libraries. I'm maintaining the Swig-based GDAL interfaces, which gives working access to many GIS datasets. I've also released a set of modules that build on Gtk2, said Geo::GDAL, and some other things, which make it possible to do GIS visualizations and build geospatial desktop apps among other things. <a href="https://list.hut.fi/mailman/listinfo/geo-perl" title="list.hut.fi">https://list.hut.fi/mailman/listinfo/geo-perl</a list.hut.fi> is a list for discussing Perl GIS support in general.



<h2>Perl Outnumbers PHP by a factor of 3</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/naveenbala/">naveenbala</a> on 2008-02-12T17:29:47</h3>
We did a similar comparison between Perl, PHP, Ruby and Python and found that there are 3 times more jobs requiring Perl compared to PHP as part of Whats More popular in the corporate world. <a href="http://www.odinjobs.com/blogs/careers/entry/perl_php_python_and_ruby" title="odinjobs.com">http://www.odinjobs.com/blogs/careers/entry/perl_php_python_and_ruby</a odinjobs.com> <br><br/><br/>We have also analyzed the US Perl job demand by states and metros and you can see the median salary and the raw job demand across states on a mashup with google maps. <a href="http://www.odinjobs.com/Perl_job_market_overview.html" title="odinjobs.com">http://www.odinjobs.com/Perl_job_market_overview.html</a odinjobs.com>
