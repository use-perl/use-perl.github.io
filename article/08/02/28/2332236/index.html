<p><h1>This Week on perl5-porters - 17-23 February 2008</h1>
<p>Nicholas: So, it seems that constant folding runs in ``compile time'',
which scares me somewhat. Surely it should be running in run time?</p>
<p>Rafael: The whole point of compile time optimisation is that it
runs at compile time, isn't it?</p>
<p>Nicholas: Runs <b>at</b> compile time, but (I assume should) run under
run time rules. There appear to be special exceptions scattered
throughout the code that certain things aren't fatal if compilation
is in progress.</p>
<p>(debating the elegant simplicity of the Perl 5 internals).</p></p>

<h2> <a name="pp_const_cools_off"> <code>pp_const</code> cools off</a> </h2>
<p>Nicholas Clark applied Vincent Pit's patch from last week to slim
down <code>pp_const</code> by splitting the op into two, which eliminates a
costly branch.</p>
<p>S&#233;bastien Aperghis-Tramoni reported that his web service that
showed the gcov output of the Perl codebase had gone belly up
(it was by poring over a gcov run that Nicholas spotted the
original opportunity to optimise).</p>
<p>Abe Timmerman said that a similar offering of his own was still
up, except that the perl.gcov target was currently broken, so
there was nothing to show.</p>

hacker might be able to put it to use.</p>

<h2> <a name="extending_t_test_pl_to_set_the_subprocess_env">extending <em>t/test.pl</em> to set the subprocess ENV</a> </h2>

<p>Jim Cromie found a simpler way to set up the environment of a test
requiring a fresh perl to be launched. This was to allow <code>PERL_XMLDUMP</code>
to be specified, in order to verify MAD output.</p>
<p>Nicholas wondered if Jim's hack was VMS-compatible. Craig A. Berry
suggested that all that was needed was the correct use of <code>local</code>.
Hilarity ensued as Yitzchak Scott-Thoennes shot down each of Jim's
attempts to effect the change in a loop, which had the result of
the localness (locality?) evaporating at the end of the block.</p>

<h2> <a name="you_can_t_always_optimise_what_you_want">You can't always optimise what you want</a> </h2>
<p>Nicholas Clark continued with his interesting self-contained
task from last week that dealt with constant optimisations and
thought it should be possible to unroll constant <code>pack</code>s.
(like <code>$var = pack(&quot;a2&quot;, &quot;xyz&quot;)</code> being replaced by <code>$var = &quot;xy&quot;</code>).
He had the source code that could more or less do it, but ran
all around the codebase trying to find a place to lodge it so
that it would be acted upon at the right time. He finally wound
up where he started from, and realised that it wasn't possible.</p>

<h2> <a name="assistance_with_ipc_modules_and_perl_5_10">Assistance with IPC modules and perl 5.10</a> </h2>
<p>Nicholas Clark and Andy Armstrong came through with the goods to
figure out what was going wrong with <code>IPC::Shareable</code> and
<code>IPC::ShareLite</code> on the upcoming Fedora release. So Fedorans will
soon be able use 5.10 straight out of the box.</p>

<h2> <a name="modulo_operator_and_floating_point_numbers">Modulo operator and floating point numbers</a> </h2>
<p>Ken Williams considered the recent change to the documentation
concerning the modulo operator and suggested some further tweaks
that Rafael applied.</p>
<p>He then started thinking about moduli of floating point numbers and
was surprised by the results of the current implementation. Zefram
pointed out that the same issue is described in his bug #41215.</p>
<p>Ken would have liked to make things behave in a more logical manner,
but Rafael was happy to let sleeping dogs lie.</p>

<h2> <a name="perl_on_symbian_os">Perl on Symbian OS</a> </h2>
<p>Gowtham wanted to know if the perl port that ran on Symbian 8 was
usable on Symbian 9. Jarkko Hietaniemi, author of the the original
port, was sceptical, given that the platform had been locked down.
This might mean that Perl (as an ``unauthorised application'') would
not have the privilege of opening a TCP connection.</p>
<p>If the build toolchain has changed significantly then major work
will be required to bring the port up to speed. In any event,
Jarkko said that he had no more time to take care of it.</p>
<pre>
  sounds like no

<h2> <a name="perl_runtime__or__adventures_in_sprintf_ops"> <code>PERL_RUNTIME</code>, or, adventures in <code>sprintf</code> ops</a> </h2>
<p>Having discovered the nifty f flag and its positive impact on <code>length</code>,
Nicholas reasoned that <code>sprintf</code> was a likely candidate for more of
the same. Except things went wrong, and had him diving all the way
back to Malcolm Beattie's change #44 from 1997. He managed to sort
things out and wrapped it up in change #33369.</p>

<h2> <a name="use_encoding__utf8__bug_for_latin1_range"> <code>use encoding 'utf8'</code> bug for Latin-1 range</a> </h2>
<p>Jarkko Hietaniemi kicked off a long thread last week, and was
still bubbling along nicely as I summarised it. So the executive
summary (subject to change, next week) is that <code>use encoding</code>
is broken and its use should be discouraged.</p>

<h2> <a name="utf8_problem_with_perl_5_10_0">UTF-8 problem with Perl 5.10.0</a> </h2>
<p>More UTF fun this week. Phil Harvey wrote to explain how he had
been burnt by the changes to <code>U0</code> and <code>C0</code> flags for <code>unpack</code>,
that used to allow one to sneak past the abstraction model and
poke at the implementation details. This caused a number of
mutually irreconcilable problems, and so the decision was made
during 5.9 to make a clean break with the past.</p>

<h2> <a name="ohloh">ohloh</a> </h2>
<p>Tels discovered ohloh, and its spectacularly out-of-date idea of
activity on the Perl codebase. It was slurping the contents of
Sam Vilain's git repository, and choking on the complex history
of the codebase. This meant that it looked as if development stopped
years ago. Andy Armstrong fixed up the summary info to indicate
that Perl 5 is still alive and kicking.</p>

<h2> <a name="installing_threads_files_on_nonthreaded_perls">Installing threads files on non-threaded Perls</a> </h2>
<p>Michael G. Schwern questioned the desire to exclude threads modules
from being installed on non-threaded builds. His contention being
that if someone uses the module on a non-threaded build, they
get a nice, informative error message as to why things don't work.</p>
<p>If they are removed, then only a basic ``module not found in any
of these zillion directories'' message is issued instead. Michael
was worried that some people might go to all the effort of trying
to download the threads package from CPAN, only to find out that
it <em>still</em> doesn't work, and in fact cannot unless perl itself is
rebuilt.</p>
<p>Jerry D. Hedden saw the logic in this line of reasoning, and
reversed his stance.</p>

<h2> <a name="perl_m_foo_we_1"> <code>perl -M:Foo -we 1</code> </a> </h2>
<p>Robin Barker related a london.pm discussion (and curiously,
the discussion was about Perl) relating to <code>perl -M:DProf -we 1</code> not
generating a warning. So he tweaked the getopty code in <em>perl.c</em>

to make it do so. Jim Cromie thought that the proposed warning, so
worded, was not particularly helpful.</p>

<p>Jerry D. Hedden discovered that his thread segfaults would occur regularly
on a machine with 4Gb of RAM, but not on another that had only 1Gb. He
wondered if it could be the symptom of some bad signed/unsigned voodoo.</p>
<p>Tels replied that he was unable to provoke any crashes on his own machine.</p>

<h2> <a name="qnx_test_failures___49818_">QNX Test failures (#49818)</a> </h2>
<p>Matt Kraai diagnosed a series of test failures he was having on QNX. Two
could be traced to tests building a <code>.pbc</code> file and then trying to
overwrite it after it had been loaded. His brutal fix for that problem
was to delete the file before overwriting it, but suspected there was
a better approach to the problem.</p>
<p>The second series of tests were due to bugs in QNX's <code>atof</code>. So the
fix here would be to tweak <em>Configure</em> to use Perl's own implementation.</p>

<h2> <a name="bug_in_regcomp_code_leading_to_panic___50114_">bug in regcomp code leading to panic (#50114)</a> </h2>
<p>Yves Orton stopped and suggested a couple of source code changes
to try and regretted that he didn't have more time to devote to
the issue. He nevertheless found the time to commit change #33324
that he hoped would resolve the problem.</p>
<p>Apparently, it did.</p>
<p>In other news, Michael Schroeder (reporter of the bug) asked why
<code>$r=qr{^bar}; &quot;foo\nbar&quot; =~ /$r/m or die</code> dies on blead, but not
on 5.8. He tracked down where in the regexp engine things had
changed (no mean feat) and wondered what the reasoning was.</p>

<p>Rick Delaney explained that he had made the change to fix a
related matching problem, and had not thought to add a regression
test that would have caught the change that Michael tripped over.</p>
<p>Yves felt that it could be fixed for 5.10.1.</p>

<h2> <a name="modified_hints_for_darwin_x86_64bit___50946_">modified hints for Darwin x86 64bit (#50946)</a> </h2>
<p>Daniel Quinlan supplied a patch to the Darwin hints file to allow
a 64-bit perl build. Rafael applied the patch but Nicholas warned
that there may be problems, since the 64-bitness of the build would
not be reflected in machine/architecture pathnames. This could lead
to all sort of mixed-bitness nightmares if different builds coexisted
on the machine. Unless of course Darwin just does the right thing.</p>
