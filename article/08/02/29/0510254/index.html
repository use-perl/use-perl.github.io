<div class="span8">
<p>The Perl 6 design team met by phone on 27 February 2008.  Larry, Allison, Patrick, Will, Jerry, Jesse, Nicholas, and chromatic attended.</p>
<p><p> <strong>Larry:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>very busy with my day job right now</li>
<li>clarified that multis and protos are automatically exported by default</li>
<li>assumed that there's <code>is export</code> on them</li>
<li>you have to declare them with <code>my</code> to get non-exported versions</li>
<li>made some changes and defined something called interface versions</li>
<li>subset of the version number</li>
<li>the patchlevel doesn't matter when you require something with language tweaks</li>
<li>only the interface version</li>
<li>doing a lot of cleanup of <em>STD.pm</em> </li>
<li>dekludging various things</li>
<li>made a separate regular expression grammar</li>
<li>derived from the Perl grammar</li>
<li>allows us to override things like whitespace rules</li>
<li>we use derivation for its original intent</li>
<li>did a lot of work on the <code>gimme</code> program that translate that</li>
<li>cleanups came from noticing badness when I tried to run the Perl 5</li>
<li>plenty of feedback from Patrick, Jonathan, and the rest of the gang</li>
<li>added some rules to <em>STD.pm</em> to add hooks for having an interactive parser that knows when you're done with user input</li>
<li>the <code>vws</code> rule for vertical whitespace</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Patrick:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>the Parrot release went very smoothly</li>
<li>compliments to everyone who put together release notes and updated things for me</li>
<li>spent the weekend in Brussels at FOSDEM 2008</li>
<li>my Perl 6 talk seems to have been well received</li>
<li>lots of compliments and comments and renewed enthusiasm</li>
<li>spent some time on the plane looking into getting Rakudo to use Parrot's HLL directives</li>
<li>it'll take some refactoring to get some of the classes working there</li>
<li>just methods and the way things get stored in namespaces</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Jerry:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>let's create a branch for that</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Patrick:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>that's a good idea</li>
<li>probably just a branch to play in, then switch over in the trunk</li>
<li>probably doable incrementally</li>
<li>did some work on trying to improve the state of Unicode in Parrot</li>
<li>want to use more Unicode in Rakudo</li>
<li>get string tests passing, use French quotes</li>
<li>I'm a little concerned that applying the patch will slow things down until we can do things in something other than UTF-8</li>
<li>otherwise applying patches and keeping up with the excellent work done by Jonathan, Jerry, and others</li>
<li>all of the <em>STD.pm</em> changes have been really nice lately</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Allison:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>working on the security PDD</li>
<li>have a long list of features that we I include</li>
<li>working on deciding a necessary and sufficient set of security features for the 1.0 release</li>
<li>need the most useful features for our target contexts and target languages</li>
<li>otherwise we could spend three years implementing security features</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Jerry:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>enjoying some peanut chocolate-coated candies</li>
<li>updated p6doc before the release</li>
<li>I don't think anyone's really using it yet though</li>
<li>removed some deprecated compiler directives from Rakudo's grammar</li>
<li>now that we have <code>fudge</code> working</li>
<li>working on a patch to allow you to write Rakudo runtime libraries in Perl 6</li>
<li>Zev Benjamin sent the patch to the list</li>
<li>it had some bugs, but most of those are fixed</li>
<li>there seems to be one cross-compiler problem remaining</li>
<li>made some progress on a YAML dumper to use for dumping AST match objects</li>
<li>committed a config patch to detect <code>gettext</code> so we can work toward internationalizing Parrot</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Jesse:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>talked to Mitchell Charity about the state of Pugs</li>
<li>he's looking into a way to extract a standardized AST for all of the various Pugsian implementations for anyone to play with different backends</li>
<li>a little glue around the kp6 AST to target from either end</li>
<li>hopefully let the various folks in the Pugs community actually interoperate</li>
<li>instead of having a half-dozen half-implemented full stacks hanging around</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>c:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>working on GC problems</li>
<li>have a workaround I think fixes things</li>
<li>sort of expensive, but we need to rethink part of our strategy</li>
<li>workaround will probably stick around until we revise the GC in a couple of months</li>
<li>did some profiling; think I'll tackle PIR profiling next</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Nicholas:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>found a bug in Perl 1 configure and patched it</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Jerry:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>do you have someone to bounce your security ideas off of?</li>
<li>it would help me to have this more visible</li>
<li>I don't want it to slow you down</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Allison:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>this is just the initial draft</li>
<li>the whole list will get to see and review the draft</li>
<li>or do you want to see the mental process of what I consider and discard?</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Jerry:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>I just wonder if you would have an easier time deciding what we need for 1.0 if you could discuss pros and cons with someone</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Allison:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>I've been trying to write the PDD as a single coherent set of things</li>
<li>haven't written pros and cons within the PDD</li>
<li>otherwise it'll end up about 20 pages long</li>
<li>so many different approaches for the same thing</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Jerry:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>years ago, <em>docs/dev/</em> was the place for those</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Allison:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>I'll probably push the current document out today or tomorrow</li>
<li>we'll start a series of discussions about various different topics</li>
<li>a lot of it depends on what language implementors and application designers want</li>
<li>the biggest thing I want is people asking for missing features and telling me they don't want other features</li>
<li>what I'm doing is the core seed of that process</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Jerry:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>hopefully interested people will read these minutes or a weblog post</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Allison:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>I'll do my usual post to the mailing list</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>c:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>maybe you could post it to your journal</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Allison:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>which journal?</li>
<li>I've been thinking of setting up a dedicated <a href="http://www.parrotblog.org/">Parrot blog</a> </li>
</ul></p>
