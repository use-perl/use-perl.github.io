<p><p>A while back, around November 2007, there was <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/Alias/journal/34801">some discussion</a> about performance problems with rt.cpan.org to the point that some found it to be almost unusable. I bring this up here because there were some suggestions that perhaps TPF could buy some new hardware. If you scroll to the bottom, you'll see Jesse Vincent jumped in and said he thought the performance wasn't a hardware problem and he could make some changes, but he needed help locating the trouble spots. </p>

<p>I'm happy to report that Jesse has implemented some changes and performance seems to be much better now. I just wanted to say thanks to Jesse for following through on the fixes. I also want to thank Adam and others for pointing out the problems so we could address them. A public service isn't really a service if people can't use it.</p> <br> <a href="http://news.perlfoundation.org/2008/02/rtcpanorg_speed_improvements_i.html">http://news.perlfoundation.org/2008/02/rtcpanorg_speed_improvements_i.html</a></p>
