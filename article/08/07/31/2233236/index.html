<p><em>(The excellent news from fglock++ that <a href="__SLASHLINK__" sect="mainpage" sid="08/07/30/1521240" sn="article" tid="30">v6.pm is back</a> prompted me to write something about Pugs, too, so here it is.)</em>
<p>
During the past month, I've been quietly releasing Pugs and its dependencies on
<a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/cgi-bin/hackage-scripts/package/Pugs">Hackage</a>.
</p><p>
Installation for Pugs is now much simpler than before; see <a href="http://svn.pugscode.org/pugs/INSTALL">http://svn.pugscode.org/pugs/INSTALL</a> for details.
</p><p>
There has been no action in terms of features, but the internal has been refactored to reduce compilation time, and the individual components has been released as <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/pkg-list.html#cat:Pugs">separate packages</a> to reduce maintenance overhead.
</p><p>
Startup time is also greatly improved.  As a consequence, running the <a href="http://m19s28.dyndns.org/cgi-bin/pugs-smokeserv.pl">full smoke test suite</a> is no longer a multi-hour-long ordeal; it now takes less than 15 minutes on modern machines.
</p><p>
As of the 6.2.13.11 release, the smoke numbers say it passes 17215 tests out of 19260, which is not significantly different from the 6.2.13 release.
</p><p>
Going forward, I think GHC 6.10's <a href="http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/user/mainland/ghc-quasiquoting/">Quasiquoting</a> and <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/ghc/wiki/ViewPatterns">View patterns</a> are going to be vital for the sanity of Pugs internals, so please expect no Pugs 6.28.* releases before GHC 6.10.1.
</p><p>
And finally, a shameless plug: I'm still looking for ways to make ends meet, so any <a href="mailto:audreyt@audreyt.org">offers</a> of telecommuting, project-based/part-time jobs would be very much appreciated. :-)</p></p>

really weird, just yesterday i was wondering where you been hiding!<br/><br/>anyway welcome back to Perl!

<tt>This is great news, and very welcome indeed.<br><br>But I also have to add that part of the reduced runtime is due to many changes in the tests that leads to parse failures and thus early exists.<br><br>The biggest chunk is the changed POD. We're slowly converting the old style POD from<br><br>&nbsp; =pod<br><br>&nbsp;<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...<br><br>&nbsp; =cut<br><br>to new style POD<br><br>&nbsp; =begin description<br><br>&nbsp;<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...<br><br>&nbsp; =end description<br><br>Since pugs can't parse that, the number of failing tests rose significantly.</tt>

Hmm?  I don't see why that would be the case; Pugs parsed the begin/end POD comments just fine for quite a while now.
<p>
For example, t/spec/S02-builtin_data_types/subtypes.t has such a block, and pugs passes it just fine (with two unexpected successes).
</p><p>
Is it possible for you to give a single test file for me to try against?</p>

<tt>Sorry for the noise, I tried with an outdated version of pugs. Very Outdated.<br><br>But there's something different that came to my mind - are you actually using fudge before running the tests? some of the<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:todo&lt;feature&gt; markers were removed because they are are implementation specific, and substituted by fudge markers.<br><br>In the parrot repository languages/perl6/t/harness integrates fudge, and languages/perl6/tools/autounfudge.pl is a script for autotmatically removing fudge markers from passing tests (which broke due to some changes in rakudo a few days ago) which should also be easy to adopt for pugs.<br>We could generalize it a bit more and move it to t/spec/ in the pugs repo, if you're interested.</tt>

Sure, that'd be excellent. I did notice the unTODOing, but that did not trouble me as much because as long as the passing tests are still passing, things are going fine.
<p>
In retrospect, I regret the insistence of marking<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:todo&lt;feature&gt; and making sure that all platforms fails with an equal number with tests before each Pugs release.  Much of release engineering effort were spent tracking down platform-specific bugs, while it would make more sense simply to let them fail.
</p><p>
But sure, a fudge script living in t/spec/ sounds like a good thing to have, so I can have the pugs tree refreshed to the Hackage version and run against the newly-fudged spectests.</p>

<tt>The trouble with unTUDOed tests is just that they terminate pugs sometimes, and thus hide other tests.<br><br>The fudge and fudgeall scripts already live in t/spec/, so you just have to integrate them into the pugs test harness.<br>It's the unfudge scripts (that basically writes patches that remove '#?rakudo' or '#?pugs' fudge lines for you) that I considered for moving.<br><br>I think that we also need to specify the functionality of Test.pm a bit more since rakudo uses its own (simpler) Test.pm, with slightly different is() semantics (it uses string comparison for now). I'll raise that question on p6c after my vacations.</tt>

<p>Hi Audrey,</p><p>I described the pugs installation on cygwin at<br><a href="http://use.perl.org/user/rurban/journal/36897" title="perl.org">http://use.perl.org/user/rurban/journal/36897</a perl.org></p>



<h2>Re: on cygwin</h2>

Yes, the URL to your journal has been added to the <a href="http://svn.pugscode.org/pugs/INSTALL" title="pugscode.org">INSTALL</a pugscode.org> file.  Many thanks!
<p>
A commit bit is on its way to your mailbox; if you can check out the latest Pugs from subversion and see if "perl Makefile.PL ; make" just works on Cygwin, that'd be excellent.</p>

Audrey,
<p>
There are many, many people who wish you well in all  things (not only for what you may do with Perl).
</p><p>
Have you considered posting a link to say an Amazon wish list so that those who cannot afford to employ you, can register their appreciation ?
</p><p>
Why not revisit TPF with a proposal to do more on what you obviously love, namely the Haskell implementation of P6 ? I can't think of a better way for the TPF to invest some of the Ian Hague cash than doing this, and, were I to learn that they'd sponsored you, it would certainly influence my donation intentions to TPF.
</p><p>
God bless you.</p>

I agree 100% with this.  Give people a way to help you, and they will.
