that pop up to tell you something perfectly normal has happened and
you should do nothing. &quot;A USB device was safely removed!&quot; Yes, thank
you, I just removed it. It's this sort of hand-wringing user interface
design (&quot;but the user might not have expected that USB device to
be removed, they should be told so they can maybe, possibly do
something!&quot;) that I'd like Perl to avoid.</em> -- Michael G. Schwern,
wanting numeric upgrades to JFDI.</p><p>(Please take note of the date. I'm posting the backlog of summaries after having encountered problems trying to post them last month).</p></p>
<p>
<h1> <a name="topics_of_interest">Topics of Interest</a> </h1><h2> <a name="y2038_branch">Y2038 branch</a> </h2></p><p>Michael G. Schwern's work (in a git branch) on Y2038+ dates continued
apace, with H.Merijn Brand adding some configuration hooks for
minimum and maximum date values, and discussions of how to set up
tests to check for sane values in the year 803619167319 or so,
especially if daylight savings is still in place.</p><p>

</p><h2> <a name="blead_on_opensuse_11_0_64">Blead on OpenSUSE 11.0/64</a> </h2></p><p>H.Merijn Brand reported that the only failure on this platform for
5.8.9-to-be was one test in <code>CGI</code>. On the other hand, <code>ODBM_File</code>
was collapsing in a heap on blead, but H.Merijn was puzzled as to
why, since he was using the same configuration settings, and there
has been no changes under <em>ext/ODBM_File</em> between 5.8.x and blead.</p><p>Andy Dougherty thought that 5.8.x's <code>Configure</code> was missing
ODBM_File altogether, but blead's was a little more aggressive and
found a header that led it to conclude it could try and build
the extension, and this revealed that SUSE's dbm compatibility is
not up to par.</p><p>

</p><h2> <a name="autodie_behaviour_with_flock__"> <code>autodie</code> behaviour with <code>flock()</code> </a> </h2></p><p>Paul Fenwick asked what <code>autodie</code> should do in the light of blocking
and non-blocking file lock acquisitions, reasoning that calling
<code>flock()</code> in blocking mode means &quot;I need this lock&quot;, whereas calling
it in non-blocking mode is a question: &quot;Can I get this lock right
now?&quot;. From this, he could come up with sensible behaviour for

<code>autodie</code>.</p><p>The main sticking point was the possibility that a <code>flock</code> call
returns the <code>EWOULDBLOCK</code> error, which is not really an error, or
at least, not something worth dying for.</p><p>There was a long discussion about exceptions, errors and opportunistic
code, but the main point to take home is when Zefram pointed out
that if autodie's behaviour for flock is unsuitable, one is always
free to use a <code>no autodie 'flock'</code> to switch it off and handle it
manually.</p><p>
<pre>

  <a href="http://xrl.us/oscvz">http://xrl.us/oscvz</a> </pre>
</p><p>One may assume that Paul had been pulling his hair out over the
issue and that the documentation wasn't much help. So he improved
documentation for <code>flock()</code> in <em>perlfunc.pod</em> and tidied up the
code examples for by using lexical filehandles rather than globs,
checking for errors, and using constants rather than magic numbers.</p><p>

</p><h2> <a name="is_the_prototype_for_core__truncate_wrong">Is the prototype for <code>CORE::truncate</code> wrong?</a> </h2></p><p>Paul then looked at <code>truncate</code> in trying to figure out how to
override it for <code>autodie</code>.  His version could not take a typeglob
as a parameter, as the parser thought it was a bareword, due to
<code>truncate</code>'s prototype.</p><p>He missed the fact that <code>truncate</code> can also work with the name of
a file, not just a file handle, which is why the prototype had to
fudge matters slightly.</p><p>This reminded Jan Dubois of a subtlety he encountered with <code>unlink</code>
a while ago: <code>unlink()</code> will remove the file named by <code>$_</code>, but
<code>unlink(())</code> does nothing. The reason for this oddity is to prevent
<code>unlink(@stuff)</code> from unlinking whatever <code>$_</code> points to, should

<code>@stuff</code> happen to be empty.</p><p>Jan gave up trying to implement the same semantics in pure Perl,
instead concluding that there are some core functions that are
impossible to duplicate. And perl 5.10's <code>_</code> prototype doesn't
help either, given that it imposes scalar context.</p><p>Rafa&#235;l wondered what would happen (what would break) if he tweaked
<em>opcode.pl</em> to change the prototype to something more suitable for
Paul's need. Paul wondered too.</p><p>

</p><h2> <a name="practical_considerations_in_changing_the_integer_upgrade_path">Practical considerations in changing the integer upgrade path?</a> </h2></p><p>Michael G. Schwern asked for people's considered opinions on how painful
it would really be to change the integer upgrade path from signed -&gt;
unsigned -&gt; double -&gt; <code>Inf</code> to signed -&gt; long long (or
whatever) -&gt; arbitrary precision.</p><p>Specifically, he wondered how one creates a new SV type, what impact
would this have on the code base, and whether it would break XS code.</p><p>Yuval Kogman answered all three questions quite clearly. And there
ended the thread.</p><p>

Chrysostomos and an error in the test suite for <code>XML::LibXML::Simple</code>,
Nicholas Clark backed the regressing change out and added some tests
to identify the problem so that that future attempts don't cause
the same breakage. Dave Mitchell said he had a cold, and was thus
unlikely to look at things for a while.</p><p>

</p><h2> <a name="___is_no_longer_supported"> <code>$*</code> is no longer supported</a> </h2></p><p>Rory Kingan was worried about some code that crawled out of the
woodwork complaining about <code>$*</code> no longer implemented in 5.10.
Aristotle Pagaltzis looked at the regular expressions Rory
posted and concluded that it was just cargo cult code that could
be safely deleted.</p><p>

him get <code>metaconfig</code> hosted entirely in git (at
<a href="http://perl5.git.perl.org/?p=metaconfig.git">http://perl5.git.perl.org/</a>), and declared its
Perforce branches officially closed.</p><p>

</p><h2> <a name="syntax_incompatibility__5_8_8_vs_5_10_">Syntax incompatibility (5.8.8 vs 5.10)</a> </h2></p><p>Edward Peschko wrote about a problem with <code>Readonly::XS</code> that was
complaining about a use of <code>Carp::croak</code>. This can be traced to a
decision taken over three years ago to remove the loading of <code>Carp</code>
from <code>warnings</code>.</p><p>Since the author of the module sees no reason to release a new
version of the module just to fix this problem, it is unlikely
that it will be fixed in the near future. Certainly there is no
desire to put <code>Carp</code> back into <code>warnings</code>, and

<code>Perl::Critic::StricterSubs</code> can be used by authors to find such
problems (where client code loads module X, which in turn loads
module Y, and then the client code calls routines in Y without
having loaded it explicitly).</p><p>

problematic files would be a start).</p><hr>

temporary file names. Jan Dubois pointed out that this was likely to be
a win for Windows systems that have on-access virus scanning, which can
interfere with files that are rapidly deleted and recreated.</p><p>

<h1> <a name="new_and_old_bugs_from_rt">New and old bugs from RT</a> </h1></p><h2> <a name="volunteer_for_fixing_the_unicode_bug___58182_">Volunteer for fixing the &quot;Unicode&quot; bug (#58182)</a> </h2></p><p>Back in August, when I was on my summ(?:ary|er) break, Karl Williamson
filed a bug report relating to the inconsistent handling of 8-bit characters
in strings during case mapping when no locale has been specified.</p><p>For instance, <code>uc(&quot;\x{e0}&quot;)</code> returns itself (&#224;, or lowercase a grave)
rather than &#192; (uppercase A grave). And this, regardless of whether there
are any multi-byte characters.</p><p>As a consequence, <code>&quot;\x{e0}&quot; =~ /\x{c0}/i</code> fails to match. Moritz Lenz
explained that this was a known bug but unfortunately was not fixable
because too much code relies on the current behaviour (which Karl
summarises quite nicely in the original bug report). Moritz showed how
one could make things work, at the expense of a little make-work code
involving <code>utf8::upgrade</code>.</p><p>Juerd Waalboer mentioned that it is fixable and scheduled for
implementation in perl 5.12, and that such backwards compatibility
issues have been noted in <code>perl510delta</code>.</p><p>Dave Mitchell sketched out how one might go about producing an
implementation for this, which would involve breaking out the
semantically overloaded <code>SVf_UTF8</code> flag from <code>SvFLAGS</code> and
hanging it out in an auxilliary structure, which could be used to
store additional bits of information such as character set,
encoding, locales, UTF-8 caches and more, since there's no
space for such extravagances in a standard SV.</p><p>Juerd and Glenn Linderman weren't sure it this would end up being
a win. Glenn in particular thought that locale and encoding metadata
should probably be associated with file handles and the like.</p><p>

  <a href="http://xrl.us/oscwq">http://xrl.us/oscwq</a> </pre>
</p><p>Fast-forward to this week, when Karl reported back to the list,
explaining that he'd implemented the change in behaviour in a
copy of 5.10 source that seemed to do the trick, and asked the
list where to go from here. In a nutshell, his patch extends
ASCII semantics to the characters in the 128..255 Latin1
characters.</p><p>Glenn Linderman explained that Karl should use a pragma to
introduce this new change for code that wants to use it.</p><p>Rafa&#235;l amended this suggestion by saying that the Unicode
situation as it stands at the moment is such a mess that
no pragma would be required for 5.12: it would just Do The
Right Thing and backwards compatibility be damned. If the
change was back-ported to the 5.10 track, then a pragma
would be required in order to switch to the new behaviour.</p><p>Andreas K&#246;nig pointed out that Karl should base his patches
on blead, rather than 5.10. Rafa&#235;l said that starting a
branch from <code>git://perl5.git.perl.org/perl.git</code> would be
as good a place as any from which to start.</p><p>Juerd thought that Karl should have no qualms about breaking
code with his changes, since a certain amount of reverse
breakage would may occur, whereby existing buggy code
suddenly begins to work correctly...</p><p>
