not a linear progression, using a commit ID as a way to find out
where your code came from doesn't work. This is not git's fault
but is an issue with every distributed version control system (SVK
tries to pretend otherwise). You could perhaps use a combination
of the git repository you pulled from and the last commit ID, but
[...] fundamentally the idea is gone. It's a small price to pay.&quot;</i>
-- Michael G. Schwern, coming to terms with the future.</p></p>
<p>
<h1> <a name="topics_of_interest">Topics of Interest</a> </h1><h2> <a name="_version_in_opcode"> <code>$VERSION</code> in <code>Opcode</code> </a> </h2></p><p>The tangent regarding the issue of module version numbers and the
techniques to deal with them continued apace over the last fortnight.
The core of Matt S. Trout's argument over <code>version.pm</code> is that it
injects a method into <code>UNIVERSAL</code>, and this, in an of itself,
produces action at a distance, even when <code>version.pm</code> is not at
fault. The problem shows up when <code>version.pm</code> is used incorrectly
by third-party code, and the resulting errors are very hard to track
down.</p><p>All that being as it may, Matt appreciates the value of the version
comparison code available, and would like to be able to get at it,
while leaving <code>UNIVERSAL</code> untouched. Otherwise, it's akin to
modifying <code>$[</code> or <code>$/</code> at the global level. Tom Christiansen
concluded that only the highest level code should be putting
things into <code>UNIVERSAL</code>, not by proxy via the use of other
modules.</p><p>

</p><p>Later on, in a particularly magnanimous gesture, John Peacock
announced that he had a patch that would do all that Matt
wanted and more, and asked if Matt was satisfied by it.</p><p>

</p><h2> <a name="y2038_branch">Y2038 branch</a> </h2></p><p>Steve Hay took Michael G. Schwern's Y2038+ code for a spin in
the land of Windows, and made a few adjustments to have it play
nicely with the compilers there.</p><p>Based on Steve's recommendations, Michael produced a series of
changes that ended up delivering sane results. In the end, Michael
had to lift some code from the FreeBSD project to address the
problem of converting strings to long longs. This helped the
Microsoft compilers that still had not caught up with the C
standard as of the previous millennium.</p><p>

</p><p>Later on Michael released a newer patch that included all his
latest research on the matter. Steve continued to find a number
of rough edges on Windows. H.Merijn Brand thought that it might
be worthwhile probing for 64-bit variants of time routines on
the platforms that offer them, since that the whole point of the
exercise in the first place. And so he did, and said he'd get
around to probing for the reentrant versions as well.</p><p>

  <a href="http://xrl.us/oudxd">http://xrl.us/oudxd</a> </pre>
</p><p>Michael then had a patch working on Windows and Cygwin, contingent
on a couple of details that needed to be resolved. Some problems
turned out to involve the building of <code>miniperl</code> itself, which
uses some canned constants before Michael's work is able to work
its magic.</p><p>Dave Rolsky dropped by to say that he was delighted that all of
this work had a positive effect on the innards of <code>Time::Local</code>.
On the other hand, it greatly complicated the task of keeping it
dual-lifed on CPAN, so much so that he doubted that the new
changes would work with older perl releases. Michael showed him
how this could be done with some XS goodness.</p><p>

(that is, pre OS/X). Said platform doesn't know how to <code>fork</code>, but
it can <code>vfork</code>. In the current state of affairs, asking a program
to fork itself with something silly, like <code>/dev/null</code>, leads to
some very interesting (read: not useful) results, in that one
receives very little information as to what went wrong.</p><p>Joshua managed to get as far as showing how a minor change to
<code>Perl_do_exec()</code>, <code>Perl_my_popen()</code>, and <code>pp_system()</code>
would fix the problem, but he wasn't sure if his internals-fu
was strong enough to consider all the ramifications.</p><p>Nicholas Clark reasoned that the problem Joshua faced was sufficiently
weird (or rather, his platform of choice was weird) that he should
write the tests to establish the desired behaviour out on the end
of the continuum, and then the rest of us could just follow suit.</p><p>Apparently he has done this on a code repository hosted on
Sourceforge, but unless I am mistaken they didn't make it to the
list.</p><p>

</p><h2> <a name="discussing_the__im_possibility_of_prototype_based_polymorphism_for_5_12">Discussing the (im?)possibility of prototype-based polymorphism for 5.12</a> </h2></p><p>David Nicol responded to a previous thread (which I lack the tuits
to track down) with the concept of polymorphism based on prototypes,
which would, amongst other things, make the following work:</p><p>
<pre>
  sub foo($$);
  sub bar(@);</pre>
<pre>
  bar foo 1, 2, 3, 4;
  # parsed as</pre>

<pre>
  bar( foo(1, 2), 3, 4);</pre>
</p><p>He promised to investigate the possibility with his <code>Macrame</code>
module. In the meantime, Rafa&#235;l Garcia-Suarez reminded David
that prototypes in Perl are more for changing the syntax rather
that type inferencing.</p><p>

5.10, which appears to be something to do changes to the
implementation of stashes. No-one commented.</p><p>

</p><h2> <a name="protochk_and_c__"> <code>protochk</code> and C++</a> </h2></p><p>Tony Cook had been puzzled for a while over intermittent smoke
failures when using C++ on Debian, and managed to discover that
C++'s function overloading mechanism was the cause. He suggested
a change to a Configure test, but H.Merijn admitted that it was
far outside his scope of expertise and asked for other eyes to
look at it and consider the ramifications.</p><p>

</p><h2> <a name="todo_list_for_moving_to_git">TODO list for moving to git</a> </h2></p><p>Nicholas, having endured a painful bisection ordeal under Perforce
to track down when something changed, wondered what was holding up
the migration to git. His current problem was one of mapping a
Perforce revision (a number in a monotonic sequence) to a git
checksum.</p><p>Mark Mielke wanted to know if there was a page on the web somewhere
that recorded the current status of the Perforce-git migration.</p><p>Michael G. Schwern offered an interesting parenthetical remark
regarding the move from Perforce to git, and why it is the Right
Thing. David Golden also noted that git solves the problem of
branching at any point in time, hacking, and folding the changes
back in a most elegant manner. The price you pay, though, is that
it is very hard to point to a specific moment in development
(since one only has an unsortable checksum, not a monotonic
sequence).</p><p>Craig A. Berry, not fully versed in git-speak, was nonetheless
able to describe how people would communicate points of
interest in the development tree. At the same time, he thought
that the barrier to entry to understanding git was much higher
than that of Perforce. As it turns out, basic web projections of
git repositories already come close to what the All Perl Changes
browser provides.</p><p>
<pre>
  gitting there
  <a href="http://xrl.us/oudxs">http://xrl.us/oudxs</a> </pre>

</p><p>Michael went through the git threads on the list and neatly
summarised them on the Perl5 wiki. He noted with satisfaction
that there were no showstoppers, just a question of tuits.</p><p>

</p><h2> <a name="perl_newsvpvf__lld__is_broken"> <code>Perl_newSVpvf(&quot;%lld&quot;)</code> is broken</a> </h2></p><p>One other item that fell out of the Y2038+ code was that, on
32-bit platforms, <code>printf(&quot;%lld\n&quot;, 2**32)</code> gives a result
of -1. Michael and admitted to being terrified by the code and
hoped someone else could dig down through it and figure out
where the problem lay.</p><p>

</p><h2> <a name="pathtools_qnx_regression">Pathtools QNX regression</a> </h2></p><p>Nicholas Clark looked more closely at Matt Kraai's failures for
5.8.9-tobe on QNX. He determined that it was due to a refactoring
of <code>File::Spec::Unix::abs2rel</code> between Pathtools 3.12 and 3.13.</p><p>Interestingly, this dredged up an interesting piece of Perl
trivia, in that for a short time, the <code>/t</code> flag on a regexp
match maintained the taint flag if the target string was
tainted. The idea lived a short life.</p><p>Nicholas thought that creating a new <code>File::Spec::QNX</code> (and the
like), since it would be easier to test and would probably
simplify the implementation of <code>catdir</code>. In any event, he
wrote a patch and Matt confirmed that it fixed up the problem
on QNX 6 (a.k.a QNX Neutrino, or <code>$^O eq 'nto'</code>).</p><p>Ken Williams folded Nicholas's patch into his Pathtools
repository.</p><p>

</p><h2> <a name="git_conversion_discrepancy">git conversion discrepancy</a> </h2></p><p>Nicholas Clark uncovered a flaw in Same Vilain's Perforce-git
import. Sam said he'd go over the import code to see if he'd
missed anything. By and large most of the Perforce branches
were bit-for-bit perfect.</p><p>

</p><h2> <a name="perl_34467">perl@34467</a> </h2></p><p>Nicholas produced another snapshot of 5.8.9-tobe. Of note were
some problems on VMS (for which fixes existed) and some minor
problems with <code>Module::Build</code>.</p><p>Slaven Rezic tested some 3700 CPAN distributions and listed
a dozen or so regressions. Most of them turned out to be minor,
but one was an honest to goodness C error, relying on a
reallocated SV landing in exactly right place.</p><p>

insist on foisting a perl compiled with <code>-DDEBUGGING</code> upon
their users, and pondered tweaking things to make it produce
a nasty warning on STDERR during startup.</p><p>

</p><h2> <a name="t_op_regexp_t"> <em>t/op/regexp.t</em> </a> </h2></p><p>Abigail wondered how to deal with a test that causes a segfault
during program exit, since even a <code>fresh_perl_is</code> from <em>test.pl</em>
will return a correct result, not seeing that <code>$?</code> contains a
non-zero value. Michael G. Schwern thought that the expedient
measure of testing <code>$?</code> against zero should be sufficient.</p><p>

<h1> <a name="todo_of_the_week">TODO of the week</a> </h1></p><p>A task that need a little sysadmin-type knowledge</p><h2> <a name="linker_specification_files">Linker specification files</a> </h2></p><p>Some platforms mandate that you provide a list of a shared library's
external symbols to the linker, so the core already has the
infrastructure in place to do this for generating shared perl
libraries. My understanding is that the GNU toolchain can accept
an optional linker specification file, and restrict visibility just
to symbols declared in that file. It would be good to extend

<em>makedef.pl</em> to support this format, and to provide a means within
<code>Configure</code> to enable it. This would allow Unix users to test that
the export list is correct, and to build a perl that does not pollute
the global namespace with private symbols.</p><hr>
<h1> <a name="patches_of_interest">Patches of Interest</a> </h1></p><h2> <a name="cross_compile_for_linux">Cross-compile for linux</a> </h2></p><p>Vadim Konovalov continued to deliver his patches for cross-compilation.
Alas, few people with commit bits have had the time to review them and
enter them into Perforce. There is hope that git may alleviate these
sorts of problems.</p><p>

</p><h2> <a name="5_8_x_on_interix">5.8.x on Interix</a> </h2></p><p>Ben Morrow reported on the test failures on Interix for 5.8.9-tobe.
Jan Dubois took issue with the skipping of tests, since that might
lead the underlying bugs to be swept under the carpet. Ben thought
that there was a distinction to be made as to whether the test suite
was testing Perl or Perl and its interaction with its host environment
(such as bugs in the C library).</p><p>Rafa&#235;l hoped that the changes, if they were good enough for 5.8,
could also make it into blead. Ben saw no reason why not, he just
wanted to help get 5.8.9 out the door at the moment.</p><p>

program appends the specified directory to <code>@INC</code>, rather than prepending.</p><p>Rafa&#235;l Garcia-Suarez explained how and why it was a feature, and Ren&#233;e
proposed a patch to make <code>-I</code> always prepend.</p><p>

Vincent Pit has been chipping away at the problem, trying to solve it. This
is his latest offering. He's still not happy with the fix, and suggests that
it's either this, or ignore the bug.</p><p>

long in tooth SunOS platform. Andy Dougherty thought that the last time he
had attempted such a task was in 2001, and thought that some of the errors
Bob was encountering were due compiler bugs, and that building without
<code>-O2</code> optimisation may alleviate some of the problems.</p><p>Nicholas Clark identified some failures as being Mostly Harmless, but others
were rather more disconcerting.</p><p>

that this induces, and a proposal on how to move to something that works

memory. The trigger was a regexp with a quotemeta'ed portion and some
single character character classes.</p><p>Nicholas Clark noted that while lots of memory gets chewed up, if the
program is able to run to completion, every last byte is correctly
freed. Dave Mitchell produced a smaller test case to demonstrate the
leak... which still cleaned up after itself if things ended in an

In his words: &quot;it appears that the Unicode folks decided they were
doing the wrong thing in 3.1, and changed it in 3.2.  Perl is still
looking for the 3.1 syntax.&quot; That is, they snuck it in without
telling anybody. Karl hopes to be able to produce a patch.</p><p>

</p><p>Nicholas Clark wasn't sure if <strong>CPAN bug #39403</strong> involved something that
needed to be fixed in the core (the ability to overload or intercept
an attribute, other than using a source filter).</p><p>
<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/oud2v">http://xrl.us/oud2v</a> </pre>
</p><p>Nicholas also proposed a wild-assed guess to allow <strong>parallel testing
on Win32</strong> but Steve Hay reported no joy. Andy Armstrong understood
the resulting symptoms sufficiently to volunteer to see if he could
figure out why.</p><p>

</p><p>John O'Rourke ran into some <strong>odd behaviour of <code>substr(lc($utf8))</code>
in 5.8.8</strong> that Nicholas had fixed, he thought, thanks to a TPF grant.
Since that work had made it to 5.10 and had been backported to the
upcoming 5.8.9, he was happy to leave things there.</p><p>
<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/oud25">http://xrl.us/oud25</a> </pre>

</p><p>Nicholas noticed some <strong> <code>make distclean</code> failures</strong>, in that there
were some files left over from a run of the test suite that weren't
cleanup up after the target was run. Andy Armstrong began to look
at cleaning things up, since he had a nagging suspicion that a
number of them might be his fault.</p><p>

loud what was the new officially sanctioned way of noting new
