and when prodded by Nicholas Clark, produced the delta regarding the
tests that were already failing on 5.8.8.</p><p>

</p><h2> <a name="_version_in_opcode"> <code>$VERSION</code> in <code>Opcode</code> </a> </h2></p><p>Matt S. Trout revived the thread about <code>Opcode</code> and <code>Safe</code> by
talking about <code>version.pm</code>, saying it was a really nice module, just
a shame about it messing with <code>UNIVERSAL</code>. When John Peacock showed
him the scars of six years working to make version comparisons work,
and asked for a test case to show where it didn't work, Matt skirted
the issue by saying that he really liked <em>version.pm</em>'s version
comparison code, and would John accept a patch that switched off
the <code>UNIVERSAL</code> hackery.</p><p>

</p><h2> <a name="oplines___make_perl_runtime_8__faster_and_smaller">oplines - make perl runtime 8% faster and smaller</a> </h2></p><p>Reini Urban mentioned that he was carrying out research to restructure
the way opcodes carry around the original source line number (for
eventual error reporting). First results seemed to indicate that
reasonable code could expect to see an 8% speed increase.</p><p>Dave Mitchell saw that the main thrust of the work was to do away
with <code>nextstate</code> ops, and warned that one of their other purposes,
apart from carrying around line numbers, was to give the interpreter
an opportunity to clear out the temps from the stack.</p><p>Ben Morrow wondered whether the place where the clearing out took
place could be moved from <code>pp_nextstate</code> into <code>Perl_runops_standard</code>

<em>et al</em> instead. Reini thought it wouldn't be necessary, since he
was identifying <code>nextstate</code> ops that do trigger temps housekeeping,
and he wasn't touching those.</p><p>

different Xen VM machines, which, while nearly identical, were
producing two very different results. Despite a couple of good
suggestions from Nicholas Clark, no good answers turned up.</p><p>

</p><h2> <a name="ddump"> <code>DDump</code> </a> </h2></p><p>H.Merijn scratched the same itch twice in the space of a week
regarding the ability to dump a scalar in excruciating detail (using
a secret handshake involving <code>sv_dump</code>) &#224; la <code>Devel::Peek</code> within
<code>Data::Dumper</code>, and so wondered whether he should keep it to
himself, or push the changes outwards either as a CPAN module or
somewhere within core.</p><p>Nicholas Clark thought that that the concept was sound although he
took issue with pumping the results out to a file handle, and thought
it would be better to send it to a scalar, as this gives the client
more flexibility in deciding what to do with it. This would require
changes to all the <code>*dump</code> routines. Graham Barr thought that it
would be easier to define new API entry points that performed the
existing dumps to a scalars.</p><p>In the following discussion, H.Merijn applied a number of changes
that fixed various problems that, alas, my time budget does not
allow me study in greater depth, but he concluded that the changes
where worthy of backporting to the 5.10 branch, and that more tests
were needed for the <code>*dump</code> family of functions.</p><p>

bitrot regarding the statistics of perl test releases, and wondered
whether it was better to bring it up to date, or delete the
information altogether. Moritz Lenz voted for bringing them up to
date, citing a love of statistics.</p><p>Tom Christiansen had also noted the oversight in the recent past,
but wasn't sure whether this was a result of official policy or just
something that had slid under the radar.</p><p>Yitzchak Scott-Thoennes also weighed in saying that it would be
Good and hoped that Abigail would find the tuits to do so.</p><p>

</p><h2> <a name="perlperf_pod_submission"> <em>perlperf.pod</em> submission</a> </h2></p><p>Richard Foley sent in a draft for a document on Perl Performance
and Optimization Techniques (or PPOT). H.Merijn suggested merging
in the points covered by Nicholas Clark's &quot;When Perl isn't fast
enough&quot; talk.</p><p>Reini Urban took the time to fill out the SEE ALSO section with
modules on CPAN that deal with performance issues. Tim Bunce
suggested another place to dig up some nuggets.</p><p>The discussion naturally zeroed in on <code>Devel::DProf</code>, that
Time Bunce declared was broken (and no-one contradicted him) and
said that <code>Devel::NYTProf</code> was in all ways superior.</p><p>Nicholas Clark thought so too, but wondered if NYTProf would be
ready in a year or so for freezing within the official distribution.
He also thought that the NYT (New York Times) aspect was of great
marketing value to show who used and contributed to Perl, in contrast
to Richard Foley's idea of renaming it to NGProf for &quot;New Generation&quot;.</p><p>Rafa&#235;l Garcia-Suarez greeted the inclusion favourably, but noted
that it is (still) rather Windows-unfriendly and contains some
rather unportable code. Interestingly, this was the first time
I can recall that the core developers stated that a perfectly
valid reason for <em>removing</em> a module from the core is that it's
always available on CPAN for those who depend on it.</p><p>Richard then released a second version, based on the feedback
received so far. It will be added to the core. Eventually.</p><p>

</p><p>not realising that what goes between <code>[</code> and <code>]</code> is an expression
and not a series of statements. The problem is that Perl's parser
can do little more than a CP/M BASIC-era &quot;Syntax error&quot; message,
which conveys insufficient information to determine the nature of
one's sins.</p><p>Nicholas Clark devoted the time to figuring out that what needs to
be done is to teach the tokeniser to react to encountering a <code>;</code>
token within an expression and acting accordingly.</p><p>

</p><h2> <a name="hints_file_for_miros_bsd">Hints file for MirOS BSD</a> </h2></p><p>Chris &quot;BinGOs&quot; Williams was playing around with Mir OS (an OpenBSD
fork) after having read about it in Michael G. Schwern's use.perl
blog (search engines take note: Michael G. Schwern has a Perl blog
on use.perl.org). He discovered that the developers there had
created a hints file. He pushed it up to the porters, and Nicholas
folded into the codebase, berating all the while the package maintainers
of the world who choose to live in autarky.</p><p>

<h1> <a name="todo_of_the_week">TODO of the week</a> </h1></p><p>Here's a task chosen entirely at random that requires a certain
amount of C knowledge, and would be a delightful task for someone
wishing to learn a bit more about how the parser works.</p><h2> <a name="error_reporting_of___b___c_">Error reporting of <code>[$b; $c]</code> </a> </h2></p><p>Using <code>;</code> inside brackets is a syntax error, and we don't propose
to change that by giving it any meaning. However, it's not reported
very helpfully:</p><p>

<pre>
    $ perl -e '$a = [$b; $c];'
    syntax error at -e line 1, near &quot;$b;&quot;
    syntax error at -e line 1, near &quot;$c]&quot;
    Execution of -e aborted due to compilation errors.</pre>
</p><p>It should be possible to hook into the tokeniser or the lexer, so
that when a <code>;</code> is parsed where it is not legal as a statement
terminator (ie inside <code>{}</code> used as a hashref, <code>[]</code> or <code>()</code>) it
issues an error something like <em>';' isn't legal inside an expression
- if you need multiple statements use a do {...} block</em>. See the
thread starting at <a href="http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2008-09/msg00573.html">http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2008-09/msg00573.html</a> </p><p>(or the thread summarised elsewhere in this issue. Consider
it a fringe benefit that goes with the job).</p><hr>
<h1> <a name="patches_of_interest">Patches of Interest</a> </h1></p><h2> <a name="2038_fix">2038 fix</a> </h2></p><p>Michael G. Schwern sent the heads-up on his ongoing work to make
Perl deal correctly with dates beyond 2038 (which would otherwise
overflow the underlying 32-bit storage used). He was delighted to
receive some Windows feedback from Steve Hay, and asked for the
changes to be folded back into blead in order for the code to
receive wider cross-platform exposure.</p><p>

</p><h2> <a name="fix_dosglob_to_work_with_paths_containing____s">Fix <code>DosGlob</code> to work with paths containing ()'s</a> </h2></p><p>Alex Davies taught <code>DosGlob</code> to deal with filenames that contain
parentheses. This is important on Windows where one often encounters
files names of the <em>Copy (2) of foo</em> nature. Shlomi Fish suggested
that a test-case would be a nice addition to the patch, as it
would have caught a problem in Alex's own patch.</p><p>

to be simple off-by-one sizing error. Nicholas Clark thought that the
code was identical as far as he tell to that of blead, and yet there
was no problem there. There were other puzzling symptoms that made
Nicholas suspect there was something deeper afoot, but couldn't see
how to coax the problem out into the open.</p><p>

p5p threads on the issue of Unicode implementation issues in Perl
5. He also identified the list of contentious operators and operations
performed with Unicode data.</p><p>One important point Glenn raised was that Windows filenames and
Unicode do not get along well, since Perl doesn't use the UTF-16
system APIs. Changing this will cause pain, but it currently
prevents people from writing multi-lingual applications on
Windows in Perl.</p><p>

filenames and line numbers when decoding <code>#line</code> directives. He
suggested changing the regular expression to make it correspond
with what really happens under the hood. Rafa&#235;l Garcia-Suarez
suggested that it might be better to fix the tokeniser in order
to make it match the documentation, as what it purports to
document is more useful than how things behave currently.</p><p>

perl on a big endian MIPS64 platform. The problem was that there is
a paucity of information in the <em>hints/mips.sh</em> file; so much so
that the configuration probes are unable to determine a viable
strategy for dealing with 64-bit integers. H.Merijn Brand hinted
that it might take a significant amount of work to get things into

and proposed a patch to attempt to address the problem. Eric Brine
pointed out that subroutines (and hence, modules) that return values
by accident when called in void context would break with Luke's
change, not the least of which is <code>Tie::Array</code>.</p><p>Luke returned with a variant that seemed reasonable to Rafa&#235;l,
who thought that, by extension, the same reasoning could be applied
to <code>unshift</code>. So Luke returned with a third variant that took

<code>unshift</code> into account as well. And things stopped there for the
moment.</p><p>

version of the <em>META.yml</em> specification.</p></dd><dd>

<h2>What happened to the previous summaries?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/grinder/">grinder</a> on 2008-10-06T07:38:15</h3>
<p>I had difficulties over the past few weeks loading the summaries but things appear to be fixed now, which is why the last four are missing. Would people be interested in reading them if I post them, even if they are out of order?</p>

<h2>Yes please.</h2>

I definitely would be interested.  Maybe you could just add a short note about the ordering to avoid confusion.
