<p>Dominic Dunlop: Trouble is, some of it is CGI, and people whinge

found in a Perl CGI program somewhere.</p></p>

<h2> <a name="5_8_9_to_be_on_irix">5.8.9-to-be on Irix</a> </h2>
<p>David Cantrell took the time to track down the failures (regarding
<code>Sys::Syslog</code>) with the upcoming 5.8.9 release. Versions 0.13
(bundled with 5.8.8) through 0.18 both pass on 5.8.8 and 5.8.9-tobe
on Irix. 0.19 and beyond fail on both versions. But 0.24 (the
current version) does pass on platforms other than Irix.</p>
<p>David provided an additional clue, in that the compiler moaned that
something was wrong with a variable named <code>RETVAL</code> (a name that
will strike fear into any author starting out in XS).</p>

<p>S&#233;bastien Aperghis-Tramoni, the current maintainer, wailed in
despair, since 0.18-0.19 was a monster release, introducing
support for the Win32 platform. After a couple of hours of
serious work (and some minor goofing off), he offered a Subversion
version for David to try. David announced that it worked, although
the compiler was still a little suspicious of <code>RETVAL</code>.
S&#233;bastien fixed that as well.</p>
<p>And S&#233;bastien will buy David a beer at the next London Perl
Workshop.</p>

<h2> <a name="file__path__mkpath___incompatibility_in_perl_5_10">File::Path::mkpath() incompatibility in perl-5.10</a> </h2>
<p>Gisle Aas ran into grief over old-style/new-style interface for
<code>File::Path</code>. As a result, David Landgren learnt that sometimes
it doesn't pay to be too Clever when trying to introduce new
features while maintaining pure backwards compatibility at the
same time.</p>

<p>Thus, the next release of File::Path will guarantee total
backwards compatability, and those wishing to live on the
cutting edge will have to say so, one way or another.</p>

<h2> <a name="eval_require_foo_with_binary_incompatible_xs_modules"> <code>eval &quot;require Foo&quot;</code> with binary-incompatible XS modules</a> </h2>
<p>Niko Tyni was running into problems setting up Debian packages in order
to upgrade from 5.8.8 to 5.10.0. The main reason being that Debian
don't use a <code>$Config{vendorarch}</code>, which was designed to resolve the
problem of keeping binary-incompatible XS code apart.</p>
<p>There were a number of suggestions as to what could be done to fix
up the situation, but Nicholas Clark was hesitant to endorse any of
them, pointing out quite rightly that Debian had already survived
the 5.6-to-5.8 upgrade.</p>

<p>After pondering the issue for a couple of hours, he released a
second version with a new, improved class-based scheme. Unfortunately,
in Ricardo's eyes, the syntax sucks. With a bit of encouragement
from the parser, it might be possible to come up with something
beautiful.</p>

<h2> <a name="division_by_zero_folding_deferred_to_run_time">Division by zero folding deferred to run-time</a> </h2>
<p>Eric Brine wondered what the reasoning was behind deferring constant
folding (such as 1/0) until run-time, when it could be caught at
compilation time (as, in fact, it used to in 5.8).</p>
<p>Nicholas Clark explained that the concept as such was an optimisation,
and as such it should not affect the behaviour of a program. For
instance:</p>
<pre>
  print 1/0 if $ARGV[0] &gt; 10;</pre>
<p>... could not be compiled at all on 5.8, even though in some
circumstances the code may never be executed in the first place.</p>
<p>The point in question is that such a construct might be hidden
behind two constants subs that have different values depending on
the platform the code is running on. In that case, the code might
be uncompilable even though the program itself could run perfectly
well.</p>

<h2> <a name="compiling_perl__5_10_x__with_gcc____3_2_3">Compiling perl (5.10.x) with gcc &lt;= 3.2.3</a> </h2>
<p>After sparring with the RT bug database, Bram began to install
as many versions of <code>gcc</code> as he could lay his hands on, to see
how they fared compiling perl.</p>
<p>When he got as far back as version 3.2.3, the <code>Configure</code> and

<code>make</code> succeeded, but the test suite spat out numerous
&quot;libgcc_s.so.1: cannot open shared object file&quot; errors.</p>
<p>Andy Dougherty suggested a riff on the <code>-fstack-protector</code>
problems seen elsewhere this week, but that didn't do any
better. Since the compiler in question was released five
years ago, Andy suggested just adding a note in the <em>INSTALL</em>
file.</p>
<p>H.Merijn Brand committed change #33841 to note the fact
in <em>README.linux</em>, but wasn't really happy with the idea,
since gcc runs on other platforms as well. But that's ok,
because he will have to revert the change, since Bram
figured out a simple recipe that allows 3.2.3 to work.</p>

<p>
<h2> <a name="empty_pattern_and__o">Empty pattern and /o</a> </h2>
<p>Bram lifted an old bug out of obscurity, concerning the
empty pattern (<code>//</code>) and the <code>/o</code> modifier, the point
in question being the interactions observed when <code>use re 'eval'</code>
comes into play.</p>

<p>Yves Orton grumbled that all these things were complicated to
begin with, so one can grasp the potential for mischief when they
interact in a single expression.</p>
<p>Abigail thought it would be nice to downplay the importance
of <code>/o</code> in the documentation, since it invariably led people
to find out about it, and then proceed to use it incorrectly.</p>
<p>Similarly, Abigail thought that <code>//</code> (match again with the
same pattern that was used previously) doesn't have any use
in the real world; most canonical examples being somewhat
contrived. What does happen with annoying regularity is that
people use <code>/$var/</code>, and $var turns out to be empty, thus
triggering an unexpected action at a distance.</p>
<p>Yves Orton wanted to make <code>/o</code> a true no-op, and make the
magic empty pattern behaviour only kick in if the pattern
was well and truly a <code>//</code> as parsed. And it probably comes
as no surprise that Yves had a couple of perfectly
reasonable use cases where <code>//</code> patterns are very useful:</p>

<pre>
  if (m/$some_big_nasty_pattern/ and $1 eq $something) {
    s///;
  }</pre>
<p>and</p>
<pre>
  if (m/$pat1/ or m/$pat2/ or m/$pat3/) {
    s///;
  }</pre>
<p>Yves was careful to point out that he only used empty pattern magic
with the substitution operator. For the match operator, he
thought the empty pattern should warn all the time.</p>
<p>And <code>/o</code> can't be no-op'ed just yet, since it still adds a
tiny smidgen of performance, even in 5.10. So first of all
Yves needs to fix the underlying problems that make it useful
in the first place, at which point it could be deprecated.</p>

<h2> <a name="remove_duplication_of_test_setup">Remove duplication of test setup</a> </h2>
<p>Schwern notes that there's duplication of code - lots and lots of tests have
some variation on the big block of <code>$Is_Foo</code> checks.  We can safely put this
into a file, change it to build an <code>%Is</code> hash and require it. Maybe just put
it into <em>test.pl</em>. Throw in the handy tainting subroutines.</p>

<p>Shlomi Fish responded to the criticism of his patch (it should not
be accepted since it has a higher maintenance burden due to
linkrot), arguing that a quality product requires maintenance, and
a high quality product requires more maintenance.</p>
<p>Quoting Nicholas Clark:</p>
<p>There is a fundamental conflict in the Perl documentation as is.
People are tugging it in both ways - it's trying both to be a
reference manual (terse, to the point), and an introduction/tutorial.</p>
<p>It can't be both. It certainly can't be all things to all people. [...]</p>

<p>We have to assume some level of intelligence on the part of the
readership. If they don't know a concept, they will be smart enough
to research it for themselves.</p>

H.Merijn Brand applied the change, and idly wondered whether it
will be possible with git to reject a patch that contains such base sins.</p>

<p>Bram tried to sneak this one past as being resolved, since it certainly
looked like it. Nicholas Clark disagreed, explaining that there was a
problem with it, although likely one that only he could fix.</p>
<p>So Bram asked Nicholas to explain more clearly what the problem was, or
rather, given what input produces incorrect output?</p>

<p>Bram asked for a resolution on this issue. Andy Dougherty replied that
functions don't fail on tainted args unless they have an impact on the
outside world. <code>glob</code> pulls information in from the outside world, so
we don't care about what we ask of it. On the other hand, what <code>glob</code>
returns is viewed with the utmost suspicion.</p>

<p>Bram implemented David Landgren's suggestion (or something resembling
it) to create a regression test for the code to deal with a directory
search starting with a volume name and a relative directory (that
is, something like <code>D:right\here</code>.</p>

<h2> <a name="deparse_interpolation_in_regex_literal___51848_">Deparse interpolation in regex literal (#51848)</a> </h2>
<p>Ambrus Zsb&#225;n had filed a report about <code>B::Deparse</code> failing to restitute
<code>/${x}y/</code> correctly. Rafael Garcia-Suarez commented this week, saying that
it failed because the optree was missing an <code>op_concat</code>, and this threw
everything else off. Rafael proposed a first fix, with ugly cutting and
pasting, but then sat down like a good boy and did a proper refactoring
and wrote some regression tests as well (change #33851).</p>

<p>This did lead him to wonder, all the same, <em>why</em> the opcode was no longer
there. Yves Orton blamed Dave Mitchell. Dave replied saying that yes, it
was his fault. The change was a result of some initial work some time ago
to make <code>(??{...})</code> work better. The idea is to had the regexp compiler
a list of tokens that comprise the code block, instead of a single blob
of uselessness.</p>

<p>Tom Wyant read about this problem in the perl5-porters summary, and was

applied the patch to blead, hoping that no Leopards, Tigers or other
such beasts would be hurt in the process.</p>

<h2> <a name="elseif_should_be_elsif___53808_"> <code>elseif</code> should be <code>elsif</code> (#53808)</a> </h2>
<p>Ben Aveling got mixed up between Perl and Ruby or PHP or ASP or TCL
or not Javascript and wrote <code>elseif</code> instead of <code>elsif</code>. Instead
of receiving a boring syntax error, Ben was slightly puzzled by the
fact that he received an explicit recommendation to change <code>elseif</code>

to <code>elsif</code>. His reasoning was that if the lexer is so smart to
second-guess the programmer, why not just emit the elsif token and
be done with it.</p>
<p>Abigail pointed out that doing this would break any code that defined
a sub named <code>elseif</code> (although it could be argued that any programmer
doing so should be taken out the back and beaten severely about the
head with a blunt object). David Nicol gave <code>Macrame</code> a plug, showing
how one could write a macro for this situation. Yitzchak Scott-Thoennes
pointed out that a language change of this nature would break
syntax-highlighters.</p>

horrible. Dominic Dunlop replied that many different systems handle
high resolution time measurements in many weird and wonderful ways.</p>

He was brave enough to delve into <em>Pod/Man.pm</em> and produce a

what a function returns. David Nicol was hard pressed to classify
the problem as a bug from either a documentation or implementation
standpoint.</p>
<p>Aristotle Pagaltzis admitted to having been bitten by the bug before,
Abigail suggested using the secret <code>+</code> operator to disambiguate the
meaning. David finished with a revised wording for the documentation,
and there the thread ended.</p>

lots of messy warnings.</p>
<p>Nicholas Clark fixed things up so that <code>POSIX</code> now imports what
it needs from <code>Fcntl</code> instead of reinventing wheels badly. In
the process of cleaning things up, he realised that there was
scope for doing the same kind of decrufting elsewhere in the
codebase, which should worth another TODO.</p>

<p>This week, Niko Tyni also uncovered another way to generate a
segfault, but admitted that it wasn't a very important issue.</p>

<p>Niko also rediscovered the bug involving a capture group and a
curly specifier in a regexp. Apart from the fact that no-one
can provide a definition of what such an expression should
do, it certainly shouldn't dump core.</p>
<p>David Landgren grovelled through his memory and old summaries
and identified bug #39233 as an earlier instance of the same
underlying problem. Yves Orton assigned himself the bug so as
not to forget about it.</p>

<h1> <a name="in_brief">In Brief</a> </h1>

<p>(My damned wireless network at home kept flaking out this week,
causing my ssh sessions to die. At some point during an evening's
summarising, I noticed that the file was truncated right about here.
I've restored the rest of it from a backup, but some items I wrote
between then and now were wiped out. Sorry about that. Since what
goes here is usually short, and resolved, it's not so bad).</p>
<p>Rafael Garcia-Suarez took chromatic's patch to <strong>add ..., !!!, and ??? operators</strong>
and applied it.</p>

<p>Yves Orton announced that he was out of action but <strong>back in the
saddle again</strong> a bit. Marvellous. Now he'll go and add a slew of
regexp verbs, and I still haven't digested the first lot.</p>

<p>Bram looked at a <strong>perl -d bug on Mandriva Cooker with 5.8.8</strong> (bug #39758)
and said it looked pretty good (although the jury was still out on 5.8.9-tobe)</p>
