<h2> <a name="fascinating_paper__heapsort_with_n_log_n____0_9n_comparisons">fascinating paper: heapsort with n log(n) - 0.9n comparisons</a> </h2>
</p> <p>Last week, Marc Lehmann had tossed out a link to an interesting
paper he had read on heapsorts, with a new implementation that
purported to require fewer comparisons.</p>
<p>This week John P. Lindeman wrote a very thoughtful reply that's
worth reading in its own right. In essence, one of the fundamental
problems facing heapsort these days is that it is very cache-unfriendly.</p>
<p>Quicksort and mergesort tend to process data sequentially, and
that plays nicely with how caches behave. Heapsort, on the other
hand, tends to skip around all over the place, and that leaves
the cache lines cold and unloved. And so John feels that heapsort
will be unlikely to beat the other algorithms consistently,
especially when large datasets are processed, which is where
the correct use of cache comes into play.</p>

<h2> <a name="helping_5_8_9">Helping 5.8.9</a> </h2>
</p> <p>Nicholas Clark asked for some volunteers to help with the mundane
pumpking tasks that need doing when a new release goes out the door.
Such things as checking author/email names, module versioning,
dual-life synchronisations and making suggestions for <em>perl589delta.pod</em>.</p>
<p>Yitzchak Scott-Thoennes checked out most of the CPAN/core discrepancies.
Steffen M&#252;ller did the author names.</p>

</p> <p>Jim Cromie started to play around with git, and the more he looked

ignoring files not under revision control, but Rafael thought
that he had the logic completely backwards.</p>

<h2> <a name="adding_new_keywords">Adding new keywords</a> </h2>
</p> <p>Simon Wistow, in a flash of inspiration, realised that it would
be fun to dive into the guts and figure out how to add a new
keyword to the language, such as <code>method</code>, which would start out
being a simple alias for <code>sub</code>. He was quite surprised at how easy
it was, and on which side things that can be implemented both inside
or outside the core should be.</p>

<p>Jonathan Rockway muttered about <code>Devel::Declare</code> and
<code>Method::Signatures</code>. Jesse Vincent revealed that Chia-liang Kao
and Yuval Kogman were working on <code>Perl6-Declare</code> that was much
more robust and flexible than <code>Method::Signatures</code>.</p>
<p>Matt S. Trout thought that Jesse's recent work on MAD and Yuval's
start on <code>B::Simple</code> should be a big help in making the perl5
syntax more malleable.</p>

<h2> <a name="todo_tests">TODO Tests</a> </h2>
</p> <p>Bram saw what he thought was a flaw in the infrastructure for
dealing with TODO tests. Imagine a function that should return
1. Except it doesn't, because a bug that no-one understands
makes it return 2.</p>
<p>So we write a TODO test to say &quot;this should return 1&quot;. Now
imagine that the bug was tickled, and now the function returns
3. Currently there's no way of detecting that the value,
while still incorrect, has changed. Some people were dubious
about the value of detecting this.</p>

</p> <p>S&#233;bastien Aperghis-Tramoni had a couple of questions about the
new 5.10 regexp extensions (or rather, the documentation that
explains their behaviour). After a couple of porters worked the
the problems in the wording, Aristotle Pagaltzis wrote up a new
description, that Yves Orton thought was a good description.</p>

<h2> <a name="understanding_refcounts">Understanding refcounts</a> </h2>
</p> <p>Simon Wistow was looking at <code>Devel::Gladiator</code>, a module that
examines memory allocations in arenas (geddit?), and wondered
why, given two nearly identical snippets, one leaked massively
while the other didn't.</p>
<p>Naturally, Dave Mitchell gave a cogent explanation as to why, and
demonstrated a simpler case in a couple of lines of Perl, no modules
needed.</p>

<h2> <a name="thoughts_about_overloading_method_calls">Thoughts about overloading method calls</a> </h2>

</p> <p>Ricardo Signes want to do some exotic things with classes, objects
and overloading. Aristotle Pagaltzis admitted to having wanted to
do as much in the past. &#198;var Arnfj&#246;r&#240; Bjarmason had
thought of doing even more bizarre things, and I would say more,
but alas this paragraph is too small for it to fit.</p>
<p>The thread is well worth reading in its entirety, for a view on
the current thinking on allowing more flexible syntaxes.</p>

</p> <p>Lyle ran into a problem with recursive inheritance and wondered why
things didn't work in a way that would make it possible.</p>
<p>Nicholas Clark explained that the code that looks after this was
heavily rewritten thanks to Brandon Black and his MRO work. He also
thought that it should be possible to plug in a custom MRO handler
that would do what Lyle wanted.</p>

</p> <p>Following up on Andy Lester's blog about the grief caused by
<code>BEGIN: { }</code>, which is a labelled lexical scope rather than
a <code>BEGIN</code> block, there was a tentative suggestion to make
such things warn.</p>
<p>Most people weren't too comfortable with the idea, suggesting
that if it was really a problem then it would have wound up on
the TODO list at some point.</p>

</p> <p>In playing around with BEGIN blocks while researching things
from the above thread, Aristotle Pagaltzis came across some
some strange behaviour with a BEGIN block within a subroutine.</p>
<p>Nicholas explained how it was quite consistent given the rules
concerning compile-time and run-time effects, and Jan Dubois
wrapped out the remaining doubts.</p>

<h2> <a name="on_the_almost_impossibility_to_write_correct_xs_modules">On the almost impossibility to write correct XS modules</a> </h2>
</p> <p>Marc Lehmann had raised the problem of <code>char *</code> as an interface to
character strings in XS last week. Yves Orton pointed out that this
is used internally by the core, and thus faces the same issues. Win32
is particularly sensitive to the issue.</p>

likelihood of them becoming obsolete and therefore contributing to
the maintenance burden.</p>

<h2> <a name="i_must_be_mad">I must be <em>mad</em> </a> </h2>
</p> <p>Jesse Vincent moved MAD's libraries under <em>lib/</em> and placed them
under the <code>MAD::</code> namespace. Other than that he tidied up Gerrard
Goossen's work on the test suite and generally brought the bitrot
level down close to zero.</p>
<p>Gerrard wondered whether, because of the dependency on <code>XML::Parser</code>,
if it wouldn't be better to spin the libraried out completely as
CPAN modules. Jesse felt that pulling MAD too far away from the
core would all but ensure its demise.</p>

</p> <p>In the ongoing saga concerning <code>mg_free</code> and <code>mg_clear</code>, Bram
identified only one other place in the core where <code>SV*MAGICAL_off()</code>
was called after <code>mg_free</code>. So he cleaned things up, and Rafael
Garcia-Suarez applied his patch.</p>

earth someone would want to do such a thing, to which Bram replied
that it would make testing easier. John suggested a different
approach that, while more work for Bram, better reflected what
was going on under the hood.</p>

<h2> <a name="add_svmortal_to_check_if_a_sv_is_mortalized">Add <code>SvMORTAL</code> to check if a SV is mortalized</a> </h2>
</p> <p>Claes Jakobsson was grovelling deep in XS code, trying to figure out
whether SV were mortal or not, and was surprised to discover that
there was no simple check available. So he wrote a macro to allow
SVs to be tested as such.</p>
<p>Rafael wondered whether it would be more interesting to wrap it up
as a module so that older perls could use it. In turn, Claes wondered
if the hassle of setting up the module and having the XS author
bring it in and use it was worth it.</p>
<p>Nicholas was hesitant to load up the core with yet another addition
to the API, and when Claes thought about writing regression tests for
it, he realised that the best place for it would be on CPAN.</p>

cross-compilation failure, the exact problem being a <code>make</code> target
<code>&lt;command-line&gt;</code> not having a rule in the <em>Makefile</em>. Andy
Dougherty noticed it this week, and suggested that it was quite
possible that just deleting the target in the <code>Makefile</code> would be
sufficient.</p>

</p> <p>Also back in January, Devogon filed a report with <code>NDBM_File</code> not
being built on 5.10.0 under Debian. Andy had a look at things, and
saw that they had changed both the name of the header file (now
called <em>gdbm-ndbm.h</em>) and the library file (<em>gdbm-compat</em>).</p>

<p>Andy wanted to patch <em>Configure</em> to do the right thing and so
made a request for comments. Currently there are three different
header files to search, as well as three different library
names. The question was whether there were any other possibilities
lurking about on other platforms.</p>

<h2> <a name="crash_when_localizing_a_symtab_entry___52740_">Crash when localizing a symtab entry (#52740)</a> </h2>
</p> <p>In April, Niko Tyni wrote a very detailed bug report concerning a
segfault in a mod_perl environment. This provided sufficient
information to Rafael Garcia-Suarez to make a small change to
<em>sv.c</em>, which was later officialised as change #33807.</p>

</p> <p>This is the thread about the correct use of <code>SvCUR</code>. Nicholas Clark
revived the thread when he explained that one of the reasons the
code broke was that because when gcc is instructed to add the
<code>-g</code> compiler switch for debugging purposes, <em>Configure</em>

piggybacks this and enables a raft of code assertions, and <code>JSON::XS</code>
was tripping over one of them.</p>
<p>Many new assertions had been added to the code by Nicholas when he
worked on slimming down the SV bodies, and he needed to be sure that
nothing broke out in the wild (due to a cavalier approach to the
internals). Andreas K&#246;nig's long BBC smoke
campaign showed that by and large Nicolas's changes were completely
transparent.</p>
<p>Marc Lehmann compared 5.8.8 and 5.10.0, running bare, or with POSIX
loaded, and noticed that while the bare binary was smaller, the size
when POSIX was loaded showed a larger increase on 5.10 compared to
5.8. This appeared to contradict the statement in <em>perldelta</em>, and
this left Marc feeling a bit confused.</p>

<p>Bram simplified matters, which made it clear to see what the problem was.

<h1> <a name="in_brief">In Brief</a> </h1>
</p> <p>Bhavna Yadav wondered how to <strong>port a Perl script on Vxworks</strong>.
Dominic Dunlop pointed out that Wind River ported Perl independently
to their Vxworks operating system... seven years ago, and as far
as Dominic was aware, no porter had any technical knowledge of the

<p>In the <strong>Taint (PL_tainting, SvTAINTED_on, SvTAINTED_off, SvTAINT)</strong>

<p>Abigail also wrote an initial cut to <strong>teach <code>File::Copy</code> to

for want of a better solution, Jerry D. Hedden changed some
of the failing tests into TODO tests for that platform.</p>

<p>Alexandr Ciornii supplied a <strong> <code>Data::Dumper</code> patch</strong> to make the latest
