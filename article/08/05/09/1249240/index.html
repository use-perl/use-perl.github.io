<h2> <a name="more_on_tainting">More on tainting</a> </h2>
<p>Nicholas Clark thought that a of points Paul Fenwick made regarding
late-acting taint weren't borne out by an inspection of what the
source code actually did.</p>
<p>Although, looking closely, he found a couple of suspect constructs.
He thought that one possibility was to alter <code>$^TAINT</code> to be
<code>undef</code> if no tainting, 1 (or true) if -T tainting, or 0 for
late-acting tainting.</p>
<p>Then again, Paul's idea of deprecating late-acting tainting sounded
like the path of least resistance.</p>

<p>Nicholas apologised to Jim Cromie for having not applied his patch,
noting that at the moment Rafael seems to be the only person
with enough motivation to apply patches.</p>
<p>He thought that Jim's avenue of research seemed promising and
suggested he keep slogging on to see whether the rest of it works.</p>

<h2> <a name="bug_in_if_open_my__fh______">Bug in <code>if(open(my $fh,...))</code> </a> </h2>
<p>In a parallel thread (to bug #53504), Matt Sergeant reopened the
discussion about filehandles persisting past their due date. The
problem arises when one opens a file as a side effect of a conditional
in an if statement.</p>
<p>When Matt learnt that it was sufficient to wrap the <code>if</code> block in
a curly block to force the handle to be closed early, he deemed
that it was no longer such a problem.</p>
<p>Hint: if bug reports don't contain the word &quot;perl&quot;, they run the
risk of being filed in a &quot;possible spam&quot; folder for human perusal.</p>

<h2> <a name="5_6_x_in_the_wild">5.6.x in the wild</a> </h2>
<p>A recent change to the GNU <code>coreutils</code> package has broken the
<em>Configure</em> script for 5.6.x (or rather, it's been fixed for more
recent perls for ages, but hasn't been, and is unlikely to be
backported to 5.6.x).</p>

<p>Jesse Vincent asked for a show of hands to see how many porters are
still using 5.6, to gauge the importance of creating a fix for
software that was released eight years ago.</p>
<p>Gabor Szabo won a surprisingly crowded race, by having the
courage to admit that he has a client still running perl 4.x
in a couple of places.</p>

<h2> <a name="prototypes__parsing_and_optrees">Prototypes, parsing and optrees</a> </h2>
<p>Nicholas Clark thought there was a smidgen of performance to be
gained by figuring out what context	a routine needed to used to
call a function and that maybe a prototype, or its absence, could
help. But Rafael explained that what he was looking at was
actually from something completely different, so the question is
moot.</p>

<p>David Landgren related the tale of a test suite falling into an
infinite loop, spewing out the message</p>
<pre>
  Fatal error 'Exceeded maximum lock level' at line 199 in file
  /usr/src/lib/libpthread/thread/thr_rtld.c (errno = 136039556)</pre>
<p>and wondered if it was the symptom of some recent change. Nicholas
Clark thought that the fact that the test was run on a 6-cpu
machine running FreeBSD 6.0 was probably a better explanation.</p>
<p>Nicholas also thought it would be slightly more helpful if the
<code>-V</code> switch were able to report the number of CPUs on the
machine, at least for a subset of platforms where such a test
was easy enough to determine.</p>
<p>Abe Timmerman looked at the code in Test::Smoke::SysInfo and
wrote no, but I think he meant yes. If so, it should just be
a simple matter of programming...</p>

<p>Stephen Schubiger reported that smoke tests of blead had been crashing
with what turned out to be low-level XS problems. Abe Timmerman had
heard of the problem also occurring on FreeBSD 7.0.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Stephen discovered that the latest release of the
smoker's companion (Test::Smoke 1.32) fixed the problem.</p>

<p>David Cantrell reported the results of a smoke for the upcoming 5.8
release on IRIX. Everything was fine except for a couple of failures
in <code>Sys::Syslog</code>. One issue involved taint, the other was possibly
related to CPAN# 30710, but S&#233;bastien Aperghis-Tramoni had no real
idea about the heart of the problem.</p>

<h2> <a name="parameterize_ptr_table_new_table_size_">Parameterize <code>ptr_table_new(table-size)</code> </a> </h2>
<p>Jim Cromie delivered another fiendishly obscure patch to improve
the performance of ptr_tables, which serve an important role in
implementing hashes. Part of the aim was to expose the guts so that
things like Storable could delve deeper into the core for an
increase in performance.</p>
<p>Nicholas Clark was a bit uncomfortable with the idea, expressing
the wish to see more performance tweaks that don't expand the public
API. Apart from that, he felt that Jim's research might be help
re-tune various magic numbers used for sizing things in the core.</p>
<p>The main sticking point was a useful set of benchmarks to help
examine the result of changes to the core.</p>

<h2> <a name="another_perldoc_shortcut">Another perldoc shortcut</a> </h2>
<p>It suddenly dawned on Gisle Aas that instead of typing <code>perldoc
perlintro</code> one could just as easily type <code>perldoc intro</code>. He wrote
a patch so that if it failed to find something, it would prepend
&quot;perl&quot; to the search string and try again. Thus <code>perldoc re</code> would
continue to return the page on the <code>re</code> pragma, rather than the

<code>perlre</code> page.</p>

integrating into blead. Still not sure if it's all tidied up yet.</p>

<h2> <a name="bug_or_not_constants_warn_only_once">Bug or not? constants warn only once</a> </h2>

<p>Nicholas Clark excoriated the list for wasting time on pointless
questions (why is Ruby slow?) rather than answering more mundane
questions which would help things move forward. The issue at hand
was whether constants should warn once, or as many times as
necessary. Both outcomes are doable, and feasible, so we just
need to decide what to do. All he wanted was someone's opinion.</p>
<p>Aristotle Pagaltzis wanted to be sure that whatever was changed
wouldn't make things slower than they are now, expressing the
opinion (yes!) that things had become slower over time (although
for the most part the price was happily paid). He also took the
time to rewrite Nicholas's proposed tests into something he felt
was easier to read.</p>
<p>Dave Mitchell was very surprised to learn of 2x slowdowns in
the regexp engine, and thought that if this was true then it was
something that needed fixing.</p>
<p>Aristotle referred him to an article by Ben Tilly.</p>

<h2> <a name="mad_dumper___missing_encoding_of_xml_unsafe_literals_in_pre">MAD Dumper - missing encoding of XML-unsafe literals in &quot;pre&quot;</a> </h2>
<p>Jesse Vincent looked at the state of MAD mode in Perl and was dismayed
by the paucity of tests as well as the way it generated XML. Part
of the problem was the fact that the test suite relies on <code>XML::Parser</code>,
which is a slightly odd state of affairs to have. At least until
Dave Mitchell gets around to writing an XML parser using <em>/bin/sh</em>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately Jesse used 5.10.0 as a basis, and significant
changes have been made in 5.11 and thus the patch could not be
applied.  Plus Gerard Goossen had already fixed it. Nevertheless,
had it been applicable, it would have leaked a scalar, although
fortunately Rick Delaney was around to show Jesse how that could
have been fixed.</p>

<p>Perl 6's Synopsis 3 says:</p>
<p> <em>The ... operator is the &quot;yada, yada, yada&quot; list operator, which is used as
the body in function prototypes. It complains bitterly (by calling fail)
if it is ever executed. Variant ??? calls warn, and !!! calls die.</em> </p>

<p>Bram noticed that bug #44833 had been resolved, but no tests were ever
added to help pin down the issue. There was an issue with
the test being run by <code>miniperl</code>, which would possibly give it fits,
so Bram tweaked it to be skipped if run by <code>miniperl</code>.</p>

<p>Rafael applied the patch as it stood, but Ben Morrow thought of a tweak
for additional robustness. Bram adopted the idea, but it was apparently
left unapplied.</p>

issue for a while, he returned to it again this week, asking the porters
whether a deeper overhaul was needed concerning these tests.</p>

<p>Jan Dubois tweaked the Win32 code to return the full 32-bit PID value
on Windows platforms. He also mentioned that <code>system</code> behaves slightly
differently on Windows, in that it returns the PID and not the exit
status.</p>
<p>Paul Johnson thought it was high time (since he's been waiting on it
for ten years) to either document the issue properly, or come up with
a better interface.</p>

<p>In a prelude to major cleanups in <code>Pod::Html</code>, David Landgren submitted
a patch to cleanse the whitespace of tabs, and a second patch to push the
POD down to the end of the file (hint: this comes in handy when using
<code>Devel::Cover</code>).</p>
<p>H.Merijn Brand was loathe to apply the patches, since he remembered
Tom Christiansen vehemently opposing the change last time someone
tried to reformat the code for &quot;stylistic&quot; purposes.</p>

<h2> <a name="clearing_magic__or_length_____0_for_empty____if_utf8_is_in_use____51370_">Clearing magic (or <code>length($@)&gt;0</code> for empty <code>$@</code> if utf8 is in use) (#51370)</a> </h2>
<p>Animator had opened this can of worms last week on the clearing of
magic on <code>$@</code> with an exploration of sorts on how to fix it.</p>

<p>Rafael Garcia-Suarez commented saying that the results looked
reasonable, but of course one could only be sure with a series of
new tests to ensure that nothing had been broken.</p>
<p>So Bram wrote some code and tests and asked for comments. Nicholas
Clark thought that the code Bram had written had the freeing and
clearing of magic the wrong way around. The code also introduced
a new class of macros to deal with the situation; Nicholas felt
this added unnecessary complexity.</p>
<p>Another thing that caught his eye was the fact that one of Bram's
tests induced a <code>panic: sv_len_utf8 cache 17 real 0</code>. This
will need to be looked into. Bram thought that this was probably
a side effect of the UTF-8 flag not being cleared when it should
have been.</p>
<p>So Nicholas did that, and a after thinking about it for a bit
thought that <code>mg_free</code> might be to blame. He and Bram kicked
the idea around a bit more and at one point a proposed change
might have had the side effect of allowing <code>$@</code> to become

<p>This is the thread with Marc Lehmann discussing the use of <code>SvCUR</code>. The

problem or not with <code>sv_upgrade</code> and whether Marc might not be too
liberal in choosing when to access <code>SvCUR</code>.</p>

<p>A change in the core might have been the cause of the problem. Bram
added some tests to make sure things didn't drift in the future. After
a couple of idle suggestions, Andreas K&#246;nig came through with the
patch that seemed to be the root cause.</p>

<h2> <a name="overload_and_fallback_binary_or_______53550_">Overload and fallback binary or (|) (#53550)</a> </h2>
<p>Bram opened a ticket related to bug #53482 which showed the overload
fallback mechanism privileging string context rather than numeric
context, which, in the context of the bug, would have been more useful.</p>
<p>Rafael explained that binary or (<code>|</code>) works on both string and
numbers, so it would be hard to discern what was needed in a
systematically correct way. David Nicol speculated on the possibility
of allowing the author of the overloading to give numeric context
the first chance and resolving the overload.</p>

<h2> <a name="range_operator_and_magic___53554_">Range operator and magic (#53554)</a> </h2>
<p>Bram opened another ticket regarding the range operator, wondering
why the interpreter inspects the contents of <code>$x</code> six times in the
fragment <code>@y = $x .. $x</code>, where $x was a tied variable (and thus
if the magic was being used to piggy-back side effects, the double
magic would throw things out of kilter).</p>
<p>The prompted Dave Nicol to ask if the range <code>1..$x</code>
was driving a for loop, what would happen if the <code>$x</code> value was
modified in the loop. Bram thought that it shouldn't be allowed, and
promised a TODO test for it.</p>

<h2> <a name="patch_for_linux_ldap_groups___53560_">Patch for linux LDAP groups (#53560)</a> </h2>
<p>David Dick encountered a test failure regarding groups (as in
<em>/etc/group</em>) containing spaces in names. This occurred on a Linux
box using LDAP authentication, and so his expedient fix was to
add Linux to the list of platforms where group names could be
expected to contain spaces.</p>
<p>Rafael applied the patch, but H.Merijn Brand rightfully pointed out
this scenario would play out the same way on many other Unix-like
platforms. In which case, a much more robust solution would be to
determine if LDAP (or in fact any NIS/NSS mechanism, come to think
of it) was in use, and use that as a basis for the test.</p>
