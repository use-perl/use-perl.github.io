</p><p>Tom Christiansen commented on Gisle Aas's perldoc shortcut (that
<code>perldoc ipc</code> would redirect to <code>perlipc</code>, assuming no <em>ipc.{pod,pm}</em>

existed), saying that in pre-5.8 times he had been working on a
technique to make <code>perlipc</code> itself, run from the command-line, do
the same thing. Somewhere along the line, things went astray and
the work never made it the core.</p>

<h2> <a name="on_the_almost_impossibility_to_write_correct_xs_modules">On the almost impossibility to write correct XS modules</a> </h2>
</p><p>I might preface this thread &quot;on the almost impossibility to write a
correct summary of a complex subject&quot;. Marc Lehmann had written a
few weeks ago that a bare <code>char *</code> through an XS API is fraught
with peril, because there is no metadata available to tell you if
it's Latin-1, KOI8-R, UTF-8 or something else.</p>
<p>The thread blossomed this week, with a long-running debate about
what is broken (and when, and how). One point that was made is
that Win32 encodes filenames in a particular way that doesn't
really jibe with the rest of the internals. Unfortunately, it is
only with hindsight that the problem really became apparent,
hence the dilemma is that fixing it would break everything that
has tried, with various degrees of success, to work around it.</p>

<p>The <code>utf8</code> flag on SVs was again singled out as being responsible
for world hunger and other assorted ills, with a number of examples
demonstrating the problems.</p>
<p>Rafael Garcia-Suarez outlined an approach that just may be a way
forward out of the mess. After listening to Juerd Waalboer, he
thought that marking an SV as &quot;binary&quot; and thereby disqualified
from being upgraded to Unicode would be quite useful.</p>
<p>Glenn Lindemann invented &quot;blorf&quot; as an opaque token for discussing
the issues without people getting sidetracked over definitions
of bytes, strings, characters, numbers and codepoints.</p>

<h2> <a name="it_s_wafer_thin_">It's wafer thin!</a> </h2>
</p><p>David Nicol's tiny patch to document the empty pattern (<code>m//</code>)
more clearly sparked a fairly intense technical debate over how to
get rid of the latter.</p>
<p>One point of particular interest was when Aristotle Pagaltzis
suggested a <code>s///R</code> modifier which would return a modified copy
of the original string, instead of modifying the contents and
returning the number of matches made.</p>
<p>As it turns out, this would solve a number of problems very nicely,
not the least being the elegantly succinct</p>

<h2> <a name="compiling_5_10_with_g___4_3_0">Compiling 5.10 with g++ 4.3.0</a> </h2>
</p><p>Not content with compiling perl with old gcc compilers, Bram took
a very new one for a spin to see how things worked out.</p>
<p>It did of course go <em>boom</em> (otherwise you probably wouldn't be
reading about it). Bram traced the problems down to typedefs and
enums in system headers, and wondered how in Configure this
could be sorted out.</p>

<h2> <a name="getopt__long____options__installperl_and__v"> <code>Getopt::Long</code>, + options, installperl and +v</a> </h2>
</p><p>Nicholas Clark was looking how to factor out the common code in
<code>installman</code> and <code>installperl</code> and noticed that the main sticking
point regarding <code>installperl</code> was that it admitted a <code>+v</code> switch
(and it does something else than <code>-v</code>), using hand-rolled <code>@ARGV</code>

processing.</p>
<p>This precludes it from using <code>Getopt::Long</code> because, while
<code>Getopt::Long</code> can be taught to accept <code>-x</code> and <code>+x</code>, it offers
no way of discriminating between the two.</p>
<p>Johan Vromans said that as it turns out, with a bit of hand-holding,
it is possible to coax the information out as things stand, and he
plans to improve support for - and + switches in a future release.</p>

<p>Nicholas thought that a middle path might be to keep the hand-rolled
code, but adjust it to dump its results into an <code>%opts</code> hash, which
would allow a drop-in replacement when <code>Getopt::Long</code> gets updated
with the needed functionality.</p>
<p>This brought forth a long discourse from Tom Christiansen, who
admitted to the wrong kind of laziness regarding command-line
switches by resorting to hand-rolling code to deal with a solitary
switch when in fact it would have been better to rely on a module.
When he quizzed Larry Wall about it during the first decade of
Perl's development, Larry admitted to rolling his own frequently,
since it seemed a bit of a waste in his eyes to pull in a module
for just one or two or switches for a program little more than a
one-liner. As a peace offering for his own hand-rolling sins,
Tom offered the list the ultimate file renaming Perl program.</p>

<h2> <a name="on_broken_manpages__trolling__inconsistent_implementation_and_the_difficulty_to_fix_bugs">On broken manpages, trolling, inconsistent implementation and the difficulty to fix bugs</a> </h2>
</p><p>Marc Lehmann wrote a long response to Jan Dubois as a spin-off
from the &quot;On the impossibility of writing XS correctly&quot;, stating
that Perl's Unicode handling because some parts of the core deal
with Unicode one way, and other parts another way. This leads to
annoying bugs, in that they are hard to identify, and hard to
fix.</p>
<p>Tom Christiansen called him out for excessive use of rhetoric
and asked him to clarify a couple of points. Several messages
later Yves Orton offered a nice summary of the situation that
showed where things break down. Then people started to speak about
encodings, bytes, characters and character sets and as usual my
eyes began to acquire that dead fish look.</p>

<h2> <a name="on_the_problem_of_strings_and_binary_data_in_perl">On the problem of strings and binary data in Perl</a> </h2>

</p><p>On the subject of subjects on the problem of things, Yves Orton
broke out into a new thread to discuss the schizophrenic attitude
that Perl has when dealing with strings. He put forward a proposal
for identifying and processing Unicode strings asked people to point
out where he was wrong. Rafael Garcia-Suarez made a decent effort
at doing just that.</p>
<p>Juerd Waalboer provided a contrarian argument, suggesting that
Unicode works pretty well in Perl, insofar as one can have strings
containing Unicode, and other strings containing binary data,
because in a correct program, one usually doesn't have the two
appearing in the same string. (such as having the Thai-encoded
name of a Thai person concatenated with the slurped contents of a
PNG file representing his signature in the same Perl scalar). In
Juerd's eyes, the main problems come about when dealing with pure
binary data and hoping that it doesn't wind of being treated as
Unicode when it shouldn't.</p>

<h2> <a name="english_pm_alias_for___"> <code>English.pm</code> alias for <code>%+</code> </a> </h2>
</p><p>Amir Elisha Aharoni ventured for the first time into the waters
of p5p, suggesting that <code>%NAMED_CAPTURE</code> would be a nice
English name for the new 5.10 <code>%+</code> variable. Yves Orton thought
the idea was worthy of consideration, but one also needed to
deal with <code>%-</code> at the same time, which could be named
<code>%MAMED_CAPTURE_LIST</code>.</p>

</p><p>February 29, 2001 was not a leap year, so trying to format it is an error.
Apparently there is a test in <code>Time::Piece</code> to ensure it fails in the
correct manner. Unfortunately, on some of the more exotic platforms
like VMS and OS/X, the call also correctly fails, but does so in a
way that fools the test suite.</p>

<h2> <a name="some_smoke_digging__hp_ux_failures_">Some smoke digging (HP-UX failures)</a> </h2>

</p><p>H.Merijn Brand delved into HP-UX smoke reports to figure out
what was going wrong. <code>Time::Piece</code> was already under control (see
above), but <code>Math::Trig</code> was failing (and the only recent change
has been an upgrade to <code>Math::Complex</code>). Tests for <code>readdir</code> were
also turning black, which suggested subtler problems.</p>
<p>Half way through the conversation, Craig Berry announced the
integration of Gisle Aas's fix for <code>Time::Piece</code> which addressed
the VMS problems, and H.Merijn reported that it did the trick for
HP-UX as well. Using the power of CPAN, H.Merijn was able to go
through previous <code>Math::Complex</code> versions, and this allowed him
to resolve that problem.</p>

<p>I think the <code>readdir</code> problem was solved by upgrading smoke
harness.</p>
<p>The remaining failure appeared to be caused by <code>use blib</code> hoisting
in an errant directory into <code>@INC</code>. Bram showed him how to fix that,
which should nail down the last error.</p>

<h2> <a name="extutils__parsexs___error_reporting_problem_with_interface_and_alias_keywords"> <code>ExtUtils::ParseXS</code> - Error reporting problem with INTERFACE and ALIAS keywords</a> </h2>
</p><p>About a year ago, Ken Williams explained that, while he was the
maintainer of this module, he didn't know what was the best way
to address the problem that Robert May had brought up regarding
error reporting.</p>
<pre>
  then
  <a href="http://xrl.us/bk9m7">http://xrl.us/bk9m7</a> </pre>

<p>Of the two approached supplied by Robert as a solution, Ken liked
the second one back then, and Nicholas Clark, reviving the
conversation agreed that it seemed to make more sense.</p>
<p>He had a look at how things work currently, and realised that with
a new function, he could effect a small saving of space. As a
result, both the core and <code>EU::PXS</code> could rely on the function.</p>
<p>Nicholas wrote the function, and felt that it would make it into
5.8.9 and 5.10.1.  or older releases, <code>ExtUtils::ParseXS</code> would
need to bundle the function, and emit it as required if the core
didn't supply it.</p>
<p>Rob thought that this sounded reasonable, except that if ever a
bug is found in the function that Nicholas just wrote, it would
need to be fixed both in the core and EU::PXS. Since this would
be less that desirable, Robert said that he would try to come up
with an alternate patch at some point.</p>

<h2> <a name="lib_pm_should_not_warn_about_loading__par_files"> <code>lib.pm</code> should not warn about loading <code>.par</code> files</a> </h2>
</p><p>Paul Fenwick noted that a <code>use lib 'Foo.par'</code> will issue a
warning, but load the damned thing anyway. Since someone pulling
in a library in this way probably has a pretty good idea what
they're doing anyway, Paul thought it would be a good idea to
suppress the warning, just for <code>.par</code> files.</p>

<p>Rafael Garcia-Suarez felt that this made sense, so he applied the
patch. Steffen M&#252;ller wanted to know if this meant that
<em>lib.pm</em> would be dual-lifed, so that 5.8.8 could benefit
from the improvements.</p>

according to ANSI, although he admitted that some older compilers,
such as on AIX, would likely get into trouble over this.</p>

to a HASH, an ARRAY and also a subroutine name. The documentation even
admits as much.</p>

<p>On the other hand, for incorrect use, such as applying it to a scalar, the
error message makes mention of only HASH and ARRAY, not of subroutines.</p>

the perl interpreter complain about memory problems. He wasn't
especially worried about a fix any time soon, but wondered if
it was a symptom of an underlying problem that needed to be
addressed.</p>

<h2> <a name="regexp_modifier_to_disable_interpolation_like_m_____54702_">Regexp modifier to disable interpolation like m'' (#54702)</a> </h2>

</p><p>Ed Avis filed a feature enhancement request, to allow the
<code>/n</code> flag on a regular expression to indicate that no
interpolation should be performed.</p>
<p>Currently, only <code>m'300 $US'</code> (with single quotes as a pattern
delimiter) does no interpolation. Ed thought that <code>/300 $US/n</code>
might be clearer.</p>

</p><p>Jan Dubois isolated a problem in <code>File::Spec::Win32</code>'s <code>catfile</code>
function. The fix from the client side is to stringify a <code>$1</code>
passed as a parameter (a variation on the &quot;better to be paranoid
than sorry&quot; theme), since <code>catfile</code> appears to clobber it with
some other action before getting around to using it. Ideally,

<code>catfile</code> should stringify its arguments itself, although Jan
wondered if there was a more general way of solving the problem.</p>

</p><p>Ricardo Signes wondered why <code>delete local $hash{elem}</code> didn't work
when <code>local $hash{elem}; delete $hash{elem}</code> did. After boggling
briefly over the syntax, Rafael Garcia-Suarez thought it wouldn't
be too hard to make it work.</p>

<p>Craig Berry returned to the <strong> <code>File::Copy</code> &amp; permission bits</strong> issue,
saying that changes were unlikely to fly on VMS. Aristotle Pagaltzis
pointed out that on Windows, files tend to inherit their permission
bits from the directory in which they reside, and that the only
important bit to honour on Unix systems is the execute bit.</p>
