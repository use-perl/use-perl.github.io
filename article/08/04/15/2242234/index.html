<p>David Nicol: I have no idea what <code>NaN(Q)</code> is by the way; Google
suggests it is a furniture store in Japan.</p>
<p>Jarkko Hietaniemi: It's the strong, silent type of NaN. As opposed
to the hysteric, screaming type of NaN (aka NaNS).</p>

<p>David Nicol continued the &quot;unroll map into pushy for loops&quot;
thread with a decent stab at an implementation using his
<code>Macrame</code> macro processing module.</p>

<p>Aristotle Pagaltzis stressed the usefulness of having a
map block producing n elements for each input element,
where n could be a fixed number greater than 1, an
arbitrary number greater than 1, sometimes 0, and
anything in between.</p>
<p>Some map blocks that use such behaviours lead to remarkably
concise code that would be very cumbersome to write in any
other way.</p>

<h2> <a name="perl___33536">Perl @ 33536</a> </h2>
<p>The perl 5.8.9-tobe thread continued to attract traffic this
week. Jan Dubois reported back on the problems that the Vista
platform was causing.</p>
<p>It boils down to the tradeoff between keeping the binary
interface stable while preventing people from outside the
core build from reaching directly into the guts. All you
have to do is define <code>PERL_CORE</code> and you can do whatever
you want.</p>

<p>Jan suggested that one way to do this would be to reorder
the struct members, on purpose, on each maintenance release.
That would quickly smoke out poorly-behaved modules and
make them play by the rules.</p>
<p>Not so unsurprisingly, this met with a certain amount of
favour with the porters; at least, it wasn't dismissed out
of hand.</p>

<h2> <a name="saving_a_pointer_in_every_cop">Saving a pointer in every COP?</a> </h2>
<p>Nicholas Clark had a brainwave, realising that it should be
feasible to shave off a whole pointer from each COP struct.
Sixteen hours later, he delivered the patch to do just that.</p>
<p>He did leave us something to do, though: prove or disprove
that it made things go faster.</p>

<pre>

  <a href="http://xrl.us/bje2w">http://xrl.us/bje2w</a> </pre>
<p>Jerry D. Hedden managed to spot a minor compiler warning, which
Nicholas promptly fixed.</p>
<pre>
  but no benchmarks

<h2> <a name="using__wall_in_modules_generate_tons_of_warnings_in_core_files">using <code>-Wall</code> in modules generate tons of warnings in core files</a> </h2>

<p>G&#225;bor Szab&#243; set about trying to build <code>Prima</code> with the 5.10
Strawberry Perl distribution, and ran into grief over poorly nested
comments (as in <code>/* foo /* bar */</code>).</p>
<p>Andy Dougherty explained that this problem also arose with fussy
compilers on Unix platforms, and there the issue was addressed by
substituting <code>/ *</code> (with a space) for the inner opening comment
marker. It was therefore a simple matter of inspection to figure
out how <em>config.h</em> was generated by Strawberry.</p>
<p>Jan Dubois took a look at <em>win32/config_h.PL</em> and found a
substitution operator that looked like it was to blame. Andy
showed how the <code>Configure</code> process used a <code>sed</code> one-liner
to work around the damage.</p>

<h1> <a name="todo_of_the_week">TODO of the week</a> </h1>
<p>Last week's TODO caught James Bence's attention, so much so that
he outlined an approach he wanted to try and wondered if it would
be acceptable. Rafael Garcia-Suarez explained why it wouldn't (as
it would add to the burden of the pumpking). The primary design
consideration is that it must be able to go about its business
in a completely autonomous manner. That is, no sneaky command-line
switches to spoon-feed it what needs to be done.</p>
<pre>
  figure out what it should do, then make it do it
  <a href="http://xrl.us/bje24">http://xrl.us/bje24</a> </pre>
<p>(I should also mention that this whole TODO idea of the week is not
my own, bla^Wcredit must be given to Nicholas Clark).</p>

<p>
<h2> <a name="compressed_man_pages">Compressed man pages</a> </h2>
<p>Be able to install them. This would probably need a configure test to
see how the system does compressed man pages (same directory/different
directory? Same filename/different filename), as well as tweaking the
installman script to compress as necessary.</p>
<p>(I suspect even getting this working for two common platforms, such
as Linux, *BSD or Solaris, would be a fine start. Other local experts
on other platforms could piggy-back the work done to hit other
targets).</p>

<h1> <a name="patches_of_interest">Patches of Interest</a> </h1>
<p>
<h2> <a name="double_magic_with_____x_">Double magic with '\&amp;$x'</a> </h2>

<p>Rafael Garcia-Suarez applied Vincent Pit's patch. Vincent had also
questioned the wisdom of allowing magic to be triggered merely by the
gathering of information to produce an error message.</p>
<p>Rafael commented that while in essence Vincent was correct, the
unresolved problem about what to do about code in the wild that may
depend of the precise text of an error message meant that it was
probably wiser just to let sleeping dogs lie.</p>

<h2> <a name="make_pl_amg_names_and_pl_amg_namelens_static">Make <code>PL_AMG_names</code> and <code>PL_AMG_namelens</code> static</a> </h2>

<p>Nicholas Clark wrapped up the discussion explaining why these symbols
that had leaked out accidentally in 5.10 had to stay: some linkers might
blow up in their subsequent disappearance, even if the client code makes
no reference to them.</p>

<h2> <a name="is_gv_magical_correctly_checks_isa"> <code>is_gv_magical</code> correctly checks &quot;ISA&quot;</a> </h2>
<p>Gerard Goossen, going through the code with a fine-toothed comb for
his ongoing Kurila project, spotted a mistake due to incorrect
aliasing of a C array. It could never have worked, but then again
no-one ever had problems with it. In any event, Rafael applied
the change since the test suite appears to remain satisfied.</p>
<pre>

  and it does the right thing

<h2> <a name="changes_to_perlsec_pod_and_call_for_removal_of_quicksort">changes to <em>perlsec.pod</em> and call for removal of quicksort</a> </h2>
<p>John P. Lindeman offered a patch to clean some of the more glaring
documentation errors regarding sort in <code>perlsec</code>, and this was
applied by Rafael. He also suggested that the sort subsystem
based on the Quicksort algorithm be removed, since these days the
default mergesort has much better worst-case characteristics for
any pathological set of data you care to throw at it.</p>
<p>Tom Horsley, who wrote the original implementation of quicksort
for perl, made no impassioned claim to keep it in, admitting that
in fact he thought the code had been axed years ago.</p>

<p>Niko Tyni identified the changes which had fixed this bug, but noted that
it is still present in the version of perl shipped with Debian stable (no
sniggering up in the back row please). Don Armstrong, in the Debian bug
report, believes that it may allow arbitrary code to be executed, which
if true, would be very serious indeed.</p>

Juerd Waalboer also identified a mistake.</p>

<p>Christopher E. Stith was surprised by the fact that in 5.10, the
pack formats 'a' and 'A' strip tainting off untrusted input, whereas
5.8 leaves it tainted. Andreas K&#246;nig identified change #24010 as
the cause for the change in behaviour. Alas, that particular change
touched over a dozen files (although 4 were POD files, and, surprise
<em>pp_pack.c</em> was touched)...</p>

<h2> <a name="bizarre_copy_of_array_in_sassign_at_carp_heavy_pm___52610_"> <code>Bizarre copy of ARRAY in sassign at Carp/Heavy.pm</code> (#52610)</a> </h2>

<p>Chris Heath reported a variation on the bizarre copy theme, seen regularly
with <code>Carp</code>. Nicholas Clark thanked him for the report, which contained
a snippet of code that he was able to shrink down even farther.</p>
<p>This led him to conclude that the heart of the matter is an unwanted
interaction between Perl's internal stack and lexical pads, but had no
insight as to what exactly was happening.</p>

<p>Wolf-Dietrich M&#246;ller spotted a regression between 5.8 and 5.10 concerning
the use of an <code>e</code> modifier on a <code>s///</code> operator. Nicholas Clark was dismayed
to discover that the bug is also in 5.8.9-tobe, definitely not good.</p>

<p>Andreas K&#246;nig fired up his binary search bug finder, and discovered that
not one, but two separate changes (#26332 and #26334) was at fault. The
first patch dealt with accelerating <code>s///e</code> expressions by freeing
intermediate temporaries, and the second dealt with <code>s///e</code> that die in
the right hand side result in memory leaks.</p>
<pre>

<h2> <a name="regexp_failure______turns_into_opfail___52672_">regexp failure: <code>(?=)</code> turns into OPFAIL (#52672)</a> </h2>

<p>L. Mai reported another failure due to the  5.10 regexp engine
overhaul: the &quot;match always&quot; <code>(?=)</code> idiom flipped over to mean
&quot;match never&quot;. Fortunately &#198;var Arnfj&#246;r&#240; Bjarmason came
to the rescue with a short, sharp patch to engine to restore the
previous behaviour.</p>
<pre>

<h2> <a name="consistent_localization_between_foreach_______and_while___fh_____52702_">Consistent localization between <code>foreach (...)</code> and <code>while (&lt;fh&gt;)</code> (#52702)</a> </h2>

<p>Ed Avis wanted to have warnings issued when <code>$_</code> was modified, due to
differences in how <code>while</code> and <code>for</code> behave. Rafael Garcia-Suarez thought
that using <code>my $_</code> in 5.10 was a much better idea.</p>

<p>Niko Tyni reported a failure smoking mod_perl2 2.0.4rc1 on 5.10, due
to the new implementation of constant subroutines, going so far as to
identify change #29544 as being the (ir)responsible party. No takers.</p>

<p>Nicholas Clark committed <strong>change #33657 to split out
<code>S_refcounted_he_new_common()</code> from <code>Perl_refcounted_he_new_common()</code> </strong>
after having tested it out on four different machines. Alas, it
still managed to break the build for Jerry D. Hedden. Fortunately,
Nicholas was able to commit the subsequent change #33659 that fixed
