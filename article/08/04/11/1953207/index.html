</p> <p>Dave Mitchell looked through the smoke results from March and saw
less than half a dozen smokes for 5.10.1-tobe. This led him to ask
if some of the regular smokers could schedule a smoke or two on a
more regular frequency (especially after 5.8.9 is released).</p>
<p>Bram asked for some help on how to start smoking, such as what the
most desirable combinations are for smoking. One important point
to come out of the discussion was how useful <code>ccache</code> can be to
cut down smoking time.</p>

<h2> <a name="make_built_in_list_functions_continuous">Make built-in list functions continuous</a> </h2>
</p> <p>Nicholas Clark noticed that one of the Google Summer of Code projects
was to improve the performance of built-in functions, by getting
them to skip the construction of intermediate lists. Nicholas wsa
curious as to what was meant by this, since it isn't part of the
current TODO list.</p>
<p>Wren Ng Thornton replied that it is an optimisation known as
&quot;deforestation&quot; in Haskell parlance, and comes into play when you
have a series of chained maps or greps, and a pipeline of SVs
between each step. The answer to this is to use continuous
functions, which is just a fancy way of saying that they operate
on input and output streams.</p>
<p>Wren offered some rewriting strategies that he thought would
speed things up. It all began to fall apart when Nicholas explained
that during compilation there was never at any point a usable
abstract syntax tree (or AST) that could be used as a basis for
such manipulations, since the tokeniser and lexer emit what is
more or less the final optree directly. Some additional
obligatory fixups are then performed on the tree, as well as
some peep-hole optimisations, but both of these operations are
hopelessly intertwined. A distinct, pluggable optimiser for
Perl 5 remains an elusive dream.</p>
<p>It gets worse. Nicholas said it took him a full time week's
worth of work, just to create opcode optimisations for <code>reverse
sort @pig_pen</code> and <code>foreach (reverse @recusandae)</code>. It took him
a day or so to remove the <code>srefgen</code> and <code>ex-list</code> ops from
the creation of arrayrefs (like <code>[1, 3, 7]</code>) and hashrefs.</p>

<p>He wasn't sure how long it took for Dave Mitchell to teach the
optimiser to perform in-place sorts for <code>@schlip = sort @schlip</code>,
or for Yves Orton to achieve a faster <code>if (%hash) {...}</code>, but
these are the only known examples of optree optimisations in the
past three years. Dave admitted that it was &quot;quite hard&quot;.</p>
<p>Dave explained that the naive approach of &quot;look for a long
string of ops and replace them by a shorter string&quot; are hard
to do and very fragile: they are either easily broken, or
they break other things. And Rafael chipped in to say that it
is difficult to write regression tests for them to boot.</p>
<p>Nicholas thought a better approach would be to get <code>B::Generate</code>
and co. into the state where one could write optree rewriters in
perl Perl and start to explore where the real wins lie. And it just
so happens that Steffen M&#252;ller has been playing around with <code>B</code>

and <code>B::Utils</code> to manipulate the optree and was beginning to make
progress towards doing just that.</p>
<p>The other alternative that Nicholas came up with was to investigate
Larry Wall's MAD work, which purportedly allows one to recover the
original source after compilation (although I believe no-one has
actually managed to achieve this in the general case).</p>

</p> <p>Jim Cromie wrote a patch to expose the underlying hashing mechanisms
used by the internals, so that XS code could use it directly. He
wasn't entirely convinced that it was wise to do so, but a factor
of 5 speed-up was nothing to sneeze at. The fact that it might
help <code>Devel::Size</code> caught Tels's attention, but he wasn't sure he
understood what the patch offered.</p>

<h2> <a name="stupid_transaction_idea">Stupid Transaction Idea?</a> </h2>
</p> <p>Curtis &quot;Ovid&quot; Poe wanted to know if anyone had ever thought about
using forks or threads to create a poor man's transactional memory.
Robin Barker pointed to a talk made by Simon Wistow on the subject.</p>
<p>Mark-Jason Dominus made the connection between this question and
a thread from June 2006 regarding reversible debugging. This revived
the discussion about reversible debuggers and missile launches, until
Abigail dragged things back on track, pointing out that rolling
back transactions is a much simpler proposition than rolling the
universe. For instance, a <code>fire_missile()</code> appears really to
fire a missile, except that in reality it doesn't, not until the
<code>commit()</code> is issued.</p>

<p>Paul Fenwick thought that if anyone was brave enough to pursue
the idea, they could do worse than use a <code>Safe</code> compartment to
ensure that no operations that could not be rolled back were
performed.</p>

<h2> <a name="leopard_has_more_standard__etc_passwd_files_than_previous">Leopard has more standard <code>/etc/passwd</code> files than previous</a> </h2>
</p> <p>Back in October 2007, Rafael Garcia-Suarez committed change #32200 to resolve
a problem on an older OS/X. In newer OS/X versions, a file crucial to the
test suite, <code>nidump</code>, is not longer available, and thus the test suite
fails. Jan Dubois suggested that scraping the output of <code>dscl</code> might do
the job instead. Unfortunately he lacked the tuits to do so.</p>
<p>Nicholas Clark said that Jan should refile it as a bug report so that
it isn't left behind.</p>

<h2> <a name="unicode_5_1_0">Unicode 5.1.0</a> </h2>
</p> <p>The latest Unicode specification was released by UCD. Of particular
interest was the inclusion of uppercase Uppercase &#223; (eszet). Tels
made a cogent argument for the gradual disappearance of such
characters: they are really fiddly to text via SMS. In any event,
Perl now does 5.1.0, which is going to simplify the task of people
who wish to write domino servers (the game, not the Lotus kind).</p>

<h2> <a name="double_magic_with_substr">Double magic with <code>substr</code> </a> </h2>
</p> <p>Vincent Pit had been sufficiently annoyed by magic in <code>substr</code>
being triggered twice, when once was enough, that he sat down and
crafted an elegant patch to fix it up. He had a couple of doubts
about how to deal with the API change.</p>
<p>Nicholas explained how to resolve that by having the old implementation
shuffle off to <code>mathoms.c</code>, and writing a macro that exposes the
old name in terms of the new.</p>

triggered, but questioned the wisdom of invoking magic for something
as tedious as creating an error message.</p>

<h2> <a name="make_pl_amg_names_and_pl_amg_namelens_static">Make <code>PL_AMG_names</code> and <code>PL_AMG_namelens</code> static</a> </h2>
</p> <p>Jan Dubois noticed that a couple of new symbols were being exported
for 5.8.9-tobe. Since they really should be private, he made them
static in blead. Steve Hay applied the patch, and tweaked <em>regen.pl</em>
to get it to keep track of <em>overload.c</em> and <em>overload.h</em>.</p>

<p>Nicholas Clark thought that since 5.10 was out in the wild, it
would not be possible for to hide them, since someone might already
have discovered a way of using them, and thus removing their
public visibility would cause such code to break (or at least,
become unlinkable).</p>

<h2> <a name="perlfunc_pod__atan2_0_0__returns_0__not_undef"> <em>perlfunc.pod</em>: <code>atan2(0,0)</code> returns 0, not <code>undef</code> </a> </h2>
</p> <p>Paul Fenwick noticed a small error in the documentation concerning
<code>atan2(0,0)</code>, as the result of those arguments is undefined. Paul
felt that perl should return <code>undef</code>, but in fact it returns 0.</p>

<p>Mark-Jason Dominus wondered if it would be better to have it throw
an exception, like the logarithm of a negative number, or dividing
by zero. Unfortunately that would be almost certain to break a lot
of code in the wild. Paul felt that a warning would be sufficient,
since people would be free to <code>use Fatal</code> and thus obtain an
exception in due form.</p>
<p>Rafael Garcia-Suarez invited interested parties to look at the
<code>atan2</code> manpage on FreeBSD, which put forward some reasons why
returning 0 can make sense.</p>
<p>Dave Mitchell then looked at the source and discovered that perl
just returns whatever the underlying C library does. Andy
Dougherty investigated further and determined that some platforms
do indeed return 0 (as dictated by the C89 standard) and some will
also set <code>errno</code> to EDOM.</p>
<p>Nicholas Clark was of the opinion that <code>CORE::atan2</code> should
return 0, and that leaves <code>POSIX::atan2</code> free to call the
underlying library.</p>

</p> <p>Last last year, Steve Peters outlined a scenario where <code>dup</code>ing
a file descriptor during a <code>close</code> could cause a file descriptor
to be leaked.</p>
<p>Nicholas Clark admitted this week that since Nick Ing-Simmons's
passing, probably no-one understood how <code>PerlIO</code> works deep down.
In any event, he thought the code as it stood appeared to be
sufficiently wrong to merit a fix.</p>
<p>This it turn reminded Craig Berry to ask why <code>PerlIOUnix_open</code>
hard-wires the opened file to 0666 wide-open permissions, and
wondered why the code didn't honour the current <code>umask</code>

setting. Dave Mitchell explained that the kernel took care of
that.</p>

between these two syntaxes (for example, that the former fails
to match some things that the latter does), Robin Barker
chose to document the differences.</p>

</p> <p>Steve Peters wondered whether the patch included in bug #43294
would fix this problem. Which it didn't, but that left him
asking why <code>\x14ffff</code> was considered to be a valid character.</p>

<p>Chris Hall thought that it was but <code>utf::valid</code> was also happy
with <code>0x000000</code> through <code>0x13ffff</code> and <code>0x150000</code> through
<code>0x7fffffff</code>, which left him puzzled as to why <code>utf::valid</code>

was singling out the <code>0x14xxxx</code> range.</p>
<p>Chris wondered if the patch Steve was looking at was causing
<code>utf::valid</code> to reject both 'ill-formed' byte sequences as well as
'non-characters'. Either way, it seemed to be sitting on the
fence and not have a clear purpose.</p>

The name's "wren ng thornton" I'm not sure where that ancient alias crept in from...<br/><br/>(And it's not just haskell parlance, it's common parlance for optimization in general<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
