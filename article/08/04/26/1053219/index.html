<p>The Perl 6 design team met by phone on 23 April 2008.  Larry, Allison, Patrick, Jerry, Will, Jesse, Nicholas, and chromatic attended.</p>
<p><p> <strong>Jerry:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>we're in a period where everyone's trying to break Parrot</li>
<li>they're adding new features and accidentally breaking thing</li>
<li>but they're fixing it</li>
<li>it's a good part of the cycle</li>
<li>people fix it</li>
<li>we don't have a build farm, so we can't test everywhere before
committing to trunk</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Patrick:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>I thought that was the point of the release cycle</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Jerry:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>some people have suggested that we always keep trunk building and passing tests</li>
<li>but we don't have the means to do that</li>
<li>especially when we're playing with config</li>
<li>moving on, the big news is that TPF has six slots in Google's Summer of Code</li>
<li>one of them is fleshing out the Perl 6 test suite</li>
<li>we've needed someone to spearhead that</li>
<li>having a funded new contributor is wonderful</li>
<li>two Parrot-related projects</li>
<li>one is generating NCI stubs</li>
<li>Kevin Tew, a long-time contributor</li>
<li>the other is the incremental GC specified in the PDD</li>
<li>that's Andrew Whitworth</li>
<li>there's also an ASF project for integrating the GC from Apache Harmony into Parrot</li>
<li>they've wanted to release it as a standalone library</li>
<li>Parrot's the first test of a standalone system</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Nicholas:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>nice that it doesn't count against TPF's slot list</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Jesse:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>and it's nice visibility for Parrot from another group</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Jerry:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>I finally have six weeks of no plans to travel</li>
<li>should be able to devote more time to Parrot and Rakudo</li>
<li>looking forward to that</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Larry:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>getting some hacking in on my two pet bugaboos, the longest token matcher and match object generator</li>
<li>I refactored the matcher</li>
<li>it still uses TGE</li>
<li>instead of lumping all of the expect term possible tokens (that is, all of them) into one bucket it separates them into buckets based on their first letter</li>
<li>it's a one-level tree</li>
<li>we can build a much smaller DFA for the regexes that start with that letter</li>
<li>it caches that, of course</li>
<li>can get an instant reject if the next token can't possibly start with that letter</li>
<li>also flattened out all of the rules such that the list of tokens is easy to read</li>
<li>if the first probe with the DFA engine fails, I can take that small set of tokens that start with the same letter, run all of those rules, and sort from longest to shortest</li>
<li>preserves the token matching order without building huge DFA structures</li>
<li>as a backoff strategy, that will scale pretty well</li>
<li>refactored the parameter passing on the matcher side (STD 5)</li>
<li>instead of passing an initial array of random things, I have parameters</li>
<li>constructs match objects more correctly</li>
<li>in the sense that it gets all the information it's supposed to have</li>
<li>also has some attachments where it shouldn't have</li>
<li>I'm cleaning that up</li>
<li>that should scale pretty well</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Jerry:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>is there a drop in memory usage?</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Larry:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>I haven't measured</li>
<li>I'm sure that not feeding 800 regexes to TRE at once will make it allocate 17 megabytes on the stack</li>
<li>it might still be allocating too much for some of the larger things</li>
<li>I'm still aiming for correct, as opposed to fast</li>
<li>just trying to bear fast in mind</li>
<li>the longest token matcher now returns a linked list of states</li>
<li>not a string</li>
<li>should be a lot faster; easier to cache</li>
<li>functionally it's the same as before</li>
<li>one of those things you don't even have to measure to know it'll be faster</li>
<li>trying to avoid the bugaboo of premature optimization by doing what I know will be efficient to begin with</li>
<li>all the while trying to make the thing work</li>
<li>it has a good chance of being pretty speedy</li>
<li>my talk in Tokyo will be about all of the places where the current grammar allows extensibility</li>
<li>it'd be nice to be able to demonstrate some of that</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Allison:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>getting work done again</li>
<li>launched the Strings PDD</li>
<li>list of tasks for concurrency that I'm breaking down into smaller pieces</li>
<li>may post what I have now, and leave other people to break them down</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Patrick:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>are they parallelizable? :)</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Allison:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>many of them are</li>
<li>there are some bigger things, like switching the exception system over to the event handler</li>
<li>otherwise, just life stuff</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Patrick:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>had paying work come up this past week, so not a lot of actual coding</li>
<li>need to type the milestones document</li>
<li>it's all in my head</li>
<li>managed to remove a lot of unused code thanks to chromatic's post about possible optimizations</li>
<li>mostly just cleanup</li>
<li>but helped me figure out things which will feed into my redesign of PGE for longest token matching</li>
<li>should be able to return to direct Rakduo hacking later this week</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Will:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>various Parrot cleanups</li>
<li>TPF quarterly grant proposals are due at the end of the month</li>
<li>haven't seen anything come in yet</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Allison:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>they're queued in an RT queue</li>
<li>I don't know if grant members have access to that queue</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Will:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>we do</li>
<li>please, get your proposal in now, sooner than later</li>
<li>that goes for you on the call as well as people reading the minutes</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>c:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>mostly spent the past week optimizing Parrot and Rakudo</li>
<li>looks like it's the building speed is twice as fast as when I started</li>
<li>runtime is faster too, but the optimization is compilation time</li>
<li>found some infelicities that need more design thought</li>
<li>but I'm happy to put these improvements in now and take them out later when the design improves around them</li>
<li>hope to start adding new features again soon</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Patrick:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>most of the test execution time is in compilation</li>
<li>how useful would it be to compile Rakudo to standalone PIR?</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>c:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>I'd find it useful</li>
<li>but I'd find about ten things useful with all I work on</li>
<li>so not a blocker at the moment</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Jesse:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>how far will that get you toward native executables?</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Patrick:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>the existing trick for building <em>perl6</em> would work</li>
<li>but it's not the same</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>c:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>if it takes an hour or two, it would help me with debugging and profiling</li>
<li>if it takes more time, it's not that important</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Patrick:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>we have to figure out runtime deployment issues for the Perl 6 runtime library</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Will:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>we could add the requirement to run from <em>languages/perl6/</em> right now</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>c:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>that's fine by me for now</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Patrick:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>that's an afternoon job, not too bad</li>
<li>what do we need to do to get the Perl 6 and Parrot pages up to date?</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Will:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>I'll work on that</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Nicholas:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>why is C99 useful to Parrot and the compiler tools?</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>c:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>front-end parsing for C header files to build NCI declarations automatically</li>
<li>the backend is pretty easy, that's thunk generation</li>
<li>the front-end keeps people from having to write boilerplate code by hand</li>
<li>generate the front-end once, where you have the headers, and then you can run the generated code anywhere even if you don't have the headers</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Jesse:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>how does that compare to Python's ctypes?</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>c:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>as I understand it, they have the nice backend stuff</li>
<li>not so sure about the front-end</li>
<li>my P5NCI is nicer, if incomplete</li>
<li>just haven't had time to work on it...</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Jesse:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>if you put in for a TPF grant, that would be very useful</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>c:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>get me a clone first, and you have a deal</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Jerry:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>Allison, we talked about implementing <code>return</code> </li>
<li>that requires tying in exceptions to the concurrency scheduler?</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Allison:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>yes</li>
<li>just not implemented yet</li>
<li>when we did exceptions, we didn't have concurrency</li>
<li>so it's on the top of my list to tie them together</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Will:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>Tcl's already using exceptions to handle <code>return</code>, <code>break</code>, and <code>continue</code> </li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Allison:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>right now, you can't have an exception handler which is a full subroutine</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Patrick:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>I'm not sure we need one for that feature</li>
<li>every subroutine block decorated as such in PAST puts an exception handler in the block</li>
<li>if any nested block throws a <code>return</code> type exception, it grabs the arguments, does what it has to, and then does a Parrot return</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Allison:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>if that's what you need, go ahead and do it</li>
<li>I thought there are some features you didn't have yet</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Patrick:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>I thought there might be some opcodes I needed, like <code>handled</code> </li>
<li>but we can do something now</li>
<li>might not be completely optimal</li>
<li>but it's just packaging things up now</li>
<li>I have something I think will work</li>
<li>it's not trivial, but I'm 80% confident</li>
<li>just a matter of sitting down and doing it</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Allison:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>the concurrency stuff will be there before the next release</li>
<li>might not want to roll it in before the release</li>
<li>but it'll be there soon</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Patrick:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>I want to get <code>return</code> in for the April 15 milestone we're behind on</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Jerry:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>have you put in tickets for the breakdown of specific tasks?</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Allison:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>I've never done tickets for that</li>
<li>just sent mail to the list of the tasks</li>
<li>handed them out to people as they volunteered</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>c:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>can you put them on a wiki page?</li>
<li>some of the other committers wanted that</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Allison:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>I can do that</li>
</ul></p>
