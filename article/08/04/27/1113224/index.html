<p>We're organising another Perl Mongers census this year. The last one was in <a href="http://www.pm.org/census/2005/">2005</a> so it's about time. In the next few weeks all Perl Mongers group leaders will receive an email asking them to fill in a census return for their group.

<p>The email will be sent to the group leaders using the email address we have in the <a href="http://www.pm.org/groups/">PM group directory</a>. And that's why I'm giving this advance notice. If you're in a Perl Monger group then please check that the contact details we have for your group are correct. If anything needs to be amended then please ask your group leader to get in touch with us to fix it.</p></p>

<h2>get in touch how?</h2>

Whom should we contact if our listed email address is wrong?

<h2>Re:get in touch how?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/davorg/">davorg</a> on 2008-04-28T05:20:15</h3>
The standard Perl Monger support address - support [at] pm.org.

<h2>Why group leaders only?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/drhyde/">drhyde</a> on 2008-04-28T14:59:24</h3>
It would be interesting to see if there's any significant discrepancy between what group leaders say and what ordinary group members say.  This will largely come about because of people being double-counted.  eg, when you ask how big a group is, I'll be counted by several group leaders - off the top of my head, I'm on the London, Leeds, NY and Boston lists.  I expect that *everyone* on the Leeds mailing list is on at least one other.

<p>This census is based around Perl Monger groups, which is why we'll only be asking group leaders for data. The view from the membership was pretty much covered by last year's <a href="http://perlsurvey.org/" title="perlsurvey.org">Perl survey</a perlsurvey.org>. In fact I see that Jason Porrit has already published <a href="http://www.jasonporritt.com/perl-survey-results-us-perl-mongers/" title="jasonporritt.com">some interesting analysis</a jasonporritt.com> of the data which concentrates on Perl Monger membership (albeit US-only for some reason).</p>

<p>Of course, if anyone has any ideas on how to run a better Perl census, then we'd love to have your suggestions (and your help in implementing them!)</p>
