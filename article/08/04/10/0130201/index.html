<p><a href="http://www.phoenixtrap.com/">Accidental Angel</a> writes <i>"Google recently launched a preview release of <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/">App Engine</a>, an environment for building web applications using Google's infrastructure.  Currently Python is the only server-side language supported, though they have stated that they look forward to supporting more languages.  To that end, I've added an <a href="http://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/issues/detail?id=34">issue requesting Perl support</a> to the GAE issue tracker.

<h2>It's not</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/acme/">acme</a> on 2008-04-10T07:49:36</h3>
It's not a popularity contest. Only do this once you've <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/downloads.html" title="google.com">downloaded   the SDK</a google.com>, <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/gettingstarted/" title="google.com">run through the tutorial</a google.com> and then think that it would be nicer to do it in Perl. Note that it'd probably be Perl without any modules that use XS...

Well, it's not about making Perl more popular, it's about using the language and modules you already known or care to learn more about.
<br> <br>
I am sure Python is good enough, for GAE, Google engineers, I am sure, are smart and made a good choice.
<br> <br>
But I would still rather use the language where I made the most investement.

Actually, it sort of is a popularity contest.  See <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/google-appengine/msg/8c7fc8b54c587923" title="google.com">this post</a google.com> on the App Engine group, where a Google rep asks people to star the appropriate issue in their tracker rather that post in the group.<br/><br/>I would not have added the issue nor asked people here to star it if Google hadn't said that was the appropriate means of feedback.

<p><div class="quote">Please enter your feedback on the next language/framework to implement on our issue   tracker. If there's already one for the language you want, <b>star it</b>, don't duplicate it.</div> And lo, we star it.  Perl advocacy and all that.  The popular implementation requests stand a better chance of, well, implementation I would think.

<h2>Seems Like a Tough Job</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/samtregar/">samtregar</a> on 2008-04-10T20:23:03</h3>
Is Safe.pm up to the task?  Google will need something like that to accomplish something similar to the restrictions they've put on Python code.  How many CPAN modules will work in a tightly locked-down Safe compartment?

Got a msg from google:
Comment #419:
Star this issue if you're interested in showing your support and tracking it. Don't
