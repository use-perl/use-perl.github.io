<p><p>As part of my, very behind schedule, project to rebuild Test::Builder I also want to rebuild the Test::Builder community.  Test::Builder and Test::More have never really had a home of their own, discussion either living in my inbox, on RT, or padding out the post count on perl-qa.  The repository was never really all that open, even though a lot of people have commit bits they tend to get lost and forgotten.</p><p>I've moved the project off my personal box and onto <a href="http://test-more.googlecode.com/">Google Code</a> which allows repository access to be much more easily managed.  I've also set up a <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/test-more-users">Use and Development mailing list</a> so people can discuss Test::More without cluttering up/without being cluttered by perl-qa.  There's also a <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/test-commits">commit list</a> so people can easily see work being done.  Finally, we're trying out the Google <a href="http://code.google.com/p/test-more/issues/list">issue tracker</a> to see how it compares with RT.</p></p>

<p>I was amazed not to see any comments on this. So here goes - good work!</p><p>I am considering trying out Google Code myself, for on of my CPAN modules, since it seems like a sensible resource to use.</p><p>Nice to see Test::Builder following the good trends of structured opening utilizing publically available repositories.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p><p>I have the odd minor grumble, but I'm happy with Google Code so far.  Does What It Says On The Tin.</p><p>I poked at <a href="http://launchpad.net/" title="launchpad.net">Launchpad</a launchpad.net>, but didn't want the extra complexity of learning Bazaar and converting my SVN repo.  I might give it a shot with another project.</p>

<p>A bunch of us are already on Github, and since you&#8217;re on p5p you&#8217;ll be learning git anyway if you haven&#8217;t already. Just saying.<nobr> <wbr></nobr><tt>;-)</tt> Github has a ton of neat features, including a social network component that&#8217;s actually useful.</p>

<p>My immediate reaction to Github is "where's the rest?"  I go to, say, the <a href="http://github.com/rails/rails/tree/master" title="github.com">Rails project</a github.com> and get a pretty repository page.  There's tabs for lots more repository info, and a wiki, and I like the little developer pictures... but how do I report a bug?  Where do I download a release?  Where's the mailing list?  Where's the "hi, this is what this project is all about"?  I understand there's some sort of Lighthouse and Campfire "integration" but it doesn't look very integrated.</p><p>A little bit too repository-centric for my taste.  For me, the repository is the easy part.  I want someone to do all the rest.</p>
