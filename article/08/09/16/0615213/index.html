<p>The Perl 6 design team met by phone on 20 August 2008.  Larry, Allison, Patrick, Jerry, and Jesse attended.</p>
<p><p> <strong>Larry:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>decommuting from Copenhagen</li><li>couple of tiring days wandering city</li><li>mostly hacking on <em>STD.pm</em> grammar to speed it up a bit</li><li>mostly propagating ratchet optimization around</li><li>compiles itself in under 90 secs</li><li>it's an improvement</li><li>also working on adding rudimentary symbol table checking</li><li>can figure out where it's misparsing things as function calls</li><li>getting ready for trip to Japan next week</li><li>lightweight languages conference, for some definition of "lightweight"</li></ul><p> <strong>Patrick:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>returning home from Copenhagen, which was quite productive</li><li>on the plane ride I implemented pieces for precompiled modules in Rakudo</li><li>finished that up last night, so now Rakudo can use precompiled modules</li><li> <code>spectest_regression</code> on my box went from 12 minutes to under 4 minutes</li><li>it also means that use statement can start doing <code>load_bytecode</code> things</li><li>today been working on lazy lists with jonathan</li><li>much of my time in the next couple of days will be writing reports and blog posts, catching up on events at OSCON and YAPC::EU</li><li>also, at YAPC::EU hackathon Jesse and I put in some refactoring on Rakudo's <em>ROADMAP</em>, identifying task dependencies and some relative effort required</li></ul><p> <strong>Jerry:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>GSOC update; mentors reviewing and submitting final reports</li><li>looks very good that all three are completing</li><li>very successful SOC</li><li>we have good NCI stubs for Parrot, no longer need to write function signatures for things in C header files</li><li>have 700 new tests added by Adrian for Perl 6 spectests</li><li>have mostly complete GC implementation (some debugging needed)</li></ul><p> <strong>Jesse:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>the recent blog post sounded a little "unhappy" with outcome</li></ul><p> <strong>Jerry:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>yes, that the student's self-perspective</li><li>however, it's design-wise complete, just not debugged fully</li></ul><p> <strong>Allison:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>we didn't expect total rewrite of GC system</li><li>we can do the GC integration with Parrot</li><li>he did what we needed him to do, indeed he went much farther than I expected</li></ul><p> <strong>Patrick:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>chromatic also mentioned that things are farther along than intimated</li><li>just need a bit more debugging before we can pull it back into trunk</li><li>didn't want to potentially block others' progress</li></ul><p> <strong>Jerry:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>trying to catch up on work done at YAPC::EU</li><li>much didn't happen online</li><li>missed out on some good conversations</li><li>today discussed exportation in Parrot on IRC with Patrick</li></ul><p> <strong>Jesse:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>getting way too little sleep at YAPC</li><li>very nice conversations with Patrick</li><li>developed <em>ROADMAP</em>, put estimates of relative effort on them</li><li>there's a lot less left to do than I would've estimated</li><li>I also talked to Jonathan about what he'll be up to after his current grants expire</li></ul><p> <strong>Allison:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>reverse commute from Copenhagen</li><li>diving right into mmd branch, have tasklist</li><li>Andrew and smash very helpful</li><li>finished parsing of multi declarations</li><li>build multi-dispatch table from C declarations</li><li>then deprecate a bunch of C code to get to a single mmd impl</li><li>roll that branch back into trunk</li><li>should finish MMD milestone this week or next</li><li>then it's onto IO implementation</li></ul><p> <strong>Jesse:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>Perl 6 IO specification was flagged in Saturday's discussions</li><li>Where does that belong?</li></ul><p> <strong>Larry:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>I've looked at it a few times, it's certainly not complete</li><li>"It's just a library issue!"</li><li>it needs some TLC</li></ul><p> <strong>Jesse:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>Are there others worth harassing for proto-TLC?</li></ul><p> <strong>Larry:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>where IO interacts with concurrency I tend to sweep under the carpet</li><li>I tend to not stress about it</li><li>let's do one step better than P5 and not worry about it</li></ul><p> <strong>Patrick:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>I also think that as long as we can soon provide an implementation that can do basic file I/O and sockets, then people can explore and play in the design space</li></ul><p> <strong>Larry:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>as long as it's properly OO to begin with, there's lots of room to play</li></ul><p> <strong>Allison:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>Parrot's IO model is becoming much more OO, yes</li></ul><p> <strong>Jesse:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>could Rakudo take care of providing an OO interface to Parrot's IO?</li></ul><p> <strong>Allison:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>independent of Rakudo, Parrot IO needs to be OO</li><li>the old design seems to be "reinventing multiple systems to do the same thing"</li><li>also wanted to mention volunteers working on test.parrot.org</li><li>moving pages over to new parrot.org domain</li><li>as soon as pages are moved over, we just need security certificate</li></ul></p>
