<p>The Perl 6 design team met by phone on 30 July 2008.  Allison, Jerry, Will,
Jesse, and chromatic attended.</p>
<p><p> <strong>Allison:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>OSCON was a success</li><li>now I'm completely free from all responsibilities until at least December</li><li>launched the PIR PDD</li><li>now working on the last few failing language tests before I merge back the concurrency branch</li><li>also spent some time talking to PhD advisors at Cambridge this week</li><li>might start fall 2009, if I can get funding and such</li><li>leaving for London on Saturday</li><li>speaking at the BBC on Tuesday</li><li>may miss next week's meetings</li></ul><p> <strong>c:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>was very busy with OSCON</li><li>trying to apply a few patches</li><li>trying to get other people to the place where they can help with that</li><li>mostly I need tasks I can do in 30 minutes when I can grab an hour or two</li><li>fixed some small stuff at the hackathon</li></ul><p> <strong>Allison:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>I need to split up the MMD PDD into bite-sized tasks</li></ul><p> <strong>Jerry:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>OSCON was fabulous</li><li>our talk was successful</li><li>good feedback and enthusiasm</li><li>the lighting talks with Jeff were successful</li><li>most of my hacking was on mod_parrot</li><li>trying to refactor its configure system into something more robust and portable</li><li>it's just about working in the same state it was before</li><li>hope to reach that point this afternoon</li><li>met with some folks at Microsoft's open source lab on Monday</li><li>promising beginning to a relationship between them and the Parrot Foundation</li><li>the hackathon was productive as well</li></ul><p> <strong>Jesse:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>I talked to some Sun people about what makes CPAN tick</li></ul><p> <strong>Will:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>mostly absent the past couple of weeks</li><li>trying to resurrect Tcl, which was untouched for some time</li><li>making progress there on spec tests</li><li>identifying what's left to do</li></ul><p> <strong>c:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>what's our roadmap look like for the rest of the year?</li></ul><p> <strong>Jesse:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>I asked Patrick about that</li><li>he said there's a good chance to get that from the hackathon</li><li>if not, he said I could get his attention at YAPC and get his milestones to break down soon</li></ul><p> <strong>Jerry:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>he spoke on IRC about that today</li><li>he wants to break it down into better granularity and put dependencies between tasks</li><li>have a feeling it'll happen at YAPC::EU</li><li>Jonathan is keen to get together with Allison and Patrick there to discuss related designs</li></ul><p> <strong>c:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>I've noticed projects in Parrot like Reini's attempt to get installation and loading sorted out</li><li>seems like time to get those sorted out</li></ul><p> <strong>Jerry:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>it's difficult to have willing volunteers and not get them the right guidance</li><li>and to make "eventually" now</li></ul><p> <strong>c:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>thinking we should ask Reini for a list of concerns, needs, and use cases</li><li>then try to make a design that addresses more of those</li></ul><p> <strong>Jerry:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>especially as he's about to leave on a two-week business trip</li><li>sounds like a PDD to me</li></ul><p> <strong>Allison:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>sounds like several</li></ul><p> <strong>Jerry:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>library loading, runtime components</li></ul><p> <strong>c:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>does he have commit access?</li></ul><p> <strong>Jerry:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>we can encourage him to apply</li></ul><p> <strong>c:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>thinking about bindings to Prophet</li><li>probably client-side</li></ul><p> <strong>Jerry:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>we need sockets</li></ul><p> <strong>Will:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>we have experimental sockets</li><li>we need to make tickets or mark up PDDs for unimplemented things</li><li>I did some of that with PDD 19 today</li><li>stuff's deprecated and only exists in the PDD</li><li>just to warn people who are going to write code that docs don't match reality</li></ul><p> <strong>Jerry:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>that merits a CAGE task for reviewing the PDDs</li><li>we could spread that out among many people</li></ul><p> <strong>Will:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>I'll send an email</li></ul><p> <strong>c:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>and post it on parrotblog</li></ul><p> <strong>Will:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>no one reads those</li></ul><p> <strong>c:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>they won't if we don't publish them</li></ul><p> <strong>Jesse:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>I see them posted places like Reddit fairly often</li></ul><p> <strong>Allison:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>probably will roll that into parrot.org eventually</li></ul></p>
