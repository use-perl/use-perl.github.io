<div class="span8">
<p>The Perl 6 design team met by phone on 16 July 2008.  Larry, Allison, Jerry, Will, Jesse, and chromatic attended.</p>
<p><p> <strong>Larry:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>switched my laptop to Ubuntu for various reasons, mostly work</li><li>helped me get a runnable Pugs too</li><li>haven't worked much on the standard grammar</li><li>mostly thinking about refactoring the names</li><li>thinking about various other questions people are asking</li><li>just checked in a revamp of the closure semantics</li><li>a little under the weather too</li></ul><p> <strong>Allison:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>almost entirely absorbed by OSCON this week</li><li>hacking a little bit on the three remaining test failures on the pdd25cx branch</li><li>Patrick gave me some information on the PGE failures</li><li>we'll work on that tonight</li><li>hopefully will merge in the branch finally</li></ul><p> <strong>Jerry:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>haven't done much this week</li><li>will report for Patrick and Jonathan though</li><li>Patrick's working on lexical issues</li><li>he's much closer to understanding how Parrot can handle them</li><li>he's also working with HLL to get it to work within PCT</li><li>then he can make it work within high-level languages itself</li><li>that'll let them use the same named classes as Parrot's base classes (for example, <code>Integer</code>) instead of funky workarounds</li><li>Jonathan added <code>enum</code> support</li><li>fixed a couple of segfaults</li><li>something like 910 new spectests passing between Parrot 0.6.3 and 0.6.4</li><li>that's a great number</li><li>much of it came from the Summer of Code project for the Perl 6 test suite</li><li>Adrian and Moritz have been a big help there</li></ul><p> <strong>Patrick:</strong> (in a followup)</p><p>The primarily reason we want HLL support is to take advantage of HLL type
mapping, so that str register-to-PMC conversion automatically gives me back a
Perl 6 <code>Str</code> object instead of a Parrot <code>String</code> PMC.
Same for <code>int</code> to <code>Int</code>, <code>num</code> to
<code>Num</code>, and <code>ResizablePMCArray</code> to <code>List</code>
conversions.</p><p> <strong>c:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>things are pretty slow</li><li>traveling and haven't had much time</li><li>still working with Andrew on the GC; he's making progress</li><li>helping Allison; we're getting close</li><li>will definitely start the string branch very soon</li><li>maybe we'll merge that back in stages</li><li>waiting for some guidance on the closure issue</li></ul><p> <strong>Will:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>Parrot 0.6.4 came out on Tuesday, thanks to Bernhard</li><li>no major new features, although the NEWS listing has lots of little updates</li><li>hopefully will get the concurrency branch merged by the next release, to make it 0.7</li><li>I hate Subversion</li><li>I wonder when we're going to update RT on perl.org</li><li>and that's it</li></ul><p> <strong>Jesse:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>talked to Richard last week about other interesting funding sources and corporate support for Perl 6</li><li>he's working on that</li><li>general strategizing on that for pushing implementations forward</li><li>sounds like the hackathon is fairly set post-OSCON?</li></ul><p> <strong>Allison:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>yes</li></ul><p> <strong>c:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>do we have a sense of prioritization of features, or is that up to implementors?</li></ul><p> <strong>Jesse:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>it's been up to implementors so far</li><li>every time I've asked, each one has strong feelings about how to prioritize</li></ul><p> <strong>c:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>I mention it just because I believe that giving people something productive to experiment with sooner is very useful for marketing</li></ul><p> <strong>Jesse:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>I've talked to Flavio about this, for example</li><li>wondering if there are subsystems of features that could come before others</li></ul><p> <strong>Jerry:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>what I really want in Rakudo right now is IO so I can use it for work</li><li>it's limited</li><li>you can't do sockets, basically</li><li>that probably won't be fixed until it's fixed in Parrot</li><li>that's Parrot blocking for Rakudo</li><li>as far as other implementations go, there are early features that all implementations share</li><li>I think Larry's said before that the Synopses deliberately don't look ahead too much</li><li>if you do operators before you do objects, that's a way forward</li><li>although parameterized roles are funded work</li><li>and volunteer work</li></ul><p> <strong>Larry:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>I do use those in my work</li></ul><p> <strong>c:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>I don't have a sense of our priorities</li></ul><p> <strong>Larry:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>Perl 6 will be very useful when it does its Perl 5 subset in a way that's better than Perl 5</li><li>that said, there's a danger when Perl 6 gets used in anger by people who start to rely on transient bugs or workarounds for missing features</li><li>there needs to be expectations management</li></ul><p> <strong>Jerry:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>possibly the best way to do that is to say "Only use what passes in the spectest suite"</li></ul><p> <strong>Jesse:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>unless there's a way to disable unstable features outside of devel checkouts</li></ul><p> <strong>Larry:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>but what does it mean that a feature works?</li><li>closure cloning might almost work, but there are some bugs</li><li>we can put a large warning in the documentation that not all features are stable or final yet</li><li>or run into the problem of installing Cabal features to run Pugs</li><li>some packages are under development</li><li>you're lucky if it all works</li><li>it's easy to get an explosion of things that don't all work with each other</li><li>I don't profess to have the right answer</li><li>I don't think there is a right answer</li><li>mostly I think the order of implementation will tend to iron itself out</li><li>everyone has an itch to have the basic stuff working</li><li>everyone has extra itches which may not correspond to other itches</li><li>they're exercising parts of the design that other people aren't exercising</li><li>I want convergence to happen</li></ul><p> <strong>Jerry:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>provided you don't go crazy trying to keep it all in mind</li></ul><p> <strong>Larry:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>there may be a need to name development subset versions</li><li>maybe pre-6.0 isn't a sufficiently rich naming scheme</li><li>at least it's an interesting problem</li></ul><p> <strong>Jesse:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>it would be interesting to find a name for subsets of what will be Perl 6</li><li>the trivial functional subset of Perl 6 that Audrey made in a week was a working subset of Perl 6</li></ul><p> <strong>Larry:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>and it did junctions</li></ul><p> <strong>Jesse:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>I've had multiple implementors prod me about how to name or label these things</li><li>here's a thing we've targeted</li><li>we can talk about it as an entity, even if it's not 6.0.0</li></ul><p> <strong>Larry:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>there's a sense in which the true name is the list of all of the tests it passes</li></ul><p> <strong>Jerry:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>Rakudo has a ROADMAP</li><li>Patrick keeps it updated</li><li>but he had some unanswered questions in that thread</li></ul><p> <strong>Larry:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>there's a long list of things blocking from the Parrot end</li><li>a lot of things are in perpetual redesign</li></ul><p> <strong>Allison:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>I finished the last Parrot design document</li><li>we need resources to implement them</li></ul><p> <strong>Jerry:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>there were a lot of early prototypes that made it 60 - 80% of the way</li><li>a lot of these features are waiting for a final thing</li><li>it's no fun coding HLLs for a moving target</li><li>they want to wait for the final version, rather than rewriting it several times</li></ul><p> <strong>Jesse:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>the Rakudo ROADMAP is just a bullet list</li><li>no subtasks, no estimates of effort</li><li>a list in rough priority order</li><li>it could use a couple of more levels of information</li></ul><p> <strong>Jerry:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>we could make it a hackathon task</li></ul><p> <strong>Jesse:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>I'll only be there for a couple of hours</li></ul><p> <strong>Jerry:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>we could pull in some time earlier in the week</li><li>why don't we call these chunks of features "traits"?</li><li>that's an unused term</li></ul></p>
