<p>The Perl 6 design team met by phone on 11 June 2008. Larry, Allison,
Patrick, Will, and chromatic attended.</p>
<p><p> <strong>Larry:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>did YAPC</li><li>some hackathoning on both ends</li><li>gave a talk at Google Chicago</li><li>specwise, mostly clarifications</li><li>there's a new assertion in regexes in angle-brackets, <code>&lt;...&gt;</code> and friends</li><li>same function as out of regexes: not defined yet</li><li>a bare <code>...</code> would match three characters in a row</li><li>renamed <code>samebase</code> switch to <code>sameaccent</code> </li><li>on the way to YAPC, I hacked in lazy lists, then spent the rest of the time debugging them</li><li>cleaning up the lazy switch languages and the memoization features which look for empty space and ends and such</li><li>no longer depend on single variables</li><li>an array checked by position within the current program</li><li>that array can have multiple memos attached to it</li><li>seems like it will work much better</li><li>the <code>ws_</code> attributes are gone now</li><li>spits out a much cleaner tree</li><li>other than that, just chasing down lots of little bugs</li><li>added a <em>Makefile</em> </li><li>added the ability to write a different grammar and use a different mechanism from STD5</li><li>used to have to put derived grammars into STD5</li><li>don't have to do that anymore</li></ul><p> <strong>Allison:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>YAPC, hackathons</li><li>meeting with people and getting things done</li><li>back to debugging the PDD 25 branch</li><li>haven't been doing as much on as I hoped</li><li>spent the weekend with family though</li><li>looks like chromatic fixed a couple of things there yesterday</li><li>hoping to merge back in this week or next</li><li>that'll give us enough time to make sure it's safe for the next release</li></ul><p> <strong>Will:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>YAPC</li><li>Jim Keenan ran a Perl 6 and Parrot workshop</li><li>a lot of new people showed up and tried to build Parrot and the Rakudo binary</li><li>had a lot of feedback</li><li>had some patches</li><li>hopefully get some repeat contributors from that</li><li>we signed all of the paperwork for the Parrot Foundation last week</li><li>so it's all official now</li><li>no real coding</li><li>taking a look at the branch, trying to make sure Tcl works there</li><li>there are some PGE issues</li></ul><p> <strong>Patrick:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>Rakudo's regression spectests have 73 files, 943 tests passing (increase of 14 files, 238 tests from two weeks ago)</li><li>that's likely understating it</li><li>we haven't removed skip markers from lots of little fixed bugs yet</li><li>I have a tool which tells me what they are</li><li>expect that we'll pass over 1000 tests by this time next week</li><li>about 100 new passing tests every week</li><li>that's a good rate for now</li><li>YAPC was very productive</li><li>the hackathon and workshop were very useful</li><li>I have an impression of a lot more people starting to play with Perl 6</li><li>that may not be to Pugsian levels yet, but a lot more people seem to be coming in and saying "This doesn't quite work"</li><li>spent a lot of time this weekend looking at lexical handling</li><li>looked at the source</li><li>had to look at a lot of IMCC to figure out what's going on</li><li>doing some big refactoring of base classes and things in Rakudo</li><li>adding sanity, will help getting new features to work</li><li>continuing to refactor Rakudo's grammar to look more like the standard grammar</li><li>copying rule names and targets</li><li>eager to look at Larry's memoization changes</li><li>I had similar thoughts</li><li>that'll be good for all of the languages on Parrot</li><li>may be a standard part of the PCT grammar rules</li><li>removed some obsolete rules</li><li>the grammar can now process named zero-arity tokens</li><li>protoregexes and LTM will fix that better</li><li>more improvements to the test suite and the test harness for reporting progress</li><li>patched HLLCompiler to transcode from UTF-8 into fixed 8 when possible</li><li>it'll continue to use UTF-8 if it has to, but it'll take longer to parse</li><li>tired of people saying that Rakudo had trouble with Unicode, even though the problem was in Parrot</li><li>have a draft grant application for the Perl 6 grant, per the grant BOF at YAPC</li><li>Richard can start to move on it</li><li>will give other people an idea of how an application might look</li><li>starting to look at more PGE changes and improvements</li><li>want to add protoregexes and LTM</li><li>also looking at changes in pdd25cx branch</li><li>in particular, the new opcodes (peanut butter and bad beer)</li><li> <code>local_branch</code> and <code>local_branch_return</code> are okay</li><li>I might prefer <code>local_return</code> </li></ul><p> <strong>Allison:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>I figured something longer than three characters might work</li></ul><p> <strong>Patrick:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>there was some talk about people sticking invalid integers in the array</li><li>they think it's exploitable</li></ul><p> <strong>Allison:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>other places which do this check that the target is within the current segment</li></ul><p> <strong>c:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>that's easy enough to do</li></ul><p> <strong>Patrick:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>when I redo PGE, I might not even need these opcodes</li><li>they'll be useful now</li><li>but I don't want to invest too much time in them right now</li><li>the lexicals bug is slowing down Rakudo's progress</li><li>I have plenty to keep me busy</li><li>but fixing some of the underlying features in Rakudo depends on getting lexicals fixed</li><li>I can get some features to work by doing things one way</li><li>other features to work by doing it another way</li><li>but not simultaneously</li></ul><p> <strong>c:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>I can take a look at that</li></ul><p> <strong>Patrick:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>Jonathan said he'd look at that too</li><li>you two can coordinate on that</li></ul><p> <strong>c:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>applying patches</li><li>cleaning up IMCC</li><li>not sure it's worth much time revising it -- needs a lot of work</li><li>I'll spend more time applying patches, cleaning up code</li><li>going to branch for the Strings PDD soon</li><li>NotFound sent in a couple of patches</li><li>also mentoring Andrew and his GC work</li><li>he's mostly debugging now</li><li>I'm going to go through and clean up his code a bit</li><li>likely we can merge it back in soon</li></ul><p> <strong>Patrick:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>there's still a nasty design issue in lexicals and closures</li><li>it'll take me some time to describe it well</li><li>it's when we have a non-closure sub embedded inside a closure</li><li>if we do <code>newclosure</code> on something with an inner scope which does not do C, the pointers are all messed up</li></ul></p>
