<p>The Perl 6 design team met by phone on 09 July 2008.  Larry, Allison, Jesse, Jerry, Patrick, and chromatic attended.<p> <strong>Larry:</strong> </p></p>
<p><ul>
<li>standard grammar parses itself 100%</li><li>thinking about refactoring</li><li>how do we distinguish the use of grammars from grammars used as the current language</li><li>refactoring top level namespaces</li><li>whether STD is part of that name</li><li>meddling in everyone else's discussions</li><li>upgraded the spec on transliteration</li><li>in denial about all of the conferences coming up</li></ul><p> <strong>Allison:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>absorbed by OSCON and travel for the next couple of weeks</li><li>after that, things will pick up</li><li>working on one (hopefully) final patch to the concurrency branch</li><li>I know it'll resolve one failing test</li><li>hope it'll resolve several PGE failures on the branch</li><li>I'm an hour away from committing that (ideal minutes, but probably an actual hour)</li><li>we're talking about having a hackathon the Saturday after OSCON</li></ul><p> <strong>Jesse:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>is there a venue?</li></ul><p> <strong>Allison:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>nothing set up yet, but we do have a default</li></ul><p> <strong>Jesse:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>how many people?</li></ul><p> <strong>Allison:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>probably about ten</li><li>Portland State University worked out pretty well for us</li><li>I'll look for contact information</li></ul><p> <strong>Patrick:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>last week, we passed 1365 tests</li><li>now we're passing 1677, 312 more</li><li>from the last Friday of June to the first Friday of July, we had an increase of 500 tests</li><li>almost 50% more than we were</li></ul><p> <strong>Jesse:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>how many are newly ported tests and how many used to fail?</li></ul><p> <strong>Patrick:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>probably an equal mix of both</li><li>a big part of that is getting implicit lexicals working, <code>$_</code>, <code>$!</code>, and <code>$/</code> </li><li>implicit method calls too are working now</li><li>lots of refactoring, especially for builtins</li><li>they now seem to work better in the <code>Any</code> class</li><li>removed a lot of inline PIR code and stuff like that</li><li>spent an hour on the phone with the Houston Perl Mongers last night</li><li>they want to work on the test suite as part of their meetings for a while</li><li>I walked them through building Rakudo, checking out the Pugs repo and test suite, explaining how we do testing</li><li>they plan to have meetings where someone gives a topic, presents how they think it should work, and then they review or create tests for that feature</li><li>they'll either move tests from Pugs into spectests, or add tests to spectests</li><li>I'll try to write that into an article for use Perl or other places</li><li>a step by step guide for contributing tests</li><li>haven't started writing my "This Week in Perl 6 Articles" yet</li><li>should have one by this time next week</li></ul><p> <strong>Jerry:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>haven't been able to produce much code</li><li>participating in code reviews and design discussions</li><li>this is the mid-term evaluation period for Google Summer of Code</li><li>all of the mentors and students have submitted their mid-term evaluations</li><li>it's all gone smoothly</li><li>all three are going ahead</li><li>the Parrot Foundation is in process of taking over the NLNet grant from TPF</li><li>working with the OSU open source labs to host the website</li><li>expect more on that soon</li></ul><p> <strong>Allison:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>because we need SSL certificates, they were going to set us up with our own virtual machine</li><li>we'll need to purchase the certificate</li></ul><p> <strong>Jerry:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>and finalize the purchase of parrot.org</li></ul><p> <strong>c:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>applied some patches, fixed a couple of bugs</li><li>closed some tickets, but a lot more came in</li><li>worked with Andrew some on fixing bugs in his GC</li><li>getting closer to the point of merge</li><li>approved his milestone, setting some priorities for the second half of the work</li><li>probably won't have much time to work in the next week</li><li>thinking about Closures, not sure Parrot's approach is entirely right</li></ul><p> <strong>Patrick:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>did you see my note about the PGE bugs in the branch?</li><li>I ran PGE in the concurrency branch yesterday, and get an odd result</li><li>if you run it by using prove, it gives errors</li><li>if you run the PIR directly, it works just fine</li></ul><p> <strong>c:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>I don't think <code>Parrot::Test</code> adds any flags when it invokes Parrot</li><li>but <em>t/harness</em> does</li></ul><p> <strong>Patrick:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>it's in the operator precedence parser</li><li>you can specify a particular stop token</li><li>nothing uses that anywhere anymore, but the test tests it</li><li>I don't think anything that uses it</li></ul><p> <strong>Allison:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>does it throw an exception?</li></ul><p> <strong>Patrick:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>it just stops parsing at that point</li><li>the caller decides what to do</li><li>it's not detecting that token when it's parsing</li><li>I pass a string with a stop token in the middle</li><li>it's supposed to parse only the first part</li><li>but it doesn't stop at the stop token</li><li>it's just a simple comparison of some sort</li><li>seems kinda weird</li></ul><p> <strong>Allison:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>maybe it is detecting it, but isn't working right</li><li>but if you're not using exceptions, there's no old exception handler lying around</li><li>so it's not that</li></ul><p> <strong>Patrick:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>I gave instructions on how to reproduce in my message</li></ul><p> <strong>Allison:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>my current patch probably won't fix that</li><li>it sounds unrelated</li></ul><p> <strong>Patrick:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>I might put some tracing in and run it through the harness</li><li>figure out why it's failing to detect that stop token</li><li>also a question for Larry</li><li>do we have an official leaning on method fallback?</li><li>are they in or out?</li></ul><p> <strong>Larry:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>assume they're out for now</li></ul><p> <strong>Patrick:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>I'm happy</li><li>I don't have to rewrite my dispatcher</li><li>can I start telling people to organize the test suite that way?</li></ul><p> <strong>Larry:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>sure</li></ul><p> <strong>Patrick:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>for the <code>eval</code> built-in, can someone take <code>String.eval</code> and have it do what you expect?</li></ul><p> <strong>Larry:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>yes</li></ul><p> <strong>Patrick:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>a method that's exported</li><li>great!</li></ul><p> <strong>Jerry:</strong> </p><ul>
<li> <em>STD.pm</em> parses itself</li><li>that's fantastic</li><li>is the LTM implementable now in Rakudo or elsewhere?</li></ul><p> <strong>Larry:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>essentially</li></ul><p> <strong>Jerry:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>is anything blocking that?</li></ul><p> <strong>Patrick:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>just time</li><li>but I plan to develop that under the grant</li><li>I think it'll  be a significant chunk of code and research</li><li>don't want to do a bunch of PGE refactoring until the concurrency branch is back in trunk though</li></ul><p> <strong>Jerry:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>I want to get that merged as soon as possible</li><li>it won't make a lot of progress until we do</li><li>hope we can get it before OSCON, even though Allison will be busy</li></ul><p> <strong>Allison:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>there are only three failing tests</li></ul><p> <strong>Jerry:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>but HLLs don't work</li></ul><p> <strong>Patrick:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>I don't want to go into OSCON without languages working on trunk</li></ul><p> <strong>Larry:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>maybe a reverse merge?</li></ul><p> <strong>Allison:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>we do that regularly</li></ul><p> <strong>c:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>I just don't want to block everyone from doing anything until the code gets fixed</li></ul><p> <strong>Patrick:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>just about everyone who can fix it is on this call</li></ul><p> <strong>Allison:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>we're almost to the point where it's time for HLL implementors to work on it</li></ul><p> <strong>c:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>seems like we can pick the top three HLLs that need to work (Rakudo, Pheme, Punie)</li><li>make them pass</li><li>give the other HLL implementors a week to fix their stuff</li><li>then do the merge</li></ul><p> <strong>Patrick:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>just don't want to show off all of this nice stuff at OSCON, then say "Don't download trunk, it doesn't work"</li><li>but show off the new stuff in Rakudo that's not in the new release</li><li>a week makes a big difference, the way things are moving</li></ul><p> <strong>c:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>that could be 500 tests</li></ul><p> <strong>Patrick:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>thanks to Larry for jumping in on the design discussions</li><li>hope you're not frustrated</li></ul><p> <strong>Larry:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>it's all part of the job</li><li>I'd rather see progress than vice versa</li></ul></p>
