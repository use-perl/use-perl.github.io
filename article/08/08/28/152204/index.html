<p>The Perl 6 design team met by phone on 02 July 2008.  Allison, Will, Jerry, Patrick, and chromatic attended.</p>
<p><strong>Allison:</strong> <ul>
<li>still working on the pdd25cx branch</li><li>taking way too long  five remaining test files</li><li>I'm going to have zero tolerance for failing tests, even on a branch</li><li>I broke my natural tendency for that and it's biting me</li><li>I'll be traveling a lot for the next couple of weeks</li><li>hope to get one or two tests passing tomorrow</li><li>two of the failures are PGE, which probably means that no language built on PGE works now, depending on where the test failures apply</li></ul><p> <strong>Will:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>Tcl still fails a ton of tests on the branch now</li><li>that's not far off the mark</li></ul><p> <strong>Jerry:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>do you know the root causes?</li></ul><p> <strong>Allison:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>not in PGE</li><li>but the one I'm working on now is a fundamental problem</li><li>exception handlers used to be scoped</li><li>I shifted them over to global in the first stage</li><li>now I'm shifting them over to the context, so they'll behave like the old system</li><li>the old system used a global stack, which worked badly with CPS</li><li>I hope that this change will fix a bunch of the PGE tests</li></ul><p> <strong>Jerry:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>Summer of Code is progressing nicely</li><li>we're coming up on midterms now</li><li>everyone seems right on track for the Perl 6 and Parrot projects</li><li>the students are all engaged in their work and the community</li><li>I have high hopes that they'll continue to be around after the summer</li><li>Patrick and I need to coordinate our OSCON talk</li><li>have only had time for administration and question answering</li><li>don't know what my availability will be after next week, but I'll do my best</li></ul><p> <strong>Patrick:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>this year's Summer of Code is far more productive than previous years, from the Perl 6 and Parrot perspective</li><li>the work that they've done will stick around</li><li>it's really, really helping out</li><li>Rakudo now passes 1365 tests out of the spec repository  422 over last week</li><li>increase of 75 over this morning</li><li>probably another 50 or so, after the lexical issue is now resolved</li><li>I can fix <code>$_</code> and implicit method calls</li><li>I think that there are a lot of tests that use those; keep noticing some that aren't passing</li><li>it's been a banner week for adding new tests passes</li><li>some of it is improvements in Rakudo</li><li>moritz and auzon are also doing a great job in refactoring the tests, and making sure Rakudo passes them</li><li>every so often they find a Rakudo bug, we patch it, and we have more passing tests</li><li>Jonathan and chromatic managed to fix lexical handling over the past week</li><li>that removes a big blocker for me</li><li>I cleaned up part of PCT</li><li>about to clean up part of Rakudo</li><li>we should get better code generation out of that</li><li>plan to refactor the builtins to become part of the <code>Any</code> class</li><li>will fix <code>$_</code>, <code>$!</code>, and <code>$/</code> to work correctly</li><li>will refactor parameter passing and handling</li><li>wrote my third progress report for the Mozilla grant</li><li>the final report will come out around the time of OSCON</li></ul><p> <strong>c:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>fixed some bugs</li><li>trying to remove as many blockers for Rakudo and other Parrot languages</li><li>continuing to work with Andrew to make sure his new GC branch compiles and runs and passes all tests</li></ul><p> <strong>Jerry:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>he's at 700 failures out of 7700 now right?</li></ul><p> <strong>c:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>it didn't even compile a few nights ago</li><li>so he's making good progress</li></ul><p> <strong>Will:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>trying to rip out old stuff from Parrot</li><li>added a :deprecated flag for ops</li><li>if you run Parrot with warnings, it'll warn in almost every program</li><li>started a branch to remove built-in method handling</li><li>magical non-ops dispatch to class methods on PMCs</li><li>we're trying to get rid of the old object system</li><li>the only one we're really using right now is <code>say</code> anyway</li><li>we don't have to worry about having too many opcodes right now anyway</li><li>removed a lot of custom code for our Perl::Critic configuration</li><li>increased our dependencies, decreased custom code</li><li>fixed a bug for subclassing <code>Float</code> </li><li>we have a whole class of bugs where when you subclass a PMC, the PMC assumes you have the same C type</li><li>we need someone to do a review on all of that</li><li>the RT #48014 is a good place to comment on how to migrate from using the PMC union to PMC attributes</li></ul><p> <strong>Allison:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>are we doing any hackathoning after OSCON?</li></ul><p> <strong>Patrick:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>I have Saturday open, so we can do that</li></ul><p> <strong>Jerry:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>I can do that too</li></ul><p> <strong>Allison:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>Larry left Saturday and Sunday open</li></ul><p> <strong>Patrick:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>I can move my flight; I have a place to stay on Saturday night too</li></ul><p> <strong>Allison:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>if it's just you and Larry, that might be valuable too</li><li>that's five or six of us</li><li>where's a good location?</li></ul><p> <strong>Patrick:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>it depends on who's coming</li><li>will Damian make it?</li><li>there could easy be six or seven of us</li></ul><p> <strong>Allison:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>I'll look into spaces</li><li>let's say Saturday for sure, but Sunday is possible</li></ul><p> <strong>c:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>and Friday afternoon and evening</li></ul><p> <strong>Jerry:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>I'm meeting with Hank at Microsoft's open source labs</li><li>he's offered some resources, right?</li></ul><p> <strong>Allison:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>smoke testing</li><li>some Windows licenses</li></ul><p> <strong>Jerry:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>now that we're very close to having Smolder work</li><li>(today or tomorrow)</li><li>just requires an upgrade to TAP::Harness 3</li><li>we could make this happen</li><li>I'll basically follow up and make things happen</li></ul><p> <strong>Allison:</strong> </p><ul>
<li>they want something automatable, so they don't have to think about it</li><li>it'll update once a week or whenever, run the tests, and submit a report</li></ul></p>
