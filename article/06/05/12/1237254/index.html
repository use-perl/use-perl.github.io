<p>
<h2> <a name="the_win32_wince_leveraged_buyout_merger">The Win32/Wince leveraged buy-out merger</a> </h2>
</p> <p>Vadim reminded the patch-meisters, (and clearly the man has been
revising his classics) to apply the large Win32 patch that
Yves Orton had posted, so that they could continue the process.</p>
<pre>
  Smelly socks!
  <a href="http://xrl.us/mekd">http://xrl.us/mekd</a> </pre>
<p>Which must have been applied, for a little while later Vadim posted
further tweaks to the Wince side of things.</p>
<pre>
  One less source file!
  <a href="http://xrl.us/meke">http://xrl.us/meke</a> </pre>

<h2> <a name="state_variables_featured_in_blead"> <code>state</code> variables featured in <code>blead</code> </a> </h2>
</p> <p>Rafael Garcia-Suarez ironed out some of the bigger show-stoppers
in his state variable work, and was thus able to commit the first
draft to <code>blead</code>. Arrays and hashes aren't done yet, but as of
now, we have an elegant solution to the perennial <code>my $var if 0</code>
problem.</p>
<p>Nicholas Clark was impressed, and tried out a snippet of code, that Rafael
turned into a test for a brand new <em>t/op/state.pl</em>.</p>
<pre>

<h2> <a name="is_socketpair_available_everywhere">Is <code>socketpair</code> available everywhere?</a> </h2>
</p> <p>Jan Dubois was looking at the section in <code>perlport</code> where it says that
<code>socketpair</code> is not available on Win32 and a number of other platforms.
He thought that it was currently emulated on all platforms that did not
provide a native implementation. If so, it would mean that the section
could be quietly dropped.</p>
<p>Alex Waugh mentioned that it's available natively on RISC OS, so if
nothing else, that could be removed from the list.</p>
<pre>
  Going native
  <a href="http://xrl.us/mekh">http://xrl.us/mekh</a> </pre>
<p>
<h2> <a name="support_for_insideout_classes">Support for inside-out classes</a> </h2>
</p> <p>Anno Siegel delivered a two part patch to improve the implementation of
inside-out classes. Part one deals with perl itself, and the second part
reaches out into the core library and expands <code>Hash::Util</code>. Anno also
provided a demo to show how it worked.</p>
<p>Yves Orton was quite enthusiastic, Randy W. Sims, markedly less. David
Golden had a close look at the patch and explained clearly what he
thought was going on, and pointed out some issues where the implementation
was a bit rough around the edges.</p>
<p>Yuval Kogman thought the patch was maybe not general enough, and
suggested some avenues to explore, other than just Inside-Out
objects. David Golden and Abigail discussed issues such as
backwards compatibility at length.</p>
<p>Rafael announced that he was happy with the intent of the patch.
Nicholas Clark caught an error that Anno set about correcting.</p>
<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/meki">http://xrl.us/meki</a> </pre>
<p>Obligingly, Anno summarised where he was going from here with the
patch. In the end he retired the patch and set about doing something
better.</p>

<h2> <a name="hashing_algorithms">Hashing algorithms</a> </h2>
</p> <p>Jarkko Hietaniemi was looking at hash functions, and stumbled across a
page full of them. Perl uses the "One-at-a-Time" algorithm. Except that
we don't, although the comments say we do. Except, if you have enough
coffee and look again, we really do.</p>
<p>Yves Orton benchmarked a series of hashing algorithms to see what
they did for perl. At a first glance, it looked like "One-at-a-Time"
was rather slow, especially in comparison to another hashing function
named (surprise!) <code>SuperFastHash</code>.</p>
<p>Much of the improvement is dependent on the length of the hash keys.
Short keys show little difference, long keys can show spectacular
improvements.</p>
<p>Michael Schroeder weighed in with Buzhash, which, at the expense of
a table of 256 <code>int</code>s, boils down to a rotate and xor per character.</p>
<pre>
  Total Hash Controversy
  <a href="http://xrl.us/mekk">http://xrl.us/mekk</a> </pre>
<p>
<h2> <a name="don_t_kill_select__select_output_handle________1__0__">Don't kill <code>select((select(OUTPUT_HANDLE), $| = 1)[0])</code> </a> </h2>
</p> <p>Abigail made an impassioned plea to keep this tricky construct in
the documentation. The main point being that it would be of use to
maintenance programmers, not necessarily for people starting out.
A few people argued the issue back and forth, and Abigail maintained
that a three line snippet would be preferable, since people
could pick it apart and thus learn more easily about the particular
parts they are unsure of.</p>

</p> <p>
<h2> <a name="threads_patches">threads patches</a> </h2>
</p> <p>Jerry D. Hedden sent in a new version of a patch to threads, this
time with much less drastic whitespace reformatting. This time
around it was applied.</p>
<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/mekn">http://xrl.us/mekn</a> </pre>
<p>... and another to add stack size support, which was the main
reason why Jerry started to work on all of this in the first
place. Applied as well.</p>
<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/meko">http://xrl.us/meko</a> </pre>
<p>
<h2> <a name="what_andy_lester_did_this_week">What Andy Lester did this week</a> </h2>
</p> <p>Andy Lester forwarded a patch last week to tidy up one-line loops,
specifically, bringing the lone semi colon down to the next line and using
a <code>NOOP</code> macro. Said macro can then be used to squirrel away the various
comments that use secret handshakes to keep source analysis tools happy.</p>
<p>Rafael hated it. Nicholas Clark proposed a semantically equivalent
alternative that met with the Andy seal of approval, and so Andy
went back to refactor using the new approach.</p>
<pre>
  It's overkill of course
  <a href="http://xrl.us/mekp">http://xrl.us/mekp</a> </pre>
<p>He came back after a while with new versions of <em>doio.c</em> and <em>dump.c</em> and
wanted to know what people thought of them. Rafael must have liked it, since
he applied the patch.</p>
<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/mekq">http://xrl.us/mekq</a> </pre>
<p>Along with a nice micro-optimisation for <code>S_find_array_subscript</code>.</p>
<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/mekr">http://xrl.us/mekr</a> </pre>
<p>Andy then thought he could remove a <code>goto</code> in a section of code in <em>op.c</em>,
since the only thing it does is jump over a single <code>if</code> block. The concept
was perhaps sufficiently scary for no-one to dare apply it to see what would
happen.</p>
<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/meks">http://xrl.us/meks</a> </pre>
<p>
<h2> <a name="what_jarkko_hietaniemi_did_this_week">What Jarkko Hietaniemi did this week</a> </h2>
</p> <p>Jarkko tweaked <code>hv.c</code> to use a safer approach to performing the
task of zeroing out memory.</p>
<pre>
  Know your macros
  <a href="http://xrl.us/mekt">http://xrl.us/mekt</a> </pre>
<p>And cast his eyes upon <em>pp_sys.c</em>.</p>
<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/meku">http://xrl.us/meku</a> </pre>
<p>And a tweak to shave some memory off the size of a <code>microperl</code>.</p>
<pre>
  Smaller is better
  <a href="http://xrl.us/mekv">http://xrl.us/mekv</a> </pre>
<p>Jarkko also added some enhancements to the <code>PERL_MEM_LOG</code> infrastructure,
that allows very detailed logging of memory allocations. Jarkko hoped that
someone would feel sufficiently inspired to write some code to munge the
output and produce some pretty pictures to help gather a better understanding
of allocation patterns.</p>
<pre>

<p>
<h2> <a name="various_t_op___tests_are_reviewed">Various <em>t/op/*</em> tests are reviewed</a> </h2>
</p> <p>...by yours truly, and patches applied by Rafael.</p>
<p>Historians may find it of interest that the patch to <em>context.t</em>
was the first ever since its inclusion, following a bug report from
Fran&#231;ois D&#233;sarmenien nearly six years ago.</p>
<pre>

<p>And in other news, your summariser ran into a minor problem of
resource acquisition (not enough semaphores available) to run
a couple of tests in <code>blead</code>'s suite, and set patches to fix
that up as well.</p>

<p>In doing so, another minor problem arose with <code>fold_constants JMPENV_PUSH</code>
panics. Dave Mitchell sorted this out, but you'll have to wait for next week's
exciting episode to find out how (this is due to a severe warp in the space-time
continuum, in that the summary is <em>really</em> late this week).</p>

link in a <code>Perl_*</code> function, because the export list for the linker
had become messed up. Sorted out by Steve Hay and Nicholas Clark.</p>

</p> <p>A recent change to a <em>ext/IO/t/io_unix.t</em> to permit a fall-back to
<em>/tmp</em> if socket creation fails in the current directory causes
grief on AFS file systems. People tried to figure out how to work
around this added twist. Mike Guy wondered it it wouldn't be easier
to figure out first why the socket was failing in the current
directory in the first place, then maybe people wouldn't have to
deal with this new case.</p>

<p>Mohammad Yaseen had some <strong>problems building Perl modules</strong> in non-standard
locations. There was the usual chorus of advice about <code>PREFIX</code> and
<code>PERL5LIB</code> but <strong>the really interesting news</strong> from the thread was that
Randy W. Sims mentioned that Module::Build now (as in 0.28) supports
<code>ExtUtils::MakeMaker</code>'s <code>PREFIX</code> functionality.</p>
<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/memq">http://xrl.us/memq</a> </pre>
<p>Things seemed to be moving along for Mohammad. After having
