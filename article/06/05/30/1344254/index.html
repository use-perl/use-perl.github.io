<p><a href="http://www.birmingham2006.com/">barbie</a> writes <i>"Still planning to propose a Talk, Tutorial, Workshop or Hackathon at YAPC::Europe::2006 in Birmingham? Please note that the deadline is midnight this <strong>Friday, 2nd June 2006</strong> for all submissions. We have had some great submissions so far, but we are still looking for more. Please see the <a href="http://www.birmingham2006.com/cgi-bin/yapc.pl?act=arts-main&amp;name=papers">website</a> for submission details, but please feel free to make as many submissions as you like. Submissions should be sent to <strong>talks at birmingham2006.com</strong>."</i></p>
<p><br> <br>
As mentioned previously, we are looking for a variety of submissions; Talks, these are typically 20/40 minutes presentations, and are the traditional style of talks. The Tutorials are aimed at those who can present presentations with demos for 60/90/180 minutes, and usually cover introductory, intermediate and/or expert levels in stages. The Workshops and Hackathons are the kind of things where there is a project that needs some space away from the main conference to further work on projects and ideas that several may be interested in understanding and getting involved, and can be as long as you feel comfortable with, though something like 30-180 minutes would be ideal.</p>


<hr/>



<h2>Website should be linked from yapc pages</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/mock/">mock</a> on 2006-06-02T07:44:58</h3>
The conference website should really be linked from <a href="http://yapceurope.org/" title="yapceurope.org">http://yapceurope.org/</a yapceurope.org> as currently it is hard to find on any of the "official" perl sites (TPF, yapc.org, etc).
