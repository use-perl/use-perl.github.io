<h2> <a name="the_king_is_dead">The king is dead</a> </h2>
</p> <p>After the 28220th change to the Perforce source repository, Nicholas
Clark announced a snapshot for <code>maint</code>, whose main feature is the
support for relocatable <code>@INC</code> paths. He mentioned that he had
some 1200 patches queued up in his Inbox since October to examine
for suitability for merging into <code>maint</code>. This would take several
weeks, and then a few more weeks of release candidates, and then
5.8.9 would be released.</p>
<p>When that day comes, Nicholas said he would step down as pumpking,
and that Dave Mitchell has volunteered to take over.</p>

<h2> <a name="building_dynaloader_deletes_the_source_tree">Building DynaLoader deletes the source tree</a> </h2>
</p> <p>Joshua ben Jore was rather alarmed to discover that a recent change
caused Dynaloader to delete the source tree in the process of being
built, which puts a definite clamp on trying to test things afterwards.</p>
<p>Dominic Dunlop suspected that something was amiss with Joshua's
source tree, since other smoke reports at the same patch level were
not showing anything out of the ordinary. Andy Dougherty isolated
a couple of suspect passages in the configuration run that deserved
further attention.</p>
<p>Andy's analysis was correct. Joshua found that on Solaris (the
platform in question), <code>Dynaloader</code> builds correctly with no
threads, or with threads and the <code>gcc</code> compiler mentioned explicitly.
Configure a build with threads but let <code>Configure</code> figure out implicitly
that <code>gcc</code> should be used... and making <code>Dynaloader</code> will delete
the source tree. Nice party trick.</p>
<p>Andy then determined the exact chain of events, and offered a course
of action to those of great Configure-fu to stop this from occurring
in the future.</p>
<pre>
  Dynaloader ate my homework
  <a href="http://xrl.us/mra6">http://xrl.us/mra6</a> </pre>
<p>All this made S&#233;bastien Aperghis-Tramoni notice that the
test suite lacks a specific test script for <code>Dynaloader</code>, so
he remedied the situation.</p>
<p>A couple of S&#233;bastien's were marked TODO, since <code>can_ok()</code> seemed
to have a bit of trouble with <code>Autoloader</code>'s autoloaded functions.
chromatic briefly explained how to fix it, but Rafael Garcia-Suarez
wasn't sure whether he thought it was the right way, so chromatic
elaborated on the concept and afterwards Rafael did.</p>
<pre>
  Schwern loses a nickel
  <a href="http://xrl.us/mra7">http://xrl.us/mra7</a> </pre>
<p>chromatic submitted a patch that fixed it all up. Rafael was about
to commit it when he realised that the patch used <code>Scalar::Util</code>'s
<code>blessed()</code> function, but in the context of building the core, it
probably hasn't yet been, or may never be, built. So in the end the
expedient measure of using <code>ref()</code> was used instead.</p>
<pre>
  Easier than rearranging the build
  <a href="http://xrl.us/mra8">http://xrl.us/mra8</a> </pre>
<p>The question of <code>Scalar::Util</code> not being built in turn reminded
Randy W. Sims that he had discovered that the latest version of
Ubuntu linux ships without the XS version of <code>Scalar::Util</code>, which
has the unfortunate side-effect of breaking <code>svk</code>.</p>
<p>Dave Rolsky thought that having an XS version and a pure-Perl version
of the same module but with different feature sets was madness. The
fact that <code>weaken()</code> only comes with the XS version is a pain.</p>

<h2> <a name="the_right_hints_for_configure">The right hints for <code>Configure</code> </a> </h2>
</p> <p>After having mulled over bug #39149, Dominic Dunlop thought that
the message that <code>Configure</code> prints out to explain what hints to
use, was probably a bit confusing. To confuse the summariser,
H.Merijn Brand explained that he had a single <code>Policy.sh</code> file
that he uses an all sorts of platforms, from HP-UX to AIX to
Cygwin.</p>
<p>After a bout of archaeological prospecting, Dominic discovered one
hints file, <code>greenhill.sh</code>, that looks as if it is to be used in
conjunction with another primary hints file, and commented that it
is probably thoroughly unused as well. This caused Andy Dougherty
to reminisce about the old days. He also gave a clear explanation
about the purpose, and usefulness, of hints. They are a hack to
give <code>Configure</code> a sharp poke in the eye to do something quick and
dirty, and this saves you considerable time, since you don't have
to delve into its guts to make it do the right thing in a nice
cross-platform manner.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, a couple of documentation patches made
<code>Configure</code>'s intent clearer.</p>
<pre>

<p>
<h2> <a name="implementing_improvements_to_improve_implementations">Implementing improvements to improve implementations</a> </h2>
</p> <p>Randal L. Schwartz thought he was confused about <code>Attribute::Handlers</code>,
when in fact he was confused by <code>CHECK</code> and <code>INIT</code> blocks not
firing on <code>require</code> statements and said that he thought the
implementation had a couple of holes in its feature matrix.</p>
<p>This lead Nicholas to conclude, and it bears repeating in full here:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I infer that this is because the people/organisations that need the
functionality don't have the time/skills to provide the patch in
house, and the people who do have the skills to create such a patch
don't have the time or the personal need. This seems to be a general
problem with Perl 5 development - there are a lot of firms using
Perl to make money (that's fine - that's the idea) but no effective
way of pooling resources from those firms back into supporting core
development, with the upshot that core development and support is
purely done by volunteers on a "best-effort" basis.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>At least this time there was a bit more of a discussion. TPF got a
mention, and there was a bit of grumbling about how Perl 6 seems
to be grabbing the spotlight even though it's still just a research
project, whereas Perl 5 is here and now, not dead, no, definitely
alive and kicking.</p>
<p>And Merlyn, John Peacock and Joshua ben Jore discussed the problem
of <code>require</code>, <code>CHECK</code> and <code>INIT</code> blocks.</p>

<h2> <a name="documenting___h_and_lexical_pragmas">documenting %^H and lexical pragmas</a> </h2>
</p> <p>Rafael Garcia-Suarez had thought that the <code>%^H</code> section in <code>perlvar</code>
would be a suitable place to deal with documenting the new
user-level lexical pragmata. Nicholas Clark looked at the existing
text and concluded that the best thing to do would be to start again
with a clean slate.</p>
<p>Yitzchak Scott-Thoennes side-stepped the issue, and suggested that
<em>perlpragma.pod</em> would be an even better place to document all this.
Since no-one else came up with anything suitable to get the ball
rolling, Nicholas Clark landed a first cut.</p>

<h2> <a name="perlapio_and_perlio_binmode__"> <code>perlapio</code> and <code>PerlIO_binmode()</code> </a> </h2>
</p> <p>Matthew Byng-Maddick was having trouble marrying the output from a
<code>truss</code>/<code>strace</code>-type program with <code>Devel::DProf</code>. He wanted
to be able to see exactly where system calls were coming from. His
attempts to observe were interfering with what he was trying to
measure.</p>
<p>In the process of trying to get the thing to work in a
reasonable manner he discovered some inconsistencies in the
documentation and asked for advice.</p>

<h2> <a name="perl_perlio_context_layers___and_perlio_apply_layers__"> <code>Perl_PerlIO_context_layers()</code> and <code>PerlIO_apply_layers()</code> </a> </h2>
</p> <p>In other <code>PerlIO</code> news, Yves Orton said that he was having trouble
with building recent <code>blead</code>s, and poked and prodded at the code,
and managed to get it into a reasonably sane state, albeit with
some odd failures in the test suite.</p>
<p>Rafael and Steve Hay twiddled a few dials on the big machine and
eventually all the errors went away.</p>

<h2> <a name="performance_in_regular_expressions">Performance in regular expressions</a> </h2>
</p> <p>H.Merijn Brand said that at the Dutch Perl Workshop, Juerd and he
talked about the fact that <code>/[x]/</code> is not optimised to <code>/x/</code>,
but that sometimes the character class matches faster than the
literal, which seems counter-intuitive.</p>
<p>Yves Orton explained why things were the way they were, and in
this particular case, it was apparently blind luck as much as
anything else. Yves was interested in adding a single character
class to literal conversion in the compiler, since character
classes cause the new trie code to be skipped, and that would
give more patterns a chance to be trie'd.</p>

<p>
<h2> <a name="optimize___x___to__x_">optimize <code>/[x]/</code> to <code>/x/</code> </a> </h2>
</p> <p>So Yves figured out how to get the compiler to do just that and
bundled it up into a shiny patch and tests which were applied by
Dave. The good thing about this is that it appears that there is
now a third person, along with Dave and Hugo van der Sanden, who
can do battle with the C code of the regexp engine... and emerge
victorious.</p>

<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/mrbh">http://xrl.us/mrbh</a> </pre>
<p>Later on, Marcus Holland-Moritz discovered that <code>$Config{startperl}</code>
is wrong if <code>userelocatableinc</code> is undefined. Nicholas was thrilled, as
it meant that all seven people who had downloaded the latest <code>maint</code>
snapshot (see above) had not tested it. But he fixed it anyway.</p>
<p>H.Merijn wondered if it should be included in his smoke configuration.</p>

<p>
<h2> <a name="the_continuing_threads_saga">The continuing threads saga</a> </h2>
</p> <p>David Nicol mapped out a mechanism for linked-list stacks and
queues, in the context of last week's "delivering signals to threads"
thread. This received no discussion, I think because the point
that Dave was trying to make initially was that no one would want
to have to have this sort of machinery in the first place.</p>
<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/mrbj">http://xrl.us/mrbj</a> </pre>
<p>Jerry found time to craft a patch to bring <code>blead</code> up to threads
version 1.28, and this was applied by Rafael.</p>
<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/mrbk">http://xrl.us/mrbk</a> </pre>
<p>Jerry wondered if <strong>threads in <code>BEGIN</code> blocks</strong> were safe to use.
The documentation says <code>&lt;blink&gt;Don't Do That&lt;/blink&gt;</code>,
but apparently it seems to work just fine.</p>
<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/mrbm">http://xrl.us/mrbm</a> </pre>
<p>Jerry then discovered why creating threads in <code>BEGIN</code> leads to
<code>Attempt to free unreferenced scalar</code> warning errors, and suggested
a one-line fix that would solve the problem, but wanted to know
whether this would produce any unwanted side effects, playing around
with reference counting as it does.</p>
<pre>
  Mmmm... dunno
  <a href="http://xrl.us/mrbn">http://xrl.us/mrbn</a> </pre>
<p>Since no one could think of any possible harm that Jerry's suggestion
could cause, he crafted another patch to fix the problem, and Dave
applied it.</p>
<pre>
  Gentlemen, begin your threads
  <a href="http://xrl.us/mrbo">http://xrl.us/mrbo</a> </pre>
<p>Jerry then finished up adding an explicit thread context mechanism,
which Rafael also applied.</p>

<h2> <a name="duallifed_modules_that_give_cpan_grief">Dual-lifed modules that give CPAN grief</a> </h2>
</p> <p>Peter Scott remarked that <strong> <code>Devel::Peek</code>'s version</strong> number was
<strong>higher in core than CPAN</strong>, and that this caused problems when
upgrading CPAN. Nicholas suggested Peter contact Ilya Zakharevich,
the author, directly. Rafael wondered whether it made any sense to
dual-life the module at all, since it tends to be tied quite intimately
with the internals. Peter said that Ilya said that the problem was
with <em>CPAN.pm</em>.</p>
<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/mrbq">http://xrl.us/mrbq</a> </pre>
<p>Peter also found that <code>Data::Dumper</code>, <code>Devel::Dprof</code> and <code>Filter</code>
do not configure themselves correctly, which causes them to be installed
under <code>site_perl</code> instead of the core directories.</p>

<h2> <a name="my_snprintf"> <code>my_snprintf</code> </a> </h2>
</p> <p>Following on from the discussion last week, where Nicholas Clark
opined that it would be good to probe for variadic macro support,
and use them if available, it just so happens that <code>Configure</code>
was tweaked to do just that.</p>
<p>So Jarkko Hietaniemi redid his patch to take this into account and
threw in a number of safety checks at the same time.</p>

<h2> <a name="strange_encodings_upsets_pp_chr">Strange encodings upsets <code>pp_chr</code> </a> </h2>
</p> <p>The subject of this item should be in the past tense, since Sadahiro
Tomoyuki worked on the matter, and sent in a patch to make <code>pp_chr</code>
happy. As a bonus, associated test scripts were made EBCDIC-friendly.
This in turn made Rafael happy.</p>
<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/mrbt">http://xrl.us/mrbt</a> </pre>
<p>
<h2> <a name="sv_pos_b2u_dislikes_the_extended_utf8"> <code>sv_pos_b2u</code> dislikes the extended UTF-8</a> </h2>
</p> <p>Tomoyuki also fixed up <code>sv_pos_b2u_forwards</code> to behave more
responsibly in the face characters residing in Perl's UTF-8 extension
space (by avoiding an expensive function call merely to figure out
a length). He then noticed that <code>S_sv_pos_b2u_forwards</code> looks it
does the same thing as the public <code>Perl_utf8_length</code> function, and
wondered if the latter should not be used instead.</p>
<p>Carrying on in this one-person thread Tomoyuki decided the current
approach was a complete mess (indeed the C comments scream out about
needing to be fixed). So he fixed it.</p>
<pre>
  But not yet applied
  <a href="http://xrl.us/mrbu">http://xrl.us/mrbu</a> </pre>
<p>Andy Lester looked at <code>S_bytes_to_uni</code> and noticed that it could be made

<h2> <a name="s_reguni_should_return_its_length"> <code>S_reguni</code> should return its length</a> </h2>
</p> <p>Elsewhere, Andy thought that it was rather silly of <code>S_reguni</code> to
return its length via a pointer to an integer, and that returning
the value on the stack would make the intent a lot clearer. Agreed
to and applied by Rafael.</p>
<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/mrbw">http://xrl.us/mrbw</a> </pre>

<h2> <a name="signature_change_of_svvok__">Signature change of <code>SvVOK()</code> </a> </h2>
</p> <p>John Peacock sat up in surprise after stumbling across a patch
committed by Nicholas back in January, that changed the signature
of <code>SvVOK()</code>. The idea was to change from returning 0 or 1, to 0
or <code>valid-pointer</code>, which in turn cuts down on needless <code>mg_find</code>
calls.</p>
<p>As John has to mimic this behaviour in <em>version.pm</em>, he was hoping
for a little moral support on the issue. Support was freely given,
and appeared to consist of an inordinate amount of tweaks to header
files and <code>Devel::PPPort</code> to get just right.</p>

</p> <p>Andy Lester noticed that <code>S_regoptail</code> is called but once in

that called it was also able to be simplified further. Applied.</p>
<pre>
  Cascading goodness
  <a href="http://xrl.us/mrby">http://xrl.us/mrby</a> </pre>
<p>Andy then undertook some refactoring of <code>reghops</code>, but this was
not applied, despite the fact that the patch featured genuine
parameter <code>const</code>ing.</p>
<pre>
  Not enough goodness
  <a href="http://xrl.us/mrbz">http://xrl.us/mrbz</a> </pre>
<p>He finally attempted a <code>pp_sys</code> cleanup, but following the discovery
that there are no tests in the test suite that actually exercise the
code paths in question, Andy pulled it back onto bench to take another
look.</p>

</p> <p>Dave Mitchell and Mike Guy followed up on this thread, that
shows how two out of three seemingly identical regular expressions
are dispatched by the engine with utmost speed, but the third
get dragged down into a mess of exponential back-tracking.</p>
<p>It would appear that there is scope within engine to identify
the third expression as equivalent, however, Dave didn't wish
to commit to a date as to when that might occur.</p>

</p> <p>Sadahiro Tomoyuki took a closer look at this problem. Firstly, he
managed to produce a small test case that provoked the bug. Secondly,
this allowed him to narrow the offending code down to a section in
<code>Perl_sv_vcatpvfn</code>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the solution wasn't obvious, apparently one more
problem relating to the disconnect between bytes and characters.
Fortunately, he was able to cook up an appropriate patch, and as
an added bonus, provided a test that exercises the problem in both
ASCII and EBCDIC character sets.</p>

</p> <p>A lengthy thread developed on this, as Steve Peters tried to explain how

tried to explain how things were not working from his point of view. At

</p> <p>Rafael applied the suggested patch to <code>blead</code> and suggested that
Nicholas do as much for <code>maint</code>.</p>
<p>The thread then segued into the observation that you can actually
stuff just about anything into a perl <code>AV</code> array slot. Jan Dubois
confirmed that this was true, but worked only as long as you accessed
the contents within XS. Try to do as much in Perl code and the
hammer comes down, smashing your program into tiny pieces.</p>

</p> <p>Fitz Elliott noted that a bare <code>warn &quot;\n&quot;</code> spews large amounts of

</p> <p>Jim Duffield continued to make little progress in getting 5.8.8 to

</p> <p>Brad Bowman showed that <code>sub { @_ = 3; fork ? die 5 : die 6
}-E&lt;gt&gt;(2)</code> gives Win32 considerable pain. Steve Hay was able to
reproduce it on Win32 in <code>blead</code>, but wondered if anyone in Unix-land
was able to do the same.</p>
<p>It boils down to a problem with the way <code>fork</code> is emulated on Win32
through a lot of code here that simply never gets exercised on Unix.
Jan Dubois pointed to a little known <code>PERL_SYNC_FORK</code> trick that
could be used to serialise the fork executions, although it probably
hasn't been used in the past five years, and may have suffered
bitrot.</p>
<p>Dave Mitchell took a wild shot in the dark, Steve Hay tried the
suggestion, and as usual, Dave had called the play correctly.</p>

</p> <p>Julian Mehnle was puzzled by a discrepancy in the documentation, and
had to read the source to figure out what was really going on. He
thought that the best thing to do was to correct the documentation,
so that someone else would not fall into the same trap.</p>
<p>James Mastros suggested that the optimal solution would be to align
the code with the documentation, in a way that was both backwards
and forwards compatible. Fergal Daly admitted to being the guilty
party responsible for the problem in the first place, and cooked up
a patch that followed James's suggestion. Applied by Rafael.</p>

</p> <p>Slaven Rezic thought that the FAQ entry concerning how to write a
<code>switch</code> statement &#224; la C should not mention the <code>Switch</code>, (due
to weird syntax errors it can introduce into otherwise sane code,
because of its source filter nature). He wanted to point out that
in 5.10 one will be able to use the perl6-ish <code>given</code>/<code>when</code>
construct.</p>
<p>Abigail thought it was pretty silly to recommend this latter point,
since there is no firm date available as to when 5.10 will ship.</p>
