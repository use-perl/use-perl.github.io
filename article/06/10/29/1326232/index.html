<p><b>This week on the Perl 6 mailing lists</b>
<p>"IMHO, @Larry got overly precise in the above S02 quote:
s[More precisely] = "Usually""</p>

<p>-- Jonathan Lang, in 'where constraints as roles' (was:
'how typish are roles')</p></p>
<p><p> <b>Language</b> </p>
<p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/ab2560cbd9592082/f7a1252d726df455?#f7a1252d726df455">Synopsis 26 - Documentation [alpha draft]</a> </i> </p>
<p>Discussion continued on the draft S26 documentation Damian Conway
released.  Christopher J. Madsen noted another possible issue with
XHTML entities, which are not always lower-case.  He offered
suggestions on how the issue could be resolved.</p>

<p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/ed9514b0abca15d5/27fab20c832d7992?#27fab20c832d7992">signature subtyping and role merging</a> </i> </p>
<p>Two weeks ago,
TSa asked for some help on the topic of subtyping signatures in the
context of deriving a type lattice from role definitions.  Mark A.
Biggar replied that it is safe to assume that two methods with the
same name are semantically unrelated, which makes the signature merge
nonsensical in a general case.  Jonathan Lang agreed, requesting that
no attempt be made to merge signatures.  He suggested multiple
dispatch instead.</p>

<p>This week, TSa thought that while multiple dispatch would avoid
some problems, every role might not provide its methods as multi.
Jonathan Lang agreed but still thought there was no good way to
merge signatures.  TSa and Jonathan debated the issue further.</p>

<p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/044d6df42860da25/ebb04472ba4645cf?#ebb04472ba4645cf">set operations for roles</a> </i> </p>
<p>Last week,
Jonathan Lang replied to a comment in the thread
'class interface of roles'.
The discussion involved the syntax for ordered and unordered composition.
Jonathan proposed some syntax.  TSa and Jonathan discussed possibilities, and
Larry Wall added his thoughts.</p>

<p>This week there was further conversation, including a clarification of how
mathematical symbols for sets would be written in ASCII.  </p>

<p>There was also
confusion on rules for set operators, which, according to Jonathan
Lang, has to do with terminology.  He sees the same thing in the terms
'subclass' and 'superclass', which are counterintuitive.  He felt that
highlighting set operations and avoiding traditional type theory terminology
could avoid much of the confusion.  TSa was not sure this would solve the
issue.</p>

<p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/56692be822adb591/08542cc6a1c50274?#08542cc6a1c50274">Programming languages and copyright?</a> </i> </p>
<p>Markus Laire inquired about programming languages and copyrights.
Specifically, he wanted to know if it was legal to incorporate features
from other languages when designing a language.  Smylers replied that
code can be copyrighted, but ideas cannot be; therefore, you can borrow
from what code does, so long as you don't copy the sources.
Buddha Buck elaborated further.</p>

<p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/c393d3c536e74873/bc63da72cb2a05a4?#bc63da72cb2a05a4">how typish are roles</a> </i> </p>
<p>Referring to an earlier thread 'class interface of roles' (which also spawned
thread '<a href="%23ef30550b0610191539v139be744jc78e0c603d18bea7@mail.gmail.com">set operations for roles</a>',
TSa asked how typish roles are, because some people appear to see them as
lightweight components for class composition, while TSa views them as
offering a contract on functionality.  </p>

<p>Trey Harris gave his opinion.  He thought that in practice, both classes
and roles will be used as types, with roles being more common when working
close to the Perl core, and classes for local needs.</p>

<p>Later TSa summarized what had been discussed to date, which led to a
discussion of syntax and what will be part of Perl 6 (and what might come
later).</p>

<p>Trey started a new thread, 'where constraints as roles', wherein he asked
if a <code>where</code> clause or junctive type defines an anonymous role, while
a type parameter defines a lexical role, and suggested adding this
information to S12.  Larry Wall replied, saying that a <code>where</code> clause
is there for pattern matching...but went on to note other possibilities.
chromatic commented: "it's awfully difficult to have nominal typing in a room full of blank 'Hello my name is' tags."
Jonathan Lang felt that S02 gave some indication of what Trey suggested,
and that <code>where</code> clauses and junctive types should not be turned in to
roles: roles and junctive types should be turned in to <code>where</code>
constraints.</p>

<p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/b1784f9859094195/7a9c4ea4f2693bf4?#7a9c4ea4f2693bf4">mmd-draft.txt</a> </i> </p>
<p>TSa noted that multi-method dispatch is not yet in S06 and asked if
someone could explain the voting mechanism used to select the dispatch
target.</p>

<p> <b>Parrot Porters</b> </p>
<p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/6f636601146b01e4/4d9f4f6c3c042e3c?#4d9f4f6c3c042e3c">Bytecode PDD</a> </i> </p>
<p>Some time ago, Jonathan Worthington released a draft PDD for Parrot's
bytecode format.</p>

<p>This week, Jonathan replied to Leopold Toetsch's message, but also
suggested a review of r15001.  There was a brief discussion on HLL
resources.</p>

<p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/b5d7279ce4a0729e/fd8d67b5569fbce2?#fd8d67b5569fbce2">Parrot::Coroutine</a> </i> </p>
<p>Fran&ccedil;ois Perrad
continued the 'Heads up: Dynamic environment...' thread as it relates to
Lua.  He remarked that the <code>languages/lua/lib/thread.pir</code> methods are
stubs, and asked how <code>__clone</code> and <code>__get_pointer</code> should work.</p>

<p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/746c0b9388cf0571/dc151a2924858b09?#dc151a2924858b09">[perl #40544] [NEW] Test for DOS line endings in Parrot text files </a> </i> </p>
<p>Previously,
In ticket <a href="http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=40544">[perl #40544]</a>, Paul Cochrane offered a patch to check
for DOS line endings in the Parrot distribution.</p>

<p>This week Chris Dolan suggested changing <code>eval { use SVN::Client; };</code> to
<code>eval { require SVN::Client; };</code> </p>

<p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/99c61716a784a673/5ea9130ff081086d?#5ea9130ff081086d">classnames and HLL namespaces -- help!</a> </i> </p>
<p>Previously,
Patrick R. Michaud wrote of his confusion on how to deal with classname
conflicts when multiple HLL namespaces are involved, now that PDD21 has
changed.  Matt Diephouse, Allison Randal, Leopold Toetsch and
Will Coleda joined the thread.  The conclusion seemed to be that
namespace pollution still needs to be resolved and the object model
is due for discussion as well.</p>

<p>Recently, Jonathan Worthington proposed collecting requirements from
different languages so that an OO PDD can be based upon them.  He offered
to make the first draft and to maintain it.  chromatic thought it was a
good idea, and suggested using the <code>docs/pdds/clip</code> directory.
Patrick R. Michaud also approved.  This project was started with commit
'<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/89deae478215ab27/3bfb6ce5f7e8f74e?#3bfb6ce5f7e8f74e">[svn:parrot-pdd] r15024 - trunk/docs/pdds/clip</a>'.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Leopold Toetsch offered some more information on namespaces.
Patrick disagreed with Leopold's conclusions, stating that he was against
subclass' names needing to include the names of their parents.  There was
further discussion between Patrick and Leopold on this topic.</p>

<p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/7e25d1d861c85be8/2a3a12774b619a44?#2a3a12774b619a44">[HOWTO] add a C file to get archived in libparrot.a</a> </i> </p>
<p>Last week,
Karl Forner asked what he needed to do to have his .o file added in
<code>libparrot.a</code>.</p>

<p>Jonathan Worthington recommended a <code>make realclean</code>.  Karl replied that
it did not work.  Adam Thomason recommended adding the file to
<code>config/gen/makefiles/root.in</code> and running Configure again.</p>

<p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/88085fa992b1402e/b5858ba0478421ad?#b5858ba0478421ad">Current State of ParrotClass and ParrotObject?</a> </i> </p>
<p>Kevin Tew asked how he could instantiate a ParrotObject from a ParrotClass.
Leopold Toetsch asked to see Kevin's attempt.</p>

<p>Patches which generated discussion are listed individually.</p>

<p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/5ff4f0d8bb465dd8/bf7034320e6149c9?#bf7034320e6149c9">[perl #40593] [CAGE] make t/codingstd/linelength.t output look like other coding standard tests </a> </i> </p>
<p>In ticket <a href="http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=40593">[perl #40593]</a>, Jerry Gay requested that the format
of the line length test output be changed to match other tests.
Will Coleda remarked that not all tests follow the style Jerry
outlined.</p>

<p>Jerry remarked that he had created a new ticket,
'<a href="%23rt-3.5.HEAD-4978-1161800660-1352.40596-72-0@perl.org">[perl #40596] [CAGE] modify perl coding standard test format </a>',
which covers reformatting in general.</p>

<p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/5bbf1eab0133d467/c2d272593c52ff39?#c2d272593c52ff39">[perl #40443] Separate vtable functions from methods (using :vtable) </a> </i> </p>
<p>In ticket <a href="http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=40443">[perl #40443]</a>, Matt Diephouse noted that it was decided
at OSCON 2006 that vtables and methods should be separated.</p>

<p>Jonathan wondered if this should be postponed until the object and namespace
issues have been dealt with.   Allison Randal summarized the results of
her last conversation with Chip Salzenberg on the topic.  Jonathan thanked
her for the specifications and said he would work on an implementation.</p>

<p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/b48523f53a3ec2c3/243df81d3ba4e886?#243df81d3ba4e886">[perl #40523] [TODO] adjust  string_append function and usage </a> </i> </p>
<p>Earlier, Leopold Toetsch created a ticket (<a href="http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=40523">[perl #40523]</a>)
asking for instances of <code>string_append</code> to be removed.  This week,
Jonathan reported it done in r15025.</p>

<p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/cbf6dac677b4153e/e9cb9522593bc121?#e9cb9522593bc121">[perl #40596] [CAGE] modify perl coding standard test format </a> </i> </p>
<p>In ticket <a href="http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=40596">[perl #40596]</a>, Jerry Gay proposed modifying the Perl coding
standard test format to have one test per standard, rather than one
test per file.  The reason for this was to prevent inflation of test
numbers, which could lead to a false perception on test coverage.</p>

<p>Chris Dolan understood Jerry's reasoning, but argued that because
Test::Perl::Critic is designed to work on a per-file basis, so this
change would be difficult to implement unless output was reduced to
simply one test for everything.  Jerry thought one perlcritic test
was fine, and also asked if the test could become quieter.  Chris
supplied the syntax for reducing output.</p>

him for the information.</p>

<p>Previously,
Karl Forner asked if there was a way to specify the minimum allocation
size for PMCs.  Leopold Toetsch replied that the issue had come up a
number of times.  He explained the history behind it, and offered
suggestions for resolving the legacy confusion.</p>

<p>This week, Allison Randal took a stab at answering the questions
Karl posed.</p>

<p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/3c0cbc1a079ad4c1/b12b82de4df311b3?#b12b82de4df311b3">MMD function __add not found</a> </i> </p>
<p>Fran&ccedil;ois Perrad
wondered if it was possible to mix <code>:method</code> and <code>:multi</code> in order
to write a method <code>__add</code> to support the opcode <code>add</code> in a new <code>thread</code>
class which subclasses Parrot::Coroutine.  He included example code
and the error he had gotten.</p>

<p>Last week, Richard Hainsworth asked about the syntax for embedding Perl 5
modules in Perl 6 code, and Steffen Schwigon offered a suggestion.</p>

<p>This week Steffen added that he had had more luck with other Perl 5
modules, but Wx appeared troublesome.  After further discussion with
Richard, Steffen suggested trying an easier module to learn about Perl
5 integration, or waiting for further progress if Wx is required.
Steffen also requested a test for Pugs of Wx's style of indirect
package import/export.  There were some further attempts at debugging,
with Richard including some Gtk2 code which did (partially) work.</p>
