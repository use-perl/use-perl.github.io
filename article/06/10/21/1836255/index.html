<div class="span8">
<p>The Perl 6 design team met by phone on 18 October 2006.  The attendees were Larry, Damian, Allison, Patrick, Jesse, Nicholas, and chromatic.  These are the minutes.</p>
<p>
<p> <strong>Allison:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>threads</li>
<li>my two-hour review of the threads turned into something longer</li>
<li>there are only two hours left</li>
</ul>


<p> <strong>Larry:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>and we'll have fusion in twenty years</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Allison:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>I'm just about to put that up</li>
<li>it's not an apocalypse on threading</li>
<li>it's just a collection of thoughts so far</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Jesse:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>background reading, not spec</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Allison:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>some of the background reading includes partially finished specs</li>
<li>after people talk about it a little bit, I'll chunk it into something
	  closer to an actual spec</li>
<li>either objects or events next</li>
<li>events are close to threads</li>
<li>it might make sense to take a break from that while people muddle over
	  threads</li>
<li>I also know Patrick is working on something that needs review</li>
<li>probably a small addition to the existing subroutine flags</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Larry:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>things proceed apace</li>
<li>helped usher the new Pugs release out the door</li>
<li>hacking away on my Perl 6 program for work</li>
<li>having a lot of fun with that</li>
<li>starting to think about my talk in Brazil</li>
<li>also holding forth on Perl Monks</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Jesse:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>now that Sage is back in school, what's going on with 5-to-6?</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Larry:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>as far as I know, nothing</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>c:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>fixed up as much of <code>Parrot::Embed</code> as possible</li>
<li>now trying to get it to build everywhere possible</li>
<li>should be able to call Parrot subs from Perl 5 as if they were normal
	  Perl 5 subs in a few days</li>
<li>that has an interesting technical problem with regard to typed
	  signatures, but I hope it reveals some good solution</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Patrick:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>working on PGE namespaces</li>
<li>hope to have that today or tomorrow</li>
<li>requires lots of internal changes</li>
<li>I previously used a flat namespace</li>
<li>looks like Kevin Tew implemented the <code>:init</code> flag per my message yesterday</li>
<li>still reviewing the namespace PDDs</li>
<li>happy to invite people to contribute tests and features</li>
<li>they'd be immediately useful to the tools I'm writing</li>
<li>will pass off some of the PGE converstion to smash from IRC who wanted
	  something to do</li>
<li>can't make it to the Hackathon phyiscally, but I can be on IRC for most
	  of the weekend</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Damian:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>continuing to work on the POD spec and implementation</li>
<li>that's going okay</li>
<li>still would like feedback on the proposed extention to <code>=use</code> </li>
<li>if that's okay, I'm almost ready for another release of the spec and
	  parser</li>
<li>otherwise preparing for more work in Australia in the next week or two</li>
<li>have had some feedback on the lists, but it's very quiet</li>
<li>either we're being Warnocked, or we're being Warnocked</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Jesse:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>talked to Chip briefly yesterday</li>
<li>also turned the original milestone document into a matrix</li>
<li>added in additional PDDs and things like testing</li>
<li>poking some non-designers for their opinions</li>
<li>just trying to see if external opinions line up with internal opinions</li>
<li>should have more information by the next meeting</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>c:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>my only comment on the POD spec was wondering if the single-colon
	  demarcation of the language might be confusing when used with the
	  double-colon namespace separator</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Damian:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>that's a language issue in general</li>
<li>Larry needs to rule on that</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>c:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>that's fine; it just came to mind when I saw it in the <code>=use</code> spec</li>
<li>would <code>perldoc6</code> let you do <code>ruby:Some::Module</code>?</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Damian:</strong> </p>
<blockquote> <div> <p>The answer is: Yes indeedly-doo, neighbour!</p>

<p>If the Ruby module happened to be in your library path (it's not clear to me
whether it would have to be in <code>$PERL6LIB</code> or <code>$RUBYLIB</code>;
I assume the latter) then it would be <code>require</code>d, presumably loading
the necessary class to add some block functionality to the Perldoc parser. But
that magic would be entirely handled by the default cleverness of the Perl 6
<code>require</code>, presuming the eventual parser is written in Perl
6.</p> </div> </blockquote></p>
