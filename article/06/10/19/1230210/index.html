<h2> <a name="coding_styles_and_ancient_perls">Coding styles and ancient perls</a> </h2>
</p> <p>Last week, Dr. Ruud and Yves Orton worked on bringing <code>makepatch</code> up to
speed on the Windows platform. For some reason it sparked a long discussion
about the merits of writing code compatible with ancient versions of Perl
and <code>$_</code> topicalisation.</p>

<h2> <a name="5_8_8__invalid_free___in_perl_do_exec3">5.8.8+ invalid <code>free()</code> in <code>Perl_do_exec3</code> </a> </h2>
</p> <p>Alexey Tourbin spotted a problem with the current 5.8 snapshot that
doesn't show up in the 5.8.8 release. Dave Mitchell thanked him for
picking it up, and fixed it.</p>
<p>Alexey went on to mention that he runs a git repository that tracks
the 5.8 and 5.9 sources, and lamented that he could not quite figure
out to which change corresponded the 5.9.0 release.</p>

<h2> <a name="resolving_downstream_breakages_from_version_pm_changes">Resolving downstream breakages from <strong>version.pm</strong> changes</a> </h2>
</p> <p>Adam Kennedy uses <code>only.pm</code> to lock down the versions of modules
used in the code he delivers to clients, and noticed that <code>only</code>
doesn't work correctly with changes that have taken place since in
<code>version</code>, and development on <code>only</code> appears to have dragged to
a halt.</p>

<p>John Peacock took a look at <code>only</code>'s code, saw what was wrong with
it, and at the same time asked Adam wither <code>version::Limit</code> might
do the trick instead.</p>

<h2> <a name="g___compile_and_make_test_100_">g++ compile and make test 100%</a> </h2>
</p> <p>After weeks of patching and tweaking the source, Jarkko Hietaniemi announced
that he had succeeded in performing a C++ compilation of the perl source,
and a completely successful test suite run. Rafa&#235;l Garcia-Suarez noted
that <code>NDBM_File</code> still had trouble. Jarkko didn't notice that because it
wasn't configured to be built on his platform. Robin Barker provided a
patch to fix it up.</p>

<p>Paul Marquess, Steve Peters and Jesse Vincent reported successes
with other C++ compilers and platforms. H.Merijn Brand found a
problem on Suse Linux, as did Dominic Dunlop on Mac OS/X.</p>

<h2> <a name="the_curious_case_of_the_last_close_parenthesis">The curious case of the last close parenthesis</a> </h2>
</p> <p>Yves Orton surfaced briefly to discuss some oddities he had found in the
regular expression concerning how opening and closing capturing
parentheses are managed. An optimisation in the engine consists of
throwing the regop codes that denote the parentheses, and
tracks them itself... but doesn't track them all that well.</p>
<p>Over time, this has manifested itself through a variety of bugs,
all of which have been solved in ad hoc ways, as no one really
understood the big picture.</p>
<p>Yves thinks that his hypothesis is right, and wanted to know what
Dave Mitchell thought of it. Ilya Zakharevich remembered that Yves's
two variables, <code>PL_reglastparen</code> and <code>PL_reglastcloseparen</code> were
once upon a time a single variable, but were split into two, probably
when non-capturing parentheses were introduced. As such, it's quite
possible that the code was not correctly updated in all the required
places. In a patch elsewhere this week, Yves dropped some comment
markers here and there, where he thought the variables should be
updated.</p>
<pre>

<h2> <a name="will_the_real_perl_reg_named_buff_sv_please_stand_up">Will the real <code>Perl_reg_named_buff_sv</code> please stand up?</a> </h2>
</p> <p>Craig A. Berry was having trouble building the <code>re</code> extension on VMS,
since the VMS linker didn't like the fact that the <code>Perl_reg_named_buff_sv</code>
symbol was defined twice, in two different object files.</p>

<p>Yves explained that one was derived from the other, in order to generate
the debugging version. His linker, being slightly more lax, did not complain
about this issue, and fixed it up in a subsequent patch.</p>
<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/sm59">http://xrl.us/sm59</a> </pre>
<p>
<h2> <a name="status_of_perl_5_10_todo_list">Status of Perl 5.10 TODO list</a> </h2>
</p> <p>Yves then looked at the TODO list for 5.10 and counted four issues
outstanding. He wanted to know that their status was, and what
needs to be done. Rafa&#235;l said three of them were issues he planned
to deal with, and one was less important (lexical encoding pragmas).
He also mentioned that aliases were probably important enough to
be taken on board, as were <code>UNITCHECK</code> blocks.</p>
<p>Juerd was very keen to see work done on the <code>encoding</code> pragma. He
as released a work-around <code>encoding::split</code> to get things to work
to his satisfaction, but would like to see the functionality appear
in the core.</p>

<p>Adriano Ferreira reminded the porters of bug #38945, which notes that
<code>Configure</code> is not <code>x.10</code> version aware. Andreas K&#246;nig mentioned
that DBI doesn't compile on <code>blead</code> (and someone needs to open a
ticket on that).</p>
<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/sm6a">http://xrl.us/sm6a</a> </pre>
<p>Philip M. Gollucci, almost left behind, pointed out that there was an
icky attribute/printf problem that needed to be sorted out as well.</p>

<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/sm6b">http://xrl.us/sm6b</a> </pre>
<p>
<h2> <a name="svpvs_vs_svpvn"> <code>SVpvs</code> vs <code>SVpvn</code> </a> </h2>
</p> <p>Jim Cromie was looking through the source when he noticed that there
were a number of places where the <code>newSVpvn</code> call could be more
profitably replaced by a <code>newSVpvs</code>, the reason being that this
removes the need to keep hard-coded lengths of strings lying
around (as this can allow bit-rot to creep in).</p>

<p>Nicholas Clark went ahead and made the change. Aaron Sherman pointed
out that the hard-coded length might be a slightly sick way of
taking a substring of a constant, such as</p>
<pre>
  SV *s = newSVpvn(&quot;pear&quot;,3);</pre>
<p>Nicholas had already looked for such cases in the code, and the
only occurrences he found were deliberate tests.</p>
<p>Vadim Konovalov wondered whether the real reason that hard-coded
lengths were used was to avoid possibly costly length computations.
Jim Cromie believed that this was not a problem, since the constructs
tended to be evaluated when the C source is compiled, and boil down
to a constant in the resulting object code.</p>

<p>
<h2> <a name="new_version_diagnostic_breaks_a_bunch_of_modules">New version diagnostic breaks a bunch of modules</a> </h2>
</p> <p>Michael G. Schwern wished to register his disgruntledness at the
fact that a diagnostic change caused a number of his modules
(<code>Exporter::Lite</code>, <code>UNIVERSAL::exports</code> and <code>UNIVERSAL::require</code>
for starters), and wondered how many other modules were in the
same boat.</p>
<p>John Peacock was loathe to give up the more informative new error
message. He could get close to matching the old message if
certain conditions were met, but not completely. Michael remarked
that future-proofing the checking of perl error messages is hard.</p>
<pre>
  Never mind localisation

<p>
<h2> <a name="off_by_one_in_the_trie_code">Off by one in the trie code?</a> </h2>
</p> <p>Nicholas Clark wrote a psychotic regular expression to provoke
a leak that was picked up by valgrind, and he wondered if there
was an off-by-one error. Yves promised to have a look at it
later.</p>

<h2> <a name="what_jarkko_hietaniemi_did_this_week">What Jarkko Hietaniemi did this week</a> </h2>
</p> <p>Jarkko tweaked some of Yves's code to get it to compile cleanly
with the more fussy compilers that he has at his disposal.</p>
<pre>
  Do not cross the initialisation boundary, do not collect $200
  <a href="http://xrl.us/sm6f">http://xrl.us/sm6f</a> </pre>
<p>Jarkko transformed <code>Digest::SHA</code> from K&amp;R C to ANSI, and described
the delicate footwork required to ensure that <code>blead</code> and CPAN
play nicely together.</p>

<p>Mark Shelor, <code>Digest::SHA</code>'s author, thanked Jarkko for the patch,
and planned to integrate it for the upcoming 5.44 release, so with
luck no one will have to take extra care for very long.</p>
<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/sm6g">http://xrl.us/sm6g</a> </pre>
<p>Jarkko performed similar tweaks for <em>Encode.xs</em>, with a eye on C++.</p>
<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/sm6h">http://xrl.us/sm6h</a>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/sm6i">http://xrl.us/sm6i</a> </pre>

<p>He then gave a few hints to Linux and Solaris to tell C++ how to
deal with <code>dlerror</code>, noting that if a third platform needs this
trickery then it will be time to push it off into <code>Configure</code>.</p>
<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/sm6j">http://xrl.us/sm6j</a> </pre>
<p>Moving on through the modules, he then performed a classy act
on <code>ExtUtils::ParseXS</code>.</p>
<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/sm6k">http://xrl.us/sm6k</a> </pre>

<p>And then ANSIfied the <code>Text::Soundex</code> module.</p>

<h2> <a name="what_yves_orton_did_to_the_regular_expression_engine_this_week">What Yves Orton did to the regular expression engine this week</a> </h2>
</p> <p>Yves Orton, the unstoppable feature-adder to the regular expression
engine, added named recursion this week, whereby <code>&lt;(?&amp;NAME)&gt;</code>
recurses to the capture buffer defined by <code>(?&lt;NAME&gt;...)</code>.</p>

<pre>
  No, my brane hurts
  <a href="http://xrl.us/sm6o">http://xrl.us/sm6o</a> </pre>
<p>He landed another patch to fix bugs, test code and add more
functionality to deal with conditionals in regular expressions.</p>
<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/sm6p">http://xrl.us/sm6p</a> </pre>
<p>He then added even more documentation, of note is an update to
<em>perlreguts</em>.</p>
<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/sm6q">http://xrl.us/sm6q</a> </pre>

<p>And last but not least, Yves announced that he had added possessive
quantifiers to the engine. He also put floated the idea of removing
the dire warnings about the experimental status of the existing
extensions, since they have been around for a long time and have
been well documented and well explored by large numbers of people.</p>
<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/sm6r">http://xrl.us/sm6r</a> </pre>
<p>Sadahiro-san delivered a patch to remove <code>leaveit</code> from
<em>toke.c</em>:scan_const, which deals with escaped characters in patterns.
There were a number of short-comings with the current code, not to
mention breakage. Now it's better.</p>

<h2> <a name="sprintf_width_precision_fails_on_wide_chars___40473_"> <code>sprintf</code> width+precision fails on wide chars (#40473)</a> </h2>
</p> <p>Anatoly Vorobey found a bug in the way <code>sprintf</code> handles UTF-8 characters
and supplied a patch against <code>blead</code> to correct it. Applied by Rafa&#235;l.</p>

<pre>
  Why aren't all bug reports like this?
  <a href="http://xrl.us/sm6t">http://xrl.us/sm6t</a> </pre>
<p>
<h2> <a name="regular_expression_recursion___40495_">Regular expression recursion (#40495)</a> </h2>
</p> <p>Matthias Urlichs demonstrated a bug in the regular expression engine. It
failed with <code>x{2}</code> but went away when replaced by <code>xx</code>. Dave Mitchell
explained that sometimes the optimiser fails to recognise such transforms.
In any event, with the latest work to the engine in <code>blead</code>, the
offending pattern works just fine.</p>

<pre>
  Even if it does consume quite a bit of memory
  <a href="http://xrl.us/sm6u">http://xrl.us/sm6u</a> </pre>
<p>
<h2> <a name="can_t_locate_foo_bar_pm_isn_t_a_helpful_message___40516_"> <code>Can't locate Foo/Bar.pm</code> isn't a helpful message (#40516)</a> </h2>
</p> <p>Tina thought that this message exposed too much of how things are
implemented, and a beginner might not necessarily realise that there
was a problem loading the <code>Foo::Bar</code> module. She thought that
adding a &quot;perhaps Foo::Bar is not installed&quot; to the end of the message
would help improve matters.</p>

<p>Juerd wondered whether this would encourage newbies to
hunt down the <em>Foo/Bar.pm</em> file and dump it in an <code>@INC</code> directory.
People already tend to do this, which leads to problems when modules
have XS components and the result is traffic on mailing lists and
other fora.</p>

<h1> <a name="in_brief">In Brief</a> </h1>
</p> <p>Tels made a few suggestions about the code in <code>makepatch</code> that received
a work-over last week.</p>
<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/sm63">http://xrl.us/sm63</a> </pre>
<p>Dave Nicol suggested that the source code be formatted according
to a fixed set of rules.</p>
<pre>

  <a href="http://xrl.us/sm64">http://xrl.us/sm64</a> </pre>
<p>Johan Vromans looked at <code>Carp::Clan</code> and thought that its <strong>functionality
was so useful that it should be subsumed into the core <code>Carp</code> </strong> module,
arguing that it is better to extend an existing module than to introduce
a new one that duplicates a lot of the functionality of the previous one.</p>
<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/sm65">http://xrl.us/sm65</a> </pre>
<p>Gabor Szabo asked about <strong>running <code>Devel::Cover</code> on core modules in blead</strong>

and Paul Johnson set him straight.</p>
<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/sm66">http://xrl.us/sm66</a> </pre>
<p>Andreas K&#246;nig found that <code>change #28976 breaks YAML</code>, but Rafa&#235;l
was unable to reproduce the problem. Andreas later discovered that #28997
resolved the problem in any event.</p>
<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/sm67">http://xrl.us/sm67</a> </pre>
<p>Similarly, David Landgren compiled Template Toolkit on a recent
build of <code>blead</code> (change #28998) and watched in blow up. Rafa&#235;l
noted that the code in <code>Template.xs</code> relied on a macro producing
a parenthesised result, which was used directly in a C <code>switch</code>

statement, and at some point the <code>blead</code> version of the macro lost
the parenthesis wrapper. So <code>Template.xs</code> needs to add in the
parentheses itself.</p>
<pre>
  relying on the core to do it for you
  <a href="http://xrl.us/sm68">http://xrl.us/sm68</a> </pre>
<p>Jerry D. Hedden raised <strong> <code>threads</code> to version 1.44</strong>, and <strong> <code>threads::shared</code>

to version 1.04</strong>.</p>

  <a href="http://xrl.us/sm69">http://xrl.us/sm69</a>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/sm7a">http://xrl.us/sm7a</a> </pre>
<p>Juerd Waalboer wondered if he had hit <strong>a <code>B::Deparse</code> bug</strong>, since
a nested hashref/listref structure deparses into a different structure
that in turn deparses to something else...</p>

<pre>
  ... and so on to viscosity
  <a href="http://xrl.us/sm7b">http://xrl.us/sm7b</a> </pre>
<p>Yves shed some light on <strong>why he chose <code>\k&lt;...&gt;</code> over <code>\k{...}</code>
for named captures</strong> in regular expressions.</p>

<pre>
  Because
  <a href="http://xrl.us/sm7c">http://xrl.us/sm7c</a> </pre>
<p>Jos I. Boumans proposed <strong>adding <code>Log::Message</code> and
<code>Log::Message::Simple</code> to the core</strong>.</p>

<p>Mark J. Reed sought more information on <strong>the way <code>File::Find</code>
orders directories and files</strong>, since he could not see a way to
process directories first and then files.</p>
<pre>
  lots of &quot;HACK:&quot; comments
  <a href="http://xrl.us/sm7e">http://xrl.us/sm7e</a> </pre>
