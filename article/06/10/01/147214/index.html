<p><b>This week on the Perl 6 mailing lists</b>
<p>"And here I thought you were a responsible, law-abiding citizen... :P "</p>

<p>-- Jonathan Lang, commenting on Larry Wall's
<code>self.HOW does Hash</code> </p></p>
<p><p> <b>Language</b> </p>
<p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/740b563434202715/c76a67c58f0a1db0?#c76a67c58f0a1db0">class interface of roles</a> </i> </p>
<p>TSa wondered how <a href="http://www.jot.fm/issues/issue_2004_11/column1">typing of
mixins</a> would
look in Perl 6.  A code example of how it might look was included.
There were also some questions on roles in Perl 6.</p>

<p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/a123bb8880689752/0024060b69972418?#0024060b69972418">Capture Literals</a> </i> </p>
<p>Responding to an earlier thread, Austin Hastings asked if Capture
literals would replace or unify "assuming"/"currying".</p>

<p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/c2b106d848ac8019/37e3137a0abda4ae?#37e3137a0abda4ae">Motivation for /&lt;alpha&gt;+/ set Array not Match?</a> </i> </p>
<p>In a previous week,
Audrey Tang quoted a section of S05 concerning subrules.  She found
the 'quantified' clause to be unintuitive and wondered if it would be
possible to modify it to produce Match objects and to reserve Array
only for noncontiguous same-name subrules.
Patrick R. Michaud and Flavio S. Glock made some alternate suggestions.</p>

<p>More recently Audrey replied to the thread, wondering if there was a
hidden cost to making <code>/&lt;foo&gt;+/</code> always react so that <code>$&lt;foo&gt;.from</code>
returns something.  Masak preferred the proposed semantics and asked if
the question had been discussed off-list.</p>

<p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/582a57072c697926/a06caa96d3bfdfc8?#a06caa96d3bfdfc8">Nitpick my Perl6 - parametric roles</a> </i> </p>
<p>Sam Vilain sent some code on Perl 6 core types as collections and asked
if anyone would like to poke holes in it.  TSa applauded the use of
functions but wondered if it would work.  Several other people followed
up on that thought.</p>

<p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/997a08174cc3bbb1/f9aead15656700f9?#f9aead15656700f9">Mutability vs Laziness</a> </i> </p>
<p>Aaron Sherman pursued a conversation which began in IRC.  He listed
some immutable types declared in S06 and noted that there appear to be
three core attributes (Mutability, Laziness and Ordered), each of which
has two states (true or false).  From this he derived 8 types of
containers. </p>

<p>Dave Whipp thought there was a fourth attribute, exclusivity.
Sam Vilain felt that ordered was not an attribute of a collection.</p>

<p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/294ad1ba8393f52c/12e0cf3dfc53ece0?#12e0cf3dfc53ece0">[svn:perl6-synopsis] r12398 - doc/trunk/design/syn</a> </i> </p>
<p>In a recent commit, Larry Wall removed the special <code>[,]</code>, which is now
just a list op form of <code>[...]</code>.  In order to support the <code>|func()</code> syntax,
<code>|</code> became the new disigilized <code>*</code>.  </p>

<p>Luke Palmer replied in support of
the new syntax.  TSa also approved, but would have liked the new operator
spelled.  Aaron Crane thought that was undesirable because there are
already terms which begin with <code>/</code>, namely regular expressions.</p>

<p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/195abb9c8900b5de/e49df94eb04c5acc?#e49df94eb04c5acc">Common Serialization Interface</a> </i> </p>
<p>Brad Bowman wondered if there was a common element to a serialization
role which could be included in the default implementation.
Mark Stosberg noted that there is already a <code>.yaml</code> and a <code>.perl</code>
to serialize to these formats, but he did not know if they were suitable
substitutes for the role-based approach Brad had in mind.  He included
a code sample.  Aaron Sherman and Luke Palmer offered additional code
examples.  Larry Wall commented that it makes a big difference whether
the entire string must be held in memory or not.</p>

<p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/66a1ee53986ac57a/f60728b0187a16aa?#f60728b0187a16aa">[svn:perl6-synopsis] r12417 - doc/trunk/design/syn</a> </i> </p>
<p>Audrey Tang committed a change which introduced the <code>$$x</code> form in
adverbial pair parsing to S02 and canonicalized the term 'item'
in S02 and S04.</p>

<p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/ff061d5e5f192a52/8dc10125908fba32?#8dc10125908fba32">[svn:perl6-synopsis] r12432 - doc/trunk/design/syn</a> </i> </p>
<p>In S03, Audrey Tang noted that chained comparisons short-circuit and
never evaluate arguments more than once.</p>

<p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/55881e5b27d9b6c0/d92a7d306f9cb70a?#d92a7d306f9cb70a">RFC: multi assertions/prototypes: a step toward programming by contract</a> </i> </p>
<p>Aaron Sherman wrote to suggest a signature prototype that all multis
defined in or exported to the current namespace must match, as a means
of implementing the paradigm of programming by contract.  </p>

<p>Trey Harris felt that the point of multiple dispatch is that arguments
are not bound to a single type, and the proposal might defeat this use,
although junctive types, subsets and roles make 'single type' less of
a constraint.  Miroslav Silovic was bothered by the possible duplication
of functionality and believed that declarative requirements should go
in to roles.  Many other people responded to this thread.</p>

<p>In addition, there was a discussion on the terminology of libraries
in Perl 5 and Perl 6--'package' being the Perl 5 term, and 'module'
the Perl 6 term.  The definition of 'programming by contract' was
also discussed.</p>

<p>There was also a discussion on whether 'package' implied a Perl 5 library
and 'module' suggested a Perl 6 one.  Larry Wall attempted to clarify.</p>

<p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/863eaa83c9951fdb/99801794cb66b5d0?#99801794cb66b5d0">special named assertions</a> </i> </p>
<p>David Brunton posted about an IRC conversation from earlier.  He
listed the seven special named assertions found in S05, and the twenty-four
found in <code>docs/Perl6/Overview/Rule.pod</code>.  He found another one in
<code>t/regex/from_perl6_rules/stdrules.t</code>.  In his opinion, it was worth
creating a single place in S05 where all of these named assertions
are listed. </p>

<p>Patrick R. Michaud disagreed with the inclusion of <code>&lt;'...'&gt;</code>
and <code>&lt;"..."&gt;</code> as named assertions.  He stated that he would compare the
list with what PGE has implemented and report differences.
Mark A. Biggar noted that the documentation should distinguish between
pre-defined character classes and special builtins.  Patrick responded
with PGE's view on what constitutes a special builtin.</p>

<p>Bob Rogers sent a patch to create a <code>return_stack</code> for <code>bsr/jsr/ret</code> ops.
Leopold Toetsch replied that separate stacks are good, but wondered
if a return stack per context was desired.  Bob Rogers replied in detail
and included another patch.</p>

<p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/5dd1ed861079a52a/afe8cf1028de8610?#afe8cf1028de8610">postgres interface</a> </i> </p>
<p>Leopold Toetsch has been working on <code>postgres.pir</code> and reported several
changes, including a new test file.  Bob Rogers sent a patch to make it
more forgiving of an absent <code>libpq.so</code>.  It was applied.</p>

segmentation fault in generating a packfile for compiled PIR generated
by .Net.  Later he found the bug and implemented a workaround.</p>

<p>Leopold Toetsch referred to the recently improved smoke tests for Pugs,
and wondered if it would be possible to do something similar for Parrot.
Jerry Gay replied that he'd been working on a Parrot implemention.</p>

<p>Allison Randal replied that she felt the problem was one of
inconsistency.  She gave a few suggestions, which Leopold Toetsch
responded to.  Jonathan Scott Duff also proposed a slight modification
of syntax.  A discussion on the syntax followed.</p>

<p>Allison Randal posted that the single most important thing in the
project is shipping a 1.0 release of Parrot, which is now very close.
She called for functionality over elegant theory for the moment.</p>

<p>Watson Ladd asked how call and ret opcodes will interact with
continuations.  chromatic replied that the opcodes invoke the
appropriate continuations.</p>

<p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/31a02227307ac557/b264b4c565ebceb7?#b264b4c565ebceb7">PDD 22 - I/O release candidate 1</a> </i> </p>
<p>Allison Randal announced that she'd committed an updated I/O PDD.
She requested feedback, especially on which lightweight concurrency
model to use for asynchronous operations.  She also asked for a reaction
on async ops returning status objects while sync ops return integer
error codes.</p>

<p>chromatic suggested that ops could always return PMCs, and simply check
the intval if required.  Tim Bunce wondered if speed-sensitive ops which
might be used in loops could be given the PMC to reuse.</p>

<p>Leopold Toetsch remarked that he did not like I/O opcodes and explained
why.  chromatic disagreed with one of the arguments and Leopold replied.</p>

<p>Joshua Hoblitt asked for more details on Allison's comment about concurrency
models: was she speaking of the Parrot API, the actual implementation, or
both?  He felt that the implementation would need to be highly
platform specific.</p>

<p>Allison Randal summarized a telephone conversation with Leopold
Toetsch.  They discussed proposals on variable-sized PMCs and a
shared base class for PMC types ('<a href="%23200609272157.37544.lt@toetsch.at">Two new pdds</a>').
In Allison's opinion, variable-sized PMCs are a step toward closing the
gap between low-level PMCs and higher-level Parrot Object PMCs.  She
also thought there were several good ideas in the shared base class
proposal.  The new PMCs will be implemented first as prototypes, and
assessed/rewritten without changing the existing system.</p>

<p>Leopold Toetsch announced two new documents in <code>docs/pddfs/clip</code> as of
r14774.  One, <code>pddXX_cstruct.pod</code> is the metaclass of all publically
accessible C-derived structures used in Parrot.  The other,
<code>pddXX_pmc.pod</code>, describes the general structure of PMC internal

<p>This week the long-running CGI thread splintered in to the question of
how to pass a reference from a language with no references when Mark
Stosberg replied to a discussion on how Perl 5 embeds in Perl 6.</p>

<p>Mark saw some recent Pugs commits on Perl 5 embedding, which encouraged him to
experiment with passing hashes and arrays.  In his tests, he was able to
send an array as an arrayref, but was unable to get a hashref.  He wondered
if there was another way to do it.  Aristotle Pagaltzis replied.</p>

<p>Last week, Fagyal Csongor asked if someone was willing to write a Perl
6 style guide.  This led to a discussion on other resources, desired and
existing.  This week, Chris Dolan asked if anyone wanted to start a port
of Perl::Critic.</p>

<p>Fagyal Csongor included some code which gave an unexpected result and
wondered if the code or Pugs was at fault.
A. Pagaltzis replied that the <code>xx</code> operator is list-repeat rather
than string-repeat.  Juerd also explained further, and the code was
fixed.</p>
