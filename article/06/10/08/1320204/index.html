<p><b>This week on the Perl 6 mailing lists</b>
<p>"When I first read 'Warnock applies' on things in p6 summaries a
year or so ago, I thought it was some really energetic programmer
who went around and applied patches as soon as people posed
a question."</p>

<p>-- Carl M&auml;sak, on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warnock's_Dilemma">Warnock's Dilemma</a> </p></p>
<p><p> <b>Language</b> </p>
<p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/f9c74af0db25b3d4/33935ed88e64a70a?#33935ed88e64a70a">Nested statement modifiers</a> </i> </p>
<p>Paul Seamons asked why multiple nested statement modifiers (<code>say "foo" if $foo for 1 .. 3</code>) are disallowed. A long discussion on the technical and ergonomical problems was stirred up. The general consensus is that there is still no good reason to allow nested statement modifiers.</p>

<p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/f9c74af0db25b3d4/e954b875f3847807?#e954b875f3847807">Exceptions on hypers</a> </i> </p>
<p>In a subthread of '<a href="%23200609011052.00562.parrot@seamons.com">Nested statement modifiers</a>',
Aaron Sherman asked what the semantics of exceptions within hyper
operators are. Larry explained that since hyperoperators imply not
caring about the order of the side effects (for multithreaded
goodness), which element generates an exception might be
implementation dependent.</p>

<p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/740b563434202715/c76a67c58f0a1db0?#c76a67c58f0a1db0">class interface of roles</a> </i> </p>
<p>Last week,
TSa wondered how <a href="http://www.jot.fm/issues/issue_2004_11/column1">typing of
mixins</a> would
look in Perl 6.  A code example of how it might look was included.
There were also some questions on roles in Perl 6.</p>

<p>This week, Sam Vilain thought that it would be the same as requiring
that a class implement a method, except for a difference in syntax.
This led Brad Bowman to ask how a role can require a target class
to implement a method or do another role.  Stevan Little answered
that he believed this was done by providing a method stub.  Jonathan
Lang mostly agreed with Stevan and offered more details.</p>

<p>chromatic thought that forbidding methods was potentially like
the false-cognate problem.  Stevan admitted that he had yet to
find a real-world use for it.</p>

<p>There was further discussion on roles.</p>

<p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/c2b106d848ac8019/37e3137a0abda4ae?#37e3137a0abda4ae">Motivation for /&lt;alpha&gt;+/ set Array not Match?</a> </i> </p>
<p>Last week, an earlier discussion on S05 subrules continued.  Audrey
Tang wondered if there was a hidden cost to making <code>/&lt;foo&gt;+/</code> always
react so that <code>$&lt;foo&gt;.from</code> returns something.  Carl M&auml;sak
preferred the proposed semantics and asked if
the question had been discussed off-list.</p>

<p>This week, Audrey replied that there had been no further discussion.
Carl asked for a short snipped to illustrate it, and supplied an anecdote
about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warnock's_Dilemma">Warnock</a> applying.</p>

<p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/55881e5b27d9b6c0/d92a7d306f9cb70a?#d92a7d306f9cb70a">RFC: multi assertions/prototypes: a step toward programming by contract</a> </i> </p>
<p>Last week there was a great deal of discussion on this subject.</p>

<p>This week, Tsa asked, in response to Larry Wall's comment,
if namespaces give a structural type definition.</p>

<p>Also, Aaron Sherman started a new topic entitled 'Abstract roles,
classes and objects'.  He asked rhetorically what was the use of
an interface which doesn't give a guarantee.  Trey Harris responded
that there are three ways to manage a guarantee: an 'is abstract' marker,
some type of inference, or by disallowing abstract classes.  Jonathan
Lang offered his definition of 'instance management'.</p>

<p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/4744aeb9ca34ad77/9621190b8a61f4bd?#9621190b8a61f4bd">Automatic coercion and context</a> </i> </p>
<p>Joshua Choi asked how coercion interfaces are implemented and implicitly used.
Musings on roles and the terror of implicit coercions in C++ were part of the discussion, but surprisingly the <code>as</code> multi method was not mentioned at all.</p>

<p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/56eeca9620d8c054/7f1d0eae0add6e96?#7f1d0eae0add6e96">&quot;Don&#39;t tell me what I can&#39;t do!&quot;</a> </i> </p>
<p>Jonathan Lang initiated a long discussion by objecting to programming
styles where a programmer can intentionally prevent someone else from
taking what is otherwise a legitimate action.  He cited an example from
the recent discussion on allowing a role to prevent the consumption of
another role ('<a href="%2345101204.30301@barco.com">class interface of roles</a>').</p>

<p>There was a suggestion that restrictions could be purely advisory.
This led to the question of whether strict is localized.  Larry
Wall replied that the default is for lexically scoped pragmas, but
that S01 states that it must be possible to write policy meta models.
More discussion on this topic followed.</p>

<p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/2f43e32bf6a7bd02/34884648d07da9e6?#34884648d07da9e6">Mailing list archive and index</a> </i> </p>
<p>Aaron Sherman posted that he was considering creating an archive
of messages from the mailing list which would be easier to search
than Google.  The problem with the Google archive is that it includes
discussion, and he's only interested in decision.  He asked for
opinions on the examples he posted.  Darren Duncan suggested seeding
from the existing mailing list archives.</p>

<p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/91e2429cb2c83db8/490443168ac1472b?#490443168ac1472b">[svn:perl6-synopsis] r12675 - doc/trunk/design/syn</a> </i> </p>
<p>In this commit, Audrey Tang removed the 'single argument function
becomes a method' rule from S12.</p>

<p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/44da334b50327b2f/5677b227f01801bf?#5677b227f01801bf">if-else and statement-ending blocks?</a> </i> </p>
<p>Markus Laire quoted a section of S04 on lines ending with
<code>}</code> followed by nothing but whitespace or comments.
He wondered if this meant that an else statement like<br>
<code>};</code> <br>
<code>else {</code> <br>
would be the same as the same without the semicolon.</p>

<p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/d355d3f43066cab7/a453551c61672b64?#a453551c61672b64">import collisions</a> </i> </p>
<p>Jonathan Lang wanted to know what would happen if
he imported two modules which export the same method.
He felt that the resolution should be similar to role
composition techniques.  He suggested some syntax.
Aaron Sherman thought that only plain multis would
conflict, and suggested a warning would be most
appropriate.</p>

<p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/cc8d66d3b7337151/ff17a3abeff489d9?#ff17a3abeff489d9">Hash composers and code blocks</a> </i> </p>
<p>Aaron Sherman quoted a section from S04 on the hash
composer.  He was afraid that the current syntax could lead
to 'looks fine to the uninitiated' errors.  He suggested
providing an unambiguous form for all the sigiled types.
He elaborated on his proposal.</p>

<p>Earlier, Will Coleda  posted an attempt at creating a perlcritic test.
This week, Chris Dolan created a patch to simplify the test code by
using Test::Perl::Critic.</p>

<p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/f8e44e8d3afe4d76/add13d9febb70f69?#add13d9febb70f69">requirements gathering on mini transformation language</a> </i> </p>
<p>Last week,
Allison Randal asked for a volunteer to write up the requirements
for a mini transformation language to use the compiler tools.
The job would involve spending time with Allison and Patrick
Michaud and combining their ideas along with your own perspective.
Adriano Ferreira offered some opinions on the subject, and
Markus Triska volunteered to do it if it relates to his area of
expertise.</p>

<p>This week, Aaron Sherman expressed confusion over the purpose of
this project.  He thought TGE performed this task.  chromatic replied
that the mini language would be "the stuff in curly braces" in the
TGE grammar files.</p>

<p>Adriano Ferreira named some desired features in a transformation
language, such as a data structure pattern language, and rules which
are selected via the patterns.</p>

<p>Allison reported that there were several volunteers.</p>

<p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/e942afb4a4f51fed/dc62aa4adb29f69c?#dc62aa4adb29f69c">[svn:parrot-pdd] r14784 - trunk/docs/pdds/clip</a> </i> </p>
<p>Last week, Jonathan Worthington committed a draft PDD on Parrot's
bytecode format.  Ben Morrow wanted to know if pbc files could allow an
optional <code>#!</code> line so that they could be used as executables.  Jonathan
replied that he had considered this, but rejected it because it is
UNIX-specific.  There was additional discussion on the topic.</p>

<p>This week, Karl Forner suggested working around the need to specify
the absolute path by using the <code>env</code> command.</p>

<p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/5bbf1eab0133d467/c2d272593c52ff39?#c2d272593c52ff39">[perl #40443] Separate vtable functions from methods (using :vtable) </a> </i> </p>
<p>In ticket <a href="http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=40443">[perl #40443]</a>, Matt Diephouse noted that it was decided
at OSCON 2006 that vtables and methods should be separated.  This is the
request for this modification.</p>

<p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/85162f1a08705092/34c9913450240b7a?#34c9913450240b7a">Can I use Parrot&#39;s subsystems in an embedded code?</a> </i> </p>
<p>Nikolay Ananiev is working on a C project which will embed Parrot.
He'd like it to be as portable as Parrot, and wondered if there was
some way he could take advantage of Parrot's portability.</p>

<p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/ab393c31a9cd10f7/a507ea71fce655fd?#a507ea71fce655fd">Questions about FixedBooleanArray and ResizeBooleanArray</a> </i> </p>
<p>Karl Forner was unable to find detailed specifications for the
FixedBooleanArray and ResizeBooleanArray PMCs and was wondering what
should happen if they were resized.  Leopold Toetsch replied that
the FixedBooleanArray won't resize, and specified what the default
values should be.</p>

<p>Some additional questions were asked in
'<a href="%231a83bc10610041649r6b9bb7eep5356be79437da4be@mail.gmail.com">[#39063 and #40066] boolean arrays</a>'.</p>

<p>Bob Rogers announced that as of r14830, continuations capture the
dynamic environment in order to restore it properly on invocation.
He also noted that moving the <code>control_stack</code> slot broke coroutines,
but that he suspected this was due to problems with coroutines.  He
asked to know if any problems with coroutines developed.  Fran&ccedil;ois Perrad
replied that he'd been unable to implement coroutines in Lua.
Bob Rogers was not surprised, and discussed some of the problems involved.</p>

<p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/5f0661eae5853e4a/ec8a54e0638b494c?#ec8a54e0638b494c">Emacs/vim code coda placement</a> </i> </p>
<p>Paul Cochrane reported that the Perl::Critic policy for the coda
skips <code>__END__</code> and <code>__DATA__</code> sections, but vim requires the coda
to be within the first or the last 5 lines of the file.
Chris Dolan agreed with Paul that using <code>=cut</code> for POD in the
<code>__END__</code> section would work, but was not sure how to handle <code>__DATA__</code>.
Will Coleda approved putting the coda after the <code>__END__</code>.</p>

<p>Aaron Sherman sent a patch which was requested on IRC.  It contains
code which executes the parser on a sample string and dumps the parse
tree; it checks the speed of PGE.  chromatic reported difficulties in

<p>Karl Forner wrote that he has been working on FixedBooleanArray and
ResizeableBooleanArray.  Ticket <a href="http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=40066">[perl #40066]</a> indicated they
needed to be rewritten.  He also looked at bug <a href="http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=39063">[perl #39063]</a>
on ResizeableBooleanArray using 64 bytes per bit.  He thought that
it would be best to rewrite the PMC.  He had a few questions on
what was desired in an implementation.  Bernhard Schmalhofer and
Leopold Toetsch tried to answer the questions.</p>

<p>From this, Karl concluded that the best solution might be to use
an external lib.  He also described two other possible approaches.</p>

<p>Last week, Jonathan Worthington committed a draft of the Bytecode
PDD and Leopold Toetsch offered comments.</p>

<p>Bernhard Schmalhofer wondered if the 'UUID' field should be named
