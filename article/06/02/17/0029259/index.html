<p>There's a new feature in Slash: promotion of journals to story.  When you post your journal, you should now see a checkbox to "Submit" your journal entry as a story.  If you click that, then your journal entry will end up as a submission for the editors to post, or not.</p>
<p>You must enable comments in order to submit your journal, and once submitted, it cannot be unsubmitted.  If accepted as a story, and you set your discussion to "No Foes," the discussion will then be open to everyone.  Changes you make to the journal entry will not be reflected in the story.  You can delete your journal entry, but you cannot delete the discussion, which will be tied to both the journal and the story.<br> <br>Don't just submit every journal you post.  We'll get annoyed.  Just use this for news items, or items of general Perl interest.  Use your best judgment.</p>

I may be wrong about this, but I've just written a journal entry and I don't think I hit the new checkbox.<br><br>However, I can see that my entry is now "pending"...<br><br>It shouln't be! I don't want it to be! It's my journal entry! Give it back!<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

I am pretty sure you did check the checkbox.  I see no reason why it would've been submitted otherwise.  No one else had theirs submitted.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br>

Actually, I found yesterday that, at least on this browser, clicking the mouse anywhere on the same line as the box selects it... don't ask me why, but it does, and this behaviour has made me select the box a couple of times now...

Yes, please please please move this annoying checkbox out of the way. I always accidently click on it (or rather the line it's on) a few times per writeup. You see, I tend to click outside the textarea to make my arrow keys scroll the whole window instead of just the textarea. And that is apparently a particularly popular place for me to click on. Likely because it's so large and pristine.<br><br>Perhaps put it above the journal entry, perhaps even above the subject line, or otherwise, below the submit button?<br><br>Funny, the "No Karma Bonus" checkbox doesn't behave the same way. (I'm using Firefox 1.5.0.1.) I actually have to click on the little checkbox square itself before it changes. And that's the way it should be, especially for such an intrusive checkbox. So, what's different between these two?

I don't know what the difference is.  But it seems totally wrong of Firefox to do this.  It's very simple markup:<blockquote> <div><tt>&lt;label&gt;Submit&lt;input type="checkbox" name="submit" &gt;&lt;/label&gt;</tt></div> </blockquote>Maybe it's the LABEL tag, but still, it should only select it if you click on the checkbox.<br><br>

<h2>How to not see</h2>

How do I turn off the journals from showing up as stories on the front page?



<blockquote>

<h2>Re:How to not see</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/pudge/">pudge</a> on 2006-02-22T15:32:28</h3>
You don't.  And why would you want to?  A journal submitted as a story to the front page will be treated just like any other story submission, put into the section appropriate to that section, and so on.  It's just another way to submit a story.

<h2>Re:How to not see</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/modred/">modred</a> on 2006-02-22T15:40:27</h3>
So I don't read it twice? Not a huge deal but if I don't notice that it was posted from a journal and then I go read the journals I'll get that strange sense of deja vu.

Hm.  No really good way to do it, that I can see, though.  Unless you read all journals, seems kinda silly to assume you've seen it just because it is a journal.  That said, I'll think on it a bit.<br>
