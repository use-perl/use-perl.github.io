<p><p>
The Third Italian Perl Workshop is confirmed and being worked on. You'll see updates in <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/dakkar/journal/">my journal</a>, in newsgroups (at least <tt>it.comp.lang.perl</tt>), and on the <tt>#nordest.pm</tt> IRC channel on slashnet.
</p></p>
<p><p>This workshop aims to be less "conference" and more "let's exchange ideas": in addition to the classic talks, we are asking participants to propose discussion themes: the organizers will select some and choose some experts on the topic; the participants will then be able to exchange experiences, points of view, and suggestions.</p>
<p>Another important point: participation is free of charge. You could just barge in at any time (you'd probably be asked to avoid interrupting talks or discussion, though); at any rate, we would much better like for any participant to register in advance, so as to have at least an idea of the numbers we'll be dealing with.</p>
<p>More details can be found at the <a href="http://conferences.yapceurope.org/ipw2006/">web site</a>, kindly hosted by the YAPC Europe Foundation. Registrations are not yet open, but will be soon (seems no one explained to the ACT framework about free-of-charge registrations <tt>:-/</tt>).</p></p>

<h2>Registrations and submissions now open</h2>

Ok, I just now activated submissions. Registrations were, in fact, open: what you can't do at the moment is request the "business ticket" or confirm your participation (ACT requires a payment for that, but the ACT team is working on the issue).
