</p><p>As the changes Yves Orton made to the regular expression engine get
worked over by the smoke testers and other more adventurous souls,
a couple of problems have come to light.</p>
<p>Nicholas Clark found that the following snippet caused a segfault
during global destruction.</p>
<pre>
  $a = qr/(xx|yy)/;
  sub a {'xx' =~ $a and print 'ok'};
  threads-&gt;new(\&amp;a)-&gt;join();</pre>
<p>Yves fixed that up with a one-line change (a reference counting
adjustment).</p>
<pre>
  Ha ha ha plonk
  <a href="http://xrl.us/nnup">http://xrl.us/nnup</a> </pre>

<p>Dave Mitchell caught another one, simply by running a build and
watching <code>ext/re/t/regop.pl</code> lose it, which Rafael Garcia-Suarez
corrected with a guard to <code>re_debug_flags</code>, but wondered why it
was being set to <code>NULL</code> in the first place. Answer: it happens
during global destruction.</p>
<pre>
  Changing of the guards
  <a href="http://xrl.us/nnuq">http://xrl.us/nnuq</a> </pre>
<p>Jarkko Hietaniemi found some other problems with the trie code on
Tru64 in conjunction with <code>-DDEBUGGING</code>. After a quick examination,
Yves couldn't find a good explanation why, but suggested a couple
of nice places for setting breakpoints.</p>

<p>After running down a few dead ends, Jarkko finally narrowed the
problem down to taking the address of something on the stack.
Hoisting the declaration outwards fixed the problem.</p>
<pre>
  A class of his own
  <a href="http://xrl.us/nnur">http://xrl.us/nnur</a> </pre>
<p>Yves made an appeal for more tests that exercise Unicode pattern
matching. Not the funky, contrived examples that the porters
come up with to exercise obscure parts of the code base, but
real honest-to-goodness matches that happen in Real Life.</p>
<pre>
  If you test it, they will come
  <a href="http://xrl.us/nnus">http://xrl.us/nnus</a> </pre>
<p>Tels came back with some late comments on the trie enhancements.
Yves had an answer to all of the questions, going so far as to
suggest that a nice optimisation would be to convert patterns
consisting of a single <code>EXACT</code> node to an <code>index()</code> call, thereby
avoiding <code>regmatch()</code> altogether.</p>

<pre>
  Avanti!
  <a href="http://xrl.us/nnut">http://xrl.us/nnut</a> </pre>

  The unguarded moment
  <a href="http://xrl.us/nnuu">http://xrl.us/nnuu</a> </pre>
<p>Dave Mitchell also did some more follow-up work on his efforts to
remove recursion from the regular expression engine.</p>

  <a href="http://xrl.us/nnuv">http://xrl.us/nnuv</a> </pre>

<p>
<h2> <a name="could_perl_get_reversible_debugging">Could Perl get Reversible Debugging?</a> </h2>
</p><p>Adam Kennedy had recently encountered two discussions of reversible
debugging, and wondered how plausible this could be for Perl.
(Reversible debugging is the idea of being able to undo the previous
``r''un or ``n''ext statement, and recover the previous state. (History
trivia: Roedy Green wrote a language called Abundance in the 70s
that provided support for this mechanism. He called it jaunting)).</p>
<p>Randy W. Sims thought that a system that merely recorded the current
system state by snapshot would be good enough. You could not go
back in time and change things, but you could at least look at them
again.  Useful if you missed something.</p>
<p>Some things cannot be reversed anyway: system calls, network writes,
different paths might cause cleanup handlers to never be called.</p>
<p>Jesse pointed to Leon Brocard's <code>Devel::ebug</code>, which offers an
<code>undo</code> mechanism. Mark-Jason Dominus mapped out the different
points on the continuum, showing what was easy, simple and fairly
useless all the way to difficult, hard and very useful, but we
should be able to get something good at a reasonable cost. His
suggestion was to teach the debugger to record all the commands
during a session, and then allow one to restart the session, replaying
all the commands up to some point in the stream.</p>

<p>Richard Foley explained that this latter trick was already available
in the current debugger. It's called <code>rerun</code>.</p>
<p>David Nicol suggested forking a new copy of the program at each
perl statement, and communicate between the prior state processes
to determine the difference in state. This would of course entail
immense resource costs. Alternately, a fork and dump on each statement
would merely chew disk space, instead of RAM. But at the end of the
thread, Adam came back and explained that he didn't really care to
go back and re-execute the program from a given point. He just
wanted to be able to go back and look at what had happened as a
disinterested observer (a bit like TV).</p>
<pre>
  We need a &quot;come from&quot; instruction
  <a href="http://xrl.us/nnuw">http://xrl.us/nnuw</a> </pre>
<p>
<h2> <a name="new__improved_perlbrowse">New, improved <code>perlbrowse</code> </a> </h2>

</p><p>Dave Mitchell announced a new release of the <code>perlbrowse</code> tool,
that allows the porters to look at the source code from the point
of view of the repository, and view the changes made to the code
base over time.</p>
<pre>
  Whiter than #ffffff
  <a href="http://xrl.us/nnux">http://xrl.us/nnux</a> </pre>
<p>
<h2> <a name="big_perl_5_advocacy_thread">Big Perl 5 advocacy thread</a> </h2>
</p><p>One of the biggest threads to hit p5p in months, which goes to
show that there's still interest in the beast.</p>
<p>Yves Orton kicked off the thread, writing about the problem of
Perl 5 and Perl 6 and it sounded like a replay of the Osborne
Effect (Adam Osborne built a phenomenally successful portable
computer in the 1980s, and preannounced the arrival of a new
faster model. People stopped buying the current model, waiting
for the new one to be released. The competition ate the company).</p>

<p>Some of the main points:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We need to get 5.10 out the door.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A Seal of Approval for qualifying CPAN modules.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Send Andy Lester some papers that he can publish on <code>perlfoundation.org</code>.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Perl is a write-only language. Parentheses, no parenthesis, <code>or</code>
<em>versus</em> <code>||</code>. (This subthread pushed Tom Christiansen into
penning a couple of missives).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At least two technical book publishers consider that the Perl market is done.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Perl sucks as a desktop applications language (think: <code>Tk</code>, <code>perlWx</code>).

<code>Tk</code> looks ancient, <code>perlWx</code> documentation sucks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> <code>gettext</code> doesn't work very well if the initial language is not English
and you want to add a English translation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Installing Perl on Windows should be as easy as installing Firefox plug-ins.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Prerequisites specifications for CPAN modules sucks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Perl releases are slowing down, as are new language enhancements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Core support for Win32 sucks.</p>
</li>
</ul>

</p><p>Rafael added the <code>DOES</code> method to <code>UNIVERSAL</code> following on from
chromatic's desire several weeks ago to try and make <code>UNIVERSAL</code>

more useful, or rather, less abused. He then hinted that chromatic
was probably in the best place to write the appropriate documentation.</p>
<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/nnu5">http://xrl.us/nnu5</a> </pre>

</p><p>Dave Mitchell observed that this failure ``was caused by the interesting
fact that a detached thread still counts towards the <code>A thread

<p>Ravi Sastry Kadali, from the <strong>IBM zOS USS Development team</strong> reported

to the source, and wanted to contribute them back to the porters.</p>

send the required changes back for integration. These changes can then

of pluggable regexp engines for <code>maint</code>. The problem is one of
a bad design call, made in the distant past, for which Nicholas
Clark is pondering a ``deeply evil'' workaround.</p>
<p>Tels also replied, with a plug for his <code>Math::String</code> module,
that lets one perform automagical increments (and decrements)
on just about anything that looks incrementable. And if it
doesn't work with Unicode, file a bug report so that Tels can
fix it.</p>
