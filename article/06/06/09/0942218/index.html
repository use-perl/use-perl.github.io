<h2> <a name="on_unevalable_code">On un-<code>eval</code>-able code</a> </h2>
</p> <p>Peter Valdemar M&#248;rch ran into a curious problem with <code>die</code>ing code, which
when wrapped in an <code>eval</code>, apparently <code>die</code>s as well, however, nothing was
captured in <code>$@</code>. This only occurs when perl runs out of file handles.</p>
<p>Dave Mitchell saw that <code>Carp</code> overwrites <code>$@</code> all by itself if it fails
to load <code>Carp::Heavy</code>, and so he put a stop to that, and also tweaked
<em>pp_ctl.c</em> to deal with running out of file handles in a more
graceful manner.</p>

with an attempt by Jarkko Hietaniemi to provide a test suite that would
work in a suitably safe cross-platform manner. Craig A. Berry weighed in with
some information on the quirks the VMS brings to the party.</p>

<h2> <a name="redoing_part_of_change__27374">Redoing part of change #27374</a> </h2>
</p> <p>Back in March, H.Merijn Brand checked in some changes to
<em>Porting/checkcfgvar.pl</em> to teach it about VMS's <em>configure.com</em>.
Abe Timmerman discovered that the DCL code in question doesn't run
too happily on VAX/VMS 7.2 and suggested an improvement, however,
he then saw compiler errors in <em>globals.c</em> due to conflicting
definitions of variables.</p>
<p>Craig A. Berry was happy to see this level of care and attention
being devoted to the VAX, and explained how to debug the problem.
John E. Malmberg also provided some information on how to trace
back from the error message to the source (which involves a
certain amount of unwinding of included header files).</p>

caching mechanism calling <code>getcwd()</code>, and wondered what to do about it.</p>

<h2> <a name="documenting_how_the_regexp_engine_works">Documenting how the regexp engine works</a> </h2>
</p> <p>Having spent a fair amount of time under the hood of the regular
expression engine recently, Yves Orton started to document his
understanding of how it works, and asked for feedback. Several
people made some suggestions.</p>
<p>Notably, Dave Mitchell wanted the documentation to make it clear
that it was a  "this is sort of how it works, more or less, today,
maybe a bit" type document, and not something that people could
construe as a guarantee, and therefore use it as an API, forever
condemning the future porters to maintaining the behaviour in a
compatible manner.</p>
<p>Marvin Humphrey hoped that the information provided would be
sufficient for an XS author to figure out how to execute a
regular expression directly from C.</p>
<pre>

  <a href="http://xrl.us/m7eu">http://xrl.us/m7eu</a> </pre>

<h2> <a name="using_the_ahocorasick_pattern_matching_algorithm">Using the Aho-Corasick pattern matching algorithm</a> </h2>
</p> <p>Yves then shipped a masterful patch, to add another alternative
for the engine to use to find matches. The fact that he dared delve
into <code>intuit_start</code> deserves a round of applause. But before people
could do anything, Yves withdrew the patch, having spotted a way
to improve it.</p>

<h2> <a name="what_are_legal_characters_inside___xxxx_">What are legal characters inside <code>$(xxxx)</code>?</a> </h2>
</p> <p>John E. Malmberg wanted to know what <code>$(xxxx)</code> could be expected to contain,
since it turns out that on an OpenVMS ODS-5 filesystem, <code>./$(xxxx)</code> is a
perfectly valid filename, and he was worried that Perl would try to
interpret in odd ways, or rather, a <code>make</code>-like utility might have a bit
of trouble with it.</p>
<p>Craig A. Berry responded, saying that he thought that John had stumbled
across a weird interaction between Perl and VMS's DCL parsing and macro
expansion, and wanted to know where and why the problem arose.</p>
<p>John explained that, while the system had worked adequately up until now,
the advent of ODS-5 filesystems changes things somewhat, and he wanted
to see how a Unix filename encoded in UTF-8 would be handled in this
brave new world.</p>

<h2> <a name="tied_scalar_references__aren_t_"> <code>tied</code> scalar references (aren't)</a> </h2>
</p> <p>Dave Mitchell reported a problem that had surfaced on Perlmonks,
in that when a reference is tied, after the first call to <code>FETCH()</code>,
the code in <code>pp_entersub</code> and <code>pp_rv2sv</code> have code that accidentally
on purpose short-circuits <code>FETCH</code> from being called again, thus
stopping the usual <code>tie</code> mechanism from operating.</p>
<p>Nicholas Clark considered the issue, and concluded that while the
current behaviour was broken, and that it while it was clear what
the correct behaviour should look like, fixing it would not be easy.</p>
<p>The problem is that magic needs to be invoked only once when reading
or writing a variable. For ordinary scalars, this works fine, but
for references, it doesn't work, because there is nowhere to squirrel
away the necessary flag to determine whether or not to invoke magic.
And if fixing it means that magic might get called twice, the result
is likely to be even worse than failing to calling it once.</p>

</p> <p>This failure, on one of Abe Timmerman's boxes, was caused by
<code>Compress::Zlib</code>'s test suite, and for some reason, a scalar that
was supposed to be holding the name of a file in which to capture
<code>STDERR</code> was empty. Paul Marquess asked for the verbose output of
the tests, so see what was going wrong.</p>
<p>Nicholas Clark wondered whether the tests would fail in a similar
fashion if the variable held a single newline character, as he
recalled that on VMS, newlines will sometimes wind up where Unix
people wouldn't expect to find them. Craig A. Berry ran the tests
on some other equipment, but couldn't reproduce the failures. On
the other hand, he did notice that <em>autosplit.ix</em> might be not
wind up in the right place.</p>

</p> <p>Nicholas Clark thanked Dave Mitchell for the <code>eval</code> leak plugging,
and reported that the only way he was able to make perl leak on bad
code was with <code>1; use abc</code> and a downright evil <code>BEGIN {$^H{a}++};
1; use 6</code>.</p>
<p>Dave Mitchell scoffed at this feeble attempt and added a
<code>SAVEDESTRUCTOR_X</code> function to deal with cleaning up the parse
stack if it fails prematurely. He was brave enough to announce that
that should be the end of the <code>eval</code> leaks.</p>

</p> <p>Mark Martinec reported this problem early May. Andreas Koenig moved
the issue forward by using his binary-chop compilation technique
to trace the problem back to a change made by Jarkko in 2003.</p>

</p> <p>Andreas then wheeled the time machine out again, this time isolating the
problem to a patch from Gurusamy Sarathy in 2000. In doing so, he discovered
that an easy work-around consists of adding <code>$Data::Dumper::Useperl=1</code>,
which makes the problem go away (that is, use the pure-Perl rather than XS
version).</p>
<p>He also slimmed the test case down to reveal the peculiar differences
between left and right operands in numeric comparisons more clearly.</p>

<h2> <a name="definedness_of_substrings_disappear_over_repeated_calls___39247_"> <code>defined</code>-ness of substrings disappear over repeated calls (#39247)</a> </h2>
</p> <p>Martin at datacash discovered a problem with substrings in subroutines
losing their <code>pPOK</code>, which can lead to all sorts of bad things,
the least of which being scalars passed to <code>DBD::Mysql</code> being
treated as <code>NULL</code> when they are not.</p>
<p>Sadahiro Tomoyuki determined that change #20462, designed to fix
bug #23207, was the origin of the problem.  He was puzzled, however,
since when he reverted the change, while this fixed up Martin's
immediate problem, the original problem that that patch was meant to
fix didn't manifest itself. Which would mean it was fixed by another
unrelated patch.</p>
<pre>
  A twisty maze of changes, all alike
  <a href="http://xrl.us/m7fc">http://xrl.us/m7fc</a> </pre>
<p>On the other hand, when Martin did the same, the problem did show
up, which made him wonder a bit, until Tomoyuki explained that the
newly-unmasked bug shows up on 5.9.0, but no longer on versions
5.9.1 through 5.9.3. He also found the source of confusion: bug #24816,
which was fixed in blead with #22074, and later backported as change
#27391 in the maintenance track, solves both problems and thus #20462
can well and truly be reverted.</p>
<pre>
  Confused yet?
  <a href="http://xrl.us/m7fd">http://xrl.us/m7fd</a> </pre>
<p>All this made Martin wonder whether <code>DBD::Mysql</code> should be taking more
care with what gets passed to it, specifically, testing for magic as
well as <code>SvOK</code>, which would make it more robust.</p>
<p>Tomoyuki thought that perl's internals are far too complicated for
XS authors to be expected to deal with in all circumstances, and that
a better solution in the present case would be to store the substring
into a temporary scalar and pass that, instead of passing the substring
directly.</p>

useful back. Peter Dintelmann thought that <code>stat</code> was documented
as not doing anything useful with directory handles.</p>
