<p>After my <a href="__SLASHLINK__" sect="mainpage" sid="3177" sn="comments" tid="34">CPAN-compatible Win32 Perl</a> competition earlier this year, and my nursing of the bug-fixing efforts for the new Vanilla Perl, to my amusement people keep asking me when I plan to create win32.perl.org.<br> <br>So after an entire hour of development, I'm happy to announce the creation of <a href="http://win32.perl.org/">http://win32.perl.org/</a>, a community website that will act as a central location for everything Perl and Windows, with initial hosting donated by <a href="http://www.phase-n.com/">Phase N</a> (i.e. my corporate and tax-deductable incarnation)<br> <br>In the spirit of community, and because I'm not sure yet exactly what people are looking for in a Win32 Perl website, I have started by redirecting the front page straight into a wiki. As the site expands, I'll be adding more functionality beyond the raw wiki to add whatever additional functionality the community demands.<br> <br>If anyone would like to get involved, I'd be more than happy for your help. Please see the Request For Volunteers page on the wiki for things that need doing. And being a wiki, of course you are encouraged to be bold with your edits.</p>

<p>Nope, at least I did not get any redirect. All I got was a page saying "There is currently no content here, please check back later."</p>

<h2>some win32 perl distros</h2>

I added the ones from CPAN/ports#win32 you didn't have yet listed.<br>

Thanks for that. I keep finding there are distros I haven't heard of.

<h2>daydreaming</h2>

In my opinion a real Win32 Perl distribution would include a C compilation environment with it, e.g. MinGW - and the Perl would be compiled with that (and the Win32:: basics).  This way one would not need to have a repository of Win32 modules/PPMs/whatever, anywhere, but instead just download from CPAN and compile XS with abandon.<br><br>(Of course, to be suuuupernice this distribution would have to work nicely with Visual C 6, Visual.Net, Intel C++, and whatever people have...)<br><br>

There are indeed some distributions listed that meet the first of your two points.

<h2>Irony?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Lemgar/">Lemgar</a> on 2006-06-15T23:30:59</h3>
I'm all for using the best tool (or language) for the job, but does anyone else see the irony in using a php wiki on a site that should be a platform for perl advocacy?

Yes, there is an irony, but you may have a look at

Of course<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br><br>In fact, there front page even acknowledges your point.<br><br>It looks like we are going to be moving to SocialText in July after everyone is back from YAPC::NA.<br>

Even more irony: SocialText is <a href="/user/petdance/journal/29964" title="perl.org">not for Win32</a perl.org>. Currently.

And assuming someone is willing to run a Win32 server to host it on.<br><br>Because I sure as hell am not going to do it.<br><br>As much as I want to encourage Win32 Perl, I only use it as a desktop, and it would take a lot to convince me to use it on a server.<br>

Hmm, somehow something got lost in the message.<br><br>If you are not going to run it at home, why do you care that the site is in PHP?<br><br>Same thing. You want to showcase the site as something that Perl can do. Well, this is a site for Win32 Perl, so you really ought to be showcasing something that Perl/Win32 can do.<br><br>I hope I get the message across this time. And, if not... forget it, it's not important.

<h2>Re:Irony?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Alias/">Alias</a> on 2006-06-24T04:16:32</h3>
Well, I care about the fact it's currently in PHP, because web and wikis are something that Perl SHOULD do well, and so we should be doing it in Perl.<br><br>Hosting websites in a relatively cheap and decent mass hosting way, however, would appear to NOT be something that Win32 does well. So I'm in no hurry to move the website to Win32 hosting at 4-10+ times the price, because it serves no utility.<br><br>Perl should be the same on all platforms, and I don't feel that it's necesary for us to eat the dogfood in the hosting platform case.<br><br>But yes, let's move on.

However, I have nevered worked a wiki before.   Where do you find info on it?

You can do worse than look at the documentation pages of <a href="http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki" title="mediawiki.org">MediaWiki</a mediawiki.org>, the current wiki behind the site.
