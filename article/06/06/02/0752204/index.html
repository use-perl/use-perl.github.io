<p><a href="http://www.yapcchicago.org/">jmcada</a> writes <i>"Well, it's June so the countdown to YAPC::NA is on.  There are just over three weeks left until the conference begins.  If you were thinking about waiting to the last minute to <a href="http://www.yapcchicago.org/zencart">register</a>, that time has come.  Though we will officially take registrations up until the weekend before the conference, I'd advise you to register as early as possible.  It just makes things easier on all of us ;)"</i></p>
<p><i>"Why would you want to come to YAPC?  Well, probably because there are over sixty Perl talks crammed into three days of conference proceedings, all for only $100.
<br> <br>
If that's not enough, we have classes taught by Damian Conway, Randal Schwartz, and brian d foy on the two days immediately following the conference.  These classes cost only a small fraction of what you would typically have to pay.
<br> <br>
Still not convinced?  Well, if you are even thinking about a new job we are having a job fair during the conference.  Companies from around the country will be on site hunting for the best Perl programmers to join their teams.  Come for the conference, leave with a new gig.
<br> <br>
Want more?  How about what we think is one of the best swag bags for any YAPC to date?  Not only is the canvas bag nice, but the contents are pretty sweet too.  Rumor has it there is the latest copy of some <a href="http://www.theperlreview.com/">Perl magazine</a>, the latest distro of some version of <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Linux</a>, as well as, a some fun and games.
<br> <br>
Wow, you're not an easy sell are you?  Let me just say that we are working to make sure that this years banquet and auction have all of the bells, whistles, and blinking lights that you could imagine outside of Vegas.  Oh, speaking of the auction, this years auction will be full of great items including an entire week at the <a href="http://www.bignerdranch.com/">Big Nerd Ranch</a>, a couple of high-dollar electronic gadgets, a custom made collectible like you've never seen before (trust me, you'll want to be there for this one), as well as gobs of books donated from our many publisher friends.
<br> <br>
If that's not enough, remember that YAPC is in Chicago: the windy city, the city of broad shoulders, the city of the World Champion White Sox, the city of the Cubs, the city of deep dish pizza, the summer home of King Tut, the... well, you get the idea.
<br> <br>
See you in Chicago,<br>
Josh"</i></p>
