<h2> <a name="using__ifdef_inside_a_macro">Using <code>#ifdef</code> inside a macro</a> </h2>
</p><p>Discussion continued on this issue affecting <em>mg.c</em>. The essence
of the problem was a simple issue of the character used for separating
paths (such as <code>/</code> on Unix). Andy Dougherty suggested a way to
solve the problem upstream, at configure time. John E. Malmberg,
ever the devil's advocate, pointed out that this would be unlikely
to fly on VMS, since the path separator could either be <code>|</code>,
<code>:</code> or perhaps something else again, depending on from which shell
perl was being run.</p>

<h2> <a name="failing_0_9__of_the_time">Failing 0.9% of the time</a> </h2>
</p><p>Jerry D. Hedden traced a random random thread test failure down to
a problem that was a variant on the birthday party paradox: put
twenty people in a room, and there's a better than even chance that
two people share the same birthday. In a similar vein, the tests
would fail if a random number was generated twice.</p>
<p>The original issue was that all threads of a program would generate
the same sequence of random numbers, which is contrary to many
people's ideas of randomness. This has since been fixed, albeit with
the above side effect in the test suite. Jerry applied a quick fix
to bring the statistical likelihood of bogus failures from 0.9%
down to 0.003% by allowing one duplicate to occur.</p>
<p>Paul Johnson thought that accepting two or three duplicates would
ensure that the testing showed that the fix continued to work,
while pushing the threshold of failure down into the noise. Jerry
thought of another approach that would be even better still, but
considered that this current fix was good enough. Rafael Garcia-Suarez
applied the patch in any event.</p>

<h2> <a name="utf8_testing_black_smoke">UTF-8 testing black smoke</a> </h2>
</p><p>A recent change (#28528 - abolishing <code>cop_io</code>) has caused lots of
black smoke to issue forth from the smoke boxes. Nicholas Clark
cleaned up a number of problems, but he wasn't sure what the best
way was to correct a couple of the remaining failures.</p>
<p>Sadahiro Tomoyuki suggested one way. The problem is still unsolved.
It boils down to a question that anyone with a bit of Perl
knowledge could solve: how to tell the test harness that two
different outputs can be valid, expected output.</p>

<h2> <a name="compiling_mod_perl_on_suse_linux_10_1">Compiling <code>mod_perl</code> on Suse Linux 10.1</a> </h2>
</p><p>Torsten Foertsch was having great difficulty dealing with the
<code>#define</code>s and <code>#ifdef</code>s in <em>perl.h</em> and was unable to compile <code>mod_perl</code>.
The problem was figuring out what macros expanded into, and whether one
could typecast the macros and have it work as expected. Apparently not,
because on some platforms, the macro expands into C code that looks like
<code>if(1) ...</code>.</p>

</p><p>Rafael has been using the new defined-or operator in <code>blead</code>, and

<code>use feature 'err'</code>. After a while he grew tired of this, and
added <code>dor</code> as an alias for <code>err</code>.</p>

<h2> <a name="action_queues_as_an_action_item">Action queues as an action item</a> </h2>

</p><p>David Nicol wanted to know whether his people were interested in
pursuing his idea of a queue-based
mechanism for dealing with signal management and possibly other
stuff.</p>
<p>Nicholas ruled out any changes to the signal code in the
maintenance branch. He also remarked that there might be a race
condition between one thread receiving a signal, and another
thread draining the queue, since, when a signal is received,
there not enough context to determine which interpreter should
handle it. And it would be very hard to solve this in a
portable manner.</p>
<p>David maintained that none of the problems were insurmountable.</p>

<h2> <a name="is_perl_s_bsearch_bug_free">Is Perl's <code>bsearch</code> bug free?</a> </h2>
</p><p>Dan Kogai wanted to know if Perl was not subject to the binary
search bug found by Joshua Bloch, who works at Google. The problem
is that a binary search works in part by taking the mid-point of a
high and low value, where the values are indices into the table
being searched.</p>
<p>This has usually been performed until now by adding the two values together
and dividing by two. There is a problem if the two values overflow
the maximum integer size, which happens when you have about a billion
elements in an array. This is becoming more and more frequent as
machines become deeper and faster.</p>
<p>Andy Dougherty confirmed that perl's Quicksort implementation as
it stands does have this problem. The fix is probably, as Joshua
suggests, to take the difference of the two values, divide that
by two, and add that to the low value. Nonetheless, a lot of
thought should be put into exploring the boundary cases (and
and even values, odd and even array sizes and so on) to make sure
nothing breaks.</p>

<p>Jan Dubois reminded people that even on 64-bit perls, the <code>av_*</code>
API uses <code>I32</code> for indices. But changing that causes a huge
ripple through the code base...</p>

<h2> <a name="dlopen___not_found"> <code>dlopen()</code> not found</a> </h2>
</p><p>David Wheeler posted an innocuous call for help to get Perl compiled
on a 64-bit Red Hat platform. It turned out that <code>Configure</code> lacked
the necessary smarts to figure out what library paths should be used.</p>
<p>Then followed a rather long discussion about Red Hat <code>spec</code> files,
the evils of 32- and 64-bit applications residing on the same box,
the extent to which which Linux distributors backported security
patches to older Perls and so on.</p>

<h2> <a name="the_range_operator______versus_unicode">The range operator (<code>..</code>) <em>versus</em> Unicode</a> </h2>
</p><p>Dan Kogai ruefully discovered that <code>..</code> doesn't work with Unicode.
For instance, <code>('a'..'z')</code> produces all the letters of the (ASCII)
alphabet, but the same cannot be said of <code>(&quot;\N{GREEK CAPITAL LETTER
ALPHA}&quot; .. &quot;\N{GREEK CAPITAL LETTER OMEGA}&quot;)</code>.</p>

<p>Even more surprising, though, was the fact that a simple work-around,
by way of a <code>map {chr}</code>, was all that was needed to make things
work.</p>
<p>Yitzchak Scott-Thoennes connected this issue to the definition of
the magic auto-increment operator and the fact that it is not geared
to dealing with this new-fangled Unicode stuff.</p>
<pre>
  $s = 'a';
  $s++; # now 'b'</pre>
<p>Dan was unhappily willing to accept that one could not create Unicode
ranges, in which case the documentation should be amended to spell
this out clearly. On the other hand, he was even more unhappy by
the fact that in regular expressions and transliterations, Unicode
ranges do work.</p>
<p>Rafael entertained the idea of prolonging the magic to allow:</p>
<pre>
  $s = &quot;\N{omega}&quot;;
  $s++; # now &quot;\N{alpha}\N{alpha}&quot;</pre>

<p>but thought that the results might prove to be entertaining in all
sorts of unforeseen ways.</p>
<p>Sadahiro Tomoyuki reminded people to very careful when dealing with
Greek letters, such as final sigma between rho and sigma, and that
stigma or digamma aren't treated as following epsilon. Or the
opposite, I'm not sure.</p>
<pre>
  It's all greek to me

<h2> <a name="a_better_ahocorasick__and_lots_of_benchmarks">A better Aho-Corasick, and lots of benchmarks</a> </h2>

</p><p>Yves Orton sent in a new, improved patch for adding the Aho-Corasick
pattern matching algorithm to the regular expression engine. He
also bundled a <em>perl_bench.pl</em> program that he had developed to
benchmark multiple Perl versions.</p>
<p>Yves thought that some of the observed slowdown in 5.9.4 might be
due to Dave Mitchell's work in eliminating recursion from the engine.
Nonetheless, he was optimistic about the situation, saying that
there is a lot of room for improvements, and was targeting being
at least as fast as 5.6.1.</p>
<p>In a followup, he rejigged the code and had the performance running
faster than Python (not that we're competing or anything).</p>
<p>Yves develops on Windows, using MSVC as his main compiler, and as
such, unwittingly used some MSVC-isms that gave <code>gcc</code> and other
compilers indigestions. Other porters came to the rescue and
straightened it all out.</p>

showed that the patch disagreed with threads, and produced a new
version.</p>
<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/nf3i">http://xrl.us/nf3i</a> </pre>

</p><p>This appeared to be a curious bug on the surface, dealing as it
did with doubly-indirected arrays. H.Merijn Brand noted that this
no longer dumped core in <code>blead</code>, instead contenting itself to
bail out with a cryptic <code>Bizarre copy of UNKNOWN in aelem</code>.</p>

<p>Graham Barr was the first to realise that the reason was due to
the fact an in-place sort was being performed, and assigning the
results to another array made it work. Salvador Fandi&#241;o then
correctly identified the optimisation that was causing things to
go wrong: you cannot refer to the contents of the array within
the comparator during an in-place sort.</p>
<p>Dave Mitchell saw how to fix it, and said he would do so when he
had a few spare moments.</p>

</p><p>This overdue summary was written by David Landgren.</p>

<p>Last week's summary, here:</p>
<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/nf4p">http://xrl.us/nf4p</a> </pre>
<p>was carefully read by Dr. Ruud, who was kind enough to point to a
webbed version of a <code>c.l.p.m</code> thread discussing Unicode matters
that I mentioned I was not was not able to access, where, it appears
that ``It seems that utf8 extends the core perl parser in some
interesting ways.''</p>
<p>Sadahiro Tomoyuki explained what was going on, and Dr. Ruud started
to look through the other <code>encoding</code> bugs to see if they were
manifestations of a related cause. Tomoyuki pointed out yet another
bizarre Unicode inconsistency, dealing with Unicode-encoded
variable names.</p>
<p>If you want a bookmarklet approach to viewing bugs and change
reports, there are a couple of bookmarklets that you might find
useful on my page of Perl stuff:</p>
