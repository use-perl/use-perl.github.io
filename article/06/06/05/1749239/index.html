<h2> <a name="scalar__util__weaken__to_have_or_have_not"> <code>Scalar::Util::weaken</code>, to have or have not</a> </h2>
</p> <p>There was further discussion of the XS version of <code>Scalar::Util</code>
and the fact that it offers a <code>weaken</code> function which is vital to
avoid resource leaks when freeing self-referential structures.
(Specifically, it offers a method from Perl-space to intervene
directly on the underlying mechanism used for managing garbage
collection).</p>
<pre>
  There were five philosophers at a table
  <a href="http://xrl.us/mxwq">http://xrl.us/mxwq</a> </pre>
<p>Adam Kennedy proposed <code>Task::Weaken</code> as an elegant way (insofar
as a wart may be considered elegant) of dealing with the problem
of trying to create a dependency on the particular <code>Scalar::Util</code>
version that happens to contain the <code>weaken</code> routine.</p>

<h2> <a name="following_up_on_thread_safety_issues_and_opcode_hints">Following up on thread safety issues and opcode hints</a> </h2>
</p> <p>Last month, Nicholas Clark discovered some obscure bugs that could
lead to race problems, with critical memory accesses not protected
by mutexes, or memory allocations going astray. He managed to sort
out a number of problems, and reported that there were a number of
issues that would need to be addressed.</p>

<h2> <a name="regular_expression_engine_improvements">Regular expression engine improvements</a> </h2>
</p> <p>Yves Orton ran a post-mortem on his recent work to convert <code>/[c]/</code> to <code>/c/</code>,
and realised that a lot of the difficulty can be traced back to the memory
allocation strategy used. By its very nature, the strategy rules out a
number of interesting optimisation possibilities, because a regexp is
built with a two-pass compilation, and during the second pass,
too much information has already been discarded, so at that point it is
already too late to be able to consider a certain number of transforms.</p>
<p>Save more information up front, and then you stand a better chance of
being able to apply some useful optimisations to the resulting opcodes.
Hugo van der Sanden wondered whether it would be possible to produce an
opcode stream that would be amenable to processing by the existing
peephole optimiser.</p>
<p>Yves wanted to push a lot of the smarts from <code>study_chunk</code> and <code>regtail</code>
into the parse phase. And wrapped up with a patch to tidy the debug
output somewhat, and improve the trie code.</p>
<pre>
  Gentlemen, study your engine
  <a href="http://xrl.us/mxwt">http://xrl.us/mxwt</a> </pre>
<p>Andy Lester wanted to add some consting goodness to <em>regcomp.c</em>
and <em>regexec.c</em>, which would have caused Yves considerable pain, since
he was in the middle of some deep core hackery, and didn't want to face
the nightmare of a three-way diff.</p>
<pre>
  Not now
  <a href="http://xrl.us/mxwu">http://xrl.us/mxwu</a> </pre>
<p>After that, Yves delivered a verily impressive patch of new, shiny goodness
to the regexp engine. And if that wasn't enough, he also took Andy's own
consting work and folded that in as well. After a bit of adjustment due to
other patches going into <code>blead</code> at the same time, Rafael managed to get
everything in place and running nicely.</p>

<h2> <a name="a_tutorial_on_unicode">A tutorial on Unicode</a> </h2>
</p> <p>Juerd Waalboer wrote a very nice tutorial to help people get started with
Unicode. A number of people contributed ideas and suggestions. Juerd
sifted through these and produced a second version. As we went to press,
inclusion in the core was pending.</p>

<h2> <a name="sprintf_and_tainted_format_strings"> <code>sprintf</code> and tainted format strings</a> </h2>
</p> <p>Dave Mitchell revisited the <code>sprintf('%n')</code> issue that made the
headlines back in December, and thought that it might be wise to
apply taint checks to the format string (the first argument to
<code>sprintf</code>, proposed a relaxed or strict interpretation to what
tainting would imply and asked for opinions on the matter.</p>
<p>Andy Lester favoured the strict approach (<em>any</em> use of a tainted
format string fails), but recalled that the idea had been dismissed
rapidly when put forward during the previous discussions. Steve
Peters thought that it was more a case of being set aside than
anything else, and expressed surprise at the fact that format
strings do not already have taint checking.</p>
<p>Rick Delaney wondered what exactly did Steve and Dave mean, and
put forward a couple of snippets to see if he understood the
issues.</p>

<h2> <a name="shooting_yourself_in_the_foot_with_overloading">Shooting yourself in the foot with overloading</a> </h2>
</p> <p>Jarkko Hietaniemi was led astray by a somewhat unhelpful <code>Use of
uninitialized value in hash element</code> warning caused by overloading,
and wondered if a better message could be generated if overloading
was involved.</p>
<p>While not directly answering Jarkko's question, Joshua ben Jore
mentioned that even more overloading fun can be had when using
<code>Devel::Cover</code>, since applying <code>defined</code> to an object will trigger
stringification there, but not during normal execution. Paul Johnson
was most surprised to hear this, and asked for a test case. David
Landgren provided a small example that exposes the problem.</p>
<p>Yves Orton confirmed that he had run into this problem when
developing <code>Data::Dump::Streamer</code>, and had had to jump through
considerable hoops to work around it.</p>

<h2> <a name="test_infrastructure_improvements">Test infrastructure improvements</a> </h2>
</p> <p>Yves Orton noticed a problem due a recent tweak to <code>Test::Harness</code>,
and fixed it so as to stop harness from printing the summary table
header for each row. Which does, it should be agreed, get tedious
after a while.</p>
<pre>
  No more excessive scrolling
  <a href="http://xrl.us/mxwz">http://xrl.us/mxwz</a> </pre>
<p>At about the same, Andy Lester changed <code>t/TEST</code> to queue up the
names of the tests that fail, to dump them at the end of the run.
This means one gets all the failing tests in one convenient chunk.</p>

<h2> <a name="more_goodness_from_andy">More goodness from Andy</a> </h2>
</p> <p>In his ongoing quest to const, Andy Lester sent in some refactoring
for <em>av.c</em>, which crushed some incorrect uses of <code>SvREFCNT_inc</code>,
removed unnecessary temporary variables and brought the usual
suspects into line.</p>
<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/mxw3">http://xrl.us/mxw3</a> </pre>

<h2> <a name="pod__html_should_not_convert_foo_to___foo__"> <code>Pod::Html</code> should not convert <code>&quot;foo&quot;</code> to <code>"foo"</code> </a> </h2>
</p> <p>Gisle Aas hated this mis-feature, since most modern fonts produce a
spectacularly ugly result. After a bit of a detour into the realm of
<code>troff</code>, it was decided to just use plain double-quotes instead.</p>

</p> <p>Jarkko found that S&#233;bastien Aperghis-Tramoni's tests in <em>Dynaloader.t</em>
were too platform-specific to be useful. After a bit of discussion it was
decided to loosen up the test which attempted to trap the message generated
when the loading of a non-existent shared library is attempted.</p>

</p> <p>This used to leak memory (that is, trying to <code>eval</code> a broken
subroutine definition). Dave Mitchell made it leak less. And then
after sitting back and looking at his handiwork, Dave made completely
water-proof.  Nicholas Clark still managed to poke a hole in it.
Unruffled, Dave countered with a King's Gambit that appeared to
keep any remaining errant allocations in cast-iron casing.</p>

</p> <p>Dave Mitchell had a look at the source code, and noted that there was
a race condition depending on whether the child dies before or after
the parent tries to write to it. Furthermore, there is no easy way to
fix the problem as is, which is why <code>IPC::Run</code> may be a better
alternative all round. Dave suggested a documentation patch to
clarify the situation.</p>

</p> <p>Mark-Jason Dominus was in the middle of configuring his <code>CPAN</code> client
when things started to go horribly wrong. Andreas Koenig wanted to have
a look at Mark's <em>MIRRORED.BY</em> file. Mark took one look at the file and
saw that it was corrupt (well, empty), and therefore knew what to do.</p>

</p> <p>Ted Pride had never noticed that <code>reverse</code> also works on scalars:</p>

specified. Andy Dougherty spotted what he thought was the cause
of the problem, but we didn't hear back from Sriram, so we don't
know if it's fixed.</p>

</p> <p>Benjamin Smith wished that <code>$]</code> or <code>$^V</code> were constant-folded. This
could be useful, because then one could include sections of code for
specific versions of Perl that would be optimised away at compile
time if not applicable. Unfortunately, since these variables are,
well, variable, and not constant (in other words, you may assign
to them), this isn't going to work.</p>
