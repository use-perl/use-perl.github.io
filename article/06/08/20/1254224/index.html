</p> <p>In <a href="http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=39750">[perl #39750]</a>, Jarkko Hietaniemi posted about a core dump. Will Coleda replied that this is how the test should behave, and wondered if the test should be skipped or the opcode removed. Chip Salzenberg wrote a haiku about the test, and Jarkko poetically requested that the test harness be informed about Parrot&#39;s tendency to obey suicide requests.

</p> <p>Jarkko Hietaniemi created another bug report, this time in ticket <a href="http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=39756">[perl #39756]</a>. This made Chip Salzenberg thing the test harness was ignoring segmentation faults, but Leopold Toetsch explained that it was Test::* TODO.

</p> <p>This thread was previously completely summarized in July.
</p> <p>Steven Pritchard reported that he had been working on building Fedora Extras packages for Parrot and Pugs and had a few issues on x86_64. Joshua Hoblitt asked if perhaps this was x86_64 with multilib support, as the current build system does not support multilib builds.
</p> <p>Attached to the same thread was ticket <a href="http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=39860">[perl #39860]</a> where Joshua Hoblitt requested that Configure.pl should accept <code>--libdir</code>. Later he attached a patch.

</p> <p>This thread was previously completely summarized in July.
</p> <p>Kevin Tew created ticket <a href="http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=39776">[perl #39776]</a> to report a PGE core dump. Patrick R. Michaud identified a possible syntax error. Chip Salzenberg wanted to know what the appropriate response was, a core dump or an exception.

</p> <p>This thread was previously completely summarized in July.
</p> <p>Matt Diephouse created ticket <a href="http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=39778">[perl #39778]</a> because trying to use an Iterator with a NameSpace makes Parrot segfault. Chip Salzenberg, Bob Rogers, Leopold Toetsch and Matt discussed how to fix it.

</p> <p>This thread was previously completely summarized in July.
</p> <p>In ticket <a href="http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=39856">[perl #39856]</a>, chromatic requested that Parrot be able to produce a single PBC file from a command like <code>parrot -o all_files.pbc file1.pir file2.pir ...</code>. Joshua Hoblitt thought it would be a good idea to define how symbol conflicts should be handled. Leopold Toetsch believed that <code>pbc_merge</code> can handle this, but Allison Randall explained that it doesn&#39;t quite address the request. Chip Salzenberg felt that was a bug, although Allison preferred to call it a feature. Jerry Gay clarified how it worked by citing documentation and including tests.
</p> <p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/a49c69ddce8762ad/00609a49d4ba9491?#00609a49d4ba9491">[perl #39905] [TODO] TGE - line number reporting.</a> </i>

</p> <p>Ticket <a href="http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=39905">[perl #39905]</a> was created by Will Coleda. Errors in an embedded PIR should be reported against the original .tg file rather than the generated PIR file. Patrick R. Michaud asked how this could be addressed, and Will included documentation.
</p> <p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/010befef394812a8/c8e19ec71201a442?#c8e19ec71201a442">[perl #39986] Create Default PackFile for New Interpreter (Parrot C API)</a> </i>
</p> <p>This thread was previously completely summarized in July.
</p> <p>chromatic created ticket <a href="http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=39986">[perl #39986]</a> to report that there is no default PackFile for the situation where he has created a new interpreter with <code>Parrot_new()</code> and wants to compile and run code through <code>Parrot_compile_string()</code> without having to read and load bytecode from disk.
</p> <p>It was reported that this was fixed in r13613, but chromatic had further questions. There was further discussion between chromatic, Leopold Toetsch and Chip Salzenberg. Chip requested some cleaning on namespace pollution, and Andy Lester replied that it is on his list.
</p> <p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/9693de802d3178f3/09b910b34f6d27f4?#09b910b34f6d27f4">Continuations and inferior runloops: Analysis and POC</a> </i>
</p> <p>Leopold Toetsch presented an analysis of the the inferior runloops problem - embedding foreign language runloops in the parrot runtime. The problems encompass continuation support and garbage collection amongst other things.
</p> <p>Bob Rogers replied proposing that foreign data be explicitly tracked. Leo mentioned that this has been previously discussed and dismissed.

</p> <p>This thread was previously completely summarized in July.
</p> <p>David Romano submitted a patch to clean up the regex tests taken from Perl 5. Jerry Gay raised the an issue with the data file being shared with Perl 5, after which David supplied an additional patch, moving todo/skip information to an outside file. Jerry applied.
</p> <p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/d8f836bbdabb13d2/79f1200b49fceb5d?#79f1200b49fceb5d">PGE/TGE and the future.</a> </i>
</p> <p>This thread was previously completely summarized in July.
</p> <p>Kevin Tew wanted information about TGE design goals and plans. Allison Randal replied that the plan is to have a single set of OST node classes used by all languages, a task Vishal Soni is currently at work on. She included a link to the first draft of the compiler tools plan, which Patrick R. Michaud is at work on updating so that it can be converted to a PDD.
</p> <p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/ce1b2dc365615d22/98345cd0f97d5fbd?#98345cd0f97d5fbd">[perl #40002] TGE Refactor / Compiler Tools Object</a> </i>
</p> <p>This thread was previously completely summarized in July.
</p> <p>Kevin Tew created ticket <a href="http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=40002">[perl #40002]</a> to ask a number of questions about the TGE refactor and cited several other tickets. There were some replies in August.
</p> <p>Patrick R. Michaud replied with information about the plans for TGE. Allison Randal and Patrick R. Michaud contributed summaries of a conversation they had at OSCON. Jerry Gay also commented.
</p> <p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/63de03bd4e8d9597/23870a6bdbc9e769?#23870a6bdbc9e769">resizablepmcarray, assign.</a> </i>
</p> <p>This thread was previously completely summarized in July.
</p> <p>Will Coleda included some code which was not working in Tcl. He thought the error originated in the Parrot code base, and asked some questions. Bob Rogers had difficulty replicating the problem; chromatic suggested using a newer Test::Harness because prove is not included in the older version. Leopold Toetsch felt this was in conflict with the Parrot README prerequisites list.
</p> <p>Will said that the problem was fixed in r13696. He also reported that Tcl&#39;s test suite is being converted from using Perl to being self-hosting in Tcl. Bob reported some additional problems in r13715. Will noted that Tcl was undergoing a lot of changes this week. There was some further discussion with Matt Diephouse on the Tcl changes.
</p> <p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/2ee473ef4d0ebeaa/a1110fcaf8b2983c?#a1110fcaf8b2983c">[perl #40030] [PATCH] compiler/imcc missing dependency</a> </i>

</p> <p>In <a href="http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=40030">[perl #40030]</a>, Fonseka reported some missing dependencies which were preventing compilation and provided a patch. In the end it turned out to be a problem with an old Parrot installation.
</p> <p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/f4bdc205c49c6864/2e1f21aac1daab7b?#2e1f21aac1daab7b">[perl #40032] [CAGE] no previous prototype</a> </i>
</p> <p>Will Coleda created ticket <a href="http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=40032">[perl #40032]</a> for the Cage Cleaners. The topic was a warning in <code>src/encodings/utf8.c</code>.

</p> <p>In ticket <a href="http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=40033">[perl #40033]</a>, Will Coleda reported a warning in function <code>Parrot_Continuation_invoke</code>. This was fixed in r13722.
</p> <p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/69264fa70f1968ea/65e1f7a3448bb613?#65e1f7a3448bb613">[Proposed PATCH lib/Parrot/Test/Embedded.pm] Use Embedded Interpreter for PIR Tests</a> </i>
</p> <p>chromatic posted a patch which adds a new test module. He wanted feedback on it. Leopold Toetsch had two questions about chromatic&#39;s methods, which chromatic answered.
</p> <p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/44dd966121a6bf36/8890fb9fdd716243?#8890fb9fdd716243">Questions</a> </i>
</p> <p>chromatic posted several questions that he needs answered before he can add Parrot::Embed to the repository. Most of the questions involved where it should be located and how it can be integrated with the rest of the build. Joshua Hoblitt had some suggestions, which led to a discussion between chromatic, Joshua and Chris Dolan.
</p> <p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/ea42007d02402f26/23cb8da598a3b864?#23cb8da598a3b864">[perl #40039] [BUG] r13762: compilers/bcg/ fails to build with msvc -- unresolved external symbol</a> </i>
</p> <p>Jerry Gay reported a bug with r13762 in ticket <a href="http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=40039">[perl #40039]</a>. Parrot was successfully built, but <code>compilers/bcg/</code> failed.
</p> <p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/f4ee0582598767a3/de4bb7e8fe5fcb62?#de4bb7e8fe5fcb62">[svn:parrot-pdd] r13740 - in trunk: . docs/pdds</a> </i>
</p> <p>Allison Randal modified the PDD21. The change was to make namespace opcodes accept arrays to enable multidimensional namespaces, and to remove redundant globals and get/set methods. Matt Diephouse asked how the removal of get/set methods would affect namespaces with a sigil or other unusual name. Allison replied that the methods were part of the untyped interface; the typed interface uses <code>find_namespace</code> and <code>add_namespace</code>.
</p> <p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/ab85e618b6f6f9fd/bb0f105e0bce2ecc?#bb0f105e0bce2ecc">Initialization and Finalization hooks</a> </i>
</p> <p>Kevin Tew discussed having BEGIN and END blocks be supported by Parrot. Leopold Toetsch replied that he thought END might be currently supported, and suggested looking at the last few tests in <code>t/pmc/exception.t</code> between revisions r13768 and r13770.
</p> <p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/ab5b07493cdb33d8/f67e0103e4cd926a?#f67e0103e4cd926a">Shared Lib fro Dynamic PMC</a> </i>
</p> <p>Vishal Soni wanted to know the best location to store a shared library for the byte code generator. chromatic thought it belonged in either <code>blib/lib</code> or <code>runtime/parrot/dynext</code> and wasn&#39;t sure which should be used in this case.
</p> <p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/242ea476f9fd25e8/bc8626257a0a86e2?#bc8626257a0a86e2">[perl #40048] [CAGE] t/distro/file_metadata.t doesn&#39;t like svk</a> </i>
</p> <p>Will Coleda created ticket <a href="http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=40048">[perl #40048]</a> to report that <code>t/distro/file_metadata.t</code> fails because every test assumes that you are using svn, but you could be using svk. chromatic submitted a patch.

</p> <p>Joshua Hoblitt noted that much of the build time is spent on <code>tools/build/pmc2c.pl</code> and <code>tools/build/c2str.pl</code>. He suggested limiting this process to maintainers only.
</p> <p> <i> <a href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.perl.perl6.compiler/938/focus=938">Parrot news: namespace ops good, (some) namespace methods bad; key-accepting ops</a> </i>
</p> <p>Chip Salzenberg notified the list that the namespace opcodes are now preferred over the methods. Allison Randal replied that a similar change needs to be made for lexicals. The naming convention for these routines was discussed.
</p> <p>Note: this thread is partly missing from Google&#39;s archives and is thus linked to gmane.

</p> <p>Chip Salzenberg wanted external functions and variables to have names that begin with <code>Parrot</code>. The request was added to the Cage Cleaners todo list. There was a brief discussion on storing Parrot tasks in the todo list versus storing them in RT.
</p> <p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/e32a072022b2eb6a/900b0a30b2ed7df6?#900b0a30b2ed7df6">Fix non-symbol-table namespace pollution in public headers</a> </i>
</p> <p>Chip Salzenberg noted that public headers in the <code>include/parrot</code> directory should not declare or define any symbol which isn&#39;t specific to Parrot. Symbols should be prefixed with <code>Parrot</code> or <code>PARROT</code>, although the exact syntax is up for debate.

</p> <p>In ticket <a href="http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=40058">[perl #40058]</a>, Chip Salzenberg stated that there is ambiguity between class names and class PMCs which should be resolved in a general way for all class-accepting opcodes. Martin D Kealey wanted to know why HLL namespaces should be treated differently from classes. chromatic replied that this was to protect against future additions to &#39;parrot&#39; breaking code.

</p> <p>Agent Zhang reported that S05 makes use of syntax that isn&#39;t found in other synopses. The question was whether the syntax was legacy. Larry Wall agreed that it was a leftover, and said he would fix it.

</p> <p>Agent Zhang sent a patch to S06 and S03 with typo corrections but had two lingering issues: S06 is overly repetitive in explaining the differences between &#39;inner&#39; and &#39;of&#39; return values, and &#39;unpacking tree node parameters&#39; needs clarification. In addition, S06 referred to both &#39;is assoc(&#39;chain&#39;)&#39; and &#39;is assoc(&#39;chaining&#39;)&#39;, which were normalized to &#39;chain&#39;.
</p> <p>Daniel Hulme had some patches to the patch; Trey Harris took responsibility for the confusion. There was a discussion on &#39;pointy subs/blocks&#39; which was resolved with a reference to Audrey Tang&#39;s commit r10478.

</p> <p>Darren Duncan wrote because he felt that the name of the Str data type is ambiguous given the traditional use of the word &#39;string&#39;.

</p> <p>Mark J. Reed wanted to know where he could find a pod2html converter that understands the Perl 6 POD.

</p> <p>Joe Gottman asked if NEXT was called before or after the update portion of a loop statement.

This led to further discussion also involving Luke Palmer and Jonathan Scott Duff.

</p> <p>Mark Reed quoted a section of S03 and asked if Order::Increase should numerify to +1 and Order::Decrease to -1. Mark A. Biggar explained that <code>$a cmp $b</code> can be seen as a sequence <code>($a, $b)</code>--if the sequence is increasing, <code>$a cmp $b</code> returns Order::Increase or -1.
</p> <p>David Green pondered the question. Larry Wall noted that <code>cmp</code> does not mean <code>eq</code>. He also expressed his feeling that &#39;but True&#39; and &#39;but False&#39; are workarounds, and not many core interfaces will use solutions involving &#39;but&#39;.

</p> <p>In response to a commit by Larry Wall, Markus Laire asked if switch <code>-abc</code> would mean <code>-a -b -c</code>. Larry discussed some of his concerns but thought it should probably be possible. Markus Laire understood Larry&#39;s point, and further elaborated on his proposal.
