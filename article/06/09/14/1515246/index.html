<p>H.Merijn Brand writes <i>"After several succesful Dutch Perl Workshops, we will organize a Dutch Perl Workshop again in February or March 2007. (most likely).
Is there anyone that would like to attend and/or give a speech there?
We have no date set yet, and if you *really* would like to come, we can still try to fit it around the dates that are possible."</i></p>
<p><i>"I would like to mention the website of the previous Dutch Perl Workshop: <a href="http://workshop.perlpromo.nl/">http://workshop.perlpromo.nl/</a>.
It is in Dutch, but before the workshop will be held, an English version will be made.<br>
<br>
At previous Dutch Workshops, people like myself, Leopold T&#246;tsch, Thomas Klausner, Johan Vromans, Mark Overmeer (MarkOv), Abigail and Juerd have given presentations and tutorials.  We aim at different levels: novice, advanced, expert.
Usage of the English language is not a problem.<br>
<br>
If you are in February or March in the vicinity (like Belgium Germany, United Kingdom, Denmark) and you don't mind a detour or a small extension of your trip, we would like to see you at the Dutch Perl Workshop.  At this point, no definitive date has been set, and we can shift the date to accomodate you.<br>
<br>
Thanks in advance, on behalve of the organizing team.<br>
<br>(Also note that the DPWS is a low-budget happening, so paying for people to come over from Australia or the VS is unlikely to happen.)"</i></p>

<h2>German Perl Workshop</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/domm/">domm</a> on 2006-09-14T17:57:53</h3>
<p>You might want to consider the German Perl Workshop which usually starts on "Aschermittwoch" ("Ash Wednesday" ?) for three days, which will be 21.02.2007 to 23.02.2007.  I'm not sure if you should put DPW right next to it, or leave some days/weeks of spacing.</p>

<p>I assume that some Austrians will come to German Perl Workshop. And as Germany is half the way from Austria to the Netherlands, maybe some people would continue to DPW (or first DPW, then GPW). Sticking them together might look nice on the Perl Workshop Tour T-Shirt (which doesn't exists, but it's a nice idea...). But it might also be a bit of overkill...</p>

<p>Oh, and YAPC::Israel (or rather <a href="http://www.osdc.org.il/" title="osdc.org.il">OSDC::Israel</a osdc.org.il>) will happen on 20-22 Feb 2007. But that's not exactly near to the Netherlands...</p>

I can't promise yet, since we, the organizers, still have to decide on dates, but we sure will try to have the DPW before or after the German Perl Workshop and the OSDC in Israel.<br>
And it would be nice to see you again...<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

As I had to miss all the conferences this summer, I'd very much enjoy coming to the Dutch perl workshop.  I'll even give a talk<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)  I have no particular date preferences.<br/><br/>Benjamin Holzman
