<h2> <a name="cpanification_of_core_modules__dual_life_modules">CPAN-ification of core modules - dual life modules</a> </h2>

<p>Gabor Szabo wanted to know if the dual-lifing of core modules on
CPAN was still on the agenda, and if so, was there a list of
suitable candidates, and/or modules that should never become
dual-lifed. Rafael Garcia-Suarez said that the process was done
on an as-needed basis.</p>
<p>Dual-lifing is when a module is bundled with the core distribution,
but also available separately on CPAN. For instance, <code>Time::HiRes</code>,
a module that for a long time was only available on CPAN, went into
core for 5.8.</p>
<p>It stood at version 1.48 when 5.8.0 was released, 1.66 when 5.8.3
was released, and the current version on CPAN is around 1.90. If
it wasn't dual-lifed, you would have to wait until a new version
of Perl came out to get the upgrade. As it is, any of those versions
of perl can be upgraded to use the current version of Time::HiRes
from CPAN, with all the attendant bug fixes and improvements that
the maintainer has made to it over the past four years.</p>
<p>Dual-lifing the core modules, then, is simply giving this same
flexibility to modules that <em>only</em> come with the perl distribution,
and do not have a distinct distribution on CPAN.</p>
<p>Michael Schwern explained a couple of the tricks needed to test
core modules, said that back-porting the module to earlier perls
would be a bonus, and suggested <code>Exporter</code> and <code>Class::Struct</code>

as two possible immediate candidates.</p>

<h2> <a name="dual_life_for_exporter">Dual life for <code>Exporter</code> </a> </h2>
<p>So Adriano Ferreira took Schwern's suggestion seriously and
set about dual-lifing the venerable <code>Exporter</code> module. Andy
Lester noticed this, and wondered what scratch it itched.</p>

<p>Michael explained that he thought cleaning up cruftiness was a good
enough reason. Giving people the chance of upgrading just <code>Exporter</code>
in order to take advantage of some new feature was a Good Thing,
especially if this would otherwise mean upgrading to the latest
version of Perl.</p>
<p>After this was explained to Andy, he wholeheartedly agreed, and
suggested that Adriano hook up with Ricardo Signes, who
apparently has a number of ideas on the subject.</p>
<p>Following that, H.Merijn Brand played devil's advocate and
explained what was bad about the idea. The porters decided
that the current method of doing things should be able to
handle the points H.Merijn raised.</p>

<h2> <a name="boolean_operator_evil">Boolean Operator Evil</a> </h2>

<p>David Wheeler was writing a mini-language in Perl, but discovered
that the lazy evaluation semantics of <code>or</code> makes life complicated
when you try and overload it. Fergal Daly mentioned Tangram's
trick of co-opting <code>&amp;</code> and <code>|</code>, which works for most people
most of the time.</p>
<p>Joshua ben Jore thought that this approach would be less pain
than grovelling around in <code>B::</code> space to deparse the op-tree
(which David had mooted as a possible approach).</p>
<p>chromatic mentioned that it is within the realms of the
feasible (and a little XS code) to override any op in the
op-tree. Mark-Jason Dominus suggested David get in touch
with Audrey Tang, who does this sort of mind-bending
syntax overloading all the time.</p>
<pre>

<p>
<h2> <a name="trimming_ops">Trimming OPs</a> </h2>
<p>Jim Cromie posted a 90KB patch to combine the <code>op_next</code> and
<code>op_sibling</code> fields into a union, which could shave up to a fifth
of the size off the the total of a full op-tree. This might provide
a benefit to <code>mod_perl</code>-like environments (and hey! it might improve
L2 cache behaviour).</p>

<p>As things stand, it nearly all works, and Jim asked for clarification
on a couple of points. After three days of deafening silence, Leon
Brocard wondered out loud whether the added complexity was worth
it.</p>

<p>
<h2> <a name="use_direct_object_constructor_calls">Use direct object constructor calls</a> </h2>
<p>chromatic landed a rather large documentation patch. The idea was
to replace all indirect constructor calls (<code>my $f = new Foo</code>) by
direct calls (<code>my $f = Foo-&gt;new</code>), the reason being that the
documentation should encourage unambiguous and reliable programming
practices.</p>

<p>Surprisingly enough, the patch elicited next to no comment (chromatic
and I discussed this at YAPC::Europe last week, imagining that it
would cause a meltdown on the list). Rafael applied it.</p>
<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/rqwf">http://xrl.us/rqwf</a> </pre>
<p>He then did the same in <em>lib/*</em>, but ran into problems with
<code>IO::Compress</code> and <code>File::Temp</code> (at least), since they are both
dual-lifed. This will require a lot more coordination with
the various distribution maintainers and thus may fall within the
realms of fiddling with the bloody grammar[tm].</p>

<h2> <a name="correction_to_pod_for_fetch___attributes">Correction to POD for <code>FETCH_*_ATTRIBUTES</code> </a> </h2>
<p>Jerry D. Hedden was astonished to find a glaring seven year old
documentation error in <em>attributes.pm</em>. Which may mean that either
no-one uses them or no-one reads documentation. Whatever the reason,
Rafael applied Jerry's correction.</p>

<h2> <a name="trie_jumping">Trie jumping</a> </h2>
<p>After a false start last month, Yves Orton managed to beat his latest
regular expression engine optimisation into submission.</p>
<p>Now, <code>/foo[xy]+|bar[tu]*|baz+/</code> goes really fast. That is, fixed-string
prefixes followed by metacharacters in alternations reap the benefit
of Yves' earlier trie work, whereas before, only <code>/foo|bar|baz/</code> would
have seen an improvement.</p>

<h2> <a name="unicode_character_database__ucd__5_0_0_released">Unicode Character Database (UCD) 5.0.0 released</a> </h2>
<p>Jarkko Hietaniemi urged all porters to fire up their clay tablets
and drag out their styluses (ahem, <em>styli</em>), because the latest
Unicode definitions now include... cuneiform.</p>
<p>Think of the possibilities! And to bring those dreams to reality,
Jarkko provided a patch to update Perl with this information.</p>
<pre>
  If it dumps core, will it shatter?
  <a href="http://xrl.us/rqwj">http://xrl.us/rqwj</a> </pre>
<p>

<h2> <a name="c___status_update">C++ status update</a> </h2>
<p>Jarkko also phoned in with the latest reports about compiling the
perl source with a C++ compiler. He had managed to get quite far
with Tru64's C++ compiler, because it is reasonably lenient about
array declarations and disambiguating <code>delete</code> as a keyword.
Other compilers are more problematic.</p>
<p>Dominic Dunlop took it for a spin on Mac OS X with g++ 4.0.1 but
ran into problems right away with <code>Configure</code> getting a bit
confused about compiler capabilities. He then delivered a patch
that cleared up many of the issues.</p>

<p>Bo Lindbergh and Nick Ing-Simmons continued to explore the issue of
what file descriptor functionality needs to be implemented to make
<code>PerlIO::Scalar</code> behave as much as possible like a file handle.
<code>-s</code> (for file size) would be useful, and last-modified-time would
probably have to be kluged in, but <code>chown</code> and <code>chmod</code> could
probably be no-ops. And so forth.</p>

<p>Tels and Andreas K&#246;nig continued to look at this problem, and
finally agreed on the right approach to take. Now all that has to
happen is for Tels to implement it.</p>

<code>kill</code> call, to determine the status of a child. David Nicol came
up with a suitable tweak to the documentation, which was applied
by Rafael.</p>

<p>Leif Pedersen encountered a strange problem with <code>bignum</code>, whereby
<code>$char = ord($char) - ord('A') + 10</code> appeared to have no effect.
Tels twisted the example slightly, and got it to produce a
<code>Modification of a read-only value</code> error, which led him to conclude
that it was an aliasing error.</p>

<h2> <a name="xsubpp_ignores_prefix_when_wrapping_function_declared_with_interface___40264_"> <code>xsubpp</code> ignores <code>PREFIX</code> when wrapping function declared with INTERFACE (#40264)</a> </h2>
<p>Salvador Fandi&#241;o uncovered a nasty interaction in <code>xsubpp</code> between
<code>PREFIX</code> and <code>INTERFACE</code>, and proposed a fix. Rafael agreed that
the change was necessary, even if it was not backwards compatible.
He suggested that the issue be raised with Ken Williams, who
maintains <code>ExtUtils::ParseXS</code> (since <code>xsubpp</code> is merely a wrapper
around that).</p>

<p>Bo Lindbergh uncovered another beauty in <code>PerlIO::scalar</code>. Mike
Guy hoped that a couple of variations on the theme would be also
be fixed by whoever fixed it. Rafael fixed it with change #28798,
so let's hope it all gets bedded down in the test suite.</p>

Andy Dougherty came up with a crude patch to backslash-escape spaces in
paths, but suspected that a number of other places may need similar
treatment. Kids, this is definitely something you can try at home.</p>

<p>One of the reasons <strong>it is worth pushing for C++-compilable sources</strong>,
