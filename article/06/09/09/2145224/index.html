<p>Alex Davies noticed that <code>perl</code> attempts to look for <em>/dev/urandom</em>

on Win32 platforms, even though that file does not exist. And worse,
you can create it, thereby subverting Perl's randomness. Steve Peters
fixed that up.</p>

<p>Jarkko Hietaniemi wrapped up his heroic endeavour to merge the code
changes that IBM programmers made to a copy of Perl, <em>circa</em> 5.8.7,
to <code>blead</code>. He announced he was stepping down, having left a couple
of parts of the patch unapplied, and explained why. He invited the
IBM programmers to continue the good work, to have Perl running on
z/OS.</p>

<h2> <a name="ops_needed_for____and___">ops needed for <code>[]</code> and <code>{}</code> </a> </h2>
<p>Nicholas Clark discovered that a lot of work (lots of ops) are
needed to build a single lousy anonymous hash or array, and wondered
if there wasn't a more efficient way of of making one. He came up
with a patch to change the behaviour (bonus JFDI points to Nicholas)
that simultaneously slimmed down the op-tree, and doesn't break the
test suite. And naturally enough, he wanted to know whether people
thought this was a good idea.</p>
<p>Jim Cromie ran a few benchmarks and found some measurable
improvements.</p>

<p>Dropping in from Parrot, Chip Salzenberg wanted to know if any
porters knew of a platform far, far away that did not have a
C99-capable compiler.</p>
<p>Nicholas Clark mentioned <code>gcc</code>, for starters. Andy Dougherty had
some good advice. Tony Cook pointed out that Microsoft don't seem
very interested in providing support for C99 features, unless they
happen to also be C++-compatible. Chip said some naughty words.</p>

<p>Jesse Vincent announced the end of the Ponie project, the migration
of the Perl 5 core to use the Parrot VM. A number of other techniques
are currently under development to have Perl 5 code running inside
Perl 6, and much good came out of the project in terms of clean-ups
to the code base.</p>

<h1> <a name="patches_of_interest">Patches of Interest</a> </h1>
<p>Numerous small patches that were applied quietly without fuss, or
withdrawn by the author are not included in this section (it's big
enough as it is).</p>

<p>
<h2> <a name="patching_for_g__">Patching for g++</a> </h2>
<p>Jarkko Hietaniemi checked in a large body of work to make the
code base compile with g++, the GNU C++ compiler.</p>
<p>First some g++ goodness for Tru64</p>
<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/rnza">http://xrl.us/rnza</a> </pre>
<p>And then a large patch for everyone, which nearly almost works,
but significant smoking will be required, if only to get the
kinks ironed out on some of the more common platforms.</p>
<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/rnzb">http://xrl.us/rnzb</a> </pre>

<p>At this point, Jarkko rolled up a patch that succeeded as getting as
far as completing <code>make perl</code>, although <code>x2p</code> and a few extensions
don't build. Steve Peters carried the baton and tidied up a few of
the easier modules, although a couple needed more thought.</p>
<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/rnzc">http://xrl.us/rnzc</a> </pre>
<p>Jarkko then puzzled for a bit over how to get C linkage back out
again at the end of it, so that things would work as before. All
this fuss made him suspect that the source probably never was
compilable with a C++ compiler. Still, it might in the near future.</p>
<pre>

<p>Gabor Szabo delivered some patches to add X&lt;&gt; tags (for indexing)
to the core documentation and also snuck in a few stylistic changes while
no-one was looking (although it warranted a comment from Rafael).</p>

mismatches. Hooray! Applied.</p>

<h2> <a name="detecting_bad__dev_nulls_in_configure">Detecting bad <em>/dev/null</em>s in <code>Configure</code> </a> </h2>
<p>Michael Cummings, from Gentoo, proposed a patch to make <code>Configure</code>

smarter about <em>/dev/null</em>, which may not always be configured
correctly, especially in chrooted environments, and by the time
this causes a problem, the build may already be quite some way down
the track (and thus the original cause of the error may be hard to
diagnose. &quot;Missing Separator&quot; errors may not seem crystal clear.
Alexey Toptygin proposed a tweak. A new patch was proposed.
Unapplied.</p>

<p>Things in <em>lib/strict.t</em>, <em>lib/subs.t</em> and <em>t/run/fresh_perl.t</em> seemed
to be going pear-shaped, but appeared to be a Heisenbug, since Jarkko
wasn't able to reproduce the errors manually.</p>

<p>The pain persisted, so in the morning, Jarkko went to the ice-rink to
see if Dave Mitchell was around. Nicholas Clark made the connection to
the work on plugging leaks on unevaluable code, realising that that
may be causing problems here. Dave professed to not having many tuits

pair of snippets to show what Marc was trying to get at. And yes, it's
quite counter-intuitive, broken, and nearly impossible to fix. David
still had trouble understanding, and Benjamin Carter (who writes from

<h2> <a name="math__bigint_silently_drops_lib_argument_if_not_available___40242_"> <code>Math::BigInt</code> silently drops lib argument if not available (#40242)</a> </h2>
<p>You can import <code>Math::Bigint</code>
and tell it to use an underlying library to do the biginty calculations.
But if you type the name incorrectly, it silently loads a couple
of default libraries and never complains that anything is wrong.
Andreas K&#246;nig thought this behaviour less than desirable. He felt
that the script should die, so that the programmer could fix the
error.</p>
<p>The problem is that if this was changed now, it might break programs
of people who were living happily in ignorance that their BigInt
calculations were not in fact using GMP or Pari as they had thought,
but rather the default Calc and Fastcalc libraries, simply because
they had accidently typed &quot;Gimp&quot; or &quot;Paris&quot;.</p>

<p>Allen Smith felt that since this was the first time in four years
that someone had questioned the existing behaviour, it maybe wasn't
so bad after all. Tels offered a snippet of sanity checking boilerplate
to do what Andreas wanted.</p>

<p>Andreas also posted a bug on rampant memory usage, that can be slimmed
down by using temporaries, which in turn allows the garbage collector
to fire off more readily, keeping consumption to a minimum.</p>

<h2> <a name="perl5_bug_summary">Perl5 Bug Summary</a> </h2>
<p>Around 21 new tickets were created this month, and alas, only 8
were closed, bringing the current total to 1519. Hopefully after
the summer lull Steve will be able to get that figure down under
1500 again. And if a couple of people pitched in to help, we could
bring it down lower, and faster.</p>

<p>John Peacock uploaded version 0.67 of <code>version</code> to correct the problem
that Ovid spotted of version 0.000001 not being understood.</p>

<p>Dave Rolsky synced <code>blead</code> with <code>Time::Local</code> version 1.13 from CPAN.</p>

<p> <code>Module::Load</code> became part of the core distribution.</p>

<li>
<p>A proposal was made to add <code>Locale::Maketext::Simple</code> to the core,
however, as far as I can see, it was not added. The fact that the
module is not licensed under the Artistic or GPL licenses (rather,
the MIT license), may have something to do with it.</p>

<p> <code>Module::Loaded</code> also made it into the core, but sparked off a certain
amount of debate as to whether it offered <em>enough</em> functionality.</p>

<p>After having too much fun compiling perl with g++, Jarkko still found time
to get release <code>Time::HiRes</code> version 1.88 to CPAN.</p>

<p>Nicholas Clark posted a long reply about <strong>the difference between
Python's and Perl's threads</strong>, and why Perl's threads are unlikely
to mesh nicely with a CORBA implementation.</p>

<p>Brendan O'Dea, from the world of debian, wondered whether <strong>what was
wrong with <code>setlocale()</code> </strong> was an implementation or a documentation
problem.</p>

<p>Ben Morrow suggested <strong>adding all keywords to <code>perlfunc</code> </strong>. And rather
just moaning about how nice it would be, actually sent in the patch
that documented a slew of things, like <code>can</code>, <code>DESTROY</code> and so forth.
Unapplied, but it has certain merits.</p>

<p>Marc Lehmann uncovered a way to make <strong>perl with <code>-DPERL_DONT_CREATE_GVSV</code> </strong>
dump core. Nicholas wasn't sure of the reason.</p>

<p>Gerard Goossen came up with a test case for a <strong> <code>substr</code> with
lvalue refcount increment bug</strong>, but no-one was sure what to do about
it. At least, Dave Mitchell didn't know.</p>
