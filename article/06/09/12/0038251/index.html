<p>No, this isn't a plug for my new song, <a href="http://pudge.net/tunes/tracks/Birthday.mp3">Osama Bin Laden, You Ruined My Birthday</a>.  Rather, this is from <a href="http://www.google-analytics-book.com/">dejah</a>, who sends in a bit of Perl Poetry about the anniversary.  Read on for the poem and its reading.</p>
<p><blockquote> <div> <pre>warn ("Al Queda Determined to Strike US");
exec(0);
open(MYPETGOAT, "Story-Book") or die "11, 175, 93, 77";
while (&lt;MYPETGOAT&gt;){ exec(0) }
for ($i=1; $i&lt;=2752; $i++) { if (!!$ur==0) { kill; kill; kill; }}
$red = $white = $blue = "gray";
$together = $black + $white + $republican + $democrat + $young + $old;
goto (Afganistan);
if (!m/Osama Bin Laden/) { delete("Iraq") }
split (/sectarian lines/, $Iraq . $US);
if (!m/insurgency/) { our($soldiers) = $iraqicivilians = $civilliberties = 0 }
exec(0);
exit("fail");
</pre> </div> </blockquote>

<p>It reads as:</p>

<blockquote>
<div> <p>Warning: Al Queda Determined to Strike US
<br>The President does nothing.
<br>Open My Pet Goat while death approaches for flights 11, 175, 93, and 77.
<br>While reading My Pet Goat, the President does nothing.
<br>And 2752 people die.
<br>And the red, white and blue turns gray.
<br>But all of us become one.
<br>
<br>We go to Afganistan,
<br>but when we cant find Osama Bin Laden
<br>we attack Iraq.
<br>And we fall apart--the US and Iraq--splitting along sectarian lines
<br>while the insurgency rages,
<br>our soldiers die
<br>iraqi civilians die
<br>we give up our civil liberties
<br>The President does nothing.
<br>To exit is to fail
</p> </div> </blockquote>

<p>(Please, don't be lame and get into political flamewars here.  I don't agree with the poem, I just think it's good.  If you want to argue about politics, post an entry about it on your journal or something.)</p></p>

<p>If this were just a journal post, I wouldn't mind it.  But I think it's inappropriate to be posted to the front page and the title is in poor taste given the subject matter.</p>

IMO, the title is in poor taste, but it is entirely appropriate for the front page.

September 11 has become a holiday.  I say Happy Memorial Day, and Happy September 11.  Maybe I am just weird.  (q thinks: "maybe??!?!")<br>

It's not really my birthday.  The song is not autobigographical.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

Thanks for the clarification.  Anyway, there are people's whose birthdays, whose children's births, etc. now coincide with a day that has been emotionally tainted.  Bah.<br/><br/>I hope that you had a happy birthday, anyway.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:^)

Yeah, I wrote the song primarily for those people.  I hope it brings some joy to them.<br>

<p>I think I actually said or thought this yesterday at some point, and then immediately thought, "No, that's not the way to express it."  But I wouldn't fault anyone for expressing it that way.</p>

<p>Kinda like Tisha b'Av: a day of mourning a cataclysm that will hopefully be transformed into joy as we all recover.</p>

<h2>Lame political flame war</h2>

<p>I want so badly to respond, but I'm holding off.  So I put it in my journal.</p>



<h2>Not a plug?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/DAxelrod/">DAxelrod</a> on 2006-09-12T21:55:07</h3>
<p>So if it's not a plug for your song, why does the link to your song take up so much of this post's space on the front page?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)</p>

<p><small>In all seriousness, I am greatful for the generosity of Pudge and <a href="http://use.perl.org/faq.shtml#TheSite1" title="perl.org">everyone else</a perl.org> who runs and supports this site. I wouldn't feel justified in complaining about which content goes on the front page, even if I had a complaint, which I don't.</small></p>

<p>Yeah, I know, I just wasn't sure how well my own humor would come through, so I padded it in a bunch of statements appologizing for it.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>
<p>If number of comments to an article is an indication of success, you probably should make it a regular feautre. Then again, Perlmonks <a href="http://perlmonks.org/?node_id=1590" title="perlmonks.org">does already have a poetry section</a perlmonks.org>...</p>

<p>What makes it good? Its iambic pentameter or the totally bogus facts put to lyrics created from Perl code?</p>

I like some of its features, like <tt>exec(0)</tt> and <tt>goto (Afghanistan)</tt>.<br>



<blockquote>

<h2>Re:Mmmm</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jdavidb/">jdavidb</a> on 2006-09-14T18:11:30</h3>
<p>exec(0) was pretty cool, but goto(Afghanistan) didn't seem like a very original form.</p>

Which of those facts are you calling bogus?

Not to argue...but the way "I" read it, pretty much that whole first paragraph.
