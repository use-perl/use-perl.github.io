better assertion support in perl. He went through the repository and
dug out all the patches, but when he applied them to blead it
wouldn't compile.</p>

<p>Steve Hay reported intermittent hangs when smoking threads on Win32.
He gathered a bit more information by running the tests manually,
but wasn't able to get things to fail reliably. Dave Mitchell
muttered something about race conditions in thread finishing, but
wasn't able to recall precisely what it was that he had noticed.</p>
<p>Jerry D. Hedden checked in a patch elsewhere to clear this up

<h2> <a name="safe_signals_and_sigsegv">Safe signals and <code>SIGSEGV</code> </a> </h2>

<p>Rafael Garcia-Suarez wondered whether <code>SIGSEGV</code> should be delivered
by default in unsafe mode, and pointed to a bug report in Mandriva
Linux that exposed the problem. Dave Mitchell tended to agree, and
suggested that <code>SIGBUS</code> and <code>SIGILL</code> be thrown in as well.</p>
<p>Mike Guy was in full agreement, and made a list of six points that
needed to be taken into consideration.</p>

<h2> <a name="problems_with_________in_blead">Problems with <code>(??{...})</code> in blead</a> </h2>
<p>Yves Orton was taking the latest engine for a spin and noticed
that <code>Regexp::Common</code> revealed a problem with how <code>(??{...})</code>
and backtracking no longer play nicely together.</p>

<p>Dave Mitchell admitted that he must have backed over something in
<code>re_eval</code> and promised to straighten it out when he had a few
moments. Yves proposed one way of fixing it, after having taken a
look at (and understood) how it currently works. Dave begged Yves
not to go down that road, since it would rely on infrastructure
that Dave is currently in the process of ripping out and replacing.</p>

<h2> <a name="acme__meta_is_broken_again"> <code>Acme::Meta</code> is broken again</a> </h2>
<p>Andreas K&#246;nig noticed that change #26867 in blead resulted in

<code>Acme::Meta</code> becoming unbuildable. Nicholas Clark noted that this
was the second time that it had been broken, and wondered if the
most expedient solution was simply to add <code>Acme::Meta</code> to the core.</p>
<p>Seriously though, the question to be asked was is what it does
considered appropriate behaviour, and thus deserving of proper
support? In which case regression tests need to be added to the
test suite (<code>Acme::Meta</code> plays fast and loose with stashes --
symbol table hashes). Rafael proposed a patch to <code>Acme::Meta</code> which
restores full functionality (?) whilst keeping the the recent
speed optimisations that have been made in the neighbourhood.</p>

<h2> <a name="help_meeeee">Help me-e-e-e-e</a> </h2>
<p>After a certain Chandra Sekaran posted a vague bug report that
mentioned PERL, LDAP and the MS Event Viewer, Dominic Dunlop provided
a detailed response on what steps Chandra should take to get the
problem fixed, which prompted Andy Dougherty to thank Dominic for
his kindness and patience over the years when dealing with such
reports.</p>
<pre>
  And he didn't even mention uppercase

<h2> <a name="more_on_trimming_ops">More on trimming OPs</a> </h2>
<p>Dave Mitchell took a look at Jim Cromie's work on combining <code>op_next</code>
and <code>op_sibling</code> in the opcode structure, and wanted to obtain
better figures on what the memory difference would be. Dave thought
that the massive creation of SVs that come about when one does any
sort of work would drown out the savings made in shrinking the
opcodes.</p>
<p>As Jim had been encountering difficulties in getting the patch to
work correctly, he had been asking for help (which then in turn
would allow such benchmarks to be obtained). Dave Mitchell suggested
an elegant trick that at least defers having to get it to work.</p>
<p>Just add an extra dummy field to the structure and see how much the
overall programs grows. One could then conclude that if Jim were
to succeed in his efforts, the program would shrink by an equivalent
amount in the other direction.</p>
<p>Depending on the code, the change is negligible or significant.
More real-world code samples will be needed to see whether it is
worth pursuing. Joshua ben Jore reminded him that <code>B::Deparse</code>,

<code>Data::Dumper</code> must not be broken because of such changes.</p>
<pre>

<h2> <a name="core_support_for_data__bind">Core support for <code>Data::Bind</code> </a> </h2>
<p>Chia-liang Kao explained what new core support would be required
to make <code>Data::Bind</code> (which provides Perl6-style semantics for
subroutine arguments) a little less of a kluge. The main problem
is to have a read-only lexical alias that points to a regular
read-write lexical.</p>
<p>The easy way out would be to hang the information off the target
SV, but then the original SV naturally becomes read-only as well,
which is exactly what we're trying to avoid. Thus some sort of shim
layer is needed between the alias and the original to get a chance
to to the deed, which caused chromatic to mutter something out
bestowing a new vtable upon an SV.</p>
<p>Rick Delaney and Rafael Garcia-Suarez debated syntax. Nicholas Clark
and Larry Wall debated implementation issues (with an eye to backwards
compatibility: any number of suitable solutions exists, but they
would break existing XS code. Not good).</p>
<pre>
  ... and in the data bind them

<h2> <a name="taint_and_memory_usage">Taint and memory usage</a> </h2>
<p>Xho Jingleheimerschmidt wondered why running a program with taint
checks appears to double the amount of memory required. This can
be a problem on lean machines. Xho wanted to know if there is a
work-around for it, or failing that, an explanation of why it occurs.</p>
<p>I figured out one part of the problem and will have posted a partial
reply next week, but you'll have to wait until then and see whether
an internals guru picks up the ball and runs with it.</p>

<h2> <a name="duallifing_devel__dprof">Dual-lifing <code>Devel::DProf</code> </a> </h2>

<p>Andy Lester, evidently having too much spare time on his hands,
thought it would be a good idea if he were to take care of
<code>Devel::DProf</code>. Except that it's noted on CPAN that Ilya Zakharevich
is already the author. Then again, the version bundled with <code>blead</code>
is different, anyway.</p>
<p>Ilya was rather non-committal on the idea, citing that while a more
portable codebase is desirable, the module is too intimately tied
to perl's internals for it to be easy to make a one-size-fits-all
distribution. Rafael thought that it might lead to a twisty maze
of <code>#ifdef</code>s.</p>
<p>Be that as it may, Andy was most interested in making improvements
to the <code>dprofpp</code> end of things. (Which makes me wonder whether the
distribution needs to be some dimorphic beast: one side that gathers
profiling information, and the other side that does the reporting).</p>
<pre>

<h1> <a name="patches_of_interest">Patches of Interest</a> </h1>
<p>
<h2> <a name="race_condition_fixes_for_threads">Race condition fixes for threads</a> </h2>
<p>Jerry D. Hedden posted a patch to fix what he thought was the cause
of the race conditions that have been seen (above) with threads.
Dave Mitchell appreciated the effort, but rebuked Jerry for mixing
in trivial stylistic changes with serious open-heart surgery on
mutexes.</p>
<p>It becomes difficult to see what is important, makes it harder to
track changes, and increases the workload of the <code>maint</code> pumpking
who has to try and merge this stuff.</p>

<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/ru3z">http://xrl.us/ru3z</a> </pre>
<p>So Jerry redid the patch to make it easier for people to follow
along at home. Rafael smoked the patches on a hexaprocessor box,
gave them a clean bill of health, and so they were applied.</p>

<p>Jarkko Hietaniemi sent in an update concerning his work to get

to bomb, so Yves Orton rewrote the nasty bits and got it to
work.</p>

<p>Yves Orton added more shiny goodness to the regular expression
engine, this time boosting the performance of zero-width
lookahead assertions. In the benchmarks that Yves had available,
this was the last area where Python was previously outperforming
Perl.</p>
<pre>
  Getting your bearings
  <a href="http://xrl.us/ru36">http://xrl.us/ru36</a> </pre>

<p>Elsewhere around the engine, Yves started to add hooks into it to pave the
way for making a pluggable regular expression engine. (Which may lead, for
instance, to Yves and Dave Mitchell's  work in blead one day making it back to
maint. Or running the PCRE engine inside Perl).</p>

is still not perfect, but Craig felt certain that this batch
of changes would not create problems on other platforms.</p>

<p>A couple of months back, Sadahiro Tomoyuki showed that <code>/a\N{PLUS
SIGN}b/</code> is parsed as <code>/a+b/</code> instead of the more Do-What-I-Meanish

<code>/a\+b/</code>. Yves Orton delivered an impressive patch to correct that
behaviour. Tomoyuki went through the patch with a fine-toothed comb
and made many suggestions. H.Merijn Brand applied it.</p>

<p>Andrew Savige mailed in a patch to correct a couple of Windows bugs
dealing with backticks. In fact, there were two patches, one for maint
and one for blead. How thoughtful.</p>

<p>Yves went over it and gave it the thumbs up. Rafael took it for a spin
on an SMP box but the tests would hang from time to time. But since
there is a net improvement, it's all gone in, and the test has been
marked TODO until such time as Yves or someone else can take a closer
look.</p>

<h2> <a name="smoke__5_9_4__28821_fail_xf__osf1_v5_1__ev6_4_cpu_">Smoke [5.9.4] 28821 <code>FAIL(XF)</code> OSF1 V5.1 (EV6/4 cpu)</a> </h2>

<p>Jarkko discovered that Finnish locales, threads and regexps was a
potent brew that caused all sorts of smoke to come flying out of
his machine. Yves started to sift through the evidence to look for
what was going wrong.</p>
<p>After a short while, he hacked up a quick and dirty fix that consisted
of disabling <code>study</code> for UTF-8 strings. And after another look he
didn't feel so bad about the idea, since the code seemed to indicate
that it couldn't work anyway.</p>
<p>Rafael had another look at the patch that had given rise to the
problems, and noted that it was only the test part of the patch
that appeared to be in error.</p>
<p>Yves finally hit paydirt. The test was actually correct. The code
was wrong. Looking at old patch from Ilya Zakharevich some time
last century, where a change from double- to single-quoting of some
embedded Perl code meant that from that time on, the test has been
patiently studying a stringified reference instead of a reference
to a string, and that UTF-8 and <code>study</code> has been broken forever.
Jarkko was lost for words. But then quickly recovered and gave Yves
his next challenge.</p>
<p>Jarkko and Yves then discussed how Perl should have really implemented
UTF, properly. Yves hoped that the Perl 6 crowd have learnt their
lessons well.</p>
<pre>

  I never liked studying, anyway

<p>Sadahiro noticed a that a declaration list contained a statement,

<p>Jarkko noted another failure, that occur when the locale in use uses
a comma as a decimal point. This reminded H.Merijn Brand of Stupid
Locale Tricks to try with Windows, and John Peacock wondered how he
could better test <code>version.pm</code> to deal with this stuff.</p>

<p>Jerry D. Hedden was looking at <strong> <em>threads/shared/typemap</em> </strong>. It
<strong>was removed in a patch</strong> by accident, and then subsequently
reinstated. Jerry wondered why, since it is a zero-length file
that apparently serves no purpose.</p>
<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/ru4x">http://xrl.us/ru4x</a> </pre>
<p>And the patch to reinstate it didn't square with <strong>the APC (&quot;Archive
of Perl Changes&quot;) repository</strong>, and left the latter in an uncertain state.</p>

<p>Jonathan Rockway wanted to know whether one could <strong>compile Perl 5
for Qtopia devices</strong>. Paul Johnson provided a couple of tips.</p>

<p>Gabor Szabo wondered whether errors about the <strong>signedness of pointer
targets in <em>Normalize.xs</em> </strong> in 5.9.4 were the same as those in

<code>Net::RawIP</code>. Whatever the case, Gabor fixed the problem with a
couple of casts.</p>

<p>Yves Orton finally became sufficiently annoyed by the <strong> <code>mktables</code>
executes seven time per build</strong> mazurka and decided to do something about
it. So he did. Yay! Rafael applied it. Yay!</p>

<p>Yitzchak Scott-Thoennes was looking at the <strong>ongoing coredumps in
Cygwin</strong> and finally suggested a one-liner involving <code>sv_setpvn</code>
and <code>NULL</code>. Applied by Rafael.</p>

<p>We are still looking for a volunteer to work with Klocwork in order
to <strong>perform an analysis of perl code</strong>. (At the C side, that is).</p>

<p>Jarkko removed the <strong>probe for <code>-Wdeclaration-after-statement</code> </strong>
from <code>Configure</code>.</p>
<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/ru46">http://xrl.us/ru46</a> </pre>
<p>Also, if your exotic platform has been having an environmental
crisis with blead, it may be due to Jarkko's <strong>diddling of

<code>Perl_my_setenv()</code> </strong>. So the diddling was undiddled.</p>

<p>Premchai noted that <strong> <code>perlsec</code> talks erroneously about a &quot;Non-Finite Automaton&quot;</strong>
when in fact it should be talking about a Nondeterministic Finite Automaton.</p>

<p>In case you hadn't noticed, <strong>JPL (the Java/Perl thing) has been removed
from <code>blead</code> </strong> and will not be present in 5.10.</p>

<p>Ben Morrow showed me a simple of trick to cope with what happens
<strong>when perl headers conflict with systems headers</strong>.</p>

outer lexical scopes</strong> in its BUGS section.</p>
