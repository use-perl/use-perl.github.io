<p>Ask Bj&oslash;rn Hansen announced the creation of the perl6-users mailing
list on May 17th, 2006.</p>


<p> <i> <a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/perl6-users@perl.org/msg00005.html">Perl 6 Users FAQ (perl.perl6.users) --  Version: 2006-05-18 (s/newsgroup/mailing list/)</a> </i> </p>

<p>Conrad Schneiker posted the Perl 6 User FAQ.</p>


<p> <i> <a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/perl6-users@perl.org/msg00006.html">perl6-users or perl6-meta?</a> </i> </p>

<p>Markus Laire asked about the state of perl6-meta, now that perl6-users
has been created.  Conrad Schneiker replied that perl6-users would be
used.</p>


<p> <i> <a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/perl6-users@perl.org/msg00007.html">Where can I find a Perl 6 language reference?</a> </i> </p>

<p>Thomas Wittek wondered if the best language reference for Perl 6
was the synopses, pugs-doc, or another resource.
A. Pagaltzis recommended pugs-doc, and gave the URL to a getting
started document.  Michael Mathews added that he was looking for
a step-by-step guide to installing Perl 6.  David Romano described
his own build process, and noted that the INSTALL file explains the
process in greater detail.  A couple of other people offered suggestions
or mentioned their own documentation questions.</p>


<p> <i> <a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/perl6-users@perl.org/msg00017.html">Windows Binaries for Pugs</a> </i> </p>

<p>Chris Yocum noted that there were some slightly out-of-date Windows binaries
of Pugs available.  James Peregrino wondered if binaries were worthwhile,
given the speed of development.  Jonathan Scott Duff felt that they
were appropriate for people looking to dabble.  Rutger Vos was in favor
of nightly builds.</p>

<p>Conrad Schneiker reported that the user FAQ had been updated and
offered a link.</p>


<p> <i> <a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/perl6-users@perl.org/msg00032.html">Latest additions (links, release highlights to Perl 6 Users FAQ</a> </i> </p>

<p>Conrad Schneiker listed the latest additions to the Perl 6 Users FAQ
and noted that it can be found at
<a href="http://www.athenalab.com/Perl_6_Users_FAQ.htm">www.athenalab.com</a>.</p>


<p> <i> <a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/perl6-users@perl.org/msg00036.html">parrot and pugs builds for os x</a> </i> </p>

<p>David Romano created packages of Pugs and Parrot for OS X and asked people
to try them.  Michael Mathews reported success.  The download location
for the packages was discussed.</p>


<p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/0c28646b2857b06f/aa7e16ac4ced5163?#aa7e16ac4ced5163">(Existing) Perl 6 Wiki: (http://perl.net.au/wiki/Perl_6).</a> </i> </p>

<p> <a href="%23DBABF01F-0F09-466F-A48E-4C96118D80BD@dstorrs.com">In an earlier thread</a>,
it was suggested that perhaps a Perl 6 wiki to keep information on Pugs
progress up-to-date would be useful.  </p>

<p>Conrad Schneiker posted about a wiki site with good policies that might
be suitable, and Paul Fenwick, an admin from the site, expressed his
willingness to help out.  Juerd, however, thought it would be nice to
not just write about Perl 6 in the wiki, but to create the wiki software
in Perl 6.</p>

<p>Conrad posted addition details in
<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/d6e65c2f914898dc/24a234fed0d93656?#24a234fed0d93656">another thread</a>.</p>

with Conrad and Juerd posting on the merits of various options.  JMD added
a comment as well.</p>


<p> <i> <a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/perl6-users@perl.org/msg00060.html">Perl 6 and Parrot links</a> </i> </p>

<p>Jurosz Michal referenced
<a href="http://wiki.kn.vutbr.cz/mj/index.cgi?Perl%206%20and%20Parrot%20links">a wiki page containing Perl 6 and Parrot links</a>.</p>


<p> <i> <a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/perl6-users@perl.org/msg00045.html">perl 6 hosting?</a> </i> </p>

<p>Michael Mathews wondered if there was any possibility of finding an
environment with Perl 6 installed so that people could dabble in it
without having to install all the required software and keep it updated.
Security concerns were pointed out.  Chris Yocum proposed regular
binary distributions to make installation easier.  There was continued
discussion on how to address the security issues.</p>


<p> <i> <a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/perl6-users@perl.org/msg00052.html">Simple Print/Say Question</a> </i> </p>

<p>Chris Yocum got stuck converting a program from Perl 5 to Perl 6.
The difficulty involved joining elements of an array in to a string.
Gabor Szabo offered alternate syntax, and several people reported that
both the original and Gabor&#39;s version worked for them.  The problem
was identified in another portion of Chris&#39;s code.</p>


<p> <i> <a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/perl6-users@perl.org/msg00084.html">eval</a> </i> </p>

<p>Gabor Szabo asked what <code>$@</code> is in Pugs.
Yuval Kogman replied that it is <code>$!</code> and linked to the exception handlers
documentation.  He also mentioned <code>try</code>.  Michael Mathews asked for
a working example of try and CATCH.  David Romano thought CATCH
hadn&#39;t been implemented yet.</p>


<p> <i> <a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/perl6-users@perl.org/msg00090.html">3 Good Reasons...</a> </i> </p>

<p>Michael Mathews asked if people could contribute compelling reasons
for managers to switch from Perl 5 to Perl 6, because the syntax is
so different that it is in essence a new language.  Daniel Hulme
shared his love of the type system.  Ovid felt the strength of Perl
6 is in the object system, and the fact that it interacts well with
other languages.  Several other people responded with their thoughts.</p>


<p> <i> <a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/perl6-users@perl.org/msg00098.html">Logic Programming for Perl6 (Was Re: 3 Good Reasons... (typo alert!))</a> </i> </p>

<p>The earlier thread
<a href="%23dab429000605241354w22d0c20p9579bedcae0b2244@mail.gmail.com">3 Good Reasons...</a> spawned
a discussion of logic programming.  Previously, Ovid had expressed his
concern about Perl 6 not including support for logic programming, but
noted that this was a mixed blessing since it is usually implemented
incorrectly.  David Romano was curious about what problems Ovid saw
with adding support for logic programming in Perl 6.  Ovid elaborated.  </p>

<p>Larry Wall added that perhaps perl6-language was a better location for the
discussion.  Ovid started a new thread in that group:
<a href="%2320060525184519.12266.qmail@web60821.mail.yahoo.com">Fw: Logic Programming for Perl6 (Was Re: 3 Good Reasons... (typo alert!))</a>.</p>


<p> <i> <a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/perl6-users@perl.org/msg00106.html">perldoc or pod parser in Perl6</a> </i> </p>

<p>Gabor Szabo asked if there was a perldoc command or pod parser implemented
in Perl 6.</p>


<p> <i> <a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/perl6-users@perl.org/msg00124.html">Introductions; P6 wiki</a> </i> </p>

<p>Paul Fenwick brought up the idea of a wiki for Perl 6, which was also
mentioned in thread <a href="%23003401c67e3c$65aaaea0$e8836944@athenalab2">(Existing) Perl 6 Wiki: (http://perl.net.au/wiki/Perl_6).</a>.
He made a reference to implementing the wiki in Perl 6; Ovid responded
with a proposal on how someone might accomplish that.</p>


<p> <i> <a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/perl6-users@perl.org/msg00126.html">$1,000 prize for Perl 6 Wiki written in Perl 6</a> </i> </p>

<p>Continuing with the discussion of a wiki in Perl 6, previously mentioned
in <a href="%2344783C0F.6090806@perltraining.com.au">Introductions; P6 wiki</a>, Conrad Schneiker
announced a reward for the person who delivers the first Perl 6 wiki.
He defined how the winner would be determined and the money distributed.
There were discussions on the specifications for the project.  There was
also a call for a wiki on Perl 6 to be created immediately, without adding
the delay of rewriting wiki software in Perl 6.  People were also interested
in comparing markdown with mediawiki syntax.</p>


<p> <i> <a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/perl6-users@perl.org/msg00129.html">CGI on 6</a> </i> </p>

<p>In reference to the wiki challenge
(<a href="%23002301c681d5$61b99fd0$e8836944@athenalab2">$1,000 prize for Perl 6 Wiki written in Perl 6</a>),
Michael Mathews asked about CGI on Perl 6.  Conrad Schneiker
offered some links with example code.  Ovid thought the interface
would be taken from Perl 5 and noted that now was a good time to note
any complaints with Perl 5 modules.  He also pointed out that the
cookbook Conrad referenced was missing a lot of detail, and thought
Audrey Tang would welcome any material.  Several other people also
volunteered information.</p>


<p> <i> <a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/perl6-users@perl.org/msg00160.html">Relationship between pugs and parrot/language/perl6</a> </i> </p>

<p>Rob asked about the relationship between Pugs and the Perl 6 implementation
found under languages in Parrot.  Audrey Tang replied that Parrot/Perl 6
project is one of three independent implementations of Perl 6, with
the other two being &#39;lrep&#39;, and, naturally, Pugs.  She explained the
reasons behind the different projects.</p>


<p> <i> <a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/perl6-users@perl.org/msg00168.html">Minimum modules for Production?</a> </i> </p>

<p>Ovid tried to compile a list of &#39;must have&#39; modules that will be needed
in Perl 6 for it to be used in production.  Other people added their
suggestions.  The following modules were mentioned:
DBI, Template toolkit, DateTime, CGI, an object-relational mapper,
mod_perl6, an HTML parser, LWP, Test::More, and XML::Parser.</p>

<p>Amir E. Aharoni said that he&#39;d like to see modules in the core if they
were worth mentioning in books like &#39;The Perl Cookbook&#39; and &#39;Perl Best
Practices&#39;.  Darren Duncan said that the Perl 6 distribution would be
small, with other modules available on CPAN.  Larry Wall replied that
people would be encouraged to form standard distributions.  Some other
people joined the discussion.</p>


<p> <i> <a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/perl6-users@perl.org/msg00198.html">RE: [#59132406] perl.perl6.users MIA</a> </i> </p>

<p>Conrad Schneiker reported the absence of perl6-users to Google groups.
There was some discussion of Google&#39;s group-adding policy, and a request
to have it added to Gmane as well. </p>

<p>This group was eventually added to both Google and Gmane, but archives
were not included, as anyone clicking on the perl6-users
links in this summary probably noticed.</p>



<p> <b>Language</b> </p>

<p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/3721a9d21aa77dab/ad96bf632f64ecc8?#ad96bf632f64ecc8">A shorter long dot</a> </i> </p>

<p>In the previous month, there was a fair amount of discussion on the
long dot.  May saw more of the topic, which was kicked off by Juerd. <br>
Several people dislike <code>. .</code> and alternatives were proposed.  The
alternatives did not enjoy universal support either.</p>


<p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/ea1b231f43442708/772b7a98896e3efb?#772b7a98896e3efb">[svn:perl6-synopsis] r9076 / my ($foo, *, $bar) = 1..3</a> </i> </p>

<p>In reply to a commit by Audrey Tang, James Mastros asked if
<code>my ($foo, *, $bar) = 1..3</code> is legal but undocumented Perl 6.
Audrey replied that it probably was and requested a use case
example.  James was not able to come up with one at the time.</p>


<p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/6b177bd162fc8163/ae651730a2c7eb9f?#ae651730a2c7eb9f">Linking Synopses to corresponding pod-files?</a> </i> </p>

<p>Markus Laire noted that if synopses referenced their POD files it would
be easier to submit patches for the typographical errors he sometimes
spots.  Juerd replied that replacing &#39;html&#39; with &#39;pod&#39; in the file name
provided the solution.</p>


<p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/c471459223f0d451/5082957f97b53558?#5082957f97b53558">RFC: Community education page</a> </i> </p>

<p>David K Storrs referred to the oft-encountered perspective that Perl 6
is taking a long time and that nothing has been accomplished.  He proposed
a single web page which could display important progress benchmarks, and
offered to create, host and maintain the page if it was seen as a good
idea.  There were a couple of suggestions, including Juerd&#39;s somewhat
unrelated request for an up-to-date wiki covering Pugs.</p>


<p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/0b0a9d2e2c2c4a10/38a2f1d6f986591b?#38a2f1d6f986591b">using the newer collection types</a> </i> </p>

<p>Darren Duncan asked some questions to clarify the syntax of features
of newer types to aid him in his work on implementing a Relation type
for Perl 6.  He received many replies.  Two additional topics were
spawned: &#39;relations as roles&#39; and &#39;using the newer collection types -
Interval&#39;.</p>


<p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/bbf26b4d890ea5e3/678793c0ec292587?#678793c0ec292587">[S05] /ee</a> </i> </p>

<p>Ruud H.G. van Tol asked a question about whether eval was block (try) or
string in a particular context.  Juerd tried to answer.</p>


<p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/5870420e1c65d276/88e47cda2a97f521?#88e47cda2a97f521">&quot;normalized&quot; hash-keys</a> </i> </p>

<p>Ruud H.G. van Tol asked how one would define that a specific hash has
keys which are not case-sensitive.  Some people responded with recollections
of a synopsis which addressed this but no reference was found.  Larry Wall
offered his thoughts on how this would work.</p>


<p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/1386d3c16678b292/cad809fd2049e7eb?#cad809fd2049e7eb">Scans</a> </i> </p>

<p>Gaal Yahas asked how one could express scans (a generalization of reductions)
in Perl 6. The reduce meta operator was subsequently modified to return scans
when invoked in list context. Whether this is actually a good thing is yet to
be decided ;-)</p>


<p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/f9971dd086780aa5/1868464faae238b5?#1868464faae238b5">A rule by any other name...</a> </i> </p>

<p>Allison Randal wrote about her concern that &#39;regex&#39; will always mean
&#39;regular expression&#39; to people who encounter it, and proposed a different
name for a &#39;thingy outside a grammar,&#39; as she described it.  She went
on to list other semantic issues that she has with Perl 6.  The thread
was highly popular and many people contributed.</p>


<p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/9b2d45917b2cc44f/74e48122dd34cd6f?#74e48122dd34cd6f">the &#39;postfix:::&#39; operator</a> </i> </p>

<p>Jerry Gay noted that if the :: postfix operator exists, it should
be added to S03.</p>

<p>The adverb section in S02 led Jerry Gay to wonder if parsing of an adjacent
single and double (for instance &#39;q&#39; and &#39;qq&#39; to form &#39;qqq&#39;) would be
accomplished by matching the longest token first.  Larry replied that
he would like to see if double character adverbs can be made single
characters.  He also offered suggestions on how clarity could be
added in this situation.</p>

<p>Audrey&#39;s commit changed &#39;true&#39; to &#39;True&#39;, which led to Elyse M. Grasso
wondering if &#39;false&#39; had become &#39;False&#39;.  Larry said this was the case,
and that the reason for changing them had been to avoid confusion with
the built-in <code>true()</code> function.  Nicholas Clark and Smylers were slightly
skeptical.</p>


<p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/0bb0e1ae639e5a50/895f0dc6e8ad65a0?#895f0dc6e8ad65a0">r9197 and a new name for sigspace?</a> </i> </p>

<p>A commit led to a discussion on a possible new name for <code>sigspace</code>.
Allison Randal, Nicholas Clark, Ruud H.G. van Tol, Larry Wall, Smylers,
and Chromatic participated.  Suggestions ranged from &#39;SIGSPACE&#39; to
&#39;gappy&#39; to &#39;negative space&#39;.</p>

<p>Herbert Breunung asked for examples of instances where Perl 6 simplifies
Perl 5 code.  These will be used in his tutorial, which will eventually
be translated and added to the Pugs trunk.  Thomas Wittek suggested writing
in English, but Herbert explained that it is much easier for him to make
modifications in his native tongue.</p>

<p>Larry Wall made a commit to remove Prefix * and **.  Also, triangulation in
list context now requires an explicit <code>[\*]</code>.  Markus Laire inquired if
<code>@foo[1;**;5]</code> was still possible with the new syntax, and Larry replied
with a note that he should revisit S09.</p>

<p>Rob Kinyon, who was working on DBM::Deep, asked if it would be easy

was no disagreement, and this was done in r12807.  There was, however,
a discussion on the difficulty of finding deleted files in an SVN
repository.</p>

<p>Will Coleda noted in ticket <a href="http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=39196">[perl #39196]</a> that the addmethod opcode
requires tests.</p>

<p>Joshua Gatcomb was trying to build Parrot after 1.5 years without updating.
He was not sure how to best install it on his Windows system with
limited rights, and Jurosz Michal offered advice.</p>

<p>Leopold Toetsch posted with a proposal on how to handle PBC meta
information based upon his thoughts after reading PDD23.</p>

<p>Joshua Gatcomb noted that having mysys in his path led to unexpected
problems with mingw even when he wasn&#39;t intentionally trying to use mysys.
Andy Dougherty didn&#39;t understand the patch; Joshua explained it just
offered a warning.</p>

<p>Allison Randal created a ticket, <a href="http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=39217">[perl #39217]</a>, to remove the phrase
&quot;All Rights Reserved&quot; from copyright notices. Will Coleda listed a
couple of cases and asked how they would be handled. This led to a
discussion of the history of the phrase, the history of The Perl
Foundation&#39;s name, and the legal status of copyright symbols. r12825
addressed Allison&#39;s request.</p>

<p>Klaas-Jan Stol proposed functionality to reset a coroutine. <br>
Elizabeth Mattijsen and Leopold Toetsch felt it would be useful.</p>

<p>Later, in thread <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/8357f6cbf801acc0/668f36b283385a99?#668f36b283385a99">coroutine segfaults</a>,
Klaas-Jan Stol wrote that if a coroutine is called more times than
it <code>.yield()</code>s, there is a segmentation fault.
Leopold Toetsch replied that this was indeed closely linked to <code>.reset()</code>.</p>

<p>Andy Dougherty informed the parrot porters that he will be stepping away from the Parrot project. He also submitted all his pending patches to RT. Leopold Toetsch thanked him for his contributions so far.</p>
