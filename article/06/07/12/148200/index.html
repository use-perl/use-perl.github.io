<p><p>I'm declaring my YAPC::NA 2006 hackathon over.  <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Perl-Dist/">Perl::Dist</a> (Perl::Dist::Builder),
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Perl-Dist-Vanilla/">Perl::Dist::Vanilla</a> and <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Perl-Dist-Strawberry/">Perl::Dist::Strawberry</a>
are all submitted to CPAN, and checked in to Alias's
<a href="http://svn.phase-n.com/svn/cpan/trunk/">subversion repository</a>.</p></p>
<p><p>Details on Strawberry Perl follow:</p>

<blockquote>
<div> <p>Strawberry Perl Alpha 1 is available from <a href="http://vanillaperl.com/">vanillaperl.com</a>.

</p> <p> <i>This is an alpha release and is not recommended for production purposes.</i> </p>

<p> The Vanilla Perl Project is an experiment to provide binary Perl
distributions for the Microsoft Windows platform that include a bundled
compiler.  Bundling a compiler provides the ability to install XS CPAN modules
directly from CPAN, making the Win32 Perl development more akin to Unix perl
development.  </p>

<p> <b>Strawberry Perl Series</b> </p>

<p>The purpose of the Strawberry Perl series is to provide a more practical
Win32 Perl release for experienced Perl developers to experiment and test the
installation of various CPAN modules under Win32 conditions, and to provide a
useful platform for experienced Perl developers to start doing real work.</p>

<p>In addition to the modules in Vanilla Perl, Strawberry will also include the
entire dependency tree for Bundle::CPAN, as well as an additional set of upgraded
versions of dual CPAN/core modules that have win32-specific fixes.</p>

<h2>Compiler optional?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/bart/">bart</a> on 2006-07-10T00:21:48</h3>
Could you please please please make the download of the compiler optional. I don't wish to download the same multi-megabyte compiler package again and again for every little upgrade of this Perl distro.

<p>That's a great point.  Please add that request to the RT tracker.  However, keep in mind that this is just <i>alpha 1</i> -- there may be some substantial changes along the way, not just "little upgrades".</p>

<p>Generally, if we did the installation right, you won't need every little upgrade as a binary, you can just install new modules from CPAN.  (Maybe the module "upgrades" will be released as a "Task" module to simplify that.)</p>

<p>I imagine that new versions of the installer will mostly improve how the installer integrates the pieces with your operating system and for that we may need a fresh start entirely.</p>

<p>We haven't even really begun to address upgradability at all.  I.e. should everything in perl\site\lib be preserved?  Should only some things be preserved?  There is still a lot to figure out.</p>

The entire mandate of this distribution is that it comes with a compiler built in by default.<br><br>If you do not want a compiler in your Perl distribution, ActiveState makes an excellent Win32 Perl distribution that can meet your needs.<br><br>Further, as dagolden mentions, "each little release" only applies during alpha, and I'm afraid we're going with simplicity here.<br><br>Once we get to production releases, we expect there to only be one release per Perl release. So it adds 10meg of extra download per 6 months.<br><br>I don't see an obvious way to do what you want, and achieve some of the other goals of the project, like making the package installable from Active Directory.

I am talking about upgrades... You're not  suggesting people should upgrade to ActivePerl, are you?
<blockquote> <div><i>I don't see an obvious way to do what you want</i></div> </blockquote>
Well, you could have a package with compiler, and the same package but without compiler, for the people who already have the latter.

<p>Put a current release tarball (unpacked?) on an rsync server, and let rsync do its magic? Clearly this is only easy if someone has a suitable rsync server already set up.</p>

<h3><a href="/user/kwilliams/">kwilliams</a> on 2006-07-14T02:22:11</h3>
Yeah, you could do this with just a regular tarball (doesn't need to be unpacked).  The sequential nature of the tar format should let rsync do its thing fine.<br><br>

You can even use <a href="http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/gzip.htm" title="sourceforge.net">gzip 1.3.5</a sourceforge.net> with the --rsyncable flag, which allows rsync over the entire<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.tar.gz file.

Here's maybe a <a href="http://hpux.cs.utah.edu/ftp/hpux/Gnu/gzip-1.3.5/gzip-1.3.5-src-11.11.tar.Z" title="utah.edu">better</a utah.edu> link.

The link above would need <a href="http://rsync.samba.org/ftp/unpacked/rsync/patches/gzip-rsyncable.diff" title="samba.org">gzip-rsyncable.diff</a samba.org>; the link from sf.net seems to have it pre-applied.

I'm suggesting when people upgrade, we have no idea what will be different.<br><br>In the last round, perl stayed the same, some files moved to different directories, a new version of dmake was bundled, IO from the core was upgraded and so on.<br><br>When you upgrade, you download again. It's once every 6 months or so, so it's no biggie for 90% of people.<br><br>We may well be able to do some sort of no-compiler version for experts, with a big caveat-emptor that we can't predict what will happen with a compiler we haven't preconfigured to work.<br><br>As for the conversation below about release tarballs, I'll point out tarballs are not Active Directory deployable enterprise-wide.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br><br>So there are no release tarballs, there are just<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.exe or<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.msi files.
