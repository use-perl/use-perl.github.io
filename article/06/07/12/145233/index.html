<p><p>This is the Perl 6 Internals correction summary, for the weeks of 2006-02-13 through 2006-02-28, by Ann Barcomb.</p>

<strong>Summary updates</strong>

<p>Thank you to everyone who took the time to point out that I had accidently used February 2003 rather than 2006 for the internals section.
This is the actual summary for February 2006.</p>

<p>Due to the comments received on short URLs,
I have decided to use the originals,
as I also prefer them.</p></p>
<p><strong>Internals (Parrot-Porters) </strong>

<p>This mailing list has been previously called perl6-internals.
It is now known as parrot-porters,
but the perl6-internals name will remain as an alias for now.</p>

<em> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/2bd3817f062bb391/d933f191753ed950#d933f191753ed950">Delayed release</a> </em>

<p>Leopold Toetsch announced the delay of the next release.
The German Perl workshop and a hackathon with Audrey Tang were responsible.</p>

<em>

<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/ab1747c90f421481/9c3626afd31a78ef#9c3626afd31a78ef">Bug: PGE - truncating PIR code generated by p6rule</a> </em>

<p>Allison pushed some code and a test which isolates a failing test in punie so that others could aid in debugging.
Joshua Isom reported success on two platforms,
but noted other problems he encountered,
which Allison recognized as known Parrot::Test bugs.
Some debugging took place.</p>

<em>

<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/c9c18275b496b7e9/5591d2e80a3befcc#5591d2e80a3befcc">Addressing unowned bugs</a> </em>

<p>Joshua Hoblitt requested that people with RT privileges spend a few minutes on the queue attempting to resolve a few bugs and wondered if RT could be configured to leave bugs marked as &#39;new&#39; until they are owned.</p>

<em>

<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/fb225a9efc659093/494794969e869671#494794969e869671">Request for a clean bailout mechanism</a> </em>

<p>In December,
Joshua Hoblitt created a ticket <a href="http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Ticket/Display.html?id=37930">[perl #37930]</a> requesting a clean way for a step to signal a failure.
As of February&#39;s r11568,
all configuration steps were modified.</p>

<em>

<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/68ffbc794c360dcd/74ccb77243eb3c25#74ccb77243eb3c25">Param count mismatch errors enabled</a> </em>

<p>Leopold Toetsch posted that param count mismatches now throw exceptions,
but result/return count mismatches are still not checked.
He included a list of failing tests from r11570 which were affected by this change.</p>

<em>

<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/eaf8290b51fec960/201bf1f682306875#201bf1f682306875">Better gdb support</a> </em>

<p>Leopold Toetsch changed the syntax for registers in r11581.</p>

<em>

<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/a122de6c2bb28a84/d0cbc9de8125b458#d0cbc9de8125b458">Punie test failures in set_node method on Solaris/SPARC</a> </em>

<p>Allison Randal passed on a reported failure on Solaris/SPARC <a href="http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Ticket/Display.html?id=38584">[perl #38584]</a>.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/8a62c2a856f8f082/491e99ef81569e4b#491e99ef81569e4b">another thread</a>,
Andy Dougherty looked into the problem and gave his test results.</p>

<em>

<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/ff41d299917e6ddd/08f39f7b71ca74a1#08f39f7b71ca74a1">Trace improvements</a> </em>

<p>Leopold Toetsch gave a summary of some recent trace improvements.
They were as follows: trace output runs through a dedicated debug interpreter,
the output has been beautified,
and tracing in to a file is faster.</p>

<em>

<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/a113a715bc09b680/4c57d4b0c6828741#4c57d4b0c6828741">Test failures with &#39;long long&#39; on i386/linux</a> </em>

<p>Andy Dougherty reported that this failure persists if one uses 64-bit opcodes on a 32-bit system.
He was not especially concerned about the failure as he had explicitly created the situation in order to test the bug in its original context.</p>

<em>

<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/ab631602d56488a2/2f7dcf037ea477df#2f7dcf037ea477df">Deprecated PMCs</a> </em>

<p>In January,
Leopold Toetsch indicated that FloatvalArray and StringArray would be removed soon.
As of r11602,
they were removed.</p>

<em>

<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/5f2e1982291a0b4f/4948748c64648c97#4948748c64648c97">Future JIT compiler improvements</a> </em>

<p>Leopold Toetsch related a short list of desired JIT compiler improvements from <a href="http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Ticket/Display.html?id=38593">[perl #38593]</a>.</p>

<em>

<p>Leopold Toetsch announced an upcoming release and put a code freeze on feature changes.</p>

<p>Later he <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/bc3eb88cb5379d36/e29c50b5d277c54b#e29c50b5d277c54b">started releasing 0.4.2</a> and blocked all checkins.</p>

<p>And finally,
the release was <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/6de64d017bf83e37/7acac8a6a6cb43d2#7acac8a6a6cb43d2">complete</a>.</p>

<p>Leopold Toetsch commented that the resizeable variant is broken,
and had some comments on what *BooleanArray should support.
Matt Fowles agreed with most of the *BooleanArray reductions,
while Bob Rogers had some questions.
Bernhard Schmalhofer also spoke up.
After seeing the support for the methods,
Leopold Toetsch decided they should remain.</p>

<p>Joshua Hoblitt closed a ticket <a href="http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Ticket/Display.html?id=31138">[perl #31138]</a> which was not addressed and was no longer applicable.</p>

<p>Karl Forner asked a question about list_set_length,
which puzzled him by accepting negative sizes.
He requested a pointer to documentation describing the behavior of the routine.</p>

<p>In October,
Will Coleda noted that <code>--expnetwork</code> from Configure.pl was an unused option which should probably be removed <a href="http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Ticket/Display.html?id=37388">[perl #37388]</a>.
More recently,
Joshua Hoblitt requested clarification and Leopold Toetsch agreed with the removal.</p>

<p>Joshua Hoblitt inquired as to whether <a href="http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Ticket/Display.html?id=31156">[perl #31156]</a> was worth implementing.
Leopold Toetsch asked how to add CFLAGS from a perl Configure.pl command,
and Joshua replied.</p>

<p>Back in September 2005,
James Ghofulpo asked in <a href="http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Ticket/Display.html?id=31980">[perl #31980]</a> if the factorial example was meant to truncate results.
Bernhard Schmalhofer confirmed that he got incorrect results running the example.
Leopold Toetsch noted that most of the examples are outdated.
There was a call to fix the factorials,
and in February Joshua Hoblitt asked what had become of the example.
Leopold Toetsch replied that it had been removed because it was broken.</p>

<p>As long ago as December 2004,
Simon Glover created a ticket <a href="http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Ticket/Display.html?id=33603" rel="nofollow">[perl #33603]</a> noting that undef != undef.
Leopold Toetsch tried to explain why undefs have to be distinct currently.
A patch was proposed,
but rejected,
and in February Joshua Hoblitt asked for some resolution on the issue.</p>

<p>Karl Forner,
a mailing list subscriber,
expressed interest in helping to develop Perl6 and Parrot and asked what he could do.
He was welcomed by Bernhard Schmalhofer,
who proposed a starting place.
Allison Randal responded to the suggestion of a FAQ for contributors by asking if Karl could start by making one.</p>

<p>Sisyphus asked if there was an appropriate place for asking questions relating to building Parrot,
and then asked some questions relating to a Win32 build.
Jonathan Worthington confirmed that this was the right list and offered suggestions.
Nick Glencross also offered advice.</p>

<p>Chris Dolan reported <a href="http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Ticket/Display.html?id=38604" rel="nofollow">[perl #38604]</a> that Mac OS X had a problem with these two files.
Bernhard Schmalhofer indicated that this was due to an svn move,
which caused problems with svn update on case-insensitive filesystems.</p>

<p>Karl Forner believed that the documentation created by 'make html'
were more useful than the documents on the parrotcode website.
He asked a bit about the linking process,
and Will Coleda answered.</p>

<p>Andy Dougherty suggested cutting cutting the memory use in half <a href="http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Ticket/Display.html?id=38577" rel="nofollow">[perl #38577]</a> because his system PANICs from the RAM allocation request.
The patch was applied,
