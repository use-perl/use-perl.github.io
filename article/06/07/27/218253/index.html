People keep finding this, finding it doesn't work, and posting ''how

<p>
<h2> <a name="is_the_std_c89_switch_worth_the_pain">Is the <code>-std=c89</code> switch worth the pain?</a> </h2>
<p>It started when H.Merijn Brand noticed that the recent addition of
the <code>gcc</code> switch (<code>-std=c89</code>, to ensure conformance with the C89
ISO/ANSI standard), caused the Cygwin compiles to develop an
interesting smokey flavour.</p>

<pre>
  That's not supposed to happen
  <a href="http://xrl.us/prdp">http://xrl.us/prdp</a> </pre>
<p>After he fixed that up, he then noticed that an HP/UX box was also
appeared to be rather distressed by the same switch.  Despite the
fact that the <code>gcc</code> compiler in question was a much more recent
edition.</p>
<pre>
  Uh oh
  <a href="http://xrl.us/prdq">http://xrl.us/prdq</a> </pre>
<p>Jarkko Hietaniemi felt H.Merijn's pain, and recast the patch to
enable the switch only where it was proven beyond reasonable doubt
not to cause problems. Much the same way that <code>-ansi -pedantic</code>

cannot be used everywhere.</p>
<p>Nicholas Clark thought that it was safe now and should ever more
be so, on FreeBSD. Rafael described some of the creepy-crawly things
he had encountered in his sojourns through <code>glibc</code> headers, and
concluded that Linux should be scratched off the list altogether.
Jarkko fumed and went to stand in the corner.</p>
<p>Sadly, at the end of the day, no more remained, save for a footnote
buried in the depths of <code>perlhack</code>.</p>

<h2> <a name="thread_exit">Thread Exit</a> </h2>
<p>Jerry D. Hedden summarised the ongoing thread about threads, and
how they should be exited, and how much they should exit. Of note
was a post from Eric Rybski, who has been using the ithreads model
intensively over the past couple of years, and injected an interesting
point of view into the debate. In a nutshell: <em>threads.pm</em>
should not impose global semantics on how threads operate.</p>
<pre>
  Last exit to Threadlyn
  <a href="http://xrl.us/prds">http://xrl.us/prds</a> </pre>
<p>Before going too far down the wrong road, Jerry reported on
what he had come up with, and asked for feedback. Rafael
Garcia-Suarez appreciated the backwards-compatible aspects.</p>
<p>Jan Dubois was a bit uneasy about the behaviour of a thread calling
<code>die</code>.</p>

<pre>
  This way out
  <a href="http://xrl.us/prdt">http://xrl.us/prdt</a> </pre>
<p>And so it came to pass that Jerry released <code>threads</code> version 1.37.
As a bonus, the reworking of <code>Perl_ihtread_hook</code> appears to have
fixed bug #39839, although Dave Mitchell expressed doubt as to
whether the race condition that the bug cites has just been pushed
out somewhere else.</p>
<pre>

<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/prdv">http://xrl.us/prdv</a> </pre>
<p>In preparing this patch, Jerry encountered what he thought was a
bug in <em>test.pl</em> under MSWin32. It turned out to be a problem
with newlines in fragments of <code>-e</code> code.</p>

<p>
<h2> <a name="perlbug_on_windows"> <code>perlbug</code> on Windows</a> </h2>
<p>Steve Hay was puzzled why <code>perlbug</code> was not (apparently) working
on Windows, and traced it down to a Unixism that leads to a
two minute timeout on Windows. He considered a fix that would
work correctly in his corporate environment (using the
<code>USERDNSDOMAIN</code> environment variable), but wondered if this
was applicable to the world at large.</p>

<h2> <a name="b___renovation__and_the_end_of_the_perlcc_compiler"> <code>B::</code> renovation, and the end of the <code>perlcc</code> compiler</a> </h2>
<p>Joshua ben Jore produced a patch to overhaul <code>B::</code>, to drag it kicking
and screaming into the 21st century (the module, not Joshua, although...)</p>
<p>One of his biggest gripes was with <code>B::C</code> and <code>B::CC</code>, that he
would rather see them jettisoned out the airlock, along with <code>perlcc</code>

compiler, saying that all <code>perlcc</code> really does is fixes bugs (in
the same way that flypaper fixes flies). Rafael agreed that this
was a very tempting suggestion.</p>
<p>Nicholas wondered if the cascade of events would lead to the removal
of <code>ext/Byteloader</code> as well. Joshua put forward the best argument
for ditching all of it, and that was if anyone had a burning desire
to get anything along these lines working, their best chance lay
in hooking up with the Parrot and Pugs teams, because that was the
only way they would stand a chance of attracting the attention of
anyone who might be interested in seeing the task achieved. In the
meantime, the perl tarball would shrink, which is a bit of a bonus.</p>

<h2> <a name="using_sv_as_key_in_hash">Using SV as key in hash</a> </h2>
<p>Elizabeth Mattijsen posted this question on Perlmonks but
received no useful answers, so she came and asked the porters.
She wanted to set a hash key to the contents of an SV. In
theory it would appear that the API supports this, however,
it doesn't work in practice. Unfortunately, the porters
didn't appear to have any special insight into the matter, either.</p>

<p>Steve Hay encountered a minor problem due to the changes induced
by generating <em>ppport.h</em> files on the fly. Marcus Holland-Moritz
welcomed the information, and whipped up a fix to solve the
problems. Steve gave it the green light, and Marcus uploaded a

<p>Jarkko continued to untangle the useful bits from the z/OS patch
that the IBM developers posted a while back. He punted on
<em>regexec.c</em>, citing too many differences in the codebase between
then and now, as well as philosophical differences.</p>

<p>Steve Peters wondered whether it might be able to transmute the
<code>Switch</code> module into the <code>switch</code> feature now in <code>blead</code>. Nicholas
Clark thought not, citing problems backwards incompatibility, and
wondered if anybody was particularly interested.</p>

<h2> <a name="eval_and_hash_access_in_subroutine___39816_"> <code>eval</code> and hash access in subroutine (#39816)</a> </h2>
<p>Thomas Ziehmer had a problem with a lexical going out of scope in
a package.  David Landgren offered a work-around, using an <code>our</code>
or package variable.  Dave Mitchell explained why the behaviour was
the way it was.</p>
<p>Rick Delaney took Dave's example and tweaked it to produce a different
message that seemed to be more in line with the behaviour that
Thomas had encountered, and after a follow-up from Dave, we all
understood what was happening.</p>

<h2> <a name="perl5shell_is_not_checked_for_tainted_data___39832_"> <code>PERL5SHELL</code> is not checked for tainted data (#39832)</a> </h2>
<p>There was a lingering suspicion as to whether <code>$ENV{SystemRoot}</code>
and <code>$ENV{windir}</code> required taint checks on Win32, but Jan Dubois
thought that their use was benign as far as Perl was concerned.</p>

<h2> <a name="utf8related_crash___39870_">UTF-8-related crash (#39870)</a> </h2>
<p>``vvv'' supplied a small program demonstrating a core dump with UTF-8.
Andreas Koenig explained that the best way to solve this problem
was to use <code>use utf8</code> instead of <code>use encoding 'utf8'</code>, whilst
cheerfully admitting that it was indeed a bug in <code>use encoding</code>,
that continues to reside even in a recent version of <code>blead</code>

(somewhere around patch 28603).</p>

  Tis a bug

<h2> <a name="0_0_loses_signedness_upon_numeric_comparison___39875_">-0.0 loses signedness upon numeric comparison (#39875)</a> </h2>
<p>Zefram had a problem with -0.0 becoming 0.0 after a numeric comparison.
Yitzchak Scott-Thoennes proposed an interim fix, but asked for a
<code>Configure</code> probe to check for the existence of a C routine
(<code>signbit()</code>) needed to deal with the problem.</p>

<p>H.Merijn thought that this would mean that the bug would persist
on platforms that lacked the function, and Yitzchak agreed, and
asked H.Merijn whether an alternative function (<code>copysign()</code>) would
be better. H.Merijn ran some code and produced some statistics of
its availability.</p>

<code>Time::gmtime</code>. Steve Peters applied the fixes, and bumped the version
up to 1.03.</p>

<p>Bo Lindbergh ran into problems with slices of empty lists, and found the
different behaviours of <code>sort</code>, <code>grep</code>, <code>do</code> and company rather
inconsistent.</p>

<h2> <a name="isa_cache_leaks_into_and_out_of_safe_compartments___39887_"> <code>ISA</code> cache leaks into and out of <code>Safe</code> compartments (#39887)</a> </h2>
<p>Marc Lehmann discovered, through a quirk in the method caching
code, that it is possible to have methods names leak into and out
of <code>Safe</code> compartments. He proposed a quick work-around to avoid
his specific problem, and a tactical nuclear strike to solve the
problem in the general case, but wondered whether the latter was
too heavy-handed. At the other end of the spectrum there is the
possibility to simply document the behaviour and move on.</p>

<p>Nobody had sufficient motivation to comment one way or the other.</p>

<p>``shadrinovdd'' had a problem with character 160, which, when interpreted
according to ISO Latin-1 rules, is a non-breaking space. And this
causes different user-visible behaviours to emerge, depending on
whether the UTF-8 flag is switched on for the string.</p>
<p>Much discussion ensued as to what the right course of action should
be.</p>
