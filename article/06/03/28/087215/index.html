<p><a href="http://yapcchicago.org/">jmcada</a> writes <i>"<a href="http://chicago.pm.org/">Chicago.pm</a> is proud to announce that <a href="http://www.yapcchicago.org/zencart">registration</a> is open for Yet Another Perl Conference North America (YAPC::NA) 2006.  The primary conference will occur June 26th through 28th at the Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago, Illinois.  The conference will feature speakers from throughout the Perl community, as well as, keynote addresses from luminaries such as Larry Wall, the creator of Perl, and guest speakers from the broader dynamic languages and open source communities.  The full three-day conference costs only $100, but early registrants can take advantage of a 15% discount and attend the conference for only $85.  With such a low cost, YAPC is one of the most affordable and accessible technical conferences available today.
</i></p>
<p><i>
<br>
In addition to the conference, three open courses will be offered on June 29th and 30th.  These courses are taught by some of the most notable Perl instructors: brian d foy, Randal Schwartz, and Damian Conway.  The courses will all run simultaneously during the two days after the conference.  Conference attendance is not required when signing up for classes, but it is encouraged.
<br> <br>
Seats for the conference and for the open classes are limited, so be sure to <a href="http://www.yapcchicago.org/zencart">register</a> today and guarantee your spot at YAPC!  Also, if you are planning on lodging and/or parking on-campus during the conference, or dining in the university cafeteria, you should include those items when registering."</i></p>
