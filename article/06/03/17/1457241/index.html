<h2> <a name="routines_that_accept_a_file_name_or_a_filehandle">Routines that accept a file name or a filehandle</a> </h2>
</p> <p>Salvador Fandino was trying to override <code>CORE::GLOBAL::stat</code> when
he discovered that there is no way to be able to distinguish
between a filename <code>'Foo'</code> and a bareword filehandle <code>Foo</code>.</p>
<p>Salvador patched the prototyping mechanism to permit</p>
<pre>
  C&lt;sub my_stat (/) {...}&gt;</pre>
<p>to mean that a bareword will be converted to a typeglob. Rafael Garcia-Suarez
replied that <code>stat</code> already had a prototype of <code>*</code> (star). Salvador
showed why that didn't work the way he wanted. Rafael thought that
it would be better to fix the <code>'*'</code> prototype rather than introduce a
new one, on the basis that replacements of built-ins really are supposed
to behave identically the built-ins they are replacing.</p>
<p>Salvador was worried that changing the behaviour of <code>*</code> would introduce
backwards compatibility problems, and maintained his <code>/</code> idea. Rafael
asked for examples where problems could arise, and remained somewhat
unconvinced. Salva showed what the problem was from his perspective,
and admitted that his solution was a bit ugly, but
couldn't think of anything better, if backwards compatibility were
to be maintained.</p>
<p>Nick Ing-Simmons suggested that the replacement do just what <code>stat</code>
does -- checks to see whether the string exists as a glob, but Salvador
maintained that such a check had the potential for error, and pointed
out in the code why things can get messed up.</p>
<p>Nick began to accept the validity of Salva's argument, saying only that
he didn't like the choice of <code>/</code> (slash) as the prototype key. H.Merijn
Brand ruled out a number of characters that would cause grief for
simple-minded syntax highlighters. Nick suggested <code>+</code> (like a star) or
<code>?</code> (conditional globbing could be occurring).</p>

<h2> <a name="overriding_filetest_operators">Overriding filetest operators</a> </h2>
</p> <p>Salvador also supplied a patch to allow the filetest operators to
be overridden. Given the previous thread about overriding <code>stat</code>,
Nick Ing-Simmons wanted to get to the bottom of things and find out
what Salvador really needed to do.</p>
<p>It turns out that Salvador is writing a module to manipulate remote
file systems transparently via <code>sftp</code>. In the process of doing so
he had uncovered various oddities, which was the reason for patches.</p>
<p>Nick and Yitzchak Scott-Thoennes thought that a more promising
approach would be to use the IO abstractions available in PerlIO,
rather than the approach based on <code>tie</code>s that Salva was using.</p>
<p>The thread continued on for quite some time, debating whether or
not Perl 5 is an evolving language and whether the prototype
scheme was in need of tweaking.</p>

<h2> <a name="threads_and_vms">Threads and VMS</a> </h2>
</p> <p>We left John E. Malmberg and Craig A. Berry last week trying to
build a threaded core that didn't splatter itself out over the
landscape. Considerable progress was made this week: John spotted
some memory leaks, Craig saw that some memory was being
allocated before the threads subsystem was fully operational,
which caused grief when that memory was later <code>free</code>ed, since
the thread housekeeping code knew nothing about it.</p>
<p>John was still getting some errors in the test suite in the
end.</p>
<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/kgma">http://xrl.us/kgma</a> </pre>
<p>Another problem John ran into was that he was able to provoke
<code>Perl_safesysfree</code> into freeing memory allocated by <code>malloc</code>,
because a race condition in updating an internal linked list
structure. Dave Mitchell thought that the linked lists in
question were allocated on a per-thread basis, so they should
be safe.</p>
<p>John eventually traced the problem to a completely different piece
of code that he had been working on, and therefore suggested that
the linked list <code>next</code> and <code>prev</code> pointers be poisoned (that is,
overwritten with garbage values) so that the use of already-freed
memory would be noticed the first time it was attempted.</p>

<h2> <a name="source_code_analysis_with_coverity">Source code analysis with Coverity</a> </h2>
</p> <p>Andy Lester had a look at the results of applying Coverity (a static
source code analysis tool) to see what came out the other end. He found
an unnecessary <code>NULL</code> check in <code>Digest::SHA</code>.</p>
<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/kgmc">http://xrl.us/kgmc</a> </pre>
<p>David Dyck looked at a <code>NULL</code> dereference in <em>Zlib.xs</em> and wondered
whether it too had unnecessary code guards around it. Marcus Holland-Moritz
showed that the checks were indeed necessary. Paul Marquess fixed up his
local copy of <code>Compress::Zlib</code> to guard against what Marcus had discovered.</p>
<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/kgmd">http://xrl.us/kgmd</a> </pre>
<p>Andy found another code fragment in <em>pp_hot.c</em> that could be
tightened up, resulting in a cascade that caused another pointer
to go <code>const</code>.</p>
<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/kgme">http://xrl.us/kgme</a> </pre>
<p>Elsewhere, in <em>toke.c</em>, he pulled some variable declarations down
into tighter scopes. In the process of applying the patch, Nicholas
discovered another tiny tweak.</p>

<h2> <a name="allocating_opcodes_from_an_arena">Allocating op-codes from an arena</a> </h2>
</p> <p>One of things to do in the huge evergrowing pulsating TODO list is to
allocate OPs from an arena. Nicholas Clark thought that there might be
a big win due to the  resulting simplification of allocation and
freeing of ops.</p>
<p>Jim Cromie, who has been spending a lot of time recently on these
matters thought that it might be an overall loss, due the fact that
the CPU would probably wind up trampling over a far larger section
of memory and thus ruining the cache.</p>
<p>All the same, he wrote a patch to allow the arenarisation of op
allocations to allow the issue to be explored in more detail.</p>

<h2> <a name="mentioning_the_new_constant_routines_in_perlxstut">Mentioning the new constant routines in <code>perlxstut</code> </a> </h2>
</p> <p>Achim Grolms filed a bug report after looking at <code>perlxstut</code> should
made no mention of new constant subroutine construction mechanism
<code>newCONSTSUB</code>. He felt it deserved a mention. Marcus Holland-Moritz
told him to send the documentation patches to the list (the maintainer
e-mail address in <code>perlxstut</code> was bouncing).</p>

<h2> <a name="coroutine_support_in_the_perl_core">Coroutine support in the perl core</a> </h2>
</p> <p>Marc Lehmann, author of the <code>Coro</code> module, had a wishlist of items that,
if implemented, would improve the its functionality. Part of the
effort of getting <code>Coro</code> to work involves from reusing code
from the guts of perl, which leads to problems when said guts undergo
changes. Marc was hoping to have something more stable upon which
to hang his work.</p>
<p>Nick Ing-Simmons noted the similarities between Marc's needs, and
those of threads and wondered whether the current global/interpreter/thread
variable model needs a new "coro" category as a subset of thread
variables. Marc said that sometimes he needs to copy variables,
sometimes he needs to clone them. Nick wondered whether a new
"weird" category was also needed. All this probably only makes sense
if you understand coroutines already -- I had to reread Dan Sugalski's
blog.</p>
<p>Yuval Kogman added his own wishlist to the Coro module: to make them
serialisable. Marc was of the opinion that such a thing was theoretically
impossible. To do it in practice would involve giving up a certain
number of features, such as closures.</p>
<p>Yves Orton said that <code>Data::Dump::Streamer</code> was able to serialise
closures, although he wasn't sure whether it was applicable in the
current instance. Marc posted a snippet showing that it doesn't
work. Things batted back and forth a bit Yves saying it could, Marc
saying it couldn't. Looking at the code posted by both Marc and
Yves it looks to me as if they're both correct, they're just not
talking about the same things.</p>
<p>Yves was showing that it was possible to recreate the universe.
March was showing how it's not possible to take something from
the universe and then put it back again.</p>

<h2> <a name="should_truncate_perform_a_seek">Should <code>truncate</code> perform a <code>seek</code> </a> </h2>
</p> <p>H.Merijn Brand was having problems with the fact that after truncating
a file, the file pointer (&#224; la <code>seek</code> and <code>tell</code>) was now
pointing into limbo. This would mean that a subsequent print would
create a sparse file. Gellyfish, er, Johnathon Stowe thought that
the problem was more one of documentation than implementation.</p>
<p>Gisle Aas produced an explanation that was sufficient to make
H.Merijn change his mind.</p>

<h2> <a name="larry_s_perl_5_to_perl_5_convertor">Larry's Perl 5 to Perl 5 convertor</a> </h2>
</p> <p>In preparation for Perl 6, Larry Wall has been writing a Perl 5 to Perl 5
convertor. Nicholas Clark had the unenviable task of merging Larry's work
into <code>blead</code> (in that the code base has moved around around considerably
since Larry took a copy to work on). It's now available if you compile
with -Dmad (Misc Attribute Decoration -- I suspect we'll be hearing a lot
about this in the future).</p>
<p>Alas, the code was not working as expected. After some serious grief and
punishment, Nicholas got it all working correctly. Yay!</p>

<h2> <a name="madly_duplicated_files">Madly duplicated files</a> </h2>
</p> <p>Dave Mitchell started to look at the new MAD code
and was worried at the presence of files
that had been copied and then modified, such as <em>regen_perly.pl</em>
becoming <em>regen_madly.pl</em>.</p>
<p>Dave pleaded for some creative <code>#ifdef</code>ing to merge the two
files back into one, to avoid them drifting out of sync.</p>
<p>Nicholas Clark tended to agree. So did Larry. It seems that
for some files, simple <code>#ifdef</code>s should suffice, but there
will be some cases where the only solution is to create
a meta-file that can be processed to emit, say, <em>perly.y</em>
or <em>madly.y</em>, depending on what the build requires.</p>

</p> <p>Craig A. Berry was running into trouble following on from change
#27453. The two files <em>P5RE.pm</em> and <em>P5re.pm</em> map to the same
name on a case-insensitive file system, which results in either
last-one-standing wins, or infinite loops when synching the
<code>blead</code> repository with <code>rsync</code>.</p>
<p>Larry replied that the correct file to use was <em>P5re.pm</em>, the
other one can be axed, which is exactly what Nick Clark went
ahead and did.</p>

<h2> <a name="fixing_extutils__install_on_win32">Fixing <code>ExtUtils::Install</code> on Win32</a> </h2>
</p> <p>Adam Kennedy reported that his Vanilla Perl, a Windows installer
for Perl and MinGW was almost ready, except for a problem with
<code>ExtUtils::Install</code>, and the fact that it's difficult to
replace a file that is in use. He wanted to know what the status
of <code>ExtUtils::Install</code> was, and whether any progress had been
made on this front.</p>
<p>Randy Sims said that Yves Orton had done all the necessary footwork,
but Michael Schwern is still the putative owner and things are in
limbo at the moment, since Michael is apparently lost in the Worlds
of Warcraft.</p>
<p>Randy took Yves' second patch and applied it against <code>blead</code> with
some minor additions. Yves spotted a couple of problems and Randy
promised to fix them up. It all finally wound up looking good.</p>

</p> <p>Marc Lehmann wanted to know where it in the documentation it
explains that</p>
<pre>
  perl -e '@a = (undef); map $_-&gt;{x}, @a'</pre>
<p>runs without error, but</p>
<pre>
  perl -e '$#a = 1; map $_-&gt;{x}, @a'</pre>
<p>dies with a "Modification of a read-only value attempted".  He
wondered whether they should behave in the same manner.  Larry Wall
replied saying that it was vaguely implied by reading the documentation
for <code>exists</code>, in that it allows for testing for the presence of
an element in an array, regardless of whether it is some value or
<code>undef</code>.</p>
<p>This in turn permits sparse arrays to be implemented with
arrays, and not just with hashes.</p>
<p>Marc more or less agreed, but still had trouble tying it back
to pre-extended arrays. Nicholas Clark agreed that the
error Marc ran could be interpreted as an artifact of
the implementation, and probably should be fixed.</p>

<h2> <a name="opening___triggers_unjustified_taint_check___38709_">Opening <code>|-</code> triggers unjustified taint check (#38709)</a> </h2>
</p> <p>Martin Hasch discovered that opening <code>|-</code> will trigger an
<code>$ENV{PATH}</code> taint check, even though no <code>PATH</code> dependency
is involved. He noticed that the problem started to occur from
5.8.7 onwards, including <code>blead</code>. Furthermore, he tracked the
problem down to what may have been an over-optimisation in
<em>doio.c</em>, restored the previous behaviour, and added a couple
of tests to ensure it continues to work.</p>
<p>Rick Delaney confirmed Martin's hypothesis, tracing the problem
to change #23725, which accidently lost an single character (a
<code>!</code>, thus inverting the truth of a conditional).</p>

on Win32. Ilya said that the bug wasn't in <code>Term::ReadLine</code>, but
rather the Windows <code>CON</code> device driver, and suggested where to add
a work-around.</p>
<p>Johnathon confirmed that Ilya was correct, and nearly had the bug
nailed, except for a nagging problem with carriage returns that
