<p>[Part of last week's summary vanished into a worm-hole
of the space-time continuum, and reappeared this week. The
missing portion is reproduced below.]</p>
<p>
<h2> <a name="fixing_the_your_makefile_has_been_rebuilt_tedium">Fixing the <code>Your Makefile has been rebuilt</code> tedium</a> </h2>
</p> <p>Dave Mitchell grew tired of the fact that the tiniest change to
the perl source causes all the extensions to be rebuilt as well.
This is because they all have a dependency on <em>lib/Config.pm</em>,
which itself is rebuilt each time <code>miniperl</code> is rebuilt.</p>
<p>So Dave changed things around to so that it (and <em>lib/Config_heavy.pl</em>)
are only updated if in fact they actually change during a rebuild.</p>
<p>Nicholas thought that this might break parallel makes, and that
the <code>mv-if-diff</code> hack was removed as it  operated on a similar principle,
causing <code>make</code> to consider that the Unicode tables were
perpetually out of date, which caused <code>Encode</code> to be needlessly
rebuilt many times over in a single run.</p>

<h2> <a name="why_sv_mortalcopy__sv_no_">Why <code>sv_mortalcopy(&amp;sv_no)</code>?</a> </h2>
</p> <p>Nicholas Clark saw that the source code uses the idiom</p>
<pre>
  PUSHs(sv = sv_mortalcopy(&amp;PL_sv_no));</pre>
<p>which dates back as far as 5.003, and wondered why the more reasonable
construct</p>
<pre>
  PUSHs(sv = sv_newmortal());</pre>
<p>wasn't used instead. Dave Mitchell thought of a couple of reasons
why, such as the <code>getpw*</code> returning empty scalars for unsupported
features, but in the general case it was probably quite unnecessary.
Yitzchak Scott-Thoennes realised that there was a subtle difference
between the two constructs.</p>
<p>This all came about because of change #27612, in which Nicholas
changed when and where <code>sv_mortalcopy</code> was used in <em>pp_sys.c</em>.</p>

</p> <p>Jerry D. Hedden mentioned that he had received a couple of bug
reports concerning the new API for thread stack sizes, concerning
threads allocating a stack size of exactly 2Mb. Jerry wondered whether
this was some sort of 32/64-bit conversion failure and was otherwise
stuck as to figuring out where to go from here.</p>

complexity it adds probably outweighs the benefits.</p>

<h2> <a name="redundant__config_d_sitearch__paths">Redundant <code>$Config{d_sitearch}</code> paths</a> </h2>
</p> <p>Gisle Aas noted that if you configure perl and set <code>$sitearch</code> to
be the same as <code>$archlib</code> then the same directory appears twice in
the <code>@INC</code> path, which is silly.</p>
<p>Gisle wanted to patch this, but wasn't sure whether he could dive
straight in, or whether it required hacking on <code>metaconfig</code>.</p>
<p>To make matters worse, he found that <code>SITELIB_STEM</code> could add
yet a third copy of the same directory to <code>@INC</code>, and came up with
one patch to rule them all.</p>

<h2> <a name="multiple_perl_version_support_quandary">Multiple Perl version support quandary</a> </h2>
</p> <p>John Peacock admitted to having been exceedingly naughty in
releases new versions of <code>version</code> and not testing them on older
perls. Some of the code contained 5.6-isms (notably dealing with
warnings), and wondered what to do to make it work again on 5.005.</p>
<p>John thought that the easiest way would be to fake up an <em>ersatz</em>
<code>warnings</code> module, but then, he wasn't sure how to pull off
something like <code>no warnings qw(redefine)</code>.</p>
<p>Nick Ing-Simmons provided a elegantly devious lightweight solution
that please John no end. Yitzchak thought of a problem that John's
final implementation might have, and provided another improvement.</p>

<h2> <a name="do_perl_flexible_exceptions_work">Do <code>PERL_FLEXIBLE_EXCEPTIONS</code> work?</a> </h2>
</p> <p>Nicholas was working (or not) with <code>PERL_FLEXIBLE_EXCEPTIONS</code> and
came to the conclusion that due to a compilation error, it didn't
work, couldn't work, and could never have worked in over six years
and twelve stable releases of Perl. Given that no bug reports have
been received to date, Nicholas concluded that they could be scrapped
without causing any harm.</p>
<p>Nick Ing-Simmons cautioned about being too hasty, saying that
this mechanism was there to allow Perl to be compiled natively
by a C++ compiler, to map C's <code>longjmp</code> to C++'s <code>throw</code>.</p>
<p>So Nicholas went off and tried to compile perl with a C++
compiler (<code>g++</code>) on Linux and FreeBSD. Everything failed, usually
due to prototypes not being sufficiently precise (mainly
<code>char *</code> <em>versus</em> <code>const char *</code>. From which one may
conclude that it may be possible to compile Perl with a C++
compiler out of the box, but certainly not with a common
C++ compiler on two of the most common Unix platforms.</p>

<h2> <a name="making_the_io__socket_tests_pass_on_win32">Making the <code>IO::Socket</code> tests pass on Win32</a> </h2>
</p> <p>Yves Orton sent in a patch to get <code>IO::Socket</code> to run its test
suite correctly on a threaded Windows build. He had a look at
<code>IO::Pipe</code>, but couldn't think of a sane enough approach to make
it work.</p>
<p>Steve Hay couldn't get it to smoke cleanly on a non-threaded
build, and Yves asked for advice on a better indicator to decide
whether or not to skip some of the tests (that deal with <code>fork</code>ing).</p>
<p>Steve Hay showed how various configure-time switches can be
combined in different ways to make all sorts of threadish behaviour
in Windows. Andy Dougherty said that the right way of seeing
whether <code>fork</code> was implemented was to look at <code>$Config{d_fork}</code>.
And if that gave bogus results, well by golly it ought to be fixed
up so that it gave a useful result.</p>
<p>Yves thought that this was a marvellous idea... except that it
didn't solve the problems for all the perls out there in the
field today.</p>
<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/kqp3">http://xrl.us/kqp3</a> </pre>

<h2> <a name="perl_memory_management_and_documentation">Perl memory management and documentation</a> </h2>
</p> <p>Tom Schindl thought that the documentation was unclear on the concept of
explicitly setting lexical variables to <code>undef</code> to release memory inside
a scope. Pointers were given to various book references, and Yitzchak
Scott-Thoennes summed up Perl's memory strategy nicely: "allocate as early
as possible and for as long as possible".</p>
<p>Sadahiro Tomoyuki observed that while there are techniques for
pre-extending arrays and hashes, no Perl-level technique is available
for scalars (although <code>SvGROW</code> can be used from XS code). This could be
useful for strings that are expected to become very large. He suggested
that making <code>length($string)</code> lvalue-able, as in</p>
<pre>
  length($str) = 700000000</pre>
<p>to tell perl to allocate that many bytes for a scalar could be very helpful
(notwithstanding the usual provisos about characters not equal to bytes in
Unicode strings).</p>

<h2> <a name="how_should___h_work_with_lexical_pragmata">How should <code>%^H</code> work with lexical pragmata</a> </h2>
</p> <p>One of Robin Houston's many contribution to <code>blead</code> last year was a
somewhat arcane improvement that concerned <code>%^H</code> (the hints variable)
being made available to <code>eval</code> blocks.</p>
<p>Nicholas Clark used Robin's insight to help finish lexical pragmata, and
was running into conceptual difficulties over the state of contents of
<code>%^H</code> at compile time and run time, and when to make it readable or
writable.</p>
<p>The fundamental problem that needs to be addressed is that the state of
the hints get compiled into the op-tree, which means that changing the
setting of a hint has no effect (hence the "read-only" nature of the
beast) once the code has been compiled.</p>
<p>Rafael pointed out that that was just it: <code>%^H</code> and <code>$^H</code> are for
affecting compilation and, as they stand, are just not useful at
run time.</p>
<p>Something that does have an effect at run time, <em>warnings.pm</em> uses
its own variable, a bitfield, which is stored in the op-tree in its
own right, which is how warnings can come and go during run time.</p>
<p>Nicholas had a look at the definition of <code>struct cop</code>, as that seemed
to be the logical place from which to hang hints, but then realised
that since op-trees are shared between threads there's no sane way to
make it read-write as well (since that would mean all threads would
inherit the change of hinting an any thread).</p>
<p>Nicholas finished up doing an extreme programming number: writing the test to
prove that lexical pragmata work. And then subsequently committed a
patch that made the test succeed.</p>
<p>Then Hugo admitted to being slightly confused. That's good. I was
confused all along.</p>

  <a href="http://xrl.us/kqp8">http://xrl.us/kqp8</a> </pre>
<p>Rafael Garcia-Suarez played around with the pragma stuff and
came up with a user-level pragma example. David Nicol and
Nicholas played around with that, and the feedback from the
exercise resulted in a couple of other code tweaks.</p>
<p>(In case you're wondering, a pragma is a module with a lower
case name that can be turned on and off through the code. Two
prime examples are <code>use strict</code>/<code>no strict</code> and
<code>use warnings</code>/<code>no warnings</code>).</p>
<pre>
  Your very own pragma
  <a href="http://xrl.us/kqp9">http://xrl.us/kqp9</a> </pre>
<p>At the same time, Rafael thought that it ought to be possible to
make encoding lexical as well, and set about trying to find out
what was still needed to get it to work. Nicholas and he thrashed
out the details.</p>

<h2> <a name="combining_utf16_output_with__crlf_is_awkward">Combining UTF-16 output with :crlf is awkward</a> </h2>
</p> <p>In a parallel universe (read: another mailing list), Jan Dubois discovered
that stacking the <code>:crlf</code> layer on top of a Unicode layer causes "Wide character
in print" warnings to be issued. The work-around is the use the (in Jan's words)
"non-intuitive" <code>:raw:encoding(UTF-16LE):crlf:utf8</code> layers together, to turn
off the <code>PERLIO_F_UTF8</code> bit in the <code>:crlf</code> layer.</p>
<p>Jan wondered whether it would be possible for <code>PerlIOCrlf_pushed()</code> to
inherit the flag from the previous layer, or whether <code>PerlIO_isutf8()</code> should
walk the layer stack in order to determine what it should do.</p>
<p>Nick Ing-Simmons preferred the first approach, going as far as saying that that
should actually be the default behaviour for a layer. The second solution has
the problem of a layer having to determine whether some other arbitrary layer
affects UTF-8 or not.</p>

<h2> <a name="thread_nonsafety_in_sv_setsv">Thread non-safety in <code>sv_setsv</code> </a> </h2>
</p> <p>Nicholas was rather distressed to discover a problem with <code>sv_setsv_flags</code>
may put an end to a workable copy-on-write scheme in threaded builds.
This came about from looking at the hints implementation, and the fact
that threads share op-trees.</p>

<h2> <a name="devel__dprof_consting"> <code>Devel::DProf</code> <code>const</code>ing</a> </h2>
</p> <p>Andy Lester had a look at <code>Devel::DProf</code> to see about the bugs
Jarkko Hietaniemi raised a while back. He wasn't able to fix
anything yet, but did clean the code up somewhat, and added some

</p> <p>Following on from John Malmberg's plea to have allocated and

to cause errant dereferences to be noticed earlier, Jarkko added
a patch	to do just that.</p>
<p>Now allocations can be initialised with <code>0xAB</code> (also known as
<em>strawberry cyanide</em>) and freed memory can be overwritten with
<code>0xEF</code> (or <em>blueberry lithium</em>). Andy wondered how we'd gone

<p>When Dave said he thought his patch would allow a whole pile of
bugs to be closed out, he wasn't joking.</p>
<p>Steve attempted to close out <code>Regular expression causes segfault (#36903)</code>
but was having access permission problems in retrieving the test code
to be used for the bug. Milo Thurston provided another URL to get at
the code.</p>

<h1> <a name="in_brief">In Brief</a> </h1>
</p> <p>Alan Burlison forwarded a message about a new project that had been
formed to deal with <strong>programming language vulnerabilities</strong>.</p>
<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/kqq5">http://xrl.us/kqq5</a> </pre>
<p>Hugo van der Sanden added a brief documentation patch to clarify the
fact that you cannot use <code>times()</code> to obtain <strong>the elapsed time
consumed by running child processes</strong>, only for finished processes that
have been <code>wait</code>ed upon.</p>

  <a href="http://xrl.us/kqq6">http://xrl.us/kqq6</a> </pre>
<p>David Nicol proposed a <code>Tie::MaskedArray</code> technique for <strong>avoiding
the remotely tied global localized with a sigil exploit</strong>. I'm a little
hazy on the details of this particular exploit. David's techique proposes to
replace <code>local</code>, more slowly, but also more safely.</p>

  <a href="http://xrl.us/kqq7">http://xrl.us/kqq7</a> </pre>
<p>John L. Allen forwarded the <strong>current, best patch for <code>pow()</code> </strong> on AIX.</p>
<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/kqq8">http://xrl.us/kqq8</a> </pre>
<p>Jim Cromie updated the documentation to make it more clear what
happens when one does something like <strong> <code>Configure -des -DNoSuchConfigureFlag</code> </strong>.</p>

  <a href="http://xrl.us/kqq9">http://xrl.us/kqq9</a> </pre>
<p>Robin Barker found a bug in <code>Readonly</code> in 5.8.8 and so fixed the
bug, and added a test to <em>t/op/tie.t</em> to make sure the problem
doesn't return.</p>

<p>Paul Marquess provided  <strong>a small patch to the zip test harness for
<code>IO::Compress::Zip</code> </strong>.</p>

  <a href="http://xrl.us/kqrb">http://xrl.us/kqrb</a> </pre>
<p>Sadahiro Tomoyuki looked at some of <strong>the recent changes</strong> to the
source and found <strong>some unmatching of parameters and types</strong>.
Nicholas updated <em>embed.fnc</em> to take that into account.</p>
<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/kqrc">http://xrl.us/kqrc</a> </pre>
<p>Andy had a go at <strong>linting the source</strong> with Sun Studio's lint,
and found lots of things that need to be looked at, and wondered
whether there were any other lint-like tools freely available that
could be applied. Jarkko mentioned FlexeLint (a.k.a Gimpel Lint),
which is very nice, but not free.</p>

  <a href="http://xrl.us/kqrd">http://xrl.us/kqrd</a> </pre>
<p>Yves Orton found <strong>a tainting oddity</strong> that should possibly be
documented. Yitzchak thought that some patches that remove the
surprising behaviour would also be well received.</p>

<p>H.Merijn Brand <strong>backported</strong> all of recent changes made by Nicholas in
<code>blead</code>'s <em>Configure</em> to that of <code>maint</code>. At the end of the week
he was still busy filling in gaps in <em>Porting/Glossary</em>.</p>

</p> <p>Craig Berry corrected my misreading of the <code>Module::Build</code>
on VMS thread, which is that the VMS port currently doesn't
offer the list form of piped <code>open</code>.</p>
