<div class="span8">
<p>Welcome to this week's P5P summary, with all sorts of interesting new stuff on regular expressions, threads and other improvements.</p>
<p><h1> <a name="topics_of_interest">Topics of Interest</a> </h1>

<h2> <a name="redoing_the_regular_expression_api">Redoing the regular expression API</a> </h2>
<p>Yitzchak Scott-Thoennes suggested that Yves Orton send in a patch
to pull out some of the ancillary functions in <code>Data::Dump::Streamer</code>
in order to make them available in the core distribution.</p>
<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/k2x7">http://xrl.us/k2x7</a> </pre>
<p>So Yves did just that. The first addition is to add <code>reftype_name()</code>, that
behaves like <code>reftype</code> except that it returns false rather than <code>undef</code>
on non-references. This removes the need for fussy make-work code on the
client side to avoid warnings.</p>
<p>The second addition is a <code>regex()</code> function, which makes it easier to
deal with patterns, whether they have been blessed into other namespaces
or not.</p>
<p>Graham Barr admitted that the return value of <code>reftype()</code> was a mistake,
and <code>reftype_name()</code> was acceptable, but felt that the <code>regex()</code>
function was better off in the <code>Regexp</code> module.</p>
<p>Yves didn't like the fact that <code>Scalar::Util::reftype</code> returns <code>SCALAR</code>
instead of something like <code>REGEX</code>. Nick Ing-Simmons liked the idea, but
thought that it was too dangerous for <code>maint</code>.</p>
<p>Another sub-thread in the discussion revolved around whether a qr//
thing is an object or a type. It is, in fact, an object, but Yves argued
that it is much more useful to treat it as a type. Graham agreed to
disagree.</p>
<p>Adam Kennedy admitted to using <code>Regexp</code>s as objects quite a bit and
would be happy to see the <code>Regexp</code> module receive a dose of
spring-cleaning (which I suppose means fixing up the reblessing
inconsistency that Yves was getting at).</p>
<p>Another hassle Yves pointed out was the non-reversibility of
stringifying regexps:</p>
<pre>
  my $qr=qr/foo/;
  my $str=&quot;$qr&quot;;
  print qr/$str/; # equivalent but not equal</pre>
<p>Dave Mitchell pointed out that a regular expression currently <em>is</em>
a scalar, it just happens to have a bit of magic attached...</p>
<pre>
  Shouldering the weight of history
  <a href="http://xrl.us/k2x8">http://xrl.us/k2x8</a> </pre>
<p>
<h2> <a name="silly_regexp_tricks">Silly regexp tricks</a> </h2>
</p> <p>Hugo van der Sanden returned to the super-linear cache bug (a <code>||</code>
logical or instead of a <code>|</code> bitwise or) in the regular expression
engine, and came up with a suitable test case:</p>
<pre>
  (&quot;a&quot; x 31) =~ /^(a*?)(?!(a{6}|a{5})*$)/;
  print length($1);</pre>
<p>This prompted Yitzchak Scott-Thoennes to come up with another bug
that showed how <code>blead</code> broke existing behaviour. Since no-one
should ever have come to rely on this behaviour, it was all quietly
swept under the rug. Dave Mitchell hinted that he was working on
New Stuff in the engine.</p>
<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/k2x9">http://xrl.us/k2x9</a> </pre>
<p>
<h2> <a name="bringing_threads_into_the_third_millenium">Bringing <code>threads</code> into the third millenium</a> </h2>
</p> <p>Jerry D. Hedden continued to send patches to sync CPAN's <code>thread</code>s with
<code>blead</code>, first by removing a superfluous counter.</p>
<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/k2ya">http://xrl.us/k2ya</a> </pre>
<pre>
  and again
  <a href="http://xrl.us/k2yb">http://xrl.us/k2yb</a> </pre>
<pre>
  and reworked the threads destruct call
  <a href="http://xrl.us/k2yc">http://xrl.us/k2yc</a> </pre>
<p>He vented his frustration at the slow pace with which the patches
were getting applied, believing that he was playing by the rules
as much as possible. Rafael was very apologetic, explaining that
he understands so little about threads that he's barely qualified
to apply them. And apart from Rafael, there aren't too many
alternatives.</p>
<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/k2yd">http://xrl.us/k2yd</a> </pre>
<p>
<h2> <a name="backporting_the_new_blead_re_improvements_to_maint">Backporting the new <code>blead</code> RE improvements to <code>maint</code> </a> </h2>
</p> <p>Nicholas Clark posted a proof-of-concept update to <em>re.pm</em> to deliver
Dave Mitchell's iterative (as opposed to recursive) implementation
of the regular expression to perl 5.8.1 and beyond. A few show-stoppers
need to be cleaned up: some coredumps in the test suite need to be
sorted out and some tweaks to <em>ppport.h</em> are needed. As a bonus,
Yves Orton's trie work comes along for the ride.</p>
<pre>
  More songs about building regexps

<p>
<h2> <a name="valgrind_and_perl_5"> <code>valgrind</code> and Perl 5</a> </h2>
</p> <p>Nicholas Clark wondered what would happen, as in, how many bugs
would be uncovered, if one were to run the test suite under
<code>valgrind</code>. So Rafael Garcia-Suarez did just that, and discovered
that 41 test files produce errors.</p>
<p>Nicholas and Rafael then set about fixing up the problems that
were uncovered.</p>
<pre>
  There's always something to do
  <a href="http://xrl.us/k2yf">http://xrl.us/k2yf</a> </pre>
<p>
<h2> <a name="better_reporting_of_todo_tests">Better reporting of TODO tests</a> </h2>
</p> <p>Nicholas Clark looked at the unexpurgated version of the output
from the test suite and noticed that six tests were marked as
unexpectedly succeeding. In test parlance, these tests are called
TODO tests, since they show what there is to do. This state of
affairs is usually due to a test case that is expected to fail when
run, since it exercised a bug in perl that needed to be fixed, and at
some point, a source code change caused the failing test to succeed.</p>
<p>Nicholas saw that many of the really old regexp bugs that have been
fixed, had no TODO tests, and in any event, the default, summarised,
output of the test test suite makes no mention of them anyway, so
it is not as if anyone would have noticed the improvement.</p>
<p>So firstly, the test harness had to be upgraded to report the
summary of TODO tests that succeed, and (much more work) all the
open bugs need test cases written for them, so that it becomes
easier to see when they have been fixed.</p>
<p>Yves Orton hacked up his copy of <code>Test::Harness</code> to do this. Andy
Lester took the idea and applied it to his development version
of <code>Test::Harness</code> (see the "New Modules" section below).</p>
<p>Abe Timmerman updated the test smoke kit, in order to get all this
new goodness into the hands of the smokers.</p>
<pre>

<p>
<h2> <a name="coverity_coverage_of_cpan_modules">Coverity coverage of CPAN modules</a> </h2>
</p> <p>After having read the traffic on p5p concerning the errors that
Coverity uncovered, Alan Olsen what the possibilities were for
having the tests extended to cover CPAN modules with XS
components.</p>
<p>Johnathon Stowe realised that it was the output of <code>xsubpp</code>
that needs to be tested, rather than the <code>.xs</code> files themselves,
and wondered whether all the possible constructs it is possible
to have <code>xsubpp</code> emit ere in fact being covered, and whether
one ought to create a dummy XS module that simply causes
<code>xsubpp</code> to emit everything it knows how to.</p>
<p>Tim Jenness thought that that issue should be covered by
<code>XS::Typemap</code>. Johnathon did some quick coverage calculations
and was surprised to learn that it wasn't too shabby.</p>
<p>Andy Lester volunteered to liaise with the Coverity people to
have XS-based modules analysed, should the authors in question
care to know the results. Randy W. Sims was concerned that some
authors might think of it as a ratings system. Be that as it
may, a couple of authors asked for analysis to be applied to
their modules.</p>

<em>sv.c</em> and <em>dump.c</em>,</p>
<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/k2yi">http://xrl.us/k2yi</a> </pre>

<h2> <a name="212_warnings_emitted_by_gcc4_2">212 warnings emitted by gcc-4.2</a> </h2>
</p> <p>Marcus Holland-Moritz grew tired of watching an endless list of
warnings spew from compiling perl with a recent copy of <code>gcc</code>,
so he patched things to get rid of the problems that gave rise to
them.</p>
<p>Andy Lester was pleased to hear of the work, since it had been
something of an annoyance for him too. He asked for a slightly
less monolithic patch, so that different classes of errors
could be fixed a bit at a time. Rafael eventually applied all
the changes.</p>

</p> <p>Nicholas Clark looked at a NetBSD smoke report, and wondered what it
was that was being tested in <em>ext/B/t/bytecode.t</em> that was failing.
Whatever it was, he fixed it with change #27874.</p>

didn't care.</p>
