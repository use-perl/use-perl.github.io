<p><b>This week on the Perl 6 mailing lists</b>
<p>"Sadly, the hallucinogens are essential, not external."</p>

<p>-- Mark J. Reed in 'List assignment question'</p></p>
<p><p> <b>Language</b> </p>
<p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/4a025147aef30048/da90a413f143df82?#da90a413f143df82">how to change the type of objects</a> </i> </p>
<p>Last week, TSa asked how an object could change its type without loosing
its identity.  As an example, TSa suggested an <code>add_vertex</code> method which
could be called on a polygon but not on a rectangle subtype of polygon.
Darren Duncan wondered why one would declare a type as a rectangle and then
mutate it so that it was no longer a rectangle.  His opinion was that
<code>add_vertex</code> should be fatal for the rectangle; the user can explicitly
cast a rectangle into polygon first; or that the polygon class is immutable,
and the <code>add_vertex</code> method creates a new polygon.</p>

<p>This week TSa elaborated, stating that there were three issues: subtyping,
the preservation of object identity, and the mutating <code>add_vertex</code> method,
which were not all addressed by Darren's answer.</p>

<p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/a160cddce864768c/f9e98833df5535ad?#f9e98833df5535ad">generic ordinal-relevant operators</a> </i> </p>
<p>Darren Duncan showed a list of comparison operators and the type of
comparisons they perform.  Missing in the list were generic
ordinal-relevant operators for less-than, greater-than, and so on,
although there are numeric and string comparisons of this type.</p>

<p>Jonathan Lang replied that he doesn't see the need for distinct <code>eqv</code>,
<code>==</code> and <code>eq</code> operators; he would rather replace these with <code>==</code>,
'+==<code>, and '~==</code>, or even just <code>==</code> alone.  There was further discussion
on this proposal, with Darren preferring generics to be the shortest and
prefixes indicating the numeric or string casting versions.</p>

<p>Smylers requested that proposals for new operators should be accompanied
with an example of awkward code which could plausibly be written in a
natural setting, and a second example showing how the proposed operator
would correct the situation.  Larry Wall added the opinion that perfect
orthogonality is neither possible nor desirable.</p>

<p>However, <code>before</code> and <code>after</code> operators were accepted, as were min and
max operators.  This led to some further discussion on the syntax.</p>

<p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/7e6efee836e88865/9add249c44c13054?#9add249c44c13054">named sub-expressions, n-ary functions, things and stuff</a> </i> </p>
<p>Darren Duncan is designing an RDBMS which is a subset of Perl 6 with
simple syntax and domain-specific additions.  He gave an overview of the
features of the language.  This led to a few questions and suggestions
on Perl 6.  One was for something similar to the SQL (some dialects)
<code>with</code> clause, which is an expression which can be embedded in other
expressions, with repeated portions calculated only once.  Another
request was for a syntactical short-hand to add an immutable <code>bag</code>
type.  Thirdly, he suggested separate operators for integer and numeric
operators, especially division.  Next, there was a call for <code>floor()</code> and
<code>ceil()</code> functions which take a number as input and return an integer.
Finally, he proposed that built-in Perl 6 types all have multis for operators.</p>

<p>Mark J. Reed and Mark A. Biggar commented on the absence of 'undef' and
'NaN' concepts in the RDBMS language Darren described, which Darren replied
to.</p>

<p>Smylers replied to Darren's first point, suggesting that the <code>do</code> block
is similar.  Darren replied that it may be sufficient for his purposes,
and thanked Smylers for the suggestion.  Dr. Ruud added some more examples.</p>

<p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/37087a738034eaeb/2ea110ceefd486ef?#2ea110ceefd486ef">[svn:perl6-synopsis] r13475 - doc/trunk/design/syn</a> </i> </p>
<p>Larry Wall added missing generic boolean comparisons to S03.</p>

<p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/11c895cd7288631d/7d06bf8f8730cd3c?#7d06bf8f8730cd3c">List assignment question</a> </i> </p>
<p>Vincent Foley supplied some tests for the <code>*</code> operator, which is currently
not implemented in Pugs.  Larry Wall replied that perhaps <code>$</code> should be
used instead, as <code>*</code> is likely to be confused with the slurpy <code>*</code>.  He
offered a few suggestions on the tests as well.</p>

<p>There was a side discussion on when <code>my ($a, undef, $b) = 1..3;</code> worked
in Perl 5.</p>

<p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/bd6e492ac7ce0729/c03b9a1ad322e812?#c03b9a1ad322e812">Smart Matching clarification</a> </i> </p>
<p>Jonathan Lang brought up some information relating to hashes and was
wondering if the matching operator ought to be modified since the concept for
hash keys has since changed.  Larry Wall replied that <code>===</code> was correct,
but that the decisions on sorting may need to be rethought.  Jonathan
thought that not only was the current description suboptimal, it might
not even be possible.  Darren Duncan added in his opinion that .keys should return a Set.  Jonathan had some concerns about the idea.
Meanwhile, Paul Seamons made another suggestion based upon Template Toolkit's
handling of the concept.</p>

<p>Previously, there was a discussion on coding standards.  This week,
Chip Salzenberg joined in.  He thanked Kevin Tew for asking the questions
and gave his answers on what the standards should be.</p>

<p>Earlier, Patrick R. Michaud gave some background in to the issue, explaining
how Parrot currently handles compilers, and what PDD21 has to say
on the subject.  He was curious about how to conceptually model
compilers in Parrot.  He favored a compiler with an object which has
a <code>compile</code> method as a model.</p>

<p>This week, Patrick summarized a #parrotsketch meeting where it was decided
that the convention would be to have a <code>compreg</code> opcode return an object
with a <code>compile</code> method, instead of returning an invokable subroutine.
Allison Randal clarified a few points from the meeting.  </p>

<p>Leopold Toetsch recommended against recreating the <code>compile</code> opcode
as a means of making the <code>compile</code> method call.  Allison elaborated on
what was intended by the suggestion, and Leopold clarified his stance.</p>

what Perl does on Win32 to test sprintf.  SADAHIRO Tomoyuki answered
that it drops the superfluous zero from the return value.</p>

<p>Jerry Gay noted that he preferred a fix in Parrot_sprintf, rather than in
the related test.  He felt that Parrot should act in a consistent way
across platforms.  Allison Randal noted that the decision had been made
to go with a platform-independent implementation.</p>

that it would be good to look for them in Perl as well.
Chris Dolan replied that there is a policy available on CPAN which
would do this.</p>

that TODO items with tickets simply include 'RT' and the ticket number.

<p>Leopold Toetsch responded to the recommendation to deprecate property support
in PMCs.  Discussion ensued, with chromatic and Allison Randal participating.

He hoped for some feedback at an early point to prevent him from wasting
effort on useless patches.</p>

<p>He proposed extracting as much functionality as possible in to subroutines
which are then placed in a package.  He also wondered about some options
which were described in the documentation but didn't appear to be used.</p>
