<p>The December 2006 issue of UK magazine <a href="http://linuxformat.co.uk/"> <i>Linux Format</i> </a> has an interview with <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/gnat">Nat Torkington</a>.

<h2>I think Nat didn't get to proofread it...</h2>

&gt;<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... the Perl 5 'port this' list<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...<br><br>



<h2>Did TPF give up on Perl 5?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/sri/">sri</a> on 2006-11-05T19:27:02</h3>
Please correct me if i'm wrong but isn't TPF supposed to promote Perl?<br><br/><br/>Naturally everybody is free to think whatever they want, but when talking as a TPF representative which Nat clearly did, i think some of his statements are a bit inadequate.<br> <br><br/><br/>I don't want to post quotes out of context so i just highlight some parts.<br> <br><br/><br/><small> <cite>
Linux Format: Could you tell me what your role is at the Perl foundation?<br><br/><br/>Nat Torkington: <b>I am on the board at the Perl foundation</b>; we oversee the activities that the executive director sets up. We advise and connect with the appropriate people where necessary.<br> <br><br/><br/>LXF Do you get the chance to do much hacking?<br><br/><br/>NT I didn't used to. My job at O'Reilly would keep me very very busy, but this year I've started carving out more and more time to get back in. <b>So I taught myself Ruby, and I'm loving that.</b> I'm working my way through programming contest puzzles - some of them are arithmetic, some are graphs, some of them are pictorial, so it's just fun. <b>Having fun with code again.</b> <br> <br><br/><br/>LXF So despite learning Ruby these are things that you'd still prefer to do with Perl?<br><br/><br/>NT <b>Well, these are tools I wrote a while ago</b>, but yes, I'd still prefer to do that using Perl. <b>If I had to do it all over again, it would depend on whether I was doing in for speed or for fun. It would take me longer to learn how to do it in Ruby - there are things in there like CGI scripts that I haven't played with yet. Whereas I'm perfectly comfortable with that in Perl.</b> <br> <br><br/><br/>LXF: How close are we to a release of <b>Perl 6</b>?<br><br/><br/>NT: <b>I think the joke for a while was that it would be Christmas. We're just not going to tell you which Christmas.</b> <br> <br><br/><br/>LXF: Does there need to be a release?<br><br/><br/>NT: So you're thinking of it as some sort of aspirational ideal - <b>if we never release Perl 6 we'll just get people continuing to build it.</b></cite> </small> <br> <br><br/><br/>So Perl5 is nearly dead but still ok for CGIs when you don't have the time to learn Ruby.
And since Perl6 will never happen anyway...<br> <br><br/><br/>I don't expect everybody to be a marketing genius, but to me this sadly looks like a very good <b>Ruby ad</b>.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:(

<p>Shouldn't Nat have the opportunity to talk about other things he's doing, such as working on OSCON?</p>

Absolutely, but the interview still looks like a Ruby ad to me.

Why is that a bad thing? Ruby is a nice language.

<p>If you state "I am on the board of The Perl Foundation and then you go on to give an ad for Ruby, I think that is bad.</p>

<p>It doesn't matter if Ruby is good or bad.</p>



<h2>Re:Did TPF give up on Perl 5?</h2>

Ruby is a very nice language indeed, i'm now considering it for my next project too.<br> <br>
But the point is that Nat was talking as a member of the Perl Foundation, not the Ruby Fountation.<br>
And these kind of statements stab people in the back that still try (or tried) to promote Perl as a general purpose language,<br>
especially for modern non-cgi web programming.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:(

<p>That might surprise both Nat and the interviewer.</p>

<p>I write a fair bit of C code sometimes.  I'm not and never have been a member of the Perl Foundation, but if I were, would you object to me mentioning that I write C?  In the past few years, I've also written code in shell, C++, Java, Haskell, JavaScript, Python, Scheme, Visual Basic, T/SQL or something like it, SQL, Parrot Assembly, PPC assembly, and, yes, Ruby.</p>

<p>If someone were to interview me, and the first question mentioned Perl, would you object if I mentioned other languages in subsequent questions?</p>

I agree. I was a little dissapointed the "I use Perl, but not when I have a choice" attitude...<br>
