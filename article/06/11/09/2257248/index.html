<h2> <a name="new_version_diagnostic_breaks_a_bunch_of_modules">New version diagnostic breaks a bunch of modules</a> </h2>
<p>The discussion of trapping error messages, and future-proofing the code
that traps error messages continued on its merry way this week, with lots
of attempts and trying to figure out what the code would look like from
the client side. If that was sorted out, the implementation would be
trivial. The biggest issue was minimising the amount of makework code
required on the client side, otherwise people will never remember the
incantation and will get it wrong and/or waste time.</p>
<p>I would say Glenn Linderman made the best proposal, way down at the
end of the thread, with his <code>errorcodes</code> module. But then I'm not
sure I'm qualified to judge, since <em>my</em> code never has errors.</p>

<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/s5fp">http://xrl.us/s5fp</a> </pre>

<h2> <a name="can_t_compile_blead_on_suse_10_1__x64_64_">Can't compile blead on SuSE 10.1 (x64_64)</a> </h2>
<p>Andy Dougherty and Cosimo Streppone waded through the difficulty
of getting Perl compiled on a 64-bit SuSE linux host. But by the
end of the fortnight, Tels, who raised the original problem was
still not getting complete satisfaction.</p>

<h2> <a name="patches_for_duallived_modules">Patches for dual-lived modules</a> </h2>
<p>Jerry D. Hedden wanted to know if patches could be forwarded to
him first, instead of <code>blead</code>, as it would result in fewer
patches all round. There was some reluctance, since there are many
cases where the putative maintainer is busy with Other Things in
Real Life and are not always as responsive as Jerry. Thus, people
like to be able to make changes to the codebase and worry about
CPAN catching up afterwards.</p>
<p>In terms of the <code>threads</code> module, Dave Mitchell stated that he
still considered the core as being the primary &quot;home&quot; of the
source, the CPAN modules just being a way for people to get new

<code>thread</code> goodness now, without having to wait for 5.10.</p>

<h2> <a name="configure_patch_for_5__d_d__d_"> <em>Configure</em> patch for <code>5.\d\d.\d+</code> </a> </h2>
<p>Andy Dougherty thanks H.Merijn Brand for taking the time to prepare
this patch. H.Merijn pointed out that it was unlikely to be exercised
by the current test infrastructure, and if people cared about older
perls they would have to pay special attention.</p>

<p>
<h2> <a name="a_call_for_file__spec_cwd_maintainers">A call for <code>File::Spec</code>/<code>Cwd</code> maintainers</a> </h2>
<p>Ken Williams announced that his copious spare time is no longer
sufficient to devote the time required to keep these two modules
happy and bug free, and asked for volunteers interested in becoming
co-maintainers.</p>
<p>Johan Vromans kicked off the idea of a small working group with
access to a wide variety of platforms and perls to sit down and and
figure out how to cross-platform file-system manipulations the Right
Way. Ken Williams thought that <code>Path::Class</code> was the right way,
but admitted to being slightly biased, since he wrote it.</p>

<p>
<h2> <a name="profiling_and_dprofpp">Profiling and <code>dprofpp</code> </a> </h2>
<p>Nicholas Clark bemoaned <code>dprofpp</code>'s sluggishness at processing a 150MB
<em>tmon.out</em> file, and wondered whether anyone who had said that they
would take a look at the problem had ever made any headway. He
wondered if the suggestion to rewrite it in terms of Simon Cozens's
<code>Devel::DProfPP</code> module was feasible. For starters, he wasn't sure
of how to go about setting up regression tests.</p>

<p>
<h2> <a name="data__bind_compilation_failure_with_blead"> <code>Data::Bind</code> compilation failure with blead</a> </h2>
<p>This failure was caused by the fact that <code>warnings.pm</code> no longer loads
<code>Carp</code> at compile time, only if needed, and this masked what was, strictly
speaking, a syntax error in <code>Data::Bind</code>.</p>

<p>If the change that gave rise to this were to be backported to
<code>maint</code>, a number of CPAN modules would break, which would mean
that 5.8.9 would not be a drop-in replacement for the 5.8.x series. Yves
wondered whether it was sufficient to flag it as an important <code>main</code> upgrade
issue, and document a work-around.</p>

<h2> <a name="closures_with_named_subs">Closures with named subs</a> </h2>
<p>Christian Winter was puzzled by how closures behave when the closed-over
routine is named, and the documentation didn't help him understand what
was happening.</p>

<p>After it was explained to him, he cooked up a patch for <code>perlref.pod</code>,
which Rafa&#235;l Garcia-Suarez applied.</p>

<p>
<h2> <a name="valgrind_findings">Valgrind findings</a> </h2>
<p>Rafa&#235;l ran <code>valgrind</code> over blead, and noted that the memory was
leaking like a sieve. Nicholas made a couple of suggestions on leaks
that may be caused by optrees being half-destructed. Yves cleaned up
the leaks from the regular expression engine.</p>

<p>Rafa&#235;l ran a second round, and 14 previous test files came up clean.</p>
<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/s5fy">http://xrl.us/s5fy</a> </pre>
<p>He found two leaks with <code>warnings.pm</code>. One, he fixed, the other, he
did not know how to proceed.</p>

<p>
<h2> <a name="perl_source_code_protection_and_the_demise_of_b__bytecode">Perl source code protection and the demise of <code>B::Bytecode</code> </a> </h2>

<p>Nicholas Clark received out-of-band feedback on the announcement that
<code>B::Bytecode</code> has been dropped for 5.10. Turns out there are people
out there who are using it to deliver shrouded Perl code.</p>
<p>Nicholas pointed out that it was dropped because no-one who cared
sufficiently about the matter had neither the time nor inclination
to look after it. If someone starts to maintain it again then it's
another story. In the meantime, he wondered what other solutions
were available to &quot;protect&quot; Perl source code.</p>
<p>Steve Hay's <code>Filter::Crypto</code> probably comes the closest these days.
Nicholas, imitating Bruce Schneier, noted that &quot;As the attacker,
you only have to find the weakest link. As the defender, you have
to ensure that no leaks are weak. The defender can only delay the
inevitable.&quot;</p>
<p>Adam Kennedy thought that munging the code through <code>Perl::Squish</code>

and then possibly creating random xyzzy variable names would go
a long way to making the code sufficiently difficult to understand.
You could also check that the test suite still succeeds after
shrouding.</p>
<p>Andy Dougherty mentioned that it might be worthwhile hanging out
a sign in the usual places saying &quot;Orphaned modules! The following
modules will be removed from 5.10 unless someone offers to maintain
them&quot;. Not that he expects anyone to reply, but at least that way
we don't have to feel guilty about it.</p>
<p>Scott Walters admitted to liking Logo and SNOBOL, and that it might
be fun some day to revive the Bytecode material in order to allow
those languages to emit Perl bytecodes, which could then run Perl
(and access CPAN). Some day.</p>

<h2> <a name="utf8_failures_in_smoke___perl_unicode_">UTF-8 Failures in smoke (<code>$PERL_UNICODE</code>)</a> </h2>
<p>An old bug from several months ago raised its head again. With the
restructuring of some part of the internals, we achieved the possibility
of have two right answers to a test, and Nicholas Clark couldn't find
an easy way to hack the test suite to cope with the fact that (to
paraphrase) <code>foo()</code> could return &quot;bar&quot; or &quot;rat&quot;, and either would be
okay. He was then thoroughly swamped by hordes of volunteers beating
a path to his Inbox offering to help out. (I am being sarcastic).</p>
<p>The problem surfaced again, this time managing to snag Dave Mitchell's
attention (who lamented that his p5p spool currently stands at over
4000 messages), and so he missed it the first time around. (And what
are my summaries? Chopped liver?)</p>

<p>As the warnings code was mainly Dave's handiwork, he was able to craft
a fix to improve the situation.</p>

<p>
<h2> <a name="unclear_version_error_message">Unclear version error message</a> </h2>
<p>Glenn Linderman was playing around with PAR, and didn't realise that
WordPerfect Mail had discretely slipped a <em>perl58.dll</em> into
<em>c:\windows\system</em> when he wasn't looking. So the PAR stuff spat
out a strange message about a version of Perl he didn't have, and
it took him a certain amount of time to figure out why things were
misbehaving.</p>

<p>To cut a long story short, it would have helped if canonical file
names appeared somewhere in the error message.  The fact that Glenn
had been using PAR meant that <code>$^X</code> and <code>$0</code> didn't point anywhere
near the library.</p>
<p>Yves pondered whether it would make more sense for Perl to use a little
more of the Windows infrastructure, and stashing version information of
installed modules into the registry. Andy Dougherty wasn't too sure
about this, feeling that this was more of a vendor issue than one for
the porters.</p>
<p>Vadim Konovalov pointed out that the registry was not a good idea for
a number of reasons. A big problem is that locked-down business
installations may not even let the user account write to the registry.</p>
<p>Glenn thought the whole registry business was annoying, because if
you copy an application from an old machine to a new one, it doesn't
work, because of all the missing registry entries. At this stage,
the thread started to discuss the finer aspects of how to get multiple
Perl installations playing nicely on the same machine, and strategies
for deal with moving the Perl directory around and still have it work.</p>

<p>Alexey Tourbin had a problem with FindBin getting mixed up with

<p>Yves Orton discovered a flaw in his previous work on adding jump
tries (<code>/(foo[ab]|bar[cd])/</code> worked, but <code>/(foo[ab]|bar[cd])+/</code>

did not). In the process of fixing it, he invented a new regop
FAIL, which deals with things in a more elegant manner. And some
tests, too.</p>
<p>This lets you specify deep in the middle of a pattern that, no
you really don't want to match anything at all. Sometimes, this
comes in handy.</p>

<h2> <a name="supporting__threads__with_multiple_embedded_perls">Supporting 'threads' with multiple embedded Perls</a> </h2>
<p>Jerry D. Hedden landed a patch to allow multiple Perl interpreters

Jan Dubois.</p>
<pre>
  the big issue
  <a href="http://xrl.us/s5gd">http://xrl.us/s5gd</a> </pre>

<p>Jan had a look at the code and made a couple of suggestions on
how to improve it.</p>

<p>
<h2> <a name="add_a_few_useful_developers_maketargets_to_win32_makefile">Add a few useful developers maketargets to win32/Makefile</a> </h2>
<p>Yves Orton tweaked the Win32 <em>Makefile</em> to add a couple of targets,
<code>regnodes</code>, which comes in handy when hacking on the regular
expression engine (one can see what itch this scratches) and
<code>regen</code> which does the whole lot. Making only <code>regnotes</code> avoids
a considerable amount of useless recompilations.</p>

<pre>

<p>
<h2> <a name="add_a_commit_verb_to_regex_engine_to_allow_fine_tuning_of_backtracking_control">Add a commit verb to regex engine to allow fine tuning of backtracking control</a> </h2>
<p>Joshua ben Jore appears to understand some of the more esoteric
improvements that Yves has been making in the regular expression
engine. He asked how <code>(?COMMIT)</code> behaves in terms of <code>(?&gt;...)</code>
and was most impressed with the answers Yves gave. Since I've never
taken the time to understand the usefulness of <code>(?&gt;...)</code> in the
first place, it all went slightly over my head.</p>

He made one final tweak.</p>
<pre>

  <a href="http://xrl.us/s5gh">http://xrl.us/s5gh</a> </pre>

<h2> <a name="monitoring_wedged_tests_on_win32">Monitoring wedged tests on Win32</a> </h2>
<p>Steve Hway was having problems with his smoke machine. Sometimes
a test will hang, and the test run is ruined. It used to be worse,
but it's still not perfect.</p>
<pre>

  <a href="http://xrl.us/s5gm">http://xrl.us/s5gm</a> </pre>
<p>So a method is needed to monitor the tests, and detect when they
get wedged. And, more importantly, killing them when they <em>do</em> get
wedged. Jerry D. Hedden offered a patch for <em>t/TEST</em> that sets up
a monitor thread to keep an eye out for tests that get stuck (and
thus completely ruin a smoker's evening).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it didn't work out as expected, since it appeared
that when things go wrong and the monitor thread tries to kill
the blocked thread, it is the parent of the blocked thread that
winds up taking the bullet.</p>
<p>Jan Dubois said that a robust solution to this would be to use
<code>Win32::Job</code>, a module that ActiveState wrote to help keep work
with building ppm distributions, and not having one bad package
in the batch blocking the show. But alas, <code>Win32::Job</code> is not
in the core.</p>

<p>Nicholas Clark did not see this as an obstacle. If the module was
needed, in order to test core modules, then there was no reason
it should not become core.</p>
<p>Another thing Jan wanted to do was to emulate Unix's <code>kill -9, $pid</code>,
to take out a whole process group in one fell swoop. He was
strongly encouraged to proceed with this.</p>

<p> <code>sprintf &quot;%#04X&quot;</code> also uppercases the 0x-prefix (#40583)</p>
<p>Dr. Ruud noticed that, for instance, <code>sprintf &quot;%#04x&quot;, 15</code> produces the
slightly odd looking <code>0X0F</code>, and contended that it should produce <code>0x0F</code>,
as per the C spec, or the Perl documentation, or something.</p>

<p>This kicked off a large thread where it was noted that Perl lets
<code>sprintf</code> produce binary <code>0b001011</code> strings, but not <code>0B001011</code>,
that perl doesn't know how to <code>eval &quot;0X0F&quot;</code> and a few other things
besides. By the end of the thread, <code>blead</code> had been patched in
various different ways, tests added and documentation amended, in an
attempt clean up most of the glaring inconsistencies.</p>

<p>Schmorp (possibly Marc Lehmann in disguise) found that when perl
runs out of memory, it needs to allocate memory in order to print
the error message. But it runs out of memory, so it has to allocate
some memory to... you get the picture. And Schmorp gets a segfault.</p>

<h2> <a name="gnu_linux__glibc__likely_needs_use_perl_sbrk___40603_"> <code>gnu/linux</code> (glibc) likely needs <code>USE_PERL_SBRK</code> (#40603)</a> </h2>
<p>Marc Lehmann found that bad things happen when one uses modules
that use pthreads with a perl built to use its internal <code>malloc</code>
(via <code>usemymalloc=y</code>). It seems that both <code>glibc</code> and perl's
<code>malloc</code>s wind up allocating overlapping areas, with predictably
hilarious results.</p>

<p>It turns out that both perl and glibc call <code>sbrk</code> to acquire more
memory, but <code>sbrk</code> is not thread-safe, so concurrent calls all get
the same result.</p>
<p>Andy Dougherty wondered whether the hints for linux/glibc should
prevent <code>usemymalloc=y</code> from being chosen, or whether <code>usemymalloc=y</code>
provides such benefits that it may be worth spending some effort
to get everything playing nicely.</p>
<p>Nicholas Clark remembered that people have been having trouble with
threads on FreeBSD, and that it may well be for this very same
reason, and <code>usemymalloc=y</code> is definitely worthwhile on that
platform.</p>

<h1> <a name="in_brief">In Brief</a> </h1>
<p>Andrew Savige wrote a new <strong>test for close-on-exec (<code>$^F</code>)</strong> in

<em>t/run/cloexec.t</em>, as <strong>there were no tests</strong> for it. Since the
test used a magic number, Steve Peters thought that it should
be hidden behind a preprocessor macro in <code>perl.h</code>.</p>
<pre>
  This test brought to you by the number 3 and the letter F

<p>The problems surrounding <strong>change #29050, a memory leak fix by Jarkko</strong>
were all sorted out. There was still a problem with <code>glob</code> and <code>threads</code>

on VMS that Craig A. Berry needed to look at.</p>
<pre>
  done and dusted
  <a href="http://xrl.us/s5hc">http://xrl.us/s5hc</a> </pre>
<p>Craig reported that this was due to <strong>asymmetry in reference counting in <code>PerlIO_tmpfile</code> </strong>.</p>

<p>Vadim Konovalov wanted to know <strong>why DynaLoader's <em>dl_win32.xs</em>

everything else.</p>

Too much data! Can't absorb it all! Hehe. Seriously, the summary is very informative. Especially for those not able to visit everyday. Like me. But it is very useful and practical. Thanks!
