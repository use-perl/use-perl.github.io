<li>How long you&#8217;d like, to keep this simple please choose either 5 minutes (a lightning talk &#8211; always popular!), 25 minutes or 55 minutes.</li> </ul>
To, <a href="mailto:lpw-2006-talks@london.pm.org">lpw-2006-talks@london.pm.org </a> <br> <br>The deadline for submissions is Monday 20 November 2006, and we'll let you know if the talk has been accepted in under a week. However please if you can submit sooner, it would be appreciated.<br> <br>Lastly, if you feel like helping out on the day with any of the many odd jobs that need going please also email <a href="mailto:lpw-2006-talks@london.pm.org">lpw-2006-talks@london.pm.org</a>, to volunteer.<br> <br>Thanks for reading and we hope to see lots of you there,<br> <br>The LPW 2006 Organisers.</p>
