<h2> <a name="inc_handlers_and___file__">INC handlers and <code>__FILE__</code> </a> </h2>
<p>(I didn't get around to summarising this thread last week).</p>
<p>Ron Isaacson had reported that he used code references in <code>@INC</code>, to
great effect, but regretted that the modules loaded no longer really
knew where they came from, <code>__FILE__</code> and related things would
refer to the module loader module, rather than their own paths.</p>

<p>Rafa&#233;l Garcia-Suarez concocted a quick fix in <em>pp_ctl.c</em> for <code>blead</code>,
which improves the situation considerably. Glenn Linderman wondered if
a cheap and nasty hack, a <code>#line</code> directive at the top of each file,
could do as a temporary work-around.</p>
<p>Nicholas Clark suggested Ron take a look at an Acme module of his,
that might do more or less what he needed (see, sometimes Acme modules
<em>are</em> useful).</p>

<p>The new <em>t/run/cloexec.t</em> test blew a bit of smoke out the O-rings.
It could mean that this is testing the operating system, rather
than perl, in which case it might wind up being removed. Andrew
Savige, father of the original patch, tried to teach it some manners.</p>

<h2> <a name="building_perl_with_vc___2005__vc8_">Building perl with VC++ 2005 (VC8)</a> </h2>
<p>Steve Hay, Steve Peters and Jan Dubois continued to work this week
on getting Visual C++ from Microsoft to compile the perl source, and
had lots of fun, or not, playing around with I/O, DLLs and the C
runtime library. By the end of the week all appeared to have been
straightened out.</p>
<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/taru">http://xrl.us/taru</a> </pre>
<p>Later on in the week, Steve Hay started having problems with test
failures on a VC8 build. These were apparently due to problems in
interacting with (or rather, finding) the C runtime library.</p>
<p>After a bit of a discussion Steve was moving in the right direction.</p>

<h2> <a name="installing_perl_shouldn_t_feel_like_a_rite_of_passage">Installing Perl shouldn't feel like a rite of passage</a> </h2>
<p>Michael G. Schwern felt that the Configure process was a bit too verbose,
asked to many questions, and sometimes gave some very scary replies. He
felt that it would be a good idea to be able to reduce the verbosity
level. Some way down in the thread, he showed the README from Ruby,
which, it must be said, is short, sharp, and to the point.</p>
<p>Andy Dougherty noted that the <em>INSTALL</em> file had amassed considerable
cruft over the years, due to various stupid bug reports that had
wasted considerable time of those doing front-line support at the time.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, as Michael pointed out, the perl install process is
geared to catering for people with weird system setups, are in the
business of packaging Perl for distributions or are using it on
non-mainstream systems. The README and the Configure step reflect
this: it's hard to know what's important, and what's noise.</p>
<p>H.Merijn Brand felt that it might be worthwhile to put more emphasis
on <em>Policy.sh</em>, the idea being that if you've sweated out a
configuration trial-by-fire once, you can at least save that file
away in a safe place, and reuse it next time you build a perl.</p>

<p>At the end of a fairly long, but always interesting thread (lots
of good stuff from chromatic), Jarkko Hietaniemi injected a dose
of reality into the discussion, pointing out that <code>Configure</code> is
not going to be redesigned any time soon, it's hard to produce an
interface to it that makes end-user programmers and system
administrators happy, and so yes, to a certain extent it *will*
be difficult to avoid building perl from being a rite of passage.</p>

<p>Andy Dougherty produced an initial tweak to <em>Configure</em> to tone down
the <strong>*** WHOA THERE!!! ***</strong> messages to something a bit more laid back.</p>

<p>Jesse Vincent updated <em>README</em> to make it a little friendlier, and feared
that the resulting discussion would evolve into a discussion of the
colour of the bikeshed. Rafa&#235;l JFDI'ed the patch.</p>
<p>There were a number of useful suggestions made, and Michael reported back
that the target guinea pig for installing Perl liked the new version.</p>

<h2> <a name="failures_while_attempting_to_install_plagger_with_bleadperl">Failures while attempting to install <code>Plagger</code> with bleadperl</a> </h2>
<p>Steve Peters was delighted to discover that Plagger has even more
CPAN dependencies than Catalyst or Jifty. Therefore, installing that one
module causes a large slab of CPAN to be pulled down and tested, which is
just the ticket when you're taking <code>blead</code> for a spin.</p>
<p>Alas, twenty eight modules failed their test suite, and three more
failed to build altogether.</p>
<pre>
  Uh, could you run prove -vb on that, please?

<h2> <a name="taking_a_look_at_the_os_x_hintfile_for_10_4">Taking a look at the OS X hintfile for 10.4</a> </h2>
<p>Michael G. Schwern also thought that the hintfile for OS/X was rather
dusty, especially in terms of the 10.4 release, and thought that a touch
of spring cleaning was in order.</p>
<p>Andy Dougherty, Dominic Dunlop, Bo Lindbergh and Edward Moy had a look
at the issues, and it appears that the main ones are locales and
<code>poll()</code>. Considerable head scratching and archive diving was
observed, and Andy hoped that the patch file would be commented with
pointers to this and other discussions, so that when the problem is
revisited, say, in 2011, it will be easy to zoom in on the previous
debate.</p>

<h2> <a name="warnings_from_pod_t_man_t_in_blead">Warnings from <em>Pod/t/man.t</em> in blead</a> </h2>
<p>It seems that <code>Pod::Man</code> is also falling foul of the new
<code>Variable length character upgraded in print</code> diagnostic. Rafa&#235;l fixed
the problem in <code>blead</code>, but Russ Allbery noted that it wouldn't work for
<code>maint</code>, as it uses modern <code>blead</code>ing features. He suggested a
possible <code>maint</code>-compatible technique, and wanted to know if it would
fly.</p>

<p>As proposed, the technique caused the tests on <code>blead</code> to fail, but
Rafa&#235;l produced a variant that should work on both codebases. It did
lead him to doubt whether the warning was actually useful in general.</p>

<h2> <a name="chatting_about_sort_sanity_checking">Chatting about sort sanity checking</a> </h2>
<p>David Nicol began to see how easy it would be to add warnings to
catch custom sort comparison functions that don't fulfill the contract
of what such a function is supposed to do (return a negative or
positive value, or zero). The low-hanging fruit would be to check for
<code>&lt;</code>, <code>&gt;</code> operators and the like.</p>

<p>John P. Linderman thought this would be a good idea, but found it
difficult to reconcile with the constraint that there should be no
runtime penalty.</p>
<pre>

<h2> <a name="mro__sub_generation_and_so_on">MRO, sub_generation and so on</a> </h2>
<p>Brandon Black wrote <code>Class::C3</code>, which provides an alternate technique
for method lookups, and he had come to the conclusion that for best
results, it needed to be more tightly integrated into the core (or
rather, the core needed to expose some aspects to the outside, that
his module could tap into).</p>
<p>Specifically, he had problems with the fact that a single change
somewhere can blow away the entire method name cache. What would be
nice would be to a way to blow away the methods on a per-package
basis, as it would less the cost of method cache invalidations.</p>

<p>Hugo van der Sanden was extremely interested in the approach, since
he has lots of code that creates methods on the fly, and this
winds up continually trashing the cache. Joshua ben Jore thought
that <code>Moose</code> and <code>Class::Trait</code> would benefit from the concept.</p>
<p>Nicholas Clark was somewhat sceptical, wondering how often people
run around adding new methods to code (once it's up and running,
after some preliminary initialisation phase). Be that as it may,
he wasn't particularly familiar with that part of the codebase,
and suggested looking through the lens of <code>perlbrowse</code>, to find
out <em>who</em> has been working on that code in the recent past.</p>
<p>He did just that, and discovered that most of the code dates back
to beginning of the revision history, and thus the details are
literally lost in the mists of time. After taking another, closer
look, Nicholas was able to give Brandon some reasonable directions
on how to proceed.</p>

<p>Shlomi Fish found a problem with the debugger, that only showed up
in non-threaded 5.8.8 builds. After poring over the changes in
<code>perlbrowse</code>, he was able to pin-point the likely culprits. Once
this legwork was done, it was a small matter for Rafa&#235;l to come
up with a fix.</p>
<p>Shlomi was most impressed, and asked if Rafa&#235;l had come up with
a test, to ensure that the bug didn't come back again. Rafa&#235;l
admitted to not being sure how to go about that, and Shlomi said
that he had an idea for one. So he produced a stand-alone test
that did the deed, and again it was a small matter for Rafa&#235;l
to recast it in terms of a test for the test suite.</p>

<p>Andreas K&#246;nig discovered that a recent change to optimise
lazy copying in <code>sv_setsv()</code> caused <code>Term::ReadLine::Gnu</code> to
go belly up. Nicholas Clark rejigged the patch to restore the
old behaviour to callers outside the core, but Andreas still
wasn't getting satisfaction.</p>

<h2> <a name="new_regexp_syntax_omnibus">New regexp syntax omnibus</a> </h2>
<p>Yves has been speaking with Larry Wall about the work on the regular
expression engine. Since all the new <code>(?..)</code> verbs do something quite
different to the older zero-width assertions, it makes sense to make
them look different. So now they are introduced by <code>(*...)</code>. (Makes
me glad I haven't been writing code that uses them).</p>

<p>Anyway, the plot is beginning to be revealed at last. Yves wants to
build Perl 6 rules on Perl 5. This is going to be interesting.</p>
<p>Additional changes followed, and all of it wound up being landed in
<code>blead</code>.</p>
<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/tar9">http://xrl.us/tar9</a> </pre>
<p>Joshua ben Jore was having trouble keeping Yves Orton's new regular
expression control verbs straight, since he kept getting mixed up
with Prolog. He also had trouble keeping up with the current thread
dealing with these matters, since he replied to a previous thread
on the subject. He thought that ERROR should become CUT, and CUT
become something else. Either that, or use whatever Perl 6 uses.</p>

<h2> <a name="static_linkage_for_perl_exe_for_win32">Static linkage for <code>perl.exe</code> for win32</a> </h2>
<p>Vadim Konovalov added a new target and few small tweaks to the Win32
<em>Makefile</em>, to allow a static <em>perl.exe</em> to be built (no more
<em>perl.dll</em>s). Steve Hay suggested better names for the resulting
executable.</p>

<h2> <a name="make_sprintf_reject_tainted_formats">Make <code>s?printf</code> reject tainted formats</a> </h2>

<p>A few months ago, the idea was put forward that <code>printf</code>y format
strings should be subject to taint checks. Rafa&#235;l wrote the code to
implement this, and then stood back to see what people thought of
the concept. Dave Mitchell warmed to the concept and Johnathon
Stowe suggested that <code>strftime</code> ought to receive similar treatment.</p>
<p>Rafa&#233;l couldn't see how to abuse <code>strftime</code> effectively, so
that was left alone, but the code for the <code>printf</code> family went in.</p>

<h2> <a name="perl_die_____perl_croak__"> <code>Perl_die()</code> / <code>Perl_croak()</code> </a> </h2>
<p>Philip M. Gollucci finally scratched his itch and fixed up the <code>printf</code>
compiler attribute checks, by disabling them. This allows modperl 2 to
be built under <code>blead</code> again.</p>
<p>Robin Barker was under the impression that it is distressingly easy
to break modperl when working with <code>blead</code>, and wondered if there was
some way of capturing in core tests the assumptions that modperl relies
upon.</p>

<h2> <a name="make_if___hash_____act_the_same_as_if__keys__hash____">Make <code>if (%hash) {}</code> act the same as <code>if (keys %hash) {}</code> </a> </h2>
<p>Yves Orton noticed that, while semantically equivalent, testing for
<code>%hash</code> or <code>keys %hash</code> to see if a hash contains something do
not run at the same speed. He patched the core to make the former
become about as fast as the latter.</p>

<p>Rick Delaney reminded Yves to watch out for tied hashes, in case
his patch changed existing behaviour. Worse, using <code>if (%hash)</code>
now resets the iterator, which was more or less the final nail in
the coffin for the idea.</p>
<p>Yves then took a different approach, and created a new opcode
<code>boolkeys</code> to be used in this <code>if (%hash)</code> context, made it do
the right thing in the face of tied hashes, and as a result made
it even faster than using <code>if (keys %hash)</code>.</p>

<p>Back in July, Benjamin Holzman supplied a patch to fix up the mess when
playing around with <code>tzset</code> and the <code>TZ</code> environment variable.
H.Merijn Brand dusted it off and applied it to blead as change
#29209.</p>

<p>Yves Orton wondered whether it was good for Windows, since it caused
a number of tests to fail. Furthermore, it was unlikely to work in
any event, since recent overhauls to the environment variable
handling on Windows has decoupled the changing of environment
variables within Perl space from affecting the underlying C runtime
library's notion of the environment.</p>
<p>Sadahiro Tomoyuki suggested that the safest course of action was to
leave the code, and skip the tests on Windows, and supplied a patch
to do just that.</p>

<p>Yves then responded to a February 2004 bug filed by zefram, who didn't
like the behaviour of <code>^</code> in a certain context. He thought that while
it could be construed as a bug, it has since managed to become
sufficiently widespread to have evolved into a feature. While fixing it
would be theoretically good, it would cause a lot of existing code to
fail, starting with important pieces of the  <code>Test::</code> namespace itself.</p>

<p>This made Steve Peters ponder the idea of adding a &quot;Won't fix&quot; bug
status, which would allow bugs like this to be no longer counted towards
the open bugs total. Steve thought that a number of auto-vivification
feature-bugs could go this way as well.</p>
