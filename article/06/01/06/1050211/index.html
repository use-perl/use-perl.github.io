<p>A happy new year for Perl 5 porters and everybody.
The holiday seemed to bring a lot of spare time for Perl 5 porters
and they made good use of it. Hey, what those funny people are
doing around in this mailing list?</p>
<p><h2> <a name="perl_on_z_os">Perl on z/OS</a> </h2>
<p>In the last weeks, Rajarshi Das and others raised some interest for
the Perl port to z/OS, an EBCDIC platform, and started
some threads on related issues.</p>
<p> <strong> <strong>iso-2022-jp</strong> encoding </strong>
Rajarshi Das asked for help to understand why <strong>iso-2022-jp</strong> encoding
is unknown on z/OS. Sadahiro Tomoyuki showed some
evidence that <code>Encode</code> is not ready to support <code>Encode::JP</code>
(the module which supports <strong>iso-2002-jp</strong> and other Japanese
encodings) on EBCDIC. Nick Ing-Simmons also had some comments
about the weirdness of scripts starting with an EBCDIC dialect
and then switching to an ASCII-oid escape encoding like <strong>iso-2002-jp</strong>
is. Rajarshi Das tried some changes against <code>Encode</code> sources
and his doubts remained. Sadahiro Tomoyuki tried to help Rajarshi
understand the involved subtleties. This thread has not
reached a conclusion (unless I missed something)
and Rajarshi opened ticket #16663.</p>
<pre>
    <a href="http://xrl.us/jgcu">http://xrl.us/jgcu</a> </pre>
<p> <strong>Configuration Error for p59x26223</strong>
Rajarshi was having fun configuring and building p59x26223 (whatever that is)
on z/OS v1.7,
but some show-stopping errors were popping and he called for help.
Jarkko Hietaniemi analyzed the situation which is due to a silly warning
of a compiler who wants to know too much. Jarkko posted
something to Rajarshi to try, which worked,
until it hit an error in building <code>Compress::Zlib</code>.
Paul Marquess wondered about a fix of a couple of weeks ago, which
then made possible to Rajarshi to build Perl. (This fix is going to
be officially introduced to <code>Compress::Zlib</code>.)
Jarkko asked for more details on a failure around <code>Time::HiRes</code>,
which went unanswered.</p>
<pre>
    <a href="http://xrl.us/jgcv">http://xrl.us/jgcv</a> </pre>
<p> <strong> Fixing <em>t/uni/class.t</em> on EBCDIC </strong>
Rajarshi Das brought a patch to <em>t/uni/class.t</em> on perl-5.8.7
which fixes the test on EBCDIC (z/OS 1.4).
The test case changes worked fine with Sadahiro Tomoyuki's patch for <em>utf8.c</em>
but, to Steve Peters, they seemed too heavy for a test.
Sadahiro Tomoyuki followed up with a lighter change,
untried yet on EBCDIC, until Rajarshi tried it successfully,
but he had a few comments on why things were done that way in
the first patch. Last week, Steve Peters pinged about what changes
were needed and the current state of tests outcome.</p>
<pre>

<p> <strong> <code>Expect</code>, Anyone? </strong>
Robert Zielazinski wondered if someone had played with porting
the <code>Expect</code> module to z/OS. He tried once with no luck on
previous releases. No one answered, maybe because <code>Expect</code>,
which is not a core module, and z/OS are not in the current
agenda of porters.</p>

<p> <strong> About <em>ext/B/t/optree_specials.t</em> </strong>
Back in October 5, Mohammad Yaseen commented on the output of
running the <em>ext/B/t/optree_specials.t</em> test on
EBCDIC platform z/OS. At Christmas' eve, Nicholas Clark guessed
it probably had to do with different representation
of the same string on non-ASCII systems, leading
to different numeric hash values.</p>

<h2> <a name="runperl_and__inc"> <code>runperl</code> and <code>@INC</code> </a> </h2>
</p> <p>Yitzchak Scott-Thoennes delved into a long-standing test failure he had
been seeing on Cygwin, and diagnosed two separate problems. One
about test data in the real lib directory (<em>lib/charnames.t</em>).
The second about <code>runperl()</code> using real <code>@INC</code> directories.
Yitzchak proposed a patch with <code>runperl()</code> using
<code>TestInit.pm</code> and saw only a failure at <em>op/stash.t</em> which
had to do with a yet unfixed bug.
With no immediate solution, Yitzchak opened for others to try it
out, before sweeping the problem to under the carpet as a paliative measure.
After a long silence, Rafael Garcia-Suarez saw <em>op/stash.t</em>
to succeed and <em>t/run/switchd.t</em> to fail.
Nicholas Clark noticed failures with threaded perls
which he tracked down and corrected with some changes.</p>

<p>Some of this work by Andy was inspired by analysis
of the coverage stats which S&#233;bastien "maddingue" Aperghis-Tramoni
made available. Graham Barr pointed there might some catches for
the optimization of <code>(rn|n)?instr</code> with respect to modern CPUs.
And Rafael Garcia-Suarez supposed the <code>SVREFCNT</code> fix comes
with no impact on performance. At last, Andy launched
the support for GCC builtins <code>__builtin_expect</code> and
<code>__builtin_choose_expr</code> in source code, which later may
be applied to hot spots detected in maddingue's reports.
Rafael Garcia-Suarez preferred to defer the introduction of
these features and the corresponding Configure patch after 5.9.3
and H. Merijn Brand will have everything ready by this time.</p>

</p> <p>H.Merijn Brand perceived some 'M' failures in smokes
with longdoubles on Linux 2.6.12 and up with gcc-4.0.2 and up.
Merijn wondered if others were having similar issues.
Rafael Garcia-Suarez reported on successful builds with
similar settings. Later, Merijn found the problem to
be the <strong>gcc</strong> he had been using, a prerelease 4.0.2,
and confirmed perl configures and builds fine with
4.0.2 release and 4.0.3 prerelease. There remained some
problems Jim Cromie had seen which cast some doubts on
the use of long doubles in current Perl sources.</p>

</p> <p>Yves Orton pinched a sneaky issue on Win32 on
<em>ext/b/t/lint.t</em>. And, while we're on <code>B::Lint</code>,
let me remind the comments of Joshua ben Jore on the last
summary. With respect to <code>B::Lint</code> plugins,
Joshua made clear that (1) benchmarking is needed to establish
the cost of plugins against the embedded existing checks,
(2) he doesn't see the value of fussing around just to
make examples for people, as he'll be publishing more plugins
that may serve this end, (3) he may as well make available some material
(presentation slides) on doing lint-like checks after some updating.</p>

<h2> <a name="cpanplus_in_core"> <code>CPANPLUS</code> in Core?</a> </h2>
</p> <p>Yitzchak Scott-Thoennes remembered that, in June, Rafael
announced the addition of <code>Archive::Tar</code> to the core,
as the last addition before <code>CPANPLUS</code> and asked what next.
A long discusssion ensued, with lots of pros and cons.
To make it short, among the drawbacks, there are: core is
big enough; <em>CPAN.pm</em> is stable and <code>CPANPLUS</code> caused much
pain so far; <code>CPANPLUS</code> is a little too generous
with memory requirements; some say it is too Linux centric;
some issues on requisites may remain, like <code>IPC::Run</code>.
Andreas Koenig also reminded us of the new goodness added to
the last versions of CPAN. On the side of the advantages,
<code>CPANPLUS</code> provides an API which "is a real pleasure";
<code>CPAN</code> is not really light, but according to Jos "kane" Bouman,
<code>CPANPLUS</code> by design trades memory for speed.
Believe me, many things have been said. If you want real details,
follow the thread.</p>

<h2> <a name="make_j2_disttest_fails"> <strong>make -j2 disttest</strong> Fails</a> </h2>
</p> <p>Nicholas noticed
a parallel make of the <strong>disttest</strong> target (<code>make -j2 disttest</code>)
was failing.
Steve Peters came to the rescue: the problem was apparently
related solely to BSD-based makes and not GNU make.
<code>make -j2 -B disttest</code> works for BSD make -
the man page says -j turns compatibility off, and -B restores it.
The issue: cd's in GNU make works for the current command
and returns to the start directory after completed.</p>

<h2> <a name="doc_patches">Doc Patches</a> </h2>
</p> <p>Who said programmers don't like to write documentation?
If that's true, they at least enjoy fixing POD.</p>
<p> <strong> <code>UNIVERSAL</code>: Don't Use Methods as Functions </strong>
chromatic proposed a patch
against <em>lib/UNIVERSAL.pm</em> to remove the recommendation to use
<code>isa()</code>, <code>can()</code>, and <code>VERSION()</code> as functions,
responsible for too much damage in his view.
The suggestion might seem a natural followup
of chromatic's contribution as one of the authors
of the controversial <code>UNIVERSAL::can</code> and the not
so rebellious <code>UNIVERSAL::isa</code>.
Yves Orton proposed instead a fix with basically
the same rationale of the the mentioned modules, which Rafael
thought to be a pretty big change, making <code>UNIVERSAL::isa</code>
inaccessible to those which override <code>isa</code>. In such grounds,
Rafael declined the patch
as it undocumented existing functionality and asked for a
perspective change.
Rafael also reminded that <code>Scalar::Util::reftype</code> can be used
in place of <code>UNIVERSAL::isa</code>.
And chromatic brought a new patch
"that moves the broken code to the end, where people will
hopefully not see it." The patch pleased Yves and Rafael
and got applied as change #26466.</p>

documentation, namely, when using the object interface one
must use <code>new File::Temp(TEMPLATE =&gt; $template)</code> to constrain
the generated filenames. Rafael Garcia-Suarez agreed and
applied a corresponding patch as change 26753.</p>

Yitzchak Scott-Thoennes missed <code>Pod::Perldoc</code> not being listed
in <em>perlmodlib</em>, even though most <code>Pod::Perldoc::*</code> were there.
Rafael Garcia-Suarez noted it was because <em>Perldoc.pm</em> had no POD.
How ironic, repeating Yitzchak's words.</p>

<p> <strong> <code>lc()</code> Failures with Latin-1 Chars </strong>
Daniel Richard G., in ticket #37999,
reported how certain accented letters in a word (using Latin-1 chars)
were not being lowercased by <code>lc()</code>, with some curiosities
involving <code>chop</code> and <code>chomp</code>. Rafael Garcia-Suarez fixed
it by harmonizing code of <code>do_chomp()</code> and <code>do_chop()</code>
(change #26431). Daniel noticed that, if the string isn't modified via
chomp/chop/etc.,
the accented letters stay as-is. To Rafael, it's just the documented
behavior if you don't use <code>locale</code>.</p>

<p> <strong>Effects of Patch 26370</strong>
Andreas Koenig was biten by the weird state of things
after change 26370 where there can be files
that one can <code>use</code> but that perl cannot compile.
Andreas mentioned as examples the <code>Acme::Meta</code> distro
and <code>Devel-Symdump-2.04</code> based on the former. Rafael
Garcia-Suarez reduced the problem to a shorter test case
and fixed the issue with change 26574, which made
Andreas very happy, releasing <code>Devel::Symdump</code> 2.05
out to the world.</p>

<p> <strong>Beware Floating Point</strong>
stassats opened ticket #38120 to say about oddities
of perl printing numbers like '2.23999999999999'
instead of the prettier '2.24' equivalents. chromatic
remembered floating point math is subject to
rounding error, in Perl and every other programming
language, and Ronald J. Kimball found the answer
to be a FAQ which can be found with <strong>perldoc -q 9999</strong>.</p>

<p> <strong> Parser Bug with <code>'; sub f'</code> </strong>
Lukas Mai, in RT ticket #38121, found what he thinks to be a
parser bug. Yet to be commented.</p>
<pre>
    $ perl -c -e '; sub f'
    syntax error at -e line 1, at EOF
    -e had compilation errors.</pre>
