Their pros and cons have been extensively discussed in recent Perlmonks threads. Perl Seminar NY, New York City's monthly Perl user group, is pleased to announce that Perlmonk contributor xdg -- known in what is alleged to be real life as David A Golden -- will be speaking on Inside-Out Objects at our Tuesday, January 17 meeting. Details: Perl Seminar NY. Tuesday, January 17, 6:15-8:15 pm. NYPC User Group Office Suite. 481 8 Ave (Ramada New Yorker Hotel building), btw West 34 &amp; 35 Sts, Manhattan. Room 550."</i></p>

<h2>Too bad</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Abigail/">Abigail</a> on 2006-01-10T01:33:34</h3>
Too bad it's quite out of town for me. I've heard a few good things about Inside-Out Objects....

I'll post the presentation after I give it.  I do credit you with the technique going back to the 1992 YAPC presentation and subsequent perlmonks posts.  (Is there an earlier reference?  I couldn't find one.)

A 1992 YAPC? Wow, that's a few years before I heard about a programming language called Perl...<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)
<p>
I think it's 2002 that I made my first presentation about it to a wider audience. I first demonstrated the technique in 2001 during a PM meeting in Amsterdam.</p>

Doh!  (On the other hand, I haven't written 2005 instead of 2006 yet, which I usually get wrong by now in January.)<br><br>Do you happen to remember the date of the presentation to the Amsterdam.pm?  Is the presentation available online anywhere?

It wasn't a formal presentation, so there's nothing on-line. I just did a "look at my newest trick" of a couple of minutes towards the end of the meeting using a flip-over. I'm not sure of the date, but it was probably either March 6, 2001, April 3, 2001 or May 1, 2001. Certainly not before (my first visit to Amsterdam PM was in Februari 2001, and I did a formal presentation that time) and most likely not later as around that time we changed venues and I first showed the techique in the old location.

<h2>Is which module to use part of the talk?</h2>

<p>I know that one is by the speaker but that is about it.</p>

It's not explicitly about which module to use.  Rather, it's a more general, introductory tutorial covering concepts, choices, and complexity of the inside-out technique.  To illustrate these points, I will step through and explain the construction of a very simple inside-out module.<br><br>The goal is to fairly present the pros and cons of the technique and allow the audience to reach their own conclusions about its worth for them.<br><br>Time permitting, I will cover some of the CPAN modules.  (I have some bonus slides with a tabular feature comparison of all 7 CPAN modules that build inside-out objects.)<br><br>That said, I only recommend the two you posted.  In preparing my talk, I realized that all of the existing modules had some aspect or feature that wasn't purely related to the inside-out technique and that might be objectionable to some.  I wrote Class::InsideOut in response as a simple, safe, minimal implementation.

I look forward to reading your presentation about it when you post it after your talk.
