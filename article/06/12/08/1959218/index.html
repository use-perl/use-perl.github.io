<p>The Perl 6 Design team met via phone on 06 December 2006. Larry, Allison, Patrick, Jesse, Nicholas, and chromatic attended. These are the notes.</p>
<p><p> <strong>Allison:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>checked in the IO PDD</li>
<li>need to post a message about that</li>
<li>I have some questions</li>
<li>no one will likely read through the diff</li>
<li>typing the list of platform requirements to add to PDD 0 or PDD 1</li>
<li>I'll check that in later today</li> </ul>

<p> <strong>Jesse:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>anything interesting going on with the external folks using Parrot?</li>
<li>Ruby and Python?</li> </ul>

<p> <strong>Allison:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>the Pythonish people stalled out on lack of time</li>
<li>there is no external Ruby implementation going now</li>
<li>tewk's is in tree</li>
<li>the external Cardinal died due to lack of time</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Patrick:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>I haven't looked at Pyrate very much</li>
<li>is it worth evaluating it in terms of the new compiler toolkit?</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Allison:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>I think that's the way to go</li>
<li>I think it stalled under the weight of its infrastructure</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Patrick:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>things are going quite well</li>
<li>last Friday I spent the day coding</li>
<li>the compiler now handles quoting in all sorts of forms</li>
<li>double and single angle brackets, interpolators, embedded method calls, etc</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Nicholas:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>at least this week :)</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Patrick:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>and for the forseeable future!</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Allison:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>how extractable is that feature?</li>
<li>can you make that available to other compilers?</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Patrick:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>parsing that doesn't seem to lend itself to bottom-up or top-down parsing</li>
<li>the trick is that I wrote my own quote term parser in PIR</li>
<li>it's essentially the same thing that I do for PGE's Text::Bracketed</li>
<li>it was much easier to do that in PIR than in anything else</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Allison:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>are you grabbing the strings by delimited items?</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Patrick:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>you can't even do that</li>
<li>I tokenize as I go with a special tokenizer</li>
<li>I know when I start a quoted string and I know the adverbs in effect</li>
<li>then I go</li>
<li>I know what the characters mean with the adverbs in effect</li>
<li>just builds up the data structure as it goes</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Allison:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>when your tokenizer determines that it has completed, it hands back to the parser?</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Patrick:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>a match object with all of the pieces that it found</li>
<li>it looks like it came out of a rule</li>
<li>we just didn't use Perl 6 rules to get there</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Allison:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>long-term, we probably want to make that custom ability available to other compilers</li>
<li>a lot of languages will need something like that</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Patrick:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>I think the differences between the languages are significant enough that people will end up cargo-culting it</li>
<li>it's not that long a routine</li>
<li>if someone wants to come up with an API for it though, great!</li>
<li>it shows off all of the things you might want to do inside of that</li>
<li>I don't have <code>qq()</code> and <code>qw()</code> defined, but I just have to add the tokens for it</li>
<li>playing around more with HLL compiler object</li>
<li>reviewing parts of the Pugs test suite</li>
<li>checked in some changes to the range operator yesterday</li>
<li>now I need <code>for</code> loops and <code>END</code> blocks</li>
<li>have an implementation, but want to clean it up</li>
<li>need <code>try</code> blocks too</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Jesse:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>are they near the top of your list?</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Patrick:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>they are</li>
<li>everything I've done is getting those to work</li>
<li>also looking at class name mappings</li>
<li>just have to figure out where I want to store them</li>
<li>the infrastructure is all in place</li>
<li>once I have the sanity tests passing, it opens up a whole realm of things</li>
<li>people can jump in and add things</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Larry:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>mostly just working</li>
<li>continue to work out the relationships of bags, sets, and hashes</li>
<li>trying to keep the smart match table simplified</li>
<li>also noticed an extra set of braces every time I use a gather</li>
<li>decided to make it use the same syntax as do</li>
<li>now expects any statement afterwards</li>
<li>possibly that doesn't make sense, but we'll see</li>
<li>you can still use a block if you want</li>
<li>seemed like a notational convenience I kept wanting</li>
<li>after I did that three times, I put it in</li>
<li>hand-translated my work program back to Perl 5 to get it running faster</li>
<li>I look forward to have that running on a fast engine</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Jesse:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>how much more verbose and painful did it end up?</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Larry:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>about twice as long</li>
<li>I cheated a little bit on line count, but....</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Jesse:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>were any of the 6 on 5 alternatives workable?</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Larry:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>I didn't try</li>
<li>I considered that alternative, but I can't tell you why exactly I didn't try it</li>
<li>the wrong computer in the wrong place at the wrong time, I guess</li>
<li>maybe I felt like I needed punishment for my past sins</li>
<li>physically trying to take it easy over the next couple of months</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>c:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>setting up a bug day</li>
<li>I'll spread the word further</li>
<li>have had positive feedback so far</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Nicholas:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>saw a Perl 6 (when released) job offer in Oxford</li>
<li>at least someone wants it released</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Jesse:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>lots of people do!</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Patrick:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>I could use some guidance or suggestions on how to deal with lazy lists in Parrot</li>
<li>what's the trick to doing lazy lists in Parrot?</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>c:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>iterators and generators with a defined interface</li>
<li>that's basically it</li>
<li>Higher Order Perl is good place to start</li>
<li>SICP has value too</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Larry:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>basically an abstraction</li>
<li>look if it's there, then generate it</li>
<li>might need some caching</li>
<li>an iterator just iterates and throws it away</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Patrick:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>looking at the for loop</li>
<li>when I have <code>for</code> and LIST or <code>for</code> and ITERATOR</li>
<li>how synonymous are LIST and ITERATOR?</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Larry:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>depends on whether you consider that for operating on a pre-generated list iterates over an iterator</li>
<li>or a list of lists</li>
<li>if you venture into terra incognita if you have to call a generator on the next list</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Patrick:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>the Synopses are relatively silent on accessing iterators</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Larry:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>basically any list context expects to receive a lazy list</li>
<li>depends on what it's bound to and how it reads out what it's interested in</li>
<li>but it's lazy</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Patrick:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>it's not something I need right away</li>
<li>the first few implementations will likely use eager lists to get the tests running</li>
<li>just want to get things running first</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Larry:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>Pugs won't help either</li>
<li>Haskell gives that implementation for free</li>
<li>there are some iterators that want to be eager</li>
<li>generate the next 50 items</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Patrick:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>is there an interface that they expect to have?</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Larry:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>the Apocalypses handwaved about a <code>.specs</code> method for example</li>
<li>mostly we're making it up as we go along</li>
<li>if we have to bend the specs to be more rational, we'll have more rational specs</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Patrick:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>are the specs waiting for us to do an implementation we can react to?</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Larry:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>lots of places in the specs where I have an idea about the abstract interface</li>
<li>waiting for various implementations to negotiate other things, such as the introspection interface</li>
<li>it'll shake out</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>c:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>be careful of the semi-predicate problem</li>
<li>often easier to have a method on the iterator that tells you if you've exhausted it</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Larry:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>don't want to run into the <code>eof()</code> problem again</li>
<li>sometimes you have to read it to know if there's something remaining</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>c:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>you can't always solve that for IO, especially network IO</li>
</ul></p>
