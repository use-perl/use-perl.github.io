<p><p> <em>&quot;So I don't really have an answer for you. When faced with a similar
situation, I punted and did a PerlIO_fdopen(fileno(stdio)) instead of
a PerlIO_importFILE(stdio).  This way you know you are creating a
unixio layer which gets ref counted properly.&quot;</em> -- Craig A. Berry,
somewhere in the sprawling PerlIO layers saga.</p></p>

<h1> <a name="topics_of_interest">Topics of Interest</a> </h1>
<p>
<h2> <a name="perlio__scalar_buffering"> <code>PerlIO::Scalar</code> buffering</a> </h2>

<p>H.Merijn Brand wondered if he had uncovered a problem with performing
IO to a scalar, since at the end of a series of operations where the
scalar should have been emptied, a lone newline character remained.</p>

<h2> <a name="whither_5_8_9">Whither 5.8.9</a> </h2>
<p>Jerry D. Hedden wondered if there was going to be a 5.8.9 release, and if
so would arrive before 5.10.0. H.Merijn Brand confirmed that a 5.8.9 release
is going to happen some time, and it's likely to escape from the lab before
5.10. No dates have been set for either event as yet.</p>

<h2> <a name="old_dmakes_for_building_perl_on_win32___">Old <code>dmake</code>s for building perl on Win32...</a> </h2>
<p>Steve Hay noticed that recent changes to the Makefiles for Windows are
no longer understood by the older make programs floating around in the
Windows world. He felt that the best approach was to update the README
to explain the fix, in the unlikely event that someone encounters it,
and to move on.</p>

<p>
<h2> <a name="____and_archaic_visual_c___compilers">... and archaic Visual C++ compilers</a> </h2>

<p>Steve also noted that the compiler writers at Microsoft have played the
compiler command line switch fandango in recent versions, and now
warnings are emitted when certain deprecated switches are used.  To
get things into shape means drawing the line at VC++ 5.0.  This
equates to roughly a 10 year old compiler. The Makefile states that
things should be compatible all the way back to 2.0, but Steve has
his doubts.</p>
<p>Nicholas Clark pointed out that if people really need to use a pre-5.0
compiler, all they have to do is change the new-name switch back to
old-name, and things should work. Steve updated <em>README.win32</em> to note
this point.</p>

<h2> <a name="trouble_with_perlio_init_perlio_term_changes">Trouble with PERLIO_INIT/PERLIO_TERM changes</a> </h2>
<p>Steve Hay and Jarkko Hietaniemi tried to make sense of the ongoing
PerlIO problems, in that reference counts were going too far negative
and bad things were happening as a result. And the code was a bit
too twisty for people to understand exactly what was happening. My
eyes sort of glazed over on this thread.</p>

<p>It eventually wound up being filed as a bug, see below.</p>
<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/tqdz">http://xrl.us/tqdz</a> </pre>
<p>Also, in another thread, Steve also wondered whether
<strong>PerlIO_importFILE()</strong> needed to do a <code>refcnt_inc</code>. Craig A. Berry
showed him how to test the hypothesis. One thing that came out of
it is that Steve noticed that the code was leaking file descriptors.</p>
<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/tqd2">http://xrl.us/tqd2</a> </pre>

<p>Similarly, Yves Orton found a segfault on Windows due
to one of the many changes that were attempted this week
to come to grips with these issues. Rafa&#235;l was pretty
sure about which patch was the problem, and when Yves reverted it,
his build succeeded in starting the test suite.</p>

<p>
<h2> <a name="pathtools_now_at_svk_perl_org"> <code>PathTools</code> now at svk.perl.org</a> </h2>
<p>Ken Williams announced that he'd thrown up <code>File::Spec</code> and <code>Cwd</code>,
on a Subversion repository, and asked if there were any volunteers
who wanted to poke around at them. Philippe Bruhat bravely stepped
forward.</p>

<pre>

<p>
<h2> <a name="change__26513_breaks_devel__smallprof">Change #26513 breaks <code>Devel::SmallProf</code> </a> </h2>
<p>Nicholas Clark found that the addition of an assertion to ensure
an AV is always non-null made <code>Devel::SmallProf</code> curl up and die,
and didn't what to do about it.</p>
<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/tqd5">http://xrl.us/tqd5</a> </pre>

<p>In the new month, the thread continued: Gisle Aas observed that
the problem went away of the build was configured with <code>usethreads</code>.
Rafa&#235;l Garcia-Suarez realised that the heart of the problem lay
in <em>toke.c</em>, and made the appropriate change there.</p>
<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/tqd6">http://xrl.us/tqd6</a> </pre>
<p>
<h2> <a name="minor_patch_for_benchmark_pm">Minor patch for <code>Benchmark.pm</code> </a> </h2>
<p>Christophe Grosjean patched what he thought was a minor problem
in <code>Benchmark</code>, but was really quite a significant bug when you
think about it: <code>cmpthese</code> used to ignore child process times,
which led to the fascinating outcome that a process that spawned
an external command appeared to be faster than something done in
native Perl.</p>

<h1> <a name="patches_of_interest">Patches of Interest</a> </h1>
<p>
<h2> <a name="abstract_mempool_header_testing">Abstract mempool header testing</a> </h2>
<p>Jarkko did a bit of work on memory pools, (that approximates the
conditions of Win32 on Unix), where memory allocation (especially
in threads) is a much trickier issue. Nicholas Clark gave a clear
explanation of how the mechanisms present in the source code fitted
together, and Jan Dubois completed the picture.</p>
<p>Based especially upon Jan's information, Jarkko produced a patch to
attempt to clear up some PerlIO problems. Jan, however, thought
that the code in question traded one set of problems (the mempool
allocations) for another (leaking stuff from the opcode tree instead),
and explained how to fix that problem</p>

<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/tqd8">http://xrl.us/tqd8</a> </pre>
<p>As the month rolled over into December, Yves Orton took a stab at
the matter, pointing to a couple of spots in the code that he felt
relied on flawed assumptions.  The patches went back and forth, and
I lost track of which patch undid what, and which ones were reverted.</p>
<p>Jan Dubois suggested one strategy for getting things straightened
out, and Jarkko coded it up as a patch. This seemed to fix things
sufficiently well that Steve Hay was able to unrevert a previously
reverted patch with everything still behaving itself.</p>
<p>Yves was most impressed, but also confused, and asked if there was some
documentation that explained The Big Picture. Steve Hay did his best to
illuminate the part of the canvas that he understood, hoping that Jan
Dubois would chip in and complete as necessary. And so he did. Jan gave
a thorough best expos&#233; on the issue of mempools here:</p>
<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/tqd9">http://xrl.us/tqd9</a> </pre>
<p>Now all we need is for someone to draw a diagram of the myriad ways
in which one may allocate memory in perl. The thread in the December,
from the top:</p>

<h2> <a name="building_5_8_8_on_os_2">Building 5.8.8 on OS/2</a> </h2>
<p>Ilya Zakharevich delivered a patch to get 5.8.8 compiling again on
OS/2. There are still some tests that fail, and Ilya promised to
address them in a future patch.</p>
<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/tqeb">http://xrl.us/tqeb</a> </pre>
<p>
<h2> <a name="perl5db_on_miniperl"> <code>perl5db</code> on <code>miniperl</code> </a> </h2>

<p>Similarly, Ilya noticed that <em>perl5db.pl</em> no longer worked with
<code>miniperl</code>, due to a reliance on <code>IO::Handle</code>, which was not yet
fully operational at that stage of the build process. So he tweaked
things to handle this situation gracefully.</p>
<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/tqec">http://xrl.us/tqec</a> </pre>
<p>
<h2> <a name="test__class_and_blead"> <code>Test::Class</code> and blead</a> </h2>

<p>A test in <code>Test::Class</code> tested for a bogus regular expression, and
was supposed to die. The funny part was that thanks to Yves Orton's
tireless efforts, what used to be a meaningless string of characters
is now a legal pattern, so the pattern matches and the test fails.</p>
<p>So Nicholas Clark made the pattern even more bogus, to force the
pattern to fail again. Which judging by Yves's prodigious output,
should see the test safe for a least three weeks.</p>

to allow the debugger to be fired up in a separate terminal window
on Mac OS/X.</p>

<p>Joshua ben Jore was one of the first people to take advantage of
<code>Module::Pluggable</code>'s new promotion to core, and rewrote <code>B::Lint</code>

to make use of it. He was immensely pleased, since it meant that he
was able to rip out the previous clumsy efforts.</p>

<h2> <a name="perl_regexp_structures_bifurcation">Perl regexp structures bifurcation</a> </h2>
<p>Yves Orton continued to deliver a stream of changes to introduce a
higher level of abstraction to the regular expression engine. This
is part of his ongoing work to permit pluggable engines.</p>
<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/tqeh">http://xrl.us/tqeh</a> </pre>
<p>
<h2> <a name="_r_means_something_else_in_posix"> <code>\R</code> means something else in POSIX</a> </h2>

<p>Yves discovered that not only does the Unicode consortium care about
regular expressions, they even published a specification on the
matter. Yves read the spec, and learnt that they recommend using
<code>\R</code> as a best-practice sequence for specifying a generic line-break
marker.</p>
<p>This unfortunately clashes with <code>\R</code> as a relative back-reference
assertion in Perl's regular expression, but since we are still not
out of beta, Yves was quite happy to cast around for a different
unused character. After looking around at what was left of the
alphabet, he settled in <code>\g</code> (as in group). He implemented a
generalised syntax with curly braces, so that now <code>\g1</code> or <code>\g{1}</code>

is the same as the existing <code>\1</code>, and conversely, that <code>\g-1</code> and
<code>\g{-1}</code> as a replacement for the now-defunct <code>\R1</code> syntax. (Yves,
if you're reading this, doesn't that mean you could drop
<code>\k&lt;foo&gt;</code> and subsume it into <code>\g&lt;foo&gt;</code>? You have
15 minutes to write the patch).</p>

<p>Yves also thought that implement <code>\R</code> shouldn't be too difficult either,
noting in passing that Philip Hazel will be delivering it in the next
release of PCRE.</p>

did not match the same thing as a character class (<code>[ab]</code>). What
was worse was that the original program, when it didn't crash, the
values of other assorted variables in the program mysteriously
changed. Yves Orton figured out what the problem was, and developed
a patch to fix things up.</p>

a pleasing side-effect of all the work that the engine has received in recent

<p>Johan Vromans was worried that <strong>adding <code>Module::Load::Conditional</code>
