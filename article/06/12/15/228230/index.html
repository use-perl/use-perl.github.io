<p><p>&quot;This comment in <em>mg.c</em> scares me: <code>/* Not sure why the av can get
freed ahead of its sv, but somehow it does */</code>&quot; -- Marc Lehmann,
uncovering ancient evil.</p></p>

<h2> <a name="madly_duplicated_files">madly duplicated files</a> </h2>

<p>Dave Mitchell performed some stellar file refactoring to bring
Misc Attribute Decoration under control. As a result, the only
extra file is a two-liner <em>madly.c</em> file.</p>

<h2> <a name="how_to_create_a_new_config_setting">How to create a new Config setting?</a> </h2>
<p>Steve Hay wanted to add a new Config variable to indicate that
perl was simply capable of emulating a <code>fork</code>. This would eliminate
the need for some exceptionally hairy boolean logic that no-one gets
right, and thus is subject to error.</p>

<p>He knew how to create new entries in the <code>win32</code> config files, but
wasn't sure how to move on from there. H.Merijn Brand explained that
the process was semi-automated, although he had spent time improving
it recently so that less manual work was required.</p>
<p>Craig Berry noted that it would be nice to set this up for VMS as
well, since that platform lacks Unix-style <code>fork</code> semantics, but he
was happy to punt with an <code>undef</code> for the time being.</p>

<h2> <a name="undo_vos_breakage_caused_by_change__28892">Undo VOS breakage caused by change #28892</a> </h2>
<p>There is an array of data that the regular expression engine uses,
but if debugging is enabled, the core needs to know about it as
well. And since a debugging build is the exception, and we don't
want to bloat the core for no reason, the array is hosted
either the extension or the core, depending on whether <code>-DDEBUGGING</code>
is defined.</p>
<p>Paul Green discovered that a recent patch from Yves Orton failed
to build on Stratus VOS, because the linker ended up failing to
link the array to anything in a debugging build. Yves explained it
all very well, so hopefully Paul will be able to concoct something
that satisfies the VOS linker.</p>

<h2> <a name="latest_perl_in_cygwin_is_5_8_7">Latest Perl in Cygwin is 5.8.7</a> </h2>
<p>Adriano Ferreira wondered why the latest available Perl for Cygwin
was not 5.8.8. (hint: the current maintainer stepped down and
asked for volunteers to take over. Does this sound familiar?)</p>
<p>Slaven Rezic said that he had succeeded in building some of the
trickier modules such as <code>Tk</code>, and so he and H.Merijn Brand
swapped notes.</p>
<pre>
  <a href="http://xrl.us/twg5">http://xrl.us/twg5</a> </pre>
<p>In other Cygwin news, Jan Dubois tweaked <em>Makefile.PL</em> to get it
to compile <em>Win32.xs</em>.</p>

<h2> <a name="do_we_care_about_old_dmakes_for_building_perl_on_win32">Do we care about old <code>dmake</code>s for building perl on Win32?</a> </h2>
<p>Following on from Steve Hay's desire to drop old <code>make</code> support
on Win32, David Landgren asked whether it would be possible for an
explanatory error message to be issued if an old <code>dmake</code> was pressed
into service, to give the luckless programmer a pointer to the
documentation that tells them what to do.</p>

<p>Steve tweaked the <code>Makefile</code> and therefore showed that it was
possible, except that the message doesn't explain what to do
to fix the problem.</p>

<h2> <a name="fields_pragma_in_blead_prohibits_reblessing"> <code>fields</code> pragma in blead prohibits reblessing</a> </h2>
<p>Andreas K&#246;nig noticed that one can no longer bless a <code>fields</code>

object into another package (noticed by the fact that a CPAN
module, <code>Danga::Socket</code>, now fails its test suite).</p>
<p>Dan Kogai, the module in question's author offered a workaround
to repair the breakage, but remained puzzled as to why the
error (<code>Modification of a read-only value</code>) was occurring.</p>

<h2> <a name="deadlock_in_ext_threads_shared_t_cond_t_on_bleadperl">Deadlock in <em>ext/threads/shared/t/cond.t</em> on bleadperl</a> </h2>

<p>Jan Dubois saw regular deadlocks in a <code>threads</code> test on Win32,
and wondered if it was related to the hangs that Steve Hay
sees in his test smokes. Steve Hay in turn thought that this
particular problem started showing up around the time threads
1.53 was released.</p>
<p>Jerry D. Hedden thought that the problem is probably quite deep and
has only come to light now that multi-CPU boxes are more common,
and thus are really testing the threads implementation instead of
just pretending. If fact, he figured out how the test was failing,
but didn't know how to track down the culprit that would explain
why.</p>

<h2> <a name="regexp_test_coverage_teaser">Regexp test coverage teaser</a> </h2>
<p>Nicholas had a long conversation with himself after looking at
S&#233;bastien Aperghis-Tramoni's coverage reports and noticing that
only the UTF-8 variant of a section of code in the regexp engine
was visited by the test suite.</p>

<p>He wanted to find a non-UTF-8 pattern to shed light on the other
side of the path. He managed to find one, but felt that the fact
that it used <code>re 'eval'</code> was cheating a bit. He then thought of
a better way, but tripped over a bug in a <code>study</code>'ed variable.</p>
<p>Yves Orton said he'd take a look at things when he had some time.</p>

<h2> <a name="user_pragmas_now_accessible_from_b">User pragmas now accessible from <code>B</code> </a> </h2>
<p>Joshua ben Jore taught the <code>B</code> modules how to deal with user
pragmas. Steve Hay and Yves Orton taught the patch to play nicely on
Windows, and Rafa&#235;l Garcia-Suarez fixed up the tests.</p>

<h2> <a name="deparse_pm_gets_confused_by_slices"> <code>Deparse.pm</code> gets confused by slices</a> </h2>

<p>Bo Lindbergh produced a patch to stop <code>Deparse.pm</code> getting confused
between package and lexical variables when slices are involved.
Nicholas Clark chided him for copying code, so Bo came back with a
fully-refactored improvement that Rafa&#235;l applied.</p>

<p>Sean M. Burke asked if anyone wanted to take over the maintenance
of <code>perldoc</code>, since he no longer had the time to devote the
attention it requires. Which is in fact not a whole lot.</p>

<p>Marc Lehmann noted that <code>gcc 4.1.2 20061115 (prerelease) (Debian 4.1.1-20)</code>
would rebuild perl every time <code>make</code> was run. Neither Andy Dougherty
nor Rafa&#235;l were able to reproduce the problem.</p>

<p>Marc also noted that any time he tried to use weak references in
any non-trivial program, it would crash in any number of different
and entertaining ways. Try as he might he was not able to produce
a small test case, but offered some suggestions as to where to look.</p>
