<p><b>This week on the Perl 6 mailing lists</b>
<p>"Your faithful Dynamic Environmentalist"</p>

<p>-- closing signature of Bob Rogers in 'RFC:  Proposal for dynamic binding'</p></p>
<p><p> <b>Language</b> </p>
<p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/2573667ed02fa746/8adf680b669631ac?#8adf680b669631ac">[svn:perl6-synopsis] r13487 - doc/trunk/design/syn</a> </i> </p>
<p>Last week,
a commit from Larry Wall related to expanding tabs led TSa to ask
if array equivalence should be defined in terms of Bags.  Larry replied
that he felt most people would prefer to look at Sets and Bags as Hashes,
so he will not include Sets and Bags in the smartmatching table.  Darren
Duncan also felt that the current summary in Synopsis 6 was adequate.</p>

<p>This week, TSa responded to Darren's request that any change requests
be explained in detail.  According to TSa, the intent was not to change
the synopsis but to have a few points clarified on list, such as the
subtype relationship between Set and Bag.  TSa also asked if KeyHash,
KeySet and KeyBag are forced in to sigiled variables.  Darren replied
that he would expect that they would work like hashes.</p>

<p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/f5024ac015d7f1fd/20b4d0892d7b70de?#20b4d0892d7b70de">[svn:perl6-synopsis] r13488 - doc/trunk/design/syn</a> </i> </p>
<p>In this commit, Larry Wall clarified the relationship between Set/Bag and
KeyHash.</p>

<p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/93185d61da6d23d7/68cad915716ded4a?#68cad915716ded4a">[svn:perl6-synopsis] r13489 - doc/trunk/design/syn</a> </i> </p>
<p>Larry Wall elaborated on <code>gather</code>, which has been modified to be more
like <code>do</code> in that it allows any statement.</p>

<p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/c109058ee78cbec8/3635dc86ce2a6b4c?#3635dc86ce2a6b4c">Gather/Take and threads</a> </i> </p>
<p>Given a gather block which spawns multiple threads,
Joe Gottman wanted to know if it is guaranteed that no object returned
is lost, given that the relative order of items returned is
indeterminate.</p>

<p> <b>Parrot Porters</b> </p>
<p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/1fd0d3b432c2e425/664324a6e0a3d691?#664324a6e0a3d691">RFC:  Proposal for dynamic binding</a> </i> </p>
<p>This thread was started by Bob Roger's proposal for dynamic binding.
He compared two options, and later gave an analysis of a third (STM)
at Leopold Toetsch's request.</p>

<p>Last week, Allison Randal responded to the proposal with the question of
why dynamic binding should only apply to globals.  She stated that
the proposed implementation was not being approved, but noted that one
of Bob's ideas concerning threads was of particular interest and likely
to be included at some point.  Bob replied in depth to the points she
raised and asked if he could improve the proposal or if he should give
it up.</p>

<p>This week there was further discussion between Allison and Bob.</p>

<p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/efdd72880e1fa991/368c89f0cf52e2d8?#368c89f0cf52e2d8">[perl #40958] [BUG] - can&#39;t iterate subclass of ResizablePMCArray </a> </i> </p>
<p>chromatic responded to ticket <a href="http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=40958">[perl #40958]</a> by including a patch which
demonstrates the problem in the iteration code within the PMC.  He noted
that this is not the correct fix.</p>

<p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/39f0c232f5beeb71/1f776b9dd5218ca8?#1f776b9dd5218ca8">[perl #40966] [BUG] Parrot core dumps in perl6 (possible GC/pointer bug?) </a> </i> </p>
<p>Earlier, Patrick R. Michaud reported a bug in ticket <a href="http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=40966">[perl #40966]</a>.</p>

<p>This week, Matt Diephouse responded.  He had seen the error in a different
test, and identified the failing assertion.  The problem seems to be that
constant strings are being garbage collected too soon.  He supplied a patch
to not collect any constant PObj headers, but was not certain that was
what should happen.  </p>

<p>Leopold Toetsch replied that if they were being collected, they were
being initially created in different object pools and then stored as
constants.  He requested information about the origin and
contents of the constant, in order to track down where it was being created.</p>

<p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/9ea7288dbf2ccf6f/1f82b5d4c00129b5?#1f82b5d4c00129b5">Initial feedback on PAST-pm, or Partridge</a> </i> </p>
<p>Earlier,
Allison Randal initiated a discussion on Partridge (PAST-pm) with a post
of her comments on user experience and implementation.</p>

<p>One subthread which developed dealt with a number of unrelated points.
Leopold Toetsch joined Allison and Patrick R. Michaud in this thread.
One of the topics involved Parrot limitations related to :init methods.</p>

<p>This week, Allison responded to a proposal from Patrick and asked if he
had thought further about the syntax for initialization.  She also agreed
with treating moving code generation out of POST node objects as low priority.
Patrick replied to some of the points.</p>

<p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/1abf1b4a70e2938c/a3ce1e193c14cf7c?#a3ce1e193c14cf7c">[perl #41020] [PATCH] pmc2c.pl functionality extracted into separate package </a> </i> </p>
<p>Earlier,
in ticket <a href="http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=41020">[perl #41020]</a>, James Keenan supplied a patch to make
<code>pmc2c.pl</code> easier to test.  This involved putting most of the subroutines
in a new package.  He fixed a problem with <code>GetOptions</code> but thought there
were additional corrections to be made.</p>

<p>This week, James wrote that he had underestimated the challenges in testing
Parrot build tools.  He explained the problem, which involved the files
which exist and the state of the system at the time that the tests are
run, and concluded by asking what was the goal of testing the build
tools.</p>

<p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/2cf497690229cc95/bf39d288a2f19d7d?#bf39d288a2f19d7d">[PATCH] tru64: compile (src/nci.c) and runtime (src/memory.c)</a> </i> </p>
<p>Jarkko Hietaniemi submitted two patches.  One was to allow the Parrot
trunk to compile in Tru64, and the second one was to eliminate some
core dumps.</p>

<p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/16244caf97269a88/5280b748cd14fcae?#5280b748cd14fcae">[perl #41044] use warnings not clean </a> </i> </p>
<p>In ticket <a href="http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=41044">[perl #41044]</a>, Will Coleda reported a problem with
loading the platform and local hints file.</p>

<p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/9a730fd7af96a37d/81f9d2a999e71127?#81f9d2a999e71127">[perl #41047] [BUG] :multi doesn&#39;t work with :outer </a> </i> </p>
<p>Patrick R. Michaud created ticket <a href="http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=41047">[perl #41047]</a> to report an error
with the <code>:multi</code> pragma when <code>:outer</code> is present.  Matt Diephouse reported
it fixed in r15971.</p>

<p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/46d155e4979f09bd/0123288140f9f526?#0123288140f9f526">[perl #41051] [PATCH]:  Configure.pl:  Spell out what &#39;ICU&#39; means </a> </i> </p>
<p>James Keenan created ticket <a href="http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=41051">[perl #41051]</a> to request that the POD
in <code>Configure.pl</code> use 'International Components for Unicode' instead of
'ICU' for clarity.  Will Coleda applied the patch as r16021.</p>

<p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/ef8af1fcf997d661/918dd8f21cfb189a?#918dd8f21cfb189a">[perl #41052] [PATCH]:  docs/configuration.pod:  Small grammatical corrections </a> </i> </p>
<p>In ticket <a href="http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=41052">[perl #41052]</a>, James Keenan included a patch to correct
grammar in <code>docs/configuration.pod</code>.</p>

<p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/b3c6dd2347667f3b/096fdd3db7a27528?#096fdd3db7a27528">Bug Day!</a> </i> </p>
<p>chromatic suggested a virtual gathering on the 16th in #parrot.  The
purpose of the meeting is to examine the bug database to verify,
fix, or resolve issues.  Additionally, this meeting would serve
to help curious newcomers get started.  Lee Duhem felt that some
examples could be cleaned up to make it easier for people to get
started.</p>

<p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/5b3d0d265b85d089/c2f5a4215ffc3ff2?#c2f5a4215ffc3ff2">[perl #41053] [TODO] More useful dumping of Env PMC </a> </i> </p>
<p>Bernhard Schmalhofer thought that generic Hash dumping functionality
would make it easier to see things such as the Env PMC.  This request
was ticket <a href="http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=41053">[perl #41053]</a>.</p>

<p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/3c926c512f92bde4/dd2bc8f9443d5e60?#dd2bc8f9443d5e60">[svn:parrot-pdd] r16036 - trunk/docs/pdds/clip</a> </i> </p>
<p>Allison Randal added additional notes to the overview PDD on the target
platforms for Parrot.  The requirement for the 1.0 release of Parrot is
that it be supported on major versions of Linux, BSD, Mac OS X and
Windows.</p>

<p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/33fa840d77492cd0/12359b6bf035854c?#12359b6bf035854c">[perl #41055] [BUG]:  &#39;Argument is not numeric&#39; warning in Darwin configuration </a> </i> </p>
<p>In ticket <a href="http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=41055">[perl #41055]</a>, James Keenan registered a bug with running
<code>perl Configure.pl</code>, which seemed to be related to having a 3-level
version number.</p>
