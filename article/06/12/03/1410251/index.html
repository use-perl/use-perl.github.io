<p>-- Jonathan Worthington, 'Naming PAST-pm compiler tool chain'</p></p>
<p>
<p> <b>Language</b> </p>
<p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/bd6e492ac7ce0729/c03b9a1ad322e812?#c03b9a1ad322e812">Smart Matching clarification</a> </i> </p>
<p>Earlier, Jonathan Lang inquired about the matching operator for hash keys had
changed.  This led to a discussion about Sets, Seqs and Bags.</p>

<p>This week, in the subthread 'Set-returning .keys', Darren Duncan clarified
his views, stating that while he saw Bags as a superset of Sets, he did not
mean to suggest that their implementations should be related.  TSa suggested
that in a hypothetical inheritance structure, Set would be the main type and
Bag would extend it.  Ruud H.G. van Tol disagreed, stating that Set is more
complex to modify than Bag.</p>

<p>Some discussion of the appropriate return values and operations also
came up.  For example, Darren proposed that a union of two sets would
return a Set, and that Set operations should be terse as they would
be common.  </p>

<p>The thread '<a href="%23456C6DF9.8040805@barco.com">beg for Bag</a>' followed from this
discussion.</p>

<p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/5e4aee99795a2b75/f7e37c29ea7df04b?#f7e37c29ea7df04b">implementation for subset types</a> </i> </p>
<p>Last week,
TSa wanted to propose an addition to the subset type definitions, namely
an implementation body like classes and roles.  A rectangle example from
an earlier thread was included.  Jonathan Lang replied with an alternate
code example.</p>

<p>This week, TSa responded to Jonathan's post, wondering how a general
polygon would become an instance of an anonymous class once it was
modified to become a rectangle.  The purpose of the proposal was
clarified as providing a means to attach methods to subset types.</p>

<p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/75e5249301fcaf54/19f1665872d83181?#19f1665872d83181">beg for Bag</a> </i> </p>
<p>TSa started this new thread from the discussion in
'<a href="%23ef30550b0611161625g3f4aa74fw4716856924f218cf@mail.gmail.com">Smart Matching clarification</a>'.
He proposed the addition of a Bag type which completes the set of
immutable types.  Smylers wondered how this would differ from the Bag
which is mentioned in Synopsis 3.
Darren Duncan replied that while Bag is mentioned in examples, it is
not included in the list of built-in types in Synopsis 6.</p>

<p>An exchange between Tsa and Jonathan Lang on the set operations of Seq
was also part of this thread.</p>

<p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/dcc7d8701c9ba857/644fc0e5320c1411?#644fc0e5320c1411">[svn:perl6-synopsis] r13483 - doc/trunk/design/syn</a> </i> </p>
<p>In this patch, Larry Wall distinguished Set and Bag values from KeySet
and KeyBag containers, which made several people rather happy.</p>

<p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/2e0237a2f68f1e16/ba58140447857b21?#ba58140447857b21">Interrogating closures</a> </i> </p>
<p>Yuval Kogman wrote in praise of the partial unification of objects
and code references, and closures in general.  He proposed allowing
closures to declare that captured variables are an instance, and
provided a code example.  The purpose would be to give the option of
inspecting what a closure is encapsulating.</p>

<p>Larry Wall replied that he would look for a declarative solution rather
than a callback, which would mean the closure could have a declarator
which explicitly captures a lexical and makes it available as an attribute.
Yuval responded that the <code>have</code> syntax proposed by Larry looked nice.</p>

which implements the first version of file extensions for Tcl.</p>

<p>This thread was started by Bob Roger's proposal for dynamic binding.
He compared two options, and later gave an analysis of a third (STM)
at Leopold Toetsch's request.</p>

<p>This week, Allison Randal responded to the proposal with the question of
why dynamic binding should only apply to globals.  She stated that
the proposed implementation was not being approved, but noted that one
of Bob's ideas concerning threads was of particular interest and likely
to be included at some point.  Bob replied in depth to the points she
raised and asked if he could improve the proposal or if he should give
it up.</p>

up portions of the MMD system.  chromatic replied that the patch worked
for him.</p>

<p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/4663c92e182667f6/5c7f0daed7a9e7e9?#5c7f0daed7a9e7e9">[perl #40990] [BUG] Parrot segfaults in perl6 08-regex.t (GC/pointer bug?) </a> </i> </p>
<p>Patrick R. Michaud reported a segfault in ticket <a href="http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=40990">[perl #40990]</a>.
The problem appears in r15837 and happens when the -G flag is not
present.  Later he reported a second problem as ticket <a href="http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=41035">[perl #41035]</a>.</p>

<p>Allison Randal proposed the name 'Partridge' for the PAST-pm compiler
tool chain.  Jonathan Worthington poetically agreed with the name.</p>

<p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/903cc604a66b3c8b/7dcae2e4bebedbbd?#7dcae2e4bebedbbd">[perl #40991] [PATCH] PAST-pm: Unnecessary dummy &#39;root&#39; rule in POST transformation </a> </i> </p>
<p>Allison Randal submitted a patch which removes a dummy 'root' rule
from PAST.pm's transformation grammar.  It was ticket <a href="http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=40991">[perl #40991]</a>.</p>

<p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/9ea7288dbf2ccf6f/1f82b5d4c00129b5?#1f82b5d4c00129b5">Initial feedback on PAST-pm, or Partridge</a> </i> </p>
<p>Allison Randal initiated a discussion on Partridge (PAST-pm) with a post
of her comments on user experience and implementation.</p>

<p>Patrick R. Michaud noted that Partridge should not be considered complete,
so many of the missing items Allison noted are things which simply haven't
been implemented yet.  He also added a more detailed response to her specific
points.</p>

<p>Several sub-threads developed.  One involved the standardization of
compiler tools, for example the question of whether each language
subclass of HLLCompiler should override the <code>compile</code> method.  Some
changes were committed as r15882, which Allison liked.  She added a
patch to keep strict boundaries and makes it possible to override the
grammar.  There was a discussion on giving each stage a compiler, which
both Patrick and Allison wanted.  However, Allison wanted each stage to
act independently, with only the HLLCompiler controlling the order
of the steps.</p>

<p>In another sub-thread, Allison responded to comments concerning types,
layers of abstraction and tracking information as part of the compilation
process.  She was quite satisfied with the work which has been done so
far, but had a few more thoughts.</p>

<p>Another response dealt with the remaining points.  Leopold Toetsch
also joined in, noting that the discussion of Parrot limitations
related to :init methods had come up previously.</p>

<p>Finally, Patrick asked which constructs in Punie weren't working yet.
Allison responded, and Patrick replied that he was going to be refactoring
the HLLCompiler soon.</p>

<p>Nikolay Ananiev reported that if the build directory contains spaces the build
process fails.  A patch was submitted as ticket <a href="http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=40998">[perl #40998]</a>.
Ron Blaschke proposed escaping or quoting the paths instead.
Nikolay Ananiev replied that quotes would require refactoring some of
the scripts in the build tree.  He submitted a revised patch which only
adds a short path if a space exists.</p>

<p>In ticket <a href="http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=40999">[perl #40999]</a>, Bob Wilkinson reported that the latest version
of Parrot did not pass make test.  He included the errors.
Patrick R. Michaud gave some suggestions on how to fix the problem, which
may be related to an earlier installation of Parrot.</p>

<p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/19d2f5329b756f2d/062ff39c1bbe82f9?#062ff39c1bbe82f9">[perl #41000] Can&#39;t compile simple parrot example with latest stable parrot </a> </i> </p>
<p>Bob Wilkinson reported that he could not compile an example with the
latest stable Parrot.  This was noted in ticket <a href="http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=41000">[perl #41000]</a>.
Patrick R. Michaud replied that he thought the example was out-of-date.
Matt Diephouse agreed that the example needed to be updated.
This was made into a cage task and fixed.</p>

<p>Matt Diephouse created ticket <a href="http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=41014">[perl #41014]</a> to address bug ticket
<a href="http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=40968">[perl #40968]</a>.  He decided to match native types using their autoboxed
PMC types rather than change <code>_</code> to mean any PMC in a :multi signature.</p>

<p>Leopold Toetsch replied that he felt that this was not the best choice
because it prevented native type optimizations.  Patrick R. Michaud agreed
with Leopold, but felt that in the short term the patch was better than
the current situation.  There was some discussion concerning an example
of how this would be a problem.</p>

<p>The issue was resolved with r15910.</p>

<p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/7427e4c9676c7215/06425a44d034462b?#06425a44d034462b">Interesting post on concurrency models</a> </i> </p>

<p>In ticket <a href="http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=41020">[perl #41020]</a>, James Keenan supplied a patch to make

failures on Darwin.  Steve Peters reported that one of the problems had <br>
been fixed in r40818.</p>

<p>This week, James noted that the problem persists.  Andy Bach suggested
that the problem might have to do with the compiler version.
chromatic found it odd that Configure is using g++ as the linker and
cc as the compiler.  Nicholas Clark replied that this was due to ICU.</p>
