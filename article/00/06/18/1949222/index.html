<h2>Modules and Maintenance</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Maclir/">Maclir</a> on 2000-06-19T01:34:13</h3>
Some very good points raised.  One thing I have discovered, not just with Perl, but *ix in general, is because there is no "central controlling" authority, anyone who thinks they can produce a useful tool does. And just like anyone these days can produce their own web pages, sadly, many do - and that is why there is so much dross on the web. Likewise with software products in the open source arena.<p>
Now, how many different (and overlapping) modules / tools / utilities are there for doing CGI "stuff" with perl?  What one do I choose to implement a large corporate site? I suspect that there are several good tools (or modules) - remembering "TIMTOWTDI".  But, there is a lot of overlap, and the development effort that could be put into creating new (but needed) functionality is expended in making the overlap even greater.
</p><p>This duplication in effort is one of the downsides of the open / free software process - and not identifited in the "Cathedral and the Bazaar" paper.
</p><p>Not sure how well the culture of the open source development community would survive a transition to a more rigidly controlled environment.

Well we already seem to be hitting articles with this. Although they did not give a link or details how to do it

Is that good or bad?

<h2>The adjective &quot;unixish&quot;...</h2>

...must die before some "journalist" gets a hold of it and starts using it as a collective adjective to describe Unix systems.<p>

Quit beating around the bush and call them Unix systems, or Unix or something.  Yeah, the name "Unix" is owned by someone else.  Ack! Pttth!  If you're not slapping the name "Unix" on something you're selling, don't sweat it.</p><p>

If it walks like a duck, sounds like a duck...</p>

Yeah, but Rich is an Old School Unix user.  He has trouble calling Linux "Unix", "unix", or "UNIX".  I can't say I blame him.
<br>
<br>My favorite is the ORA survey I recently took that asked which platforms I used, and I think the three "Unixish" choices were Unix, Linux, and Solaris.

I understand your problem with "Unixish".  It's
not my favorite neologism, either, but I needed <i>something</i>.  Unfortunately, there <b>is</b> no collective adjective or noun that is commonly accepted.<br/><br/>BTW, I heard about a Linux vendor who used the
assertion that "Linux is a UNIX-like operating system" in their literature. They shortly got a threatening letter from the Open Group!  So, they decided to say that "UNIX is a Linux-like operating system" (:-).<br/><br/>In any case, even this "journalist" is open to suggestions...

I believe they got their information from use.perl and didn't list a link to it due to the comments made about it being a premature announcement . It's good press even so.
<br>
<br>A link to the front page would have been good though most of the referring sites are cpan.org and perl.com. And the most popular search engine query is 'CPAN'<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

Meta does not presume a "more rigidly controlled  environment", any more than (for example) the FreeBSD Ports Collection does.  It simply provides a way to bring together existing information
and (I hope) add new information.

<p> If Meta becomes a "Category Killer" (like GCC),
some implicit control would be involved, but I
think we have time to deal with that issue (:-)
before it becomes annoying.

</p><p>FYI, I have had a number of interesting comments
on the paper and have made quite a few additions
and changes.  If you haven't looked at a recent
draft, please do so!</p>
