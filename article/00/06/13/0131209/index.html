<p>I had never seen this before, but it was mentioned on the <a href="http://boston.pm.org/">Boston Perl Mongers</a> list.  It is another Win32 perl distribution from a company called <a href="http://www.dynamicstate.com/">DynamicState</a>, and it is called <a href="http://www.dynamicstate.com/dynamicperl.html">DynamicPerl</a>.  It, too, is based on perl 5.6.0, and it comes with an "integrated Apache webserver."

<p>I don't use Windows (I only ever use it to try to make sure something works with <a href="http://www.activestate.com/">ActiveState</a>'s <a href="http://www.activestate.com/Products/ActivePerl/">ActivePerl</a>, or to try to play with the latest Windows virus), but some of you may find this interesting.

</p><p>P.S.  Am I the only one who sees a similarity in the above company and product names?</p></p>

<h2>Hm</h2>

Maybe I'll try to install DynamicPerl in addition to ActivePerl on my test box (which is actually just VirtualPC on my PowerBook).  Can the two peacefully coexist?

Apparently, this is the company that makes Perl2Exe.  Used to be Mercury Systems (demobuilder.com).  The old URL for that points now to dynamicstate.com.  They have the same mailing address and contact info.  dynamicstate.com was created in November 1999.



<h2>It has some nice &quot;one ups&quot; on ActivePerl,</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/fozbaca/">fozbaca</a> on 2000-06-13T15:15:28</h3>
a web browser based package installation for one. There is not a nice InstallShield or WindowsInstaller type installer, you unzip to the desired directory and run a<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.bat file. The PerlConsole doesn't work for me, not sure why but I am running Win98, and the package instalation didn't work til I kicked off Apache myself and hacked the url path. All in all a very nice one up so far.



<h2>No accident</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/indigo/">indigo</a> on 2000-06-13T21:20:00</h3>
The similarity of names is no accident.  There are those who are concerned ActiveState is a little to close to Microsoft, fearing the embrace, extend, exterminate philosophy MS has employed in the past with C++ and Java.<br/><br/>Looking at their website, it would appear DynamicState wishes to provide a Win32 Perl alternative free from reliance on particular
Windows features, like InstallShield or the
registry.



<h2>Competition good.</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jhi/">jhi</a> on 2000-06-13T21:55:22</h3>
I now added DynamicPerl to the CPAN ports page Win32 section.



<h2>Re:Competition good.</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/pudge/">pudge</a> on 2000-06-13T22:00:24</h3>
But this is _Windows_, where competition doesn't exist.

I noticed that in his description of the Graphical Package Manager, he accidentally writes "VPM" instead of "GPM" once.

Indy is a member of Toronto Perl Mongers, the author of perl2exe.  He is a knowledgeable and pleasant person.<br/><br/>I haven't used any Windows perl (that was not a complaint<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-), so I'm not about to compare the various incarnations.

Ah, cool, a fellow Monger.  If I had the time, I would play with DynamicPerl on Virtual PC.  But I am too busy working with MacPerl 5.6<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-).

"The PerlConsole doesn't work for me, not sure why but I am running Win98, and the package    instalation didn't work til I kicked off Apache myself and hacked the url path."
<br>
<br>Me too. I kinda like it. It looks to me that it responds a lot faster than ActivePerl when starting up a script. The fact that the interpreter is a DLL and "perl.exe" itself only 5k, may make a difference. Run two scripts at once and the interpreter ought to be shared between them! Neat!
<br>
<br>How is the PerlConsole supposed to work? The docs are very spartan. It does nothing. Well... I launched it, and immediately pressed Ctrl-Alt-Del, and yes: Apache is up and running. But no browser is launched, and after a few seconds, Apache just quits.
<br>
<br>Start up Apache yourself, and then point your browser to &lt;http://localhost/html/index.html&gt;, and you've got the server running, including the search script.
