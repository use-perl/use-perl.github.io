<p><a href="mailto:perl@solutionsoft.com">Marty Ford</a> writes <i>We would like to invite everyone here try a pre-release copy of Perl Builder 2.0 for Linux.

</i><p><i>Perl Builder offers a complete IDE for Perl, including a powerful programmer's editor integrated with a visual debugger, as well as a number of other tools.

</i></p><p><i>The software can be downloaded now at: <a href="http://www.solutionsoft.com/pb2_linux.htm">http://www.solutionsoft.com/pb2_linux.htm</a>

</i></p><p><i>Please send any Feedback and bug reports to <a href="mailto:perl@solutionsoft.com">perl@solutionsoft.com</a>.</i></p></p>
<p><p><i>Perl Builder 2.0 is a major upgrade with a completely re-implemented editor and debugger. Version 2.0 overcomes most of the limitations of version 1.0 (which was available only on Windows) and adds dozens of new features and refinements.</i></p>

<p>New Features in Perl Bulder 2.0 - Linux</p>


<ul> <li>Completely redesigned editing environment with a powerful and robust programmer's editor
<ul>

<li> Unlimited Undo/Redo Levels.</li>
<li> Improved performance/speed.</li>
<li> Improved syntax highlighting allows use of bold and italic text as well as colors.</li>
<li> Find All and Highlight Feature.</li>
<li> Control over background colors.</li>
<li> Individual control over editor function keyboard assignments.</li> <li> Glitches in display, scrolling, etc. which some V 1.0 users
experienced have been eliminated.</li>
<li> Copy highlighted text as formatted HTML or RTF and paste into other applications in color.</li>
<li> Code templates let you save snippets of frequently used code and insert with a hotkey or menu selection.</li>
<li> AutoReplace/AutoCorrect lets you specifiy strings so that the editor automatically corrects errors or replaces      abbreviations with the full text. For example, you can set up one or two character
abbreviations for common Perl  constructs and have the editor expand them automatically.</li>
<li> Mouse-over bracket matching. Just hold the mouse over a bracket {} to highlight its partner.</li>

</ul> </li> <li>
Improved Navigation and Online Help
<ul>

<li> Subroutine navigator lets you easily jump to any subroutine in the current module.</li>
<li> Improved bookmark system.</li>
<li> Context sensitive help on core Perl functons--just click on a function name in your code and press F1 to get help.</li>

</ul> </li> <li>
New Debugging Engine
<ul>

<li> Faster and higher fidelity.</li>
<li> Includes all standard debugging features, including tooltip variable inspection, watches, evaluate/modify, step,  breakpoints, etc.</li> <li> Open multiple scripts in the IDE and select the active script for debugging.</li>  <li> Enhanced support for debugging "daisy chained" scripts--where output from a script calls the same or another  script.</li>
<li> New Dump feature lets you view complex/nested data.</li>
<li> Pause/Reset buttons let you stop run-away scripts/infinite loops.</li> <li> Specify execution directory for scripts.</li>
<li> Customizable HTML color syntax highlighting in the Output window.</li>

</ul> </li> <li>
Improved CGI Wizard
<ul>

<li> Enhanced validation options.</li>
<li> Support for saving data in a text file on the server.</li>
</ul></li> </ul></p>

<h2>Wine ??</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Beatnik/">Beatnik</a> on 2000-06-27T18:57:45</h3>
So what's the difference between the windows and the Linux version anyway? I mean, besides the fact that there is a Wine included in the Linux version.



<h2>Re:Wine ??</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jns/">jns</a> on 2000-06-28T08:48:41</h3>
I dont think that an adequate explanation was given when he posted to comp.lang.perl.misc<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...



<h2>Re:Wine ??</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/pudge/">pudge</a> on 2000-06-28T15:55:21</h3>
You mean, you think that this is just a PerlBuilder to run on top of Wine?  Well, from the <a href="http://www.solutionsoft.com/pblinux.jpg" title="solutionsoft.com">screen shot</a solutionsoft.com> it doesn't appear so to me.



<h2>Questionable Perl setup scripts</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/torin/">torin</a> on 2000-06-28T23:33:24</h3>
<p>I wonder about a Perl IDE and debugger that includes statements like <tt>read(FILE, $buf, 20000);<tt> when trying to read the entire file in  (rather than just the first 20000 bytes).  They also don't check any of their system calls such as open, write, close, mkdir,<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...</tt></tt></p>

<p>Just because I had 5 spare minutes, I cleaned up their script and put it at <a href="http://sig.biostr.washington.edu/user/darren/hold/winesetup.pl" title="washington.edu">&lt;URL:http://sig.biostr.was    hington.edu/user/darren/hold/winesetup.pl&gt;</a washington.edu>.

</p><p>WINE didn't work by default on my debian system and since I expect that to take more than five minutes, I didn't bother to go further.</p>

<p> <i>You mean, you think that this is just a PerlBuilder to run on top of Wine?</i> </p> <p>Thats precisely what I mean - see <a href="http://x51.deja.com/%5BST_rn=ps%5D/getdoc.xp?AN=636824537&amp;search=thread&amp;CONTEXT=962268360.1539506224&amp;HIT_CONTEXT=962268360.1539506224&amp;HIT_NUM=3&amp;hitnum=3" title="deja.com">this post</a deja.com> at <a href="http://www.deja.com/" title="deja.com">Deja News</a deja.com> - it is also noted that no response was made with respect to my comments on the post.</p> <p> <i> Well, from the screen shot it doesn't appear so to me.</i> </p> <p>Thats just the window manager decoration that is making it look different isnt it ? I would be interested to see a screen shot with a window manager that was deliberateley like Windows 95</p> <p>Another point I might as well make here is that this product is totally useless for Sparc, PPC, ARM, Alpha, S390 etc Linux Users.</p> <p>/J\</p>

I assume you haven't actually checked it ?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
<br>The last time I checked Windows Apps + Wine ne Linux Apps... mmm this should be on Ask<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)



<h2>Re:Wine ??</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/pudge/">pudge</a> on 2000-06-29T15:02:30</h3>
Of course not.  I don't use an inferior windowing system like X or Windows.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)



<h2>Re:Wine ??</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Beatnik/">Beatnik</a> on 2000-06-29T15:29:00</h3>
Well, if you ever do, I can recommend CodeCommander as code editor. It has nice syntax coloring and build/compile features. Most importantly, it doesn't  have buggy wizards and stuff<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)



<h2>What Point is an IDE for Perl anyway ?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jns/">jns</a> on 2000-06-29T15:44:25</h3>
Thats fine.  After all with all the tools available at the command line who needs it<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...
<br>

<h2>Re:What Point is an IDE for Perl anyway ?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/pudge/">pudge</a> on 2000-06-29T19:50:36</h3>
My IDE is my OS, no matter which OS I am using.  My primary OS is Mac OS, where I string together all sorts of different tools.  BBEdit, MacPerl, Shuck, MPW/ToolServer, MacSQL Monitor, AppleScript and MacPerl custom scripts, etc.  On Unix, it is the shell and all the other tools in it.
<br>
<br>Of course, in a GUI OS one is usually more reliant on large apps.  For me, it is BBEdit.  But if someone wants to stick to a single IDE for most things, well, good luck to 'em.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)



<h2>What the hell does this thing?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Abigail/">Abigail</a> on 2000-07-02T08:19:53</h3>
Looking over the set of features, it doesn't do anything significant that a modern vi-clone either gives you directly, or with minimal macro-programming. However, this thing wants to have a 200 MHz processor, while vi-clones can do with way, way less.
<p>
What the hell is it doing? Or is it incredibly badly programmed? (Since it comes as a binary, they probably have some bad code to hide).

<h2>Re:What the hell does this thing?</h2>

Well, it requires wine; that's probably the majority of it right there.
