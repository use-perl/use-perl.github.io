<p>Well, Day Three has come and gone, along with Days Four through Six.  For those of you waiting with baited breath for the round of Day Three of <a href="http://www.yapc.org/America/">yapc 19100</a>, I apologize for having a life and not getting to it until now.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>
<p>The day started off without fanfare, diving straight into the sessions.  I was fortunate to attend Elaine Ashton's talk on Perl History and Brad Murray's Tool Teams talk, and was just hanging out after that and completely forgot about Kevin Lenzo's Yet Another Society discussion.  Sigh.  I did, however, join a whole lot of other folks jammed into Rangos III for the <a href="http://www.plover.com/user/mjd/perl/talks-2000.html">Lightning Talks</a>, hosted by Mark-Jason Dominus (some of the talks are now <a href="http://www.plover.com/user/mjd/perl/talks-2000.html">online</a>).  The Lightning Talks were capped off with Nat Torkington's humorous rant about Python (which is not featured on his <a href="http://prometheus.frii.com/user/gnat/yapc/">YAPC talks</a> page).

<p>Following a break, we all retired to the auditorium for Jon Orwant's second installment of The Apocalypse.  I won't give away the end, since the talk will be presented once again at <a>TPC 4</a>, but suffice it to say that just because as Perl programmers we survived The Apocalypse, that doesn't mean we're all OK.

</p><p>Following Orwant's talk, we had a short closing meeting, where we gave Kevin Lenzo the thanks he deserves (or attempted to, anyway) and discussed yapc present and future.  Some want to have more than one yapc a year in North America, perhaps splitting it up into east and west versions (it is a wide continent, after all).  Lenzo noted that the generous yapc sponsors helped cover all the costs the registration fees didn't cover.  yapc might be in a different place next year, but most agreed that wherever it was, we would need wireless networking.  Once you go that way, you can't really go back.  Well you can, but it would suck.

</p><p>Bunches of us went to play some paintball downtown.  I'd like to recommend paintball as a way to take out the aggressions we normally use mailing lists and usenet as an outlet for.</p></p>
