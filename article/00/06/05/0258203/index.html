Nice scripts, but...
<br>
<br>Scripts sit uneasily between modules and applications. A script is very rarely something that is very useful unmodified - and if it is to be used as the basis for a new work, then it would be better to start with a package or module that was designed with re-use in mind.
<br>
<br>That's not to say scripts shouldn't be made publicly available. The ideal would be, perhaps for Roth Consulting to amalgamate all their scripts into Win32::Utilities or something, but that obviously takes time and effort on their part. Meanwhile making the raw scripts available does help someone.
<br>
<br>However, I think 90% of people with a need for this stuff either want it filled by an application that requires no modification (because the user is a non-programmer, for instance), or they want it filled by a nice module (because they _are_ a programmer).
<br>
<br>So, I don't think anyone should be too dismayed that script archives don't take off in the way module archives and applications do. However, I'm happy to see scripts available, as I dip in from time to time.
<br>

<p> <i>I think 90% of people with a need for this stuff either want it filled by an application that requires no modification.</i> </p> <p>But it does appear that what is entirely lacking is a showcase for Perl <strong>applications</strong>.  I seem to recall a discussion somewhere else about have a 'Camel-meat' site where people could post announcements of their applications - unfortunately I cant remember where that discussion was - the advocacy mailing list perhaps ?</p>

I'm glad you liked the scripts.<p>
I subscribe to the Perl-NTAdmins listserver, and serveral subscribers have found the scripts to be useful.  In fact, some of the scripts were spawned from stated needs and desires.</p><p>

Ture, ture. I'd love to see more Perl apps, as well as modules. An excellent example of what I'm thinking about [WARNING: Blither mode ahead!] is the Rezrov module, which allows you to play Infocom games, like Zork. Not only is all the code Perl-only (so you don't have to beat on a compliler, making it HIGHLY portable), but he has modules for just about every interface you can think of, from bland ASCII text to Tk.
<br>Best of all, you can call it w/o writing your own program to build an interface! So it's an application that you can run in and of itself, and a module that you can incorporate into you own programs. For example, imagine running Chat::Eliza with this...Ugk! Or hooking it to the IRC module, allowing people in a channel to play the game if they so wish.
<br>There are other modules/applications like this (CPAN, which I simply cannot get to work properly on my WinNT box, even w/Cygwin *UGH*), but we should defintily encourage them. I think, esp. with the new Mozilla connections and editors, we could see an influx of Perl dev folks, and uses for Perl. It would be nice to point them to these simple examples, and let them have at it.
<br>Perl will never be simple -- but it doesn't have to be difficult.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
<br>Comments?

I agree...I'd like to see more modules for Win32.
I use Win32::Lanman, and Dave Roth's modules all
the time.<br/><br/>Right now, I'm trying to write a raw IP generator
script (which I plan to grow into a module) that
uses eEye Security's new LibnetNT.dll.  Unfortun-
ately, I'm not a very experienced C or Windows
coder...so I'm having some problems.  It also
doesn't help that I've already run into one area that was poorly undocumented.<br/><br/>Anyway, that's where I'm trying to go...it's a
little discouraging so far, but not so much that
I'm ready to quit...what I'd eventually like to
see is a Win32 port of nmap...either as an<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.exe
or as a Perl script...<br/><br/>Carv
