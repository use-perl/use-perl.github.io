<p>Thanks to all of you who have thus far helped turn this site into a cool little place.  I am going to be working on the site regularly, and it would help if you all gave your suggestions as to what changes and additions you'd like to see, what you like and don't want changed, etc.

<p>I could also use a little bit of help.  Citizen X helped me with the <a href="/quotes.txt">quotes file</a>.  I also could use more better <a href="/topics.shtml">topics</a> icons, and any FAQ questions / answers you can think of (and maybe someone to compile them for me in plain text).

</p><p>Also, if you have bug reports or patches for the <a href="http://slashcode.com/">Slash</a> code itself, it is probably best if you sign up for <a href="http://sourceforge.net/">SourceForge</a> and use the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/?group_id=4421">SourceForge Slash site</a>.</p></p>

<h2>How about an &quot;Ask use Perl;&quot; section?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/graz/">graz</a> on 2000-06-02T13:12:20</h3>
<p>Seeing as this is running slashcode I expected to find a "Ask <strong>use Perl;</strong>" section, just like the question and answer part of <a href="http://slashdot.org/" title="slashdot.org">Slashdot</a slashdot.org>. Maybe it's on here already (in which case I just can't find it).</p>

<p>I know there's <a href="http://www.perlmonks.org/" title="perlmonks.org">Perl Monks</a perlmonks.org> already, but I think <strong>use Perl;</strong> would be a good place for it.</p>

There is one.  Go to Submit Story.  Click on the Sections popup.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

Damn. So just one more stupid question - why isn't there a "Ask <strong>use Perl;</strong>" slashbox checkbox on the user preferences page? (like there is on Slashdot)

<h3><a href="/user/pudge/">pudge</a> on 2000-06-02T14:27:03</h3>
Well, because right now there is no need for one.  If that section ever becomes well used, then I would add the box.

<p>Note that this site is primarily about issues, not specific code thingys.  Code thingys are not off-limits, but this certainly won't be a place for anything like what you get on Perl Monks or clpm, where people ask "how do I do {faq}?" or "check out this program I wrote."  There are hundreds of such forums out there for that kind of thing, and I don't think the community here would be interested in it.

</p><p>That said, we will not shy away from something interesting just because it is code.  Code is, after all, what we are all here in regard to.  I guess we'll just let the community decide over time what this site will be, but it probably won't be a real code-based forum.  I kinda think of it more as something like Slashdot meets perl5-porters: a place to read about and discuss issues and news and items of interest related to Perl.

</p><p>If there is some really interesting code or code question -- such as a weird bug or confusion about a new feature like our() -- then that seems to fit right in.

</p><p>Maybe this is all what you had in mind, too.  Maybe you want lots of code, I dunno.  We'll kindof have to wait and see on some of it, I guess.</p>

<p> <em>Maybe this is all what you had in mind, too. Maybe you want lots of code, I dunno.</em> </p>

<p>I was thinking of things along the lines of "What are the best modules to use if I want to pull a page off a web server via SSL?".</p>

<p> <em>Maybe you want lots of code, I dunno.</em> </p>

<p>No thanks - I've got more than enough code to worry about already...<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

Maybe you could ask in a <a href="news:comp.lang.perl.misc" title="perl.misc">newsgroup</a perl.misc> - or <b>heaven forfend</b> use <a href="http://search.cpan.org/" title="cpan.org">The CPAN search engine</a cpan.org> or <a href="http://www.deja.com/home_ps.shtml" title="deja.com">Deja News</a deja.com>.</p>

<p>Expertise is spread pretty thin already as it is - I dont think I would be answering any technical questions here.</p>

And I think most people here feel the same as you.  There are plenty of forums for such basic questions.  Like I said, we would not exclude something just because it is code-based if it is really interesting, but I think most questions like that are just not interesting to the people on this site.  I could be wrong<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...
