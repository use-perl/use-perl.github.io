<p><a href="mailto:tereschenko@bigfoot.com">tereschenko</a> writes <i>"A group of Russian programmers lead by Alexander S. Tereschenko (that's me) announced that it will going to translate most of free available document about Perl into Russian, plus plans to open first Russian Perl training in September 2000.<br>
<br>
 The only problem is that we are cannot contact anyone at Perl.com, O`REILLY or PerlPorters, bacause of our mails recognized as "spam domains". <br>
<br>
Hope this message will help, because we need to discuss some important question about licensing, copyrights and Perl sources. <br>
<br>
Thank you.
Sincerely your, Alexander S. Tereschenko

<p>I normally wouldn't post personal ads here, but I think the topic of translation is interesting.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p></p>

Are you referring to the RBL? What is your domain? Why is it listed? What is the administrator's address? This would help... you could get readers to politely email him and ask him to disable relaying or whatever the problem is.

<p>
Actually I would suggest that the problem is the free account - a lot of people block those simply because people use the throwaway accounts to spam from<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... </p>

<p>
Wouldnt it be be better to contact the authors of the documentation in question directly - much of the stuff in the distribution is copyright of the author and much of it has a notice which would indicate the terms under which it can be used</p> <p>I would guess that anything that doesnt have an explicit copyright statement is covered by the licenses that apply to Perl.</p>

I've tried a lot of domains, including domain of Russian goverment! (gov.ru)
My mail is: tereschenko@bigfoot.com (it is just redirect so it cannot be real spam domain).



<h2>Clarification</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/tereschenko/">tereschenko</a> on 2000-06-03T19:09:34</h3>
servers used:
bigfoot.com (my usual)
gov.ru
itsoft.ru
mitme.ru
hotmail.com
chat.ru
mail.ru



<h2>F.....g s...t! Bad joke?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/tereschenko/">tereschenko</a> on 2000-06-04T10:20:33</h3>
Found mail domain that is not recognized as spam, but they don't accept MIME mail!!!!!!!! (the only type of mail, that can be sent)



<h2>Question</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Alex Farber/">Alex Farber</a> on 2000-06-04T17:59:14</h3>
So how much of the docs has been translated so far?



<h2>Re:Question</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/tereschenko/">tereschenko</a> on 2000-06-04T19:25:45</h3>
Some of the FAQs, perlfunc (35-40%), some small parts. Most work will be dome in July 2k.

<p> <i>My mail is: tereschenko@bigfoot.com (it is just redirect so it cannot be real spam domain).
</i> </p>
<p>The thing is that some spam filters use the From: address rather than the envelope from address and so if you have an address that might be considered a source of spam it will be filtered irrespective of where you actually sent the mail from.</p>
<p>Of course people use a whole variety of methods for stomping spam - the RBL as referred to before or DUL both of which can be read about at <a href="http://www.mail-abuse.org/" title="mail-abuse.org">http://www.mail-abuse.org</a mail-abuse.org>.  You might also see <a href="http://www.perl.com/pub/2000/03/spam3.html" title="perl.com">Mark-Jason Dominus' Article</a perl.com> which describes other methods that people use to trap spam.</p>

This is amazing! I just found this post in Google and I can't believe that 6 years later it still exists!<br><br>Back in 2000 I was that "tereschenko" guy, and since that post I:<br>1. learned that correct way to spell my name in English is TeresHchenko<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)<br>2. quit "Perl in Russia" project<br>3. stopped using Perl (haven't wrote a line of Perl code in 5 years!)<br>4. moved from Russia to Germany, and then from Germany to the UK<br><br>I was like a completely different person back then. And that project was so stupid and optimistic - I mean, my English was very basic and in reality the whole project had only two guys behind it: me and one fellow student. We couldn't do much.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)
