<h2>Re: the Python talk</h2>

I do want to make it quite clear that while the
title of the Python talk is quite obnoxious, it is only a
joke.  Not all Python people are assholes, not
all Perl people are assholes either.  My talk
is more of a rant, directed against the Python
advocates who embody the worst attributes of
Jehovah's Witnesses and Mormons, nagging and
arguing beyond the call of sanity, that Python
is the One True Holy Language.  I have nothing
against people who choose to use Python and
don't feel that that means the rest of the world should too.<p>

The point of my advocacy talk is that you can
advocate a language (Perl as well as Python)
without being an idiot about it.  The point
of the Python talk is to let me vent in a safe
controlled environment, and hopefully amuse
others.</p><p>

So if you do turn up to the talk, do expect it
to be funny, and do expect it to be honest.
Also expect it to contain some naughty words
(like "whitespace<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p><p>

Ah, so it's a talk about how some Python advocates are crossing the line and starting to sound like Tom Christensen?<nobr> <wbr></nobr><tt>;-)</tt>

<p>What would be useful is aiming it more toward potential advocates and saying, "here's how to advocate without alienating." One of the best ways to do this is to take the attitude that the right tool for the job is the best tool for the job, nothing more, nothing less. There are times when the right tool for the job is a language that you may not care for, or which may have serious failings, but that shouldn't matter if it's the best tool.

</p><p>Good luck with the talk.<br></p>
