<p>Heh.  It is a shortcut for "All The Perl That's Practical to Extract and Report."  You might recall stuff like "L10N" and "I18N" and consider this short bit of code:

<pre>    s/\b(\w)(\w{4,})(\w)\b/"\u$1" . length($2) . "\u$3"/ge;</pre>

</p><p>The phrase was just too long for a title, so I shortened it.</p></p>

I always tend to dislike these kinds of cyphers.  If you don't know the phrase they represent, or worse, you know the phrase but the context throws you--you're screwed.<p>

A certain organization which is not secretly running the entire world economy (as far as you know) uses these kinds of cyphers to memorize ritual.  Once you've seen the rituals a couple of times the 150+ page cypher books make perfect sense when read straight through.  Still, flipping to a random page it takes a while to get your bearings.</p><p>

Anyways, it's not as if there isn't a tradition of that already.  HTH HAND.</p><p>

This is embarrassing...<br/><br/>"You might recall stuff like "L10N" and "I18N"" ?<br/><br/>Uh, I don't recall ever meeting up with stuff like that.  I'm afraid that I *still* don't understand what the title means.  Can you help me?

Please do not flame my ignorance: I should have said that I do realize what the "cypher" was *supposed* to represent<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.. practical, extract, and report..  I just don't know what L10N and I18N represent, and why one would obfuscate a title. (for fun?)

Localization and internationalization,
the processes where you teach your software to use languages and character sets other than English and ASCII and conventions and
cultures other than American.<br/><br/>English vs German vs Japanese vs Russian vs Chinese; ASCII vs ISO Latin vs Shift-JIS vs KOI8 vs Unicode;1.23 vs 1,23; 26/06 1:23pm vs 06-26 13:23; Letter vs A4; mi vs km; US mailboxes vs something else, etc.

Well, the problem is that, as I said, the full "slogan" was too long for the TITLE.  It made most of my browser titlebars look funny.  So I shortened it.  If you dislike it, you can put a filter in your web proxy to expand it.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)
<br>
<br>&lt;P&gt;Also, I think it is pretty simple to figure out, considering the image at the top of every page that has the full text.

It's somewhat ironic, don't you think that we flame people on #perl and on c.l.p.m. for using 3l337 sp3k but it's used here?

<h2>Obfuscation</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jnolan/">jnolan</a> on 2000-06-27T07:02:59</h3>
<p>
In the case of i18n, the abbreviation makes
sense, once you get used to it.  It's just
too much of a bear to try to type out internationalization.  I can't think of
any other more convenient way to abbreviate
the word.

<p>
B1t h1y, w1y s2p w2h j2t b1g w3s?
W1y n1t a8e a1l w3s?
</p>
<p>
Obfuscation would be o9n.  That one's
almost long enough to be useful.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)

<p>
*grumble*. *mutter*. There are lots of people for whom text as an image means an impossibility to read. Not all the world is a VAX.
