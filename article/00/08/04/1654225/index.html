From Programming Perl 2ed, (and a few other sources, but everyone should have this for comparison):
<blockquote><div>
<i>The use of a camel image in association with the Perl language is a trademark of O'Reilly &amp; Associates, Inc.  Permission may be granted for non-commercial use; please inquire by sending mail to camel@ora.com</i>
</div></blockquote>
I do not pretend to speak for ORA.  But if they really did trademark "Perl", let the conspiracy theories begin!<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

<h3><a href="/user/marc/">marc</a> on 2000-08-05T17:04:54</h3>
From the 3rd edition of Programming Perl:
<p><blockquote><div>
<i>The association between the image of a camel and the Perl language is a trademark of O'Reilly &amp; Associates, Inc.  Permission may be granted for non-commercial use; please inquire by sending mail to <a href="mailto:camel@oreilly.com" title="mailto">camel@oreilly.com</a mailto> </i>
</div></blockquote>
<p>
It seems that quite a few people have asked the same question in the last four years, forcing O'Reilly (and his Associates) to reword the text.
</p><p>
While both state that the <b>association</b> of the two is trademarked, the language from the 2nd edition is somewhat ambiguous.  The <i>real</i> question is, do they only have the trademark for one hump camels (as depicted on the cover), or any n-humped camel?
</p><p>
Bottom line: you can use all the camels you want; and you can use all the Perl you want, but if you use them together, you need to ask permission.
</p><p>
<b>Standard disclaimer:</b> I don't work for ORA either, and could be flat out wrong about this.</p>

Please allow me to explain this error as i was the agent involved in the publishing of this advert and the text with it.<br/><br/> Our advertising company had to call ORA for permission to use the Camel image as you may expect.<br/><br/> Now the Marketing Manager for ORA forwarded the exact text that you have posted in your message to our appointed advertising agency to put under the Camel image on the advertisement. However after looking into this further it transpires that the Marketing Manager at ORA accidently typed the word Perl in twice instead of using "Camel" in the second sentence.<br/><br/> The advertising agency being of a non-techy nature simply printed this text in the form it was sent.<br/><br/>After speaking to ORA we realised what had happened.!!!!! I hope I have set the record straight and my apologies for any confusion caused!!!<br/><br/>Regards<br/><br/>Qudoss
