<h2>I wasn't that impressed</h2>

Wasn't terrible, but I still prefer Perl Builder to it.
<br>
<br>* I didn't like the output display (rendered HTML instead of source code for my cgi test)
<br>* The auto-indent and smart tab features weren't working well.  It didn't auto indent at all, and when closing a brace, it didn't outdent it back to the previous tab stop (as PB does).
<br>* I have no use for the built in ftp functions or web server functions
<br>
<br>I've been using PB for so long that I'm used to that and measure everything against it.  Others may like this program a lot more than I did.  It's cheaper than PB, but my preference is still with PB =)

Hi mark,

did you happen to see the Ctrl-F2 function which changes the output display to source view. <p>

Also you're right about the smart tab feature.  We're currently working on that. </p><p>

As for PB, again you're dead on. PB is the current standard, however, hopefully, visiPerl+ will change that.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;) </p><p>

Cheers!
