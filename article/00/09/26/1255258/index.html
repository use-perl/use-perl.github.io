<p>With the <a href="http://dev.perl.org/rfc/">Perl 6 RFC</a> deadline fast approaching (this Sunday, Oct. 1, is the RFC freeze), we've seen a huge influx of last-minute submissions, with 38 new and 23 updated RFCs posted yesterday.  RFC 300 was one of Simon Cozens' 29 RFCs, titled "<tt>use unicode::representation</tt> and <tt>no unicode</tt>".

<p>Nathan Wiger still leads the pack with 36, and Damian Conway, the hometown favorite at these 2000 Olympics, is just barely in the bronze position with 28, but solidly in medal contention, with twice as many RFCs as the fourth place poster.

</p><p>There's also a brand-new <a href="http://dev.perl.org/lists">mailing list</a>, perl6-internals-unicode.  Its deadline is in two days.

<b>Update: 09/28 05:55 PM</b> by <b> <a href="http://pudge.net/">P</a> </b>: I can't read.  The deadline is Oct. 28, not Sept. 28.

</p><p>Editor's note: in the last update, we noted that Larry Wall would
"vomment" on existing RFCs.  Some took that to be a cross between
"vomit" and "comment."  We are unsure of whether it was a subconscious slip
or a typographical error.  We are also unsure of whether or not to
regret the error.</p></p>

<h2>I vote for 'vommit'</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jjohn/">jjohn</a> on 2000-09-26T16:22:48</h3>
I understand Larry isn't feeling too well these days after the Perl Whirl.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)



<h2>The deadline's not that close...</h2>

The perl6-internals-unicode deadline is Oct 28th, not tomorrow. (Or friday, or whatever) The internals RFC process can go on a tad longer since  there's a bunch of stuff we can't really even start on until we know what Larry wants for the main language layer.



<h2>Re:The deadline's not that close...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/pudge/">pudge</a> on 2000-09-27T10:29:00</h3>
Oh, I was thinking September 28.  Yeesh.  Why is the deadline way after the RFC process is scheduled to close (this Sunday)?



<h2>Re:The deadline's not that close...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Elian/">Elian</a> on 2000-09-27T16:51:14</h3>
Because it's dealing with things on a different level. There's an awful lot of internal-level things that we really can't even spec out (which is what the RFCs are in this arena) until we know the shape of the language. It's silly (and counter-productive) to force all the grotty details to be frozen before the language spec is out.
<p>
Besides, stuff hanging off the -internals tree lies within my perview, and I made an Executive Decision that it's OK.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
</p><p>
More seriously, what I'd like to do is have perl's RFCs, at least from a low-level perspective, mirror the IETF's RFCs. Which is to say as we flesh out new pieces of the guts the RFC will act as documentation, so by the time we're done you'll at least have a chance to figure out the bytecode format, or the syntax tree format, or the vtable stuff. (All of which also need to be hammered out and RFC'd, but can't until Larry's released the Grand Design)</p>



<h2>Taking bets</h2>

Okay, I put $50 on perl6 arriving in production quality code in Q1 2003. Takers?

I think he's pining for the fjords. I know I am. Boy, but Alaska is gorgeous.
