<p>Nathan Torkington has sent us in this great report of life on the road with O'Reilly's <a href="http://conferences.oreilly.com/uperl2k/">University of Perl</a>.<br/><br/><hr><br/><br/>I thought I'd give you a report of life on the road at the
University of Perl.  UoP is a series of tutorials O'Reilly has
organized in Seattle, Los Angeles, Atlanta, and New York.  The
instructors are Mark-Jason Dominus, Damian Conway, Randal Schwartz,
Dan Klein, brian d foy, Michel Rodriguez, and me.  We're in Seattle
now (actually Bellevue) and have just finished the first day of
classes.</p>
<p>I arrived on Saturday, jetlagged to hell from the flight from London.
I got into the hotel around 10pm, decided not to risk waking Damian,
and had a quiet pint in the hotel bar before retiring.  I was trying
the Irish cure for jetlag: a pint of Guinness before bed.  (The Irish
cure for anything is a pint of Guinness, preferably followed by
another.)

<p>

Sunday I mooched around the hotel, watching the O'Reilly folks set up
the rooms and pack bags.  In the evening we had a speaker dinner at a
very fancy restaurant.  I tell you, taking geeks to a fancy restaurant
is *not* a good idea.  Between Mark-Jason heckling the waitress,
Randal taking pictures of his food, and Dan spouting random factoids
about the names of barrels (!) we definitely brought down the tone
of the place.  The food was excellent, though, and despite having a
traveller's cold, I could definitely identify the steak as perfect.
The restaurant also offered an excellent port after dinner.  Port
wine is one of my vices.

</p><p>

Today (Monday) was the first day of classes.  I was teaching Tom
Christiansen's "Advanced Perl", covering References, Objects, Modules,
Process Management, and a wee bit on locking and Databases.  It's a
huge class, and Tom wasn't able to cover it in six hours at TPC4.  He
had to burst into the break time.  I only went about 15 minutes over
at the end of the day, but knew I'd failed to keep on time when I
heard the applause from Damian Conway's audience in the next room
over.  Damian has a reputation for going horrendously over-time,
trying desperately to stuff as much knowledge as possible into his
students' brains, and it was a great embarrassment for me to finish
after he did.  He even popped his head into my classroom and laughed
at me.

</p><p>

Damian was giving a new class he's written, "Practical Extraction and
Reporting".  It's all about getting data out of files and generating
fancy reports.  He talks about the nasty ways your data could be
packaged (uuencoding, MIME, gzip) and how to pull out just the data
you want (regexps, parsers, etc).  It's a monster course, playing to
all of Perl's strengths, and went down well.  We mustn't have marketed
it well, though, because he didn't get many people in it.  Still, I
can't think of a better way to spend a day than having Damian teach.
Tomorrow he's doing his Object-Oriented Perl class, which has a much
higher signup.  I even had one of my students threaten to bail on my
mod_perl class and defect to the Way of the Damian (all power to him!).

</p><p>

brian d foy gave his "Perl 101", which has the best attendance of all
the classes.  It's a two day Introduction to Perl, and apparently
that's what people have been jonesing for.  He said it all seemed to
go well.  Dan Klein also seemed happy with his "Practical Website
Maintenance" tutorial.  I ran into him at one of the breaks and asked
him whether he was running short or long, and he said "I never know
until I have 20 minutes to go".  Fair enough.  I try to guess how
on-time I am based on the number of slides, but given that some
sections are dense (lots of explanation required for each slide:
hello, references!) while some are very frothy (hello, SQL!) anything
based on slide count isn't really accurate.  MjD wasn't teaching
today, and I didn't see him at all.  Michel arrived from France last
night and periodically wandered through the tutorial signup area
looking disgustingly chipper.

</p><p>

Brian, Amelia (the Perlmongers retail queen), Damian, Michel, and I
went to a nearby Thai restaurant ("River Kwai") for dinner.  Topics
ranged from movies (universal acclaim for Kevin Spacey) to pot smoking
in Amsterdam.  The food was good, but definitely not up to the
conversation.  There's nothing like spending a relaxed hour or two
with good people just shooting the breeze.  Michel told us the great
name of a Mexican restaurant he'd seen: C.O. Jones. (think about it)

</p><p>

Over lunch, Damian came up with the idea of giving his
Quantum::Superpositions talks, and at 7pm he did that.  Once again,
not many people turned up (possibly because many of the attendees were
local, and driving home and then back again wasn't practical for
them).  I was there, though, and loved it.  The Q::S is so bloody
clever, I picked up things on the second run through that I hadn't
picked up when I heard it first at YAPC.  Damian's just a teaching
monster: "sure, I'd love to teach some more!"  The rest of us were too
exhausted after the first day to do anything (well, except for Randal,
who headed off to Hooters with Bill).  Damian's giving the Perligata
(Latin Perl) talk to the Seattle Perlmongers tomorrow night, so it
might be a while before we get to have a dinner chat together again.

</p><p>

I'm amazed at how many of the O'Reilly staff are here.  I've seen Mark
Jacobsen (who is currently running the conferences group and was
probably here to check it was all going well), Madeline Schnapp (who
manages the Research group, trying to work out what's hot and what's
not), Tim Allwine (who works for Madeline and was asking about large
repositories of historical Usenet records--they want Usenet archives
for groups like comp.lang.perl.misc for the last two years, and the
commercial vendors of such things are apparently asking comically high
prices), and others.  Not all are taking classes, I think they're here
to pick the brains of Seattle's finest (insert obligatory Microsoft
bash here).  Either that or the good weather in Sebastopol got too
much for them and they just *had* to catch some drizzle and clouds.

</p><p>

Tomorrow I have a morning meeting with Mark Jacobsen, with whom I'm
working to put together content for the Open Source Convention next
year.  Then in the afternoon I'm teaching my mod_perl class.  This
will be the first time I've taught the class for real (I did have a
quick run-through in Colorado for a few of my former coworkers to
beta-test the class, but I don't count it as a real presentation).
Sometime before midday tomorrow I have to set up the examples so I can
show them off live.  Right now Damian's going through his slides
fixing filenames of images after moving his presentation.  These are
the exciting lives that we glamorous jetsetting trainers lead<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

</p><p>

Cheers;

</p><p>

Nat</p></p>

<h2>The University (a bit Damian Centric)</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/nmcfarl/">nmcfarl</a> on 2000-10-04T17:31:39</h3>
	As an attendee, I must say that I enjoyed it quite a lot and learned much.  I would heartily endorse spending the money and actually attending when the UOP rolls into the town nearest you.
<br> <br>	I know a number of people who attended the Perl 101 class and they all felt they had learned quite a bit.  I personally attended Damian Conway's OOP session  which was every bit as good as his quite fantastic book.
<br> <br>	I also attended both of his less serious speeches, the one on Quantum::Superpositions(the module is available on <a href="http://cpan.org/modules/by-authors/Damian_Conway/" title="cpan.org">CPAN </a cpan.org>) and Perligata speech at the SPUG. Both did amazing things to perl, Perligata's use of Source Filters to transform perl into a language based on suffixes ($next became a nextum when used as data, nexto as a target) not on word positions, was particularly amazing.  Both speeches made you think seriously about the adaptability of perl.
<br>	<br>At the end of the Perligata speech  (which was much more heavily attended than the Q::S speech) there was a section of Q&amp;A for the collected perl luminaries in which there was a particularly interesting section on the possible directions of, and the need for Perl 6.
<br>	<br>On the whole the UOP's trip through town was pretty darn cool.
