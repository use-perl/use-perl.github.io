<p><a href="http://www.yetanother.org/">Yet Another Society</a>'s Greg McCarroll writes that YAS has a <a href="http://registration.yapc.org/">sponsor page</a> set up where it can take donations to <a href="http://www.yetanother.org/damian/">fund Damian Conway for a year</a>, including new terms about refunds should the target not be met.

<p>YAS also announced that the mystery corporate donor is <a href="http://www.blackstar.co.uk/">Black Star</a>, an online video and DVD retailer and major sponsor of <a href="http://www.yapc.org/Europe/">YAPC::Europe</a> which uses Perl heavily on its site, has pledged up to USD 27,5000 -- half the goal -- in matching funds.  So every dollar you donate is counted twice.</p></p>

hurrah for that...but one question: what do BlackStar hope to get out of this for themselves? Do they have any Public Relations rights included in the agreement?<br/><br/>Maybe I'm getting cynical in my old age, but what's the catch? Or is BlackStar just genuinely out for the common good?

Generally, we class it as "giving something back". Our entire business is pretty much built on open-source (Linux, Apache, Perl, MySQL etc.)
So we've taken some of the money that it <i>would</i> cost us to run this business if we had to pay for this stuff, and put it towards the on-going development thereof.

<p>Mainly, what we hope to get is a better perl. Which is important, as pretty much our entire system in written in it.

</p><p>And, though we don't get any explicity PR rights, hopefully we'll still get some good PR out of it anyway!

<h2>Not tracking Check Donations</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ggoebel/">ggoebel</a> on 2000-10-16T13:08:39</h3>
<p>The sponsership page is only good for credit cards. I've got a check signed and ready for the postman.</p>
<p>I thought Damian Conway mentioned that at this point, having a semi-accurate show of support was more important than cash in the hand. I.e., Yes a credit card charged is cash in the hand, but where are check donations being registered and tracked?</p>
<p>Please modify the CGI submission form to process non-credit card pledges.</p>

good for you. consider Amazon banished from my favourites list<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)
<br>
<br>actually, this is a nice precedent - perhaps someone should have a quick whip around for Tim Berners Lee whilst we're here...
