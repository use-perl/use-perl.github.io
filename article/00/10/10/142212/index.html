<p>Nathan Torkington continues with his daily journal of the <a href="http://conferences.oreilly.com/uperl2k/">University of Perl</a>.<br/><br/><hr><br/><br/>Friday was the last day of the first week of tutorials.  I had the
morning off, so took the opportunity to sleep in after the late night
of conversation over dinner.  There's something about being on the
road, though: no matter how comfy the beds are, they're never as comfy
as your bed at home.  All the trainers agreed with that when we talked
about it over dinner.</p>
<p>Michel's XML class went well, and got him a set of excellent
evaluations.  At Seattle he'd found that half the students were new to
XML, so enjoyed the first half of his class, an introduction to XML.
The other half of the Seattle class had already known the introductory
XML stuff and so were frustrated at the lack of Perl in that first half
of the class.  Michel went back and compressed the introductory XML to
half its former size, and added more XML-and-Perl material.  Result:
lots of happy students.

<p>

That's the great thing about teaching again and again in a row like
this: we can tweak and adjust our classes as we go, learning each time
we teach it.  I found that my mod_perl class went smoother on Friday
than on Tuesday, simply because I was prepared for the questions that
the students would ask.  I ended just a hair late, finally managing to
end before Damian.

</p><p>

Damian and I went for a walk around a different block, this time.  We
actually saw suburban dwellings, right beside the airport.  I had
friends in Wellington, New Zealand, who lived right by the airport,
and I still don't understand how they can do it.  I mean, they are
able to mentally tune it out, but the loud noise surely must take a
toll on your hearing.  We passed a car yard and admired a Mazda Miata.
Damian even knew the model number (MX-6, I think).  He may look like
a mild-mannered Australian academic, but under his hood he too feels
the Need For Speed like the rest of us.

</p><p>

Six of us had dinner, three of the O'Reilly conference folks, and
three of the tutors.  Michel, Damian, and I left early to go to the
Theatresports.  Well, we thought it was early.  Turns out the
Theatresports was in North Hollywood, and I'm guessing the airport is
way south.  We spent over an hour in traffic in that taxi, jerking
along in stop and go traffic.  Damian isn't used to this kind of
driving, and had to take a little walk to clear his head (and soothe
his stomach) when we finally got there.

</p><p>

The Theatresports was excellent!  Wow, I haven't seen that kind of
fast-thinking creativity in ages.  We saw them improvise a 90 minute
Shakespearean play based on ideas from the audience.  The second show
was traditional theatresports, competing teams improvising scenes with
audience help.  Both flabbergasted us.  Michel, Damian, and I enjoyed
it immensely: <a href="http://www.theatresports.com/">www.theatresports.com</a> if you're in (north) LA.

</p><p>

We got back to the hotel after midnight, and poor Damian had to fly
out early the next day.  Saturday I flew home and was *very* glad to
see my family again.  The tutorial crowd next get together in a week's
time for Atlanta and New York.  See you there!

The <a href="http://www.miata.net/" title="miata.net">Miata</a miata.net> is a great car, especially for those of us who feel the "Need For Speed" in a great back-country twisting mountain road!</p>
