<p>Nathan Torkington continues on his daily journal of the <a href="http://conferences.oreilly.com/uperl2k/">University of Perl</a>.<br/><br/><hr><br/><br/>Another day.  This was the first time we've taught the second day's
classes: Mark-Jason gave his Regexes and Tricks of the Wizards
classes, Damian gave his Advanced OO talk, brian d foy finished his
Perl 101 introductory class, Michel gave his XML talk, and I
introduced about 20 people to mod_perl.</p>
<p>I had the morning off, and Mark Jacobsen and I talked about the 2001
Open Source Convention.  It's going to be in San Diego, and the hotel
we'll be at has even more space for us to use.  Not only that, but we
have an extra day: the conference will be for five days.  We're going
to have fewer parallel Perl tracks, but over three days instead of
two.  I took a show of hands at the last conference, and there was
overwhelming support for this.

<p>

We're in San Diego in 2002 as well (being in one place for two years
really helps planning and gets some kickbacks from the hotel too), but
in 2003 they're finally agreeing with me that a move to the middle of
the country or even (gasp) the East Coast is reasonable.  I've been
arguing for it for years, but the conference group has always been
working furiously to get on top of the current conference.  They have
the hang of conferences now, after putting on two of them, so they're
finally able to think ahead and plan things like coastal changes.

</p><p>

Anyway, that was my morning.  After that I sat down to prepare a web
page of my mod_perl examples and discovered that Murphy was alive and
well, and apparently controlling the weather in Fort Collins,
Colorado.  While we were in London last week there was a massive
snowstorm and the snow took out the power, and the PC in my basement
that runs mod_perl didn't turn back on when the power came back.
Finally my wife got back to the house and returned my frantic phone
calls.  By the time 1:15 came around and I had to start my class, I
had my live examples.  Crisis averted.

</p><p>

The class went well.  I had run the notes past Doug MacEachern and
Stas Beckman, two mod_perl luminaries, and it had passed muster.  I'd
given a test-run to my former coworker at an ISP in Fort Collins
before that.  Despite this, I *still* found three or four typos in the
notes.  Well, in some cases I have to admit that I didn't.  Alyssa,
one of my students, handed me a folded note at the end, a list of
typos.  I thought I was done with errata after the Cookbook!

</p><p>

Mark-Jason said his class went well.  He'd also given a test run
before, but it had gone long.  So he'd dropped some stuff, and today
he ran a little short.  Not long enough to be a problem, as there are
always questions for the last few minutes at the end, but he was still
perturbed that it wasn't perfect.

</p><p>

Damian, once again, finished before me.  He didn't gloat this time,
but did 'fess up that he had abridged the class "a little" in order to
finish at the designated time.  That's cheating!  At least I got
through all my slides, even the hairy custom logger.

</p><p>

Brian was experiencing that usual teacher perplexity: I thought I was
off my game, but the students gave me rave reviews.  I think it's that
we spend so much time going over our performances with a fine toothed
comb that we focus in on the little things we goof up ("I should have
had an answer to that on the tip of my tongue!") instead of looking
at the glorious big picture which is 99.995% perfect.  I'm never sure
how much weight to give the often-contradictory student evaluations,
but it sure feels good to know that *someone* thought you did a good
job.

</p><p>

We went out to dinner with the Seattle Perl Users Group tonight, we
being Mark-Jason, Damian, Randal, Bill (Randal's social partner), and
myself.  A bunch of the ActiveState folks (Gisle and<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... ugh, someone
whom I'm embarrassed to forget the name of, who wrote Inline.pm) drove
down to see Damian give his Lingua::Romana::Perligata talk, which was
fabulous (as always).  Sarathy was supposed to come too, but had a
deadline (curse those deadlines).  I was very impressed with the way
that Tim Maher ran the meeting: anyone got any perl jobs, anyone want
a new job, Damian's talk, then a panel discussion taking questions
from the floor.

</p><p>

A fun night.  And to cap it off, when we got back to the hotel I got
to throw my weight around with United Airlines to help Damian out of a
disgustingly early (6am-ish) flight to Los Angeles tomorrow.  I knew
that I flew all those miles for a reason.  "Ah, Mr Torkington, 177,000
miles."  "Yes.  I guess that means you'll be trying to help me,
right?"  "Oh certainly, Mr Torkington."  That's the way, kiss my ass<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-) When Damian called, they threatened to charge him $2700 to change
his flight to one four hours later that had 60 empty seats.  When I
called they said "don't turn up for the earlier flight, just catch the
later one".  Friendly skies, I don't think.

</p><p>

So tomorrow it's Los Angeles and recharging (Damian's threatening to
cart me to Venice Beach to watch the freaks go by) and then Thursday
we're teaching again.  Mark-Jason says he's flying to Los Angeles
late tomorrow, and in the morning he's going to the big REI store to
climb their wall.  This is apparently a Seattle tourist thing.

</p><p>

Cheers;

</p><p>

Nat</p></p>
