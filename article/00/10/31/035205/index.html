As always, Larry's talks are interesting, but in my opinion the plans for Perl6 need to be drastically narrowed if its ever going to get off the ground. Supporting multiple backends, metaprogramming, objects, high-level programming, low-level programming...I really don't think people need or want perl to do as much as Larry is talking about for v6, nor do I think such a product can be delivered in a reasonable time frame.<p>The more I think about it, it looks like perl 6 has already been created and released as Ruby. Surfing the RFCs, it looks like at a language level, what people really want is object-orientation that isn't so warped - Ruby provides this while keeping most of the goodies from perl that we know and love, like regexes.</p><p>With so much on the agenda, it looks like we could be three years before perl5 can be safely retired - I'm wondering if that time would be more productively spent becoming a crack Ruby programmer...thoughts??</p>

<i>Surfing the RFCs, it looks like at a language level, what people really want is object-orientation that isn't so warped</i>

<p>Funny, the OOP RFC I thought was the most interesting was from Damian Conway that said Perl's OOP should <i>not</i> be fundamentally changed.


</p><p> <i> - Ruby provides this while keeping most of the goodies from perl that we know and love, like regexes.

With so much on the agenda, it looks like we could be three years before perl5 can be safely retired - I'm wondering if that time would be more productively spent becoming a crack Ruby programmer...thoughts?? </i>

</p><p>My thought about Ruby is the same thought I have about PHP: I have absolutely no reason to use it, whatsoever.</p>
