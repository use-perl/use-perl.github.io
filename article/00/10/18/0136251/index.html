<p>Nathan Torkington continues with his daily journal of the
<a href="http://conferences.oreilly.com/uperl2k/">University of Perl</a>,
starting a new week in Atlanta.<br/><br/><hr><br/><br/>Today saw my mod_perl class, Michel's XML class, Damian's OO, the
closing part of Brian's introductory class, and Dan's CGI class.
They all went well, despite Damian getting about 4 hours sleep, and
getting 8 hours but between 2:30 and 10:30.  I don't seem to have
left Colorado time.</p>
<p>I worked on the track layout for the 2001 Open Source Convention in
what remained of the morning, then read some evaluation forms from my
Advanced Perl class (positive, yay!) and then taught the mod_perl
class.  For some reason this one went 15 minutes *under* the time, and
I finished easily before Damian.  I don't really know why -- mainly, I
think, because the students didn't ask as many questions as in Seattle
or L.A.  Then again, perhaps it's because I've taught it enough now that
I know just how to give it.  I don't really know.

<p>

I had some good discussions with students in the class.  Two were from
an applications service provider (ASP), an industry which I'd long
thought to be fictitious but apparently they do really exist.  They
wanted to know whether mod_perl could withstand millions of hits a
day.  There are some million hits/day sites, for sure, I said, but you
can bet they're not serving those hits from a single Pentium 133 box
in their basement.  As with everything, hardware required is
commensurate with hits expected.  Too often I hear people frustrated
with mod_perl because when they open Apache up to run with 150 child
processes, their box runs out of memory.  Well, duh.

</p><p>

I caught the end of Damian's OO class, where he presents his Klingon
module.  The bit I saw deals with overloading string constants so
that when you write numbers in Klingon (words with lots of consonants)
Perl's parser turns them into actual usable numbers.  It's terrifying.

</p><p>

For dinner, Dan Klein, Damian, and I went up to the top of the Westin
hotel here in Atlanta and had dinner on their rotating restaurant.  It
was surprisingly disorienting, although the food was delicious (and
pricey!).  The view was astouding, and we could see everything from
the CNN HQ to Stone Mountain (which we decided was Atlanta's version
of Ayers Rock).  Mr. Visa is probably going to spank me for it, but
it was a classy and fun way to end our time in Atlanta.

</p><p>

No improvised comedy tonight, unfortunately.  Damian and I were both
exhausted and on hideous early flights tomorrow.  So an early bedtime
for us, listening to the dulcet tones of Larry's Atlanta Linux Showcase
talk (<a href="http://www.technetcast.com/">http://www.technetcast.com/</a>).

</p><p>

Nat</p></p>

<h2>millions of hits a day on a single box</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ask/">ask</a> on 2000-10-24T02:23:00</h3>
uh, duh.<p>

I have (many) servers serving millions of dynamic requests per day. Not Pentium 133's, but still cheap standard hardware.

</p><p>

There are many techniques to get mod_perl to be about as efficient as competing technologies.
