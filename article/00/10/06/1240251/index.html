<p>Nathan Torkington continues on his daily journal of the <a href="http://conferences.oreilly.com/uperl2k/">University of Perl</a>.<br/><br/><hr><br/><br/>Wow, what a fantastic day!  Flew from Seattle to Los Angeles, walked
on Venice Beach, and had a great dinner.  Oh, and checked into the
ultra-fancy hotel.  Ok, small pleasures.</p>
<p>I realized last night, while packing, that I'd left my bloody
cellphone in the room where Damian was giving his evening talk.
I'm such a moron.  At least I didn't lose my wallet or something
equally catastrophic.  Then again, it's my wife's cellphone, and
losing *anything* is 10 times worse when it's really the missus's.

<p>

I spent the entire day with Damian, more or less.  We had breakfast,
flew to LA, went for a 7 mile walk around Venice Beach, and finally
had dinner (with Dan Klein) before heading off to bed.  The man is
incredible.  He didn't saw off his own head from the boredom of
talking to me, and he was interesting the whole time.  And he is in
incredibly good shape: I was helped by being used to walking at high
altitudes, but Damian had no trouble keeping up my speedy walking pace
(and in fact handled it better than I did).

</p><p>

We talked about teaching, what we do right and how we could do better.
We talked about the classes, wondering why the signups for his
Practical Extraction and Reporting classes have been so low, even
though it's a killer class with all the data extraction clue you could
ever want, from regexps to recursive descent parsing in it (all we
could think of is that the title wasn't sexy enough: perhaps it needs
to be "Client-Server Active Parsing with Proactive Regular Expression
Synergies"?).  The classic marketing problem: while we can talk to
people who *did* come to the tutorials, we can't ask folks who
*didn't* "why didn't you like the sound of this class?".  We talked
about marriage and country life and the pain of trans-Pacific flights.

</p><p>

I'd been told that Venice Beach was the home of all the freaks in
LA, but I think that must only be on the weekends.  On weekdays
they're apparently holding down 9-5 jobs, as our 4:00-6:00 walk
didn't turn up many weirdos at all.  Well, except for the guy
painted silver pretending to be a statue.  And the guy with the
afro riding rollerblades while playing the electric guitar (he
had a portable amp slung around his shoulder) was pretty cool.
By the end, though, my feet were pretty sore and I was looking
forward to dinner.

</p><p>

The hotel is very fancy.  Huge white feather bed, a chair the size of
a couch, and a pretty impressive view.  The rooms for the talks are
nice, although we didn't get net access.  The Seattle hotel had
ethernet in the classrooms, while all we'll get here is a phone line.
Oh well, can't have it all.  The luxury of this is quite overwhelming
to this random bloke from New Zealand.

</p><p>

I'm knackered after the walk, and have to get some sleep.  I'll write
again tomorrow after the first day of classes here.

</p><p>

Nat</p></p>

Should I do this again for the Atlanta and New
York tutorials?  I never know whether anyone's
reading, whether a peek into the behind-the-scenes work at these things is interesting to folks.  Please let me know.<p>

Thanks,</p><p>

Nat</p>

I'm enjoying reading these messages.  This way you get to know the teacher and get some hints on Perl community stuff.  It's sort of like sitting down with you in an internet cafe talking with a bunch of other Perl Mongers.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)

    I am reading them as well, and enjoying them quite a bit. They offer a nice (and different) view of community.   So I would vote for the continuation of the series.
<br> <br>  In addition I would say that the name of the Damian's "Practical Extraction and Reporting" is a problem.  I at least thought, from it's title,  that  it was a more basic regex and text parsing class.  I think that may have been the reason at least one colleague of mine went to the DB class (in Seattle) instead.  Of course we probably should have read the description.

Nat,
<br>
<br>I'm reading and enjoying your reports. Please keep posting.
<br>
<br>As for the naming of Damian's "P, E &amp; R" talk - perhaps it could be something a bit catchier, like, oh, off the top of my head, "Data Munging with Perl"<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
<br>
<br>Cheers,

<br>Dave...

Presumably because the number of comments has
been so low, Nat Torkington asks:
<blockquote><div> <i>
Should I do this again for the Atlanta and New York tutorials?
</i>
</div></blockquote>
<p>
Sure.  I'll <i>never</i> get out to any of these events, and it's great to live vicariously through
the accounts and descriptions of others.  If the
question is more an expression of concern about
the number of commentators using use.perl.org
in general, I'd point out that the most glorious days of Usenet (and <i>maybe</i> even Slashdot) were when people did not feel compelled to respond to everything, but kept in mind that the whole world was watching their words.  There hasn't yet
been very much activity on use.perl.org, but that
might well change.  And someday, old-timers born
in the 80's will be as crotchety about the fall
of useperl as I am about the current "gimme" culture of Usenet.</p>
