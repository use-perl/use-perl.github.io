Where was this a couple of weeks ago when I was setting up the test box?<p>

Timing is everything.  {sigh}.</p>

The ppd for this has been listed for quite a while over at http://perl.apache.org/distributions.html<br/><br/>I've had that binary of mod_perl on my win machine for at least 2 or 3 months now<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br/><br/>--mark

True, I'd forgotten the one that's "available for testing."  I tried that back then, and it didn't work, although danged if I can remember why at the moment.<p>

(Probably because I was using an older version of Active and decided it was just as much hassle to upgrade as it was to grab the entire package just above it.  In which case, it's not so much an "Aaargh" since I'm sure the announcement here doesn't change that requirement... the only problem the version I got has given me is that the include paths all include "5.6.0" in them, which is vaguely annoying.)</p>
