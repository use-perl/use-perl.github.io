<p>Doug Sheppard writes part four of <a href="http://www.perl.com/pub/2000/12/begperl4.html">Beginners Intro to Perl</a>, and Mark-Jason Dominus posted the incisive <a href="http://www.perl.com/pub/2000/12/advocacy.html">Why I Hate Advocacy</a>.

<h2>embarassingly familiar</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/mstevens/">mstevens</a> on 2000-12-14T17:15:00</h3>
<p>
I can recognise far too much of what mjd critcises
 in myself and people I know. It's stuff I've been striving to fix ever since I read Nat's original article - thanks to mjd for making the problems
even clearer.
</p>
<p>
The only thing I would criticise about this article is the extended references to baseball, which I suspect will play really badly with anyone outside the US.... although they do work even if you're totally unfamiliar with the sport.
</p>



<h2>I voted for 'Other'</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/gaudior/">gaudior</a> on 2000-12-14T17:51:42</h3>
My other favorite language is UniVerse Pick Basic.



<h2>Another possible choice</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/hading/">hading</a> on 2000-12-15T00:48:41</h3>
<p>I voted for Common Lisp (which is actually my favorite language including Perl), but clearly on e of the choices should have been "There are other languages besides Perl?"<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>



<h2>Objective-C</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/beppu/">beppu</a> on 2000-12-15T22:41:32</h3>
I think Objective-C is nice, although I haven't had a chance to program in it, much.  Regardless, I think it's very clean, and I love how dynamic it is.
Maybe I'll put a GNUstep installation on my laptop and play around with it again.  (...If only I didn't have so much work to do).



<h2>Smalltalk</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/dws/">dws</a> on 2000-12-18T22:57:59</h3>
Smalltalk love ifTrue: [ horn honk ]



<h2>SML is a good choice</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/thomasj/">thomasj</a> on 2000-12-20T10:22:27</h3>
Standard ML is a very strong language and is a diamentral opposite choice from Perl in most ways: It is very strict typewise, it is pure functional and very oblivious.  But, it is practical.  And it is why I like both Perl and SML, since it is always about getting the job done and getting home before five.  (Maybe that is why I write so strange Perl and so convoluted SML<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)



<h2>C won't die.</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/cabes/">cabes</a> on 2000-12-22T21:07:07</h3>
If it wasn't for C I wouldn't have great things like Perl, Apache, and Linux to play with.



<h2>Thread mixup</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/bart/">bart</a> on 2000-12-31T15:59:57</h3>
In case you hadn't noticed yet, there are two articles with the same ID: 00/12/14/1653200, namely the languages poll, and "New www.perl.com Articles".
<br>
<br>That'll teach you to post two articles at the same time. The ID appears to be date and time stamp, and nothing more.
<br>
<br>Time for some debugging!
<br>



<h2>My other favourites</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/cmilton/">cmilton</a> on 2001-01-09T22:36:05</h3>
I'm fond of Haskell, Gofer, Moscow ML, Caml-Light,
and other functional programming languages.
<p>
I also like to write sed, awk, and ksh scripts,
though I keep trying to learn zsh and C...
</p><p>
Later.</p>



<h2>PostScript, GWBasic, PL/1, early IBM Assemblers</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/tds/">tds</a> on 2001-01-10T01:09:01</h3>
These were my favourite languages in their times, which might at least show Perl doesn't have to be a young person's language.
<p>
During the decade gap between PostScript and Perl, I did almost all my "programming" using the spreadsheet functions built into an obscure Macintosh app, RagTime 3, supplemented by a few tricky bits in Mathematica.
</p><p>



<h2>Prolog</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/mAsterdam/">mAsterdam</a> on 2001-01-29T00:08:46</h3>
Yes it has its drawbacks - don't they all. However, the elegant program/data syntax and its goal/vision - <b>pro</b>gramming in <b>log</b>ic make it a friendly uncle to Perl. Prolog really should have been in the picklist.



<h2>JavaScript</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/belg4mit/">belg4mit</a> on 2001-01-30T00:03:01</h3>
JavaScript
