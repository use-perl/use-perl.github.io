<p>KM writes <i>"<a href="http://www.indigostar.com/indigoperl.htm">IndigoPerl</a> apparently is a binary build of Perl 5.6, and a build of Apache for Win32 systems.

<p>I thought I had posted this before but can't find it.  So if I have or haven't, here it is anyway.  IndigoPerl is what was DynamicPerl, from the same people who do <a href="http://www.indigostar.com/perl2exe.htm">Perl2Exe</a>.</p></p>

<h2>Indigo Perl</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/cabes/">cabes</a> on 2000-12-01T15:50:24</h3>
Indigo Perl is a great alternate choice to ActiveState's Active Perl.  It has a very intuitive UI for adding Perl Modules.  This UI supports CPAN tarballs, PPMs, and its own format.  I have been using this dist. for win32 on Win2000 Pro because Active Perl will not install on my computer and ActiveState has not been able to resolve my installation issue.  Overall I believe that IndigoPerl will become a very good dist. of Perl on win32.



<h2>Build</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/belg4mit/">belg4mit</a> on 2000-12-01T17:29:52</h3>
I've used it.<br/><br/>Pros: It's binary compatible with ActiveState
      Package management.
Cons: No installer, so you can't opt out of Apache
      No defined license.

<h2>Great alternative to ActiveState</h2>

I\'ve had many problems with ActiveState in terms of module support (some are just windows issues).  But, it seems IndigoPerl does not have  as many problems (in fact, some of the windows issues do not show up under the IndigoPerl install).  And, (i teach perl to new programmers) new users tend to flock to the web console tool and the fact that you can test CGIs without access to a web server (a small apache server is provided with IndigoPerl).  I think it is a WONDERFUL alternative to ActiveState.

What do you mean, no defined license?  Perl is under the Artistic License or GPL.  Apache is under the Apache License.

Has anyone used Prl2Exe enough that they could comment on it's effectiveness or efficiency, etc? I would love to hear some comments.  I'm giving a presentation about Perl for Win32 in a few weeks, and admittedly, compiling Perl code into executables is a topic that I know little of, and would appreciate any input or insight that anyone could offer.
<br> <br>
On another, kind of unrelated note, I have noted some of the deficiencies of the ActiveState port, and have been compiling my own Perl from the standard source for some time.  If this distro is so great, how come Larry et al have not endorsed it as a good way to run Perl on Win32?  Does it behave differently when compared to the *NIX version of Perl, or what?
<br> <br>
Thank you for your time,<br>
Needles

Could you please list the deficiencies of the ActivePerl distribution here or email them to me?
