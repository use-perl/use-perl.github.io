<h2>Perl/Apache and XML</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ziggy/">ziggy</a> on 2000-04-08T05:47:12</h3>
Perl is a great tool for processing XML.  Check
out some of the modules in the XML:: and W3C::
namespaces.
<p>
If you need to increase the runtime performance, you could always install Apache with mod_perl.
</p><p>
Clark Cooper did a performance test
of various XML parsers in C/C++, Perl, Java and Python a while back for XML.com, and his XML::Parser gave adequate performance for most purposes.  Of course, "adequate performance"
is highly subjective; I don't think I'd even to use Perl or Java if I were managing a few TB of XML data; C/C++ is the only practical option at that point.</p>



<h2>Don't focus on just the XML part</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/chip/">chip</a> on 2000-04-09T08:57:35</h3>
An XML parser does not an application make.  As Larry's been known to say: "The complexity has to go *somewhere*".
<p>
I think you should stick to Perl until you have something that absolutely doesn't work with it.  But maybe that's just me.</p>



<h2>Too little information...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Abigail/">Abigail</a> on 2000-04-10T19:20:31</h3>
All you say is that you need to port some services to XML. Services that have to do with DB-backed sites. But you don't tell any details of either what needs to be done, what the requirements are, and what you have to work with.
<p>
Yet you ask for an objective opinion. IMO, that's a very unrealistic wish.

<h2>Re:Perl/Apache and XML</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/excalibor/">excalibor</a> on 2000-06-01T14:51:31</h3>
I'd say managing Tb of XML data is perfectly feasible in Perl or Java... it depends on how you need to use that data.. Certainly DOM is a no-no... but SAX lets you work on small bits of the grove without reading the whole thing to memory...
<br>
<br>I'd just hope there where validating parsers in Perl, but we'll have to wait a bit or use xpat in C, directly...
<br>
<br>(or maybe just help the author of XML::Parser...<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
