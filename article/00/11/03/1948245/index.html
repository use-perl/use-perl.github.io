Mark's article was directly on the mark. The perl6 RFC process was a complete mess, hardly elevating the dicsussion above usenet-grade soapboxing, although its unclear if anything more could really be expected from a distributed, asynchronous design effort.<p>Fortunately, as pointed out in the article, Larry will likely pull our collective butts out of the fire with a heroic effort - its just disappointing that the RFC process seemed to proceed with this expectation in mind.</p>

<p>If the RFCs were meant to be the "requirement docs" for the Perl 6 project, I'd understand the general disappointment. I never understood these docs to be so important. After all, specs that are never implemented have no life.

</p><p>The RFCs were a more organized attempt to hear what people wanted in Perl 6. There was no mandate to implement *ANY* RFC. RFC authors are, of course, free to fork Perl or create their own language as needed.

</p><p>Larry is one the greatest Open Source project managers to date. He has shepherded five iterations of Perl. I'm certain he will do his usual
best for 6.0. When Larry finally hangs up his Perl hat, then this community will need to adopt a radically different developement model for any future versions. I hope this RFC process will be helpful to those Larry-less perlers.</p>

I agree the RFC process could have been better, but that overall it went pretty well.  Back at TPC, we said these RFCs would NOT be regular "RFCs" but actual "Requests for Comments."  Yes, they could have been developed more, better written and organized, etc.  But I think it went well, overall.
