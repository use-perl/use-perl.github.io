<p>Nathan Torkington concludes his daily journal of the
<a href="http://conferences.oreilly.com/uperl2k/">University of Perl</a>.  Nat, thanks very much for these features<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... they've been quite entertaining and interesting.  I have to party with you, man.  You're an animal.<br/><br/><hr><br/><br/>Sleep between Thursday and Friday wasn't too good, as you'll
understand from reading my Thursday diary.  I staggered out of bed at
10:30, feeling like crap (I'm such a Perl hacker I typed that as
"carp" originally<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-).</p>
<p>I had breakfast/lunch downstairs.  At times like this it's good to
know the conference's hotel guru personally.  Angela fixed me up with
a fruit platter instead of the oily lunch they were serving, and after
some ibuprofen and orange juice I managed to stand without feeling
like I was going to fall over.

 <p>

I had a good conversation with A/V guys.  They were telling me about
their favourite Commodore 64 games (mine was "Impossible Mission",
without a doubt).  Then Chris told a great story about meeting Bill
Gates back when he was only worth $150M or so.  Chris was doing AV for
a conference and was sitting with a friend on the edge of the stage
after soundcheck.  Friend had bought a tub of licorice sticks.
Suddenly they feel this "presence" behind them, and it's Bill about 20
feet away, eyeing the licorice sticks with unnerving focus.  Friend
says "Bill, you're welcome to have some if you want".  Bill scurried
over ("scurried" was the exact word used), took some sticks, then
scurried away.  "I tell you man, the PR job they've done in the last
few years to make him seem like a normal yet fantastically wealthy
guy<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... it's incredible."

</p> <p>

No sooner had lunch finished than it was time for my mod_perl class.
I was very nervous about it, because I felt bad and my throat was sore
after the previous night.  I stood up, and the microphone didn't
really work well so I just used volume.  It must be something about
standing and speaking very loudly that energizes the human body,
because I was able to teach very well that day.

</p> <p>

It was only when I stopped that I felt my fatigue.  I stayed about 45
minutes after class, chatting to students, Dave Adler, and Paul
Grassie.  Paul's an instructor for Tom Christiansen Perl Consultancy,
where I've taught for two or three years.  He wrote the excellent
beginner class, and has been working on tweaking my intermediate class
lately.  I like Paul a lot--he's a genuine, friendly guy, and a
pleasure to talk to.

</p> <p>

Finally, though, I went upstairs to collect my check.  I passed a
horde including MjD, and the horde's mood was jubilant.  Mark had his
check for teaching, and there was the usual elation accompanying the
last day of classes.  We agreed to go out for rodizio, just as soon as
I collected my check.  When I got to the O'Reilly room, they'd all
packed up and buggered off!  I've since received the check in the
mail, thank goodness, but it was quite the surprise.  I guess I
shouldn't have stayed talking for so long.

</p> <p>

So Mark-Jason Dominus, Damian Conway, Dave Adler, a young hacker
Casey, and me, all ended up at an outstanding rodizio restaurant.  It
was my first rodizio experience, but it will not be the last.  They
just kept bringing large skewers of meat past, slicing off portions
for us, as often as we wanted.  Every cut of meat, every type of meat,
even seafood!  Damian and I, inveterate meat-lovers, were in heaven.

</p> <p>

When we were finally gorged, we left Mark and went to a comedy improv
club.  There was a tiny audience (in fact, we made up the headcount
they needed as a minimum to do the show), which made it hard for the
performers.  But they tried their best, and it was very funny
nonetheless.  Coincidences of coincidences, there was a New Zealand
woman in the audience.  They used her story (in New York with her
girlfriends, left kids with husband in California) as the basis for
an improvised Broadway musical that ended up involving black magic
and demonic possession.  Brilliant.

</p> <p>

After that, Damian, Casey, and I walked back to the hotel, hunting for
an ice-cream place to satisfy my cravings.  We couldn't get any, and
finally went to a restaurant near-by and only had dessert.  We said
goodbye to Casey after that, and went back to the hotel.

</p> <p>

At that point, Damian and I had to say goodbye.  I had an 8 a.m. flight
the next day, and he was heading back to Australia.  It was hard to
say goodbye, to finally conclude these great weeks.  I feel like that
at the end of every conference, even after the get-togethers that the
denizens of the talk.bizarre newsgroup put on<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... I want them to last
forever, to be able to savour this incredible feeling of being around
like-minded people and never have it stop.  But all things come to an
end, and this was no exception.

</p> <p>

The flight the next morning went well, and I was met in Fort Collins
by Jenine and William (my family).  I was sad to see the end of the
tutorials, and will miss my friends from that group, but I am also
very glad to be back with my family.  Jenine and I agreed afterwards
that it was about three days too many: both of us felt separation
pangs on the final Wednesday.

</p> <p>

So I'm back, and will be cooking up plans for another University of
Perl tour.  I'll let you know when and if that comes to fruition.
Until then I remain<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...

</p> <p>

Your humble correspondent,

</p> <p>

Nat.</p></p>

Even if you had gotten out of Advanced Perl on time, you still would have missed them.  After I left your modperl class, I walked directly to the O'Rielly tables.  They had all the O'Rielly books packed, and only had a couple of the UoP2k coursebooks on the table.
