<div class="span8">
<p>Well, use Perl has been live for awhile.  And all of the content of <a href="http://news.perl.org/">Perl News</a> is on use Perl.  So should Perl News just go away?  I have some thoughts about it.  Weigh in with comments and vote in the poll (not that the poll means anything<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-).</p>
<p>First, we still need the mailing list.  I can modify the Slash code to send out the text of the articles as well as the headlines, and then make an account for the mailing list, so the daily news will get sent to the mailing list.

<p>

Second, we probably still need a "stripped-down" interface to Perl News, like we have now.  This isn't too tough either; we'd either directly output the data to an HTML file, or we'd have a separate stripped-down direct interface to the database.

</p><p>

Third, we would still need a search mechanism.  The search in use Perl / Slash needs quite a bit of work, but it basically does everything the Perl News search does (which isn't much<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-).

</p><p>

Fourth, I would have to consider keeping the news on use Perl separate from the rest of the stuff on use Perl, if that is what people want.  This isn't tough; we have a separate "News" section in use Perl, and I have already been putting stuff from Perl News under that section on use Perl.

</p><p>

Why do all this?  Because it will make my life simpler.  Any thoughts or opinions or suggestions y'all have are appreciated.</p></p>

Seems to me that use Perl; is a superset of Perl News, so why bother keeping up both? I'd really like to see use Perl; grow as a community site....
<br>
<br>Chris -- if/when Perl News is no more, I assume slashboxes will be available for use Perl; instead of Perl News? (For Slashdot, etc.)
<br>

Well, the reason I might bother is because people want "just the news."  I will post on Perl News about this too, so its users can weigh in.
<br>
<br>And yes, there is a use Perl "slashbox" now.  All Slash sites have them by default, at http://slash.example.com/sitename.rdf.  You can get the use Perl slashbox at <a href="http://use.perl.org/useperl.rdf" title="perl.org">http://use.perl.org/useperl.rdf</a perl.org>.



<h2>The world is big enough for both</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/KM/">KM</a> on 2000-07-25T16:50:38</h3>
I like having both the Perl News and use Perl;. Why? Because I don't always have time to look at the web, so I like getting the Perl News via email. I also like the news because I then have a nice list of new modules. I like the website because I can then see what others think on the news. Anyways, I think both resources have their place.
<p>
Cheers,<br>
KM</p>



<h2>use Perl; includes Perl News</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/n8/">n8</a> on 2000-07-25T17:31:15</h3>
On use Perl; I've got my preferences set so that it e-mails me the headlines every day, and that's just right for me.  I ignore things that don't look interesting.
<br>
<br>I haven't ever been a regular user of Perl News but it looks to me like it could be assimilated by use Perl.



<h2>Re:The world is big enough for both</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/pudge/">pudge</a> on 2000-07-26T02:39:59</h3>
But we could have the same stuff sent by email, including the list of modules; in fact, I would insist that I get that done, because I know people want it.

<h3><a href="/user/pudge/">pudge</a> on 2000-07-26T02:51:02</h3>
By the way, it looks as though all of the "objections" to Perl News going away can be dealt with by simply making use Perl offer the same features.  So I am leaning toward 1. developing Slash to support the email features we want, 2. fixing the search up a bit, and 3. making a better stripped-down interface to the site for those that just want the news.  That seems to me like it would be the best thing.  Please, let me know any other thoughts or objections or approvals you have.

I'm primarily interested in the module list via email. Don't be offended, but I almost *never* go to use.perl.org. As long as module updates get my way, or if an RSS of the module list is made available that I can write a script to grab every couple of days for my own needs, I'm happy.



<h2>I wouldn't be here if the change was retrospective</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/tds/">tds</a> on 2000-07-26T06:14:31</h3>
<p>I wonder if this applies to others.</p>

<p>I manage to keep up with <b>Perl News</b> because it is listed amongst the <a href="http://directory.netscape.com/Top/Netscape/My_Netscape_Network/Computers" title="netscape.com">channels available</a netscape.com> for <b>my.netscape.com</b>, which I continue to use because of my diverse interests, despite its seeming lack of attention. Perl News is my top centre my.netscape channel.</p>

<p>Now I guess I could have spent the time it took me to join up here and post this to give myself a similarly convenient way of being reminded of <b>use Perl;</b> every time I open a new browser window. One day I might still get around to that. But I suspect this change might affect more than me. So it would be nice if somebody who is a lot closer to this could make sure that necessary changes to my.netscape and any similar places are coordinated.</p>



<h2>Re:I wouldn't be here if the change was retrospect</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/pudge/">pudge</a> on 2000-07-26T13:38:14</h3>
There will still be regular posts to the same mailing list, as it is now, or similar (probably more regular, like every night, since it is auotmated in the Slash code).
<br>
<br>There will still be an RSS file; I'll probably just make it so the old URL points to the new URL.

<i>I'll probably just make it so the old URL points to the new URL.</i><br/><br/>That sounds like my kind of solution.<br/><br/>But don't get me talking about e-mail<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-(



<h2>Need RSS for my Intranet portal</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/boyken/">boyken</a> on 2000-07-31T20:50:22</h3>
I currently provide Perl News headlines as a channel on the intranet portal I maintain, via an RSS file at the Perl News site.  If there is a similar capability available at "use Perl;" I haven't found it.  Based solely on that, I would not want to lose Perl News.



<h2>Re:Need RSS for my Intranet portal</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/pudge/">pudge</a> on 2000-08-01T11:38:58</h3>
Heh.  In this very article, in the comments above, there is a link to the RSS file for use Perl.



<h2>OK, so I didn't look very hard...</h2>
