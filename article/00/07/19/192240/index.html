<div class="span8">
<p>Day three is the first day of the conference sessions.  We've got notes
on the next Perl conference, the day's keynotes, announcements from
Sun and the perl porters, and various awards.


<p>
Andy Hertzfeld of <a href="http://www.eazel.com/">Eazel</a>
(and formerly of <a href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple</a>)
gave the morning's keynote address, "Open Source and the Personal
Computer Revolution."  He discussed the history of PCs, Bill Gates,
the Woz, copy protection, and the various events in the personal computer
movement that led to contribute to the open source movement.  He went
over some of the key moments in the open source movement, including
the old recounting of the Hacker Ethic, and put forth his own addendum
to the ethic: "the coolest thing of all is to have millions of people
using your code."</p></p>
<p><p>
Following that, a representative of <a href="http://www.sun.com/">Sun</a> announced that the company has released its office suite,
<a href="http://www.sun.com/staroffice/">StarOffice</a>, under the
GNU General Public License.  They also opened the
<a href="http://www.openoffice.org/">OpenOffice.org</a> site.  For
more information, check out the links on
<a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=00/07/19/1226223">Slashdot</a>.
</p>

<p>
Nathan Torkington gave out the conference awards for Best Web
Application (My.University, by Nathan Bailey, Andrew Bromage,
and Andrew Creer), Best Technical Paper (perljvm, by Bradley M.
Kuhn), and Best New Module (Template Toolkit, by Andy Wardley).
The Larry Wall Award once again went to Damian Conway for
Text::AutoFormat, and he has withdrawn from future contention
for the award, which will henceforth be known as the Damian
Conway Award.  Each winner received $1,000.
</p>

<p> <b>Update: 07/26 02:38 AM</b> by <b> <a href="http://pudge.net/">P</a> </b>: Oopsie.  Actually, the award will remain the Larry Wall Award, and the Best Technical Paper award will be renamed the Damian Conway Award.</p>

<p>
Speaking of awards,
on Tuesday night (our complete Tuesday wrapup is forthcoming),
brian d foy presented the White Camel Awards, sponsored by
<a href="http://www.perl.org/">Perl Mongers</a> and
<a href="http://www.oreilly.com/">O'Reilly</a>.  The White Camels,
granted to people with significant non-technical contributions
to Perl, were granted to Elaine
Ashton for Perl user groups, Chris Nandor for Perl community, and
Nathan Torkington for Perl advocacy.  Each winner received $3,000.
</p>

<p>
Torkington then announced that the next Perl conference would be
held in San Diego, CA on July 23-26, 2001, and noted that
the call for papers is beginning now (we will post a link when we
have it).
</p>

<p>
Larry Wall's latest State of the Onion was on the topic of music.
He played dozens of instruments, from the dulcimer to the sticks to
the violin.  He, as is his way, did what no one else really could do:
liken Perl and its culture to music and its.  He noted that the difference
between a violin and a fiddle depended primarily on what class you
call the method from.  Then Larry talked about Perl changing, with
development efforts beginning on Perl 6, a complete rewrite of Perl
(see other story).

<h2>Text::AutoFormat ?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jon peterson/">jon peterson</a> on 2000-07-20T10:30:26</h3>
This doesn't appear to be in CPAN. Does anyone know more about it and where it might be available from?
<br>
<br>



<h2>Re:Text::AutoFormat ?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/nate/">nate</a> on 2000-07-20T14:18:20</h3>
Text::AutoFormat is basically a better 'par' or 'fmt'.  It (as all Damian's modules -- he's done about 7 presentations at the con!<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-P) will be released to CPAN soon (if not this week).

<p>
The one paragraph abstract is available on the
<a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/w/perl_presentations.html" title="oreillynet.com">oreilly</a oreillynet.com> site.

</p><p>
BTW, it is worth mentioning that they said that Damian isn't eligible for further rewards at his own request<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>



<h2>Re:Text::AutoFormat ?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/pudge/">pudge</a> on 2000-07-20T19:06:05</h3>
Also, I was WRONG when I noted the Larry Wall Award is being renamed.  It is not.  The Best Technical Paper award is being renamed with Damian's name (though he has never won this award<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:).



<h2>My University</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Skud/">Skud</a> on 2000-07-21T06:28:48</h3>
Congrats to Nate and the Monash FLT team!  I was involved in the very very early prototype days of this project, and it's great to see my baby grow up into such a great product.

<h3><a href="/user/Pseudonym/">Pseudonym</a> on 2000-07-24T05:35:32</h3>
<p>Thanks, Skud.  And for the record, we didn't even offer have to her any of the $1000.</p>
