<h1>Perl 6 To Be Complete Rewrite (But Not What You Think)</h1>

</div> <!-- /span4 -->


<div class="span8">
<p>Larry Wall and other active Perl porters and Perl helpers met on Tuesday
afternoon at <a href="http://conferences.oreilly.com/perl4/">Perl Conference
4.0</a> and mapped out a what is planned to become a complete rewrite
of Perl that will become Perl 6 in 18 to 24 months, with a prerelease
targeted for next year's conference.


<p>
Perl 5 will not be abandoned, but will primarily be concerned with bugfixes
both major and minor.</p></p>
<p><p>
The meeting for members of the perl5-porters mailing list was the result
of an earlier, smaller meeting of Wall, Nathan Torkington, Chip Salzenberg,
and others who basically decided that Perl needed to be fixed in certain
ways, and that a rewrite was the best way to do it.  Salzenberg started the
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/topaz/">Topaz</a> project two
years ago, to reimplement Perl in C++.  Though Topaz itself will not be
the basis for Perl 6, Salzenberg noted that the lessons learned in the
experience will be very helpful to the new effort.
</p>

<p>
Torkington led the three-hour meeting, starting off by saying what was
wrong with Perl.  Much of the focus on the problems with Perl centered
around how increasingly difficult it was to improve, extend, and embed
Perl.  A rewrite and redesign are needed, he said, and maybe it is time
for a hard change.  So while the focus of the effort seems to be on improving
the Perl guts and API, the project will also be used as an opportunity to
clean out some of the cruft, including bad and seldom-used features.
</p>

<p>
Some of the primary (and still vague) goals of the effort will be to
reimplement the core so it is better, stronger, and faster; improve
syntax; add new features where appropriate; have better version and
installation management for perl and its modules; and have a clear
and automated migration path, which may include a backward compatibility
mode.  Some old features may be removed, like typeglobs.  Others
will be improved.
</p>

<p>
The group hopes to re-shape Perl community, too.  Instead of one
all-encompassing perl5-porters list, tightly focused mailing lists
with a terminal lifespan will be formed.  To start off, the mailing
list <a href="mailto:bootstrap-subscribe@perl.org">bootstrap
at perl.org</a> will be for discussion of the
beginnings of the project.  Like most, if not all, other new lists,
when it has fulfilled its purpose, it will be closed.
</p>

<p>
Wall said, "Perl 5 was my rewrite of perl<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... I think this should be
the community's rewrite of perl, and the community's rewrite of
the community."
</p>

<p>
Specifics have not yet been ironed out.  A group has been formed to
begin the work, which will primarily consist of planning the work to
be done.  No coding is to be done at this stage, only planning and
support.  Roles were determined for the group, and then they were
filled.  They now include the perl 5 maintainer (Jarkko Hietaniemi
and Nick Ing-Simmons), the language design pumpking (Larry Wall),
the internals design pumpking (Dan Sugalski), the documentation
manager (Adam Turoff), the system administrator (Ask Bjoern Hansen),
the quality assurance bloke (Michael Schwern), the spokesdroid
(brian d foy), the customer relations person (Dick Hardt), and the
project manager himself, Nathan Torkington.  Other porters, such as
Chip Salzenberg, volunteered to consult when needed.
</p>

<p>
Some of the short term goals of this group are to draft a language
specification, start an RFC channel, get feedback, and set up mailing
lists, a documentation repository, and a web site.
Hansen will be setting up the mailing lists.  The bootstrap
list will be open to the public, while the list for the intial small
group of people will be closed for posting by anyone not on the list.
All lists will be readable by the public, through the web, and perhaps
through email.  Turoff is going to be preparing the notes for the
morning meeting, and foy will be posting the notes and the mailing
list links on the <a href="http://www.perl.org/">www.perl.org</a> web
site.

It is not decided, but I cannot imagine it will be C++.  I think too many people would rather have C.

What initial list of porters?  There isn't one.

<h3><a href="/user/brian_d_foy/">brian_d_foy</a> on 2000-07-20T02:38:35</h3>
There is a first list of volunteers on www.perl.org.  At this time, Sarathy has not volunteered for a particular role in Perl 6, but has not commented on why.<br/><br/>Everything is still in the early stages of organization, so you should not infer anything from omissions.

<h3><a href="/user/gaudior/">gaudior</a> on 2000-07-20T13:05:13</h3>
No inferences were intended.<br>I have been a lurker on p5p on and off for years. Sarathy's contribution to the current state of Perl is deep and wide. I hope he has the time and willingness to contribute to the re-write, given his experience.



<h2>perl 6?!?!</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/akira/">akira</a> on 2000-07-20T13:59:25</h3>
Please... correct me if I'm wrong, but didn't Larry Wall state that there wasn't going to be a perl 6?  That the numbering would continue past 5.9 to 5.10<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...etc...



<h2>Re:perl 6?!?!</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/pudge/">pudge</a> on 2000-07-20T15:43:33</h3>
Larry might have said that, I don't recall.  He did say that there may never be a need for it, but that was assuming the perl internals were sufficient to make Perl extensible and embeddable.  That assumption appears to be widely questioned now.

<h2>Desirable feature ...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/LizardKing/">LizardKing</a> on 2000-07-20T16:06:10</h3>
I hope that the rewrite works out - it's not everyday that something as widely used as Perl is redone from scratch. I'm also hoping that the internals will be reworked with an eye to producing executables from Perl code - or allowing Perl to [insert-fave-language] translators to be plugged in to the backend.
<br>



<h2>Re:No C++ ?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ask/">ask</a> on 2000-07-20T19:02:32</h3>
Yes, I agree.
<br>
<br>But my point was that the whole idea is to remove all assumptions, start from a blank page and get the best possibly language and implementation out of it - so by princip we don't know yet.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

<h3><a href="/user/jules/">jules</a> on 2000-07-20T21:47:04</h3>
Why not write perl in perl?



<h2>Perl 6 observations</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jking/">jking</a> on 2000-07-20T21:54:25</h3>
So they're really writing Perl 6?
<p>
Ah, the moment many people have been waiting for...the chance to advance their own modest
proposals for re-syntaxing perl.  Gosh, I've been hatching those since 1991 or so.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)
</p><p>
I'll spare you my own ideas, but I think anybody interested in this project should look at Damian Conway's spectacular efforts
to save C++ from its own syntax, namely
<a href="http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/user/damian/papers/PS/ModestProposal.ps" title="monash.edu.au"> A modest proposal: C++ Resyntaxed (postscript) </a monash.edu.au>.  Since Conway is something of a perl insider, I'm kind of hoping he'll have a hand in this aspect of Perl 6.
</p><p>
One other beautiful paper for anybody proposing to (re)design a language would be Guy Steele's <strong>Growing a Language</strong> paper (available in both<a href="http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/who/wadler/steele-oopsla98.ps" title="bell-labs.com">postscript</a bell-labs.com> and <a href="http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/who/wadler/steele-oopsla98.pdf" title="bell-labs.com">PDF</a bell-labs.com> formats.  I know that people like Guy Steele are probably the indirect targets of some of Larry Wall's barbs about language design, but I think his experience (and
wit) are ignored at your peril.</p>

I forwarded this question to Sarathy.  Here's
his response.

<blockquote><div>
I consider myself to be still very much in the big Perl picture.
<p>
However, I'd also like to enjoy a brief "sabbatical" after three
years in the hot-seat, if that is at all possible.  I've always
wanted to scratch the itch of doing cool things _with_ Perl rather
than _to_ perl.  I'm still hoping this may be the best time to
start scratching.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>

<h3><a href="/user/-wUT/">-wUT</a> on 2000-07-21T01:36:52</h3>
He also said that Perl was finished because it's out of characters for special variables. He has always had the right to be wrong and the right to what's wrong. See the Artistic License....



<h2>No Perl in Perl</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/chip/">chip</a> on 2000-07-21T19:43:12</h3>
Because Perl is an applications language, but the Perl implementation is a systems programming job.



<h2>Re:No Perl in Perl</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jprit/">jprit</a> on 2000-07-21T20:15:32</h3>
Granted, but what about using perl as a C*
<br>code generator instead of writing C+ by hand?
<br>(Also see my posts on the bootstrap list.)



<h2>Re:No Perl in Perl</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/chip/">chip</a> on 2000-07-21T20:41:21</h3>
Generating C from Perl is like generating C++
from Smalltalk.  The impedance mismatch between
VM models is too great for effectiveness.  IMO, of course.



<h2>Re:perl internals, what went wrong</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Andrew Langmead/">Andrew Langmead</a> on 2000-07-22T20:37:37</h3>
What went wrong with the design of the perl 5 internals, or maybe the question is, what went wrong with the maintainance of the internals 5.000.
<p>
I remember when Larry Wall used to write on comp.lang.perl about what he was working on for perl5. And yes, he said many times that there <em>shouldn't</em> (not wouldn't) need to be a perl 6 if perl 5 became what he thought it should. That the rewrite of the core was more modular, etc. and so the language could be extended through modules and XS rather than having to rewrite the interpreter.
</p><p>
 Now for some software projects, a 6 year lifetime is a remarkable feat. But for something that was supposed to be designed to avoid having a "shelf-life", it seems that something had to go wrong somewhere. It seems that perl5 only had the lifespan of perl3 and perl4.</p>
