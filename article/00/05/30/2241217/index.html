<p>Ziggy reporting:

<p>In transit to Juneau. As of 3pm PDT: Next Sunrise: 5:19 am. Next Sunset: 10:15 pm. Weather: Partly Cloudy. Outside Air temp: 50F. Relative Humidity: 80%. Air Pressure 30.1" rising. Sea Conditions: Moderate (4-7.5 ft). Wind: NW, Force 7 (Near Gale). Sea Temperature: 51.8F. Pool Temperature: 77F. Spa Pool Temperature: 76.1.</p></p>
<p>Today is a half working day. Seminars started at 8:30 this morning. This session was filled with old standbys such as Randal Schwartz's PROM and mjd's ever-popular Tricks of the Wizards, but it also saw some newer material, like Tom Christiansen's application analysis, an intermediate-level introduction to Perl and MySQL by Reuven Lerner, and XML from the ground up, presented by John Simpson.

<p>The non-working half of the day (for spouses and significant others) included a mixer for "geek widows" and "insignificant others" in the morning, as well as the usual compliment of shopping on the Promenade, gambling in the casino, and the ever-popular, never-ending spectacular views of British Columbia.

</p><p>For the over-75 crowd, activities included a bingo tournament, a wine tasting, an ettiquite class and an art auction (no wonder so many people are flocking to Tom's talk this afternoon!). Tonight is a formal dinner night; prepare for Geeks in Suits and Dresses (and some seriously unique bow-ties to really separate the retirees from the geeks).

</p><p>Tomorrow, we dock in Juneau, Alaska. On tap for a pub crawl in search of some local flavor, as well as a few thousand other shore excursions involving helicopters, sled dogs, glaciers, kayaks and other such outdoorsy stuff.

</p><p>Until tomorrow, <em>Z</em>.</p></p>

I'd better start saving my pennies. It sounds like fun.

There's plenty of time.  The next one isn't
announced yet, but should be about 18 months
away.  That will help unpack the Perl conference
season.
