<p>Special Correspondent Adam "Ziggy" Turoff reports from Perl Whirl 2000:

<p>Now that everyone was starting to arrive in Vancouver, BC, the idea began to set in with everyone that we're all going on a Perl Cruise <em>tomorrow</em>. The night stared off with a pre-cruise sendoff party at the beautiful Pan Pacific hotel on the Vancouver waterfront. Here, some of us picked up our cruise materials, obligatory sweatshirt (heavyweight, and suitable for use in the brisk sea air) and enjoyed a neverending supply of seafood hors d'oeuvres.</p></p>
<p>Following the GeekCruises sendoff party, many of us adjourned to the soon-to-be ActiveState building in downtown Vancouver. The party was open only to the most select of Perl hackers -- anyone who could find one of the thousands of chalk messages scrawled on the sidewalk leading Perlfolk ever closer to ActiveState and Pythonfolk ever closer to the Pacific Ocean.

<p>The decor in the recently-demolished, soon-to-be-renovated interior was reminiscent of parties in a friend's perpetually unfinished loft apartment in Greenwich Village. Of course, the music was just as loud, but the air outside was much, much cleaner. Everyone needed to sign a "liability waiver" before going upstairs to the party. I think we actually signed non-disclosure agreements or employment contracts with ActiveState. Ignore everything I just said about the party; I meant to say: "It was great. [ActiveState is hiring.] It was better than cats. [Work for ActiveState.] I'll go back again and again."

</p><p>Your intrepid reporter, <em>Z</em>.</p></p>

will people have hot grits down their pants?
