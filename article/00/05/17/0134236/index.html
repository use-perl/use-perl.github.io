This is not (yet...) a test in certification terms, more a fun quiz, but if you have an interest in Perl Tests you might like to have a look, add a couple of questions, and send me any feedback, bug reports, moans and groans you have.

<p>Ironically, I get an <tt>`Odd number of items in hash at line something-or-other'</tt> error when I try to take the test.</p>

That's because you broke it.&#3;

That's because you aren't cookie friendly.
<br>
<br>If you tell me your browser/os combo + any cookie affecting software you may have, that will help me.
<br>
<br>It does seem that a large number of people are very anti cookie, which we won't go into here. This is a shame, but it may be that my use of cookies is in some way bad.
<br>
<br>Meanwhile, feel free to use a cookie-friendly browser to use the site<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)
<br>
<br>And yes, I will catch that error and make it say something more useful than waffle about hashes<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

I didn't <b>think</b> my ad blocking proxy was diddling with cookies, but when I set `direct connection' (NS 4.72, accept cookies from same site only) it worked fine (and I got an 80% on difficulty 4<nobr> <wbr></nobr><tt>:/</tt>).  At any rate, I'm going through squid with `<tt>ad-zap</tt>'.

I have cookies working (that is how I can post on Slash!), I am not using any proxy, and I get the "cookies must be on" error.  Inspecting the stream, I can see cookies are being set; why do you think they aren't?

Oh happy web development.
<br>
<br>Things worked fine in IE and in Netscape 6.0 beta (on Windows.) The KDE browser and Netscape 4.x on Linux thought otherwise.
<br>
<br>I maintain I was RFC compliant and they weren't, but I've changed to a subset of the RFC which we all seem to comply with currently, so I think everything is happy, and yes I should have used a cookie library, but I naively figured writing one line of text would be easy<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:_)
<br>
<br>What's a beta test for..
<br>



<h2>Re:Doesn't work. :)</h2>

It is still not working for me.  Netscape 4.72 and IE 5 and iCab PR 2, all for Mac OS.  The only browser I have that works is Netscape 6 PR 1.
<br>
<br>And there is a question I got right that is wrong, #17:
<br>
<br>"Which of the following is functionally the same as: my $person = new Employee::Temp;"?
<br>
<br>My answer was "my $person = Employee::Temp-&gt;new()".  However, the "correct" answer was given as "my $person = &amp;Employee::Temp::new()".  But the "new Class" and "Class-&gt;new" are really correct, because both call new() as a class method.  They send the class name as the first argument, and they honor inheritance.  Consider:
<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; #!/usr/bin/perl -wl
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; package Employee::Temp;
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; @ISA = 'Employee';
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; sub rate { 'hourly' }
<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; package Employee;
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; sub new { bless {}, shift }
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; sub rate { 'salary' }
<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; package main;
<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; my $p1 = new Employee::Temp;
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; print $p1-&gt;rate;
<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; my $p2 = Employee::Temp-&gt;new();
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; print $p2-&gt;rate;
<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; my $p3 = &amp;Employee::Temp::new();  # no such subroutine
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; print $p3-&gt;rate;  # huh?
<br>
<br>

You're not cooking your CGI values as you receive them.  This can be bad.  For example, using a URL of:<p>
<tt>
http://www.snowdrift.org/cgi-bin/eperl/computers/perl/pt/question.ep?id=*
</tt> </p><p>

Causes an SQL error to print:</p><p>
<tt>
DBD::mysql::st execute failed: You have an error in your SQL syntax near '* and b.question_id = a.question_id and c.category_id = a.category' at line 1 at<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/home/snowdrif/lib/perl/PerlTest/Question.pm line 80.<br>
DBD::mysql::st execute failed: You have an error in your SQL syntax near '* and b.question_id = a.question_id and c.category_id = a.category' at line 1 at<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/home/snowdrif/lib/perl/PerlTest/Question.pm line 80.

</tt>
</p><p>
Did you really want me to be able to put in values on my end and have them inserted directly into your SQL?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p><p><p>
