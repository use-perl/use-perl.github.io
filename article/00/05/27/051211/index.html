<p>We've started up a new Perl web site, based on the
<a href="http://slashcode.com/">Slash</a> code that runs
<a href="http://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</a>.
<a href="http://use.perl.org/">use Perl</a> is a site that has all
the news from Perl News, along with posts relating to issues or
anything else of interest to the Perl community.  It includes headlines
from related sites and other coolness.</p>

<h2>Great!</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/erik/">erik</a> on 2000-05-27T11:55:00</h3>
Nice job on the site! I've wanted a site like this for a long time - I'll be one of your daily readers.



<h2>Re:Great!</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/pudge/">pudge</a> on 2000-05-27T13:20:41</h3>
Cool.  I hope we have more than one.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)



<h2>Nice Work, Pudge</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Falsch Freiheit/">Falsch Freiheit</a> on 2000-05-27T19:07:30</h3>
I'll probably be reading regularly.
<p>
Also, you managed to get it looking better than<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/. looks.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)  The "statusline" changes when hovering over the buttons for changing "slashbox" positions are nice, but would be more useful if they included the name of the slashbox you were acting on.</p>



<h2>Re:Nice Work, Pudge</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/pudge/">pudge</a> on 2000-05-27T23:38:06</h3>
Hey Frei, whassup?  Good to see you.
<br>
<br>Just to clarify: are you talking about the Up Down Kill icons for the slashboxes, instead saying something like "www.perl.com Up", "www.perl.com Kill", etc.?



<h2>Re:Nice Work, Pudge</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Falsch Freiheit/">Falsch Freiheit</a> on 2000-05-28T03:47:24</h3>
yes.



<h2>Good use of Slash</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ajs/">ajs</a> on 2000-05-28T16:32:14</h3>
I think Perl section on Slashdot would have gotten lost in the noise, but as a stand-alone site it has a chance to gain momentum with the Perl community.

<p>One odd question: why no anonymous posting?</p>



<h2>Re:Good use of Slash</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/pudge/">pudge</a> on 2000-05-28T21:37:55</h3>
Well, we may allow it in the future (it is now just a boolean option in the code), but I think it has little benefit for us, and we stand to lose a lot by allowing it.  Specifically, we want this site to be a primarily civil place for the Perl community, and anonymity on web-based discussion groups breeds incivility.
<br>
<br>If there is a great reason to have anonymity, I welcome a discussion of it.



<h2>Please remove the Preformatted stuff from footer..</h2>

There's a big quote from Larry at the bottom of the page that causes my browser to throw up a  scrollbar. I don't like having to scroll side-to-side if there's not a Good Reason.
<br>
<br>Yes, reading Larry's wisdom might be a good reason, but that doesn't make it less annoying.
<br>
<br>On a brighter note, this appears to kick ass so far. I checked out use Perl a while back when you were beta tested but never really made it back. Great work.

<h2>no POD?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/doug/">doug</a> on 2000-05-30T17:52:17</h3>
Slashcode doesn't support POD documentation, but
<br>since this is a Perl site, will it get added?



<h2>Re:no POD?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/pudge/">pudge</a> on 2000-05-30T18:43:14</h3>
What do you mean, support POD?



<h2>Re:no POD?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jzawodn/">jzawodn</a> on 2000-05-31T00:20:42</h3>
Probably means as a markup option (as opposed to HTML or Plain Text) when autoring comments.



<h2>Re:no POD?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/persicom/">persicom</a> on 2000-06-02T01:52:32</h3>
Actually, I'd settle for an FAQ, with only one question answered:
<br>
<br>Q) How do you actually start a new thread here?
<br>A) ???
<br>
<br>Is it the weirdly named "Submit Story" link? Sorry, I only troll slashdot, so I don't know how the software works.
<br>
<br>Thanks, sheepishly.



<h2>Re:no POD?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/pudge/">pudge</a> on 2000-06-02T12:33:03</h3>
I don't know why "Submit Story" is "weirldy named."  But yeah, I'll put that in the FAQ (I plan on getting to it in the next week or so).  Actually, I'll post a new story on that.
