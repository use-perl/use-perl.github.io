...Although many on the Zope mailing list don't want Zope "polluted" by adding support for Perl.<br/><br/>I "discovered" Zope a few weeks ago and it seems to be a really cool system.  Perhaps I've been living under a rock, but the whole idea of a "web application platform" on which you can build services, like a (slash|squish)dot, is powerful.<br/><br/>I find Zope's security model particularly powerful.  Is there anything like Zope already implemented in Perl?

You mean, aside from <a href="http://slashcode.com/" title="slashcode.com">Slash</a slashcode.com>?



<h2>Damn!</h2>

Zope was actually the reason that I was planning to learn Python. Now I'll have to wait for Python's next Killer App<nobr> <wbr></nobr><tt>;-)</tt>

<p>On a serious note: does anyone know if Zope supports Vignette StoryServer-like caching? That is to say, pages can be generated by emulating 404s, and then drop a static copy into place once they've been generated. This is really StoryServer's big feature since later hits on that page require no code be run. Many other caching systems only cache data, not pages.</p>

<p>My perception is that Slash is a weblog application.  Zope, on the other hand, is a *platform* on which to build things like slash.</p>

<p>I guess this "platform" vs. "application" thing can be confusing.  For instance, people sometimes think of Mozilla as a browser (which is an application) when it is really a platform that makes it easy to build a browser.</p>

<p>I think slash and Zope are different too; slash being an application, and Zope being a platform.</p>

You might want to take a look at <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/?group_id=2601" title="sourceforge.net">Jellybean</a sourceforge.net>. It's still very early in development, but it's coming along pretty well.

I see no significant difference between the two.  Specifically, what makes Slash an application and Zope a platform?

<p>I'll attempt a comparison of Zope and Slash, but must disclaim the expertise to do a thorough job, and I may be flat out wrong about some of these things.  I only know a little about Zope, and don't know much at all about Slash.  Although I'm pretty much a Perl zealot, I find a lot to admire about Zope.  I'm sorry if this sounds like a sales pitch...</p>

<b>Slash</b>

<ul>

<li>Slash is a weblog application written in Perl that depends on other applications (a database, a web server) to deliver it's functionality.</li>

<li>Slash is designed to do one thing (weblog), and it does it very well.</li>

<li>Slash is distributed under an open source license</li>

</ul>

<b>Zope</b>

<ul>

<li>Zope is designed to be a platform on which web applications are built.</li>

<li>Zope comes as a complete package including an object database, a web server, an ftp server, and a python (perhaps in the future a Perl...) interpreter.</li>

<li>Zope is a platform designed to make web application design simple and quick.</li>

<li>You can build new applications in Zope using Python (and soon Perl).</li>

<li>A weblog application called "squishdot" has been designed on top of Zope.  Squishdot mimicks an older version of Slash.</li>

<li>While squishdot is not as feature rich as slash, it takes less than ten minutes to install Zope and set up a squishdot site.</li>

<li>Other applications written for the Zope platform include Zwiki webs, chat applications, email applications, various threaded discussion applications, XML based collaborative applications, WebDAV based applications, many database interface/access applications and building blocks, photo albums, collaborative calendar like things, survey applications, charting and graphing applications, etc.  In other words, just about everything that's interactive on the web.</li>

<li>The Zope object database features a robust security model and a powerful versioning system.</li>

<li>Zope is designed to be administered entirely via the web.  This means it can be remotely administered as easily as locally administered.  Security features allow you to restrict administrative access by user or by domain/IP.</li>

<li>Zope is OS independent, it runs on Linux, Solaris, Windows 95/98/NT/2000 (and probably others that I'm missing).</li>

<li>Zope was originally a combination of three commercial products, but as of November 1998 is distributed under an open source license (the ZPL).</li>

</ul>

I believe that HTML::Mason has this feature.

There are many things similar but not as complete. The ones that spring to mind are:
<br>
<br>Iaijutsu - early development (working code but not released at all) http://sourceforge.net/project/?group_id=417
<br>
<br>Also HTML::Mason is popular as is HTML::Template and Template Toolkit (all on CPAN)
<br>
<br>And who knows, there are probably others...
