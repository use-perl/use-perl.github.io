From what I hear from most people, their experiences with 5.6 included 'I upgraded, I saw, I downgraded.'  I never checked it out because I heard it was insanely unstable, so I may be wrong here, but would it be viser to wait for some fixes, and possibly even for 5.7?  No matter when it comes out, I'm definitly gonna buy it, I suppose, but I hope it covers a more-stable-than-5.6 Perl.

Aside from threads, I have had no stability problems in 5.6.  Some stuff just pukes on me with use5005threads enabled.

I've tried to install DBI for 5.6, but no luck. DBI.xs threw up a lot of errors during make, and deja and the p5p mailing list shows that others experience problems as well. Is there a patch for DBI-1.13 or some other secret to get it to install?<br/><br/>BTW, does 5.6 work as the basis for mod_perl?

hmm, mebbe I'll check it out then.  Looks like there's a lot of fun stuff in there, if it works.  Threads has always been a little crunchy, hasn't it?

<h3><a href="/user/pudge/">pudge</a> on 2000-05-29T02:06:00</h3>
I had no problems at all with DBI and perl 5.6 (the perl 5.6 WITHOUT threads, that is).  And I use it quite happily with mod_perl, too (though not on a production box, yet).

Just upgraded about five minutes ago, played around a bit... looks good so far.  Glad I did it.  Hope the book is good... 400 or so new pages, wow, can't wait to see what they've added.

Does anyone have any info on why the change in authors was done?

Well I have lost count how amny hours I have spent tracking reported problems with my modules, only to find out that it was a 5.6 probelm. Now it is the first question I ask when someone reports a bug.

Heh, on Win32, threads are still, well, a bit "crashy."<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)<br> <br><br/><br/>Of course, given the black magic that was needed to make fork() work in the first place, and seeing as how they had to clone the entire interpreter, I think it's already very good.<br> <br><br/><br/>Now if only they could get alarm() working for Windows<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-P<br> <br>

While at first install 5.6 appears to have too many problems to deal with. Headbanging seems to reveal that COMPLETE removal of old versions, libraries et all, coupled with a fresh compile from source (READING the README's), seems to eliminate the bulk of what at first glance appears to be problems<br> <br>Installation on Solaris/veritas has revealed some issues but compiling perl with largefile support seems to resolve most of those issues.<br> <br>
5.6 has taught me that just because its labled 'stable' doesn't imply what I would define as 'stable', however, to make claims of being "insanely unstable" seems equally inaccurate.<br> <br><br/><br/>In regards to a 3rd Edition of the camel . . . I'll be buying it (compulsive perl book collector). I hope it's an addition to my arsenal.

In truth, I cannot comment on this, as I would likely have to resort to foul language.</p>
