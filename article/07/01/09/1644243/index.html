<p>We've cut the price for online subscriptions to <a href="http://www.theperlreview.com/">The Perl Review</a> to $7, and made the PDF-only subscription available to everyone, including subscribers in the US. People who subscribed to the web-only edition in the last couple of months will have their subscriptions extended by a year. Normal print subscription prices will stay the same as long as the Postal Service keeps their prices the same.</p>
<p>The online-only version was really something we wanted to offer to international subscribers and eventually change to a print version. After researching the possibility of printing in three different countries in the European Union, we discovered that the same thing kills it: postage to other countries. The very slight savings in postage in the EU is offset by higher printing costs for lower print runs and a lot of extra work to come out the same as sending it from the US.<br> <br>We are looking at ways to get the print copies to international customers though. We have two and a half years of back issues (10 in all) and those magically fit together into a single Global Priority Flat Rate envelope that we can send to most countries for $US9.50. That brings the price to just below the $1.11 postage to send a single copy in the US, which is the basis for our prices.<br> <br>To make that work we need to rejigger the subscriber database a bit to recognize the different subscriber model, but that's actually fun work once we have the time for it. :)</p>

<h2>Just a question...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/sigzero/">sigzero</a> on 2007-01-09T13:05:30</h3>
Why not just go PDF only and save the cost of printing and postage? Is it that most people want that copy in their hands?

If I wanted something to read online, I would just go to perl.com, perlmonks, etc.  I like having something to carry around and the neat covers wouldn't be the same in a PDF.

I've thanked Brian many of times for bringing back a printed version of a Perl magazine.<br>I wasn't to happy when TPJ was PDF only.

<h2>Which option puts the most money in your pocket?</h2>

<p>I'm about to resubscribe (I got the original issues way back when, and didn't know you started up again) and I'm in the US.</p>

<p>While the 60% offer for online-only sounds nice, I'm curious: do you make more from online-only because you don't pay for printing, or do you make more from the print version because you charge more and get a volume discount?</p>

<p>I'll happily give you the extra $11/year if it'll go to you, but if you're just going to spend it on printing I'll take the PDFs and print it myself if I need to.</p>

It's not printing that costs the most. It's the postage. The more I mail the less each peice costs to mail, so ideally everyone gets a print subscription.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
