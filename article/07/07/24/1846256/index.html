<h2>Mastering Perl or Advanced Perl Programming?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/pubcra/">pubcra</a> on 2007-07-24T19:59:08</h3>
brian,<br><br>I am a little confused. What's the difference between Mastering Perl and Advanced Perl Programming? They both seem pretty similar to me.<br><br>I am pretty comfortable with the contents of Learning Perl and Intermediate Perl and I am wondering which one of the advanced ones should I get and _why_?<br><br>Thx<br><br>pc

Mastering Perl and Advanced Perl Programming (2nd Edition) are very different books, and O'Reilly was very careful to not overlap the topics. The tables of contents should let you figure out which one covers the topics you like.<br><br>Simon covered mostly specific domains, such as unicode, databases, and templates, where Mastering Perl has a lot more basic Perl stuff in it, and is much more broad.

Getting both then. Any idea which would be better  to read first (difficulty wise)?

<p>Probably <i>Mastering Perl</i>, unless you&#8217;ve already got pretty strong Perl skills. <i>Advanced Perl Programming</i> is not as broadly applicable and not immediately relevant to every non-trivially sized Perl project, whereas <i>Mastering Perl</i>, in my understanding, is.</p>
