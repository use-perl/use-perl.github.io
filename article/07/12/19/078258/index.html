It looks like the ActiveState team has beaten me to the punch, releasing a new ActivePerl before I was able complete the new Strawberry Perl.<br> <br>This caught me totally off guard, because the last few Perl releases it's taken a few weeks before the matching ActivePerl came out, so I thought I might have a few days leeway.</p>
<p>My HOPE, of course, is that this is a positive response to competition on their behalf.<br> <br>Relatively shortly after the original Vanilla/Strawberry releases came out showing how to do MinGW integration, ActivePerl added the ability to use MinGW as well.<br> <br>Now they've improved their release timing to within 24 hours of the official tarball.<br> <br>Lets hope the positive competition continues. :)<br> <br>P.S. I've uploaded Perl::Dist 0.5 which is the major new release of the build tools I've creating Strawberry with. Hopefully this version won't blow up the CPAN Testers boxes :)</p>

It may be that Active State beat Strawberry Perl to getting Perl 5.10 out to the market, but that is in no way going to get me to switch back to Active Perl.  I would rather use 5.8.8 and still be able to use any CPAN module that switch back and have Active State dictate which modules are available to its users.<br/><br/>Just my<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.02.
