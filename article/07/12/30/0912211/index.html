This kind of remark is exactly the sort of reason why it is a good idea to ditch Subversion and move to a decent Source Control Management system.  Producing a stable branch with Subversion is not common practice, because the tools make it hard and do not support every stage of the process.

<p>I agree that Subversion's merging support has its flaws.  However, there's no point in even thinking about considering the possibility of allowing the idea of having this conversation cross your mind until there's a working and native Git port for Win32.  We have a couple of active Win32 developers, and anyone who willingly develops on that platform I will not chase away.</p>

<p>However I think of those three git is the right one to standardize on for a repository format, as it's the most efficient for that and all the other tools can work well with it.  It's also the simplest to understand, with a model sporting only four basic types - files, directories, commits and tags.  The representation of this in Perl6 is delightfully small; I used it as a model example for my <a href="http://utsl.gen.nz/talks/moose/" title="utsl.gen.nz">2006 Moose Talk</a utsl.gen.nz> at YAPC::Eu.</p>

<p>Out of curiosity, what platform are you on?  I'm still working with the perl6-internals team to figure out how to get this to properly build on my Intel MacBook.  We're getting closer, but there are still failures.</p>

<p>For those following along at home, use the following bash script I hacked together:</p> <p><blockquote> <div><tt>#!/bin/bash<br> <br>perl Configure.pl --test \<br>&nbsp; &amp;&amp; make \<br>&nbsp; &amp;&amp; cd languages/perl6/<br> <br>make \<br>&nbsp; &amp;&amp; cd<nobr> <wbr></nobr>../..<br> <br>make pbc_to_c \<br>&nbsp; &amp;&amp;<nobr> <wbr></nobr>./pbc_to_c languages/perl6/perl6.pbc \<br>&nbsp; &amp;&amp;<nobr> <wbr></nobr>./perl6 languages/perl6/t/01-sanity/01-tap.t</tt></div> </blockquote>  <p>I haven't fixed it for the final line which runs 01-tap.t because the latest build fails on <tt>perl Configure --test</tt>.  Note that the <tt>--test</tt> switch verifies that we can actually configure things, a tip shared with me on the perl6-internals list.</p>

<p>If you're really paranoid, you can do this to rebuild cleanly every time:</p> <p><blockquote> <div><tt>#!/bin/bash<br> <br>PARROTROOT=/path/to<br> <br>rm -fr "$PARROTROOT/parrot"<br>cd $PARROTROOT<br> <br>svn co https://svn.perl.org/parrot/trunk parrot \<br>&nbsp; &amp;&amp; cd parrot<br> <br>perl Configure.pl --test \<br>&nbsp; &amp;&amp; make \<br>&nbsp; &amp;&amp; cd languages/perl6/<br> <br>make \<br>&nbsp; &amp;&amp; cd<nobr> <wbr></nobr>../..<br> <br>make pbc_to_c \<br>&nbsp; &amp;&amp;<nobr> <wbr></nobr>./pbc_to_c languages/perl6/perl6.pbc \<br>&nbsp; &amp;&amp;<nobr> <wbr></nobr>./perl6 languages/perl6/t/01-sanity/01-tap.t</tt></div> </blockquote>  <p>Just make sure that you set <tt>$PARROTROOT</tt> to the correct directory for your system.</p>

For the average user, <code>perl Configure.pl</code> will suffice, <i>i.e.,</i> you can omit the <code>--test</code>.
<p>
The <code>--test</code> option is something which those working on the configuration and build systems should run, but is not necessary for language developers or those (like myself!) who will be using chromatic's program to run Perl6 program for the first time.

<p>That <em>probably</em> means that linking against libparrot fails, whether it's picking up the wrong file or linking incorrectly or not exporting symbols properly.  Can you post the contents of pbc_to_exe.pir (generated in the root directory) to parrot-porters@perl.org?</p>

<p>I'm not a Mac OS X hacker, but if we can find someone who knows how linking works on that platform, we should be able to fix these problems.</p>

<p>There are some building problems on Darwin/PPC that need help from someone who understands linking on that platform, and there are some questions about the Windows build (but a patch).  If we can fix those and the caveats about PBC locations, I think we can support this, even if it's not the permanent technique for making a <code>perl6</code> binary.</p>
