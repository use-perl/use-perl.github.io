<p>The Perl 6 design team met by phone on 28 November 2007.  Larry, Allison,
Patrick, Will, Jesse, Richard, and chromatic attended.</p>
<p><p> <strong>Larry:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>recovering from Thanksgiving; took the week off</li>
<li>working on getting the State of the Onion ready for Perl.com</li>
<li>gave a talk at work on the history of Perl in terms of development, revision control, et cetera</li>
<li>stuff you guys all know</li>
<li>I had to organize it in a way to present it to work</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Jesse:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>could the slides stand alone?</li>
<li>other people not tied into the community might find them interesting</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Larry:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>mostly just reiterating what's out there</li>
<li>continued to fiddle with the longest token parser</li>
<li>just want to keep the cache loaded as long as possible</li>
<li>I feel like I'm getting my brain back now from the last month's sleeplessness</li>
<li>nothing exciting coming up soon in terms of Perl</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Allison:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>I have always-on ADSL now in my flat</li>
<li>this week I've been doing a first implementation of the concurrency PDD</li>
<li>necessary for the events deadline for Saturday</li>
<li>adding in a few details to the concurrency PDD</li>
<li>there are some pieces I didn't realize we needed until I started coding</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Jesse:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>how much is threading and how much is the more interesting models?</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Allison:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>it includes what some older systems would call threading</li>
<li>it also includes Intel's TBB</li>
<li>we have multiple concurrency models: exceptions, events, async IO</li>
<li>there's one centeral concurrency model</li>
<li>it's more modern than people would call the classic threading model</li>
<li>that's why the name is "concurrency", to escape the threads-only box</li>
<li>I'll finish off the events PDD next</li>
<li>then think about the multiple dispatch PDD and implementation for January</li>
<li>have to work on some talks for January</li>
<li>probably need to work on the Python implementation for that</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Patrick:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>that's part of my grant specifically</li>
<li>I planned to get it started and back to its current point with NQP</li>
<li>you can pick it up from there</li>
<li>I'll probably present that to the local Python group again</li>
<li>it'll be a bigger example of NQP that's not Perl 6</li>
<li>that's easier</li>
<li>there are also a couple of local people interested in hacking on it who didn't like the looks of all-PIR right away</li>
<li>given that I wrote the original Pynie in eight hours, I think the new version shouldn't take too long to put together</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Allison:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>I'll be speaking about Parrot at Microsoft in March</li>
<li>it's the weekly DLR meeting</li>
<li>John Lam's putting out a broader invite in the company as a whole</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Patrick:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>published a roadmap for the Perl 6 compiler</li>
<li>getting feedback on that</li>
<li>basically finished the AST implementation for now</li>
<li>basically finished NQP for now</li>
<li>posted an example of driving SDL from NQP</li>
<li>reimplemented abc in NQP</li>
<li>the only PIR code it has is for subroutines that are trickier in NQP than in PIR (for now)</li>
<li>they're all basically short five-line subroutines</li>
<li>added a bunch of comments to the grammar yesterday</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Jesse:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>the things that are easier in PIR than NQP, does that indicate a lack in NQP?</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Patrick:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>they're primitives</li>
<li>to do an add</li>
<li>NQP can do one, but it's just actually easier to write the code that does it because it's straight to go to the right opcode there</li>
<li>those kinds of things</li>
<li>basic, built-in primitives are easier to write in PIR</li>
<li>once you get above that layer, it's much easier to write in NQP</li>
<li>there are 256 lines in all of the transformations for abc</li>
<li>half of that is comments</li>
<li>working on some Parrot cleanups</li>
<li>next up is reimplementing Perl 6 in terms of NQP</li>
<li>that shouldn't take too long</li>
<li>maybe two or three days, but I have some other work to do</li>
<li>I don't want to lose my good momentum here</li>
<li>trying to keep my journal up to date daily</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>c:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>not a lot of progress, just some cleanups</li>
<li>if anyone working on a big task has some smaller bits to break off, I'll do them</li>
<li>I'm happy to write the compiler tutorial for you, Patrick</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Jerry:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>glad to be away for a month then come back with nothing on my plate</li>
<li>but I'm looking forward to writing the Perl 6 compiler with Patrick</li>
<li>possibly working on a tutorial, the abc one</li>
<li>might be able to do that one</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Patrick:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>I already wrote the comments for the transformation</li>
<li>we could use some explanation in the grammar</li>
<li>people look at that</li>
<li>it's not always clear even if you've read S05</li>
<li>a common question is "What's the difference between <code>rule</code> and <code>token</code>?"</li>
<li>I put a little cheat sheet in the comments</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Will:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>doing a lot of cleanup this week, especially in <em>languages/</em> </li>
<li>cleaned up a lot of cruft</li>
<li>trying to get the RT queue in a more manageable state</li>
<li>nowhere near complete, but Patrick and I have made a dent in the past few days</li>
<li>I had some stuff in hand, but chromatic's already working on it</li>
<li>I can focus on converting some other languages, like APL</li>
<li>also want to get Patrick's journal added to Planet Parrot so they can see his work</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Richard:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>a bit of additional work after the Mozilla Foundation grant</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Jesse:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>CJ Collier mentioned interest in hacking Perl 6 on .NET</li>
<li>not sure where that's going to end up</li>
<li>it's nice to have someone hacking on it to see if it'll work though rather than assuming it won't</li>
