This is an update on the status of Perl 6 on Parrot development as
of December 4, 2007.
</p>

<h2>Progress in November 2007</h2>

<p>
The last report was published in November as a "<a href="http://svn.perl.org/parrot/trunk/languages/perl6/ROADMAP">road
map</a>" for continued development of the Perl 6 on Parrot compiler
(perl6). Since then we've basically been following the steps outlined
on the road map and we are seeing significant progress on the
compiler.
</p>
<p>
The big news for this
month is that we are now using a lightweight Perl 6 translator
("NQP") to implement the translation components of the perl6
compiler.  Making this transition means we are currently failing
quite a few tests in the test suite, but Jerry Gay and I are
rapidly cleaning those up.  This is also a good place for others to
join in if you're interested&mdash;see "How to hack and contribute"
below.
</p></p>
<p><p>
So, as mentioned in the previous status report, the
perl6 compiler has four major components:  the parse grammar,
specialized parsing routines, the ast transformation, and the
runtime support.  Now that we're using NQP for the ast
transformation, this means that the bulk of the compiler&mdash;the parse
grammar and the ast transformation&mdash;are written using Perl 6
syntax.  If you want to take a quick peek at these without
downloading Parrot, they're currently available at:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
    <a href="http://svn.perl.org/parrot/trunk/languages/perl6/src/parser/grammar.pg">http://svn.perl.org/parrot/trunk/languages/perl6/src/
parser/grammar.pg</a> </li>

<li>    <a href="http://svn.perl.org/parrot/trunk/languages/perl6/src/parser/actions.pm">http://svn.perl.org/parrot/trunk/languages/perl6/src/
parser/actions.pm</a> </li>
</ul>
<p>
We're also looking into the possibility
of rewriting much of the runtime support as Perl 6.  One of the
significant things we added this past week is the ability to embed
PIR code directly inside subroutines compiled using NQP.  This has
turned out to be extremely useful for development&mdash;we use Perl 6
syntax for most things, but can drop in and out of PIR whenever we
(temporarily) need it.
</p>
<p>
Another major item completed
yesterday is a new set of routines for parsing and transforming
Perl 6's quote syntax.  Of course, the primary reference for this
is <a href="http://svn.pugscode.org/pugs/src/perl6/STD.pm">the STD.pm grammar</a>, and if you take a look you'll see that
it's a fairly complex component because of the many options,
interpolation forms, and extensions that are available.  It will
likely be a while before we have all of the pieces to implement
quotes exactly as STD.pm has them, so in the meantime I've written
up a couple of parse subroutines (in PIR) that handle most of the
quoting forms and options we're likely to encounter, including
interpolation.  The only major forms not available at present are
the &#171;...&#187; and heredocs, and the &#171;...&#187; form is
waiting only on some Unicode fixes in PGE and Parrot
(RT#48108).
</p>
<p>
While I'm on the topic of STD.pm and parsing:  I do
need to compliment Larry, Damian, and others who have been
building STD.pm and the language specification for the
improvements made in the language syntax over the past year or so,
such as in quoting.  The version of Perl 6 we have now is
*much* easier to parse&mdash;by both humans and machines&mdash;than what
we had a year ago.
</p>
<h2>Where things are headed next</h2>
<p>
There are two major items
we will be focusing on for the next couple of weeks.  The first
will be continued development of the perl6 compiler&mdash;getting it
back to passing the tests it was previously passing, as well as
adding new features and tests.  Progress on this is already being
made and should accelerate nicely.
</p>
<p>
The other area of focus
will be in writing a lot of prose&mdash;documents that will help new
developers figure out where things are and how it's all put
together.  For instance, we really need a "getting started"
document for perl6 that describes how to build the compiler, how to
invoke it, and how/where to report bugs and patches.  Much of
this information is currently in the ROADMAP, but would
probably be better placed in a getting started document.  We also
want a developer's roadmap of some sort.
</p>
<p>
I'm also planning
to publish a "developer's glossary" somewhere to identify many of
the various terms that get thrown around in development (PCT, PGE,
NQP, STD.pm, regex, PAST, etc.).
</p>
<p>
Also on the horizon we will
start looking at reviewing and possibly restructuring the Perl 6
test suite, and coming up with a mechanism to quickly
update/publish the status of various language features in the
compiler (hopefully with references back to the language
spec).
</p>
<h2>How to hack and contribute</h2>
<p>
If you're interested
in hacking on the compiler, this is a unique time to start getting
involved.  There are a lot of relatively easy features to be tested
and added, and the discussions are about the basics of the compiler
and of relatively easy features to be tested and added, and the
discussions are about the basics of the compiler and how it's put
together.
</p>
<p>
As mentioned above, we need a good "getting started"
document, but for now here's a quick overview.  First, you'll want
to download and build Parrot&mdash;instructions for this are at <a href="http://www.parrotcode.org/">http://www.parrotcode.org/</a>.
Once you have Parrot built, you can change to the languages/perl6/
directory and type 'make' to build the perl6 compiler.  Then use
the command
</p> <p><blockquote> <div> <tt> $ parrot perl6.pbc hello.pl</tt> </div> </blockquote>  <p>
to run
a hello.pl program (written in Perl 6).
</p>
<p>
To learn more about how compilers are being structured in Parrot in
general, I recommend looking at <a href="http://svn.perl.org/parrot/trunk/languages/abc/">languages/abc/</a>. This is an implementation of the bc(1) language using the same
tools we're using to implement perl6, with the advantage of being a
lot simpler language than Perl 6. We've also tried to put a lot of
comments into the source files for abc that explain what each
component is doing.
</p>
<p>
After that,
you can look at perl6's source code files and running some tests
(either from the suite or files that you build).  If you want to
see perl6's intermediate compilation results, use <tt>--target=parse</tt>,
<tt>--target=past</tt>, or <tt>--target=pir</tt> immediately after the "perl6.pbc"
part.
</p>
<p>
In the next couple of weeks we'll be writing up the
documents that describe the details of the compiler implementation,
but in the meantime please ask us questions!  We'll use the
questions to help author the documents.  The perl6 and Parrot
developers tend to hang out on irc.perl.org/#parrot, and questions
are welcome on the <a href="http://dev.perl.org/perl6/lists/">perl6-compiler mailing list</a>.
</p>
<p>
If you
find a bug or have a suggested patch, send it
to perl6-bug@perl.org.  Please use the moniker [PATCH],
[BUG], or [TODO] (including the brackets) at the start of the
subject so that RT can appropriately tag the item.
</p></p>

<h2>Great progress report</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/cbrandtbuffalo/">cbrandtbuffalo</a> on 2007-12-06T12:36:21</h3>
Thanks for the complete and informative progress reports, especially the additional information to help people get involved. I know it can be time-consuming to write up these sorts of reports, but it's really important for giving visibility into the process.
