<p>Devel::PerlySense has been getting quite a bit of (apparently
well-deserved) attention lately.  As the author of <a href="http://search.cpan.org/src/SEANO/Sepia-0.95_03/Sepia.html">Sepia</a>,
a long-existing but apparently little-used Emacs Perl development
module, I thought now would be a good time to post a diary here.  For
those of you who tried an earlier version, Sepia is considerably more
stable and better-documented in versions 0.9x, but needs more users to acquire polish.

<p>Sepia aims to make Emacs the kind of interactive development
environment for Perl that it already is for Emacs Lisp.  This involves a
number of components:
</p> <ul>
<li>Interactive evaluation: Supports both a REPL and a scratch buffer.
The REPL uses the Perl debugger hooks to allow breakpoints and
recovery from <code>die</code>, and Devel::LexAlias to inspect and
change lexicals.</li>
<li>Source navigation: Finds definitions, callers, and callees.  This is
supported by querying the running Perl process rather than through
PPI.</li>
<li>Documentation: Displays minibuffer documentation (eldoc) for
builtins and some user functions, and supports POD browsing.</li>
<li>Completion: Completes variable, function, and module names based
on the running Perl process.</li>
</ul>

Not having used Devel::PerlySense, I won't try to make a detailed
comparison, but my impression is that Devel::PerlySense is geared
toward off-line development (uses PPI, has a class browser, etc.),
while Sepia is geared toward on-line development (supports interaction, value
inspection, debugging).  So give both a try, and see which style suits you best.</p>

<h2>Installing developer releases</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jplindstrom/">jplindstrom</a> on 2007-12-16T21:23:24</h3>
Since there are only developer releases available, the usual cpan maneuvers don't work. The working incantation is:<p><blockquote> <div><tt>cpan SEANO/Sepia-0.95_03.tar.gz</tt></div> </blockquote> Then the elisp files can be found in the<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.cpan directory, but I found it easier to just wget them into my elisp directory from the list in the <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Sepia/MANIFEST" title="cpan.org">MANIFEST</a cpan.org> file.<br>

Ugh, sorry about that.  I just uploaded a version 0.96 that's identical to 0.95_03, but should avoid the cpan hassle.  Unfortunately I can't think of a good platform-independent way to install the elisp files and HTML documentation, so people still need to do that by hand.

In PerlySense, I install the<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.el files next to the<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.pm files, then <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Devel-PerlySense/lib/Devel/PerlySense.pm#Emacs_installation" title="cpan.org">load the elisp in<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.emacs </a cpan.org>by asking a Perl script where the<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.el files are.<br>

Thanks.  That may be the best option, but it's sort of unsatisfying (more so when I install the info pages).  Another option might be to prompt (with defaults) for the various paths in Makefile.PL.

<p>It's amazing that software as old as Emacs doesn't have some automatic way to install packages.</p>
