<p>Yesterday I posted a <a href="__SLASHLINK__" sect="mainpage" sid="07/12/15/1931244" sn="article" tid="32">GreaseMonkey script to add a CPAN Dependencies link to search.cpan.org</a>.

<p>The only problem with that is that FireFox is not my main browser. I tend to use FireFox for web development (FireBug++) and Safari for general surfing. Theoretically you can use GreaseMonkey scripts in Safari using <a href="http://creammonkey.sourceforge.net/">CreamMonkey</a> - but I couldn't get that to play nicely with Leopard.</p>

<p>So I've released <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/HTTP-Proxy-GreaseMonkey/">HTTP::Proxy::GreaseMonkey</a> which builds on BooK's excellent <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/HTTP-Proxy/">HTTP::Proxy</a> to provide a local proxy that functions like GreaseMonkey.</p>

<p>Version 0.01 of HTTP::Proxy::GreaseMonkey has no support for the GM_* utility functions that the real GreaseMonkey provides - but it works well enough to support my CPAN dependencies user script and probably quite a few other GM scripts. Suggestions are welcome. Suggestions with patches even more so.</p></p>

<p>It also works with Yanick's <a href="http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/14810" title="userscripts.org">RtSeverityOrdering</a userscripts.org>. Anyone got any other Perl related GreaseMonkey scripts I can try it with?</p>



<h2>GM_xmlhttpRequest and other impossibilities</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Aristotle/">Aristotle</a> on 2007-12-17T06:36:23</h3>
<p>As far as I can say, this approach can&#8217;t ever work <em>really</em> right, I&#8217;m afraid. Security is a big issue with Javascript, and the origin of code and content (in terms of DNS domain, mostly) plays a big role. There are tight limitations on what is permitted to code when things with different origins mix.</p>

<p>Now Greasemonkey runs scripts in the context of the page; however, it gives them access to functions that run within the browser&#8217;s local security context. That&#8217;s what&#8217;s special about <code>GM_xmlhttpRequest</code>: it runs in local security context and can therefore make requests for content in <em>any</em> domain, whereas XMLHttpRequest objects instantiated by remotely loaded code are restricted to sending requests to the domain the code was loaded from.</p>

<p>Sure, then, you can inject script into a page via the proxy to provide a <code>GM_xmlhttpRequest</code> function that replicates the bona fide <code>GM_xmlhttpRequest</code>&#8217;s interface. But the browser won&#8217;t know it&#8217;s trusted code and so won&#8217;t allow it to make requests anywhere else than where that proxy-injected code appears to have come from. Mashup user scripts that bring together data from disparate domains therefore won&#8217;t work.</p>

<p>So quite a few scripts can&#8217;t work &#8211; the more complex, the more likely to fail. And since the point of HTTP::Proxy::GreaseMonkey is that the browser knows nothing of its presence, that would seem to me to be unfixable.</p>

<p>Of course, a lot of scripts still <em>will</em> work, which makes the module worthwhile even if it&#8217;s unlikely to ever be an equivalent replacement for the browser extension(s).</p>

<p>Yes, but I have a proxy... That means I can write a  GM_xmlhttpRequest with a specially formed URL which appears to fetch from the current domain but which the proxy rewrites to fetch from the intended domain.</p>

<p>http://this.domain.com/&lt;some long string&gt;/intended.com/something.xml --&gt;</p>

<p>http://intended.com/something.xml</p>

<p>That's my theory anyway - I haven't implemented it yet. Can you see any problems with that? Obviously I'm opening up an XSS hole so I'd need to make sure that the GM_ functions weren't accessible to the page's original JavaScript. I think that can be achieved with a nested scope around the injected GM Javascript.</p>

<p>Nice lateral thinking there!</p>

<p>It almost sounds too easy to be right, but at first glance I can&#8217;t see anything wrong with that. I&#8217;d use HTTP Auth credentials rather than a long string in the URI, but that&#8217;s just a quibble.</p>

I've just released 0.03 which supports GM_xmlhttpRequest to arbitrary sites. I'm afraid it uses a long arbitrary string in the URL to alert the proxy at the moment. I'll have a think about using auth credentials instead - it certainly sounds cleaner.
