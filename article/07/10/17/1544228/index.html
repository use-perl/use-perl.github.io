<p>With <a href="http://svn.ali.as/">my repository</a> working again and <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?PPI">PPI</a> 1.200 release, the next project I hope to catch up on is <a href="http://vanillaperl.org/">Strawberry Perl</a>. I think this has taken on particular importance now because of the Perl Survey results, which showed that about 50% of Perl users have used Windows in the last year, but only 5% of Perl users ONLY used Windows.</p>
<p>When comparing Strawberry Perl and ActivePerl it's fairly clear to me that ActivePerl is the best distribution for Windows-only developers and Strawberry is better for cross-platform developers.<br> <br>I'd just never realised how dominant the cross-platform case was compared to the Windows-only case. I'd always thought that the Windows-only case was dominant.<br> <br>Before I changed jobs recently and got distracted by writing the repository manager, my previous "train project" was to update and refactor the modules (Perl::Dist::Strawberry and friends) that are used to generate the Vanilla and Strawberry Perl distributions<br> <br>I've managed to remove most of the bit-rot and I've cleaned up the codebase a bit.<br> <br>To make things a bit easier for myself, I've moved the modules into my repository for now, and I'll be starting incremental releases (of the modules).<br> <br>From there, I want to try and get another (beta) release of Strawberry Perl 5.8.8 out before 5.10.0.<br> <br>I'd also like to try and upgrade the Vanilla/Strawberry Perl website at the same time, as I've had a few people emailing me asking if it was dead when that is anything but the situation.</p>

<h2>W00t!</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jk2addict/">jk2addict</a> on 2007-10-17T14:42:53</h3>
I just installed XP under Parallels last night to do win32 perl testing, and installed SP again. Thank god for Strawberry Perl.



<h2>How do we get there again?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/markstinson/">markstinson</a> on 2007-10-17T19:41:45</h3>
There might be a URL typo. I clicked the link for <a href="http://vanillaperl.org/" title="vanillaperl.org">http://vanillaperl.org/</a vanillaperl.org> and received a not found. A Google search for strawberry perl revealed <a href="http://vanillaperl.com/" title="vanillaperl.com">http://vanillaperl.com/</a vanillaperl.com> instead.<br><br>I look forward to trying Strawberry out. I usually have to cross develop under Cygwin.<br><br>Later, Mark S.<br><br>BTW, Thanks for the Tiny Modules too. Can I also cast a vote for a Tiny JSON module?



<h2>Where the energy has been</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/dagolden/">dagolden</a> on 2007-10-18T02:46:38</h3>
<p>I've mentioned this in some emails when asked about  Vanilla and Strawberry Perl, but it probably is worth repeating here...</p>

<p>Strawberry Perl has led to a substantial shift for many people from installing modules in PPM form to installing directly from CPAN.  That means that a <i>lot</i> more test suites are being run on MSWin32 and a lot more bugs are seeing the light of day.</p>

<p>Much of the energy of project participants in the last year or so has been going to gradually squashing these bugs.  You can see some of the activity on the <a href="http://win32.perl.org/wiki/index.php?title=Vanilla_Perl_Problem_Modules" title="perl.org">Vanilla Perl Problem Modules</a perl.org> page.</p>

<p>The other side effect was that I was inspired to write <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?CPAN::Reporter" title="cpan.org">CPAN::Reporter</a cpan.org> to make it easy for anyone with CPAN.pm to automatically submit test reports to CPAN Testers and to authors.  This helped re-energize smoke testing on Win32 -- flushing out even more Win32 bugs.</p>

<p>So overall, while Strawberry Perl itself hasn't changed in over a year, the quality and capabilities of Perl on Win32 have been steadily improving.</p>

<p>-- dagolden</p>

<h2>Wither 5.10?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/grinder/">grinder</a> on 2007-10-22T08:34:00</h3>
<p>David,</p>

<p>May I put in a request for a 5.10 version of Strawberry Perl, even though it's not yet released? Or otherwise, how can the kids try this at home?</p>

<p>What do I need, over and above the blead source, to compile it and produce my own, say, Mango Perl on Win32?</p>

At the moment you need to wait for a little bit for me to get the refactor of Perl::Dist finished, as there's no sane way to build atm... but that shouldn't be too far away.<br>

<h2>Strawberry  ActiveState</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jplindstrom/">jplindstrom</a> on 2007-10-18T13:17:23</h3>
Not true.<br><br>I'd say that the Strawberry Perl distro is much  better than ActiveState (I almost said "vastly", but that would be unfair).<br><br>AS is bearable if you have Visual Studio installed, and know a few extra PPM repos that you routinely set up on new machines.<br><br>But when I tried out Vanilla and Strawberry Perl I was pleasantly surprised. Things just... worked! I had less problems installing some things on Windows than on Ubuntu (how. about. that!).<br><br>If this experience can be verified by other Windows users (and I think it can), you should consider doing something to remove the "beta" label on the distro to avoid scaring people off.<br><br>There is nothing to be scared of. This is the better alternative. Kudos!

My actual subject was "Strawberry &gt; ActiveState", but that got clobbered somehow...

It's a "bug" (pudge may not actually consider it a bug).<br><br>SlashCode does not escape comment headers.

The main reason we kept the label on was that I wanted to be really conservative with a distribution.<br>



<h2>Re:Strawberry ActiveState</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Alias/">Alias</a> on 2007-10-19T04:23:42</h3>
The thing is, if you have pure-Win32 programmers that never touch Unix, they tend to be using Visual Studio and so on already. They have a familiarity with Visual Studio and the Win32 ways of working,<br><br>In this environment, the better and less confusing environment for them does seem to be ActiveState.

I've found the opposite. I use Visual Studio.NET at $work, all day, every day so I'd consider that being a pure win32 programmer. But that's now in the age of<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.NET, where you don't have to know a lick of C to do real things, like http modules, services, etc.<br><br>Back in the Visual Studio 6 days, one could compile a perl module [mod_perl.. oi] even if you didn't know C [as painful as it may have been to get studio to play along], and you could be fairly certain that the modules would work just fine.<br><br>When<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.NET 1.0, 1.1, 2.0 came along, everytime I try compiling in VS.NET, I have a good chance of getting something that isn't quite stable because AS perl might have been compiled with VC6, while I'm in VS.NET compiling XS. IF you're a hardcore C person, maybe this isn't an issue for you to fix. For just a full time VS.NET user, forget it.<br><br>All in all, a nightmare sometimes for no apparent reason. I gladly use strawberry perl because I know it doesn't come with all the insanity of guessing which framework/dlls the module is actually going to compile against and whether it wll work with AS perl or not.
