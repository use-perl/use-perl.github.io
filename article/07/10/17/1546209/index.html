<h1>Crypt::Rijndael now works on Solaris/x86</h1>

<div class="span8">
<p>It's looks like I've solved the Crypt::Rijndael problems thanks to <a href="__SLASHLINK__" cid="58312" sect="" sid="37216" sn="comments" tid="34">a patch from djberg96</a>. It looks like some systems had an integer overflow problem with:<p><blockquote> <div> <tt>0xff &lt;&lt; 24</tt> </div> </blockquote> So djberg96 changed that to use an unsigned int by attaching the <tt>U</tt> to the end of the number. I think I used to know that.<p><blockquote> <div> <tt>0xffU &lt;&lt; 24</tt> </div> </blockquote> Additionally, I cast some return values from the XS stuff to <tt>(UINT *)</tt> to ensure that everything treated them as unsigned ints.</p>
<p>I hadn't been able to play with Solaris since Sourceforge's compile farm went away, but after <a href="__SLASHLINK__" cid="58318" sect="" sid="37216" sn="comments" tid="34">elwarren suggested finding a QEMU image of Solaris</a> and a bit of googling on that, I remembered that somewhere on my bookshelf I had Solaris 10 media from their initial offer when they made it open source. It was still shrink-wrapped even. It took me a day to install that because I actually did it three times before I realized that even though I installed the 32-bit version, <a href="http://kb.vmware.com/selfservice/microsites/search.do?language=en_US&amp;cmd=displayKC&amp;externalId=1975">Solaris was assuming it was 64-bit at boot time</a>, causing panics. I have to fiddle with the VMware image by editing a file in the Mac OS X package (control click on the package, choose "Show Package Contents"). I found the <tt>.vmx</tt> file and added:<p><blockquote> <div> <tt>monitor_control.disable_longmode = 1</tt> </div> </blockquote> After that I had a bootable and fully useable Solaris 10 for x86. I spent half a day installing almost everything from <a href="http://www.sunfreeware.com/">Sunfreeware.com</a> while I added a minicpan.<br> <br>Two days after I started, I was able to fetch <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/bdfoy/Crypt-Rijndael-1.04_03/">Crypt-Rijndael-1.04_03</a>, run a clean make with no  warnings, and then run the tests with the latest RT test cases passing.<br> <br>Now I have a decent Solaris 10 virtual machine on which I can test things (although not with suncc or anything SPARC). It's on an external disk, so I can bring it to conferences to share with anyone who wants it. Anyone got anything good to trade? :)</p>

<h2>NetBSD/vax ?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/AndyArmstrong/">AndyArmstrong</a> on 2007-10-17T20:09:26</h3>
On the way to getting VMS running I installed NetBSD/vax under simh-vax - which runs fine on Mac OS via MacPorts. I haven't managed to get simh to bridge to the Mac's network yet.<br><br>I also have Parallels images for XP ( * 3 ), OpenSolaris, FreeBSD, Fiesty and OLPC on my MPB. It's pretty neat - you can basically carry around a whole smoke farm in your backpack<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

Oh and I've just built RPCemu under Mac OS so once I grab the ROMs out of my old RiscPC I should be about to run RISC OS Perl too.

Does this mean you could run HP-UX? That's another area I'd like to test this module.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

<h3><a href="/user/AndyArmstrong/">AndyArmstrong</a> on 2007-10-17T21:10:53</h3>
Yeah, I guess so<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br/><br/>I don't *have* HP-UX.

You can sign up for the HP test drive program and test it out there.
<p>
www.testdrive.hp.com
</p><p>
Includes HP-UX, OpenVMS, Tru64, FreeBSD, and various Linux flavors.</p>

Yeah, I have a Testdrive account but it doesn't seem to be working at the moment. I'm waiting for word from HP support.<br/><br/>But I quite like the idea of being able to carry a little VAX around locally<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

Excellent, I have a test drive account now and I've tested the module under the below situation (and it passes all of the tests<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:).
