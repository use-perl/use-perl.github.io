<p>Now that some of us have <a href="__SLASHLINK__" sect="mainpage" sid="07/09/11/0714218" sn="article" tid="34">added our Gravatars to CPAN</a> I thought it'd be fun (and perhaps a little scary) to collect all the available mugshots in one place.

<p>We're disappointingly white and male - but who knew how damn fine we'd look as a group? Somebody should organise a naked calendar photo shoot next. People would pay lots of money not to see that.</p></p>

Now we need a mash up that shows the mugs of everyone whose module is in your application.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

But not naked, right?

My <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/miyagawa/Acme-Module-Authors-0.01/lib/Acme/Module/Authors.pm" title="cpan.org">Acme::Module::Authors</a cpan.org> would be a good start. I could probably just change the output to an HTML so you can embed to your application template somewhere..

Application template?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br/><br/>It's a crufty little script that uses HTML::Tiny to generate the markup and it's currently run using AndyCron (i.e. whenever I remember<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

By the way, if anyone wants to play the script that does it is in the examples subdir of <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/andya/Parallel-Iterator/" title="cpan.org">Parallel::Iterator</a cpan.org>.

How did you decide which mugshots to include?

<h3><a href="/user/AndyArmstrong/">AndyArmstrong</a> on 2007-10-15T08:09:57</h3>
That's all I could find - I just go through the authors looking for all of them. Did I miss someone?



<blockquote>

<h2>Re:Who?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jjore/">jjore</a> on 2007-10-20T06:29:32</h3>
Er, you missed me, for one. I assume you missed others.

<h3><a href="/user/AndyArmstrong/">AndyArmstrong</a> on 2007-10-20T08:57:26</h3>
Ah - your face is a GIF<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br/><br/>I didn't check for gifs. Have now, you're there.

<h2>Name that face</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/grinder/">grinder</a> on 2007-10-15T12:21:42</h3>
<p>I tried to see how many people I could name. I can name 14 people, and three or four more faces I recognise from YAPCs.</p>

<p>I was rather surprised to discover how many people had gone to the effort of creating a gravatar. Impressive.</p>



<blockquote>

<h2>Re:Name that face</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/cog/">cog</a> on 2007-10-15T14:20:55</h3>
As the list is right now, I know 23 of those people personally.

<h3><a href="/user/barbie/">barbie</a> on 2007-10-15T16:25:09</h3>
<p>And I took 3 of the photos!</p>

And they didn't even credit you!<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
