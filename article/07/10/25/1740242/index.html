<div class="span8">
<p><p> <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Test-Distribution">Test::Distribution </a> is probably the most widely used of all the Perl modules that I've developed. It's certainly the only one that I know of that has been mentioned in an O'Reilly book.</p>
<p>
Over the last couple of years (mainly ever since my wife and I moved out of the parents and gained the responsibility of maintaining our own household) I haven't been able to give it the attention it needed. I'm hoping that will change over the next few years, but I've hoped that several times in the past too...
</p>
<p>
I'm interested in people's views on what I should do with T::D. Some ideas:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Just pick off where I left off. Start going through the rt bugs and look to adding support for Module::Build in particular</li>
<li>Deprecate the module in favour of _____</li>
<li>Try and merge with the Kwailitie/CPANTS etc. tools out there which attack a similar domain but from a different angle</li>
<li>Spend my time on a different project

<p>
It'd be really good to hear from people that still use Test::Distribution and would appreciate me coming out from hibernation.
</p> </li> </ul></p>

<h2>More features</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/srezic/">srezic</a> on 2007-10-25T20:30:05</h3>
More checks I can think of, especially when preparing a distribution for CPAN upload:
<ul>
<li>check if the author has the namespace permissions on all modules</li>
<li>check if all module versions are properly incremented, if necessary</li>
</ul>

Some good ideas there. Thanks.<br/><br/>Do you actually use T::D atm?<br/><br/>That's the first thing I want to establish - if I make the effort of picking it up again will people use the changes!

Let go of the baby...<br><br>Get it into a publically-facing repository, give commit rights to anyone that wants it.<br><br>I notice Test::Distribution is not reliable dependency, it has a ton of CPAN Testers failures. The first step is probably to make it safe to depend on.

Seconded.

Yes, that is the first thing I'm planning on doing - moving the source to my sagar-r-shah sourceforge project  [I'm sure you can guess who I nicked the idea from<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)]<br/><br/>I disagree with your comments about T::D being a reliable dependency, but I'm not going to get into a debate about that at this stage.

Test::Distribution 1.26 had 14 failures out of 161 test reports. That's less than 9%. I'm willing to bet that a few of those failures will be duds rather than than actual issues with Test::Distribution.<br/><br/>I certainly wouldn't describe that as a "ton".<br/><br/>Test::Distribution only has 4 rt tickets and none of those are major issues, so I would hope that on reflection you will reconsider your aspersion of it not being a reliable dependency.

<h2>You developed Test::Distribution?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/hanekomu/">hanekomu</a> on 2007-10-26T10:42:09</h3>
<p>Sorry, I'm confused. Test::Distribution was originally created by me and is now maintained by Sagar R. Shah, see <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Test-Distribution/" title="cpan.org">its page on search.cpan.org</a cpan.org>. Its "Changes" file also mentions you only because I got the idea for the module from one of your posts on use.perl.org in 2002.</p>

<p>Am I missing something?</p>

<p>Oh, brian d foy didn't write that piece, he just posted it.</p>


<p>My bad. Nothing to see here, move on.</p>

If you want to put it up for adoption, post on perl.module-authors.  I've adopted a couple of other people's modules.  I also spoke on the topic of adoption of CPAN modules at YAPC::NA::2006 in Chicago, so I can offer tips to potential adoptive parent(s).

I'm still interested in T::D if others are. The first thing I plan to do is to move it to a public repository.<br/><br/>I've just been having problems getting sourceforge svn to pick up all the history because I don't want to import my entire svn repository just some parts and the filtering doesn't seem to help.<br/><br/>I think there are some other modules I own which I'm less likely to do anything with (Business::Billing::TMobile::UK as I'm against the company's support of terrorism - long story)  so maybe those I will put up for adoption!
