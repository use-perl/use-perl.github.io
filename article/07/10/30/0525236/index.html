<p>The Perl 6 design team met by phone on 24 October 2007.  Larry, Allison, Patrick, Jerry, Will, Jesse, and chromatic attended.</p>
<p><p> <strong>Larry:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>mostly under the weather this week for one reason or another</li>
<li>most of my progress has been thinking, with not much to show for it</li>
<li>difficult to type with tendinitis and one arm in a sling</li>
<li>starting to think about spec tweaks</li>
<li>nothing terribly major</li>
<li>a bunch of pending feedback from Wolfgang Luan to handle</li>
<li>just hanging out and being available for questions on IRC</li>
<li>kp6 is now making more progress on hooking up to a Parrot backend</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Jesse:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>who's doing the work on that?</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Larry:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>they're just getting up to speed now</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Jerry:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>Daniel Loca</li>
<li>I've been in touch with him</li>
<li>he's targeting PIR right now</li>
<li>we're talking about doing transformations at the AST level</li>
<li>that would involve a materialization of the AST</li>
<li>we've talked to Ingy about doing that in YAML</li>
<li>Patrick's AST PDD draft is a good starting point</li>
<li>I consolidated a bunch of Parrot's runcore command-line options</li>
<li>just need to decide how to deprecate the old options</li>
<li>improved the parallel make performance too</li>
<li>I put the process that took the longest first in the list, not last</li>
<li>seem to be making one step forward and getting two TODOs</li>
<li>I'm gearing up to help with progress toward Perl 6, but I have vacation in November</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Jesse:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>what are you blocking on?</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Jerry:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>the remainder of the AST implementation</li>
<li>that's to work on Perl 6</li>
<li>I'll also be working on the exceptions implementation with Kevin Tew</li>
<li>he submitted a patch that Allison and I are looking at</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Patrick:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>things are pretty good</li>
<li>mostly cleaning things up and making progress on NQP and the AST representation</li>
<li>cleanup with respect to PDD 15 and S05 over the past few months</li>
<li>inside of NQP, I removed the notion of using <code>return</code> to return the AST; it now uses <code>make</code> </li>
<li>also wrote a preliminary implementation of protobjects</li>
<li>it's a nice abstraction layer</li>
<li>externally everything looks the same at that layer, even as we muck with the internals</li>
<li>we can split things into namespaces and the like without affecting customers of that interface</li>
<li>also talking about YAML representations of the AST</li>
<li>that doesn't depend on PDD 26 from my perspective</li>
<li>we just need a YAML representation where each node has a type, a hash, and an array</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Allison:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>continued cleaning up a few last failing tests after the PDD 15 branch merge</li>
<li>decided not to clean up some failures in prototyped systems that don't have specifications, so marked those as TODO</li>
<li>continued removing old object code including ParrotObject and ParrotClass</li>
<li>preparing for the 0.5.0 release</li>
<li>started looking at the exceptions PDD</li>
<li>aside from the stuff Kevin has done and adding the introspection interface, there are two things left: writing comprehensive tests and reviewing at the exception hierarchy</li>
<li>started a discussion of the PIR PDD draft</li>
<li>should be out of draft within the week</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>c:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>checked in my GC runcore after Jerry consolidated the argument options</li>
<li>found several problems</li>
<li>fixed most of those, but there are a couple of tough ones</li>
<li>somehow we reclaimed most of Tcl, for example, but Will found another hairy problem there</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Will:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>trying to find ways to remove bookkeeping that we need to manage</li>
<li>mostly reclaimed Tcl</li>
<li>plan to run language tests through this runcore after we get Tcl fixed up</li>
<li>think we'll be able to find and fix more memory issues there</li>
<li>probably some PMC-related stuff that's undertested in the core</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Jesse:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>talking to the folks working on kp6 and the Lispish backends</li>
<li>the performance and compliance are impressing me</li>
<li>I'll drop Damian a line this afternoon</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Jerry:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>someone asked on #perl6 about .NET developers interested in Perl 6 on .NET?</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Larry:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>CJ Collier noted that there was some interest in getting Perl 6 running there</li>
<li>he interrogated me as to some of the difficulties I saw there</li>
<li>he forwarded them Eric Lippert</li>
<li>mostly Eric agreed to my concerns</li>
<li>I'm willing to help if someone else drives it, but I won't code it myself</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Jerry:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>that VM has some challenges to overcome to implement Perl 6</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Larry:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>if there's interest from within Microsoft in doing that port, I don't think they should be discouraged</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Jerry:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>I'm happy to meet with them in person if they want</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Jesse:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>I'm sure Jonathan would have interesting input as well</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Allison:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>which languages are working after the merge?</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>c:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>Pheme, but I also tried Tcl, Lua, and Perl 6</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Jerry:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>APL and Punie are working</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Patrick:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>NQP is working</li>
<li>I figure I'll end up redoing Perl 6 in NQP in a few weeks</li>
<li>we'll have a working version somehow before 0.5.0</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Will:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>we can just run <code>make test</code> and get that working</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Jerry:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>we should work on getting all languages back to their previous state before 0.5.0</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Will:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>I'll start a migration guide on the wiki</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Patrick:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>the compiler toolkit change is going to protobjects which solves a lot of problems</li>
<li>I haven't looked at PAST-pm</li>
<li>if someone looks at that or wants my help, that's fine</li>
<li>I don't think it would take long to fix it</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Allison:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>we might just migrate them to PCT anyway</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Patrick:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>it's time to start migrating things</li>
<li>I'm trying to get PCT running so people can migrate to it</li>
<li>if we're within a week of release date and the migration doesn't look solid, I'll backport things so that the other languages can work</li>
<li>so far the object model seems to be working really well for all of the stuff I need</li>
