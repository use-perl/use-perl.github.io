<div class="span8">
<p>I'm currently pushing through "the grind" for the new <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Perl::Dist">Perl::Dist</a> and <a href="http://strawberryperl.com/">Strawberry Perl</a> releases, running the build process over and over again, tweaking and bug-fixing as I go. I've burned about 20 hours of CPU in the last week or so.</p>
<p>I'm happy with the binary-installation phase (which sets up gcc and dmake and friends) and the Perl compilation phase (at least for 5.8.8) and I'm now into the "toolchain distributions" phase.<br> <br>This involves fetching a pre-defined set of distributions and running "perl Makefile.PL; make; make test; make install" on them (without the ability to recursively resolve deps) to get the CPAN toolchain up to scratch.<br> <br>The 4th phase once this works is the "CPAN module" phase, which uses the upgraded toolchain to install a variety of modules from the CPAN using CPAN.pm and friends.<br> <br>This is the phase that most people building custom Perl installs (the cat-in-a-box concept for example) will probably want to customize, to install whatever it is they are interested in.<br> <br>One minor problem when building dists is that the fixed paths and the fact you can't use a distribution (say, Strawberry) to build a new version of that distribution.<br> <br>To assist with this problem, I'm going to shortly release a "Perl::Dist::Bootstrap" module, and matching .exe installer.<br> <br>This will be a Strawberry-like distribution, but which will install to an out-of-the-way C:\bootstrap-perl location, and will come with Perl::Dist and all it's dependencies pre-installed.<br> <br>So the final process for creating a new Vanilla Family distribution becomes:<p><blockquote> <div> <tt>1. Install Windows<br>2. Install the Bootstrap Perl executable<br>3. Check out your distribution module from version control<br>4. Run perldist My::Distribution to create the Perl distribution</tt> </div> </blockquote> I am pretty close to having a first experimental release completed, and I'll be doing a dev release of both it and the new Perl::Dist code in the next few days.<br> <br> <b>Update:</b> <br> <br>It would appear that the toolchain distribution install phase is working fully now, so I'll be commiting everything and dropping some test releases.</p>

<h2>Small addition: Set dynamic path to the toolchain</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Corion/">Corion</a> on 2007-10-30T09:01:52</h3>
<p>I keep meaning to contribute the following<nobr> <wbr></nobr><tt>.bat</tt> file which sets up the environment for a console dynamically. This first snippet can be called from any<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.cmd file or from within <tt>cmd.exe</tt>:</p> <p><blockquote> <div><tt>@echo off<br>SET BASE=%~dp0<br>path %BASE%\perl\bin;%BASE%\mingw\bin;%BASE%\dmake\bin;%PATH%</tt></div> </blockquote>  <p>Another thing - you provide only a<nobr> <wbr></nobr><tt>.exe</tt> file - I found it very convenient to also have a<nobr> <wbr></nobr><tt>.zip</tt> file which does not try installation into write-protected directories like anywhere on <tt>c:\</tt> - if it's not too much hassle, it would be great if you offer that as a second option.</p>

Unfortunately, for Perl 5.8.8 the installation path is hard-coded into Perl, so it has to be done that way.<br><br>Perl 5.10.0 changes that a bit, and although the initial release of Strawberry 5.10.0 will be hard-coded as well, we'll look at making it movable after release.<br><br>HOWEVER, one advantage of moving beyond a config-file driven methodology is that it opens the door to a "Perl from Scratch" idea, where if you want a Perl that installs to a certain place you might, for example do the following.<p><blockquote> <div><tt>perldist --installdir D:\perl Perl::Dist::Strawberry</tt></div> </blockquote> perldist would grind away silently for about an hour, and spit out an installer for Strawberry tailored to install to the directory you want.<br>

<p>"Hardcoded into Perl" on Win32 just means patching <tt>Config.pm</tt> respectively <tt>Config_heavy.pl</tt>, so the "it has to be done that way" can be remedied by a oneliner to change the installation path. <tt>@INC</tt> is built dynamically on Win32 anyway, so if you're not using CPAN or the toolchain, you don't even need to mess with <tt>Config.pm</tt>, <tt>Config_heavy.pl</tt> or <tt>CPAN/Config.pm</tt> at all.</p> <p><blockquote> <div><tt>"%~dp0\perl\bin\perl.exe" -pi.bak -e "BEGIN{$target=shift} s/c:\\strawberry\\/$target/gi" "%~dp0" lib/Config_heavy.pl lib/Config.pm lib/CPAN/Config.pm</tt></div> </blockquote>  <p>should work, but I haven't tested/automated that part yet</p>

Thanks for your work on this Adam.<br/><br/>I don't use Windows, but I may one day want to deploy a custom Perl app there!
