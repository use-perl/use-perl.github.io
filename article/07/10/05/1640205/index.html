<p>The Perl 6 design team met by phone on 03 October 2007.  Larry, Allison,
Jerry, Will, Jesse, Nicholas, and chromatic attended.</p>
<p><p> <strong>Patrick:</strong> </p>

<ul>

<li>worked on getting PGE to work with Parrot's new object model and vice-versa</li>
<li>created a branch for the pct refactor -- still need to check in some updates</li>
<li>I have a draft of the AST design document; will likely check it into the repo tomorrow for comments and updates</li>

</ul>

<p> <strong>Larry:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>didn't do anything on the spec</li>
<li>mostly re-hacking the lexer optimizer</li>
<li>the approach from last week was a dead end</li>
<li>now the program spits out the AST as chunks of YAML</li>
<li>I was trying to second-guess the information I need</li>
<li>turns out I needed most of it</li>
<li>I'm much happier now</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Jesse:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>what's next?</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Larry:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>making it work</li>
<li>the generated lexer is an egrep-style regular expression</li>
<li>I need something to take that and do lexing</li>
<li>it's not clear what I'll use or if I'll roll my own</li>
<li>it needs something which resembles longest-token matches</li>
<li>if someone had written an egrep-clone in Perl 6 then I'd just use it</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Jesse:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>have you put that challenge to #perl6 yet?</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>c:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>he will have when I publish these notes</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Larry:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>it's probably a week too soon for that</li>
<li>they're having more fun playing with the CL backend</li>
<li>it's almost to the point of the Perl 5 backend now</li>
<li>I'm trying to keep a low profile these days and get some work done</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Allison:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>things in Parrot are excellent</li>
<li>hacking on objects all week</li>
<li>I'm about to check in a patch that fixes the last MMD system failures in the branch</li>
<li>that's the last major broken subsystem aside from PGE</li>
<li>the rest of the failing tests mostly don't instantiate new PMCs correctly</li>
<li>I may have a hack that could enforce correct instantiation</li>
<li>clean up the core usage, not just the surface usage</li>
<li>that should clear up a lot of the tests as well</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Jerry:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>why do you call that a hack?</li>
<li>it sounds pretty good</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Allison:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>it checks type ids to decide what it's instantiating</li>
<li>it's a little more code</li>
<li>eventually I'd like to get rid of that as well</li>
<li>we didn't actually roll out the branch at the end of the month</li>
<li>we're not too many days off though</li>
<li>if Patrick doesn't get to PGE when I clean up a few tests, I'll just do the change for him</li>
<li>it's a small change</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Jesse:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>do you have a sense of when he'll be able to get back to Perl 6?</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Allison:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>this week</li>
<li>he put that aside temporarily to finish a funded milestone</li>
<li>he said yesterday that he had a nearly-complete draft to check in</li>
<li>this is infrastructure he needs to finish Perl 6</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Jesse:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>it's all critical path stuff, I know</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>c:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>helping Allison by cleaning up the edges of PDD15</li>
<li>adding a couple of small features</li>
<li>fixing some bugs</li>
<li>found and fixed some unrelated bugs that were bothering me</li>
<li>looking at some optimizations</li>
<li>put one in, waiting on PDD15 branch to land for another</li>
<li>reviewing some benchmark code that someone said was a lot slower in Parrot</li>
<li>will have more details on that soon</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Nicholas:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>spent a lot of time looking at CPAN code</li>
<li>lots of it is pretty mediocre</li>
<li>reviewing how people use C</li>
<li>I put a hack into maintperl to help <code>Class::DBI</code> </li>
<li>did see that Flavio has released KP6 to the CPAN (on October 4)</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Jerry:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>working with Allison on the PDD 15 branch</li>
<li>fixing up tests, examples, other code to use the new model</li>
<li>the most important thing for me is when Patrick finishes blocking</li>
<li>then I can turn my efforts to Perl 6</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Will:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>just trying to give guidance on #parrot when anyone needs it</li>
<li>otherwise, work keeps sucking up my free time</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Jesse:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>not much going on here</li>
<li>will be out of town next week</li>
</ul></p>
