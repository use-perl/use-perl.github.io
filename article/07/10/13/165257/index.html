<p><a href="http://use.perl.org/user/dagolden/">David Golden</a> recently alerted me to his <a href="http://win32.perl.org/wiki/index.php?title=Strawberry_Perl">Strawberry Perl</a> distribution for Win32. It bundles GCC, dmake and a slew of useful modules and for my money provides a better out of the box experience than ActiveState. The default for installing modules is cpan rather than ppd and the bundled GCC means that XS modules build just fine. It also bundles David's excellent <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/dagolden/CPAN-Reporter/">CPAN::Reporter</a> which means you'll be giving module authors helpful Win32 feedback every time you install.

<p>It's currently alpha but I found it completely stable. It manages to work pretty much like Perl on other platforms without having to pretend that Windows <i>is</i> another platform (&#224; la Cygwin).</p></p>

SP has been a complete godsend on win32 compare to AS perl. If I had a dolar for every compiled module headache it's saved me..I'd be rich.



<h2>CPAN::Reporter isn't bundled</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/dagolden/">dagolden</a> on 2007-10-14T13:24:43</h3>
<p>Just a nit -- CPAN::Reporter isn't bundled with Strawberry, but it does install cleanly, which is very nice for harassing -- (ahem!) I mean informing -- authors when their modules do not test cleanly on Windows.</p>

<p>Otherwise, thank you very much for your kind words about Strawberry.</p>

Ah - thanks for the correction David. I think you should bundle CPAN::Reporter though<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

<p>That's a good suggestion.  Alias declared himself the pumpking for the next release, so hopefully he'll read this and comment.</p>

Indeed I shall be bundling more development-style modules into the next release, and CPAN::Reporter would probably be a good addition.<br><br>The only downside is that it does not auto-configure (yet) so as I understand it, I'd need to make people configure it?

<p>A config file could be written to<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.cpanreporter/config.ini in the "My Documents" folder -- the sticky part will be the email address of the sender.</p>

<p>It might be possible to make some changes so there is some better prompting -- i.e. if no config file is found to ask about starting to configure instead of just warning about it.</p>

Can't you just loop through the Outlook address book and pick one at random? It's a very popular technique with virus writers<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

That or I suppose we could go with a specific email address intended to mean "unknown".
