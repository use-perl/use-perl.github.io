<h1>The Future of Test::Harness::Straps</h1>

<div class="span8">
<p><p>One of the implications of the work on <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/andya/Test-Harness-2.99_04/">Test::Harness 3.0</a> is that <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/petdance/Test-Harness-2.64/lib/Test/Harness/Straps.pm">Test::Harness::Straps</a> will no longer exist as part of Test::Harness. For new applications you are encouraged to use TAP::Harness / TAP::Parser. The awkwardness of Straps was one of the reasons to embark on a rewrite of Test::Harness and the new code should make it far easier to write ad-hoc testing applications.</p>

<p>That leaves the question of what should happen to Straps. As Schwern <a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/perl-qa@perl.org/msg09192.html">points out</a> it will still work once you have installed Test::Harness 3.0 - but it would be orphaned: installed but unmaintained with no updates available. The solution might be to make an independent release of Test::Harness::Straps. There's a slight danger then that people would continue to use it for new code but the documentation would carry warnings about the inadvisability of that - and ultimately if someone finds it useful, why not?</p>

<p>Let me know what you think.</p></p>

<p>I say pull it out and wrap it in a package. Push the POD out to Test::Harness::Straps::Manual and replace the Test::Harness::Straps POD with a single &#8220;DEPRECATED AND LARGELY UNSUPPORTED. DO NOT USE FOR NEW CODE&#8221; warning.</p>

I concur.<br><br>Split it into a separate distro, increment the version, label it as experimental.

I think that's what's going to happen. Schwern has taken on that task since I posted the story.<br/><br/>I see absolutely no harm in still having Straps around. I'd hate anyone to be faced with a pile of code they couldn't use / had to rewrite because we'd decided to kill it.
