<p>I replaced <a href="http://ppm.tcool.org/">http://ppm.tcool.org/</a> website with Catalyst+DBIC based one. Now you can search for modules/distributions it (and some other repos) provides. It also shows when the registered repos are last updated, and you can track down the dependency links to know which version of which packages would be installed alongside. This is rather important as not all the repositories have the latest version, and because I'm not using PPM::Make, packages in my repo tend to have different dependencies (compare <a href="http://ppm.tcool.org/dist/Plagger/at/tcool">http://ppm.tcool.org/dist/Plagger/at/tcool</a> and <a href="http://ppm.tcool.org/dist/Plagger/at/theoryx5">http://ppm.tcool.org/dist/Plagger/at/theoryx5</a> for example).</p>
<p>Well, refactoring is still going on. I need a better feed, and probably I should set up some fastcgi server (lighty?). Ideas are welcome. <br> <br>By the way, I found along the way that my repo was a bit unstable for PPM3 recently. I don't remember when I updated but SOAP::Lite 0.69 doesn't work well with PPM3 repository server. Though I haven't dug deep, it failed to serve ppd files at random (when I tested, XML-LibXML and Crypt-SSLeay were "not found on server", to name a few). I bumped down the version of SOAP::Lite to 0.60 and now I believe it is working fine again. GUI version of PPM doesn't suffer this problem. Sorry for inconvenience.</p>

<h2>Very Nice</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/barbie/">barbie</a> on 2007-10-18T09:08:35</h3>
<p>I like it, very useful for seeing which of my modules have been built specifically for Win32. Seeing as I develop on Win32, it's always seemed odd that ActiveState only recently have released versions into their repository.
</p><p>One suggestion though, can you add a 'next' and 'previous' link to the page numbers at the bottom of your <a href="http://ppm.tcool.org/repo/tcool/list/2" title="tcool.org">listings pages</a tcool.org>. Keep up the good work<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

Thanks. Added four shortcuts to the listings/search pages, and I'll implement listings by author later<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)

<h2>Now you can check your modules' status</h2>

Well, I'm still wondering the navigation but now you can see your modules' status via <a href="http://ppm.tcool.org/author/barbie" title="tcool.org">http://ppm.tcool.org/author/barbie</a tcool.org>.<br>

<p>Wonderful. You might want to add that feature to your search to allow searching for authors.
</p><p>After seeing your site it made me wonder whether I should set up a PPM repository myself, but seeing as trouchelle.com is doing such a great job keeping my modules up to date, I don't need to<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<h2>Re:Now you can check your modules' status</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ishigaki/">ishigaki</a> on 2007-10-19T10:08:10</h3>
Done. Now you can search for author names/ids. Thanks again!

<h2>ActiveState's PPM repository is a write-off</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Alias/">Alias</a> on 2007-10-19T04:35:36</h3>
It's fundamentally broken.<br><br>I'd recommend taking a look at Strawberry instead.

It may be, and I don't use AS's ppm repository personally. I even tell people not to use it (see <a href="http://ppm.tcool.org/intro/register" title="tcool.org">http://ppm.tcool.org/intro/register</a tcool.org>, but that's another story.<br><br>If you ask me, at least their MSI installer is better than Strawberry's, and they are releasing steadily whatever the quality is.<br><br>I know Strawberry is a good option but it still is not good enough for me, and I can't recommend it to the ordinary people, eh, who just want to use Plagger though are not (and don't intend to be) perl programmers. Actually my repo is for those people.<br><br>Frankly, ppm itself is not so good, but if we say so, we should prepare some alternatives. You refine Strawberry, and I refine my ppm repo, and maybe Ingy would create another binary installer (as he took BPAN<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:p). TMTOWTDI.<br>
