<p><p>I've been a bit quiet for the past month or so, mostly because projects both at work and home have taken up a lot of my time. One of the home projects has involved creating some report documents in PDF. When first thinking about this, I was looking at PDF::API2, and various other PDF modules, but was struck at how much layout work is put into the code. I don't like having to mix the two, as if I have to change anything in the layout it means changing the code. Reading a <a href="http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2007/09/20/pdf-processing-with-perl.html">recent article</a> on perl.com only reaffirms that. If you're creating a special document, this might work for you, but it doesn't for me.
</p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/andrewf/">Andrew Ford</a> and <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX">wikibooks</a>, I have been learning how to mix <a href="http://www.latex-project.org/">LaTeX</a> with <a href="http://www.template-toolkit.org/">Template Toolkit</a>. </p></p>
<p><p>
My current installed version of the <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Template-Latex/">plugin</a> (2.17) doesn't go as far as I need it to at the moment, but the <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/andrewf/Template-Plugin-Latex-3.00_05/">newest version</a> and its new dependency, <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/LaTeX-Driver/">Latex::Driver</a>, do. Unfortunately I've been finding problems with it on Win32, so I'm currently working through those with Andrew and hopefully he'll be able to get a working Win32 version out soon.
</p>

<p>However, following Andrew's encouragement to look at Latex, I was quite impressed at just how easy it was to learn the basics, and in fact I kind of jumped in at the deep end and was creating complex headers, footers, tables and graphics in my first document. I found a problem though, that none of the expert forums seem to have solved, as I want to swap a page layout from Portrait to Landscape mid document, but apart from that everything has worked wonderfully.
</p>

<p>If you are ever in a situation where you need to produce regular reports from various data sources, and templating would feel a natural way to go, I heartily recommend looking at Latex with Template Toolkit.
</p>

<p>Andrew will be giving an introduction to his modules at the next Birmingham Perl Mongers technical meeting. If I can manage it, I'll see whether I can record it on video. Assuming Andrew doesn't mind of course :)</p></p>

LaTeX is great. If you need help, count on me.



<h2>fwiw...</h2>

You probably want the "lscape" package, which provides a "landscape" environment.

<p>Unfortunately that only turns the content by 90 degrees, not the whole page layout. As such the headers and footers still appear in portrait mode. Yeah I tried that<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)</p>

Do you want text to flow on and off the landscape pages?  If not, I'd suggest just concatenating separate documents, and using "\setcounter{page}{N}" to get the page numbering right.  If so, it's hard to understand exactly what you want to happen, since LaTeX can move text around a lot when formatting.

<h2>landscape and portrait together</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/pjm/">pjm</a> on 2007-10-18T13:01:43</h3>
I might be misreading what you're seeking, but maybe something like the following will do the portrait/landscape shuffle?<br>==============================<br><br>\documentclass[11pt]{article}<br>\usepackage{pdflscape}<br><br>\begin{document}<br><br>\section{Some junk}<br><br>\begin{landscape}<br><br>\pagestyle{empty} %odd page number suppressed!<br><br>\section{The second section...}<br>Some more junk, on a landscape page in the pdf output.<br><br>\end{landscape}<br><br>\section{Back to sanity, in portrait mode...}<br><br>\end{document}<br>

<h2>Re:landscape and portrait together</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/barbie/">barbie</a> on 2007-10-18T16:34:37</h3>
<p>As per the reply above, this only rotates the content, not the page layout. The headers and footers are still printed in portrait mode<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:(
</p><p>If you find a solution, I'll be most impressed as I've yet to find anything in any online or printed material that describes how to do this, including the definitive <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/LaTeX-Companion-Frank-Mittelbach/dp/0201362996/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/203-0472664-7104728?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1192725204&amp;sr=8-1" title="amazon.co.uk">LaTeX Companion</a amazon.co.uk> book, that is well worth buying for anyone interested in LaTeX.</p>

<h2>(HTML + CSS) + Prince = PDF</h2>

I've used LaTeX in the past but if I were needing to generate printed reports now, I'd be seriously looking at Prince.  If only it were a little more free.<br><br><a href="http://www.princexml.com/" title="princexml.com">http://www.princexml.com/</a princexml.com>



<h2>dvips -b landscape</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/mr_bean/">mr_bean</a> on 2007-10-19T03:37:13</h3>
That will print the whole document sideways.



<blockquote>

<h2>Re:dvips -b landscape</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/barbie/">barbie</a> on 2007-10-19T08:37:00</h3>
<p>I think you might have misunderstood what I was after. I know how to get the whole document to print in either Portrait OR Landscape, but I want to create a document that allows both in the same document. All the options have so far only allowed the content to rotate NOT the complete page layout, i.e. including headers and footers.</p>

<h2>Business Reports</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/kaare/">kaare</a> on 2007-10-24T11:09:09</h3>
If you can do with Template Toolkit, LaTeX to PDF is great.<br><br>But if you want to produce Business Reports, like inventory lists, Invoices, Acoount Balances and so on, you need more precision. At least in my experience you do.<br><br>Whenever I get the time (and I will, Real Soon Now, promise!) I will look into this again and rewrite/refactor a module I made long time ago for this purpose.

<h2>Re:Business Reports</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/barbie/">barbie</a> on 2007-10-25T08:41:05</h3>
<p>Excellent. I look forward to seeing the results. You might want to talk to Andrew Ford, as he is very keen to get other LaTeX functionality usable within Template Toolkit.
</p><p>
For my purposes Template Toolkit provides the data and graphics needed to create the<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.tex file, then LaTeX takes over via Latex::Driver.</p>
