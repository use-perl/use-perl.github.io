<p>The talk went really well, with positive feedbacks from lots of people. The only problem is that I spent too much time (10 minutes) introducing the problem and had only 3 minutes to do the demonstration. Should have done the reharsal :/<br> <br>The slides is available at <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/miyagawa/webscraper">http://www.slideshare.net/miyagawa/webscraper</a> <br> <br>I realize that the code snippet is displayed in funny fonts because I use Consolas with my powerpoint. Trying to reupload the file with Courier New. <strong>UPDATE</strong>: Now re-uploaded!</p>

<h2>Neat stuff</h2>

The longer code examples are pretty much unreadable on the slide share.  Web::Scrapper looks pretty cool though.  I particularly like the idea of having a CLI.  Wish I had seen this a few weeks ago.

To me the longer code is still readable as long as you can fullscreen it. Or at least you can download the original file as<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.ppt format. So if you have a viewer that can read powerpoint files<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...<br><br>Yeah, I pretty much like the idea of CLI which I actually came up the day before the talk (yesterday), which turned out to be really useful for toying.
