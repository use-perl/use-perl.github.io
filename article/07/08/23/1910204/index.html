<div class="span8">
<p>Being an open source geek is an interesting position to be in. You can hack on bizarre stuff that barely anyone uses (like <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/msergeant/Net-IMAP-Simple-NB-1.1/">Net::IMAP::Simple::NB</a>) or you can hack on stuff that people use but you rarely hear about (like <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/msergeant/CDB_File-0.95/">CDB_File</a>, which I didn't create but at least I maintain it).<br> <br>But then there's the "other" stuff. The things you randomly hear about people installing as "essential" tools, like <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/msergeant/XML-XPath-1.13/">XML::XPath</a>, or more commonly lately <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/msergeant/DBD-SQLite-1.13/">DBD::SQLite</a>.<br> <br>What's odd about DBD::SQLite is that it has now become a staple of so many tiny little applications (most recently I read about some hack of reddit that someone had done) that if it suddenly went away it would be like perl going away. And that both gives me a wonderful sense of joy (for helping those people) and a terrible sense of dread (because what if I got it wrong somehow?). Such is the way of free software I guess...</p>

I sometimes find it funny that the modules I get the most feedback on, and that people love the most, are the ones that involved the least effort.<br><br>I get more feedback on Config::Tiny than the rest of my modules combined<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

Thank you SO much for DBD::SQLite, it's become utterly essential for me now (and it's going into other small apps soon too).<br><br>(And please don't make it every go away)<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

DBD::SQLite++ (well, except for 1.13)<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br><br>Aside from using it for applications, the sheer amount of things on CPAN that couldn't be tested, or tested easily without it is probably quite large.<br><br>I know Handel/Mango would have worthless tests if it weren't for DBD::SQLite...cuz lord knows I'd never install a real DB just for testing most of that stuff.

Not really. I'm not interested in what statements [syntax] were run or what params were bound..that's DBIx::Class' job.  I simply want to check that if I told DBIC to delete, it deleted. I'm really testing my interaction with DBIC and comparing it the to real db data itself, not checking that certain statements/binding happened.

Smolder loves DBD::SQLite. Thanks!

<p><div class="quote">And that both gives me a wonderful sense of joy (for helping those people) and a terrible sense of dread (because what if I got it wrong somehow?).</div> Well, you should consider it well tested now... So you should have <em>more</em> confidence in it now, than for CDB_File.

He means the ZOMGIBROKECPAN effect, where something stupid causes a ripple effect downstream.
