<p>Michael Specter quotes Matt Sergeant ("chief anti-spam technologist at MessageLabs") extensively in "Damn Spam" for <i>The New Yorker</i> (August 6, 2007).<br> <br>After the first page of the article, which mostly discusses how Richard Stallman supports the freedom to spam, I figured the article would be crap because Matt Sergeant hadn't shown up yet. He does show on page two (which is page 37 in the magazine), and ends up on half the pages. Poor Paul Graham barely gets a mention for filtering, which is slightly less than Bill Gates who said in 2004 "Two years from now, spam will be solved".<br> <br>Matt seemed the only quoted person to have any perspective: it's only going to get worse, and "[e]ach time we think we have them, they respond with something new." Too bad he couldn't say "Perl" every other word :)</p>

RMS believes in the freedom to spam? That figures.



<h2>Technology</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Matts/">Matts</a> on 2007-08-05T14:57:39</h3>
It's a shame we never get to talk about technology in these pieces. Certainly without perl we wouldn't be stopping spam at MessageLabs - it is throughout every part of our anti-spam process, and I suspect a lot of other places are similar.

Without Perl Reuters would never ship a Fixed Income price (though this may slowly change *sigh*).

yeah -- I think between us, we made perl the official language of spam filtering (for a while at least)<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)
