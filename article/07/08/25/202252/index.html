<p>The Perl 6 design team met by phone on 22 August 2007.  Larry, Patrick, Jesse, Nicholas, and chromatic attended.</p>
<p><p> <strong>c:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>fixed several Parrot bugs</li>
<li>we now have Tcl, Lua, and Perl 6 all which can work at the same time</li>
<li>I want to make sure they stay working</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Jesse:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>are you having fun in GC land?</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>c:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>I think a good refactoring is in order</li>
<li>I despair of anyone understanding it well without that anyway</li>
<li>so hopefully making it cleaner and not throwing away metadata will help find or fix the bugs</li>
<li>my immediate goal is to fix any blockers that people run into</li>
<li>also work in the HLL system for Parrot; that's the source of the Lua, Perl 6, Tcl bug</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Patrick:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>I'm blocking on time</li>
<li>it's been quite a week this past week</li>
<li>just released Parrot 0.4.15</li>
<li>just a few cleanups necessary</li>
<li>NQP has come along extremely well</li>
<li>it's nearing completion for its use as a tool in other compilers</li>
<li>may be able to write some example applications in NQP probably within the next 24 hours</li>
<li>we can interface to libraries such as the SDL bindings</li>
<li>I already have the transformation for the abc language written in NQP</li>
<li>NQP parses it</li>
<li>it just needs a few extra pieces to compile or run</li>
<li>that could happen within the next 24 to 48 hours as well</li>
<li>then I'll start on Perl 6</li>
<li>a side benefit is that I've had a good chance to readdress some of the Perl 6 blockers and solve them for NQP</li>
<li>they're trivial now in Perl 6</li>
<li>they're now part of the AST nodes</li>
<li>lots of features will just start to work for Perl 6 once it moves to NQP</li>
<li>Larry's work on the standard grammar has been extremely helpful</li>
<li>NQP has followed it as much as possible</li>
<li>that's helped find missing spots in the standard grammar</li>
<li>Larry's revised it based on that feedback</li>
<li>some of the tough things in the Perl 6 grammar are now easier there</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Jesse:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>I get people asking how they can help with NQP</li>
<li>can you break off a few chunks of 20 minutes or so for people to help?</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Patrick:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>there's not much left with NQP</li>
<li>with Perl 6, there are a few</li>
<li>people who want to help need to look at what it would take to help</li>
<li>Colin's driven a lot of the updates</li>
<li>adding various updates and statements</li>
<li>usually he'll say, "I want to add an operator"</li>
<li>he wants one to look at to cargo-cult</li>
<li>I've had to write one, then he goes from there and writes the others</li>
<li>he's added most of the fundamental pieces to NQP</li>
<li>I've done more architectural work and work on the compiler toolkit</li>
<li>I'll make an effort to make list tasks on NQP, Perl 6, or abc</li>
<li>another interesting task for a PIR hacker is to make the other SDL examples work with NQP</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Larry:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>I wrote a little program last week which processes the standard grammar</li>
<li>Pugs can process and run it</li>
<li>it can parse rudimentary expressions</li>
<li>it supports most of the constructs used in the standard grammar so far</li>
<li>just hacked in a first whack at bindings</li>
<li>let us produce an AST</li>
<li>that's still a work in progress</li>
<li>that flushed out a few more issues with the standard grammar</li>
<li>takes about a minute for Pugs to compile the standard grammar after post-processing</li>
<li>not exactly speedy</li>
<li>the actual pattern matching it does right now isn't optimized</li>
<li>parses everything to use <code>gather</code> and <code>take</code> </li>
<li>lazy lists already give you basically continuations underneath</li>
<li>this parser can have many different simultaneous backtracks held in reserve in a list</li>
<li>for a minimal match, just read your lazy list in order</li>
<li>to be greedy, reverse that list and read it in the opposite order</li>
<li>seems to work out nicely</li>
<li>conceptually pretty</li>
<li>avoids throwing continuations directly at the reader of the code</li>
<li>for a ratcheting grammar, it could be faster by getting rid of the <code>gather</code>/<code>take</code> </li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Nicholas:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>could someone else work on that particular pass?</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Larry:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>someone else is helping me... rhr... Ryan Richter</li>
<li>I'm concentrating on correctness now</li>
<li>because each of these possibilities gets generated on the fly, each has to keep its own match object</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Jesse:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>how memory intensive is that?</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Larry:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>it depends on how many matches you have in the air simultaneously</li>
<li>in theory, if it's lazy enough, "no more than you need"</li>
<li>when it tries to be greedy when you didn't want it to be greedy, you use a lot of memory</li>
<li>sweeping that under the carpet of laziness fixes that issue nicely</li>
<li>that means I don't have to think about backtracking</li>
<li>just attach the state to the right continuation going forward</li>
<li>probably reinventing a packrat parser</li>
<li>I figure out I need something and do it, then find out someone already has a name for it</li>
<li>I don't know if this will ever be used for a real bootstrap, but it's definitely flushing a lot of issues out</li>
<li>exactly what objects do we need</li>
<li>we have current language, current continuation, match object...</li>
<li>are they the same or different?</li>
<li>exactly how many objects do we pass down through it</li>
<li>also trying to do a better parsing of embedded sublanguages such as double-quoted variants</li>
<li>there's a kludge for finding terminators</li>
<li>I don't think that's very clean</li>
<li>I think the grammar will clean up in a few places because of this</li>
<li>don't know how much time I'll have, as we leave for Vienna on Saturday</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Jesse:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>how much have you followed what Flavio's been doing as of late?</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Larry:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>keeping half an eye on it</li>
<li>they can pass parameters to methods in kp6 and are working on subroutines</li>
<li>they seem to whack on it frequently</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Jesse:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>I talked to Steve Peters</li>
<li>he's had more time free up recently</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>c:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>I checked in a couple of patches and have a couple more to review from him</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Patrick:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>STD.pm looks like a problem if you have a subroutine followed by a bare block</li>
<li>it parses as if it's postcircumfix braces after the sub</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Larry:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>even with whitespaces?</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Patrick:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>the <code>&lt;routine_def&gt;</code>rule eats up the trailing whitespace</li>
<li>in NQP, I created an <code>&lt;afterws&gt;</code> assertion that determines if the current position follows a memoized <code>&lt;?ws&gt;</code> </li>
<li>the <code>&lt;postop&gt;</code> only goes if it's not after whitespace, that is, <code>token postop { &lt;!afterws&gt; ... }</code> </li>
<li>it seemed to work pretty well</li>
<li>that's an advantage of the tests that Colin's putting in</li>
<li>putting in the explicit "did I just eat whitespace?" test works pretty well</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Jesse:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>I presume we're off next week because of YAPC::EU</li>
<li>we'll pick up the following week</li>
</ul></p>
