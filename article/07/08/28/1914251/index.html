<p><p>MIME::Lite is, in my opinion, the worst of the popular email object modules. It&#39;s buggy, has a lousy interface, and just does awful things.  I&#39;d go so far as to say that the number one mistake I see in new email modules is a reliance on MIME::Lite instead of Mail::Message or Email::MIME.</p> <p>That said, I&#39;ve just released the first non-developer release of MIME::Lite in over four years!</p></p>
<p><p>  I get a nightly report of bugs in all (or much) of the CPAN&#39;s email code, and nearly a third of those have long been bugs in MIME::Lite. I&#39;ve closed a number of them already, and will try to close some more.  So far, I think that nothing much should break, but it&#39;s hard to say.  The tests for MIME::Lite::HTML now fail, but only because it relies on receiving exactly identical output, and the location of the MIME-Version header has changed. (That&#39;s another lousy module, by the way, which was for a long time the only game in town.  It&#39;s finally been superseded by Email::MIME::CreateHTML.)</p> <p>Please report problems with this new release of MIME::Lite to its bug tracker at rt.cpan.org. </p></p>

I never had a problem with MIME::Lite. Should I go with Mail::Sender instead?

You should be using, imho, a mail object class for constructing your message and another tool for sending it.  I'd suggest that you use, for the first, either Email::Simple, Email::MIME, or Mail::Message.  For the later, Email::Send, at least until it is replaced by Email::Sender, which has long been languishing in the wings.

Or if you want something that dumbs down the whole process of doing things the "right" way (rjbs tells me how to do things the right way, and I dumb them down) you could use something like <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Email::Stuff" title="cpan.org">Email::Stuff</a cpan.org>.<br>

Yes, I need the dumbed down version. Thanks!

MIME::Lite has always worked well for me, and I like the convenience of having build/send packaged together. (Hey, at least they are separate methods).<br><br>Now that it has been improved, I'll have less reason to quit using it.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br><br>Thanks for the update.
