<p>jesse writes <i>"I'm pleased to announce the inaugural Perl 6 Microgrants program. Best Practical Solutions (my company) has donated USD5,000 to The Perl Foundation to help support Perl Development.  Leon Brocard, representing The Perl Foundation's grants committee, will work with me to select proposals and evaluate project success.  We'll be making USD500 grants to worthy Perl 6 related efforts. </i></p>
<p><i>We're hoping to fund a range of Perl 6-related projects over the life of the grant program.  Accepted grants might be for coding, documentation, testing or even writing articles about Perl 6. The program isn't tied to any one implementation of Perl 6 &mdash; We're interested in seeing proposals related to Pugs, Perl 6 on Parrot, Perl 6 on Perl 5 or any other Perl 6 implementation.  Generally, we're interested in seeing projects that can be completed in 4-6 calendar weeks.<br> <br>Submitting a grant proposal<br> &mdash; <br> <br>To submit a grant proposal, please email us at perl6-microgrants@perl.org with the following information:<br> <br>* A two to three paragraph summary of the work you intend to do<br>* A quick bio &mdash; Who are you? Is there opensource work you've done that we should have a look at?<br>* A brief description of what "success" will mean for your project &mdash; How will we know you're done?<br>* Where (if anywhere) you've discussed your project in the past<br>* Where you'll be blogging about your progress. (Twice-weekly blog posts are a requirement for getting your grant money)<br> <br>We'll be accepting proposals on a rolling schedule. We expect to pay out these first 10 grants over the course of the summer. Depending on how things go, we'll then either find more money for more grant programs or we'll wind up the program and move on to other endeavors.<br> <br>We're really excited to get rolling. Submit your proposals early and often.  Don't let somebody else beat you to the punch ;)"</i></p>
