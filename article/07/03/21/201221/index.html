<p><b>This week on the Perl 6 mailing lists</b>
<p>"It seems you are presuming a Waterfall model of development here.  We're not doing the Waterfall, we're doing the Whirlpool, where the strange attractor whirls around with feedback at many levels but eventually converges on something in the middle.  In other words, a whirlpool sucks, but the trick is to position your whirlpool over your intended destination, and you'll eventually get there, though perhaps a bit dizzier than you'd like."</p>

<p>-- Larry Wall, in 'What criteria mark the closure of perl6 specification'</p></p>
<p><p> <b>Language</b> </p>
<p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/906b804595963e19/529def8a5dc794ce?#529def8a5dc794ce">[S09] &quot;Whatever&quot; indices and shaped arrays</a> </i> </p>
<p>Jonathan Lang suggested dropping some specification from S09 which described
how <code>*</code> works in conjunction with <code>+</code> and <code>-</code>.  He suggested using <code>[0]</code>
for the first index instead of <code>*+0</code>.  Larry Wall added his thoughts,
noting that it was 'shiny', but that nested <code>[]</code>s might not be visually
appealing.</p>

<p>Luke Palmer decided to mention Ruby's boolean truth model which he admires.
With it, 'nil' and 'false' are false, and everything else--including an
empty string and '0'--are true.  In summary he stated that simple rules
are a blessing if you find the right ones, and that he's a fan of
boolean predictability.</p>

<p>The shaped arrays thread continued, and eventually Larry was satisfied
and requested a patch to S09.</p>

<p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/29fc92f5575de0b4/4697bb48436c10a8?#4697bb48436c10a8">What criteria mark the closure of perl6 specification</a> </i> </p>
<p>Richard Hainsworth asked when the Perl 6 specification will be complete.
He is eager to begin using Perl 6, but wants to see it stabilize.
Geoffrey Broadwell was perfectly willing to work with a moving
specification, so long as the current version of the specification
was mostly implemented.  chromatic noted that this is what everyone
wants.</p>

<p>Geoffrey offered to write some tests which would demonstrate
missing features, if someone could implement the features.  Gabor
Szabo said that he wished there were many people writing tests
for unimplemented features, as someone would surely implement
the feature to make tests pass.</p>

<p>There was a discussion on how out-of-date the Exegesis files are.
Masak suggested porting the code examples in the Exegesis to current
Perl 6, and storing them in the Pugs repository.  Herbert Breunung
thought a disclaimer that they are outdated would be adequate.</p>

<p>Patrick Michaud noted that the changes to the specification have not
had a negative impact on the development of the Perl 6 on Parrot
implementation; to the contrary, they have made the work easier.</p>

<p>Smylers added that there is no point in freezing the specification if
it turns out it can't be implemented.  Smylers felt that most of the
current work is clarifying, rather than adding new features. </p>

<p>Larry Wall explained that Perl 6 development doesn't follow the
Waterfall model.  He cannot design something without feedback from
implementors.  The development model was described as a 'whirlpool'.</p>

<p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/8bcd69c7f486960e/08811413d0e416cb?#08811413d0e416cb">Packed array status?</a> </i> </p>
<p>Geoffrey Broadwell wanted to know what backends support packed native
arrays.  He also added a comment on '<a href="%2345E12FCE.6080000@hainsworth.ru">What criteria mark the closure of perl6 specification</a>'.</p>

<p>chromatic replied that Parrot has <code>ManagedStruct</code> and <code>UnManagedStruct</code>
PMCs for mapping complex C structures.  Patrick Michaud replied that
the PIR libraries aren't working yet, but that implementing them should
not be too difficult.  Audrey Tang also described the situation in
Pugs.  Geoffrey wondered if he could follow the development status.
He offered to write some tests.</p>

<p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/7e9904b4b3dcaf45/4055ca8572e194ad?#4055ca8572e194ad">[svn:perl6-synopsis] r13704 - doc/trunk/design/syn</a> </i> </p>
<p>Larry Wall's commit made the one-pass parsing rule explicit so that
tests can reference it.</p>

<p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/5a67d8e21d086fec/45ab2761d3210be1?#45ab2761d3210be1">request new Mapping|Hash operators</a> </i> </p>
<p>Darren Duncan believes that there is room for some additional convenience
operators or functions which are used with mapping and hash values.  In
particular, he would like the relational data model concept of a tuple.
He feels that this could be satisfied with the data types <code>Mapping</code> and
<code>Hash</code> with the addition of some common relational operators such
as <code>join()</code>, <code>semijoin()</code>, <code>semidifference()</code>, <code>rename()</code>, <code>project()</code>,
<code>remove()</code>, <code>compose()</code>, <code>wrap()</code>, and <code>unwrap()</code>.</p>

<p>Nicholas Clark noted that <code>rename</code> is a Perl 5 builtin, which he doesn't
believe has been dropped for Perl 6.  Smylers added that Perl already has
a <code>join</code> function for renaming strings.  Darren reiterated that he isn't
concerned with the names so much as the concepts they express.</p>

<p>Aaron Crane wondered why Darren was specifically against putting this
functionality into a third-party module.  Darren supplied an argument
for the usefulness of relational operators in response.  Smylers pointed
out that it would be odd to include core support for database operations
when most people would opt to use DBI (a module) instead.  David Green
wasn't concerned about whether the features were core or in a module,
but thought it would be nice to have them.</p>

<p>There was some discussion on whether certain features, such as renaming
hash keys, are implemented in Perl 5, with David Green, Darren Duncan,
Aaron Crane and Uri Guttman taking part.</p>

<p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/62aac8446cc9efe8/39cc8f2a9135f205?#39cc8f2a9135f205">request: num16</a> </i> </p>
<p>Geoffrey Broadwell requested that <code>num16</code> and <code>complex16</code> be added to S09
and made optional.  These half-sized floating point types are commonly used
in graphics.</p>

<p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/5382d506fbb29feb/0603633155ca41d5?#0603633155ca41d5">Bit shifts on low-level types</a> </i> </p>
<p>Geoffrey Broadwell asked how bitwise shifts are defined on low-level types.
Smylers remarked that it is rare to deal with anything as low-level as
bits in Perl 5 programming.  He feared that introducing more operators
into the core language, especially if they would be rarely used, raises
the entry barrier.</p>

<p>Nicholas Clark added that it's something you don't want to do in Perl 5,
because it is so bad at it.</p>

<p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/1bb1fe7f730a5c5e/2d2f837ffc019646?#2d2f837ffc019646">Rotation ops?</a> </i> </p>
<p>Geoffrey Broadwell asked if Perl 6 has bit/string rotation operators.</p>

<p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/547a13740eed1dce/36bad3f4097cc4e7?#36bad3f4097cc4e7">Low-level types and over/underflow</a> </i> </p>
<p>Geoffrey Broadwell wanted to know what would happen if a low-level type
underflows or overflows.  For example, if you incremented a <code>uint8</code> past
255, what would be the result?</p>

<p>Darren Duncan thought that it depended upon what the underlying hardware
does.  He suspected it would be a wraparound or an overflow, not a type
upgrade.</p>

<p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/6f76443cb75ec9fb/80e1f6f8259cb132?#80e1f6f8259cb132">Casting and low-level types</a> </i> </p>
<p>In this thread, Geoffrey Broadwell asked what happens when you cast between
low-level types if the source value is out of range for the destination
type.  Larry Wall replied that it would be an warning if the destination
is an <code>int</code>, and a clip to infinities when the destination is a <code>num</code>.</p>

<p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/f22f83148e764316/9959a6374353ed34?#9959a6374353ed34">Compact structs and &quot;byte-stringification&quot;</a> </i> </p>
<p>Geoffrey Broadwell wanted to know how you specify that you want to
byte-stringify a structure, rather than normally stringifying it.
Larry Wall advised coercing to a buffer type rather than using <code>~</code>.</p>

<p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/ddb2dfcbe9cfcec7/78442964d52dcd52?#78442964d52dcd52">Expressions with mixed types including low-level types</a> </i> </p>
<p>Geoffrey Broadwell asked how casting and coercion are handled with
expressions which involve mixing low- and high-level types.
Larry Wall answered the question, and pointed to a recent update of
S09.</p>

<p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/a95234d398249610/ee90279b60af09fb?#ee90279b60af09fb">[svn:perl6-synopsis] r14308 - doc/trunk/design/syn</a> </i> </p>
<p>Larry Wall made a commit to S03 which distinguished Range's intervalic <code>.min</code> and <code>.max</code> from its directed <code>.from</code> and <code>.to</code>.</p>

<p> <b>Parrot Porters</b> </p>
<p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/6034c9dd28cd79ba/89a0bac210115206?#89a0bac210115206">[perl #41601] [BUG] parrotbug b0rken </a> </i> </p>
<p>In ticket <a href="http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=41601">[perl #41601]</a>, Klaas-Jan Stol reported a problem with
Parrotbug on Win32.  Paul Cochrane thought that the problem existed
on all platforms.   Because people are currently advised to send an
email, Paul thought that Parrotbug is confusing and should perhaps
be removed.</p>

<p>Jerome Quelin remarked that he has no time to work on Parrotbug,
which he originally created.  He said that anyone willing to work
on it was welcome to take over maintenance.</p>

<p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/0f45f86e677884be/1255ef6ff2d367d5?#1255ef6ff2d367d5">[perl #41604] [BUG] pbc_output_is doesn&#39;t work? </a> </i> </p>
<p>Klaas-Jan Stol tried to add a test which runs some PIR code as PBC.  He
noted that a PBC file wasn't being created, and sent a patch which could
fix this to ticket <a href="http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=41604">[perl #41604]</a>.  He also wondered if it was a good
idea to store PBC files in the repository.</p>

<p>Leopold Toetsch explained that the files which are in the repository are
generated on different machines, and the tests check that Parrot can
read PBCs from different platforms.</p>

<p>Klaas-Jan wondered if <code>pbc_output_is</code> could take PIR code and compile
it while running a test, or if it expects the PBC file to be present.
Leopold confirmed that the PBC file must be present.</p>

<p>Jerry Gay noted that there are no test functions which accept PIR,
compile to PBC, and run the PBC.  He wasn't sure it was a good idea
to add this functionality before the refactoring of Parrot::Test is
complete.</p>

<p>In ticket <a href="http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=41606">[perl #41606]</a>, Klaas-Jan Stol  proposed adding a
flag which checks at runtime if any deprecated ops are used.</p>

<p>Later, he remarked that such a check would be rather slow, so it
would be better to add some annotation in the <code>.ops</code> file.</p>

<p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/b202a198efc3b8db/97c0ec1e2db3faf3?#97c0ec1e2db3faf3">[PATCH] Update DEPRECATED.pod</a> </i> </p>
<p>Klaas-Jan Stol submitted a patch to <code>DEPRECATED.pod</code> which includes some
of the deprecated ops.  Allison Randal applied it as r17206.</p>

<p>James Keenan submitted two patches which replace his earlier patches
by the same name.  This was ticket <a href="http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=41608">[perl #41608]</a>.</p>

<p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/986b2530c12d4699/091cd4b4a38b4262?#091cd4b4a38b4262">[perl #41612] parrot on CPAN testers.. </a> </i> </p>
<p>Will Coleda created ticket <a href="http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=41612">[perl #41612]</a> because he noticed that
Parrot hadn't passed on Windows since 0.4.6.  chromatic thought that
0.4.9 would help resolve some of the recent failures.
Patrick R. Michaud had seen a report of 0.4.9, and said there were
still failures with positive and negative numbers very close to zero.</p>

<p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/7e3b65b6ea79d2b3/e1928f3b5b6a3434?#e1928f3b5b6a3434">[perl #41614] Can&#39;t set non-core object attribs yet  </a> </i> </p>

adding an attribute to a TclProc PMC.  Alek Storm remarked that a Sub
is not a ParrotObject, so it has nowhere to store attributes.  He
submitted a patch which implements a basic storage system for TclProc.
Will commented that it was annoying that attributes aren't just available
everywhere, and that ParrotClass and PMC don't have much in common.</p>

<p>Klaas-Jan Stol noted that most languages which can be run interactively
print a welcome message.  He submitted a patch to give a message when
interactive mode is entered, before printing a prompt.</p>

<p>Patrick R. Michaud thought the effort was useful, but that it shouldn't
mention help which isn't available.  Also, there was a bit of a problem
with multi-line input.</p>

<p>There was a bit of further discussion on the topic.</p>

<p>In ticket <a href="http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=41619">[perl #41619]</a>, Alek Storm submitted a patch which adds
several vtable methods which can be used by Ruby and Smalltalk.
James E Keenan reported that the patch, when applied to the branch,
did not cause any problems with tests.</p>

<p>Allison Randal thought this raised a design issue.  She wanted to know
why <code>add_attr</code>, <code>rem_attr</code> and <code>rem_attr_str</code> were vtable methods instead
of methods on the Class class.  Alek thought that this was in line with
PDD 15.  Joshua Isom was concerned about interoperability, and wondered
if Perl 6 and Tcl (for example) would be able to use the new class
implementation.</p>

<p>Alek replied that the vtable provides an abstract interface everyone
can use seamlessly.  He thought that it would in fact encourage people
to use multiple languages in a single application.</p>

<p>chromatic asked Alek to clarify what behavior he wanted to enable in the
HLL.  Alek said he would put together some code which would demonstrate
his intention.  As of March 12th, he was still working on the use case.</p>

<p>In ticket <a href="http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=41620">[perl #41620]</a>, Alek Storm included a patch which changes the
<code>label INT</code>, <code>labelvar INT</code> and <code>labelconst INT</code> syntax to <code>in LABEL</code>,

<p>Jerry Gay felt that if PBCs need to be regenerated due to incompatibilities,
<code>make</code> should inform the user of this.  He created ticket
<a href="http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=41634">[perl #41634]</a> to track this development.</p>

<p>Klaas-Jan Stol attached a patch for PDD06 to ticket <a href="http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=41636">[perl #41636]</a>.

<p>In ticket <a href="http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=41637">[perl #41637]</a>, Klaas-Jan Stol reported that SMOP won't

<p>Earlier, in ticket <a href="http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=41642">[perl #41642]</a>, Mehmet Yavuz Selim Soyturk
reported a bug.  </p>

<p>This week, Jonathan Worthington reported that he had fixed a bug
asked someone to check with the latest code.  Bob Rogers reported that
Mehmet's test case works in r17298, but that it still fails for him
even when the patch is applied.</p>

<p>Later, Bob was able to look into the issue further, and found that
there are some more serious problems and that he needs to think on
how to solve them.</p>

the garbage collection files, which are not located where one would
expect to find them.  He submitted a patch for it.</p>
