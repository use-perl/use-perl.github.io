<p>The Perl 6 design team met on 20 June 2007.  Larry, Damian, Patrick, Nicholas, and chromatic attended.  These are the minutes.</p>
<p>
<p> <strong>Larry:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>mostly in talk preparation mode</li>
<li>in the phase of building up sufficient panic to write something down</li>
<li>Damian, did you put together anything on "What's new in Perl 6?"</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Damian:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>I will by next week</li>
<li>what day do you need it by?</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Patrick:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>Larry's presentation's on Tuesday</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Damian:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>I have to put one together for YAPC::EU</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Larry:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>I can probably pretty much wing it</li>
<li>anything you have would be nice</li>
<li>mostly in the throes of upgrading to FC 7</li>
<li>I tried an upgrade first</li>
<li>now it's a fresh install</li>
<li>then you spend days just running to stay in place</li>
<li>seems to have settled down finally</li>
<li>hacking more on the spec and the grammar</li>
<li>nothing major there</li>
<li>looking at some of the tests to see what kind of state they're in</li>
<li>trying to get them in a portable state</li>
<li>by and large, that'll take an army of ants rather than just one person</li>
<li>did find and add more missing things from the standard grammar</li>
<li>it's certainly stabilizing</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Damian:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>I've basically been destroying all goodwill on p6l</li>
<li>discussing aspects of the new POD syntax</li>
<li>basically trying to have a rational argument with people coming at it from opposing positions</li>
<li>surprisingly difficult</li>
<li>things seem to have calmed down after Larry ruled on the issue</li>
<li>reworking the Perl 6 POD parser module to accept Larry's ruling, as best it can</li>
<li>working on an extension to Perl 6 POD which allows you to extract bits of code and put into documentation</li>
<li>otherwise preparing for my extensive September trip</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Patrick:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>busy week here</li>
<li>we have the 01-sanity tests running under Perl 6 for Parrot</li>
<li>we're looking at the <em>Test.pm</em> file from Pugs</li>
<li>it requires a lot of things not in the sanity tests</li>
<li>we've today put together a throwaway <em>Test.pm</em> so that we can run several of the other tests without having to make all of the real <em>Test.pm</em> work</li>
<li>when we get more features, we'll merge the two back into a single unit</li>
<li>I can also now parse the action stubs in the standard grammar</li>
<li>we don't need a pre-processing step now</li>
<li>it may be a throwaway thing, but I can play with it and do experiments with it</li>
<li>I'll check it in later today; I held off until last night's Parrot release</li>
<li>we've been doing a lot of cleanup of the Perl 6 language directory today</li>
<li>trying to make it easier for contributors to that part</li>
<li>also wrote a message to the lists about the plans for further development</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>c:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>any specific plans for the hackathon?</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Patrick:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>plan to use the presentations to build on what people know and show what we need to do</li>
<li>then I'll incorporate plenty of Pugs tests so we'll have plenty of visible things to do</li>
<li>worked this weekend on nqp, Not Quite Perl 6</li>
<li>little language to work on the compilation phase</li>
<li>uses the same kind of grammar constructs that are in the standard grammar</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Nicholas:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>Patrick, everything's really cool!</li>
<li>Larry mentioned an army of ants and things that need to be done</li>
<li>is there a way to hook those up to the microgrants?</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Patrick:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>I can come up with a list of those</li>
<li>I should do some myself</li>
<li>that's an excellent idea</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Damian:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>Larry, you ruled that the way POD works in Perl 6 is that the POD parser is free to treat everything that looks like POD as POD</li>
<li>the Perl 6 parser is free to treat everything that looks like a string, even if it contains POD, as a string</li>
<li>is that the only case in where the Perl parser prefers Perl to POD?</li>
<li>what if an assignment operator occurs in column one?</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Larry:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>do something more like Perl 5 does?</li>
<li>only recognize POD where the parser expects a statement?</li>
<li>I don't think we have to go that far</li>
<li>if code gets misparsed as a chunk of POD, it will likely produce some sort of message indicating a misparse</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Damian:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>I want to advance that position myself</li>
<li>POD 6 has a careful design</li>
<li>intended to interleave POD6 and Perl; easier than it was, as it doesn't require blank lines</li>
<li>people can document their code at a finer grain</li>
<li>one line of code, one line of POD, one line of code, one line of POD</li>
<li>could document the creation of a list of something</li>
<li>that won't work if the parser treats things that look like assignments as assignments</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Larry:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>in Perl, you only get an <code>=</code> in the first column if you write in a very bad style</li>
<li>I'm not inclined to cater to that</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Damian:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>that makes my life a little bit easier</li>
<li>especially for retrofitting Perl 6 POD back onto Perl 5</li>
<li>I can identify Perl 5 strings and be careful with those</li>
<li>I'm happy with that</li>
<li>I'll update S26 and S02 or S03 with the interaction between Perl and POD</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Nicholas:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>it's the "Doctor, it hurts if I do this!" isn't it?</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Larry:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>yes</li>
</ul></p>
