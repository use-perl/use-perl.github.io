<p> <a href="http://www.plainblack.com/">kmccombs</a> writes "June's <a href="http://www.madmongers.org/">MadMongers</a> meeting features a series of four lightning talks, three of which are to be presented by <a href="http://www.plainblack.com/">Plain Black</a> staffers. These talks will pack a large amount of knowledge condensed into one session, so be prepared to take notes and walk out with some new ideas.</p>
<p><p>Presentation topics include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Inside-Out Objects: Graham Knop will cover implementation of inside-out objects and point out ways to increase speed and flexibility while maintaining and supporting objects between threads.</li>
<li>Writing Network Daemons: JT Smith will discuss writing network daemons and the potential pitfalls associated with user and programmer errors, multiple instances of a daemon running on one server, and the tricks associated with multithreading daemons to enable them to handle several requests at once. JT will provide expert advice for handling all these issues and demonstrate his professional approach to writing effective network daemons.</li>
<li>Net::LDAP: Frank Dillon will discuss using Net::LDAP to connect to, retrieve, and write data to an LDAP repository. Net::LDAP is a collection of modules that implements a LDAP services API for Perl programs. The module may be used to search directories or perform maintenance functions such as adding, deleting or modifying entries.</li>
<li>Regular Expressions: Steve Peters will cover the regular expression changes that are coming with Perl 5.10. In this release the regular expression engine has been restructured and includes many new features. Steve will discuss these changes along with the additional functionality they provide.</li>
</ul>
<p>
MadMongers is the Madison, WI chapter of Perl Mongers, and encourages anyone interested in Perl to attend.<br>When: Thursday, June 14<br>Time: 7:00-9:00pm CDT<br>Place: <a href="http://www.madisonpubliclibrary.org/">Madison Public Library</a>"</p></p>

<h2>Substitute</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ChrisDolan/">ChrisDolan</a> on 2007-06-15T03:09:01</h3>
Steve Peters didn't make it to the meeting, so I subbed for him and gave a <a href="http://www.chrisdolan.net/madmongers/catalyst.html" title="chrisdolan.net">talk on Catalyst</a chrisdolan.net>.  I installed Catalyst on my laptop, built a sample SQLite-backed Catalyst website, took some screenshots and wrote my talk in the first 40 minutes of the meeting while listening to Frank's LDAP talk.  That's a credit to Catalyst's power!<br>



<h2>&quot;Staffer&quot;</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Simon/">Simon</a> on 2007-06-15T07:07:32</h3>
I don't know why the pseudo-word "staffer" annoys me as much as it does. What's wrong with "staff" or, if you must, "staff member"?
