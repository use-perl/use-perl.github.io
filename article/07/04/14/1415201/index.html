<p><p>
The Perl 6 design team met by phone on 11 April 2007.  Larry, Damian, Allison, Patrick, Nicholas, and chromatic attended.  These are the minutes.
</p></p>
<p>
<p> <strong>Damian:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>despite family difficulties, I'm working very hard on the new verrsion of the POD 6 parser</li>
<li>hope to have that out on the CPAN today</li>
<li>I'm only tweaking the documentation now</li>
<li>slowly reading and responding to Synopses</li>
<li>that'll pick up its pace soon</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Larry:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>came back from the east coast</li>
<li>my talk at Brown went pretty well</li>
<li>it was open ended late on a Friday afternoon</li>
<li>it ran about an hour and a half</li>
<li>mostly getting caught up after getting back, lots of little details</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Patrick:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>working on the refactors of the regex test suite</li>
<li>I've cleaned the tests up</li>
<li>hopefully we can get a Pugs hacker to incorporate my patches back in</li>
<li>the TODO syntax is really nice</li>
<li>I'll probably post a message to p6c later today</li>
<li>I could do the merge, but I'd rather do other things</li>
<li>spent more time thinking about the overall compilation process for Perl 6</li>
<li>I really like Larry's grammar</li>
<li>I have to add a bunch of features to PGE to get it to work</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Larry:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>I wrote it in an uncompromising fashion, expecting that you could cheat</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Patrick:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>I will cheat in some ways</li>
<li>I'm having to redo parts of PGE anyway for pieces of the new syntax</li>
<li>so I might just bite off a bigger chunk so I can use more of the grammar</li>
<li>it won't be that difficult</li>
<li>the tricky part is dealing with the proto-regexes</li>
<li>multiple regex rules under the same name</li>
<li>I may just cheat by doing a brute-force implementation instead of trying to be clever about DFAs</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Larry:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>my little cheat script built a non-multi version of that</li>
<li>assumes that the order you define them is the order in which you match</li>
<li>run that script on it and see what it spits out</li>
<li>the principles of cheating are similar</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>c:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>Haskell does the same thing in its pattern guards</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Larry:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>they cheat on purpose</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Patrick:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>we're cheating on purpose here too</li>
<li>also spent a lot of time looking at Flavio's miniperl 6 implementation</li>
<li>I wonder if we should use that inside of TGE</li>
<li>or a language like that</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Larry:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>I saw that he has objects working on Parrot right now with that</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Patrick:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>that might simplify the initial stages of compiler writing</li>
<li>that wouldn't take too much to implement it as a native compiler under Parrot</li>
<li>it wouldn't be too hard to extend that</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>c:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>does PAST-pm handle the semantics it needs?</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Patrick:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>pretty much</li>
<li>it needs a few more pieces, but I'm happy with what it supports</li>
<li>things seem to be working out pretty well</li>
<li>we need to figure out how to do classes</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>c:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>the tree right now seems to express expressions easily</li>
<li>but there are other entities such as classes and subs that it doesn't</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Patrick:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>we don't have nodes for those yet</li>
<li>but they should be easy to add</li>
<li>I plan to implement those as a specific HLL needs them</li>
<li>Allison needed slurpy for Punie</li>
<li>so we added them there</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>c:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>giving a talk at Portland Perl Mongers tonight</li>
<li>an overview of PIR syntax, a tour of Partridge, and a tour of the source tree</li>
<li>hope to show that we use a lot of Perl 5 and that there are plenty of ways to contribute</li>
<li>also refactoring some grotty C code</li>
<li>that sucks</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Larry:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>isn't that what we've been doing for the past seven years?</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Allison:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>I thought it was more like 20</li>
<li>worked on Punie as a break from PDDs and such</li>
<li>found a weird double-signature of join</li>
<li>launched the objects PDD last week</li>
<li>this week we're pushing to implement what it specifies</li>
<li>clarifying the last-minute inconsistencies found during implementation</li>
<li>the autocloning within certain instantiated class idea didn't work out</li>
<li>now I'm porting the tests of our SMOP prototype to the new implementation</li>
<li>give it a complete run through the metamodel</li>
<li>Patrick, I checked in a couple of TODO tests for Punie</li>
<li>they're for parameter passing (slurpy and flattening)</li>
<li>if it gets working sometime in the near future, they'll start to pass</li>
<li>I also added <code>is_slurpy()</code> to <code>PAST::Var</code> </li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>c:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>I should be able to add the TODO test checker pretty transparently</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Nicholas:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>Patrick committed a change to S05 a while back</li>
<li>it moved things over by a column and made it preformatted text</li>
<li>POD 6 supports tables...</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Damian:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>basic tables</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Nicholas:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>will the Synopses move over to POD 6 to take advantage of its better features?</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Allison:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>our tools to publish them on the web site don't support POD 6 at the moment</li>
<li>not right away</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Larry:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>that'll be something we can delegate eventually</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Damian:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>the only two translators with this module are to plain text and to XHTML</li>
<li>the XHTML one is purely descriptive</li>
<li>you can put any CSS stylesheet on it to get the appearance you want</li>
<li>we may end up with a better outcome anyway</li>
<li>have people redo their CSS to take advantage of the output of the new features of POD</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Allison:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>when I added XHTML output to <code>POD::Simple</code>, I found a lot of other features with <code>POD::Simple</code> that people use</li>
<li>generate ToC or process large batches of files with intertextual links</li>
<li>I know we'll have to add support for that somehow</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Damian:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>that's one of the goals of POD 6</li>
<li>semantic markup, even if we had to fudge <code>I&gt;&lt; and <code>B&gt;&lt;</code> </code> </li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Larry:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>if they believe us...</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Damian:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>I think we can sell it</li>
<li>well, I think I<i> can sell it</i> </li>
<li>I'm also contemplating revisiting formats in S07</li>
<li>figure it's worth seeing if simplifications are possible</li>
<li>I've had plenty of time to play with the module written for it</li>
<li>can see what's useful and not so common</li>
<li>I'll do that when I get some time</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Nicholas:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>are there any formal plans on how <code>pack</code> and <code>unpack</code> will work?</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Larry:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>view them as a co-processor type of sublanguage</li>
<li>you can derive the <code>pack</code> and <code>unpack</code> templates from more than just hard-wired "here's how you do it"</li>
<li>you can ask a class for its <code>pack</code> or <code>unpack</code> template</li>
<li>otherwise they're pretty much the same</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Nicholas:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>I figure you're basically happy with how it works</li>
<li>it'll basically work the same</li>
<li>so you won't have to spec it in detail</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Larry:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>basically yes</li>
<li>we have to make sure that the underlying API is sane</li>
<li>then people can build on top of it as needed</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Jesse:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>We've got our first two Perl 6 microgrants.</li>
<li>Steve Peters is working on improving Parrot portability and putting structure in place to make sure it stays portable.</li>
<li>Phil Krow is working on DBIv2 hackery as a combined P6/DBI microgrant. My best understanding is that he's basically doing an h2ph for Java code (particularly the JDBC)</li>
