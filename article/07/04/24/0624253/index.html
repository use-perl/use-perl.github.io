I no longer buy into the 'we will release when it's ready' perspective. At some point, it's just wanking--by the time you decide it's ready, Python, Ruby, and probably some feverish dream will have made Perl a language of the past.<br/><br/>The preponderance of Linux has made bash, awk, and sed more attractive--and very stable. Combining those languages into an as yet undefined Perl6 is *not* a winning combination. Particularly as the CPAN which Perl mongers seem so proud of is a largely uncontrolled mess--there is no central QA. Any piece of crap seems able to make it into the CPAN.<br/><br/>Yes, I commonly want better data structures than bash offers. But I need something *now*, a la Python. Frankly, I'm tired of hearing about Perl6, and vaporware VMs. Ship, Real Soon Now, or you're going to be justifiably regarded as a largely acedemic exercise.<br/><br/>Hint--microgrants aren't the way forward. The amount of money involved isn't that large. They are the death knell. When you meander, and want trivial bucks vice doing it for love, you are dead, dead, dead.<br/><br/>Show me the code. Something stable, that I can program against. I mostly use Perl in an Apache context. For God's sakes, how long will it take to produce a stable and advanced ModPerl, given your track record so far?

<p>Do you know how little manpower actually is behind the whole thing? Everyone <em>wants it now</em>, but people actually <em>doing</em> something about getting it now are a damn sight rarer.</p>

I use the CPAN. Some of it is *great*. Some of it is more or less vital, for some of the things I do. As in not always having OS-native tools for things like current cryptographic hashes. Linux md5sum and sha1sum do not always satisfy the need. But in too many cases, you have to do to much legwork researching overall quality, and it's easier to just write what you need, and get an internal code review organized.<br><br>"Do you know how little manpower actually is behind the whole thing?"<br><br>That explains the *problem*, but it's not something that gives me confidence in a forthcoming Perl6.<br><br>"And if you end up using it once it&#8217;s ready in spite of your claims now that it will end up being an academic excercise, be prepared to be called on your bluff."<br><br>Fully prepared, I guess. I don't know about calling this a "bluff" though. I can't see how that term applies, in this context. I fully expect to be using at least bits and pieces of an emerging Perl6--I already am. But it's becoming more and more painful. I am not sanguine re: future support needs.<br><br>If it's taking roughly forever, and the explanation is that there are few people working on it, why would I be somehow reassured? I'm *not* wishing for the death of Perl. I would *hugely* rather smooth and happy ports to Perl6. But there are things I have to do in fairly short order, it's *still* not ready, and I'm going to end up migrating a bunch of code to Python.<br><br>Painful? You bet. The last code migrated was slower. Enough that I'm going to have to write some C, and the code review on that is going to *suck*. Another factor is that I do some minimal (hardened) Linux systems. A minimal SuSE system doesn't include Python. So now I have to look at multiple versions to cover both SuSE and Red Hat, think about going to C for everything, or other madness, and I can't stall any longer. The need is very much there, and I'm getting sniped at.<br><br>Most systems are Red Hat, where a minimal system *does* give me Python, which is a definite factor to consider.<br><br>This isn't an antiPerl rant. It's more in the nature of a howl of pain.<br><br>I was lurking on the list when what I think was the the first Linux FHS was being defined, back in 2000 or so. The vendors just wanted *something* and the designers couldn't get their act together. I would argue that the Linux community is paying the penalty for that, to this day.<br><br>I've a very bad taste left over from that. Not getting the concepts of 'window of opportunity', and 'deliverables' is not a Good Thing. I don't hate Perl--I fear for Perl.<br><br>

<p>I don't get it.  Why are the minimal systems that include Python going to jump up and suddenly include Perl 6 when it comes out, which is a completely different language from Perl 5?</p>

<p>And why the urgent need to, if your code is in Perl 5, migrate it to Perl 6, which is a completely different language?  Or, if you are developing new code, why the need to do it in Perl 6 instead of Perl 5?</p>

<p>You've got to do "stuff" in fairly short order.  What?  You have code you're considering migrating to Python or C.  You imply a desperate need to migrate to Perl 6.  Why??  It's presumably in Perl 5 -- isn't leaving it in Perl 5 cheaper than migrating to any of those other options?</p>

<p>Your obvious solution is to stick with Perl 5, a language with a bright future and plenty of support, at least until Perl 6 arrives, if it ever does.  And since your comments ignore the obvious (cheapest) solution, I suspect you're doing so intentionally in order to come up with this artificial urgency so you can troll Perl in general because Perl 6 isn't here.</p>

<p>That's a standard, passive-aggressive blackmail tactic.  "If you don't do what I want RIGHT NOW, I will leave and take my non-contributing, useless, whiny stop energy somewhere else."</p>

"I suspect you're doing so intentionally in order to come up with this artificial urgency so you can troll Perl in general because Perl 6 isn't here."<br/><br/>Not the case. I'm faced with a couple of cases where companies are choosing between LAMP (Perl) and Java/Python (leaning more toward Java, after calling around, catching people at home on a Saturday), and have some anecdotal evidence from people I trust, that it's not just me.<br/><br/>The issue is that managers aren't seeing Perl 5 &amp; 6 as separate languages. In terms of high level languages, they are seeing things in blanket terms of Perl, Python, Java, or Ruby, and versions need not apply. Granted, this is a limited sample, but the signal is very strong.<br/><br/>I don't know what management rags they may be reading, but I do know that a lot of what I do will be handed down by edict. It doesn't have to make sense, and there's nothing in particular that I can do about it. Arguing in mgmnt meetings just gets me brushed off and/or sniped at from the Java guys, in a couple of cases that are fairly important.<br/><br/>That's about as pleasant as you'd imagine it to be. Not at all.<br/><br/>Sorry you suspect me of being a troll. But situations differ, and I'm not at liberty to  completely describe mine. I've been as up front as I can. It will have to do, and if it wasn't enough, well, it wasn't enough. It was still the best I could do.

<p>You get paid to deal with your clueless management.  The Perl 6 community does not.  If your management isn't interested in being technically astute enough to figure out that Perl 5 is a well-supported language with a well-supported future, your company deserves what it gets for having them.</p>

OK, I can see where that viewpoint comes from, and it's difficult to argue against it.<br><br>My original post seems to have generated more heat than light--accusations of trolling, insults, etc. But if you check out the entire thread, I at least offered to pitch in with some doc writing or testing. I really don't care for writing doc, spare time is limited, etc. I could apply all the usual excuses.<br><br>But the offer *was* on the table. Your reply was, in essence, "You have a problem, not us. Deal with it on your own." There's a great community-builder.<br><br>OK, enough is enough. I'll take your suggestion, and deal with it on my own. Sadly (for me), dealing with it probably doesn't involve deploying much new Perl. It's difficult to see how this discussion has added anything I could take to (admittedly lame) IT mgmnt as a positive. From my POV, there were things that I was worried about, and in the final analysis, I couldn't easily find a mechanism whereby I could contribute, according to my skill level (not a language implementer). A mere user, decent doc writer and testing guy, but also something of a decision influencer.<br><br>I don't make final calls, but my walking away means Perl is dead at a Fortune 1000 company, as I was the sole voice supporting it, and had a couple of respect chips I could play. Those are pretty much gone now. All I'll be able to do is maybe get some system reporting stuff done, as a holding action against how much Java is costing us. Sweet. I am now an official bag-holder.<br><br>So you've successfully taken out the non-language-implementer trash. Congratulations, and flame on, if you think this is a win for Perl. I won't be seeing perl.org posts in future, so it's not as if it's going to cause me any more pain.<br><br>Color me disgusted.<br><br>Best of luck, folks. I really do wish the Perl community well, but I'm not going there again. I just don't see the risk as commensurate with potential rewards.<br>

<p>I don&#8217;t see your comment quite as negatively as jdavidb or chromatic, but&#8230;</p>

<p>See, there are a lot of people, who, like you, are seeing the same danger and ringing the alarms. The problem is, just because a lot of people are ringing the alarms everywhere, that doesn&#8217;t actually get anything <em>done</em>. It&#8217;s all well and fine to yell that the house is on fire, but if noone actually starts passing buckets to put the fire out, the house will burn down in spite of the screams.</p>

<p>You aren&#8217;t wrong with what you&#8217;re saying. Indeed, the longer Perl 6 takes, the more opportunities will be missed. But regardless of how many people point this out, the work won&#8217;t get done any sooner for it. If all the people who think it&#8217;s taking too long and think it needs to be done would not stop at warning about the imminent danger, but would actually step in to lend a hand, there wouldn&#8217;t be any imminent danger to warn about anymore.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong. I&#8217;m not accusing you personally. You may have good reasons for not contributing. The problem is that collectively, so does everyone else! Hence, Perl 6 is not getting done.</p>

<p>How do we break through that?</p>

<p>Beats me.</p>

"You may have good reasons for not contributing."<br><br>I feel that I have two good reasons:<br>1) I don't believe that I have the talent.

<p>To be honest: I can&#8217;t help. I haven&#8217;t pitched in appreciably either, just watched.</p>

Another reason I could think of would be: you're watching the video on your browser using FLV as a format. You can download higher quality video in the DivX format, from the right box of the video. That might increase the quality a bit.

The slides should make it much more useful. I haven't thought of that. Thank you for the suggestion, Tatsuhiko!<br/><br/>As for DivX, do you mean the one on Google Video? It's still unreadable<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:(

To me most slides are readable, excpet a few ones with small fonts. Just download it to your desktop and fullscreen it and it'd get much better. In any case you have the original slides...
