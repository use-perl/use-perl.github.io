<p>A commit by Larry Wall introduced user-definable array indexing.
Darren Duncan wondered how one could declare an anonymous multidimensional
array value which is compatible with the system Larry introduced.
Larry explained that the semicolon notation is intended for slicing
subscripts, which are two-dimensional, and it is therefore convenient
to represent one dimension with a semicolon.  There was further
discussion on the syntax.</p>

<p>James Keenan explained that refactoring in <code>Configure.pl</code> had exposed
two bugs in the file.  He submitted a patch in ticket <a href="http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=42082">[perl #42082]</a>
which corrects the problems in the trunk.  Joshua Isom had some questions
about the supposed bugs; James explained why he considered them
problems.  Eventually the patch was applied as r17899.</p>

<p>This thread began with Klaas-Jan Stol asking about the syntax for
constructing new objects because he thought that it was going to
be changed.  Allison Randal replied with examples of the two proposals
for the new syntax.  </p>

<p>This led Alek Storm to ask if <code>new()</code> would be
a vtable method or a PCCMETHOD.  Jonathan Worthington confirmed
that it is a PCCMETHOD.  Allison elaborated that it is a class method.</p>

<p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/128db22e345a6735/8b54b799cd749ddc?#8b54b799cd749ddc">[perl #37997] r10604 build failure on Cygwin</a> </i> </p>
<p>In ticket <a href="http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=37997">[perl #37997]</a>, Ron Blaschke reported that <code>make test</code>
fails on Cygwin for r10604, whereas r17772 builds without a problem.
Joshua Gatcomb expressed his surprise, as he had not heard of anyone
getting Parrot to work on Cygwin for several months.</p>

<p>Eric Hanchrow offered to occasionally do a test build on his Cygwin
system.  Bernhard Schmalhofer suggested that Eric use the smoke system
as documented in <code>docs/tests.pod</code>.  Eric later reported that he
could not get r17772 working.  Paul Cochrane seconded Eric's report.
Ron suggested using the absolute path for PATH, rather than just
<code>blib/lib</code>.  Eric got a bit further using this approach, but then he
had another failure.</p>

<p>Ron also noted that a few of the stm tests hang, which prevents
smoking on Cygwin.  chromatic asked if this was <code>t/pmc/stmlog.t</code>,
but Ron thought it was <code>t/stm/queue.t</code> and <code>t/stm/runtime.t</code>.</p>

<p>Steve Peters reported that a couple of functions are trying to return
values from void functions.  He included a patch in ticket <a href="http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=42110">[perl #42110]</a>.
Andrew Dougherty remarked that he had submitted the same patch the
previous week, but not in RT.  The patch was applied as r17793.</p>

<p>Steve hoped there was a GCC warning flag which would catch this situation,
but Nicholas Clark replied that he didn't think it was possible to look
for this.  He wondered if some other compilers could be coaxed into
protesting.  There was some discussion between Leopold Toetsch, Nicholas,
Steve and chromatic over the value of <code>-ansi -pedantic</code>.</p>

<p>In ticket <a href="http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=42151">[perl #42151]</a>, Steve Peters submitted a patch to clean
up some casting instances.  Kevin had a related request.  Andy
Dougherty also had a suggestion.  Steve said that he intended to look
at some of these ideas more closely as he worked on the project.
chromatic and Leopold Toetsch also joined the thread.</p>

<p>Allison Randal posted a discussion of the draft document
'Parallel development requirements,' which was announced in
thread '<a href="%2320070327125201.41679.qmail@spout.spiders.net">ParrotCode meeting this week</a>'.</p>

<p>There were some suggestions on how to improve the smoking system.
For instance, Nicholas Clark noted that the Perl 5 system reports
failures to perl5-porters, but the Parrot smoke failures aren't
reported in a similar way.  Another discussion involved commits
which violate the coding standards.</p>

<p>Many people contributed to this thread, and also to the IRC
conversation which Allison posted.</p>

<p>Alek Storm created ticket <a href="http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=42155">[perl #42155]</a> to offer a patch which moved
variables from <code>Parrot_Interp</code> to <code>Parrot_Context</code>.  He noted that it
broke some tests, and anyone who could figure out what the problem is
will get a hug.</p>

<p>Leopold Toetsch replied that it was deliberate that these variables
were not in the Context structure.  Alek replied that some of them
already are in <code>Parrot_Context</code> and this patch simply moves the rest
of them.  Leopold and Alek had some further discussion on the matter.
chromatic added his thoughts as well.  Some benchmarking was done
in an attempt to calculate the performance of Parrot before and after
the patch.  Joshua Isom also tested it.</p>

new patch was applied as r17859.</p>

<p>Klaas-Jan Stol was responsible for the file in question, but could

in r17863.</p>

<p>chromatic noted that it would be easy to make it a gettable/settable
interpreter property and wondered if it would be of any use.  Paul
Cochrane replied that it already is that type of property, and that
it would probably be valuable to be able to set the value at runtime.
Leopold Toetsch reported that the interpreter already has it.</p>

<p>Alberto Sim&otilde;es
mentioned a conference on languages, compilers and interpreters in
Portugal.  He thought it might be a good occasion to make a scientific
publication about Parrot.  Alberto felt that bringing Parrot to the

universities and Parrot.  He offered to help with accommodation
but not with writing the talk.</p>

<p>Jonathan Worthington thought it was a good idea although he wouldn't

will compile Perl 5 code to Parrot.  He wanted to name it 'rindolf'
and wondered if Punie would be a good basis for the effort.  He also
wanted to know if he could have commit access to the repository.</p>

<p>Allison Randal replied that it was an unusual approach and that she had
doubts about the implementation plan, but that she would be interested
in knowing what obstacles and successes came out of the effort.
She thought that Punie would not be useful to Shlomi, given his plan.
Her suggestion with regard to the repository was that he develop
outside the tree and distribute it as a separate loadable module.</p>

<p>Shlomi argued for being liberal with commit bits, and expressed his
concern that the name Punie suggests that it is a toy.  There was some
continued discussion on these points, and also on Shlomi's proposal.</p>
