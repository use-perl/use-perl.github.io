<p>-- Larry Wall, in 'Enhancing array indices'</p></p>
<p><p> <b>Language</b> </p>
<p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/2957f76d8dceb7d6/9556a6089cbfa8d8?#9556a6089cbfa8d8">[svn:perl6-synopsis] r13540 - doc/trunk/design/syn</a> </i> </p>
<p>A commit from Larry Wall reorganized S03.  This led Nicholas Clark to
comment that the sequencing operator is not defined.  He had a few other
notes about the commit.  John Macdonald responded to Nicholas's question "Is
it defined that <code>$a + $b</code> evaluates the arguments in any particular order?"
by stating that in C, it is deliberately left undefined to allow the code
generator more flexibility.  Aaron Crane also spoke up, further explaining
how C functions.</p>

<p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/457b54e2589cb57f/df1f995cd2b93d1d?#df1f995cd2b93d1d">[svn:perl6-synopsis] r13543 - doc/trunk/design/syn</a> </i> </p>
<p>In this commit, Larry Wall clarified <code>gather</code> and <code>take</code>.  Gaal Yahas
wanted to know what it means for <code>take</code> to be evaluated in void context.
He included some example code and asked what the result would be.</p>

<p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/bf3d8e360b800624/809585d38f09a127?#809585d38f09a127">[svn:perl6-synopsis] r13545 - doc/trunk/design/syn</a> </i> </p>
<p>Larry Wall applied some clarifications which were suggested by Gaal Yahas.
Gaal, however, had some more questions.  This concerned <code>gather</code> in S04.
These were addressed in Larry's next commit.</p>

<p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/b84dc8710beb18da/09a75dac10d310ef?#09a75dac10d310ef">Typology of auto*crement</a> </i> </p>
<p>Larry Wall replied to a comment by TSa in another thread, wherein
TSa wondered if <code>++</code> and <code>--</code> coerce Nums to Ints.  Larry stated that
since a Str remains a Str in a similar situation, the Num should also
retain its type.  One exception that he could see would be that incrementing
an Undef would create an Int.</p>

<p>In thread '<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/a79c24e250dbdafc/0a8366f7216b06e3?#0a8366f7216b06e3">Int-to-Num autocoercion</a>', Larry expanded on
how coercions are handled in functions.  He said that Num to Int
autocoercion is an explicit exception which is expected by Perl 5
programmers, and Str to Num (and the inverse) are also done automatically
at times.  Larry further explained that there had been numerous discussions
on the subject, and the general feeling is that exotic types should not
autocoerce unless a multi has been declared to handle the situation.</p>

<p>TSa made a reference to the long-running
'<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/3d3965e2b54a5a08/feaba31d6dd8fe0a?#feaba31d6dd8fe0a">Numeric Semantics</a>'
to discuss how auto-coercion would work with <code>floor</code>.  Darren Duncan
replied that a <code>floor</code> would return an Int by definition, so that it
would in fact be a way of explicitly converting.</p>

<p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/c6116a1884078a58/8db551e3b7208164?#8db551e3b7208164">[svn:perl6-synopsis] r13549 - doc/trunk/design/syn</a> </i> </p>
<p>Larry Wall made a commit which disabled negative subscript 'dwimmery' for
shaped arrays, which can now take <code>+</code> and <code>-</code> operators.  He then wondered
if a multidimensional <code>Whatever (**)</code> would mean the same thing in "whatever"
dimensions.</p>

<p>David Green noted that the subject of ordinals had come up some time ago,
and quoted a message from Larry dating back to 2004.  He added his thoughts
to the subject as well.</p>

<p>Blair Sutton felt that Perl 6 should stick with 0 as the first element
of a list to avoid alienating programmers from most other languages.
He thought that it could be adjusted by a user-defined Parrot grammar for
those who didn't like the traditional starting value, although he had
personally never required that feature.</p>

<p>Smylers was of
the opinion that a pragma is overkill, and a global variable would be
sufficient.  Jonathan Scott Duff responded that a pragma would be useful
to Pascal or Fortran programmers, and therefore it would be handy to have
a pragma.  Rafael Garcia-Suarez added that <code>$[</code> is a pragma in Perl 5.</p>

<p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/eeabf8a2bcbf00e6/78064019fd0c9c93?#78064019fd0c9c93">[svn:perl6-synopsis] r13550 - doc/trunk/design/syn</a> </i> </p>
<p>Larry Wall made a commit concerning <code>*+</code> versus <code>*-</code> in subscripts.
TSa replied that the distinction between the cases would be that they
dispatch to different functions: <code>*</code> to <code>postcircumfix</code>, <code>*+</code> to
<code>infix:&lt;+&gt;</code> and <code>*-</code> to <code>infix:&lt;-&gt;</code>.  TSa asked some questions based
upon this observation.</p>

<p>Larry responded that he did not want Whatever to package the array.
He felt that in TSa's example, it would be necessary to dispatch to
Whatever and let the Whatever code extract relevant information relating
to <code>*</code>.  TSa requested further information.</p>

<p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/4eaa34515427805f/6d89118c08747b90?#6d89118c08747b90">Enhancing array indices</a> </i> </p>
<p>Jonathan Lang wondered if it would be possible to get a single-character
symbol which could be used in an array index to refer to its shape, for
example something like <code>@x[*.head]</code>.  Larry Wall replied that a recent
suggestion was to use a syntax like <code>@x[*+0]</code>.  There was further
discussion on syntax possibilities, with Jonathan, Darren Duncan and
TSa joining the thread.  Darren proposed getting rid of negative
subscripts and using only terms like <code>@foo[*.head]</code>, which he felt
had the advantage of being more consistent (for shaped and unshaped
arrays), and easier to learn.</p>

<p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/8a4802970079d51b/af9023725f169c96?#af9023725f169c96">[svn:perl6-synopsis] r13555 - doc/trunk/design/syn</a> </i> </p>
<p>Although he admitted that the month of Nob is cute, Larry Wall nevertheless
changed S01's last modified date to Nov.  In a followup commit, Larry changed
the date to Jan.</p>

<p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/90df702a896761fd/c4af7a5d68634f6b?#c4af7a5d68634f6b">[svn:perl6-synopsis] r13564 - doc/trunk/design/syn</a> </i> </p>
<p>Larry Wall made a commit to allow colon pair syntax for a method-like
sort of filetest.  Smylers liked the changes, but was concerned about
<code>filename.TEST</code> because there are only so many permutations of the word
available for testing frameworks.  Larry listed a host of other possible
names, and was leaning toward <code>STATUS</code>.</p>

<p>Alek Storm submitted a patch as ticket <a href="http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=41364">[perl #41364]</a>.  The
patch allows object vtable method overrides for a number routines,
such as <code>find_method</code> and <code>get_attr</code>.  He also wondered if the
double-underscore method of overriding could be deprecated now
that there is the :vtable flag.  Patrick R. Michaud responded
that the deprecation cannot take place until ticket
<a href="http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=40626">[perl #40626]</a> is resolved.</p>

<p>Jerry Gay mentioned that he had written tests for the ParrotIO object,
which he included as a patch.  He also had some questions about PDD 22.
Allison Randal answered the questions.</p>

<p>Aldo Calpini wrote of an interest in porting Parrot to the PocketPC.
CeGCC is a Windows port of gcc which produces ARM executable code.
The first attempt at porting went well.  A report of the procedure
was included in the post.</p>

<p>In ticket <a href="http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=41371">[perl #41371]</a>, Jerry Gay noted that in r16834 he had
committed <code>docs/roles_responsibilities.pod</code>.  He asked project members
to review it before the 0.4.9 release.</p>

<p>Klaas-Jan Stol remarked that he was trying to set up a test harness for
PIR.  It appeared that the module <code>PIR.pm</code> was not used, and he was
unable to find documents on how to set it up.  He offered to patch the
compiler FAQ once someone explains it to him.</p>

<p>Will Coleda explained that the problem was with the name of the language,
with 'PIR' being reserved for internal testing.  Therefore either
<code>lib/Parrot/Test.pm</code> would require modification, or the language should
be renamed, for instance to 'PIR_PGE'.  With Will's advice Klaas-Jan
was able to get it working.</p>

<p> <i> <a href="http://news.gmane.org/find-root.php?message_id=3C45BF4395.2080800&amp;%2337;40gmail.com&amp;%2337;3E">[PATCH] Updates for languages/PIR</a> </i> </p>
<p>Klaas-Jan Stol submitted a patch to improve PIR.  It includes a test
suite, and corrections to several other files.  Later, in
'<a href="http://news.gmane.org/find-root.php?message_id=%3C45BFDA28.6090804%40gmail.com%3E">[PATCH] languages/PIR tests</a>', and '<a href="http://news.gmane.org/find-root.php?message_id=%3C45C0B2C1.9060100%40gmail.com%3E">[PATCH] languages/PIR more testing and fixing</a>',
he posted additional tests and corrections.  Later there was also
'<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/c2707d5c09b86adc/d2b56d59b4ddf85b?#d2b56d59b4ddf85b">[PATCH] PIR updates</a>', which was applied as r16892.</p>

<p>James E Keenan asked some questions with the intention of determining
what part of Parrot he should focus on and try to encourage others to
look at.  He asked what code remains to be written before an alpha
release can be made, and what skills are needed to produce that code.</p>

<p>Allison Randal replied that the systems needing the most work are:
IO, Events, Threads, Compiler tools interface, Object support, and
Exceptions.  She felt people with C skills are useful, as are people
with general experience in dynamic languages.</p>

<p>James then asked what the learning curve is for PIR.  chromatic
answered that the 'Parrot Essentials' book is still useful, although
it is missing some of the more advanced features.  He thought that
it might be worth asking O'Reilly if the tutorial section could be
expanded into public documentation, as there's currently no tutorial
on PIR.</p>

<p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/1a7e7d71e2233828/dba75081b6fb026a?#dba75081b6fb026a">[perl #41380] [PATCH]:  docs/roles_responsibilities.pod:  Minor grammatical corrections </a> </i> </p>
<p>James Keenan submitted a patch to the roles and responsibilities file.
It corrected punctuation errors and was applied as r16850.  The patch
was ticket <a href="http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=41380">[perl #41380]</a>.</p>

<p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/f857a03024276422/836aeae6c96212bb?#836aeae6c96212bb">On PASM and PIR registers</a> </i> </p>
<p>Klaas-Jan Stol wondered if PASM registers are still needed, except
for backwards compatibility, now that there are PIR registers.
Leopold Toetsch replied that PASM registers are physically allocated
in the Parrot virtual machine, whereas PIR registers are virtual
registers.  Both types are needed.</p>

<p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/0fc9870dd0aa0648/ae59d7988e83e8a3?#ae59d7988e83e8a3">[perl #41386] MANIFEST must die. </a> </i> </p>
<p>Will Coleda created ticket <a href="http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=41386">[perl #41386]</a> to express his opinion
that <code>MANIFEST</code> should not be part of the repository.  He pointed
out that the purpose of this file is to make sure that the general
release isn't missing any files, something you already know to be
true when you are working with a repository.  He suggested creating
it when the release is generated.</p>

<p>Allison Randal disagreed.  She believes that the purpose of a MANIFEST
is to tell you which files should be included in a distribution.  She
thought <code>MANIFEST.skip</code>, on the other hand, could be generated from
the <code>svn:ignore</code> keyword before the distribution is created.</p>

<p>chromatic included a quick Perl program which writes a C program
which makes a self-contained executable for a Parrot program.
He thought that it was fairly cross-platform compatible, although
there could be an issue with big-endian processors.</p>

<p> <i> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/66507a6147f6edd4/0e9839e88c885097?#0e9839e88c885097">PMC Tools Test Failure</a> </i> </p>
<p>chromatic reported a failure with the buildtools tests following a <code>make
realclean</code> and a Configure.  James E Keenan responded that he's experienced
it infrequently and thinks that it is a poorly-designed test rather than
a real failure.  There was a brief discussion on how to improve the
test, with James suggesting that perhaps someone who was involved
with the original development of <code>pmc2c.pl</code> could explain what is
happening in the <code>DO_A_DUMP</code> loop.</p>

<p>Klaas-Jan Stol gave a brief history of how IMCC started, noting that
it was eventually merged with Parrot as its parser, and since that
time there have been several additions.  He wondered if it is still
the case that every PIR construct also has a PASM form, and if every
PIR construct can be directly translated to PASM.  Allison Randal
replied that that was the ideal situation, but in practice many
tests are written in PIR, so there may not be complete coverage for
the PASM syntax versions.</p>
