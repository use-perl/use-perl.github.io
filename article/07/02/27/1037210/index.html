<p><p>The Perl 6 design team met by phone on 21 February 2007.  Larry, Damian, Allison, Patrick, Jesse, and chromatic attended.  These are the minutes.</p></p>
<p><p> <strong>Larry:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>cooking right along</li>
<li>mostly hacking more on the grammar</li>
<li>it's largely done</li>
<li>doing some cleanup on metaoperator precedence</li>
<li>some have to inherit precedence from their internal operators</li>
<li>others force precedence</li>
<li>the only remaining thing is working out how various quote sublanguages build themselves and parse their text</li>
<li>building it such that the mechanism is derivable in other grammars</li>
<li>sort of a two-dimensional derivability problem</li>
<li>kinda tricky</li>
<li>figuring out exactly how grammar modifications fit into the user space when they say "I want to use such and such a language"</li>
<li>replace the current language?</li>
<li>overlay the new language?</li>
<li>replace the rest of this scope?</li>
<li>compilation unit?</li>
<li>what is a scope in a different language anyway?</li>
<li>lots of interesting wrinkles</li>
<li>had a Perl Monks chat about timely destruction and decent destruction control flow</li>
<li>also tweaking various Synopses</li>
<li>simplified the zip and cross operators</li>
<li>now just a <code>Z</code> and an <code>X</code> infix</li>
<li>the old <code>x</code> which was a string operator is now a metaoperator</li>
<li>the two main list infix operators are <code>Z</code> and <code>X</code> </li>
<li>the yen operator goes away</li>
<li>don't remember if I did the MMD rethink before or after next week</li>
<li>looked at last autumn's voting MMD algorithm</li>
<li>it's a bit too complicated</li>
<li>I recast the whole thing in terms of a topologically sorted list</li>
<li>sorted in partial ordering of betterness</li>
<li>demoted the single semicolon to a conjectural syntax</li>
<li>reserved for if we decide we need it</li>
<li>also changed the meaning to insert this method at multiple places in the list</li>
<li>it's easier for me to understand what's going on there</li>
<li>we'll explain to users that it'll look for the best match</li>
<li>if you don't give sufficient hints and it's ambiguous, it'll fail</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Damian:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>in my experience, they're like sausages</li>
<li>people don't want to know how they work as long as they taste right in the end</li>
<li>it is nice to have static analysis to see what gets covered</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Larry:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>we can warn about certain kinds of ambiguity at check time</li>
<li>assuming that no one adds more variants at runtime</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Damian:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>I provided a feature to grab all of the definitions and possible combinations and warn about the ambiguous cases</li>
<li>it's incredibly handy to run when you start getting ambiguities</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Larry:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>also simplified the grammar</li>
<li>had some special syntax for abstracting symbols</li>
<li>turned those into regular named captures</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Damian:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>spent most of my time working on the Perl 6 POD parser</li>
<li>have about 2500 tests</li>
<li>they've found a few things that needed rethinks and redesigns</li>
<li>have one more of those to go</li>
<li>then I think it's releasable</li>
<li>one of the rules in S26 said that a formatting code (<code>B&lt;&gt; or <code>C&lt;&gt;</code>) terminates at the end of the matching angle bracket or the end of the surrounding block construct</code> </li>
<li>that means that you couldn't comment out sections within a formatting code without changing the meaning</li>
<li>that meant I had to rethink the parser to make it work</li>
<li>also sped up the parser a bit</li>
<li>with any luck, it'll be out in a couple of days</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Patrick:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>what's the complexity of parsing the POD?</li>
<li>is it tough, or will our tools handle it well?</li>
<li>plenty of people on #parrot have talked about writing a parser with our tools for it</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Damian:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>that'd be wonderful</li>
<li>my parser uses Perl 5</li>
<li>the design is such that line-by-line parsing is pretty easy</li>
<li>the m//g flag suffices to loop around</li>
<li>I've effectively gone down a level on doing a parser's state machine</li>
<li>the only complexity that I foresee is the <code>allow</code> feature</li>
<li>that changes how something subsequently parses</li>
<li>if I say <code>allow</code> on a block, it changes how that block and inner blocks may parse</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Larry:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>similar to how quote constructs modify things</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Damian:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>I'm struggling with finding a clean and efficient way of allowing that</li>
<li>changes how code block, code formatting, and verbatim rules parse</li>
<li>could lexically change what those rules did</li>
<li>might be easier just to hardcode all of the formatting codes available with on-off switches that the parser allows down</li>
<li>could be a very good use of Larry's contextual variables</li>
<li>that's the only complexity that I see in making it work correctly</li>
<li>the structure of a general block is introducer, name of the block, options, content, terminator</li>
<li>you do have to extract information from the options before you get to the content</li>
<li>that can change the structure of what comes back</li>
<li>that's not difficult to do</li>
<li>you can do code within a regular expression</li>
<li>that allowness changes how the parser works</li>
<li>but I don't see it as being difficult to change to a grammatical parser</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Patrick:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>that helps me know what to advise people</li>
<li>lots of us are eagerly looking forward to a release</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Damian:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>not sure how useful it will be as a template</li>
<li>it uses a very different parsing strategy</li>
<li>I did that to parse large documents (that is, S26) without taking a big performance hit</li>
<li>P::RD and its potentially exponential explosion of cost didn't seem right</li>
<li>my current version is linear</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Larry:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>can other parsers target the test suite?</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Damian:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>not really</li>
<li>"Here's the input and here's the data structure to create"</li>
<li>the data structure is YAML</li>
<li>I don't care about its structure, just that it has certain features</li>
<li>maybe it's reasonably transferrable</li>
<li>depending on the data structures pulled out, they may have to massage it a bit</li>
<li>it's pretty close to data-structure agnostic</li>
<li>I'm happy to make sure that it is, if necessary</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Patrick:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>working on the Parrot release off and on today</li>
<li>lots of little last-minute things</li>
<li>release may happen this evening at the latest</li>
<li>seems to be going well</li>
<li>have some non-P6 things to work on until this weekend</li>
<li>my target for next week is getting <code>for</code> loops and <code>END</code> blocks</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Jesse:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>do you have a bunch of unpushed changes?</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Patrick:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>public Subversion is the current state of my code</li>
<li>I have some non-public throwaways</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Jesse:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>Jerry has mentioned at least that he'd like to see your throwaways</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Patrick:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>we could make a throwaways directory</li>
<li>or branches</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Jesse:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>it might help people</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>c:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>I'd like to see that too</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Patrick:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>I can do that</li>
<li>once I get those bits in, sanity passes</li>
<li>then it's wide open</li>
<li>I can import tests from Pugs, the ones I think are fixable</li>
<li>then point people to fix them</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Allison:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>will you have a small set of things by the Amsterdam Hackathon?</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Patrick:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>the first week of March?</li>
<li>can't promise that</li>
<li>but I can try to have some handoff things</li>
<li>that is one of my targets</li>
<li>I'll be close by then</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Allison:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>technically I was on vacation last week</li>
<li>the biggest thing was a bug-squashing session this weekend</li>
<li>did a large bit of work before everyone else was there</li>
<li>I was ten hours off</li>
<li>closed quite a few tickets</li>
<li>also worked on the IO PDD</li>
<li>plan to review tewk's SMOP port to PMC C code</li>
<li>haven't seen it yet</li>
<li>it's a good start</li>
<li>that's it for me</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>c:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>squashed a lot of bugs</li>
<li>fixed Pheme, but ran into a weird question about variadic subs and multis</li>
<li>I'll show a code example</li>
<li>might be a good Perl 6 question, but maybe just a Parrot question</li>
<li>also made good progress wrapping SVs in PMCs for Ppwnie</li>
<li>ran into a different multi-sub bug with embedded progress</li>
<li>nice that the blocker there was Parrot, not Ppwnie though</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Jesse:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>talking to people at TPF about grant stuff</li>
<li>approached Bill about a microgrant plan six months ago</li>
<li>some money donated to Perl 6 a couple of years ago is still there</li>
<li>convinced Bill of doing five to ten $500 - 1000 grants for small projects</li>
<li>some Parrot, some Pugs</li>
<li>he'll start to push on this</li>
<li>hopefully we'll see this happen in the near future</li>
<li>separate from the regular grant process</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Patrick:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>there are several Perl 6 things that might apply in the near future</li>
</ul></p>
