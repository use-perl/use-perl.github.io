<p>The Minneapolis Perl Mongers have pulled the trigger. They're hosting a one day Perl workshop on February 16th, 2008 at the home of Gopher, the thing that was Web -1. This "<a href="http://www.frozen-perl.org/mpw2008/">Frozen Perl</a>"  event might not be as bad as it sounds. I was in Minneapolis this February and didn't even need a coat. You hardly even have to go outside in that town.<br> <br>There's not much information yet, and no CFP just yet. It's Labor Day weekend, so I imagine they are just slowly pushing stuff out. The theme is "Perl in Practice", which is my favorite sort of topic, so maybe I can pull something out of <i>Mastering Perl</i> for this.<br> <br>The conference is using ACT, so if you've registered for another conference using ACT, you already have an account, can log in, and futz with your profile. You can register for the conference, which really just means addign your name to a list of interested people. There isn't any information on pricing yet.</p>
