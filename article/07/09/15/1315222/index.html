<p>I'm pleased to announce that we've just accepted a Perl 6 Microgrant proposal from Adriano Ferreira to write a series of articles about Perl 6 operators. Adriano's propsal appears below:</p>
<p>NAME<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Proposal for a Perl 6 microgrant "A series of micro-articles at ONLamp"<br> <br>DESCRIPTION<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I plan to write a series of blog entries at ONLamp site (which belongs<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to the O'Reilly Network) on a Perl 6 related subject. The resulting<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; articles will also be integrated into Pugs' documentation and licensed<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; under the same terms. The theme of the series contemplates brief<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; introductions to the myriad of Perl 6 operators to the varied audience<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that reads the site weblogs.<br> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; O'Reilly weblogs<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; http://weblogs.oreilly.com/<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ONLamp (blogs show up at the right)<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; http://www.onlamp.com/<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ONLamp blogs (another view)<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; http://www.oreillynet.com/onlamp/blog/<br> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My initial idea is to approach at each micro-article one operator or a<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; group of closely related operators providing the reader with some small<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; doses of Perl 6 at a light pace. This light pace would be three articles<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; per week, ideally at Monday, Wednesday and Friday.<br> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To enhance the content, each article shall be submitted for review on<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; #perl6 on freenode. This feedback may prevent mistakes and result in<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; more complete discussions of each operator/feature.<br> <br>WHO AM I<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I am a long time lurker at the Perl community, writing ocasionally at my<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; journal at use.perl, releasing modules at CPAN, and strugling to<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; maintain the dual life of a few core modules (namely, Shell, Exporter,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and very recently Pod::Perldoc).<br> <br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By the end of 2005, I have shared with David Landgren the fun of writing<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; perl5-porters summaries (but I had to stop for a lack of tuits). Eh, I<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; missed those times.<br> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Some samples:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; http://dev.perl.org/perl5/list-summaries/2005/20050915.html<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; http://dev.perl.org/perl5/list-summaries/2005/20051226.html<br> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I am currently not well versed at the Perl 6 development, but I believe<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I have what takes to accomplish the simple task proposed in this grant.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It is a chance for me to take a closer look at the current state of the<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Perl 6 art and make something useful at same time for the sake of<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; broadcasting what Perl 6 would look like and mean to developers all<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; around. Of course, in a very humble scale.<br> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I am an (obscure) ONLamp blogger since May 2007.<br> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/au/3044<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (See the BLOG handle.)<br> <br>WHEN IT WILL BE DONE<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Well, Perl 6 has many many operators. Some of them are brand new and<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; deserve more attention. Others are well known and standard and could be<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; discussed in a batch. Anyway they are many.<br> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; From the table in Synopsis 3<br> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/au/3044<br> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I estimate more than 30 articles (which would take more than 10 weeks<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; when publishing 3 per week).<br> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Well, that does not sound convincing. I have to think harder and maybe<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; stand on a compromise on 8 weeks or 24 articles. Suggestions for<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; defining sharper boundaries to these task welcome.<br> <br>PREVIOUS DISCUSSION<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The idea occurred to me only recently. Fl&#225;vio Glock agreed it could be<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; desirable. And so I submitted this.<br> <br>BLOGGING ABOUT PROGRESS<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The progress can measured by the very publishing of the articles on the<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; site. If preferred, I may report this on my use.perl journal as well.<br> <br>A SAMPLE<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I prepared a first sample of the contents of the first articles on the<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; series and put them online in a private site.<br> <br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *   I've got the thumbs-up of James Turner, the ONLamp editor<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/au/2978) as an O'Reilly<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; representative to use ONLamp.</p>
