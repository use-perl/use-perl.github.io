<p><a href="http://use.perl.org/user/schwern/journal/">schwern</a> writes <i>"Some of you may have heard me talking about geek2geek communications lately.  One of the biggest issues is the problem of empathy in electronic communications.  It's really easy to be an ass to a piece of ASCII and forget there's a human whom you're writing to.<br> <br>One way to solve this problem is to attach a face to the text, either in your head or in reality.  Unfortunately, we can't meet everyone face to face in real life.  Fortunately there's already technology to do this and its really simple.  <a href="http://www.gravatar.com/">Gravatars</a>.</i></p>
<p><i>Gravatars are simply small pictures (80 x 80 max) associated with an email address.  Using a specially written URL you ask the Gravatar server to give you the picture for a given email address.  Done!  For example, here's my <a href="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=db1a33946e2a8577b8d3377d0715bf61">gravatar for my CPAN address</a>.  How do you make that magic URL?  Why with <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Gravatar-URL">Gravatar::URL</a> of course.<br> <br>You'll notice I used my CPAN address.  Wouldn't it be neat if other CPAN authors did the same?  Then wouldn't it be even neater if <a href="http://search.cpan.org/">CPAN sites</a> displayed an author's gravatar when you looked at their module?  Then you'd have a face to associate with code, rather than just a name, and maybe be a little be politer when you're about to bitch out the author for their totally obvious and moronic bug.<br> <br>Another handy application is to register a Gravatar for your normal email address, then other people can configure their mail reader to display it.  There's a Thunderbird plugin called <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/addon/393">MessageFaces</a> which displays Gravatars and other face formats when you read a message.<br> <br>Get out there and increase empathy!"</i></p>

Sounds like a good idea to <a href="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=cec6b9b88295ead26c65f8747a76561b" title="gravatar.com">me</a gravatar.com>.

<p>I was having a problem off and on all day, but by the time I just added it to <a href="http://www.kentcowgill.org/blog/" title="kentcowgill.org">my blog</a kentcowgill.org> - I guess the issue got worked out.</p>

<p>For you viewing pleasure, my new gravatar is <a href="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=5d78b9a4140de578771afdf5809c8815" title="gravatar.com">here</a gravatar.com>.</p>



<h2>No thanks</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/hex/">hex</a> on 2007-09-10T10:11:47</h3>
This would have been a good idea if it was keyed to an OpenID identity, not an email address. I use a different email address (foo@, bar@,<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...) for every site I sign up to. So maintaining it would be a royal pain in the ass, not least to mention that this guy wants you to pay him money for having more than one email address.
<p>
Plus, it's one more annoying thing to have to register for. If I could log into it with my OpenID identity, that'd be no effort at all. And anything OpenID-conversant could query Gravatar to see if a given OpenID has an icon associated with it. But you can't do that, so I'll pass.</p>

<h3><a href="/user/Aristotle/">Aristotle</a> on 2007-09-10T18:04:05</h3>
<p>You could stick an email address in your OpenID profile and the other system could query Gravatar with that.</p>

<p>Of course that requires implementer buy-in&#8230;</p>



<h2>OpenID would be great, but...</h2>

&lt;Jayne&gt;If wishes were horses we'd all be eatin' steak!&lt;/Jayne:&gt;<br><br>While I agree, OpenID would be the cat's pajamas, there's a certain question of pragmatism.<br><br>To use OpenIDs would require...<br><br>1) Changing PAUSE's author data to associate an OpenID with each PAUSE identity.<br>2) Enhance the PAUSE interface to allow authors to add their OpenID.<br>3) Get authors to sign up with OpenID.<br>4) Get authors to tell PAUSE their OpenID.<br>5) Get Gravatar to work with OpenID.<br>6) Get authors to sign up with Gravatar using OpenID.<br><br>Whew.  That looks like a lot of work, and asking a bunch things I don't control to change, and getting other people to do work and a lot of waiting while it all gets done.<br><br>OR!<br><br>1) I hack up a quick CPAN module to generate gravatar URLs<br>2) Ask Graham to plop it onto search<br>3) Get authors to sign up for Gravatar using their cpan.org address which everyone already has.<br><br>In the interest of JFDI I JFDidI.<br><br>I'd love to see OpenID information added to PAUSE though.

<h2>Can't get it to work... :-( perl encoding issue?!</h2>

I tried the naive approach by simply doing<br><br><code>perl -MDigest::MD5 -e 'print Digest::MD5::md5_hex("rgiersig@cpan.org"), "\n"'</code><br><br>which gives me <code>42675453fde7b6ee681e9c0ded931c00</code>, but this doesn't work. I tried to verify with<br><br><code>perl -MDigest::MD5 -e 'print Digest::MD5::md5_hex("mschwern@cpan.org"), "\n"'</code><br><br>which gives me <code>61c2a42ed105748d58b7b2f7ac3cd712</code>, but the article says <code>db1a33946e2a8577b8d3377d0715bf61</code>.<br><br>An encoding issue?!

<p>Nope.  It's your <code>@</code>.</p>

<p>Try instead:</p>

<code>
perl -MDigest::MD5 -e 'print Digest::MD5::md5_hex( q(mschwern@cpan.org) ), "\n"'

Turn on warnings.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)  Yes, even in a one-liner.  My fingers are practically hard-wired to type "-wle".

Good advice... thanks!<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<p>
But I guess you meant "-we" (which is really easy to type), not "-wle"...</p><p>
<br>
Anyway, now I'm waiting for the positive effect that my gravatar on <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/rgiersig/" title="cpan.org">CPAN</a cpan.org>  will have on the support requests...<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)</p>

<p>No, actually the <code>-l</code> gives you a little extra help too, it saves you from having to print <code>"\n"</code>.</p>

<p>So your one-liner could've just been:</p>

<code>
perl -MDigest::MD5 -wle 'print Digest::MD5::md5_hex( q(mschwern@cpan.org) )'
</code>

<h2>KISS Army!</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/TorgoX/">TorgoX</a> on 2007-09-12T22:15:46</h3>
I guess the K.I.S.S. solution to
this  (involving
no new services being used, etc)
would be for everyone interested
to just upload a me.jpg to their PAUSE
directory, and then having some trivial program
routinely police that such files are in fact JPEGs,
and do in fact meet the image-size and
file-size criteria, under penalty of
that jpeg being loudly and shamingly
deleted.



<blockquote>

<h2>Re:KISS Army!</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Alias/">Alias</a> on 2007-09-14T05:32:00</h3>
I believe the other big problem is that most files are treated in archive mode? So they aren't allowed to be changed?



<blockquote>

<h2>Re:KISS Army!</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/TorgoX/">TorgoX</a> on 2007-09-15T05:58:51</h3>
Oh crap, I think you're right.  Some exception
to this would have to be made for me.jpg files.  Altho, presumably this would be one line of code, and the least of anyone's worries.

YAPC::NA seemed to reflect that too, yeah. I got stopped by a cleaning lady at the elevators who asked me if I could "keep up with all those guys." (I took it in the technological sense, though in hindsight maybe she meant it elsewise, in which case I would have been even *more* blindsided by the question.)<br><br>But if it's any consolation, I was never conscious of any of "all of those guys" treating me any ways different from anybody else.  So there's that.<br>
