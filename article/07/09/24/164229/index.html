<p>We are happy to announce that we're going to have a
<a href="http://act.perl.org.il/ilpw2007/">Perl Workshop in Israel</a> still this year! In order to give you the most time to prepare for it, it is scheduled to be on 31st December, 2007.</p>
<p><p>
It is going to be a one day workshop with either one or two rooms. We are going to have talks (which you need to submit) and we plan to have job fair during the day. We'll also allocate time for BOFs and project showcases and we would be glad to receive ideas for other things to do.
</p>

<p>
The conference is managed using <a href="http://act.mongueurs.net/">Act</a>, the tool used by the YAPCs and the various Perl Workshops throughout Europe and the US. You can already register <a href="http://act.perl.org.il/ilpw2007/">on the web site</a>. (Registration is free and it is not a commitment in itself, so even if you still need company approval you can already do that.)
</p>

<p>
Cost is not finalised yet, and it will also depend on the sponsors we can attract. Speakers can get in free of charge.
</p>

<p>
The first deadline for talk submission is 7th October. If we have enough good talks by that time, we'll announce the schedule without waiting for others to submit their talks. The real deadline is 19th October, but we really hope there will be enough presentations by the 7th.</p></p>
