<p><a href="http://use.perl.org/user/Alias">Alias</a> writes <i>"Someone that I've been talking to about <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?YAML::Tiny">YAML::Tiny</a> in email asked my opinion on CPAN's JSON modules, and whether or not I had any plans to write a JSON::Tiny as well.<br> <br>I replied at the time that I had no idea, since I had never really taken a good look at JSON-related modules before, and I only created ::Tiny modules where ALL the existing options were either bloated or XS-based, and there was a genuine need for a ::Tiny module.</i></p>
<p><i>And so far I think I've managed to hold the suffix to that standard reasonably well.<br> <br>Having a look around the various JSON modules however, it does indeed seem like all the JSON modules are indeed bloated or XS.<br> <br>Personally, I don't need JSON::Tiny (we'll probably go with JSON::XS for this project by the looks, since XS is fine and it's close to a user interface and so the raw speed is important).<br> <br>But by the looks of things there may well be a suitable case to be made for a JSON::Tiny, assuming someone can come up with a suitable API (personally I'd clone the Config::Tiny one) and a suitably small implementation...<br> <br>(Disclaimer: This is NOT going to be the Vertical Metre of Beer challenge) :)"</i></p>

<h2>Question</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/sigzero/">sigzero</a> on 2007-09-11T11:58:07</h3>
Would you be the "Master" of the<nobr> <wbr></nobr>::Tiny namespace? If I wanted to do a JSON::Tiny would I send it through you for "approval" or something?

<p>Well, no, Adam isn't the master of<nobr> <wbr></nobr>::Tiny. He's just...
</p>
<p><nobr> <wbr></nobr>... the one who coined the term.<br><nobr> <wbr></nobr>... the one who's going to come after you if you rebrand &amp; upload SOAP::Lite as SOAP::Tiny.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br><nobr> <wbr></nobr>... one of the PAUSE admins who process modules list registrations and give advice on choice of namespace.

"Guardian" perhaps?<br><br>Or maybe "Brand Manager"<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br><br>As a suffix that I intended to be optimised for human factors (ease of installation, simple to use, and so on) I consider it an integral part of this that someone can see some<nobr> <wbr></nobr>::Tiny module and trust that it does what it says, and that it's not just another<nobr> <wbr></nobr>::Lite.<br><br>That's in addition to the CPAN admin's natural dislike for naming bloat. If the<nobr> <wbr></nobr>::Tiny suffix means something SPECIFIC, then it creates certainty and clarity around the meaning of it.<br><br>
