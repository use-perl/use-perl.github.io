I've finally got pod2pdf (used to create the PDF files on <a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/">perldoc.perl.org</a>) updated for compatibility with the latest version of <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/PDF-API2">PDF::API2</a>, and packaged up into a proper CPAN release.
<br> <br>
It is available from <a href="http://perl.jonallen.info/projects/pod2pdf">http://perl.jonallen.info/projects/pod2pdf</a> or <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/pod2pdf">http://search.cpan.org/dist/pod2pdf</a>."</i></p>

Does it allow some encoding? I encoded my pod in utf-8 and non-ascii characters are garbled after the conversion. It's a pity, I also have problems with pod2html encoding.

Could you send me one of your utf-8 encoded Pod files (to jj@jonallen.info) please and I'll have a look into it.

You might want to look at all<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.txt files in:
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/src/ARANDAL/Pod-Simple-3.05/t/corpus/" title="cpan.org">here</a cpan.org>
as a stress-test for it your stuff (because they're certainly a stress-test for Pod::Simple.)

<p>BTW, I'm not on intimate terms with PDF internals, but I think you wouldn't be having
these problems (at least not quite so, uh, problematically) if you were using Pod::Simple.  From day one, I wrote Pod::Simple to understand arbitrary encodings because, you know, it's not 1994 anymore.

</p><p>You can look at Pod::Simple::HTML (or just about of the Pod::Simple::* renderers, including RTF, which is another of the Lovecraftian Old Ones
from about day two of me writing Pod::Simple)
for examples of how to do the deed of writing another renderer based on Pod::Simple.
And I'm crossing my fingers the PDF module
you're dealing with merrily understands
Unicode characters.

</p><p>If not, 1) ouch, and 2) do the best you can,
"progress not perfection", and "good is the
enemy of done".  Etc etc.

</p><p>And thank you, a huge thank you,
for doing what I had been meaning to do for ages but never ever found enough
time to even begin to look into presumably
considerable backstory for it all.
(I <em>did</em> once do a half-rewrite
of HTML::FormatPS, and that was
SCARY!  It was the
first and only time I've dealt with an output format
where you need to actually go down a page laying out text, and turn to the
the next page, etc; instead of just pouring blobs of text into the output format and letting
some application deal with it.)</p>
