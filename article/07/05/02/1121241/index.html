<p><p>
The Perl 6 design team met by phone on 25 April 2007.  Larry, Allison, Jesse, Nicholas, and chromatic attended.  These are the minutes.
</p></p>
<p><p> <strong>Larry:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>catching up with Damian's barrage of commentary on the Synopses</li>
<li>finished that last night</li>
<li>checking my grammar for things I've used but not defined</li>
<li>found a few things</li>
<li>otherwise holding forth as usual</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Allison:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>it's not too late for a Parrot 1.0!</li>
<li>spending time this week on mailing list messages</li>
<li>getting some private messages about the significance of Parrot</li>
<li>not sure why this last release kicked off something like that</li>
<li>also preparing a talk for LinuxFest NW this weekend</li>
<li>just putting together the PMC PDD</li>
<li>seems to be going well</li>
<li>not all that much radical change needed</li>
<li>just collecting changes from various documents into something manageable</li>
<li>will try to check in a draft this week, but maybe next week</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>c:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>I've been cleaning up Parrot's memory management and GC</li>
<li>fixed a couple of memory leaks</li>
<li>really improved memory performance, but have a few more tweaks to go</li>
<li>I'm shepherding the next release</li>
<li>trying to get object system more complete</li>
<li>if we only get code cleanups in, that makes a big difference though</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Jesse:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>check with Steve Peters about his microgrant</li>
<li>he'll have more patches in the next day or two</li>
<li>I just want to make sure he doesn't get burned out before he meets his goals for specific platforms</li>
<li>Phil Crow is doing design work with Tim Bunce</li>
<li>he's making progress</li>
<li>have talked to Jerry Gay about reimplementing its configuration system</li>
<li>just want to make sure we don't dump another project into Parrot's lap unnecessarily</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Nicholas:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>Spider Boardman, I think, pointed out that autoconf is a right *expletive* if it guesses wrong</li>
<li>metaconfig is more verbose and lets you override pieces of it</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>c:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>what's the approximate work of porting metaconfig to Parrot</li>
<li>at least the language part of it?</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Larry:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>I don't think of it as a separate language</li>
<li>it's been a while since I looked at it though</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Nicholas:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>it generates a configuration script written in the Bourne shell</li>
<li>the internal dependency resolver generates that</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Larry:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>it uses make and Perl</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Nicholas:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>in theory, the thing that needs porting to Parrot is the units that make up the script</li>
<li>only the output script, the equivalent to Configure, needs to run everywhere</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Larry:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>it's an awful lot of years of knowledge baked into those configuration units</li>
<li>not all of it well-commented as to its intent</li>
<li>it's been so long since I've had anything to do with it</li>
<li>it has a lot of support for hardware that someone somewhere has in his garage and hasn't booted in five years</li>
<li>the basic idea of Configure is sound though</li>
<li>probe for features, not platforms</li>
<li>if you hard-wire platform information, you've probably failed</li>
<li>if possible, you want to test something by compiling and running it</li>
<li>you can't guess that it's there if the header exists</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Allison:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>I haven't put removing Perl as a high priority</li>
<li>that's why we haven't worked on it yet</li>
<li>the reason it might be on the 1.0 path is that our current configuration and build system doesn't really work properly</li>
<li>the amount of work for getting it to do so versus getting our ultimate solution working is equivalent</li>
<li>it makes more sense to think about what we ultimately want to use</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>c:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>it's not just configuration too</li>
<li>the PMC and NCI processing and generation systems are important too</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Allison:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>I'm okay with the idea of using autoconf or metaconf that pulls the information into a layer that Parrot can use</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Jesse:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>what's next for the grammar, Larry?</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Larry:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>Pugs can parse it with some cheating</li>
<li>I remove and transform certain problematic constructs</li>
<li>then Pugs can parse it</li>
<li>Pugs doesn't run it after that though</li>
<li>getting it to run, even with cheating, would fast-forward a bootstrap</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Jesse:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>who could do that work?</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Larry:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>cmarcelo talked about hacking a regex engine into Haskell, but that didn't happen</li>
<li>a lot of the problems come from the chewing gum and bailing wire within the Haskell code and trying to hand off the problem to another engine</li>
<li>doesn't lend itself to working well</li>
<li>don't know if I should try to prototype a regex engine in Perl 6 for people to hand-translate to other things</li>
<li>in a sense we already have one of those</li>
<li>well, two: Perl 5's PCR and Parrot's PGE</li>
<li>it's one thing to parse the thing</li>
<li>it's another to return the data structures back that would be a full parse tree</li>
<li>having sufficient indirection in your rule set</li>
<li>call some things as methods</li>
<li>call rules by different names</li>
<li>things like that</li>
<li>I knew it was several steps beyond where everyone was when I put it out there</li>
<li>I saw everyone aiming at S05 but ending up in much different places</li>
<li>mostly it's just a common target to help people converge</li>
<li>hopefully our methods and rules will end up named the same</li>
<li>maybe our AST would have the same node names everywhere</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Damian:</strong> </p>

<p>As Larry mentioned, I've been busy deluging him with Synoptic feedback.</p>

<p>I've also released two more updates of Perl6::Perldoc, with some major improvements in robustness, correctness, and functionality.</p>

<p>Otherwise, I've been working on organizing my speaking tours for July and
September. I will be available as Larry's henchspeaker for the Perl 6 update
talks at YAPC::Houston, OSCON, and YAPC::Vienna.</p></p>
