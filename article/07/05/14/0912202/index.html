<h1>Perl 6 Design Minutes for 02 May 2007</h1>

<p>The Perl 6 design team met by phone on 02 May 2007.  Larry, Nicholas, Jesse, and chromatic attended.  These are the minutes.</p>
<p><p> <strong>Allison:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>I spoke this weekend at LinuxFest Northwest (so did chromatic). I was pleased at the response, including some C hackers who were interested in contributing, and a Perl hacker who implemented a way to parallelize our test suite during chromatic's talk. We'll definitely have to speak at more Linux conferences.</li>
<li>A good part of my Parrot time last week was taken up preparing my talk, but I've gotten pretty close to a first draft on the PMC PDD. I plan to check it in later this week.</li>
<li>Also, this week's "file of the week" is the C file for the core of the object implementation. We're working on refactoring that to integrate the new objects implementatiog</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Larry:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>going to the History of Programming Languages at the start of June</li>
<li>I'll give a short talk in the scripting language paradigm, past, present, and future</li>
<li>cogitating on various design issues</li>
<li>revised how autodefinitions of proxies work</li>
<li>generalizes nicely to taking prototype objects</li>
<li>attach a lazy closure to it to run on demand</li>
<li>it returns a list of build arguments</li>
<li>it can lazily construct a class when you call the first method on it</li>
<li>use it with a role name to generate a role proto-object</li>
<li>with initializers</li>
<li>without committing to build an object to construct the role</li>
<li>feed it to your C with your regular named arguments</li>
<li>looks like a clean way to pass in type information without using funky name mangling</li>
<li>working with someone to spec out pipeline IO</li>
<li>working on various other IO specifications myself</li>
<li>just getting my ducks in a row for summer travel</li>
<li>working with fglock a lot on getting his v6 parser to parse STD.pm</li>
<li>also to output P6 code closures, rather than Perl 5</li>
<li>because Pugs already has good support for closures and can link to itself more easily than Perl 5 to Perl 6, that we can build the grammar tree and do subsequent parsing more easily than we can feed it across the gateway</li>
<li>maybe that's the short way to a bootstrap</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Jesse:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>how much work will it take before you can see if it's productive?</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Larry:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>Flavio thinks that it'll be another couple of weeks before he has the v6 parser in sufficiently good shape</li>
<li>that should give us good feedback even when running under the Perl 5 engine</li>
<li>that still leaves the problem of bridging</li>
<li>once you have that spitting out Perl 5 code, making it spit out Perl 6 code instead is probably not too much of a stretch</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Jesse:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>are there parallelizable jobs?</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Larry:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>down the path, the Haskell engine needs to provide more support</li>
<li>I don't know what that would be yet</li>
<li>once you get one backend giving out, other backends become more possible</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>c:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>my report is the same as Allison's</li>
<li>working with Brad Fitzpatrick on parallelization</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Nicholas:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>I want parallel tests too</li>
<li>I tried to work that with Test::Harness, but it's ugly</li>
<li>though I'd wait until TAP::Parser entered the core</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Jesse:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>I want to raise the DLR thing</li>
<li>just want to raise the question of why don't people consider Perl a target?</li>
<li>does the new DLR stuff give a possible Perl 6 implementor more rope?</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Larry:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>the .Net folks several years ago didn't want to support continuations</li>
<li>they were okay with emulating it</li>
<li>obviously if Ruby's running on .Net, they support continuations somehow</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>c:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>Ruby 1.8 or Ruby 2?</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Larry:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>continuations aren't required for the core features of Perl 6</li>
<li>we've danced around the edges with things like resumable exceptions</li>
<li>by requiring stack unwinding operations, resuming an exception can be returning from the exception handler</li>
<li>if we want to write our own regex engine in Perl 6, it'd be awfully nice if we had continuations</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>c:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>unless it adds nice tools for building languages, I don't see much compelling use for it at the moment</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Larry:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>if we get our stack working well, it might be a compelling target</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Nicholas:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>my message on London PM was that corporate funding paid for the finishing of IronPython and Ruby on the JVM</li>
<li>don't know how much work ActiveState put into their Perl port</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>c:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>it's an attempt to appear relevant in the face of hype</li>
<li>if there were Fortran on Rails, Sun and Microsoft would be falling all over themselves to get Fortran on the JVM and the CLR</li>
</ul></p>
