<div class="span8">
<p>The current Perl QA wiki has been attracting a lot of spam recently - and we seem to have lost contact with Tyler MacDonald who as far as I know is the only person with admin access to it.

<p>So I've moved all the content to <a href="http://perl-qa.hexten.net/">perl-qa.hexten.net</a> and set it up so that only registered users may edit. It's a shame to have to restrict access in that way; certainly we'll get fewer drive-by contributions as a result. On balance it's better than the message that a spam-riddled quality (quality!) wiki sends I think.</p>

<p>Please update bookmarks / links accordingly.</p></p>

If you'd implement a CAPTCHA to edit the wiki, the users didn't have to register and spam should be prohibited.<br><br>You're probably no PHP guy, but I guess that some CAPTCHA plugins for MediaWiki exist.

I've seen forum spamming software which can register a new account, successfully answer the captcha, respond to a verification email, and<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/then/ post the spam - all fully automatic.<br>If there's not yet similar software available for wikis, I'm sure it's not long coming.<br><br>I even heard about a website recently (can't remember the name) which pays people to answer captchas.

It somewant explicitly wants to spam a certain site, it will be hard to fight that.<br/><br/>The attacker just has to register itself on the site and can now spam it.<br/><br/>But I assume that the QA wiki was a victim of random spam bots rather than trageted attacks.
And most of those bots will be kept away by a CAPTCHA.<br/><br/>If the wiki was targeted by a specific attacker, the need for registration won't bring any cure to the problems.

I think the way the software worked, was that it used a search engine to find sites using forum software that it knew about - I imagine it would search for particular markup that's common to that software.<br>All it needs is a MediaWiki plugin, and any site using that software that google knows about is a potential target.

So an obligatory registering step wouldn't hinder _this_ bot either.<br><br>If we conclude, that you cannot fight that intelligent bot, we don't have to think about that one any more.<br><br>To fight stupid bots, a CAPTCHA should be enough and even harder for a bot than registering on the site.<br>Additionally a CAPTCHA will be less work for the "drive-in" contributer, as no registration/check mail/log-in/repost is needed.

<p><div class="quote">I've seen forum spamming software which can register a new account, successfully answer the captcha, respond to a verification email, and<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/then/ post the spam - all fully automatic.</div> Yes, I've seen it too, there was a demonstration video posted on Reddit.com some time ago. The full video (no description) can be found <a href="http://www.botmaster.net/movies/XFull.htm" title="botmaster.net">here</a botmaster.net>.<br><br>I think CAPTCHA is less effective than registering because if you catch a user spamming, you disable his account. If somebody bypasses a captcha, you're powerless. All you can do is clean up the broken pieces.<br>
