</li>
</ul>

<br> <br>Specifically, the bug is that if you have a pattern which in itself uses no
Unicode characters, but matches Unicode characters (for example
<code>\x{}</code> escapes) then at compile time the regexp engine will
allocate memory assuming an 8 bit representation on the first pass. However,
if the pattern also has 8 bit characters, then when the Unicode characters are
compiled (on the second pass) any existing 8 bit characters will be converted
to UTF-8 representation, which is likely to be a buffer overflow. Matches will
also fail.

<br> <br>Given that it's been present since 5.8.0 (July 2002) and the bug itself (but
not the security implication) wasn't reported until early this year*, it is
unlikely to crop up in the wild.

<br> <br>Redhat's announcement is <a href="https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2007-0966.html">https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2007-0966.html</a>
which I find unclear in its wording: <br> <br> <p><blockquote> <div>Specially crafted input to a regular expression can cause Perl to
improperly allocate memory, possibly resulting in arbitrary code running
with the permissions of the user running Perl.</div>
</blockquote>

<br> <br>The "input" is the pattern, not the matched string. So it's not going to be
an issue at all, unless your programmers are foolish enough to allow
untrusted user input to be interpolated into regular expressions. If so, you
were already open to denial of service attacks from patterns that
bust the C stack (fixed in 5.10) or take until the heat death of the
universe to complete (inherently unfixable in a general purpose programming
language).

<br> <br>The CVE announcement is <a href="http://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2007-5116">http://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2007-5116</a>
It's terse, and has the same ambiguity: <br> <br> <p><blockquote> <div>Buffer overflow in the polymorphic opcode support in the Regular
Expression Engine (regcomp.c) in Perl 5.8 allows context-dependent
attackers to execute arbitrary code by switching from byte to Unicode
(UTF) characters in a regular expression.</div>
</blockquote>

<br> <br>Yes, conceivably you can now inject arbitrary code. But if you did, you
program (not perl) was badly written, and already had the ability to be
crashed or hung.

<br> <br>The timing of this announcement is not ideal. Security researches at Google
discovered the buffer overflow in the regexp engine compiler. As best I can
tell, they reported it to Linux vendors, who forwarded it to one Perl 5
committer, who forwarded it on to the rest. There was some discussion about
the patch that needed backporting from 5.10 (where it was already fixed) to
5.8, and then <b>that was the last we heard.</b>

<br> <br>The next "contact" we had was discovering that the Linux vendors had made
public security announcements, without even notifying us, let alone
discussing a timescale. I consider this outcome neither professional nor
courteous, but hope that it was caused by an unfortunate series of events
that won't re-occur.

<br> <br>To help avoid such a repeat, we've set up a contact address,
perl5-security-report@perl.org solely for reporting any similar core security
bugs.

<br> <br>Currently it points to a unarchived mailing list with the same name
(<code>perl5-security-report@perl.org</code>), using the regular perl.org list
manager and sign-up address conventions. We'd welcome anyone competent
to request to subscribe. It's likely not to be high traffic &mdash; right
now we seem to average 1 security issue every 2 years, but we'd really
like more people on it so that there's a good chance that at least one
of the subscribers will have the time to respond to any initial report
within 24 hours, at least to say roughly: <br> <br> <p><blockquote> <div>"thanks for the report. I can confirm that this is a bug. We're looking
into how to resolve it, and we'll get back to you"</div>
</blockquote>


<br> <br> <small>* The bug was first found against 5.10-to-be, not 5.8.x, by Jeurd,
while at the <a href="http://www.perl-workshop.de/">German Perl Workshop</a>,
when trying to write a program to convert BNF grammars to 5.10 regexps. You
have to push the engine pretty far to get to it.</small>"</p>

<h2>Patch applied but still mem errors after reg ex</h2>

Hi mate,<br/><br/>thanks for the post, we've been getting memory errors consistantly from our perl based blogging software (MT). Even with ulimit "unlimited" and your patch it still seems to die with ""Out of memory during "large" request for 1052672 bytes, total sbrk() is 41959424 bytes at lib/MT/Builder.pm line 375."" just after performing this segment of code:<br/><br/>(builder.pm)
<code>
foreach (@args) {
                    $_ = [ $_-&gt;[0], $_-&gt;[1] ];
                    my $arg = $_;
                    if (ref $arg-&gt;[1] eq 'ARRAY') {
                        $arg-&gt;[1] = [ @{$arg-&gt;[1]} ];
                        foreach (@{$arg-&gt;[1]}) {

</code><br/><br/>Any ideas?



<h2>requires mod_perl re-compile?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/markjugg/">markjugg</a> on 2007-12-20T21:48:09</h3>
This may be a naive question, but if this patch is applied and Perl is re-compiled, would a mod_perl installed compiled against this Perl also need to be re-compiled?<br><br>My guess is "No".
