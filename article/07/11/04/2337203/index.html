<p><p>I recently had a few spare <em>tuits</em> and ran out of books to read, so the Moose object system popped to the top of my stack.</p>

<p>Like many new and cool projects, features are accellerating away from documentation, and often what a new starter wants is a low-down, which isn't there (yet). Catalyst and DBIx::Class were each like this at one point in time.</p>

<p>To help myself and others I have created a PDF <a href="http://users.ox.ac.uk/user/oliver/data/files/moose-quick-ref.pdf">Moose Quick-Ref Card</a> with most of the functions and syntactic sugar consructs of the system.</p>

<p>Thanks go to folks in the <code>#moose</code> IRC channel, and the <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Programming_with_Moose">Programming With Moose</a> WikiBook written by EvanCarroll. The ref card will work best if you can print it 2-up on one A4 sheet, cut that in half, then laminate the two A5 parts back-to-back.</p>

<p>Comments and suggestions for the ref-card will be gratefully received <code>:-)</code> </p></p>

<h2>Additions..</h2>

"use Moose;" also automatically "use"s strict and warnings.<br><br>The next release of Moose / MOP should have the new builder / lazy_build attribute options (ask in IRC about it if you want to know more)<br><br>meta-&gt;make_immutable / meta-&gt;make_mutable: allow you to "lock" a class down. By telling Class::MOP that you will not make any further changes to the class (you can still extend via inheritance), we gain the ability to memoize / inline some internals, improving performance.

<p>This is not to be under sold. I was randomly doing benchmarks against a class builder that shall remain namelessly &#8230; immutable made us perform within the realm of consideration considering what Moose provides.</p> <p>* Moose::Tiny will probably feature these benchmarks in the next version.</p>

<h2>Predicate behavior</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/groditi/">groditi</a> on 2007-11-07T19:42:34</h3>
IN your quickref card you describe as basic checks for defined ness. This was a bug and is now fixed, predicates act more like exists now in that $class-&gt;attr(undef); Will make the attribute's predicate return true. Please see groditi in IRC if you have any questions.<br><br>Corrected behavior:<br>Predicates return true if value was deliberately set to undef<br>Attributes return false only when the attribute was never set.<br>Readers of unset attributes will return undef without autovivify ing the value
