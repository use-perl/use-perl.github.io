<h2>Strawberry Perl</h2>

Devel::ptkdb. Which of course requires Tk. But I think its important to provide a visual debugger OOTB.

I second the request for Devel:ptkdb. It would also be helpful to have the Sybperl modules (Sybase::DBlib and Sybase::CTlib).

Sybase, being a commerical product, may not provide a free version of client libs bundle and link in. I think that the DBs could be provided in "Sprinkles" perl, or some other add-on.

Unfortunately, I think GUI toolkits are probably where I will draw the line.<br><br>That sort of stuff should go into Chocolate Perl.<br>

<h3><a href="/user/persicom/">persicom</a> on 2007-11-09T02:00:07</h3>
But given the way the Strawberry is built and installed, TK and Devel::ptkdb should be as simple as<br/><br/>for (qw (Tk Devel::ptkdb)) {
   get_from_cpan($_);
   unpack($_);
   perl_maketestinstall($_);
}<br/><br/>Yes?

If it's that easy, then there's no need to pre-install it.<br><br>The goal here is not to pre-install for pre-install sake.<br><br>The goal is to install things that CAN'T be easily installed via CPAN normally, and require non-CPAN installation or configuration.<br><br>By providing THOSE things pre-bundled, it makes installation of the CPAN modules much easier.

Sorry, I wasn't complete in my post. I was trying to B that it would be that easy to add after the fact. As long as the magic four-step-sequence works (which it should since you are bundling the toolchain, yes?) then I agree that Tk/Devel::ptkdb should live outside of Strawberry proper.<br/><br/>Perhaps GUI extentions be bundled into a release called Fudge.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

<p>And what would the packager for that release be called&#8230;?</p>



<h2>Re:Strawberry Perl</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Alias/">Alias</a> on 2007-11-10T11:37:45</h3>
The mythical Chocolate Perl will indeed come with WxWindows and Tk and a GUI CPAN client and a GUI POD reader, and all sorts of wonderful blue sky stuff.<br><br>Of course, it will probably be several hundred meg, but then that's the general idea.

<h2>XML::LibXML</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/srezic/">srezic</a> on 2007-11-08T14:27:24</h3>
Instead of XML::Parser, I would like XML::LibXML (+libxml2) much more. (IMHO the only sane method to access XML information is through XPath, which is possible with XML::LibXML, but not with stock XML::Parser)



<blockquote>

<h2>Re:XML::LibXML</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Alias/">Alias</a> on 2007-11-09T02:18:58</h3>
Looking at the dependency trees below both XML::Parser and XML::LibXML it would appear that I'll need to pre-install both of them.
