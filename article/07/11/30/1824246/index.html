<h1>Perl 6 Design Minutes for 14 November 2007</h1>

<div class="span8">
<p>The Perl 6 design team met by phone on 14 November 2007.  Larry, Patrick,
Nicholas, and Jesse attended.</p>
<p><p> <strong>Larry:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>Still trying to work out the longest token matching stuff.</li>
<li>Going a little slow because I've been fighting lack of sleep from tendinitis and medications, and having to upgrade infrastructure and e-mail.</li>
<li>New spam filter caused a DOS attack - Installed ClamAV and new SpamAssassin rules, then someone sent about 100 identical messages which completely bogged down SpamAssassin.</li>
<li>I had to write a blacklist thing that went through lastlog and blacklist those IPs</li>
<li>Got the Fedora upgrade and several other things done, waiting for my brain to come back.</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Jesse:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>Is your hardware holding up?</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Larry:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>USB being a little flaky, but doesn't matter as I don't use USB much. The space bar is gimpy</li>
<li>Doing stuff that is optimised for my right hand, ie doesn't need as much typing.</li>
<li>Also thinking about stuff people have sent me, such as Damian.</li>
<li>In terms of real Perl 6 work, primarily just thinking</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Jesse:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>Things are gelling better, or still in the stewing phase?</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Larry:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>I know I could do it if I had a whole brain, but I don't have enough of a brain to fit it in right now.</li>
<li>Got the source to egrep, and all sorts of things that do this sort of thing</li>
<li>Want a perl specific solution to it -- egrep just tells you line matches, doesn't tell you how it matches.</li>
<li>Want the algorithm specified in Perl 6, even if the eventual compiler does it some other way</li>
<li>Don't know how fast it will be, but the algorithm is designed to examine each character only once, so shouldn't be too slow.</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Jesse:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>Get it correct, then make it fast.</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Larry:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>Hard to explain to computer what I mean.</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Patrick:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>If only we had a good language for that</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Larry:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>Indeed</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Patrick:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>Ended up with infrastructure problems too.</li>
<li>For work, I had to reinstall the OS to get Adobe Captivate.</li>
<li>Turns out that the Parrot testing facility doesn't work with the latest Test mods from CPAN.</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Jesse:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>Test:Harness?</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Patrick:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>Possibly. It's been refactored somehow?</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Jesse:</strong> </p>

<ul>
     <li>- More re-implemented from scratch.</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Patrick:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>First hint was that the smoke tests didn't run.</li>
<li>Got help on IRC; we tracked it down to a missing dependency.</li>
<li>Fixed that.</li>
<li>Now make test isn't running</li>
<li>Just filed a ticket; I expect someone from #parrot will pick it up and have it solved within an hour</li>
<li>Right now I think that it's because harness is passing an option to parrot that parrot doesn't understand.</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Nicholas:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>One of the authors of <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Test::Harness">Test::Harness</a> 3 is Andy Armstrong, AndyA; you may be able to find him on IRC.</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Jesse:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>Talked about a bunch of stuff last week</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Patrick:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>I still need to format my part.</li>
<li>Hoped to have new NPQ checked in before I blogged it, but not going to hold the blog post up for it.</li>
<li>One way or another it will go out tonight: list message, use.perl journal entry, anywhere else you can think.</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Jesse:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>For a use.perl journal entry, there's a tickbox, which submits the entry to the moderation queue for the front page.</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Jesse:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>Last week talked to Patrick and several of the other authors about the state of various implementations [of Perl 6], to (not quite) get a blog post together.</li>
<li>Haven't done the step of blog post, but everything else is done and is in public.</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Patrick:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>You have a URL?</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Jesse:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>In the IRC logs of #perl6, so not "published" but is Google-able.</li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Patrick:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>because I want to refer to it in a post to perl6-compiler.</li>
</ul>

<p>Nicholas asked about state and <code>START</code> blocks, which Larry
answered with a concise explanation about context, which we agreed would be
better written out in e-mail to perl6-language), given that vocally it's a
tongue twister of symbols.</p></p>
