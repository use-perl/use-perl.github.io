<p>S&#233;bastien Aperghis-Tramoni filed a bug for <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Module::Install">Module::Install</a>/<a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?YAML::Tiny">YAML::Tiny</a> complaining that Module::Install is preventing <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?YAML::Tiny">YAML::Tiny</a> from being fully 5.004-compatible.<br> <br>And to be honest, he's complete right in his fear and loathing.<br> <br>Using Module::Install (or even <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Module::Build">Module::Build</a>) is a complete philosophical clash with the entire concept of ::Tiny. OBVIOUSLY we should be using the oldest, most stable, most compatible build system of all, for modules which have practically no features and absolutely no complexities by design.<br> <br>So as soon as I get a chance, I'm reverting the installers for all of the ::Tiny modules to plain vanilla <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?ExtUtils::MakeMaker">ExtUtils::MakeMaker</a>.<br> <br>And my apologies to the beleaguered S&#233;bastien.</p>

<p>I don't use Windows, but don't Windows users have to download and install a specific make utility in order to use MakeMaker to install modules?</p>

1. Nobody is using 5.005 on Windows.<br><br>2. Everybody that matters is now using Strawberry Perl, and doesn't have to download anything.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br><br>3. Anyone that isn't, should probably be using PPM files, and the ActiveState build farm is the only thing that needs make.<br><br>

Can Strawberry install TT on Windows?

Is this a trick question?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br><br>I just installed SP and TT (for Catalyst) twice this week on win32 without any problems. (one a real win32 machine, and one in XP in parallels

No. I have not used SP and had read (might have been a while ago) that TT was an issue. Or at least I thought it was TT or maybe it was DBD::Oracle come to think about it.

TT did have some issues on Win32 not long ago but they have been fixed.

<h3><a href="/user/Alias/">Alias</a> on 2007-11-01T23:38:03</h3>
The problem was on all Win32, not just Strawberry.<br><br>The TT issues are quite fixed now, and Andy has started releasing test releases to the mailing list first, for Win32 people to check, before he does the uploads.<br>

<p>That makes sense, although your first and second rules sound awfully close to mine.</p>

<h2>YAML::Tiny did not drop in</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/sir_lichtkind/">sir_lichtkind</a> on 2007-11-03T12:01:26</h3>
maybe its me but today i tried it as an drop in replacement and it failed so far for 2 reasons.<br/><br/>1.LoadFile did not return a ref but thou count of the arraylength.<br/><br/>2.empty list nodes as i use for seperator in menu definition are undef instead just empty ('') like in the original YAML.<br/><br/>but the idea is great<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

If you have examples of documents that are incompatible, please report them and I'll look into it.

this is a menu definition. you see the arrayitems with no content. the varialble that holds that nothing i want to be empty not undef. i don't know if its accidental and breaking his own specs, but that the way i used to get the input from YAML Parser. BTW: hope you read my last mail. your changes are now all in but switch to new config path handling needs some tweaks before i uncomment them all.<br><br>main_toolbar:<br>
