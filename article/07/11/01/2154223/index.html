<p>If you have an idea for doing some work for the Perl
      community and you think it&#8217;s worthy of a grant, please
      send your grant entry to
      <a href="mailto:tpf-proposals@perl-foundation.org">tpf-proposals@perl-foundation.org</a>.
      Submission deadline is the last day of November,
                            voting starts in December     and we will be awarding
              the grants by the beginning of January.


   <p>First, please read about <a href="http://www.perlfoundation.org/how_to_write_a_proposal">how
      to submit a grant</a>. Read that carefully as grants are often rejected if they don&#8217;t meet
      the criteria. For example, if you want to submit improvements to a well-known project but
      there&#8217;s no evidence that you have at least tried to work with the maintainers of that project,
      the grant will likely not be approved. You can also read through our
      <a href="http://www.perlfoundation.org/rules_of_operation">rules of operation</a>
      for a better idea of the grant process.
   </p>

   <p>To get an idea of what sorts of grants are generally
      accepted, you can read through past grants for
      <a href="http://www.perlfoundation.org/grants">2001 to 2006</a>.
      You can also read through the
      <a href="http://news.perlfoundation.org/grants/">grant-related postings to the Perl Foundation blog</a>.
      As a general rule, a properly formatted grant proposal is more
      likely to be approved if it meets the following criteria:</p>

   <ul> <li>It has widespread benefit to the Perl community or a large segment of it.</li>
       <li>We have reason to believe that you can accomplish your goals.</li>
       <li>We can afford it (we rarely approve anything more than a couple of thousand dollars).</li> </ul>

   <p>The thorniest issue, as always, is the grant amount.
      If you do not include a grant amount, the grant will not be approved.
      So how much do you ask for? While we have information in
      <a href="http://news.perlfoundation.org/2005/12/the_grant_committee_what_we_do.html">this
      posting about the grant committee</a>, the reality is fairly simple.
      We&#8217;re a non-profit organization and we are not flush with cash.
      If you charge us a typical hourly rate, we probably cannot afford it.
      Typical grant awards are generally in the $500 to $3000 range, but we have
      gone under and over those amounts, depending on the grant. As a general rule
      the less expensive it is, the more likely it is that we can afford to fund it.
      For highly speculative grants (in other words, projects whose benefits may be
      unclear or have a high chance of failure), we are unlikely to risk large amounts
      of our donor&#8217;s money.</p></p>

that I hurry the hell up and finish my grant work already.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-(



<h2>travel grants?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/rjbs/">rjbs</a> on 2007-11-02T22:49:16</h3>
I know travel grants exist, but there seems to be very little information about them.  Could you point me at, or create, some information?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

Hola, Ricardo.

I might add this information on TPF webpage. But for now, I was told that TPF rarely approve travel grants.  In the rules of operation, you'll note the following:
<ul>
<li>Non-travel grants may not be awarded to any member of the grants committee;</li>
<li>Travel grants may only be awarded to members of the grants committee for actual expenses, and only with the full approval of TPF's board of directors.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cheers!</p>

Thanks.  I imagine that one reason travel grants are rarely approved may be that they're rarely applied for, because there is no information on what the heck they're all about.  I look forward to seeing what becomes of that.
