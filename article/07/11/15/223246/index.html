<div class="span8">
<p>I have a lot of programming niche interests -- video, <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Net-VNC/">VNC</a>, <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Perl-Critic/">static analysis</a>, PDF, filesystems, <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/FLV-Info">Flash</a>, <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/CAM-SOAPClient">SOAP</a>, etc.  Most of all, I love it when these interests intersect.  For example, I wrote still-closed-source (sigh) library that converts a VNC stream to QuickTime.  A prototype of that software was the basis for the <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Test-Virtual-Filesystem/">YAPC::NA 2006 videos</a> I produced.<br> <br>Another convergence happened last week.  Google released <a href="http://code.google.com/p/macfuse/">MacFUSE 1.x</a>, a Mac port of the Linux user-mode filesystem code.  I had tried an earlier version, but I never got the Perl bindings (<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Fuse/">Fuse.pm</a>) to work right.  What can this do?  It lets you write your own mountable virtual filesystem in a couple hundred lines of code.<br> <br>Back in 2002-2005, I did a ton of PDF work.  A result of that was a base library, <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/CAM-PDF/">CAM::PDF</a>.  I got authority to release it to CPAN about the same time the business motivation for the library dried up.  But in the process, I learned the PDF specification inside and out.  PDF is basically a serialization of an arbitrary tree structure: strings, numbers, hashes, arrays, references and blobs, all in an almost-human-readable syntax.<br> <br>You can store <b>anything</b> in PDF.  Most of that tree is focused on storing pages, text and graphics, but the fascinating part is <i>that's just convention</i>.  The underlying data structure is generic.<br> <br>So why not put filesystem data and metadata inside a PDF?  I mentioned the idea at the last <a href="http://madmongers.org/">Madison Perl Mongers</a> meeting and they laughed at me! (LAUGHED! at ME!)  Well, that was enough motivation!  A weekend later, I released <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Fuse-PDF">Fuse:PDF</a> v0.01 to CPAN.  It's still very worthy of the v0.01 label (no symlinks, no hardlinks, no large files) but it's usable.<br> <br>What do you think?  Inspired or daft?  Should I have put it in the Acme:: namespace? :-)<br> <br>[Along the way, I'm also writing <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Test-Virtual-Filesystem/">Test::Virtual::Filesystem</a> which is a collection of typical file I/O actions that should work on any mounted filesystem.]</p>

So you mount a PDF doc as a filesystem. I was wondering: what happens when you try to open such a PDF in Acrobat and try to print it out?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br><br>Oh, and yes, I would have put that under ACME... well, at least that first implementation. But if you come up with a clever mapping, so that when mounting a real PDF the text inside is available as<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.txt files and the graphic is available as<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.png or<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.jpg, this would really be a nifty way of editing PDFs...

<i>So you mount a PDF doc as a filesystem. I was wondering: what happens when you try to open such a PDF in Acrobat and try to print it out?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</i><br><br>Nothing unusual.  The filesystem does not affect the rendering of the PDF in any way.  It's as if the filesystem were in the comments of an HTML file -- it just makes the PDF bigger from the point of view of rendering.<br><br><i><br>Oh, and yes, I would have put that under ACME... well, at least that first implementation.

But it would only work well for read-only.  The PDF layout format is way too specialized to be able to round-trip as a text file.  Unless you meant present the PDF rendering commands in a text file?<br>

Create a PDF template with some dummy text and then simply mount it and replace the dummy text with something more appropriate. If this allows to replace a whole textbox full of text, perfect! Even if you could only replace lines of text it could be useful. Exchanging a picture with one of the same dimensions should work regardless, no?<br><br>OK, mounting the PDF is probably mostly useful for steganography. But part of that could be a simple interface to traverse the PDF. Or does this already exist?

Since you came up with this idea, I've been thinking about it a lot.  PDF has a VERY write-only syntax (Perl's ill-gotten reputation has nothing on PDF), but I think there are a few opportunities here.  Keep an eye on this journal over the next couple of weeks.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)<br>

Hmm, would it be possible to add a PDF to the end of a mounted PDF? I mean, if you store a PDF into a mounted PDF that it would be incorporated in a way that it would also be printed out if I print the mounted PDF?<br><br>I'll keep an eye on you...<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;o)

Hmm, like putting the extra PDF in a magic folder and make it auto-append to the existing PDF?  That has a pretty awkward feel to me.  Instead, you're probably better off using the <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?appendpdf.pl" title="cpan.org">appendpdf.pl</a cpan.org> helper in the CAM::PDF distibution.

I'm aware that all those things can be better accomplished using PDF manipulation libs. I'm just brainstorming about somewhat useful (or lunatic) uses of a writeable mounted PDF from a PDF view and not from a filesystem view...<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;o)<br><br>Have a webserver serve a PDF and have that PDF mounted.
