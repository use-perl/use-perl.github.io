<p>The day started out with Larry Wall's keynote, which was entertaining
as ever.  His talk was not as focused as it was
last year
(but that just be my bias of the aural over the visual).

<p>Larry (who is featured in this month's
<a href="http://www.forbes.com/">Forbes</a> magazine), discussed Perl's
complexity being a feature ("English is useful <em>because</em> it's
a mess", "Simplicity is often the enemy of success"), and went on
to apply Tao-like philosophy to a description of Perl's usefulness.

</p><p>TPI News cannot be everywhere at once, so we cannot report on
everything that happened.  Nathan Torkington changed the topic of
his "Free Tools and Perl" talk to "Porn and CPAN", a change most
people seemed to think was a decided improvement.  After his
relatively short talk about identifying content stored in a proxy
cache, Eric Eisenhart and Dustin Mollo showed a demo of a new CPAN
interface they are working on at perl.com.

</p><p>Helping users get the most out of CPAN was a hot topic Tuesday and
Wednesday.  <a href="http://www.connect.net/gbarr/cpan-test/">CPAN
Testers</a> will be moving to <a href="http://www.perl.org/">TPI</a>,
and (hopefully), the perl.com CPAN interface and CPAN Testers and
WAIT will all be integrated on some level.  Some sort of quality
rating system of modules on CPAN has been the topic of much discussion.

</p><p>In a TPI BOF (Birds of a Feather meeting) Wednesday evening, Chip
Salzenberg, TPI's executive director, discussed what TPI is doing, and
what it will be doing, and how to get involved.  What TPI is doing is
getting volunteers to do work.  What it will be doing is (in addition
to this news page) a bug tracking database, increased
and better communication with the media and corporations, better
pointers to information for Perl users.  One can get involved by
becoming a member and contributing money which helps pay for
infrastructure, and by volunteering time.

</p><p>The MacPerl BOF saw a couple dozen people, most of them MacPerl users,
and many of them interested in such things as the in-progress 5.005
port of MacPerl (with features like threading, the compiler, improved
regex support, etc.), and DBI and Tk ports.  No one has volunteered to
do the DBI and Tk ports yet.  Tk is a lot of work, and not many client
libraries exist on Mac OS, which are needed for building client libraries.
It was pointed out that local DBDs are not necessary if using the DBI
proxy, which may ease a port of DBI for MacPerl.

</p><p>The FreeBSD people, noting that Red Hat passed out free RH5.1 CD
sets, gave out free copies of FreeBSD 2.2.6 4-CD set from Walnut Creek.
The conference organizers changed their minds about giving free copies
of The Perl Cookbook to speakers, and are giving books to speakers
on request.

</p><p>Jon Orwant, Tom Christiansen, Chip Salzenberg, Graham Barr, and Mike
Stok had a "debate" about OOP in Perl, but very little blood was shed.
Most people seemed to agree that OOP can be useful in Perl, but that
it has some problems, and that it is waaaaaaaay overused by CPAN authors.

</p><p>Jon Orwant also hosted a Quiz Show (modeled after College Bowl),
pitting four teams of three against each other, two at a time.
Of course, the team with two members of perl5-porters won the prize
of Perl Resource Kits, Perl Journals, and other goodies.  The event
was entirely entertaining, and, if we may step outside of the shroud of
objectivity for a moment, we'd like to see it as a fixture for TPCs in
the future.</p></p>
