<p>Well, the brand new books mentioned above are on sale here,
and being given away: Early Bird registrants (except for
Early Bird Registrants who also happen to be speakers, go
figure) are given free copies of what looks to be a very useful
tome for all Perl programmers (including the authors, we'd
wager).  The Pocket Reference is being given away to everyone
who fills out a survey.

<p>The <a href="http://www.pm.org/">Perl Mongers</a> are here in
force, getting signatures for locations around the globe.
Seems we'll be reporting several new Perl Mongers groups in the
next few weeks.

</p><p>The registration packet included some standard fare: a schedule,
a copy of the most recent <a href="http://www.tpj.com/">Perl
Journal</a>, some pens, a pad of paper, inserts from sponsors.
There's no hefty binder with conference notes this time; the notes
are on a CD instead, which may be immediately useful only to those
with laptops or 780nm lasers embedded in their skulls.  Kudos to
O'Reilly: the CDs have an HFS partition, complete with a custom
icon seen under Mac OS.

</p><p>Two other CDs are included: Velocigen, for high-speed CGI stuff,
and the super-cool Red Hat Linux 5.1 distribution.  There's a
computer room here with about 20 computers: two Macs, three NT
boxes, and the rest running Red Hat.  Also super-cool.  The
bandwidth does not seem to be very good, the Windows and Mac boxes
did not have Perl installed, there are no extra wires for laptop
hookups, but it is still a step forward from last year (one computer
for speakers/media, IIRC).

</p><p>No numbers yet, but the place looks very busy today, when
only tutorials are happening.  Tonight, Perl Mongers hosts
an evening with Randal Schwartz, and O'Reilly sponsors the first of
several movie nights.  Not sure what is on tap
for tonight, but good sci-fi is definitely in the mix.</p></p>
