<p>We didn't get to see much of OSDD, as we were relaxing most of the day.
We did, however, see most of the discussion about licensing and legal
issues.  Linus Torvalds and Marc Andreesen did <em>not</em> make
surprise appearances, though
<a href="http://www.varesearch.com/">VA Research</a>
and <a href="http://www.netscape.com/">Netscape</a>were represented.

Richard M. Stallman of the <a href="http://www.fsf.org/">Free Software
Foundation</a>, John Ousterhout of <a href="http://www.scriptics.com/">
Scriptics</a>, Larry Wall, Eric S. Raymond, and others in the open
source/free software business led the town meeting.

<p>There was quite
a bit of tension in the room between different ideas of licensing
between the GNU General Public License, the BSD license, and the
Mozilla Public License.  Tim O'Reilly likened the differences to the
differences between rebel factions in Monty Python's Life of Brian
(e.g., Judean People's Front, People's Front of Judea, etc.) who
hated each other, despite the fact that few people knew the
differences between them, if indeed any existed.  A similar
comparison has often been drawn with the BSD variants.

</p><p>Nevertheless, RMS asserted that non-"free" software is worse than
no software at all, and seemed to attack Ousterout quite a bit during
the day (who adopted a hybrid licensing scheme for Tcl).
Earlier in the week, and during OSDD, Wall advocated looking
for cooperation and middle ground.</p></p>
