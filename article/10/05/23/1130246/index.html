<p><a href="mailto:colomon@gmail.com">colomon</a> writes <i>"On behalf of the Rakudo development team, I'm pleased to announce theMay 2010 development release of Rakudo Perl #29 "Erlangen". Rakudo is an implementation of Perl 6 on the Parrot Virtual Machine (see <a href="http://www.parrot.org./">http://www.parrot.org./</a>  The tarball for the May 2010 release is available from <a href="http://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/downloads">http://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/downloads</a> .
<br> <br>
Rakudo Perl follows a monthly release cycle, with each release named after a Perl Mongers group.  The May 2010 release is code named "Erlangen" in recognition of Erlangen.pm and the Perl 6 talk that Moritz Lenz, one of our core developers, gave this month.
<br> <br>
Some of the specific changes and improvements occurring with this release include:
<br> <br>
* Lexical classes and roles were implemented. Additionally, anonymous classes  which were never quite right in alpha  are now implemented more correctly, and anonymous roles are also supported.
<br> <br>
* Basic support for named enumerations of the form 'enum Weekday ' has been restored.
<br> <br>
* First cut of use Foo:from and eval('foo', :lang); needs  Blizkost[1] to be installed to work.
<br> <br>
*  Numeric / Real roles much closer to the spec now.
<br> <br>
*  As always, many additional small features and bug fixes make working with Rakudo more pleasant.
<br> <br>
*  Rakudo now passes 32,347 spectests. We estimate that there are about 39,500 tests in the test suite, so Rakudo passes about 82% of all tests.
<br> <br>
For a more detailed list of changes see "docs/ChangeLog".
<br> <br>
The development team thanks all of our contributors and sponsors for making Rakudo Perl possible, as well as those people who worked on parrot, the Perl 6 test suite and the specification.
<br> <br>
The following people contributed to this release:
Solomon Foster, Moritz Lenz, Jonathan Worthington, Martin Berends, chromatic, Carl Masak, snarkyboojum, Stefan O'Rear, Reini Urban, Jonathan Scott Duff, takadonet, Christoph Otto, isBEKaml, ash_, bubaflub, Jimmy Zhuo, Peter Lobsinger and Patrick Abi Salloum
<br> <br>
If you would like to contribute, see <a href="http://rakudo.org/how-to-help">http://rakudo.org/how-to-help</a> , ask on the perl6-compiler@perl.org mailing list, or ask on IRC #perl6 on freenode.
<br> <br>
The next release of Rakudo (#30) is scheduled for June 17, 2010. A list of the other planned release dates and code names for 2010 is available in the "docs/release_guide.pod" file.  In general, Rakudo development releases are scheduled to occur two days after each Parrot monthly release.  Parrot releases the third Tuesday of each month.
<br> <br>
Have fun!
