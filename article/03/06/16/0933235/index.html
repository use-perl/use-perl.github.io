    Pour yourself some tea<br>
    Just like Bilbo made<br>
    Before he ever found rings<br>

    Once but never again<br>
    We've all left the den<br>
    Let me tell you 'bout it<br>
</i><p><i>
    The Fellowship left right on time<br>
    Ringbearing costs only your mind<br>

    Our name is Smeagol<br>

    Tell us what to do<br>
    Now that Orcs have come --<br>
    Now with Elephants!<br>
    And you know what else?<br>
    Guess what we received<br>
    Out of Mordor today<br>
    Words of deep concern<br>
    From my little pressioussesss<br>

Apparently the TORN people got already more than enough applicants, so if you already didn't leave your application in, you are late.<br>
