<p>As usual, the weekly summary will try to present a useful or entertaining
cross-section of the perl 5 porters' activity. The various topics include
C-level I/O, scoping, installation layouts, and some amount of bugs and
patches.</p>
<p><h3> <code>setvbuf()</code> </h3>
<p>Mark-Jason Dominus tried to use <code>IO::Handle::setvbuf()</code>, and his recent
5.8ish perl complained that it wasn't implemented (bug #22339). In fact,
PerlIO-enabled perls don't support <code>setvbuf()</code> anymore. This was followed by
a small discussion about different methods to do unbuffered I/O at the C
level.</p>

<p>
<h3> <code>$&lt;digit&gt;</code> scoping</h3>
<p>Bug #22369 demonstrates an oddity concerning the lexical scoping of <code>$1</code>
(and other variables that depend on regexps.) Basically, when the same
scope is entered twice, recursively, and when <code>$1</code> is set by a successful
match inside this scope, the second value obliterates the first one, even
after exiting that scope. Rafael explained what happens behind the scenes
-- <code>$&lt;digit&gt;</code> values are actually associated to regexps, not to
lexical scopes -- and said that this behaviour ought to be better
documented.</p>

<p>
<h3>@INC setup</h3>
<p>There was a small but interesting thread on the default setup of the
@INC path, why it was designed that way, and how OS vendors implement
it. Andy Dougherty summarizes it<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:</p>

<p>
<h3>Cygwin and IO layers</h3>
<p>Gerrit P. Haase, our Cygwin porter, proposed to make no-CRLF the default
for output on Cygwin. It's still possible to to pull it in every time it is
needed with the environment setting PERLIO=crlf, or on a per-filehandle
basis with <code>open OUT, '&gt;:crlf', 'text.txt'</code>. Sounds like a good idea.</p>
<p>
<h3>Unicode char classes proposal</h3>
<p>Jeff Pinyan posted several mails entitled <em>another attempt at adding
unicode regex support to perl</em>, about designing new Unicode-enabled
character classes. For example, <code>[\p{AtoZ}&amp;&amp;\P{Vowels}]</code> would be
equivalent to <code>[b-df-hj-np-tv-z]</code>. He faced Warnock's dilemma at an
unprecedented level.</p>

<h3>In Brief</h3>
<p>Joe McMahon is cleaning up and documenting the perl debugger. He says that
<em>it's about 3000 more lines of POD and comments.</em> And while he's at it,
he fixed a few bugs that were on his way. Impressive.</p>
<p>Alexey Tourbin remarks that <code>a2p</code>, when built, is linked against
libraries that it doesn't actually use (on linux). Andy Dougherty says
it's mostly harmless, at least in the usual cases, and provides a patch
that removes from <code>a2p</code> the libraries that are only needed for
extensions.</p>
<p>A patch that Dave Mitchell sent some time ago, known by the codename of
<strong>jumbo closure patch</strong>, was applied this week. This is basically a
reimplementation of closures in Perl. Apparently it broke something on
HP-UX 11 + gcc.</p>
<p>Dave Rolsky volunteered to backport <code>Time::Local</code> to the CPAN.</p>
<p>
<h3>Best of Bugs</h3>
<p>Manoj Kumar reports (bug #22329) that perldoc doesn't support command-line
options in the PAGER environment variable.</p>
<p>Enache Adrian fixed bug #22372 : in perl 5.8.0, a format that uses a
foreach loop variable is likely to segfault.</p>
<p>Scott A Crosby reports (bug #22371) a way to produce hash keys that will
collide and that may severely degrade performance of hash lookup. This can
be used against some Perl applications as a denial of service attack.
Nobody commented.</p>
<p>Craig Barratt reports (bug #22395) a regular expression,<nobr> <wbr></nobr><code>/(.*)[bc]/</code>
that appears to be much slower in perl 5.8.0 than in perl 5.6.x (it's
apparently O(N^2), versus <code>O(N)</code> previously). It's not clear why.</p>
