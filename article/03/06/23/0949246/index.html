<p><a href="http://www.sidhe.org/user/dan/blog/">Dan</a> writes <i>"With YAPC::NA::2003 over, it's time to get ready for YAPC::NA::2004,
and that means it's time to throw open the call for venues for next
year's YAPC.
</i><p><i>
You can get details on what YAPCs entail in both YAPC.pm, on CPAN, and
at <a href="http://www.yapc.org/venue-reqs.txt">http://www.yapc.org/venue-reqs.txt</a>. When making your proposal, in
addition to venue information and dates, do please make sure to
include details on airport locations, local public transit (as well as
transit to the venue from the airport!), local cultural attractions,
and accommodation information. (See the docs for more details) The
more information you provide, within reason, the better.
</i></p><p><i>
Send the proposals to <a href="mailto:yapc-venues@yetanother.org">yapc-venues@yetanother.org</a>. Proposals are due by
Friday, August 1st 2003, with a decision due two weeks later on August
15th 2003. (If the summertime vacation blahs catch everyone out we may
extend the deadline. Don't count on that) This gives about 7 weeks,
which is short but manageable, and should still fit within most
college and university scheduling requirements."</i></p></p>

<h2>Proposal</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jbisbee/">jbisbee</a> on 2003-06-23T10:53:07</h3>
For YAPC::NA 2003, <a href="/user/KM/" title="perl.org">KM</a perl.org> and I just used a <a href="http://southflorida.pm.org/yapc/" title="pm.org">simgle HTML page</a pm.org> to aggregate all the all of the information associated with our planning.   Be prepared be on the phone A LOT, getting the nessesary details if you decide to under take the proposal phase.  Ideally you need a contact on campus to help you cut through red tape and to help you insure you're talking to the right people.
<p>
I'm putting together a summary of my experience with YAPC::NA 2003 as well as a outline/guideline for upcoming conferences to follow.  I should have a rough draft available in a week or so and will post a URL on use.perl when its ready for feedback.</p>
