<p>What happened this week ? Interesting bugs were found, and solutions
proposed ; new areas explored, technical points raised, and patches
applied.</p>
<p><h2>Multiline regexp flag buggy</h2>
<p>Ton Hospel reported bug #22354, about the use of the multiline flag<nobr> <wbr></nobr><code>/m</code>
in regular expressions : when a function is called from the right side of
a substitution that uses<nobr> <wbr></nobr><code>/m</code>, and when this function uses a second
regular expression, this second regexp has implicitly and incorrectly<nobr> <wbr></nobr><code>/m</code> turned on.</p>
<p>Rafael Garcia-Suarez explained what happens behind the scenes : setting<nobr> <wbr></nobr><code>/m</code> on a match or on a substitution is equivalent to setting the global
special variable $* to 1 (locally). Thus, it will influence the behaviour
of all regexps that haven't<nobr> <wbr></nobr><code>/m</code> or<nobr> <wbr></nobr><code>/s</code> set in that scope.</p>
<p>As $* is deprecated (and discouraged due to its action-at-distance
semantics), Rafael proposes to purely and simply remove it. That will
solve the bug. He asks : <em>when removing a deprecated feature, should the
deprecation warning be removed as well ?</em> </p>

<p>
<h2>Lexical warnings from XS</h2>
<p>Steve Hays asked how to do the equivalent of <code>warnings::warnif()</code> from XS
code (conditionally warn, depending on whether a custom warning category
is in use.) Paul Marquess gives some hints, but says that there is no
general solution at the moment.</p>

<p>
<h2>Temp files</h2>
<p>Should the internal function <code>PerlIO_tempfile()</code> call the core module
File::Temp ? Jarkko Hietaniemi proposed this. This would avoid code
duplication and ensure that the core works at the same safety level as
File::Temp. Gurusamy Sarathy says, however, that this method is bloated
and should be avoided, especially on Windows, where File::Temp is
sub-optimal. He proposed an implementation based on the native Win32 API.
Jarkko reverted his changes.</p>

<p>
<h2>Fat comma auto-quoting</h2>
<p>William R Ward noticed that the fat comma <code>=&gt;</code> no longer auto-quotes
compound barewords (that contain<nobr> <wbr></nobr><code>::</code>.) Thus, something like</p>
<pre>
    %h = (Foo::Bar =&gt; 1);</pre>
<p>is now refused when <code>strict 'subs'</code> is in effect. In fact, only perl
5.6.1 accepted this last construct without complaining. This is
potentially dangerous, because if Foo::Bar is a function here, it's not
turned into a literal string. Rafael and Michael Schwern explored a bit more
this change, and this ended in a documentation patch, to clarify the
current behaviour.</p>

<h2>In brief</h2>
<p>Uri Guttman asks about safe signal callbacks -- more precisely, when can
be a signal callback be invoked, under the new safe signal implementation.
Nick Ing-Simmons says that perl dispatches signals when it gets its
next operation. However, the IO system may also dispatch them when it
gets an <em>interrupted function call</em> error (EINTR).</p>
<p>Dan Kogai proposes that on Mac OS X perl should not be built as a shared
library by default, to resolve prebinding woes. (Moreover that's the
default on most other platforms.) Chris Nandor wonders about whether it
would be useful to use prebinding for XS. Dan doesn't think it's a good
idea.</p>
<p>Michael Schwern asked for clarifications about how the <em>used only once</em>
typo warning works, and why it works that way. Rafael explains that it's
issued only at compile-time, and not for variables defined in modules
pulled in by <code>use</code>.</p>
<pre>
    <a href="http://xrl.us/jb8">http://xrl.us/jb8</a> </pre>
<p>Ton Hospel came up with	a new bug gem : #22614, <em>the array length of @-
and @+ is not properly localized during backtracking</em>, which leads to the
presence of spurious undefined values in those arrays.</p>
<p>Steve Hay released Win32::UTCFileTime on CPAN, a module intended to
provide alternative versions of the built-in functions stat(), <code>lstat()</code> and
<code>utime()</code> on Win32 systems, to handle correctly UTC file times.</p>

<p>Jarkko released a new maintperl snapshot.</p>
