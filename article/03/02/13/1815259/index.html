<h2>An interesting article (including part 2)</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/SuperCruncher/">SuperCruncher</a> on 2003-02-13T20:45:03</h3>
This was quite an interesting article. It started off well, and thankfully didn't contribute to the FUD that Perl 6 is going to be a completely different language. That's good as worryingly, there are even some people in the Perl community with this view--they should really read Damian Conway's <a href="http://www.samag.com/documents/s=4075/sam1013019189971/sam0203h.htm" title="samag.com">And Now for Something Completely Similar</a samag.com> article.<p>

I don't reallly see how mentioning the fact that the main "design team" are having to look for employment is "strange". It's a major issue facing Perl 6 development. AFAIK Larry Wall is the only person receiving funding from the <a href="http://www.perlfoundation.org/" title="perlfoundation.org">Perl Foundation</a perlfoundation.org> (he told me himself when I was talking to him at <a href="http://www.yapc.org/Europe/2002" title="yapc.org">YAPC::Europe::2002</a yapc.org>).  I also asked him how soon he thought Perl 6 would be released. He replied "A fully functional Perl 5 equivalent is still a year away". That now seems wildly optimistic.</p><p>
Perl 6 development has significantly slowed, and it's an important point. It's been ages since the <a href="http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2002/06/04/apo5.html" title="perl.com">last apocolypse</a perl.com> and Damian Conway recently announced he was <a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=3E398D2E.4030500%40conway.org" title="google.com">taking a sabbatical</a google.com> from the perl6-language list.</p><p>
As a little aside, if anyone's still a bit lukewarm on Perl 6, please try and get to one of Damian Conway's talks. Once you leave the talk, you'll be wishing Perl 6 was already out.</p>

That sabatical was from the lists, in part to allow more time to contribute to the next A. work on the next E.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...at least that's how I read it<br> <br>-matt<br>

The design team just had a face-to-face meeting in Sebastopol last week, to break the icejam around the next Apocalypse.  They made some breakthroughs and are all fired up--Larry was talking about when he would have a draft for Damian and the others to look over.  The proof of the pudding is in the eating (or reading, in this case) but I think the Apocalypses are set to flow again.<p>

As for Damian, well it got to the point where most of his day was spent in perl6-language discussions and not actually helping to designing the perl 6 language<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)  p6lang has proved a good resource, which is why Luke Palmer is monitoring it.  The effort of finding signal in noise, and cancelling out the noise, is effort that right now it's
more important Damian spend on designing perl6 (and feeding Damian1<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-) than on p6lang.</p><p>

<h2>Things are looking a little better</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Elian/">Elian</a> on 2003-02-13T21:32:44</h3>
Luckily things are looking up at least a little. I've got work now, so at least some of us are funded for a while.



<h2>namespace collisions</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/merlyn/">merlyn</a> on 2003-02-16T16:30:13</h3>
A couple of times while reading the second part, I did a double-take.  <i>Randal said "..."</i>.  Except I didn't say those.  Until I realized that this was a last name, not a first name!  Name collisions.
