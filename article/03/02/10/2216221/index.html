<p>I'm not sure whether it's me or if the Perl 5 porters discussions were
actually a bit shorter than usual, but this week's summary, indeed,
appears to be a bit shorter than usual. This doesn't mean that it's
absolutely without interest.</p>
<p><h2>Maintenance releases</h2>
<p>Leon Brocard asked for the <a href="http://archive.develooper.com/perl5-porters@perl.org/msg91424.html">expected
availability</a> of the 5.005_04 and 5.6.2
releases. Notably, there are known fixes to allow building perl 5.005_03
and 5.6.1 with the newest versions of gcc and of the Berkeley DB. Gurusamy
Sarathy intends to release a 5.6.2, and adds that smoke tests results are
welcome. Tim Bunce and Nicholas Clark add that <em>it's important that the
Perl community be seen to actively support at least one previous major
version.</em> </p>
<p>
<h2>Reducing op size</h2>
<p>Stephen McCamant provided some ideas about <a href="http://archive.develooper.com/perl5-porters@perl.org/msg91553.html">removing
the op_seq field</a> from
the op node structure (more precisely, to reduce it to two flags). An op
could be reasonably identified by a couple (address, checksum of fields).
He also sent a patch for B::Concise to remove its dependency on op_seq.</p>
<p>
<h2>Seeking a safe signal test</h2>
<p>Jarkko Hietaniemi proposes to add a new magic variable <a href="http://archive.develooper.com/perl5-porters@perl.org/msg91763.html">${^SIGNAL_UNSAFE}</a>
(or something) to restore locally the pre-5.8.0 unsafe signal behavior
when set to a true value.</p>
<p>He asks whether someone could provide <em>sample code of where the safe
signals reliably gets it wrong</em>, to be used as a basis for tests for
this new feature. To be noted, this kind of tests are extremely dependent
on the platform.</p>
<p>
<h2>In brief</h2>
<p>Robert Spier posted a handy list of untouched bugs, alongside his weekly
perlbug summary. He says that <em>a bunch of em look easy</em>, and I feel
guilty : he's right.</p>
<p>Dustin Jones reports an interesting parser bug (#20716) : the lexical $x
in the double-quoted string below is not seen by perl<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:</p>
<pre>
    my $x = 'x'; print &quot;${x}{&quot;;</pre>
<p>(removing the <code>my</code> solves the problem.) Enache Adrian provided a fix.</p>
<p>Dan Kogai reported that formats don't seem to play well with PerlIO and
Unicode strings. This didn't surprise Jarkko. Inaba Hiroto proposed some
patches to fix this.</p>
<p>Enache Adrian was busy solving several bugs related to <code>goto</code> : segfaults
(#20154, #20357) and a newly discovered memory leak (#20777).</p>
<p>Ton Hospel reported three new regular expressions bugs (if I count
correctly).</p>
<p>Abigail requests that Test::Harness should provide a way to be optionally
silenced. Currently it prints a string for each test ran (the counter.)
This may take some time for large test suites.</p>
<p>H. Merijn Brand reports that Cygwin v1.3.20 now has <code>nanosleep()</code> and that
bleadperl successfully compiles and passes all tests on it.</p>

<h2>Large test suites</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jdavidb/">jdavidb</a> on 2003-02-12T18:19:36</h3>
<p> <i>Abigail requests that Test::Harness should provide a way to be optionally silenced. Currently it prints a string for each test ran (the counter.) This may take some time for large test suites.</i> </p>

<p>Which tantalizes with the thought of "What is Abigail testing with such a huge test suite?"</p>

It's a pleasure to answer easy questions : <a href="http://search.cpan.org/author/ABIGAIL/Regexp-Common/" title="cpan.org">Regexp::Common</a cpan.org>. Impressive test suite, indeed.
