<p><p> <a href="mailto:jhi@iki.fi">jhi</a> writes "Last weekend (the 7th/8th) the <a href="http://www.csc.fi/suomi/funet/verkko.html.en/">FUNET</a> maintainers noticed that some disks of the RAID system had started reporting read errors.  The ftp.funet.fi hosts, among other things, the CPAN master site.</p>

<p>To minimize the activity in the system while they isolate and repair the problems (figure which disks are faulty, and possibly restore some stuff from backups), the FUNET maintainers have turned off cron jobs, which means that the PAUSE -&gt; CPAN mirroring has been stopped.  This in turn means that new module submissions do not get propagated and that new module submissions do not get indexed by search.cpan.org.
</p>

<p>We realize that this may frustrate some module authors who want their new submissions to propagate and to be visible as soon as possible, but please wait patiently while the FUNET people fix things properly.  You wouldn't want a corrupt copy of your module to be propagated, now would you?"</p></p>

Oddly, I haven't noticed any change in the "recent" status since this was posted.  I still see daily uploads.  However, I've already noticed at least one module (Net-Traceroute) that was no longer available for download.
<p>
What's up?</p>

<p>How many ways are there to say "Hey, sonny, It's b0rked."? Graham may have made a mistake in turning the recent modules functionality back on as it leads people to believe, like you, that they can download new modules when they cannot. The search box isn't using FUNET for the modules mirror...all the regular mirrors do....do the math.</p>

<p>FUNET seems to have made some progress with the hardware and things may be back to normal by the end of the week.</p>
