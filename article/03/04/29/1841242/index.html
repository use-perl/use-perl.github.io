<p><a href="http://www.kineticode.com/">Theory</a> writes: <i>"Perhaps sensing the warm breezes of spring and the slow thawing of IT budgets,
<a href="http://bricolage.cc/">Bricolage</a> 1.6 has made a break for freedom
in the wilds of the Internet. No competing content management system is safe from
the wiles of this robust Perl-powered publishing system. You have been
warned."</i>  Joe-Bob says: "Check it out."</p>
<p>The Bricolage team is pleased to announce the release of
Bricolage 1.6.0. This is the first new stable release of Bricolage since the
release of version 1.4.6 in January, and the first major release since 1.4.0
in September, 2002. The result of contributions from Bricolage community
members from around the world, version 1.6.0 is the most full-featured, best
performing, most stable version of Bricolage yet.

<p>Here's a sampling of the major new features in version 1.6.0:</p>

<ul>
<li>Added Field Profile, so that element Fields can be edited. This is a
        marked improvement over the old interface, which required that
        fields be deleted and recreated if users wanted to change them.</li>

<li>Added &quot;Super Bulk Edit&quot;, which is a bulk edit interface allowing
        users to edit all of the fields in an element at once using POD-like
        tags, rather than just a single repeatable field.</li>

<li>Ported Bricolage to HTML::Mason 1.16 and later.</li>

<li>Added the &quot;STORY_URI_WITH_FILENAME&quot; bricolage.conf directive, which,
        when enabled, allows story URIs to include the file name. This is
        especially useful in output channels where &quot;Use Slug as File name&quot;
        is enabled, since it allows stories to essentially have identical
        URIs except for the file name.</li>

<li>Lots of group-related optimizations. These should greatly improve
        the speed with which permissions are checked.</li>

<li>Added WebDAV mover.</li>

<li>Complete rewrite of much of the database access code in the majority
        of the Bricolage classes to greatly improve performance. The number
        of database calls in a given Bricolage screen has also be drastically
        reduced by several orders of magnitude, thanks to the loading of
        each object's ACL when it is retrieved from the database, rather than
        one-at-a-time for every object on a screen.</li>

<li>Added per-request object caching, boosting burn performance up
        to 33%.</li>

<li>Localization and Internationalization support introduced, with
        Portuguese and Italian libraries to complement the default English.</li>

<li>Keywords can now be associated with media documents as well as
        story documents.</li>

<li>Added preview link to every element profile of a story profile
        and to every view of a document in workflow.</li>

<li>Switched exceptions from home-grown to using Exception::Class.</li>

<li>The &quot;Content&quot; section of story, media, and subelement profiles now
        attempts to display a bit of text from the first text field in each
        listed subelement so that it's easier to see at a glance which
        subelement is which.</li>

<li>Added unit and regression testing suite with over 3200 tests.</li>

<li>Moved URI formatting preferences to output channel profiles, so that
        they are now output-channel specific.</li>

<li>Added ability for stories to be associated with output channels on
        a case-by-case basis.</li>

<li>Added support for utility templates, which don't have to be associated
        with elements or act as category templates. This is useful for code
        that's not content-specific, but which may be useful in a variety of
        templating contexts.</li>

<li>Stories can now be cloned -- that is, exact copies can be created.</li>

<li>Improved CSS and JavaScript support for the UI.</li>

<li>Added many new methods to the Burner API to assist with linking to
        other pages in a document and in determining the type of burn
        (preview or publish) from within a template.</li>
</ul>
