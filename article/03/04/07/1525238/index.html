<h2>Great, now all I want is a few things fixed</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/SuperCruncher/">SuperCruncher</a> on 2003-04-07T19:26:19</h3>
I highlighted some sloppy errors on the <a href="http://www.perlfoundation.org/" title="perlfoundation.org">Perl Foundation</a perlfoundation.org> web site in <a href="http://use.perl.org/comments.pl?sid=7472&amp;cid=11371" title="perl.org">my comment about 9 months ago</a perl.org> and they still haven't been fixed (well, the whitespace issue has been fixed, but the other issues still stand).<p>
It's good to see the Perl Foundation asking for the community for its input, and at the very least, hopefully this will encourage people to contribute. Meanwhile, I'm racking my brains on what I can try to apply for a grant for<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-) (I know, I know -- if you can't think of anything now you probably don't have anything worthy of a grant, but well...)</p>

Patches are welcome, griping is not. Why don't you submit for a grant for myself, so maintaining all these sites (YAS related ones) isn't an "as tuits provide" volunteer basis if fixing minor things is such an issue? Nah.. that would make too much sense.

Do I send the patch direct to you? I would probably need access to the "source" page though (as otherwise I'd just be saving the page with headlines, i.e. not with the code to display the headlines).

send me an email (perlguy (at) perlguy (dot) com) and I'll make sure to tell you where to find what you need.

<h2>Collecting ideas</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Simon/">Simon</a> on 2003-04-08T13:11:11</h3>
I've started collecting ideas of interesting projects I'd like to see happen (but don't have the time to do myself) on my <a href="http://blog.simon-cozens.org/blosxom.cgi/2003/Apr/8" title="simon-cozens.org">blog</a simon-cozens.org>. Please feel free to send me suggestions for things to add there. Oh, and please feel free to be inspired by some of them and apply to TPF for a grant to do them!



<h2>TPF Challenge</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/sheriff_p/">sheriff_p</a> on 2003-04-08T15:19:20</h3>
I have $100 I want to donate to TPF, but also a module I want to rid of bugs...
