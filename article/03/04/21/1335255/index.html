"Mac OS" and "Unix", not "MacOS" and "UNIX".

You are right about MacOS -&gt; "Mac OS". Still, UNIX can be spelled either as "UNIX" or "Unix". I'm used to using all caps. Check for instance the
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=unix&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8" title="google.com">
Google search</a google.com>. Do you think "Unix" is less intimidating?

I am saying UNIX is incorrect.  Only because it is <a href="http://info.astrian.net/jargon/terms/u/Unix.html" title="astrian.net">true</a astrian.net>.  It makes you look less knowledgeable by using it.

The resource you gave (the Jargon file entry) does not say UNIX is incorrect, just that Dennis Ritchie prefers it as Unix. I am used to use UNIX and as the Google search proves so are many others. I think I'll stick to it.

Yeah, and PERL isn't wrong, it's just that Larry Wall prefers it as Perl.<br> <br>Use what you will, but expect that people who know better will think you don't know what you're talking about.  Your loss.

The term UNIX is owned and trademarked by the
Open group. They write it as UNIX, in all caps.
Also, in the link you posted, it says that dmr
<em>failed</em> to get the spelling changed from
UNIX to Unix. The article further says
<em>both capitalizations are grounded in ancient usage</em> and <em>both forms are common, and used interchangeably</em>.
<p>
I'd say that insisting there is only one correct
way to spell Unix makes you look less knowledgeable.

You have a point, but anyone who's taking style advice from trademark lawyers has bigger problems.  I don't decorate my writing with &reg; and &trade;, and I'd put that in the same category as <a href="http://www.theslot.com/webnames.html" title="theslot.com">gratuitous all caps</a theslot.com>.  You have to draw the line somewhere, or companies will be insisting you refer to their products only in 72-point Comic Sans with metallic silver ink.

Rather than just complain, it's nice to see someone take active steps to do something about a problem.<br> <p>Good luck!</p>

<h2>Bad attribution for Llama book as well</h2>

TC was listed as the co-author of the 2nd edition.  The third edition is co-authored by Tom Phoenix.  Different Tom.  And a complete rewrite from previous editions.

There seems to be sporadic problems with the berlios.de web-server. It should be OK sometimes soon now. Please try again later.
