<p>Not a good week to stop smoking ! Test-wise, that is. In this week's
summary, read about configuration changes, language proposals, and the
usual amount of bug fixes.</p>
<p><h3>Binary error messages</h3>
<p>Marc Lehmann remarks that the current maintperl may produce error messages
that contain a null character (bug #21962), with the one-liner<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:</p>
<pre><nobr> <wbr></nobr>./perl -e '&amp;{&quot;&quot;}'</pre>
<p>Abhijit Menon-Sen finds out that perl, trying to access a symbol that has
an empty name, sets explicitly the length of this name to 1, which seems
obviously wrong, and thus fixes the bug by suppressing this behaviour.</p>
<pre>
    <a href="http://xrl.us/gll">http://xrl.us/gll</a> </pre>
<p>
<h3>Long Doubles</h3>
<p>There was a long thread, mainly involving Jarkko and Merijn -- the
Configure guys -- about Configure's support for long doubles. A patch for
long double support on Solaris (by Alan Burlison) was integrated. An
important question was raised, which was : if we ask Configure to enable
long double support in perl, (or, similarly, 64 bit integers), and if
Configure fails to detect support for it on the platform, should it abort
? The answer, for now, is yes. As a consequence, some holes appear in the
smoke matrices, corresponding to now-disallowed configs.</p>

<p>
<h3>Ties, Fetches and Storabilization</h3>
<p>The patch that Dave Mitchell sent last week, to allow nested <code>FETCH</code>es, has
been applied. The benchmarks give varying results, which apparently are
due, as Dave says, to <em>the usual cache noise effects</em>, which have been
encountered before. So this patch probably doesn't change significantly
the (already low) performance of ties.</p>
<p>Speaking about ties, <code>Storable</code> now handles self-tied objects (bug
#17040, fixed), thanks to Abhijit. The question of serializing tied
objects is raised again ; David Nicol proposes the convention to use
SERIALIZE and DESERIALIZE special methods. Slaven Rezic points out that
<code>Storable</code> uses already the STORABLE_thaw and STORABLE_freeze methods, if
they're available.</p>

<p>
<h3>More on cross-compilation</h3>
<p>Redvers Davies posted refactored patches to add support for
cross-compilation to perl. Jarkko is considering merging them into perl
5.8.1. Vadim Konovalov reminds us about the <code>Cross.pm</code> module, created
during the cross-compilation process for WinCE, which is basically a
substitution for <code>Config.pm</code> when cross-compiling (either perl itself, or
perl modules).</p>

<h3>More black smoke</h3>
<p>Nicholas Clark is struggling with strange smoke failures on BSD.
Unreproducibly, for some reasons, Makefile.PL expansion is going wrong
under crontab.</p>

<p>
<h3>In Brief</h3>
<p>Nathan Torkington notices that reading from a magic scalar with
<code>PerlIO::scalar</code> sometimes causes coredumps. This buglet is fixed by
Enache Adrian.</p>
<p>Jarkko Hietaniemi finished to add a new function <tt>PerlIO::get_layers()</tt>, to
retrieve the I/O layers for a given filehandle. Dan Kogai is excited about
it.</p>
<p>Bug #21979 demonstrates that, with an ithread-enabled perl, <em>modifying an
alias to a read-only item of an argument list of a subroutine works, while
it's expected to fail.</em> </p>
<p>Arthur Bergman and Dave Mitchell are struggling with pads, ithreads,
cloning, and closures, and finally fix an obscure bug I don't understand.</p>
<p>Shlomi Fish posted a proposal to add three new keywords, <code>class</code>, <code>up</code>
and <code>this</code>, to manipulate namespaces. He didn't get positive feedback.</p>
