<p>This week's summary presents a nice variety of language issues. Read about some new errors, documentation patches, bug closing and configuration.</p>
<p><h3>Don't assign to <code>%::</code> </h3>
<p>Dave Mitchell proposed to change assignments to <code>%::</code> to be a
compile-time error (currently, this may cause crashes, and a non-warned
user may fall in this trap). Enache Adrian objected that this doesn't
prevent all nasty things that may be done with the main stash, and thus
was unnecessary bloat. Arthur Bergman proposes to mark <code>%::</code> as read-only
instead. Hugo van der Sanden feels this patch is actually trying to hide
other problems.</p>

<p>
<h3>Use of freed value in iteration</h3>
<p>It's a well-known fact that you can crash perl by modifying an array over
which a <code>for</code> loop iterates. Dave Mitchell changed this into a new fatal
run-time error, <strong>Use of freed value in iteration</strong>.</p>
<pre>
    <a href="http://xrl.us/g4p">http://xrl.us/g4p</a> </pre>
<p>
<h3>Localization of lvalues</h3>
<p>Dave Mitchell (who got bored and was browsing the bug database) reminds
the crowd that <code>local($x='bar')</code> is currently equivalent to <code>$x='bar'</code>
(i.e. the <code>local()</code> is silently ignored). This is not the right thing ; it
should either produce some error, or localize $x, before or after the
assignment occurs. The general opinion is to disallow it, purely and
simply. Rafael, noticing that other lvalues can be localized (e.g. <code>pos</code>
or <code>substr</code>, although not very reliably sometimes), thinks this should be
fixed to work. Hugo, however, says that the most we can do is to add a
deprecation warning.</p>

<p>
<h3>Slice auto-extending</h3>
<p>But Dave didn't stop there. He also asked about whether <code>splice()</code> should
extend the array it operates on (bug #1832). The consensus was to fix the
docs, which are unclear.</p>

    <a href="http://xrl.us/g4r">http://xrl.us/g4r</a> </pre>
<p>
<h3>Restricted hashes strike back</h3>
<p>Jarkko asks for someone to solve the remaining problems about restricted
hashes -- that replace pseudohashes in the implementation of the
<code>fields</code> pragma in the perls to be released. And this someone will be<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...
Dave Mitchell ! (More precisely, the problem is with list assignment to a
restricted hash.) Dave sends a patch that modifies the way a restricted
hash is cleared : all keys are set to placeholders. So you can now assign
a list to a restricted hash ( <code>%h = (key =&gt; 1)</code> ). However, if this
list contains a disallowed key, %h is left empty rather than with its
original contents.</p>

    <a href="http://xrl.us/g4s">http://xrl.us/g4s</a> </pre>
<p>
<h3>Documentation effort</h3>
<p>Casey West announces that he's going to <em>do something useful for
documentation</em>, and posts a list of goals. Notably, he's willing to
coordinate and encourage efforts. Then, proving it, he posted a large
number of documentation patches, closing a large number of bugs.</p>
<pre>
    <a href="http://xrl.us/g4t">http://xrl.us/g4t</a> </pre>
<p>Meanwhile, Nick Ing-Simmons agrees that the PerlIO / open / binmode /
perliol docs need to be cleaned up so that they fit more nicely together.</p>
<p>
<h3>Duplicating the DATA filehandle</h3>
<p>Josh Purinton notices (bug #22010) that reading from a dup'ed DATA
filehandle, by doing <code>open(F,&quot;&lt;&amp;DATA&quot;)</code>, in fact doesn't read
anything. (Further investigation indicates that this only occurs when the
environment variable PERLIO is set at <code>stdio</code>.) Nick Ing-Simmons points
out that when the dup is done, the file pointer of DATA is at EOF, and
that dup'ing DATA is not going to copy the DATA buffer.</p>

    <a href="http://xrl.us/g4u">http://xrl.us/g4u</a> </pre>
<p>
<h3>Lists in scalar context</h3>
<p>Bug #22027 is merely a question, asked by Mike Stok : the value of $x,
after this statement<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:</p>
<pre>
    $x = (1,2,3,());</pre>
<p>is <code>undef</code>. Is this the right thing to do, or should the final
parentheses be ignored, hence setting $x to 3 ? Graham Barr explains that
<em>a list in a scalar context evaluates each element in a scalar context
before any flattening is done.</em> </p>
<pre>
    <a href="http://xrl.us/g4v">http://xrl.us/g4v</a> </pre>
<p>
<h3>sfio</h3>
<p>Nick Ing-Simmons asks whether sfio support can be removed. Andy Dougherty
and Stas Bekman point out that it's used on some mod_perl installations,
because under mod_perl STDOUT is tied (unless perl is compiled to use the
sfio library), and formats don't work with a tied STDOUT. Mark Mielke
considers that writing a CGI and expecting it to work under mod_perl is
naive anyway.</p>

    <a href="http://xrl.us/g4w">http://xrl.us/g4w</a> </pre>
<p>
<h3>prebind on Mac OS X</h3>
<p>Nathan Torkington asks about the use of the <code>-prebind</code> linker option on
Mac OS X. Dan Kogai tells him to use the update_prebinding command, which
should optimize the loading of XS modules (and other dynamic libraries).
Wilfredo S&#225;nchez adds that adding <code>-prebind</code> to the linker flags can't
hurt.</p>

<p>
<h3>etc.</h3>
<p>Dave Mitchell fixed a case of memory corruption with the <code>goto &amp;sub</code>
construct.</p>
<p>Abe Timmerman released Test-Smoke v1.17, with loads of improvements.</p>
<p>Peter Scott produces a mysterious case (filed as bug #21999) where $1 is
modified by an unsuccessful regex match, inside a <code>for</code> loop.</p>
<p>Several people walked through the bug database, closing bugs to be closed,
or proposing fixes for old bugs. Thanks to Robert, Ask, Arthur, Dave,
Casey, and probably others.</p>
