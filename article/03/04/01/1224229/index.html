<h1>Matt Wright buys out CPAN.  DOJ say Wha?</h1>

<p><a href="http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/user/jas">Jasvir Nagra</a> writes <i>"In an unanticipated move Matt Wright of <a href="http://www.scriptarchive.com/">MSA</a> fame has bought out <a href="http://www.cpan.org/">CPAN</a>, the beloved archive of perl
modules that forms the core of the perl community.  This morning
bleary eyed perl hackers all over the world stood stunned over their
coffee buckets, as the regular reload of www.cpan.org saw the familiar
CPAN logo replaced by the haunting flashy banner of MSA.  MSA is a
collection of perl cgi scripts written by perl programmer Matt Wright,
that has been on the web since the early 1995.  The archive
constitutes perhaps the most popular repository of perl scripts
currently available on the internet and has almost an iron grip
monopoly on the world of free scripts.
</i><p><i>
However, all is not well at the MSA headquarters (located at One MSA
Way, Seattle).  MSA has often been accused of providing scripts that
are badly written, buggy and insecure and has been the target of a lot
of wrath by the otherwise rather tolerant and meek perl community.
Recent scathing remarks by <a href="http://www.stonehenge.com/">Randal Schwartz, aka merlyn,</a> were
picked up by the media causing a minor uproar.  The accusations have
been sufficiently loudly voiced that recently even DOJ's interest was
piqued - this inspite of their recent shortcomings in a similar but
smaller case of monopolistic practices.
</i></p><p><i>
The backslash has been accompanied by the formation of Not Matts
Scripts (NMS), a rebellion group designing a set of drop-in
replacement scripts for those provided by MSA.  A nonprofit group, led
by the <a href="http://london.pm.org/">London PM</a> and calling
themselves a Merry Bunch of Hackers, these perl programmers aim to
provide a fully functioning alternative that "work exactly as before,
except that the user will sleep easier knowing that their web site is
that little more secure".
</i></p><p><i>
The continued popularity of Matts scripts inspite of NMS attempts to
undermine it is touted by some as proof that all the fuss is just too
many $`$'$&amp;s in the s//g.  While London.pm proudly points to their
growing list of ISPs that prefer NMS over MSA, their wins in the
server market is dwarfed by their complete failure to penetrate the
desktop community.  Perhaps the biggest blow to MSA was a few comments
by Matt that was leaked by his webmaster to the world.  An excerpt
from the memo, now often referred to has the Halloween Memos evidenced
the lack of faith Mr Wright himself had in his own organization:
</i></p><p><i>
<tt>
While the free code found at my web site has not evolved
      much in recent years, the general programming practices and standards
      of CGI programs have. nms is an attempt by very active programmers in
      the Perl community to bring the quality of code for these types of
      programs up to date and eliminate some of the bad programming practices
      and bugs found in the existing Matt's Script Archive
      code.
<tt>
I would highly recommend downloading the nms versions if
      you wish to learn CGI programming. The code you find at Matt's Script
      Archive is not representative of how even I would code these
      days.
</tt>
</tt></i></p><p><i><tt>
This mornings replacement of the CPAN front page with a copy of MSA
frontpage was met with varied response.  Markus Dominus wearing his
favorite red "Just Another $#@_&amp;! hacker" t-shirt, said it was a
disappointing blow but admitted that most people are idiots anyways,
while d@rKn1t3, a thirteen year old self proclaimed hacker was heard
to say "p30pl3 who use NMS are l@m3r5.  I can't own j00r."  Tom
McSweeney, corn farmer from Idaho and winner of this years rude
vegetable competition commented "Wha?"."</tt> </i></p></p>

Replacing the primary entry point for one of the world's largest repositories of source code as a prank.... I've heard worse ideas, but as most of them came from people who were beyond the stage of dunkeness where they understood why I was holding their hair out of the way, that's not much of a benchmark.<nobr> <wbr></nobr><tt>;-)</tt> <br>

After seeing and recognizing this and a number of other "obvious" April Fools postings around the net, I got caught.
<p>
I was talking on the phone to my wife.  She mentioned that she was about to do a small shopping, and that we were out of Coke - would I like her to pick up some of the new Freedom Cola that Coke and Pepsi had come out with to show a spirit of co-operation in time of war.  Don't get a whole case, I fell.  I'll try a single bottle sometime.</p>
