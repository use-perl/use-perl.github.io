<p>This week : Mac OS X problems, big and small patch proposals,
cross-compilation and unknown errors.</p>
<p><h3>use base and import</h3>
<p>Casey West proposed a patch to call the <code>import()</code> method of a module
referenced through the <code>use base</code> pragma. Graham Barr disagrees,
saying that <code>use base</code> should only be used to set up inheritance, and
Michael Schwern threatens to call the backward compatibility police.</p>
<pre>
    <a href="http://xrl.us/f4p">http://xrl.us/f4p</a> </pre>
<p>
<h3>Cross-compilation</h3>
<p>Redvers Davies complains that there's too little information about the
cross-compilation of perl. Nevertheless, he successfully produced perl
packages for the OpenZaurus OS (<a href="http://www.openzaurus.org/">http://www.openzaurus.org/</a>), including
dynamically loaded extensions, and the ability to cross-compile XS modules !
(Perl 5.8.0 has the beginning of a minimal support for cross-compilation.
Let's hope it can be improved by this impressive work.)</p>
<pre>
    <a href="http://xrl.us/f4q">http://xrl.us/f4q</a> </pre>
<p>
<h3>Unknown error</h3>
<p>Tels manages to have perl to emit an actual <em>Unknown error</em>. This obscure
message is actually produced by perl when it fails to load a module, and
fails again to get an error message for this first failure.
Enache Adrian provided a fix.</p>
<pre>
    <a href="http://xrl.us/f4r">http://xrl.us/f4r</a>
    <a href="http://xrl.us/f4s">http://xrl.us/f4s</a> </pre>
<p>
<h3>Mac OS X peculiarities</h3>
<p>Michael Schwern notices that <code>nobody</code>, the traditional Unix
low-privileged user, has user id -2 on Mac OS X (according to<nobr> <wbr></nobr><em>/etc/passwd</em>), but the <code>uid_t</code> C type is actually an unsigned integer.
Consequently, <code>getpwnam()</code> says that <code>nobody</code>'s UID is 4294967294. Looks
logical. We've seen weirder things.</p>
<p>This doesn't seem to be related to the fact that you can't run perldoc as
root on Mac OS X. That's what Dan Kogai explains after a few tests of
changing the UID and EUID on various BSD flavors.</p>
<pre>
    <a href="http://xrl.us/f4t">http://xrl.us/f4t</a> </pre>
<p>Michael also criticizes the choice of the default <em>vendorlib</em> location on
OS X. In fact, he doesn't think that <em>vendorlib</em> should be set at all in
a hints file. Wilfredo S&aacute;nchez asks for more info, and is working
on a patch, both for the Darwin and Rhapsody hints files. (By the way,
Wilfredo doesn't have a Mac OS X server, so he'll patch blindly unless
someone wants to test bleadperl and/or maintperl on Rhapsody.)</p>

<h3> <code>h2xs</code> and enums</h3>
<p>Tassilo von Parseval notices (bug #21887) that <code>h2xs</code> doesn't generate
constants from the enumerated types found in C header files. Nicholas
Clark explains how to use ExtUtils::Constant to achieve the desired
effect.</p>
<pre>
    <a href="http://xrl.us/f4v">http://xrl.us/f4v</a> </pre>
<p>
<h3>Big Bug Fixes</h3>
<p>Pradeep Hodigere proposed a patch to speed up some of the perl built-ins
when handling UTF8 data (and he provided also benchmark results).
Basically his solution is to add a field <code>sv_length</code> to the internal SV
structure, to hold the length, in chars, of the scalar string value.
Nobody commented yet.</p>
<pre>
    <a href="http://xrl.us/f4w">http://xrl.us/f4w</a> </pre>
<p>Dave Mitchell sent a patch to allow <em>FETCH to access arrays and hashes
which are themselves tied without fear of crashing</em> (a.k.a. nested
FETCHes). I personally don't understand fully the solution. Nobody
commented yet. No, wait, Arthur Bergman said it was nice ! and asked for
benchmarks.</p>
<pre>

<p>
<h3>Beware the precedence police</h3>
<p>Dan Kogai complains that this code<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:</p>
<pre>
    print chr(0xE3).chr(0x81).chr(0x82) =~<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/^\x{3042}$/ ? 'true' : 'false';</pre>
<p>prints <em>true</em>. Then, he ceases to complain when he realizes that the
precedence of<nobr> <wbr></nobr><code>.</code> is actually lower than the precedence of <code>=~</code>. Tom
Horsley comments that <em>APL was the only language that ever got precedence
and associativity correct.</em> </p>

<p>
<h3>In brief</h3>
<p>Jarkko Hietaniemi reports that Devel::Coverage doesn't work with perl
5.8.0, while it works with perl 5.6.1 (bug #21890). Randy J. Ray says
he'll look at it. Stas Bekman suggests that the problem might be similar
to one he found on Apache::DB.</p>
<p>Long doubles are now correctly recognized by the Configure script on AIX,
thanks to John Allen and Merijn Brand. They also improved the compiler
detection mechanism, if I understood correctly.</p>
<p>Pierre Denis reports a parsing bug (#21875) involving a hash key which is
a bareword beginning by <code>q</code>, and a pair of braces that can be seen as a
block or as a literal hashref. Dave Mitchell sends a fix.</p>
<p>Alberto Sim&otilde;es says that it'd be nice to have a function in
Data::Dumper to dump the structures directly to a chosen filehandle.
Patches welcome !</p>
<p>Nathan Torkington asks a bunch of I/O layer questions, and gets some
answers.</p>

<h2>Pradeep Hodigere's patch</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jhi/">jhi</a> on 2003-04-14T11:48:19</h3>
I saw that fly by in the p5p archives but did not have the time to comment.  See change #18353: basically what he is proposing has already been done, kind of.  I did it with MAGIC (instead of adding a new struct member, which is probably unthinkable at this stage of the Perl 5 codebase), and in addition to length I also cache the byte/character position, which is useful for regular expressions or anything that scans through the string.  The length part is simple, the position caching code is horrible.<br>
