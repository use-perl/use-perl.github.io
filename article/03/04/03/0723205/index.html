<p>Arnaud writes <i>"Yesterday, I have found the EPIC project made by Jochen Luell and Regis Ebersole.<br/><br/>EPIC is a collection of Perl plugins for Eclipse. Currently the following plugins are under development:
- Perl Editor Plugin
- Perl Degugger Plugin
- RegExp Plugin<br/><br/>URL : <a href="http://e-p-i-c.sourceforge.net/">http://e-p-i-c.sourceforge.net/</a>."</i> Looks a little like <a href="http://www.activestate.com/Products/Komodo/">Komodo</a>, does it not?</p>

I just started using Eclipse recently, and just found the Perl plugin yesterday. Haven't installed it yet, but it sure does look sweet. Looking forward to heard reviews!!



<h2>Yes!</h2>

Eclipse is an excellent IDE. There are lots of pluggable environments out there (Emacs, Jedit, XUL-based tools, etc), but Eclipse has got real momentum and support behind it. Glad to see Perl finally get some support.



<h2>Debugger?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/djberg96/">djberg96</a> on 2003-04-03T18:59:22</h3>
Ok, either I'm totally blind or there's no Debugger Plugin download link in the "Downloads" section at the bottom.  I see the Editor and Regex plugin fine.  I see the "Perl Debugger Plugin" listed as "Under Development" at the top of the page, but no link anywhere.
<p>
Is it actually "out there" or just being worked on?
</p><p>
Also, does anyone know if these plugins work with 2.1 or are they 2.0.x only?</p>

Read the page carefully. It's not a debugger, it's a degugger!<br/><br/>Personally, I'm excited about this. I don't know of any other IDE that can degug perl.

Open Perl IDE for windows, also available on sourceforge, has a built-in debugger too. Last time I used it though syntax highlighting was often erroneous and the debugger itself often was not working properly. However, it is small and simple, I'd like to see work on it continued too (development seems somewhat stalled in recent months).

Can somebody please port the Smalltalk VisualWorks Debugger to Perl (and the whole IDE for that matter)?

Heh - someone must have read your post.  It's fixed now.

... if you want better/faster color coding and bracket matching for Eclipse, check out the Colorer plugin for Eclipse.<br>
Start here: <a href="http://colorer.sourceforge.net/" title="sourceforge.net">http://colorer.sourceforge.net/</a sourceforge.net><br>
 <br>
EIPC guys: Great work, go on! Maybe you should integrate the above mentioned plugin...<br>
