<p>Those weeks, the perl 5 porters are in maintenance mood. Or in
maintenance mode, if you prefer. Read about the progress made in the
5.8.x and 5.6.x branches.</p>
<p><h2>A strange error case in bleadperl</h2>
<p>Stas Bekman posted a code snippet that produces the fatal error
<em>Modification of a read-only value attempted</em> with bleadperl, but not with
perl versions &lt;= 5.8.1. (Filed as bug #23803.) It can be reduced to<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:</p>
<pre>
    for(&quot;a&quot;) { for $x (1,2) { local $_=&quot;b&quot;; s/(.*)/+$1/ } }</pre>
<p>This was the consequence of a previous bug fix. Rafael explained that in
perl 5.9.0, any attempt at changing the value of a localized readonly
magic scalar will fail with this error. Before, it used to silently do
nothing, and the assignment <code>$_=&quot;b&quot;</code> was a no-op : this could lead to
difficult and well-hidden bugs. In bleadperl, readonlyness of magical
scalars is now preserved when localisation occurs.</p>
<p>But, will you say, where is the magic in the above snippet ? In fact, it
appears that the substitution <code>s/(.*)/+$1/</code> adds some magic to the scalar
stored in <code>$_</code>. This kind of magic is used internally by the regular
expression engine. Thus, one can say that the behaviour reported by Stas
is an unfortunate side-effect of the implementation of regular
expressions.</p>

<h2>Configure and gcc 3.4</h2>
<p>Enache Adrian, watchful on the portability front, forwards a mail from the
gcc development mailing list. A change in gcc's behaviour in the 3.4
development branch leads to breaking perl's <em>Configure</em> script ; more
precisely, it breaks the way <em>Configure</em> tests for the existence of a
function in the standard library.</p>
<p>This was followed by a scary C wizardry thread. Enache provided a fix.</p>

<h2>In Brief</h2>
<p>Jarkko Hietaniemi released several snapshots of perl 5.8.1. The next
release candidate approaches. Extensive tests have been done with mod_perl
1 and 2, and this uncovered several problems, both in mod_perl and in
perl.</p>
<p>Speaking about snapshots, Rafael released one of perl 5.6.2. It's OK on a
large number of platforms ; adjustments are needed on Mac OS X and Cygwin
at least. Rafael incremented the version number, so it reports itself as
being <code>5.6.2</code>.</p>
<p>The bulk of the discussion focused on portability on various platforms --
mainly the non-Unix ones, VMS, OS/2, Windows and Cygwin. Peter Prymmer
reported that perl now looks good on VMS 7.3-1, with no regression test
failing.</p>
<p>Ilya Zakharevich and Yves Orton reported a few bugs in Test::Harness.</p>
<p>Stas Bekman noticed that with perl 5.8.1, if a socket gets closed by the
server while printing to it, the client gets a SIGPIPE. It wasn't
happening in perl 5.8.0 or earlier. (This is considered a feature, not a
bug.)</p>
<p>Michael Schwern released base.pm version 2.03, which fixes an obscure
(and ancient) bug on attribute inheritance, when an intermediate class has
no fields.</p>
