<p>Another week, and its load of patches. A major evolution of the UTF8
implementation, some experimental surgery on the debugger, weak hashes,
strong pack templates, Win32 modules and quite a number of new ideas are
summarized in this week's summary.</p>
<p><h2>The UTF8 patch</h2>
<p>Jarkko Hietaniemi <a href="http://archive.develooper.com/perl5-porters@perl.org/msg90835.html">solved</a> the problems pertaining UTF8 locales that I
summarized last week (see bug #19743). If I understand correctly<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:</p>
<p>The newest version of Encode (1.84, released by Dan Kogai last week)
now reports malformed data read from an UTF8 filehandle.</p>
<p>Moreover, the <strong>-C</strong> command-line switch is now required to enable
UTF8-ification of I/O. It no longer occurs automatically (and silently)
when perl is run under an UTF8 locale. Another way to achieve this is to
set the environment variable PERL_UTF8_LOCALE. (Running smoke tests with
this variable set and with an UTF8 locale would be a good idea.)</p>
<p>(PS: hijacking -C doesn't mean that wide system calls are to be dropped
on Windows. Gurusamy Sarathy said that he'll look at them in the future.)</p>
<p>
<h2>Strange modulus failure</h2>
<p>Abigail's smoke tests on Linux show a <a href="http://archive.develooper.com/perl5-porters@perl.org/msg90917.html">regular failure</a> on a regression test
concerning integer modulus, when perl is compiled with 64 bit capability.
Other people are unable to reproduce it, so we may start to blame the
glibc or something.</p>
<p>
<h2>Debugger performance degradation</h2>
<p>Bug #20218, reported by Dirk Koopman, <a href="http://archive.develooper.com/perl5-porters@perl.org/msg90866.html">demonstrates</a> that the debugger is
ten times slower (under some circumstances) in perl 5.8.0 than in perl
5.6.1.</p>
<p>Jarkko Hietaniemi then <a href="http://archive.develooper.com/perl5-porters@perl.org/msg90985.html">found</a> a single one-line change that is to be blamed
for a large part of this slowdown. The discussion continues...</p>
<p>
<h2>Weak hashes</h2>
<p>Mark Mielke asked for ways to implement <a href="http://archive.develooper.com/perl5-porters@perl.org/msg90773.html">weak hashes</a> in Perl (i.e. hashes
that contain weak references, and from which keys are deleted when the weak
reference is collected.) Several alternatives were proposed.</p>
<p>
<h2>Work on <code>pack()</code> </h2>
<p>Wolfgang Laun <a href="http://archive.develooper.com/perl5-porters@perl.org/msg90819.html">proposed</a> a huge patch to the <code>pack()</code> and <code>unpack()</code> functions,
that fixes a lot of problems. He's still working on it, as it's not
perfect yet. On his to-do list is also defining <em>the syntax for the
template language</em>. We're looking forward for it.</p>
<p>
<h2>In brief</h2>
<p>Rafael Kitover sent a huge set of patches for the libwin32 bundle, a suite
of Windows-specific modules, maintained on CPAN by Gurusamy Sarathy.</p>
<p>Brent Dax proposed to add a new prototype to mimic the <code>delete()</code> built-in
(i.e. define a function that takes an hash/array slice/element as
argument.) Rafael Garcia-Suarez answered that this is possible, but not
trivial.</p>
<p>Paul Marquess says that he's <em>almost finished putting a module together,
called DBM_Filter, that builds on the existing DBM Filter hooks, but makes
it easer to write DBM Filters and to stack multiple filters.</em> This is
intended to allow writing encoding filters for the<nobr> <wbr></nobr><code>.*DBM?_File</code> modules.
He asks whether this module should go in the core. Nobody commented.</p>
<p>The same bug was reported as #20154 and #20357 : a case of coredump caused
by <code>goto()</code> inside a <code>do/while</code> or a <code>for</code> loop.</p>
<p>Nicholas Clark had a <a href="http://archive.develooper.com/perl5-porters@perl.org/msg90802.html">damn good idea</a> about optimizing the entersub op
(executed when a subroutine is called.)</p>
<p>Campo Weijerman remarked that <code>isa()</code> doesn't work on magic variables. This
was promptly fixed.</p>
<p>Ton Hospel continues to report obscure bugs. (bug #20321, <em>indexing the
result of a listcontext match inside a string interpolation looses values</em>.)</p>
<p>Jason Lee notes that <code>%lf</code> is not recognized by perl 5.8.0 in a <code>printf()</code>
format. This is apparently not the right thing. (bug #20339.)</p>
<p>Dave Rolsky asked if it was possible to call perl's regex engine from XS
code. Nick Ing-Simmons provided an answer (and a few hints) : it's indeed
possible, but <em>tricky and risky</em>, as there is no clean external interface
to the regex engine.</p>
<p>Alan Burlison advertised his newest creation, Solaris-PerlGcc (found on
CPAN), that allows to compile modules against the perl shipped with
Solaris, with the gcc compiler.</p>
