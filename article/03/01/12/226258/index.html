Ariel Brosh, one of the members of <a href="http://www.perl.org.il/">Israel.pm</a> has passed away a few month ago. He left behind him a web site which unfortunately off-line already and several CPAN modules.
I volunteered to make sure his CPAN modules will be in good hands and I think the time arrived to publish this.
I have received the access to his CPAN account by the CPAN people so I can let others co-develop his modules.
If you would like to maintain any of his modules please contact me.
</i><p><i>
You can see his modules on <a href="http://www.cpan.org/">CPAN</a> in his
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/author/SCHOP/">author directory</a>.
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/author/SHLOMIF/File-FTS/">File::FTS</a> is already taken."</i></p></p>

<h2>Sad news</h2>

This is sad news. He used to send out a wonderful holiday mailing every year or two... "for the sins of..."<br> <br>What was the cause of death?<br> <br>Is there a memorial website? If not, I'd be glad to host one.

I don't know the cause of his death, I was told he was sick for a long time but I met him only 3 times in the first meetings of Israel.pm
<p>
As far as I know there is no memorial web site and even his original site atheist.org.il went off line as the ISP did not cooperate and noone new his password.
</p><p>
The domain itself is still registered and probably will stay so as it is an old registration when they still gave
registrations without time limit in the<nobr> <wbr></nobr><a href="http://www.isoc.org.il/" title="isoc.org.il">.il TLD</a isoc.org.il>.</p>

If anyone has mirrors of his material, or anything else, I can host them indefinitely on my shmoozenet.com site. I'll see if I can dig up his old emails from '95 and '96.

<h2>Perhaps?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jonasbn/">jonasbn</a> on 2003-01-14T08:42:18</h3>
This XML::Conf things looks interesting, and as far as I can see it lacks both tests and documentation - two things which am fairly good at.<br> <br>Now I just have to find out how to get a CPAN account and I have to find some time...



<h2>His website is archived online</h2>

<h2>Stepping up</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/belg4mit/">belg4mit</a> on 2003-01-14T20:58:15</h3>
I'd be willing to maintain Data::JavaScript.<br>Afterall, it did inspire me to write DataLLJavaScript::LiteObject.

If you don't find a maintainer for <a href="http://search.cpan.org/author/SZABGAB/Net-Whois-Raw-0.22/" title="cpan.org">Net::Whois::Raw</a cpan.org>, I'll take it on, as it has some crossover with my IP::Country modules.
