<div class="span8">
<p>This week, the P5P summary will attempt to entertain you with several low-level hacks. (A weird kind of entertainment if any.) Read about printf(), optimisations, internals, perldoc, and other code stories below.</p>
<p><h2>printf, perlio and XS</h2>
<p>Nick Ing-Simmons changed (or restored, depending on the point of view) the
meaning of <code>printf()</code> in XS code. As of Perl 5.8.0, <code>printf()</code> was
<code>#define</code>'d to be an alias to <code>PerlIO_printf(PerlIO_stdout(),...)</code>. Now,
it will be the bare C-level stdio printf(). Notably, when the standard
output is redirected from a Perl program, and when the perlio layer is
used (e.g. when the PERLIO environment variable has the value <code>perlio</code>),
<code>printf()</code> will continue to write to the pristine stdout stream. Thus, it's
now possible to have access to the perlio and to the stdio implementations
from XS.</p>
<p>This eventually <a href="http://archive.develooper.com/perl5-porters@perl.org/msg91091.html">caused</a> some smoke tests to fail.</p>
<p>
<h2>Modify a subroutine's prototype</h2>
<p>Mark-Jason Dominus wants a way to <a href="http://archive.develooper.com/perl5-porters@perl.org/msg91171.html">modify</a>, at run-time, the prototype of a
subroutine, and explained why (bug #20463). Rafael Garcia-Suarez said that
this doesn't need to be in the core, and proposed a naive Inline::C-based
implementation. However, as MJ wants this feature for Memoize, which is a
core module, it needs to be in the core : perhaps in the Scalar::Util
module ?</p>
<p>
<h2><nobr> <wbr></nobr><code>,=</code> </h2>
<p>Joachim Breitner, wondering how to merge hashes efficiently, proposed to
<a href="http://archive.develooper.com/perl5-porters@perl.org/msg91184.html">introduce</a> a new operator,<nobr> <wbr></nobr><code>,=</code>, so that</p>
<pre>
    %hash1<nobr> <wbr></nobr>,= %hash2;</pre>
<p>would be semantically equivalent to</p>
<pre>
    %hash1 = (%hash1, %hash2);</pre>
<p>but faster (and it would work similary for arrays). Mark-Jason Dominus
pointed out that <code>push()</code> already merges arrays, and that <em>some time ago
there was discussion of extending push to operate on hashes also</em>.</p>
<p>Nicholas Clark objected to this new operator, as efficient merging of
hashes can be done in a XS module ; and he provided this XS module,
<code>Hash::Append</code>. (Though perhaps this code belongs to the core module
<code>Hash::util</code>.) Abigail, on the other hand, approved the creation of a
new operator, but dislikes the odd-looking<nobr> <wbr></nobr><code>,=</code>.</p>
<p>
<h2>In brief</h2>
<p>Dave Mitchell fixed the debugger slowdown noticed last week.</p>
<p>Mark Mielke <a href="http://archive.develooper.com/perl5-porters@perl.org/msg91077.html">noticed</a> that <em>the array of back-references attached to a
reference never shrinks</em>, and he proposed a patch to improve the speed of
the routine that weakens references.</p>
<p>There was a thread about the <a href="http://archive.develooper.com/perl5-porters@perl.org/msg91095.html">different
ways</a> to modify the <code>fileno</code> value
of a <code>FILE</code> C structure on various platforms.</p>
<p>Dan Kogai <a href="http://archive.develooper.com/perl5-porters@perl.org/msg91144.html">released</a> Encode v1.85, and, a few hours later, v1.86. Note that
some tests are skipped on perl 5.8.0, since they rely on newest fixes.</p>
<p>Rafael Garcia-Suarez sent a fix for bug #18232 : the <code>$1</code>...<code>$n</code>
variables loose their utf8 flag when they're overriden by another
pattern match in an enclosed scope.</p>
<p>David Nicol reports (bug #20503) that perldoc produces confused output on
RedHat 8.0. Guess what, that's probably caused by UTF8 locales. Russ
Allbery blames groff. Adrian Enache suggests to pass the option
<code>-Tlatin1</code> to [ng]roff (and to change<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/etc/man.config as well).</p>
<p>Adrian Enache also reports that reading from a filehandle in fixed-length
record mode, and appending the results to a variable, doesn't work correctly
since Perl 5.7.2. He also fixed it.</p>
<p>Alain Barbet posted <a href="http://www.alianwebserver.com/perl/smoke/stats.html">some graphs</a> about the smoke test results.</p>
<p>Sean M. Burke advices Windows users to upgrade their perldoc to the newest
distribution (Pod::Perldoc) he put up on CPAN. The original perldoc
distributed with 5.8.0 apparently has problems with some pagers (e.g.
<tt>more</tt> on some flavours of Windows.)</p>
