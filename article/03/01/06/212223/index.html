<p>What are the perl5-porters' new year resolutions ? You won't learn it by reading this week's highly technical summary. But that's not the point, is      it ?</p>
<p><h2>Copy constructor contract</h2>
<p>Rick Delaney reports (bug #19582) that a copy constructor that doesn't
return a blessed reference may produce segfaults when the resulting
reference is used. As a solution, he proposes to forbid copy constructors to
return non-objects. (Currently, copy constructors can't return
non-references, but can return unblessed references.)</p>
<p> <a href="http://archive.develooper.com/perl5-porters@perl.org/msg90340.html">The bug</a>, and
<a href="http://archive.develooper.com/perl5-porters@perl.org/msg90321.html">the fix</a>.</p>
<p>
<h2>Simple segfault</h2>
<p>Some good bug hunting was done for <a href="http://archive.develooper.com/perl5-porters@perl.org/msg90334.html">bug #19566</a>, a simple case of segfault,
caused by this simple snippet of code (there are many variants)<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:</p>
<pre>
    for (\2) { $_ = &lt;FH&gt; }</pre>
<p>Oddly enough, this bug seems to exist since a long time (5.003_01), but
haven't been fixed.</p>
<p>
<h2>Parens in <code>pack()</code> </h2>
<p>Wolfgang Laun <a href="http://archive.develooper.com/perl5-porters@perl.org/msg90455.html">asked</a> a question about the semantics of parentheses in
<code>pack()</code> templates. Nicholas Clark confessed that <code>'('</code> in pack makes his
head hurt, and frankly, I'm with him on this point. See for yourself<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:</p>
<p>
<h2>Link black magic</h2>
<p>Chip Turner <a href="http://archive.develooper.com/perl5-porters@perl.org/msg90384.html">initiated a thread</a> on shared libperl builds, which I don't
(frankly) want to summarize here. If you're interested in the issues in
packaging, distributing and upgrading binaries of perl, follow the link<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:</p>
<p>
<h2>In brief</h2>
<p>Gisle Aas provided updates for his modules MIME::Base64 and Digest::MD5.</p>
<p>Hugo released a snapshot of bleadperl (the 5.9.0-to be), shortly followed
by Jarkko releasing a snapshot of maintperl (the 5.8.1-to be). Jarkko
released another snapshot at the end of the week before his planned
connectivity problems.</p>
<p>Nicholas Clark proposed a patch to implement copy on write for the $&amp; and
$&lt;DIGIT&gt; variables. As with other copy on write implementations, it's
available only if perl is configured with the -DPERL_COPY_ON_WRITE flag.
However, this patch doesn't seem to be a significant speedup (or
slowdown).</p>
<p>On the performance chapter, Jarkko also sent a patch to speed up Unicode
operations.</p>
<p>Jarkko thrown at us an interesting link : <em>Someone might want to try
Splint at Perl 5 (or Parrot, for that matter) sources.</em>
(see <em> <a href="http://www.splint.org/">http://www.splint.org/</a> </em>).</p>
<p>
<h2>About this summary</h2>
<p>This summary brought to you by Rafael Garcia-Suarez and his hurting brain.
(OK, I was obviously tired this week, I blame this bad cold I got.)
Summaries are available on <em> <a href="http://use.perl.org/">http://use.perl.org/</a> </em> and/or via a mailing
list, which subscription address is <em> <a href="mailto:perl5-summary-subscribe@perl.org">perl5-summary-subscribe@perl.org</a> </em>.
Comments and corrections are welcome.</p></p>
