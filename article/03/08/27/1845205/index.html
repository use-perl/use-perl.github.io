<h2>What about Belfast?</h2>

I wonder if Damian Conway is going to be adding <a href="http://belfast.pm.org/" title="pm.org">Belfast</a pm.org> to his list of tour 'venues'. All those talks sound great, especially OO Perl, regexes and the basic <tt>Parse::RecDescent</tt> one. I still have great memories of his brilliant Perl 6 talk at <a href="http://www.yapc.org/Europe/2002/" title="yapc.org">YAPC::Europe::2002</a yapc.org>. And he even managed to get me interested in quantum theory with <a href="http://search.cpan.org/author/LEMBARK/Quantum-Superpositions-2.02/lib/Quantum/Superpositions.pm" title="cpan.org"> <tt>Quantum::Superpositions</tt> </a cpan.org>.

I did mention the prospect to the good folk at Kasei a few months ago, but haven't heard anything back. Unfortunately, being entirely self-funded nowadays, I can only afford to travel to places where I can also earn my living. And, with only two weeks left before I start this tour, it's probably a little late to include Belfast this time round.

<p>Of course, I <b>am</b> hoping to get back to Belfast for YAPC::EU next year, assuming the scheduling of that conference allows me to fit it into my 2004 itinerary.</p>

Is your <a href="http://damian.conway.org/tshirt.html" title="conway.org">currently published schedule</a conway.org> going to be added to? If you are coming to continental Europe or London, it's not <i>that</i> far to Belfast, and <a href="http://belfast.pm.org/" title="pm.org">Belfast.pm</a pm.org> may even pay for your flight from (London|Amsterdam|somewhere else) to Belfast (provided you fly with a <a href="http://easyjet.com/" title="easyjet.com">cheap airline</a easyjet.com><nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-) ). We did this for <a href="http://pobox.com/user/schwern/" title="pobox.com">Schwern</a pobox.com> AFAIK. I suppose you'd need payment for your hotel room as well, but maybe we could work something out...?

</p><p>Perhaps I've been watching too many cop shows, but that sounded <b>sinister</b> to me.</p>

Sorry, there's no European leg to this trip. I do appreciate the funding ideas and I'm certainly looking forward to getting back to Belfast some time, but it's just not possible this time round.

<h2>Update to schedule</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Damian/">Damian</a> on 2003-08-28T23:56:07</h3>
Unfortunately, due to lack of numbers we have now had to cancel the Chicago leg of the tour. The <a href="http://damian.conway.org/tshirt.html" title="conway.org">t-shirt</a conway.org> has been updated accordingly.

<p>Sincere apologies to those people who did book in for Chicago, and to all the mongers of Chicago.pm whose evening talk I have also had to cancel.

</p><p>Note that, as the t-shirt indicates, we're still planning to run the <a href="http://stemsystems.com/class/" title="stemsystems.com">Boston classes</a stemsystems.com>.</p>
