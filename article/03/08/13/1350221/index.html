I wish I knew.  I couldn't fathom how I did it immediately after I had submitted the review, so I tried to do it again, but failed. However, I do have a theory: it's Graham's fault!<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)  I was using search.cpan.org's "Rate this distribution" link at the time and maybe he was making changes at the same time I was clicking.

<h2>Delete and Rebutal</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ioannis/">ioannis</a> on 2003-08-14T03:23:23</h3>
Besides users being able to change their
ratings, authors should also have the chance
the rebutal their reviewers. Granted, most
reviews are subjective and there is little
need to respond, but when the reviewers are
wrong on facts, or they claim this fuctionality
is missing when it is not, then authors should
be able to respond and not let fud rule the
day. Thus we must allow authors  to respond
to each and every review.

<p>It would be neat if reviews by the author would be marked as such though (provided the author plays fair and uses his/her PAUSE id as login). I just followed a link from a very short review pitching a module just to find out that the review had been written by the module author. Of course (s)he likes the module!</p>

<i>Yes, replication was down. All better now.</i>
<p>
The text is slightly different.  It looks like a separate post to me.
</p><p>
<i>If we see many jokes in reviews, it will make the system worthless.</i>
</p><p>
So, joke modules (Acme::) are ok but not joke reviews?   Please, pudge.  I intentionally picked a well known and well-loved module for this review - I don't plan on making it a habit.  You would have to prove to me that my joke review, which was a 5-star rating btw, would actually prevent someone from using this module - as if they have a choice in the case of DBI anyway.
</p><p>
Two other points.  First, most folks coming to search.cpan (and lets keep in mind that not everyone uses search.cpan) aren't going to bother looking past the rating.  They'll see a 4 or 5 and figure, "must be good".  I agree with petdance - this will mostly be useful for comparing modules that are similar in function and purpose.
</p><p>
Second, this review will eventually be buried in the morass of positive reviews for DBI and a year from now it will be a footnote in the annals of childish moments of djberg96.  Even if they see it, they'll either laugh or just blow it off.  Frankly, if all it takes is one silly review to so egregiously offend the egos of the search.cpan folks as to remove this new toy, the system was doomed from the start.
</p><p>
I'm not going to remove the review - it's a point of pride now.  The review, even if extremely childish, is positive.  If ask wants to forcibly delete it that's his perogative, but that's a slippery slope I think.
</p><p>
What *I* want to know is why a couple of folks gave it a 4 instead of 5!</p>

Replication caught up, and we now see both.<br> <br> <em>So, joke modules (Acme::) are ok but not joke reviews?</em> <br> <br>In the normal module ratings space?  Yes, they are not OK, IMO.

<h2>Minor utility</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/petdance/">petdance</a> on 2003-08-14T14:47:18</h3>
At first I thought it was a swell idea, but now I'm wondering what purpose it's going to serve for most modules.  What if DBI gets a lot of bad reviews?  Does that mean people aren't going to use DBI?  What other choice do they have?
<p>
Ratings are good comparing apples to apples, but I see CPAN as a whole lot of entirely dissimilar singleton fruit.  Maybe in some cases like TT vs. Mason, the reviews might be helpful, but in most others, I just don't see it.</p>



<blockquote>

<h2>Re:Minor utility</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/perrin/">perrin</a> on 2003-08-14T16:55:12</h3>
As I see it, it will help people find the modules that are most widely considered good and useful.  Some people don't know that DBI is good, or that TT and Mason are worth checking out.  Those people would be helped by a list of the most popular modules that they could poke thorugh, instead of searching for "database" or "template" and getting back a million hits.



<h2>Re:Minor utility</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/educated_foo/">educated_foo</a> on 2003-08-14T18:59:35</h3>
Much more useful IMHO than reviews would be some sort of user-supplied classification system, or "see also" links with brief commentary.  That way, the first module I find to do X can have pointers to other X-doing modules with helpful comments like "X::Simple will probably do what you need if..."
<p>The problem with CPAN isn't figuring out what sucks (just look at documentation quality and version number), but figuring out what clever name someone has given the module you want.

<h3><a href="/user/SuperCruncher/">SuperCruncher</a> on 2003-08-14T19:36:09</h3>
At Elaine's talk at YAPC::Europe this year, the impression I got was that she was not at all keen on CPAN reviews and ratings as they'd end up like a lot of the reviews on Amazon and other similar sites. So this seems to be a slight u-turn? <p>During the ratings/reviews part of her talk, I was thinking of asking a question, because after YAPC::Europe::2001 in Amsterdam I was very excited about the whole idea of ratings for modules. I think <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/schwern" title="perl.org">Schwern</a perl.org> did a talk about it. Schwern's idea (I think) was to have more of a rating / reputation / score type system, almost a combination of <a href="http://slashdot.org/faq/com-mod.shtml#cm600" title="slashdot.org">Slashdot's moderation system</a slashdot.org> and <a href="http://perlmonks.org/index.pl?node=Voting%2FExperience%20System" title="perlmonks.org">Perlmonk's  voting/experience system</a perlmonks.org>. I find the idea of group moderation systems really fascinating, and I think it could work well for CPAN. There are, of course, a few issues to be resolved, mainly:
</p><ul>
 <li> <b>Popularity should not be a measure of quality</b>: a popular module like <tt>LWP</tt> shouldn't be able to get a better 'quality' rating than <tt>Obscure::Module</tt> just because it has more users. I think using a statistic like number of downloads or views is a better guide to a module's popularity.</li>
 <li> <b>Criteria</b>: multiple or single criteria? Should the module be given an overall rating, or ratings for (e.g.) portability, code quality, documentation quality and so on? I don't know.</li>
</ul>
Anyway, this is a good first step. I would like to see it integrated within the search results though too.

&gt; she was not at all keen on CPAN reviews and ratings as they'd end up like a lot of the reviews on Amazon and other similar sites. So this seems to be a slight u-turn?<br> <br>Ask and Elaine are not the same person even though they both like stylish eyeglassware<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br>

<p>You're right, I'm not that keen on the idea. Also, CPANTS and what Schwern was talking about [ though I wasn't there...] is a far more objective sort of QC/QA than a bunch of random people with an axe to grind or authors faffing their own modules. Writing thoughtful and articulate reviews takes a lot of time to write and will generally be the exception in a sea of not terribly useful reviews...much like Amazon.</p>

<p>This has been done before and it failed shortly thereafter. I just don't see a lot of value in the exercise as there will be a lot of unrated modules and a lot of unfairly rated modules. I'd rather have authors get objective feedback from a CPANTS QA review than 20 little geekboys pulling a 'me too this module sucks' review on modules. It has a real potential to send a lot of people who aren't part of the cult of personality off to somewhere else...like Ruby.</p>

<h2>RSS for recent reviews?</h2>

Is there an RSS feed for 'recent reviews' (ie: the home page)?  That would be handy.
