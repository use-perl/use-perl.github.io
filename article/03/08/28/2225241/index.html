applications running on the World Wide Web.

It's on the provided list of new words, roughly between "PDF" and "personal video recorder."

On re-reading the article, it was mentioned that the fact this would happen has been known for a while now, but it wouldn't hurt to cite an reference from then, would it?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-) According to the <a href="http://history.perl.org/PerlTimeline.html" title="perl.org">Perl Timeline</a perl.org>:
<blockquote><div> <p> <i>The Oxford English Dictionary investigates the origin of the word "Perl" while considering it for an entry in the next edition. Perl will be included and the entry will resemble the entry below.</i> </p> <blockquote><div> <p><tt>Perl Brit.
<br>Perl, perl, irreg. PERL
<br>Computing.
</tt></p><p><tt>perl n. ,
<br>arbitrarily chosen for its positive connotations, with omission of
-a- to differentiate it from an existing programming language called
Pearl. Coined by Larry Wall in the summer of 1987; the program was
publicly released on 18 December of that year. Acronymic expansions of
the name (such as Practical Extraction and Report Language and
Pathologically Eclectic Rubbish Lister), though found in the earliest
documention for the language, were formed after the name had been
chosen. Coinage details confirmed by personal communication from L.
Wall, May 2000. A high-level interpreted programming language widely
used for a variety of tasks and especially for applications running
on the World Wide Web. The form Perl is preferred for the language
itself; perl is used for the interpreter for the Perl language.

Note the article distinguishes that it was recently PUBLISHED.  It was added to what was to be published some time ago, and now, it has been published.

From the linked article:
<blockquote><div>The apostrophe is disappearing from where you would expect to see it (e.g. LETS GO) and is appearing elsewhere (as in the plural PEAR'S).</div></blockquote>
<p> <i>Nooooooooo!</i> </p>
<p>While I can respect that the duty of the OED is to reflect trends in the language -- rather than try to set them, like the French Academy ["Academe Francais"? sp?] does -- but it really bothers me that this usage is being blessed by the OED.
</p><p>Every time I see a word like "pear's", it leaves me wondering -- "the pear's <i>what</i>?" Dangling possessives seem worse than dangling participles. Yuck<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-(
</p><p>And then there's this list:
</p><blockquote><div>Of course, only a small percentage of these make it into the dictionary; our strict rules for inclusion ensure that only the most important words are selected, while the more ephemeral and poorly evidenced words are put on the back burner. Those that have passed the test include CYBERSLACKER, FATOUSH, BLAMESTORMING, SARS, CANTOPOP, BUPKIS, NOUGHTIES, MUGGLE, and ROBATA.</div></blockquote>
<p>This reads like one of those lists of pseudo-terms that used to [still does?] appear in magazines like Wired: look how cool &amp; hip we are, we're making up shit now. I mean really, Cyberslacker? Sheesh, lord what fools these muggles be<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
</p><p>Man. I think the OED just JUMPED THE SHARK.
</p><p>(In any case though, I, err, don't actually see the word "perl" on that linked press release. Wrong url maybe? It looks like the full list of new words is available as <a href="http://www.askoxford.com/pressroom/archive/odenewwords" title="askoxford.com">a 69 page PDF file</a askoxford.com> -- which is, in a way, recursive when you think about it<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

Well, some of those words are legit.  Cantopop at least, can be used for sentences like "Faye Wong is the undisputed queen of Cantopop, and anyone who thinks otherwise is a big fat idiot."  A sentence, which is not only grammatically correct, but also factually correct.<br> <br>Cyberslackers, OTOH, is just lame.

The Collins English Dictionary -- the one used by many UK government departments for official definitions of things -- has had this since 1998. My minor claim to fame is that I "got Perl in the dictionary" back in 1998. Google for "group:comp.lang.perl.misc author:stewart@ref.collins.co.uk". 'Tis I, and I have the e-mail from Tom C to prove it.

<p>Yeah, and we used Perl too. As do most dictionary publishers.

<h2>&quot;Perl&quot; NOT added to OED</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jest/">jest</a> on 2003-09-02T14:07:00</h3>
<p>Let me clarify what is probably the most important thing about this press release, which
is that it is <i>not</i> about the <a href="http://www.oed.com/" title="oed.com">Oxford English Dictionary</a oed.com>, but rather about the <i>Oxford Dictionary of English</i>, a different work.</p>

<p>As discussed elsewhere in this thread, there has been an entry drafted for <i>Perl</i> for the OED for some time, and it will probably be published later this year. As of this moment however <i>Perl</i> is <i>not</i> in the OED.</p>

<p>I have nothing to do with the <i>Oxford Dictionary of English</i>, so I can't address any issues about this work, such as the relative merits of <i>cyberslacking</i>.</p>

Thanks so much for the correction.  We were all quite worried that the OED had lost is head.  Phew.  Now I have something new to hate: the ODE.

<h2>Added to the *OED*</h2>

See <a href="http://use.perl.org/article.pl?sid=03/12/15/0326207" title="perl.org">later article</a perl.org> where it has been officially added to the OED.
