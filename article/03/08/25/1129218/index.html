<p>The Perl 5 porters are rather focused on perl 5.8.1 tuning and
adjustments. Smokes, valgrind checks, modules updates, and regression bug
hunting were among the main events of the week.</p>
<p><h2> <a name="destroying_blessed_code_refs">DESTROYing blessed code refs</a> </h2>
<p>Last year, Simon Cozens found that blessed code references weren't
DESTROYed properly (bug #10030).  Dave Mitchell looked at it, and
diagnosed that it's caused by the fact that the blessed anonymous
subroutine is not a closure (usually) -- and indeed, turning it into a
closure fixes the behaviour of the destructor. Dave thinks that this bug
would be inefficient to fix, and suggests to document it as a misfeature.</p>
<p>Later in the thread, the proper meaning of the <em>closure</em> word is discussed.</p>

<h2> <a name="more_valgrinding">More valgrinding</a> </h2>
<p>Last week, Jarkko Hietaniemi added to the test harness the possibility to
run the test suite under valgrind. This week, helped by Marcus
Holland-Moritz and other members of the crowd, he slightly tweaked
valgrind's setup to produce more useful and accurate reports. Some
interesting bugs are shaked out.</p>

<p>
<h2> <a name="localization_of_$|">Localization of <code>$|</code> </a> </h2>
<p>Stas Bekman found a new bug in the localization of the <code>$|</code> variable.
This bug wasn't present in perl 5.8.0, and causes significant problems
with mod_perl 2. Dave Mitchell identified himself as the guilty patcher,
explained the problem, and provided a better version of his original
patch.</p>

    <a href="http://xrl.us/qr7">http://xrl.us/qr7</a> </pre>
<p>
<h2> <a name="in_brief">In Brief</a> </h2>
<p>Jari Aalto wishes that here-documents could be declared with the quote
operators syntax, as in : <code>&lt;&lt;q(FOO)</code>, <code>&lt;&lt;qq(BAR)</code>, etc. (bug
#23348). This doesn't seem to be unreasonable.</p>
<p>Tassilo von Parseval added to Devel::PPPort, the backward compatibility
wrapper for XS code, some adapters for the <code>grok_*</code> functions, that
convert strings to numbers. (See a recent <em>perlapi</em> manpage for the
description of those functions.)</p>
<p>Enache Adrian fixed the handling of utf-8 strings in error messages.</p>
<p>Richard Dawe provided a portability patch for perl 5.6.2 on DJGPP. Philip
Newton is testing perl 5.8.1 on DJGPP as well.</p>
<p>Michael G Schwern cleaned up a bit Pod::Html.</p>
<p>
<h2> <a name="smoke_news">Smoke news</a> </h2>
<p>Alain (alian) Barbet was busy on the portability front. He found out that
some <code>pack()</code> tests fails on NetBSD/sparc, compiled with gcc 2.x. This is
apparently due (after investigating with Nicholas Clark) to a bug in
<code>**</code>. (bug #23463).</p>
<p>Alain also released a new version of his Test-Smoke-Database distribution
on CPAN, a software that presents and summarizes smoke results via a web
interface.</p>
<p>Abigail started to produce smoke results for perl 5.6.2. One of the tests
for <code>int()</code> fails when perl 5.6.2 is compiled with 64 bit arithmetic, due to
a transitional known bug in his version of glibc. (A workaround for
this bug was put in perl 5.8.0.)</p>
<p>
<h2> <a name="module_news">Module news</a> </h2>
<p>Dan Kogai released Encode 1.98. Michael Schwern released
ExtUtils::MakeMaker 6.16. And I see on CPAN that CGI.pm 3.00 is out.</p>
<p>Moreover, Ken Williams proposed to backport Cwd to CPAN, with the recent
tainting fixes in it.</p>
