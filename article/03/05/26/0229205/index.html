<h2>mismatched RSS info</h2>

I downloaded a copy of the perl.datetime RSS feed, and for my next few comments I'm assuming that its representative of most of the feeds.<br> <br>The first thing I noticed is that the feeds are served as application/rdf+xml, but Mozilla asked me to download them, rather then display them as XML.<br> <br>The next thing I noticed is that these are very unusual looking RSS feeds.<br> <br>They look like they are essentially old style RSS 0.9 feeds (declare the RDF namespace, and My Netcenter namespaces, no modules, limited tagset) but they also include a sprinkling of tags from the non-RDF, Userland flavors of RSS, namely the tags: pubDate, webMaster, language, ttl, and guid. These tags don't exist in RSS 0.9, and go by different names in RSS 1.0, e.g. dc:date, dc:language, dc:publisher (or perhaps admin:errorReportsTo), etc.<br> <br>Also missing are the textfield, and image tags which are required by RSS 0.9, but later made optional by all other versions.<br> <br>Most aggregators will probably display at least something passable given these feeds, but it is a little inelegant to mix the specs like this.  It would probably make sense to either: rename the Userland fields to their equivalent RSS 1.0 fields and change the default namespace to http://purl.org/rss/1.0/, or to strip out all the references to RDF and present it as a RSS 2.0 feed.<br> <br>Thanks again for making the feeds available.

It looks odd to me, too.  However, the <a href="http://feeds.archive.org/validator/check?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnntp.x.perl.org%2Frss%2Fperl.macosx.rdf" title="archive.org">RSS Validator</a archive.org> says it is OK.  It looks most like the mythical "RSS 2.0" to me, with the guid, but I couldn't tell you.

<p>Hmmm, it does look like a really mixed up feed to me... RSS 0.9 namespace, loads of Dave Winer style elements.... since it's a Perl site why are they not using <a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?query=XML::RSS" title="cpan.org">XML::RSS</a cpan.org>!?</p>

<i>The first thing I noticed is that the feeds are served as application/rdf+xml, but Mozilla asked me to download them, rather then display them as XML.</i>
<p>
Obviously, the same issue exists with Netscape 7. And I also noticed the "mix-and-match" approach. Probably would be prudent to pick one standard &amp; stick with it...

That said, THANKS for all the newsfeeds!</p>

<p>The <a href="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/spec#s5" title="purl.org">RSS 1.0 spec</a purl.org> says that application/xml should be used till the RSS mime type is registered, howver loads of people are using the aplication/rss+xml mime type already to aid resource discovery... but I also find the fact that it wont open in mozilla really annoying so I'm still using application/xml<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...</p>
