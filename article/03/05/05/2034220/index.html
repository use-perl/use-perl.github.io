<h1>This Week on perl5-porters (28 April / 4 May 2003)</h1>

<p>This week summary doesn't feature very exceptional bug fixes, or utterly important information, or pearls of the most pleasant sense of humor of         the perl5-porters. Does this mean that it's completely non-interesting ?
Read it and judge by yourself : shortcuts, ACLs, meta-information, and a
couple of cows.</p>
<p><h2>Windows shortcuts</h2>
<p>Last week, Edward Peschko started a discussion about adding support for
Windows shortcuts (<em>.lnk</em> files) in the perl core. He asked whether the
<code>lib</code> pragma could be modified to support the syntax</p>
<pre>
    use lib &quot;shortcut.lnk&quot;;</pre>
<p>Several approaches were suggested : modifying <code>readlink()</code> on Windows, to
handle shortcuts, or have a Windows-specific module that redefines
CORE::readlink(). Several people noted that a shortcut is not the same
thing at all than a symlink, and thus that perl should not cheat about
<code>readlink()</code> and paths involving symlinks.</p>

<p>
<h2>ACL support, and the filetest pragma</h2>
<p>Stas Bekman remarks that some OSes use ACL (Access Control List) -based
file access controls. He asks whether perl could use internally the
equivalent of</p>
<pre>
    POSIX::access($file, &amp;POSIX::X_OK())</pre>
<p>instead of <code>-x $file</code>, where <code>access(2)</code> is supported.</p>
<p>Mark Mielke points out that the filetest operators are not (in the general
case) equivalent to the <code>access(2)</code> mechanism, due to a possible difference
between the effective user id and the real user id. And backward
compatibility should be preserved. Jarkko Hietaniemi recalls that the
<code>filetest</code> pragma should be used modify to the semantics of filetests.</p>
<pre>
    <a href="http://xrl.us/hi7">http://xrl.us/hi7</a> </pre>
<p>Later, Slaven Rezic asks whether <code>filetest</code> works at all. This pragma is
supposed to be lexically-scoped, like <code>strict</code>. It is not, because it
tests the compiler hints at run-time, but they are only relevant at
compile time. This was fixed by Jarkko and Slaven.</p>
<p>
<h2>Cows</h2>
<p>Aaron Sherman asked about copy-on-write : how it's supported, and whether
it's going to become the default. (Reminder : perl can be compiled with
the <code>-DPERL_COPY_ON_WRITE</code> cc flag, which enables copying string values only
when they're changed.) He's looking for ways to improve the performance of
SpamAssassin, a tool that processes lots of strings if any, and apparently
tries to implement a module to provide COW-enabled magic scalars. Nicholas
Clark summarized the state of the copy-on-write feature : <em>the good news:
I can't measure any slowdown. The bad news: I can't measure any speedup.</em> </p>

<h2>Meta-information in CPAN packages</h2>
<p>Autrijus Tang posted a detailed proposal about the inclusion of a standard
<em>META.yml</em> file in CPAN distributions, and the inclusion therein of some
meta-information that could be used by the CPAN indexer, to prevent some
files or directories from being indexed. Ken Williams noted that
Module::Build was already able to generate a <em>META.yml</em> file. Autrijus'
proposal was extensively discussed in a long thread<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:</p>

<p>
<h2> <code>$VERSION</code> </h2>
<p>John Peacock is apparently about to post a patch that makes the $VERSION
variable magical, so that it automagically turns version-like scalars
assigned to it into version objects.</p>
<p>Matthew O. Persico asks about the possibility to backport John's changes
via a CPAN module.</p>

<h2>In brief</h2>
<p>Casey West continued to send doc patches and to close doc bugs. And
indeed, due to general effort, a lot of bugs were closed. By the way,
Robert Spier is organizing the PerlBugAthon, aimed at closing as many
perlbugs as possible, during OSCON 2003's Hackathon.</p>

    <a href="http://www.perl.org/oscon/2003/perlbugathon/">http://www.perl.org/oscon/2003/perlbugathon/</a> </pre>
<p>Gurusamy Sarathy warns that there are probably cases of non-thread-safety
in perl 5.8.0, because some global variables have gone into <em>perlvars.h</em>,
instead of being put into <em>intrpvars.h</em>. Sorting them out is needed.</p>
<pre>
    <a href="http://xrl.us/hjb">http://xrl.us/hjb</a> </pre>
<p>Rafael Garcia-Suarez provided a patch to get bleadperl working on SCO
OpenUNIX 8.</p>
<p>Tye McQueen proposed a simple patch to fix a bug in hash bucket assignment
(the number of buckets not growing in some pathological cases).</p>
<p>Richard Clamp posted a quick-fix patch to get perl 5.005_03 to compile on
newer Linux distributions.</p>
<pre>
    <a href="http://xrl.us/hjc">http://xrl.us/hjc</a> (long)</pre>
<p>Brent Dax asked why regex-heredocs aren't allowed (something like <code>$string =~ &lt;&lt;/FOO/</code>). Perhaps because they're not really needed.</p>
