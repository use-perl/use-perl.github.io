<p>Summary of this week's summary : scoops about RedHat 9 - the possible future of CPAN packaging - some overloading - old and new error messages -      Windows killing - and other interesting stuff.</p>
<p><h3>MakeMaker and RedHat 9</h3>
<p>Michael G Schwern currently gets a load of bug reports about MakeMaker not
working on RedHat 9. This is because RedHat 9 ships with a snapshot of the
maintenance branch of perl, which corrects some of the UTF8-related bugs,
but unfortunately one of the remaining bugs <em>seems to bite MakeMaker
especially bad</em>, as says Jarkko.</p>
<p>The workaround is to set the environment variable <code>LANG</code> to <code>C</code> before
building a module.</p>

<h3>External dependencies of CPAN distributions</h3>
<p>Stas Bekman initiated another of those long, difficult-to-summarize
(but-nevertheless-interesting) threads about possible enhancements to the
way to build, distribute, install and upgrade modules. This time Stas
tells us about the problem of incompatible upgrades, that occurs when a
package Foo goes from version 1.XX to 2.00, with incompatible API changes,
and thus being not suitable for upgrade for all users. (A good example
would be mod_perl 1.XX vs. mod_perl 2.0.)</p>
<p>Andreas Koenig says that this problem can't be solved without a major
redesign of the indexing process, but that bundles can be used to solve
this class of problems.</p>
<p>Ken Williams provided some insight about what kind of metadata about
external dependencies could be embedded in distributions.</p>
<p>Autrijus Tang and Brian Ingerson give some interesting spoilers about the
soon-to-be-released <code>Module::Install</code> framework. Or should I say virus ?</p>

<h3>CORE::readline() calls overloaded &lt;&gt;</h3>
<p>Christian Jaeger reported (bug #22042) that, when the &lt;&gt; operator has been
overloaded for a class Foo, calling CORE::readline() on a object of this
class calls the overloaded function. Rafael Garcia-Suarez showed that a
similar behavior occurs for int(), and explained why he thinks it's not a
bug.</p>

<h3>Destruction uses too much memory</h3>
<p>Ton Hospel produced a core dump (bug #22095) by building a large double
linked list and destroying it. This is due to a hard stack overflow. Ton
suggested that there's some recursion occurring during refcount decrement
inside the perl interpreter, and that (1) replacing the recursion by an
iterative algorithm would be a gain, (2) that each step of recursion uses
probably too much memory. As said Arthur, patches are welcome.</p>

<h3>Making tests run anywhere</h3>
<p>The test suite for perl currently modifies @INC to be sure to always
include the modules from the perl being built. Ilya Zakharevich proposed
to make this behavior dependent on a <code>NO_PERL_CORE</code> environment variable.
The goal is to be able to run the test suite against an installed perl,
and optionally to unbundle the test suite. Rafael recalls that <em>t/TEST</em>
already includes support to run the test suite using an arbitrary perl
interpreter, via the <code>PERL</code> environment variable.</p>

<h3>Old bugs, new fixes</h3>
<p>Casey West continues his journey through the bug database, fixing
documentation as he finds doc bugs. He's not the only one that visits
perlbug : Dave Mitchell, for example, reduced old bug #3420 to the amusing
snippet</p>
<pre>
    $ perl -Te '@{%h}{x}'
    Bizarre copy of HASH in leave at -e line 1.</pre>
<p>and explained what happens here, but he doesn't know how to fix it.</p>
<p>
<h3>Error messages, added and removed</h3>
<p>Yitzchak Scott-Thoennes added a new fatal error (and fixed bug #17718 by
doing so)<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:</p>
<pre>
    Can't provide tied hash usage; use keys(%hash) to test if empty</pre>
<p>And here's the explanation : you probably know that a hash, evaluated in
scalar context, provides bucket usage<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:</p>
<pre>
    $ perl -le '%h=(1..6);print scalar %h'
    3/8</pre>
<p>As an empty hash returns <code>0</code> here, this can be used to test hashes for
emptiness. But this operation can't be done on tied hashes, and returned
until now unreliable data. Thus, tied hashes are no more allowed in scalar
context. This modification will probably be part of perl 5.8.1 as well.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Rafael removed two unnecessary error messages : <code>Final @
should be \@ or @name</code> and <code>Final % should be \% or %name</code>. (The second
one wasn't even documented in the perldiag manpage.)</p>
<p>In warnings land : Dave Mitchell proposed to add the name of the offending
variable to the well-known <em>use of undefined value</em> warning (when
possible and reasonably easy).</p>
<p>
<h3>Killing processes on Windows</h3>
<p>Daniel Berger proposed an alternative implementation of <code>kill()</code> on Win32
systems. Gurusamy Sarathy and Jan Dubois provided some insightful
comments.</p>
