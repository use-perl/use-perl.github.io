Brought a good chuckle to my hump-day morning. Thanks.

<h2>Perl 6 Essentials?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/mshiltonj/">mshiltonj</a> on 2003-05-21T17:15:02</h3>
Has anyone seen the content? Is it more than a compilation of the Apocalypse and Exegesis articles?

<h2>Funny you should ask this</h2>

Apparently <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/wickline/journal/12333" title="perl.org">there's</a perl.org> quite some Parrot content.

<h2>Re:Funny you should ask this</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Elian/">Elian</a> on 2003-05-22T16:27:41</h3>
Quite a bit--the last two chapters are on Parrot, one on the architecture, and another on practical programming in parrot assembly. I'm not sure what the final page count for the parrot stuff is, but it is (IIRC) in excess of 50 pages.

<p>
I was a tech. editor.  I can say that it is in no way a compilation of Apocalypses and Exegeses, but a highly distilled summary of current Perl 6 thought.
</p>
<p>
I once sat through what ended up being half of what would've been a day-long lecture on the structure of Perl 6, by Damian.  To me, the first half of this book had the feel of that talk.  The second half of the book had the feel of a Parrot talk by Dan.

<h2>Concur (mostly) with the Google Hacks review</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Fletch/">Fletch</a> on 2003-05-21T18:18:18</h3>
<p>
I got some useful information out of it, but there were a couple of nits:
</p>
<ul>
<li>what seemed to be <em>lots</em> of repetition in some of the hacks (after the 8th time reading that it's against Google's TOS to screen scrape it eventually sunk in, the other 27 times aren't necessary); granted the hacks are meant to be more self contained, just say it once at the beginning of the chapter
</li>
<li>the multi-colour typesetting seemed off, at least in my copy (like things weren't registered right; more of a distraction)
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Other than a couple of other trivial typos, it's well worth the 18$US I found it on special for.
