<p><a href="http://southflorida.pm.org/meetings/">jbisbee</a> writes <i>"There is a planned YAPC event (the evening of June 17th) to attend a group screening of The Matrix Reloaded at the <a href="http://www.muvico.com/main/muvico_palace.htm">Boca Raton Muvico</a>.  We plan to rent a 100-seat theater for conference attendees, but this requires an extra $600 not in the conference budget.  Tickets are normally $8.50 apiece.  We currently have $175 in pledges (thank you!) toward the $600 needed to sponsor the event.  A new contribution category has been created at donate.perl-foundation.org called <a href="http://donate.perl-foundation.org/index.pl?node=Contribution%20Info&amp;selfund=6">YAPC Donations</a> to help make up the difference.  So anyone attending this years YAPC in Boca, throw some money into the pot, even if its just $6 to cover your discounted seat."</i></p>

... if there are also Perl credits in Reloaded. Just read about the nmap and (negative<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) ssh credits. Or what's the reason for seeing Reloaded at a YAPC?<br>

Perhaps, who knows.<br/><br/>As for the reasons, it's a geek movie. What better reason is needed?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)

not really perl related but in <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0107290" title="imdb.com">Jurassic Park</a imdb.com>, the <i>System</i> is Unix based. Near the end of the movie, when Raptors try to get into the control room, Sam Neill and Laura Dern hold the door. The little girl (earlier being teased for being a <i>Nerd</i>, she replied she was a <i>Hacker</i>), says that the system is Unix based and she knows it. She apparently browses around the files with a 3D GUI. This all appears to be part of IRIX, where <a href="http://www.sgi.com/fun/freeware/3d_navigator.html" title="sgi.com">fsn</a sgi.com> is shown (the website even has a <i>As shown in Jurassic Park</i> caption). Other scenes show windows more resembling an Apple GUI (the part where the sysadmin calls to keep the boat from leaving, you see a video feed window).

1) It's a geeky movie, and it's fun to see geeky movies with a bunch of geeks.
<p>
2) The Matrix was playing at the Beehive in Pittsburgh during YAPC 99.  It was kinda fun to rip that movie apart with 100 of your closest friends in the audience (and virtually no one else in the theater to complain)</p>

<p>Well, have a look at the summer schedule for movies and the summer sequel suckfest will become quite apparent. Most movies will suck more than this one and at least it has nice looking people to gape at. A bunch of us went to see Austin Powers last year at TPC which was a lot of fun. Have a beer or two and sit somewhere near Dan and Chip then heckle the hell out of the Jesuit cum Aquinas imposter whose plot reads like a bad interpretation of the Summa. I'm getting really bored with preachy sci-fi movies and heckling them helps. More beer afterwards while listening to Chip whip off quotes from the entire movie will make you wonder if he's real or some kind of AI quotebot.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<p>No perl in this movie but there have been a number of others like "Sphere" and books like the Cryptonomicon.</p>
