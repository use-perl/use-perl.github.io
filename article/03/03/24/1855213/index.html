<h1>RT 3.0 Released</h1>

<div class="span8">
<p><a href="mailto:jesse+useperl@bestpractical.com">jesse</a> writes <i>"It gives me great pleasure to announce the immediate availability of
RT 3.0.0.  This release represents over a year of work extending and
enhancing RT 2.0 by Best Practical staff and volunteers.  You can download this release at:
	<a href="http://bestpractical.com/pub/rt/release/rt-3-0-0.tar.gz">http://bestpractical.com/pub/rt/release/rt-3-0-0.tar.gz</a><br/><br/>"</i></p>
<p>This is a significant new release with major new features, including:
<ul>
	<li> The new web interface is prettier, easier to use and also
	  more standards compliant.</li>

	<li> RT now includes a flexible &quot;approvals&quot; system that lets you
	  define site-specific policies to require approval before certain
	  classes of ticket can be resolved.</li>

	<li> The mail gateway has been rebuilt to use an RPC mechanism to
          talk to your RT server, rather than needing to run setgid on
	  your RT server.</li>
	<li> Groups and access control have been completely reworked.</li>

	<li> Group membership is now recursive, so you can create groups
	  which contain other groups.</li>

	<li> The installation process has been overhauled. Autoconf
	  (./configure) make installation easier than ever before.</li>

	<li> Users can now delegate their rights to other users.</li>

	<li> Full &quot;custom field&quot; support has replaced RT 2.0's &quot;keywords&quot;.</li>

	<li>  Custom fields can now contain arbitrary text, as well as
	  &quot;Select from list&quot;.</li>

	<li> RT now stores all data as Unicode internally, so it's much
	  easier to work with multiple languages.</li>

	<li> RT's core and web interface has been fully internationalized.
	  RT now speaks: English, French, German, Spanish, Portuguese,
	  Dutch, Finnish, Czech, Russian, Japanese, Traditional Chinese,
	  and Simplified Chinese.</li>

	<li> RT even easier to extend than ever before: The API is much
	  better documented, the web interface includes a new &quot;Callbacks&quot;
	  mechanism to let you embed your own components without touching
	  a line of RT's source code. The core libraries include a new
	  &quot;Overlay&quot; system to let you override RT's core functionality
	  at the subroutine level.</li>

	<li> The 'scrips' system is even more powerful. Now administrators
	  can create custom scrips right from RT's web interface.</li>

	<li> RT 3.0 is much better tested than any previous release of RT.
	  Each release must pass a suite of over 750 tests before being
	  released to the public.</li>

	<li> There's a full manual (currently available in draft form at
	  <a href="http://bestpractical.com/rt/docs.html">http://bestpractical.com/rt/docs.html</a>)</li>

	<li> And, of course, there's lots more.</li>
</ul>
<p>
A beta-quality tool to import data from an RT 2.0 instance into
fresh RT instance is available at:
<br>
	<a href="http://bestpractical.com/pub/rt/devel/rt2-to-rt3-v1.6.tar.gz">http://bestpractical.com/pub/rt/devel/rt2-to-rt3-v1.6.tar.gz</a>

</p><p>More comprehensive versions of this import tool will become available in
the coming weeks.</p></p>

<h2>Very cool!</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ask/">ask</a> on 2003-03-28T23:10:19</h3>
<br>Congratulations Jesse.  You know that we use RT for tracking todos, inquiries, bugs and more at perl.org.  It's so very cool.  Managing the perl.org infrastructure that Robert and I take care of would be next to impossible without RT.<br> <br>I'm very much looking forward to Robert upgrading our RT.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br> <br>

<h2>RT = Request Tracker   (?)</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/mw487/">mw487</a> on 2003-03-31T16:57:23</h3>
Don't you hate it when you see a long post about something, and they use so many acronyms that you can not for the life of you figure out what they are saying?

<p>

Is it fair to say that RT == "Request Tracker"  ?

</p><p>
Bye!</p>
