With most of the presentations being Hebrew I guess you don't expect many participants from outside Israel!<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br> <br>

Since (almost) all responses were from Israel (proposal and participation) and in order to attract a lot of local people Hebrew is one of the possible languages for presentations. If we get enough demand from people from abroad an English speaking track can be arranged.<br> <br>The orginizers will be very happy to welcome any participant from abroad.

<p>Man, now I want to go!  I've been wanting to learn Hebrew for years!</p>

Well, originally we though there is not much chance that a lot of (non-hebrew speaking) people will come to Israel for a one-day conference. We did not even expect proposals from abroad but it turned out that at least 2 are from aborad.
<p>
As Shlomo Yona also wrote in his response we would be happy to see more non-Hebrew speaking people comming from abroad. We'll try to make a track
with only English presentations.
</p><p>
Besides, some people might want to attend
<a href="http://www.pti.co.il/mjd.pasp" title="pti.co.il">the MJD course</a pti.co.il> which will be in English and will drop by to the YAPC for a chat with fellow Mongers in Israel.</p>

<h2>Silly question</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/djberg96/">djberg96</a> on 2003-03-06T19:03:46</h3>
Is Israel home to any species of Praying Mantis?  What's the origin of that flag?

According to the supplier of the image, Gabor Szabo, "its Hebrew name is 'Gamal Shlomo' which in turn can be translated word-by-word to English as 'The Camel of Shlomo'". Though I like the idea of it being Zorak.

And (Melech) Shlomo in turn is the hebrew name of
"King Solomon"
<p>
But who is Zorak ?
Ohh I Googled for it:
