I hate to say it, but after an unimpressive season and a half of Enterprise, closure might not be such a bad thing.

<h2>What's wrong with copying from sh?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/SuperCruncher/">SuperCruncher</a> on 2003-03-13T00:34:48</h3>
<i>"Yeah, but sh influenced the design of Perl, too"</i> <p>
Is the fact that bits of Ruby (and even *gasp* Python) are being copied or being using to influence Perl 6's design a bad thing? No. Is it surprising? No. Larry Wall has freely admitted that in designing Perl, he took the bits he liked most from other languages, and in most cases vastly improved them.</p><p>

I would think that Python and Ruby should be <b>glad</b> that we're copying some of their features. Inevitably, we'll improve them in ways they could never imagine and they'll then be "back ported" to Python or Ruby<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-) And I'm not a Python fan, but there are bits of the language I like - so why not use them?</p><p>

As a little slightly offtopic aside, I feel obliged to mention a comment made by <a href="http://pobox.com/user/schwern/" title="pobox.com">Schwern</a pobox.com> at <a href="http://belfast.pm.org/" title="pm.org">Belfast.pm</a pm.org> on Monday: "just change the grammar". If there's something you don't like in Perl 6, well, just change the grammar! I just had to say that as I did find it rather amusing (Scwhern's whole reason for this was that he could have a function called as <tt>isn't</tt> even when the <tt>'</tt> can no longer be used as a package separator - he just redefined the definition of an identifier!).</p>
