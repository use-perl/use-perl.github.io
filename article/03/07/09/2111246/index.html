<h2>keeping up with the onions</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/nicholas/">nicholas</a> on 2003-07-09T21:29:15</h3>
<p>Nice. Good work</p>
<p>But looking at its headlines I see that for use.perl it says <cite>use.perl   Project Ponie: Perl On New Internals Engine</cite>. That's sooooooo yesterday.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>



<h2>A few suggestions</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/SuperCruncher/">SuperCruncher</a> on 2003-07-09T22:41:26</h3>
In general, the web site looks pretty good, but I've got a few suggestions, as I had when I posted about the <a href="http://use.perl.org/article.pl?sid=02/08/02/1344238&amp;tid=9" title="perl.org">new Perl Foundation web site</a perl.org>. <p><ul>
  <li>No page title supplied in the &lt;title&gt; tag. Less likely to get a good search engine rating and users will have to manually type a name in when they bookmark the page.</li>
  <li>Acronyms not written in all uppercase, e.g. nntp, cgi, pdf and so on.</li>
  <li>Grammar nazis might disagree with me, but I think that the first entry under each main heading (e.g. "About Perl", "Get Perl") should have an initial capital.</li>
  <li>Again, I might be wrong about this but when you're writing the name of a publication where the title includes 'The', the 'the' should be written with an initial capital, e.g. 'The Perl Journal'. But again, I might be wrong.</li>
  <li>What happened to the good <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20020604045248/www.perl.org/press/fast_facts.html" title="archive.org">fast facts</a archive.org> page on the previous site design?</li>
</ul> <p>
If anyone wants my help on the site (so I'm not accused of complaining and not offering any help), please let me know. Just another idea as a closing thought: what about copying Python's (yes, I did say copying something from Python!) <a href="http://www.python-in-business.org/" title="python-in-business.org">Python in Business</a python-in-business.org> idea? A sleek site might help clueless mangers adopt Perl, but maybe I'm being too optimistic.</p>

On the subject of PythonInBusiness, I really like O'Reilly section on Perl's success <a href="http://perl.oreilly.com/news/success_stories.html" title="oreilly.com">stories</a oreilly.com>. Not sure if adding somethint like it to perl.org is redundant or not. The redesign looks great!

No it would be different for a different audience - less technical more 'business' i.e. dumbed down and buzzwordy.
<p>
Of course it could and should point to the success stories as well.
</p><p>
I would expect it to include such things as - Perl Training in each country, how to find perl employees, perl applications available, etc.
</p><p>

I second the title business.
I'd prefer to see "Perl.org - yada " style titles.<br/><br/>The icon they have is messed up
(just a black block).
They should use the SWEET
http://perlmonks.org/favicon.ico<br/><br/>That'll sweeten it up some.

In IE it doesn't show in the toolbar,
if I go to
http://www.perl.org/favicon.ico
it's just a black block.
<p>
If i download it
it looks blurred (like you put gaussian blur 4,
and just made it very very fuzzy)
In mozilla it just looks kinda broken
See

In phoenix it don't show up at all
(just like IE)

I am on Win2k</p>

<p>I have fixed the bug regarding title tags.</p>

Grammar nazis would tell you that nntp, cgi, and pdf are abbreviations, not acronyms.
<p>
Sorry, couldn't resist.
</p><p>
As for altered capitalization, that's called artistic license.</p>

Only yesterday I decided to write a meditation on PerlMonks about perl.org and how it didn't make Perl look good, etcetera.<br> <br>I like the new perl.org. Good work!



<h2>Looks good, but...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/phraktyl/">phraktyl</a> on 2003-07-10T16:52:17</h3>
The one thing I have to address is that the page width is static.  So, for those of us who use a wide browser, the new page only uses the left half of the window.  In addition to not using the screen real estate, this causes issues with printing as well.



<blockquote>

<h3><a href="/user/delegatrix/">delegatrix</a> on 2003-07-11T16:45:13</h3>
Yes, the next upgrade is planned as a fluid design.

<h2>DNS</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/bart/">bart</a> on 2003-07-11T00:45:37</h3>
Nice but... it'd be nicer still if a simple link to <a href="http://perl.org/" title="perl.org">perl.org</a perl.org> didn't give me a DNS error... but instead showed the site. After all, that <em>is</em> the name you use to refer to the site, no?



<blockquote>

<h2>Re:DNS</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Robrt/">Robrt</a> on 2003-07-13T01:28:56</h3>
<p>
For historical reasons the URL is <a href="http://www.perl.org/" title="perl.org">http://www.perl.org</a perl.org>, although the name of the site is "perl.org".
</p>
<p>This may or may not change in the future.  If you're interested in why, please find two people on opposite sides of the "www" vs "no www" debate, and wind them up.

Wouldn't you be able to have both? Or have the shorter redirect to the longer?

<h2>Links to Online Tutorials</h2>

<p>
There aren't too many links to online tutorials, but there should be.
</p>

<p>
I could also use a link to <a href="http://perl-begin.berlios.de/" title="berlios.de">http://perl-begin.berlios.de/</a berlios.de>
