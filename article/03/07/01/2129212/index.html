I am not putting myself <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/acme/journal/12912" title="perl.org">up for auction</a perl.org> again. I mean, how, like, degrading!

So, what can we not put you up for auction for this time?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)

<p>Surely it's not up to him. You'll need to check with his current owners.</p>

<p>Hey, don't be resellin' the goods honey!<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) I bought him fair and square and I expect he'll be busy until he gets CPANTS done...unless, of course, you really <i>want</i> to sell him to Uri<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) I think there are enough perl guys to sell off before trying to auction Leon again.</p>

I'm bringing two signed copies of Joshua Ortega's new hardcover novel <i> <a href="http://www.omegapp.com/frequencies.html" title="omegapp.com">((FREQUENCIES))</a omegapp.com> </i> for the auction (already talked to Tim Wilde about it).<br/><br/><blockquote><div>"In the tradition of <i>1984</i>, <i>Brave New World</i>, and <i>Fahrenheit 451</i>, <i>((FREQUENCIES))</i> is a meditation on the place of the individual in a society increasingly equipped to infringe." -Seattle Weekly</div></blockquote>



<h2>Hmm...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/pdcawley/">pdcawley</a> on 2003-07-04T20:27:21</h3>
The copy of <cite>C# Essentials</cite> signed by the members of the Perl 6 Design Team who were present at YAPC seemed to sell quite well.<br> <br>ISTR that the combination of the unsigned book + an ORA t-shirt got more bids once we removed the book from the combination.

<h3><a href="/user/chromatic/">chromatic</a> on 2003-07-04T20:37:11</h3>
<p>How well would a Leon, signed by the members of the Perl 6 Design Team who are present PLUS an ORA t-shirt, sell?  I could throw in a state-of-Kansas Jell-O mold.</p>

<p>Yeah, I couldn't sleep and stayed up watching late-night TV.  How did you know?</p>



<h2>Re:Hmm...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/krellis/">krellis</a> on 2003-07-05T01:56:01</h3>
Yeah, but <b>I</b> was the one who bought it.  That won't necessarily work so well this time!<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

<h2>Re:Hmm...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/pdcawley/">pdcawley</a> on 2003-07-05T03:18:11</h3>
So, sign it yourself, get the rest of the Perl 6 Design team (well, those who are at OSCON) to sign it too, and donate it to the auction.



<blockquote>

<h2>Re:Hmm...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Theory/">Theory</a> on 2003-07-07T16:52:37</h3>
<p>I can see it now. That "C# Essentials" book will become like fruit cake during the holidays: The same book will be sold over and over again, year after year. Maybe the buyer can immediately give it back each time and it can be sold several times in a single auction!</p>

<h2>Auction Item Drop-Off</h2>

If you've got anything to drop off for the auction, bring it to room 844 in the Mariott - call or e-mail ahead to schedule a drop-off, if no one's at the room you can reach me on my cellular at 508-450-0729.
