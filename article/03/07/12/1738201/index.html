<p><a href="http://www.dyndns.org/">krellis</a> writes <i>"Over $4,500 was raised Thursday night at the <a href="http://www.dyndns.org/">DynDNS.org</a>/<a href="http://www.onyxneon.com/">OnyxNeon</a> party here at OSCON 2003.  A large part of this was $1025 in a heated contest about the primary color for search.cpan.org.  London.pm fought hard to make the change to orange, but Graham Barr's group managed to win out, and the color will remain as 'web-safe teal.'  Graham is no sore winner though, and London.pm will be given their color for one month.  See the <a href="http://www.dyndns.org/news/releases/archives/2003/07/165.html">DynDNS Press Release</a> for more information, and thanks to everyone who contributed!"</i></p>

... and London.pm has a lot to answer for!  I'm just glad that Graham Barr's group managed to win out in the end<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<p>

&gt; Graham is no sore winner though, and London.pm will be given their color for one month.<br> <br>NOOOOOOOOOOOO! Holy moly, if I have to look at flaming orange for a month, London.pm better be ready to reimburse me for a new set of corneas!<br> <br>C'mon folks, a joke is a joke, but that orange is hideous! What is there, a secret Ron Weasley fan club in London.pm?<br>

Well, I like orange. However, if you don't like orange you can <a href="http://search.cpan.org/orange.html" title="cpan.org">get rid of it by donating</a cpan.org>...<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)

And how much do I have to donate for the orange to permanently go away? (jk, folks<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)

Well, maybe not just you. Maybe we can set a price that, if reached before the end of a month, will get rid of the flaming color. So, how much is it going to take from the community? (Man, are we setting a baaaad precedent here<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-))

<h2>So THAT'S what it was about</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jamiemccarthy/">jamiemccarthy</a> on 2003-07-13T13:49:26</h3>
I missed the auction, and there were numerous in-jokes to CPAN and orange at the last day's talks. So I didn't understand what that was all about until I got home and read this<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)



<h2>We're not all colour-blind</h2>

<blockquote><div> <i>London.pm fought hard to make the change to orange</i> </div></blockquote> <br> <p>Just because one member of London.pm has no sense of aesthetics please don't tar us all with the same brush. I'm sure that the majority would have been there fighting against the spread of orange had we not aall been in bed at the time of the auction<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>
