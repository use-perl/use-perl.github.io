<h2>I think the first question is ...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/chip/">chip</a> on 2003-07-10T18:25:41</h3>
Why?

<p>No, don't bother.  It was rhetorical.  Dismissive, even.</p>

Why have Perl Certification?
<p>
<b>General Purpose</b>
</p><ul>
<li>Provide optional credentials that certify a level of proficiency</li>
<li>
ideally, ultimately, several hierarchical levels, including:
<ul>
<li>
Basic, OO, CGI, DBI, Networking, etc.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>Who Benefits?</b>
</p><ul>
<li>
Hiring managers who want help in screening applicants</li>
<li>
JAPHs without college degrees or strong reputations
(like someone who learns Perl from the local *.pm and Camel), who need help in verifying their knowledge</li>
<li>
The Whole Perl Community
<ul>
<li>gives us a more professional appearance, by making it clear that we are now willing to play by the same (HR screening) rules as our colleagues (those pathetic souls using drastically inferior languages)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
I interpreted the question as "Why setup a whole Wiki for this one topic?"
</p>
<p>
At least, that's the question i would have asked<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... it seems like this could easily be covered by a single "node" on ny of a number of alrger discussion sites -- but hey, who am i to suggest that someone who has an interested in something shouldn't set up a site dedicated to that topic.

The topic is B big enough to populate
a Wiki of its own, and equally certain to be too
discursive and ungainly to be easily followed in a threaded medium (as has been previously demonstrated).  And it's a whole lot easier to explore discussions preserved in the Wiki format, IMHO.

Things to argue about!



<h2>Let's discuss it here</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jdavidb/">jdavidb</a> on 2003-07-11T15:42:29</h3>
<p>I haven't caught the wiki fever yet, but I do love slash.  Let's discuss it here, where we can see what ideas pass the test of community examination by what gets modded up.</p>



<h2>I vote no</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jdavidb/">jdavidb</a> on 2003-07-11T15:46:02</h3>
<p>After reading <a href="http://www.asktheheadhunter.com/" title="asktheheadhunter.com">Ask the Headhunter</a asktheheadhunter.com> I question the value of any particular certification for my own career.  I'm all for training, but I'm hooked on the idea of applying for a job by showing what I can do, not by listing bullet points on a resume.  I'd rather go in there and show them how I can make their lives easier with Perl.  That works in any shop, whereas certification is only going to be interesting to a place that already uses Perl.</p>

<p>However, my "no," vote is simply a, "No, I'm personally not interested," vote.  Maybe everybody else thinks it would be valuable for them, in which case I say, "More power to you."</p>



<blockquote>

<h2>Re:I vote no</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/yumpy/">yumpy</a> on 2003-07-11T20:11:45</h3>
Certainly, people with evidence of prior achievements that
show what they can do with Perl won't feel much
need to obtain certification to help establish their knowledge.  But those at earlier stages of their careers, or with former employers unwilling to give them references or let them take away code samples, may well feel the need for objective evidence of their knowledge.<br/><br/>I vote for helping them obtain that evidence, in
a manner approved by an independent group with credibility in the Perl community.

Any certificate is only as good as the certifying body. For example, you see the phrase "degree from" associated with "acredited institution" in many US documents.<br> <br>So, if/when any perl certificate-granting program is devised, please contact me with a large sum of money and I'll be happy to certify the certifying program<nobr> <wbr></nobr><tt>;)</tt> <br> <br>-matt
