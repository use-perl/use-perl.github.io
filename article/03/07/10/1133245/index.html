<p>Since I am new to Perl and have not gone through the rc process, what is the usual timeframe for the <i>final</i> release?</p>

When it's ready.<br>

<p>Duh?!</p>

<p>I am talking more along the lines of a release roadmap.</p>

"When it's ready" is the standard and traditional answer to your question. If you want "When it's ready" to be sooner be sure to download the release candidate and test it on your platform(s) of choice.

I don't want it to be sooner. Well, in the sense you mean.<br/><br/>Case in point. I pop over to the Python site and look at 2.3 and lo and behold there is a general roadmap for it. Will it slip? Already has. But there is a general round about time when the final will be out.

But that could mean it will be released before it is ready.<br> <br>Would you like Perl to be released before it is ready?<br> <br>Or perhaps when it has been ready for a month?<br> <br>I think "when it's ready" is the perfect moment for releasing software. Do you think it should be released sooner or later than when it is ready?<br> <br>If you want a date, you are out of luck. You can't predict when software is ready. Perl is not pie. Perhaps Python is pie.

Generally dates for Perl releases are not given, because people are volunteering their time and that time is a variable.<br/><br/>However there is good news.  Perl 5.8.0 is very solid.  It had a very long test period and is generally considered to be the best perl ever released, from a quality standpoint at least.<br/><br/>5.8.0 is software that we can all be very proud of.  I know I feel good to be using it in all my production systems.<br/><br/>There is no compelling reason to wait for 5.8.1 since we all feel very good about the current release.  This is not MS or some company where the<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.0 version generally needs a lot of patching before it is stable!<br/><br/>If you want to use perl, just use 5.8.0, and if you want to hack on perl, download the rc and compile it and run the test suite on your test boxes to make sure everything is good so that when 5.8.1 comes out it is even better!<br/><br/>Your interest in Perl and it's progress is appreciated<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

Well, if you're new to Perl, then the answer to your question is - it'll be ready long before you're able to tell the difference between it and 5.8.0.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)
