<div class="span8">
<p>One week after the second release candidate of perl 5.8.1, and as expected,
problems were found, and bugs fixed. Meanwhile, development continues.
Read all details in this week's summary.</p>
<p><h3>Tied hashes and scalar context</h3>
<p>Using a tied hash in scalar context gives in maintperl and in bleadperl a
fatal error : this was added two months ago (to test for the emptiness of
a tied hash, you should use keys()). However, this new fatal error was
integrated into 5.8.1-RC2 and this appears to be a surprising change,
probably not suited to a maintenance release (bug #22973).</p>
<pre>
    <a href="http://xrl.us/mux">http://xrl.us/mux</a> </pre>
<p>
<h3>5.8.1-RC2 incompatibilities</h3>
<p>Arthur Bergman finds that the type of a reference to an element of a tied
hash is now LVALUE instead of SCALAR. This is, strictly speaking, correct,
regarding the internal implementation, but incompatible with 5.8.0.
Moreover one could argue that references to tied hash elements should
behave the same way than references to regular hash elements. Dave
Mitchell proposes to <em>make tie-specific LVs stringify to SCALAR, while
other LVs remain as LVALUE.</em> </p>

<h3>A case of <code>$1</code> scoping</h3>
<p>Steve Grazzini demonstrates that <code>$1</code> and the other digit-variables are
not always dynamically scoped to the enclosing block, when <code>qr//</code> comes
to play. Arthur explains what happens in the guts of perl, but this
behaviour is nevertheless surprising (or so do I imagine).</p>
<pre>
    <a href="http://xrl.us/muz">http://xrl.us/muz</a> </pre>
<p>
<h3>Improving B::Deparse and other backends</h3>
<p>Stephen McCamant did some work on B::Deparse and B::Concise. Firstly, he
sent a patch to help Deparse (and other backends) to figure out the order
in which BEGIN blocks and <code>use</code> declarations are issued, by numeroting
them just like other statements. Secondly, he made several suggestions
about adding information in the op tree for figuring out the place of
those statements relatively to scoping operators.</p>
<pre>
    <a href="http://xrl.us/mu2">http://xrl.us/mu2</a> </pre>
<p>He also sent a fix for an obscure deparsing bug, related to
ithread-specific optrees, reported a while back by Alexey Tourbin.</p>
<p>
<h3>Signing CPAN distributions</h3>
<p>Tels explains why external signatures are more secure than embedded ones for
CPAN packages. Autrijus Tang then added to CPANPLUS the ability to check
the integrity of a package against a separate<nobr> <wbr></nobr><em>.sig</em> file.</p>

<h3>Hash key placeholders</h3>
<p>Marcus Holland-Moritz finds that <em>since 5.8.0, having hash values set to
<code>&amp;PL_sv_undef</code> causes the hash entries to be treated as 'placeholders'.
Thus, they do not appear when checking with hv_exists() or iterating over
the hash.</em> And this new behaviour is under-documented.</p>
<p>He proposes that, instead of using PL_sv_undef to mark placeholders (which
are used to implement restricted hashes), a new global PL_sv_placeholder
should be created (and proposes a patch against RC2).</p>

<h3>Perlbug attack</h3>
<p>Due to an accident and to the OSCON distraction, bug reports weren't
forwarded to the p5p mailing list for two weeks. As a consequence, after
Robert Spier fixed the mail stuff, we received about 40 of them in a few
minutes ! Some of them were already known (or even fixed), though.</p>
<p>Moreover, Tony Bowden walked through the bug database and found a large
number of bugs that were already fixed and should have been closed.
This led also to a significant number of fixes.</p>
<p>
<h3>Our Selection of Bugs</h3>
<p>Dave Mitchell fixed bug #3284 : the call <code>$x-&gt;isa('UNIVERSAL')</code>
wasn't returning the correct value (except the first time) when @ISA was
empty.</p>
<p>Alex Davies reports (bug #22967) that <code>study()</code> behaves incorrectly
when invoked from an XML::Parser callback. Is it a bug in <code>study()</code> or in
XML::Parser ?</p>
<p>XML::Parser and Storable also appear to interact badly since Storable
understands utf-8 keys or something. (Bug #23004.)</p>
<p>Ilya Martynov reports that the syntax <code>$hash{BAREWORD}</code> doesn't work with
perl 5.8.0 and later when BAREWORD contains non-ASCII chars. Bug #22969.
This used to work with 5.6.x.</p>
<p>sauoq reports that using a tainted string as a hash key untaints it. (Bug
#22974.)</p>
<p>Alexey Tourbin finds that tied values were mishandled by formats. Dave
Mitchell proposed a fix, and Nick Clark proposed a regression test. (Ah,
this one doesn't have a bug id.)</p>
<p>Iain Truskett reports an error in the docs for <code>Switch</code> : one should
write</p>
<pre>
    case (\@array) { statement(); }</pre>
<p>instead of</p>
<pre>
    case (@array) { statement(); }</pre>
<p>But perhaps is it better to fix the module to match the docs ? (Bug
#22999).</p>
<p>Jerrad Pierce is testing his module IO::Pager for portability and runs
into problems, because behaviour changes depending on perl version and IO
library. (Bug #23043)</p>
<p>
<h3>In Brief</h3>
<p>Jim Cromie is trying to get B::Generate working with recent perls.</p>
<p>Tassilo von Parseval is working on <em>h2xs</em>, although he finds it
hopelessly unmaintainable. He considers rewriting it from scratch.</p>
<pre>
    <a href="http://xrl.us/mu6">http://xrl.us/mu6</a> </pre>
<p>Chip Salzenberg tries to find a way to add additional options to
File::Copy::copy() (his primary goal being to add <code>cp -p</code> behaviour).
Slaven Rezic proposes that File::Copy::copy() could be made to support
most of the POSIX or GNU options of cp(1). Which seems to involve a
Getopt-like interface.</p>
<pre>
    <a href="http://xrl.us/mu7">http://xrl.us/mu7</a> </pre>
<p>Tim Jenness found out that the <code>**</code> operator was broken in RC2. Stephen
McCamant fixed it.</p>
<p>Ilya Martynov backported Data::Dumper on CPAN. The latest and greatest
Data::Dumper is now available for perl 5.6.1 !</p>
