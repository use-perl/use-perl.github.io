<p>Thanks to conference organizer
<a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/user/lenzo/">Kevin Lenzo</a>,
<a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/user/yapc/abstracts/">conference
speakers</a>,

<a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/user/lenzo/perl/">EFNet #perl</a> (do we
sound like an acceptance speech?  Sorry.)
<a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/user/yapc/">yet another perl
conference</a> was a big success.  If nothing else, the conference
was a wonderful gathering of Perl hackers, but it was also proof that
the Perl spirit of volunteerism can extend to events like this.

 <p><p>

The conference kicked off with a keynote by Larry Wall, which Lenzo said
helped legitimize the conference.  Despite problems with his eyes and
his props being routed hundreds of miles away by the airlines, Wall gave
an interesting talk about the  hime automation system, which he
reverse-engineered and uses to automate his home using Linux.

Sponsors and publishers <a href="http://www.awl.com/">Addison-Wesley Longman</a>,
<a href="http://www.ora.com/">O'Reilly</a>, and
<a href="http://www.manning.com/">Manning</a> advertised
various titles.  Manning, which has a cover art
scheme similar in concept to O'Reilly's (but with kinda
funny-looking people instead of animals) has
<a href="http://www.manning.com/Conway/">Object-Oriented Perl</a>
by Damian Conway for release soon.  O'Reilly has
<a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/maperl/">Mastering Algorithms in Perl</a>,
<a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/perlcdbs/">The Perl CD Bookshelf</a>
(which includes Perl in a Nutshell,
Programming Perl, Perl Cookbook, Advanced Perl Programming, Learning Perl,
and Learning Perl for Win32 Systems all on one CD-ROM).

 </p><p><p>

<a href="http://www.pm.org/">Perl Mongers</a> announced a forthcoming
CD-ROM, with help from <a href="http://www.activestate.com/">ActiveState</a>,
containing documents and resources for using Perl, which should be
available in the next couple of months.  Perl Mongers also announced
the White Camel awards, to be given at the
<a href="http://conference.perl.com/">O'Reilly Perl Conference</a>
on August 24, 1999.  They will be presented to the
"unsung heroes" who have devoted extraordinary time, creativity,
and energy for non-technical work for the Perl community.  Nominations
will be taken from the community, starting July 8 on the
<a href="http://www.pm.org/">Perl Mongers web site</a>.

 </p><p><p>

Dick Hardt from <a href="http://www.activestate.com/">ActiveState Tool Corp.</a>
spoke on Win32 perl, focusing much of his discussion on the recent
Microsoft deal, which has Microsoft funding development of perl for Win32.
Hardt noted several key areas of this development that would have cross-platform
benefit, helping not just Win32, but possibly other platforms, too.
Globalization work would include work to improve Unicode sipport, including
allowing utf8 strings in <tt>%ENV</tt> and <tt>@ARGV</tt>.  Work on a clean
C API would also help all platforms, and the important work on an
in-process <tt>fork</tt> should benefit all platforms that have threading but
no fork.

 </p><p><p>

Hardt also said that ActiveState would be working on making working with
reusable code simpler, with better structure and meta data in the modules,
and the ability to have different module versions installed.  Perl packaging
is to be improved, too, with a simplified runtime environment where
Perl modules could be bundled into single archives.

 </p><p><p>

Hardt emphasized that the Microsoft deal is good for Perl.  "They're not
controlling anything we're doing," he said.  ActiveState actually seemed
to be taking advantage of Microsoft's desire to make Win32 into the top
web serving platform, by getting Microsoft to fund certain aspects of
Perl development like <tt>fork</tt> in exchange for making Perl for Win32's
IIS support better.

 </p><p><p>

Lenzo announced that yapc will be held at CMU again next year, and that
they would have more room for a lot more attendees next year.

 </p><p><p>

As Perl News is technically on vacation right now, we'll get back to
vacationing and include more news on yapc in the weeks ahead, including
some words on more of the presentations.  Until then, the conference
materials should be going up soon at
<a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/user/yapc/">the yapc web site</a>.</p></p>
