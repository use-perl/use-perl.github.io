<div class="span8">
<p><a href="http://www.earthweb.com/">EarthWeb</a>, responding to concerns
about what it is doing with the newly acquired Perl Journal (both in
print and online), has posted a
<a href="http://www.itknowledge.com/tpj/ew-welcome.html">letter</a> to
TPJ readers.

 <p><p>

<a href="http://www.developer.com/about/who.html">Mark Schlack</a>,
Vice President of World Wide Content for EarthWeb, admitted
that not everything has gone smoothly so far in the transition, and
committed to fixing some of the online issues in regard to adding
back missing content and fixing subscription problems.  He also said that
bad interface problems are being addressed: the site is virtually unreadable
on lynx, and two of the links off the <a href="http://www.tpj.com/">main TPJ page</a> are unrenderable by Netscape 4.61 for Mac OS (and
probably other platforms too) because of broken tables (though some of
those problems seem to have been fixed as I was writing this).

 </p><p><p>

Schlack also introduced <a href="http://www.developer.com/community/person.cgi?id=MG33">Mike Green</a> as Executive Producer/Publisher of
all Perl Journal offerings, and commented on advertising on the site, saying
that EarthWeb has no plans to back off on the amount of, or types of,
advertising on the site.

 </p><p><p>

The future of The Perl Journal in print is still unclear, despite what
appear to be statements designed to clear up the issue.
Schlack said that EarthWeb has "no current plan to discontinue the print
version", but also claims that "online will supplant print to a great extent
as time goes by."   Schlack writes EarthWeb is "committed to publishing
it indefinitely," but gives no assurances that TPJ will remain a print
periodical in the long haul.  He asks readers to
<a href="http://www.itknowledge.com/tpj/contactus.html">let EarthWeb know</a>
whether or not they want a hard-copy version.</p></p>
