Lots of people won lots of things at
<a href="http://conferences.oreilly.com/perl3/">Perl Conference 3.0</a>,
and I am not talking about swag, like the cool knives given out by
<a href="http://www.sendmail.com/">Sendmail, Inc.</a>, the excellent
yo-yos from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/">amazon.com</a>, or the
Mr. Bunny's Internet Startup Games from <a href="http://www.borders.com/">Borders</a>.  No, these prizes actually required skill of some sort.
</p>

<p>
First was the Perl Bowl: Programmer Death Match, hosted by Ben Holzman.
After qualifying, semifinals, and the finals (plus some, er, technical
difficulties along the way), Jason Kruger was crowned the winner, and
granted a 400MHz Celeron computer (6.4GB, 64MB, etc.) with monitor
by <a href="http://www.valinux.com/">VA Linux Systems</a> for his efforts.
VA Linux's Chris DiBona said they would offer the same prize for next
year's contest.
</p>

<p>
The following day, Jon Orwant hosted the second annual Perl Quiz Show.
This time, the grand prizes (lots of stuff donated by lots of groups,
including the standard O'Reilly fare and half off stateroom accomodations
on the <a href="http://www.geekcruises.com/">Perl Whirl</a>) were taken
by London Perl Mongers Andy Wardley, Peter Haworth, Richard Clamp, and
Nick Ing-Simmons.
</p>

<p>
Inspired by the award-winning Coy module, a haiku contest was organized.
Kevin Hackman and Michael Schwern won the general contest.  In order, their
winning entries:
</p>

<pre>  fall leaves blanket ground
  redmond dreams darkly -- beware!
  winter brings penguins</pre>

<pre>  # Life ends with a crash
  require 'Coy.pm';
  &amp;laughter while $I, die;</pre>

<p>
There was also a contest after Damian Conway's Coy.pm presentation for haikus, with
the winners taking home a copy of <a href="http://www.manning.com/Conway/">Conway's book</a>.  David Adler and Dean Hudson won with these pieces:
</p>

<pre>  On the spot haiku
  Written on a ladies Back.
  Know we have pictures.</pre>

<pre>  Your book entices,
  Fork it over, friend aussie.
  Jedi mind tricks work.</pre></p>
