<p>Besides the first release candidate of perl 5.8.3, lots of things happened
on perl5-porters this week. Read about new features to be added to the
language, lots of bugs and fixes, and other odds and ends.</p>
<p><h3>5.8.3 RC1</h3>
<p>Nicholas Clark released the first release candidate of perl 5.8.1 on
Wednesday. See the announcement at:</p>
<pre>
    <a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=20040107181832.GG11136%40plum.flirble.org">http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=20040107181832.GG11136%40plum.flirble.org</a> </pre>
<p>Various problems were then found (and mostly solved). Elizabeth Mattijsen
reported problems with her module Thread::Bless. She also found that a
thread test was hanging forever. Apparently this has something to do with
the flavour of threads used by the Linux kernel.</p>
<pre>
    <a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=p05111b06bc239c68a6fa%40%5B192.168.56.3%5D">http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=p05111b06bc239c68a6fa%40%5b192.168.56.3%5d</a> </pre>
<p>5.8.3 is expected next week.</p>
<p>
<h3> <code>my $_</code> </h3>
<p>Rafael Garcia-Suarez proposed an extension to the language : the ability
to use the default scalar <code>$_</code> as a lexical variable, by declaring it
with <code>my</code>. He outlined the problems solved by this new construction,
proposed a preliminary patch and pointed out a few open questions, that
were discussed. Feedback was mostly positive.</p>
<pre>

<p>
<h3>Multiple perls in the same tree</h3>
<p>Elizabeth Mattijsen asks whether debug-enabled and standard versions of perl,
and threaded / unthreaded versions, can coexist in the same installation
tree (the binary executables having different names, of course). The
answer is mostly yes, as the relevant perl modules are installed into
architecture-specific directories ; but there is no specific archname for
debug-enabled perls.</p>
<pre>
    <a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=p05111b01bc237533767b%40%5B192.168.56.3%5D">http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=p05111b01bc237533767b%40%5b192.168.56.3%5d</a> </pre>
<p>
<h3>Nesting <code>__WARN__</code> handlers</h3>
<p>Ed Avis suggests (as bug id #24806) that a localized <code>$SIG{__WARN__}</code>
handler could call the outer handler if it happens to call <code>warn()</code> again;
or, that some other mechanism could be modified to make this happen.
Rafael points out that this is already possible with perl, by using a
closure to capture the outer handler. Yitzchak Scott-Thoennes says
that a new lexical pragma</p>
<pre>
    use warnings::handler sub {<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... };</pre>
<p>would be a good idea.</p>
<pre>
    <a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=rt-3.0.8-24806-69433.12.789974826153%40perl.org">http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=rt-3.0.8-24806-69433.12.789974826153%40per<nobr>l<wbr></nobr> .org</a> </pre>
<p>
<h3>Parsing edge cases</h3>
<p>Tassilo von Parseval noted (bug #24807) that</p>
<pre>
    use if; print if-&gt;VERSION;</pre>
<p>is a syntax error, because <code>if</code> is not only a standard package, it's also
a keyword. The <code>open</code> and <code>sort</code> pragmas share this interesting
property.</p>
<p>However, there are several ways to circumvent this<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:</p>
<pre>
    print &quot;if&quot;-&gt;VERSION;
    print if::-&gt;VERSION;</pre>
<pre>
    <a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=rt-3.0.8-24807-69451.9.61826812018678%40perl.org">http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=rt-3.0.8-24807-69451.9.61826812018678%40pe<nobr>r<wbr></nobr> l.org</a> </pre>
<p>
<h3>Various bugs, solved</h3>
<p>Dave Mitchell fixed bug #24674 : now, <code>$^O</code> will not incorrectly get
tainted when read, as this was the case; but assigning a tainted value to
it will produce a fatal error.</p>
<p>Tim Bunce reported a case of segfault with DBD::Oracle, which was traced
down and fixed by Dave Mitchell. The bug happened when a closure was
returned from a thread via join(). However his regression test hanged on
Windows. Dave adds : <em>I'm rather wondering whether we shouldn't just ban
altogether threads returning CVs.</em> </p>
<p>Ton Hospel reported bug #24813, the <code>-0</code> command-line argument doesn't
work anymore on the <code>#!</code> line with perl 5.8.2. This was fixed by Rafael
(who introduced this bug in the first place).</p>
<p>Ton also reported bug #24815 : some syntax errors lead to unsuppressible
warnings; for example, <em>Number found where operator expected</em>. Rafael
turned this message (and a similar one involving <code>elseif</code>) into a
mandatory warning (enabled by default, but that could be silenced.)</p>
<p>But that's not over; Ton found (bug #24816) that some bitwise operators
weren't dealing appropriately with magical variables (with the example of
<code>$?</code>) if they were used before the magical variable was accessed at all.
Rafael committed a quick fix. However, as Yitzchak Scott-Thoennes finds
out, this fix is not perfect because it unnecessarily invokes magic. He's
working on this problem.</p>
<pre>
    <a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=rt-3.0.8-24816-69523.13.5221943075889%40perl.org">http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=rt-3.0.8-24816-69523.13.5221943075889%40pe<nobr>r<wbr></nobr> l.org</a> </pre>
<p>Jesse Vincent reports (bug #28486) that <code>join()</code> has problems with UTF-8
data. Slaven Rezic produced a small test case, and Sadahiro Tomoyuki
provided a patch.</p>
<pre>
    <a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=rt-3.0.8-24846-69684.3.4343855767974%40perl.org">http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=rt-3.0.8-24846-69684.3.4343855767974%40per<nobr>l<wbr></nobr> .org</a> </pre>
<p>
<h3>Various bugs, not yet solved</h3>
<p>Stas Bekman reports that <code>seek()</code> and <code>tell()</code> don't work well with a dup'ed
DATA filehandle. (Bug #24818)</p>
<pre>
    <a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=rt-3.0.8-24818-69544.7.1371603580959%40perl.org">http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=rt-3.0.8-24818-69544.7.1371603580959%40per<nobr>l<wbr></nobr> .org</a> </pre>
<p>Steve Hay found a weird bug with <code>UNIVERSAL::isa()</code> turning into an
undefined subroutine. (Bug #24824)</p>
<pre>
    <a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=rt-3.0.8-24824-69588.13.1031404712176%40perl.org">http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=rt-3.0.8-24824-69588.13.1031404712176%40pe<nobr>r<wbr></nobr> l.org</a> </pre>
<p>
<h3>In Brief</h3>
<p>Petras Kudaras provided a Lithuanian translation of perl583delta.</p>
<pre>
    <a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=3FF9D0F8.3060109%40delfi.lt">http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=3FF9D0F8.3060109%40delfi.lt</a> </pre>
<p>Tels released Math::BigRat 0.11. He also wondered about ways to improve
the performance of his Math::* modules, and experimented with Devel::Size.
(Eventually he wrote Devel::Size::Report, to be found on CPAN, to produce
neater reports for all elements in a data structure.)</p>

<p>Jim Cromie proposed an enhancement patch for B::Concise, which was
discussed in detail. (Bug #24821).</p>
<pre>
