Pity.  There's a lot of great and good poets in the rest of the world!  Sigh.<br/><br/>--Paul (in Ireland).

Yeah, they'd probably sweep the contest too.  This restriction is to make it <i>possible</i> for someone from America (north, and norther {grin}) to win.

Of course that fact that I'm a dual national, Irish and Canadian (or should that be "Irish and Northerer"), still doesn't allow me to enter.  And I was feeling very poetic and all!<br/><br/>-Paul (still in Ireland).

<p>It also discriminates against potential poets who live in the US but are currently on active service overseas.</p>

I could always ask the new folks doing TPJ if they would want me to do another Perl Poetry Contest. I didn't restrict people by country!

<p>Curious. They appear to have changed that page and removed the "physically located..." clause. However, it's still copyright 2003.</p>

<p>How strange, I'm not going to complain. I don't know if my comments here and on <a href="http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=323080" title="perlmonks.org">Perlmonks</a perlmonks.org> have had any effect, but it's nice of them to open up the competition a bit more.</p>

<p>I suppose I'd better write a Hiaku now I've caused all this fuss...</p>

<h2>Definition of haiku?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/fxn/">fxn</a> on 2004-01-24T23:06:16</h3>
I've read there's no consensus about what's a haiku in English. Do you know of any definition for this or previous contests? It seems there's none in ActiveState's page AFAICT.

Just for the record, I finally wrote to ActiveState:<br/><br/><ul>
<li>"valid program": It is not enough for Perl solutions to compile, they have to be executable in recent perls.</li>
<li>Metric: 3 verses with traditional 5-7-5.</li>
</ul>



<h2>Re:Definition of haiku?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/hanamaki/">hanamaki</a> on 2004-01-28T18:48:47</h3>
In most western languages a haiku is viewed as a poem with a 5-7-5 Syllable rythm written in three Lines. <br>
Japanese haiku are usually written in just one line and there does not exist a concept of syllable, but a 5-7-5 mora rythm. A mora is a phonetic unit of a specific length. E.g. "kyo" and "n" are both single mora in Japanese, therefore it takes exactly the same time to pronounce them. (Japanese is rather a mora timed language which tonal features, than a syllable based language.)
