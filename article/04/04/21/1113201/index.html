<p><a href="mailto:ajs@perl.org">ajs</a> writes <i>"The <a href="http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2004/04/16/a12.html">12th Apocalypse for Perl 6</a> has been released. This is a skip forward in the ordering, as the last Apocalypse was number <a href="http://dev.perl.org/perl6/apocalypse/A06.html">6</a> and <a href="http://dev.perl.org/perl6/exegesis/E07.html">7 was deferred to "Exegesis 7: Formats"</a> by Damian Conway. Why the skip? Because objects (the subject of A12) are key to the rest of the Apocalypses, and so Larry felt he had to get A12 out of the way before he could move on. In theory, the rest of the Perl 6 spec (of which each Apocalyspe is a piece), will be much faster in coming, health issues not withstanding, of course."</i></p>

<h2>It's bigger, longer, and uncut</h2>

Has anyone else noticed that these documents keep getting exponentially longer, both in time to produce and content involved.  It seems as if there is some sort of cosmic constant that keeps these things in check.

Well, not quite exponentially, but this one is big {grin}.<br>
<br>
It makes sense, though (at least in my feeble mind).  Objects are a Big Topic.  As much as I *like* Perl's current OO (the flexibility and optionability are big bonuses in my book) there were many (some valid (again in my feeble mind's eye)) complaints.<br>
<br>
I've been too busy with $day_job to really dig into (A|E)12, but given the track record of Perl's creator and supporting staff, I'm pretty sure I'll be pleasantly surprised when I do.<br>

As only a casual observer of Perl 6, this was the first Ap. that I didn't read fully. Something about the 80 pages in the printer-friendly format scared me off.<br> <br>However, between the new Apocali and Parrot progress, I'm planning on looking at Perl 6 Essentials 2nd ed. this summer.

They are not *all* longer (A2 was longer than A3).<blockquote><div> <tt>&nbsp; &nbsp; 219 A01.html<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; 806 A02.html<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; 755 A03.html<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;1648 A04.html<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;1903 A05.html<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;2765 A06.html<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;2941 A12.html<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;3418 E07.html</tt> </div></blockquote>but your point is well taken, and yes, the length has been going up. This is because:
<ol>
<li> Perl 6 has become increasingly well defined with each paper, and so the number of previous details you have to tie in to grows</li>
<li> The topic covered have increased in complexity.</li>
<li> Larry has been taking on increasngly difficult topics, as the foundation for them is laid.</li>
</ol>I would expect that A8-11 and A12-29 will be somewhat lighter weight. The standard library and module construction are the only REALLY big bits that are left.
