<h1>This Week on perl5-porters (5-11 April 2004)</h1>

<div class="span8">
<p>Spring is here, at least in the northern hemisphere, and perl 5.8.4 is
approaching. This doesn't stop the Perl 5 porters from pursuing their
usual job: proposing exciting new ideas, and fixing bugs. Read on for the
details.</p>
<p><h2> <a name="towards_5_8_4">Towards 5.8.4</a> </h2>
<p>Nicholas Clark posted a draft of the perldelta for perl 5.8.4, and then
released a first release candidate, which triggered some last-minute
adjustments. Randal L. Schwartz also commented on the modules that were
still newer on CPAN than in the RC1 tarball; which is not to be considered
absolutely evil, as Nicholas explained, given that the primary goal of a
maintenance release is stability.</p>

<p>
<h2> <a name="more_pack_templates">More pack templates</a> </h2>
<p>Marcus Holland-Moritz proposed an extension to the <code>pack()</code> template syntax,
to handle signed integers in big- and in little-endian order. H. Merijn
Brand suggested that, instead of using new letters, one could use a <code>!</code>
suffix to denote signedness, proposition which was unanimously approved.</p>
<pre>
    <a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=20040405182634.7dc02687%40r2d2">http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=20040405182634.7dc02687%40r2d2</a> </pre>
<p>But then, Marcus took his initial idea further, and proposed a more
general extension. This second one, among other things, uses the <code>&lt;</code>
and <code>&gt;</code> suffixes to denote respectively little- and big-endianness.
Patches are to be expected.</p>

<p>
<h2> <a name="unicode_exercise">Unicode exercise</a> </h2>
<p>Jarkko Hietaniemi proposed a small Unicode task for the interested:
automate the generation of Unicode properties in perl's Unicode character
tables (the files in <em>lib/unicore</em>); they are currently hardcoded.
The details can be found at:</p>

<p>
<h2> <a name="optree_black_magic">Optree black magic</a> </h2>
<p>Jim Cromie, who recently worked on the <code>B::Concise</code> (a core module to
dump optrees), got an idea: using a <code>B::Concise</code> style to generate code
to be executed by <code>B::Generate</code> to generate an optree equivalent to the
one which was dumped.</p>
<p>Scott Walters commented that he is, on his own, working on a Perl 6 to
Perl 5 bytecode compiler, in sight of using B::Generate to have executable
code; and some of the efforts converge here. Something interesting might
be produced by this (maybe <em>psooie</em> --	<em>Perl Six On Old Internals
Engine</em>.)</p>

<p>
<h2> <a name="an_improved_warning">An improved warning</a> </h2>
<p>Dave Mitchell proposed a patch to improve the famous warning <em>Use of
uninitialized value...</em> by adding the name of the undefined variable or
array/hash subscript that triggered the warning in the potentially faulty
expression. I'm sure this additional verbosity will make lots of coders
happy.</p>
<p>
<h2> <a name="caching_tied_hash_elements">Caching tied hash elements</a> </h2>
<p>Jamie Lokier submitted an extensive bug report (bug #28233) concerning the
aggressive caching of references to elements of tied hashes. Those
references are magical, since reading from them calls <code>FETCH()</code> and writing
to them calls STORE(), but the read or written value is cached by perl,
and sometimes this cache isn't invalidated whereas it should be. Jamie
proposed a solution but nobody commented yet.</p>
<pre>

<p>
<h2> <a name="some_other_bugs">Some other bugs</a> </h2>
<p>Rafael fixed a compiler bug, which was indefinitively looping when
parsing (not executing) the following construct:</p>
<pre>
    map { while (1) {} } ()</pre>
<p>David Dyck noticed a glitch in <em>find2perl</em>, now that it defaults to
<code>-print</code> if no other action is specified: it shouldn't default to
<code>-print</code>, however, when one of the actions is an <code>-eval</code>. This was
fixed.</p>
<p>Andrew Alakozow reported (as bug #28364) that perl segfaults on Win32 when
some XS code changes values in the program's environment, and when
the destruct level is greater than 0 (for example in spawned threads, or
when the environment variable PERL_DESTRUCT_LEVEL is set at an appropriate
value).</p>
<p>Leah reported (bug #28294) that the module <code>File::Basename</code> is plagued
with deficiencies. Rafael suggests either to rewrite it (eventually with a
backport to CPAN), or to deprecate it.</p>
<p>
<h2> <a name="upgraded_modules">Upgraded modules</a> </h2>
<p>Dave Rolsky released Time::Local 1.08, then 1.09, which contain mostly
documentation and test fixes.</p>
<p>Jarkko Hietaniemi released Time::HiRes 1.57, 1.58, and 1.59. It fixes a
problem on Windows and Cygwin platforms: <em>if the performance counter
drifts by more than two seconds from the system clock (due to ntp
adjustments, for example), recalibrate our internal counter</em>.</p>

<p>This summary was written by Rafael Garcia-Suarez, from Paris, France.
Thanks to Elizabeth Mattijsen for having taken the role of interim
summarizer during two weeks. (And now for a highly personal advertisement:
I'm still looking for a flat in Paris. Offers welcome!)</p>
