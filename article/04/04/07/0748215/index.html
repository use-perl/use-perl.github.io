<p><a href="mailto:liz@dijkmat.nl">Elizabeth Mattijsen</a> writes <i>"With a little delay comes this week the weekly Perl 5 Porters Summary from the centre of reality that is Echt, the Netherlands.  About 250 messages were posted in the last week.  A lot was said about documentation.  And a Release Candidate was released!  Well, technically not inside the week, but inside of the bounds of this summary, anyway."

<b>No stacked filetest operators</b>
</p><p>
Oops.  I misinterpreted 5.8.4's changelog.  Perl 5.8.4 will not have stacked filetest operators.  Thanks to Paul Johnson for pointing this out.

<b>Indirect notation in core documentation</b>
</p><p>
Yves Orton started a discussion about the usage of indirect object notation in Perl's core documentation, and whether the Perl core documentation should give the good example by not using indirect object notation.  Beginning Perl programmers would be confused by this extra synctactic sugar (well, I know when I was starting doing Perl objects).

</p><p>
<b>The ref( $proto ) || $proto Debate</b>
</p><p>
Ovid started a discussion aka can of worms about the use of the archetypical idiom

 sub new {
  my $proto = shift;
  my $class = ref( $proto ) || $proto;

in Perl's core documentation as it introduces cargo-culting (even though it is documented in perltoot).  The discussion continued on what it actually means when you call "new" on an object as opposed to on a class (bareword). Randal Schwartz ended the discussion with a preview of one of his upcoming articles, in which he basically said that there would always be 67% of the people expecting the wrong thing from calling "new" on an object.  A patch was supplied by Ovid in the end: it was applied.

<b>wantarray inside eval block</b>
</p><p>
Tim Bunce reported that wantarray seems to behave differently inside an eval block from e.g. a do block.  Rafael added a documentation patchlet. Personally, I'm not sure whether this is actually a bug or a feature: in any case, it's documented now.

<b>localtime() not mentioning gmtime() and vice versa</b>
</p><p>
Dan Jacobson reported that the perl documentation of localtime() doesn't mention gmtime() and vice versa.  He didn't supply a proposal for a change in the documentation, or a patch.  Too bad.  It would have improved Perl's documentation with little effort on his side.  Nobody has reacted so far.

<b>The version saga continues</b>
</p><p>
As promised last week, John Peacock uploaded a new version of version.pm on CPAN.  This version included some extra's not in the core, which immediately exposed yet another problem of modules living both in the core as well as on CPAN: if version X of something on CPAN includes more files than version X in the core, how will CPAN.pm or CPANPLUS.pm ever download the CPAN version?

<b>Signed big and little endian in (un)pack</b>
</p><p>
Marcus Holland-Moritz had a feature request for allowing pack to directly support signed little and big endian integers in (un)pack.  His original proposal used extra letters.  Merijn H. Brand thought the proposal was a good idea, but that it was using too much letter real estate.  A different proposal and patch using a "!" suffix was given later, but as yet not committed.

<b>Nick keeps the pressure on!</b>
</p><p>
Perl 5.8.4 RC1 was released by Nicholas Clark.  Expect a proper 5.8.4 in a week or so!
