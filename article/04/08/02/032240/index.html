<p>Allison writes <i>"TPF is proud to announce the winners of the 2004 <a href="http://www.perl.org/advocacy/white_camel/">White Camel</a>
awards.  The award ceremony was held at the <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/os2004/">O'Reilly Open Source
Convention</a>.


</i><p><i>
<b>Jon Orwant</b> is the original editor and publisher of The Perl Journal. A
long-time Perl user, Jon has had a significant impact on the Perl
community. Among other things, he ushered in the Perl 6 announcement
with the now-famous 'coffee mug heard round the world' at The Perl
Conference in 2000.</i>
</p>

<p> <b> <tt>brian d foy</tt> </b> founded the Perl Mongers groups at the
second Perl conference in 1997, and started the White Camel awards in
1999. He is the publisher of The Perl Review, which just celebrated
its first issue in print. He recently returned from a year in the desert
maintaining Perl modules without electricity or Internet access.
</p>


<p> <b>Dave Cross</b> is a longstanding member of the Perl community. He started
the first non-North American Perl Mongers group, London.pm. He's the
current leader of the Perl Mongers groups worldwide, and revived the
Perl Mongers group leaders list."</p></p>

<h2>It wasn't me, honest!</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/brian_d_foy/">brian_d_foy</a> on 2004-08-02T06:16:24</h3>
I may have been in the big sandbox, but it was Andy Lester who maintained my modules (including Test::Pod, which he now owns).<br> <br>Adam Turoff was a co-conspirator in the whole Perl Mongers thing (and he's a previous White Camel winner for that), as was the guy who handed me the actual award: Dave Adler.



<h2>And if I...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ambs/">ambs</a> on 2004-08-02T08:26:56</h3>
edit a magazine too?
<p>
Joking! Congratulations to all. They were well chosen.</p>

<p>Personally, I'm particularly happy to see <tt>brian</tt>'s name on the list. In the first few years of the White Camel awards I always thought it was unfair that one of the people most deserving of an award couldn't get one as he was the person giving out the awards.</p>
<p>I'm glad that discrepancy has been addressed.</p>
