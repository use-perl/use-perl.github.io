  This looks like a really nice app in potential but it seems to be unable to reach any other pod through the links at first (hangs forever), though it works afterwards . I'm sure that can be fixed (looks like it could be some initialisation taking quite some time). However the author seems to be taking chances with copyright infringement that I'd be afraid of. The icon and main graphics that I see are all directly lifted from Camel cigarette packs! Unless those are in the public domain and I wasn't aware of it, they should probably be removed before they notice, tobacco companies don't tend to be all that nice in the legal arena<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)

Do you have the Developer tools installed?
It was unable to find docs on a machine I tested without the Developer Tools.<br/><br/>this is the first release and there are known bugs.
I've never had any performance related issues though...<br/><br/>Thanks for pointing out the potential problem with the camel logo. I had put that there as a joke when i first started writing the app.<br/><br/>I should probably just use the standard perl camel logo. although joe has started to grow on me<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)<br/><br/>Thanks for the feedback!

  Yup I have them. The problem is a bit weird: right after launching, clicking on any link will just go nowhere (it'll just keep waiting). After going to any page through the address bar, everything works as expected. Strange<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

  Keep us posted on upgrades!
