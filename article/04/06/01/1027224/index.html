<p> <i>Simon asked: "Does anyone else remember when YAPCs were run by one or two individuals with lots of energy?"</i> </p>

<p> <b>They still are!</b>  YAPC::Europe is being organised and run by a very small group.  Richard made it very clear in his announcement that the new committee is not responsible for <i>running</i> the conferences, just for <i>encouragement</i>.  The organisers need all the encouragement they can get.</p>

YAPCs are still done by only a few people. TPF is there to help out where needed, usually one or two people do all the organizing, and may have some people helping out with certain details. But, it's really one or two people doing the bulk of the work and making sure it all comes together.<br> <br>And believe me, all the help you can get is a Good Thing. It helps double teaming people with phone calls, faxing, emailing, answering questions and helping keep a mild bit of sanity in the days leading up to the con.
