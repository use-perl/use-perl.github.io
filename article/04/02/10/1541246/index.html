<p><a href="mailto:useperlreply@twoshortplanks.com">2shortplanks</a> writes <i>"For the first time ever, the British Computer Society have been
convinced to allow competitors in their annual <a href="http://www1.bcs.org.uk/portal/showSection.asp?sectionid=932">UK
programming competition</a> to code entries in Perl.  <a href="http://www1.bcs.org.uk/DocsRepository/05700/5775/enter.htm">Entry</a>
for the first round closes on the 20th February."</i>  Read on for more details.</p>
<p><i>
The competition requires programming teams to code a challenge within
a set period of time in a controlled environment. There are <a href="http://www1.bcs.org.uk/DocsRepository/03900/3949/sample.htm">sample
questions</a> on the website. By the accounts of the Perl Mongers I've
spoken to that have entered in the past I gather it's a lot of fun.
</i><p><i>
London.pm would like to thank its members who are volunteering to be
judges at the heat that trials Perl as a programming language at the <a href="http://www-5.ibm.com/uk/locations/hursley.html">IBM Hursley
Site</a> on the 6th March.  Unfortunately, no other heat this year will
be able to accept Perl entries.
</i></p><p><i>
Entrants will be required to be BCS members to compete, but they can
join at the same time as they enter the competition.  There is also
a twenty five pound entry fee per team.
</i></p><p><i>
As I know you're all going to ask me this: You'll be using ActiveState
Perl 5.6.1 on Windows.  You can use Eclipse, gvim, GNU Emacs, Nano or
Notepad if you really want.  You won't be able to use CPAN (as half
the problems probably have stock answers) though if there's a
particular facility missing in the Perl distribution that the other
languages have that is required for the competition (e.g. XML Parsers)
then the judges will pre-install modules before the competition.
</i></p><p><i>
Good Luck.</i></p></p>

I'm sure you've all heard the urban legend about <a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=rdm-0611981556370001%40140.174.42.30" title="google.com">Perl being "too good" for a programming competition</a google.com>. Well this is our chance to get that story to come true.

Oi, you're meant to be impartial to all languages you're judging.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)

ActiveState has offered to provide licences to our Komodo IDE for Perl programmers entering the competition.  We're waiting to hear back from the judges.
