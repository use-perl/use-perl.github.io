<p>This week is to be filed in the category "busy" for the Perl 5 porters.
Read about new optimisations, new ideas, new warnings, bugs, fixes, and
other future plans for the next major version of Per 5.</p>
<p><h3>A couple of optimisations</h3>
<p>Paul Johnson revamped the internal OP structure so that optrees now take
less memory (while the speed impact is not mesureable.) This is going only
in bleadperl, because, obviously, it breaks binary compatibility.</p>
<pre>
    <a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=20040221174213.5c39a8b5.rgarciasuarez%40free.fr">http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=20040221174213.5c39a8b5.rgarciasuarez%40fr<nobr>e<wbr></nobr> e.fr</a> </pre>
<p>Dave Mitchell continues his series of impressive patches by extending the
AELEMFAST optimisation to lexical arrays. This optimisation was already in
place for global arrays, to access an element where the index is an
integer constant between 0 and 255. As a result, access to fixed elements
of lexical arrays seems to be faster by a factor of 50%.</p>

<p>
<h3> <code>read()</code> return value and EOF</h3>
<p>Michael Bell reports (as bug #26787) that <code>read()</code> can return 0 on Linux
even when not at end-of-file, when under a high system load. It is a bug
in perl, or a misfeature, or a bug in Linux? Should <code>read()</code> return <code>undef</code>
on EOF?</p>
<pre>
    <a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=rt-3.0.8-26787-78336.2.2498005290219%40perl.org">http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=rt-3.0.8-26787-78336.2.2498005290219%40per<nobr>l<wbr></nobr> .org</a> </pre>
<p>
<h3>Reopening a STD filehandle</h3>
<p>Stas Bekman reports (bug #26670) that perl (with the PerlIO
implementation, default since 5.8.0) seems to handle <code>dup(2)</code> badly when
some STD streams are closed, emitting an obscure warning <em>Filehandle
STDOUT reopened only for input</em> (or the inverse). Nick Ing-Simmons points
out that this is in fact expected behaviour: since STDOUT was closed, the
next <code>open()</code> reuses filehandle number 1, which is, by definition, STDOUT
(in perl and in C); so perl, here, warns about a potential bogus
situation. Nick's advice is to reopen a closed STD handle to<nobr> <wbr></nobr><em>/dev/null</em>.</p>

<p>
<h3>Autovivification of an assignment</h3>
<p>Ton Hospel notices (bug #26866) that the autovivification of hash and
array references does not seem to happen consistently. For example, this
is valid:</p>
<pre>
    $u = undef; $x = $u-&gt;{foo}</pre>
<p>but this dies with a fatal error:</p>
<pre>
    $x = ($u=undef)-&gt;{foo}</pre>
<p>Nicholas Clark points out that this is probably the same problem that was
reported as bug #18635.</p>

<h3>A prototype for defaulting to <code>$_</code> </h3>
<p>Continuing a thread from last week, a proposal to extend the prototype
syntax was discussed: a new prototype character, <code>_</code>, could stand for
<em>optional value that defaults to $_</em>. For example, a function that takes
a list as a parameter, but that uses <code>$_</code> if passed the empty list, could
have the prototype <code>sub mychomp(_@)</code>. However, this implies that the
prototypes of built-ins would change.</p>
<p>The complete thread:</p>

<p>
<h3>New warning</h3>
<p>The dubious construct</p>
<pre>
    my $foo = $bar if $condition;</pre>
<p>(and other equivalent ones) now produces a deprecation warning, thanks to
Dave Mitchell. (See our previous episodes for details).</p>
<p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Bugs</h3>
<p>Jamie Lokier reports (bug #26909) that in a <code>(?{...})</code> regular expression
block, lexical variables are captured, just like in closures, but without
warning the user as of 5.8.0. This lack of warning is fixed in recent
perls.</p>
<p>He also reported (as bug #26910) that <code>use strict 'vars'</code> doesn't seem to
be active in <code>(?{...})</code> blocks.</p>
<p>Sean O'Rourke reported that calling a subroutine <code>f()</code> recursively with
<code>goto &amp;f</code> leaks memory, and suggests that it may come from lexicals not
being freed. (Bug #26959.)</p>
<p>
<h3>In Brief</h3>
<p>Rafael announced that he plans to make a new developement release of perl,
5.9.1, in March.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Leon Brocard released perl 5.005_04 RC2.</p>
<pre>
    <a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=20040219142651.GA31294%40kanga.astray.com">http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=20040219142651.GA31294%40kanga.astray.com</a> </pre>
<p>Brendan O'Dea sent a batch of patches that he applied to the Debian
5.8.3-2 release of perl.</p>
<pre>
    <a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=20040215122717.GA26812%40londo.c47.org">http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=20040215122717.GA26812%40londo.c47.org</a> </pre>
<p>Russ Allbery released Term::ANSIColor 1.08. MIME::Base64 3.00, which was
released a while ago, was also integrated into the perl distribution.</p>

<h3>About this summary</h3>
<p>This summary was written by Rafael Garcia-Suarez.  Weekly summaries are
published on <em> <a href="http://use.perl.org/">http://use.perl.org/</a> </em> and posted on a mailing list, which
subscription address is <em> <a href="mailto:perl5-summary-subscribe@perl.org">perl5-summary-subscribe@perl.org</a> </em>. (I've been
trying to use gmane (<em> <a href="http://news.gmane.org/">http://news.gmane.org/</a> </em>) as a message archive, but
it's horribly slow.) Corrections and comments are welcome.</p></p>

<h2>Faster by a factor of 50%?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Mark Thomas/">Mark Thomas</a> on 2004-02-25T13:45:46</h3>
<i>As a result, access to fixed elements of lexical arrays seems to be faster by a factor of 50%</i>
<p>
Wouldn't that be half as fast? My guess is that you mean "50% faster" or equivalently, "faster by a factor of 1.5"</p>
