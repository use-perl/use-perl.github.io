<p><a href="http://www.sidhe.org/user/dan/blog/">Dan</a> writes <i>"It's time to change the guard<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... or at least lay on more. Here's the scoop: we need a Perl 6 pumpking,
someone to take on the responsibility of making the Perl 6 compiler
happen. When we started this whole process these many years ago, we
thought having one person handle the software end of things was
sufficient, but making perl 6 a reality is a much larger task than we'd
originally figured, as both Perl 6 the language and Parrot the
interpreter have ended up bigger than we'd thought they'd be. Bigger,
in fact, than one person can reasonably manage, especially with a
volunteer project.</i>"</p>
<p><i>"Hence, the call. Got people skills? Can you organize? Competently
<b>design</b> code? Got free time?  Work with people who are, well, Larry?
Cool, this is for you. You don't have to be a star programmer, nor a
parser or compiler whiz, though that certainly won't hurt.
Enthusiasm's what you need, as there are people willing to help you
out with the rest.
</i><p><i>
There are plenty of things you don't have to worry about. You don't
have to worry about the language design--that's Larry's job. Nor do
you have to worry about the interpreter engine--that's Dan's
job. What you'll have to do is get the Perl 6 compiler module, and
its standard library, designed and implemented.
</i></p><p><i>
It's a big job, but someone has to do it, and that someone could be
you. (As a bonus, you get your own Secret Perl Cabal membership card
and Decoder ring!) If you're interested, make your pitch to our
esteemed, and mostly sane, Perl 6 manager-type person Allison Randal,
at <a href="mailto:allison@perl.org">allison@perl.org</a>.
</i></p><p><i>
Good luck!"</i></p></p>
