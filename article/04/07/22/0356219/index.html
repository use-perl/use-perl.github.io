I know it has problems, but that two-click paypal payment process is sweet. No time for buyers remorse<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

<h2>The Perl Review availability</h2>

Hi, guys.<br/><br/>I must have missed a posting quite some time ago regarding a change to The Perl Review. I did read about brian's hiatus due to his deployment to Iraq. I think it is cool that they are going to be printing actual hard-copy issues. Some questions:<br/><br/><ol>
<li> Is this only for new issues, or will old issues also be issued in print?</li>
<li> Will new issues be made available in an online format of some form (PDF, HTML, etc)?
This is important for searching, cut/paste,
reference, etc.</li>
<li> If new issues will be made available online, will they be available only to subscribers or to all?</li>
</ol><br/><br/>Anyway, thanks for filling in about the new plans for TPR.

Understanding that I don't know everything yet, and that I'm doing this is my spare time mostly by myself, here are some answers.<br> <br>1. New issues will be in print.  Old issues might be in print, and I even thought of having the first print issue be an old issue, but the content is all new.  I'd like to do old issues in print, but I need to get some money to do that, and then fix up the page-count to end up with a multiple of four.  I haven't made any definite plans for that, but if enough people are interested, I can do it pretty easily I think.<br> <br>2. New issues will be available as PDFs to subscribers for sure, and maybe as HTML.  We're working on that now.  At the moment, the article content belongs to the authors, so they are free to post them on their own websites, too.<br> <br>3. I haven't figured out how to make the stuff available online.  If some people are paying for it, then they need to get some benefit not available to the people who aren't paying. Maybe there is a way that I can offer an "online-only" subscription if enough people are interested in that, which might work out better for the international subscribers.  That's a lot of work on my part to set up the stuff to manage that, though, so I would need the time to do it.  I should also note that I haven't made any money off  of TPR, and don't see myself getting any money from in this year.  Anything I get goes to bills and the other people who do work for TPR.  That means I have to spend a lot of time doing other work so I can pay the rent and eat.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
