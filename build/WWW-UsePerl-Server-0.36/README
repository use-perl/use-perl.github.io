NAME
    WWW::UsePerl::Server - Serve use.perl.org content

SYNOPSIS
        script/www_useperl_server_server.pl

DESCRIPTION
    use.perl.org was a Perl-specific blogging website created by Chris
    Nandor and hosted at Geeknet. It was up from early 2001 until late 2010.
    This is project along the lines of Archive Team
    (http://www.archiveteam.org) to save historical Perl websites and keep
    the content going. Using this module you can host your own use.perl.org
    mirror.

    You'll need a MySQL server. Update www_useperl_server.conf with the
    database connection details. Then import the (26MB compressed, 94MB
    uncompressed) database dump from:

        https://s3.amazonaws.com/useperl/useperl-2012-04-29.sql.bz2

    And run script/www_useperl_server_server.pl.
