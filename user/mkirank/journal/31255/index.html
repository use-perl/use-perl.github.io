<p>Though I am registered here for sometime ,this is my first Journal entry .. Yay! <br><br/><br/><br>
<i> some thoughts </i> <br>
<a href='http://foss.in/2006/info/Main_Page'> FOSS.IN </a> Is one of the biggest Open source conference in India , I had a chance to attend this in 2003. Its a pretty nice conference and each year speakers from around the world are invited to speak here, last year among their speakers were Alan Cox and Rasmus Lerdorf  <br>
  I was looking at the schedules in <a href='http://foss.in/2005/schedules/'> 2005 </a> and <a href='http://linux-bangalore.org/2004/schedules/'> 2004 </a> and  was disappointed not to find any Perl talks (hope there is one this year), there are Ruby ,Python and PHP talks , there is a <a href='http://rbconf.in/'> Ruby Conf </a> scheduled to be held soon (I'm going to miss all of these  :-( ).. I know there are some pretty good Ruby ,PHP and Python hackers there but not too many working on perl 
<br> I guess this is a pretty good market for Perl books and training {hint}. I know some trainers there who claim to know "PERL" and recommend some "PERL" books  <br> Unlike here in the US we do not get Perl books as soon as they are released, it takes a few months  , I had to order Higher Order Perl and Perl Best practices through amazon to be shipped in july last year and its pretty expensive to do it that way . <br>
I am curious to know how perl books sell in India compared to other languages ?.

Some Interesting Links
<br>
 Column in <a href='http://lwn.net/Articles/162669/'> LWN </a> by Jonathan Corbet was one of the speakers at the event, this give a pretty good Insight on the Indian software community
 <br>
Take a look at <a href='http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-5868620777191639992&q=FOSS.IN'> This Video </a> this line is to register for the conference .

<h2>Website Statistics</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/chromatic/">chromatic</a> on 2006-10-09T01:15:00</h3>
<p>I don't know about books, but India is the country with the second-largest number of visits to Perl.com.  The number of visits is perhaps a quarter the size of the number of visits from US IP addresses, but it's a fair percentage larger than the third place country (usually the UK).</p>
