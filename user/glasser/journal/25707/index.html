<div class="span8">
<p>You know what I hate? blib.<br/><br/>You see, I almost exclusively write pure-Perl modules.  Thus, the "make" step always consists of making a structure under "blib" that consists mostly of empty directories, copying all my .pms into "blib/lib", and manifying pods into blib/man3.<br/><br/>This is useless for me while developing.  I don't actually care about manifying PODs until I'm ready to "make install" anyway.  And copying the modules just means that sometimes blib/lib is out of date when I'm running "prove" (or even "make test", if I just made a new module and haven't reran Makefile.PL yet), and more annoyingly they show up in every grep, and have to be ignored by version control, etc.<br/><br/>I suppose part of my annoyance would be fixed by making a shell script that uses "prove -l" to simulate the effect of "make test" using modules from "lib" instead of "blib/lib", and just never run "make" or "make test" while developing.  But still.  Ugh.</p>

<h2>A plug for Test::Verbose</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Matts/">Matts</a> on 2005-07-14T16:59:48</h3>
prove is very similar (in my opinion not as good, but I don't mean that as anything against the prove developers) to the "tv" command from Test::Verbose. This might fit your needs better as it's an interface to "make test" rather than something that runs the tests directly. Try it and see if you like it.



<h2>prove++</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jplindstrom/">jplindstrom</a> on 2005-07-14T17:28:48</h3>
I usually just run prove from within the t directory and put a<blockquote><div> <tt>use lib "../lib";</tt> </div></blockquote>in each test file.

<code>prove</code> respects the <code>-I</code> command-line option (and you can stack them the same way you can with <code>perl</code> itself):<blockquote><div> <tt>prove -I/some/project/lib -I../lib</tt> </div></blockquote>It also looks for a <code>PROVE_SWITCHES</code> environment variable, which I usually load up with something like this:<blockquote><div> <tt>-I/some/shared/lib -I/my/project/lib</tt> </div></blockquote>This way, I don't have to modify the test scripts at all, and if I use absolute paths, I can run the tests from whatever directory I happen to be in at the time.
