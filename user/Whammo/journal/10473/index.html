The garden of the dark<br></i>

</blockquote>


<p>Far across the Pacific, the United States military, having once fought
alongside local militants to oust an oppressive colonial regime, were now
finding themselves fighting against these same forces, organized by an
extremely popular and charismatic leader.</p>

<p>The war was not going well.  Guerilla warfare in a dense, unforgiving 
jungle gave a decided edge to the locals.  Diseases decimated the U.S.
forces.  Morale among the troops, few of whom volunteered for this war, was
at an all-time low.  Discipline among  the ranks was non-existent.  Back
home, anti-war sentiment was ever increasing, and was quickly blamed for
prolonging the war.  No one  really understood for what the U.S. was
fighting.  There was no strategic military advantage to be gained, and no
American corporate interests to protect.</p>

<p>American reporters covering the war described it as a never-ending battle,
recapturing the same hills and villages over and over and over.   Field
commanders, under pressure for positive results, invented enemy casualty
statistics.  Reports that the war was not going well were censored.</p>

<p>And the war wasn't going well.</p>

<p>There were no front lines.  There was no friendly territory.   The enemy
"gooks" were indistinguishable from the civilian population that they
blended in with.  Eventually, American generals had to institute what
amounted to no more than concentration camps - anyone outside these areas
were considered combatants.  The generals also instituted a scorched
earth policy.  Burned jungle and villages.  Indiscriminate killing of the
local populations.  No prisoners. It's estimated that anywhere between
200,000 and 700,000 local inhabitants died from combat, starvation, and
disease.</p>

<p>And on it went.  Although it's difficult to say exactly how long the war
lasted, it certainly lasted longer than what the history books or the 
American government commonly say.  Instead, close to seventeen years passed
between the first and last American military actions.</p>

<p>It appears that war may be upon us once again.  Although the U.S. has
been extremely successful - comparatively speaking - in the last two 
decades of conflict, it's imperative that people do not forget what
an absolutely horrific institution war can be.</p>

<p>Oh, the war above?  The oft-forgotten Philippine-American War.  Starting in 
1898 as part of the Spanish-American war, significant military action
continued well into World War I.  Less than fifty years later, the U.S.
would do it all over again in Vietnam.</p></p>
