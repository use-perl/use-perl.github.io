"From tree to tree, from you to me<BR>
Traveling twice as fast as on any freeway<BR>
Every single dream, wrapped up in the scheme<BR>

-- The Who 
</BLOCKQUOTE><br/><br/><P>In no particular order:</P><br/><br/><P>If you feel compelled to explain at great length why the
unsolicited sales pitch sitting in my mailbox is not spam, it
probably is.  It may be <I>legal</I>, but it is still spam,
much the same way that justifiable homicide is still homicide.
By the way, "opt in" implies that I make that choice, not you,
the sender of the message.  And "opt out" is a full transaction
- having mail sent to a perpetually full mailbox does not qualify.</P><br/><br/><P>If you feel compelled to tell me that I should be happy
with the service I am receiving, I'm probably not.</P><br/><br/><P>If you feel compelled to add small print that refutes
everything else in an ad but the print itself, it's false
advertising.  Superlatives imply a common baseline for comparisons.  If you choose to 
gerrymander demographics, or manipulate statistics, until you
can find some category that you lead, omitting such facts is 
simply a falsehood.  And auto manufacturers, it is not at all inspiring to
see you show off your latest creation by having it slide sideways around a
corner, slow motion or no.</P><br/><br/><P>If you feel compelled to offer apologies in advance of some
words or action, you've no business following through.  If you'll
feel sorry, you shouldn't do it.  If it needs to be done, you
shouldn't feel sorry for having to do it.</P><br/><br/><P>If you feel compelled to leave a bitterly-worded attack on my
answering machine in response to my "no telephone solicitation" message, 
consider why I don't talk to you.</P><br/><br/><P>If you feel compelled to tell me that you can "better my career",
it's first necessary to understand where I'm at currently.  Knowing what
career I have would help, too.</P><br/><br/><P>If you understand my needs and wants so well, why don't you offer
anything to satisfy either one?</P><br/><br/><P>It's not my duty to support <I>your</I> personal economy.  It's not my fault 
that your chosen profession has nothing to offer me.
The Reaganomics era ended long ago.</P></p>
