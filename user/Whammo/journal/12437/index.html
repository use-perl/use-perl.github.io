"On this Memorial Day<br>
We sit out on our decks and party<br>
Three days we've got off from work<br>
With burgers on the barbie<br>
<br>
But if you take a moment to reflect<br>
Away from your party scene<br>
The radio will remind you<br>
What this day truly means<br>
<br>
It's time to save, I said save, on a waterbed<br>
It's time to choose a great mattress<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;at an even greater price<br>
I got two words for you, that's "Tire Sale"<br>
We got rock bottom prices,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;and the time is running out<br>
<br>
You get one full year, that's right, one full year<br>
No interest, no payments<br>
There's no way you should miss this sale<br>
This could be the Memorial Day weekend<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;you enjoy for years<br>
And, oh yes, something about guys that died for our country"<br></i>

<h2>Memories And Memorial Day</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/chaoticset/">chaoticset</a> on 2003-05-27T12:59:54</h3>
I got up one Memorial Day and asked myself, plaintively, what I would do in memory.
<p>
I debated about heading out to a parade for a bit.  (I'm not good at this sort of thing, as you can probably tell.)  I finally decided that the people who died did so for me to live, and to attend a parade in their honor probably wouldn't be as good a use of the time as banging  (writing|code|etc.) out.  So I did.  I even ran the idea past my father, who seemed to think it was a fine idea.  He's a vet, so I consider that tacit approval from those honored.</p>
