"Don't look so sad. It's not so bad, you know<BR>
It's just another night. That's all it is<BR>
It's not the first. It's not the worst, you know<BR>
We've come through all the rest. We'll get through this<BR>
<BR>
"We've made mistake, but we've made good friends, too<BR>
Remember all the nights we've spent with them<BR>
And all our plans, who says they can't come true?<BR>
Tonight's another chance to start again<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's just another New Year's Eve, another night like all the rest<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's just another New Year's Eve. Let's make it the best<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's just another New Year's Eve. It's just another auld lang syne<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when we're through, this new year, you'll see, will be just fine<BR>
<BR>
"We're not alone, we've got the world, you know<BR>
And it won't let us down. Just wait and see<BR>
And we'll grow old, but think how wise we'll grow<BR>
There's more, you know. It's only New Year's Eve<BR>

</BLOCKQUOTE><br/><br/><P>Every night I lie awake and think about a day done wrong,
fretting, paralyzed, for hours while overwhelmed with thoughts
of things I should have done and things yet to do, only to wake
exhausted the next morning and lament all that time wasted.  
I even waxed poetic about it - "Late night worries and early
morning regrets."</P><br/><br/><P>That was more than a decade ago, and I still find myself
spending hours a night on self-abuse over tasks that would
take a fraction of the time to accomplish.</P><br/><br/><P>I bounce resolutions off the bathroom mirror every morning.
What my soul needs is a New Year's Revolution.</P></p>
