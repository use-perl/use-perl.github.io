Oh, sure, there's a lot of <I>things</I> that are often packaged
with OO that I like.  Method and operator overloading.  Inheritence.  Data
encapsulation.  (Although not strict encapsulation.  It's painful

Chop off the newline!  Print that string out!  None of this, 
"String, be read", "String, be chomped", or "String, be printed."

from the string", and "Output, be receptive to the contents 
given by string."?</P><br/><br/><P><I>A lot of people like the syntax.  It's so clean.

believe that, do you?  Do you normally communicate that way?
Do you normally <I>think</I> that way?  "I, these two numbers, 
will add."  Of course not.  That's why you still see the very 
"procedurish" 'a = b + c' in OO code.</P><br/><br/><P><I>Except that '+' is probably an overloaded method of one of 
the classes.</I></P><br/><br/><P>I said I like overloading.  But tell me this:</P><br/><br/>If you can overload an operator and still
make it procedurish, why can't you do it with a regular method?
You can still have all the good things normally associated with 
(but not necessarily limited to) traditional OO languages, but
keep a more standard procedural syntax.  Why isn't there a language
that balances the two, instead of the Jeckyl and Hyde nature of
object-centric syntax?</P><br/><br/><P>Oh, wait.  There is.</P><br/><br/><P>Perl.</P><br/><br/><P>Indirect object syntax.</P><br/><br/><P>Which no one likes.</P><br/><br/><P>Except, apparently, for me.</P>

<h2>Wrong premise</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Matts/">Matts</a> on 2001-12-11T11:00:30</h3>
I think you *do* like object oriented code. You just don't like the syntax.
<br>
<br>Moreover, I think you might like it better if you thought in terms of message passing. You pass an object a message to frobnosticate, and it obeys.
<br>
<br>Besides, not everything should look OO, it's just a good design pattern for the underlying system. Read the internals section of the pickaxe book and you'll see what I mean - I'm willing to bet it would be impossible to explain Perl's internals in such a short section.
<br>
<br>But we should still be pragmatic. Yes, a + b should still look like a + b. It just makes sense that way. How it's implemented internally though is of consistency and beauty (in ruby's case).
<br>
<br>Besides, processors work procedurally, not OO (well, these days they do funky parallel stuff, but I digress), so it would be impossible to be procedural all the way down to the bare metal. It's just a useful tool to layer over procedural code.
