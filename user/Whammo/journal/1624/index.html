</BLOCKQUOTE><br/><br/><P>And ramble I shall.  The train of thought is leaving the
station.  Destination, unknown.  This is the ride I've been
taking the past couple of weeks.</P><br/><br/><P>Perl Virtual Filesystems.  NFS.  RPC.  XDR.  Portable floats.
<A HREF="http://archive.develooper.com/perl6-internals@perl.org/msg06918.html">
Portable Parrot bytecode</A>.  Portable floats, again.
64 bit support.  <I>Only</I> having 64 bit support.  Swapping
x86 arbitrary data with only word-addressed, 64 bit support.
Noticing that only having word-addressed, 64 bit support is rare - 
just the Cray vector processor, a strange beast, she.  Why did I consider it 
in the first place?  Why do we consider
<I>anything</I> outside the norm?  How much more normal is the
norm since when Perl began?  How much more normal will 
the world be by the time we get Parrot done for the non-normal 
machines?  If no one is providing new uses for old
hardware, what has changed to require a new version of Perl?  
Perl 6 should relegate hardware and operating systems that
are unsupported today to Bastard Stepchildren status, and not 
code for them anymore. Where is Schwern doing his StrongARM
testing?  I've not specced out <I>that</I> hardware yet.  I like
hardware.  Still want to get an SGI, but an Alpha is looking
better and better.  But OS X is still on my list, too.  I wonder
what's new in the journals?  (If you have a text reader, it should
be out of breath about now.)</P><br/><br/><P>All that is squeezed between work sessions, which, as those
of you hanging out in #parrot know, has been coming at strange times.
Speaking of work, a hearty thanks to J. Chris "Jestyr" Edillon, 
who's been doing my Cray and Tru64 testing for me.</P><br/><br/><P>Of course, I've got it all tested, but not implemented yet.  What's
taking so long, besides that I spend all my time writing journal
entries?</P><br/><br/><P>I'm slow.  I'm paranoid.  I still suffer from perfectionism, 
particularly when I've little confidence.  (I'm actually a 
pretty smart guy, but my entire life is spent surrounded by 
people more intelligent and more knowing than I.  Mostly by 
choice.  The Perl and Parrot circle is no different.  
A lot of knowledge.  A lot of brainpower.  It does,
however, have the side effect of making me <I>feel</I> like an
Idiot.)</P><br/><br/><P>Which is why I read Slashdot.  Nothing like a gross of absurdly
inaccurate user commentary on a subject that I actually know 
something about to make me feel like part of the intelligentsia.</P><br/><br/><P>Of course, some would say I engage in my own acts of 
<A HREF="http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2001/12/p6pdigest/20011208.html>
absurdly inaccurate user commentary</A>.  But I'm pleased anyway
that Simon was able to squeeze it into his schedule.</P><br/><br/><P>Whew.  Was that a whole lot of nothing, or what?</P></p>
