</BLOCKQUOTE><br/><br/><P>Have you ever stopped to think how shallow gratitude is?</P><br/><br/><P>Not shallow as a measure of sincerity, but shallow as a measure
of the depth the gratitude reaches.  The family whose house is
saved by the quick response of emergency personnel is often
extremely grateful for the responding crews, but rarely give
a moment's thought beyond that.</P><br/><br/><P>The makers of the equipment used to get the phone call to 
the fire department.  The manufacturer of the hoses used to
deliver the water from an incredibly complex pipeline
infrastructure.  The developers who improve the protective gear
to allow safer, protracted battles against Mother Nature's
forces.</P><br/><br/><P>For those of you who are prone to worrying, relax.  There was
no fire.  It's an analogy.</P><br/><br/><P>We've all become accustomed to self-reliance, without 
necessarily giving proper credit to the foundations of our
success.  That's one of the many cool things about Perl -
Perl provides an avenue for such expression - 
<B>perl-thanks@perl.org</B>.</P><br/><br/><P>Anyway, thanks have been coming my way for some "miracles" I
was called upon to perform, and I just wanted to pass them on
to those also deserving - the Perl community.</P><br/><br/><P>(Forwarded to perl-thanks@perl.org)</P></p>
