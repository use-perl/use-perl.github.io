"I never did believe in miracles<BR>
But I've a feeling it's time to try<BR>
I never did believe in the ways of magic<BR>
But I'm beginning to wonder why"<BR></I>
-- Fleetwood Mac
</BLOCKQUOTE><br/><br/><P>We've added a new player to my coed volleyball team, so I
decided I was going to redo the game plan with animated GIFs, 
rather than redistribute the old ASCII drawings I normally do.  (My scheme
is actually a little simpler than the standard coed lineup, but 
because it's not the <I>standard</I>, it takes some 
getting used to.) The benefits are a lot more noticeable when
you can see the plan in transition, rather than some before and
after shots.</P><br/><br/><P>I wasn't looking forward to a lot of hand-poking in GIMP, though.
That's when I remembered I had Wallace's book on Programming Web
Graphics.  A quick install of ImageMagick and PerlMagick from 
my cooker mirror, and a half-hour of reading and experimenting
later, and I'd less than a hundred lines of Perl churning out
plays in the amount of time it takes to update the start and
end coords.  I never would have thought it would be this easy.
Now I need to do all the writeups, and
I should have it up by tomorrow.</P><br/><br/><P>On a side note: about half the time, the lyrics I preface my
entries with pop into my brain as I write the entry.  Most of the 
rest of the time, I have to do several rounds with my jukebox
(20 songs at a pop) to find something fitting.  Every once in
a while, I'll get lucky on the first queueing.  Tonight's song was 
number one on the play list.</P></p>

<br>
<br>I've been enjoying your selection of lyrics all along.  More then half the time I'm humming the melody before I get to the body of your message.
<br>
<br>Thank you.
