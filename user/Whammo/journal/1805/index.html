<h2>Latin is, indeed, useful</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/hfb/">hfb</a> on 2001-12-28T07:10:42</h3>
<p>Latin was a feature of my particular post vatican ii education...close to 8 years of it which came in handy for everything from science and medical terminology to english vocabulary and spelling bees. It is utterly useless for anything Finnish though.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<p>Get the CUP Latin I course or go to a university bookstore near you and see what, if any, latin texts they have on hand. Brush up on your English grammar as it will help as well. Wheelock's is OK if there's nothing else around. It's a fun language and you'll get to see what real bores lawyers and doctors are when they try and be witty in Latin at cocktail parties<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) </p>



<h2>Rome's influence</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/kellymich/">kellymich</a> on 2006-12-08T22:19:08</h3>
Very interesting the origin of the word decimation.<br/><br/>Rome's influence on  culture, law, technology, arts, language, religion, government, military, and architecture of Western civilization is a continuing legacy more than one thousand, five hundred years after the Empire ceased to exist &#8230; I don&#8217;t think we can so easilly write off rome's achievements.<br/><br/>During the Christmas passion play, even as a child, I was on the side of the romans.:)<br/><br/>That skinny dude floating in the air just didn&#8217;t do it for me. My mother always shed a few tears though.
