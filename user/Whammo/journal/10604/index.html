"I've been lost now<br>
Days uncounted<br>
And it's months since</br>
I've seen home."<br></i>
-- Grand Funk Railroad
</blockquote>

<p>I'm going through one of those phases where I'm having to do so many ill-advised and non-sensical tasks for work, that I want little to do with computers when I get home.  That hasn't been much of a problem the past year or so, as I've been so busy at work to not have the time to worry about working at home.  But I've now been reassigned out of operations into architecture and planning, which is going to shake things up.</p>

<p>First off, I'll probably have more time.  And in being in a strategic (vice tactical) technical spot, the lack of "hands-on" geeking will probably relight my personal fires.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I am further away from what I love to do, and I get an even <i>bigger</i> picture of all the things that are screwed up.  And the futility of the big picture has always demotivated me in the past.</p>

<p>While I realign myself, I've been doing some reading, mostly U.S. history.  (There's something healing about knowing the world has always been screwed up.)  The current book is <i>Presidential Ambition</i> by <a href="http://home.sprynet.com/user/rshenkman/">Richard Shenkman</a>.  I also just recently
discovered <a href="http://www.uvm.edu/user/jloewen/">James Loewen</a>.</p>

<p>For all you "old fogies" out there, is it normal to feel like you're getting stupid as your rate of learning slows down?  I'm 31, and feel like I'm dumb as a rock.</p>
