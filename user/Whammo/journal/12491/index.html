<p>Woke up from a round of intense nightmares to find a whole slew of mail I sent out last night was deferred because of mail server rejection.  All of the mail were sent to folks at comcast.net.  (I'm on comcast.net.)</p>

<p>After waking up sufficiently to realize that meant my mail hadn't gone through, I assumed that Comcast had finally gotten on the ball about spam prevention, and was rejecting me based on my envelope sender.  (It happens on occasion, as I use... er, used an unresolvable host.)</p>

<p>So I figured I'd have to bite the bullet and finally configure my envelope correctly, which I should have done long ago as a good netizen.  Even though I can't actually receive any mail anyway.  Flush the queue, and...</p>

<p>Mail rejected.</p>

<p>So now I'm thinking... oh ho!*  This is Comcast.  Their server is just probably down.  (I'm still mostly asleep, and am having a hard time remembering the various deferment messages given for each scenario.)<p>

<p>So then I telnet to 25 on the mail exchanger that's crapping out on me.</p>

<pre>
telnet mx00.comcast.net 25
Trying 24.153.64.1...
Connected to mx00.comcast.net (24.153.64.1).
Escape character is '^]'.
571 Comcast.net subscribers are no longer permitted to directly connect to this mail server. To send email to other Comcast.net subscribers, you may forward messages through smtp.comcast.net.
Connection closed by foreign host.
</pre>

<p>Mmmm.... makes you wonder what MX records are for.</p>

<p>Okay, okay, okay.  At least they gave helpful instructions.  So I read through the incredibly verbose comments in the various postfix configuration files, set up my transport to send all comcast mail directly to smtp.comcast.net, and flush the queue.</p>

<p>So why isn't it working?</p>

<p>All those instructions, and not a single mention of how to get <code>main.cf</code> to read a separate <code>transport</code> map.  Thanks, Google.  Mail's away.</p>

<br>

<p>*That's how I think when I'm tired.</p>
