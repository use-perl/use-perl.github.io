<p>Does anyone have any recommendations for DNS management software?  I'm looking for something that can backend both BIND and Active Directory,
and support 100,000+ RRs in 1,000+ zones across two dozen views.</p>

Dear Whammo,<p>
Out of sheer curiosity... why the original journal style ? More specifically, why all your subjects are words even my dictionary fails to recognize, and each entry starts with a short song ?</p><p>
Do you keep a list of weird words and short songs somewhere ?</p>



<h2>Dear Spur...</h2>

<p>I'll give you four answers.  Choose which one you like the best.  Or choose more than one.</p>

<ol> <li>Why not?</li>
<li>What?  Don't you like it?</li>
<li>No sense in both the content <i>and</i> the format being boring!  Gotta have a catch.  Something persistent that provides some continuity.  Like TorgoX's "Dear Log,".</li>
<li>Because I talk and act like that.  Really.  It annoys the hell out of my coworkers, that's for sure.  Someone will say something, like in a meeting, that is (or is at least reminiscent of) the lyrics from some song.  I'll react immediately by singing the appropriate line or verse.  It's a compulsion. Somewhere between some and most of the entries the songs reflect that connection to the topic.  Others are just whatever happens to be playing at the time.  The words.... well, I suck at thinking up clever, decriptive titles.  Although most of the time the titles do fit.  Isn't English wonderful?</li>
</ol>
<p>Like I said, the music is mostly free association, and, yes, RIAA, most of it is music I actually own.  If a tune comes to mind and I don't have it, then I'll Google for it.  (Which is why the lyrics are sometimes wrong!)</p>
<p>The words are hardly ever free association, but are normally the result of looking at random through various dictionaries and thesauruses for something appropriate.  They're all words.  Well, most of them are words.  I probably cheated a bit with words like Suidaeic.  (Porcine, from 'Suidae'  [the family that includes pigs] + '-ic')</p>
