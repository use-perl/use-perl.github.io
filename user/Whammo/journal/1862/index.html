</BLOCKQUOTE><br/><br/><P>The wonderful people of <A HREF="http://www.xiph.org">Xiph</A>
annouced RC3 of <A HREF="http://www.xiph.org/ogg/vorbis/index.html">Ogg Vorbis</A> 1.0 yesterday.  Most of the code
base has been frozen, with a few tweaks on the algorithms 
left open.</P>  <br/><br/><P>Now, as if you couldn't tell, I'm a music junkie.  I listen to a
wide variety of styles, and have tunes running constantly.  I recently replaced
a worn-out Pioneer cartridge changer with a Sony 300 CD carousel, 
but the general unhappiness with the interface convinced me not 
to buy a second to hold the rest of
my collection.  Instead, I bought a 60 gig hard drive, and
began investigating audio codecs.</P><br/><br/><P>I considered just buying a rack of drives and ripping all the
audio natively, but decided that compression was more desirable 
from a portable device perspective.  Although VCF's sizes were impressive, I felt its quality was about
that of MP3, which I felt was worse than Ogg at comparable bit-rates.
Plus, I liked the openness of the Vorbis standard, which meant 
I wouldn't need to recode my music every other year.  (Choosing
to is another matter.  :-)  This was
also around the time that Microsoft said they would deliberately 
downgrade MP3 quality in favor of WMA.)</P><br/><br/><P>So until I slap a database back-end on the collection (5500+ 
tracks over 18 gigs, with about two dozen CDs I need to repair 
before I can rip), I've been using a dumb randomizer to mix 
my tracks, and running them through XMMS on my primary Linux box.
Eventually, however, I want to be able to pipe them through the
stereo, and possibly beyond.</P><br/><br/><P>So it was exciting to see that <A HREF="http://www.icecast.org/">Icecast</A> 2.0 is also nearing 
completion.  (2.0 will provide streaming support for Vorbis.)
So I grabbed the latest from CVS and had at it.</P><br/><br/><P>I'm guessing they <I>really</I> want you on their mailing list,
because there is little documentation beyond configure and make.
I could only assume that functionality didn't change all that much,
and that they assumed I knew what that functionality was.</P><br/><br/><P>But I got it working (locally) in a couple hours or so. And after 
tackling my first iptables DNAT configuration, I managed to hold 
my first successful broadcast.  This holds promise.  (But what does
a simple audio streamer need with a quarter of my Athlon 1 GHZ?)</P></p>

<h2>Ripping CDs</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ziggy/">ziggy</a> on 2002-01-02T14:55:06</h3>
The first time I heard MP3s many years ago, I was surprised at the incredibly low sonic quality.  I tried ripping some CDs about a year and a half later, but still got some pretty bad sound.  Apparently, the issue revolved around bad encoders and bad encoding rather than limitations of the format.
<p>
Once I decided to start ripping CDs, I played with a few schemes, until finally settling on a two-step process:
</p><ul>
<li>Copy the raw audio files from a series of CDs</li>
<li>Convert everything in the queue, deleting the raw audio after each CD is converted</li>
</ul>
There are a couple of advantages here: copying a raw CD takes significantly less time than encoding it, so it's a more effective use of time when you're changing CDs.  Secondly, you can schedule the ripping when you're at work or otherwise not using the disk+cpu.  This also gave me enough freedom to put the id3 tags on the MP3s just the way I wanted them (munging artists and titles as required).
<p>
Oh, I also created a playlist for each CD, a playlist by artist and a playlist for everything in the collection.  The third playlist is always loaded in xmms, usually set to random play.
</p><p>
The process isn't overly tedious, although I stopped at about 70 cds.  Need to continue at some point...</p>
