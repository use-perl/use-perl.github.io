"Domo Arigato, Mr. Roboto"<BR></I>
-- Styx
</BLOCKQUOTE><br/><br/><P>It's a harried, digital, disposable world.  But there's been 
three unexpected bright spots in recent weeks, and I thought I'd
share them.</P><br/><br/><P>Firstly, in a fit of frenzied cleaning, I decided to wash one of
my jackets - some synthetic job from L.L. Bean.  Unbeknownst
to me until <I>after</I> a lengthy wash and machine dry, my 
cell phone - a Motorola StarTAC - was in the pocket.  
Motorola has always made good stuff, but it was still quite the
pleasant surprise to find it still works perfectly.</P><br/><br/><P>Secondly, I left for work right when the US Postal Service 
pulled up to drop off my mail.  I walked up to the driver to 
collect the mail personally, and he asked, ever so friendly, 
how the original owners - except, of course, he asked about 
them by name - were doing and when they were expected to return.  
Now, for all I know, the local post office has been doing 
nothing but bouncing mail for them for two years solid, and my 
friends' name is often used only in the presence of expletives.  
But I found it impressive nonetheless, this mail carrier in
the Baltimore/Washington metropolitan area, in this time of 
antrax letters and the Christmas rush.</P><br/><br/><P>Finally, C-SPAN, of all stations, had an excellent special on
the <I>USS Bonhomme Richard</I> (LHD-6) and the 13th MEU(SOC)
last night.  No war-mongering.  No over-the-top heroics.  Just a 
decent representation of oft-detested people doing 
a difficult and unglorious job.  Makes me wonder where I would 
be under different circumstances.</P></p>
