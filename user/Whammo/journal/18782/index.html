<p>So after a long hiatus - one where my number of machines was actually decreasing through attrition - I laid down a surprisingly small chunk of change for a dual Opteron system to play around with.  I've got the base AMD64 <a href="www.gentoo.org">Gentoo</a> distro installed, but other diversions have kept me from going any further than kernel tweaking.</p>

<p>One of those diversions I'm ignoring right at this moment, and that's school.  Again.  For the seventh time.  Computer architecture.  The first section on constructing digital circuits was interesting, but we're now back into all the stuff I know already.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Just do it already, you undisciplined fuck.</p>

<p>And I have to.  Well, not really.  But I want to.  I've just got to realize that.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.easports.com/games/mvp2004/">EA Sports MVP Baseball 2004</a>.  I was pretty hooked for a while until I started playing in Dynasty Mode.  Midway through the season, the in-game email system starts <i>spamming</i> me.  And I don't mean the fake spams that they threw in as a joke.</p>

<p>Went to my friends' daughter's elementary school band concert last Thursday.  Ahhh, the memories.  These were 4th and 5th graders in their first and second years of band, and the bands actually had an oboe, a bassoon, and a bass clarinet.  Ohio takes their <a href="http://www.omea-ohio.org/">music education</a> way too seriously, and I can't recall <i>their</i> elementary programs teaching double reeds.  They also had a jazz band, which did quite an incredible job (relatively speaking) on <a href="http://www.santana.com">Santana</a>'s <i>Evil Ways</i>.</p>

<p>The cicadas erupted Saturday.  Sounded like a UFO landing.  Not that I know what a UFO sounds like, or could differentiate the sound of one landing from say, hovering or taking off.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0069947/"><i>Day Of The Jackal</i></a> was on <a href="http://www.turnerclassicmovies.com/">TCM</a>.  I more stared at it than watched it.  The most cogent thought I had inspired from the movie?  The French tanks looked like octopusses on treads.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cartoonnetwork.com">Cartoon Network</a> also had the 1977 animated <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077687/"><i>The Hobbit</i></a>.  Death was represented by kaleidoscope spinning images.  I think we should go back to that.</p>

<p>Let's see, is there anything else to ramble on about?  I guess not.  Maybe I should cut my hair.</p>
