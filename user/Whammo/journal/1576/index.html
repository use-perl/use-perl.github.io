"You draw to the curtain<BR>
And one thing's for certain<BR>
You're cozy in your little room"<BR></I>
-- Elton John
</BLOCKQUOTE><br/><br/><P>Plaster and lath doesn't make good insulation.  I live in an
84 year old
house that's undergone numerous transformations - conversion
to and from a duplex, moved staircases, and some interesting 
examples of period construction ("I can't construct a damn thing.
Period!").  Just about everything has been remodeled or redone
except for the exterior walls and windows.  (Slated for
replacement when the owners return.)</P><br/><br/><P>I've gas baseboard heating, which ever-so-conveniently lines 
the outer walls, so in a typical Maryland winter, I've a 2500 
square foot cold sink.  Set the thermostat at the recommended 
68F?  The heating system can't keep up, and the gas bills top 
$300 a month. I've set it at 58F, and my gas bills still approach $150 a 
month. I do have a couple space heaters, but the ones that 
really pump out the heat aren't safe to
leave unattended, and the saftey heaters don't generate enough
to heat a room.  That can make for some pretty chilly nights.</P><br/><br/><P>So I've taken to sleeping in my computer room.  I've usually two
computers running full-time, but sometimes as many as five, with
the appropriate complement of monitors, switches, and other 
electronic gizmos.  I've got enough green LEDs lit to rival any
nightlight, enough fans whirring to rival any white-noise machine,
and the room is consistently several degrees warmer that the
rest of the house.  (As an aside, I lost a couple of degrees when
I switched my main monitor from a CRT to an LCD.)  The electricity
cost of running my lab?  About $38.</P><br/><br/><P>Open Source development as an alternate heat source.</P></p>
