<p><p>Given that I have no experience with a successful startup, you should listen to me when I say:
<blockquote>
<b>Now is a very, very good time to create a startup.</b>
</blockquote>
<p>Why? Life continues and VCs still need to invest cash. That's what they do. They need startups as much as programmers and young businesses need cash. It's a fatal attraction. 

<p>There's a lot of interest in Bioinformatics - the awkward marriage of biology and information manipulation. Rather than have programming biologists, Biotech firms ought to consider pairing up biologists and programmers. The right tool for the right job, I say. 

<p>Microsoft, IBM and Sun are very interested in developing Web Services (.NET, Sun ONE, etc.). If you haven't looked into SOAP or XML-RPC, now would be a good time to do that. 

<p>Cringley points out in his column this week that many hi-tech companies are trying to provide anti-terrorist solutions. I'm not sure that such devices will ultimately succeed, but there's to be made money in trying. 

<p>Let's not forget that many companies will probably be upgrading their dated PC hardware this year too. Companies like Dell and, well, Dell, should do well. (Compaq and HP are hosed, I think).

<p>I feel the US ecomony is about to gush back to life. 2002 should end very strongly. Now, if only I didn't enjoy being unemployed so much...</p>

<h2>Hope Springs Eternal</h2>

I hope you're right, though.  The local game shop is closing down, and if my friend/client can set up a physical shop soon, it may become a viable business.
