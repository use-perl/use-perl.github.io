It's always something. I got a copy of an O'Reilly book for
tech review today. I need to read it in the next two weeks,
type up my notes, and send them in. I am glad that I
decided not to actually work on writing this book, because
I can barely find time to review it. Tonight I try to do
some cleanup for MacPerl 5.6.1b2 (I expect its release
before November). I am slightly discouraged as I find more
bugs for MacPerl that I cannot fix, and must rely on
Matthias to help me with. Oh well.  whither

FUBAR?	Showing Great Restraint The nms support list just
got an email from a church in Nigeria who confused us with
bible salesmen. I sent them a polite email back pointing
out that they had the wrong address as we didn't sell
bibles. I <i>didn't</i> add the bit that I wanted to, where
I would have told them that we didn't sell bibles as we've
been told it's an evil book by our Lord Beezlebub. I wasn't
sure they'd see the joke.  Do not try this at home I've
been battling insomnia recently. God knows why I can't
sleep, I wish I did. Last night I decided to shave at 3am.
I was bored and couldn't think of anything else to do. I
have trimmers that I use to shave, it's easy, fast and
works better than regular electric shavers. I also have the
attachments for longer trims. I though that the .5 inch one
would be long enough to cut my hair, after all, I needed a
hair cut. Let me tell you, .5 inches of hair is much
smaller than you think. Now I'm all fuzzy on top. It
doesn't look bad, just really different. I'll say it again,
don't do this.	Warchalking <p><a

Trial By Accident Oh, okay, so I forgot I had a test in my
network class. <P> Anyway, while I've got network access, I
figured I'd drop a few notes in here. <P> It suddenly has
occurred to me that it might have been a hell of a lot
easier to have a different separator for the name and the
rest of the data (especially if I ever roll this whole
bunch of files together into one huge combined
inventory/cost file). <P> I think I have an idea of how to
do this. A search in the <B>Perl Cookbook</B> (now that I
have the <B>CD Bookshelf</B> version, it's so friggin'
easy) revealed that I can dump arrays into hashes. If I
make the name of the card the key and the rest of it as a
two-element array, I think my problems are over. I can sort
with that, I can do pretty much all I need to do with it.
(And, despite my whining, I can still work around the
problem of my separators. s/// is supposed to be greedy, so
I'll do a match for the first string that is a bunch of
letters and then a colon, rip that out of the string...no,
wait, the best way to do it would be to make it a step in
reading the file: Rip each line into three parts, then map
that three-element array into one key and one (two-element
array) element in the hash. Once that's all mapped, working
with the hash itself should be pie. <P> I hope. <P> I guess
I'm officially back on track; most of what I'm doing
tonight is going to be scribblework, not typingwork, so I
probably won't post tonight. Got a 7:00 class tomorrow
morning. 7:00-9:45 is Discrete Math and then 10:00-11:20 is
Statistics. Four hours of nearly continual math, math,
math. No wonder I need all that Dew. <P> Oh, and I have
something to scribble *on* now. I can go through a legal
pad in about a month, so I've upgraded: I bought a smallish
dry-erase board, something I can carry around with me and
use like a pad. (Well, except I can't look through my
scribbles. Gotta be careful about keeping good things when
they come up.) It was over at Staples for ten bucks; worth
it, when your legal pad expenses in a year are well into
the double digits. <P> Well, back to the drawing board. ;-)

Cautionary tale <A
HREF="http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/nm/20011224/hl/puff_pot_
1.html">Yahoo reports</A> on chest injuries from a
poorly-designed bong.<P>  Tabula Rasa Fed up with Suse's
lack of gcc, my TV tuner failing under Windows, and the
screwed up file associations in BeOS, I did what any fed-up
computer geek would do - I wiped the hard drive and
reloaded everything. <P> Windows 98 didn't like things so
much the second time around. We'll see how it goes. I can
honestly say the first time around I didn't see a single
BSOD. Hopefully, that trend will continue. I'm a bit
concerned, though, since now I don't seem to be getting
sound in the TV tuner. <P> Suse 8.0 was replaced with
Mandrake 8.2. The TV tuner seems to work. I accidentally
had the VCR on, so at first I thought Mandrake had stuck
some kind of jingle in the startup, but it turned out to be
a TV commercial. Oh, and I have a copy of Suse 8.0 for sale
- cheap. <P> I'll be re-installing BeOS tonight, which
shouldn't take long. I'm gonna take it easy on the software
this time, and only install those apps that I know I'll use
- Process Controller, SoundPlay, StripZilla and BeShare. 
Testing, Testing...Is This Thing On? I started to download
the stable perlbot before I realized I had <EM>already</EM>
downloaded it yesterday. <P> Stop downloading again, start
unpacking. Fiddle fiddle, try the test...no dice. <P> Aha!
Net::IRC! Off to CPAN, and after a very short download and
installation (I should note here that the kindly T.J.
Eckman pointed out the best way to handle Winstallation) I
tested it and promptly worried that I had sent an
unsupervised IRC bot out into the world. <P> I'm going to
do another test. However, many of the perlbot plugins seem
deadly useful, where the Engrishifier is -- let's face it
-- a perhaps funny but utterly pointless thing.  Lessons to

trick While going through John's code (free code review for
John!), I came across this tidbit: <P> <CODE>map(ord,
split('', $word));</CODE> <P> Well, Ruby doesn't have an
'ord()' function, so I used this instead: <P>
<CODE>word.unpack("c*")</CODE> <P> At RubyConf 2002, I
demonstrated that Perl's 'split()' function by itself is
faster than 'unpack()' for splitting words up into chars.
But I figured that a split + map combo would be slower.
Naturally, I did a benchmark. <P> <ECODE> use strict; use
Benchmark; our $word = "Hello"; timethese(1000000,{ 
"unpack" => q{	unpack("c*",$word);  },  "map n split" =>
q{  map(ord, split('', $word));  }, }); Benchmark: timing
1000000 iterations of map n split, unpack... map n split:
29 wallclock secs (26.92 usr + 0.00 sys = 26.92 CPU) @
37147.10/s (n=1000000)	unpack: 5 wallclock secs ( 4.17 usr
+ 0.00 sys = 4.17 CPU) @ 239808.15/s (n=1000000) </ECODE>
<P> John's code only does this once per file IIRC, so no
big deal. Just something to keep in mind. :)  Planting
Metaphors Since I'm usually not smart enough to reinstall
things (even though I keep all the friggin' installation
packages I've ever downloaded), I resort to transplants,
packing the loose soil of a fresh hard drive around the dry
roots of previously installed (and then burned for
archive's sake) programs. <P> Yuck. Note to self: No more
planting metaphors. <P> Copy copy copy, look around,
attempt to run Apache: <BLOCKQUOTE> Syntax error on line 61
of c:/apache group/apache/conf/httpd.conf: ServerRoot must
be a valid directory Note the errors or messages above, and
press the <ESC> key to exit. </BLOCKQUOTE> Wonderful. Time
to locate PFE and get fixin'.  Minor Panic <p>I, of course,
use Linux for most of my day-to-day computing, but Gill
still likes to use Windows. This works fine. She runs
Windows on a laptop and connects to the internet via a
Linux gateway box on the home network.</p> <p>Currently
Gill's studying for a PhD. This involves lots or reading
books and then condensing what she's read into notes that
she writes in Word files. She's three months into the
course and has about 2.5 Mb of data. Being more cautious
than me, she's been asking me for some time to sort out a
way to back up her data - she doesn't to have to retype all
of those notes if anything happens to the laptop.</p>
<p>So, over the weekend, I installed Samba on one of the
Linux boxes and set up a shared directory that she can see
from the Windows box. Now, whenever she wants to backup her
data she can just drag and drop the latest files into the
backup directory.</p> <p>Now, one of the things that I had
to do was to switch on "profiles" on the Windows box[1].
This means that you know have to log on to Windows and
every user that logs on gets their own desktop to configure
to their liking.</p> <p>I explain this to Gill and she goes
off to try it all out whilst I start cooking. Thirty
seconds later, there's a shout from upstairs, "Where have
all my files gone?". I run upstairs to find that the PhD
folder she had on her desktop is no longer there. I start
to explore a few likely areas on the disk but to no avail.
I start to panic slightly - whichh doesn't improve my
problem resolution skills. I'm sure that I didn't delete
anything, but maybe I did it by accident. This looks
nasty.</p> <p>Eventually, I work it out. As Gill is now
logged on as herself, she sees <i>her</i> desktop, not the
default user one that she saw before. Her files are still
there, but on a <i>different</i> desktop. It's simply a
case of finding where Windows has hidden the old desktop
files and moving them to the new desktop directory.
Everyone is happy. And the backup facilty works.</p> <p>But
I thought I was in <i>serious</i> trouble for a while there
:-/</p> <p>[1] Well, maybe I didn't <i>have</i> to do it,
but it certainly seemed the simplest way to set up
Samba.</p>  Homestar fun Dear Log, <p>I just set up this
experimental feed: http://interglacial.com/rss/homestar.rss
<p>It's a list of main files at the <a
href="http://www.homestarrunner.com/">Homestar Runner</a>
site. Not <em>new</em> main files, all main files -- so
it's no good for using as a Slashbox feed. I expect it's
useful in general aggregators tho.  Public radio Dear Log,
<p><blockquote>&laquo;Public radio is riding high. Its
audience has more than doubled in the last decade. About 27
million people now listen to public radio at least once a
week, according to the Radio Research Consortium, a
nonprofit organization that tracks audience data for
noncommercial radio. That's a lot of people. Consider that
Friends, the iconic TV series, has been pulling in around

Cheap-labor conservatives <p><blockquote> &laquo; The ugly
truth is that cheap-labor conservatives just don't like
working people. They don't like "bottom up" prosperity, and
the reason for it is very simple. Lords have a harder time
kicking them around. Once you understand this about the
cheap-labor conservatives, the real motivation for their
policies makes perfect sense. &raquo; </blockquote>
--Conceptual Guerilla: <a
href="http://www.conceptualguerilla.com/">Defeat the Right
in Three Minutes</a> <p>This is so unfair. Labor hurts the
bottom line and they know it. I'm compassionate when I
support cutting social programs because those programs
<i>denegrate</i> the needy. What's so wrong about being
rich and privileged?  That Answers That I guess I need to
get the Wolf Book. :) <P> Had I seen it on a shelf
somewhere I'd have picked it up by now, no doubt. I'll
probably have to order it; the most advanced thing on the
shelf of the local Borders is _Bookshelf_, which I have
already. <P> The sickness is abating; I suspect it'll be
done by the end of today or mid-tomorrow, and that means
back to the grindstone. Halfway through _Man-Month_, but
I'm not doing the depthful reading of my youth, so I should
probably make myself go back and read again.  Weekends This
past weekend my sister flew up from Florida and we drove
over to my grandparent's old place over in northeast
Wisconsin where we met up with my parents and their friends
(who also flew up). The drive is a bit long, but we had a
good time hanging out since we don't see each other that
often. <P> The weather was *perfect* on Saturday. About 75
degrees with a light breeze coming off the lake. We mostly
just hung out, did a little yardwork, and cooked hot dogs
and marshmellows over the fire we had made earlier. Then it
was beer and hanging out by the fire until the stars came
out. <P> Sunday was *hot*. I did a bit of shopping and left
for home after lunch. Hopefully it will cool off again - I
go back on Thursday for the 4th, and my other sister and
her kids will be up by then. :)  Like A Reassembled Clock
From Hell The script is *sort of* working. <P> Which is to
say that it runs (not without error) and it doesn't do what
it used to (surprise, surprise). <P> All of the errors are
'uninitialized value this', and I'm pretty sure I just
missed a few things typing it all in. I kind of expected
that; I give it a day or two before I have that ironed out.
<P> On the other hand, though, I actually remembered how
most of this thing works, and from what I understand, I'm
*very* nearly at the point where I'll be able to make it do
what it's supposed to do. That is...it should generate all
the site pages, handle all the params properly, and really
should use CGI more. <P> I'm taking an _Alice_ break for a
while and then I'll print a copy and go over it, looking
for things to change to fix the handling of params.  The
web broke "innovation" Innovation is a strange word. It was
abused by microsoft to mean "it's OK to abuse monopoly
power" a couple of years ago, and it is probably never used
correctly, so please excuse me here, and substitute a
better word if you can, if you find I use it offensively. I
believe the web has broken innovation. Ten years ago
software was the last frontier. It was a system that
allowed the lone inventor to capture his ideas in a
framework, hone it over time, and present it to the masses
in a production-ready form. The internet broke that. You
cannot, in todays world, innovate to any significant
extent. Every minor idea you have had. Every spark of
genius you can possibly invent. It has already been blogged
or discussed online somewhere. The reason: blogging
something is far easier than coding something up. So people
just blog it. On the last day of OSCon I attended a talk by
Brewster Kahle of the "Wayback Machine" fame. He spoke
about how he believed one of the next "big" internet
projects could be a video browser, that allowed you to
create the equivalent of HTML for video (similar to SMIL,
but easier to cross-link), and that the person who creates
such a browser will be the next Marc Andreeson. He's wrong.
Because now there are 5 developers working on that project.
Or 5 projects and 20 developers. And none will create a
monopoly like Netscape, because the internet has beaten
monopoly. And all of this is good. And probably
controversial :-)  Linguistics Dear Log, <p>Letters! I get
letters! I get lots and lots of letters! And I got one a
while back, and wrote back a response that might interest
some of my fellow Useperlorganians: <p>====== <p>> You
don't know me from Adam, but Damian Conway recommended
<br>> you as someone able to answer what I hope is a simple
question. <p>Ah yes, I've been meaning to sit down and
write up a Web page about this. I get asked things like
this every few weeks, and each time I swear I'll pull
together something that makes enough general sense to be
worth committing to public availability. <p>Here goes...
<p>> I was hoping to find a book that would be a good
introduction to <br>> the study of languages, linguistics,
grammars, whatever and whatnot. <br>> Unfortunately, I
don't even know the distinctions well enough to <br>> know
if I'm even asking the right question. <br>>[...] <br>> so,
in short, could you recommend any good "complete idiots
guide <br>> to the study of languages and related topics"
type books? <p>Terminology is a problem. <p>In linguistics,
the mapping from concept to terminology is regrettably
complex. It's usually all smoke and no fire. <p>See, a wave
of "physics envy" went thru the field starting about fifty
years ago (and just now finally ending, Godwilling), where
people thought that the way to look big and clever was to
whip up great big shmancy edifices of jargon and symbols
and whatnot (even if your basic methodology was about as
scientific as tarot cards). <br>And the sifted detritus of
those fifty wasted years to to be found in a book that, by
its title, you might think useful: David Crystal's
/Dictionary of Linguistics and Phonetics/. <br>Actually,
the phonology/phonetics entries are probably okay (if
"uninteresting", in many senses of the word), but
everything /else/ in there is somewhere on the scale
between being biased, ill-expressed half-truths, and
outright swirling nonsense. <p>Example (non-phonetic)

Good Lardie, MB is garrulous today.  I think it's a cry for help.
