can  (a)  present  the	Perl  code  though).  Antoine's 
column	is,  as  documented,  currently  a  bug  in  Dan's

dammit,  why  can't  I	search	my  web  site  using  Perl

how  I	didn't	post  Friday  Trivia  Time!  Here's  a

iBook  on  Friday  and	I've  learned  to  move  functions

 that  celebrations  wouldn't  be  fast  to  calculate?
