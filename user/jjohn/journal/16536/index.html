<p><p><b>An Epic Tale of Obsession, Magic and Basic Silliness</b><p><em>Part 1: The Gathering</em>
<p><a href="http://www.dict.org/bin/Dict?Form=Dict3&Database=wn">WordNet</a> 
defines addiction as:
<blockquote>
&laquo;being abnormally tolerant to and dependent on something that 
is psychologically or physically habit-forming&raquo;
</blockquote>
<p>Addiction is at the core of J. R. R. Tolkien's <em>Lord of the Rings</em>. 
For the author, the One Ring of the Dark Lord Sauron is that irresistible prize
that intensifies the most vicious and selfish instincts of Men and Hobbits 
alike.  It twists the desires and visions of its possessor into carrying out
the evil of the Ringlord.  Those that succumb to the Ring's influence turn into
wraiths, living corpses bereft of their own will.  Addiction is also a word 
closely associated with readers of Tolkien's work that has been 
magnificently rendered in film by Peter Jackson.  What but addiction could 
possibly explain the obsessive detail, spot-on locations, impecable casting 
and glorious sets brought together in Jackson's trilogy?  And what other force
would drive adults and man-children out into the frozen pre-dawn air of 
December 16 just to stand in line for twelve hours of movies for which 
they already had tickets?  Addiction, it seems, isn't just for hobbits and 
elves; it has also taken me.
<p>Months ago, my pal <a href="/user/zorknapp/journal/">Zorknapp</a> mentioned that
when the last of the Jackson's Ring movies came out, some venues would be 
hosting a special event in which all three parts of the trilogy would be shown.
To sweeten the pot, extended versions of the first two movies would be played. 
Zorknapp was organizing a small group of friends to attend the event at the 
Lowe's Theatre on Boston's Tremont Street.  Since I'm a man of without a day 
job and a fan of both the books and the movies, I agreed to join this 
fellowship of the Ring movies.  But I was firm on not wearing hairy hobbits 
feet or pointy elven ears, although I was open to negotiation about bringing 
a wizardly staff.  Unfortunately, one of the many theatre regulations 
explicitly forbade bringing this token of office.  As I was to learn, these 
restrictions weren't entirely capricious. 
<p>Because Hollywood seems to delight in answering my lofty expectations of 
well-plotted narratives with hackneyed dreck even hopeless stoners wouldn't
find funny, my movie house patronage has become like my love-making: 
infrequent and frought with peril.  Accordingly, I was not in that fabled 
pre-dawn line that formed down the block of Lowes along Tremont Street and 
trailed off towards the Wang Center.  Only the night before was I told that 
I should be at the theatre around 9AM, when the doors opened.  This seemed a 
little early in the morning for epic movies, but I wasn't complaining.  
Remember, three movies, each four hours long.  Perhaps there was wisdom in 
getting an early start to the proceedings.  Since Lowes is only a few miles 
from my apartment, I opted to walk along Boylston Street so that I could 
enjoy the bracing, morally unambiguous air that blows down from the tundras 
of Canada (it's what I prize most about winters in New England).  Thinking 
that my friends might get peckish during the Long Slog of Tolkien, I bought 
some croissants.  Even though theatres normally frown on bringing your own 
food, I couldn't imagine the concession stand being open that early nor could 
I picture a long line for popcorn, candy and soda before lunchtime.  Besides 
this was a special event of The Fans.  This wasn't just another movie (or 
three), this was an Event.  Surely, this was going to be time when the 
normally frosty Bostonian demeanor would thaw a little into a sort of a muddy 
puddle of mild indifference?  Alas in this way and in others, I would be 
proven very, very wrong.
<p>By 9:45A, I was at the front doors of Lowes.  The sidewalk was empty.  
The only people immediately inside the lobby were employees.  Where was 
every one?  While I got my bearings, I held the door open for a Coca-Cola
delivery guy who was bringing in a palette of several cases of soda.  For 
many of my programming brethen, this vision would elicit urges not unlike 
those felt by Paris Hilton when she passes by the mall's T-Mobile store.  
While my attention was split between the tempting soda (which I call my 
"liquid friends") and looking for my companions ("fleshy friends"), most 
of soda bottles suddenly fell off the palette when the delivery guy failed 
to negiotiate the second set of doors adroitly.  Cross my heart - visions of 
the Rodney King L.A. riots flickered across my mind as I imagined a frenzied 
free-for-all of grabbing hands chasing after the sugary caffine.  However, 
seeing my pal <a href="http://www.jmac.org/weblog/?date=20031217">jmac</a>,
who was not in my fellowship (but was counted an ally nonetheless), broke my 
inane reverie.  jmac was in the small line of people who were being 
<em>processed</em> before being let into the HALLS OF VIEWING.  At 32, I've 
been to a few films and feel I've mastered the most salient points of 
movie-going ettiquette.  It is true that this knowledge has existed mostly 
in oral form though.  Until now.  Taking a page out of the Moses playbook, the 
management of Loews sententiously codified acceptable behavior of its patrons, 
to forestall any shenanigans.  One of the strictures was against the bring 
of <em>any</em> non-Loews food into the theatre.  They thoughtfully provided a 
large garbage barrel for such contraband at the table where tickets were 
collected and hands stamped.  Things were not looking good for my bag of 
croissants, eyed contemptously by the head ticket collector.
<p>"You'll have to throw those out," said Usher Rex.
<p>"But, uh, this my breakfast?" I said weakly.
<p>"You'll have to throw those out," repeated Usher Rex.
<p>Taking a farewell nibble out of one of the croissants, I tossed the bag 
in the barrel after discarding the idea of giving them to the ticket 
collectors, as a mature, neighborly adult might do.  With my ticket collected
and hand stamped, I proceeded into the HALL OF VIEWING to find my friends and 
meet my destiny.
<p><em>Tune in next Monday for the next installment Hail to the King in which 
jjohn asks: isn't $11 a little pricy for a hot dog?</em>

While I have not truly entered this narrative yet, I can say that this is an accurate account of the events leading up to the Fellowship leaving on their quest...
