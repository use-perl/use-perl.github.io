<p><blockquote>&laquo;everybody was Kung Fu fighting<br>
those cats were fast as lightning<br>
in fact it was a little bit fright'ning<br>
but they fought with expert timing&raquo;
</blockquote>
<p>The windows of my apartment's living room open to the humbling vista of 
historic Fenway park, long may it's majestic JumboTron glow.  But in the valley
that exists between the mighty walls of the Green Monster and my fourth floor 
apartment, a stalwart McDonald's Hamburgers serves up all the saturated fats, 
sugar and salt that the good people of Boston, in any state of inebriation, 
might desire.  It isn't solely for the Fenway freaks liquored up on dearly 
bought baseball booze that McDonald's opens its doors, but also for Landsdown 
street lollygaggers and Ramrod rawhides who maintain a presence in the area 
all year round.  Also, local winos are welcome.  There's a place for everybody at the table of Ronald.
<p>In the eigth years that I've lived at my home, the parking lot of this 
Micky D's as been the stage upon which the small dramas of daily life have 
played.  For instance during home games, McDonald's will allow non-patrons to 
park in their lot for a mere $25-$30 dollars.  To organize this task, 
they contract the surliest, most ill-tempered man that can be allowed 
legally to interact unsupervised with the public to direct game spectators 
into parking spaces that are hardly wide enough for their SUVs, minivans and 
Crown Victorias, let alone their outsized asses.  The Miatas and their owners do fine.  Like a sinewy <a href="http://www.rleeermey.com">R. Lee Ermey</a>, 
the parking lot attentent bruskly orders the previously happy tourists into 
their assigned places.  Also like a drill instructor, he has little patience 
for incompetence.  A lot of yelling emanates from the lot on game days.  It's 
like road rage, but with only one car and no road.  He has come very close to 
fisticuffs with a number of his "customers" and I am certain that 
I will see the day that he gets clocked in the back of his gray, wizened head.
<p>Besides the seasonal delight of the Last Angry Parking Attendent, there are
isolated events that make this bit of asphalt worth watching.  For instance on 
warm weekend nights, male and female discotequers can be easily viewed from 
my place "making water."  The wood picket fence that walls the back of the 
parking lot (which is closest to me) has been attacked with bare hands on two 
occasions by young men who apparently enjoyed largish doses of metamphetamine. 
During the All Star game of 1999, a young (I'm guessing) North Shore woman 
spent the evening drinking low-rent beer in the packed parking lot and 
occasionally flashing her (regrettably) still-brassiered breasts in the 
direction of my building.  On yet another occasion a minivan that had 
moments before delieved a group of smartly dressed black church-goers to the 
McDonalds, burst into flames without warning. 
Moments later, there was a small but unexpected 
explosion that was the gas tank igniting (which, due to the size of the blast,
must have been mostly empty).  The 
smell of burnt rubber and other chemicals was dangerously present in my 
apartment while I spied the bewildered family impotently watching their car be 
consumed by fire.  Out my window, motorcycles have been clipped and throttled,
automobiles have frequently collided, sidewalks have been violated by cars, 
and Gay Pride day has been paraded.  Perhaps I should fix a web cam on the lot.
<p>Last night, another installment of McDonald's Parking Lot Theatre started
without warning.  At the time, I was watching the very excellent 
<a href="http://www.auntiemomo.com/samuraijack/">Samurai Jack</a>.  At some
point, I decided that the dulcet strains of heated words coming from the 
rear of the Golden Arches merited some investigation.  Often, I find that 
the raised voices are really those of joy or a good natured row.  Sometimes 
the argument is real but too brief to be entertaining.  On a rare occasion, you
can see some shoving.  Once, I saw a teenager shoved nearly through the glass
door of Ronnie's hizzle.  It's the greatest show on Boylston street.
<p>On this occasion, two twenty-something caucasians 
were in each other's faces.  By channeling Rainman, I can report the weather 
that night was about 39 &deg;F with a 10 mph wind.  Besides being a great 
narrative detail, the weather also supports my supposition that these guys 
specifically wanted to beat the crap out of each other.  You see, neither had 
on a jacket or anything heavier than a thin shirt.  One them, let's call him 
"Tipplin' Shawn," had on only a white tank-top of the variety precociously 
nicknamed "the wifebeater."  The other, hereafter referred to as "Ernest," 
wore a baseball cap.  Backwards.
<p>Those readers of my blog who have lived any length of time in Massachusetts
should now be able to finish the story.
<p>For the rest of you, the facts simply stated are these.  Good ol' Tipplin'
apparently has or had a tricked out car that he, Ernest and "some bitches"
were cruising in earlier that evening.  But, you know Tipplin'!  He had a 
little too much drinky, drinky and started driving on, get this, the 
<em>wrong side</em> of the road.  Not only were "the bitches" perturbed
by this, but so was Ernest!  Something then happened (an accident or the 
police -- I didn't hear), that really underscored Ernest's concerns about 
Tipplin's driving on the wrong side of the road so that when I observed 
the two, neither the car nor "the bitches" were to be seen.  Which may help 
to explain 
the very pointed shouting and loudly prosecuted recriminations.  In 
particular, Ernest felt that Tipplin' really ought not to have driven on the 
wrong side of the road (as mentioned earlier), despite how cool it made 
them look and how excited it 
seemed to make "the bitches."  For his part, Tipplin' implored Ernest to 
"get off his back" and wondered if this was "friggin' Russia?"  Ernest claimed
that if Tipplin' was looking for a fight, he was willing to obilige him.  
Tipplin' slurred something that didn't quiet reach my ears, but it might have
been a not at all complimentary insinuation about the sexual habits 
of Ernest's mother.  At that point,
Ernest started bouncing on his feet "like a boxer," and proceeded to slap the 
living crap out of Tipplin' Shawn, who for his part went straight down to the
soggy, filthy snow of the McDonald's parking lot and curled up into the 
classic defensive posture of a fetal position and began to weep softly. 
Ernest threw a few more short jabs at Tipplin's head and body while 
admonishing his stricken friend to "listen to me next time!"  After conceding 
that Ernest's position had some merit, Tipplin' was helped to his feet by his 
attacker/friend.  The wifebeater in tatters, Tipplin' pulled 
off what was left of his tank-top and slowly walked out of the parking lot 
following Ernest.  He was beaten and dirty, but perhaps wiser for the 
smackdown. 
<p>Fifteen to twenty minutes after the fight, a police cruiser entered the 
parking lot with lights rolling but the show had long since moved on.

Hey guy, whatsamattawitchu? Boston is wicked crazy.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) Of course, I lived in Arlington Hts. which might explain why I have no wistful thoughts about leaving. I do, however, miss Rockport; fewer townies, nicer view.

Yeah, if you like friggin' RUSSIA.<br> <br>A couple of years ago after a roller hockey game in Acton, MA, some little punks tried to start a fight with some of my teammates.  Sensing it was getting out of hand, I told them to shut the hell up and keep walking.  Being bigger than both of the aggressors put together, I figured that might end it.  Stupid me: this is massholes we're talking about!<br> <br>So they tried to start a fight with me<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... but realizing I might end up in the pokey for the evening, and wanting to go home to my family instead, I told the manager they were acting up.  My adrenaline was way up having just finished a hockey game, and I so wanted to break them each in twain, so I was shaking a bit; this prompted one of them to query me, "why are you shaking?  are you a fag?"<br> <br>Ah, yes.  Massachusetts, how I miss thee.<br>
