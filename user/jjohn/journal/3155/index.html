<div class="span8">
<p><p>In an attempt to reduce the amount of time I spend talking out my ass, I'm reading a series of books that cover various styles and epochs of science fiction. I just finished (in one day!) H.G Wells' _The Time Machine_. It's short, fun adventure story that reflects much of the late nineteenth century's faith in both technical and social progress. Clearly, this book was written before the inhuman (all too human?) destruction of the World Wars. Wells attempts to use Darwin's Natural Selection, a hip new concept for the day, to spin a cautionary tell of capitalistic hubris. It's a good read, despite some truly stupid moves on the part of the Time Traveller -- like starting a massive forrest fire.
<p>Representing post-war sci-fi, I also recently finished Orwell's dystopian masterpiece _1984_, in which (for Orwell) the future has become ruled by three giant totalitarian states whose political ideology makes Machiavelli's work seem like a Christian sermon. These states exist, not to help their subjects or even to aggrandize their leaders, but simply to exert power -- everyone is expendable. Even abstract concepts like language and history are viciously assalted. Orwell's story is a bleak testiment to the loss of faith in humanity brought on by popular rise of fascism 1920's and 1930's, and to the war, holocausts and pogroms that followed.
<p>Next up on the tour: the psychadelic sixties. Yeah, baby! Phillip K. Dick trips the light fantastic with _Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep_ and John Wyndham keeps a stiff upper lip in _Day of the Triffids_. Turn on. Tune in and drop out, man!

<h2>PKD</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ziggy/">ziggy</a> on 2002-02-27T14:39:21</h3>
DADOES isn't the best example of psychadelic PKD.  If you really want something psychadelic, go find a copy of <i>The Zap Gun</i> (where weapons designers do their best work when in an altered state of reality for days at a time), <i>The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch</i> (where users of the drugs Can-D and Chew-Z duke it out).  Better yet, if you want the drug induced schizophrenia with none of the psychadelic culture, check out <i>A Scanner Darkly</i>.
<p>
Of course, one of the most classic PKD novels is <i>Ubik</i>.  If I said anything about it, I'd ruin the entire plotline.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)
</p><p>
While on the topic of H. G. Wells, check out <i>The World Set Free</i>, a novel he wrote around WWI about airplanes, nukular bombs and the like.  Quite prophetic.</p>



<h2>Ender's Game</h2>

Stop whatever you're reading now and read this book.  Then continue...
<p>
Oh - the author is Orson Scott Card</p>

I have read _Ender's Game_ -- about 5 years ago. It's a nice little book; I enjoyed reading it. I'm afraid I don't find it as resonating as most geeks do. Smart kid is duped by Bad Government into doing Bad Things to win a war. It's not a bad plot, but it doesn't thrill me. I didn't identify with Ender and I sure as hell didn't want to read more about the little bugger (so to speak<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-). <br> <br>On the list of other sci-fi I don't "get," put Azimov's Foundation Trilogy. I read this series twice and I still don't find it compelling. How it beat out _Lord of the Rings_ for a Hugo is scandalous. Herbert's _Dune_ series: Great beginning followed by utter crap. Space opera at nearly its worst. <br> <br>But, thanks for tip! Don't let the negativity fool you -- I appreciate the feedback.

I found Ender's Game pretty well written, but Card's books after that get kinda lame.  All about a distant future where all cultures are very separate and very proper and very quaint.  (Ahem and Mormon-esque.)

I found that the sequels to Ender's Game had a bit more depth to them (unlike the typical successful book turned into a series where any important ideas have been presented in the first book and the rest are only for entertainment in a familiar territory).  But I enjoyed Ender's Game too.<br> <br>Card is one of the authors that I read every book he writes.  While he has interesting stories, I especially find his characterization and focus on inter-personal relationships to be good.  Theodore Sturgeon is another author in that category.<br> <br>The Foundation series is entertaining space opera.  I'm currently reading the 5'th book to my son for bedtime story - he enjoyed the first enough that we've just kept going.  Asimov's appeal is the simplicity of his writing - I read all of his books that I could get when I was in grade 6 and yet the stories are well enough crafted that I can still enjoy them as an adult.  (Some of the books he wrote in the subsequent 4 decades were a bit deeper, but the entertaining story was always still his main focus.)<br> <br>Other writers from whom I automatically buy anything they write are (in no particular order): Larry Niven, Roger Zelasny, Robert Sawyer, James Gardner, Gordon Dickson, C. S. Friedman, Terry Pratchett, Lois McMaster Bujold and probably a dozen others that don't come to mind immediately.

<h2>Shape of Things to Come</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/TorgoX/">TorgoX</a> on 2002-02-27T18:28:49</h3>
Have you read Wells's<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/Shape of Things to Come/?  Out of print in the US last I heard, but there's millions of copies floating around in used bookstores.  abebooks.com!



<h2>Some more authors</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/mirod/">mirod</a> on 2002-02-27T18:56:28</h3>
<p>OK, I guess I'll have to chip in then:</p>
<ul> <li>John Varley, especially his short stories. I find facscinating the way most of them take place in the same world, thus relvealing it little by little as you read more of them. Plus the guy can really write and can give life to his characters.</li>
<li>Norman Spinrad: The Iron Dream is one of the funniest and scariest and above all most clever books I have ever read. His short stories are pretty good too.</li>
<li>Theodore Sturgeon, especially his short stories (once again, but remember the Golden Age of SciFi was dominated by pulps).</li>
<li>Robert Silverberg wrote too many good books for me to list them all, I especially like the Majipoor series (it's more Fantasy than SciFi though).</li>
<li>PJ Farmer's Riverworld series, the last one is disapointing but the first ones are really good,</li>
<li>John Sladek's Tik-Tok: hilarious story of a... twisted robot, forget about the 3 laws here.</li>
</ul>

Wow.  I thought I was the only person on the planet who actually bought and read that book.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)  I tried to describe the amphibious aircraft carrier that was as big as the state of Delaware, but somehow my explanation didn't sound as funny as Sladek's.

Bruce Sterling!  Bruce Sterling!  Bruce Sterling!

Yes, but <i>Islands in the Net</i> is worth avoiding.  It was a great read, until Sterling realized he didn't know where the story was going, and shoved the plot over a cliff to get the damn thing done.
<p>
<i>Involution Ocean</i> is a great first novel, doubly so when you read Harlan Ellison's forward.  <i>Holy Fire</i> is a really nice recent work of his.</p>

Yes, <cite>Islands in the Net</cite> is a bit off structurally, but there's lots of wierd=fun ideas in it to make it worth reading, I think.
<p>I would almost say the same about Stephenson's <cite>Diamond Age</cite>, depending on how charitable I'm feeling toward He-Who-Has-No-Editor (aka Stephenson).</p>

<h2>Re:Authors to read</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ziggy/">ziggy</a> on 2002-02-28T18:15:50</h3>
Oh, yes.  Neal Stephenson.  <i>Zodiac</i> is quite nice, and the first 20 or so pages of <i>Snow Crash</i> are some of the funniest bits I've ever read.
<p>
jjohn, you'll probably get a real kick out of <i>Zodiac</i>.  It's set in Boston, and deals with overprivedged yuppie kids who are polluting Boston Harbor (among lots of other things).  Lots of funny moments in that book, too.  Not good in-flight reading, unless you like making a spectacle of yourself because you can't stop laughing (I had to put the book down mid-flight and mid-book).</p>

Yes, <cite>Zodiac</cite> is brilliant.
<p>It's a bit sad that Stephenson's books have gone mostly downhill (while getting thicker and thicker) since then.  But read <cite>Zodiac</cite> and enjoy it.</p>
