<p><p>U.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft has always bugged me. Yes, his political views are abhorrent to me and yes he did lose an election to a dead guy, but there was something else about him - something sinister that lurked just beyond my grasp. 
<p>And then it hit me.
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://i.cnn.net/cnn/2002/LAW/05/30/ashcroft.fbi/story.ashcroft.jpg">John Ashcroft</a> and the X-File's <a target="_blank" href="http://www.xfiles.com/infobase/bios/cast/images/img_wb_davis.jpg">William B. Davis</a>: separated at birth or <em> the same man!</em>.  </p>

<h2>the smoking man?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/hfb/">hfb</a> on 2002-05-31T14:35:17</h3>
<p>No way, Ashcroft is a bible thumpin', hymn singing at executions freak...even the smoking man would have the character and decency to just light up and smoke in a semi-reverent silence while they kill the intended. Ashcroft is  simply the second coming of Heinrich Himmler only this time with a less sexy uniform. Now, with more singing!<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) Every day there is something new to make me happy that my days in the country are numbered.</p>



<h2>I don't think so</h2>

As far as I know, the Smoking Man never wrote bizarre patriotic songs and sang them at assemblies of his subordinates, and I don't believe he ever had himself anointed with cooking oil.  I doubt he was interested in covering up naked statues either.<br> <br>Besides, you can't very well be running things from the shadows when you're occupying offices like senator and attorney general.



<h2>Strange</h2>

I always find it odd when computer geeks criticize the odd rituals of others.<br>
