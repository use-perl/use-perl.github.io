<p>The BBC <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3209223.stm">reports</A>:<blockquote>
&laquo;The lightning bolt hit Caviezel and the film's assistant director Jan 
Michelini while they were filming [Gibson's <i>The Passion of Christ</i>] 
in a remote location a few hours from Rome.
<br><br>
It was the second time Michelini had been hit by lightning during the shoot.&raquo; 
</blockquote>
<p>It would be imprudent to conclude that some nameless deity isn't pleased
with this movie simply because the asst. director has been smote twice with
heavenly fire.  However if a third lightning strike occurs, Michelini 
might want to consider dropping out of this project at first available 
opportunity and making some discreet inquiries with the Roman Church.  
<p>No one wants to see how a fourth omen would manifest.   
<p>Of course, five omens are <b>right out</b>. 
<p><b>update:</b> Apparently the All-Mighty is throwing quite a few lightning 
bolts around these days.  In early October 2003, 
<a href="http://www.snopes.com/religion/bolt.htm">Lightning strikes a church 
during a sermon after preacher identifies thunder as the voice of God</a>.
<p>Perhaps I should invest in shoes with thick rubber soles?

<p>You'd think if there was a nameless deity that said nameless <i>omnipotent</i> deity would have better shit to do than fuck with the guys getting the movie of your life totally wrong. I mean, lightning is so...Thor-esque. WHERE ARE THE STIGMATA?!<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) </p>
<p>
Of course, it's entirely possible that zorching people with lightning is the deity equivalent to hanging out on #perl; ennui with noplace to go.</p>

"You'd think if there was a nameless evil entity that said evil entity would have better shit to do than fuck with the guys getting the movie of other entities totally right."<p>The cool thing about theophanies -- miracles, sacred scriptures -- is that they can always be interpreted in two completely opposite ways. J.L.Borges, in his short story <i>the Sect of the Thirty</i>, gives a very rigorous proof that the Saviour and the Son of God was actually Judas Iscariot. I haven't still found where the flaw in his proof his...</p>

<p>:) LOL...I've never read that. It certainly gives new meaning to 'betray onesself' and to 'fuck yourself over'!<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) I'll giggle about that all the way to the apple store here in  HELLsinki where all of 3 mac users will be buying Panther.</p>

After verification, I was actually referring to the short story <i>Three versions of Judas</i>, published in <i>Fictions</i>, where each story involves some paradox. (One of these is a crime story where the detective is named L&ouml;nnrot. Knowing Borges, that can't be without an implicit reference to the Kalevala.) Borges always enjoyed theology, which he considered as <i>a part of fantastic literature</i>.

Hmm...we live on L&#246;nnrotinkatu [ L&#246;nnrot's street ] which is named for L&#246;nnrot who collected and wrote down the legends in the Kalevala so I'd say that's a good guess<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) I'll have to look that book up as it sounds like something I'd get a kick out of since I share his viewpoint<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

For some reason the English translation of <i>Ficciones</i> leaves the title in Spanish (it's not called <i>Fictions</i>). The same collection of stories (or at least a very similar list) is also sold under the title <i>Labyrinths</i>, which makes it odd that Amazon suggests buying the two as a set (but possibly they're different translations).  The story I remember best from it is "The Library of Babel".
