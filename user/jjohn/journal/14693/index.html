That  will    Only  just  today  I  found  a  lot  more

session  I  attended  Sarathy's  talk  on  how

their  criteria,  which  it  is.  I  think  the  telephone

Basically,  if	you  find  that  it  would  be	"instance

I admit that I don't really understand what these "markov blogger" things are, but this caught my eye:
<p>
<i>Sys::Host (Ruby) - The ip_addr() method was causing my bed and going strong since March and not even the best office suites and desktop packages installed. </i>
</p><p>
Sys-Host is my code, though it's pretty much worthless because it can't do any more than the "socket" module right now.  The original plan was to be able to get multiple-ip addresses on multi-homed machines, but I couldn't get it to work.</p>

<h2>Cutting back on markov</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jjohn/">jjohn</a> on 2003-09-14T12:07:42</h3>
I'm reducing the frequency of the markov blogs to Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays.  Eventually, I'll cut that back futher to Fridays.  This is my first experiment with Markov Chains and this blog has been a record of my trail runs.  As annoying as they can be to read, I think the markovblog entries are worthy of retention in the same way real scientists keep field notes.  There are some additional refinements that I'll get around to including.  Perhaps I'll write something up as a use.perl.org article.

I, for one, would love to see a MarkovBlogger web page.<br> <br>
