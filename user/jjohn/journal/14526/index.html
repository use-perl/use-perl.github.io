<p>A </code> <p>Break: <i>in progress</i> <p><b>[UPDATE]:</b>Check out <a
href="http://ddi.digital.net/user/solsbury/scratch.htm">this
page</a> about tPete's second album. Very interesting.
<p>Despite this annoying ad campaign, I'm treating myself
to a new computer. It's a Dell Dimension 4400 (P4 1.7Ghz;
512M; 40Gb). It'll come with Windows XP, but why will
people buy it? Sure, new PC owners won't have a choice, but
maybe they'll buy the cheap Xbox and get all the
functionality they need. Where will that leave Windows, the
jewel of the Microsoft's product line? In a <a
href="http://www.mos.org/tcm/tcm.html">museum</a>. <P>But
how does this relate to Mundie's comments? Linux is already
"eating Microsoft's lunch" in the server market. Microsoft
needs consumers to believe that Open Source software is
yours to keep. As Microsoft uses web services to finely
control application usage to only licensed users, Open
Source software's consumer value will begin to become
wildly attractive to IT departments strapped for cash. The
Big Lie Microsoft needs you to believe is that every
software upgrade they sell will make your life better. In
fact, the only ones confused are the turists. Also of note
was the security around the Capital building. I knew that I
wasn't going tto  follow a strict regiment for 10 months
without some  deviations. Like I said, I'm lazy and not
into pain. <p>My exercise started very modestly. I think I
can learn flash well enough to do this. Perhaps SVG also
has tight integration between audio
