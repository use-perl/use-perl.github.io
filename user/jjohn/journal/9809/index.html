<p><p>Like Dr. M. L. King, I too had a dream. 
<p>Last night, I was magically transported back to my high school (which was 
a private school that housed kindergarten through twelfth grade). 
It wasn't clear whether I was teacher or student, yet I was definitely 
an adult. It was late in the day (a typically warm early fall or late spring 
day on Cape Cod) and as I brought my inexplicably flaccid surfboard out to 
the parking lot, the headmaster was chaining his excitable blonde labrador 
to a pole. Together we watched as the last bus filled with laughing 
children drove off for the day leaving the two of us alone in the dusty 
parking lot under a stunningly beautiful sky.

<p>Tom, the headmaster, looked worried. He said, "I think (noted O'Reilly 
editor and tech industry pundit) 
<a href="http://www.oreilly.com/news/p2pinterview_0401.html">Andy Oram</a> 
is ready to teach sex ed to the first graders." Not only did this not 
shock me, but I launched in a blue tirade about how the Puritan's rigid 
moral strictures continue to haunt our modern society and how those 
outmoded values account for many of the most ulcerous of current social 
problems (like the booming pornography industry, hostility toward 
homosexuality, the intolerance of different cultures, the 
"Madonna/whore"-ideal for women and, most egregious, closed liquor stores 
on Sunday).

<p>Unfortunately before Tom could either respond to my comments or explain
exactly why Andy Oram, a fine technical editor and writer though he may 
be, was the ideal candidate to negiotate the delicate waters of sexual 
education to the improbably young, 
<a href="http://taskboy.com/pictures/pye.html">my cat</a> woke me with 
a God-forsaken meow that alerted to the tardiness of his breakfast service. 
In this way, gentle reader, I demonstrate that my life vacilates between 
nocternal Freudian terror and unspeakable real-life horror.

<p>I suspect that Rod Serling has an unproduced Twilight Zone about me.

<h2>Dream journals</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/rafael/">rafael</a> on 2003-01-07T14:45:28</h3>
One of the things I might want to do is to keep a dream journal. (But not on the web probably.) Apparently a side-effect of keeping a dream journal is that your dreams begin to shape as written stories -- at least for people inclined to writing, like me (although I don't like writing in english. (but I often dream in english (or in bourne shell--))) For <i>really</i> talented people dreams just turn out to be great novels (the most famous example being <i>Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde</i>, see <i>A Chapter On Dreams</i> by R.L.Stevenson for more on that subject.)

We also have a <a href="http://home.sergeant.org/DSC00015.JPG" title="sergeant.org">cat called pye</a sergeant.org>.<br> <br>Not exactly a common name, though I guess popular with those who like old B&amp;W movies.

Your Pye looks like a very interesting fellow. My has shorter hair and a much, much grander chassis.
