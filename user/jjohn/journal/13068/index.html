<p>hfb, pudge:  you left too soon!  It's always darkest before a wicked cool dawn.</p>

<p>Well, where we are we don't have no stinkin' dawn...it's just one loooong day for most of the summer<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) Better watch yourself as they put crack in those donuts, I'm certain of it<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) We miss you JJ.</p>

It is surprisingly bright here too.  Sun doesn't set until 10 p.m. or so.  Freaky.<br> <br>I've never had a Krispy Kreme donut.  I've never lived near a place that has them, and every time I am in a place that does, the lines are long, and us Massholes eschew long lines, except when there is no alternative, like at the ATM, or Dunkin Donuts.<br> <br>And we also dislike what is unfamiliar, so we will wait in line at Dunkin Donuts much more readily than we will at Krispy Kreme<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... not because the foodstuffs are more familiar, but because the LINE is more familiar.

<p>Krispy Kreme are good, but their reputation is undeserved.  The true world's best donut is Shipley's.  They are made with unflavored gelatin so they melt in your mouth.</p>

I waited my 20 minutes in the drive-thru (at 11pm!) and got 3 dozen to take home: 1 doz for us, and 2 doz I took to work. Was it worth it? You bet! I'm from North Carolina and have been waiting literally <b>years</b> for this store to open.

<p>&lt;dons flame suit&gt;Krispy Kreme has the best doughnuts in the world. Dunkin Donuts glazed donughts suck, to put it kindly. &lt;/flame&gt;</p>

</p><p>I don't think you'll get any argument from those that have sampled the products from both companies.  As a masshole lifer, I didn't experience the glories of Krispy Kreme until YAPC2002.  I had no idea donuts could taste that good.</p>

<p>You are correct about Dunkin Donuts, but you have apparently never tried Shipley's.</p>

<p>jjohn, maybe I should find someone to submit a proposal to have YAPC 2004 in Texas so you can have the <i>real</i> world's best donuts there.</p>
