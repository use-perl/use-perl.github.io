<div class="span8">
<p><p>CNN/HLN did an interview with <a href="http://www.savefarscape.com/news/article.php?newsid=66">Farscape's Ben Browder</a>, in which Ben said:

<p><blockquote>
After the fan response, they [ed: USA and Henson] got back together and started talking again. It gave us an extra week before we had to start chopping up the sets for them to try to figure out a way around it. At this point, it looks like it's not gonna happen, so it looks like we're not gonna see a fifth season. 
</blockquote>

<p>The fight continues to get Farscape <a href="http://farscape.noidea.us/">a new home</a> and to get the show into syndication. The Farscape crew produced 88 episodes of some of the best science fiction I've seen in recent years. Sure the show was always a little short on science and heavy on fiction, but so am I. Farscape's passing leaves a giant hole in my viewing habits and means that I'll be tuning into SCIFI for an occasional B5 fix. This means I can devote more time to wallowing in my largess. So that I don't end on a down note, there is some hope on the horizon. There is this note on the <A href="http://www.farscape.com/news/index.html">the official Farscape homepage</a>:
<blockquote>
Although SCI FI Channel has chosen not to pick up a fifth season, The Jim Henson Company is in active development on a new Farscape film, an anime project and is currently discussing syndication of this highly acclaimed series. We are eager to move forward with the Farscape creative team in developing new projects that will resonate with our overwhelmingly loyal fan base. 
</blockquote>

<P>Finally, I'll be able to restrict my IRCing to #perl.

Yeah, I watched the interview.  Hopefully the show is not dead yet<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... but it looks like it probably is.  Suck.<br> <br>I feel like boycotting Stargate SG-1.<br>

I feel like boycotting Stargate SG-1.</i>
</p><p>I already do that, except I call it "not watching a stupid show."
</p><p>There will be a chat on irc.scifi.com #farscape tonight at 8pm EDT with Ben Browder, Rick Manning (Writer, producer) and David Kemper (writer, Producer).</p>

Stargate's cool.  You just suck.<br> <br>Yeah, I tried to get on the chat last night, but failed; I guess they had to reschedule.

<h2>Incorrect Transcript</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/pudge/">pudge</a> on 2002-09-18T15:22:06</h3>
"At this point, it looks like it's not gonna happen, so it looks like we're not gonna see a fifth season."<br> <br>The actual quote was:<br> <br>"At this point, it looks like it's not gonna happen, so we're not gonna see a fifth season."<br> <br>The quote in the transcript is the result of either wishful thinking or interpretation.  Perhaps Ben later clarified that he *meant* what is in the transcript, but he *said* what I quoted (I have it on the TiVo still, and just double-checked it).  Again, there was no "so it looks like we're not," it was "so we're not."<br>
