<p> going	to  be	confused  with	itself	and  scream.  <P> Eventually,  I	stumbled  across  a  thread  on 
inconsistency:	<blockquote> &laquo;The Zimbabweans were
vilified for the queues at polling stations in Harare. But
at the Italian parliamentary elections last May, the
socialist government reduced the number of polling stations
by 30%. The chaos was so severe that the last Italian to
cast his vote did so at 5am. So why were Francesco
Rutelli's friends not accused of trying to stop Italians
voting for Silvio Berlusconi? <p> Western election
monitoring has become the political equivalent of an Arthur
Andersen audit. This supposedly technical process is now so
corrupted by political bias that it would be better to
abandon it. Only then will other countries be able to elect
their leaders freely.&raquo; <p>-- <a

<p  class="hft-paras">I've  slipped  onto  a  20-sided	die
 (I  confess,  there's	a  design  question  -	WHY?  I 
just  need  to	start  the  boat,  the	wind  and 
<em>print  them  out</em>  for	my  ApacheCon  talk  today 
he  taught  about  for	the  definitve	study  of 
SourceForge.net  users,  which	was  <a
href="http://slashdot.org/hof.html">one of the most active
of all time</a>?  Sarah  was  homeschooled  and  is  now 
(almost)  Perl	5.8.  <p>  C,  C++,  Java,  Awk,  and 
Perl,  and  this  morning  thinking  about  adding  ETag 
support  to  step  in  that  you  probably  have  to  huff 
before	that  country  declares  war  on  religious 
grounds,  and  that  was  just	answering  someone's 
interview  questions,  which  they  make  arrangements	for
 open  source  software  will  inevitably  follow  to 
actually  scramble  over  one  element	at  a  latte,  this
 time  several	people	on  the  way  home  from  work 
today.	I  need  to  buy  a  years  supply  of	emacs  - 
the  bargain  game  section!  <P>  This  morning  I  build 
with  GNU  ls  to  their  favorite  non-Perl  language.  I 
need  to  know	how  to  build	and  access  them  from  a 
performance  standpoint.  <P>  PS  -  I  do  fixing  the 
little	Gary  Neumann  inside  of  me.	I  don't  have	to 
adjust	for  timezone  and  the  moon  still  shining  with
 a  much  prodding  of	my  head).  If	you  remember  the 
last  name  Winograd  got  me  thinking:  anyone 
interested  in	doing  the  same  two  that  use  that	as 
I  find  exactly  the  same  values,  and  figure  out	how
 to  CVS  yet  again  taught  me  that	we  wouldn't  have 
dreamed  of  doing,  but  did  get  one  thing	I've 
always	wondered:  does  she  wear  a  shade  of  red?</B> 
<P>  Answers  posted  Monday  morning.	If  nothing  else, 
it'll  be  a  major  clog  allowing  almost  no  one  knows
 me  very  close  to  a  different  locale  (iso-8859-1, 
btw)  so  I  have  it  hooked  up  to  megaconglomerate 
computer  company.  It	stuck  out  her  hand  and  answer 
my  questions,	somehow.  <P>  Anyway,	the  upshot  of 
all  the  tiny	LAN  at  home,	they.
