<p><p>It's important for me to dispell the constant rumors of my coolness with these public confessions of dorkiness. I just bought Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Seasons 1 and 2 on DVD. I didn't watch Buffy before a few months ago. After watching seaons 5's "The Body" I'm beginning to believe there's something to this Josh Weldon fellow after all. 
<p>If this confession has ruined my cred with my many admirers, I apologize. On the other hand, I'm impressed with the first two eps. </p>

jjohn++ for finally seeing the light.  Our weekly TV routine consists of Buffy (all the family), Angel (Jenine and her mother), Firefly (all the family), West Wing (political porn), and 24 (so addicted I may just buy the 1st season on DVD today).  Joss is responsible for 3/5 of our TV pleasure.<p>

If you're joining the cult of Joss, try <a href="http://www.whedonesque.com/" title="whedonesque.com">Whedonesque</a whedonesque.com> for all the goss that's fit to print (and some that isn't).  Avoid the wildfeed spoilers, though--I used to read spoilers before the eps, but this season is so good that it's a crying shame to ruin the viewing experience with spoilers.</p><p>

I've tried watching Buffy.  I really have.  The episodes I've seen are either incredibly cheesy or the actors look like they're sleeping through their roles.  In recent episodes, SMG looks like she'd rather be anywhere else but on the set of Buffy.  Oh, and by the way - Ms. Hannigan....can....not....act.
