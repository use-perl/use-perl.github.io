<p><p><b>An Epic Tale of Obsession, Magic and Basic Silliness</b><p><em>Part 3: The Viewing</em>
<p>To recap: After a long trek to the theatre, my friends and I waited another
three hours for the first film to begin.  But before the movie could be shown, 
I had to watch the advertisements. 
<p>The reason I mention the following ads has less to do with the financial 
consideration they pay me and more to do with that the three ads below ran 
before each of the movies.  Like an army movie about venerial disease. The 
first film has quite a lot in common with a militart training film because 
it was a public service announcement about the consequences of pot smoking 
and baby sitting, America's secret shame. 
<p>The ad opens by showing a ground-level pool and several childrens' toys 
conspicuously close to the water's edge.  A voiceover says "Go ahead. What's
the harm in smoking a little dope?"  A toddler then lumbers toward to the pool
in the inebriated way that they do.  The voiceover continues, "you can just 
tell the parents that their baby daughter fell into the pool while you were 
smoking pot!"  For a moment, this sounded like a suggestion.  I asked 
zorknapp, "Dude, do you think that would really work?! Cool!"  Zorknapp assured
me that the announcer was being ironic and not giving advice.
<p>The next ad was for some kind of Coca-Cola product that had something to do
with computers and music.  The spokesman was a suburban teenager that 
thought he was a "playa," despite the lack of any ghetto time or discernable 
street cred.  What I do remember is the name of his dog, "Maxx."  I also recall
that other members of the audience remembered this pooch's name because we all 
loudly greeted Maxx when we saw his image for the last time before <em>Return 
of the King</em>.
<p>The last ad I can recall with any distinction was clearly aimed at a 
demographic to which I did not belong.  In it, a young lady orgasmically 
cavorts on CGI beach in a rain of CGI rose petals.  Then she appears in the 
crest of a CGI wave.  If you guessed that the ad was for a femine hygene 
product, you'd be off the mark a bit.  The object of the advertisement was 
perfume. 
<p>With ads viewed and lunch consumed (I went for the hot dog and awful, awful
curly fries for $8), it was time for <em>The Fellowship of the Ring</em>.  This 
was the extended cut that included more Bilbo and Boromir scenes.  The additional
scenes improved the clarity of the plot significantly.  Fellowship, I think, 
stands out as the best realized movie of the trilogy.
<p>Four hours later, Frodo and Sam have broken the Fellowship to set out on 
their own for Mordor.  I, similarily, set out for the men's room.  Like the 
orc-infested Black Gate of Moria, the closest water closet is unassailablly 
congested.  Luckly, I knew that more facilities were available further away 
from the HALL OF VIEWING.  This incident just proves the old adage: fortune 
favors the bold.
<p>As 6PM approached, we all found our way back to our seats and watched the 
same commercials again, after which the extended version of <em>The Two 
Towers</em> began.  Again, a good time was had by all. 
<p>It was only after the second film ended at 9:30PM that I began to 
realize that I wasn't getting out of the theatre any time soon.  However, after
two meals at the concession stand, I needed more credible food.  Excerising 
the right of return, I left the theatre to patronize a near by Subway.  What 
bread!  I returned in time for the 10:15PM premire of <em>Return of the 
King</em>.  When the movie finished at 2:00AM on Wednesday (recall that I 
arrived at the theatre <b>Tuesday Morning</b>), I was emotionally and 
physically spent.  Public transportation had long sinced closed for the night, 
so I wearily ambled home along the Gray Pavement, through hookers, nightclubbers 
and street freaks.  At my journey's end, I slept the Sleep of the Just.
<p>Some have complained that <em>Return of the King</em> is just a long battle 
scene.  However, this claim is meritless when viewing the entire trilogy.  
If a good story has a beginning, middle and end, then surely one ought to have 
been expecting the long foreshadowed War for the Ring to be a major component 
of this concluding film.  However, there is a lot more in this last episode 
that just imaginary monsters fighting make-believe heroes for pretend glory.  
Jackson's trilogy beautifully renders that all too common struggle of 
stepping out of the shadow of one's parents, a theme that, while present, 
isn't as strongly illuminated in Tolkien's work.  The struggle of Frodo to 
master his own quite unhobbit-like fate is wonderfully cantalevered with 
Aragon's ambivalence about his own destiny.  Although both succeed in their 
quests, Frodo is utlimately consumed by the consequences of his decisions 
while Aragon prospers (as has been noted, it's good to be the King).  
Frodo's sacrifice allows the last flowering of Numenor and the 
begining of the Age of Men.  That is, the world of Faery departs for the world
we know today.  This is the stuff of Nordic legend.  It's Thor 
and Odin fighting the giants at Ragnarok even though they know they will 
perish, although new gods will take their place.  It's like reading the battle 
of Hector and Achilles in Homer's <i>Ilyad</i> or watching Macbeth's murderous
climb to power come undone by fate.  There is nothing so engaging to watch 
than a well-plotted doom.  
<p>Jackson's Ring movies take from Tolkien those themes that could be most 
readily adapted for a motion picture.  He rightly avoided a literal 
translation of the books and in doing so created something new that even 
well-read Tolkien fans can enjoy.  Tolkien would have approved of this 
"subcreation" for much the same reason that he himself reworked the Eddas, 
Sir Gawain, Beowulf and the Denham Tracts into Middle Earth.  The movies 
do nothing to dimishes the books and perhaps will introduce Tolkien to 
an even broader audience.  And for this, Peter Jackson's work should be 
embraced by all true fans of <em>Lord of the Rings</em>.

<h2>Adaptation</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/pudge/">pudge</a> on 2004-01-13T06:11:18</h3>
I agree, it was a wonderful adaption, but I still think many of his changes were poor ones.  My complaints with Fellowship were primarily with what was left out, and I was very happy to see them brought back for the extended edition.  I imagine my complaints about RotK will be the same.  With those movies, the changes were made necessary by the medium (most notably, the removal of Tom Bombadil and the Scouring of the Shire).<br> <br>But many changes in The Two Towers bug me.  There was no need for Aragorn to fall off the cliff, or for the elves to come to Helm's Deep.  The Ents didn't need to be surprised at the destruction near Isengard and decide to go to war five seconds after finding out.  And Faramir didn't need to take Frodo to Osgiliath.  It is unfortunate, and it diminishes the movie.<br> <br>Not too much, though.  Any of the movies is still the best movie I've seen in 20 years, probably.  They are unmatched.
