<p>I'm running "Don't know" (or I was earlier).</p>
<p>It doesn't (yet) know about RISC OS. So I score 1 so far. (I think it's fair for anyone else with a RISC OS machine, or any other known don't know, to claim a point, until it officially knows how to identify that OS version). I'm tempted to set my Irix box up to see if it is also a don't know. Sadly I don't have any Crays (which they also say they want)</p>
<p>Who will score the most?</p>

I scored one point with an IRIX box that apparently had slightly non-standard settings.  Other than that, I seem to be boringly predictable.<br> <br>

Well, when I can't answer the second question, that's when I reach for my Emergency Pants.
<ul>
<li>
What are <a href="http://sluggy.com/daily.php?date=020408&amp;mode=weekly" title="sluggy.com">Emergency Pants</a sluggy.com>?
<ul>
<li>They're Sluggy Freelance approved survival equipment.
</li>
</ul><br/><br/></li>
<li>
How will you know when to use Emergency Pants?
<ul>
<li>
It will be rather obvious, just like in this handy instructional cartoon: "<a href="http://sluggy.com/daily.php?date=020415&amp;mode=weekly" title="sluggy.com">This looks like a job for Emergency Pants.</a sluggy.com>" (Third strip.)

<h2>Hey! That's my proxy!</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/bart/">bart</a> on 2003-09-05T00:42:01</h3>
Whether or not it is handy, that is debatable. Whether it works well is another matter. The URL it returns for me is [213.224.83.72]... which appears to be the address off the other side of the proxy server I must use. So it completely ignores the "HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR" header, which points towards [213.224.4.165]. Yeah, <em>that</em> is me!

By design, you must explicitly <i>distrust</i> any "forwarded for" headers, unless they come from an IP that you trust.
<p>
So, it's doing exactly the right thing.  Giving the address of the only IP that it can trust.</p>

Well, it could do a bit of both: "IP 1.2.3.4 (claims to be forwarding from IP 2.3.4.5)".
