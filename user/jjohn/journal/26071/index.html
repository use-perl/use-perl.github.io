<p>From <a href="http://chrisjuergensen.com.hosting.domaindirect.com/modes_3.htm">Chris Juergensen's site</a> on the Lydian mode:
<blockquote>
&laquo;Just like the previous two modes, to figure out on the spot what major 
scale you need to be playing.  Let's say you are jammin with your friends 
Bob and Pete and the chart they give you says you have to play a solo over a 
<b>G maj7#11 vamp</b>.  You need to figure out what major scale you need to 
be playing so you just remember your lydian scale mode rule which is: lydian 
mode = major scale up a perfect 5th.  Remember how this works?  If G is on 
the third fret, D is a perfect fifth from that note.  All you have to do is 
play a D major scale over the Gmaj7#11 chord and you'll be groovin' away with 
the lydian mode.&raquo;</blockquote>
<p>Friends don't let friends vamp on Gmaj7#11 chords.  Only junkies messed up 
on  Chic Corea or the Mahavishnu Orchestra would have such abnormal and 
unclean thoughts.</p>
<p><b>UPDATE:</b> What's sad is that I googled for both of these names and still got them wrong.  Sigh...</p>

<cite>Only junkies messed up on Chic Korea</cite>[sic]<cite> or the Mahasvishnu</cite>[sic]<cite> Orchestra would have such abnormal and unclean thoughts.</cite><br><br>I spent most of my final year of high school trying to play "Spain" from Return to Forever's "Light as a Feather" album.  I never got it smooth enough.   I did manage to get a couple of tunes from "Where Have I Known You Before" to an acceptable level though.  While I still have my Fender Rhodes from those days, I wish I had those chops; I lost most of them during my college years.<br><br>Currently in the MP3 directory on my work computer:<br><ul> <li>Mahavishnu Orchestra - Birds of Fire</li><li>Return to Forever - Where Have I Known You Before</li> <li>Chick Corea - The Chick Corea Elektric Band</li> </ul><br>I've had abnormal and unclean musical thoughts for about 30 years now and I'm still lovin' it.
