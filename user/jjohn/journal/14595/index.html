self-styled "Hacker of social systems" that there is a
reason he has two ears and only one mouth. <p>As a
low-level hacker he needed to elicit support from others to
get his work recognised and included. He was unwilling to
listen to advice and criticism from those who know a lot
better than him, and his work was not of such obvious
brilliance that people were prepared to accept it without
change. <p>He was not prepared to make the changes folks
wanted, so he took his ball and went away in a
strop.</blockquote>  <p>(<a
