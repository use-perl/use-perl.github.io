<p>The origins of this <a href="http://www.stemnet.nf.ca/CITE/valentine.htm">Day of Love</a> are somewhat unclear. There are those who attribute the holiday to Rome, others blame a Christian saint and still other folks believe that this is just another <a href="http://members.aol.com/xmaspiracy/0/why_bible.htm">excuse to sell cards</a>. Whatever its origin, St. Valentine's day tends to exacerbate tensions in a relationship, put pressure on the single to, er, double, and set up another ideal no one can match. Other than that, it's a great holiday.

<p>Think of all the <a href="http://www.dotcom.org/ntac/">poor slobs</a> who are alone on this holiday. How many <a href="http://www.bankrate.com/brm/news/cc/20020128a.asp">Hallmark commercials</a> must they be forced to endure? The festive pink holiday bunting at local pharmacies must be fire hazzard of some kind. And if you love someone, why are you giving them chocolate treats to expand their <a href="http://www.nutricise.com/basics/hips_basics_chap1.html">problem areas</a>? This is all madness!

<p>The cynical among you might say that my criticisms are the product of a failed relationship whose anniversary fell on this day. Others may lay the blame at a severe beating I received on this day as child for absconding with a supply <a href="http://www.necco.com/Sweethearts%20are%20in%20Fashion.htm">Necco Wafer hearts</a>. Of course, who could forget the dressing down I received from Headmaster when chum Phineas broke his leg whilst jumping from a tall tree all those many Valentine's days ago?
<p>To my critics, I say: feh! And feh again! The quality of my analysis stands on its own without deconstruction. Valentine's day is a <i>humbug</i>! Now, leave to eat my wretched Necco's in peace...

<h2>*G*  That brings back plenty of memories</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/chaoticset/">chaoticset</a> on 2002-02-14T15:41:24</h3>
For roughly four or five years I shared your viewpoint heartily, to the point that I would drop all obligations on that day.  Nobody, not the current gf, the ex-gf, school or work got me on that day.  I sat in and ate several pints of B&amp;J's each time.
<p>
Over the years, though, my deep-seated hatred has burned out and become a smouldering, faint distaste.  It's pretty much a day like any other if you ignore the stores.</p>

<p>Why ruin perfectly good hatred of Hallmark Holidays? Besides you either get the sappy guy who fawns all over you with chocolates and flowers which are boring and cliche' or you get the guy who doesn't remember so all your girlfriends then tell you what an asshole your boyfriend is. I say we declare Hallmark part of the Axis of evil and bomb them!<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<h2>Irony</h2>

Ireland's copying the nation she most hated"

--WordNet
<p>If one looks at this journal entry carefully, it appears to be an embittered diatribe against celebrating Valentine's day. But why would any serious vitriol end with an invition to make contact with the author for clearly romatic purposes? For that matter, why would the author claim to have experienced an incident from John Knowles, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0553280414" title="amazon.com">A Seperate Peace</a amazon.com>? Either the author is mad or there is more going on here than what appears on the surface.</p>
