<div class="span8">
<p><p>Several weeks ago, I bought a 512MB iPod shuffle.  Without question, 
this is the most excite consumer electronic device I've come across since I 
saw my first walkman in the 80s (I don't include the PC as a consumer 
electronic device).  There is almost nothing I don't like about this beast.
It's got a long battery life (~10 hours); it's very light and tiny; it's got 
a respectable storage capacity (about 140 songs at the bitrate I encode MP3s 
at) and nearly NO MOVING PARTS!  It's simply awesome.  So taken with it was I,
that I bought one for my brother's 45 birthday and now he's a fan.
<p>Some have wrung their hands at the lack of a display on the shuffle or the
limit size of the storage.  These complaints are fundamentally misguided.  The 
shuffle is not meant to be the sole repository of your MP3 collection (a linux box with a RAID system is :-).  Those using iPods for this purpose are, I 
think, foolish.  The shuffle is fills the niche that the cassette walkman did,
listening to random tunes on the go.
<p>The problem with the iPod is that it is too much of a computer and not 
enough of an appliance.  Let's start with the hard drive.  I don't like 'em.
There, I said it.  Hard drives are complicated little beasts that spin 
platters and will, someday, have a head crash.  Notebook hard drives are to be
especially despised.  Low RPMs combined with a strangled I/O bus produces an 
utterly retro computing experience for laptop users.  And notebook hard 
drives are at the heart of the iPod.  Do iPods need terrific I/O throughput? 
No.  And what's more, I don't want to be thinking of I/O at all when I want 
some tunes on the go.  I want to be a computer Barbie.  I just want it to work.
Always.  The first time.  For this, the shuffle delivers.
<p>Before I dig too deep a hole, I should mention that I think the iPod is a 
pretty cool computer hack.  But I think it's a terrible appliance.  It can do
too much.</p>
<p>So, the shuffle: fun at any speed.  Get one.</p>
<p>For my next Apple purchase, I'm looking at getting a Mac mini with 512MB 
of RAM.  I need it for Safari (*cough* browser compatibility *cough*), so I 
don't need a lot of horsepower.  Should be interesting.</p></p>

The iPod shuffle is a cool little thing.  I don't like how iTunes currently integrates with iPod (basically, I need to keep two libraries, as my main library is lossless, and I need to keep the files much smaller for the iPod), and that is the one thing I think Apple really needs to solve.  But that's me.<br> <br>And it should be simple too<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... put the smaller files in a Caches directory, and have an option to either shrink them as you add them to the Library (if you know you will put all your files on your iPod anyway, like I do), or to do it on-demand (which might be better for shuffle users), and only use those smaller files for the iPod or other music player (or optionally even for Sharing).<br> <br>Yes, it takes up HD space, but big deal.  It's optional, and off by default.<br> <br>Anyhoo.<br>
