<p><p>A lot has happened since my last journal and I have starved my 
loyal reader(s?) enough.

<P>Computer maintenance, like taxes, is something long dreaded, yet 
unavoidable. For years, my main email address has been jjohn@cs.umb.edu. 
One of the perks of graduating as a Computer Science major from 
UMass/Boston is that I have an email address for life. As an alumnus, 
I'm only allowed to log into one machine: alumni.cs.umb.edu. Sure, the 
machine was a pokey and didn't have things like 'lynx' on it, but who cares. 
All I needed was POP3 service. Until last week, this is just fine with me.
Unfortunately for me, this machine is off this weeking during which 
time a new alumni.cs.umb.edu machine will take its place. I have no
idea if my mail is bouncing (I suspect not), but I can't check my 
mail until the new machine is up. 

<P>Sigh.

<P><b>UPDATE</b>: After thinking about the problem more, I found another 
host that allows me POP3 access to my mail. 61 new mail messages. Huzzah!

<P>Yesterday I went to a career day (i.e. cattle call) that Red Hat sponsored.
It was in Westford, MA and getting there from Boston without owning a car
was indeed challenging. However, I am a resourceful critter. Despite
the recessed economy, I expected only a handful of people to be there. 
I still consider Linux a minor player in the big scheme of things and 
I assume that only a small number of people have even heard about 
Red Hat. 

<P>Boy was I wrong. 

<P>About a thousand people showed up for 8 positions (not all of them 
technical). I was just stunned. If it weren't for the suits and 
worried looks in line, one might have thought Elvis was in the Building
by the size of the line to get into the interviewing area. Although 
I know I could do the job I "interviewed" for (OS Engineer), I 
don't believe I'm going to make the final cut. While it's true 
that I've been using Linux for years and I've used Red Hat in particular
for several of them, I most believe that there are at least two 
programmers in that crowd that will appear more desirable than me.
It's just a question of numbers. 

<P>It was a good experience for me, though. It removes the sense of 
complacency that I've developed during my hiatus. Plus, I got to look 
sharp wearing one of my suits.

<P>On the way to the cattle call I read the Boston Metro, a new 
"newspaper" that's given away often near T-stations. One story 
that caught my attention concerned the recovery of an Indian 
infant who had his <em>dead twin brother removed from his abdomen</em>. 
What a freak show! In other news, the Metro also reported that
beer can protect its consumers against "heart attacks, stroke, hypertension,
diabetes and <em>dementia</em>." I guess beer won't make you crazy. 
Finally, the Metro scraped the bottom of the news barrel with this item
"Super-sized = Super Obese." In what can only be properly termed 
"a pentrating glimpse into the obvious," the Metro reported:

<P>
<blockquote>
Many overweight children and adults get a large portion of their
calories by consuming too many sodas and sweetened juices and 
beverages. Sweetened drinks + "super-sized" meals + the convenience
of fast food + a decrease in physical activity = a recipe for 
obesity.
</blockquote>

<P>A believe that the Metro's message will be better grasped by this 
year's Massachusetts students because they ranked 31st in their 
SAT scores. That's right: We're Number 31! We're Number 31! Take 
THAT Arkansas!</p>
