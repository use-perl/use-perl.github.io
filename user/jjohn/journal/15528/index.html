These blogs are getting more coherent.  I fear I've created something with <a href="http://startrek.epguides.info/?ID=349" title="epguides.info">emergent intelligence</a epguides.info>!

how long are the chains you're using?  (word,word)-&gt;word?

Yes.  Just a two word chain.  Or is it three?  Either way, you've got it.  I tried longer chains, but those weren't as much fun.  As previously mentioned, I modified the markov code listed in K&amp;P's <i>The Practice of Programming</i>.
