<p><p>On my travels through techland, I had an opportunity to try out the Linux-on-a-CD distribution <a href="http://www.knoppix/">Knoppix</a>.  I 
was impressed with the l'il wonder.  The AMD 1.3G test machine booted up with 
all the hardware detected and working.  It booted into a tricked out version 
of KDE that had such hidden googies as Remote Desktop support (RDP and VNC) 
as well as "Video Conferencing" software, whatever that may have been.  For 
my purposes, I didn't particulary need a desktop, but I was very encouraged by
the direction Linux GUIs are heading. 
<p>What I need to be able to boot a machine with the CDROM, but with some 
addition customization.  The solution was to write a shell script to configure
the NIC, reset the account passwords and start network processes like SSH. 
But since I only had a volital storage system, I needed a place for the script.
<p>Then I stole the installation trick Ximian had used.  I placed my shell
scripted on a web server.  Whenever the machine reboots, someone (me) has to 
log into the box, change to root, and type:
<blockquote>
<code># wget http://url/to/script | sh</code>
</blockquote>
<p>And then the box is ready to go!  While there are advantages to modify the 
CDROM to include this file, there are other advantages to using only stock CD 
images from knoppix.  The fun never ends!
