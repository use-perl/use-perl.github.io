<p><p>While waiting for the immanent return of Farscape, I've been collecting the series on DVD.  ADV films has done a wonderful job of
making these DVDs.  The extra features included on these discs are
context-sensative, so that when you read something about a character
like D'Argo, the information is relevant to that season covered
(life about Moya can be complicated at times).  Season 3 was a strong one
for Farscape and one episode I've longed to see again is on this DVD:
Revenging Angel, in which (Moya) Crighton gets knocked into a "coma"
and the viewer is treated to a delightful montage of Warner Brothers style
cartoons.
<p>I love it when the Farscape writers go nuts.

<h2>An Award, Even!</h2>

Guy Gross (their composer) won the Australian Guild of Screen Composers' "Best Music for an Animation" Screen Music Award for that ep.
<p>
I liked that ep okay, but the writing didn't feel as tight as in other eps.  (Ben's ep, for example, is one of my five favorites.  It was very good, especially considering they didn't hire him for his writing.)</p>

Yes, I too very much enjoyed "Green Eyed Monster."  Although I will need to watch those eps again, it seems like the writing in Season 4 frequently missed the mark early on.  The end of the season was pretty good though and WHAT A SEASON CHILFHANCGER!

Yeah...way to make your audience's chin drop.
<p>
Of course, John's been <em>decapitated</em> before, with no real ill effects afterwards, so this fits right in with every cliffhanger they've had before, really...</p>
