Spag ends 68 years of family control with sale 
By Adam Gorlick, Associated Press, 10/9/2002 16:25
SHREWSBURY, Mass. (AP) Spag's Supply Co., a central Massachusetts institution beloved by generations of bargain-hungry shoppers, is being sold to another locally owned discount retailer. 
<br /><br />
The sprawling Shrewsbury complex started by Anthony ''Spag'' Borgatti in 1934 and still run by his family, will be sold to Building 19, a discount chain with 14 locations in New England, the companies announced Wednesday. 
<br /><br />
But the old and new owners, who have been friends for 30 years, said Spag's would keep its character, and even part of its name, as the new 'Spag's 19.'

<p>From my early childhood growing up outside of Worcester, I was terrorized by the oversized novelity head of Tony "Spag" Borgatti that glowered, like a real-life Big Brother, from billboards all across town. My father often took me to Spags on some errand of domestic import that consistently eluded my apprehension.
<p>The first impression of Spag's is one of smell. The store has, or at least had then, a large lawn and garden section so the acrid smell of mulch and fertilizer assaults all new arrivals. Like a bad software project, the main building at Spag's was continually under construction (in those days) to accommodate the ever-expanding inventory of housewares. Of course, the place was totally unnavigatable by the uninitiated -- a regular Minoan maze.
<p>It was the Home Depot of its day.
<p>Alas, it appears the <a href="http://www.spags.com/">web site</a> is offline. </p>

Hmmm..... <i>"domestic import"</i> <br> <br>Ins't that a contradiction?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)<br>
