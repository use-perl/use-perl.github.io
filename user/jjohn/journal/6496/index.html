<p><p>Last year comedian Paul Poundstone <a href="http://wire.ap.org/?FRONTID=ARTS&SLUG=PEOPLE%2dPAULA%2dPOUNDSTONE">lost custody of her three adopted children</a> because
she drove drunk with them. Now, I'm not going to 
say I support drunk driving, because I don't. However, both my brothers and my father have been 
four sheets to the wind while dragging me around.
Is this safe? Hell no. All of them have been in automobile accidents. Should I have been removed 
from my family? Hell no. Nobody is perfect and one can only hope that the legal barrier that allows the state  to take children away from their parents is sufficiently high. 
<p>On the other hand if Poundstone forced her kids to watch <i>Survivor</i>, I would not only endorse the remove of her children, but also the immediate liquidation of them. Some things you can mess around with.  </p>

Random recollection: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0674004698" title="amazon.com">Lani Guinier</a amazon.com> was on <a href="http://www.booktv.org/schedule/" title="booktv.org">BookTV</a booktv.org> the other day, and (in an aside) said something about how the reason that drug "abuse" is punished much more vigorously than drunk driving (filling prisons instead of suspending licenses), is because drug use is perceived as a vice of those shiftless lower classes and minorities, not <em>generally</em> a problem of <a href="http://www.theonion.com/onion3825/stoner_uncle.html" title="theonion.com">the sort of people that one knows</a theonion.com>.
