<div class="span8">
<p><p>or <em>Me write good someday!</em><p>I don't understand blogging.  That is to say, I don't understand how some 
blogs attract a following and others do not.  Blogging, or as the old folks 
used to call it <em>journaling</em> (as in "Yesterday, I was down at 
Tealicious Teas <em>journaling</em> some rage when the baristas announced that
the steamer had crapped out."), is at best 
<a href="http://dear_raed.blogspot.com/">amateur journalism</a> and at worst 
<a href="http://use.perl.org/user/jjohn/journal/16210">random words</a> 
interspersed with 
<a href="http://use.perl.org/user/TorgoX/journal/16246">hyperlinks</a>.  Blogging 
even gets co-opted into <a href="http://blog.johnkerry.com/blog/archives/000871.html">hawking political candidates</a>.  So what is attractive about blogs?  
Why are so many of them and how many people are really reading them?
<p>This first question is easy enough to answer.  Anyone who was watched the 
smile of unbridled joy creep across the face of a toddler screaming full bore 
on a crowded airplane should have some insight into the 
<A href="http://www.noopy.org/bloghorn/">psychic benefits</a> of blogging.  
Without restraint, without mediation, and frequently without 
spell checking, millions of internet users can burp out the smallest of ideas 
in a forum accessible to the most of the planet at the speed of e-business.  
Finally, the information-starved citizens of 
<a href="http://depts.washington.edu/uwch/silkroad/cities/samarkand/samarkand.html">Samarkand, Transoxiana</a> can get the 4-1-1 on which 
<a href="http://midlifemama.blogspot.com/2003_08_09_midlifemama_archive.html">peaches work best in pies</a> 
and why <a href="http://www.slolane.org/archives/000346.html">Wal-Mart sucks</a>.  
Unfortunately every road as a few <a href="http://www.dailyrotten.com/">potholes</a>, even the Information Superhighway.  In fact, the very concept of 
blogging has <a href="http://www.ojr.org/ojr/workplace/1049381758.php">its 
critics</a>, even among those <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/pudge/journal/14328">those</A> that write blogging software.  
<p>So, blogging is perhaps the rawest form of publication possible, barring 
mechanical telepathy or do-it-yourself TV stations.  The barrier is too low 
to prevent otherwise quiet people from casting their electronic 
messages in bottles into the World Wide Webby sea.  But then why are other people, who 
may or may not themselves be blogging, reading these missives?  Almost by 
definition, blogs are humble, unedited things.  They are compositions that were 
blitted out to screen with as little bureaucracy as possible.  Most journals  
appear to be something akin to a Tourettes episode involving a 
keyboard.  How can blogs compete for eyeballs in a world filled with many 
intelligent, thoughtful, professionally editted articles? 
<p>The difference between a crank and a critic is that a critic gets paid.  
However, cranks are often a lot more fun <A href="http://www.toynbee.net/">to 
observe</a>.  They have a train-wreck quality whose enormous gravitational 
pull will not be denied.  Few media are better suited for cranks than blogs. 
If it is not for the <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/">objective reportage</a>, then it must be for the genuinely human stories that blogs are consumed.  
It must be the mispellings; the incomprehensible rants; the utterly obscure 
trivia; the prosiac reviews of

<p>I don't know what makes for a popular blog and I'm unlikely to invest the 
time necessary to solve that mystery.  Blogs are simply the graffiti our 
times.  In an increasingly isolated world, it is nice to know that that 
you aren't the only crank with a computer.  
<p>For those angling to hone their <a href="http://www.homestarrunner.com/sbemail58.html">bloginating skills</a>, 
I do have a word of advice comes on the heels of this bit of compositional 
wisdom from <A href="http://www.rabbitblog.com/2003_12_01_rabbitblog_archive.html#107030874864127312">Rabbitblog</a>:
<blockquote>
&laquo;The critic who says you shouldn't write in run-on sentences 
and shouldn't use clich&eacute;s? That critic you can kill.&raquo;
</blockquote>
<p>While I admire the freedom expressed this guideline, I would suggest 
using some restraint in allowing run-on sentences to proliferate in your blog. 
So risking absurdity, I end this journal with this blogging rule of thumb:
<blockquote>
<i>Run-on sentences, like profanity, should be used strategically, 
since it is the exuberant overuse of these oft-maligned parts of speech that 
mightly tax the reader's attention and damage your ability to drive home 
the fucking point.</i>
</blockquote>

<h2>it's the same mindset</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/hfb/">hfb</a> on 2003-12-11T21:56:35</h3>
<p>that feeds the 'reality TV' dreck. I usually only read blogs of people I know or who somehow make their own content instead of just joining in on the linktastic circle jerk that is most of the popular blogs. There are too many blogs, too many bad blogs, and people will get tired of scanning 100 or more blogs when one quick skim of popdex is enough. Also as more people lose their jobs and get sued by spewing words in public it'll jump the shark and people will sit on the couch and gaze at their navel instead. I'm constantly amazed that people actually read mine.</p>

And speaking about that, I'm noticing that "jumping the shark" is jumping the shard, as an expression. <br>:)

Forgive me for expounding upon a typo, but...
<blockquote><div> <em>Jumping The Shard</em>:  Defined as the point in a creative person's life where they begin producing output that is no longer of the high quality it once was.  References "The Dark Crystal", where Jim Henson 'jumped the shard'.  Also references "Jumping the shark", in which an entire production company or group of actors does this simultaneously.  In use:  "It's widely believed by many that Chris Carter jumped the shard with Millenium."</div></blockquote>
Ah, new and entirely imaginary LANGUAGE!
