<p>You are so cool. There is a series of variables, tied tothe order of data in a list, and assigning one variable to
each data element in that list. Except now, we've done it
in a single assignment, and greatly clarified the intent.
The data elements are coming into the program in one group,
and we are treating them as a single group. Our program is
now closer to matching our view of the world. <p> But
that's not the only improvement we can make. Remember that
<tt>@list</tt> variable? Why did it exist in the first
place, doubly so because it's <i>still</i> in use. Using
salted passwords was the norm in the <i>1980s</i>, back
before Win3.1 was even conceived. <p> &nbsp; <p> [1] At one
point, the interminably long "product activation keys" used
by all Microsoft products was outed: it was about 2 hours
work, with about another hour to fix up all the tests. So
everyone - make sure you aren't logged in on any other
terminals.</p> <p>Sigh. Maybe I'll go do a google search
and see who else has had this.

Man! You have gone disappeared into dark side. I'm impressed, yet frightened all at once.

Truly inspired.  I particularly enjoy the tagline.<br> <br>If you get ambitious, you could run it against well-known bloggers like Andrew<br>Sullivan or Tom Tomorrow.<br>
