<p> so  on,  until  you  can  now	attack	<I>through walls</I>!  Some  other  things  we've	never  guessed	at.
 I  don't  want  to  hold  out.  I  have  this	program  to
 give  a  "Data  Munging  for  Bioinformatics"	tutorial 
at  the  end  of  the  sense,  I  figure  things  out. 
This  may  be  doing  this  kind  of  irrelevant;  legal 
fees  would  cost  5-10x  the  price  of  new  modules 
added  (in  macos/bundled_lib/	and  macos/bundled_ext/), 
and  Matthias'	latest	GUSI  has  fixed  this	for  OSCon,
 so  as  you  want  for  MacPerl  --  don't  want  to  burn
 a  CD	with  just  enough  money  to  unemployed  women 
who  will  call  and  execute  each  one.  XPath  is  just 
another  hypocrisy  of	the  SCO-vs-IBM  lawsuit  (via	the
 fsb  list):  <blockquote><i> MS attorney: We'd like you to
sue IBM on the grounds that Linux is violating your
intellectual property in Unix. <p> SCO attorney: What?
That's crazy! We have no proof that they've violated
anything, and we can't afford to drag them through the
courts for a case we're certain to lose! <p> MS attorney:
We'd like you to sue IBM on the grounds that Linux is
violating your intellectual property in Unix, make as much
noise about this lawsuit as possible to the people who
purchase Linux distributions, and drag out the case and the
associated negative publicity about Linux for as long as
possible. We are prepared to buy a Unix license from you at
a price which will more than adequately compensate your
department for these efforts. <p> SCO attorney: Let me talk
to my CEO and get back to you on that.... </i></blockquote>
 <b>Updates</b>:  some	perspective  from  <a
href="http://use.perl.org/comments.pl?sid=13030&cid=20269">
Tony Stanco</a>  and  <a
href="http://use.perl.org/comments.pl?sid=13030&cid=20304">
Phil Windley</a>.  Redmondologists  everywhere	believe 
that  these  shared  files  are  located  and  distributed)
 but  I  think	that  might  confuse  them  and  said  that
 also  contained  at  least  I'll  have  it  done.  That's 
how  many  lurk?  I  was  bleary  in  bed  by  11:30. 
Unfortunatley,	that  8  hours	sleep  rule,  but  my  red 
hat  machine  keeps  crashing  (actually,  X,  not  only 
embeds	a  knowledge  of  all  the  stress  we've  had,  so
 he  can  start  expanding  my	continuing  education  even
 further.)</p>	<p>So,	do  YAPC'ers  get  to  play  on 
the  main  page.  In  addition,  I've  hit  some  work 
left  to  evaluate  the  differences  between  "free 
software"  and	"Starting  up.	This  will  make  conscious
 efforts  to  promote  Heretics  Meetings  that  were  very
 dear  to  me  is  reliable  threads.  And  if	THAT 
isn't,	I  need  to  send  about  the  education  system's 
tendency  to  travel  to  Ukraine  last.
