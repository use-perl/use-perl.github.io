<p><p>Some thoughts on Bush's <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/2704365.stm">state of the union</a>.

<p><b>It's the economy stupid</b>.

<blockquote>
<p>And under my plan, as soon as I have signed the bill, this extra money will start showing up in workers' pay cheques.  

<p>Instead of gradually reducing the marriage penalty, we should do it now.  

<p>Instead of slowly raising the child credit to a thousand dollars, we should send the cheques to American families now.   
</blockquote>

<p>Payroll taxes contribute to the bulk of federal revenue. Bush wants a 
costly war in Iraq. Why do I not see the payroll taxes not being cut but 
increased?

<blockquote>
<p>To boost investor confidence, and to help the nearly 10 million 
seniors who receive dividend income, I ask you to end the unfair 
double taxation of dividends.  

</blockquote>
<p>Oh right, it's the <em>seniors</em> who need capital gains cut. Riiight.

<blockquote>
And that is a good benchmark for us: Federal spending should not rise any faster than the pay cheques of American families.    
</blockquote>

<p>Ah compassionate conservativism! Exactly how many congressman were 
downsized last year to make a fitter, leaner government for the shareholders?
<p><i>I feel your pain.</i>

<p><b>It only hurts when I laugh</b>.
<blockquote>
<p>To improve our health care system, we must address one of the prime causes of higher costs - the constant threat that physicians and hospitals will be unfairly sued.  

<p>Because of excessive litigation, everybody pays more for health care - and many parts of America are losing fine doctors.  
</blockquote>

<p>So out-of-control health care costs are directly the result of malpractice 
suits? <a href="https://www.healthnet.com/brokers/pdf/June_2002_Health_Care_Focus.pdf">PriceWaterhouseCoopers doesn't think so</a> (although they do cite it
one of the factors).

<p><b>Smog doesn't kill people -- I do</b>.
<blockquote>
I have sent you Clear Skies legislation that mandates a 70% cut in air pollution from power plants over the next 15 years.  
</blockquote>

<p>The Kyoto plan was <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/1820584.stm">deemed harmful to business</a> so instead Bush wants to give a tax break for 
compliance. The Sierra Club is unconvinced of the <a href="http://www.sierraclub.org/cleanair/action/clear_skies.asp">efficacy of Bush's plan.</a> 
(Of course, the Sierra Club is nothing but a pack of dirty hippies.) 
I hope you bought stock in bottled air.

If by payroll taxes you include income tax, then perhaps you are right, but usually "payroll taxes" refers to the specific taxes for Medicare and Social Security.<br> <br>As to the war: he didn't use the words, but the words are "deficit spending."  A great many economists believe that a very good way to kickstart a bad economy is to cut taxes and to increase certain spending, which means a budget deficit, which you have to deal with later.  This isn't necessarily a bad thing; however, it makes you wonder about why we didn't do more to pay down the debt when we had the chance.<br> <br>As to dividend tax cuts: yes, stocks are the primary revenue of many seniors -- not just rich ones -- and dividend tax cuts will help them.  Of course, helping seniors is not the point of the proposed measure.<br> <br>As to congressmen: your argument would have more force if you questioned the cutting of congressional staffs and budgets, instead of congresspeople themselves<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...<br> <br>As to health care costs: it is not the only factor, and maybe not the primary one, but it is a major one.  And more to the point, it is the one that is specifically driving doctors themselves out of work.  It is the reason why doctors left PA, the reason why there is not one trauma center in Las Vegas.  The rest of the costs can be passed on to the HMOs and health care plans, but when a doctor faces hundreds of thousands of dollars a year in litigation insurance, he is screwed.<br> <br>Also, this is the only major factor of rising health care costs that is not currently being addressed, in some way.  It's not like the costs of drugs and other expenses are not being worked on (as they have been for a decade now<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...).<br> <br>As to pollution: hey, I'm breathing fine.  Screw it.<br>

The tax rebate was only a part of it, and hindsight is always 20-20.  The federal government increased spending at the same time it gave the tax rebate (for clarity, I don't consider a tax rebate "spending", I consider it what it is: a decrease in revenue; I am talking about increasing the actual budget, not decreasing the amount of money they have to spend on it).  Perhaps the tax rebate shouldn't have been given, but <em>surely</em> spending should not have been increased.<br> <br>FWIW, we bought a chair with ours.

<p>It's not the malpractice insurance, it's the entire industry rotting from the core from extortion/soprano-esque pricing schemes for drugs and pharmaceuticals, severe shortages of qualified nurses and doctors, and an antiquated billing system and records system that creaks under the weight of the load. My mother is a retired MD and even she's shocked that it costs $15 PER PILL for her osteoperosis drugs that she can purchase herself as the medicade $300 per year benefit is pathetic. Bush's talk did nothing to explain where the magic is going to come from to address the very serious condition the american medical system is in. If my mother's 40 years of experience in the profession and vision of the future is correct you're all screwed. Find a shaman and learn all they know.</p>

I am not saying those things are not problems.  But yes, malpractice insurance is a huge problem, too.  You can say it isn't, but a bunch of doctors, who walked out of the last Las Vegas trauma center to move to California where the malpractice awards for pain and suffering are capped at a quarter of a million dollars, say you're wrong.  Over 40 percent of ob/gyns in Nevada plan to leave the state.<br> <br>In Florida, some doctors are not delivering babies, because $250,000 of coverage costs $200,000.<br> <br>Ob/gyns in W. Virginia pay an average of $75,000 for liability insurance, while bordering states of Tennessee, Ohop, and Virginia pay $26K, $48K, and $30K.  Doctors are leaving W. Virginia in droves.<br> <br>Pennsylvania is fighting desperately to avoid the same fate: in Montgomery County, rates for malpractice insurance jumped from $269K to almost $1M, in one year.  An 11th hour state measure kept doctors from simply walking out, but it is only a very short-term band-aid.<br> <br>I am not saying there are not other problems.  But to say this is not a problem is to ignore the facts.<br> <br>Of course, more needs to be done.  But what Bush mentioned is only a starting point, and we have 535 members of Congress whose primary repsonsibility it is to deal with it.  Of course, since you want socialized medicine, whatever they come up with different from that, you will think is going to bring about the end of the world<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... but if your visions of the future were accurate, we would have been struck back to the Middle Ages years ago.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br>

<p>My mother was a doctor with over 40 years experience and <i>she</i> wants socialized medicine and with that much experience in the field I trust she knows more about the problems than most docs pandering to the politicians or you do. It won't be the end of the world but with an aging population there are going to be a lot of people who die for want of basic care as will a lot of children whose parents have no healthcare coverage. Malpractise insurance is just the tip of the iceburg. Spend a few years running triage in an emergency room in an urban trauma center and then see if you think Dubya isn't blowing smoke out his ass....or ask any medical professional for their opinion. A hospital doesn't run without nurses and some hospitals are running nurses on double shifts due to shortages. He said nothing about the critical issues, only the ones that would win him important republican votes.</p>

<p>Time will tell but it may be too late by the time anyone realises that the band-aid approach will be nothing for the influx of aging baby boomers.</p>

Lying?  Which is it?<br> <br>I trust these doctors know more about the problems they themselves face than you or your mother do.<br> <br> <em>Spend a few years running triage in an emergency room in an urban trauma center and then see if you think Dubya isn't blowing smoke out his ass....or ask any medical professional for their opinion.</em> <br> <br>See, that's just the thing: many, many medical professionals are saying this.  I am just repeating what they are saying.  You think they are pandering; sorry, but I don't believe a doctor in West Virginia would live away from his family, in Ohio, just so that he could pander to a politician.  I think that when he says he did it because he couldn't afford to practice with the high malpractice costs in West Virginia, that he is telling the truth.<br> <br> <em>He said nothing about the critical issues</em> <br> <br>Until you show me how the actual evidence I pointed to is incorrect, or means something other than what it appears to mean, I'll have to believe what it says:  that doctors are leaving states, or not practicing certain procedures, because the malpractice insurance is too high.  And I cannot see how that is not a critical issue, when it means that there is no trauma center in Las Vegas, and that some people need to drive hundreds (yes, hundreds) of miles to get to a doctor that will deliver babies.  I call that critical.<br> <br>Is it the most critical issue?  Perhaps not, but so what?  Congress already has a lot of work in progress on many of the other issues, some that you've mentioned, and some that you haven't.  That he didn't mention something doesn't mean it is important, or that it isn't going to be worked on.  That's a fallacy.<br>

<p>Then they should regulate the insurance industry for doctors just as they regulate it for automobile insurance in New England. It's still not a critical issue for the state of medical care in the US. You should also do some research into what doctors are paying such high premiums, in what areas and in what specialties as most of the doctors and surgeons I grew up with say that the cases in the media are not the norm.</p><p><p>You had your kid delivered by a midwife so how does reading the news make you an expert on the plight of doctors and hospitals across the US?</p>

<p>Before I begin, I would like to state for the record the futility of my entering this argument. However, I do occasionally tilt windmills.

</p><p><blockquote><div> <i>

</i> </div></blockquote>

<p>Malpractice insurance is too high. You and Dubya are correct. High malpractice insurance is demonstrably harming the quality of health care available in many areas of the US. That conclusion was also reached by the PriceWaterhouseCoopers report that I linked to in the original journal entry. Something must be done to stop these ruinous lawsuits, possibly involving bullets and lawyers.

</p><p>That's not the point that I or hfb is making. Malpractice rates are the tip of heath care iceberg that looms directly off our bow
[he said nautically]. What I found offensive of the state of the union was that Bush seemed to validate his agenda with slightly spurious points, or at least points that didn't seem entirely on point. In particular, suggesting that cutting the capital gains tax to "help seniors" is particularly disingenuous. Bush might have well said "we need to bomb Iraq for the children." At some level I agree with Bush's statements, but I not dumb enough to neglect the rhetorical impact of his obvious pandering to "Stupid People" (Al Franken's phrase). I don't like talking to salesmen because I don't like being manipulate in general and certainly not by someone so disrespectful of his own native tongue.

</p><p>Reforming malpractice law will not solve the general (and arguably more important) problem of universal health coverage (however you define that). My concern, and perhaps that of hfb, is that Bush equates fixing malpractice law alone with fixing the health care system. Treat the disease, not the symptoms.</p>

<em>That's not the point that I or hfb is making. Malpractice rates are the tip of heath care iceberg that looms directly off our bow [he said nautically].</em> <br> <br>And I conceded, <em>several times</em>, including my original post, that there are other issues to be dealt with.  So<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... ?<br> <br> <em>Reforming malpractice law will not solve the general (and arguably more important) problem of universal health coverage (however you define that). My concern, and perhaps that of hfb, is that Bush equates fixing malpractice law alone with fixing the health care system.</em> <br> <br>I get no indication at all that Bush thinks solving malpractice insurance will solve our health care problems.  Just the opposite, in fact: Bush mentioned reforming insurance (health, not malpractice), physician choice, help for seniors and the poor, control of medical decisions being returned to doctors and patients, strengthening Medicare with an additional $400B over 10 years.  He further recognized that fixing malpractice costs alone would not solve the problems when he said it was "one of the prime causes of higher costs."<br> <br>All told, Bush used 323 words to discuss health care, with 67 going to malpractice, and 132 to Medicare.  Your concern is apparently unjustified.<br> <br> <em>What I found offensive of the state of the union was that Bush seemed to validate his agenda with slightly spurious points, or at least points that didn't seem entirely on point. In particular, suggesting that cutting the capital gains tax to "help seniors" is particularly disingenuous.</em> <br> <br>You seem to think that this is unique to Bush.  Almost every politician does this, including every President in my lifetime.  That doesn't excuse it, and I wish it were different, but<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... I guess I am more concerned with what I think are more substantive problems.<br> <br>Anyway, the State of the Union is not the time and place for Bush to make a detailed case for every plan.  He has about one paragraph, or less, of text to introduce the plan and say what is good about it.  The details come later (or in the case of the dividend tax cut, sooner, as it has been all over the news recently).  Yes, he could have chosen a more honest way to introduce it, but this particular tax has several purposes to it (tax relief, encouraging investment, creating jobs, helping the stock market), each one interrelated to the other, and no matter how he explains it, it will be insufficient.<br> <br>The whole State of the Union, if taken in isolation, is for "stupid people."  A lot of people were surprised to learn about the things Bush revealed in regard to Iraq; I had heard every bit of it before, in more detail, except for the part about the mobile weapons labs.  The State of the Union is not the place for detail; if you are a "stupid person," then you couldn't handle the detail anyway, and if you are not, you will set forth to learn more on your own.  For better or worse, the purpose of the State of the Union is for the President to outline -- emphasis on "outline" -- his agenda for the coming year.<br> <br>I agree with you that what he said about seniors was somewhat disingenuous, not because it wasn't true, but because it gave a skewed view of the reality.  But this is not the place for complete reality.  It can't be.  It would last 5 or 6 hours if it were, and we would still be unsatisfied with its completeness.<br>
