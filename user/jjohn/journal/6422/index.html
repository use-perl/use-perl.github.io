Undoubtedly, the military remains the United StatesÃ¢â¬â¢ strongest card; in fact, it is the only card. Today, the United States wields the most formidable military apparatus in the world. And if claims of new, unmatched military technologies are to be believed, the U.S. military edge over the rest of the world is considerably greater today than it was just a decade ago. But does that mean, then, that the United States can invade Iraq, conquer it rapidly, and install a friendly and stable regime? Unlikely. Bear in mind that of the three serious wars the U.S. military has fought since 1945 (Korea, Vietnam, and the Gulf War), one ended in defeat and two in drawsÃ¢â¬ânot exactly a glorious record.

<p>--<a href="http://www.foreignpolicy.com/issue_julyaug_2002/wallerstein.html">Immanuel Wallerstein's <i>The Eagle has Crash Landed</i></a>

<p>Wallerstein's analysis of US foreign policy and fading US hegemony is mostly cogent (although I don't agree with his assertion that World War I+II should be seen merely as a US-German conflict). As the US wanes in power, I hope that we can do so more gracefully than Mother England. I also hope that our ideological child Japan does a better job at running the world than we did.

<p>On the bright side, this may all be so much liberal pablum and everything is just fine. </p>

<h2>Good Cop Bad Cop</h2>

Sure, the US government is pissing away all our resources on ineffectual wars.  The question is why.  I think the short answer is: oil.  Too much oil money is controlling US policy.  Instead of pouring DoD-sized money into finding ways of doing without oil, the federal government is pouring it into shadier and ever-more-bungling attempts at insuring that the oil supply is predictable -- which it does by catering to the increasing infantilism of the (made-to-order) ruling class in the Middle Eastern countries.

<p>Maybe the current US government/corporate "leadership" have got some half-articulated harebrained notion that in a few years, the HIV infection rate in the Middle East will rise to Botswana-like levels (which is probably true), and that that will suddenly and miraculously pacify those countries (which is probably not true) so that they can be cajoled into selling away all their land and oil for a month's supply of protease inhibitors.</p>

Odd thing about the topic "Golden Years" -- after having heard the Bowie song only a few times in my life, suddendly now I've heard it played as muzak -- twice in the past week -- in two different supermarkets!

<p>Like the song says:  "Whop whop whop!"</p>
