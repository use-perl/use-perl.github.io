I could rant for pages about how insanely irresponsible it is to have a baby because "what else should I do?"
<p>
I won't.
</p><p>
I will say -- hopefully enough -- that <a href="http://www.snopes2.com/pregnant/blackout.htm" title="snopes2.com">stories of population explosion could be greatly exaggerated</a snopes2.com>.</p>

You assume the reason is "what else should I do."  My wife had been pregnant for two months when Sept. 11 came 'round, and in our heads, we thought two opposing thoughts: that we don't want to bring a child into such a horrible situation, and that we should focus more on our family now than ever, because it's the most important thing.<br> <br>A lot of people just realized that family isn't something you should put off, whether that meant starting or enlarging their family, or spending more time with their existing ones.  Whether or not they acted on that and decided to have kids, I don't know.  But the realization I speak of could be a part of it; OTOH, so could the fact that everyone was afraid to leave the house, and humped like rabbits, and babies often are a result of humping (whether like rabbits or not).

<p>
I assume it because that's what some people I've asked have literally said to me; I understand that there are people who have children for reasons.  My problem is with thoughtless behavior.
</p><p>
It's that or assume they're lying to me, and I generally presuppose that people don't have a reason to lie to me.  Usually, they don't.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)</p>

Well, your statement was in the context of generalities; you didn't say or hint you were speaking only of specific people.

<p>I was starting to think that it was a disease borne in the water supply at work making just about every female look like they swallowed a watermelon...well, that or malnutrition. I don't get the logic that bombing = the desire to procreate. I mean, I can see how doomsday may make you want to hump like the end of the world but...'gee honey, let's bring a new life into this fucked up world!' Maybe I missed that day in school. Time to buy stock in Gerber Baby Foods...or whichever conglomerate owns them...Beatrice perhaps. Don't procreate, capitalate<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) </p>

<p>The author of that book is a nutcase even going to the extreme of getting an egg fertilized and implanted just so she could have another kid at 51. I'm very happy to see the book bomb.</p>
