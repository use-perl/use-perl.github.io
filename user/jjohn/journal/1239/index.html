<p><p>This entry's a bit off topic, but what the hell.
<p>I was out with some friends this week attending the antique 
book fair at the Hynes Convention center. Although I'm not a
collector of old and rare books, I do like to look at them.
Having collected comics, I know how anal retentive hobbyists 
can be about their stuff. 
<p>At least, I thought I did. 
<p>An ugly incident occurred at the show where three of us
(all male) were looking at the hardcover edition of the works of 
Dali. I had read this book in my high school art classes and I 
was reeling in the years. I believe our little group was laughing 
or something equally anarchic when the old biddy that ran the booth 
came over and curtly said "the price is one the <em>front</em> 
cover!". That's salesmanship. At almost thirty years old, I'm not 
all that comfortable being yelled at for laughing. Especially for 
reading an art book. That was only <em>$135</em>! Expensive? A bit, 
but you must understand that books at this fair often carry price tags
in the thousands or dozens of thousands of dollars. This book was 
not a centerpiece item and IT WAS OUTSIDE ANY PROTECTIVE CASE! 
Oh well, my bad. 
<p>Later in the evening, we all headed out to an S&M Leather shop 
in the South End. What else is there to do after a book fair? Now, I admit that I had never been to a Sex shop before, since 
I was raised in Purtain country, but I'm an open-minded guy of the 
twenty first century. What could be so bad about leather nun outfits
and studded dog collars?
<p>Aggressive sex shop salespeople.
<p>As my little group wandered though the store, we gandered at the inventory:
feathers, leather masks, butt plugs, anal starter kits (which naturally begs 
for the follow-up product: anal kit pro) and anatomically optimistic dildos. 
The problem came when three of us (again, all male) stopped in front of the 
selection of lubricants, all water based of course. There scented lubs, 
fruity lubs, course lubs and smooth lubs. Fine. Unfortunately just as I was 
ready to move on, one of the saleswomen can over and started <em>pushing 
the product</em>. From personal experience, she recommended one particular lub as being the most satisfying. 
<p>At that point, a couple of things came to mind.
<p>First, I'm used to sex selling cars, laundry detergent, hell, 
even life insurance, but sex being used to sell <em>sex</em> threw me. 
Perhaps new synapses are being creating in my brain as I write this.
<p>Second, I'm not used to sales people talking about their sex lives. Ok, I know she was probably just reciting the marketing material. I'm sure the 
lub ombudsman detailed the top three most effective sales pitches for 
the product, but it was still disquieting. It's one thing for a car salesman
to say 'Can you feel the suspension on this beauty? It's like riding on air".
It's another entirely to hear "Feel how slippery this is? I love it."
<p>Third, although I always take the free samples of chicken teriaki at 
Sakios in the Prudential Food Court, I wasn't prepared to have goo squirted in my hand. The only way to move product may be to get the customer involved, 
but this level of interactivity was unanticipated. But now, I think this shop is really missing some opportunities here. Why not organize lub parties along the lines of tupperware parties? I can see Sally StayAtHome inviting all her 
neighbors over to her house. An assortment of provocatively shaped tubes are 
arrayed on her low glass table. After passing around carrots and dip, she begins 
"I can't tell you how much these products mean to me. They saved my marriage."
<p>Although the lub incident caused the most psychic damage, the most 
fascinating items for sale were old dentistry tools. Strange shiny metal clamps, forceps and a metal gag that boasted improved comfort. Included 
in that case were items for which I, despite years of avid 
pornography watching and bachelorhood, was unable to divine a sexual use.
Apparently, there <em>are</em> more things in heaven and earth than are conceived of in my philosophy. Go figure. 
</p>

They actually *have* something along those lines, although with my memory and the length of time since I saw the news story I can't remember if there's a recruitment effort (say, hundreds of people doing it) or if it was the work of one lone courageous human outlined in the article.  I vaguely remember it being in California, and it was mostly about dildos.
<p>
Perhaps I'm batty.  Now I'm wondering if I really remember it at all...</p>
