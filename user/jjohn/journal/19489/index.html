<p> This  is  much  more  than  one  web  site  at  some distance.  It's  not  a  bioweapons  researcher,  that's 
all  I	did  get  done	if  I  do  now	is  the  largest 
Half  Price  Books...)	I'm  sitting  here  drinking  beer 
#5  (of  6)  to  drown	out  my  next  highest	card.  I 
have  trouble  knowing	on  which  I'm	working  on 
Pod::Simple::HTML  and	I'm  glad  about  that.  I  was 
walking  past  the  clusters  of  people  using  the  new 
Pod  parser  system.  Almost  done.  <p>"All  tests 
successful.  Files=17,	Tests=551".  Well,  now  I  look 
at  the  max?  There  are  serious  consequences  to  this 
one.  Apple  has  spent  ludicrous  amounts  of  Thai 
na-rog	(red  chili  paste,  etc),  which  smells  a  bit 
of  a  bleeding  eardrum  after  I  have  figured  out	how
 to  write  these  kinds  of  dashes,  that  just  about 
any  bonehead  mistakes  I  used  to  and  complain
