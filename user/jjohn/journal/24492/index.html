<div class="span8">
<p> <p>When catching wind of an article about pseudoscience, my eyes perk up
for <a href="http://pseudocertainty.com/">obvious reasons</a>.  In this 
case, ye olde slashdot is running <a href="http://science.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/05/02/1059247">a story</a> from 
<a href="http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2005/4/27/03541/2520">kuro5hun</a> 
about the argument for <a href="http://www.actionbioscience.org/evolution/nhmag.html">Intelligent Design</a>, the idea that terristrial organisms (and indeed 
the entire comso) evince too much complexity for them to have arisen through 
chance alone.  Therefore, some guiding intelligence must of been at work 
pushing life into increasingly complex forms.  Fans of Clarke's <em>2001</em>
will note the Monolith-like qualities of this argument. While God is 
specifically not mentioned in the Intelligent Design hypothesis 
(<a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=theory">theory</a> is an 
inappropriate word here), 
He is clearly implied by the proponents of this view.  Intelligent Design is 
an attempt by some Christians with a science background to take advantage of 
some unanswered questions in the scientific dogma of Natural Selection-driven 
Evolution.</p>  
<p>Obviously, today is a slow news day.</p>
<p>To understand what the hoo-haw is about, one need only dig out your high 
school English books and look for Lawrence and Lee's gripping courtroom drama
<em>Inherit the Wind</em>.  In it, a teacher is prosecuted for explaining 
evolution to hicks, I mean, the children of salt-of-the-earth Americans.  Of 
course, you'll remember that not so long ago, some states banned the teaching
of evolution in public schools (and <a href="http://www.infidels.org/activist/state/evolution.shtml">are doing so again</a>).  
At stake is the validity of science and 
its methods versus the comfort and security of faith.  Or more pointedly, it
is yet another front in the war of modernists versus fundamentalists 
(which can be incautiously reduced to those who embrace change and those who
fear it).</p>
<p>Intelligent Design, which sometimes ropes in Physics via the second law
of Thermodynamics, isn't really attempt to pursuade scientists to reject
Evolution.  ID isn't a scientific theory; it predicts nothing, nor does it 
offer testable evidence.  Rather, ID makes rhetorical appeals to the 
deficiency in the fossil record and the still-unobserved genesis of a new 
species from an existing one to wedge in a specious argument against 
Evolution.  Note that the argument, while wearing the vestments of Science, 
isn't scientific at all.  It offers no conditions under which it can be 
proven wrong.  This is preciously the characteristics of religious dogma or 
garden-variety piffle.</p>
<p>So if ID isn't aimed at Scientists, for whom is this argument intended?  
The only group that jumps to mind are defensive, educated Christians who
know enough biology to be uncomfortable with strict-constructionist religion
and yet insistent on believing that faith anyway.  This irony always strikes
me the same way <a href="http://www.jewsforjesus.org/">Jews for Jesus</a> does.
ID is a notional life vest for these individuals who are trapped in the rough 
waters between science and faith.  ID is neither a product of devoted faith 
(if you know there's a God, you simply don't need ID in the first place), nor 
good science (see preceeding paragraphs).  ID is a small, fevered argument of 
badly sutured science that attempts to scare its adherents away from looking 
into the swirling chaos that is the reality science proffers us.</p>
<p>So to those proponents of Intelligent Design, I implore you to pick a side:
faith or science.  By choosing faith, you abdicate your voice in scientific 
debates and inquiry for the certainty of Knowing the Truth and basking in 
unctuous Righeousnes.  By choosing science, you must adopt its methods and put 
your hypothesis up for independent verification.  Let me close with a little
sumthin-sumthin from the Bible:</p>
<blockquote>
So because thou art lukewarm, and neither hot nor cold,<br> 
I will spew thee out of my mouth.
<p>--Revelation 3:16</p>

</blockquote>
