<p> of  handlebars  and  pretending  to  be  lightweight enough	to  anyone  or	anything  else	you'll	ever  eat, 
and  even  <a
href="http://www.perldoc.com/perl5.8.0/pod/perlipc.html">Re
ad The Fine Manual</a>	but  there  are  a  lot  of  new 
stuff  that  the  author  soon.  Maybe	I'll  keep  that 
in  BASIC?  :)	Yet  some  people  don't  see  it,  but 
hey,  I  got  an  "Oops,  that	shouldn't  happen. 
<tt>up2date</tt>  should  ensure  that	anything  tied	is 
slow.  While  that  holds  true,  tied	interfaces  aren't 
always	the  way?  <P>	"I  know  that	the  right  to 
publish  it  for  me.  I  ended  up  doing.  <P>  Even 
then  I'm  just  being	left  in  it,  too.  <P>  I've 
been  contemplating  wussing  out  and	in  a  limited 
number	of  them,  which  I  know  what  map  does. 
<p>Mark's  final  solution  to	many  more!<P> 
<I>--Nat</I>  Dear  Log,  <p>Wow,  Michel  wrote  a 
hilarious  dinner  with  them,	possibly  never  see  this 
patronage  model  grow	and  spread.  (Major  kudos  to 
Ticketmaster  for  hiring  another  Perl  template  module,
 especially  considering  that	I'm  completely 
underequiped,  not  having  anything  to  show	this  to 
the  world.</p>  <p>...  or  at  least	in  regard  to 
lib/Unicode/.  My  perl/  had  no  chance  of  that  come 
from  Wally-World  for	around	US$4.  <P>  It	also 
occurred  to  me  in  his!  If	you  ever  seen  and  at 
work,  plus  meetings,	plus  cleaning	out  the  solution 
is  this  yet  another	case  of  TMTOWTDI.  Dear  Log, 
<p>I'm	quite  surprised  to  find  a  program	with  a 
keynote  by  <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/">Paul
Graham</a>,  who  was  both  disarming	and  enjoyable. 
<p>On  the  radio  today  I  wrote  a  tiny  bit  more 
often.

<h2>TODO</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jjohn/">jjohn</a> on 2003-09-12T12:41:47</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Capitalize first word of sentence</li>
  <li>Remove "Dear Log" and "--Nat" phrases
      (which are too jarring out of context).</li>
  <li>See if I'm adding spaces in weird places in the middle of hrefs.</li>
</ul>
