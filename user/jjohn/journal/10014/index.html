<h1>Farscape's new ratings still weak</h1>

<div class="span8">
<p><p>From <a href="http://www.watchfarscape.com/news/article.php?newsid=218">SaveFarscape</A>:

<pre>
Courtesy of a reliable source, we have the
national ratings in for last week's Friday night
lineup on The Sci-Fi Channel. 

8PM Farscape 1.34 (ep. "Kansas")
9PM Stargate 1.75
10PM Tracker 1.45
11PM Stargate 0.89
12PM Farscape 0.78
1AM X-Files 0.60 
</pre>

<p>Sadly, Farscape isn't even pulling in the numbers that Traker or Stargate do, even with the 
huge fan-based advertisement and the remarkable cliffhanger (from 4 months ago) called "Unrealized Realities." It's sad to see Farscape end with a whimper, not a bang. In its prime, it was quite a show. 
<p><b>UPDATE:</b> <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/zorknapp/journal">Zorknapp</a> suggests I'm being a little hard on the ol' Farscape. The four month hiatus and knowing that these are the last eps has perhaps darkened my impression of the show. Certainly, I don't want to invest a lot of emotion into the plot knowing it won't get resolved. Last night's <em>Terra Firma</em> was a very moving character sketch. Not enough Rigel or Pilot for my tastes, but there we are. It does appear that John will have to stop running from his pain and confront Aeryn before The End. Let's hope. </p>

<h2>Ratings not a surprise, unfortunately...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/zorknapp/">zorknapp</a> on 2003-01-16T16:37:26</h3>
This is what happens when a network decides to stop supporting a show.  Yes, there was a cliffhanger a few months ago, but unless you happen to catch an ad for Farscape on Sci-Fi, you wouldn't realize the show was back on the air.
<p>
It also doesn't help that the network changed the time of broadcast, to 8pm.  I happened to catch the episode almost by chance, as I thought it would be on at 9pm.
</p><p>
Bastards.</p>



<h2>Friday not always convienient</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/runrig/">runrig</a> on 2003-01-16T18:20:23</h3>
I'm lucky if I'm home at 8pm Friday night. They ought to run it a couple of times a week. (They could replace 'Crossing Over' as far as I'm concerned, but then I bet that's probably their highest rated show). And what kind of ratings do they expect at midnight? Nothing gets ratings after midnight, except Letterman and Leno.



<h2>Episode sucked</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/gizmo_mathboy/">gizmo_mathboy</a> on 2003-01-16T19:00:48</h3>
Am I the only one thinking that the episode (Kansas) kind of sucked?<br> <br>The cliffhanger was kind of cool but the followup (and judging by the commercials for this week's episode) just let me flat. I nearly flipped to something else. Then again, this whole season has left me flat. Lots of potential but it was all wasted.



<h2>SciFi--</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Fletch/">Fletch</a> on 2003-01-17T04:04:22</h3>
<p>
Not that I have SciFi any more ((AT&amp;T cable)--, but that's another story).  When I was out at my parents' house over the holidays I tried to catch some of the marathon they had, but SciFi went off the air (just that one channel, everything else was fine).  Grrrrr.
</p>
<p>
But then Fox is promoting <i>Fastlane</i> that took <i>Firefly</i>'s timeslot hyping the <i>Saved By The Bell</i> chick kissing another female (not that there's anything wrong with that&lt;/Seinfeld&gt;; ObSimpsons reference to the Fox turned into a hardcore pornography channel bit), but it doesn't bode well for intellegent, well written SF on TV (or intellegent TV at all).  Makes me wonder more and more just what I'm bothering getting <a href="http://mythtv.org/" title="mythtv.org">mythtv</a mythtv.org> working to record (aside from <i>The Simpsons</i>, <i>Futurama</i>, and <i>The Shield</i>).
