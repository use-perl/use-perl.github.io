<p><p>As <a href="http://www.scifi.com">SCI-FI</a> on hiatus until March, 2002, fellow 'scapers are will have to make do with fan sites. One of the them, Farscape Weekly is running this article, <a href="http://www.farscapeweekly.com/article1139.html">Is Farscape clich&egrave;d?</a> It lists and catagorizes some of the more brain-damaged plot devices inflicted on sci-fi fans. It's a fun read, although I believe there are some additional examples of Farscape going to the clich&egrave; well. Still, Farscape shines when it <i>uses</i> traditional sci-fi elements in unexpected ways. I submit that <a href="http://www.scifi.com/farscape/journeylogs/season3/eatme.html">Eat Me</a>, <a href="http://www.scifi.com/farscape/journeylogs/dog.html">Beware of Dog</a> and <a href="http://www.scifi.com/farscape/journeylogs/fooled.html">Won't Get Fooled Again</a> all fall into this catagory. What do you think?</p>

<h2>Farscape</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/TorgoX/">TorgoX</a> on 2002-01-24T03:58:07</h3>
I'm into <em>Farscape</em> for the clone sex!



<h2>Personal Taste</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/chaoticset/">chaoticset</a> on 2002-01-24T06:30:46</h3>
I also considered _Out Of Their Minds_ to provide a more interesting take on normal "bodyswap" plotlines.  Instead of predictable goofiness or melodrama, you got mental-overload-seizures, perversion, and the first time I've ever seen a male make a pass at another male on a regular cable channel.
<p>
I was impressed.
</p><p>
The other thing with _Farscape_ has been that I find it surprising me, and I miss being surprised by TV.  _Different Destinations_ surprised me, and it's still one of my favorite eps of all time because it was well executed.</p>



<h2>Whatever happened to...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/djberg96/">djberg96</a> on 2002-01-24T22:04:46</h3>
...Brimstone?  I thought that was a cool concept.  They gave it a crappy time slot and it died.

Brimstone was one of the unlucky ones, yes.  Also excellent stuff.  Peter Horton did a Scifi chat and claimed that if they could get funding from Scifi, they were going to shoot new eps of it.  (You knew that it was shot/shown on some actual network, and Scifi just bought the eps, right?)
<p>
One thing that made it stand out was the look.  If I remember correctly, there was something they did during film processing to produce the almost-everything-gray effect.</p>

Oh, damn - I forgot that this came from the USA Network until you mentioned that.
<p>
It was really a cool show with lots of potential, given some good writing.  Sorta reminded me of the Comic Book "Constantine", and a lot more well done than "Buffy".</p>

<h2>Farscape</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/TorgoX/">TorgoX</a> on 2002-01-24T23:13:31</h3>
Hm, it occurs to me that "is it clich&eacute;?" is a particularly silly form-over-content question, of the sort that it usually takes someone as low on the evolutionary scale as a typical US high school English teacher to ask.

<p>Better question:  Is <i>Farscape</i> well-written?  I say that it sure is, in many ways.

</p><p>I like <i>Farscape</i> because the writers never pass up an opportunity to make their own lives hard.
</p><p>The characters fight, they fuck, they swear, they shoot people, they shoot eachother, they get shot, they shoot themselves, they freak out, they lie, they <em>die</em>, they come back from the dead, they get high, they get roaring drunk, they wake up half naked and don't remember how they got there.  They're certainly not <a href="http://www.startrek.com/" title="startrek.com">just earnest case-workers in lycra suits.</a startrek.com>
<br>And one of them even farts helium!


</p><p>My favorite bit of dialog, from the episode "Eat Me": "All I need is more... what?  Food? Family?  Is there a difference?"

</p><p>It's also achingly well acted, which is something I say about very few things these days.</p>
