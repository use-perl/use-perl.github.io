Well, in good ol' Indiana it's still that same timezone it always was (GMT - 5 or is that UTC -5?)<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

That may be but in God's own Massachusetts, I get an extra hour of shuteye. And that has made all the difference.

<p> <i>I never realized I had an emotional reaction to EST.</i>
</p><p>Neither did I until <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/pudge/journal/8530" title="perl.org">I READ YOUR JOURNAL</a perl.org>. Now before you get pedantic on my ass, your complaint in the journal was about daylight savings time. What I like about DST is that when it ends, I get an extra hour of sleep. This is a beautiful thing to me. You might argue that its better never to play with the clock at all. The perceived benefit of the EDT-EST changeover is not unlike getting a tax refund from the government. It so feels good at the time, but it's the government that really really makes out, in that it gets a zero-interest loan for a few months.

</p><p>To clarify, it's the extra hour of sleep that accompanies the EDT-EST switch that I'm waxing about.</p>

</p><p>I was reviewing my info just now -- looking at my recent comments and I had totally forgotten about this interchange! I think we ought to change the topic to EMPIRIAL TIE-FIGHTER VERUS B5 STARFURY: WHO WILL BEAT THE OTHER SENSELESS?
</p><p>You see? This is why I turned off comment messaging. I found that it provoked me to respond to things I would normally just forget about.</p>
