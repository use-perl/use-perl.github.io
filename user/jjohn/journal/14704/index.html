<ECODE>* v1.11, May 22, 2003  Add super-cool feature for
calling event methods on object  specifier record objects
(like $track->play). See  "Shortcuts for object specifier
records" in the docs for  more information.  Updated some
of the examples to use this new feature.  Read-only flag in
PODs was reversed. It is recommended to re-create  all your
glues, or just realize that "read-only" means it is
writable,  and no note means it is read-only, in your old
docs. Or change them  all by hand.  Fix minor paths bug in
call to Mac::Path::Util. Require  more recent version of
said module.  Added t/pod.t. </ECODE>  <EM>Posted  using
