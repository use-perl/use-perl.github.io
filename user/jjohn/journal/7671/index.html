<p><p>Farscape will not go gentle into that good night. Hundreds of people are logging into #farscape on irc.scifi.com (the record number of users I saw in the room last night was 610). Thousands of fans have contacted SCIFI to make their displeasure heard. Letters, faxes and email are beginning to make SCIFI realize that they may have pulled the plug too soon. This is the <em>critical</em> week  to show your support for the show. If you have some time today, drop by <a href="http://www.savefarscape.com/">SaveFarscape</a> to find out how you can make a difference.
<p>Don't let the terrorists win. </p>

<h2>Family Affair</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/pudge/">pudge</a> on 2002-09-11T12:14:21</h3>
Me, wife, and child sent our email support for the show!<br> <br>This whole thing is really odd to me.  Better than 90% of the people I know who watch Sci-Fi channel watch Farscape.  Yet Sci-Fi says that the show hasn't gotten past its core audience, into the mainstream.  Hello?  This is the Nerd Channel.  Nothing about your channel will ever be mainstream.  The best you can hope is to get most of the nerds, and by my experience, Farscape does a good job in that demographic.<br> <br>I have a suspicion that Nerds are not properly represented in the Nielsen ratings.<br>



<h2>My letters</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jjohn/">jjohn</a> on 2002-09-11T15:04:42</h3>
I have sent an email to program@www.scifi.com and I have send an online petition. Additionally, I'm sending this letter to three people at SCIFI.

<blockquote><div>
<p>Dear [INSERT NAME],

</p><p>I was much dismayed to hear that the SCIFI Channel has decided not
to pick up Farscape's fifth season. SCIFI is only one of six channels
that I watch regularly and Farscape was the primary reason I tuned into
that channel. As you know, Farscape has been lauded by critics and fans.
It has won several awards and it has performed very well for SCIFI.

</p><p>Farscape is a classic Space Opera. It has story arcs that span several
episodes and even different seasons. In order for new viewers to
get into the show, it is imperative that SCIFI show reruns of Farscape.
Last year, after I had gotten into the show (because of reruns), I
told several friends about Farscape. Unfortunately, this was shortly
before the first the four month hiatus of 2002. Because I believed
in the quality of the show so much, I bought my friend a couple of
the DVDs.

</p><p>He and his girlfriend became hooked on Farscape and eagarly awaited
new episodes.

</p><p>I'm an unofficial and unpaid salesperson for SCIFI. Help me to help
you sell Farscape to a wider audience by showing reruns and funding
a fifth season of this truly marvelous show. This short term investment
will have long term benefits for SCIFI, as new fans discover the magic
of Farscape.

</p><p>Thank you for your consideration.</p>
