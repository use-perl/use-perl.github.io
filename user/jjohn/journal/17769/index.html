<p><p>I must be scrapping the bottom of the barrel, but here's a <a href="http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=99417&cid=8475750">comment</a> 
from a <em>slashdot poll</em> that I found worth repeating.
<blockquote>
&laquo;<br>&deg;&nbsp;If you woke this morning with more health than illness you are luckier than the MILLION who won't survive this week!<br>
&deg;&nbsp;If you have never experienced the danger of battle, the loneliness of imprisonment, the agony of torture or the pangs of starvation, you are luckier than 20 million people around the word!<br>
&deg;&nbsp;If you have food in your refrigerator, cloths on your back, a roof over your head and a place to sleep, you are richer than 75% of this world!<br>
&deg;&nbsp;If you have money in the bank, in your wallet and spare change in a dish someplace, you are among the top 8% of the world's wealthy!<br>
&deg;&nbsp;If your parents are still married and alive, you are very rare, especially in the U.S.!<br>
&deg;&nbsp;If you can read this message, you are luckier than over TWO BILLION people in the world that cannot read anything at all!<br>
&deg;&nbsp;You are blessed in ways that you may never know.<br>&raquo;
</blockquote>
<p>While I can't vouch for the last bit, the rest seems true and so 
therefore I BELIEVE IT.  For the next post, I will be quoting from 
inspirational Hallmark greeting cards that have changed my life.
