<p>It seems that this year folks are less tolerant of April Fools pranks. There's caterwalling aplenty at ye ol' slashdot and on the Boston PM. Now more than ever, a finely tuned sense of humor is not just a luxery, but a requirement. </p>

<p>back the net and get back to the good old days when fuckwits were few and people had fun with the april fools jokes, sometimes even spending a year planning them. You missed all the yankees, who forget that all 24 timezones aren't packed into the US of A,  whining about how it was ahead of schedule....they're probably just all the assholes who got duped and now want to whine to save face<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) Have I mentioned, lately, how fabulous it is to be an expat jj? There is still time for you to flee to Canada.</p>

<p>I like the MSA joke, but in general, I've felt like some of the items the past few years haven't been as good as the classics I hear about from before my time.  I wish someone would take a year to plan something really good.</p>

<p>I didn't say it was brilliant but someone has to keep the tradition alive in hopes that the good ones will come back in style when we have more time for such things.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<p>Maybe the Perl foundation can sponsor somebody to work on this full time in the coming year?</p>
