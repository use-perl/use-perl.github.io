<p><p>As I kid my favorite dreams involved me flying. My dream self would arise from my bed, fly out the window (or through the wall), and follow the contours of the land, sort of like the game Descent. For whatever Freudian reason, these kinds of dreams filled me with a euphoria that lingered even after waking up. As I got older, those dreams became less frequent and less potent.
<p>Some people dream in color, I'm told. Some have 'lucid dreams'. The weirdest dream experience I've had up to now was a very frustrating dream in which I was debugging a perl program (an admission that is likely to block  congressional approval of my eventual Supreme Court nomination, I'm sure). Last night, however, I believe I've had yet another first in my dream life: I clearly saw the word <b>gaination</b>. I don't know the definition of the word, nor can I relate sufficiently the context of the dream (I was in a university/mall with my extended family and my aunt died [she yet lives in real life]. I know we were living my first home because of the kitchen). Aside from Perl code, I can't recall a dream in which a word was so clearly presented.

<p>Since I have no definition for this word and it sort of looks real, I invite the use.perl.org community to invent of definition for it. <p>Excelsior!

<p>This word is only allowed in PowerPoint presentations to CEOs and CFOs of Fortune 500 companies. It kinda means profit, except not the profits for the company but rather the money that executives can make through side deals, plus the amount that can show up in the books for a while, before the actual figures eventually surface.</p>

<p>Example: "Sir, I think we should buy Lame Unlimited for twice the price they are asking. It will eventually cost the share holders about $500M, plus most of the employees their pension, but the gainationn could be in the tens of millions for us, provided we change it's name to GeeWizzcom and IPO it right away"*</p>

<p>I suppose use.perl readers can use G7N if they really have to refer to this word.</p>

No doubt that's why you're writing about Lucent dreams rather than lucid ones.  Better than Enron dreams, I guess.

The right-wingers aren't the only ones envisioning a single united global state.  The liberals' utopia a world without tariffs or embargos, where everyone earns a fair wage (in a stable global currency) producing environment-friendly goods for sale on a global market; where child labor and all other unacceptable practices are effectively squashed through legitimately empowered global watchdog commissions.  In this world to come, everyone is free to practice their religion of choice without fear of repression... but of course, in that enlightened day, everyone will realize that no extra-dimensional Jurist is as deserving of our worship as our beloved earth-mother, Gaia.<br>
