<p> This morning I installed Perl 5.8.0 and CPAN modules onbarista (the albook). That took forever. I also did an
impression of Damian's accent because, well, he can't be
the only one that couldn't get the submission form for the
OSCon CFP to work? I tried several times Friday and on the
week-end, and all I get back is some Netbeans page, which
<B>definitely</B> was not the case before. Netbeans appears
to be some sort of blockage. To get the VCD out I had to
reproduce the bug, and I had to port it, because we were
using the interface wrong. Ok, but then the Bioinformatics
stuff popped into my head and I talked about that for a few
hours in front of the selection of lubricants, all water
based of course. There scented lubs, fruity lubs, course
lubs and smooth lubs. Fine. Unfortunately just as I was

journal. I was going to post something early last week
about the hectic socialising with <a
href="http://london.pm.org">london.pm</a> over the previous
weekend, but I forgot on Monday and I invite everyone in

the theists who are usually seen as as slightly strange. A

with clarinets instead of big brass. As I'm scouring
comp.unix.solaris for tips, tricks and code snippets, I'm
realizing a few things. It seems that the values reported
for memory and cpu usage are not (necessarily) accurate or
simply use a calculation you wouldn't expect. You can look
at "top -n 1" vs "swap -s" to see one example of what the
HOWTO's talk about at <a

uses actions, outlets, and menu items. My iBook has cramped
space, I wanted something even smaller than minimized
iTunes, so there it is. I'll share the source in a bit, I'm
having routing issues that make uploading a PITA. I love
the power of a good IDE/GUI builder combined with the CPAN.
And it's pronounced minItunes. :-)  Cornel West Overdrive
Dear Log,<blockquote>&laquo;And so every puff piece about
the film [Matrix Reloaded] has emphasized that its
creators, the siblings Andy and Larry Wachowski, do not
give interviews -- as if behaving like Thomas Pynchon would
give their movie the gravitas of "Gravity's Rainbow." To
second the motion, along came <a
href="http://orion.csuchico.edu/Archives/Volume36/Issue4/Ph
otos/Cornel2=n-c.html ">Cornel West,</a> the Princeton
professor who has a cameo in "The Matrix Reloaded" and is
not at all shy about meeting the press. He told Time (for
its cover story) that "the brothers are very into epic
poetry and philosophy, into Schopenhauer and William James"
and that "Larry Wachowski knows more about Hermann Hesse
than most German scholars." This does not explain why the
movie's multicultural orgy scene looks like a Club Med luau
run amok, but maybe the inspiration for that was Kahlil
Gibran.&raquo;<p >--<a

I went and saw <I>Die Another Day</I>. It's pretty good -
probably the best of the Bond films actually. Cool intro,
lots of action, classic Bond plot. "Hit and Run" Berry and
the woman who played Ms. Frost are both hot, of course, but
I think ol' Mr. Brosnan should probably hang up his Bond
hat before the on-screen love scenes start to get gross.
<P> In other news, Mandrake 9 seems to hit kernel panic
about 50% of the time when I boot. I think it's the
firewire port on my video card it can't handle, but like I
said it only does this sometimes.  Text::Autoformat <p>I
just discovered Text::Autoformat for the first time. (I
think; I've looked at and forgotten far too many things.)
This is apparently an advanced form of artificial
intelligence!</p> <pre>  I just wonder if it will handle
my usual typing style. When I type plain text, I start all
paragraphs with two spaces. Most formatters in editors take
that to mean the next line should be indented two spaces. 
Haven't read that far in the docs yet, though.</pre>

PALPITATIONS, SWEATING AND/OR INTERNAL BLEEDING. CONSULT
YOUR PHYSICIAN, IF UNSURE.</b> <P>There are lots of things
I don't like about America's new war on terrorism. You can
start that catalog of distasteful things with the actual
9/11 attack. That sucked. Then the media coverage. What was
more painful: watching the planes crash into the WTC towers
or listening to weeping talking heads? As bad as those
were, there is one thing that really sticks in my craw: the
narrowing of public debate on this issue. <P>There are
several reasons why bombing the holy hell of Kabul might
prevent future attacks. There are several reasons why the
violent US response will promote more terrorism. Where is
the debate on this? Why is the media rallying around George
W.? It's not like he was suddenly elected by majority of
Americans. He's still a few eggs short of a dozen and his
speech writers still getting their material from Julia
Roberts films (or asprin commercials, I can't tell the
difference). <P>Part of this narrowing of public discourse
manifests in looking the other way while petty merchants
sell American flag junk. We've all seen this crap by now:
pens sporting flags with "United We Stand", Asian
restaurant flyer's with a prominent Old Glory, news casters
with blue (and optionally red and white) ribbons, and
gas-chugging SUV's flying tatter flags. The list goes on.
Does this sudden display of patriotism (which now seems to
be fadding) seem superficial and devoid of meaning? Of
course it does. But, I don't really have a lot of spleen
for these media-controlled sheep that can't see through
this diversion. Instead, I direct my wrath towards that
lowest layer of social scum that <em>markets</em> chinsy
flag crap toward those confused and battered sheep.
<P>Before I get too many of those heart-felt, but misplaced
"Buddy, my daddy died for the flag" emails, remember that
American freedom is the right to have opinions that wrankle
the majority. Let's not confuse freedom with a flag. One is
an ideal and the other is often made of a generic polymer.
The former is far more important than the later.
<P>Whatever freedoms we enjoy in this country should be
excersized with a modicum of taste. If you jumped into the
flag business, or as I call it the petty jingoist trade,
after September 11, you're a craven scumbag. You are not
helping America heal; you are just another money-sucking
leech feeding at the fatted calf of the American wallet.
<P>Symbolism is not action. We most certainly need real
action now and a long-term plan for the future. <P>Oh, a
flag-etiquette tip for those new flag owners: take your
flags down at sunset or during foul weather. Check out <a

Publishing other people's work? <I>Short Version</I>:<P>
Some who wrote a pretty good module is too scared to
publish. Should I publish for him? <P> <I>Long
Version</I>:<P> A few entries ago, I mentioned that I was
working on a C extension for Ruby for the 'df' command. I
posted an initial bit of code out in comp.lang.ruby, and a
guy named Mike Hall jumped in and eventually came up with a
working solution fairly quickly (and it was a different
approach than what I had taken, so it was a different
design as well). <P> We exchanged a few emails, I was a
guinea pig for Solaris testing, and he did the Linux
testing. Soon, he had version .30, a version I definitely
considered ready for release (it needs work to support BSD
and Windows, but that can be added later). However, here's
where the dilemma began. <P> I asked him to publish it to
the <A href=http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/raa.html">Ruby
Application Archive</A>, to which he responded something
like, "ooh...scary". I took that to mean he was too nervous
about publishing his work. It's still not out on the
archive. <P> I can understand a bit of apprehension about
putting your work out there for all to see. I mean, most of
us probably felt that in the moments before we uploaded our
first module to CPAN. You want the module to be *perfect*,
and you dread that some idiot is gonna email you with a
line like, "What is this piece of junk you dared to post to
the Archive? Who do you think you are? Come back when
you've reached Guru status". Of course, that doesn't
happen, and people are generally very polite about pointing
out bugs or asking for enhancements. <P> However, I have
already sent Mike reasons for uploading his module to the
archive - it's useful, others (besides myself) have
requested it in the newsgroup and it works just fine. It's
a handy sys-admin toy. Not everyone is going to come out
and ask for it in the newsgroup, but if they see it's
available, there's a good chance they'll download it. The
alternative is to troll around comp.lang.ruby and send an
email every time someone *does* ask for it. And what
happens if, God forbid, something should happen to you
Mike? That work, and any work he may be doing on it now,
will be lost. <P> So, here is my dilemma. If I can't
convince him to upload it to the archive, should I upload
it to the archive myself? Obviously, he would be listed as
the author, so it's not a question of taking credit (though
I'd like to think I was a contributor at least). I'm
inclined to say no and keep trying to convince him for a
while, but I thought I'd see what others thought. <P> Any
ideas on how I can calm his fears and get him to publish? I
haven't heard back from him after I sent an email
encouraging him to publish. What happens if I never
convince him? <P> Opinions welcome. <P> <B>UPDATE
2-May-2002</B> - Looks like he posted it today. Hooray! 
Friday Trivia #9 Yep - early again. I'm gone tomorrow and
Friday for the 4th and I won't have access to a computer
until Monday. This one is probably too easy, since I forgot
to think one up until today. Anyway, on to the question...
<P> For 50 Trivia points, from what television show does
the following quote come?: <P> <I>He's mad! He's madder
than Mad Jack McMad, the winner of last year's Mr. Madman
competition.</I> <P> For 25 bonus points, name the episode
as well. <P> No Google. Answer posted Monday. <P> <B>UPDATE
Wednesday, 3:49pm CST</B> - We have a winner! pdcawley wins
50 Trivia Points. Bonus question still open. <P> <B>UPDATE
Sunday, 3:17pm CST</B> - Vek wins the bonus points!  Mac
vs. Windows I just gotta say that Matthias Neeracher is way
cool. <A
HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/gusi/">GUSI</A> is
cool. MacPerl supports a lot of POSIX calls very well
without much or any additional code, which is just great.
Win32 seems to have worse POSIX support underneath, despite
being a more POSIX-ish OS. GUSI is the difference: it is a
very good POSIX library for Mac OS. MacPerl, and the perl
test suite, are a great GUSI test suite. We've found a lot
of little GUSI bugs as MacPerl has moved forward. Each
project makes the other better. :-)  Perl 6 by Damian,
again I'm really starting to like Perl 6. And I know that
it's being done right because the audience consitantly
asked questions that were covered in one of the next two
slides. That's amazingly wonderful. Damian might not have
thought so, though, as he seemed to be nothing more than
the slide changer in the presentation. ;-)  It's
Cyrillicious! Dear Log, <p><a

f">Ukrainian!</a>  subscribe perl5-porters I just
subscribed to the Perl5 Porters list. I might actually have
some source code to contribute to the next release of Perl!
<P> The whole issue came up when I realized, much to my
dismay, that Ruby did not support kill on Win32. Because I
need it for a project I'm working on, I decided to write my
own. For that I started by scouring the various Win32
programming newsgroups and looking at the Perl source. <P>
I quickly realized that all Perl does is call
TerminateProcess(), which is analogous to a "kill -9" in
Unix. It'll work, but it's not nice. I downloaded bleadperl
and noticed that someone did add this bit of code: <ECODE>
if (PostThreadMessage(IsWin95() ? pid :
-pid,WM_USER,sig,0)) {	/* It might be us ... */ 
PERL_ASYNC_CHECK();  return 0; } </ECODE> The problem with
this code is that it uses the PID as a thread ID. AFAICT
this code will never work, not only based on what I've read
(I don't think a process' PID has anything to do with a
thread ID), but some pure-C experimentation. At least, it
never works for me. I tried a few variations to make sure.
<P> So, at some point this week I'm going to submit my own
approach to using kill on Win32 systems. And by "my own", I
mean one I shamelessly plagiarized off the web, but which
seems to work pretty well based on both experimentation and
what I've read off of msdn.com.  Apache::MP3 Dear Log,
<p>Whee! I mailed off to Lincoln Stein the newly
internationalized Apache::MP3, with a few major dozen
languages localized for it. I was satisfied that I'd made
all the necessary changes to the core modules to handle all
languages; the right-to-left languages certainly <a
href="http://members.spinn.net/user/sburke/a3shots/a3yi-hebr.gi
f">took some doing</a>, but it's pretty much working fine
now. <p>The larger Apache::MP3 multilingual localization
project isn't "done" tho -- I'm still chasing a more
languages; I just don't think that the core modules will
have to be modified to accomodate whatever new ones I get
done in the future.<p>Now to see what subclasses break... 
Predictions <ul> <li>Before March 31st, 2002, the East
Coast of the US will be innundated with 2+ feet of snow,
following 7-10 days of subfreezing temperatures. It will
melt within 5 days, once the temperature rises to overnight
lows of 40F (+5C).</li> <li>The index of leading economic
indicators will show that a slight upward tick on christmas
spending towards the end of the month, linked to reduced
cost for home heating on the east coast.</li> <li>Another
upward tick on the index of leading economic indicators
will be attributed to the increased amount of time spent on
construction projects that can continue to lay concrete and
employ full staffs, since the temperatures unseasonably
mild.</li> <li>No correlation will be found between tech
book sales and the index of leading economic
indicators.</li> <li>Before the end of the year, Tom Ridge
will put the country on Double Secret Super Ultra High
Alert, allegedly due to nonspecific, but credible
threats.</li> <li>20/20, Dateline, 60 Minutes or Good
Morning America will shortly be broadcasting a segment
touring one of the caves in Afganistan the President so
affectionately calls a "hidey-hole".</li> <li>Slashdot will
confirm the first loss of life attributed to the really
lousy writing on <i>Star Trek: Enterprise</i>.</li> </ul>

you could do if you had a double major in Music and
Electrical Engineering. </p><p>Posted from <a

Something seems to have gone awry . . . or is this the intended behavior?<br>Perhaps a new and more subtle joke.<br>

The blog was too long, although there are some wonderful bits of nonsense in it.  Also the disclaimer footer dropped off.  I do keep certain chunks of text together like hyperlinks and  blockquotes.  Time for a little debugging.



<h2>Awesome bug</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jjohn/">jjohn</a> on 2003-09-08T12:05:51</h3>
Yes, there was a bug in the "indexing" part of markov.pl.  As I mentioned, I try to keep <b>thingies</b> like hyperlinks and whatnot together.  To do this, I have two sets of regexs: one that discribes the beginning, one that describes the end.  These regexs are compiled and kept in an array. When I was walking thru the code, I noticed that I never looked for the ending pattern (array index problem). D'oh.
