<div class="span8">
<p><p>Sometime after the Y2K Apocalypse, I found myself in a Best Buy store just happy to have survived it all. As I browsed through the CD collection, I found an unlikely title from an unlikely publisher. <A href="http://www.pcworld.com/">PC World</a> put out a collection of spirited classical tunes called 'THE Y2K ALBUM: a doomsday collection for the coming crash.' Of course, I immediately bought it. 
<p>Now, more than a year or so later, I decided to rip and encode this CD for my MP3 server, but I was fearful that CDDB wouldn't have an entry for this admittedly unpopular and quirkly title. My fear dissapated as soon as Grip correctly reported all the tracks on the CD. 
<p>So I'm NOT the only one who bought this! Who'd a thunk it?</p>

<h2>CDDB is amazingly complete</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/hfb/">hfb</a> on 2002-10-18T13:45:24</h3>
<p>It gets all of the random UK and Finnish CDs along with the US titles. One thing I have noticed you should watch for is that sometimes CDDB will get the album and the artist right but if you have a slight variant or special release edition it will get the tracks wrong. Other than the occasional spelling error it really is quite impressive.</p>

<h2>CDDB spelling errors</h2>

I was a little distressed to find that CDDB thought my Screamin' Jay Hawkins album was by Screamin' Jaw Hawkins and contained a song called "Yellow Cat" (actually "Yellow Coat").  I haven't checked to see if my corrections made it in.<br> <br>Damn!  I was going to include a link to the Jay's Kids site, but that seems to have gone away and had its domain snatched by<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... an executive search company (sure, that makes sense).  But <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20020124023831/http://www.jayskids.com/" title="archive.org">here it is</a archive.org> in the Wayback Machine.

<h2>Duplicates</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/pudge/">pudge</a> on 2002-10-22T20:46:21</h3>
Every once in awhile, CDDB will have duplicates.  I have two CDs with the same CDDB id (one of them is King's X, Gretchen Goes to Nebraska, I think; I forget the other, but it is a completely different CD).  Kinda freaky!
