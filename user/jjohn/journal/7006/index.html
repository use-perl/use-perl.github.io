<h1>Review of _The Stochastic Man_</h1>

<div class="span8">
<p><p>I recently read a somewhat forgotten book from noted sci-fi/fantasy
author Robert Silverberg called <i>The Stochastic Man</i>. The plot
is simple and familiar enough: a hero uses advanced probablistic math
to predict the future for fun and profit (pun intended) and is
shaken to encounter a genuine seer. The protagonist, Lew Nichols,
is a well compensated trends advisor in New York City at the end
of the twentith century. He becomes involved with a small town
politian, Paul Quinn, whom Nichols helps to get elected Governor.
Nichols enjoys the power and the good life of being a player in an
increasingly dystopic NYC (factional terrorism is the norm, various
borroughs are written off as being ungovernable). Everything in
Nichol's life is great until Martin Carvajal, a generous financial
backer of the Quinn election effort, insists on a face to face
meeting with Nichols. Where Nichols uses technology to forecast
liekly future events, Carvajal claims to be able to see the future
without error. The reader follows Nichols into ruinous obsession
and madness as he tries to learn the secrets of true sight.
Predictably, Nichols learns that uncertainty of the future isn't
entirely a bad thing.

<p>Written in 1975, <i>The Stochcastic Man</i> paints an amusing
picture of America at the end of the century. Silverberg merely
extrapolated the culture of the seventies, prevasive sex, drugs
and violence, to present a future world that looks somewhat like
what we have now. While Silverberg's vision isn't entirely accurate,
his description of New York terrorism is eerily prescient.

<p>Silverberg explores the well-worn sci-fi plot device of
science-enabled prognostication, not unlike the way Azimov did
the Foundation series. Silverberg's novel posits a world in which
the future is immutable, like some Calvinist nightmare. What's
interesting is that the immutability of future isn't fully tested
by the protagonist. Instead, Nichols and Carvajal become puppets
of their visions. It is clear that some of the predicted events
that the characters see are beyond their capability to change,
but other predictions are very easily avoided. It would be been
interesting to see Nichols act more defiantly against the
glimsed future. As the X-Files movie suggested, Fight the Future.

<p>Silverberg's writing style is crisp and engaging. Like many
authors of that time, Silverberg pushs the boundaries of English
grammar at times. Some of these experiments work, others don't.
In particular, he has an annoying habit of repeating the same
word in a series for emphasis. This got irratating quickly.
Also there were a few typos in my edition. Bummer. I
wish Silverberg had delivered more on the apocalyptic
vision of the 2004 Quinn administration. I felt a little cheated
by the way Silverberg chose to resolve this problem. Nichols
gets off a little too easily, I think.

<p>If you come across <i>The Stochastic Man</i>, I believe you
will enjoy reading it. It's a fun summer ride.</p>

<h2>Subjective opinion on this book</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/rafael/">rafael</a> on 2002-08-09T21:17:09</h3>
I've read this books years ago. I found it disturbing. A few months after I fishished it, I decided that I didn't like it : it could have been a lot better. But it's nevertheless one of the best novels by Silverberg I've read. (His short stories are often of higher quality.)
