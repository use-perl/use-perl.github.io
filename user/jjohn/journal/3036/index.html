<p><p>...the booze is gone.
<p>I went on an unexpected tear Wednesday with a buddy going through grrl trouble. As with all good drunks, I was able to pace myself until the last port of call: a bar and pool room called The Rack. You know what? Almost the entire staff of The Rack consisted of hansomely endowed women in inadequate clothing. Color me surprised!
<p>The Gentle Reader is reminded that I don't go out "clubbing." I don't "live for the weekend." The kinds of bars I go to have adults in them who drink IPAs and Stouts. But, this adventure wasn't about me. I ended up in a variety of places, buying drinks for strange women (at the behest of my lovelorn friend) and knocking down the canonical wedding cocktail: Dewers on the rocks. For some reason, none of the twenty-something "ladies" wanted to take home two blasted thirty-somethings. Was my comb-over showing? I had on my best thin leather tie. Am I missing something here?
<p>Thursday was day of rest for me and my buddy, who consumed a heroic amount of gin and tonics. I managed not to be too fuzzy from alcohol, but from the lack of sleep. Despite recent scholarship, I bloody need 8 hours of sleep each night. 
<p>Cheers!</p>

She really wasn't impressed?  What, is she from the West Coast or something?
