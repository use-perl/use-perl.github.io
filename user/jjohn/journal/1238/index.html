<p><p>Here's an brief write up of my trip to DC for O'Reilly's P2P 
Conference.
<p>Because airplanes are becoming an increasingly unattractive 
travel option, I took Amtrak's <a href="http://amtrak.com/destinations/washington-dc.html">Acela line</a> from Boston to DC. With Hebrew National Hot Dogs 
in the diner car and 120V AC outlets at every coach seat, trains are my 
preferred way to travel. I like being able to get a worm's eye view of some 
of the cities along the route.
<p>Providence, RI was the home of horror writer H. P. Lovecraft and it still 
has an omnious air to it, although that might be due the giant Fox Lady 
billboards. Commercial real estate is cheaper in Providence that Boston and 
it's only a 30 minute train ride away. Providence should be more aggressively
going after businesses looking to locate in Boston, I think. There's money to 
be made there. 
<p>New London, CT has a cool boardwalk and ferry near the train tracks which 
facilitates travel. I'd like to visit that town more at some point. It looks 
like a nice place to live.
<p>Arriving in New York by train remained me of where old tires go: along 
the train tracks in Brooklin. What the hell. I'd be unhappy to see my 
town marred by that level of garbage, but then I don't live in New York.
Obviously, there was a noticable hole in the Manhatten skyline. My fellow
passenagers where noticably quieter during the passage through Penn Station.
<p>Trenton, NJ was a lot prettier than I remember. It's a shame that Newark
ruins Jersey's reputation, although Newark really is an armpit. I have found 
memories a brief trip to Asbury Park I took a few years ago. Good times; 
good times. 
<p>There are two things I remember about DC: obfuscated roads and a 
barricaded Capital building. Boston gets a lot of flack for its suboptimal 
street layout. I like to remind those critics that our cows did the best they 
could while drunk, so just lay off! In DC, urban planners 
<em>purposefully</em> created a concrete maze that would foil foreign 
invaders. It appears that the only ones confused are the turists. Also of 
note was the security around the Capital building. I knew that the approach 
to the Whitehouse would be closed, but I was hoping to see the Capital 
building. Unfortunately, it was closed to the public. In fact, the entrance
was <em>barricaded</em> by a car. Scattered throughout the city were 
non-descript black SUVs filled with men in dark glasses and ear pieces. 
So, it's good to see that we are winning the war on Terrorism. 
<p>I didn't go to many of the sessions at the conference. My purpose there 
was to present a talk on XML-RPC with Tim Allwine and to catch up with old
friends. The biggest buzz was made by some folks from the Joint Chiefs of 
Staff who told the attendees that heavy military hardware (warships, planes, 
etc) was running on Lotus Notes and NT. Sleep tight, America. They urged 
the crowd to develop P2P solutions that could safely replace these desktop 
systems. For instance, they would like a network system where vehicles could 
approach each other and become part of the same network. That's a pretty 
groovy idea. I think that could also work for PC hardware. Imagine, just 
placing your printer near a machine in your network would make it available
to your workgroup. Coolio!
<p>I had a great time and hope to do it again soon.

The DC streetplan isn't designed to foil foreign invasion.  It didn't prevent the Canucks from burning the White House after all.
<p>
The diagonalization of the DC street plan is proof that Pierre L'Enfant was a maladjusted Frenchman who secretly hated the US.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>
