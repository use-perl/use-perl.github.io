<p>Wow. That durn Farscape show keeps kicking my head in AGAIN and AGAIN. Just when I thought the show couldn't get any better, it does. Wow. This penultimate show of season three was just fabulous. Strong performances from the all the cast (especially John Tupu) and a hella script from Farscape's daddy Rochne O'Bannon leave all us 'scapers wondering: what the heck is left for the season finale? For next Friday's show, I'm wearing rubber pants.

Damn that's a good show. I just wish it had a better run down here in Aus. There was a good time over summer while they were stripping the show, seasons 1 and 2 - had it on weekdays at 5pm and then most nights at about 10.30pm, 11pm.<br> <br>As far as I know, they haven't started showing season 3 down here - and damnit, they make the damn thing down here.

<p>Wow, that's gotta suck! The Brits have the edge on Farscape over <em>both</em> the US and Austrailia? WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?!
</p><p>Keep your eyes open for Season 2 DVDs, which are rumored to be onsale now in Oz.</p>

I think I noticed some the other something. I wasn't paying too much attention, mostly because I haven't got a DVD player.<br> <br>Amusingly, a friend of mine was house sitting for one of the Farscape producers over summer. He had fun watching bits of season 4.
