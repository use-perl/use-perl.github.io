<div class="span8">
<p><p>Before the hideous snows descended upon an unsuspecting Massachusetts, I was romping around Harvard Square with a friend of mine, who mentioned that <a href="http://www.mnftiu.cc/mnftiu.cc/home.html">David Rees</a> was signing
collections of his "Get Your War On" and "My New Fighting Technique is 
Unstoppable" at <a href="http://world.std.com/user/myp/">Million Year Picnic</a>. 
So, after a buffet lunch at Bombay Club, we schlepped over to the comic book 
shop, which had only a few people in it.  Our access to the author was 
unfettered.  Rees is a very nice, very unassuming guy.  I asked him about the 
volume of hate mail he receives for "Get You War On" and his answer surprised 
me.  It seems that he receives far less than he expected.  Weird.  
<p>However, this pleasant little interview took a decidedly bizarre twist when 
a gaunt, bearded gentlemen entered the store.  It was none other than public 
broadcasting badboy <a href="http://world.law.harvard.edu/">Christopher 
Lydon</a>.  Apparently, Lydon was there to interview Rees for something.  The
highlight of the episode was Lydon requesting the "unexpurgated" version of 
the poster advertising Rees's apparence at MYP that featured the word "motherfucker".
<p>Try to get <em>that</em> past the censor, bee-yatch!  C-Dawg's straight 
outta Compton, yo.  C-Dawg's in da hizzel!
<p>Later that day, I bought a shirt in Inman Square featuring the panicked 
phrase "Can't sleep; clowns will eat me."
<p>I'm out, yo.  Peace.

"Bah!  We're living in the <i>21st Century</i>, and people <i>still</i> wage war to impress invisible superheroes who live in outer space!  I though we would all be chilling out in solar-powered flying cars by now!"
