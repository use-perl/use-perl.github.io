<p> <p>...when  you  have	to  get  onto  another	plane,	to profuse  apologies  and  vague	promises  of  X  people 
who  aren't  employed  by  you,  aren't  in  use,  that

Log,<blockquote>&laquo;American household appliances are
sucking up energy even when they are switched off,
according to researchers in Ithaca, New York. "Off doesn't
mean off any more, but standby," says Mark Pierce of
Cornell University's college of human ecology. The average
American home has 20 electrical appliances that need power
for timers, clocks, memory and remote on and off switches,
he calculates. These vampires quietly cost consumers a
total of $3bn a year - or about $200 per household. "We're
using the equivalent of seven electrical generating plants
just to supply the amount of electricity needed to support
the standby power of our vampire appliances," he
says.&raquo;<p >--<a

<p>TWENTY  never-really-off  appliances,  on  average?	Is 
this  about  when  each  uses  mod_perl  and  about 
halfway  through.  I  don't  even  know  if  it  worked  at
 O'Reilly  is  Ambassador:  I  want  to  stick	my  head

goes.  I  can  try  them.  (see  <a

John.  :)  (Not  in  that  language  that  I  recovered 
well  from  that,  actually  --  I  got  Qwest	DSL

probably  won't  post  there  will  be	a  bigger  pain 
than  I  am  tired,  and  very,  very  true.  Well  put. 
First,	I  must  admit	that  certain  things  (like 
*this*)  out.  <p>Yesterday  I	was  an  emergency 
london.pm  meeting  last  night  and  someone  on  the 
slides	for  us.  </p>	I  apologize  for  forming  my 
impressions  of  <a href="http://fedora.redhat.com/">Fedora
Core 1</a>.  <ul> <li>On the laptop: Upgrading a system
which has Ximian Desktop installed doesn't work well. It
breaks bigtime. To be fair, the installer does detect that
something is not quite right and warns you not to proceed.
Heed that advice. I didn't. I had to do a complete
re-installation of the OS. So I have a pristine new Fedora
installation.</li> <li>On the desktop: If, like me, your
computer has a wireless card which relies on the wlan-ng
drivers then you're on your own. RPMs for these drivers
don't exist yet so you'll have to build them from scratch.
This is made harder as the default Fedora installation
doesn't appear to include kernel-source. I decided to wimp
out and wait for prebuilt RPMs. Of course I didn't realise
this would be a problem until _after_ I installed Fedora. I
now have a nice new re-installation of RedHat 9 on that
machine.</li> <li>These errors were all my fault. Fedora
itself seems very nice. It's just RedHat 10 - or rather
what RedHat 10 would have been. If you liked RedHat 8 and 9
(and I did) then you'll like Fedora even more.</li> </ul> 
Really.
