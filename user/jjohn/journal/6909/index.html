<p><p><i>note: This is adapted from an email conversation I had recently.</i>

<p>Humans are nothing if not ingenious recyclers of their environment. I 
believe the ancient Romans used to clean their clothes with a brew  
that included urine procured for a small fee from urban pedestrians.

<p>Contraception too has its roots in waste products. Women in pharaonic Egyptian
used to employ a crocodile dung compound as a sort of spermicide. Apparently, 
this prophylactic fell out of use in the modern era. About the time
Adam Smith was writing about the "invisible hand of Capitalism," Europeans
were pinning their contraceptive hopes on the stopping power of lemons.
I assume that there were other benefits to using a more palatable  
substance than crocodile excrement. Even considering the high level of filth 
that people lived with back then, I think an extra dollop of fecal mass 
(particularly that of a rare and exotic beast) would have had a deleterious
effect on the libidos of all but the most sorely pressed of couples. 
Certainly if the Hindus had had only the Egyptian method available, the 
_Karma Sutra_ would have been a greatly abbreviated tome.

 <p> Contraception is an offense [ and has been for centuries ] of such proportions that it can get you excommunicated since sex is only for the purpose of procreation...which catholics seem to do quite well. Of course, being a <a href="http://www.salon.com/news/wire/2002/08/05/vatican/index.html" title="salon.com">woman who wants to be a priest</a salon.com> in the church will get you excommunicated too...of course, being a male priest buggering little boys is just fine. But I'm not bitter...or anything.  If it weren't for the church I suspect there would be a pill for men by now. </p>  <p> If you're into contraceptive history you might have a go at <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/080903817X/" title="amazon.com"> <i>Devices and Desires</i> </a amazon.com> [ <i>Wang</i> publisher no less<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) ] and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0300089430/" title="amazon.com"> <i>Sexual Chemistry: A History of the Contraceptive Pill</i> </a amazon.com>. </p>
