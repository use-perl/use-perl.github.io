<p><p><a href="http://www.altonbrown.com/">Alton Brown</a> is a mad scientist.  Watch his cooking show on the Food Network for more than 
five minutes and you will reach the same conclusion.   While mad scientists
typically tamper with chthonic forces of nature to remake life in their 
own mad vision, Brown's material of choice is food.  His vision is the same
though.</p> 
<p>This post isn't about how entertaining AB is (he is) or how effective 
his teaching style is (very) or even about the tastiness of his recipes 
(intensely).  Instead, I want to share with you what I learned about web 
design from Brown's web site.  But first, more about me.
<p>I have little graphic talent.  That is I can't draw very well, nor can 
I select a pleasant pallet colors.  I can't sketch well, paint well or sculpt 
well.  I just don't think that part of my brain works or perhaps it's just 
very sleepy.  While I understand how to use graphic manipulation programs 
like Gimp, I can do very little with them because, as I've mentioned, I have 
no talent.</p>  
<p>Most of the time, it's not a problem that I don't have graphic 
talent because that's not my job.  However, there are times when I get 
frustrated by this hole in my skills.  In particular there are common 
graphic motifs that are ubiquitous on the web that I can't reproduce for the 
life of me.  One of those elements litters Brown's web site: the curved box.
What I'm talking about is those lime-green containers that define the sections
of text.  Each corner of those boxes of texts is curved.  I have long known
that this effect is achieved with small graphic files, but in my own 
experiments I was unable to create the rather oblique curves needed in my 
graphic application.  
<p>And so, I despaired...until today.</p>
<p>As I was looking enviously at Brown's site, I decided to examine one of
the corner graphics apart from the page on which it sits.  To my surprise, 
it had very different dimensions than what the HTML source showed.  Moreover, 
the graphic was a simple quarter of a circle!  Circles, I can make!</p>
<p>Putting it all together, the recipe for creating those curved corners is 
the following:</p>
<ul>
   <li>Fire up your graphics package
   <li>Create a new graphic 40 x 40 pixels (for instance)
   <li>Fill the background with the desired background color of your site.
       (or leave transparent)
   <li>Pick a forground for the circle that you're about to draw
   <li>Inscribe a circle so that radius extends to the edges of the graphic
   <li>Save
   <li>quarter the circle so that you have four 20 x 20 squares.  Each square
       will have an arc in it.
   <li>Save each quarter to a separate file 
</ul>
<p>The magic now comes when you reference these graphics in HTML.  Simply
<b>augment the width or height parameter of the IMG tag</b> to achieve a 
fancy sweeping arc.  Turn the graphic into a rectangle and the browser 
will make the arc for you.</p>
<p>When your boss gives you a raise for your amazing web design savvy, tell
'em Joe sent ya!</p>

<h2>&quot;Build an Icon Factory&quot;</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/merlyn/">merlyn</a> on 2004-08-24T18:08:08</h3>
You could also just do it on the fly, thanks to <a href="http://www.stonehenge.com/merlyn/WebTechniques/col47.html" title="stonehenge.com">a program I wrote for a column</a stonehenge.com>.  No art skills involved!



<h2>Mozilla CSS, too</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Purdy/">Purdy</a> on 2004-08-24T18:51:28</h3>
You can also do this in native HTML, though it doesn't seem to work in IE (chalk another one up for Firefox!).<br> <br>I picked it up from Google's AdWords interface - with table cells, you can do this <a href="http://www.eightlines.com/neil/mozskin/csscommands.html" title="eightlines.com">moz-border-radius </a eightlines.com> attribute in a style.  Makes for nice tabs at the top.



<h2>Another approach with CSS</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ajtaylor/">ajtaylor</a> on 2004-08-24T20:57:51</h3>
A List Apart has a recent article <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/mountaintop/" title="alistapart.com">Mountaintop Corners</a alistapart.com> which achieves the same type of effect using CSS with a small background image. The result is a very clean &amp; elegant look (IMHO) with scales easily.
