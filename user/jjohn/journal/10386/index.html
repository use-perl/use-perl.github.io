<p><p>I distrust the "Homeland Security Department" mostly because "homeland" sounds far too close to "fatherland." Had the department been called "domestic securty," I don't think the image of jack-booted Nazis goosestepping in the capital would have come so quickly to mind. </p>

<h2>Sorta</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/pudge/">pudge</a> on 2003-02-04T14:31:06</h3>
I don't think of Fatherland, but I think it sounds fascist in some way.  Maybe I am subconsciously thinking of Fatherland.  Something about it sounds very fascist, though.<br> <br>I do think of 1984 ("HomeSec"), however.<br> <br>Also, the proper name is Department of Homeland Security, which makes the name sound even worse: "DHS" was the initials of the high school where I grew up.



<h2>homeland security</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/inkdroid/">inkdroid</a> on 2003-02-04T15:34:52</h3>
Not only is it a somewhat scary institution I think it is redundant as well...I always thought the FBI handled the stuff within the US, and the CIA handled the stuff outside the US...



<h2>Won't last forever</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/djberg96/">djberg96</a> on 2003-02-04T17:03:49</h3>
I don't expect the DHS to stick around forever.  I figure if nothing major happens in the next 20 years, it'll probably be eliminated or absorbed by the FBI.



<h2>marketing</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/wickline/">wickline</a> on 2003-02-04T19:08:07</h3>
<br>The name smells like a marketing move to me. It's supposed to make you feel all warm and fuzzy and patriotic and safe. I suppose they wanted to avoid anything that sounded like the various national security organizations from cold war era eastern european nations.<br> <br>-matt<br>



<h2>It's not just you</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/rjray/">rjray</a> on 2003-02-04T20:22:54</h3>
<p>The name really bothers me, as well, for pretty much those exact same reasons. Even my hard-right friends who favor going into Iraq, and think Bush is just swell, find the whole "Homeland Security" thing making them itch.</p>
