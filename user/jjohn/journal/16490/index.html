<blockquote>
&laquo;One of the reasons American programmers aren't competing here (in America) is that users expect to get software for free, and in that environment little new stuff gets created, and we have to keep creating to justify the greater amount of money we make (over Indians). But if all we make are commodities, then Indians working for low pay beat Americans working for free. (People who work for free have no incentive to please users, or even create usable software.)&raquo;

<p>Here's a business tip from your old pal Joe: create products that address real information pain for people with MONEY.  There's plenty of gold in them thar hills.  You just need the right pan.  <p>Frontier is <em>not</em> the right pan.</p>

<h2>Winer</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/pudge/">pudge</a> on 2003-12-24T18:17:57</h3>
He is just bitter because he could not make the transition from freeware to payware.  That's all it is.  Lots of companies do just fine with shareware and payware.  He blames his problems on free software.  I love how he likes Bush because Bush is -- in his mind -- willing to unnecessarily spend taxpayer dollars on his software instead of something that costs less, and is mad at Dean and Clark for not spending money unnecessarily, which -- in his mind -- equates to "going after" businesses that charge money for this stuff.  He probably thinks SCO has good points about the GPL, too.<br> <br>He's an idiot.  He thinks that people who charge money have a sacred right over those who don't.  He hasn't a philosophical, legal, or hollow leg to stand on (for those of you in Rio Linda: I am saying HE IS A DRUNKARD).<br> <br>Cool that the Wired story mentions Slash and quotes chromatic; sucks that they don't mention John Edwards' campaign uses Slash!<br>

<p>I secretly wish the reporter had quoted me saying that it's especially nice to see campaigns working on open source software that other campaigns -- competing campaigns -- can use.  Of course, there was already a quote to that effect.  Still, that's my favorite part.</p>

<h2>Always look for pain</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/delegatrix/">delegatrix</a> on 2003-12-24T20:58:23</h3>
Recognizing someone's "pain" is the key to many ventures in life - negotiations, employment, relationships, proposals,<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...



<h2>Whiner [sic] is just like</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/hfb/">hfb</a> on 2003-12-24T23:40:32</h3>
ESR...someone whom lots of people bitch about but really doesn't have a lot to contribute in spite of all the press they get. I still wonder why people don't just ignore them both.
