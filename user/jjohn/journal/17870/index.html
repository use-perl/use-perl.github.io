<p> a  great  job	with  more  similarities.  <EM>Please excuse	Chris  from  having  a	hysterectomy  is  "cold", 
though.<p>  Dear  Log,	<p><blockquote>&laquo;Miami police
also invited reporters to "embed" with them in armoured
vehicles and helicopters. As in Iraq, most reporters
embraced their role as pseudo soldiers with zeal, suiting
up in combat helmets and flak jackets. <p>The resulting
media coverage was the familiar wartime combination of
dramatic images and non-information. We know, thanks to an
"embed" from the Miami Herald, that Timoney was working so
hard hunting down troublemakers that by 3:30pm on Thursday
"he had eaten only a banana and a cookie since 6am".
<p>Local TV stations didn't cover the protests so much as
hover over them. Their helicopters showed images of
confrontations, but instead of hearing the voices on the
streets - voices pleading with police to stop shooting and
clearly following orders to disperse - we heard only from
police officials and perky news anchors commiserating with
the boys on the front line. <p>Meanwhile, independent
journalists who dared to do their jobs and film the police
violence up close were actively targeted. "She's not with
us," one officer told another as they grabbed Ana Nogueira,
a correspondent with <a
href="http://www.democracynow.org/">Pacifica Radio's
Democracy Now!</a> who was covering a peaceful protest
outside the Miami-Dade county jail. When the police
established that Nogueira was "not with us" (ie neither an
embedded reporter nor undercover cop) she was hauled away
and charged. <p>[...] Already, Jim Wilkinson, director of
strategic communications at US Central Command in Doha,
Qatar (the operation that gave the world the Jessica Lynch
rescue), has moved to New York to head up media operations
for the Republican National Convention. "We're looking at
embedding reporters," he told the New York Observer of his
plans to use some of the Iraq tricks during the convention.
"We're looking at new and interesting camera
angles."&raquo; <p>--<a
