<p><p>As of April 11, I have been blogging on use.perl.org for a year. It seems like only 13 months. Weird. In any case, I'd say this experiment with blogging has been interesting for me (if no one else). My biggest concerns with blogging are:
<ul>
  <li>typing to see my pretty words
  <li>composing entries so that don't say what I really mean
  <li>taking blogging too seriously
</uL>
<p>A few months ago, I consciously stopped doing daily (hourly?) entries because I felt I had stopped trying to say anything meaningful (for a large deviation of "meaningful"). Instead, I was more interested in watching the total number of my blog entries increase. That is a stupid use of my time. I will renew my effort to make this blog not only interesting to me, but [dare to dream] to make it relevant to others. After all, I find diaries somewhat distastful. I've never kept one myself before blogging. Unlike a diary, blogs are a public document. One of things use.perl.org does right is provide the option of allowing other users to comment on an entry, an idea that is incongruent with a private diary.

<p>Another interesting part of blogging on use.perl.org is the phenomenon of parallel conversations that start among other people's blogs. It's not quite like usenet, where there is some pretense of a directed conversation. Instead, it sort of reminds me of the McLaughlin Group. Someone states an opinion to no one in particular. Then another blogger shouts "WRONG!" and preceeds to rant [again to no one in particular] about the egregious reasoning proffered by the first blogger. And then the fun really starts. I sometimes imagine that use.perl.org blogging is like going to the carnival and passing all the barkers advertising their booths. Sometimes, the blog entries are just as lurid. 
<p>In any case, I think I'll be blogging here for the forseeable future. I've build enough of my own web sites at this point. I don't need another one dedicated to my prattling. For those that have been reading my blog, I appreciate your patronage and your comments. Thanks for dropping by. 
</p>

Clearly, I need to put some more people on my buddy list so I can get at these lurid entries.
