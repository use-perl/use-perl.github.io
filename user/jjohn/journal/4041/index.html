<p><p>I'm <a href="http://www.edsbookreview.com/humor/franken_rush_limbaugh.html">pseudo-certain</a> that I read more than the average American. With equal fuzziness, I'm sure that I read less than most of my geeky friends. Never one to have intellectual sand kicked in my face, I occasionally go out buy books. This happened a few months back and heralded in my brief tour of 20th century Sci-Fi (I'm halfway through <i>Red Mars</i> now). As it's spring, a young(-ish) man's mind turns away from computers to thoughts of the <a href="http://www.nationalgeographic.com/ngm/100best/storyA_story.html"><b>ladies</b></a>. 
<p><i>Bitch: In Praise of Difficult Women</i>, if the backmatter is to be believed, will be a cathartic <a href="http://skepdic.com/est.html">EST session</a>
for my gyno-oppressive mind. As the movie <i>Slackers</i> says: "you must quit terrorizing women with sexual intercourse." And I believe it!
<p>After getting my manhood adjusted, Michael Moore continues the psychological smackdown with <i>Stupid White Men</i>. Maybe he can help me find the little republican hurting inside of me.
<p>Having studied a fair amount of Mid-Eastern politics  and history at UMass/Boston, I hope <i>The Shi'is of Iraq</i> will bring me up to speed on a country and people with whom we will likely soon be at war (see previous book).
<p>The wildcard of this batch o' books is 
<i>Emily, the Strange</i>. It's a sort of comic book/art thingie featuring the eponymous iconoclast. Art is good.
<p>As a stinging rebuke of <i><code>$foo</code> for Dummies</i> books, Barry Tarshis entitled his book <i>Grammar for Smart People</i>. I didn't know how much grammar I had forgotten until I had worked at O'Reilly (I'm looking at you, Caroline Senay).
<p>My spree finishes with a "dictionnarrative" by Karen Elizabeth Gordon (of <i>Deluxe Transitive Vampire</i> fame). Ever get screwed using the wrong homonym? Ever tack on "from" to "whence?" You won't after reading this grammatic fairytale.
<p>Because the use.perl.org community has come to vitally depend on my reviews of non-technical books, I will be sure to post reviews of these treasures as I complete them.</p>

With a litany of titles like that, you need to get yourself reading some <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0679752986" title="amazon.com">good stuff</a amazon.com>.  I lent this one to Mr. Sugalski a few days ago (to occupy himself during the final four), and he said that it was <i>waaaaay</i> twisted, even by Phildickan standards.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

<i>Stupid White Men</i> is a great read and I'm not surprised the publisher was worried post Sept 11th, he really has it in for the Bushes.
