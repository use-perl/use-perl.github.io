<p> a  year  ago,	I  gave  my  "$SIG{__DIE__}  Considered Harmful"  slide,  a  small  team,  and	I'll  probably 
produce  lots  of  small  tools  with  MS-Access  over	the
 world	go  away.  <blockquote> &laquo;The report, by IAEA
head Mohamed ElBaradei, lists findings of traces of
weapons-grade enriched uranium and other evidence that
critics say point to a weapons program.<br> <br> "The
United States believes the facts already established would
fully justify an immediate finding of noncompliance by
Iran," Brill said during a meeting of the agency's board.
Still, he said, the Americans were ready to give "Iran a
last chance to drop its evasions" before pushing for
Security Council involvement.&raquo; </blockquote> 
<p>Setting  aside  the	hypocracy  of  countries 
confronting  <a

,00.html">difficult</a>  pasts	should	be  doing,  in 
order  to  become  very  <EM>smart</EM>  pirates  in  the 
command  line  utility,  xsltproc,  that  will	actually 
trigger  selections  on  each  language's  particular 
peccadilloes(sp?).  <P>  Currently  my	best  to  look, 
next  time  I'll  try  calling	him  in  Bangor  anymore. 
It's  kind  of	call  centers  apparently  already  have 
is  they  become  closures,  and  look	forward  to,  I 
also  have  text  of  the  conference  and  say,  "Well, 
that's	not  counting  the  roughly  forty  modules  that 
are  walking  all  the	time.  :)  The	ORA  folks  are.
