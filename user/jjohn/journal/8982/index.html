<p><p>I am a dork. <p>This is a conclusion that I've been avoiding for some years now, 
but after attending the Comic book/Sci-Fi Convention today I must own
up to my social problem. I also learned to have <em>a lot of cash on hand 
in small bills</em> when attending these events. Comparisons to Vegas are 
not inappropriate. There was no ATM in the convention area, which is a little 
unusual for the Expo. Ouside and at the other end of the large convention 
building was an ATM machine from a bank to which I did not belong. Since I 
walk a lot, fetching money from this location would normally not be onerous. 
However it was drizzling rain today, I stupidly wore my heel-irratating boots
and the ATM fees were high. However, I did extract $60 from it, thinking it 
would be enough. This sum was very, very close to being sufficient. 

<p><b>Nichelle Nichols</b>
<p>While waiting in line to buy admission to the event, a gruff, determined
man demanded that those in line should "make way." Because I'm a sheep, I 
did. The man was escorting the fabulous Nichelle Nichols, Lt. Uhura from 
Star Trek, into the event. She walked within 3 feet of me. Cool! She was 
wearing some kind of fur coat with rather large sunglasses (recall it was
raining). Lot's of fun.

<p><b>Anthony Simcoe</b>
<p>Farscape's D'Argo was signing photos and hawking his "Number 96" Demo CD. 
He seemed pleasant enough. I gave him one of my 
<a href="http://taskboy.com/">Taskboy</a> cards and told him about the "crazy"
music to be found there. I'll have to invite him to my next poker party.

<p><b>Gigi Edgley</b>
<p>The fabulous and energetic Gigi Edgely was a surprise guest at the Expo. 
She's very, very tiny. She's also wonderfully charismatic and interacted 
cheerfully with the fans (as did Anth, but my eye was more on G) -- except 
for me. I should explain that while she was signing her photo, I discovered 
that I was <b>a dollar shy</b> of being able to pay for it. Yikes! Since I 
didn't have Ms. Manners with me, I gave $19 bucks (all I had) to Gigi's 
money guy and told them I'd be back with the difference. I did not take the 
photo. Gigi was visibly annoyed, but then I have the effect on a good number 
of people and I've learned to move on. After leaving the hall (again) on 
route to the mechanical money god, I decided that I didn't really want to pay 
another an ATM fee of $1.25 just to get a dollar. Besides, I only bought the 
photos and such to support the Farscape campaign and the actors themselves. 
That's why I left the $19 with Gigi (sorry about wasting the photo!). 
So when Gigi relates this story during her convention talks, you can say
"Dude! I know that Loser!". If Gigi ever reads this, I deeply and abjectly 
apologize for wasting your time. I will continue to buy Farscape DVDs though.

<p>Some thoughts on the crowd. 

<p>My first paid job was as a clerk in a comic book store. I was paid $2.50 
per hour (under the table) and I was immersed in the comic book subculture, 
such as it was, on Cape Cod. Years later when I saw the Simpsons character 
of the Comic Book guy, I howled with laughter and marveled at the 
authenticity of the characterization. Comic book collectors and Sci/Fi fans
have what psychologists call <a href="http://216.239.39.100/search?q=cache:RYMNHBi4lRwC:www.medscape.com/viewarticle/431517_7+fantasy+prone&hl=en&ie=UTF-8">fantasty-prone personalities</a>. Did I see Star Fleet Officers? Yes. Did I see 
Storm Troopers? Yes. Did I see Medieval customs aplenty? You betcha. However, 
I did not see as many, can I call them freaks?, as I thought I would. 

<p>The essence of these gatherings is voyeristic. At its most harmless, 
browsing through rare and expensive comics is exciting because it involves
the fantasy of owning them (thinking that the collection before you 
<em>is</em<> yours). Gawking at "famous people" is another common activity at 
these conventions. Because most of the spectators were classic introverts, 
the gawking at a distance took on some of the quality of truckers at a strip 
bar. That makes me a bit sad but also helps to underscore the damage that 
years of living in Puritan-haunted Massachusetts has done to me.

<p>The convention was fun. I'm glad I went. I spent more money that I wanted 
to. Oh, I saw the actor who played the second in command on "Lost In Space". 
No Bill Mumy, though. Bummer.

<h2>Gawking</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/pudge/">pudge</a> on 2002-11-18T21:50:21</h3>
I don't gawk at celebrities, or even acknowledge their existence.  Maybe that comes from living in California for my formative years.<br> <br>I like what Alan Alda does: when asked for an autograph, he says no, but would you like chat for a moment instead?  Some people think the various problems of society are guns, oil, drugs, computers, music, hollywood, whatever.  I think it is our obsession with celebrities.  Think about all the time and money wasted on just looking at or learning personal tidbits about people that have *no consequence* to your life.  It's gotta be in the billions.  Sure, it creates jobs for "entertainment reporters" and SciFi conventioneers, but other than that, it's a huge bloody drain on society.<br> <br>Get rid of celebrities and society will enter a new Golden Age where there is no war or pestilence!<br> <br>

You wouldn't say that if you'd ever met Chris Nandor.  He's dreamy!  If he had a website, I'd visit it every day!

<p>
(In my Serious Writer moments, I consider creating a website called <em>American Pantheon</em> that compares celebrity-worship to ancient mythologies.)
