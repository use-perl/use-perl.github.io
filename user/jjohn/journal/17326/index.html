<p>As reported by CBS and the Daily Show, <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/02/09/national/main598794.shtml">American Airlines pilot pushes Jesus</a>.
<blockquote>
&laquo;American's Flight 34 was headed from Los Angeles to New York's John F. Kennedy Airport on Friday when the pilot asked Christians on board to raise their hands, Wagner said.
<br><br>
The pilot, whose name was not released, told the airline that he then suggested the other passengers use the flight time to talk to the Christians about their faith, Wagner said.
<br><br>
"Well, you have a choice, you can make this trip worthwhile or you can sit back relax, read a book or watch a movie," passenger Amanda Nelligan told WCBS-TV of New York the pilot said. &raquo;
</blockquote>
<p>There's nothing that settles a nervous passenger's mind more than knowing 
that the man piloting his plane has a solid belief in a glorious afterlife.  
Indeed, this incident bothers me far more than the unexpected nipple appearing
at sporting events.  Generally, I have no truck with missionaries.  They 
reminded too much of Willy Loman or boy scouts trying to get merit badges.

<i>There's nothing that settles a nervous passenger's mind more than knowing that the man piloting his plane has a solid believe in a glorious afterlife.</i> -- as long as he doesn't believe that crashing it on heathens will not make it even more glorious, that should be fine... But you'll never know: when somebody feels the urge to talk to complete strangers about his personal beliefs, it's probably that he thinks he's near the death...

or an evangelical/fundy who goes door to door in his spare time. The US seems to have plenty of those types. Either way, damn, I would have been checking for the locations of the exits and wondering where to score a parachute.

Given the <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/issues/2001/11/langewiesche.htm" title="theatlantic.com">fairly recent crash</a theatlantic.com> of EgyptAir which many blame on the pilot who said "I rely on God" (or something very close) before smashing 217 people into the Atlantic.



<h2>Problems</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/pudge/">pudge</a> on 2004-02-11T03:51:35</h3>
Anyone who is bothered by the fact that their pilot is a Christian and believes in an afterlife in heaven really has a serious problem.<br> <br>It used to be that a non-Christian airline pilot was stranger than a Christian one; I don't know how it is today, but regardless, it's completely beside the point whether he has a "solid belief in a glorious afterlife."  The real point is that he bothered to express it in the way he did: that shows a real imbalance, questionable judgment.  I'd feel just as unnerved with him saying that as I would if he'd come over the PA and said, "is that Freedom Rock?  well TURN IT UP!" and then cranked the Credence, and for the same reasons.<br>

Hey now!  Does no one forgive grooviness any more?
