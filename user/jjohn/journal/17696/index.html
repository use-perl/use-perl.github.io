<p><p><A href="http://www.homestarrunner.com/">Homestar Runner</a> is a cartoon of humble proportions.  Using web technologies like Flash and MP3s
merely as vehicals to convey their fractured fairy tales, the Chapman 
Brothers, Mike and Matt (with guest appearences by Melissa Palmer), brighten 
many a geek's Monday morning with Strong Bad emails, fake commercials and 
one-off non-sequitors.  What's most remarkable is that their humor is 
accessible to an audience of wide ranging ages.  I trust I don't need to 
further sing the praises of Homestar and the gang to the use.perl community?
<p>So, who would like to see the Brothers Chap at OSCON this year?  I know I 
would.  Perhaps you can show your support for the idea with a comment?  By 
some miracle, <a href="/user/gnat/journal">someone organizing OSCON</a> might read
this blog and pursue this further.
<p>Do you really want to hear another talk on how OpenSource software is 
ready for e-business?  Neither do I. ;-)

<p>Well, everything has gotten stale in the past few years. I'll bet 50 bucks right now that there'll be some wanker talking about the miracles of Orkut as proof of the 'revolution'. It's not like people sitting in the back of the rooms with their laptops and wireless are bothering to pay attention to the talks anyway. </p>

<p>Maybe they could just have filler like porn movies or LotR extended editions during the day and save the money for the speakers and whatnot for the parties in the evening. Homestar Runner: The drink meet. Who cares about the terribly tried and tired technology behind the web site? Get those boys drunk and enjoy an evening of conversation instead.</p>

Hey, my brother was killed by an open-source XML-based templating system once! You shut your dirty mouth!

How about Bruce Sterling?  He spoke at the American Library Association shindig last year, so I bet he's not too bigtime to show up to the Open Source conference!  I even kinda know him sorta a bit.
<p>(In an ideal world, I'd have him talk, then Brian Eno, then Laurie Anderson.  I assume the latter two are much less available, but it wouldn't hurt.  Depends on the conf budget -- e.g., Eno would probably have to be flown in from London then.  Sterling, in comparison, would probably be just in Austin, rather closer.)</p>

</p><p>Too late.  Someone already invented him, however implausible that may seem.</p>

Did I say invent?  Hm.  I meant invite, but invent sure is funnier!  My subconsciousness is funnier than my consciousness!
