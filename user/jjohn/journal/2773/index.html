<p><p>Lincoln Stein's <pre>Apache::MP3</pre> has been fun to play with. It's nice to have tunes in the bedroom as well as the living room. The machine that hosts the streaming mp3 server was somewhat underpowered when I started, both because it had merely 64M of RAM and only 300M of free hard drive space (of course, that was <em>awesome</em> in 1998). Although I was able to smoothly able to put in 256M of RAM, the BIOS didn't like the new 40G Western Digital hard drive. Instead, I found an old 4G hard drive that I pressed into service. I formated the drive with the reiser journaling filesystem to see how that works. I should crash the machine to test it, but I'm too chicken. Never mind: my neighborhood's power will fail soon enough.
<p>I'll be subclassing <pre>Apache::MP3</pre> so that it should the remain free space on the drive hosting the mpegs. It may not be portable, but I don't care. <pre>:-p</pre>.
<p>The only really problem I've noticed with the streaming is that the last second of every track is clipped. I'm not sure what's up with that. Is there somekind of pause I can put in so that just because the client player sees the end of the stream, it won't fetch the next track until it finishes playing the current one? This already sounds like a client-side problem, but I'm experiencing it with both Windows Real Player and Linux XMMS. If you have a solution for this problem, please drop me a note.</p>

I don't think I've ever noticed that.

That argues strongly for a client-side problem. Thanks for the non-bug report, pudge.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)
