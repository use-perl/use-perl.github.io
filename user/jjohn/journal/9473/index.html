<p><p>Wouldn't it be cool to make your own synthesizer in Perl? With alittle rudimentary physics and a CPAN module, you can produce the monophonic opus of your dreams without leaving the protective womb
of your favorite editor. 

<p>Experienced readers of this journal will note that I am 
interested in music. Not only do I listen to quite a bit of it, 
but I've been playing, composing and recording music at the hobbist level
(read: wanker level) for over ten years now. While you can limp 
along as an audio engineer without understanding the dynamics of 
audio waves, this knowledge can save quite a bit of time during 
tracking and mixing. Knowing which band of frequencies best accentuates 
those instruments in your mix can help you fill out your sound while
reducing unintentional mush ("mush" is a technical term). 

<p>Listeners of <a href="http://taskboy.com/music/">my recent music</a> 
will notice a lot of MIDI sequencing. 
From drums to bass to keyboards, it seems I've discovered the little 
Gary Neumann inside of me. I use 
<a href="http://www.cakewalk.com/">Cakewalk Pro Audio 9</A> for sequencing 
the MIDI patches that my SoundBlast Live card has (with additional 
SoundFonts I bought from a third party). Pro Audio allows me to blend 
MIDI sequences with "live" audio tracks (vocals, guitars and other assorted 
noises captured by microphones). These audio tracks can be recorded with 
Pro Audio or WAV files can be imported into the current project. This is 
how I work with samples from various movies or CDs. My TV, VCR and CD player
are components of my PC (even if they weren't, I have an external Mackie 
mixer which routes various sound sources through one set of speakers and 
to my PC, producing the same result for this purpose). I sample by playing 
back the orginal source while recording the audio signal with Cakewalk. As a 
WAV file, it is then easy to edit and modify that sample to taste.

<p>Music is fun (but not always profitable) when its experimental. Just 
as I've recorded spatulas and toolboxes as percussion elements in the 
past, I found that my experiments with IBM's ViaVoice speech synthesis 
software to have pleasant musical applications (at least, pleasant by 
my reckoning). Since Perl is a big part of my life, I have wanted to 
incorporate some our favorite scripting into my music. When I found the 
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/author/NPESKETT/Audio-Wav-0.02/Wav.pm">Audio::WAV</a> 
module on CPAN, I seized upon the opportunity to learn more about WAV files 
and audio dynamics.

<p>I'll skip the high school physics introduction to sound and waves, since 
most of the readers here probably remember more of that stuff than I do. 
However, the important thing to remember is that sound moves in waves. The 
canonical example of a sound wave is one that takes the form of a sine wave. 
That is, a wave that smoothly oscillates from peak to valley (there are many 
other possible wave forms, true sine waves rarely occur naturally). The 
frequency at which that sine wave propagates is 
called <em>fundamental</em> or, in musical terms, the <em>tonic note</em>. 
While very important, sound that only consists of the fundamental frequency 
can fatigue the ear quickly. Additional frequencies that are even multiples of 
the fundamental make the final tone more complex and interesting. These 
additional frequencies are called <em>harmonics</em> and they interfere 
with the fundamental to produce a more complex wave form.

<p>With this small bit of phyics and the Audio::WAV module, you can produce
wave files of any tone you want. By extending the code shown here, your scripts
can write out entire songs in glorius 16-bit, 44100hz WAV files. The key is
to understand how to use Audio::WAV to write out audio information.

<p>Because this is such a new module (it's only up to 0.2), the documentation 
is a little underpowered. However the core of what you need is there. 
The Audio::WAV class has two child classes it uses to read and write WAV 
files (called Audio::WAV::Read and Audio::WAV::Write respectively). Instead
of directly instantiating an Audio::WAV::Write object, Audio::WAV has a 
write() method that returns a new Audio::WAV::Write object. For instance:

<pre>
my $wav = Audio::Wav->new;
my $write = $wav->write($outfile, 
			{ 
			 bits_sample => $bits_sample,
			 sample_rate => $sample_rate,
			 channels    => 1,
			}
		       );
</pre>

<p>Audio::WAV::Write also has a write() method, but it expects to be passed 
at least one point of wave data to write out to the appropriate file. 

<pre>
  $write->write( sin($pi * $time) * $max_no );
</pre>

<p><i>(note: the documentation claims that write() can take an array of 
samples, but that only produced empty 46 byte WAV files for me.)</i>

<p>Although it seems simple enough to feed write() random numbers, the trick 
is in understanding how to generate meaning data (isn't that always the way). 
This discussion is limited to talking about sine waves since that does not 
exceed my mathematical acumen.

<p>Like the graph of a sine wave made by an eighth-grader, the WAV file 
consists of points that represent the wave's amplitude at a given point in 
time (it's a bit more complicated than that, but the Audio::WAV module 
lets me work at this level). Successive calls to write() place a new 
point on this imaginary graph at the next available time slot (see below 
for an explaination of how time is subdivided along this "X-axis" of time). 
Once the maximum and minimum values for wave's amplitude are know, 
it's a very simple math problem to determine the appropriate "y value."

<pre>
y = sin(PI * x) # if you have an X value, find Y
</pre>

<p>In this case, the X value is going to be a slice of time which is 
determined by both the frequency of the fundamental and the sampling rate
of the WAV file. The higher the sampling rate, the more X values are produced.
But, how many time slices (that is divisions of the X-axis) are needed? 
This is a function of how many seconds you want the sound to last times 
the sampling rate.

<pre>
number of X-axis divisions = seconds * sample rate
</pre>

The value of each X-axis point is:

<pre>
X-axis value = (X-axis offset/sample rate) * hertz
</pre>

<p>Now we're getting somewhere! You can approximate PI with (22/7) and now
you know your X-axis values. You only need to know the range of allowable 
amplitudes for this wave file to determine valid Y-values. Recall that sound 
wave amplitude is perceived as loudness by human ears. It turns out that the 
amplitude is governed by the bit resolution of the WAV file. 

<pre>
max_amplitude = (2 ** bit resolution) / 2
</pre>

<p>Why are we raising 2 by the power of the bit resolution? For the same 
reason that you set your video card to the highest video resolution. The 
more bits, the more graduation. I assume that WAV files allocate the number
of bits designated by the bit resolution for each sample of sound to represent 
the amplitude of the wave file at that time. The result is divided by two 
because the wave has positive and negative peaks. In effect, it's like 
the number is signed (in fact, it may be in the WAV file).

<p>Putting this mess together, the amplitude of the wave at a given sample 
is found like this:

<pre>
current amplitude  = sin(PI * x-axis value) * max amplitude
</pre>

<p>Because sin() produces a number between 1 and -1, the amplitude will either
be at the maximum amplitude or smaller. By added a scalar to the maximum 
amplitude, you can control the volume of the samples too. In Perl code, 
producing each point on the sine wave is done like this:

<pre>
for my $pos (0..$len) {
  my $time = ($pos/$sample_rate) * $hertz;
  $write->write( sin($pi * $time) * $max_no );
}
</pre>

<p>This code produces a sine wave with only the fundamental frequency. 
If you wanted to add the second harmonic to this wave, simply double the 
hertz value every other iteration.

<pre>
for my $pos (0..$len) {
  my $hz = $hertz;

  if ($pos % 2 == 1) {
    $hz *= 2;
  }

  my $time = ($pos/$sample_rate) * $hz;
  $write->write( sin($pi * $time) * $max_no );
}
</pre>

<p>It's easy enough to generalize this code to support any harmonic. I thought
it would be fun to add an arbitrary number of harmonics to the fundamental.

<pre>
my $next = 0;
for my $pos (0..$len) {
  my $hz = $hertz;

  # throw in some harmonics, but keep the tonic dominate
  if ($pos % 2 == 1) {
    $hz *= $harmonics->[$next++];
  }
  $next = 0 if $next >= @{$harmonics};

  my $time = ($pos/$sample_rate) * $hz;

  $write->write( sin($pi * $time) * $max_no );
}
</pre>

<p>Notice that the fundamental is represented at least as often as any 
additional harmonic. The more harmonics are added, the more the fundamental
dominates. This may not be entirely what you want, but at least you now 
have some place to start tinkering. 

<p>Wouldn't it be great if someone wrapped this into an easy to use perl 
script? You bet it would be!

<p>Next time, I'll look at managing the wave forms better to produced 
rudimentary FM synthesis. Together with Perl's ability to read MIDI files, 
you can turn existing MIDI files into "fully realized" WAV files without
using a sound card!

<p>Zen thought for the day: If a WAV file is produced on a machine without 
a sound card, is there any way to tell if the program worked correctly?

<h2>Some ideas</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ethan/">ethan</a> on 2002-12-16T03:46:25</h3>
Not that I am a particular friend of it, but there have always been some attempts in aleatoric music. Using audio (as opposed to MIDI) for it has some advantages due to its rather analog character: Deduce some metrics from a piece of Perl-code and turn it into a wav file. The resulting sounds (read: noises) let you decide which code is the one with the most musicality in it.<br> <br>Perhaps some of the outcomes can serve as usable samples (drum samples contain a lot of noise): You sample CGI.pm, Parse::RecDescent and two other suitable modules and thus create a Perl-drumset.



<h2>Some fan-boy you are...</h2>
