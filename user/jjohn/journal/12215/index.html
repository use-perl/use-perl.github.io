<p><p>Both because I'm pressed for time and this trick appeared somewhat popular before, here again is a bulleted list of opinion barfing on current issues.
<ul>

   <li><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3025673.stm"><b>Dems walk out of Texas gov't</b></a>.  When I first heard about this I thought "finally, the democrats are getting a backbone and standing up to the wave of fascism sweeping America." Then I learnt that they were protesting <i>jerrymander</i>, that is prejudicial redistricting likely to insure a Republican landslide come next election.  Now I'm no fan of jerrymandering (even though the term comes from the Great State of Massachusetts), but   it's bloody disheartening to find that to these clods the only issue worth fighting for is their  worthless little jobs.  Poor leadership writ large.  What about the millions of Americans jobless for past 3 years?  Where's the sense of outrage there?  Or for the poor bastards whose retirement plans evaporate in the huge corporate  scandals of 2001-2002?  Churchhill was right; democracy is the worst form of government, save for all the others.  Texas dems, stop your cowering and take your ousters like adults.  If you had only shown some "true grit" these past few years, you might be in a better position to survive redistricting.

<li><b><i>Matrix: Reloaded</i> and <i>X-Men 2</i> open</b>.  Big deal.  Real life is so fictional at this point, History channel documentaries are escapist.  Free tip for Hollywood:  computer FX don't replace plot.  
 
<li><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/3029929.stm"><b>Israeli tanks roll into Gaza</b></a>.  This happens during the anniversary of "Catastrophe day," when the Palestinians were displaced by the creation of Israel.  Talk about history repeating itself! 

<li><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3029761.stm"><b>Car bombing in Saudi Arabia</b></a>.  Who the hell didn't see this coming?  Didn't the terrorists get a copy of the Roadmap to Peace?  George's war didn't really cool the tensions in the Mid-East much, nor did it make Americans safer.  Hell, it didn't make Arabs safer either.  As many Saudis died in the attack as Americans.  Good shotin', al-Qaeda.  Are you guys still on the US payroll?  In any case, the war cost $75 billion dollars, so that's nice.  That Roadmap is looking mighty dog-earred. 

<li><b><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/3029963.stm">Japan boosts military</a> while <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/3029677.stm">Germany economy tanks</a></b>.  It's starting to look like World War II again.  Talk about history repeating itself!

 <li><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3026741.stm"><b>Tastless 9-11 art</b></a>.  In the spirit of a yellow traffic sign, some schmuck in NYC painted a sign on a building's wall near Ground Zero that cautioned "low flying planes."  I found this marginally funny, but the artist backpeddled and thus lost cred in my eyes.  We are a nation that likes tasteless humor, just watch any sitcom on network TV.  Hell, watch any movie with Adam Sandler.  However, humor is a healing agent for loss.  It's time the US got on with it's life and stopped being so bloody angry at the world for not enjoying its supreme power.  9-11 sucked. Sucked donkey balls.  Wouldn't want to see that happen again.  Now, bring on the court jesters!  The US is the richest and most comprehensively armed nation in the world, past or present.   Think back to high school.  Didn't you secretly want to dump a vat of pig's blood on the most popular kids at the prom?  Think of al-Qaeda as an overactive Carrie.  More suppression isn't likely to bring peace, unless what you're looking for is the brutality of pax romana. 

<li><b>George Bush ignores domestic issues.</b> Besides the systemic stripping of personal liberties undertaken by Ashcroft and turning a blind eye to ruinous patent laws, Bush appears to be hoping we'll forget about those corporate thieves and liars who stole billions of dollars from investors and employees alike.  Oh, that tax cut is insane and will bare maggot-laden fruit should that over-privileged, monomanical oil-monkey get elected again in 2004.  That assumes that elections will be held at all, of course.
 
<li><b>The Democrat contenders for 2004 are the most  wan and anemic collection of washed-up political hacks I've seen in at least 4 years.</b>  Can we get Tony Blair to run for office over here?  At least he plays the part of "world leader" convincingly. 
</ul>

<p>You got a problem with this?  Comment away. 

<p><b>Update:</b> 
Dems won't even take Bush to task over <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A1155-2003May16.html">the failure to find WMD in Iraq</A>.  I knew that the Constitution requires presidents to be at least 45 years old.  I guess I thought it was implicitly understood that candidates must also be <b>vertebrates</b>.  My bad.</p>

Take Blair. Really. Perhaps we'll get someone with priniciples if he goes.

I wouldn't be thrilled with taking Blair, but I guess if the choice were between him and Dubya I'd have to do it.  I still have moderately positive feelings toward Blair because I was in London on 2001-09-11 and it was good to have someone on TV being a leader while Bush was still flying around wildly and incommunicado.

<h2>Some notes</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/pudge/">pudge</a> on 2003-05-20T23:35:01</h3>
The Democrats in Texas also lost a lot of credibility by *breaking the law* to protest something they thought was wrong.  As you said, if it was standing up for someone else, this could perhaps be excusable.  But it wasn't.  The Republicans look pretty bad on this too, though, but probably not as bad.<br> <br>I have not the slightest problem with the tax cut.  Very few economists are saying there is any problem whatsoever with cutting taxes.  The problem is not tax cuts, but deficits.  If we cut taxes, we need to cut spending too.  We're not doing it.  And this is the same with both parties; the Democrats were not proposing any spending cuts, so no matter how you look at it, in either party, we are faced with the same real problem: a large deficit.<br> <br>The real point of the weapons, stated for six months, was not that Iraq HAS weapons, but that Iraq was not fulfilling its obligation to PROVE it has no weapons.  Of course, Bush did say Iraq had weapons, but more often Bush and his adminisration talked about the lack of cooperating, not the existence of weapons.<br> <br>On top of that, less than half of the suspected sites have been searched, we are still interrogating the people we've recently captured who have the information we want (apparently); and on top of that, we HAVE found at least one mobile biological weapons lab.<br>And the age is not 45 for President, but 35.  Also 30 for Senate, 25 for House.
