<p><p>Halloween was favorite holiday for many, many years.  It was the one holiday devoted to mischef and chaos.  A time when the boring, gray 
interactions of daily life were eschewed for something vaguely akin to that 
old Star Trek episode in which the disciplined citizens of an alien town ran 
amok shouting "Festival! Festival!"  I liked the costumes.  I liked the 
pumkins.  I liked the candy.  I even like the television programming.  
Periodic rumors of devil worshippers and the razor-hiding apples only made 
the night more bizaare and attractive.
<p>In the Lew Black concert that I recently attended, the infamously irrated 
comic dispaged the traditions of this holiday.  He noted that those who carve
more than one pumpkin have clearly failed to notice the ungodly stench of the
squash.  He spewed some bile over adults who dress up on Halloween, noting 
that it's a kid's holiday.  While Black's positions were exaggerated for 
comedy, I find that I'm in harmony with his sentiments. 
<p>My spooky-time traditions have dwindled to reading a few H. P. Lovecraft 
stories and a bit of E. A. Poe.  If I think of it, I watch /Evil Dead II/ 
or an old Vinny Price flick from the sixties. 
<p>Halloween has lost its magical sheen over the years.  I don't 
go to many Halloween parties and I don't really want to disguise myself 
as a pirate, a clown or Wookie.  Even the much-beloved town of Salem can't
rekindle this old flame.  Halloween has become just another hook to yank 
money of our wallets.  It short, it seems that Halloween has become 
respectable and in so doing as lots much of what made the day fun.  And that 
is the scariest trick of them all.
