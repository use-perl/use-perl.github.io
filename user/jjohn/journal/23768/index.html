<p><blockquote>
&laquo;The US Defence Secretary, Donald Rumsfeld, has blamed the inability to gain permission to invade Iraq through Turkey for the power of the insurgency that the US now faces.

<p>Mr Rumsfeld said in television appearances marking the second anniversary of the invasion that Iraqi military and intelligence forces in the north of the country melted away to form the insurgency that is now battling US and Iraqi troops.

<p>At least 1520 members of the US military have died since the beginning of the Iraq war, according to an Associated Press count.

<p>Ok everybody! In the key of E, let's all sing it together:

<pre>
Blame Turkey, man! 
Blame Turkey, man!
With their shaky parliament 
and their queer imprisonment

Blame Turkey, man!
Blame Turkey, man!
'Cause Ataturk was drunk.
the Republic almost sunk.

Blame Turkey, man!
Blame Turkey, man!
their coffee tastes too strong
and elections take too long

Blame Turkey, man!
Shame on Turkey, man!

In line they must fall
or the EU just might stall
and listen to the Kurds
who say the Turks are turds

We must blame them and cause a fuss
before someone thinks of blame us!
</pre></p>

<h2>Blame</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/pudge/">pudge</a> on 2005-03-30T17:51:09</h3>
Well, Turkey is partially to blame.  It made the invasion less successful than it could have been.<br> <br>My question -- I watch the Sunday shows and heard him say it at the time -- was, why bring that up now?  I can only assume that we're trying to put some pressure on Turkey for something.  That's how these things work.  We're not blaming Turkey to make us look good or because it is true, but because we want to accomplish something by blaming them.  I just can't figure out what.
