<p> on  the  laptop  on  the  code  ...<p>  That's  the  first kook  Amazon  review.	Someone  named	Kevin  in  the 
wild...  XML  solves  all  of  the  contracts  we  were 
reading  books	and  become  a	medium	sized  database 
generated  3550  lines	of  Perl  6  BOF  tonight  was	a 
bit  of  reality:  <blockquote><i> That said, I don't claim
that C++ is perfect. There is a lot of really horrible C++
code out there, because many programmers haven't learned to
use C++ well. I encourage people to look at my home pages,
papers and books for ideas about how to improve their code.
My impression is that most C++ code could have been much
cleaner, maintainable and efficient than it is had the
designers and programmers understood up-to-date C++
features and techniques. Standard C++ really does make
possible programming techniques that were infeasible ten
years ago. Unfortunately, many are constrained or feel
constrained to use C++ as it stood ten years ago, or they
simply use it as a better C. <p> LJ: How do you feel now,
knowing that millions of people work using the tool you
created? <p> BS: I'm very pleased, but as I said, I wish
they'd do themselves a favor by using it better.

that  the  URL	are  Eastern  time,  dag  nabbit.)  <p>It's

clear  it  up  to  a  local  fix  being  evaluated  for

 surprisingly  easy  to  see  what's  involved	in  playing

That blockquote in the middle had too much contiguous coherent content. Is your Markov on the fritz?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

Not a bug.  Quotes and code are preserved.  That's what makes the funny.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)
