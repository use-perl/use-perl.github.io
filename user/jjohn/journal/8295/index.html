<p><p>To say that IT is in the doldrums is like saying Hilter was a little moody. Frankly, I'm a bit bored and unimpressed with the much of the stuff I see on Freshmeat. It seems that a full 50% of the new submissions are CMS/Blogger programs. Cringely hasn't mentioned anything worth repeating. Now I reach out to you, the use.perl community.

<p>What new technology are you learning or would like to learn more about? Got a bee in your bonnet about something? I want to know. Comment away!
<p><b>UPDATED:</b> hmm. No takers, eh? That's what I thought. :-D

<h2>Gauntlet thrown</h2>

I'm interested in Jabber.<br> <br>At first I thought it was hokey. Anyone else remember that Jabber thingy at TPC in Monterrey (1999 I think)?<br> <br>After reading more about it in articles and _Programming with Jabber_ I think it is kind of cool. As interesting as Groove is I think Jabber can be comparable to Groove as well as other IM clients and servers.<br> <br>My idea is to use it for help desk/ticket tracking sort of thing. Something for my users (students, faculty, and staff) to submit problems. Maybe I'm on crack to give so much access to my time but that's sort of my job. Anything that might allow me to pull more information from them would be great.<br> <br>Just an idle scratch I haven't yet itched.



<h2>What about embedded stuff?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/johanvdb/">johanvdb</a> on 2002-10-11T11:55:55</h3>
I have the feeling that most people who want to develop something choose an application that they are familiar with.  <br> <br>CMS/Blog stuff is highly debated and used a lot. Implementation details are easily found on the web. Practices used to implement those engines are widely known and tested.<br> <br>Look at the amount of hobby Operating Systems that were developed some years ago. <br> <br>It is all just copycat coding<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)<br> <br>For what it is worth, I've jumped on the embedded software engineering and electronics bandwagon. Although this market also seems to be on a downwards spiral, custom electronics and system integration with embedded (smart) devices will become more usefull for small companies (automation of the work floor, coupling between production machines and accounting)<br> <br>Regards!<br>Johanvdb <br> <br>



<h2>BEEP</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Fletch/">Fletch</a> on 2002-10-11T14:15:33</h3>
<p>
I'd started looking at <a href="http://beepcore.org/" title="beepcore.org">BEEP</a beepcore.org>, even got the ORA book on it.  It looks interesting, but every time I think about the fact that it uses XML down in the guts of the transport the more the little voice in the back of my head whispers "<i>The horror . . . The horror . .<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.</i>".

<h2>What schwings me on</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/gnat/">gnat</a> on 2002-10-11T18:25:51</h3>
The Mac.  Unix on the desktop and it doesn't suck.  I love it to pieces.<p>

Rendezvous.  The ability to advertise and discover services like instant messaging, file sharing, web servers, etc. via DNS is sweet.  It's awesome at conferences to fire up iChat and see everyone in the audience listed, and be able to chat with them.</p><p>

Perl.  Damn I love this language.  It's so useful and so easy.  I'm still in love after all these years.  Learning Objective C after learning Perl is like being sodomized by Jabba the Hut after you french kissed Lara Croft.</p><p>

The DRM/DMCA/CBDTPA fight.  I think it has the greatest ignorance:importance ratio of anything going on in technology.</p><p>

If I had to be a boring predictor, I'd say that Apache 2 will sink or swim in 2003.</p><p>

<p>I'm interested in Apache2 because modules will now have almost socket level access to the communication going on between apache and the client. This means that Apache can service other protocols besides HTTP. Will apache become THE server of the future? I dunno, but it presents some interesting possibilities.

</p><p>I forgot about Rendezous. That is very interesting. I always thought someone would hack up DNS for more interesting uses.

</p><p>MacOS X, while very cool, isn't too interesting to me. It's Unix and that's not new, even on the desktop (that's right, I'm a cranky old linux user). I am interested to see how the application market takes to it. I'd love to see Apple take a bite out of Microsoft hegemony in the business place. I'd love to see MacOS X dominate the desktop world. Please don't construe this to mean that I trust Steve Jobs more than Bill Gates because I don't.

</p><p> <a href="http://www.upnp.org/" title="upnp.org">Universal Plug N Play</a upnp.org> is interesting because it's a web service that uses UDP (!). Broadcast protocol + web service = interest.

</p><p>Now that the hype of P2P is over, its time to see what the devil this architecture is good for.

</p><p>I'm still waiting for the death of PCs. Must we continue on through the 21st century with this beastly thing? Where are my cheap, embedded devices?

</p><p>Perl is good (and the perl5 branch is getting a very polished sheen), but for my own developement I've been looking at C again. Generally though, no programming language is very exciting to me -- the benefits to most of them aren't apparent to me.

</p><p>More network apps -- that's what I'm looking for.</p>

Stuart Cheshire, the Rendezvous guru, gave some nice bitchslaps to UPnP at a talk I saw.  Something along the lines of UPnP solves the easy problems clumsily and leaves the hard problems to the user.  I forget the details, I was too busy laughing at the time.<p>

I have a rant about p2p, web services, and digital identity in a buffer.
