<p><p>It's official -- I need more work.

<p>I left O'Reilly a year ago to pursue technical writing, lose weight
and generally goof off. I'm happy to report unprecedented success at 
that last goal. I did lose all the weight I set out to (put a 'W' in 
that column, but I didn't do much technical writing. The fun of technical 
writing for is in helping other people learn what I think is an interesting
technology or application. I confess that not much in this past year has 
seemed all that interesting.

<p>Web Services were somewhat of a bust. Although XML-RPC/SOAP are good 
tools to know, but there isn't much <em>there</em> there yet. This will 
change, I'm sure. For instance, I finally got around to creating a system 
that lets me write my 
<a href="http://use.perl.org/user/pudge/journal/8489">blogs</a> 
from emacs using Perl and SOAP. This is a case of scratching an itch. 
Generally, I fear lisp. I don't know that it does that much for a resume 
either. So I didn't do a lot with Web Services this year.

<p>P2P? I have hear of P3P, but I think the acronyms are driving the 
technology again. There seems to be a lot of security work available, 
but of course if I told you about it, I'd have to kill you. MacOS X 
has made a bit splash this year and that's pretty cool. Most of the
discussion about MacOS X involves explaining standard Unix hacks to 
macheads. Of course, there are some interesting network hacks from 
MacOS X like <a href="http://developer.apple.com/macosx/rendezvous/index.html">Rendezvous</A>. I need to look at Rendezvous more closely. Wireless 
tech is fun, but I have no use for it nor do I have the <em>skillz</em>
to pull off a wireless hack. WiFi is just another link layer to me. 
Let the hardware guys wet themselves over it.

<p>There's no need to comment on .Net.

<p>I doubt I'm the only one who feels underwhelmed with the state of 
technology today. The industry feels like it's 1989 all over again. 
I still enjoy working with computers and I want to continue programming, 
but it appears that I will have to fight harder than ever to remain
in this industry and that sort of makes me laugh. Sagging economy or 
no, IT is here to stay. Most companies still need to improve and streamline 
their information infrastructure because that will improve their bottom 
lines. But for today, I feel like a ship in doldrums -- rocking listlessly 
back and forth with no perceptible forward movement.

<p>Heave way, boys.

</p><p>I'm going to write up my hack for use.perl.org. I'm starting on the article tonight. I must warn you that my lisp code is a bit schlocky, but it does work. Also Chris just added a new API method, so I want to show that. Probably by the end of the week, you'll see the article appear. I'm glad to see there's some interest.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>
