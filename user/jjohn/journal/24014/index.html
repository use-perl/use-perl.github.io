<p>Good Lord, what a movie.  I feel like Frank Miller really tuned me up.  It only hurts when I laugh.</p>


<hr/>



<h2>I hated it</h2>

Nearly fell asleep.  Nearly walked out, but I had to keep watching to see if it'd get any better.
<p>
The "comic book" view grew old after about 10 minutes.  And the visuals were better than the plot, which was also dumb.
</p><p>
And then I felt ripped off, because apparently the middle third of the movie shifted to a "8 years earlier..." without having any indication that this is what happened.  The movie was so disjoint with characters anyway that it didn't seem odd (relatively) that all of a sudden we were just seeing different people.  C'mon.  That's hurting the viewer.
</p><p>
Nope, definitely dis-recommending this movie. Ugh.  Glad I saw it at cheap prices.</p>



<h2>Nope</h2>

Considering the person that Jessica Alba plays does that dance nude in the comic, that would have been the only reason to see it. Alas, she is clothed.
