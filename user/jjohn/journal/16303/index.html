<p><p><blockquote>&laquo;The old believe everything; the middle-aged suspect everything; 
the young know everything.&raquo;
</blockquote>
<p>--Oscar Wilde
<p>It's that time of year again: my birthday.  As kid, I was hardly 
containable on the eve of the twelfth.  December was a most excellent month 
for me.  With presents arriving roughly every fortnight and Christmas 
vacation to boot, 
December proved tough to beat.  However as an adult, which at 32 I mostly 
surely am (at least legally, if not morally), I have found this time of year 
to be the most
distressing by a wide margin.  Most of my close friends, who are numbered
parsimonously in the best of times, are all widely dispersed now.  Although 
I haven't been in a good relationship for too many years now, I find that 
I am thankful for not being in a bad one now.  Despite some weight gain, I'm 
still in good health.  Despite the terrible economy, I have found employment
and possibly something even better.  Although still learning the craft, I'm 
more confident than ever in my abilities as programmer and debugger.
<p>All in all, it could be a hell of lot worse.
<p>If this all seems a bit morbid for a birthday journal, please note that at 
the first high school party I attended (complete with cases of 
<a href="http://www.oldmilwaukee.com/">Old Milwaukee</a>, Bud Lite, and 
the bitterly ironic <em>Miller High Life</em>), my attempts to 
hit on a lass yeilded only the comment "you're a maudlin drunk!"  Nothing
wounds like the truth.
<p>However, I've gained nothing if not some insight into the nature of my 
particular mortal coil and I know part of me delights in the dark, the 
gloomy and the dramatic.  Which is exactly why I enjoy humor, the antithesis 
of serious (and mostly worthless) sentiment.  I am grateful that most of 
the barriers I now face in life of those of my own making.
<p>So, on your knees 32; I'm your Daddy now.

Happy Birthday, you old bastard.

I'll have a special something for you when I come down for the LOTR marathon on Tuesday.</p>
