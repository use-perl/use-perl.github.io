<p><a href="http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2004/02/04/police_planning_questioned/">Police planning questioned</a><blockquote>
&laquo;The Boston Police Department assigned only 43
crowd-control officers citywide to handle the thousands
of revelers that streamed into the streets after Sunday
night's Super Bowl, with just six assigned to the
Symphony Road area where a man was killed when an SUV
driver drove into a crowd near Northeastern University,
documents obtained by the Globe show.
<br><br>
The Police Deployment documents show that only one
supervisor and five officers were assigned specifically
to control the Symphony Road area, and another supervisor
and five officers were sent to Kenmore Square. In those
locations, mobs of some 5,000 people each swarmed the
streets after Sunday night's game and became unruly.
&raquo;
</blockquote>
<p>Both areas mentioned above are a five minute walk from my apartment.  
<p>I can confirm it was more than a little loud in the `hood last Sunday night
around midnight.  You would have thought that the fans themselves had won the 
Super Bowl and not the paid employees of a multimillion dollar franchise.  
Where I live, I get to see a lot of extreme sports fan behavior and it's 
neither pretty nor amusing.  Where are the riots over Super Tuesday?  Or NASA
debugging and repairing Spirit and Opportunity (a task not easily 
accomplished on Earth let alone another planet).  
<p>It's true that I'm not a regular  spectator of any sport, but I absolutely 
loathe those fans who use sporting events as a justification for their 
jackassery.  I hope that the fine Boston PD makes some pointed inquiries 
into yesterday's rally and Sunday's wanton chaos.  Homeland security starts at
home (with the crazy white guys).

<h2>Intriguing...</h2>

Again, I find it fascinating that all this news about Janet Jackson's breast is hitting the news, but yet there are no federal investigations into "Fan Killed After Sports Game."
<p>
Which is a greater tragedy?  A child watching tv seeing an exposed breast at a great distance (not even a close up), or someone dying after a sports game?</p>

Is there any evidence the Boston police can't handle the vehicular homicide case?  Why should the feds get involved there?<br> <br>On the other hand, the alternatives to the FCC handling the breast issue (I might want to rephrase that) are 1) every local jurisdiction deals with the local CBS affiliate according to "community standards", or 2) we give up on restricting TV content.  The latter appeals to my libertarian side, but isn't terribly realistic.<br>

<em>It's true that I'm not a regular spectator of any sport, but I absolutely loathe those fans who use sporting events as a justification for their jackassery.</em> <br> <br>Is it any worse than people who use New Year's, St. Patrick's Day, or a rock concert, etc. as a justification for theirs?  Not that I think you think it is<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... I'm just saying sports, for some people, is just a way to blow of steam, and like other events, some of those people take things way too far.<br> <br>Go Patriots!
