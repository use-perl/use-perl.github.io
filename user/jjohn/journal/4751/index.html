<p><p>A careful <a href="http://aliensaliensaliens.com">A3</a> reader pierced the thinly veiled metaphors of Zorknapp, Draco-Repitilians and NAZI MOON BASES to see the white supremacist agenda hidden within.

<p>His email message to A3 support let's us all know the jig is up.

<blockquote>
aliens? what is that supposed to mean, 
no on [sic] is of pure race, you arent [sic] pure, none of us are, 
being white makes you no better, if all you see is color, i feel sorry for you.
</blockquote> 

<p>To this careful reader, I say "congratulations." You may wish to turn that keen intellect of yours towards finding the plans hidden on every Capt'n Crunch box that detail Phaze 2: The Quickening. Trust no one.</p>

I just ran zorknapp.plx, didn't read the output, and pasted it in here.<br> <br> <i>Recently, Zorknapp was asked:</i> <br>I was watching those lovable Von Trapps the other night, and I just wondered, do you start rooting for the Nazis by the end?<br>Or is it just me?<br> <br> <i>To which Zorknapp replied:</i> <br>It's just you, you horrible, horrible person. Who could conceive of rooting for the Nazis, when they never even thought of sharing their rocket ships and moon bases with the rest of humanity?<br>



<h2>A3 as tool of the M.A.N.!</h2>

They have revealed A3 as just another example of TRICKNOLOGY!
Listen therefore to the sage words of the alien-rousting NATION OF ISLAM:

<blockquote><div>&laquo;Most fantastic is the story of Doctor Yacub. Yacub, according to
Nation lore, was born 20 miles from Mecca in the
year 8400BC. From childhood, he had a
rebellious streak and was eventually imprisoned
and then banished into exile. Leading 59,999 of
his disciples to the island of Pean in the Aegean
Sea, he grafted a new race from the germs of
black people. They had fur, were born with tails
and walked on all fours. They were white; and
they were devils. But they were not that bright
and so, in order to dominate black people, they
resorted to "tricknology".&raquo;<p>--<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,4231513,00.html" title="guardian.co.uk">"Profile of Louis Farrakhan:Chameleon in prophet's
robes "</a guardian.co.uk></p> </div></blockquote>
Elsewhere...
<blockquote><div>&laquo;Some of the Nation's core beliefs are downright
bizarre. They include the notion that black
people first colonised the earth 66 trillion years
ago and that white people were the result of a
failed genetic experiment by a demon scientist
6,000 years ago.

Farrakhan himself believes that he was offered
divine guidance, in the curious form of a trip in a
spaceship crewed by 19 celestial youths. In the
course of the flight, he received instructions from
Elijah Muhammad, one of his predecessors in the
movement.&raquo;<p>--<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,4279974,00.html" title="guardian.co.uk">"A nation expects"</a guardian.co.uk></p> </div></blockquote>
