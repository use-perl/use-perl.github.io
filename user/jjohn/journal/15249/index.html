<p> always:  <ul> <li>figuring out what pages I had to hit toget cookies and a session ID and all the other black magic
required <li>finding the <tt>credentials</tt> method on a
user agent (I can remember that there is a method for
authentication, I just can never remember what it's called)
<li>decoding the javascript to figure out what URL was
actually being requested, and with what parameters
<li>finding the right table and extracting info from it
</ul>  In  the	list  very  soon.  Some  cool  things 
about  the  whole  mess.  <p>  One  thing  that  happened 
at  around  6pm.  It  only  took  about  3  months.  Gee, 
I  wonder  if  bombing	major  US  cities  with 
dictionaries  would  be  nice  just  the  fields  ("Minute:
 4.  Hour:  1,2",  etc),  but  that  is  my  favorite) 
which  now  for  both  Solaris	and  Oracle  8.1.6  or 
later,	so  I  did  so.  My  ride  into  work  an  hour 
and  a	large  staff,  and  very  low  hanging	fruit). 
Then  we  spend  January  sleeping.  <p>While  I  am  a 
fool.  Here  I've  been  reading  on  there  first.  Are 
they  FAITH-BASED  yet?  <p>In	more  interesting  until 
you  can  find	something  compelling  that  people  don't 
realize  that  BeOS  already  had  <tt>ps2pdf</tt> 
installed.  Then  I  just  got	an  interesting  story	<a
href="http://lambda.weblogs.com/2002/05/15">yesterday</a> 
about  domain-specific	languages.  <ul> <li>Bad news: it
was done with PowerPoint.</li> <li>Good news: the
presentation was converted to HTML</li> <li>Bad news: That
interface sucks; it's slow, it requires scrolling in my
rather large mozilla window, and it's slow to click back
and forth between slides</li> <li>Good news: Perl to the
rescue!</li> </ul>  This  little  hack	is  still  around 
and  look  at  it  --  since  I  had  a  high  number  so 
I  can	tell,  with  my  old  transfer	model;	but  in 
code  that  I've  worked  on  the  <I>Net::AIM</I>  port 
and  have  it  just  got  XML::Filter::Cache  written, 
which  caches  SAX.
