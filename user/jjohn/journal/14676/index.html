<p>It appears that the rumors of <A href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/09/12/world/main572956.shtml">Iran's atomic weapons</a> program will not go away.  
<blockquote>
&laquo;The report, by IAEA head Mohamed ElBaradei, lists findings of traces of weapons-grade enriched uranium and other evidence that critics say point to a weapons program.<br>
<br>
"The United States believes the facts already established would fully justify an immediate finding of noncompliance by Iran," Brill said during a meeting of the agency's board. Still, he said, the Americans were ready to give "Iran a last chance to drop its evasions" before pushing for Security Council involvement.&raquo;
</blockquote>
<p>Setting aside the hypocracy of countries that have nukes restricting 
atomic weapons technology from those that do not, it seems that the US alone 
cannot afford to continue to use military force to stop every "rogue" state 
from getting The Bomb (even though I admit I'd sleep better at night knowing 
that nukes were in fewer hands).  It doesn't seem that Iran has nuclear 
weapons now, but if they have a clandestine Manhattan Project, one Israeli 
source suggests that they could have a working weapon in two or three years.  
I don't know if I believe that, but let's grant that that is true.  Is there 
a way to discourage nations from developing a nuclear weapons program?  
<p>One way to approach this question is to ask why any country wants nukes in 
the first place.  Nuclear weapons are expensive to make and expensive to 
maintain.  Because uranium decays, the weapons require 
<a href="http://www.house.gov/hasc/Publications/104thCongress/Reports/doerpt.pdf">constant monitoring and adjustment</a>.  
The care and feeding of the US atomic stockpile is expensive. While I can't 
find the exact numbers, the cost appears to be in the billions of dollars per 
year (I welcome pointers to more accurate information).  The report cited above
provides the answer to why the US has atomic weapons: deterrence.  Countries 
that have a credible atomic weapons program are perceived to be in less danger
of a first strike (conventional or atomic) from another country.  It helps to 
explain why the US is reluctent to use the same muscle in the North Korean 
affair than it did with Iraq.  The lesson many smaller countries have learned 
is that a credible weapons program will deter military invasion.  For another 
object lesson, look at how the tensions between Pakistan and India (who both 
have atomic weapons) manifest.  But this isn't the only lesson to be learned 
from current political events. 
<p>If your country's atomic weapons program is discovered before you have 
weapons, your are likely to be harassed or invaded, as Iran is experiencing.
You can debate whether the harassment is justified, but you cannot deny it is
happening.  Is the threat and use of military intervention to prevent nuclear 
weapons proliferation a tenable long-term policy for the US and UN?  I don't 
believe so.  The cost of rebuilding Iraq is more than the US wants sustain 
alone.  Imagine the cost of simultaneously rebuilding Iraq and Iran.  
Moreover at some future point, it simply won't be that difficult 
to get an atomics weapons program up and running.  The technology will 
continue to become cheaper and better understood.  The US won't have time to 
stop "rogue" regimes from getting nukes.  That's when the US will need to 
have to decide how far it will go to enforce it's policies.  Those promise to
be some very difficult days indeed.
<p>Deterrence isn't the only reason to have nukes, although it is probably the
most important one (certainly the late Dr. Teller would agree with this).  
Once you have nukes, your country is in a lot better position to negotiate 
with or extort from neighboring countries.  Again, North Korea's example of 
getting oil from the US in exchange for "stopping" their weapons program is 
an excellent example of this.  Another example is the US threatening to 
relatiate with atomic weapons if any form of WMD are used against it.
<p>It appears there's a lot of upside for any "rogue" country to develop nukes
as fast as possible.  The only way to effectively combat nuclear proliferation 
is to nullify its benefits.  Frankly, I'm at a loss as to how to do that.  
Although I do believe that most people in the world will respond with respect 
if shown the same, I'm also aware that there are those who only understand 
force (again, Saddam Hussein is a good example that this).  Should we extend 
ESR's notion that a universally armed citizenry promotes a "polite society?"  
If so, then giving nukes to <i>everybody</i> ought to easy world tensions.  
After all, you'd have to be mad to attack a country with nukes, right?  
Perhaps ESR's suggestion doesn't scale up well.
<p>I don't have a solution to stopping nuclear proliferation.  I'm trying to 
work out what I believe about this thorny, ugly problem.  Increasingly, US 
foreign policy seems to involve this issue.
<p>Your thoughts?

<h2>Force</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/pudge/">pudge</a> on 2003-09-16T23:15:19</h3>
Force comes in many forms.  One is military force, such as is used in Iraq.<br> <br>The other primary use of external force is what we are seeing in North Korea: political force.  You get all the major nuclear powers to condemn nuclear weapons in the hands of other nations, you get every neighbor to get together and force the issue.  If Russia, China, South Korea, and Japan align themselves against North Korea and its nuclear weapons, it really has little choice in the long run (this is why agreements with North Korea have failed, and why the Bush administration "waited" so long to talk to North Korea, because they were forcing North Korea into multilateral talks, as bilateral talks had failed to exert the political force required).<br> <br>And in Iran, we are hoping that internal forces can help solve the problem.  And it shows why -- in my view -- getting rid of Hussein was so important.  Not that Iraq was necessarily going to attack us, but Iraq was (as the UN Security Council said, over and over again), a threat to <em>regional stability</em>.  Without Hussein in Iraq, we have more of a chance of Iran solving its own problems.  Without Hussein in Iraq, we can isolate Syria, to better exert political pressure on it.  Without Hussein in Iraq, we can deal more directly with Saudi Arabia's "issues."<br> <br>Not to get off on a thing about Iraq, because that isn't what this is about, but I think the problem of proliferation is complex and that one of the most important ways of dealing with it is putting yourself in a position to deal with it.  I think the problem of nuclear proliferation is similar to the problem of terrorism.  You cannot stop it with brute force, as you say.  You need to help shape the world such that it is impractical or undesirable or unnecessary, and the various solutions are not always direct, and often differ depending on circumstances.<br>
