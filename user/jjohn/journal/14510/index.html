<p>The late Filthy Critic didn't think highly of <a href="http://www.bigempire.com/filthy/thematrix.html">The Matrix</a>.  The movie 
was fun to watch, but the plot was painfully familiar.  What bugs me about Matrix is 
that the dystopia that ensues doesn't appear to be tightly coupled to the decisions 
of mankind, which at least the Terminator series weakly attempts to do.  Perhaps the 
third Matrix installation will shed some light on some "invisible hand" that set the 
machines in motion. 
<p>It would be great if that movie fingered Larry Ellison as the culprit.  
Or Darl McBride.  Since <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0158983/">Bigger, 
Longer and Uncut</a>, Bill Gates has become passe as a villian.

Definitely. In fact, to tie in the Terminator, I think The Second Renaissance, Part 2 (TSR:2) is what T3 (if not T2) should have been movie-wise. I want to see the battle between man and machine. They've had such interesting snippets in the Terminator series (especially in T2), but TSR:2 really made me feel it. Heck, The Animatrix was tons better than 'Reloaded. Maybe because anime somehow feels like reading to me. When I watch anime I "read" more into it and imagine more.<br> <br>In any case see The Animatrix to see some cool back story stuff (like The Last Flight of the Osiris). I do however think it's bad to see this to understand what is going on in the movies. In fact I think there is some some in Enter the Matric (the video game) that explains more of the movie.<br> <br>I think this tie-in-exploitation thing really bugs me and takes some of the shine off of what the Wachowskis had with The Matrix.
