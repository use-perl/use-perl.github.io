A spokesman for Afghanistan's foreign ministry says it is premature to judge whether or not there has been a cover-up, as investigations are still ongoing, but warned there should be no cover-up from any side. 
<br><br>
He said the Afghan Government is continuing to look into the matter, and says it is taking the allegations that women's hands were forcibly tied very seriously.

<p>Is this just more anti-US slander? I hope so. In less political news:
<p><blockquote><i>
"You can invest a little money in far-out projects if they have some chance of success - it's called Pascal's Wager. In this case, most scientists would say there is zero chance of success." 
</i></blockquote>
<p>--BBC: <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/692968.stm">Gravity research gets off the ground</a>

<p>This is a very curious use of the term "Pascal's Wager," which is the cynically practice of worshipping God because there are only benefits to doing so and no upside to not. Let's hope antigravic
tech becomes viable soon. I want 
my own spaceship. </p>

<h2>Pascal's wager</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/rafael/">rafael</a> on 2002-07-29T13:02:35</h3>
Pascal was anything but a cynic ! He made this argument to convince people to go to church -- esp.
his gambler friends.
<p>Besides this, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/2157975.stm" title="bbc.co.uk">Boeing</a bbc.co.uk> is also interested in gravity. Probably some new kind of
hype.</p>

<h2>Regarding Afghanistan</h2>

I happened to catch a BBC report of it this morning (one of the local channels shows BBC from time to time).  I really hope this isn't a cover-up.
<p>
For quite a while now the U.S. Military has been pretty good about admitting its mistakes.  I wonder what's up with this one.  Anyway, I think we're getting to the point where it's time for the U.S. to pull out.  I'm not sure what we can accomplish militarily any longer.</p>

</p><p>An ugly, cynical person might suggest that the War on Terror legitimizes the dubious Dubya adminstration, which seems unable to cope with domestic issues like the economy, education, the environment or even <a href="http://216.239.51.100/search?q=cache:QpvyS0g_4egC:www.cnn.com/2002/ALLPOLITICS/06/26/homeland.security.reut/+Bush+checks+and+balances&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8" title="216.239.51.100">legitimate political opposition</a 216.239.51.100>.

</p><p>Of course, I'd never suggest that.
