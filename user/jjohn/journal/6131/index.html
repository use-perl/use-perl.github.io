<div class="span8">
<p><p>Since my access to the Internet was infrequent and brief
during YAPC, I'll bundle the whole story up here. One note:
I've been reading P. G. Wodehouse so this journal entry
is noticably more florid than others. Consider yourself
warned.

<p>I left by train on Monday, June 24 from Boston's South
Station.  Security continues to be lax on trains, which
means that my trip began on time. Recall that Amtrack
was in the throes of a financial crisis that threatened
to shut down unspecified routes later that week. Still,
I like to tackle one problem at a time and getting to
St. Louis was at the top of my queue that day.  Besides,
I had a room in the sleeper car so life was good.

<p>A word here is appropriate on how ineffably cool a room
in the sleeper car is. You get your own room with a door,
two beds and shades so that you can completely isolate
yourself from the rest of the car. Each room even has
its own toilet. BOO-YA! The sleeper car is off-limits to
coach passengers and, more importantly, their pint-sized,
retilin-starved banshee-terror offspring (here's a tip
from your old Uncle Joe: elitism isn't so distasteful when
one is part of the elite).  All sleeper car passengers
get free meals and get to eat in the diner car first
(a somewhat dubious honor). Most importantly, there is a
120V AC outline in the room and a very comfortable table
on which to work. If I had brought a laptop, I could have
done a fair bit of work. Of course, I would have missed the
spectacular scenary of upstate New York and Ohio. In short,
travel in the sleeper car will rock you like a hurricane.

<p>I mentioned in a previous journal that train travel is a
throwback to the nineteenth century. It's a kind of protest
to the fast-food society of today that demands people work
on the same 24-hour-a-day schedule that machines can. In
fact, many of the folks I met on the train seem to feel
the same way (including someone who is an employee of
American Airlines). One of the features of train trips in
the early nineteenth century was shotting wild buffulo
that came within range of the rails. Oddly enough, my
train passed a buffulo farm in New York. Unfortunately,
the porter refused my strident requests for a Winchester
and a handful of shells.

<p>I arrived in Chicago at 11 AM on Tuesday. The heavy gray
sky shook with the rumors of thunder, so I stay fairly
close to Union Station while I waited for the St. Louis
train to depart. I did see the famed Sear's Tower and
walked over one of the bridges that crosses the Chicago
river.  I would like to have seen the lake front park that
was just a few blocks East of Union Station. Next time.

<p>I traveled in coach to St. Louis on a train called the
Texas Eagle, a route that is notoriously late due to the
passive-aggressive behavior of Union Pacific, the freight
carrier that owns the lines on which the Texas Eagle
runs. On this leg of the trip, I met two lovely Perl Monks,
whose names escape me but whose faces do not, also going
to YAPC. Sadly, I don't think I took their picture, being
short on wits as I am. We arrived in St. Louis under the
cover of night and proceeded to the Holiday Inn, where
our two parties had reservations.

<p>After breakfast at the hotel I took a taxi to Washington
University, whose campus was very clean and inviting
despite construction crews that were busy demolishing
the walkways closest to YAPC. I registered and took my
seat for Larry's talk, although I didn't stay through
the whole thing. I gather the talk was well received, but
I'm afraid I've exceeded my quota of Hobbits and Orcs for
this year. I do endorse and embrace valid point Larry was
making about the Perl community's need to accept the wildly
divergent personalities it comprises. Instead, I took that
time to catch up with Elaine Ashton. The campus and the
day were too bucolic to ignore. I went to a few talks,
like Jos's POE primer, but I mainly played the part of
a Chatty Kathy. The day ended with Elaine, Jarkko, Gnat,
Schwern and I making inappropriate gestures and suggestions
to a local ATM machine while Forest Park residents passed
by in horror. Yes, I do have film footage of this that I
will post on Taskboy.com.  Ah, the joys of tourism!

<p>Thrusday was a bit of blur. I was incidently present
at the filming of Gnat's masterpiece, but I had no
part to play. This might have been a blessing, in some
ways. Perhaps next year. I believe this was the day
Mark-Jason Dominus gave his "Conference Judo" talk. MJD
has lifted the coins from my eyes about how I should be
presenting my talks. I've already got a few ideas for next
year (he said twirling his mustache).

<p>Allison Randal emerged as this year's Most Upwardly Mobile
Perler. Her talk on Topicalizers demonstrated her grasp
of Perl6 concepts and her Dr. Suess poem showed her wit
and poise. We will surely be seeing more of her in future
conferences and none could be more pleased about that
than I. She's smart and ease on the eyes, what's not to like?

<p>That night, members of #perl were treated to the
pulse-pounding action of that ax-wielding majesty that
is my acoustic guitar playing. Me and the boys, Pudge,
Gnat, Schuyler, MJD, and Silent Bob the Bass Player, all
rocked out successfully to classic tunes from the Beatles,
David Bowie, Wierd Al, and The Tokens. I attribute our
unprecedent success to my beautiful rock hair, but others
think the crowd simply wasn't playing attention. In any
case, WE LOVE YOU, ST. LOUIS! THANK YOU (|siv|)!

<p>By Friday, the abbreviated sleep that normally attends
conferences with me, began to slow me down. I recall
Pudge's wonderful Mac::Perl talk. Strangely, the most
lasting urge I have from it is to buy an iBook. I gots
to gets me that Phat Mac, bee-yatch! Damian's talk was
great. I actually remembered enough high school physics so
that I didn't get lost in his talk. Still, his crazy O(0)
loops are chicanery, but I'm uncertain of the mechanism.
Abigail suspects input filters as do I. That's a standard
Damain trick.

<p>That night, I had diner with a crowd of Canadian Perl
Monks. Lot's of fun bashing US politics. It's an easy
target made easier by beer. I turned in early that night.

<p>On Saturday, I visited the Gateway Arch, so that I could
fulfill my requirements as a tourist. I then took public
transit back to Forest Park and meandered through the art
museum and Zoo there. That's one groovy park!

<p>Sometime during this trip, I had the earthly delight known
as a Krispy Kreme chocolate frosted donut. As efficacious
as crack cocaine, these pastries of power can cure the
blind, teach the dumb to speak and perhaps even raise
the dead.  Great oogly moogly were those <b>good donuts</b>!

<p>On Sunday, I began my trip home, which was marred by
yelping children and frentic teenagers. The Cafe car's
selling out of hot dogs didn't help either.  There was
one bright spot. On one of my many wanderings through
the train, I was walking through a car during a prolonged
period of "turbulence."  Naturally, moved like a marionette
with tangled strings. When I passed the last row of seats
on my way out, a zoftig, ebullient Southern woman asked
"having trouble walking?" and then proceeded to slap
my behind.

<p>That's what I love St. Louis -- good people.

<p>If you thought Krispy Kreme was good, come to Texas and try Shipley's!</p>

<p>Whoops, I think I just started a flame war. &nbsp;:)</p>

Everyone knows that Krispy Kreme is good.  But there really aren't any here in ABQ.  But now there's a Shipley's just down the block from me.  But it's SO GOOD that I somehow thought it must be a hallucination, since nothing could be that good, and also be real.
<p>I think I should just move into the Shipley's.
</p><p>Unhappily, they aren't open at all hours like Dunkin Donuts is, so when I REQUIRE donuts at midnight, Shipley's can't help.</p>

<p>Woohoo!  Another Shipley's fan!  If you weren't already a friend, I'd mark you as one right now!</p>

<p>Personally I don't think Kripsy Kreme holds a candle to Shipley's.  KK moved in here about four years ago, and everyone was so excited, but when I tried one it didn't seem near as good as the Shipley's donuts I grew up on.  Shipley's puts unflavored gelatin in their donuts, which gives them a real melt-in-your-mouth texture.</p>

<p>Viva la Shipley's!  A shame about the limited hours, though.</p>

So that's why the train cost you more than flying -- you got a sleeper cabin!  Common folk like me just get duct-taped to the bottom of the train.

Yup. I travel coach for day trips. Anything requiring an overnight requires me to spend money. I'm not sorry I did either. It rocked.
