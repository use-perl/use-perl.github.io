The Bush Whitehouse has serious people in it, like Chaney, Powell, Rumsfeld and Rice.  I think they compare quite favorably to the angry twenty-somethings and political hacks (Ron Brown, for example) that populated the Clinton Whitehouse.  Lloyd Bentsen, Clinton's first Secretary of Treasury,  was a serious person, but he reportedly was upset at not being taken seriously enough by the Clinton Whitehouse which led to his leaving.</p>

<p>Surely three years is long enough to find out how the Electoral College works.  It's been around for two-hundred years; its workings really shouldn't have been a surprise to anyone eligible to vote.</p>

Hi, Chromatic!

<p>It's not the electoral college that was at fault. Gore received more votes in Florida (despite the undercouting of poor people's votes due to poor and confusing technology, and despite the GOP's illegally stripping the right to vote from tens of thousands of citizens -- those being the only two reasons that the count was even close).

</p><p>And <a href="http://democrats.com/display.cfm?id=181" title="democrats.com">this shouldn't be a surprise to anyone who bothered to follow the news</a democrats.com>.

</p><p>But the GOP delights in blaming the voters themselves as being "stupid"... when in fact the simple act of voters following the instructions they were given, in just one county, cost Gore the Presidency:

</p><blockquote><div>

<p>
In Duval County, which includes Jacksonville in the northeast corner of the state, a remarkable 21,855 ballots were invalidated because voters chose more than one presidential candidate. The county's official sample ballot erroneously instructed voters to "vote all pages." With 10 presidential candidates spread across two pages, following that instruction produced an overvote.

</p><p>Of those voters who made the mistake of voting once on each page, the study found that 7,794 voted for Gore (plus another candidate), while 4,705 voted for Bush (plus another). That's a potential net for Gore of 3,089 votes, enough to carry the entire state.

</p><p> <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/sns-ballots.story" title="chicagotribune.com">http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/sns-ballots.story</a chicagotribune.com></p>

</div></blockquote>

<p>That's why people refer to the 2000 debacle as an "election," in quotes. It was a banana-republic screwup of unbelievable proportions. What is known is that more Florida voters went to the polls intending to cast their votes for Gore -- and despite many of them being illegally turned away, more of them got into the voting booth and cast ballots, to the best of their ability, for Gore. The ballots were just plain miscounted, allegedly due to lack of time (unbelievable though that excuse may seem).

</p><p>These are the plain facts and I'm a little surprised that anyone still hasn't learned them.</p>

<p>It takes some combination of a lot of knowledge and a lot of confidence to make that kind of statement.  I wouldn't want to put myself out that far.</p>

<p>Lest anyone get the wrong idea, I'm of the opinion that tampering with voting should be punished as harshly as possible.  However, in the absence of perfectly accurate and clear voting (in other words, in practice), you have to do the best you can.  Changing the rules after votes have been cast (and counted) would be even more of a fiasco.</p>

<p>Besides that, my point was that anyone who brings up national popular vote numbers is a twit and should be ignored as such.</p>

That poll question is annoying.  I've seen it misused in almost every instance it's been cited, most commonly as a stat saying who people would vote for.  It is not.  I would not like to see him re-elected.  I didn't prefer him in 2000, and I don't prefer him now.  But, I will vote for him, surely, unless the Democrats get someone I can agree with more than 10 percent of the time.<br> <br>So far the only guy I could possibly consider voting for is <a href="http://www.biden04.com/" title="biden04.com">Senator Joe Biden</a biden04.com>, from the great state of Delaware, but even he would need to do a lot of work to convince me to vote for him over Bush.<br> <br>But I digress.  The poll question only reflects if people would want Bush or someone else, but it has nothing to do with whom they will support in the election next year.  He could get 10% in that poll, but if you ask whom people will vote for (assuming Bush is the GOP candidate), the number could still be well over 50%.<br>
