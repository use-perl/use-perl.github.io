A group of overweight Americans have sued several US fast food giants accusing them of knowingly serving meals that cause obesity and disease.

<p>I can't even muster a wiseass remark about the shear stupidity and lack of self-awareness the subjects of this article radiate. For the love of sweet Christ, how the hell does one eat at McDonald's and <em>not</em> feel the arteries harden? Having battled my own weight problems, I can tell you how hard it is to find food that won't expand your wasteline. Here's a hint: stop patronizing fast food restaurants. 
<p>Jesus f*cking Christ in a pink sweater in July, this is the very definition of inane. </p>

<h2>Suing fast food industry</h2>

There was <a href="http://www.salon.com/tech/feature/2002/05/24/fastfoodlaw/" title="salon.com">a n interesting Salon article</a salon.com> about it a couple of months ago.



<h2>Hmm...</h2>

One could probably say the same thing about the folks suing the cancer^Wtobacco companies.

<p>True, but tobacco is generally considererd more addictive than BigMacs[tm].

The difference is that the tobacco companies lied for years about *how* dangerous cigarettes were.  I don't know of the answer is to sue for your cancer, but certainly some action should be taken against their fraud.<br>

In addition, the tobacco companies manipulated nicotine levels specifically to increase the addictiveness of their product.  I don't think the case of fast food is parallel.

<tt> <br>...their deceptive advertising lead me to expect that I would<br>find many busty women in tight revealing outfits flexing and<br>bouncing at their establishments. Of course, if this were true,<br>I would enjoy working out for an hour each day.<br> <br>On this assumption, I've increased my caloric intake well beyond<br>my current metabolic needs, knowing that I would enjoy the work<br>necessary to counter the resulting weight gain.<br> <br>After searching in vain for a gym with as-advertised features,<br>I'm convinced that their bait-and-switch tactics are part of<br>a wide-spread conspiracy against hetero/bi-men and homo/bi-women<br>to get us to gain weight and die of associated morbidities.<br> <br>I'm gonna sue. Gimme my eye candy, or give me cash, or suck the<br>lard from my fat ass, m'kay?<br> <br>-matt<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; (toungue in cheek, just in case the humor wasn't clear)</tt>
