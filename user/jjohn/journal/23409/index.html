<p><p>Don't get me wrong: I thoroughly enjoyed <em>Fear and Loathing in Las 
Vegas</em>.  It was like an acerbic version of <em>Alice in Wonderland</em>
but with drugs I could recognize.  Thompson was a great writer, if not a little
self-absorbed.  However, his self-inflected death should not have surprised 
anyone (unless it was that it took him so long to pull the trigger) and its 
seems that his family was the least surprised of all.  You 
don't pump that much drugs and alcohol into yourself and act life a madman 
unless your running away from something.  Fear most certainly fuel Thompson's
writing career.  I am amazed at the people that look to his work as some kind
of guide to life.  Why not pick up a copy of Crowely's <em>Diary of a Drug 
Fiend</em> or de Sade's <em>Justine</em>?
<p>What is remarkable is how his death continues to make news.  Can we be on 
the verge of a new cult?  Will HST raise from his grave of Bad Craziness to 
join the Lizard King Morrison and His Grace Elvis?  Bad Craziness indeed...
<p>In non-HST news, I've unfortunately come down with a bad case of 
<a href="http://www.absoluteanime.com/hellsing/">Hellsing</a>.  A regular 
course of Manga seems to be helping.  The character of Sir Integra is 
<b>androgilicious</b>!</p>

&gt; <i>Can we be on the verge of a new cult? </i>
<p> <b>New</b> Cult? HST was a minor cult figure before Trudeau <a href="http://www.doonesbury.com/strip/faqs/index.html" title="doonesbury.com">wrote him</a doonesbury.com> into Doonesbury as  <a href="http://www.doonesbury.com/strip/thecast/duke.html" title="doonesbury.com">Zonker's uncle Duke</a doonesbury.com>.</p>

I think jjohn meant maybe a new version of a cult of HST.  Sorta like how Che Guevara had his cult when he was alive, but now a completely different cult since his death (one that sees him as a liberator instead of the murderous communist oppressor that he was).<br>

What you have to understand is that there's not a bunch of nice, well-adjusted people looking to HST's life as a model.  There's a bunch of mentally deranged, frightened people -- like myself -- who look at HST as a success story for people like themselves, a way to spin crazy into something of value.



<h2>Family</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/vsergu/">vsergu</a> on 2005-03-01T19:29:35</h3>
His family and friends <a href="http://www.nypost.com/news/nationalnews/41365.htm" title="nypost.com">seem to have taken it well</a nypost.com>. If I wanted people to gather around my corpse for a farewell party, I'd choose a less messy method of suicide, but then I'm not HST -- and I imagine Anita Thompson's definition of "freaky" has been affected a bit by being married to HST (though she must have had a high bar for "freaky" to marry him in the first place).
