<div class="span8">
<p><p>Finally got around to installing <a href="http://www.spamassassin.org/">SpamAssassin</a>. The installation went smoothly, but I did have a vehement argument with sendmail about the honor of procmail. For those that only touch sendmail at install, here are some tips:

<ul>
  <li><b><code>chmod 600 .forward</code></b>. Sendmail doesn't like to execute world/group writable .forward files.
  <li><b>Simplify the .forward file</b>. The following 
incantation for the .forward file is suggested in the SpamAssassin INSTALL file:<br /><br />
<code>"|IFS=' ' && exec /usr/bin/procmail -f- || exit 75 #user"
</codE>
<br /><br />
To reduce the number of cargo-cults out there, this line attempts to set an environment variable (the Input Field Separator) to a space and then <code>exec</code> procmail. The argument <code>-f</code> tells procmail to regenerate the leading 'From' mail header. The following '-' means that procmail only updates the timestamp on the 'From' line. 
If procmail bombs out, a mysterious exit code 75 is returned. Perhaps sendmail will do something with processes that return 75. In any case, this line ends in a comment that isn't used by procmail nor sendmail. It's for you! You don't need this rather obtuse line. Instead the following will suffice:<br /><br />
<code>|/usr/bin/procmail</code>
<br /><br />
Now that's a line even I can understand.
<li><b>Vouch for procmail</b>. When you encounter the following error message sent in an email from postmaster:
<br />
<pre>
"|/usr/bin/procmail"
    (reason: service unavailable)
    (expanded from: jjohn)
</pre>
<br />
Make sure that the sendmail restricted shell (smrsh) knows that procmail is a trusted program. This is done by putting a symlink to procmail in 
a directory smrsh knows about. On my RedHat system, that directory is <code>/etc/smrsh</code>. Local conditions may vary.
</ul>
<p>After my little <i>wrasselin'</i> match with sendmail, I'm reaping the rewards. SpamAssassin appears to have been worth the effort to install. 

<p>What are you waiting for?</p>

<h2>That ending comment</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/pjm/">pjm</a> on 2002-09-16T02:31:16</h3>
From memory, that ending comment in the original<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.forward invocation was intended to guard against  an overzealous sendmail optimization. The funky idea being that if two recipients of a given message had identical<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.forward files then why not just save the trouble of running through both of them and instead use the first encountered. Ugg. <br> <br>I'd guess it's ancient history being fossilised into an idiom, but I'm pretty sure that's the origin. (ie, the #username causes  diffs of everyone's<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.forward files to be non-zero).



<h2>IFS</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jdavidb/">jdavidb</a> on 2002-09-16T12:47:30</h3>
<p>Raise your hand if procmail has ever failed to work for you because you modified your IFS variable!</p>
