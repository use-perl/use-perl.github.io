<div class="span8">
<p>Much hay was made of <a href="">orkut's</a> poorly worded EULA that suggested that all content submitted to the site became the property of google.
This was nutty on the face of it (remember that I used to have a site 
devoted to UFO conspiracies and even <b>I</b> didn't swallow this one), 
but here's a 
<a href="">clarification of the issue</a>:
<blockquote>
&laquo;<em>Does orkut.com own all the content that I submit to the site?</em>
</br><br>
<b>Answer:</b> orkut.com does not claim any ownership right in the profile or other information that you submit. When you submit content to orkut.com, we use it to display the content on the site and to other members according to your preferences. You may edit, remove or limit the people who can view the content at any time. We may analyze the types of information submitted to determine how our members use the site and how we can improve the orkut system.&raquo;
</blockquote>
<p>Now, I invite all of you who haven't joined the cult, I mean, web site to 
jump in.  It's mostly harmless.

<h2>I love orkut...</h2>

I never suspected the EULA was burdomsome.  I wouldn't put anything up on any public site like that if I wanted some sort of IP claim to it anyway, so I never did see the problem.<br> <p>Everybody can see a really bad picture of me over there.  You have to figure out which jordan in the Perl Community I am, though... (I think there's only one, but I'm not sure.)<br> </p><p>I wish the forums had true comment threading.  Also, there seem to be registration problems.  Some people never receive the invitation and I (and others I've known) had problems registering the first time when I did receive the invitation.<br> </p><p>Hmmm... Could the problems have anything to do with the fact that orkut is hosted on Windows servers?</p>



<h2>Exaggerated EULA or not...</h2>

...I still find sites like Orkut plain stupid.<br>

Yes, they are.  I'm being to think that's the point.   On the one hand, orkut promotes unabashed name dropping and clique-forming.  On the other, it's a complete waste of time.  What's not to like about it?  orkut's got a train-wreck quality that worth the price of admission.  Did I mention the cult-like aspect?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-=)

I hate orkut and its ilk too.  But I disagree with your assertion that the complaints about the EULA were "nutty on the face of it."  The complaints were not -- that I saw -- that orkut was going to steal our information, only that they were giving themselves the power to do so, which they were.  It's nutty to say they weren't doing that.  I think it's clear they didn't intend to do that, but it is what they did.
