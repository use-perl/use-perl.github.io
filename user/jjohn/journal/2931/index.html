<p><p>Here's a story that's an new twist on a familiar news story,  but instead of "dog," think "motherboard,", replace "man" with "jjohn" and "bites" with "destroys." That's right after <em>years</em> of replacing my own computer hardware, I have destroyed my main Window's PC. I lay the blame for this incident on a power supply with a soft switch. The bastard sprang to life as I was removing a video card. You say "why didn't you unplug the machine before opening the box?" To which I reply, I did <b>the other 99 times</b>. Actually, I thought I had unplugged it that time. I was very surprised to see the CPU fan start moving!
<p>Anyway, now I need to decide what I'm going to do about this. My Window's box was both my gaming platform and my TV. I will try to use one of my linux boxes for TV and I might have to content myself with Atari 2600 games, which is ok by me.
Should I replace that box with a MacOS X box? A new Linux box? Another Windows box?

<p>Have you got a really bone-headed hardware story? Do share!

<p>[<b>update:</b> This incident forced me to finally get one of my TV tuner cards to work under Linux. I'm using xawtv and it works ok. It's unstable in a completely different way than the W2K version, so that's new. I think I can live with this for a while. At least until Farscape comes back on the air.]</p>

<h2>Ouch</h2>

Well, that sucks.  I feel for ya.
<p>
I was just trying to add another 40 GB drive to my computer when I finally discovered that I didn't have a spare 4-pin connecter anywhere!  Doh!  All the other cables are used on other stuff.  I'll probably end up just switching out the old hard drive with the new one, but I was hoping to use both.  I'm gonna hold off for a while, though.
</p><p>
Ah, well.  I needed to pull out the Creative DVD drive anyway, which crapped out after less than 6 months.  That didn't impress me.  Second one in 2 1/2 years, no less.  It also gave me a chance to clean out the orange juice I spilled down the front cover one day.  I'm still finding little bits of dried up orange juice - a year and a half later.
</p><p>
As for what you should do, I'd hold off on a Mac.  The G5's are supposed to be out soon, and I'd hate to see you wishing that you had waited.  If you can wait until then, buy a Mac (I'm planning on getting one, probably next year).
</p><p>
As for a Linux box versus a Windows box - why do you need separate machines?  Why not just split the hard drive?  Or, perhaps run WINE within Linux?
</p><p>
The crappy Linux tv tuners are one reason I didn't keep Linux around on my home machine (space was another).  I've got the ATI All-In-Wonder myself.  Hell, even BeOS had a *couple* of good tuner apps for my card.</p>

<p>Good point. Another good point is that I don't feel like spending more than $1000 on a machine. I normally buy <em>really</em> low end machines. That way, I don't care when they explode. Had I done this to an Apple, or even a new Dell, I would have been really pissed.
</p><p> <i>As for a Linux box versus a Windows box - why do you need separate machines?

</p><p>I gave up dual booting long ago. The combination of cheap machines and a KVM box makes it easy to access different OS's <em>at once</em>. I tried out WINE less than 6 months ago it's about as stable as the Linux TV tuners. I do have VMWare, but my celeron machines don't have enough horsepower to machine those sessions useful for anything but ASP programming. I make my living writing about and programming for Linux, so I'll have a Linux box around for the foreseeable future. I hate to admit it, but I find the challenge of making Desktop linux run, er, fun.
</p><p>I have hope that the <a href="http://www.exploits.org/v4l/" title="exploits.org">video4linux</a exploits.org> project will deliver a quality tuner app soon. I need to do more homework in this area.
</p><p>Thanks for your input!</p>

Yeah, I was gonna say, you aren't exactly in the market for the G5.  The G5, if it exists, is for people who do multimedia for a living, or like to have the latest and greatest Just Because.
<br>
<br>If you want Mac OS X, though, you *will* want a G4, though you might be able to get away with 500+ MHz G3, and 256 MB RAM.  And you can get a used G3/500 Mac for under $1000.  But I'd really suggest looking into a G4, which'll put you over.  And make sure whatever you get that it's well-supported by Mac OS X (I think all G3s are, but I am not entirely sure).

<br>
<br>No, no, you've got to be wrong there.  It has to be MicroSoft's fault.  Sue them for every cent they've got.  If you win, I want a cut.



<h2>Replacement</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jdavidb/">jdavidb</a> on 2002-02-18T18:18:35</h3>
<p>Replace with a linux box running <a href="http://www.freeciv.org/" title="freeciv.org">freeciv</a freeciv.org>.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<p>I'm with you on the Atari 2600 games!  I've seen rumors that Stella, the 2600 emulator, is soon to be GPL'ed.  Toying with the idea of building <a href="http://www.classicgaming.org/vcsp/" title="classicgaming.org">one of these</a classicgaming.org> but totally differently, with an embedded system running Stella.</p>

<p>Ack!  I meant <a href="http://www.classicgaming.com/vcsp/" title="classicgaming.com">one of these</a classicgaming.com>.</p>
