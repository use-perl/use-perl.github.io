<p>Nikon Coolpix 995 from 10:10 p.m. to 11:12 p.m. Exposuresat f/5.6 from 1/2000 sec. to 8 sec. It got a little fuzzy
at the end, as the clouds began to roll back in. I do not
like dishonesty and misrepresentation. In my work with the
conferences, I've kept marketing pitches out and technical
quality up. Did anyone attend this year's ApacheCon and
enjoy the "keynotes" that the big sponsors put on? That's
what happens when people sell out, and I hate being in
front of the help. Dear Log, <p>New motto: never attribute
to malice what can be attributed to a bad accounting
system. Dear Log, <p>Today is <a

Personally, I have the barest elements of this script
written, but my mind is remarkably happy that I've finally
managed to get the right amount to wipe your arse properly.
All said and done, we have a kewl new ch1x0r and I'm a
happy man. :- pretty distorted view of O'Reilly.<P> Those
of you who don't live in the Denver area? Otherwise, I'm
going in a bit blind. I'll just blame all of you if I.

I think your corpus is a little on the small side.<br> <br>But it's what you do with it that counts I guess.

Yes.  I've expanded it since this post.  It's still not generating that laugh-out-loud messages I'd like it to.  Randomizing the input order to the blog entries helped.  Plus each markov blog gets put back into the source pool.  I haven't decided if this is a good idea.  I can filter out generated entries pretty easily, since the suject line identifies that entry as a <a href="http://www.thewavemag.com/pagegen.php?pagename=article&amp;articleid=24031" title="thewavemag.com">replicant</a thewavemag.com>.
