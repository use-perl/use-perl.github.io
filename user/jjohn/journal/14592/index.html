<p><blockquote>&laquo;"We know for a fact ... that terrorists studied Somalia and they studied instances where the United States was dealt a blow and tucked in and persuaded themselves they could, in fact, cause us to acquiesce in whatever it is they wanted us to do," [Rumsfeld] told reporters aboard his plane. <br>...</br>
Rumsfeld made clear that he was talking about both the international press, such as reports on the Arab al Jazeera television network, and critics in the United States.<br>
<br>...<br>
Earlier in his trip, Rumsfeld had criticized the U.S. news media for ignoring "the story of success and accomplishment" in Iraq and argued that the speed of improvement in the country "dwarfs any other experience I'm aware of," including Germany and Japan after World War II. He argued that the impact of continued attacks against U.S. forces had been overstated and likened them to isolated terrorist violence "in every country in the world."&raquo;
</blockquote>
<p>--Washington Post: <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A42728-2003Sep8.html">Rumsfeld: Criticism at Home, Abroad Harms War on 
Terrorism</a>
<p>It's right shame that the Founding Fathers of the US, who had done such a 
marvelous job crafting the second Constitutional amendment guaranteeing the 
right of citizens to bear arms, included that unfortunately worded 
predecessor that allows <a href="http://www.michaelmoore.com/">disloyal 
muckrackers</a> to give <i>tangible</i> support to terrorists.  You're right, 
Mr. Rumsfeld, to condemn the media on the shameful way it keeps bringing up 
your failure to find credible evidence of WDM, to expeditiously restore 
"normalcy" to the <i>liberated</i> citizens of Iraq or even find Saddam 
Hussein and his <i>good buddy</i> Osama bin Laden.  What is the media for, 
if not to <a href="http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/propaganda_in_nazi_germany.htm">enlighten our nation?</a>  
If only those <i>naysayers</i> would just <i>support the troops</i> and not 
question the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,3604,1036571,00.html">motives, goals or methods of this administration</a>, 
America could once again be a great nation, as it once was in the sunset of 
<a href="http://www.historychannel.com/">World War II</a>.
<p>Shame on you, Mr. Rumsfeld.
<p>Shame for equating the loyal and reasonable opposition
to the Bush administration's foreign and domestic policies to giving <b>aiding 
terrorists</b>.  Shame for stooping to the kind of sophistry that is normally 
the domain of autocratic regimes, like the one recently deposed in 
Iraq.  Shame for the stranglehold this administration has on the real news of 
9/11, the investigations that followed and the wars in the Middle East. 
<p>Your loyal critics have had to do a lot of handwaving and speculation 
about the details of the mischief that's been done under the rubric of 
"the War on Terror."  The cause of "national security" has been stretched so
thin that soon, I suspect, only Pentagon officials will be allowed into White 
House press conferences.  What the world is likely to learn when you cowboys 
in DC are shown the door in 2004 or, God help us, 2008 makes my blood run 
cold.
<p>Either burn the Constitution in great bonfire at an oceanic GOP rally or 
acknowledge the rightful place of loyal dissent in a healthy democracy.  
Trying to scare the population with unspecified warnings on the one hand and 
intimating veiled threats to your opposition on the other has all the panache 
of a schoolyard bully.  I will not see the Stars and Strips set down in 
history next to the Swastica as a fascist symbol.
<p>I am a loyal American, Mr. Rumsfeld.  My family has been in this country 
for generations.  My father served in the Navy during the Korean War and my 
brother served in the Air Force.  I've got friends currently serving in the 
military today.  I am tax payer and a voter.  I believe that American 
experiment has not failed (entirely).  I assert that the Constitution, despite
its age, brevity and occasional shortcomings, still provides the best of 
system of government that anyone has come up with so far.  I am as loyal a 
citizen of this representive democracy as you are likely to find. 
<p>And I oppose you.

<p> <i>Somehow, you seem to believe the First Amendment only gives license to criticism of the Government.</i>
</p><p>Yes, I do believe that was exactly the intention of the First Amendment:  to check the power of elected officials.  The media can be more effective hedge against rogue governments that local mitilias.
</p><p>Some autocrats sieze power from outside the political system.  Some autocrats are elected to power (The Nazis, 1933 and Mussolini's Black Shirts, 1922) Plainly, my concern that we have elected autocrats to office.  I point this out as I best I can.  I admit, jordan, that I may be wrong.  After all, I have no special source of information.  I don't have an extensive education in world politics, beyond some college classes and some books I've read.  I do get some of my facts wrong sometimes.  It may be that the world is exactly as Rumsfeld, Cheney and Bush as it is;  that their foreign policy is designed to bring peace to the region and remove the global threat of terrorism for the good of everyone; that Iraq really had a successful WMD program, the evidence for which will soon be discovered.
My analysis of the complexities of world politics may turn out be critically flawed.
</p><p>However.
</p><p>I remain deeply offended at Rumfeld's comments.  I see them as part of a process that could lead the US toward full-blown fascism.  I see no special reason why the US government is impervious to wholesale corruption or collapse.  It is dangerously naive to believe otherwise.  So in pointing out credible dangers to our democracy, I'm attempting to be a good citizen.   The department of Homeland Security does much the same thing for precisely the same reason.  If I have greatly misjudged the intentions (and actions) of the Bush administration, then I'll merely be a good, but loudly wrong citizen.
</p><p>This Union has survived worse.
</p><p>I have not equated the methods of the Hussein regime and those of the Bush administration.  They differ by degree.  It is true that there's no evidence that suggests Rumsfeld has violent interrogations videotapped so that he can masturbate to them later (like Uday Hussein is rumored to have done).  It's true that there's no evidence that US forces shower captives with acid, as the Hussein regime seems to have done.  Still, both regimes have split a lot of innocent blood, but it is the victor that writes history.
</p><p>I don't suggest that Rumsfeld should not express his dismay or disagreement with the press.  I would be dumbfounded if he did not disagree.  My issue is that he not-so-subtly linked criticism of US foreign policy to <i>aiding terrorists</i>.  I will not be branded a terrorist because I disagree with many of Bush's policies and I am entirely comfortable with my hyperbole in taking Rumsfeld to task for this tactic.  I'll paraphrase <i>Catch 22</i> here:
</p><blockquote><div>
Yossarian:  "The Germans are trying to kill me!"
<br>
Solider Foo: "The Germans are trying to kill all of us.  This is war.  They're not trying to kill you personally."
<br>
Yossarian: "Is that supposed to make me feel better?"
</div></blockquote>
<p>This administration has been ruthlessly hostile to opposition, both inside the GOP and (naturally) outside.  The kind of open and frank questioning that Mr. Blair is facing regarding Iraq's WMD should also be occurring today in Congress.  I'm deeply concerned that this has not happened yet.  The lack of a vigorous opposition makes me deeply uneasy.</p>

<p>Government officials accusing people of treason is more than name calling, and it's not the first time it's happened in this administration. Perhaps we don't have a right to avoid it, but it seems like something worth objecting to, and something that bears watching, even if they aren't yet blacklisting or jailing the traitors.</p>

<ul><li><i>Do you believe that it's impossible for the US government ever to become totalitarian?</i></li></ul>  <br>No, I don't think it's impossible, but I don't think Rumsfelds comments are any indication one way or the other that we're heading in that direction.  I do believe that some of the media, particularly foreign media, are giving if not aid, certainly comfort to our enemies.  I think this is all Rumsfeld was saying.<br> <p>I also believe that it's not possible to criticize the Administration without giving <i>some</i> comfort to our enemies and therefore consider it protected speech.  I think, if you asked, Rumsfeld would agree with this.<br> </p><ul><li><i>Or is that something we only need to fear when Democrats are in power?</i></li></ul>  <br>No, but I do think we have more to fear when these issues are so polarized.  If half of the country believes the other half are evil monsters that will either sell us out in a minute and that half of the coutnry believes that the other half will take away all of our liberties, then we are in danger of a violent reaction that could truly lead to tyranny.  Screaming that someone is shredding the Constitution when, in fact, they are exercising their protected right to free speech is an example of a polarizing activity that could do us great damage.<br> <p>I don't believe, as some seem to, that criticizing the Government automatically makes you a good citizen.  You can be a good citizen by criticizing the Government and you can be a good citizen by supporting the Government.  In and of itself, your willingness and ability to criticize the Government does not make you a good citizen.<br> </p><ul><li><i>Government officials accusing people of treason is more than name calling, and it's not the first time it's happened in this administration.</i></li> </ul>  <br>Mischaracterizing what someone has said is worse than name calling, in my book.  Tell me, when exactly, did Rumsfeld or anyone else in this administration use the word treason with regard to their critics?  I don't want to hear you point out when they said it by implication.  Treason has a strict, Constitutionally defined, definition.   Saying that you are aiding terrorists by your words is not the same as an accusation of treason.<br> <ul><li><i>Perhaps we don't have a right to avoid it, but it seems like something worth objecting to, and something that bears watching, even if they aren't yet blacklisting or jailing the traitors.</i></li></ul>  <br>In this discussion, I've always come down square on the side of your, or anyone's, ability to criticize the Government.  Go ahead and object, but don't start screaming that the Constitution is being shredded if someone disagrees with you.

I'm disheartened that nowadays we're apparently supposed to use countries like Iraq as the standard against which to measure the US government.

I apologize for overreacting, but I have become very sensitive to having Bush supporters say, whenever people point to some new erosion of civil liberties, that in Saddam's Iraq we wouldn't have been able to complain about such things.  The statement is true, of course, but irrelevant.<br> <br>My mindset did lead me to misread something you wrote.  Because the sentence seemed to be a complaint, I somehow saw another "all" between "at" and "times", and thus turned a simple statement which with few would argue into a bit of over-the-top ranting.<br> <br>What you actually did say is of course true, almost trivially so.  The disagreement is about how critical the media are, how often, and when.<br>
