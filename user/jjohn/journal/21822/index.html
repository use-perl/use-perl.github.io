It really irritates me when something it writes catches my eye on Meerkat and I accidently click the link.  I sure wish Meerkat allowed me to filter the use.perl journal feed by author, but it doesn't.
<p>
Maybe it was funny once, but surely that has passed!

<p>Just wait.  It will get funny again!

What's the big deal?  Couldn't you just ignore it like the rest of us do?  If you see [MarkovBlogger] in the subject, *don't* click on it<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

Apparently not. Besides, just because it's possible to ignore the asshole shouting on his cell phone in the middle of a movie doesn't mean you should!
<p>
I should probably just stop using Meerkat and use a more flexible RSS reader.  It just doesn't support the level of filtering I need to sort the signal from the noise.
