It's great.<br> <p>Hate that Guardian article you linked to, though.  That writer is way too clever for his own good.  He's also a buffoon.  <br> </p><p> <i>So</i> is not "an album packed with ultra-commercial priapic cod-funk".  On <i>So</i>, there's only <i>Sledgehammer</i> and <i>Big Time</i> that possibly fit any semblance of that description.  Both, great songs that show you can be commercial and good, btw.  <i>So</i> also has great songs like <i>Red Rain</i>, <i>Mercy</i>, <i>This is the Picture</i>, <i>Don't Give Up</i> (somewhat commercial, but hardly ultra-commercial priapic cod-funk) and a host of other great songs.<br> </p><p>This writer had to have a THEME to write about here, so he chose, Peter Gabriel get's away with murder by being so far out there because he's actually really good.  It's a stupid, ill-supported theme.</p>

<p>I tried to linked to PG's UP page, but I couldn't figure it out. The site is too clever for its own good.
</p><p>Along with UP, I also bought Security, So, and Scratch (all the remixed albums). I haven't had this albums in close to 10 years. Huzzah.</p>
