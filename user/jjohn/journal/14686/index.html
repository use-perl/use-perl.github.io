<p> <p>The tiny, unborn marketing guy inside me wanted to pitch this TV ad campaign to you all.  Enjoy.
<blockquote>
<p><i>Opening montage of jerky, choppy cuts of jjohn typing on laptop from 
different, improbably (and somewhat impolite) angles;  Heavily fuzzed-up 
guitar music featuring dramatic whammy bar dives and tremolos accompanies 
images</i>
<p><b>James Earl Jones Voice Over</b>:  Joe Johnston is a professional Perl
programmer and UNIX hack.  Co-author of several, er, selling technical books, 
Joe knows latops.
<p><i>Cut to headshot of jjohn with spiky, "bedhead" hair</i>
<p><b>JJ:</B> Hola, Dudes and Dudettes!  When I'm banging out mod_perl 
scripts at 3AM or jamming out a new tech article, the last thing I need 
is for the dollar key on my laptop to go <b>tits up</b>. 
<p><i>Cut to jjohn's horror-filled reaction as his keyboard stops working;  
Guitar plays "out of luck" notes;  Cut to jerky, handcam closeup of jjohn</i>
<p><b>JJ:</b> That's why I <b>only</b> use IBM ThinkPad (&trade;) laptops.  
Every ThinkPad (&trade;) features outrageous Pentium processing power backed 
by reliable IBM hardware and support.  Each ThinkPad (&trade;) comes in a 
<b>sick</b> black chassis build with a <b>radical</b> fire-engine red 
nipplemouse and an <b>awesome</b> LCD screen.  Dude!  It's even got it's own 
battery!  
<p><i>Cut to the most iconoclastic, pouting teenaged girl you can imagine 
foddling laptop in front of her pink babydoll t-shirt that sports an oversized 
white star emblem;  Cut back to jjohn</i>
<p><b>JJ:</b> Best of all, you can put any damn operating system on it you 
want!  Sure it comes with Microsoft Windows, but this bitch <b>purrs</b> under 
Linux, FreeBSD, even <b>BeOS</b>!
<p><i>jjohn holds laptop like a guitar, sticks tongue out and pretends to 
play along with shedding metal guitar in foreground; cut back to closeup</i>
<p><b>JJ:</b> Don't let your power cord go limp and flaccid while you're 
stepping through the debugger!  Get a IBM ThinkPad (&trade;) today!
<p><i>Pouting girl enters from stage left;  Looks at jjohn's laptop</i>
<p><b>Pouting Iconoclast:</b> Nice laptop, I guess.
<p><i>jjohn smiles smuggly; winks to camera</i>
<p><b>JJ:</b> Baby, you said a <b>mouthful</b>!
<p><i>Legalese writing appears in unreadably small lettering while voice over
reads lines at top speed</i>
<p><B>VO:</B> Windows is a registered trademark of Microsoft Corporation. 
BeOS is a registered trademark of Palm, Inc.  Linux and FreeBSD aren't 
trademarks at all.  Under certain conditions, IBM ThinkPads (&trade;) may 
fail to attract desirable members of the opposite sex.  Your mileage 
may vary.  Offer void where prohibited.  Use only as directed.  See you primary
care physician before using. IBM ThinkPads (&trade;) should not be used by 
gravid women (or gravid men).<br>
DO NOT TAUNT IBM ThinkPads (&trade;)
</blockquote>
<p>Say, that was fun!  If you want to hear more of my great marketing ideas, 
have your people talk to my people (inside my head).
<p><b>UPDATE:</b>  Try this product on for size:  IBM ThinkPad (&trade;) Condoms:  <i>When the hacking's done; the humping's begun.</i>

to cut to the pouty iconoclast just after mentioning it comes with it's own battery...it's almost as if you knew!<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) maybe next year's movie/LT theme needs to be in the mockumentary/mockumercial format....
