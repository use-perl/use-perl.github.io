I keep <em>wanting</em> to do this, because Alton Brown did fish and chips a few weeks ago, but the effort of doing it all keeps me from doing so.  Sigh.

  <li>Alton Brown is one hip dude.  He's got a blog of sorts on his <a href="http://www.altonbrown.com/pages/rants.html" title="altonbrown.com">web site</a altonbrown.com>.</li>
  <li>I got the recipe from footv.com, but am way to lazy to find the URL again</li>
  <li>It is VERY EASY AND FAST to make the batter.  If you've got a mixing bowl and one good arm, you can do it.  You throw a cup of flour, a 1/4 cup of corn starch, 1/2 tablespoon of salt, 1/2 tablespoon of baking power, 1 tablespoon of lemon juice and 3/4 cup of beer into a bowl and mix.  Let this mix set for 5-10 minutes and dredge fish in it.  I used about 1 lb, of cod fillet and had to cut it into 3 6-8" pieces.  For oil, I used canola.   You should use med-high heat or, if you've got a cooking thermometer, heat to 350F-375F.   Don't splash yourself while inserting the fish into the hot oil.  YOW!</li>
   <li>The recipe calls for beer.  I had very satisfactory results with Sam Adams Boston Ale.  I would suggest a "light" beer, like a lager, Ale, Pilsner or even a wheat beer.  An amber would probable work too.</li>
</ul>
<p>I've never made *an* batter before and I could do it unassisted.  Let's put it this way: the fish and chips I am are far more edible than the regrettable mexican rice and beans dish I made last week that I ruined with about 1 cup too much water.
</p><p>Water-logged rice sucks.</p>

It sounds like you used Alton's recipe...long, long sigh.  I remember how good those looked.  Perhaps I shall have to convince my SO that frying is okay and pick up a large quantity of canola...
<p>
Concerning oil burns, I managed to get myself a rather nasty one recently on both my forearm and mid-torso.  It looked like I'd been too close to a shotgun going off until the burns healed.</p>

But let's not forget that the best oil for deep frying is peanut oil.  At least, if you ignore animal fats, which I do.

As long as there aren't any allergy issues, yes.
