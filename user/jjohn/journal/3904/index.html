<p><P>My apartment was just buzzed by a US fighter plane. This is the fourth time this has happened. 
<p>I don't like it.
<p>Part of my problem is that I have an irrational fear of what would happen if the plane, say, crashed into my building. As solid as these brick
walls are, I might have some straigtening up to after such an accident.
<p>Another problem I have with the flyovers is that they aren't announced (at least, I never see anything about them). So from out of the blue, I hear a very loud and doplered sound approaching my apartment. Am I too neutrotic? I don't know. It's not the physics of flying that I have a problem with. I have little faith in the people that operate and maintain these machines. People fail more often than physics. </p>

Then perhaps you should find an apartment that has been pre-disastered.

Then perhaps you should move someplace where the Air Force pre-announces their flight plans (just in case anyone has a spare stinger missle they want to test out, or wants to leave home and avoid the noise).

I knew I could count on your virtual shoulder to cry on.

I knew it was going to happen beforehand<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... maybe I should have called you.  I did think about what you might be thinking when it happened, but I was more concerned that the other noise going on simultaneously -- Steven Tyler singing the national anthem -- might have been more bothersome!<br>

<p> <i>Steven Tyler singing the national anthem</i>

</p><p>Was <em>that</em> what that was? I thought Satanists had taken over the park and had begun sacrificing cats and lambs to their Dark Overlord.</p>
