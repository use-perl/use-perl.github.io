<p><p>Recall that in 2002, there was a lot of loose talk and innuendo about "some kind" of smallpox attack "somewhere."  At the time, it didn't 
seem so implausable.  After all, Congress was paralysed after receiving 
several letters containing weapons-grade anthrax (mmm, I wonder what happened
to that story...).  It was during this period that the Administration
pushed for a massive smallpox vaccination program for all public health 
workers.  That was to make us safe, I assume.  However, that effort was 
doomed from the start, since the vaccination must be used within 90 days of 
manufacture and no one was in the business of mass producing the medicine on 
the scale required.  So we all thought clean thoughts and hoped for the best. 
<p>Apparently, that was the right thing to do.
<p>In a quote pulled from the article on <A href="http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2003/08/23/with_demand_lacking_smallpox_vaccine_expiring/">boston.com: With demand lacking, smallpox vaccine expiring</a> one Boston doctor 
explains the problem.
<blockquote>
&laquo;"The war came, the war left, things happened, and we weren't using 
vaccine as quickly as we had hoped to use it," said Dr. Alfred DeMaria, the 
Massachusetts director of communicable disease control. "And that's when we 
got to the 90-day expiration, and we had to throw it away."&raquo;
</blockquote>
<p>Fear is a very powerful motivator.  It frequently trumps solid reasoning.  
Much of the Bush Administration's reactions to 9-11 have struck me as a
panicked and startled (that is, they appear that way when I'm not leaning 
toward a more conspiratorial world-view).  Even with the most open and 
forthcoming of Administrations (in which camp the Bush folks decidedly do 
not fall), it is very hard to evaluate protective measures.  How can we 
evaluate the effectiveness of the PATRIOT act in preventing Terrorism or 
other crimes?  There's no control group we can look to that shows us what 
might have been.
<p><a href="http://portland.indymedia.org/en/2003/08/269495.shtml">Attorney 
General Ashcroft</a> is seeking support for a bill that grants even
more sweeping powers to law enforcement.  It's call the VICTORY act</A> 
and among other powers, federal investigators would be able to get business 
records without a court order (recall that in the wake a 9-11, the feds 
canvassed many businesses, including SCUBA shops, asking for the records 
of customers. One SCUBA shop refused the request and was harassed for it).  
More frightening is that VICTORY would also allow the feds to track wireless 
communications <b>without</b> a warrant.  Vermont's Bernie Sanders is also 
concerned <a href="http://bernie.house.gov/documents/articles/20030821162828.asp">about this issue</a>. 
<p>Perhaps my distrust of this Administration would fade if it ceased borrowing
terminology from Orwell's <i>1984</i>.

<h2>Comfort</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/pudge/">pudge</a> on 2003-08-26T22:46:29</h3>
The "comforting" thing about the Patriot Act is that it overwhelmingly required judicial approval of the broader powers.  Much of the Patriot Act really isn't that bad, as long as the courts can be trusted (and, if they can't, does it really matter WHAT the law says?).  But forgoing judicial approval and oversight is bad juju.<br> <br>There is simply no case to be made for it, either.  It's common to wake judges in the middle of the night for emergency warrants, and there's no reason that sort of thing shouldn't continue.
