Maybe I just know people who can't dye their hair properly, but I'm yet to see a bottle-red that looks like a natural red.



<h2>Rationalizing Beauty</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jjohn/">jjohn</a> on 2002-01-20T22:30:11</h3>
<p>Much of human interaction is based on arbitrary and subjective things. For programmers, admins and engineers, these ephemeral qualities are elusive. Often rejected as unimportant, plumage, grooming and hygene fall somewhat below the radar of "rational" thinkers. The key to life is balance and moderation, if the Hindus and Greeks are to be trusted.

<h2>Damn My Fickle Memory</h2>

I seem to remember reading the results of some bizarre study where they attempted to quantify -- get this -- *behavioral differences due to hair color*.  Not just *natural* color -- the idea was that it's some sort of subtle societal influence.
<p>
I wonder if any studies have been done that attempt to prove men with shorter hair aren't as strong, either.</p>

<p>Well, I didn't get a single date in high school as a brunette but I dyed my hair blonde for kicks when I went to University and I received a *very* noticible difference in the amount of male attention I received. The nice thing about stereotypes is that so many people seem very eager to embrace them. Being blonde was fun but it didn't really match my black wardrobe<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>
