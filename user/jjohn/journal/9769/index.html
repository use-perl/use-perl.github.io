<p><p>Ye Olde slashdot recently ran an article about the tiny web server <a href = "http://www.boa.org/">Boa</a>. That lead me to look at its obligatory <a href="http://www.boa.org/documentation/boa-3.html">benchmark page</a> were it compares favorably to apache. The issue of web server benchmarks as become of interest to me as I work on my game <a href="http://aliensaliensalines.com:8080/">State Secrets</a>, which is has a single-threaded all Perl web server. I haven't been bowled over by the performance of SS as a web server (I didn't build it for speed) and some pages seem to take far too long to render. 

<P>Enter apache's benchmarking tool <code>ab</code>. 

<p>I present the results of two benchmarking runs. The benchmarking software was run on the same machine as the server (I realize there are inherent problems with this). The first set of numbers represents static content service. The second set of number is for dynamic content. There is an order of magnatude difference between these numbers, as one would expect.
<p>What, if anything, do you make of these numbers? To me, it seems the server is performing pretty well. Of course, my expectations are pretty low. I don't expect to support more than 4 simultaneous users.

<h2>POE</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Matts/">Matts</a> on 2003-01-05T10:59:27</h3>
I wrote an "optimised" HTTP server in POE to see what the max performance I could get out of it would be. It turned out about 80 reqs/sec on a PIII-700.<br> <br>I'd say you're not doing too bad. I tend not to worry about performance unless a URI is returning less than 5 reqs/sec.
