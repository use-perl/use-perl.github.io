<div class="span8">
<p><p>I'd like to make informed, incisive comments on current events, but I don't have time. Therefore, I will borrow the format of the McLaughlin Group.

<p><b>Item 1:</b> <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/2667805.stm">Indonesia protests at US entry rules</a>. US immigration authorities are requiring that adult muslim males intending to stay in the US must register their fingerprints with the US government. Civil libertarians at home and abroad decry the measure as racial profiling. Is this a good policy decision?

<p>The answer is <b>Yes</b>! Unfortunately the policy doesn't go far enough. Everyone from Aussies to Zimbabwians should be fingerprinted, photographed and cataloged when they enter this country. After all, they are guilty of being <em>foreigners</em>. Although there is a strong suggestion that the 2001 anthrax attack was instigated by a US citizen, I say: <b>trust no one</b>.

<p><b>Item 2:</b> <A href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/2665793.stm">Economists tackle US obesity.</a> Of all industrialized nations, the US far outpaces the rest in fatness. Although the usual suspects for American two-ton-tessies are sloth and fast food, a Harvard University research team suggests that the problem is due to <em>grazing</em>. That is Americans aren't eating more than other people at one meal, but rather <em>they never stop eating</em>. This new study lays the blame for the American lardbutt squarely on the shoulders of food makers, whose predatory marketing targets the sweet and salty tastebuds. Are we a nation of grazing farm animals?

<p>The answer is <b>no</b>! Regardless of their pedigree, why are we listening to <em>economists</em> talk about <em>health issues</em>? Do you ask your stock broker about colonoscopies? The real culprit: vestigal Puritanism that makes Americans work hard at the expense of their own health. Down with Cotton Maher and pass the french fries!

<p><b>Item 3:</b> <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/2648987.stm">I'm no paedophile, says Who star</a>. Peter Townshend was taken into custody early this week in connection with a child pornography <em>probe</em> by British authorities. Townshend had joined a kid porn site that required a paid membership. Townshend claims to have been doing "research" into child abuse prevention, a topic he has been interested in for some years. Is Peter Townshend Uncle Ernie? 

<p>The answer is <b>no</b>! As dangerous as porno is to the participants, it's essentially a spectator sport. If porno causes abuse, then what of US football or boxing? Kudos to England for making the US look <em>socially liberal</em>. However, it should be noted that porno sites make poor research facilities. My advice to Townshend: pick up a nice, safe hobby like heroin and leave the research to the professional (preverts).

<h2>Go North, son, go North</h2>

<p>With every passing day, Canada should be looking like a more viable and more attractive option for you. It only goes downhill from here. </p>



<h2>Informed &amp;amp; Incisive</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/inkdroid/">inkdroid</a> on 2003-01-17T15:05:23</h3>
You know, pretty much the only news show I watch with regularity now is the McLaughlin Group. After Dana Carvey's <a href="http://snltranscripts.jt.org/90/90gmclaughlin.phtml" title="jt.org">take off</a jt.org> on the show I felt like JM might have been a bit simplistic. But it's really wonderful to watch every one get fired up, and I always find the comments to be so insightful. Maybe I'm just getting more simplistic in my old age. He has an extremely wry sense of humor. Anyhow, kudos on the Johnston Group.



<h2>Uncle Ernie</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ziggy/">ziggy</a> on 2003-01-17T16:29:56</h3>
<blockquote><div> <i>
 Is Peter Townshend Uncle Ernie?
</i> </div></blockquote>
Most emphatically, <b>not</b>!  Jerri Hall says he's the last person to be a p[a]edophile (and we all trust the former Mrs. Jagger, so it must be true).
<p>
In one "news" story about this event, Townshend claimed that he was &laquo;<i>researching material for his autobiography</i>&raquo;.  (I wonder what he was doing when he was researching the autobiographical bits of <i>Tommy</i>.  I doubt there was a lot of pinball involved....)</p>



<h2>Registering</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/pudge/">pudge</a> on 2003-01-28T21:04:32</h3>
Many nations register many, if not all, foreigners who are visiting.  I don't see the big deal.  If I went abroad, I'd have no problem registering.<br> <br>Fingerprinting is a bit overboard, but the problem is that it is a lot harder to forge fingerprints than passports<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...
