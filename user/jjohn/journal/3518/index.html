<div class="span8">
<p><p>There was a story on slashdot about E. Gary Gygax (which is just a kickass name). One of the comments had a link to figure out *my* <a href="http://blanchard.virtualave.net/war/dndstats.html">D&amp;D stats</a>. I present these below.

<p>
<code>
Str: 5<br>
Int: 13<br>
Wis: 14<br>
Dex: 10<br>
Con: 12<br>
Chr: 14<br>
</code>

<p>I think the STR and INT values may be a bit low , while the CON value may be a bit high. So, what class am I?

An online survey/quiz thing! Ooh! Ooh!<blockquote><div> <tt>Int: 13<br>Wis: 16<br>Dex: 11<br>Con: 14<br>Chr: 15</tt> </div></blockquote>No <tt>Str</tt> since (a) I can't be bothered to convert the weights to metric, and (b) I've never benchpressed in my life.



<h2>Something's weird there</h2>

Apparently a 200 IQ and a Ph.D. only get you a 14 intelligence, which is pretty screwed up since a 200 IQ is basically unheard of.

If you're looking for a more accurate representation (D&amp;D is really meant to cover only the D&amp;D world of extraordinary things) build yourself in GURPS.  I don't believe there's a site for that, yet, though.

I got into GURPS for a bit.  It really is a sweet system, though it requires much more familiarity with rules than D&amp;D does.
<p>
Unfortunately, by the time it came around I was already on my way out of doing RPG.</p>

<h2>Another try</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jjohn/">jjohn</a> on 2002-03-14T18:42:14</h3>
I just took a goofy online IQ test (I've never been formally tested) and got a 130. I also figured I'm not *quite* as weak as I had at first thought. Here's the new stats. I can't explain why the INT went down. I think the CHR is too high now.<br> <br> <p> <br> <code> <br>Str: 9<br>Int: 10<br>Wis: 16<br>Dex: 10<br>Con: 12<br>Chr: 16<br> </code> <br> <br> </p><p>I think I'd make a servicable cleric, although my effectiveness in the dungeons would be hampered by the lack of strength. Clearly, my adventuring career would be short and I'd end up as a church official or NPC.<nobr> <wbr></nobr><code>:-D</code></p>



<h2>ouch!</h2>

<p>That was me whacking my head on the overhang because I was too weak to move out of the way from everyone avoiding my ugly mug!</p> <blockquote><div> <tt>Str: 9<br>Int: 11<br>Wis: 14<br>Dex: 8<br>Con: 13<br>Chr: 10</tt> </div></blockquote>



<h2>I guess I'm a Fighter</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/djberg96/">djberg96</a> on 2002-03-14T19:20:44</h3>
Str 14<br>
Int 12<br>
Wis 13<br>
Dex 10<br>
Con 12<br>
Chr 11<br>
<p>
Apparently, I'm the only one who does strength training in this bunch.  In my prime, my Str was 15 (damn, I lost my +1 to-hit bonus).  I guess for this group, I'd rather have a higher INT, though.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
</p><p>
So, Fighter it is.  Using <i>Games::Dice</i>, I see that I now have 5 hit points and 110 gold pieces.</p>



<h2>Well...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/chaoticset/">chaoticset</a> on 2002-03-14T19:47:19</h3>
...considering one section was headed 'Inteligence', I'm not too worried about my stats.
<p>
Str: 7<br>
Int: 11<br>
Wis: 13<br>
Dex: 13<br>
Con: 12<br>
Chr: 11<br>
</p><p>
The worst bit is that I used the numbers I <em>last</em> benched, years back in HS.  I've had virtually no exercise since then save for occasional walks, swims, and video games.</p>



<h2>Hm</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/pudge/">pudge</a> on 2002-03-15T17:33:58</h3>
I don't know what I am.  *shrug* I do know the content filters here are annoying me.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<blockquote><div> <tt>Str: 11<br>Int: 11<br>Wis: 13<br>Dex: 13<br>Con: 11<br>Chr: 12</tt> </div></blockquote>
