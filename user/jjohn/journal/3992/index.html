<p><p>If there's one artist I associate with my own youth and very fuzzily warm feelings, it's Peter Gabriel. It's hard to explain and I don't want to analyze it too much. Still, the first album I heard of Pete's was his third solo album (the one with Biko). Over the years, I've lost most of his early stuff. I decided to pick up <a href='http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000002IUH/'>the album</a> mentioned in the subject and I'm glad I did. Good music: Modern Love (not the Bowie song), DIY, On the Air. I'm 15 again!

<p><b>UPDATE:</b> I figured out the chords to "On the Air" tonight. 
<p>Opening: 
<code>E G/ E G B/B A G#m/E D<code>
<p>Verse:   
<code>B A G#m/E D (x2)
E E/D# D C#m
E E/D# D C
</code>
<p>Chorus:
<code>
B A E
G#m F#m E
C#m B A
</code>
<p>Break:
<i>in progress</i>
<p><b>[UPDATE]:</b> Check out <a href="http://ddi.digital.net/user/solsbury/scratch.htm">this page</a> about tPete's second album. Very interesting.</p>

Which early Peter Gabriel album was your favorite?  The untitled one or the untitled one?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-P



<h2>Peter Gabriel</h2>

I too listened to Peter Gabriel in my youth.  I still get goosebumps listening to 'Games Without Frontiers' which to this day is one of my all time favorite (s/favorite/favourite/) songs of <b>any</b> artist.  I was fortunate enough (although my wife would heartily disagree I'm sure - grin) to catch the 'Games Without Frontiers' video on MTV2 a while back (taped it of course) and whenever I'm in the mood I don't hesitate to pop-the-tape-in<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

Which version?  English?  French?  German?  Or the polyglot mix?

Hmm, the only version I've ever heard is the one on the 'melt' album so I would *assume* that would be the English version - except the <i>Jeux sans frontieres</i> part of course<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

<h2>Favorite Pete Gabriel</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jjohn/">jjohn</a> on 2002-04-06T17:29:08</h3>
<p>That's a tough call. My vote would be for the Biko album or Security. I love those albums and was deeply affected (in different ways) by both. It's easier for me to point out albums and songs I think were less successful. For instance, I never could get into Passion. Sue me. I think "Don't Give Up" is a little lame. I think "Going for the Big One" is <em>hella</em> lame. Maybe Pete was listening to Tom Waits then. Who knows? Although I liked Us, it didn't really break any new ground.
</p><p>Of course, what's not to like about his last Genesis album The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway? Good Stuff.</p>

I think Mr. Gabriel has flat out admitted putting songs on an album specifically for radio play in order to sell his "real" songs.*  That's why you get songs like "Big Time", etc.
<p>
I think the 'melt' album is his best, personally.  Oh, and I listen to <i>Passion</i> if I want to fall asleep.
</p><p>
*I have absolutely no evidence to support this.  I simply recall him saying it in an interview sometime long ago.</p>

<p> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00004TKZO/" title="amazon.com">the story of Ovo</a amazon.com>. Jarkko and I saw the  show when it was at the Millenium Dome and the music is an interesting departure for Gabriel. The last time I saw him do a show he didn't look well<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:(</p>
