<p><p><blockquote><i>
The skies they were ashen and sober; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The leaves they were crisped and sere--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The leaves they were withering and sere;<br>
It was night in the most lonesome October<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of my most immemorial year;<br>
It was hard by the dim lake of Auber,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In the misty mid region of Weir--<br>
It was down by the dank tarn of Auber,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In the ghoul-haunted woodland of Weir.
</i></blockquote>
<p>--Edgar Allan Poe, "Ulalume"

<p>What have I been up to, you ask? Being that this is season of Hallowmas, I broke out one of my collected works of Edgar Allan Poe and read some of his poems aloud in my bath. "Silence," "Lenore," "Ulalame" and "The Raven" all have a very strong beat to them that requires vocalization to truly come alive. 
<p>I've been working quite a lot on <a href="http://www.rtsoft.com/fq/">Funeral Quest</a>. I've been posting to the forum and trying to reverse engineer the protocol so that I can create a Flash!-less HTML client. Why? Well, the Flash! client doesn't work correctly on anything that's not EI. On my XP box, the Flash! client is crashing intermittenly. This is annoying.

<p>For online reading, I recommend the diary of <a href="http://www.prosoundweb.com/recording/mm/week1/mm.php">MixerMan</a>, a sound engineer working in the decadent and ghastly city of LA. If reality TV shows were this funny, I'd be watching them. You don't need to know a lot about music to appreciate the utter insanity this guy encounters in the process of trying to record a "bidding war band." 

<p>MixerMan's diary makes the IT world look sane and professional.</p>
