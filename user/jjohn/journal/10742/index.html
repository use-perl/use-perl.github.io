<p>I don't care for "reality TV." I don't watch <i>The Real World</i>, <i>Joe Millionaire</i> or even <i>Trading Spaces</i>. However, as I was 
flipping through the 50 million channels of nothing, a high-concept reality
show occurred to me. Why not marry the fru-fru fluffery of design shows 
with the hi-tech graphics of <i>Walking with Dinosaurs</i>? 
The result is a show I call: 

<p><b>Surprised by Dinosaurs!</b>

<p>The idea is a sublimely simple. Take a couple that's living together, pay one of the
them a lot of money to deceive the other (by creating a diversion
that keeps the other out of their shared home for a time), then watch the 
hilarity ensue as <i>CGI monsters from the paleolithic era</i> devour 
the returning couple!

<p>The show will cross demographic boundaries to beat the band.

<p>Should any TV executives wish to hire me for my brilliant programming 
genius, please note that I will only consider opportunities that include 
extensive telecommuning and cheap floozies. 
 
</p>

I admit it - I watch <i>The Real World</i> sometimes.  It allows me to (sort of) vicariously re-live my college days.
<p>
I'm always amused by the casting.  For the Las Vegas crowd, they clearly chose looks over personality.  Most of them could be models.  Only one or two of them actually have an interesting personality.  But, hey, they're sexy!</p>

I went to high school with <a href="http://www.mtv.com/onair/realworld/archive/then_flipbook/rw3then.jhtml?Number=1" title="mtv.com">one of the girls from Real World San Francisco</a mtv.com>, so I watched that.  Otherwise, I take a pass every time.

One of the guys on the very first Real World was from my High School, in the year behind me.  I didn't watch it specifically because he was on!
