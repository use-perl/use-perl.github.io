<p> <p>I write this on Saturday.  My last entry was Wednesday. Thursday is a happy blur now.  I know I went to some good talks, but 
I can't remember them now, even on pain of death.  What I do have a clear 
recollection of is going to the <i>Mummy Cafe</i> with Quinn, <a href="http://www.oblomovka.com/">Danny</a>, 
David Blank-Edelman, Gnat and Jenine.  Like the queen's tomb in the 
Khufu's (ne&eacute; Cheop's) Pyramid, this restaurant was small, 
subterranean and devoid of treasure.  However, the food was vaguely 
greek/mediterranean and so was easy to consume.  Although no alcohol was 
imbibed there, for some reason conversation at the table was preempted as 
we all watched the ice cube that was impaled by David and hung across his 
glass slowly melt away to the point of failure.
<p>At the time, this seemed very, very important.  Maybe the food included 
some kind of "pharaoh's surprise."
<p>Our troop ended up taking over the empty "O Cielo!" cafe, graciously hosted 
by emmigrant Italian man.  I can't properly convey the un-east-coastness of 
the place to those who weren't there, but suffice it to say the cafe's easy 
elegance was both disarming and enjoyable. 
<p>On the way back to the hotel, we stopped at this elebrate 
water fountain/park that allowed visitors to walk around and through 
the multilayered, cantalevered waterfalls.  At night, the indirect and 
submerged sparse lighting lent the space a faery quality.    
<p>Back at the hotel, I shared some scotch with DJ Adams, Piers Harding, 
and Tom Christiansen, whose wounded middle finger seemed to be responding well
to its treament.  I also got to hang out with Tim Allwine and some core IS 
hackers and got caught up on the latest office poop.  The more things change, 
the more they stay the same.  Yet later still, I fell into a very silly 
conversation with Dave Adler and Sean Burke.  I don't recall the details, but 
the image of Mr. Burke's flushed face gasping for air between peals of 
laughter is associated with that section of the evening.  I assume he was 
laughing with me, not at me. 
<p>And then sleep took me.
<p>On Friday, I awoke late for Dyson's talk, who went on about the 
origins of computer hardware (I believe he was there for much of it).  
An interesting talk, but not one that could trump my need for breakfast.  
After stuffing my gob, I sat through Damian Conway's "Perl 6 Rules" talk, 
which summarized the Perl5 module he wrote that provides Perl 6 grammar 
class-thingies.  When you write a module that uncovers bugs in the regex 
engine, you know you're not getting out enough.
<p>Speaking of not getting out enough, Ask Bjorn Hansen created a film of 
conference attendees saying wacky things.  My personal favorite was this nutjob who 
talked about Microsoft poisoning the lunch they provided for OSCON.  Nutty.
<p>The last speaker was Milton Ngan from New Zealand who works 
at Weta.  He walked us through some of the infrastructure used to render Peter 
Jackson's <i>Lord of the Rings:  The Two Towers</i>.  You know the FX are 
slick when you can be shown how the magic is done and not lose any of the 
wonder for movie.
<p>With the conference officially over, many of us headed to the Portland 
Zoo.  I particularly enjoyed the primate section, complete with a pygmy 
marmoset, appeared hopped on goofballs, and an angst ridden Orangutan.  Of 
course, the bat cave, filled with 40 or so bats, was good for a creep.  When 
I saw the two leopards prostrated by the heat, I felt a little guilty about 
leaving my own cat to battle the rentless heat in Boston alone.  
Fortunately, I have a very short attention span.
<p>Later, a gaggle of geeks headed across the river to see <i>The League of 
Extraordinary Gentlemen</i>.  Even as a work of fiction, the script could have
been a bit more respectful to viewers who know the history of technology.  And 
there were plot holes wide enough to drive the Queen Mary through (the heroes 
stubbornly ignored obvious clues and portents so that they could put themselves
in danger <i>several times</i>).  And the actor who played the main villian 
(Professor Moriarty [yawn]) seemed utterly uninterested in this dog of a film. 
<p>Other then that, the movie was fine.
<p>I spent Saturday doing some recreational programming and attempting to 
do laundry.  There was a surprising amount of contention for the laundry 
apperatus.  I jotted down some ideas for talks I might give next year.  I'll 
try them at out on those poor, unsuspecting perl mongers near me.  If any 
of them are well-received, I'll pitch them to OSCON 2004.  I'm also considering
prefacing each talk with a 2-3 minute animation that features some of my music.
Bread <i>and</i> circus.  I think I can learn flash well enough to do this.  
Perhaps SVG also has tight integration between audio and visual components.  
<p>After a nap, I headed out for some pasta.  At the restaurant, two 
late-forties blonds, not unattractive but clearly <i>experienced</i>, were 
aggresively propositioning the waiter.  This flirtation struck me not as a 
gentle call for fun, but an ugly form of power-tripping.  For any server, 
it's ackward situation when the patrons ask for more service than you are 
prepared to give.  However as a disinterested third party, the scene 
added a delightful seasoning to an otherwise unremarkable meal. 
<p>I'm beat.  I write this on a bench looking across the Willamette River in 
the last rays of cloudy daylight.  I look forward to getting on that giant 
metal bird tomorrow and going home.  I had a great time at OSCON this year.  
Thanks to ORA conference staff and Gnat for once again birthing a seemingly 
flawless fiesta.  Portland, while not the ideal venue, proved to have more 
than enough local conveniences to make next year's OSCON a compelling 
destination. 
<p>One note: on the Portland-Chicago leg of the flight, a guy in my row 
passed out.  This necessitated that fabled cabin announcement "is there
someone with medical training on board?"  After a few moments of pure oxygen, 
the guy woke up.  The plane was able to arrive 30 minutes early under the 
rubric of a "medical emergency."  Edd Dumbill, in the row behind the afflicted 
passenger was involved in moving the semi-conscious bulk around a bit.  
Go, Edd.

If it's not something intrusive on my part, might I inquire as to what happened to his finger?

Tom sliced his fingertip while packing for the convention.  Nothing major, but very painful.

</p><p>Tom assaulted one of his middle fingers with a razor blade while packing for OSCON.  Tom told Sean Burke and I this and many other tales of mutilation that produced shudders of terror.  </p><p>Tom's one zany guy.</p>
