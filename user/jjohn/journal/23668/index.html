<p>--<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4350625.stm">Church fights Da Vinci Code novel</a>
<p>For a minute there, I though he was talking about the Bible!  Of course, he
was talking about something <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/jjohn/journal/22600">much worse</a>.</p>

<h2>Belief</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/pudge/">pudge</a> on 2005-03-16T03:28:12</h3>
When I first heard people arguing against The Da Vinci Code, I thought it was crazy too.  This is a fictional novel.  But it turns out a lot of people believes the crap in that thing, and as such, it seems worthwhile to point out it is what it is.<br> <br>Not that I am gonna spend *my* time doing it.  I have more important things to do, like play video games and watch movies.<br>



<h2>Rebutting Fiction</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/n1vux/">n1vux</a> on 2005-03-16T19:59:01</h3>
I thought Dan Quayle looked (or was made to look) silly when he attacked (the fictional) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Quayle#Vice_Presidency" title="wikipedia.org">Murphy Brown's morals</a wikipedia.org>, too.
But his point was well taken, it was a sign of a change in culture that a profesional character would be portrayed as intentionally becoming a single mom. If he wasn't known for sticking his foot in it, he might have been allowed a cultural allusion without being made to look foolish for it.

<p>In the instant case, though it is filed and sold as fiction, Dan Brown <i>claims</i> the book to be a thin novelization of history, and his book has made this modern anti-papist conspiracy theory (or the several that are shoveled together) more accessible and popular than the nominally nonfiction heresies and calumnies that he borrowed from. Thus it makes sense for the church to rebut it directly now.

</p><p>Art experts and historians are also <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/arts/4280383.stm" title="bbc.co.uk">up in arms</a bbc.co.uk>.

</p><p>The <a href="http://newssearch.bbc.co.uk/cgi-bin/search/results.pl?q=opus+dei&amp;scope=newsifs&amp;tab=news" title="bbc.co.uk">row over the real-world Opus Dei</a bbc.co.uk> <a href="http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&amp;ned=us&amp;q=opus+dei" title="google.com">is bad enough.</a google.com>

</p><p>It's amazing <a href="http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/defense/1227842.html" title="popularmechanics.com">what some people will believe</a popularmechanics.com>; given the range of conspiracy theories, this is just one more.
</p><p>
Cardinal Fang of the <a href="http://web.ukonline.co.uk/thursday.handleigh/humour/monty-python/spanish-inquisition.htm" title="ukonline.co.uk">Pythonic Inquisition</a ukonline.co.uk> would perhaps do a better job of debunking this farce than the serious minded ex-Curia member(s) appointed. Perhaps application of the dread Soft Cushions and the Comfy Chair would bring some sense to this lot.  At least the Art Historians are helping.</p>
