trader Enron, has become the first executive to be jailed
for his part in the huge financial scandal at the firm.
<br> ... <br> Meanwhile, former chairman Kenneth Lay and
former chief executive Jeffrey Skilling are under
investigation, but have not been charged with any offence.

proceeding against smaller officials, they will eventually

of disclosure might be to dissuade universities from using
double standards so blatant -- whether for legacies,
athletes, or racial minorities -- as to offend voters. A
second benefit might be to focus attention on the real
crisis in minority education: The average black 17-year-old
is academically less prepared for college than the average
white or Asian 8th-grader. A third benefit might be to
shame elite universities into seeking more needy and
working-class students, who are far more underrepresented
than blacks and Hispanics. Such "economic preferences" are
widely popular because -- if carefully designed -- they are
consistent with traditional concepts of merit. The hope is
that the hard work and raw talent of the best of these
needy students will enable them to catch up with college
classmates from more-prosperous backgrounds and better high
schools.&raquo; <p>--<a
