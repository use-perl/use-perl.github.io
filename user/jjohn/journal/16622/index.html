<p><p><b>An Epic Tale of Obsession, Magic and Basic Silliness</b><p><em>Part 2: The Waiting</em>
<p>To recap: after the long march to Loews and ensuing chaos, I finally got 
into the theatre in which all three Ring movies of Peter Jackon were to be 
shown.  
<p>It was about 9:30AM and I was already cheesed off.  I was cold, my 
breakfast had been prematurely discarded, I had been handed a document of what 
<em>not</em> to do during the movie and my hand was inky from the stamp
used by the theatre to thwart would-be gatecrashers (I later learned that 
just having the stamp or the ticket stub alone wasn't sufficient to prove 
that you were a legitimate ticket holder.  Both needed to be produced to be 
allowed back into the HALL OF VIEWING).  This was a lot of bureaucracy to 
handle outside the context of a job.
<p>The HALL OF VIEWING was on the first floor, conveniently located near both 
the restrooms and concession stand.  The HALL itself probably had a capacity 
around 500-1000 people.  Although the theatre was newly built, there was a 
kind of stage in front of the screen.  In the corner of stage right was both 
a podium and a table that I would later come to understand as Command and 
Control.  The HALL was about a third filled with the kinds of folks you'd 
expect at any all-day Tolkien event; lanky guys in their twenties 
with grimy hair and t-shirts; hippy chicks with dreadlocks; forty-somethings 
trying not to look awkward; Big-But-Beautiful girls clustered together 
(perhaps for fail-over purposes); college kids playing some kind of 
roleplaying game; a small host of elven princesses.  But, there were 
no hobbits, dwarves or wizards.  Ents were right out (this was another 
stricture of Loews).
<p>In short, these were my people. 
<p>My friend had staked out a prime location for our seats.  I would be 
shocked to learn that my seat wasn't dead center in front of the screen.  
On both aisle, several stern faced ushers were hunting for empty seats 
being held for ticket holders who had not yet arrived.  This was 
<em>verboten</em>!  
Perhaps some jackass was attempting to hold a whole row of seats for his 
buddies, but I don't think the theatre needed to organize goon squads to root
out the odd seat being held.  The HALL was two-thirds empty (or perhaps 
a third filled, if you think that way).  I made my way to Zorknapp.
<p>"Heya," I cleverly said. 
<p>Zorknapp handed me a menu with the following items:
<ul>
   <li>1 hot dog, fries and a 32 oz. drink: <b>$11</b>
   <li>2 hot dogs, fries and a 32 oz. drink: <b>$13</b>
   <li>2 32 oz. drinks and a 170 oz. tub of pop corn: <b>$8</b>
   <li>tiny pizza and drink: <b>$10</b>
</ul>
<p>What I didn't notice at first was that these items would be <em>delivered 
to your seat</em>, which explains the mark up.  Or so I thought.  It turned out
that the mark was only about one dollar compared to what one pays at the 
concession stand.  This menu was all part of the overriding meme for that
day of "not moving out of my seat."  While I read through the menu, Zorknapp 
dropped the bomb on me: the first movie would start at 1:15PM.
<p>"But it's like 9:45AM now," I observed.
<p>"Right," replied Zorknapp.
<p>"So what do we do for three hours?" I wondered.
<p>"We wait," Zorknapp said solemnly.
<p>I hadn't thought through all the schedule of events too clearly.  In my 
fantasy, the movie would begin in mid-morning and all the films would be over
by early evening.  This suggests that some unknown German heredity exists 
somewhere in my family tree.  I forgot that I was at An Event.  The theme was
excess.  Of course movie fans would wait in pre-dawn light to get into a 
theatre to wait another four hours (remember, I was "late") for the first 
film to roll.  What was my problem? 
<p>It turns out that this pre-movie lull was the best part of the show. 
<p>Settling into time-burning mode, I cast another glance over the crowd.  
In the row below me, a fellow wore a t-shirt with the Letterman-esque "Top Ten
Ways You Know You're A Tolkien Fan" (number 8: "you call your father 
'Old Gaffer'").  On my right, one elven maiden was explaining the construction
of her costume to an interested party (of which I was not).  From behind me, 
a patron exclaimed "Geez, they screwed up the crossword puzzle. They used 
'Cereborn' in place of 'Celeborn.'  Morons!"  I hadn't seen the crossword 
puzzle, much less attempted to solve it.
<p>A women in a chartreuse shirt and black pants made An Annoucement from the 
front of the HALL without the aid of a public address system (which was a 
mistake because she was unable to project her voice loudly enough for the 
room).  She reminded us of the extortionate menu items and tolds us of two 
pre-movie activities, a trivia contest and a costume contest.  Also, a raffle 
was being held whose prize was a copy of <i>Return of the King</i> signed by 
all the movie's cast.  The costume contest was on deck first.
<p>Once a panel of impartial judges were selected, the small host of elven 
princesses were lined up (as if in front of a firing squad) on the stage.  I 
was too far from the stage and too uninterested to hear the details, but 
appearingly an elf princess won the contest!  But I suppose all the 
participants were winners after a fashion.  The trivia contest was next but I 
took even less interest in that since it was done without the aid of a PA 
system.
<p>Chartreuse Girl really got on my nerves.  She made about nine announcements 
that day and that's approximately nine more than were needed.  She ended 
most of weakly spoken implorations with that most ubiquitous of expressions 
"are there any questions?"  Any graduate of high school knows that this is the
siren song of the wiseass.  Although our better angels prevented us from 
uttering our thoughts too loudly, our little group did have a few questions. 
Like where did elf babies come from?  How do elves go "downtown?" And, was 
Our Lady of the Green Shirt going to be around after the show?  
<p>Really, we slew ourselves. 
<p>Time passes quickly when making fun of others.  Soon, the first movie began 
and the audience was introduced to the wonders of advertising.
<p><em>Tune in next Monday for the final installment of Hail to the King 
in which jjohn actually watches the bloody movies.</em>
