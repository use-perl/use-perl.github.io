That's not true.<br> <p>Autistics, who are often retarded as well as being autistic, often can't tolerate certain food consistencies.  Spongy cake and messy frosting are two things that some can't stand.<br> </p><p>I've heard stories of extreme food obsessions with Autistic children such that the child will ONLY eat Chicken nuggets and French Fries from a given restaurant and only if they are cooked just so.<br> </p><p>Just when you thought it was safe to make a generalization...</p>

<p> <i>Just when you thought it was safe to make a generalization...</i>

</p><p>Zorknapp was quoting from a somewhat obscure TV show that feature a "book" (that turned out to be a cassette between the covers of what looked like a book) called "Retardation: A Celebration."  Neither he nor I am qualify to make medical opinions in public (at least in the US).  If you've never seen <a href="http://www.comedycentral.com/tv_shows/strangerswithcandy/" title="comedycentral.com">Strangers with Candy</a comedycentral.com>, do rent the first season DVD.

I never really liked that show, I just couldn't get past how much I hated the Jerri character.  Apart from that, it was good.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)
