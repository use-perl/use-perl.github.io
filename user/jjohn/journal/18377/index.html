<div class="span8">
<p><p>I just finished Richard Clarke's <em>Against All Enemies</em>, which is an insider's look at America's reaction to Islamic terrorism since
the Reagan years.  Many will recall that Richard Clarke was a top manager 
in the Counterterrorism Security Group in both the Clinton and W. 
administration, as well as being a perennial foreign policy bureaucrat since
the Reagan years.
<p>The book opens like a Tom Clancy novel: the White House has been evacuated, 
the Vice President has been removed to the East Wing bunker and a small group
of weathered staffers attempt to manage the worst terrorist attack perpetrated
on American soil.  Clarke is recalling his day at the office on September 11, 
2001.  All too often, I had to remind myself that this was a <b>non-fiction</b>
book; it seemed like a novelization of a Jerry Bruckheimer film.
<p>The author and the book have been much assailed by the supporters of W., 
which is a loss for the country.  Other books attack Bush in a clearly 
partisan way (I'm looking at you, Al Franken and Michael Moore).  This book
is different.  Clarke is no bleeding heart liberal.  He's most certainly not 
a pacifist.  Clarke is a reasonable intelligent man that's spent a good deal 
of his life studying and reacting to terrorism.  He was fighting the war on 
terror before it became the War on Terror.  In short, he's a very credible 
source of information.  He outlines many, many failures of the 
bureaucracy and the American intelligence community over the past decade.
Many of those still go unaddressed.  At the end of the book, Clarke presents 
his cogent argument of why the Bush administration's anemic invasion of 
Afghanistan and its baffling invasion of Iraq has critically damaged the 
effort to destroy al Queda.
<p>Supporters and detractors of W. must read this book.  Bush is campaigning 
on his record fighting Terror.  Clarke suggests giving W. a failing grade.
And so do I.

It's pretty clear that the timing and content of this book, coinciding with the beginning of the 9/11 commission hearings, is aimed at damaging George Bush.  If there were any objectivity in the media at all, there'd be an investigation of the "great left wing conspiracy" that <a href="http://209.157.64.200/focus/f-news/1105469/posts" title="209.157.64.200">pushes this book without revealing their financial interest in it</a 209.157.64.200>.<br> <p>If Clarke were the patriot he claims, why didn't he get this out as soon as possible?

The Clinton administration did essentially nothing to fight terrorism, save lob a few cruise missles.

If you can't see that this is just a political hatchet job, timed and orchetrated just in time for the 9/11 commission (itself timed and orchestrated before the election - remember the 'stolen' Democratic Senate memos that Ted Kennedy so upset about?), then I think I have very little chance of convincing you.</p>

<h2>Re: Clarke is clearly credible and not partisan</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jjohn/">jjohn</a> on 2004-04-18T17:50:43</h3>
<p>Citing Ann Coulter, in whose writing a bit of partisanship may be detected, isn't likely to sway my thinking.  Should I counter with Al Franken quotes from <em>Lying Liars</em>?
</p><p>Clark in April 2001, asked to be transfered to working on cyber security because of his frustration with the Bushies.  That transfer would have happened in October 2001.  Because of the events in September, Clarke had to stay on in the CSG longer than he had planned.
</p><p>Bush did not make terrorism the priority.  From what I recall of early 2001, Bush's priority was vacation.
</p><p>The entire federal government dropped the ball.  That's what lead to 9/11.  Since it happened on his watch, it's up to W to take responsibility for it.  That's what good leaders do.  Perhaps that's not entirely fair, but that's why he gets to sit in the Big Chair.
</p><p>It does appear that Clarke is supporting the Dems since he clearly feels betrayed by W.'s administration.  I don't call that partisan; it's democracy.  If a different Republican (like John McCain) was running in 2004, perhaps Clarke would be support him.  There's no way of knowing how that hypothetical situation would turn out.  Since that's not happening and Clarke believes Bush is a failure, I don't see what the guy can do but support the Dems.  He could disenfranchise himself by not voting, I suppose.
</p><p>Clarke served in more Republican administrations than Democratic ones and for a longer time.  He was furious at "elder" Bush's ending the war before destroying all of the Iraqi Republican guard.  He cites serveral examples of Clinton's antiterrorism failures, but the Sudanese offer to deliver bin Laden is an urban myth.  At the time the head of Sudanese regime Turbi and bin Laden were "ideological soulmates."  Sudan offering up bin Laden would be like Tony Blair offering up Henry Kissinger to the U.N. for war crimes.
</p><p>However your claim that CBS was hyping Clarke's book for their own gain doesn't seem unreasonable.  I'm unlikely to defend the honor of CBS.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)
</p><p>If you want to beat down on the presidents who ignored terrorist, take a look at H. W. Bush's non-reaction to PAN AM's 103 attack or Reagon's non-response to the Beruit attack that killed 200+ marines.  Clinton's counterterrorism efforts may have been flaccid, but they were far more vigorous than those of his predecessors.
</p><p>All of this political rancor detracts from the real debate: are we wining the war on terror?  Does the U.S. foreign policy of W reduce or increase the supply of terrorists?  Ultimately, time will tell.  Clarke's assertion is that the invasion of Iraq was a collosal misstep that will further radicalize the Middle East.  It's hard to see that happening now.
</p><p>BTW, the next book I'll be reading is Hans Blix's <em>Disarming Iraq</em>.</p>

<p>My biggest beef about Clarke is that it took him a whole year to come out with this and it happens to coincide with #1 a book release and #2 a presidential campaign.</p>

<p>I have watched the 9/11 hearings and there is just too much stuff that doesn't jive with what Clarke said. That may be on both sides. This is politics. But Clarke's timing makes him super suspicious in my view.</p>

<h2>Release of the book</h2>

Well, it takes a period of time to write a book and he is a first time author. He also had to have the book screened by the White House, national security and all. He submitted the book to the White House around September last year ( maybe November ). The White House sat on it for something like 3 months.<br> <br>Also, I doubt he has much say when the book is actually released, the publisher does. I think I saw somewhere the published was intending on have it out some time in April. I think the published saw an opportunity to get some extra sales by publishing before the public hearing portion of the 9/11 commission.<br> <br>Clarke is a 30 year bureacrat. He knows how to judge where the wind blows. I think he saw that Bush wasn't keen on terrorism and wanted to move to cybersecurity (his plan for that sucks in my opinion). If nothing else, this book along with Suskind's (info provided by Paul O'Neill), and comments made by the guy whom was to head the faith-based initiatives show that this administration isn't good at making policies that make sense.

He should have been talking about this right out of the gate. Yet it takes him a year to make it known? That has nothing to do with "writing" the book.

<em>The White House sat on it for something like 3 months.</em> <br> <br>Most people know that I abhor the current administration, but in all fairness to the White House, doing book reviews is probably not a high priority.  Further, for intelligence agencies to vet the book and ensure that Clarke was not illegally revealing classified information probably takes some time.<br> <br>Also, though I again reiterate how much I despise the current administration, I don't hold Bush and Co. responsible for intelligence failings regarding terrorism.  They inherited a mess (that started long before even Reagan was in the White House) and they had plenty of other issues to worry about.  Of course, since I've not read Clarke's book, I could be dead wrong on this matter.  The "Bin Laden determined to Attack the United States" memo may have been a clue.

<em>The author and the book have been much assailed by the supporters of W., which is a loss for the country.</em> <br> <br>It's a loss for the country that his assault against Bush's Iraq war had to be intertwined with his analysis of the events leading up to 9/11.  Clearly, his emphasis on Bush's failures pre-9/11 is tainted by his anger with Bush over his Iraq policy.  Even some of the Democratic members of the 9/11 Commission essentially conceded this.<br> <br>Look at most of the egregious claims made by Clarke.  They are mostly about interpretation (Rice looked like she had never heard of Al Qaeda, Bush thought terrorism was "important" but not "urgent").  Yawn.<br> <br>He addresses various intelligence failures, and then points the finger at Bush, despite the fact that they were preexisting conditions.  He blames Bush for not accepting his Jan 25 recommendations, and doesn't make much mention of the fact that Clinton and his staff (Cohen, Reno, Albright) all rejected it too, and then he says under oath that there was no chance it would have prevented 9/11 anyway.<br> <br>His final analysis is that if Bush treated the problem more seriously, then perhaps we would have discovered the plot, but the Commission hearings have proved that both the FBI and CIA were treating the problem very seriously, so there was precious little more that could have been done in terms of intelligence.<br> <br>I agree that Clarke is a credible source of *information.*  I disagree strongly that he is a credible source of *analysis* in regard to blame.<br> <br> <em>The entire federal government dropped the ball. That's what lead to 9/11. Since it happened on his watch, it's up to W to take responsibility for it. That's what good leaders do. Perhaps that's not entirely fair, but that's why he gets to sit in the Big Chair.</em> <br> <br>That's true, but the problem is that Clarke is blaming Bush and giving Clinton a pass in public.  I am all for giving Bush the blame, but not the next step, which is saying Clinton did a great job, and would have done better.  That's nonsensical garbage.<br> <br>I don't know if you've read much of my <a href="http://slashdot.org/user/pudge/journal" title="slashdot.org">journal on Slashdot</a slashdot.org>, but my whole thing is that we should all realize that some people -- particularly Ashcroft and Clarke -- are clearly biased, giving one side of the story, and that the others are mostly covering their own asses (including Gorelick!), and the bottom line -- what the Commission is going to report -- is that everyone messed up, especially the intelligence agencies and lawyers in their procedures, and the politicians in their lack of urgency.<br> <br>This applies to ALL the intelligence agencies, and ALL the politicians.  Clinton had terrorist threats, including domestic hijackings.  Why didn't he put stronger security in place?  I am not trying to deflect Bush's due blame, and there is much of it, but this has turned, on the part of many, into a partisan witchhunt to make Bush into the big failure point, when we know that apart from treating the problem MORE urgently than Clinton, by changing existing procedures about information sharing and security in airports etc., he was not going to stop 9/11.  And there is no reason to think Clinton would have prevented it either.<br> <br>And yes, of course Bush is to blame for not seeing what was happening and doing those things.  But the question we must ask when evaluating him politically, is whether Clinton would have done better, whether Kerry would have done better, whether Gore would have done better.  And I can't see how anyone can, with any reasonable certainty, say yes.<br> <br> <em>Clinton's counterterrorism efforts may have been flaccid, but they were far more vigorous than those of his predecessors.</em> <br> <br>Only because the terrorists finally attacked our own soil.  It's unfair to compare pre- and post-WTC attack of 1993, just as it is unfair to compare pre- and post-9/11.<br> <br> <em>All of this political rancor detracts from the real debate: are we wining the war on terror? Does the U.S. foreign policy of W reduce or increase the supply of terrorists? Ultimately, time will tell.</em> <br> <br>Yes.  And I think we are winning, and it will reduce the numbers and effectiveness of the terrorists.  You and Clarke disagree.  But none of us knows.
