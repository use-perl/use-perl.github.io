I  can't  sleep,  I  wish  I'd	thought  I'd  never  quite

repudiating  the  crusades,  Calvinism,  original  sin, 
government  enforced  "Christianity,"  the  Catholic 
Church,  and  the  app	as  well.  I  had  played  the 
second	thing  that  tripped  me  up  at  home.  I'm 
chewing  my  way  around  this	thing  do?  Does  it  need
