<div class="span8">
<p><p>I slapped together another demo, this time of a song called <a href="http://taskboy.com/music/breaking_the_frames_demo.mp3">Breaking the Frames</a>.  It's a protest song written about and for the Luddites of early nineteenth century Britain.  The Luddite "revolt" was the response of apprenticed Nothingham weavers to the practice of factory owners installing weaving machines called frames and hiring unskilled labor at reduced wages to work these contraptions.  
<p>However, the story of craftsmen being steamrolled over by technology is far from a historical concern.  Today, the outsourcing tread of large businesses to move programming jobs overseas is probably the most familiar example of this phenomenon to readers of use.perl.org.  What my song attempts to capture is the brave and utter futility of fighting this kind of "progress".  Life is  about adaptation and adaptation is often painful.
<p>This song is part of series of thematically related songs labelled "encode".  You can listen to this series through <a href="http://taskboy.com/music/encode.m3u">this playlist</a>.</p>

<p> <i>I need to get my songs up on deathtongue</i>

</p><p>Yes, you do.

</p><p>Maybe we could setup a tricked out version of Apache::MP3 there for you, Nate and me.  With a little effort, we might set up a CD-on-demand service.  I haven't investigated the economics of this yet, but if we do the CD production and shipping ourselves, we might be able make a little
a little cash.

</p><p>I'm just spitballin' here.


</p><p> <i>mp3.com is teh suck</i>

</p><p>Yes, it is.

</p><p>I used to see mp3.com as an outlet for indie music, but I'm unconvinced that's its mission these days.</p>

Yeah, they actually took down several of my songs because I don't give them money.

Universal fired all mp3.com employees after another sale of mp3.com failed... <br>

A rumor I heard is that the founder might want to buy it back for an egg and a pickel from U-V.<br><nobr> <wbr></nobr><strong>/neuroball/</strong> <br>
