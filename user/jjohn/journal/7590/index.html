<p><p>I know you <A href="http://www.farscapeweekly.com/cancelled.htm">read this on slashdot</a> too, but damn this is important. It's sad to see such a great show leave the air, but I suppose this is the way of all flesh. At least I'll get my friday nights back.
<p>Feel free to mourn here.</p>

Not that I have SciFi any more thanks to the yotzen at AT&amp;T--, but still.  One less reason to get DirecTV I guess.

I can't believe this isn't made up spam. This just isn't possible!

I told you that they weren't going anywhere with this season's plot <a href="http://use.perl.org/comments.pl?sid=6890&amp;cid=10558" title="perl.org">line</a perl.org>. I would prefer to be wrong and the show still be on the air.<br> <br>But at least, as you wrote, I get my Friday nights back. Too bad SG-1 is kind of sucking and Jeremiah and Odyssey 5 are thrasing about story-wise.<br> <br>I guess I'll continue assuming the worst when it comes to the media making "good" decisions about shows and such. I loved "The Family Guy" and was sort of getting to like "Greg the Bunny".<br> <br>The more "reality" programming that is programmed is more time for me to surf for other crap or just give up and start reading more.

<p> <i>I told you that they weren't going anywhere with this season's plot line [perl.org]. I would prefer to be wrong and the show still be on the air.</i> <br> <br> </p><p>Did you see episode (411) called "Unrealized Realities"? Many of the  random events and pointless episodes are tied together. Season 4 has not been as immediately satisfying as Seasons 2 and 3, but then the context of the Season 4 is very different too. Also, the title of that episode turns out to be a fitting epitath for the show itself. <br> </p><p>"Alas, poor Yorick! I knew him, Horatio: a fellow of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy: he hath borne me on his back a thousand times..."</p>

<i>Did you see episode (411) called "Unrealized Realities"? Many of the random events and pointless episodes are tied together.</i> <br> <br>I did see it. I liked it. Too bad that is probably the last episode. It kind of felt a little like the last episode of ST:NG. Lots of, "you determine time-space with your thoughts" stuff.<br> <br>It would be really great to have some followup episodes UR.<br> <br>At least it can give me a reason to start disliking SciFi channel I suppose.<br> <br>"I am making haste, or could it be that haste is making me", Bad Religion, "Supersonic"
