<div class="span8">
<p><p>I'm experimenting with the effect of various mic placements around my Fender 65 Deluxe Reverb in order to get a more bitchin' tone in Sonar.  
Fans of 80's hard rock/synth bands will no doubt be encouraged by 
<a href="http://taskboy.com/music/eddy_van_hagar.mp3">this clip</a>.  There
are a few things hampering my tone quest.  First, I live in an apartment where
excessive noise is frown upon.  This means that I can open up the volume pot
as much as I'd wish.  This is a problem because much of the charm of a tube amp
comes from the saturation achieved by attenuating the volume knob.  The next
problem stems from the age of the amp: the power cord isn't grounded.  Not 
only do I receive the occasional shock when I'm wearing my plugged-in guitar
and touch other powered equipment, but I get an excessive amount of noise in 
my signal (which you can hear plainly in this track).  The last problem is 
that the tubes in my amp need to be replaced (there are 6 of them).  I have
already placed an order for what I hope to be bitchin' replacements.  Tube 
technology is a funny mixture of science and voodoo.  Although computers have
long sinced abandoned them, there are two professions that show
little sign of moving away from these little vacuum heat generators: musicians
and the military.
<p>This wayward son carries on.
<P><b>UPDATE:</b>  Here's a rough mix of this fragment as part of an original song called <a href="http://taskboy.com/music/give_it_a_rest.mp3">Give it a rest</a>.  Also note that I've remixed <a href="http://taskboy.com/music/monkey_v_robot_jjohn.mp3">Monkey v. Robot</a></p>

<p>Why do the military still use tubes?</p>

I believe the military still uses tubes in places where EMP immunity is important and it's impracticle or impossible to fully protect the equipment in other ways.<br>
