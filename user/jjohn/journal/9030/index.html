<p><p>I'm working on a game similar to <a href="http://www.rtsoft.com/fq/">Funeral Quest</a> (an upgrade to 
which is due soon). It's a turned-based web game based on UFOlogy 
(go with what you know, I say). I'll have details on the game some.
Naturally, the game is written in Perl.
 
<p>The game includes a single-threaded web server implemented with 
Gisle Aas' HTTP::Daemon Class. It's single-threaded because I want to 
allow users to run the server on Winders, should they choose to and 
I couldn't figure out how to use threads or ithreads (am I supposed to 
have access to ithreads?) on win32. 

<p>For simple tests, getting a file or a small web page, HTTP::Daemon works
fine. The problem started when it attempted to serve a web page with 
15 images on it. When the server tried to server the third file (an image), 
I'd get a 'broken pipe' error my server would halt. As I worked to isolate
the problem, I found that the error was coming from this simple loop in 
HTTP::Daemon::ClientConn::send_file:

<pre>
    while ($n = sysread($file, $buf, 8*1024)) {
        last if !$n;
        $cnt += $n;
	print $self $buf;
    }
</pre>

<p>As I step through this code in the debugger, I found that after the 
second iteration $self (a kind of IO::Socket::INET object) would choke.
Bummer. I tried changing from print to syswrite, but that didn't change the 
behavoir at all. 

<p>I turned to Google.

<p>Digging around, I found this post from 1997:

Add:

   $SIG{'PIPE'} = 'IGNORE';

to your script.
</pre>

<p>Sure enough, that seems to do the trick. An early hack I thought of 
that sort of worked was:
<pre>
$SIG{WARN} = sub { exec "/usr/bin/perl $0" };
</pre>

<p>This restarts the server on a broken PIPE error. Unfortunately, the 
file that choke the server wouldn't get sent. 

<p>It would be super if Gisle added this little gotcha to his HTTP::Daemon
man page. If not, I'm sure others will find this journal page when they 
Google for a solution, as I did.

<p>Guru advice is welcomed. Any thoughts on why the server connection chokes?
It looks like some kind of I/O buffer is getting full. Because I can 
safely ignore the signal, I'm guessing that the I/O that trigger the signal
gets cleared and more traffic is accepted on that socket. Is this some kind 
of race condition?

<p>Also, should I abandon the fantasy of expecting perl 5.6.1 threading to
work reliably on both Linux and Windows? 

<p>You guys are the best...

<h2>Perl 5.6.1 threading</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/samtregar/">samtregar</a> on 2002-11-20T06:34:28</h3>
Yes.  Immediately abandon the fantasy of getting 5.6.1 threads stable <i>anywhere</i>.  Perl's threading support isn't even close to stable until 5.8.0, and even then there are a few problems left to deal with.  I wrote <a href="http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2002/09/04/threads.html" title="perl.com">an article about threading in Perl</a perl.com> that you might find useful.
<p>
As for the problems you're having with HTTP::Daemon...  Have you considered posting this as a question on <a href="http://perlmonks.org/" title="perlmonks.org">PerlMonks</a perlmonks.org>?  If there's a better answer out there, surely the monks know it.

<h2>Threads in 5.6 are bad, Win32 5.8 has ithreads</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/sky/">sky</a> on 2002-11-20T08:27:00</h3>
5005 threads and ithreads in 5.6 are just broken, to get atleast working threads you need 5.8 with ithreads.<br/><br/>I would bet that most win32 6.8 users have ithread enable, the default makefile enables them, and so does ActiveState to allow for psuedo-fork to work.

Although AS Perl does have a kind of fork(), I understand that process creation is very slow on Win32. That Threading isn't really happening on 5.6.1 makes me feel less stupid for not getting it to work right.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)
