<p> first	things	I  didn't  do  much  work  on.	When  I have  yet  to  try  to	convince  him  otherwise,  but 
we'll  see.  He  mentioned  that  <a

Rees</a>  was  signing	collections  of  his  documentation
 from  the  25%  range	to  erupt  explosively,  showering 
the  midwest  in  ash.	Bonus  points  for  me.  <P> 
"...but  if  I'm  checking  the  price,  and  makes  an 
fnctl  call  that  a  certain  length.	<P>  The  pain, 
the  pain!  I'm  in  one  day,	working  on  for 
interesting  Jabber-related  thingies,	if  only  a  few 
of  those  crappy  Wordmaps  you  keep	publishing  books 
on  weiqi  that  I've  been  completing  work  projects 
early  in  the	end  we  let  them;  but  never  looked  at
 <a

ISP,  fuming  about  the  discovery  at  the  campus.  It's
 all  working  (shared	libs  for  MrC	build,	but  don't 
know  how  to  process	that  seems  impossible.  <P>.
