I keep liking MarkovBlogger more and more...<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
<blockquote><div>Then Peter and the [other] apostles answered and said, We ought to obey God rather than men.</div></blockquote>
It's not often that I'm referred to in the same sentence as that.  I would call this a "groovy" thing, but I've been advised by folks older than myself that I'm not allowed to use that term.
