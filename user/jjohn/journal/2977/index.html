<p><p><a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0079501">Mad Max</a> is a seminal sci-fi flick of the late seventies. I enjoyed Road Warrior and tolerated Thunderdome, but I had never before seen the movie that started the series. Tonight on SCI-FI, I got a chance to correct that.

<p>What a terrible film! The worst dialog I've heard coupled with some powerful overacting. And could the movie move any slower? I doubt it. 45 minutes to set of one dimensional characters is unforgivable. Ick! I had such high hopes for this campy classic. Oh well. There's always Blade Runner.

Yep.  I have mixed emotions about <i>The Matrix</i>.  But it's proof that the highest praise imaginable in the sci-fi genre is "this movie is the next <i>Blade Runner</i>".
<p>
Now, if only someone could come up with the next Twilight Zone.  Those productions are 40 years old, and the writing is still fresh and crisp.  The new Outer Limits has it's moments (but there's always a bear to write into the script), and the new Twilight Zone had a couple of good stories.  But very little has come close to Rod Serling's brilliant storytelling.</p>

Let's clone Serling, Lovecraft and Poe and force then to write kick-ass sci-fi for television. Clone Talent Now!

Actually, I'd be happy if we got more (and better) stuff out of Ray Bradbury and Harlan Elison.  (Gibson is way overrated.)  And, perhaps a few more Philip K. Dick stories[1] converted into screenplays would be nice (but not lame ones like Total Recall 2070).
<p>
Then we can talk about cloning.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

[1] isn't there a persistant rumor that Ubik is being converted into a movie?</p>
