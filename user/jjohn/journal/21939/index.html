<div class="span8">
<p>Thanksgiving time is here again, and that means <a href="http://www.altonbrown.com/">Good Eats</a>.  A Johnston family 
favorite of these festive food days is snow fudge.  As my mother doesn't do
as much baking as she once did, I thought I'd take a crack at laying down the 
fudge this year.  Here's the recipe:
<p>Software:
<ul>
  <li>2 C white sugar 
  <li>3 TBSP of Corn syrup (Karo)
  <li>1/4 C of butter (1/2 stick)
  <li>1/2 C of cream or evaporated milk (1/2 a 12oz can)
  <li>1/2 C of peanut butter
  <li>1/2 C of Marshmellows or Marshmellow Fluff
  <li>1 pinch of salt (Kosher is best)
  <li>1-2 tsp of vanilla extract
</ul>
<p>Hardware:
<ul>
  <li>5-7 quart pot or sauce pan
  <li>a wooden spoon
  <li>8x8 square pan
  <li>A mixing bowl 
</ul>
<p>Over low heat, melt the butter.  Don't burn it.  Integrate the cream.  
Slowly add the sugar in while stirring.  This makes a syrup.  Raise the heat 
until syrup boils.  Reduce heat to medium-low so that your syrup is bubbling, 
but not burning.  You are trying to reduce the syrup a bit. 
<p>There are several thoughts on how to determine when the syrup is done 
reducing.  The classic one is called the "soft ball test," in which a small 
sample of the syrup is dropped into a glass of ice water.  If the syrup 
congeals into structured globs of goo, the syrup is down.  The more scientific
approach is to boil the fudge for 3 minutes with the pot lidded.  Reduce heat
to a simmer.  Heat until syrup is 234&deg;F.  I sort of eyeball it.  Getting 
the syrup right is the key to the fudge's final structural integrity.  Luckly
you, the peanut butter covers up a multitude of incompetance. 
<p>Once the syrup is done, remove pot from heat and let it stand for a few 
minutes.  This stuff is lava-hot.  In the mixing bowl, gather the 
peanut butter and marshmellows (or Fluff).  Sometimes a quick stint in the 
microwave makes peanut butter more amenable to moving.  
<p>Add the syrup to the mixing bowl.  Mix until blended.  Some people will 
like a less homogenized fudge than others.  This is controlled by how much 
you mix the fudge at this point.  I go for the full-on integration.
<p>Pour contents of mixing bowl into the greased 8x8 pan.  Butter works best, 
but Pan will do.  Remove pan to a cool, dry location, like your gargage or 
window sill.  Let fudge sit for 30 minutes until cool to the touch.  
<p>When solidified, dump fudge onto cutting board and cube into 1" blocks. 
Test the batch with samples until satisfied. :-)
<p>Yield: about 2 pounds
<p>Cook time: ~15 minutes
<p>What's sad is that I had enough ingredients left over to make 
chocolate fudge too.  That's basically the same recipe, but with semi-sweet
chocolate chips in place of peanut butter.  I used about 2 TBSP of corn syrup
and I think that was too much.  Use only 1 TBSP.   I'd also suggest using only
1/4 C of marshmellow too.  When I've got a good recipe for chocolate fudge, 
I'll post it here.   I think I'll need to use cocoa power rather than solid 
chocolate.  I made a mean chocolate syrup with cocoa power once...
