It's interesting to see the tradition in which the people you refer to [those that call question Chomsky's loyalities] choose to place themselves. The idea of leaving America because one opposes state policy is another reflection of deep totalitarian commitments. Solzhenitsyn, for example, was forced to leave Russia, against his will, by people with beliefs very much like those you are quoting.

<h2>Anti-American</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/pudge/">pudge</a> on 2003-01-03T22:12:17</h3>
Few things make someone "anti-American."  The obvious one to mention is if you want to violently overthrow the government of the United States, although even this is highly context-dependent (violent overthrow of the government is major tenet of the founding document of this nation).  And you could similarly say that being against fundamental American principles -- such as the violent overthrow of an oppressive government, but more often being against things like democracy, free speech, etc. -- is being anti-American.<br> <br>But like most other labels, such as "terrorist", it is merely a label that doesn't really hold much depth.  Oh well.<br>
