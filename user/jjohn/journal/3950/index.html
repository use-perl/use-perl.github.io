<p><p>On VirtualTourist.com, these <a href="http://www12.virtualtourist.com/North_America/USA/Massachusetts/Boston/?s=j&TID=8#go">warnings</a> are given about traveling in Boston. Notice how most of them say "don't drive there." This bolsters my case for making non-professional driving illegal in Boston. Only business vehicals should be driving in the city. Everyone else can park in Brookline, Netwon, Cambridge or Braintree
and take the T in. This may seem draconian, but I assure you everyone will benefit from this. </p>

I agree 90% with you. Driving in Boston is a nightmare, and the parking is even worse. Of course, it doesn't hurt that the neverending Big Dig really screws things up. But Boston drivers generally suck. And it'a a never ending cycle, because to get anywhere in the city you have to pull the same tactics. Otherwise you'll never get anywhere.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-(

The Big Dig doesn't seem to have made much difference in the traffic that I can see. It's still near-suicidally insane to drive in Boston, just like it was before the Dig.<br> <br>Fun, though. (But, then, I knew someone who was a cabbie in Boston, and I always follow his driving advice<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

<p>The Millenium Dome had some goofy exhibits but one of them was on transportation. The exhibit had some really cool features but one was a line of answer kiosks where the monitor would ask you and 10 other people a question and post the answers on the backdrop. To the question "Should passenger vehicles be banned from urban areas", I answered yes...and it was the only yes on the panel. Cars create congestion, pollution, noise, etc. but to do this would mean cheating the cartels from oil and car money and investing in *gasp* public transportation.</p>

<p>Boston drivers aren't the worst, they're just the most aggressive and drive the bigger cars. One day, I will return to Boston in a Sherman Tank and return the favour to the SUV muthah fuckahs.</p>
