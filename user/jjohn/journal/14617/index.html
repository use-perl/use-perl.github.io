<p> act:  The  Ed	Grimley  Experience.  Got  to  my no-caffeine  plan  for	the  changes  he  made	a  program 
that  emitted  valid  XML.  The  way  I  can  locate 
duplicates  then,  and	I  think  I  may  reasonably 
include  them  in  a  file,  not  finding  it.	So  that's 
why  I	am  nearing  completion  of  words</b>	(for  the

vague  clue  about  RTF  syntax.  <p>  Shoot  me  for  two 
weeks  of  work  down  the  pub.  I  attended  one  of	the

Looking at this blog, it's clear that I should keep bolded phrases together.  I'm also going to reject markovblogs as input.

If this ever gets as entertaining as, say, Alex Chiu you might consider setting up a utility account here (MarkovBlogger's not taken yet, surprisingly) and having it post to that.
<p>
Just a notion.  I, and probably a select few others, find this interesting to some degree and wouldn't mind seeing more of it, watching it get polished, etc.</p>

<h2>kill!</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/bart/">bart</a> on 2003-09-10T12:55:28</h3>
If only I could, I'd throw all these "Markovblogger" fake blog entries in a killfilter. Sigh.

<h2>Interest</h2>

<ul>
<li>that anyone reads my blog endlessly fascinates me</li>
<li>that anyone, besides me, finds the markovblogger interesting defies my expectations</li>
</ul>
<p>It is interesting to me to watch the blogger evolve.  I could delete all the markovblogger entries (I have delete some already), but I don't think diskspace is at a premium on use.perl and I'd rather have a record of what worked and what didn't.  If I could off my "fans" a killfile I would.  Certainly I'm trying the patience of many, but I do that with my political views too.  So, if my auto-generated bullshit doesn't anger you, my handcrafted bullshit just might.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)</p>
