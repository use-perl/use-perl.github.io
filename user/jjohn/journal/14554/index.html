<p><p>I've just got a couple of pointers, I tried again. Ifutzed around with slice sizes for a short time before I
finally got it the way I wanted, and ultimately installed
it. Unfortunately, when I selected FreeBSD via the BeOS
bootloader, it just hung. <P> So I tried *again*, except
this time it froze in the middle the software installation
on a package called <I>cvsupit</I>, or something like that.
<P> I'll try again tonight. Maybe it's time for someone
else to herd the cats. I told the group a couple of
pointers, I tried again. I futzed around with slice sizes
for a short time before I finally got it the way I wanted,
and ultimately installed it. Unfortunately, when I selected
FreeBSD via the BeOS bootloader, it just hung. <P> So I
tried *again*, except this time it froze in the middle of
some kind of maintenance. It was blistering hot and the 2
year old boy did not react well to the environment.
Everyone was tired and frazzled, and after dinner they went
home to recover.<P> I BOFfed around a little, but mostly
spoke to people about the projects I'd outlined in the Perl
Apprenticeship talk, and people.
