<p><p>I just noticed that the London Perl Mongers review the <a href="http://london.pm.org/reviews/xml_rpc.html">XML-RPC</a> book. Thanks to Dean Wilson for a pretty balanced review.
<p>As the author of the ASP/COM section, I'd like to take a minute to answer a valid criticisim of that chapter that Wilson raises:
<p><i>My only disappointment with this chapter is that
            it relegates the mention of the COM based XML-RPC library to two paragraphs
            tucked away at the end of the chapter and does no more than acknowledge its
            existence and provide a link. Adding another small section covering its use with
            something like Visual Basic would have been a welcome addition. </i>
<p>At the time of that book's writing, the COM XML-RPC library looked moldy and forgotten. I was none too keen to drive people to use it. I don't have Visual Studio, so I couldn't really experiment with that library anyway (which would have required a C++ compiler, I believe). When the next edition of the book comes out, I'll see if we can't flesh out that chapter a bit more with more Windows Tech (eek!).
<p>Wilson also pointed out that I mixed a fair amount of Perl into that chapter. I had two reasons for doing so. The first reason was didactic: I wanted to stress the language independence of the protocol. I would have like to have seen more of that in the book, actually. The second reason is that I wanted to reach out to Unix bigots like myself who might see XML-RPC as a way to control Winders boxen without haven't to do much programming on them. XML-RPC has the potential to create easy remote admin tools -- very useful for controlling point'n'click environments from a remote unix shell. ;-)
<p>Thanks again to Dean Wilson for taking the time to review the book. </p>

<h2>Visual Studio</h2>

I actually have Beta 2 of the Visual Studio<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.NET framework, if you're interested.  It was only $12, but I don't think they offer it any more.  Be warned that it's 4 CD's, takes 3 GB, and Win2k (NT choked on it when I tried it).
<p>
Oh, and I highly recommend giving Visual Perl a shot (from activestate.com) if you're willing to give it a try.  It's pretty sweet.

Gimme a holler at djberg96@attbi.com if you're interested.</p>

Yes, you heard correctly - 3 GB.  I couldn't tell you everything that came with it.  All I really wanted was Visual Studio so I could play with Visual Perl.  It really is sweet.  I ain't shelling out the bucks for it, though.  Besides, I do most of my work in Unix.
