At work, we have a big application on production under mod_perl and Pipeline.pm which is leaking. And when I mean leaking, I mean it is a massive flood.
<br>
Something had to be done about it.
</p>
<p>
I tried several modules available. Devel::Leak and Devel::LeakTrace. They sound interesting, but I already knew there was a memory leak. And Devel::LeakTrace depends on glib and doesn't install on my box.
</p>
<p>
Any way, I figured out what I really needed. I want to scan variables for circular references and have a report of where they are. If I can obtain a reference to a circular refence somewhere in perl, then I can dump it and I can figure out what it is.

So I released to CPAN Data::Structure::Util which does just that. You give it a data structure and here you go, it tells if there is a circular reference and where it is. I hacked a script to scan through all the global variables and I could find in 5mn exactly where was our memory leak!
We fixed it, then I redid the same process and sure enough we found another circular reference generating a memory leak.
Then the 3rd time, I found a circular reference in Template Toolkit. But this one is harmless, since TT does break the circular reference when the object is not needed. So it doesn't generate memory leak.
<br>
We have no more memory leak in our code (or at least nothing significant)!
</p>
<p>I have the feeling we are about to fix many memory leak in CPAN modules in the near future :-)
</p></p>

Please see the bug report I filed on rt.cpan.org for this functionality.  The circular ref detection can be fooled by a combination of strong and weak references to the same thing.  If it sees the weak reference first, it will not detect any other strong references.<br> <br>If you have some code with a lot circular refs and are trying to get rid of them all through the use of weak refs, this can be a problem since you might miss some strong refs but still think you're done.

Hi,
I've replied on CPAN.<br/><br/>Thanks
