<p>I've used Yahoo's TV listings for years to keep track of the TV sports schedules (which is about the only thing I watch on TV). Initially, it was a nice, simple static grid layout. A few months ago, they decided to fiddle with AJAX, and the result was a mess, but tolerable.
<p>

So today I go to check what games are on and am greeted by <a href='http://tv.yahoo.com'>this pile of shit</a>.<i> Careful, AJAX disaster ahead!</i>

Completely dysfunctional. And infected with the Herpes Simplex of the web, Flash, too. And apparently, there is no interest in offering a Sports only category; after all, no one actually uses TV to watch sports...<p>

I've noticed a serious decline in the quality of Yahoo services of late. Perhaps Google has pilfered all their best people ? Or they just don't give a damn anymore ?<p>

I suppose I don't have the right to bitch about their service, since it doesn't really cost me anything. And perhaps its a blessing in disguise,
since I guess I'll have to dig up that half finished XMLTV script to get what I want.<p>

But it is a shame that the former paragon of the 'net has declined to such a nadir.</p>

I saw that this evening when I tried to see what was on TV. I've started looking elsewhere for a simple tv listings grid. I think that was the last feature of yahoo that I used, so now I'm Yahoo! free. It didn't take them long to screw up all of the services of theirs that I used to use.



<h2>tv.yahoo.com</h2>

I agree.  (1) Even over broadband, it was slow to load.  I found the same thing true with the Yahoo Mail beta -- and when they asked for my feedback I informed them as such.  (2) I too miss the grid.  (3) I only watch/tape one show on television.  I decided to enter its familiar name in the search box:  "Ebert &amp; Roeper".  The result:  "We did not find results for: Ebert &amp; Roeper."
