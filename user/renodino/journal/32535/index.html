<p><a href='http://www.presicient.com/sociable'>Thread::Sociable</a>
is progressing well. All the scalar, array, and hash basics work, 
and performance is about double threads::shared for equivalent operations 
up to about 4 threads (on a uniprocessor Win32 machine). At 8 threads,
things start getting interesting, and 16+ threads really expose the
threads::shared global lock penalty. The coming weekend's
multiprocessor tests should provide even more interesting benchmark
results.<p>

Locking tends to equalize performance for a single
shared/sociable operation inside the lock scope...but the perfomance
delta rapidly improves with each additional operation inside the lock.<p>

Once the embedded queueing implementation is complete,
and Thread::Apartment is updated,
apartment threaded method calls should be much snappier.<p>

The addition of a tie-like capability (required to complete
<a href='http://www.presicient.com/tkthrd'>Tk::Threaded</a>)
will enable some intriguing applications: when thread A writes to a sociably tied
scalar, threads B, C, D, etc. can all fire their own STORE() methods.
What a multithreaded FETCH() means remains a bit of a puzzler
(some sort of sequencing interface is needed so thread A
can decide which of thread B, C, and D's FETCH() ultimately
gets applied ...)<p>

Some additional observations:

<ul>
<li>the resulting XS code could make a nice template for 
an equivalent mapping to IPC shared memory, assuming
a decent shared memory heap manager can be found (no more
Storable freeze/thaw overhead!) (but will require a 
IPC equivalent for ithreads mutex implementation).
<li>ditto for memcached ?
<li>while I'm an STM skeptic, random thoughts at 2 AM
lead me to suspect Thread::Sociable could be
extended to implement that as well.
<li>Definitely need some benchmarks running this on top 
of <a href='http://www.hoard.org/'>Hoard</a> on an SMP box.
</ul>

Stack tuning solved part of the footprint issue. Thread::Sociable
hopefully trims much of the fat from shared variables. Wish I had
the lore to do iCOW...</p>
