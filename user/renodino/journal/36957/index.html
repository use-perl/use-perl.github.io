<p>As a condition of accepting my new overlord's dominion, I requested they pay for my OSCON trip this year,
to which they graciously agreed. (I'm even getting paid for being there! And finally get to stay at a
decent hotel instead of slumming it.)
<p>
Alas, as they're footing the bill, I have to devote my attentions to their particular business interests,
which aren't Perl (though I've been stealthily infesting it where I can). So Perl sessions/tutorials are
almost completely absent from my OSCON schedule this year. Gotta learn Python (ugh), Eclipse PTP, and more
on Actors. The TDD tutorial looks Perl heavy, but we'll see. The rest of my schedule is databases,
databases, and more databases. I'll try to steal a couple sessions for Perl stuff (esp. Tim B.'s
fancy new profiler stuff), but the few spare slots I have also have some nifty Javascript sessions,
and I've recently been <a href='http://www.presicient.com/shodo/tryshodo.html'>splashing</a> <a href='http://www.presicient.com/plotjax/tryplotjax.html'>about</a> in that pond - there's lots of kewl and sexy stuff going on there,
so I gotta get me some more.
<p>
I see the Perl monks are planning an ad hoc gathering Wednesday, hopefully I'll be able to hook up.
And somehow I have to get over the river to the OBF and back before Mssr. Wall's annual Onion. Or maybe after.
Or maybe both ;^}
<p>
And then some R&R with friends in Seattle, and a leisurely camping meander back to Reno.
<p>
While the price of gas is definitely gonna hurt, its a such a great road trip through the 
Sierras, Cascades, and Siskiyous (assuming it hasn't all burned down by now) in the topless
Jeep that I can't bring myself to fly. So I'll grin and bear it...but mostly grin.
