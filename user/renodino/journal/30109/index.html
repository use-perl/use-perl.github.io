<p>I've just survived 8 long weeks aboard the slave ship 
"Java" and its harsh master JDBC. 4 weeks of javadoc'ing 
the most trivial of methods (we really need *2* methods to read
an integer from a row ?), of implementing support for
the silly garbage that apparantly roamed about the 
drug addled brains of the architects of this crap.<p>

Several years ago, I made the mistake of listening to
some soul suckers that said, "why don't you make a
JDBC driver of that Perl driver you wrote for &lt;DBMS&gt; ?"
I refused repeatedly, but the Java market climbed and 
beckoned. So, drawn by an apparent demand that eventually 
never materialized,  I conceded and created a JDBC driver.<p>

<b>Worst decision of my entire professional, if not
personal, life.</b><p>

I charged what I thought an outrageous amount, yet,
managed to attract enough customers early on to believe
it may have been a good idea. But 2 years later,
I learned a hard lesson: Java users demand all, and deliver
little. A few customers demanded support worth at least 10x
what they paid. I lost untolled nights of sleep fighting
with that scourge of a language. Every day felt like
a disaster waiting to happen.<p>

Fortunately, I've just released the last release, source
code included, and now feel as though I'd been aged an extra
10 years in the past 4, and, having rid myself of the scourge,  that I've been granted a fresh
10 years in recompense, including some strands of lost youth
(I think my hair is actually get less grey!).<p>

So hopefully this will be a cautionary tale, and
a testamonial to how much better Perl is than those
languages that the elitists like to trot out
to refute Perl's efficacy. I'm living empirical proof: 
Java Kills; Perl abides.<p>

And now I'm going to get drunk for 3 days, and then sleep 
for 3 more.</p>
