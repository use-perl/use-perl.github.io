<p>Life has conspired against my efforts to
get Thread::Sociable into CPAN shape. Perhaps its
for the best: a little time away gave me a bit more
perspective and time for more research. Plus,
OSCON seems to be threads/parallel processing
heavy this year, so I hope to pick up a few ideas.
<br>
<p>

One interesting development: I finally found a 
decent process-shared memory heap manager, with 
a friendly BSD license: 
<a href='http://grail.sdsc.edu/projects/appleseeds/'>AppleSeeds</a>
(part of <a href='http://grail.sdsc.edu/'>Grail</a>). 
Which gave me cause to refactor things
a bit to support pluggable storage mechanisms.
Which, in turn, means Thread::Sociable will
(eventually) support both thread *and* process 
shared variables, including for STM, and in the same
app (via a weak 2 phase commit operation).<p>

Another interesting development: I'm sitting in the pthreads 
tutorial at the moment, and turns out Intel is announcing something
important at the tutorial I'm attending tomorrow, and it may
provide an STM implementation. Of course thats only working for
Intel (and AMD), but if its FOSS, it might be portable.
Should be interesting, and might be a nice candidate
for Thread::Sociable.<p>

Hopefully, I can find a nicely open source DSM
soon. Then things should get really interesting.

Hey,<br/><br/>sorry to tell you, but appleseeds isn't under a BSD license according to their webpage. It's under a free for education, research and non-profit license. You still need to pay them for commercial usage.
