<div class="span8">
<p>I've been coding for 30 years...since I built my first computer
(ELF II) about the time Steve & Steve built theirs. I've used
binary toggles, hexpads, paper tape, punchcards, FORTRAN,
C, Java, Lisp, Pascal, COBOL, PL/I, SQL, and of course Perl.
(thankfully, I've managed to avoid C++ except for a few  brief 
stints) amd more assembly languages than I can count
on fingers and toes. I've written operating systems, written 
code for some of the largest MPP systems assembled, and been 
involved with some of the early internet video and VOIP startups.
<p>

And I only recently have had my socks blown off. <p>

As in smoking embers where my socks used to be. <p>

My home entertainment system had been showing its age:
the universal remote was the first to give up the ghost.
Then the DVD player started dropping segments of MP3 CDs.
And it was time for DVR. I'd been casting about for
a solution. I'd seen little snipptes about Mac Mini's
as media center solutions. but everything I knew about 
CPUs and power dissipation led me to disbelieve, even 
tho I've had an iMac DV for 6 years. <p>

So I'm strolling thru the local COSTCO and see Mac Mini
bundles - w/ Bluetooth keyboard and mouse, and OS X 10.4 -
for $699. Oh, and 11g builtin. But they're the G4 model
(the beefier 1.5 GHz version, but PPC nonetheless). However,
as I need PPC compatibility testing for some of my products,
my judgement acquiesces to my curiousity, and I buy. <p>

After 15 minutes of ferocity tearing apart the oppressive
bubble plastic, I jack one of my LCD screens into this cute little brick,
and fire the little puppy up. After refreshing itself from my 11g
network, its up and running. I dump all my ripped CDs in about 5 
minutes. "Hmmm, this is just toooo easy". <p>

Of course I open the terminal to verify our dear friend Perl
abides...and am pleasantly greeted by Mssr. Wall's name, and
a nicely recent version number (5.8.6). <p>

But alas, I don't have a DVI TV. Never fear, a quick trip
to COMPUSA and I acquire not only the requisite SVideo adapter, but
a nice little IR remote to boot, all for under $55, incl. tax. <p>

So now my media center is reduced to a tiny brick, a sizeable
receiver, and a couple aged (yet outstanding sounding) Dahlquist
speakers (I'm listening to some sweet Hawaian slack key guitar 
as I write this). The remote seems a bit finicky, but Keyspan
seems a noble enterprise: OS X *and* Linux support, and even a 
Developer's link. (Hmm, maybe its time for some IR remote Perl 
modules ?) <p>

So I listen to a few of my ripped CD's (mostly acoustic: Bela Fleck,
Stan Getz, Chris Thile...), and am astounded by the quality
compared to my old DVD player. <p>

Then I break the out the DVD's: Three Pickers, and Big Lebowski.
Wow, I'm hearing and seeing things the old DVD player never
produced. <p>

And the Mini never made a sound. Not a whimper. Not a Whirrr.
Not a peep. <p>

It was actaully quieter than the old DVD player. And don't get me
started on what my 2.4 GHz laptop with XP Pro would do
with even a single track of music ripped at 192 Kbps. <p>

So I am officially impressed. I mean *really* impressed.
Until now, I've considered Mssr. Jobs and Apple a bit of a foolish
enterprise, primarily targeted to the "art school confidential"
audience. <p>

The intent of this lengthy diatribe ? Its primarily
intended for me. <p>

Because what Apple has done in the last few
years is nothing short of astounding. And no, I'm not talking
about iPods (Sony actually had that market several years ago
but goofed up w/ bad pricing and bad s/w). The PC as central
home entertainment *and* information appliance, all packaged
in something you might mistake for a doorstop, is sheer brilliance.
And it took guts. When everyone else figured the only market
was 19 year olds needing a substitute for their manhood
(see also Alienware), Apple slipped behind enemy lines. <p>

This is for me because I occasionally get disheartened
when working on things I know to be really important,
but which the current landscape of computing "best practices"
deigns to be foolish. E.g., "SQL bad, PHP good". <p>

Hence my title: "Persistence of Vision". <p>

Apple and Steve Jobs knew where they were going...and had the guts and
patience (and yes, money) to persist. And now they, and all of us, 
are reaping the rewards. They've redefined the whole concept of "home computing". <p>

Which is a drastic comparison to Microsoft. "XP Media Center" ? Can you say
kludge ? Or maybe just "ugly" is sufficient. Either way. it s broken,
and pales in comparison to the entire Apple expreience. Apple just
works. XPMC barely functions. <p>

Microsoft is all but dead. No vision. Period. The vulture
has run out of prey. No, I'm not a a Microsoft hater.
Frankly, I don't care about OS's, I've written and
maintained enough OS's to know there's nothing
much left to see there. But Mssr. Ballmer sounds more like an empty brown
paper bag blowing in a high wind than a visionary.
It wasn't the SEC/FTC/Justice Dept. that did them in. It was a culture
of "just enough to sell something". A shame actually, given their
massive resources. Not to mention the brainpower they've been paying to
just sit in fancy offices, or sail around the Puget Sound...just to keep
them from working for someone else. <p>

Now if only Elgato hadn't run out of EyeTV 250's so soon... <p></p>
