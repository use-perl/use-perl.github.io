<h1>There must be a word for this...</h1>

<div class="span8">
<p>I've experienced this far too often, and I know everyone else who has ever
laid hands on a computer has experienced it. So there must be a word or
acronym for it.
<p>
Essentially, its the intersection of Murphy's Law and PEBKAC.
<p>
E.g., I'm currently helping someone build some s/w on Windows.
He's a Linux hacker, and quickly gets frustrated by the Windows
"everything has to be a GUI" imposition.
<p>
Now, when I personally built this particular package, I had no problems.
But I've been hacking Windows for years, and know how to install/setup
Visual Studio by rote.
<p>
So when my protoge encountered difficulties, I was at a loss. Until I learned
he had all manner of crapware on his laptop. And 2 versions of Visual Studio.
And the wrong version of the software to be built. And was missing one of the prereqs.
<p>
And so, after scrubbing his system, I walk him through the build process. But I can tell
he's frustrated, and he has other responsibilities, so he's also a bit distracted.
<p>
Then I get his latest email listing the errors issuing forth from
the build process. I know he's probably fuming at this point, and probably
suspects I'm a part of this diabolic conspiracy to thwart his progress.
<p>
Then I point out that he's fatfingered an extra quote in the initial command
line, which subsequently causes Perl and the generated makefile to do various
bizarre, non-Windows things.
<p>
After correcting his mistake, he's now progressing nicely. But I'm certain the 
experience has further prejudiced him against Windows, and probably Perl, despite the
fact that neither suspect is particularly culpable for his frustration.
<p>
So is there a word for it ? Perhaps the opposite of "serendipity" ?
Roughly defined, its the act of making a personal error which you blame on the
machine due to having previously experienced numerous machine induced errors.
<p>
If there isn't a word for it, there certainly should be. And there should be at
least one expletive embedded in it.

<p>Why don't you invent one?  To do that you should make one up, collect 20 similar stories, and publish it somewhere.  Then encourage people to adopt it.</p><p>One option is "confirmative blame".  And the exact definition is that it is the tendency to confirm our pre-existing biases by wrongly blaming some one or thing.
