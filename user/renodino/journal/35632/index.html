<div class="span8">
<p>For <a href='http://use.perl.org/user/renodino/journal/34444'>"Tired of Perl Is Dead FUD"</a>, 
I generated a 
<a href='http://www.presicient.com/langjobs.html'>simple chart</a>
of Perl, PHP, Python, and Ruby job listings. It generated a lot more interest 
than I expected.
<p>
One of the common comments went something like, "Yeah, but
there's no Perl jobs <i>in my backyard</i>".
<p>
Which aggravated a chronic itch I've had since first
releasing <a href='http://www.presicient.com/dbdchart'>DBD::Chart<a>/
<a href='http://www.presicient.com/dbixchart'>DBIx::Chart</a>
several years ago: how to support some kind of GIS
visualizations. I've occasionally had users ask about
GIS support, but it seemed like such a huge challenge that
I've always begged off.
<p>
All the online mapping services are about "geo-location";
I'm interested in "geo-intelligence".
<p>
So when people asked "yeah, but where are those jobs ?", I decided
to scratch that itch.
<p>
I found <a href='http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?GD::Map'>GD::Map</a>,
but its interface and rendering weren't quite what I wanted.
So I've created
<a href='http://www.presicient.com/gdmapmerc'>GD::Map::Mercator</a>.
(Alas, I still haven't figured out how to integrate it into
DBIx::Chart, but the experience helped me better understand the issues)
<p>
With that, and a Javascript widget I've been working on for
another project, and a bit more detailed screenscraping, I've
whipped up a <a href='http://www.presicient.com/langjobs/usajobs.html'>
Dynamic Language Jobs Map</a> that provides some relative indicators
of where those jobs are, along with a drill-down breakout of the Javascript,
Perl, PHP, Python, and Ruby job counts. <i>(Sorry, USA only; free/open,
current detail GIS data for other locations is hard to find)</i>
<p>
Note that I've added Javascript to the list, because
its become increasingly important to <i>me</i> personally,
and I suspect it either already is, or soon will be, important to 
other dynamic language users.
<p>
The cosmetics are still a bit rough in spots (despite minor intervention
with Microsoft Paint), but hopefully its a bit more insightful. I'd hoped
to get a deeper drill down using area code GIS data, but I've been unable
to locate a free/open source for the data (if anyone knows of a source of 
such data, I'd be grateful if you passed along the info).
<p>
I'll try to update the data every couple of weeks; I've imposed on DICE's
hospitality a bit more than I should; hopefully they'll continue
to be gracious about my occasional scraping.
