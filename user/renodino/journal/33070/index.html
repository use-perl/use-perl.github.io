<p>...and the dwarves keep tossing axes.<p>

"Gee, I've got all this scaffolding here, STM should be <i>easy</i>
to tack on!", says I to myself, proudly wielding my shiny new
Thread::Sociable package as I dive headlong into the mire.<p>

I'm now 2 solid weeks into some serious C hacking, and I've <i>almost</i> 
got the code done, though the original Sociable package is now in a 
bit of a shambles.<p>

I've worked on the internals of massively parallel systems, reverse
engineered protocol stack drivers from machine code, and written
real-time operating systems in assembly. But this STM stuff is
quite possibly the most mind-bending task I've ever encountered. (maybe because
the "avoid premature optimization" rule can't really be applied,
cuz Sociable is <i>all about</i> optimization.<p>

With every line of code, I peer into the abyss of trying to quickly restart
a transaction without inducing deadlock or livelock, and without
eating the entire heap, all while desperately attempting to maintain
the performance illusion - at least within a couple orders of magnitude -
that its all just simple in-memory accesses.<p>

Admittedly, scalars aren't too bad. If the sequence number
is current, and, if needed, the thread can grab write ownership,
the thread-private contents can be merged into the shared version
toot-sweet. Even restart is pretty simple: just toss away the 
private version and start over.<p>

STM for hashes is a bit pesky, but, since hashes carry significant
overhead anyway, I'm not all that concerned about performance or memory.
In reality, merging STM into hash support isn't too bad (tho a bit memory
intensive): just a bit of list surgery.<p>

But STM for arrays is a damnable nuisance. The mounds of code needed
to manage all the possible transactional operations has become
a Tower of Babel. Array access is supposed to be <i>fast, dammit!</i><p>

Yet, as I duct tape ever more code onto the pile, my "code at the traces"
persona cringes at the thought of someone loading up a 10,000 element
array and iterating over the whole thing inside a transaction...esp.
when there are 10 or 20 other transactions trying to do the same thing
to the same array at the same time.<p>

Oh well. The code is nearly done, tho I've got a lot of repairs to
get Sociable back to baseline functionality. Then the Aegean
stable of testing/debugging STM begins...<p>

One upside: glueing this underneath DBD::RAM should make for an
interesting little multi-user main memory database.</p>
