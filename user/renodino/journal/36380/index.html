<div class="span8">
<p>Its been a wild ride while it lasted, and I certainly
learned a lot, not just about s/w development, but
mostly about business. But after lone wolfing for several
years, I've thrown in the towel and taken up with a
database startup.<p>

Alas, I'll be doing very little Perl for my new job;
lots of C/C++, and my new overlords seem to have fallen
pretty hard for Guido's koolaid, so I'll need to write
a Python indenter <sigh/>. While I'll inject Perl
where I can, I fear it'll be an uphill battle, and
avoiding those is why I succumbed to captivity
in the first place.<p>

OTOH, I'll be doing stuff I've been doing for the better
part of 20+ years, stuff I can do without getting out of bed,
much less falling out. And I have a few notions I hope
to inject into the product suite; the database field is starting
to get crowded again, and anything we can do to differentiate
is going to be essential to success.<p>

And they're letting me do it from Reno, which was a big
condition for me. The California thing lost its
luster for me years ago; I especially revile
the SillyConJob Valley nonsense. I live 10 miles
from the CA line...and thats plenty close enough for me.<p>

I also made them pick up the tab for my OSCON attendance, so I'll
actually get to stay at a decent hotel this year!<p>

What really made me steer back into the database maelstrom
was the crew manning this startup. Some of them are
almost iconic in the DBMS world, and they've been very succesful 
in the past; some others I've personally known for a decade or more.
Hopefully, the cumulative experience will be enough to climb
over the other startups massing around this particular
niche. I commented to the VP of Engineering that, if the
DBMS s/w didn't pan out, he could just pimp us all out as consultants
at $300/hr and probably make more money!<p>

That said, I am suffering some separation anxiety. Working on
what *I* wanted to *when* I wanted to was fun, albeit
frustratingly difficult/impossible to monetize. I've spent
most of the last 5 years banging out Perl and (recently) Javascript,
only doing XS/C when conditions demanded; now I'll be slogging
thru mind numbingly slow and (esp) error prone C/C++ development.
Hopefully I'll endure long enough to collect the gold ring.<p>

In the meantime, I'm desperately trying to get 
<a href='http://www.presicient.com/sociable'>Thread::Sociable</a>
into at least <i>compilable</i> shape and uploaded to a Google
Code repository I setup some months ago. Unfortunately, life
keeps getting in the way, so progress has been very
slow. Its a damn shame I can't get paid to finish that up. I 
really think it would make a nice splash for Perl: faster shared access, real STM for real threads, and even shared nothing for those that prefer it,
plus (for those that hate on ithreads) all that for process shared memory (without the Storable or DBM contortions of existing solutions). Hopefully, some 
others will attempt to grok my XS/C hacking and take up the cause.
While I won't be tossing commit bits around like beads at Mardi Gras, 
I'll certainly open things up for those that express both an interest *and*
the skill to comprehend it (the STMness gets pretty gruesome
in places).<p>

Oh well. Its my last weekend of independence, and another beautiful
Sierra spring day, so I'd better get out and enjoy it before
I jump on a plane on Monday.</p>

Congratulation with your new job. If you can't Perl, it's OK to SQL.<br><br>One could see it as evidence that Perl jobs are getting harder to get though, if perl enthusiast have to code Python. But at least it's not PHP, and C/C++ has its place from time to time.<br><br>God luck. Is it Postgres based?

I don't think thats a proper extrapolation (tho it is a bit ironic that the keeper of the <a href="http://www.presicient.com/langjobs.html" title="presicient.com">DLJB</a presicient.com>
is crawling back under the C/C++ rock). I did talk to some Perl shops, but this DBMS gig found me, and came highly recommended by people I trust. So
it was the path of least resistance.</p><p><p><blockquote> <div><i>Is it Postgres based?</i></div> </blockquote> <p>

Sorry, I don't know what I can say, so I'd best not say anything.</p>
