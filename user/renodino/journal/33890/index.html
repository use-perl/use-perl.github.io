<p>Keynotes: Pretty good. Transactional Memory was far too brief, but
appears to have gotten the audience's attention. Intel's TBB
appears more marketing than product. The Ubuntu interview
was interesting.
<br>
<p>

Sat thru <a href='http://www.greenplum.com'>Greenplum</a>'s talk. As 
someone who's been playing in the MPP sandbox for 20+ years, the stuff 
they're doing really intrigues me. (Think API for automatic parallel 
decomposition over petabyte datasets).
I may have to hit Luke up for the job I turned down a few years ago.
<p>

Then Xquery+XForms. Alas, the speaker seemed unaware he only had
40 minutes, so much of the meat got truncated. But I need
to revisit the whole XQuery thing I've thus far dismissed.
<p>

Nested data parallelism was interesting, tho being Haskell specific,
was perhaps a bit impractical. However, it does dovetail nicely with the 
Greenplum talk; I wonder if they've looked into it ?<p>

Then a quick talk on <a href='http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/'>YUI</a> CSS by webchic. Definitely gotta add
YUI to my toolkit.<p>

I then collared Simon Peyton-Jones for a quick chat to help get my mind right
about the stuff I'm doing for STM in Thread::Sociable. Lots more
to read and (I fear) to implement. But I think I've got the basics right.
I can cheat on "orElse" operator with a simple boolean "acquire()" method; not perfect,
but usable. I/O remains a challenge, tho I've vague notions about writing
a PerlIO layer to support thread ownership and buffering for such things.
That will likely wait until the 2nd or 3rd release. A transactional queue may
bridge the gap for tte time being.
<p>

The Javascript Performance talk was a high-speed adrenaline fueled affair, with
conclusions I had come to already (i.e., Dojo/Scriptaculous/et al are great, but
too fat...so get out the trimming knife), and also some new ideas (remove the DOM
head before hacking up the DOM...gonna have to try that with those
monster PPI::HTML[::CodeFolder] documents).<p>

Lastly, the Machine Learning with Perl talk was far too brief. Great insights,
but not enough meat. Would've been nice to see more on how he used PDL.<p>

Looks like Thrusday's DBI BOF @ OBF is a go. Should make the
later lighting talk sessions more enjoyable.
</p>

that sounded like an interesting talk. so what solution come out of this talk to speed up js performance?<br><br>never been to oscon, will the slides be available in a central place?
