<p>The first tutorial was on Intel's Threading Building Blocks.
(TBB) (recently open sourced) library.
Alas, the sort of threading problems they're solving
won't be of much use to anyone using a VM. Which, at OSCON,
is most of us. But I'll give their read/write spinlock a
looksee; I'd been pondering using such for Thread::Sociable's
STM. And the concurrent hash and vector constructs might
be usable as well, tho Intel is much more concerned with
keeping a "hot" cache, upon which VM's will be throwing ice water.
I didn't even bother asking about transactional memory support,
which will definitely cool off the cachelines.
<br>
<p/><br/><br/>Data Mining Open APIs: much more about data mining
than Open APIs. Note to self: never eat the turkey sandwich
for lunch before attending a 2 hour talk on statistical
analysis in a darkened room. The Python examples
illustrated the computational brute force approach to deta mining.
And seem completely devoid of code that manages the collection/cleansing
of the data. Definitely *not* a solution for ad-hoc
OLAP. But wrap the API access as a storage engine, add in some 
SQL::Statement, and all that code turns into a single SQL statement.
Then we start JOINing between SOA's. And maybe toss in a bit
of <a href='http://www.presicient.com/dbixchart'>charting syntax</a> 
for chuckles. Ah, if only I had the time. The best take away
was the link to programmableweb.com/apis. Maybe need to scrape these sites and derive schemas (WSDL should be a nice start)<br/><br/>
