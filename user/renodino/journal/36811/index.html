<div class="span8">
<p>I got an itch this AM to see how the <a href='http://www.presicient.com/langjobs.html'>DLJB</a>'s 
numbers were holding up after nearly a year.<p>
After a few queries on <a href='http://www.dice.com'>DICE</a>, I discovered that "Rails" is now officially 
a synonym for "Ruby": there are nearly 50% more hits with the two words than with ruby alone. So I've 
adjusted the DLJB scraper accordingly, and Ruby's numbers are much more respectable.<p>
I also did some searches on a few other languages (Erlang, Haskell, Groovy, Lua, and Lisp) to see how 
they're faring. Pretty well, it turns out, esp. Groovy (lookout, Ruby and Python, objects in the mirror may 
be closer than they appear...). So I've added a new "Others" datapoint to the chart.
<p>
Alas, one troubling note: Perl's general numbers have eroded slightly (about 6-7%), though the "titles only" number seems 
to be holding up well. PHP is still growing at a steady clip. Python seems to have plateaued. Maybe Google 
AppEngine will breath a bit more life into it. (I know I'm going to have to learn to stomach Guido's indentation, 
as my new overlords have adopted it for their test environment. So my OSCON will be Python heavy this year.)
<p>
On a positive note, however, the overall numbers seem to be holding up quite well, despite the current economic 
woes here in the US.</p>
