<p>Well, I thought I'd try out Tux - Red Hat's Content Accelerator. It's a kernel module that handles HTTP requests. If it doesn't want to handle the given request, it palms it off to the normal httpd (typically Apache).<br/><br/>My setup's perhaps a bit odd. Perhaps not. Apache with mod_perl handles about 5 virtual hosts, each with its own Mason handler (due to the need for different component roots).<br/><br/>Component root wise, the server looks a bit like:<br/><br/><pre>
/www/sites/_host_/html/
/www/sites/_host_/mason/
/www/sites/mason/
</pre><br/><br/>So, first pages are seen and I can hide any non-pages away into either the site specific component area or into the global root for components shared between sites.<br/><br/>Perhaps this is a common way to set it up. No idea.<br/><br/>Anyway - with that all running on normal ports (since I didn't want to take the server offline merely to play with Tux; and the new backup hasn't arrived yet), I enable Tux to listen on a port (the port I specifically have unfirewalled so that I can play with alternate server stuff) and to put any unknown requests through to Apache.<br/><br/>Typically, people set mod_perl up with a dual Apache system: light weight proxy instance, and the heavy weight mod_perl one. Makes some things more efficient. My thought is that Tux should be able to do broadly the same thing and with less hassle.<br/><br/>And it does. But not for me. For some reason, when the request is passed to Apache, the fact that the request is for a virtual host appears to be forgotten and is passed to the default virtual host handler. Hmm. Maybe it's not really happening that way and I just need to set up virtual host handlers for some strange port number. I tried setting up handlers on both 80 and the test port (on the grounds that Tux would get the first go anyway). Nada.<br/><br/>So I've gone away for a bit to think.<br/><br/>While going away, I decided to rejig some pages I'd been meaning to rejig for slightly over half a year. Removed a lot of crufty HTML from them (they were initially based on the university's new standard for web page look) and refactored some of the gadgets and groupings into separate components.<br/><br/>So rather than an unsightlyish blue and yellow scheme (university colours and almost the Hall's colours), it's now mostly white and grey and blue. Very clean looking. And I moved the quick links from the left to the right. That'll be the bit that throws everyone =) Other than that, everything else is the same, it just looks different.<br/><br/>Took the opportunity to remove some of the custom time handling code and replaced it with <i>Time::Piece</i> usage. That's a sweet module.<br/><br/>Hmm. Back to Tux.
