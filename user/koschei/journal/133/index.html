<p><p>Hmm. A little while since my last entry. Slightly over a month. The joy of getting ever so slightly swamped in work.</p>

<p>What's been happening? Well, let's see:</p>

<ul>
<li>I've not finished that email yet.</li>
<li>I <b>have</b> read and replied to a number of other emails (around 100  or so).</li>
<li>Not really progressed much further in my reading.</li>
<li>Assessed, or at least helped assess, the testability of four SRS documents. Exciting stuff that.</li>
<li>Written two pages in the <a href="http://brucehall.anu.edu.au">Hall's</a> newsletter, <i>Ignis Draconis</i>, detailing the state of the computing facilities and also how to find one's MAC address and report it back to me.</li>
<li>We need the MAC for accountability with our DHCP server.</li>
<li>Be nice if Samba WINS played nicely and let Win2K machines browse the network.</li>
<li>Erm.</li>
<li>Completed an assignment or two.</li>
<li>Fed 250 or so A3 sheets through a photocopier manually because it doesn't like them going through twice (not that it's meant to; it clearly says to not do that in the documentation).</li>
<li>Bought a copy of the Masterpieces of Infocom</li>
<li>Added more features to the <a href="http://brucehall.anu.edu.au/afl/">AFL Tipping</a> pages. Even more to be added later.</li>
<li>Other stuff probably.</li>
</ul>

<p>We're trying to upgrade our network here at Hall to cope with the required capacity. So we've spent a merry week trying to get admin to get some more hubs. I tell a lie: we spent a few months doing that. At long last though, I have 5 hubs sitting on the chair next to me, all of which shall be plugged in during the weekend. Of course, we wanted 30 cables as well and were only given 10, but we're assured the rest are coming soon. Really.</p>

<p>Um. Have to go now. It's a few hours later than when I started this entry but I was waylaid while writing it. Explain later.</p></p>
