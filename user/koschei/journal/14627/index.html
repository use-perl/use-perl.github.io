<p><p>I'm disappointed in the vi/vim part of "<a
href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/regexppr/">Regular
Expression Pocket Reference</a>" (new from ORA).  It's not
very thorough. It does, at least, mention vim and list some
of its more common bits of syntax, but it doesn't go far
enough. It doesn't provide a full summary of the vim's regex
options. Which is a shame because, out of the flavours
covered by the book, it's the most different. The others are
all more or less the same with minor quirks.</p>

<p>A vim reference should at least try to cover it all.
That said, vim has excellent builtin help (<tt><a
href="http://vim.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/pattern.html">:help
regex</a></tt>), I was just hoping for a more complete
reference on paper, in a nice little book.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the perl section didn't seem too bad
(note that I'm the guy who contributed <a
href="http://dellah.org/pod/perlreref.html">perlreref</a> to
5.8.1). Points of interest: gives a nice reference to the
Unicode properties (I think Perl's docs is missing a nice
comprehensive list, expecting you to look elsewhere); it
notes the different return values of the operators/functions
in scalar vs list contexts; isn't aware of the changes in
Perl to make <tt>$`</tt>, <tt>$&</tt>, and <tt>$'</tt>
faster (though the outer two are only faster in a blead
compiled with copy-on-write (as far as I can see); the
composite unicode properties to character class equivalent
mapping is somewhat more enthusiastic; the references don't
mention a lot of the perl docs that I do; doesn't mention
the \p{IsSpacePerl}. Other than that, quite good =)</p>

<p>Also, it doesn't cover Ruby regex, which have some
amusing quirks of their own (in particular, the meanings
applied to <tt>/s</tt> and <tt>/m</tt>, and the way Perl's
<tt>/m</tt> is on by default, thus meaning <tt>^</tt> and
<tt>$</tt> are often the wrong thing to use).</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I've been collecting links and such for
various regex related bits and have put a wiki page
up on <a href="http://iain.truskett.id.au/?RegEx">the
topic</a> in <a href="http://iain.truskett.id.au/">my
kwiki</a>.</p>
