<p><p>It's surprising how easily and quickly <a

<p>No doubt it could be written more clearly, but even with the basic
translation it's nicer than the Java version. For a start, the routines
are now methods on Arrays. Damn sensible place to keep them, although I'm
sure several of the 4 readers of this post will disagree (including myself
depending on the phase of the moon).</p>

<p>Secondly, it's type free.[1] This is a good thing.</p>

<p>Thirdly, think about this code in Perl. What would be written differently?
Would you be tempted to have another parameter, a comparator? What would you
do about the difference between comparing strings and numbers?</p>

<p>Enough of this for now.</p>

<p>[1] I'm sure there's a better, or more correct, term ('independent', 'agnostic',
something), but I don't know it. Feel free to comment it.</p>

<h2>Changing the core</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/acme/">acme</a> on 2003-03-24T02:37:19</h3>
Some of the neatest Ruby examples I've seen add methods or modify methods of the core classes. It's certainly neat and pretty clean. But what happens when multiple authors of the modules you happen to be using all muck about with the core in different, slightly incompatible ways?

It all goes to hell =)<br> <br>Generally, if you're modifying a class that isn't yours then you<br>should only be adding stuff that's really generic. For example,<br>a binary search to Array.<br> <br>Otherwise, you should be making your own Array subclass.<br> <br>I wouldn't be surprised if someone's already implemented<br>a bsearch (in fact, I think Hal Fulton has one in "The Ruby Way").<br>Ideally someone would be collecting these useful generics into<br>a package, somewhere. Think List::Util =)<br> <br>But, yeah, it can go to hell.<br>

<h2>Polymorphic comparators</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/pdcawley/">pdcawley</a> on 2003-03-24T12:07:02</h3>
I think it's going to be possible to create multimethods in Perl 6 that'll allow you to write smart comparators along the lines of the smart match operator, which should in turn allow for you to write a nicely generic binary search method on Array.<br> <br>Doesn't help with Perl 5 though.
