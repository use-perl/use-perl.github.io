I convinced XS to le tme export a string with NULs
in it.  Of course, I had to push it onto the stack
myself, but nevertheless I'm happy I worked it out
=) Would've seriously hindered <tt>tai_pack()</tt>
otherwise.

</p>

<p><b>Bad news</b><br />

The machine which collects my mail, and serves my
websites, and other assorted things developed a
disc fault the other day when some idiot turned it
off without shutting it down.<br />

Unfortunately, I didn't notice it had disc faults
until the disc was semi-corrupted. As of today,
the disc map is hosed. (Regrettably, there wasn't
anything much I could do with it in the meantime
to fix it; it's not a convenient machine,
geographically speaking.)<br />

Thankfully, I had some backups (albeit not too
recent with the exception of the web part), and
the machine also had two drives (one for / and one
for /home --- it's the / one that's buggered).<br
/>

So I guess I'll be spending part of the weekend
reinstalling the system. Joy.<br />

Oh, and it's the machine that the books site was
on, so that's definitely going to be a bit delayed
until I get the machine up and running. (Although
the stuff is on the good drive, it's hard to get
stuff off it until I'm physically with the machine
and can take it out.)
