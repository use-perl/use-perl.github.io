<p>I had my first french lesson tonight, which was fun. I have never learnt another language, so I am not really sure about the whole process, however I can see that learning the gender of all the nouns may take me a while. I plan on calling up my mother regularly, who used to be a french teacher, to subject her to my terrible attempts at this beautiful language.<br/><br/>Going to the class ment I missed the Sydney PM meeting with Dave Cross, which was the first since I joined the list. Hopefully they will have another in the near future which is better suited to my ample free time.<br/><br/>Oh and this entry is also to test the fix by Pudge (not that I don't trust him) has made for the SOAP comments bug. If it works, comment should be disabled for this entry. If not, it probably just means he has not  implemented it on use perl yet.</p>

<h2>It should be working now</h2>

I updated useperl several hours after you posted this entry.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)
