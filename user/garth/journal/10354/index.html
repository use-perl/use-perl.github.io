A couple of people have mentioned on the <a href="http://archive.develooper.com/macosx@perl.org">macosx list</a> about the lack of applications/examples using camelbones. Other than the excellent examples by Sherm that come with the framework, <a href="http://rubberband.org/code/journalx">JournalX</a> (toot, toot!) seems to be the only other application using the framework with the source available. Considering the amount of people that wanted a macosx perl GUI tool I am amazed by this situation. Is it just that there aren't many perl programmers using OS X? Or is it just that perl programmers aren't fans of writing GUI apps?<br/><br/>On the JournalX front, I haven't done much work on it lately, not that there are any users of it other than me :-) I have started to fix a few bugs in the current version, and I am working on adding french localization. I think I will wait until the new camelbones version comes out before I release anything, to see what happens on the packaging front.<br/><br/>I have also been daydreaming about creating a CPANPLUS front-end with camelbones. I have built a simple interface with IB, but I have hit a few snags with the design. I need a way to use the apple security procedures to allow for installation into the system perl directories. After ready the <a href="http://developer.apple.com/techpubs/macosx/CoreTechnologies/securityservices/authorizationservices/authorization_concepts/index.html">Authorization Services API</a>, using AuthorizationExecuteWithPrivileges() seems to be the way to go, but I am not really sure how I should deal with displaying progress, and how to deal with prompts from the installer/testing. I am sure I will eventually figure out the solution, and then hit another stumbling block :-)<br/><br/></p>

<h2>Distribution</h2>

Has Sherm fixed the distribution problem yet? Last time I tried I couldn't get my CamelBones app into a Foo.app framework (including all the relevant CamelBones libraries, and maybe even libperl) so that I could just create a<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.dmg and ship it. That was my big stumbling block to be honest.

You can distribute apps with the framework either by embeding it in the app bundle (it requires a few changes to the way the framework is compiled though), or just require that it is installed by the user. However the current version still has issues when the perl installed on the users machine is different to where the app was compiled (i.e. 5.6 vs 5.8). I suppose since this gets asked often enough I should write something up for Sherm to put on the website.<br> <br>There was a discussion late last year about making the new version have the option of including all required modules and libperl inside the app bundle to make it possible to produce a standalone application. Hopefully this will happen for version 0.3

<h2>Lack of examples</h2>

I have just started trying to write some CamelBones code and though Sherm is quick to respond with helpful comments, I too find it difficult to make progress due to lack of examples. I am tied up at simple stuff like how to dynamically (programmatically) create widgets (such as a list of checkboxes). I have downloaded the XJournal source and hope to learn from it.
