<h2>In &quot;recent&quot; emacs versions...</h2>

it's much easier.  M-x customize, then drill down through files, recentf, and adjust as you wish.

Thanks! I had no clue about M-x customize...<br> <br>I have a colleague who's helping me with all this, and I really don't think it would have been possible for me to get started without such hands-on help.<br> <br>And still I miss important things that _he_ doesn't know about. I mean, I've shown him things he had no idea that they existed<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

IMHO it's much better in the long run to learn about "apropos-variable" and "apropos-function" (C-h a and C-h f), learn about "setq", and write yourself a config file.  Emacs' power lies in its programmability, and you lose a lot when all you see of that power is the clunky custom interface.

Well, as someone who has been using GNU emacs for a <i>very</i> long time (I'm thinking early 80's here), I'm going to disagree.  Maybe because I already know about <tt>setq</tt>, but I'm happy to see the whole customize thing come along.  In fact, most of my random<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.emacs startup files have become much cleaner because I absorbed all of my weird settings into customize-managed settings.  Sure, I have some stuff that's not customizable, but most of it ended up in a nice clean package now.
<p>
Let customize be used for "user tweakable options", and let the power users learn about <tt>setq</tt>.  This is an appropriate separation.</p>

It's a matter of explorability as well.<br> <br>If not for the config interface I wouldn't have stubled upon that weird glasses-mode or hippie-expand<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

I'm a relative newbie (since '95, myself), but I like the fact that in
Emacs there is no sharp distinction between tweaking options and
programmatically extending the editor.  Rather, you can advance
smoothly from fixing the colors and tab-width, to automating simple
editing tasks, to hacking on your mail client, to adding whole new
packages to the text editor.  One of the (many) things that repulses
me about Eclipse is the line between the "monkey options" in the
preference panel and the power to extend the environment -- knowing
the former tells you nearly nothing about the latter.

<p> As Stallman noted in his <a href="http://www.mirror5.com/software/emacs/emacs-paper.html" title="mirror5.com">essay</a mirror5.com>:
</p><blockquote><div>

When large numbers of nontechnical workers are using a programmable
editor, they will he tempted constantly to begin programming in the
course of their day-to-day lives. This should contribute greatly to
computer literacy, especially because many of the people thus exposed
will be secretaries taught by society that they are incapable of doing
mathematics, and unable to imagine for a moment that they can learn to
program.
</div></blockquote>

While I'm not quite so optimistic, I still believe that text editing
in Emacs is and should be (E)Lisp what system administration and CGI
hacking are to Perl -- application domains that continually present
new problems along with the tools to solve them, naturally encouraging
users with some minimal technical ability to better themselves.
