<p>More fiddling around with Word documents using the Win32::OLE module (and my, now more capable, Win32::OLE::Word::Writer).<br/><br/>The mission, which I chose to accept, is to extract our Coding Standard from the MoinMoin wiki (a few pages per language) and put into a proper document. <br/><br/>Why not keep it in the wiki? Well, a proper document is thought to be more authoritative. But keeping two sources in sync won't work. <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?DontRepeatYourself">Don't Repeat Yourself</a>, so a Word document is created from the wiki pages.<br/><br/>At first I thought about fetching the Wiki markup and parse it, so I tried the Inline::Python module to re-use the original Python parser source. But it seems <a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?query=Inline%3A%3APython">Inline::Python</a> doesn't work on Windows, so that didn't work out very well. Would have been extremely cool if it had worked.<br/><br/>The next idea was to transform the HTML since there is slightly more prior art when it comes to parsing that particular format. Ovid's <a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?query=HTML%3A%3ATokeParser%3A%3ASimple">HTML::TokeParser::Simple</a> turned out to be very useful (nice work!).<br/><br/>The simple module which I <a href="http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=409972">asked about</a> on PerlMonks is now capable of dealing with styles (both paragraph and character based), multi-level bullet lists and (soon) tables.<br/><br/>Generally, working with Office Automation is a jungle. Okay, the documentation is pretty good, but sometimes things don't work as advertised. One problem I bumped into was that it didn't work to turn off the do-you-want-to-save-your-document? dialog.<br/><br/>The documented way is to:<br/><br/><pre>
$oWord = Win32::OLE->new('Word.Application'), 'Quit') );
$oWord->{DisplayAlerts} = $rhConst->{wdAlertsNone};
</pre><br/><br/>That does't work at all in my Word 2000. And I found posts stating the same thing when searching. The workaround is to do this:<br/><br/><pre>
$oWord = Win32::OLE->new('Word.Application');
</pre>
and in the DESTROY of the containing Win32::OLE::Word::Writer object first <i>insist</i> that the document is already saved, and then quit:
<pre>
$self->oDocument->{Saved} = 1;
$self->oWord->Quit();
</pre><br/><br/>The bullet list was also a bit tricky to get working properly so I think there is quite a bit of complexity hidden in the new module.<br/><br/>There are a few working code examples available in Perl, but when figuring out how to do something it's often useful to record a macro and then inspect it.<br/><br/>The OLE browser is available from within Word: press Alt-F11, open the Object Browser, find your method or property and Right-click->Help to bring up the proper VBA help page. And I've probably bookmarked fifteen web pages with documentation and tips & tricks.<br/><br/>In addition to the Word module I see a html2word.pl and a moin2word.pl script on the horizon.</p>
