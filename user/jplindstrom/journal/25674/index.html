<p>The Windows analogue to SSH is Terminal Service. <br/><br/>There are other remote desktop thingys (PcAnywhere, VNC, etc), but they suck in comparison, being slow and flaky. TS is snappy and on a LAN it almost feels like a local computer.<br/><br/>The most annoying thing with TS is that there is no built in way to copy files. I think that's fixed in later versions, but if you're accessing a w2k machine, it's tough if you can't map a network drive because of firewall restrictions.<br/><br/>Enter TSDropCopy:

<i>The Windows analogue to SSH is Terminal Service.</i>

<p> <a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/user/sgtatham/putty/" title="greenend.org.uk">PuTTY</a greenend.org.uk> is a FLOSS SSH (including SCP and SFTP) implementation for Windows, with a particularly nice Windows-compatible SSH Agent implementation. (Users moving to Linux desktops  keep asking why the SSH-Agent doesn't work as nicely under X-Windows as PAgeant!)

Oh, I know about plink, pscp and all, but it doesn't fulfill the same role as SSH does on Unix; you can't remotely control a windows machine from the shell. You need a  GUI to do interesting stuff on Windows. Hence TS &lt;=&gt; SSH.

Oh, in that sense. Yeah, TS and a few other virtualizers let you view the GUI remotely.  The structure of Xwindows lets point of execution and point of display wander separately in the Unix/X universe, in ways that Windows can't.<br><br>SSH rocks because the commandline rocks.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)<br><br>Bill

<h2>Ugly solution</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/runrig/">runrig</a> on 2005-07-13T21:34:28</h3>
We had a customer which we only had TS access to. So we'd open notepad on both systems (well, I'd open vim on our side), and copy/paste the text. If there was too much text it wouldn't work, so then we'd have to break out the old "split" shell command (and/or uuencode/decode if it wasn't text). We searched for a solution, and the only one we found was commercial, I think it cost too much though, or maybe we didn't feel like it was worth making the purchase for how often we had to do this. Nice to know about this though...thanks!
