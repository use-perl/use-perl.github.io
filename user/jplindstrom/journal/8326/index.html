<p>Consider these alternative ways of saying the same thing:
<code>
if(!$ok) {
    logFatal("Transfer ($file) to host failed.");
    return(0);
}
</code>
vs
<code>
$ok or return( logFatal("Transfer ($file) to host failed.") && 0 );
</code>
The conditional in question pretty much deserves one line in the program logic ("log and return 0"). But is it too much Perl trickery?<br/><br/>I'm obviously in favour of the second one, because I think vertical whitespace matters and size-follows-importance is a good visual design principle.

<h2>Just warp scoping :)</h2>

<p>As I recall, Simon Cozens' talk at YAPC about Artur Bergman's work on the optimizer.pm module mentioned some freaky things like being able to have a subroutine return from the calling subroutine.  I was intensely interested because I am doing a lot of Expect.pm work, and that kind of idiom is pretty common in old TCL/Expect scripts.  (And blatantly useful in plenty of cases so far with Expect.pm.  Lots of callbacks that could benefit.)</p>

<p>I'm not sure if the work in question was mature enough, but if so I think you could actually write a &amp;log_and_return subroutine.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<p>I think he also managed to implement strong typing along the way.  Compile time.  With no overhead.  Or something like that.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)  Amazing what you can do when you warp the op-tree.</p>



<h2>that second one scares me</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/merlyn/">merlyn</a> on 2002-10-11T16:24:54</h3>
it was too much for me to figure out
that you weren't returning the value of logfatal.
<p>
I might consider:</p><blockquote><div> <tt>$ok or<br>&nbsp; logFatal(), return(0);</tt> </div></blockquote>or even<blockquote><div> <tt>&nbsp; logFatal(),<br>&nbsp; return(0)<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; unless $ok;</tt> </div></blockquote>But I just think that second one is a bit too nested for me to work out immediately what it's doing.

How about this one?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br> <code> <br>$ok or return( 0 &amp; logFatal("Transfer ($file) to host failed."));<br> </code> <br>It's more evident that the 0 is there, but it's still a severe piece of trickery.<br> <br>Since logFatal() is what it is, maybe a better solution is to redefine it to always return 0 (I never check that return value anyway. Like, what should I do if it fails? Report it somewhere?). <br> <br>A utility routine should preferrably provide something useful, not complicate your code unnecessarily<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br> <br> <p><nobr> <wbr></nobr>/J<br></p>
