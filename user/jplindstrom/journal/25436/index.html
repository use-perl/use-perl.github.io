<p>It feels like there's a lot of energy in the Perl community right now with new, interesting, and cool stuff happening left and right.<br/><br/><b>$m</b> is the number of new modules on CPAN. For me right now, <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Test-Base/">Test::Base </a> looks interesting, <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/PPI/">PPI</a> is very useful for my Devel::PerlySense project and I hope to use <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Catalyst/">Catalyst</a> for something simple in the near future. And there are lots of others.<br/><br/><b>$c</b> is the number of conferences being held, squared because of what happens when people meet in real life, talk to each other, hack together, drink beer, and become friends. YAPC::Europe is a couple of months away and I can't wait.</p>

I hadn't seen it, but it seems somewhat similar in direction. Thanks for the pointer.<br> <br>Devel::PerlySense isn't so much about refactoring (source editing) as about getting around your code base (browsing/navigation) and bringing the documentation for modules/methods/subs to you when coding. So it's more like IntelliSense in that regard.<br> <br>For example, in Emacs, when the cursor is on the method of<blockquote> <div> <tt>$self-&gt;urlWikiRemote($1)</tt> </div> </blockquote>and you press C-p C-d (the Smart Docs command), you get to see the documentation (POD, example, or actual usage) for that method in the message buffer:<blockquote> <div> <tt>PROPERTIES<br>&nbsp; urlWikiRemote<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Url of the remote Wiki to replicate to.<br>
&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; When set, also set oWiki()-&gt;urlBase() if possible.<br>
&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Default: ""</tt> </div> </blockquote>Similarly C-p C-g is Smart Go To, which opens the file at the sub definition(declaration or documentation).<br> <br>But it sounds like a good idea to coordinate the efforts, because a lot of the infrastructure and source analysis should be similar for refactoring and navigation.

Also <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/sepia/" title="cpan.org">Sepia</a cpan.org>, which is my attempt at doing something similar using B::Xref instead of PPI.  It's sort of rough, but it might be worth looking at.

Wow, how come I haven't found this when surfing?<br> <br>Maybe it should be a bit more visible on Emacs sites where Perl and cperl-mode is mentioned?

Hey, it's the first hit for "emacs perl sepia"...:)

<p>I haven't promoted it much at all for a couple of reasons:  First, I don't like self-promotion, so I don't like to go splashing Sepia all over web pages, mailing lists, etc.  Second, there are known bugs in the current released version, and I haven't gotten around to fixing them all in my local copy.  I find it useful myself, but you really need to know a bit of Emacs and Perl to get yourself out of trouble sometimes.  It's great if you're willing to debug and/or help develop it, but not quite ready for "end-users".</p>

Ah, the difference between "a program" and "sofware"<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

New version on CPAN, which addresses some of the more obvious issues with the last.  Give it a spin if you want.
