<p>I just uploaded <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Devel-PerlySense/lib/Devel/PerlySense.pm">Devel::PerlySense</a> 0.0134 to PAUSE. If you happen to use PerlySense [1], you may want to upgrade since a few nifty features have been added in the last versions:
<ul>
<li>Class Overview with the list of methods/properties that make up the API of the class (so that includes inherited methods). From this list you can use method Docs (d) and Go to (g), just like from within the source. [2]

<li>In the Class Overview, things are rearranged a bit to show the most useful things at the top: the Inheritance tree and the API.

<li>Run "perly_sense info" to display diagnostics about what PerlySense thinks your Project dir is, where your Home dir is located, etc.

<li>A Cookbook page with clever tricks and common problem. Well, one of each so far.
</ul>I got a spontaneous <i>That's fucking cool!</i> reaction from a team mate the other day so if you happen to not yet use PerlySense, but use Emacs, you may want to give it a spin. I fixed the gripe in <a href="http://cpanratings.perl.org/dist/Devel-PerlySense">the CPAN review</a> about fiddling with the elisp files, so that's one less hoop to jump through.

<p>
[1] I have no idea whatsoever if anyone actually uses this thing yet, but I'm guessing the user base is only slightly larger than... well, me.

[2] The API view is not at all finished yet, but it's still useful. Ideally, the methods should be ordered first by their POD heading, and then by their source location. And private methods of parent classes from outside the Project (i.e. when your classes inherit from CPAN modules) are rarely interesting and shouldn't be displayed at all, or at least be displayed in a more subdued font face.
