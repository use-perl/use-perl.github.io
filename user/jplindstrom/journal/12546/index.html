<h1>Perl Oasis 0.3 released</h1>

<div class="span8">
<p>New version of <a href="http://www.bahnhof.se/user/johanl/perl/Oasis/">Perl Oasis</a> available.<br/><br/>New stuff: Scintilla source viewer and a couple of new supported editors: gVim, EditPlus and PFE in addition to the original UltraEdit.<br/><br/>The Scintilla control acted up when I tried to build a freestanding PerlApp application. Scintilla uses a SciLexer.dll file which is located in the site/lib/auto/... directory tree in the Perl installation. But adding it to the application in that relative location didn't work, nor did adding it in the current directory.<br/><br/>It's strange that Scintilla or Perl (I don't know which sub system does this) can't find the dll when located in the exact same place as it is in my Perl installation.<br/><br/>I ended up placing it outside the application, in the same dir as Oasis.exe itself. Not even adding the location to $ENV{PATH} worked. Oh, well.</p>

<h2>Did you try to auto-extract the DLL?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jand/">jand</a> on 2003-06-01T20:16:54</h3>
Did you try to bind it like this:
<blockquote><div> <code>
--bind SciLexer.dll[file=site\lib\auto\...\SciLexer.dll,extract]
</code> </div></blockquote>
(with the correct full<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/site/lib/auto path of course)?

Yes, I made sure the extracted file was next to the Scintilla dll in site/lib/auto/Win32/Scintilla, just as it was in the Perl installation. I really think that should have worked.<br> <br>I also put it in the current directory, still no dice.<br> <br>I even tried setting the PATH (since there is no LD_LIBRARY_PATH on Windows) to different locations where it was, but nooo.<br> <br>Maybe I made some other mistake, that's certainly possible.

The extracted file should be in the main extraction directory (which automatically gets added to the PATH etc.), and not to site/lib/auto/Win32/Scintilla directory, which is where is normally lives.  The --bind option quoted in my previous reply <i>should</i> have done this correctly.
<p>Could you run PerlApp again, and send me both the commandline used and the STDOUT/STDERR output via email?</p>

Thanks, I'll try that when I find the time.<br> <br>You should note that I use PerlApp 2 so the exact syntax isn't the same.<br>

Ah, ok.  I don't think PerlApp 2 supports automatic extraction of bound files.  You'll have to manually write it out to a directory on the PATH in order to make it work I guess.  In that case it is probably easier to just ship the DLL separately with the executable.  The syntax I gave earlier requires PerlApp 4.1 or later I believe.
