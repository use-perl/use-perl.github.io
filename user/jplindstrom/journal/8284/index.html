<p>I just did a demo of my Perl Oasis to a fellow Perl programmer. Thankfully he said "Wow! This is the coolest thing in a long time". And then he asked himself why he didn't already know about it. So did I, since it's been out there for a long time.<br/><br/>I truly find Perl Oasis useful, but plugging it all over the place, all the time, is just bad form. However this is my blog, so here goes:<br/><br/><i>Perl Oasis is a Perl IDE. It is a code navigator; a POD/source/class browser tightly integrated with (currently) UltraEdit. It makes it easy to navigate source code, POD, modules, projects and your files. It is a Win32::GUI application.</i><br/><br/><a href="http://www.DarSerMan.com/Perl/Oasis/">http://www.DarSerMan.com/Perl/Oasis/</a><br/><br/>Cool thing: my colleague also mentioned that there are third party programs listed on the UltraEdit web site, so why didn't I ask for Oasis to be listed there as well? So I sent an e-mail, and the author himself just e-mailed me to say it's ok. <br/><br/>Wow! :)

Perl Oasis needs better P.R. I've been using UltraEdit as my primary Perl editor for the past 5 years, and had never heard of Perl Oasis.<br>



<h2>Screenshots</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Matts/">Matts</a> on 2002-10-10T07:14:55</h3>
I hate to say it, but you really need screenshots. They give me an instant feel for the functionality on offer, and whether or not I want to even bother downloading it.<br> <br>Of course it's a moot point for me since I'm a TextPad user when I'm on Win32, but I still think you need them.<br> <br>Heck, I even put up screenshots for <a href="http://axpoint.axkit.org/" title="axkit.org">AxPoint</a axkit.org>.

Good point. The sad thing is that I'm like that too<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)  I need a motivation to download stuff, but I hoped the blurb itself would entice people enough to do that.<br> <br>And note that you don't need UltraEdit to use Perl Oasis, but it's a more powerful combo than just Oasis.<br> <br>Comments and improvement possibilities are welcome.

<p>What really gets me checking something out is hearing everybody talk about it.  The initial blurb piques my interest and files a bookmark in my brain.  Screenshots may entice me to download at that point, but if not, what will finally hook me into it is when I hear Matt, gnat, pudge, et. al. all saying how wonderful it is.</p>

Yeah, I'm waiting for that too<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)<br> <br>Seriously, The GUI Loft gets decent word of mouth in various mailing lists, but Perl Oasis have managed to stay off-radar, period. Kind of strange since it's a more general tool. Or if it's simply that people find TGL more useful<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br> <br>The only feedback _at_all_ I have found (HTTP_REFERER is nice) is this blog entry at Classy's Kitchen:<br> <a href="http://www.classy.dk/log/archive/000094.html" title="classy.dk">http://www.classy.dk/log/archive/000094.html</a classy.dk> <br> <br>Which is nice I guess.<br>

<p>
I don't know whether it counts as PR, but I now added the Perl Oasis to the CPAN ports (Win32) <a href="http://www.cpan.org/ports/#win32" title="cpan.org">IDEs</a cpan.org> section, and UltraEdit to the editors list.

...and, duh, managed to introduce a few typos and bugs in the process (like deleting the first &lt;<br>from the file), and now am unable to fix it for a few hours at least...<br>
