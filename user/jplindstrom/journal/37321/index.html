<div class="span8">
<p>Sometimes (but not always) when I copy things from my Emacs X11 window and try to paste it into Putty, it hangs Putty. That's pretty annoying. <br/><br/>I can generally get out of the freeze by pressing Ctrl-uh-some-key-in-the-top-left-corner, but from then on paste doesn't work anymore.<br/><br/>According to the Putty web site, that's only <a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/user/sgtatham/putty/wishlist/rdesktop-paste-hang.html">semi-buggy behaviour</a>. Well, I don't know.<br/><br/>But from the explanation on that page I thought I could write something that would grab what's in the clipboard and put it back, working around the problem. <br/><br/>Of course, that's general enough to have been done before, so now I use <a href="http://www.binaryfortress.com/clipboardfusion/">ClipboardFusion</a> to scrub the clipboard contents, and it seems to work okay.<br/><br/>Actually, researching this blog post and re-reading the semi-bug web page again, I may have discovered another way. Isn't it ironic... *)<br/><br/>It also seems this may not be a problem if I start Emacs in one Putty terminal and don't use that terminal again for anything. That wouldn't be a problem for me, I have five other terminals open anyway, and I could always minimize the Emacs terminal to the tray. I might try that and see how that works out.<br/><br/>
*) It is. If you subscribe to the Alanis Morissette school of irony.

i have to admit chuckling over this song and the utter absence of any irony in any of the situations described, until someone pointed out that this meant the song was itself ironic. How intentional this was is anyone's guess.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
