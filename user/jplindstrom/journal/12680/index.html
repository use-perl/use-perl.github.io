<p><b>8 - Calling the Shot</b><br/><br/>The effort of building large systems is non-linear, even if there is no extra communication needed.<br/><br/>Projects often take double the initial estimated time to complete. People often only work 50% of the time on development (the other is short unrelated jobs, meetings, paperwork, sickness, personal time etc.)
<i>I think this may be a little higher, maybe 70%, but some roles i a project are more prone to communication disturbances</i><br/><br/>Productivity seems constant in terms of elementary statements. So, high level languages are good. 
<i>The higher the better? Where is Perl?</i><br/><br/>
<b>9 - Ten Pounds in a Five-Pound Sack</b><br/><br/>For an given function, the more space, the faster. This is true over an amazingly large range of problems.<br/><br/>Representation is the essence of programming.<br/><br/>Show me your flowcharts and conceal your tables, and I shall continue to be mystified. Show me your tables and I won't usually need your flowcharts; they'll be obvious.<br/><br/>
<b>10 - The Documentary Hypothesis</b><br/><br/>Existance of a budget forces technical decisions that otherwise would be avoided.<br/><br/>Writing is essential. The act of writing turns out to require hundreds of mini-decisions.<br/><br/>The fundamental job of the manager is to keep everyone going in the same direction. This requires communication rather than decision-making. Documents ease that job.<br/><br/>
<b>11 - Plan to Throw One Away</b><br/><br/>The actual need, and the perception of that need, will change as programs are built, tested, and used.<br/><br/>Plan the system for change.<br/><br/>The cost of maintenance is typically 40% or more of the development cost.<br/><br/>Fixing a defect has a high chance of introducing another. So the whole process is two steps forward and one step back.
<i>Enter regression testing.</i><br/><br/>Maintenance requires more testing than development.<br/><br/>Code with no side effects, and fewer interfaces, using fewer people, can lead to fewer bugs.<br/><br/>
<b>12 - Sharp Tools</b><br/><br/>Tools are necessary. Build them if needed.<br/><br/>
<b>13 - The Whole and the Parts</b><br/><br/>System tests are unexpectedly hard.<br/><br/>Use debugged and tested components. <br/><br/>Don't leave documented bugs for later, you don't know their effect until they're fixed. <br/><br/>Add one component at a time.<br/><br/>
<b>14 - Hatching a Catasrophe</b><br/><br/>How does a project get to be a year late? One day at a time.<br/><br/>Have a schedule.<br/><br/>Milestones must be knife-sharp, concrete, definable events. It's finished when it's 100% finished, no sooner.<br/><br/>Estimates don't change before the project. During the activity, over-estimates come down. During the activity, under-estimates don't change until two or three weeks until scheduled completion.<br/><br/>Dependencies are vital to track.<br/><br/>
<b>15 - The Other Face</b><br/><br/>Users need a prose description of the program. Most documentation gives to little overview.<br/><br/>Flow-charts suck (unless maybe if you do assembler).<br/><br/>Write self-documenting code.<br/><br/>
<b>16 - No Silver Bullet - Essence and Accident in Software Engineering</b><br/><br/>Re-use what is already coded. Prototype. Grow software organically. Encourage good designers.<br/><br/>The essence of a software entity is a construct of interlocking concepts: data sets, relationships among data items, algorithms, and invocations of functions.<br/><br/><b>Complexity</b>. Software entities are more complex for their size than perhaps any other human constuct, because no two parts are alike. If they are, we make them into one.<br/><br/>The complexity of software is an essential property. Hence descriptions of a software entity that abstract away its complexity often abstract away its essence. <br/><br/>From the complexity comes the difficulty of enumerating, much less understanding, all the possible states of a program.<br/><br/><b>Conformity</b>. Much of the complexity comes from outside, real-life, sources.<br/><br/><b>Changeability</b>. A software entity is constantly subject to pressure for change. All successful software gets changed.<br/><br/>The software in a system embodies its function, and the function is the part that most feels the pressures of change.<br/><br/><b>Invisibility</b>. <br/><br/>
High-level languages frees a program from much of it's accidental complexity.<br/><br/>The hard thing about building software is deciding what to say, not saying it. The clients don't know what they want.<br/><br/>Great design come from great designers. Software construction is a creative process. <br/><br/>
<b>17 - "No Silver Bullet" Refired</b><br/><br/>Focus on quality and productivity will follow.<br/><br/>Programmers have always reused their own handiwork.<br/><br/></p>
