<div class="span8">
<p>After using Emacs for a while, my fingers have started to betray me. <br/><br/>Fortunately, by coincidence, it's not that bad.<br/><br/>What bugs me the most is the save command. Save is Ctrl-S (or C-s in Emacs speak) pretty much everywhere, and I do it as a reflex as soon as I stop typing anything and start thinking again. (This can be somewhat annoying when I write a long text in a browser form and the <i>Save as...</i> dialog pops up all of a sudden)<br/><br/>In Emacs, Save is C-x C-s, so when I type C-s I accidently invoke the search function. But it's not that bad since I can just go ahead from within the search and do the C-x C-s tap dance without destroying anything. It doesn't matter I just did The Wrong Thing. Mostly though, I have gotten accustomed to actually thinking "Save" and pressing the correct Emacs combo. It's in my fingers now.<br/><br/>Which is nice when in Emacs, but not that handy when I'm not. Because on Windows, C-x means Cut out the current selection. What I often end up doing isn't just a Save, but a Cut-n-Save. And this is where the coincidence comes in: cutting without having anything selected is a no-op, so it doesn't matter either!<br/><br/>Maybe, just maybe, if any of these "wrong" keyboard combos had been destructive or just a little more annoying in any environment, I would have forced myself to actually learn to notice the difference and condition my fingers accordingly. But since I don't really have to, I probably won't ever do that :)<br/><br/>Coming from a Windows/Mac background, I'm used to the highly effective idiom of Shift-moving to select text. Emacs does this with the pc-selection-mode macro (thanks for <a href="http://use.perl.org/comments.pl?sid=21753&cid=33040">the pointer</a> ambs!), and the old Shift-Del, C-Ins, and Shift-Ins combos from way back in Windows 3.0 are used for Cut, Copy and Paste. <br/><br/>While they work fine, and still work in Windows today, Microsoft made a smart move adopting the C-x, C-c, and C-v from the Mac user interface for this. That way you can do a left-hand operation without stretching the fingers too much while selecting with the mouse.<br/><br/>I might teach my fingers native Emacs for Copy-Paste, but I'm afraid it may clash with a command sequence somewhere else. This whole thing just made me think of software maintenance...

<h2>XEmacs</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/zatoichi/">zatoichi</a> on 2004-08-15T17:53:16</h3>
I do the exact same thing. I am so used to the Windows keys that I constantly am starting the search funtion in xemacs.



<h2>CUA might be just the thing</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/htoug/">htoug</a> on 2004-08-16T08:57:42</h3>
from the description in cua.el:
<blockquote><div> <blockquote><div><nobr> <wbr></nobr><tt>;; This is the CUA-mode package which provides a complete emulation of<br>;; the standard CUA key bindings (Motif/Windows/Mac GUI) for selecting<br>;; and manipulating the region where S-&lt;movement&gt; is used to<br>;; highlight &amp; extend the region.<br> <br>;; This package allow the C-z, C-x, C-c, and C-v keys to be<br>;; bound appropriately according to the Motif/Windows GUI, i.e.<br>;;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; C-z&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-&gt; undo<br>;;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; C-x&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-&gt; cut<br>;;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; C-c&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-&gt; copy<br>;;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; C-v&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-&gt; paste</tt> </div></blockquote> </div></blockquote> <p>I found a way of changing Crtl-Space to Shift for marking text, but my fingers are so used to emacs now that I gave it up - and I can't remember what it was any longer - sorry!</p>

I guess pretty much everything I could even think of asking for in Emacs, someone else has already done it<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br> <br>However, remapping C-x would break like 90% of the keyboard combos in Emacs itself and make my fingers incompatible with all other emacsen in the world, or at least of the one in the office next door.

<h2>Remapping Ctrl-x</h2>

You are right - emacs is like Perl - someone has already done it! For emacs the challenge is to find where, as there is no CEAN!<p>
Ctrl-X functions "normally", for emacs that is, except when you have selected a region, so no (big) problem there.</p>
