<p>I'm preparing for YAPC::Europe, registering, booking hotel rooms, planning to take a small vacation.<br/><br/><b>The usability-improvement-potential</b>
When registering, please allow me to give you my money via CreditCard, not through the detour that is PayPal. <br/><br/>I know this isn't a business and there is no  competing product. But had it been, I might have gone somewhere else. It's the company's credit card so I'm not quite sure how to proceed. I think I'll let the card holder create an account to avoid things like... fraud or whatnot.<br/><br/><b>The irony</b>
The hotel enquiry form bombs on a Matt's Script Archive error: <i>Add 'home.btconnect.com' to your @referers array</i>. Well, I was thinking of calling anyway, maybe I can help them debug their site for a small discount :)<br/><br/><b>The silver lining</b>
T-shirts in size Small. Thanks! Some geeks are skinny you know. And I may even manage to drag myself to the Wing Tsun class today for some exercise.

<h2>Usability Improvements</h2>

Of course there's room for improvements. But it's a volunteer run project, and the amount of effort involved in just using PayPal is considerably less than having to take people's credit cards ourselves, or having to sign up to some other service to take credit cards. And by considerably, I mean several orders of magnitude.<br> <br>It's not like you have to use it. You can always pay on-site.<br>

I know, I know. It's not like I think IT SUCKS DAMNIT!! or anything because I'm quite aware of the trouble of processing credit cards. So it's quite understandable.<br> <br>But like I said, had it been a commercial company, they would probably not have been able to afford not processing credit cards.
