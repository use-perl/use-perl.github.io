<p>So in the app at work, input is performed through what we call "an import".<br/><br/>Just now a strange error occured in the test that sanity checks that all modules compile.

Can't call method "request" on an undefined value

<h2>Crazy day</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jonasbn/">jonasbn</a> on 2008-06-19T18:33:10</h3>
I started out the morning with debugging some test code in Komodo, I kept getting errors when using DBD::Mock, after biking from home to client location I just had a brief look (the debugging session was still active) - so I checked what version of DBD::Mock I had installed (1.34) and I noticed a newer version was available (1.37). I had a looked at the Changes file and there it was in 1.35 AutoCommit patch - I updated and it worked.<br><br>After this I had a look at some cross-site scripting issues with FCKeditor, we set up the newest version (which according to the docs should support this), wrote some proto-javascript and it worked.<br><br>Feeling somewhat invincible and the time was only 10:30,  I moved on to running some scripts to build a test database for the application we are working on - everything worked.<br><br>I executed the application, 'Access Denied', after several attempts with different variations and examination of another database I gave up - angry and disappointed I biked home to work on another project.<br><br>I am sure it is a human error (me) I could just not figure it out and I guess I will nail it tomorrow, pointing to another database, simply felt like loosing.<br><br>The annoying part was really that it ruined my focus.<br><br>When people ask me whether working with computer programming is not boring, I always reply that this sort of job lets me visit the complete emotional spectrum and that in a single workday.<br><br>There will be other D'ohs but again you found the solution, imagine working with something where solutions are not imminent...<br>



<h2>Reserved words</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/acme/">acme</a> on 2008-06-20T08:41:20</h3>
This has bitten me before - I've written many modules which import data in some way. This is why programming languages should have as few reserved words as possible.
