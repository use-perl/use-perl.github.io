<p>New source control tool at work: Telelogic Synergy.<br/><br/>I haven't used it enough to give it a Rocks/Sucks verdict yet (but it doesn't rock, that's clear).<br/><br/>Absurd behaviour I: When the Java developer client is running (on Windows) and you lock the computer, the GUI hangs and all is grey until you kill the javaw process and restart. That's not utterly usable.<br/><br/>The mystery is: how could they not find this problem? Don't they ever use their own program, not even like once a month or something?</p>

<h2>The verdict</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jplindstrom/">jplindstrom</a> on 2008-11-24T01:18:14</h3>
<p>In retrospect,  years later, that has to be the absolutely worst version control system ever.</p><p>Stay. Away!</p><p>I'm not kidding here.</p><p>When the proponents, who invariably don't use it day to day, try the line "well, it's not _just_ a version control system..." and argues that the integration with other systems, blah blah blah, and auditing, blah blah blah, and release manager this and release manager that, blah blah... just don't listen to them.</p><p>These are bogus arguments, and the effort spent on making all those things happen with any other system is bound to be less than actually using Synergy.</p><p>In short:</p><p>It's slow as hell even when running on massive hardware.</p><p>Its preferred working mode is pessimistic locking. Enough said.</p><p>That's because the merge facilities are stone age.</p><p>It's  very general, which means it's a) very complex to get working the way you want and b) it's lousy at dealing with specific things. Like version control.</p><p>It requires someone to REALLY know how to do things to set things up in a non-broken way. Even the consultants they sent managed to set up the whole thing in a way that always caused merge conflicts in completely unrelated branches.</p><p>Summary: This is Enterprise Software at its worst.</p>
