And yeah, you can make a case for returning an item count instead of just <code>undef</code>.

<h2>Why &quot;item count&quot;?  Least likely!</h2>

See <a href="http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=347416" title="perlmonks.org">my perlmonks posting on scalar context</a perlmonks.org>.  "Count" is actually in the minority for things being returned in a scalar context.
<p>
I think a much more interesting thing would be a floating point value between 0 and 1 of how many adjacent pairs of items already meet the sort criteria, so "1..5" would be 1, but "reverse 1..5" would be 0.</p>

<h2>Re:</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Aristotle/">Aristotle</a> on 2005-10-02T06:38:45</h3>
<p>That sortedness factor you propose sounds really useless. <code>0 + sort qw( 1 3 5 7 9 0 2 4 6 8 10 )</code> would return 0.9. But what am I supposed to conclude from that? The list is certainly not 90% sorted, nor can I think of any other way in which this metric might be useful.</p>

<p>OTOH, returning the item count would allow parity for</p> <blockquote> <div><tt>sub foo { sort @_ }</tt></div> </blockquote> <p>with</p> <blockquote> <div><tt>sub bar { map $_, @_ }</tt></div> </blockquote> <p>and</p> <blockquote> <div><tt>sub baz { grep 1, @_ }</tt></div> </blockquote> <p>in scalar context.</p>

<p>And item count in scalar context is actually <a href="http://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=496726" title="perlmonks.org">the majority among functions that take a list and returns a list in list context</a perlmonks.org>.</p>

Okay, it would return 0.8, because the default sort comparator is alphanumeric, not numeric, but you get the point.

I think "number of items" would be fairly useless.  I mean, why should the word "sort" be there if all you want is the count?  It would lead to misleading (and also non-backward compatible) code.
<p>
Maybe I'm the only Perl person on the planet that does <i>not</i> presume "length of list in scalar context" for every list-returning operation, but I think it's a fair starting place.
</p><p>
From a practical perspective, channelling Larry here for a moment (which after nearly two decades, I'm getting only <i>slightly</i> better at), there just wasn't a sensible scalar value for sort, hence it was left <tt>undef</tt> for future expansion.</p>

<p>Lack of parity with <code>map</code> and <code>grep</code> means that implementation details leak out of a function. The caller needs to know whether a function does <code>return sort @foo</code> or something like <code>return map bar($_), sort @foo</code> &#8211; even when the sorting is just a part of the function&#8217;s contract and not the operation of interest.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s just ridiculous.</p>

<p>Also: first you say it would lead to non-backward compatible code, then you say it was left open for expansion. Which is it?</p>

<h3><a href="/user/merlyn/">merlyn</a> on 2005-10-02T12:37:41</h3>
But you missed my point.  I would not presume that a random subroutine that I called returned a length in a scalar context when only documented to return a list in a list context.  So why should "sort" encourage that behavior.  Instead, we should be getting the word out there to stop presuming that!



<blockquote>

<h2>Re:</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Aristotle/">Aristotle</a> on 2005-10-02T17:27:58</h3>
<p>Ah. That is a more reasonable position.</p>

<p>I still don&#8217;t see the point. A superbly useful special semantic for the scalar context return of <code>sort</code> will never materialise. It&#8217;s been &#8220;open for expansion&#8221; for over a decade and will remain so for the next one, too.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d rather rid the world of another special case, boring as that may be, and spare five people per year the surprise of tripping over this.</p>

<p>But eh.</p>

<h2>List in scalar context?!?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/bart/">bart</a> on 2005-10-03T00:23:26</h3>
I'm suprised nobody else told you yet with as many words: <em>there's no such thing as a "list in scalar context"</em>.<br><br>So you think <tt>map</tt> and <tt>grep</tt> do return a list in scalar context? They don't. They return, in true Perl tradition, a list in list context, and they return "some useful value" in scalar context, which needn't even be related to that list. As <tt>grep</tt> and <tt>map</tt> in list context do not necessarily return the same number of items as they have arguments, it makes sense to make them return the count of items they would have returned. For <tt>grep</tt> that makes it easy for us to count the number of matches, very useful indeed.<br><br>But what's your excuse for <tt>sort</tt>? You could just as well expect it to behave as the comma operator, returning a list in list context (as usual), and the value of the last item of that list in scalar context. So <tt>sort</tt> in scalar context would then return the maximum value. Makes sense.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)
