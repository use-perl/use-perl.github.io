<div class="span8">
<p>I'm preparing for YAPC. Sorting out travel arrangements, printing
maps, getting stuff on the phone for offline browsing.
<p>
And I'm looking at the schedule. Looks good, interesting stuff.
<p>
But a few clashes with must-attend talks side by side. Here are the
toughest match ups:
<p>


<b>
<a href="http://www.yapceurope2008.org/ye2008/talk/1321">Everything but the secret sauce</a>
<br>vs<br>
<a href="http://www.yapceurope2008.org/ye2008/talk/1392">Effective Code Coverage</a>
</b>
<br>
A bunch of pragmatic tips on how to get stuff done, vs code
coverage. Tough one. I may already have seen the code coverage stuff,
but I'd also like to see if <a
href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Devel-CoverX-Covered/lib/Devel/CoverX/Covered.pm">Devel::CoverX::Covered</a>
is mentioned ( *nudge, nudge* :)
<p>


<b>
<a href="http://www.yapceurope2008.org/ye2008/talk/1384">Putting Types To Work In Perl 6</a>
<br>vs<br>
<a href="http://www.yapceurope2008.org/ye2008/talk/1379">Elegant^Elegant: Web application metaprogramming with Reaction</a>
<br>vs<br>
<a href="http://www.yapceurope2008.org/ye2008/talk/1390">Profiling Modules - A Survey</a>
</b>
<br>
All of these sound interesting. Basic Perl 6 OO is old news (Damian
Conway sold me on that in Munchen six years ago), but I'd like to know
more about type system (it may have a Moose connection and hence be
usable today). Overshadowing that is the fact that I have been waiting
to see what Reaction looks like for a long time now, and I think this
is the first public appearance.
<p>

<br>vs<br>
<a href="http://www.yapceurope2008.org/ye2008/talk/1091">Building Catalyst apps on the Amazon Web Service Platform</a>
</b>
<br>
I've never done anything with the EC2 cloudy stuff so I'd like to hear
about that. But Adam Kennedy is apparently an energetic speaker with
an interesting topic. Damnit!
<p>


<b>
<a href="http://www.yapceurope2008.org/ye2008/talk/1355">DOM manipulation by Gainer/Wiimote over</a>
<br>vs<br>
<a href="http://www.yapceurope2008.org/ye2008/talk/1309">Making (large) legacy systems beautiful</a>
</b>
<br>
Fun and games against the harsh realities of everyday software
maintenance. I may sit down in the back of the room of either talk and
discreetly task switch for a bit.
<p>


<b>
<a href="http://www.yapceurope2008.org/ye2008/talk/1313">Unicode Best Practices</a>
<br>vs<br>
<a href="http://www.yapceurope2008.org/ye2008/talk/1316">Modifying databases - changing the schema in a controlled way</a>
</b>
<br>
Two difficult, utterly pragmatic topics pitted against each other. How
is that fair? We have solved both with various degrees of success at
work and it would be interesting to see how others did it.
<p>
Advantage: schema changes, because it's more open ended.
<p>


<b>
<a href="http://www.yapceurope2008.org/ye2008/talk/1345">Describing classes with Ernst</a>
<br>vs<br>
<a href="http://www.yapceurope2008.org/ye2008/talk/1401">Strawberry Perl - Achieving Win32 Platform Equality</a>
</b>
<br>
Taking Moose to the next level sounds very interesting, the more so
when Ernst sounds like what we could use at work to tie together our
domain layer with multiple input and output formats.
<p>
And Perl on Windows is interesting since I use that to some
extent. Which ironically means I may already be in the loop and op top
of it.
<p>
Advantage: Ernst.

<a href="http://www.yapceurope2008.org/ye2008/talk/1354">CPAN6 Under Construction</a>
</b>
<br>

London.pm history, probably interesting, but Leon is a good and
entertaining speaker (conference tip: a good speaker + boring topic
beats a bad speaker + interesting topic).
<p>
(hmmm, I just realized I implied Dave Cross is a bad speaker there. He
isn't.)
<p>
But on the other hand, CPAN6 is interesting, and Mark Overmeer is also
a good speaker. On the third hand, I think I saw this talk last year.

<p>

All in all, a nice lineup of talks. I especially like that the
Lightning Talks go unchallenged.

<p>See, you should have come to the last london.pm tech meet. You would have seen both Leon and me practicing our talks which would have left you clear to go and see Mark Overmeer.</p>
