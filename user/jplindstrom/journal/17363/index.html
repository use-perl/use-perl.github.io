I can't accept "top posting is evil" as an absolute dictum.<p>
I generally classify replies into two categories.  One has information related to many portions of the original - that is best written by interleaving the new information with the original (clearly quoted of course).</p><p>
The other adds a small single item to an ongoing discussion - and that is best done with inserting the new information at the top, since the readers are familiar with the previous message(s) of the discussion and do not need to read them again. The previous text is included so that readers can refresh their memory if they need an exact detail from the preceeding discussion, or if they come back to the message after a long delay.  But the ongoing immediate discussion is best served by keeping the stuff that the readers NEED to see at the top so they can conveniently skip the rest that they already know.</p>
