<div class="span8">
<p>It seems like at least once a week someone on PerlMonks or a mailing list I'm on is confounded by  their profiler results.  (Recent example <a href="http://perlmonks.org/?node_id=691728">here</a>.)  They look at the output, and nothing seems to be taking much longer than anything else, so they start chasing phantoms like method call overhead.
<p>The problem is that they're measuring the wrong thing.  Is your program taking too much CPU, or is it taking too much time?  If you're running on a computer built in the last decade, it's probably time that's the issue.  So why do we profile CPU cycles?
<p>Nearly every program outside of the scientific community (or other math-heavy situations) is I/O bound.  You don't see the I/O when you profile CPU time.  It looks like it's not even there.
<p>I've seen this happen so many times on the Class::DBI, Template Toolkit, and mod_perl lists.  People show up all desperate to eliminate every method call or rewrite their templating module in C based on a profile they did.  Then you tell them to do one by wall time and they find out that 99.9% of the run time is actually waiting for database calls to come back or something similar.</p>
