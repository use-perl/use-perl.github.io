<p><p><a href="http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=141312">This</a> article by Bruce Eckel discusses the book "Beyond Java" by Bruce Tate, in which Tate discusses Ruby on Rails and a few other things.  For those who don't know, Eckel is the author of one of the most popular Java books ever, "Thinking in Java."</p>
<p>The article is full of good quotes and has a fun snarky attitude to it.  I will warn you now, he doesn't like Perl.  However, he does recognize that Perl brought something important to the table, and it's nice to read a piece by someone with a little more cool-headed view of the Java vs. Ruby showdown that is filling oreillynet.com these days.</p>
<p>Here are some choice quotes:</p>
<blockquote>
...almost at the end of the book he declares that he doesn't have time to learn these other languages in any depth -- although he has no trouble condemning the same languages in his rush to Ruby.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Ruby is to Perl what C++ was to C.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
The backlash from heavyweight web frameworks has been significant. We now know that EJB 1 & 2 were based on an entirely flawed set of use cases.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
I think we've mostly been hearing from people who have come from Perl and found Ruby to be a "better Perl, with objects that work," or people who are finally convinced that dynamic languages have merit, and so mix the enthusiasm of the first time dynamic language user (quite a rush, as I remember from my 2-month experience with Perl many years ago) with their experience of Ruby.
