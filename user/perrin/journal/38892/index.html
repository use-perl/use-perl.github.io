<p>Just curious.  I usually try to arrange them so that most calls to other subs in the same file are forward references and the internal subs are defined close to where they are called most prominently.  Does anyone else think about this?</p>

<p>Because I interleave my method POD in between the methods, I usually order them in human-learning order.</p><p>Constructor<br>Accessors<br>Main Methods<br>Support Methods</p>

<h3><a href="/user/mpeters/">mpeters</a> on 2009-04-30T15:44:58</h3>
<p>I do almost the same. I love having my POD right next to the methods so it's easier to update when I update the method. So my documentation usually prescribes my method order which usually works out to be the best way to orgainze them, at least for me.</p>

<p>But as time goes by I get less inclined to. POD gets written down after the <code>__END__</code> and the module gets written up in learning order, but in the body of the code, stuff falls where it will (usually near to where it got extracted from) and etags claims its own.</p><p>If I'm coding in Ruby, it goes 'public, protected, private' (and when I do sort perl methods, that's the kind of gradient I go with as well, even though perl doesn't make those distinctions.)</p>

Heh.  I tried the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2009/WD-html5-20090423/" title="w3.org">standard HTML tags</a w3.org> "PRE" and "CODE," but didn't think to add an "e."  I assume the rationale is something like "it's better break our 'HTML formatted' by adding an 'e' to the tag name than to break it by rendering 'CODE' or 'PRE' in a way that differs from the standard."  There are levels of suck to which the only appropriate response is to point and laugh.

<h2>script versus module</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/slanning/">slanning</a> on 2009-05-02T09:43:08</h3>
<p>I do that in "scripts", basically write what I want to happen, then fill in the details. I usually put a <code>main</code> function at the top too, as the entry point, followed by <code>exit</code> just to be explicit about what's happening (to indicate that there's no "inline" code between subroutine definitions).</p><p>In modules, I'd tend to use the "learning-order" that people mentioned.</p>
