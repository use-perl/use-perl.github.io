<p>Here's a great quote from Douglas Crockford's "JavaScript: The Good Parts":
<blockquote>
The worst features of a language aren't the features that are obviously dangerous or useless.  Those are easily avoided.  The worst features are the attractive nuisances, the features that are both useful and dangerous.

<p>There very well could be a similar book for another language in the medium-term future.  It may not include the railroad diagrams, however.</p>

<p>You don't think the railroad diagrams totally <em>make</em> the book or what?</p><p>I actually just read that same quote the other night (because I skipped to "the bad parts" when I ran across some WTF parts having gotten somewhat bored with the explanation of the syntax parts.)  But I have to disagree because I'm thinking that the <em>worst</em> part of the language is the lack of block scoping because it makes closures nearly useless without acrobatics (these acrobatics are the WTF part.)</p><p>My suggested solution would be to just remove all of the parts and replace them with a good language (pragmatists will take offense here, but I didn't say this was a pragmatic solution (and committees are what got us in this mess anyway.))  Javascript is neat and all, but why oh why?!</p>

<p>I hate reading, writing, and maintaining parsers (seriously, I hate them so much I <em>almost</em> refuse to fix bugs in them), and I find grammars easier to read than the railroad diagrams.  Remember though that I have practical experience reading, writing, and maintaining parsers, and that I can already visualize language in terms of parsers, so I'm clearly not the target reader.</p><p>The argument <em>pro</em> JavaScript is two-fold: the most awful parts are the DOM implementations, and it's mostly ubiquitous in modern browsers.  I hate web programming, so I can mostly avoid it, but apart from the broken scoping and the lack of include mechanisms, it's a workable language.</p>

<p>Reading the JSLint section (I decided to just read the end and then go back for the good parts), it sounds like 80% of the human effort goes into working around problems in the language or the various runtimes, which loses expressiveness and requires humans to keep track of a lot of computer problems.  Workable is, after all, work.</p><p>So, if everyone runs JSLint on their javascript anyway, why not just use a good language which can be compiled into this cross-browser machine code stuff?</p>

For a different example, once you decide that C just doesn't work for a systems programming language in the late 20th century, you have a lot of choices.</p>

<p>Perl, Javascript, Ruby and Python share almost the exact same expressiveness, and in a pinch I wouldn&#8217;t be unhappy about having to work in any of those. The order in which I listed them is my order of preference &#8211; yes, I like Javascript better than Ruby.</p><p>The absence of proper block scope is common to all of these languages except Perl, btw.</p><p>(Note that Ruby 1.9 will fix block scoping &#8211; but only for closures, not in general, thereby adding to its already large pile of non-composable one-off features. Even Perl is more regular.)</p>
