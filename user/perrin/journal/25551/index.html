<p>The best thing about conferences is getting to meet people who I'm on mailing lists with but have never seen in person.  Some of them are people I've "talked" with, some are lurkers, some are talkative on lists where I'm mostly a lurker.  Regardless, it's always great when someone walks up and says "Hi, I know you from the ____ list and I just wanted to say hello in person."
<p>So, to all those people who did just that at YAPC, thanks, and pleased to meet you.</p>

<h2>Ahoy, Perrin!</h2>

I enjoyed your talk on MVC applications for Perl, though I never got over to shake your hand.
<p>Do you have any plans to write an article about your topic, as you did with the wonderful templating tools article?</p>

Thanks!  Yes, I plan to make it into an article.  Right now I am reworking it for OSCON, to make it fit the time limit better.

<h2>Friendly conference</h2>

I found this was one of the more friendly conferences for that type of thing. I think Canada brought the best out of people<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

Perrin,
<p>
Pleased to meet you, too, again.  (Been a few conference since last we ran into each other.)
</p><p>
Thanks for your talk at the conference, and I hope you enjoyed your time here.   Sorry I didn't have more time to say hi and hang out.  I was... distracted.

</p><p>
Cheers,<br>
Richard</p>
