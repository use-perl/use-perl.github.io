<p>I see from <a href="http://use.perl.org/article.pl?sid=04/10/12/2124201&tid=16&tid=40">this story</a> that someone is still using HTML::EP and wants to convince others to use it.  I intentionally left HTML::EP out of my templating roundup because it was not actively maintained and didn't have the level of caching needed to compete with the others on performance.  (Yes, I know, perfect code doesn't need new releases, but things change over time and no release for multiple years is not a good sign.)  It used to be one of the most interesting ones, with a nice design based around HTML::Parser, but eventually got eclipsed by new features in other systems which are now much more widely used.<p>
There are still people out there using ePerl too.  We get a mail now and then on the mod_perl list asking for help because it won't even compile on newer Perl releases.  I wonder if some of the others that seem like leaders today will fall by the wayside in a few years as their maintainers lose interest and their user-communities look elsewhere.</p>

<h2>eperl still alive and well in debian</h2>

For kicks I downloaded the current version of eperl
from cpan it is indeed quite unhappy( and full of yucky  c code and configure scripts to boot).
<br> <br>
There is however a debian package that seems to be actively maintained( last release Feb 2004 ). Now sure why the updates are not reaching cpan.

Frankly, I can't see a good reason to maintain it.  It has been replaced by Text::Template, Template::Toolkit, Apache::ASP, Mason, etc.  I would definitely steer people away from ePerl at this point.
