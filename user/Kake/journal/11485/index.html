<p><p>Sometimes you just have to stop whining, and write some code.  I was spending far too much time and energy telling everyone that I didn't understand any of this RDF and RSS stuff, so I spent the weekend stealing other people's code and writing <a href="http://search.cpan.org/author/KAKE/CGI-Wiki-Plugin-RSS-ModWiki/">an RSS plugin for CGI::Wiki</a> (see it <a href="http://the.earth.li/user/kake/cgi-bin/cgi-wiki/wiki.cgi?action=rss">in action</a> on <a href="http://the.earth.li/user/kake/cgi-bin/cgi-wiki/wiki.cgi?Home">my grubstreet clone</a>).  Of course I still don't know what I'm doing, since <a href="http://search.cpan.org/author/KELLAN/XML-RSS/">XML::RSS</a> is doing all the actual work, but at least I'm doing it.</p>

<p><a href="http://0xff.org/accretion.pl?Kake">My to-do list</a> now has a home in cyberspace, appropriately enough on a wiki.  The thing I will probably spend most of my next few spare evenings on is carrying on with the <a href="http://chefmoz.org/rdf/elements/1.0/">ChefMoz</a> stuff that I'm doing <a href="http://esw.w3.org/topic/RestaurantRecommendation">in collaboration with danbri</a>.</p>

I checked out your ToDo list implenented as a wiki and that's just what I needed.  We also run Twiki within our org, but I wanted something personal and private and fast and the <a href="http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?UseModWiki" title="usemod.com">UseMod</a usemod.com> wiki code looks like the ticket.<br/><br/>I grabbed 0xff's CSS file too, because I'm lame-o.

<p>Excellent!  I highly recommend UseMod as a quick and simple way to get a wiki running.  Oh, and I love the formatting conventions; powerful yet simple.  I was satisfied with it for ages, until I wanted to hack on it; I find the code very hard to understand, and it's very intertwingled with itself and has no tests.  If and when you want to extend usemod, take a look at <a href="http://search.cpan.org/author/KAKE/CGI-Wiki/" title="cpan.org">CGI::Wiki</a cpan.org>, which owes a great debt of motivation to usemod, and can be used to emulate a usemod wiki.  I'm disappointed that I've not managed to get any of the usemod developers interested in it.</p>

<p>The 0xff stylesheet should not be credited to me; it's the work of the well cool <a href="http://downlode.org/" title="downlode.org">Earle Martin</a downlode.org>, my partner in crime.</p>

might poke dngor about usemod. poe.perl.org runs on a very hacked version of usemod that is much easier to use. and did i mention that its template driven?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br> <br>i do believe its in poe's cvs repository on sf.net if you're interested.
