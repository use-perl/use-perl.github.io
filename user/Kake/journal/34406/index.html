<div class="span8">
<p><p>So I figured I should probably write something here about why I didn't 
go to YAPC::Europe this year, even though I was supposed to go and 
moderate a hackathon.</p> 
 
<p>The problem was that I was supposed to moderate a hackathon.</p> 
 
<p>For various reasons, there are some things that I find very very
difficult, even though my skills and experience mean that I should be 
quite capable of them.  Doing things in person at specific times comes 
under this.  I'm not going to go into details, but I don't mean 
reasons like "is too disorganised to prepare a presentation in time", 
or "doesn't feel like getting out of bed in the morning" Ã¢â¬â it's more 
systemic and less easy to overcome than that.</p> 
 
<p>The thing is that <i>because</i> I should be quite capable of things like 
running a training session, giving a live demonstration, moderating a 
hackathon, or indeed working full-time, it's very hard for other 
people to understand that these things are more difficult for me 
than they would be for most other people with my skills and 
motivation.  This means that when I say "no, I can't do that", other 
people hear "I'm scared to do that", or "I need you to talk me into 
doing that", and hence they proceed to try to talk me into doing it. 
Because I am a nice person, and I like to oblige, this sometimes leads 
to me agreeing to do something that I really shouldn't.</p> 
 
<p>(I do want to say here that I'm <i>absolutely not</i> saying anything 
against the people who encouraged me to propose the OpenGuides 
hackathon at YAPC.  With most people, what you did would have been 
absolutely the right thing to do.  The reason I'm writing this now is 
that I recognise that my situation is unusual enough to require 
documentation.)</p> 
 
<p>So, when I found myself at the point where the situation had been 
affecting my work and personal life for months, and I was seriously 
contemplating cutting up my passport (and perhaps more) so nobody 
could <i>make</i> me go to Vienna, I realised that I had to pull out.  So I 
did.</p> 

<p>Some people have wondered why I didn't just cancel the hackathon and 
go to the conference anyway.  Because of the way I am, I have spent 
far too much of my life apologising for dropping out of things.  I've 
had people call me rude, lazy, stupid, inconsiderate, and 
unprofessional, and I'm sure there are a number of people in the Perl 
community who consider me unemployable.  So I hope people can 
understand why I didn't want to go to Vienna that week, in that 
context, as a failure, again.</p>
 
<p><small>This postscript is for the people who are going to pop up and suggest 
that I try therapy or drugs or NLP or something to "fix" myself.</small></p> 
 
<p><small>Over the many many years that this has been the case, I have indeed 
put a lot of effort into trying to "fix" the "problem", but with time 
I've realised that this effort could be better spent somewhere else Ã¢â¬â 
for example, in doing things that I actually can accomplish well and 
efficiently.  And in this, I am mostly succeeding.  The work that 
remains to be done lies not in wasting more energy trying to change 
myself into a "normal" person, but in getting better at saying "no" 
and sticking to it.</small></p></p>
