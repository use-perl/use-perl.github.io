<p><p>I've just released CGI::Wiki 0.10 - the observant will notice
there are a few versions missing since the last released one,
0.05.  This wasn't just to save myself the trouble of uploading a few mistakes before finally getting it right, but to flag a small interface change.
I have documented the change in the pod, the example, README and Changes, and added some temporary code to warn if it's called with obsolete parameters, but I still worry that this is going to annoy people.  Oh well, I doubt anyone's using this live yet, anyway.</p>

<p>Next thing to do is finish the SQLite backend to Search::InvertedIndex &#8212; it's passing about two-thirds of its tests now.  Then write a wrapper around Search::InvertedIndex to cope with phrase searching (already have an idea of how to do this, planted there by its author via email).</p>

<p>And at some point I need to prod chromatic again about my suggested changes to Text::WikiFormat -- I need to be able to support usemod-style formatting.</p>

<p>Finally there's my silly modules to attend to &#8212; I was foolish enough to write a screenscaper for <a href="http://grault.net/grubstreet/">a Wiki</a>, which although really quite useful for finding <a href="http://the.earth.li/user/kake/cgi-bin/grubsearch.cgi">food</a> and <a href="http://the.earth.li/user/kake/cgi-bin/pubsearch.cgi">drink</a> in London, does require quite a lot of babysitting as people change the site around me :)  (Code is in the WWW::Grubstreet modules, not CPANned for obvious reasons, but <a href="http://the.earth.li/user/kake/code/">available on my website</a>.)</p></p>

At some point I need to process a huge backlog of patches...<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

<p>Ah, only one of those is mine, I think<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)  Although maybe it should have been two &#8212; just ask if you want me to split it up to make it easier to evaluate, or indeed if there's any other way I can help.  I've had a couple of people asking me about more extended formatting now.</p>

<p>
You're only one of several people to blame.  That <a href="/user/pdcawley/" title="perl.org">Piers</a perl.org>  fellow had several interesting suggestions for Test::MockObject.
</p>
<p>
I think smaller patches would be easier to evaluate, though.  If you do that, I'll definitely take a look next week on holidays.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
