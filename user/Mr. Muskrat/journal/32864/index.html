I think I'm up to 5 or 6 times now.<br><br>I used to reply that I just wasn't interested, now I just push to see how far they are willing to go (would they be interested in paying me to work on my own code etc), and at some point they stop replying.<br>

<p>That's interesting.  I had been contacted once before but by an external recruiter.  I was wondering if I should take this one seriously since he's an in-house recruiter.

</p><p>I was initially going to post something along the lines of "Should I be flattered or insulted?"</p>

<p>It's one thing if he contacted me because he thought that I would be a good  fit.  If he's contacting everyone he could find then that's a totally different thing.</p>

I applied for a job once and have been contacted by Google recruiters twice since then. The second time I wasn't interested enough to go through a half dozen 45 minute calls (which is what the second interview process was) so I replied saying I would only be interested if I could skip the phone interviews. Their reply included<br><br>"If you are successful in your application a telephone interview would be conducted in the evening time."<br><br>which left me feeling insulted. If they are going to contact me I think I should be guaranteed at least a phone interview. Otherwise they are just cv fishing.

<h2>Me Too</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/chromatic/">chromatic</a> on 2007-04-01T06:37:54</h3>
<p>I went along with it, just to see what would happen.  It was for a position much less fun than my current work (though living in California would be much less fun for me than many other things).</p>



<h2>Answers</h2>

Since you asked:
<ol> <li>Yes, once, 2 months ago</li>
<li>No, I'm not considering moving abroad, at least, not that far &mdash; the closest job locations were in Ireland and Switzerland</li>
</ol>

<h3><a href="/user/barbie/">barbie</a> on 2007-04-01T09:50:58</h3>
Likewise on both accounts, even though Ireland isn't that far away for me. I was quite flattered, as at least they've taken the trouble to find people who might be appropriate. Having previously recruited for technical positions, it can be extremely difficult to encourage candidates to get in touch with you. The fact they seemed to have tried to contact technically capable and potentially suitable candidates, is quite nice to hear.

<h2>Two in less than a week</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ajt/">ajt</a> on 2007-04-01T16:08:27</h3>
<p>
I got two about a week apart early this year. One to by email address obtained from my <a href="http://iredale.dyndns.org/blog/" title="dyndns.org">blog</a dyndns.org>, the second from to my CPAN address. I asked around and several people I know have had them too, but they weren't willing to move to Dublin or Zurich. In both cases they had done some basic research (easily automated if you are Google) and the job on offer was appropriate and interesting.
</p>

<p>
One the one hand you could say it's a sign of desperation, on the other hand you could say that enlightened pro-active recruitment is more efficient than waiting for people to apply. I don't know.

<h2>5 or 6 times now</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/renodino/">renodino</a> on 2007-04-01T16:40:14</h3>
...but I didn't bother to respond, so they stopped.<p>

Not a knock on Google, indeed its a bit flattering (I once got a cold call from MSFT too - on the phone, no less -, which was also flattering, but of no interest).</p><p>

I suppose if I had the ability to tolerate the urban desolation of SillyCon Valley, I might be interested. Rumors of a major installation going up near The Dalles has, however, piqued my curiousity.</p><p>

My highly subjective sense is Google has tapped out the Phd crowd, and/or internal productivity is declining as early employees' attention is diverted by bloated options. They may have also discovered that many Phd's can't code their way out of wet paper bags, so people that actually deliver real code may be of more value than earlier thought.</p><p>



<h2>2 times.. kinda</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Beatnik/">Beatnik</a> on 2007-04-02T06:18:18</h3>
I got a first email about 9 months ago.. for a technical management position (OMGWTFBBQ?!?).. and I talked to a Google guy at YAPC::Eu and was going for a linux admin position in Zurich for a few weeks.. That was about 6 months ago.



<h2>Yes</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/drhyde/">drhyde</a> on 2007-04-02T11:50:50</h3>
Yes, got one a few months ago, I replied telling them that I wasn't interested in moving to either Zurich or Dublin but might be interested in London.  We exchanged a couple of emails but their London office at the time wasn't doing anything me-ish.



<h2>I know how you should respond</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jdavidb/">jdavidb</a> on 2007-04-02T17:41:55</h3>
<p>I don't know how other people have responded, but I know how you should:</p>

<p>"I live in the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex and wouldn't leave the state of Texas, so unless this is a telecommuting position, I regret to inform you that I'm not interested."<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

Google does have an office here in Dallas (or <a href="http://www.google.com/maps?q=google&amp;near=Dallas,+TX&amp;radius=0.0&amp;latlng=32783333,-96800000,10011071837915400035&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=local&amp;ct=authority&amp;cd=3" title="google.com">Las Colinas</a google.com>, it seems).  No programmer <a href="http://www.google.com/support/jobs/bin/topic.py?loc_id=1121&amp;dep_id=1173" title="google.com">positions though</a google.com>.

<h3><a href="/user/Mr. Muskrat/">Mr. Muskrat</a> on 2007-04-02T19:03:25</h3>
That's a good answer for several reasons.  It points out my love of Texas and keeps me from telling the recruiter what I really think of his recruitment tactics.

<h2>What's their criteria</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/dhorne/">dhorne</a> on 2007-04-11T22:56:01</h3>
I got an email from a Google recruiter about 6 months ago, I guess. It seemed to be some sort of network programming/admin role. Totally outside of my field of expertise, and certainly didn't seem worth contacting someone from New Zealand for.
