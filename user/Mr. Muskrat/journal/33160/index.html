<p><p>Continuing the discussion that was started at <a href="http://use.perl.org/comments.pl?sid=35366&op=&threshold=0&commentsort=0&mode=thread&cid=54702">Spindletop</a>.</p>
<p>Spinnaker was pretty fun if dizzying.  I only got sick on it once in my life and that was when I rode it after eating a Pink Thing.</p>
<p>LaSalle's Riverboat Expedition was good fun as a kid even after I knew it was all fake.</p>
<p>I was kind of glad when they took out the Caddo War Canoes.  They used to wear me out.</p>
<p>Another ride I used to like was Big Bend (a big, red roller coaster).  It was located over what is now Aquaman (formerly Splashwater Falls) and the Wildcatter (formerly the Cliff Hanger).</p>
<p>Thinking back even further to when I was really young.  Spee-Lunker's Cave scared me.  :D  Oh and I can remember the big, orange, smoking volcano in the Mexico or Spain sections.  I believe it was called Ferrocarril Fiesta Train (if Wikipedia is right).</p></p>

<h2>Sounds like you hit the real glory days</h2>

<p>Some of those were before my time.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<p>You might like <a href="http://parktimes.com/" title="parktimes.com">http://parktimes.com/</a parktimes.com> .  I know that when I started going to Six Flags again (three or four dates with the woman who is now my wife, after over ten years of not going) I was quite disappointed to see the changes, and that site brought back a lot of good memories.</p>

<p>I never got to see the Riverboat expedition.  I think that became Roaring Rapids.  I can remember when Roaring Rapids was new, and I can remember the year before that, but I didn't get to ride whatever was there before.  This was when I was about 4, btw.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<p>I never saw the Big Bend or the Volcano, either.</p>

<p>I hate all the name changes.  I see Splashwater Falls has changed again.  When I was there a few years back it was just "Splash Water" or something like that.  I can still remember the notes of the song in the "Splashwater Falls" commercial.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<p>I never rode Spinnaker.  My mother heard someone was killed on an equivalent ride somewhere.  Probably an urban legend.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)  But to this day the thought of riding it scares me, and I could never understand why people rode it when it was so dangerous.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<p>Cave never scared me, except maybe the big spider in it.  Of all the disappointments of ride changes at Six Flags, the death of the Cave is probably the biggest.  I wanted those things to be there forever for my children to see.</p>

<p>Speaking of which, Six Flags is no longer a family park.  It used to be parents taking their children for a special "time of their life."  Now it's a bunch of teenagers.  It used to be a lot of neat rides for the whole family.  Now it's a bunch of rollercoasters.  We never rode the coasters when I was a boy (unless you count the Mine Trains), so they aren't part of the experience for me.  (Although I now have memories of riding them with Sarah.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) ).</p>

<p>In my day, Six Flags had two coasters.  That was it.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

Wow.  I'm definitely going to bookmark that one.  The layout is a bit... off but the pictures and descriptions are wonderful.  <a href="http://parktimes.com/sections/mexico/fiesta.htm" title="parktimes.com">fiesta train</a parktimes.com> shows the volcano (which was apparently only a small part of the entire ride but it's the part I remembered).

<p>I used to hear stories about the Volcano all the time.  Apparently it's the only part anybody remembered.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>
