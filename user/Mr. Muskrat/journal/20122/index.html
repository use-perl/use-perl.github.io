<p><p>I need a guru to come out to Dallas for the next D/FW Perl Mongers meeting.  It will be the fourth Tuesday in August.  It's short notice so I am going to have to work fast.</p>
<p>I'm making a list of people that we want to see.  Some of them are listed on pm.org's guru list so I know that they do this sort of thing; others are not but that page appears to be a bit out of date.  I will be researching whether or not they speak at Perl Mongers' functions and then contacting those who do to find out if any of them are available for that time frame.</p>
<p>Working list in no particular order:
<ul><li>Mark-Jason Dominus</li><li>Randal Schwartz - his plan shows him as being free that week</li><li>Joseph N. Hall</li><li>Damian Conway</li><li>brian d foy</li><li>Andy Lester</li><li>Jarkko Hietaniemi - It's a bit far to go for a PM meeting talk but you never know.</li></ul></p>
<p>I know that I have forgotten someone though...</p></p>

<h2>Scratch MJD from this one</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Mr. Muskrat/">Mr. Muskrat</a> on 2004-07-29T01:35:48</h3>
MJD would like to come but has some other responsibilities that will keep near home for about a year.  I made a note to bug him again next summer though.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)



<h2>I'm po'</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/brian_d_foy/">brian_d_foy</a> on 2004-07-29T04:36:54</h3>
Tad McClellan is in Dallas, or at least the Dallas area.<br> <br>Is there any chance of mitigating plane fare?  I'd think about coming out, but we just blew a bunch of money on our wedding and <i>The Perl Review</i> and the O'Reilly conference, so I'm kinda poor at the moment.  I could probably make it up to some local company with a couple of hours of free consulting.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

<h2>Sponser</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Mr. Muskrat/">Mr. Muskrat</a> on 2004-07-29T11:55:09</h3>
<p>I forgot to mention that we a sponser for this meeting.  I want the sponser to have more than one person to choose from so I will be attempting to contact each person on my list regardless of any posting here (as well as any I have forgotten that come up later).  I have contacted a few of the gurus already and will contacting the rest today if time permits.</p>



<h2>Adding some I missed...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Mr. Muskrat/">Mr. Muskrat</a> on 2004-07-30T01:22:12</h3>
<ul>
<li>Nat Torkington - contacted</li>
<li>Simon Cozens</li>
<li>Jeffrey Friedl</li>
</ul>



<h2>Whew</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Mr. Muskrat/">Mr. Muskrat</a> on 2004-07-30T03:58:43</h3>
Okay, everyone that I mentioned here has been contacted.  A few of them have even responded.  Stay tuned for further developments.



<h2>Replies</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Mr. Muskrat/">Mr. Muskrat</a> on 2004-08-03T04:58:34</h3>
Everyone that I contacted has replied except for one: Joseph Hall.  There were a few that I knew would not want to come out for one night but asked anyway.  Of those that replied, we are down to one candidate (BTW, that the sponser thinks "would be *great*").  If it doesn't work out, I have another list of people that could have (or should have) been on the original list.
