<p><p>I really love Texas; especially North central Texas. It doesn't get too hot for too long (low to mid-100s a few days a year) nor does it get too cold (very mild winters).  It also has some pretty interesting weather.  There is always an abundance of thunderstorms to watch.  There are tornadoes to chase.** And today we had snow.  It didn't last long and there was no chance of any accumulation but it was definitely snowing.  We get to watch the best part (the snow fall) without having to deal with the mud and muck that accumulation brings. How great is that?  I really love Texas.</p>

<p>** Yes, I know we're not supposed to do it and it's not like we do it all the time.  Mary and I started doing this when I was living in Kansas.  I guess we needed a little more excitement in our lives.  :)</p>

<p>I'm out in East Texas visiting inlaws and flurries started while Sarah and I were driving to a friend's.  I called my dad back home (DFW) to let him know it was snowing here and brag, and was surprised to hear it was going on there, too.</p>

<p>Really weird way to spend an easter.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>



<h2>Snow?</h2>

I guess I probably slept through it.
