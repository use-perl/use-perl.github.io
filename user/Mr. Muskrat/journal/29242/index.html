<p><p>I am starting to get more targeted advertising in my inbox.  I received the following in email today and it wasn't marked as spam. (URLs, company name and offender's sig have removed since I really don't want to promote them.)</p>
<blockquote>
Hello,<br />
<br />
I am found your CPAN Perl module by cpan.org today. I am one of tech people by *URL* hosting company what support Perl and Perl Catalyst Framework developers.<br />
<br />
You as CPAN module developer can receive DOUBLE web space as normal customer by *URL* and FREE Perl Catalyst Framework (http://www.catalystframework.org) included ($36 value). Catalyst Framework is really surprising Perl solution, but 98% of hosting companies still not support Catalyst.<br />
<br />
*URL* have radically low cost web hosting packages with FREE .com, .net, .org, .info, .biz, .us, .name, but you as CPAN author can be have more 'sponsored' features: simply, inform *Company* support that you are CPAN module author.<br />
<br />
If you have any new ideas about possible sponsoring Perl community you can submit your sponsoring advices here:<br />
<br />
*URL removed*<br />
<br />
Best Regards!<br />

This all started with an email to the Catalyst list about a hosting provider. It was unclear whether a human or a bot was the perp.<br><br>Then about an hour later, these emails started popping up to CPAN users; I'll assume CPAN users somehow tied to Catalyst modules.

I got one too, and I currently have no modules on CPAN, yet. So don't tie me to Catalyst!<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

I don't think it was just people with Catalyst associated modules, I think it was everyone on CPAN.<br><br>Silly silly spammers, a less forgiving target I can't imagine.<br>

I got one too, and I wouldn't classify it as real SPAM. It's unsolicited mail, ok, but I could be interested in the offer. Still, a post the catalyst and probably the mod_perl list would have been enough. Or they could by a banner ad on eg perlmonks

It IS spam and I have sent a mail to them and their hosting provider asking for it to stop. Just because the object being advertised is somewhat interesting to you doesn't mean it's not spam to the rest of us. Remember, the reason we all get 100s of Viagra ads into our mailboxes every day is that 1 out of every umpteenthousand recipients actually replies and orders some. So please don't use this offer, that'll just make the CPAN addresses more interesting to commercial spammers, which we can all do without.

I won't use it, mainly because I have as much use for (catalyst) hosting as for viagra. I agree, it's SPAM, but it's more "spam bacon sausage and spam" than proper "spam spam spam spam spam spam spam beaked beans spam spam spam and spam"<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

I was considering the exact same post! Damn you, quickpost Muskrat!<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
