<p><p>The dorm room feels like a freezer.  The beds remind me of the ones we had in basic training (plastic over stiff springs with a thin layer of padding); they produce a loud squeak every time you move in the slightest bit.  The doors have a tendency to slam if you let them close on their own which leads to being woken up at all times during the night.</p>
<p>Cog's intro to YAPC talk ("How to get the most out of YAPC") was very entertaining.  I don't remember a whole lot about the talks done by Larry Wall and Richard Dice.  Perhaps because the Houston room was also a freezer.  If it hadn't been for the coffee I don't think I could have made it til lunch.</p>
<p>I joined my wife in the Oberholtzer cafeteria for lunch.  $6.50 for all you can eat is a pretty good deal.</p>
<p>I must say that I really enjoyed the afternoon talks.  Josh McAdams and Barbie were entertaining while being educational.  Michael Peters while educational was less entertaining.</p>
<p>Casey West spent the better part of the morning sprucing up his slides.  He was humorous and energetic.  The slides really did look nice.  His examples were easy to understand.</p>
<p>Quite a few us met in the UC games room from 8:45 - 11:45 pm.  Mary and I bowled the entire time.  We're both terrible bowlers but we really enjoyed ourselves.  Brad Smithart and Kiran Kumar (both from DFW.pm) joined us after our first two games.  Patrick Michaud joined us for the final game.  Mary and I bowled five games in all and I am sore from head to toe today.</p>
