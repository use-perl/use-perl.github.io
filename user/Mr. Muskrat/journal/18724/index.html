<p><p>A couple of weeks ago my Sunday school teacher gave an assignment and I totally forgot about it.  Today, I was reminded of it so I'm doing it now.<br />The assignment was a simple one.  Ask people the following question:</p>
<p><b>What does it mean to be a Christian?</b></p></p>

Are you looking for answers from only those who identify as<br>Christians, or from the general public?<br>

Both.  I expect to get different answers from everyone.

<h2>Re:target audience?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/mary.poppins/">mary.poppins</a> on 2004-05-14T05:24:51</h3>
I see.  OK, here I go then:<br> <br>Any faith-based belief system is the triumph of wishful thinking<br>over rational consideration of reality.<br>

Hiya mary.poppins.<br> <br>That's a popular opinion held by many intellectuals (as I did for 15 years).  Keep in mind though, that fine peeps such as Donald Knuth and our very own Larry Wall hold strongly to such "wishful thinking".<br> <br>It's sad that the anti-evolution flat-earth Scopes and Gallileo Trials type stuff gets all the attention.  There's no shortage of rational, thinking, extremely intelligent men and women for whom faith is a major part of their lives.

I am aware that wishful thinking can be very appealing to<br>even very intelligent people.  Just because one is able to<br>think, does not imply that one wants to think.<br> <br>Here's definition #2 from the American Heritage Dictionary,<br>of faith:<br> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Belief that does not rest on logical proof or material<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; evidence.<br> <br>It's that definition of faith that I was referring to in my<br>comment about "faith-based belief systems".<br> <br>When supernatural beings start showing up in verifiable<br>ways, then I'll pay attention.  In the meantime, my working<br>theory is that it's all bunk.  Actually, it's harmful bunk,<br>because worrying about the fate of souls in the afterlife<br>distracts people from *real* problems that need fixing in<br>the shared *reality* we live in.<br> <br>It's hard enough to encourage people to think for themselves<br>(instead of accepting the line of authority figures), even<br>without a belief system which is predicated on suspension of<br>rationality.<br>

Hmmm... not sure what authority it sounded like I was appealing to, but I assure you none was intended.

<p>
And I offer my apologies for (incorrectly) assuming the bit about a college philosophy course. &nbsp; My bad. &nbsp; Although I do share your rationalist mindset.
</p>

In your readings on history, do you recall any mention of impetus from numerous Christians in:
<ul>
 <li> bringing about the abolition of slavery in the US</li>
 <li> working for widespread literacy in the west, when such was unheard of</li>
 <li> racial equality in the US in the mid 20th century</li>
 <li> establishment of manymany hospitals before such were common</li>
 <li> the US war of indpendance</li>
</ul>

<p>
The substantial and key involvement of Christians in these may not have mention in your high school or college history texts, but dig a bit deeper and you'll find that they're true. &nbsp; And if Christianity were a matter of doing more good than harm, one could easily compile a list of bad'uns like the crusades, Spanish inquisition, Scopes monkey trial, etc etc. &nbsp; But a good/bad ledger isn't what being a Christian is about, and that's not my point, yo. &nbsp; Look back through history and you'll find authoritarian totalitarian regimes all over the religious/atheistic map. &nbsp; Recent notables include Stalinist Russia, Cambodia, North Korea, communist China. &nbsp; Not much faith-base in those extreme examples.
</p>
<p>
Of course, some Christian groups are indeed (wrongly) authoritarian, and I share your disdain for such. &nbsp; As did Jesus himself with the hypocritical local politico-religious leaders of his time. &nbsp; He was so distressed and angry with them that he compared them with a den of snakes, and said that they were worse than murderers and thieves.
</p>
In any event, I respect your thoughts and opinions, and your right to express them. &nbsp; My own experiences and research have led me to different conclusions, but that's cool.

<p>You missed a few definitions of faith.<br>
   1. Confident belief in the truth, value, or trustworthiness of a person, idea, or thing.<br>
   2. Belief that does not rest on logical proof or material evidence. See Synonyms at belief. See Synonyms at trust.<br>
   3. Loyalty to a person or thing; allegiance: keeping faith with one's supporters.<br>
   4. often Faith Christianity. The theological virtue defined as secure belief in God and a trusting acceptance of God's will.<br>
   5. The body of dogma of a religion: the Muslim faith.<br>
   6. A set of principles or beliefs.<br>

<p>My faith (5) is based upon faith (1), faith (3), faith (4) and faith (6) as well as a whole lot of other things.  You will notice that I left out faith (2).  I did that because I have all of the material evidence and logical proof that <b>I</b> need.</p>
<p>Looking around at the earth or the stars in the heavens, I have all of the material evidence that I need.  It's absolutely stunning!  It's totally beautiful!  So I have my material proof, all of the earth and it's inhabitants.</p>
<p>How can anyone believe that all of this just happened?  That it's all just a string of coincidences that everything on this planet just happened to happen in such a way that we have not only have a nice place to live but also that we live and that all of the cosmos also exists.  Do you know the odds of that quite large string of coincidences occurring in the correct order to bring about a coincidence on the scale of the cosmos and yet still manage to put life on this planet?  It's astronomical!</p>
<p>I know a little something about the scientific teachings of today.  Law of Conservation of Matter: During an ordinary chemical change, there is no detectable increase or decrease in the quantity of matter.  The Law of Conservation of Energy states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, but can change its form.  </p>
<p>I also know that everything is made up of smaller components (except possibly for the elementary particles of quantum mechanics which are the smallest components that we know of right now).  Let's call everything that is not the smallest component, a composite.  I also know that composites, things made up of components, cannot cause their components to come into existance.   (For example, a water molecule cannot create the hydrogen and oxygen that it is made from in order to bring itself into existance.)  The universe is made up of composites of components and as such the universe cannot create the very building blocks of itself.</p>
<p>If the universe cannot create its components, and the components cannot just come into existance, then we can conclude that there must be an external power or entity, that is not the universe.  That power or entity is God.  So I have my logical proof.</p>
<p>God created a finite amount of matter and energy.  He crafted it all into the universe in which we live.  "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth." - Genesis 1:1</p>
<p>He saw fit to blow breath into the greatest of all creation, man.  "The LORD God formed the man from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living being. " - Genesis 2:7</p>

&gt; I did that because I have all of the material evidence and<br>&gt; logical proof that I need.<br> <br>Evidently, you do not need very much.  In fact, so little<br>that I think you are not being honest with yourself about<br>meaning #2.<br> <br>&gt; Looking around at the earth or the stars in the heavens, I<br>&gt; have all of the material evidence that I need. It's<br>&gt; absolutely stunning! It's totally beautiful!  So I have my<br>&gt; material proof, all of the earth and it's inhabitants.<br> <br>Hm.  You find the world beautiful.  This proves that (some<br>translation of the texts that comprise) the Christian Bible<br>is the word of a unseen supernatural entity?  Interesting.<br>I fail to see the connection.<br> <br>&gt; How can anyone believe that all of this just happened?<br>&gt; That it's all just a string of coincidences that<br>&gt; everything on this planet just happened to happen in such<br>&gt; a way that we have not only have a nice place to live but<br>&gt; also that we live and that all of the cosmos also exists.<br>&gt; Do you know the odds of that quite large string of<br>&gt; coincidences occurring in the correct order to bring about<br>&gt; a coincidence on the scale of the cosmos and yet still<br>&gt; manage to put life on this planet? It's astronomical!<br> <br>The odds of things being the way they are, independent of<br>the question of human existence, might indeed be very small.<br> <br>But that is not the situation.  It is a *given* that there<br>are humans around -- you're one of them!  So *given* that<br>humans exist, it's not just likely, but *necessary* that<br>humans live on a planet that can support them.<br> <br>Think of it this way:  *given* that you see the head of<br>Washington on a quarter, it is *implied* that the coin toss<br>was heads.  It's not some sort of odd coincidence that<br>suggests that there was some divine intervention in the coin<br>toss.<br> <br>Please, think this through carefully.  If it doesn't make<br>sense to you, talk it over with other people.  It's an<br>important principle that applies to lots of things, not just<br>cosmology.<br> <br>&gt; I know a little something about the scientific teachings<br>&gt; of today. Law of Conservation of Matter: During an<br>&gt; ordinary chemical change, there is no detectable increase<br>&gt; or decrease in the quantity of matter. The Law of<br>&gt; Conservation of Energy states that energy cannot be<br>&gt; created or destroyed, but can change its form.<br> <br>Up to a point -- atomic weapons, etc., would not work if<br>these laws were more than approximations.<br> <br>&gt; I also know that everything is made up of smaller<br>&gt; components (except possibly for the elementary particles<br>&gt; of quantum mechanics which are the smallest components<br>&gt; that we know of right now). Let's call everything that is<br>&gt; not the smallest component, a composite.

(For example, a<br>&gt; water molecule cannot create the hydrogen and oxygen that<br>&gt; it is made from in order to bring itself into existance.)<br>&gt; The universe is made up of composites of components and as<br>&gt; such the universe cannot create the very building blocks<br>&gt; of itself.<br> <br>A strange argument.  Stars produce oxygen, starting from<br>protons, through several fusion reactions.  Matter and<br>energy are actually interconvertible, in any case.<br> <br>Did you come up with these arguments yourself, or did you<br>hear them from someone with little knowledge of physics?<br> <br>&gt; If the universe cannot create its components, and the<br>&gt; components cannot just come into existance, then we can<br>&gt; conclude that there must be an external power or entity,<br>&gt; that is not the universe. That power or entity is God.  So<br>&gt; I have my logical proof.<br> <br>Here are some possibilities omitted from your argument:<br> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 1)  The laws you referenced above are approximations<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 2)  Physical laws are not constant over time<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 3)  The power or entity is not the Christian God, but<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; actually a Great and Wise Sea Turtle.<br> <br>Note that (1) is true, and (2) is possible, though I<br>consider (3) unlikely.<br> <br>&gt; God created a finite amount of matter and energy. He<br>&gt; crafted it all into the universe in which we live. "In the<br>&gt; beginning God created the heavens and the earth." -<br>&gt; Genesis 1:1<br> <br>What is the point of quoting Genesis here?  Lots of oral<br>traditions have creation stories.  You could choose any of<br>them, and irrationally assert their truth, but I'd still<br>find it entirely unconvincing.<br> <br>

<p>Look, I am not trying to win you over to Christ.  This is too impersonal a medium for that.  I am trying to show you a glimpse of how I, a christian, see things.  I am not saying that you must read this or that you must believe what I am trying to say.  I doubt that you will even understand it but I am not going to let that stop me from saying it though.</p>
<p>If you read the paragraphs about material evidence together it makes more sense than seperately, but whatever.  Read it however you like.</p>
<p>If you listen to non-christians talk about the origins of the cosmos, our planet and life on this little planet, they claim that there was this big explosion and all of the gases expanded outward.  They say that the conditions were just right, that as those gases cooled off, they came together and formed the stars and planets.  They also say that the conditions were just right for life to form on this tiny, little speck that we call earth.  They also claim that the conditions were just right for life to evolve to the point that we are at now, with humans being highly intellegent beings.  That's a pretty big string of coincidences that could never, ever possibly happen because it all started out with a fallacy.  Where did the energy for the "big bang" come from?  What about the gases that were supposedly thrust outward?  They can't answer those questions and that is what I was trying to point out.  The gases and energy had to come from somewhere.  Matter and energy do not just spring into existance unless there is an omnipotent Creator, God is generally what I call Him, to make them spring into existance.  Science must follow its own rules and frankly, all theories that do not include God disobey those very rules.  (Yeah, God disobeys our rules too but then again, He isn't bound to our rules.  He's God.  He plays by His own rules.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)</p>
<p>I do not understand what point you are trying to make about the coin toss.  Are you saying that you did or did not see the coin toss?  If you saw it, then it is not implied that it landed on heads, you would have seen the coin toss and know that it landed on heads.  If you did not see the coin toss, you cannot imply anything about the coin toss except that it either landed on heads or tails.</p>
<p>Strange argument?  You're just furthering my point that about the conservation of matter and energy.  That star you talk about, it's a big burning ball of gases.  Lots of gases.  It's producing quite an enormous amount of energy by "burning" the gases.  (Yes, I'm simplying greatly.)  It's also rearranging molecules.  So it could very well produce oxygen.  It doesn't produce it from nothing, it's only using what it already has.  It can't produce something from nothing anymore than the void can spring forth gases and energy to create a universe.</p>
<p>Being the American that I am, I attended and yes, even graduated from high school.  While in high school, I took three years of science.  While I am not sure how it happened, some time in those three years, I was actually taught a thing or two about the science that was known at the point in time.  It's a wonder that I remember any of it at all.  I have probably gotten quite a bit of it wrong.  It really doesn't matter because it makes sense to <b>me</b>.</p>
<p>The point of quoting Genesis?  It's my Holy book.  I quote from it quite often.  Moreso, now that I am reading it on a regular basis.  You should try reading it sometime.  There's more than just religion in there.  You might even... *gasp* learn something from it.  Proverbs is chocked full of wisdom.  Psalm is a good source for studying literature.  (Poetry, good stuff!)  The Bible is also a good source of historical data.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Going back to one of your first paragraphs, yes I am human but not for long.  For you see, one day my body will be transformed.  I will live forever.  Say what you will, I know where I will spend all of eternity.  I will be in heaven, praising the God that created the universe.  The God that loves us all so very much.  He loves us so much that He sent His only Son, Christ Jesus, the One and Only Messiah, to live among us for about 33 years so that we could learn more about God through Him.  God know that Jesus would be put to death as a common criminal.  God also knew that the blood of His Son would be the only price high enough to atone for the sins of every generation of man.  I thank God that He loves us.  I thank Jesus for dying for us.  I thank the Holy Spirit for leading me to salvation.</p>
<p>Peace be with you.  I will be praying for you.</p>

of another assignment, but better suited to people who have a real training in history of religions: write a concise answer to this same question, written by a more-or-less well-known figure of the history of christianism. (St Augustine, Luther, Erasmus, Giordano Bruno -- who was burnt by the papal inquisition, mostly for having defended an heliocentric view of the world --, St Francesco Javier -- cofounder of Jesuits, first missionary in Japan --, Jansenius -- who influenced Blaise Pascal --, Pius IX -- author of the famous bull quanta cura e syllabus --, etc...)

<h2>What it means (to me) to be a Christian</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ybiC/">ybiC</a> on 2004-05-13T13:28:40</h3>
Speaking for no-one but myself...
<p>
Being a Christian means <i>(to me)</i> to follow and obey our namesake Jesus Christ.  When there are apparant conflicts between teachings of Jesus and that of Moses, Paul, etc to always go with what Jesus is recorded as saying.
</p><p>
Being a Christian means <i>(to me)</i> to treat everyone I encounter with respect, as a fellow human being, whether they be an underpayed waitress or an online community member who disses me.  It means loving others even when they don't act lovable.
<p>
Being a Christian means <i>(to me)</i> to be upfront with others of my faith, yet not force it on them. To demonstrate that, despite all-too-common stereotypes, that a Christian can be deep and real with their beliefs yet still be a decent fellow to hang with.
<p>
Being a Christian means <i>(to me)</i> to do nothing out of habit or ritual, rather to think about what I believe and why I believe it.  To check my beliefs against my experiences, and continuously reconcile the two.
<p>
Being a Christian means <i>(to me)</i> that I consciously recognize and acknowledge that I'm just as messed up a person as the worst axe-murderer or embezzler, and that only be turning to Jesus am I forgiven and made whole.
<p>
Being a Christian means <i>(to me)</i> to trust Jesus and rely on him.  To strive to love him more than anything else, and strive to able and ready to give up anything that would come between us.
<p>
Being a Christian means <i>(to me)</i> to seek out friendships with other Christians to encourage and support each other, but also to seek out friendships and significant interactions with people of other faiths (and no faiths at all).
<p>
Being a Christian means <i>(to me)</i> a bunch of other stuff, but the above should be a pretty good highlight/summary, and I've probably rambled on enough already.  Good luck on your homework assignment, Muskrat!



<h2>It doesn't have a clear meaning</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/btilly/">btilly</a> on 2004-05-13T16:19:10</h3>
Christianity is a collection of religions in the Judeo-Christian lineage.  They vary widely in outline and detail.  Membership in any one of them is understood differently by different members.  There is some disagreement about which religions deserve the label.  Most of them agree on their primary religious text (the Bible).  Attitudes towards the Bible vary widely.  (Is it literally true, a historical document, to be interpreted by everyone, interpreted by a special priesthood, how are specific items to be interpreted, etc, etc, etc.)<br> <br><br/><br/>Here's a sample that illustrates the variety:
<ol>
<li> <i>Catholic</i> There are a couple of dozen faiths that believe that the Bishop of Rome (aka the Pope) has special status.  There are a couple of dozen varieties, of which the best known is Roman Catholic.  (The Pope is Roman Catholic.)  The Roman Catholic Church claims to be the oldest continuous human organization in existence.  They may be right.</li>
<li> <i>Eastern Orthodox</i> They split from the Catholics over the question of whether the Bishop of Rome is equal to all other Bishops, or not.  Over close to 2000 years, they have diverged considerably in practice.</li>
<li> <i>Protestant</i> There was a great schism in the Roman Catholic faith started with Martin Luther.  (No, not the civil rights leader.  This was considerably before.)  The many varieties of Protestants vary widely, but generally believe that individual worshippers have a right and duty to understand the Bible for themselves.</li>
<li> <i>Mormon</i> One of many splinter faiths that adds additional religious texts onto the original.  Many do not consider them to be Christian.</li>
<li> etc...</li>

There's substantial debate over who split from whom - Roman Catholics and Eastern Orthodox. And for divergence in practice, Eastern Orthodoxy (and others, such as Coptic) seems to have retained much more of the earlie(r|est) practices and style, whereas Roman Catholicism has added and changed both practices and doctrine substantially over the centuries/millenia. Fwiw, I don't subscribe exclusively to either of these two branches of Christianity.<br> <br>Islam isn't arbitrarily not considered Christian, by either Muslims or Christians, although it's generally accepted as among the Judeo-Christian line. The status of Mohammed and the Quran are among the major differentiators.<br> <br>But those are pretty much minor quibbles on what's otherwise a pretty darn good historical/doctrinal outline. Keep in mind, though, that for most peeps of a spiritual bent (regardless of religion) that their faith in(clud|volv)es muchmuchmuch more than history and doctrine.<br> <br>And as a Christian, I also don't see it as my place to dispute how Christian anyone else is. 8^)

<p>I do not know enough about about the Muslim faith to comment on it.</p>
<p>If you want to get technical, a Christian is literally a follower of Christ.  Since the Jewish people have never recognized Christ as the Messiah, they cannot be called Christians.  By that I mean collectively, the Jewish people, not individual Jews.  Why?  Because many Jews between the time of Christ and now have believed in Christ and made Him their personal Savior.</p>



<h2>Islam != Christianity</h2>

Now that'uns easy to answer.<br> <br>Adherants of Islam aren't considered Christian (by either Muslims or Christians) because Islam does not subscribe to the foundational Christian belief that Jesus of Nazereth is/was the Jewish Messiah.  Islamic stature of Mohammed and the Quran are additional points of differentientation, of course.  But the over-riding primary commonality amongst all flavors of Christianity is pretty much the recognition of Jesus as Messiah, the Christ.<br> <br>Likewise for Judaism, excluding Messianic Jews of course.<br> <br>All three (Judaism, Christianity, and Islam) are monotheistic (one God), are "of the book" (albeit different books), and they share substantial chunks o'(pre)history, but in reality the differences are much greater than the similarities.  The distinctions aren't arbitrary at all, they run deep, and result in dramatically different mindsets and worldviews.
