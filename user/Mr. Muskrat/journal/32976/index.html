<h2>Memory jog</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/VSarkiss/">VSarkiss</a> on 2007-04-13T14:31:56</h3>
<p>I <i>knew</i> there was a reason I got into the habit of typing semicolons and slashes on a line by themselves.  There are probably other weirdnesses too.</p>

I've always put the slash on a line by itself.  I had a file with hundreds of lines in it all terminated with semicolons.  Recently I went into the file and added some comments.  Two of the comments I added after semicolons.  This is not the first time I've done this with the same results and I don't want to make this mistake a third time.  I made sure to tell everyone in my group about this behavior in the hope that they also won't make the same mistake.

<h2>Interface between two languages</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jdavidb/">jdavidb</a> on 2007-04-13T15:14:16</h3>
<p>I agree this is bad design, but I think it springs from the subtle difference between the Oracle SQL language and the SQL*Plus program language.  Oracle is a madness of interfacing between different languages: PL/SQL, SQL, and SQL*Plus are three <i>separate</i> languages to learn, and they all tend to embed each other.  I remember having to explain about three times to a former manager why I could not run an SQL*Plus report from PL/SQL stored in the database before she finally got it.</p>

<p>Strangely enough, even though I believe the SQL standard provides for ; as a statement terminator, I think that / and ; are actually processed only by SQL*Plus.  I know for a fact if you pass in a ; in OCI or DBI you'll get an error because Oracle's SQL can't handle it.  So, the minute SQL sees ; or / it knows that this "string" is done (the string is a string of characters which are going to be passed to the (PL/)SQL engine), and it goes back to SQL*Plus command mode, and you lose the ability to do PL/SQL comments.</p>
