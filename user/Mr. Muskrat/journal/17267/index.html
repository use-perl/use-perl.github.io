<div class="span8">
<p><p>I was checking out the <a href="http://www.cafeshops.com/perlmonks,perlmonks_too,pm_more">PerlMonks.org store</a> at CafePress when I noticed that they are <a href="http://www.cafepress.com/cp/info/about/employment.aspx">hiring</a>.  So I thought I'd read up on the <a href="http://www.cafepress.com/cp/info/about/employment.aspx#developer">Senior Software Engineer</a> position.</p>
<p>All the times that I've browsed through the products at CafePress, I've never once really noticed that they were using ASP.    It's funny because it's right there in the URL.  Although "We use IIS / SQL Server / ASP.NET with VB.Net." sticks out a little more than the aspx in the URL does.</p>
<p>Anyway, I read the entire thing.  "Development in VB.Net is not a requirement, but the ability to learn it in less than a week is."  Yes, I have the ability, it's the desire to do so that I lack.</p>
<p>I found it very ironic that in the expectations they list "<i>You understand Object Oriented programming and can identify good code from bad.</i>"  So ironic in fact that I sent them an email:</p>
<p><blockquote>I meet all of the expectations listed for a Senior Software Engineer. As a matter of fact, the expectation that I feel best qualifies me is: "You understand Object Oriented programming and can identify good code from bad."  I truly excel at recognizing bad code.<br />
I am so glad you listed the platform you use and more importantly, the language that your company codes with, namely VB.Net.  Why does it matter?  Because anything written in VB.Net is bad code, therefore I refuse to apply.<br /><br />
Good day,<br />

<p>It says that they will retain my records.  Do they really keep any and all emails sent to that address?  Seems unlikely with the rise of the worms...</p>
<p>And by sending the message, what does this say about me?</p></p>

VB.NET is actually not that bad. Head and shoulders above VB6 as a matter of fact. It is a shame that when people complain that Perl is a read only language that we JAPH's are quick to respond "Not so" yet do the same to another language.

<h2>You're right</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Mr. Muskrat/">Mr. Muskrat</a> on 2004-02-07T19:11:17</h3>
<p>You are so right.  That does sound very arrogant on my part.  I know that they will simply read it and move on to the next message but I regret sending it now.</p>
<p>I learned and used VB4.  It was bad.  Real bad.  I've also seen the changes up to VB6.  I admit that I have not seen VB.NET yet but I don't plan on it either.  Anything that requires a twenty-something megabyte download in order to run a small executable cannot be good.</p>
<p>Microsoft has left a bad taste in my mouth with the totally unbearable "operating systems" Windows 3.x, NT, 95, 98 and ME.  And don't get me started on their other products...</p>
<p>At home, I currently dual boot between Windows 2000 (it's less painful to use than it's predecessors) and Slackware linux.  I'm trying to position myself to make a clean break from Microsoft altogether.  This gets easier and easier with each new version of linux.</p>
<p>So am I still arrogant or simply biased?</p>

I may also have been a little harsh.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)



<h2>right? wrong? prace your bets now!</h2>

Ehh, VB4 isn't that bad.  Just don't try to do any programming in it, use it for what it's good at, which is quickly making a front-end for a program written in a *real* language.  It plays quite nicely with DLLs written in C.

<h2>Not arrogant at all!</h2>

<p>
You are just the average Perl snob, which is what I am trying to become. I program in VB6 on occassion and it isn't terrible but it isn't Perl, for sure.</p>
<p>
Not to start any boring M$-knocking, but what irritates me about them is their 'we know better than you what you want' attitude. And they learn so damn slowly.</p>
