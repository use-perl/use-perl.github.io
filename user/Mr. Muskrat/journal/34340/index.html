<p><p>I recently bought a Wii.  The kids have been begging for one since they came out.  I've wanted one since they came too.  My wife sort of wanted one but not as much as me and the kids.</p>
<p>We picked up Wii Play (it's only $10 more than a remote and comes with one), Super Paper Mario and Metroid Prime 3: Corruption as well as an extra nunchuk.</p>
<p>Wii Sports is fun for the entire family.  It looks like Bowling is the #1 pick though (and the kids can beat me at it).</p>
<p>Wii Play is a mixed bag.  There are games that some of us like that the others don't.  I'm not sure why but I really like Cow Racing.</p>
<p>Super Paper Mario is another one that the entire family enjoys. The controls are mostly the same as previous Mario games (if you swap 1 for A and 2 for B).  I really like the mix of 2D and 3D environments. I never played Paper Mario but the downside of SPM for me is the amount of talking that goes on in the game. (It's reminiscent of the FF or Zelda games.)</p></p>
