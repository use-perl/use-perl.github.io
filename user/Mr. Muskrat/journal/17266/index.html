<div class="span8">
<p>I have had a headache since Thursday morning.  It gradually increased in intensity until it was a migraine complete with light and sound sensitivity and the other bad effects of a migraine.  It finally started decreasing in intensity until around 2 am Friday when I was able to get to sleep.  I woke up before 8, notified work that I would be out sick and tried to get more rest.  I slept most of the day yesterday.  This morning I woke up to find that I've still got this blasted headache.</p>

Go to the doctor!

missed a dose of caffiene?

<p>Not a chance!  On Thursday, I had several cups of coffee.</p>
<p>Um, okay, yeah, I did not have any caffeine yesterday.  I felt so bad that all I ate was chicken soup and drank only Sprite.</p>
<p>The headache medicine only eased the pain.  So I'm drinking my second cup of coffee right now.</p>

I stopped drinking coffee (my only source of caffeine) New Year's day. I got up at 6am and went back to bed at 9am... slept till 5pm... got up, watched a bit of TV and fell asleep on the couch at 8pm... slept till 7 the next morning.<br> <br>I got a massive headache the 2nd and it stayed with me for eleven days. I was taking 800 mg ibuprophen every 6 hours...<br> <br>Then... I was better. Started dreaming at night again and everything.<br> <br>But, I couldn't code for crap. So, I started back... but I'm only at a "maintenance" dose for programming... and tapering a bit every week.<br> <br>It is a real pain if you are addicted and miss a dose. Sure am glad it isn't something stronger...

Whew!  The caffeine in conjunction with the headache medicine did the trick... finally!
