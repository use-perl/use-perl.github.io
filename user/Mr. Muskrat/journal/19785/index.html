<p><p><a href="http://use.perl.org/user/TeeJay">TeeJay</a> released a new version of <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/teejay/SpringGraph-0.02/lib/SpringGraph.pm">SpringGraph</a> about four days ago.  I saw the example scripts and the output from them and I thought "that's pretty cool."</p>
<p>I had the idea to show file links graphically so I installed GD and SpringGraph at work on my Windows XP box running AS Perl 5.8.3.  I proceeded to try out the example scripts and well, one out of three scripts worked (OO worked but procedural and records did not).  I fired off an email to him about it.</p>
<p>When I got home, I installed GD and SpringGraph on my Windows XP box running AS Perl 5.8.4.  I once again tried out the example scripts and this time two of the three worked (oo and procedural worked but records did not).  Once again I sent <a href="~TeeJay">TeeJay</a> an email about it.</p>
<p>I started to look into why it was failing and spent about a half an hour before I decided that it really wasn't worth it.  I didn't need records for my project.</p>
<p>I started coding and in under 30 minutes I had a suitable proof of concept script.  I didn't have to think about how to graph it.  With <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/teejay/SpringGraph-0.02/lib/SpringGraph.pm">SpringGraph</a>, you just add nodes and then later add edges.  Very nice.  You have done a really good job <a href="~TeeJay">TeeJay</a> and I am looking forward to future versions.</p>
<p>Here's the script if you are curious:<br />
<pre>#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;
use Cwd;
use File::Find;
use SpringGraph;

my $graph = new SpringGraph;
my $filename = 'oo_file_find.png';

find(\&process_files, cwd); # do your magic

print "outputting as png.\n";

$graph->as_png($filename);

print "finished.\n";

sub process_files {
  my $file = $_;

  return unless -f $file;
  return unless $file =~ /\.(?:p[l|m]|cgi)$/i;

  $graph->add_node($file, label => $file);

  open(FILE, '<', $file) or print "couldn't open $file\n" && return;

  while (<FILE>) {
    next if /^#/;
    if (/\buse\s/) {
      # I didn't use a next because I may want to find other files
      # in form action links, for example.  Capture the module
      # information and strip everything after the first whitespace
      my ($match) = /\buse\s+(.*);/; 
      $match = (split /\s/, $match)[0];

      $graph->add_edge($file => $match);
    }
  }

  close FILE;
}

</pre><br />
Here's a link to one of the better results files that was produced as a PNG.   <a href="http://www.muskratgroup.com/images/oo_file_find.png"> oo_file_find.png</a> </p>

<h2>you might like the pre_release at the website</h2>

Thanks for the feedback, its always nice to get the first mail about something you have been working on and released.
<p>
Yes, it still requires some work : 0.02 means not done yet, although I have other modules on CPAN that are only 0.01 or 0.02 that are fairly solid ( or at least don't break or fail often).
</p><p>
Anyway I have a pre-release of version 0.03 at the <a href="http://droogs.org/digraph/" title="droogs.org">digraph</a droogs.org> bit of my site if you want it.
</p><p>
I plan to spend a few days working out some stuff using paper and pencil (and rubber) before attacking all the geometry again.
