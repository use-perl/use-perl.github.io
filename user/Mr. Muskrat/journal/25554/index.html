<p><p>About a week ago my supervisor told me that there is some interest in a Perl class among some of the Tier 3 resources (people who fix the code defects).  She asked if I would be interested in teaching it.  Of course, I said yes.</p>
<p>This week I had a meeting with my supervisor and one of the Tier 3 leads.  It was decided that the class would be taught in four 3 hour sessions and that part of each session would be set aside for programming exercises.  I recommended "Learning Perl" as the text.</p>
<p>I wrote up an outline right after the meeting that has me teaching the entire text.  I have started writing my teaching plan as a series of (extended) lightning talks so that hopefully, I will have enough time left for questions and programming exercises.</p>
<p>I am not so sure that I can adequitely teach the class in the time allotted and still have the time needed for the exercises.  I know that I can trim each chapter down but I am not sure which chapters should get the most emphasis.  I am also not sure how many exercises to use for each chapter given that these are programmers and not total noobs.</p>
<p>Does anyone have any suggestions?</p>

Class::Learning::Perl - A class to teach Perl that uses ``Learning Perl'' as the foundation.</p>
<p><b>Description</b><br />
Given that we will be limited to four 3 hour blocks of instruction, I have broken down the book into managable pieces.  The class will cover the cornerstones of Perl knowledge while touching on some of the more advanced topics.</p>

<h2>Side-by-side examples</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/davebaker/">davebaker</a> on 2005-07-07T01:36:03</h3>
If these people know another language already, I'll bet they'd soak up the Perl best if you showed them side-by-side examples (how you'd do something like read a line of data in Perl and how you'd do it in the language they already know, for example).
<p>There is nothing like teaching to make you really learn something<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) I had to teach an Introduction to HTML last fall and ended up learning how to do useful CSS for the first time, while I taught it.</p>

<h2>A question</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/eyidearie/">eyidearie</a> on 2005-07-07T14:50:26</h3>
Hi, I found your post about 'teaching perl" and I was hoping you could help me: I'm learning perl right now and I'm supposed to do my project at the same time.
I need to access the data in a particular column of a particular sheet of an excel file;
I also need to do a search for close matches in two lists of names (i used grep but that does exact matches) and I don't know how to do that.
If you would please reply I'd really appreciate it. Thank you.

Check out <a href="http://www.perlmonks.org/" title="perlmonks.org">PerlMonks</a perlmonks.org>.  This is a common question and so you should be able to quickly find a solution there that you can understand.

The "use Perl;" site isn't the best place to get this kind of question answered; the journal system is used more for blog-type posts by individual users.
<p>The FAQ for this site sorta tells you that but doesn't have a link to places where you can get answers to your kind of question.
</p> <blockquote> <div>
What's this site for?
<p>Thanks for asking. This site is intended (for now) to be a site where the Perl user community can get information about and discuss the latest news and issues related to Perl. This site is not (for now<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) intended to be a help desk. General "how do I do $x?" questions can be answered in many other places online, including the many Perl mailing lists and news groups.</p>
</div> </blockquote>
Please help us improve "use Perl;" by replying to this post and telling me what site or sites you've tried already in order to find a place to get an answer to your question.
<p>Here's a good one, for example (though I'm curious to know if and how you found it already): <a href="http://faq.perl.org/" title="perl.org">http://faq.perl.org/</a perl.org>
</p> <p>I'm not sure there's any way for me to contact you by email through "use Perl;" -- I don't think so, because your email address is set to be not shown publicly -- but feel free to email me directly at my email address (click on my name, elsewhere on this page) if you'd prefer.
</p> <p>Perl is a great language with a great community of users. Welcome!</p>

<h2>Teaching Learning Perl</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/brian_d_foy/">brian_d_foy</a> on 2005-07-07T19:28:37</h3>
Aside from getting the authors of Learning Perl to teach the class (we wrote the book and slides based on what we actually teach), here's the best advice for you:<br> <br> <ul> <li>You can cover each chapter in about an hour<br> </li> <li>Give the students about 45 minutes for each section of exercises (less for the first chapter<br>and a couple near the end)<br> </li> <li>I don't think you'll be able to do lectures and exercises in 12 hours. We teach that in 30 hours, and we have precise timing for everything and a lot of experience to make it come out. At YAPC::NA I got through most of Learning Perl in 8 hours by talking at light speed.<br> </li> <li>You can cheat by having them do the exercises outside of class. This doesn't work for the first<br>half of the book, but is fine for the second half.<br> </li> <li>You can skip some of the stuff at the end to cut down on the time.<br> </li> </ul>

<h2>Re:Teaching Learning Perl</h2>

<p>Everyone in the class already knows how to program in Java, C++, or some other language.  Many have a very basic understanding of Perl already (data types, operators and some of the functions for example).  I would have been much more comfortable with extra time but at least I'm not stuck with five one hour classes.  It's definitely going to be a crash course though.</p>
<p>I have a few options:</p> <ol>
<li>Request extra classes</li>
<li>Cut out the exercises</li>
<li>Cut back on the topics</li>
<li>Cut back on the subject matter even further</li>
</ol>
I would love to add a few more 3 hours classes if I could (and I will request it) but it's probably not an option.  If I cut out the exercises, I won't be able to judge how well they are understanding (but I'm not planning on having them do all of them in class either).  I could cut back on the topics; Chapter 14: Process Management, Chapter 16: Simple Databases, Chapter 17: Some Advanced Perl Techniques and Appendix B: Beyond the Llama are all prime candidates (which is probably the plan if the extra classes are refused).  I really don't see how I could trim the existing information back any further since the current plan is to breeze through it.
