<p><p>This past Tuesday was our holiday season Perl Mongers meeting.  John Sharpe gave a talk on XML & Perl.  I know that I was not the only one who learned something from it.  He mentioned that it would be available for download soon.</p>
<p>At the conclusion of the talk, Colin Jitlal pulled out four book that O'Reilly had provided.  John asked questions about the information covered by his talk.  The first person with the correct answer to a question received a book.  I was fortunate enough to receive the very last book to be given away, "Perl Cookbook 2nd Edition".  Thank you O'Reilly!</p>
<p>We adjourned to The Londoner for our social gathering.  We had very slow service which is unusual for The Londoner even with it as crowded as it was.  As it turns out, they only had two waitresses that night.  I had the bangers & mash which was superb.</p>
<p>The conversation at the socials is always interesting and varied.  You can never tell what topic will come up!  At my end of the table, the discussion covered employment, employers, Perl, CGI, Apache, ???.  (I knew that I should have typed this up following the social.)</p>
<p>And before I forget...  Sometime during the evening, Colin announced that I am taking over as VP of the group.</p></p>
