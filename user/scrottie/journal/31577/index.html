<h1>Story of a package traveling by UPS, Three-Day-Select</h1>

<p>http://isnoop.net/tracking/?t=1Z5R413V3947361007<br/><br/>6:31pm, the package is handed to UPS.  Half an hour later, it leaves the city on a truck.  Over the course of the next four hours, the package visits four other cities in Florida, getting scanned each time.  From Miami, it spends 14 hours traveling to Loiusville, Kentucky, where it stays for two hours before leaving for Phoenix.  It takes under 26 hours to get there.  It either went by a very fast truck or a very slow plane.  Upon entering Phoenix, it sits in a warehouse for 24 hours, and then is sent off to Tempe. 24 hours later, it hasn't completed the drive that normally takes 30 minutes.  We're rapidly approaching the point where the package has spent more time in Phoenix, in the city of its final destination, than it did in transit to Phoenix.  It started off moving so fast, too -- the Floridans got it out of their state in about five hours and it's been in Phoenix for two days.  I think someone took it home with them for the night.<br/><br/>What is it?  Hopefully the correct replacement LCD for my laptop.  I'm leaving for a conference Tuesday and would really like to have this.  If I'd known three day select would take six days, I'd have paid the next-day-air price (which is about what it would cost to fly a human the same route).  Bleah.<br/><br/>-scott<br/><br/></p>

<h2>Speculation on the oddities</h2>

<p>Might that have been a train?</p>

<blockquote> <div><p>We&#8217;re rapidly approaching the point where the package has spent more time [&#8230;] in the city of its final destination, than it did in transit</p></div> </blockquote>

<p>That&#8217;s not really surprising, though. Going from hub to hub is always very fast, whereas leaving the inter-hub backbones is much, much slower. &#8220;Last mile&#8221; and all that. Same is true when travelling by plane within Europe, f.ex. &#8211; getting to the airport and then from the destination airport to the final destination takes at least as long as the flight itself does.</p>

<p>I can see how it&#8217;s still annoying in your case though&#8230;</p>
