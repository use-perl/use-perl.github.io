<p>Pain seems to be the recent theme in my life.<br/><br/>Got a nasty sunburn on the way to Vegas on the motorcycle.  Google Maps said 5 hours, and I do 2 hour rides somewhat frequently (across Phoenix and back).  My hands are a bit swollen and puffy on the top and blisters are filling with puss.  Uh, uh oh.<br/><br/>About a week ago, I got some strange flu that gave me nasty muscle aches and a headache, which is odd.<br/><br/>Bit over a week ago, I had two wisdom teeth pulled.  They were kind of rotting and falling apart.  I really liked having them.  I brushed them and sometimes flossed them and they were great for crushing things like hard candies and nuts.  Before they were pulled, I started having toothaches and then after they were pulled, I got off the Vikadan as quickly as I could so I could get back to work (it was making me all fuzzy headed).<br/><br/>A while before that, I got hit by an old lady in a Buick.<br/><br/>But I'm very happy my poor old 1993 Honda Nighthawk 750 made it all the way to Vegas and back from Phoenix without problem.<br/><br/>-scott</p>
