<div class="span8">
<p>As my old Sony Vaio has been on life support
for some time now, barely limping along with
a burnt out CPU fan, burnt out charging logic in
the unit (requiring the base station), a burnt
out touch pad (yes, I checked the ribbon cable),
and a keyboard with litteraly holes worn through
some of the keys, I got a new machine.
Installing to the new machine would prove to be
an adventure and the adventure continues.
In this article: how NetBSD, FreeBSD, and Linux
fair; Slackware install issues and how to work
around them with Zipslack.
<br><br>
First a few words on how I got where I am and
where (or what) I got.
I was considering the Fujitsu P-1120 as its
small and light and has excellent battery life -
at 2.5 pounds with the extra life battery, it'll
run Windows for 9 hours and Linux for significantly longer. It's also keyboard-shaped -
the screen and the whole unit is the long and
rectangular. Opening the unit reveals pure screen
and keyboard - exactly as it should be.
Most importantly, this machine is fanless.
In my previous five or so laptops, one died a 
thermal death and two wore out their CPU fans,
so I was eager to eliminate this mode of failure.
Another problem was the laptop keyboards -
apparently they weren't designed to actually be
used. 
I saw someone with an old Toshiba Toughbook -
one of the ultra-light but only semi-rugged
varieties - at DEFCON and I fell in love.
It was a little more square, tiny, adoreable,
shiney, sexy, and if it's name was to be 
believed, <i>tough</i>. 
Conflicting reports online report the keyboard
being semi-water resistant.
And I hate if a laptop keyboard gets gummed up
and you try to take a few keys off to get the 
built up hair, dust bunny-mass, etc out, you
can't get the back on because the tiny,
ultra-fragile little plastic dealies break like
some kind of disposable seal.
So I wanted a better keyboard.
<br><br>
I got the Toughbook CF-R1 from 
<a href="http://www.expansys.com">Expansys</a>.
Expansys is like the state-side CDW or any of
these big places that deal primarily with 
companies, but they're big in England apparently
but have a satellite office in the United States
(where I'm presently located).
This is a model that's a few years older,
which I figured was all the better as far as
*nix support goes.
It has an 800mhz PIII (ultra low voltage -
this chip would go on to become the Pentium M),
128 megs of RAM (kind of weak), and a 20 gig
HD (also kind of weak), but considering the
size of my bone pile and how often I have to
go back to a 486 and how long I have to stay
with a 486 due the frequent hardware failures
of crappy machines, if this thing <i>is</i>
tough, I don't care about the specs behind
slightly behind the curve.
Newer Toughbooks of course have better specs.
By the way, I've seen reports of the W2 in
coming with between a 713 and 900mhz CPU.
Even without a fan and with an "ultra low
voltage Pentium III", the thing beats the
pants off the 650mhz Celeron in my Vaio
(which also has 128 megs) by a
factor of two using a few tests such as
compiling things - the Celeron gets real
hot real fast then it gets real throttled and
it gets real slow. I'm sold. Give me the
low voltage CPU any day and keep your f'n
fan. I hereby declare laptops with fans to
be stupid.
<br><br>
So how rugged is it?
Well, I can take the key caps off and put them
back on, but nothing about the keyboard seems
water resistant or dust resistant to me, so
it's certainly <i>less</i> crappy than other
laptop keyboards, but I'm unconvinienced.
Ports have little rubber seals around them and 
there aren't big gaping water (or cola, or
kool aid) holes all over to rapidly conduct
conductive fluid to the conductive circuits.
This is a big plus. 
I can cringe about 100,000 fewer times in my
life as big fat confused looking stragers
fumble by wielding massive sugared beverages
(and when friends stagger by looking confused with intoxicating
beverages).
Supposedly the HD is shock mounted, but I can't
get the case open.
Also supposedly it has a magnesium alloy case
but as it turns out, the back of the LCD is
most certainly plastic. And experimentally
applying even gentle pressure to the back of it
makes colors fly in the edges of the LCD itself
indicating that the LCD isn't well protected from
the pressure at all.
The base of the unit easily bows and twists
and the magnesium alloy is extremely thin.
I'm starting to feel unimpressed and a little
but abused about the whole "tough" thing.
Panasonic makes a line of fully rugged notebooks
which are universally regarded as nearly
industructable - people run over them with
Jeeps, lose them off the back of motorcycles,
and sorts of things, use them in the pouring
rain, 
and they just don't stop.
But these weigh a <i>lot</i>.
<br><br>
So time for our next test: compatiability.
I really want to run NetBSD on this thing
because I'm used to it and I've been accumulating
obscure software for almost a decade now and I
don't want to have to recompile all of it -
it'll take me another decade to do so ;)
Well, NetBSD installs and runs fine, and APM
actually fucking works.
It's fucking amazing. 
The last time I saw APM work on a notebook was
on a 486.
NetBSD finds the USB, HD controller, keyboard,
touchpad, sound card, and ethernet controller
with no problems and all work. The cardbus 
controller however does <i>not</i> configure
under NetBSD, but NetBSD lacks true ACPI support,
even in NetBSD 2.0, so this was expected.
A quick test and I'm online through my cell
phone, GPRS, and the required USB cord - yay!
startx fails. So I configure it. It still fails.
I search online and steal a known working
and plausible configuration. It fails. I tweak
things. The best I can do is get the machine to
stop responding as X goes into an endless loop
trying to reset the Lynx3DM video chip.
Googling for the error message, it turns out
that Lynx support under NetBSD and OpenBSD
has been broken for about 5 years now. Well, crud.
I won't hold my breath then. I use the pre-break
version of X, which is a pain to configure
(but nothing I haven't done before), and it
has the same problem. Crud! Both XFree86 and
X.Org have the same problem and the same
neglected bug report.
I quickly figured out the machine wasn't
really locking up, just failing to respond
to keyboard input, so I'd run a <tt>sleep 60;reboot</tt> in another virtual console
every time I tried to start X with a new
configuration.
<br><br>
FreeBSD goes next, as it's still mostly what
I'm used to.
It installs, finds everything including the
cardbus controller, but USB is hosed and I
can't connect with the cell phone.
This is after loading all of the right
kernel modules.
After <tt>chat</tt>gets the cell phone "dialed",
<tt>pppd</tt> just sits there.
Forever. If I try to kill it and run it again,
<tt>chat</tt> sees all of the data the modem
tried to send but <tt>pppd</tt> didn't get last
time. Futzing with <tt>clocal</tt> and company
doesn't help. Didn't try X - I need some 
comfort of success at this point so I'm trying
Linux.
<br><br>
Slackware - X works. Thank god. At least I can
use this thing for <i>something</i> even if I'm
confined to the LAN. And it recognizes the
cardbus controller. That's good. Maybe a
Sierra wireless card will work.
Anyway, I should go back try and FreeBSD again
since Linux also won't talk to this phone
either, having the same problems as FreeBSD.
I have no great love of this Motorola v66 phone.
However, installing Slackware was... interesting.
*BSD's floppy boots recognize the USB floppy
drive correctly and once they read in all of
their disks, they're happy to install from CD,
ftp, the web, NFS, a DOS partition, and any
number of other things. Slackware has fewer
install options and the floppies didn't understand
the USB drive. Searching around, this is a common
problem that most Linux distros suffer from.
So I turned my swap partition into an MS-DOS
filesystem and took a whack at Zipslack.
Zipslack's install insructions were short
and sweet: according to it, all I had to do
was unzip the <tt>zipslack.zip</tt> file
onto the MS-DOS paritiotion (off of the root)
and then it would boot and could run Linux.
Not so. 
The documentation entirely forgot to mention
that DOS is required (it mentioned that Windows
95/98/etc should boot into DOS mode instead of
Windows mode). 
There was a boot floppy, so I used that 
experimentally.
When it came up, it found <tt>init</tt> and ran it,
but it failed to find <tt>agetty</tt>.
Crud. How come nothing ever seems to work
for me to any degree adequate to be useful?
Why? 
So I think, okay, maybe the unzip utility
I have for NetBSD isn't doing the filenames
right for UMSDOS and I download MS-DOS 8,
boot that, and try to look at the C: drive -
but there are no files. Turns out, not only
did NetBSD not unzip the files correctly,
it didn't even make the FAT32 partition 
correctly! I had to reformat it and use an
old PKWARE MS-DOS unzip untility before the
boot disk would actually be able to find the
files correctly, using their long file names
and the UMSDOS conventions.
Suck.
The PKZIP utility took *hours*, running without
the benefit of disk cache.
Before UNZIP'ing though, I used the <tt>SYS.EXE</tt> utility to make C: bootable
(booting into MS-DOS 8), whereupon <tt>SYSLINUX</tt> takes control and hands 
it off to Linux. This works nicely. 
But the version of MS-DOS 8 I pirated apparently
came from a Windows-95 boot disk.
Booting into Zipslack first flashes the
cloudy blue Windows 95 logo screen.
The Zipslack instructions describe how to
make a <i>real</i> Slackware system, with
an ext2 filesystem, using the Zipslack install,
and the instructions again were short and sweet.
Make a few directories, do a few <tt>cp -a</tt>
commands, run <tt>lilo</tt>, and you're done.
<br><br>
Well, <tt>lilo</tt> won't work. 
I can't get the online examples to work.
I can't get the example in its docs to work.
Yes, I <i>know</i> how Linux names the 
drives and partitions and my partitions are
correct. It gives a vague error and exits.
No where is this error defined. A quick look
around at other bootloaders saddens me - 
I couldn't find a Linux bootloader with less than
7 stagers, other than SYSLINUX, so fuck them all,
I'm booting into MS-DOS and using SYSLINUX to
boot with the ext2 partition as root.
Keep it simple, you god damn fucking morons.
By the way, there's no good reason on god's
green earth to have more than 3 stages in a
bootloader, and the only reason there should
be more than 1 stage is so that you may have
a master boot record independent of all
of the operating systems installed, boot records
for each OS installed, and then a more involved
boot routine that couldn't reasonably fit 
in the partition boot sector. Linux doesn't
seem to get this. The 2nd stage boot loader
should do <i>nothing</i> but examine the
file system, find the file containing the 3rd
stage boot loader, and run that. If logos
need to be displayed and menus presented, do it
in the 3rd stage. As it is, the 2nd stage boot
loader can't even navigate the file system,
so the whole boot process is fragile - you can't
just copy the files, copy the boot sector and
start the system. And with the 9 stage boot
loaders and the 7 stage bootloaders (I wish to
god I were making this crap up), they can't even
figure out how to leave the OS-netural master
boot record <i>alone</i> - they have to control
that stage as well. Even though LILO claims it
doesn't have to - it refuses to work with this
vague error unless I let it have the master boot
record. This isn't a graceful approach - it's
nihilism - "all 9 stages or NO stages for you!".
<br><br>
But Zipslack morphed into Slackware very nicely.
Slackware's package system is nice for the
right reasons - it isn't fascist. It doesn't
force you to uninstall all of your packages
before installing any new package. It lets
old libs and binaries lie around, just like
Unix has always gracefully handled. 
It doesn't attempt so much control as to be
error prone and fragile.
In the event of an error, it'll be of the sort
that's easily corrected by hand.
But Slackware doesn't seem to want to mount
a ffs (fast file system) partition, and all of
my <tt>/home</tt> data is on a ffs paritition,
meant to be shared between whatever OSes wind
up cohabitating on this little bastard.
So I guess I'll try FreeBSD again and if X
doesn't work there, I'll have to move all of my
<tt>/home</tt> data off, turn the filesystem
into an ext2 filesystem, <tt>rsync</tt> the
data back on, and reinstall Zipslack and then
hop over to Slackware - and for however long
this "tough" book lasts, suffer mild confusion
in those rare cases where I have to reboot and
am presented with the Windows 95 logo screen.

<h2>A few more oddities on the Panasonic...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/scrottie/">scrottie</a> on 2004-12-04T23:19:12</h3>
I tried to run the working Linux X.Org X
server in NetBSD under Linux emulation, and
with a symlink between<nobr> <wbr></nobr><tt>/dev/console</tt>
and<nobr> <wbr></nobr><tt>/dev/tty5</tt>, it got as far as the
<tt>mmap</tt> of video memory before it failed
with a mysterious signal 11. Dang!
Almost worked!
Also, the keys on the Panasonic Toughbook are
awkwardly small.
I own an old Compaq Aero 4/25 which is an
antique 486SX25 that's smaller than almost
every other laptop I've seen. It's a little
deeper, but it's just barely larger than a
handbook format book, and it has tiny little
keys. Well, the Toughbook is worse. I'm
cocky about being able to type well on undersized
keyboards, but this one is clearly meant for
Japanese fingers. I fat-finger everything.
By the way, I'm not typing on it now.
This will take some serious adjustment - and
I'm afraid that I'll continue to avoid using it.
The Fujitsu P1120 has a normal sized laptop
keyboard, with keys 0.7 times those of a
standard keyboard; this thing is closer to 0.5.

<h2>SMI_GEReset flood on FreeBSD, still</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/scrottie/">scrottie</a> on 2004-12-05T03:32:28</h3>
Nope. *sigh* FreeBSD has the same problem
as NetBSD and OpenBSD - the Xorg.0.log in<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/var/tmp is just a flood of SMI_GEReset messages
after the point where it should have started
up.
<br> <br>
NetBSD's lfs, the log structured file system,
is 100% unusable, reliably crashing a machine
daily, yet it's been listed as supported
and available without any warnings for years
and years.
And there's a flood of bug reports, all of which
get killed as duplicates.
This is just another case where Free Software
turns a blind eye to a flood of bug reports
and instead of shitting or getting off the
pot (fixing it or disabling the feature), they
just leave it out there to fuck up poor suckers.
In this case, the poor sucked popped $1000 for
a laptop - and that's a hell of a lot of money
for someone who is always behind on his
college loans and works 14 hours a day trying
to keep his head above water.
If it would spite you, I'd install and run XP,
but I know you fuckwads don't care that Linux+BSD
only have about 1% share. And you're all liars
anyway. You all say you run Linux but you don't.
You sit on IRC channels, or shake my hand in
real life, boast you run Linux, then you
email me by way of an IP that only hours early
registered hits from an XP box.
If you toed the same line you preached this
crap wouldn't go ignored for 5 years at a time.

<h2>Knoppix to HD</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/scrottie/">scrottie</a> on 2004-12-05T21:17:03</h3>
I've used Knoppix before when I was otherwise doomed to borrow someones Wintel box as all my of my VGA-signal-producing or displaying hardware was down for the count. It's not as cozy as my little NetBSD install but I've come to get pretty good at getting my work done using it. While running NetBSD I'd steal large numbers of libs and binaries from it as it presents a whole running systems worth in an easy accessible location - not futzing with dependencies and brain dead package systems further aggrivated by running on a non-native system. And I've you've been following this discussion, you know I don't have a CD-ROM drive for this thing - sorry, ran out of money.
<br> <br>
KNOPPIX will install itself to a HD - this isn't what I'm talking about because I couldn't boot KNOPPIX in the first place to do the install! Instead, I had to install KNOPPIX from outside of KNOPPIX. When KNOPPIX installs itself, it extracts the contents of its compressed file system to an ext2 filesystem. I just copied the compressed filesystem image itself over, leaving it read-only.
<br> <br>
I found <a href="http://linuxdevices.com/articles/AT8275095591.html" title="linuxdevices.com">this page on installing Knoppix to a flash harddrive</a linuxdevices.com> and said "close enough!". The instructions are good. However, I still had some trouble, which is why I'm posting. Hopefully this will further clarify. This should apply equally to any KNOPPIX-derived live boot CD (such as the one the above link is to).<br/><br/>Here are the five essential ingrediants to a Knoppix install: LILO (or some other bootloader), <tt>boot.img</tt>, the kernel, <tt>miniroot</tt>, and the huge <tt>KNOPPIX</tt> file.
In different (later) versions of KNOPPIX, the
exactly arrangement of these parts (which contains  which others) varies but the parts always exist.
I think. Later KNOPPIXes changed the early boot
procedure and dropped <tt>boot.img</tt> I think.
<br> <br><br/><br/><tt>boot.img</tt> contains the data from a 1.44 meg 3.5" floppy disk. This can be written to disk and used as a startup disk for systems that don't know how to boot from CD. More commonly, though, this <i>is</i> the CD boot file. The El Torito bootable CD specifications requires the CD to pick a 1.44 meg file of the same format as a floppy disk and use that to boot from (strictly speaking, it doesn't have to be 1.44 meg, but other sizes aren't handled well by various venders). On Knoppix 3.2, this contains SYSLINUX, the bootloader (in place of LILO) and the kernel. The floppy is of the UMSDOS format (MS-DOS extended with Unix permissions and long file names), and SYSLINUX is the DOS-mode Linux boot loader. This boot image also contains <tt>miniroot.gz</tt>, the next stage. When SYSLINUX boots the Linux kernel, <tt>vmlinuz</tt>, it passes it several parameters one of which is <tt>initrd=/boot/miniroot.gz</tt>
or something close. This specifies that <tt>miniroot.gz</tt> should be used as an initial ram disk to run from. KNOPPIX 3.2 has this in the <tt>boot.img</tt> as part of the boot image; later versions of KNOPPIX can't fit <tt>vmlinuz</tt> and <tt>miniroot.gz</tt> both in 1.44 megs so <tt>miniroot.tgz</tt> is moved off the boot image.<br/><br/><tt>miniroot.gz</tt> is a compressed ext2 filesystem. If this file is part of the boot floppy, it may be extracted from the boot floppy, uncompressed, and mounted with loopback like <tt>gunzip miniroot.gz;mount -o loop miniroot<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/mnt/miniroot</tt> because we're throwing away the boot floppy in this process and installing LILO.
<br> <br>
When the system is finally loaded, this ram disk initialized by <tt>miniroot</tt> is still in place and it specifies the basic directory structure (all of those symlinks you see when you <tt>ls -l<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/</tt>). It contains a <tt>linuxrc</tt> file, a <tt>static/</tt> directory containing very few executables, and a <tt>modules/</tt> directory containing <tt>cloop.o</tt> and several SCSI card drivers. <tt>linuxrc</tt> is a shell script. It parses and handles most of the boot-time command arguments you give KNOPPIX. It tries to load to various SCSI modules and mounts various CD ROM devices looking for the <tt>KNOPPIX/KNOPPIX</tt> file which is the next and final stage in the boot process. When it finds <tt>KNOPPIX/KNOPPIX</tt>, it loads the <tt>cloop.o</tt> module and mounts <tt>KNOPPIX/KNOPPIX</tt> loop-back using it. <tt>KNOPPIX/KNOPPIX</tt> is a <i>compressed</i> filesystem image, and <tt>cloop</tt> is a special version of the loop filesytem layer that uncompresses on the fly. <tt>linuxrc</tt> hides errors and gags most output in general and my boot was failing, so this was my successful point of attack: I rewrote the file so it did little more than a few <tt>mount || echo "failed"</tt> operations:<blockquote><div> <tt>mount -t ext2 -o ro<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/dev/hda1<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/cdrom || echo "sdw - uh oh, mount of<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/dev/hda1<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/cdrom failed"<br> <br>if test -f<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/cdrom/KNOPPIX/KNOPPIX; then<br>echo "sdw - looks like we found it so we're trying to cloop it"<br>fi<br> <br>insmod -f<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/modules/cloop.o file=/cdrom/KNOPPIX/KNOPPIX<br>mount -t iso9660 -o ro<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/dev/cloop<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/KNOPPIX || FOUND_KNOPPIX=""</tt> </div></blockquote>There is more to my <tt>linuxrc</tt> than this but  this is the interesting bit. All of the failure cases were removed as were the subroutines and variables. The bit that got me was the last line in the previous listing: the version of <tt>cloop</tt> I had taken from KNOPPIX 3.2 didn't like the KNOPPIX 3.4 <tt>KNOPPIX</tt> file - it found a very large block it couldn't allocate enough memory for ("out of memory allocating...") but this error wasn't reported by the stock <tt>linuxrc</tt>.
The documentation for KNOPPIX documents a dozen different ways to tell KNOPPIX to boot from a HD using parameters such as <tt>BOOT_IMAGE fromhd fromfile</tt> and others. Looking at <tt>linuxrc</tt>, however, only <i>one</i> of these was actually implemented, so I suspect the documentation is accumulated cruft and indecision. Rather than guess which one applies, I found it easier to just hard-code it, but if you're stuck with booting from CD, you might consider just mounting <tt>boot.img</tt> and <tt>miniroot.gz</tt> under loopback and inspecting the file to learn which one it really is for your version of KNOPPIX.<br/><br/><br> <br>
<tt>KNOPPIX/KNOPPIX</tt> is a ISO9660 file system where individual files are individually compressed according to an optional ISO standard that <tt>mkisofs</tt> knows to create. As I write this, there is no other way to read this image than with <tt>cloop</tt>, but fear not, <a href="http://www2.goldfisch.at/knowledge/311" title="goldfisch.at">the source to this module may be downloaded and compiled, and some kind soul has explained how</a goldfisch.at>. You shouldn't need to do this if you're just copying the <tt>KNOPPIX</tt> file over to your HD.
<br> <br>
Back to <tt>LILO</tt>. With a customized <tt>linuxrc</tt>, you need almost none of the <tt>extra=</tt> parameters. There, that was easy!
<br> <br>
You'll want to use the instructions I linked to initially as your primary instructions for actually doing the KNOPPIX HD install - I haven't given the actual commands or specified what gets copied where or explained how to configure LILO.
This was just some background on what the parts are, how to really get at them, and how they interact.
Good luck!<br> <br>

Changes for KNOPPIX 3.6: ISOLINUX is used instead of SYSLINUX. Apparently the <tt>isolinux.bin</tt> file, which was created with the configuration in <tt>isolinux.cfg</tt>, understands how to talk to the BIOS and get data from the CD-ROM in order to fetch the kernel and it's root disk. Per the <tt>isolinux.cfg</tt>, there are two kernels: <tt>linux24</tt> and <tt>linux26</tt> which use <tt>minirt24.gz</tt> and <tt>minirt26.gz</tt> respectively. These files are no longer bundled up inside of a <tt>boot.img</tt> file but are on the main CD filesystem in the <tt>boot/isolinux</tt> directory.

Ahhh, a little more on the KNOPPIX system. There's a cloop module that a compressed filesystem can be mounted through (it's a filesystem layer, not a filesystem, apparently). But only one cloop device can be mounted at a time. <a href="http://www.lugatgt.org/articles/smallfootprint/" title="lugatgt.org">http://www.lugatgt.org/articles/smallfootprint/</a lugatgt.org> explains how to uncompress (and compress) this filesystem: the magic is in the <tt>extract_compressed_fs</tt> and create_compressed_fs commands.

Based on the <tt>extract_compressed_fs</tt> and <tt>create_compressed_fs</tt> utilities, <a href="http://www.linuxmafia.com/user/rick/linux-info/bbc-modification" title="linuxmafia.com">here's a script to modify the KNOPPIX-based LNX-BBC image</a linuxmafia.com>. It uncompresses the compressed filesystem, mounts it lookback, copies in whatever, and then recompresses it.
