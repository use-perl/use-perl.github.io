<p>I'm surrounded by people who seek the total annihilation of an opposing party. Sitting in a North Scottsdale Starbucks, I hear "commie" remarks daily. They're actually taking a break from "torrorists" and "America haters". Half the country hates the country? Half the country are secretly communists? Bullshit. But the message is clear: they seek the obliteration of the Democratic party. The Democratic party should go the way of the American Communist Party under Hoover. And what will this get us? Unity? Strength? Other countries with one dominating ruling party might have exhibited strength for a time but it was hardly worth it - Mao's China, Stallin's Russia, and so on, and so forth. All parties - Communist, Socialist, Labor, Republican - abuse power when competition from another party is lacking. Solviet Russia had free, fair elections. Another party could have been elected. But the Solviet government pumped the country full of pro-Communist propoganda and belitted and berated every other party, equating anything non-Solviet with non-Russian. Hmm - sound familiar? "You're either with us or you're against us". "Support our troops and our president".
<br><br>
Anti-Democratic sentiments circuled through popular media are nothing but a pre-emptive counter to legimate complaints about corruption and mispriorities of our current administration. And few if any Democrats seek the annihilation of the Republican party - they just want information dissiminated, complaints heard, and corruption checked.
Any Republican is advised to hear the complaints against the abuses of power of their own party. This doesn't mean their party must abolished - only that, unchecked, severe harm will befall us all, thus these abuses need be delt with. And their own party isn't going to advertise them.
<br><br>
Me? I'm not a Republican or Democrat. I don't object to the ideals of either - just the corruption of both parties. Before you brand me a Communist for suggesting we check the rampant corruption in our government that's turning off everyone from politics who won't profit heavily from a large tax break (ie, not the poor), I'd like you to know what I advocate: sustainability. Sustainability of our position as a knowledge and technology leady. Sustainable business arrangements. Sustainable domestic situation that supports families. Sustainability of natural resources. Politics that sustain relationions and civil liberties. In short, don't shortsell America or our children's future. Me for president!
