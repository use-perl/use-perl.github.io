> Thank You,      <br/><br/>I sometimes want in here about history, and highperformance computing -- things our fathers knew that we, a generation, have managed to forget -- one of those cases of re-inventing the wheel ignoring a far superior wheel that's slowly becoming lost to time.<br/><br/>I keep getting these jobs with people who need to do high volume stuff.  They hire a bunch of kids, some of them who got degrees from easy schools that don't use the wizard book or anything that might Csci "hard".  They wind up thousands of expensive Intel boxes with Linux on them, vertically partitioned databases, Apache, and mod_perl.  And, in the case of a recent client, it took over a wallclock second for this lumbering beast to service a user and nearly as much CPU time.<br/><br/>So if I bite your head off when you get all uppity about whether I do high volume, well, that's why.<br/><br/>So, employers, if you want high volume, high performance, go find people that have scientific computing experience, and watch them recoil in horror at the overly complex, bizarrely inefficient mess you made while you were trying to be clever but only managed to do things the most self-indulgently obvious way possible in the name of reinventing a better wheel.<br/><br/>-scott
