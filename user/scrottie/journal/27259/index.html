<p>Companies are getting cocky again.
That means Obnoxious Interviews.
Get consultants to call you.
Then spot-interview them. 
For fourty-six minutes. 
Don't ask if they have time.
Never mind that you don't interview consultants at all -- you get proposals from them, and you
accept if you want to.
Even though the consultant has been doing Web programming since Netscape 3.0 and has been programming since Dinosaurs roamed the server room, repeatedly insinuate he isn't qualified to perform basic tasks.
Then attack and try to get him to confess his ignorance.
For example, if he implemented strong typing for Perl and has patches in major pieces of Unix software, express your deep doubt that he is
capable of writing a query in SQL.
Repeatedly assert that you only hire the best,
but demand immediately availability, 
exclusively on-site work, 
pay poorly, and offer no perks.
Whoever is hired must have experience with 
high volume hosting because the 
little dot com business hiring you
is surely going to quickly grow to serve
billions of hits per second, and unless you've
worked on Microsoft's Hotmail team, you 
aren't ready to handle the flood of traffic 
they're inevitably going to experience.
<br><br>
Fuck it. Next interview, the rules change. 
From now on, for the sake of argument during
interview:
<br>
<ol>
<li>I don't just network, I break into fucking networks, like yours.
<li>I don't just know how to set up mail lists, I send UBE from your network.
<li>Not only do I write scalable code but you're already running my code, you twit.
</ol>
<br>
Fuck you morons. 
I was sick of you before the dot com blew out.
It's just passe now.
