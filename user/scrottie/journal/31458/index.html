<p></i>"It's only been two days since the announcement of the official release of Ubuntu 6.10 (Edgy Eft), and the fallout has been very interesting to watch. By and large, fresh installs of Edgy tend to go well. Many people report improved performance over Dapper, improved stability, better device support, etc. A good showing. But what I find really interesting is the debacle that it has been for people who wanted to do an 'upgrade' from Dapper (6.06). Installing OS upgrades has historically been fraught with problems..."</i>

<br><br><br/><br/>YOU NITWITS ARE FUCKING UP UNIX!<br><br><br/><br/>If a user can notice within a week of a release whether a new version is more or less stable than the previous version, it's crashing <i>way</i> too much.  It should takes years to figure this out.  Or at least many months.  That's like saying, "I just bought a new car... I've had it for two weeks... so far it, breaks down a lot less than the Ford Pinto I had before... it's so much better than the Pinto, it must be a great car!"  Gah!!
<br><br>
Software upgrades -- some of you twits think its a fun to blow away your entire system and re-install from scratch.  Oooh, look at all the software come down the pipe!  Others of us don't really <i>like</i> the idea of blowing the whole damn system away, minus our home directory, and then quite likely having the thing left wedged up or badly damaged.  But then some of us are used to running Microsoft Windows and think that reinstalling from scratch is perfectly normal.
Running NetBSD, before the current goons in charge fucked it all up, and ditto for FreeBSD (including the bit about the goons), upgrading meant fetching the latest .tgzs and uncompression them, rebuilding my device nodes with a cd /dev; sh MAKEDEV all, and then a reboot, if I wanted the upgraded kernel running too -- and a lot of times, I was happy to kill -HUP 1 and restart my network services.  No reinstalling anything, ever.  If I want a newer package, I install it, and it stays installed (magic!).  Now, both upgrading the kernel is a major ordeal and is error prone, and upgrading software is hit-and-miss and restricted to the small pile of packages Debian or RedHat has prebuilt and tested for you, and then you're installing the same packages over and over.
<br><br>
Converts to Unix are fine, but they're running the show now.  It seems like everyone in Linux now days ran Windows for a good long while, and they've brought their value system with them -- specifically, their extremely low standards -- and have been aiming towards those standards in their work in this camp.
If they can't be made to behave, they should be kicked out!
<br><br>
Dear world:  As usual, you're fucking up all of the cool shit for me.  Please knock it off.
<br><br>
Sincerely,<br>
-scott</p>
