<p>At YAPC, I talked a bit about what I've been doing -- writing Perl for the Vegas gaming market.  More specifically, I'm technically an employee but I'm invoicing for hours I use.  So far this month, all of my projects have been blocked on various things -- waiting for a vendor, waiting for a specialist to do some work that I can't, waiting for a trip to the office to be scheduled so I have access to some hardware I need to test against, etc.  An even longer list of things were recently completed.  Hourly sucks when you get your work done quickly.  Bad for me, but good for you.<br/><br/>I got in a vacation to Portland and Seattle and I got some time to code on one of my favorite personal projects, but it's time for me to get back to work here.  My resume is at <a href="http://illogics.org">illogics.org</a>.  I've worked on advanced things, played with Perl innards, completed large projects by myself, played organizer and default speaker to a Perl Mongers group, and even written a book that most people didn't hate.  If you can keep me busy for a while, drop me a note at scott@illogics.org.  <br/><br/>Thanks,
-scott</p>
