<p>(Grammar intended to emphasize revolution and shock).<br/><br/>It may come as a shock to some of us that people have reasons for hating GNU/Linux/BSD/X11/KDE.<br/><br/>* Loses keystrokes randomly (in Firefox) (I hate this too -- what the *hell* is Mozilla Firefox doing that takes 3 CPU seconds to process each keyclick?  Don't the developers type faster than 3wpm?)<br/><br/>* Cut and paste doesn't work (Mozilla tries to re-invent cut and paste and has its own buffer; so does KDE; each program that tries to fix the problem makes it worse; hopefully the X.Org people will save us from ourselves here)<br/><br/>* Can't find where to change settings (maybe FedoraCore or Ubunto would be better here, but KDE controlling some things and 3rd party controls for other things and KDE not integrating better is to blame in my opinion)<br/><br/>* Lost her bookmarks (couldn't someone make a Linux install that installs over a (probably busted) Windows install but copies over just a few settings like the wallpaper and bookmarks just to ease the pain a bit?)<br/><br/>* Doesn't want to have to set her hardware up again (this was a pain in Windows too; built-in support for wifi, video, sound, wired ethernet, usb devices, etc rocks -- it would rock even harder if the printer, camera, and scanner were also supported in core, but then again, maybe I should be running Ubunto or Knoppix or something)<br/><br/>* Web pages don't look right (apparently the Flash plugin is missing)<br/><br/>On the upside:<br/><br/>* Doesn't drop connections randomly<br/><br/>* Hasn't crashed yet (which beats about twice daily)<br/><br/>In this case, I put OpenBSD on because Linux crashes a lot, ext2fs is prone to corruption, and lilo loses the ability to boot, and I didn't want to present "the girl" with any problems recognizable from their Windows counterparts.  That and the system was a mini scale laptop with no removable media whose PC card CD-ROM drive isn't supported,  and it's USB floppy drive also isn't supported by most boot media.<br/><br/>-scott</p>

<h2>Linux file system</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/parv/">parv</a> on 2006-08-16T06:02:14</h3>
Recently on FreeBSD mailing list, some people were praising ZFS (a jouranling file system) which is apparently availble on Linux (besides Sun Solaris).<br><br>Well, the query is if you had tried ZFS. If so, were there still fs-related problems which caused you to use OpenBSD?
