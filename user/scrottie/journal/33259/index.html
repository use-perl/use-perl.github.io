<p>Today I cleaned out the fridge (which took over an hour... many shelves, all grimey), trimmed a bush, pulled a whole bunch of weeds and filled the trash bin with them, washed my dog in the driveway with the hose, ran up and down the wash (differnet kind of "wash"... in Fountain Hills, a wash is part of foothills that got washed out by water, and that by town law isn't developed, and the house sits on one, as most houses in FH do) with the dogs, after pricing those cheezy above ground pools at Target, thinking how much fun it would be to have the dogs swimming in a pool again after both of my doggy owning, pool owning friends moved away.  Added two fish to the tank, two tinfoil barbs, who have a beautifully sweet and kind personality, and who sit there and groove in unison at anyone who looks at them with their big eyes.  I got in the mail, care of eBay, a cheap Chinese powersupply to replace the dead one (that oscillated slowly between 9 volts and 14 when it's supposed to be kicking out 16), which was also made in China but cost a heck of a lot more which was a manufactrrer replacement part replacing a manufacturer part.<br/><br/>And here I sit, finally, twelved hours later than I anticipated, getting to work, with the iPod hooked up to the stereo, kicking out beats... and I feel... happiness.<br/><br/>I love the dogs.  I love the old slumpblock house, redone to be open and spacey and sunny, an architect's dream of practicality and simple comfort, bright and homey.  I love the various nooks and crannies I can geek out with the laptop and wifi.  I love the bookshelves, the wine cabinet, the three patio doors and the huge wrap around patio, the tile, the hidden enclaves in the bushes outside in the corners, of which the house has many, the trees and plants... I love all of it so much.  I feel okay that I fought so hard and so long to be part of it, and to build my life up to more than it was.<br/><br/>And tonight, even though I'm just sitting down to code, the iPod is kicking out good tracks one after another, and I look back at the past few days, where I found the hard bug that I didn't know if I could find, and it all feels so good...<br/><br/>-scott</p>

Scot, you seemed to be awfully cheery this time.  For a change.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br><br>Question, where does one find 'em Fountain Hills?

<br>Fountain Hills, Arizona.  It's but a postage stamp on the map.  In the past few years, Scottsdale grew into Fountain Hills on the west but north is preserve, and east and south are native American land.  So it's a town with a somewhat rural, sleepy feel mixed in with the Phoenix sprawl.<br><br><a href="http://slowass.net/user/scott/pics/driving_fountain_hills_to_balsam_dr.avi" title="slowass.net">http://slowass.net/user/scott/pics/driving_fountain_hills_to_balsam_dr.avi</a slowass.net><br><br>As for my cheeriness, I'm sure I'll be back down again in no time<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)<br><br>-scott<br><br>
