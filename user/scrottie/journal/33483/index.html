<p>Here's some things I'm worry about:<br/><br/>* The 60mhz Sparc will be able to even handle a small playtest
* Throttling turns to 10 seconds apart will piss people off
* The overly vicious robot zombies will piss people off
* Players not being able to slip through lightly barricaded doors is too stark and restrictive (I want to see players beating down barricades just as much as zombies trying to share a hiding place -- it's sick, I know -- unbarricaded metal doors with people watching them will become a precious commodity among those who would willingly share their hiding place)
* In general, I'm using the zombies to pit players against players; as resources such as food and hiding places become more and more scarce, and as players are presented with possibly infected players that will turn to zombies at any moment, they'll turn against each other, and that's when it gets interesting -- I hate the "humans are happy and friendly and helpful and zombies and vicious and mean" dichotomy and want to challenge it -- this whole dark tone might not fly with players<br/><br/>... probably other things.<br/><br/>-scott</p>
