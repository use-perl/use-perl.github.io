<p>Basically no mischief or craziness.  Having DEFCON at a casino did to it exactly what I would have expected.  No money pots to eat the cockroach, no naked fire jugglers, no getting thrown in the pool, no parties by the pool.<br/><br/>Bros outnumber the blackshirts now.  They're talking loudly and proudly about how little they know and care.<br/><br/>Kilts are representing, too.  The freaks are here.  There's a Japanese gang dressed in kimonos.  Some other Japanese guys walked by talking vigorously amonst themselves, laughing and pointing.  Punks with combs, raisers and hairspray are in the contest area/lounge dispensing mohawks.  They have their own official area.  Strange hats abound.  One kid has a fez.  There are BDUs and lab coats.  Lots of colored hair.<br/><br/>Aha!  Finally spotted someone I knew -- Kevin, a friend of Ernie's, who also worked in the gaming industry, but on a different side of it.<br/><br/>People are sitting next to me reading long hex strings from the "background" of the talks description book.<br/><br/>They ran out of badges as usual.  My flight got delayed two hours which seriously cut into my time here.<br/><br/>"My only crime is that of outsmarting you"... shirts have slogans.<br/><br/>There's a lot less interesting in WiFi and a lot more in smartphones.  The common area is woefully inadequate.<br/><br/>UnixSurplus is here again and people are packing in to see old Unix hardware.  Some people are going to be coming home with O2s.<br/><br/>More later, perhaps.<br/><br/>-scott</p>
