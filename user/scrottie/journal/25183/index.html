<p>Macromedia will tell you -- everyone has Flash!
Server logs show it. 
On Flash-only sites, everyone who uses the
site has Flash installed.

None of your coworkers are hyper-sensitive to
pesticide, therefore, people hyper-sensitive
to pesticide must be a myth.
Sometimes one comes in the door.
He or she doesn't last long.
When they're gone, it's easy to write that 
off as a fluke. 
Really, they're afraid to go out in the
world in the first place.
Most of them turn into bums when they
can't get a job they can work or a place
to live that they can actually live at, 
and as anyone
has ever tried it knows, it's really easy to
lose your kilter when you're homeless.
But as long as they aren't around, nagging
you day in and day out, demonstrating
their esquisite pain for you, up close and
personal, it becomes unreal and abstract.
<br><br>
Cheers to everyone who follows my
super-depressing job search log.
I've been looking for a telecommute job, really,
because of just this. 
I got a sweet job with a huge monitor.
When they brought my workstation out, it was
running RedHat Enterprise Linux -- not 
a distro I know anything about, it was the
first time I didn't have to install Linux on
the sly -- it was the preferred option!
Got code checked out from CVS -- and yes, 
they used CVS.
And started to look at it.
Then the Orkin man shows up, spraying the corners
and walls with his wand.
I ran for the door. 
A few people in the company were alerted
to my condition.
One was there as this happened.
When I got home -- not too fried, thankfully --
I sent an email explaining that, due to my
severe sensitivity, I couldn't go back into
the office.
The reply email was basically "okay, bye".
So I can't help feeling a bit like a
Flash-less browser --
shunned, denied, joked about not existing,
written off, ignored.
There are a lot of Perl programmers in the
world -- who cares if we lose one?
