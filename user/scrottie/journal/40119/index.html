<p>I struggle with corporate culture.  Last time I worked for a medium sized company, I resolved to adopt a "don't worry about it" attitude.  I was worrying about things that were other people's jobs; things that could not be fixed; but worst of all, I was worrying about things involved in my interpretation of my project, as compared to my actual assignment.  Right now, I'm looking at a device that has to be programmatically configured.  The Web UI maintains and pulls state from the database, not the device, creating the possibility that the two will get out of sync.  That's one of many examples.  I keep running through "what if" scenarios in my head.  Working on code alone or in very small teams, I have to.  Here, I can't do this.  I have to do something, get feedback, and then go from there.  I have to leave most of the problems unsolved.  For this feature, I need to start with an on/off switch.</p>
