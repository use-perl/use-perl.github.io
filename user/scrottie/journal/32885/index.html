<p>One more, in the middle of a heated meeting about fundamentally a technical problem, announsed his resignation and then was told to skip his two weeks.  This is two people out, as far as I can tell, because of the broken, business serving, but engineering effort draining and fire causing release process.  Rather than arguing with engineers, bully them, throwing your weight aroung -- *listen* to what they're saying.  They're trying to help you.  We're generally cold and impassionate people.  If we ask for something, it's only to get you what you asked for from us.  When we're stuck in the situation where we're paid money by you, and you've asked us to do something, and we can't, or it's being made extremely difficult for artificial reasons -- then there's no resolution for us to stop accepting your money and making implicit promises that we can help.<br/><br/>Argh.<br/><br/>-scott</p>

<h2>Programmers have principles</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/scrottie/">scrottie</a> on 2007-04-03T23:56:02</h3>
<br>Programmers have principles -- technical principles.  You do not ask a programmer to ignore his principles.  A good programmer knows nothing good comes of this.  The gains are short lived and thoroughly not worth the long term cost.  Repeated experience with this solidifies the principle.  A good programmer would no more deploy kludgery or pretend that a broken system works than he would rob a bank.  Yet management is insisting, and taking arms when their demands aren't met.  Ultimately their demands are for the impossible.<br><br>-scott
