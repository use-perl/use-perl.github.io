<p>Perl is an ex-language and I have proof:<br><br><br/><br/><a href="http://www.slowass.net/user/scott/new-and-used-perl-programmers.png">http://www.slowass.net/user/scott/new-and-used-perl-programmers.png</a>.

As you can clearly see, eBay has a "huge selection" of "discount Perl Programmers". 
<br><br>
Seriously, though, these "I counted the number
of jobs on a job site that have the world Perl
in them and then counted the number that have
Java in them and more have Perl" sorry excuses
for studies are failing to take into account
that the jobs mentioning Perl almost never
have Perl as a primarily skill.
See for yourself. 
I won't even bore you with numbers.

<h2>Perl Jobs</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ziggy/">ziggy</a> on 2005-04-11T00:08:50</h3>
There are a decent number of jobs at <a href="http://jobs.perl.org/" title="perl.org">http://jobs.perl.org/</a perl.org> that focus on Perl as a primary skill.  More and more every month, too.  But the overall trend is for Perl as a secondary skill, not a primary skill.  Or a focus on some a specialized mix of skills.
<p>
I've seen this for the last couple of years in the DC market.  But there is another view that's slowly gaining acceptance: that what you really need isn't a specific skill, but a specific aptitude, and that Perl (or Python, or Ruby) programming is an indicator of that aptitude.  So even if you are eventually going to be doing development in C, Java or C#, having a background in Perl is a net benefit for finding jobs/candidates.</p>

However, it is definitely not fun to reenter the job market and discover that now knowing PHP is a liability.
