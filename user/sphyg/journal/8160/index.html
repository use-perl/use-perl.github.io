<p>Tonight was my third trip to London within a week. 

<p>On Saturday, acme, hex and myself went to the BodyWorlds exhibition.   It was full of very cool anatomy and was interesting to see the reactions of people who didn't cut up bodies for a degree.  They had a horse, which means they should do a camel next, and I now have a postcard of a dead guy hacking on a Mac.  After  a Brick Lane curry we perusaded kake and richardc to join us in a Notting Hill pub and then I visited the new flat of richardc and 2shortplanks to watch 'Dude, where's my car?' (dude, sweet).

<p>On Tuesday, tantrix, neko, 2shortplanks and myself braved the tube strike and took the visiting Geoffrey Avery to see the Complete History of America (Abridged) by the Reduced Shakespeare Company.  Bloody funny. 

<p>Tonight was the london.pm social in the Calthorpe Arms.  Nice beer, conversation about parties, sushi, the new PM leaders list, organising a cam.pm tech meet, repaying people money, singing happy birthday to space and meeting jerakeen in the flesh.  Followed by the slooow train home.

<p>I'm looking forward to a (relatively) quiet weekend.  Where quiet equals hosting someone else's birthday party in my house.</p>
