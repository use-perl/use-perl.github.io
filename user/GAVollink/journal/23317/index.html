<p>Assuming I entered a bug in rt.cpan.org, and assuming that the POD within the module specifies that bugs should be reported to rt.cpan.org.<p>
How long should I let that bug sit, marked as 'new' before sending the Author a friendly Email, assuming that author's Email is also available?<p>
Now let's assume that no bugs have been filed against that module before (I even clicked 'Show resolved').<p>
Are we talking weeks, or months?</p>

<h2>Is it my module?</h2>

If it is and the problem is important to you then I'd want a reminder today.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)



<h2>It depends</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/brian_d_foy/">brian_d_foy</a> on 2005-02-23T00:27:12</h3>
The author should have already received a notice from RT.<br> <br>Beyond that, it varies. Some authors don't want people to talk to them directly, and some like personal correspondence. Bug reports with patches are much more useful, too.<br> <br>I'd look at the author's history.  Is he responding to other things in RT? Is he active in any online things?  If so, send a reminder.  If not, maybe the author has disappeared.<br> <br>Is it me?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) If so, just nag me in personal email<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

I will check out the activity - thanks for the idea.



<h2>Oh, and...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/GAVollink/">GAVollink</a> on 2005-02-23T03:40:05</h3>
Really, the problem I ran into isn't very important (a one line change in the Makefile.PL -- missing a dependancy).<p>
The author is still active, so because this one isn't that big a deal - I'm going to ignore it for now.</p><p>
My only concern is that is someone runs into this - they might not pick-out the missing dependancy error message during the 'test'.  I'd almost bet several people have run into it, and simply worked around it without bothering to file a report.</p>

And don't forget, he might be on vacation!<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

<h2>I say go for it</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/samtregar/">samtregar</a> on 2005-02-23T02:45:14</h3>
Go ahead and email him (me?).  At worst you're risking a rude reply but the chances are good he'll appreciate the reminder.  I know I would if it was me...

<p>Likewise.

</p><p>Most people like bug reports, because it means somebody actually used one of his/her modules<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-) I know I do<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>

Hi,<p>

Sorry for interrupting.  I'm just sending you a friendly reminder about a tiny issue that I submitted against <i>module</i>.  It was reported two weeks ago to rt.cpan.org, and is still marked as new.</p><p>

Sorry to be a bother,<br>
