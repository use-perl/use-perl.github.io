<div class="span8">
<p>Hello, my name is Gary Allen Vollink.  I found this site while poking around for information about a module that I found on CPAN.<p>
So, from a CPAN package, to an Author's personal web site, to said Author's<br>
use Perl->Journal();<br>
And just like that, I created an account.  I've been known to hang out on Slashdot, and recognized the "slashcode" interface immediately.<p>
Anyway - I've been a Perl user for about 8 years now, although I've only been heavily writing large web-apps in Perl for the last four years (give or take).<p>
There's a fair chance that I'll be doing some patch-work in modules in the near future (well, I've already started - we'll see how the Author reacts).  I'm starting a largish project, and I'll be needing to squeeze some extra functionality out of some existing Perl libraries.<p>
Anyway, nice to meet you.</p>

Actually, I didn't... It's funny - I've used Perl for years, but never bothered seeking out a community.  It has always seemed so straight forward, and only now am I getting into stuff that requires more than the "standard" RedHat supported packages.<p>
I will check that out... Since you're talking, what are the differences between 'use Perl;' vs 'Perl Monks'?  (Wary of Information overload).</p>

I have sat here looking at a blinking cursor for 5 minutes.  I don't know what else to say other than spend an hour each at both places - it is a lot easier to experience the difference then it is to explain them.

<p>While we're talking about this, what about <a href="http://perlconferences.pvoice.org/" title="pvoice.org">conferences</a pvoice.org>?

</p><p>If you're in Europe (or even if you're not), maybe you could <a href="http://braga.yapceurope.org/" title="yapceurope.org">come to Portugal</a yapceurope.org> in the Summer<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>

See, I work at a small company... Global (US, AU, UK), but small.  So if I were to travel to a conference, it would be on my own dime.  And that's about all I've got to my name right now... a dime (well, a little more than that, but it's not free for spending).<p>
I'm considering joining the local (Minneapolis) PM, I'm on the mailing list, now - not sure if I'll show up at a meeting.  Online fits my style quite nicely for now.</p>

Glad to have you aboard!

<p>Tell us more about your web apps! Using CGI::Application? Another technique?</p>

Thanks for the welcome.  Perhaps I will write a new Journal about some of the stuff I have done (along with disclaimers, etc).<p>
Warning one... I'm an ANSI C guy going way back, and never cared much for the K&amp;R style that Perlers seem to prefer.  (*shrugs*).</p>
