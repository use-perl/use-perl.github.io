Yet another OScon entry so I'll try to keep it short. I see that Matt has added <a href="http://home.sergeant.org/OpenSource_Conference_2002/">his pictures</a> online. If you weren't there this should give you a good feel of what the conference was like as there are many pictures involving drinks.
</p>

It was cool to have Robin around as it was pretty tight for him to come this year. It was also really cool to have expenses covered by the company so I would not have to cut corners like last year when I did not have a job. It was even cooler to have us being moved from the Best Western to the 10th floor of the Sheraton by the ever-so-helpful Nat. Now, that was really it. Robin &amp; I managed to meet with Simon St. Laurent, our editor for the SVG book. Ronal Bourret was there too and was a good laugh. We hung out a lot with the usual gang: Matt and Heather, Kip, Eric, Geoff and the missus, Stas and Michel. I also got to meet people I did not know, DJ and the Jabber crew.
</p>
<p>
Talks went pretty well. The <a href="http://www.graougraou.com/papers/oscon2002/tutorial.tar.gz">SVG Tutorial</a> went very smoothly with reasonable attendance (about 35-40 people) and what seemed like great interest. The <a href="http://www.graougraou.com/papers/oscon2002/SMIL.tar.gz">SVG Animation</a> session was really cool too. It must have been the fourth time I was presenting it so it was bound to go down well. People seemed to really dig my little demos. The Batik talk went ok considering I did not know much about the internals of the project and have never worked with it much. Lightning Talks were really nice too, and with a funny moment during my "Flash Sux, SVG Rox" talk when I was (rightfully) bitching about Macromedia's attitude towards SVG and this Macromedia guy stood up and said who he was working for. I'm already thinking about what I should do for next year, hopefully one session in a different track than XML. I hope to do a tutorial on SVG components if SVG has been going well til then, and it should do.
</p>

How many people had new iBooks? I knew I was one of them, and I know a few people who got one either during the conference or right when they got back home. The iBooks look amazing and OS X rocks (even more with Jaguar just around the corner), so I kind of figured out why everybody was going for one. I got the OS X Missing Manual and Cocoa books from the O'Reilly bookstore. Hopefully next year you will see our book there too... and you'll get it, right?
</p>
<p>
See all of you there next year!
