I keep asking OS X questions here, but you guys know so much. Anyway, I am in the process of buying a new 12" PowerBook. I'm giving the iBook away to an <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/darobin/">old buddy</a>. 
</p>
<p>
I'm pretty happy with the setup I got on my iBook. What I'm looking for is a solution to migrate all my data, programs, preferences, etc to the new PowerBook. I also have an external FireWire drive to help me. Here's a scenario I thought about:
</p>
<p>
  - Boot the iBook in FireWire drive mode from the PowerBook
  - create a gzipped tarball of my complete iBook hard drive
  - move that tarball to the FireWire drive
  - Boot the PowerBook in FireWire mode from the iBook
  - erase all contents of the PowerBook and unzip the tarball on the blank PowerBook hard drive
</p>
<p>
I've got no clue if that would work. How about the .Mac synchronization, can I use it for that purpose. Help much appreciated here!

You'll kill all the HFS+ specific "extras" if you use tar (resource forks, some file attributes,...). There are some rewrites of standard utilities that will take this stuff into account (hfspax, hfstar and so forth), but you're probably better going with either Carbon Copy Cloner or psync. See<br> <br>http://versiontracker.com/moreinfo.fcgi?id=13260&amp;db=mac<br> <br>or<br> <br>http://search.cpan.org/dist/MacOSX-File/bin/psync<br> <br>respectively. (Dan Kogai, author of MacOSX-File, has a nice series of pages outlining the problems and solutions: see<br> <br>http://www.dan.co.jp/cases/macosx/backup-volume.html<br> <br>Indeed, looks like Carbon Copy Cloner has now "adopted" psync into its arsenal.)<br> <br>Good luck,<br>Paul

Right, my last two hops from powerbook to powerbook have basically been:
<ul>
<li>Boot the new powerbook in firewire mode</li>
<li>Plug it in to my old powerbook</li>
<li> <tt>sudo psync -d /<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/Volume/NewPowerbookName</tt></li>
<li>Unmount the disk</li>
<li>Reboot</li>
<li>(Sometimes) if the new machine doesn't boot, the old kernel isn't compatible.  Install OSX again on the new machine, preserving the previous system folder so you can drag junk around.</li>
</ul>
That last step eluded me until I figured out what was going on.  Now I'm happy.

OK on the first step, but you're thinking too UNIX-y from there on out.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)
<p>
If I were switching my one-and-only Mac to another one-and-only Mac, I'd start with a fresh install of the OS on the AlBook; the factory install includes OS 9 and Classic mode.  If you boot the AlBook off of the OS CDs, you can reformat the hard drive to <i>not</i> include OS 9 drivers.  This will prevent OS 9 from being installed.  You might be able to recover some disk space by not installing things that you'll probably never use, like help files localized for Thai.
</p><p>
Next (Step 2), Boot the iBook in FireWire drive mode, and create a disk image of you <b>home</b> directory using DiskCopy (New -&gt; Image from Folder or Volume).  Chances are that anything you'd want to preserve is either in $HOME,<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/Applications, or easily reinstalled (/Developer,<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/System).
</p><p>
From here (Step 3), you can mount the disk image of your old home directory and psync/copy whatever you want.  (This is a good opportunity to reorgainze $HOME, if you want.)  Not only do you have your old $HOME online, but you have a backup as well.  I'm assuming that the AlBook will have enough disk space for your disk images as well as what you copy off of them.  If not, back it up onto a FireWire drive or something.
</p><p>
Finally (Step 4), just reformat and reinstall the OS on the iBook when you're confident you have everything backed up or otherwise accounted for.  Oh, and be kind and try to bring it up-to-date with softwareupdate first.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)  (This is why I make sure to download updates before I install them...)</p>

A friend of mine just bought a 17" powerbook.  After seeing that the 12" just looks, well, small.<br> <br>Mind you, after seeing the 17" powerbook, all laptops look small to me now<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)
