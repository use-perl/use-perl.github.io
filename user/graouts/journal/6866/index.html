I really love my iBook and OS X. Now I am getting a G4 so I can work full-time on OS X. I'm using BBEdit 6.5 and my main gripe with it is that I can't find a way to indent/unindent full blocks. With TextPad I would just select my multi-line block and hit tab or shitf+tab. Anybody here knows a workaround. Actually, I sent an email to the TextPad team to suggest an OS X version since so many geeks are going for OS X these days.

Use "Shift Left/Shift Right" from the Text Menu (bound to Command_+ and Command_-. BTW, I am talking about BBEdit 6.1. Hope this helps.

<h2>Try jedit</h2>

jedit runs really fast on my little G3, and probably has more features than BBEdit (hell, it has more features than any editor I've ever used!). You should give it a try. If you do, let me know as I have the way to make it use Java Swing hardware acceleration.

<tt> <br> BBEdit has a gazillion features. I've been using it for years <br> (my name is in the credits in the about box) and I *still* find <br> usefull new features every time I re-read the manual. <br>  <br> Think of it as reading an OReilly book rather than a software manual. <br>  <br> Also, there's two chatty mailing lists offered for BBEdit. One of <br> them is for general stuff, and the other is for scripting (which <br> includes applescript, perl, python, misc shell scripting) and BBEdit. <br>  <br> The traffic on those lists is about 10-20 messages/day/list at times, <br> so you may want to subscribe in digest mode if that's your thing. You'll <br> get a digest daily (even if it only has one post in it). <br>  <br> BBEdit is the reason I have a mac at work, so I'm certainly biased. <br> I told them to buy me a mac, and they'd make more than their money <br> back in my increased productivity. I wasn't kidding. <br>  <br> Happy hacking<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) <br> -matt <br> </tt>
