<p>Anyone care to share their easy, time-saving methods for reading use.perl journals?<br><br><br/><br/>The traffic here is such that I can usually scan through just about everyone's entries. But I'm slightly ashamed to admit that I just go to the homepage and click each entry in the Recent Journal's area. This hardly seems the way for some who uses perl to do something.<br><br><br/><br/>How do you do it?</p>

<h2>rss aggregator</h2>

I use RSS to read almost all my news, now.  I have a feed from the journal.pl file, which shows me any new journal postings.  I read the news with NetNewsWire.app, but there are dozens of aggregators out there.

I do that, using RSSBandit, which seems to work pretty well for most feeds.  However, I always seem to find that the use.perl feed is "missing" journal entries, compared to my amigos page.

<p>What url do you use for your feed?  I'm using <tt>http://use.perl.org/journal.pl?op=top&amp;content_type=rss</tt>.

I use the same link.  I find that entries that don't show up prompty do show up eventually.  I don't know why, but it's so.

<h2>Hola, amigo.</h2>

When you mark someone as a friend (click on the yellow face image next to a name to start that process), that friend's journal is added to your amigo list.  I made a link to my amigo list and put it in my "User Space" slashbox (which can be modified in your <a href="http://use.perl.org/users.pl?op=edithome" title="perl.org">preferences</a perl.org>).  The following link should be a page of the journals of your friends - <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/cbrandtbuffalo/amigos" title="perl.org">http://use.perl.org/user/cbrandtbuffalo/amigos</a perl.org>.  I also look for journals of people I haven't read before in the "Recent Journals" slashbox.
<p>
You can read the journals I read if you really want to, <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/louis_wu/amigos" title="perl.org">http://use.perl.org/user/louis_wu/amigos</a perl.org>.  Enjoy the journals, they're fun.</p>

The problem is that you eventually hit the "200 friend limit".  I know, I did a few weeks ago, and now I have to stare at the 200 friends and mentally sort the list to see who is unlikely to post a new journal entry soon.
<p>
I really really want a "subcribe to journals" option here.  No go, though.  I shouldn't have to "friend" everyone that I want to read. {grin}</p>

<p>Now that I had just thought about a way to add everyone as my friend, they tell me...</p>

Otherwise I still have to use a web browser, which I would rather not do.
