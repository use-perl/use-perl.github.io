<p>No problems with my wife's blood work, so we're scheduled for Monday morning at 9AM. So she just needs to tolerate one more weekend of contractions and discomfort.

<p><p>We went on a tour of the <a href="http://www.chob.edu/services/services_display.asp?SID=187&CID=9">NICU</a>. It's a first-class facility, recently completely renovated. It just looks like you'd want a special care unit to look--very clean, very high-tech--and all of the staff are highly-qualified.

<p><p>We're hoping the babies will be big enough and not have any problems so they won't have to go there, but it's nice to know they are there if we need them.

<p><p>I should also mention that my son Aiden has been a absolute trooper through all of this. He's been shuttled around from me to one grandparent to another, and has been without his mom for almost two weeks now, and he's barely batted an eyelash.

Yeah, it's become very iffy...but if I can't come, I'm going to try to tap into the video conferencing and make a 'virtual' appearance.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

We missed Friday too, which is my father-in-law's birthday.

<p><p>And we were told by the staff that we didn't want to do it on a weekend. Apparently even a 24/7 hospital still has the best and most staff here Monday-Friday. I guess they like weekends too.</p>
