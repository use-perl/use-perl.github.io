<p>I'm overhearing our Windows admin helping to set someone up on a new computer and while most of the conversation is "mumble, mumble" I keep hearing a distinctive "whack, whack." I guess this is windows speak for backslash now.<br/><br/>I know we have our "bangs" and "hash bangs" and "shebangs," but this "whack, whack" business just sounds silly. Maybe it's the person saying it, or the way he's saying it, or the fact that I think that anything on Windows is silly.<br/><br/>Is this common Windows-speak now? This is a first for me.

Many people use "backwhack" to mean a backslash.  So it makes perfect sense that a slash would be called "whack".

<p> <a href="http://www.everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=1178790" title="everything2.com">Whack  whack</a everything2.com> </p> <p>Hmm, this says that a backslash is a whack (or backwhack) so then what do you call a slash?  I think that they are just confused.</p>

I first heard that from the speaker of a Microsoft (sic!) Presentation for<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.NET.<br><br>The most funny part was the part after http, "Doublepoint-whack-whack-double-u-double-u-double-u-dot"

<h2>WWW</h2>

I think that I've heard the 'whack' before.  It does sound a little silly, but then I get really funny looks when I'm teaching a class and say 'shebang'.
<br> <br>
Another one that gets me rolling is the many ways to say WWW.  Here are a few that I've heard:
<ul>
  <li>dubya-dubya-dubya</li>
  <li>triple-dub</li>
  <li>dub-dub-dub</li>
  <li>dubya-three</li>
</ul>
I think the 'dub-dub-dub' has to be the funniest.  Everytime someone says it I can't help but think of some old nursery rhyme about three men in a tub.

If I hear anyone saying that I will slap them upside the head! I mean it!



<h2>Whack</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/petdance/">petdance</a> on 2005-08-17T17:50:03</h3>
Yeah, I used whack back when I was a Windows guy 5+ years ago.<br/><br/>We still need a name for<nobr> <wbr></nobr>::, as in "Test colon-colon More" which is too long to say.
