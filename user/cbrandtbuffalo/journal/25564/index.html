<div class="span8">
<p>I heard the news about the bombing in London this morning on the way into work and my first thought was "I know people in London--I hope all the London.pm'ers are OK." One of the really cool parts of the Perl community is you meet people from all over the world. It really brings home our "world community" when events in another part of the world can impact people you know.

<p>So here's hoping everyone in London.pm is OK, and everyone else in London for that matter.</p>

Most are talking on IRC. Everyone seems to be fine.
<p>
Transportation is going to be an issue as mainline trains aren't going anywhere near London now and all underground and bus services have been suspended in Zone 1. It's going to be a bit hectic at least until tomorrow.</p>

<i>Most are talking on IRC</i>

<p>With the Londoners, that doesn't prove a thing.</p>

I meant talking on IRC, not logged in. <p>As far as I'm aware only TeeJay was caught up in it all, as he had an appointment at a hospital. He was at the hospital though before it all the blasts.</p>

<p>I know you did.

</p> <p>As I said, that doesn't mean anything when you're talking about the Londoners<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

</p> <p>There are never certainties with those guys<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>

Thanks for the feedback. I don't usually do IRC during the day, but I may have to lurk a bit today to see what's up.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
