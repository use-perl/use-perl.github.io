<p>After coming back from YAPC, I always have a bunch of ideas so I'm going to try to start capturing them here.

<p>One area I want to focus more on is making it easier for people to participate in the community. I think one way this is made difficult is through many little things the uber-geeks don't even think about. So I'd like to put out a request right now for someone to submit a talk for YAPC next year called "How we communicate in the Perl community" Here's the outline:
<ul>
<li>about use.perl.org
<li>about IRC (with a nice how-to session and rules to avoid getting flamed; also show some clients)
<li>how to use a wiki and where the conference wiki is
<li>ichat and various other chat clients and how to sign up
<li>perlmonks
</ul>

<p>You get the idea. Any one of these might be a full 20 minute or 40 minute session, but an overview would be nice to get people in. I think many people forget the initial difficulty learning all this stuff, and it creates a conference inside a conference that people are excluded from when they don't know about these things.

<p>I might do the talk myself, but I'm far from an expert in any of these, especially IRC. Maybe someone would like to do a presentation with me and do the IRC part?</p>

Cool idea! Let's do something for OSCON as a trial run. We have a lot of free time this month, right?

Sold. We'll have something ready for OSCON, even if the presentation is only 10 minutes.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) Ingy has set the bar by preparing a few hours before. Maybe we can realize his dream of having the audience prepare the presentation for us.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

<h2>This is a terrific idea</h2>

Sorely needed!
<p>I'd volunteer to help but I've been using Perl for 10 years and I only really know about the use.perl and perlmonks, both of which I'm still underutilizing (I'm sure). But I'd be happy to be a "canary" and review/edit anything you might produce via the net, or participate in any other way you might suggest.</p>
