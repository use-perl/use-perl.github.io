<p>We've been pushing the doctor to schedule the C-section for Friday, but things are quite busy here at the hospital. They ordered a bunch of tests, including blood work, and if everything is normal we wait until Monday. If anything looks abnormal, they'll get us in for tomorrow. The end is in sight.

<p><p>How busy is it here at the hospital? Well, my wife's floor is completely full now and we can hear the new baby music every couple of hours (they play a lullaby over the PA system when a new baby is delivered). Apparently Labor and Delivery was so busy last night that they were turning people away. I'm sure they were doing some triage and not sending away people with babies emerging, but that's still pretty busy.

<p><p>We're also waiting for a tour of the neonatal ICU. But the way things are going, the babies might be big enough that they won't even need to go there.
