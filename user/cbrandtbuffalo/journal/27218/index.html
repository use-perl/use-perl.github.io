<div class="span8">
<p>For those of you following along at home, we had no bids by the original bid deadline in September. Once this word got out, some bold souls said, "This will not do!" and asked if we would still accept bids.

<p><p>"But of course!" we said, and so the race was on. We set a new date, which was this last Saturday, and we received three proposals.

<p><p>The three contenders are: Boston, Chicago, and Vancouver (all NHL cities, I might add). The TPF conferences committee will be going over the bids, discussing, and voting soon. We'll try to have an answer in the next two weeks.</p>

<h2>NHL, of course</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jmm/">jmm</a> on 2005-10-17T19:41:49</h3>
<i>Boston, Chicago, and Vancouver (all NHL cities, I might add)</i> <p>
As are Toronto, Buffalo, Montreal, Pittsburg.  (I'm not sure whether it was the right St. Louis or whether the St. Louis Blues were still there at the time.  Boca Raton, is not an NHL city, though, unless the Florida Panthers are close enough to qualify them.)  We're not likely to ever get a game visit as a side excustion for a YAPC::NA, though, unless the June timeframe is ever changed.</p><p>
By the way, congrats Jim, on your new position.  I wonder if Allison's head will expand with so many hats being passed around to other heads.</p>

All the better, though, since I wouldn't be able to concentrate on perl.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br><br></p><p> <i>By the way, congrats Jim, on your new position. </i><br><br></p><p>Thanks very much.<br></p>
