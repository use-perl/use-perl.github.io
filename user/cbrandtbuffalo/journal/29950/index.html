<p>We were all scheduled for Monday and my wife told me to spend most of Sunday with our son Aiden and enjoy father's day. I was doing just that when, right after lunch, I got a call from my wife at the hospital and she said she was in labor!

<p><p>I guess no one told the babies what the plan was. :)

<p><p>So I did some rushing around to find someone to watch my son and sped down to the hospital. And around 5:30 PM last evening, Cameron (4 lbs. 6 oz.), Liam (4 lbs. 11 oz.), and Grace (5 lbs. 1 oz.) made their entrance.

<p><p>The babies are in the NICU for now for observation, but all are breathing normally and they should be moved to the regular newborn nursery today or tomorrow. Everyone is doing well and mom is resting comfortably (somewhat).</p>

looks like i did influence them to be born on my bday. i did something like this with undersized twins 3 years ago. the couple came to our house for a french toast brunch on new year's day. she delivered them the next day. i must explore this new power of mine and see if i want to use it for good or evil! MUAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!<br><br>uri, the labor inducer!<br><br>P.S. print "congrats!\n" x 3 ;<br><br>P.P.S. so you will now be able to go to yapc::chicago?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br>
