<p>We've had quite a few varieties of weather today including sleet, freezing rain, and several inches of snow. This is in addition to perpetual below-freezing temperatures. But in Buffalo, this just constitutes a normal day during the winter. The commute (if you can call it that) was a bit slow, and there were a few accidents, but for the most part everyone just goes on as normal.<br><br><br/><br/>Buffalo certainly takes its share of teasing for the weather, but we're pretty good at handling it. When a large portion of the US is hit with tough weather, it brings a smile to the face of a Buffalonian to see whole cities shut down while we just shovel out our car and go to work.<br><br><br/><br/>Of course, if we shut down because of snow, we'd never be open...</p>

<h2>View from an outsider</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/merlyn/">merlyn</a> on 2004-01-27T18:49:57</h3>
I'm in Buffalo this week, working with Jim's peers in another group at the University, and I deliberately picked a hotel that was a short 5-minute jaunt (in fact I can see the work building from my hotel room).  So, I planned on "maybe a few extra minutes" to knock some snow off the car this morning, and ended up taking 20 minutes to scrape off a half-inch freezing-rain ice layer from the car while standing in 5 degree (fahrenheit) temperatures.
<p>
If this is "business as usual", I'm glad I don't live here!</p>



<h2>The good old days</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/delegatrix/">delegatrix</a> on 2004-01-27T19:09:03</h3>
I am so glad I left Buffalo . . .
<p>
Now I can talk about the good old days when school never closed and snow drifts were 6 ft high.
</p><p>
But I don't have to drive in that anymore to get to work.
</p><p>
However, I am looking forward to YAPC this June.  The city should be thawed and I can go get wings.</p>
