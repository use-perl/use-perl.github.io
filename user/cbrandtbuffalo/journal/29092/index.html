<p>After nearly 10 years of slogging away and 3 previous trips to the finals, my <a href="http://www.pointstreak.com/players/players-team.html?teamid=37875">ice hockey team</a>, P22, has finally won the division championship. It was a close game, and I was playing with slightly bruised ribs, but it sure feels good today (as long as I don't cough :-).
<p><p><b>Update:</b> And for you skeptics out there, some <a href="http://performaxhockey.com/finalwinners.htm">pictures</a> (look for the yellow jerseys).</p>

That's all, just congratulations!

Thanks! Added a link to the victory photo. If you look really close in front of our goalie, you can see the trophy.

Awesome.  I have not played hockey in over a year.  I miss it.  But, I have more important things to do (hard to believe!) and am, I regret, getting older, and it is harder to bounce back from injuries, which are become more severe.<br><br>The two things I regret the most: not playing more when I was younger, and buying a new helmet right before the last game I played.<br>

I can relate. As I mentioned in my post, I bruised my ribs in the first game of the finals (it was a three-game play-off) and they still hurt now. In fact, they still hurt enough that I can't sleep on that side and I really feel it if my son jumps on that side.

<p><p>I've got a helmet story too. A few years ago, I had one of the old-style formed-foam-insert helmets. It was new, but there was a time when that's what all hockey helmets were like. I took a slapshot in the head and it was hard enough to knock a sticker off my helmet. When I got to the bench one of my teammates notices a red mark on my jersey collar. Well, turns out I had a cut on my head under the helmet! I finished the game, but needed about 5 stitches to close it up.

</p><p><p>After that, I went and paid the little bit extra for one of the modern helmets that are much more like bicycle helmets.

</p><p><p>My wife has given me 3 major injuries and she's going to make me quit. I broke my ankle in 3 places a few years ago, so that's one. There is a dispute over the cut on the head. I say if I finish the game, it's not a major injury.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

</p><p><p>A few guys on my team are in the 43-ish range and they are still going strong, so I'm going to try to keep up with them since it will be a few years before I'm there.</p>

Yeah, I quit after my second major injury.  First one was really major: cartilage damage in my wrist that required surgery, and it's never been the same since.  Second one was the last game I played: serious hamstring pull right before Christmas.  I figure I don't need a third.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br>
