<div class="span8">
<p>For those of you wondering, here's an update on our pending triplets:

<p><p>Monday morning we drove in to the <a href="http://www.chob.edu/services/services_display.asp?SID=285&CID=10">Labor and Delivery</a> department at <a href="http://www.chob.edu/index.asp">Women and Children's Hospital</a> here in Buffalo. Triplets are considered high-risk, so this is the hospital our doctor wants us to work with.

<p><p>Although my wife had been having contractions, there were no other signs of labor and that isn't what made us decide to come in. She woke up feeling terrible and proceeded to get sick and get a bloody nose. Since the bloody nose can be a sign of high blood pressure, we decided to make the trip.

<p><p>After a full day of tests and monitoring, they decided to admit her to the hospital for observation. They also started taking steps to help the babies along if they did have to deliver. They were at 32 weeks and a few days on Monday. That's average for triplets, but still earlier than we wanted to deliver.

<p><p>So they started with some <a href="http://fpb.case.edu/Bedrest/handouts/medicationshandout.htm">Procardia</a> (called Nifedipine in that page) to help control the contractions and administered a steroid to help the babies' lungs develop faster. The Procardia took the edge off the contractions and spread them out, so true labor seemed less imminent.

<p><p>She has since been moved up to the <a href="http://www.chob.edu/services/services_display.asp?SID=292&CID=10">high-risk mother floor</a> to a nice quiet room where she can rest. She can order any sort of food she wants and as much as she wants. So she's now receiving excellent care while we wait. Tomorrow is 33 weeks, and our hope is to make it until next Friday, which would be 34 weeks. At 34 weeks, all sorts of statistics improve dramatically in the babies' favor, especially the amount of time they have to stay in the hospital.

<p><p>So here I sit hooked up through my modem to the hospital room phone while my wife sleeps. :)</p>

Holy cow! Congratulations. I've got twins so I can only image how much fun triplets will be.<br><br>Super hard work, especially the first year. Accept all the help you can get<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-) It's awesome though. Families with multiples have something really special. Good luck and welcome to the club!

Congratulations!  My wife and I had twins back in January, so I can only imagine 2/3 of what it would be like<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)  I hope these aren't your first children.  My wife and I have a 7 yr old and a 4 yr old and I think having them one at a time helped us greatly for when the twins came (plus they're old enough to help!<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br><br>Again, congrats!

Yep, we have a 4-year-old and we thought the same thing. We feel somewhat prepared, at least for some of the parenting details. And we're hoping he will help too!<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
