<p>It appears the real world has intruded on the PHP folks as one of their core developers has <a href="http://news.php.net/php.internals/25023">said goodbye</a>, apparently because of <a href="http://news.php.net/php.internals/25044">things going on the in real world</a>. As our world seems to be headed for more turbulence, I'm sure this isn't the last of this type of thing we'll see.</p>

<p>He would have found out that Hezbollah was using that post as a <b> <i>shield</i> </b> and the building that just collapsed did so <b> <i>8</i> </b> hours after the attack on it.</p>

<p>I guess that takes too much effort...</p>

I did, but not to comment on the reasons. I was just struck by how the advance of knowledge seems to be periodically interrupted by wars. Just watched a <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/archimedes/" title="pbs.org">NOVA</a pbs.org> episode last night and it discusses how Archimedes texts were found and lost again because of hostilities.

<p><p>It just got me wondering if we're not headed for a similar period of time.</p>

<p>I would have to lean towards no on that. Primarily because it was so much harder to keep information in his time that a war could disrupt that. Information is to prolific now days.</p>

<p>Honestly? Even if that case wasn&#8217;t as outrageous as claimed, there&#8217;s still no justification for what Israel is doing. (Nor is there any for the Hezbollah shellings that forced Israel&#8217;s hand, but I don&#8217;t feel like getting into that ugly mess and terrible waste&#8230;)</p>

There's every justification for what Israel is doing.  Indeed, they have no reasonable alternative options.<br>

<p>I said Israel&#8217;s hand was forced, in case you didn&#8217;t notice. However, I don&#8217;t know what they&#8217;re thinking, but what they appear to be doing does not seem to be designed to strike down the Hezbollah quickly, even as it&#8217;s costing a lot of civillian lives. Sorry, that&#8217;s not justified.</p>

I also notice you said it wasn't justified, and I disagreed with that.<br><br><em>what they appear to be doing does not seem to be designed to strike down the Hezbollah quickly</em><br><br>I sortof agree.  I think it is designed to strike down Hezbollah for the long term, not necessarily doing it quickly.<br><br><em> Sorry, that&#8217;s not justified.</em><br><br>Yes, it is.<br>

<p>No, it isn't.</p>
<p>YES, IT IS!</p>
<p>NO, IT ISN'T</p>
<p>And so on, in <em>saecula saeculorum</em>. Just as with quite about everything having to do even remotely with politics. I'm for the "no, it isn't" school of thought BTW, and I think I have arguments as to why it is not. But however tempted I am to bring them out, I know in advance it would be pointless, but possibly for my own pride, which is a very poor thing. I am not to convince anyone, and no one can convince me of the opposite position. The best you can get is someone conceding you some points, but there will always be some "but"...</p>

I couldn't care less to convince anyone of my point of view.  I was only playing the contrarian, because Aristotle unreasonably asserted, essentially as a matter-of-fact, that Israel was unjustified.  But, quite obviously, there are valid arguments on the other side.  If I had wanted to convince him, I'd have actually given some of thise arguments, but I realized, like you did three months later, that there was no real point to it.<br>
