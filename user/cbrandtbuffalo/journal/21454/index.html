<p>Pudge says the <a href="http://use.perl.org/comments.pl?sid=23159&cid=35396">curse is lifted</a>, but I think I agree with <a href="http://use.perl.org/comments.pl?sid=23161">Randal that it isn't</a>. I always heard it was the World Series. I'd like to go to <a href="http://www.bambinoscurse.com/whatis/">this bambino site</a> to find out, but it appears I'm not the only one since I can't pull it up. Any curse experts care to weigh in?</p>

Now that the Babe's team has been beaten, Boston can try to reverse The Curse, win the Series for the first time since 1918 and bring happiness to the Hub, which can scarcely believe the tumultuous turn of events.

I'd consider that rather authoritative proof that the curse will be lifted only when the sox take the world series.  All we saw last night was the final step before the real step.</p>

Indeed, the Sox have been to the World Series 4 times since then.  They just haven't won.

It also lists winning the world series (not since 1918) as the evidence of the curse, mentioning that they've gotten to the series final 4 times and lost each in the 7'th game.  (So, this is not the first time that they gotten past the [damn] Yankees although perhaps the other 4 times they didn't have to defeat the Yankees explicitly themselves to win the pennant.)<p>

I too had always heard of the curse as their not being able to win the World Series, but then I too am not a Boston fan or even not especially much of a baseball fan except through my father-in-law from whom I heard of the curse last year, when both Boston and Chicago were in danger of lifting their respective curses - but both failed to do so.  (If he were still alive, I'd have asked him about this now.)</p>

I must say, though, that coming back to win after losing the first 3 games is extremely impressive.  Most teams would have blinked.

No question that the Sox earned it. They were great games to watch. I was especially pulling for Schilling and boy did he deliver!<br> <br>The other thing I was amazed at was how both catchers were still able to play after so many consecutive games. Amazing!
