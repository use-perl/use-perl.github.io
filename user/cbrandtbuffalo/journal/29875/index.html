<p>My wife is still in the hospital, waiting. Yesterday the doctor decided to take her off the Procardia. Unfortunately, he didn't share that with her and we only found out when her next dose was due and the nurse told us.

<p><p>Apparently, for many women, the procardia doesn't work to stop labor after the first few days. So the doctor wanted to take her off for a while and see if it was doing anything.

<p><p>Turns out it was. Her contractions started becoming more regular and much closer together and her blood pressure started going up again.

<p><p>So we talked to the resident and they agreed to put her back on it. Things settled down again in the evening and in the morning, the doctor agreed to keep her on it.

<p><p>Tomorrow, the rotation will put a new doctor on. We're hoping it's the doctor we were seeing through the office for the entire pregnancy. It's a rotation of 3 high-risk doctors, so we've been seeing one of her partners.</p>
