<p>I'm thrilled to announce the release of Bricolage-Devel 1.7.4 &quot;Sacramento&quot;,
the first release candidate for Bricolage 1.8.0. This version of the
open-source content management system addresses all of the bugs discovered
since the release of the fourth development release, 1.7.4, and adds several
new features and numerous improvements. The most significant changes since
1.7.3 include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>New Features</li>
  <ul>
    <li>A &quot;Bulk Publish&quot; link in ADMIN-&gt;PUBLISHING that lets
        members of the Global Admins group publish story and media documents
        by category. [Scott]</li>

    <li>Added <code>notes()</code> method to Bric::Util::Burner, along with the
        accompanying <code>clear_notes()</code>. The <code>notes()</code> method provides a place
        to store burn data data, giving template developers a way to share
        data among multiple burns over the course of publishing a single
        story in a single category to a single output channel. Any data
        stored here persists for the duration of a call to <code>burn_one()</code>.
        [David]</li>

    <li>Added new contributed scripts for Bricolage button generation. These
        scripts use the Gimp to generate localized buttons for the Bricolage
        UI based on the contents of an input file. See
        contrib/button_gen/README for details. [Florian Rossol]</li>

    <li>Added support for icons for all media documents when the
        <code>USE_THUMBNAILS</code> bricolage.conf directive is enabled. These rely on
        the presence of PNG icon files for each MIME type in
        comp/media/mime. Only one such icons is distributed with Bricolage,
        comp/media/mime/none.png (borrowed from the KDE project under
        <a href="http://artist.kde.org/new/license.html#others">a free
        license</a>), which is the default icon when the MIME type of a media
        file is unknown or when no icon file exists for the MIME type of the
        media file. Administrators are free to add their own icons, and the
        <code>copy_gnome_icons</code> script in contrib makes it easy to use GNOME
        icons. [David]</li>

    <li>Added <code>bric_template_diff</code> and <code>bric_template_patch</code> scripts in
        contrib/bric_template_diff. These scripts can be used to sync
        templates between two Bricolage servers. [Sam]</li>

    <li>added <code>bric_media_load</code> to <code>contrib/</code>. This script copies media into
        Bricolage while accounting for the new to update existing media.
        [Sam]</li>

    <li>Added HTMLArea support. This adds a new type of field to be added to
        elements and contributor types, &quot;WYSIWYG&quot;. Such fields are then
        displayed in the UI using HTMLArea, a WYSIWYG HTML editor. This can
        be useful in particular for simple fields that often need emphasis
        added or links. It is not currently available in Bulk Edit or Super
        Bulk edit. See Bric::Admin for installation and configuration
        details. [Eric Sellers]</li>

  </ul>
  <li>Improvements</li>
  <ul>
    <li>The list of categories for which permissions can be granted to user
        groups to access the documents and templates in the category now
        displays the categories for each site separately, so that categories
        with same URIs (such as for the root category in each site) can be
        easily told apart. Reported by Ho Yin Au. [David]</li>

    <li>The list of workflows for which permissions can be granted in the
        permissions page now includes the parenthesized name of the site
        each workflow is associated with. [David]</li>

    <li>Modified the indexes on the <code>workflow__id</code> and <code>desk__id</code> columns of
        the story, media, and formatting (template) tables to be more
        efficient, being indexed only when their IDs are greater than 0
        (that is, when a story, media document, or template is actually on a
        desk and in a workflow). [David]</li>

    <li>Added a method <code>is_fixed</code> to story and media objects, to determine
        whether a business asset has a fixed URL (for example, a Cover
        page). Refer to Bric::Biz::Asset::Business. [Scott]</li>

    <li>Added the <code>ENABLE_OC_ASSET_ASSOCIATION</code> bricolage.conf directive to
        remove the ability to associate output channels from the story and
        media profiles. [Scott]</li>

    <li>The element admin profile now automatically adds the currently
        selected site context to new elements, thus generally saving a step
        when creating new elements. [Jo&atilde;o Pedro]</li>

    <li>Added an interface to 'Clone' for stories so that you can change the
        category, slug, and cover date, because otherwise an identical story
        is created, which would cause errors for some stories. Clones are no
        longer allowed to have URIs that are identical to the stories they
        were cloned from. [Scott & David]</li>

    <li>Added the ability to Delete from desks (same as My Workspace). Note
        however, that you can't delete from a publish desk. [Scott]</li>

    <li>Completely documented the document element classes:
        Bric::Biz::Asset::Business::Parts::Tile,
        Bric::Biz::Asset::Business::Parts::Tile::Data, and
        Bric::Biz::Asset::Business::Parts::Tile::Container. This should make
        it a bit easier on templators learning their way around the
        Bricolage API. [David]</li>

    <li>Refactored quite a bit of the code in the element classes. Renamed
        the methods with &quot;tile&quot; in their names to use &quot;element&quot; instead (but
        kept the old ones around as aliases, since they're used throughout
        the UI). Added a few methods to make the interface more complete.
        [David]</li>

    <li><p>Modified the <code>get_containers()</code> method of
        Bric::Biz::Asset::Business::Parts::Tile::Container to take an
        optional list of key name arguments, and to return only the
        container subelements with those key names. This is most useful in
        templates, where it's fairly common to get a list of container
        subelements of only one or two particular types out all at once. It
        neatly replaces code such as this:</p>

<pre>
for ( my $x = 1; my $quote = $element->get_container('quote', $x); $x++ ) {
    $burner->display_element($quote);
}
</pre>

        <p>With this:</p>

<pre>
for my $quote ($element->get_containers('quote')) {
    $burner->display_element($quote);
}
</pre>

        <p>And is more efficient, too. [David]</li></p>

    <li>Modified the <code>get_elements()</code> method of
        Bric::Biz::Asset::Business::Parts::Tile::Container to take an
        optional list of key name arguments, and to return only the
        subelements with those key names. [David]</li>

    <li>Added the <code>get_data_elements()</code> method to
        Bric::Biz::Asset::Business::Parts::Tile::Container. This method
        functions exactly like <code>get_containers()</code> except that it returns
        data element objects that are subelements of the container element.
        It also takes an optional list of key name arguments, and, if
        passed, will return only the subelements with those key names.
        [David]</li>

    <li>The <code>ANY()</code> subroutine will now throw an exception if no arguments
        are passed to it. Suggested by Dave Rolsky. [David]</li>

    <li>Added the <code>unexpired</code> parameter to the <code>list()</code> method of the story
        and media classes. It selects for stories without an expire date, or
        with an expire date set in the future. [David]</li>

    <li>The &quot;User Override&quot; admin tool is now available to all users. But a
        user can only override another user if she has EDIT permission to
        that other user. This makes it easier for user administrators to
        masquerade as other users without having to change passwords.
        [David]</li>

    <li>Eliminated another SQL performance bottleneck with simple searches
        of media assets. [Jo&atilde;o Pedro]</li>

    <li>Images with no dimension greater than the <code>THUMBNAIL_SIZE</code>
        bricolage.conf directive are no longer expanded to have one side at
        least <code>THUMBNAIL_SIZE</code> pixels, but are left alone. [David]</li>

    <li>Thumbnails are now displayed when searching media to related to an
        element. [David]</li>

    <li>Thumbnails are now displayed in related media subelements. [David]</li>

    <li>Added <code>preview_another()</code> method to Bric::Util::Burner. This method
        is designed to be the complement of <code>publish_another()</code>, to be used
        in templates during previews to burn and distribute related
        documents so that they'll be readily available on the preview server
        within the context of previewing another document. [Serge Sozonoff]</li>

    <li>Added the <code>subelement_key_name</code> parameter to the <code>list()</code> method of
        the story and media classes. This parameter allows searches on the
        key name for a container element that's a subelement of a story or
        media document. [David]</li>

    <li>Added support for all of the parameters to the <code>list_ids()</code> method
        of the Story, Media, and Template classes to the <code>list_ids()</code> method
        of the corresponding SOAP classes. This allows for much more robust
        searches via the SOAP interface. [David & Scott]</li>

    <li>Eliminated <code>login_avail()</code> PostgreSQL function, replacing it with a
        partial constraint. This not only makes things simpler code-wise,
        but it also eliminates backup and restore problems where the <code>usr</code>
        table is missing. The downside is that it requires PostgreSQL 7.2
        instead of our traditional minimum requirement of 7.1. So any
        PostgreSQL 7.1 users will need to upgrade before upgrading to this
        version of Bricolage. Suggested by Josh Berkus. [David]</li>

  </ul>
  <li>Bug Fixes</li>
  <ul>
    <li><code>make clone</code> will now properly clone a database on a different
        database server, provided the host name (and port, if necessary)
        have been provided. Thanks to Ho Yin Au for the spot! [David]</li>

    <li>Admin tool lists that include the number &quot;9&quot; in the corner of a
        table of items is now properly orange instead of green. Reported by
        Ho Yin Au. [David]</li>

    <li>Bricolage works with Perl 5.6.x again, although it's pretty strongly
        deprecated. Perl 5.8.0 or later is required for character set
        conversion and if any content uses characters outside of US ASCII.
        Thanks to John Greene for the spot! [David]</li>

    <li>Image files uploaded in formats not recognized by Image::Info no
        longer trigger an error. Reported by Alexander Ling. [David]</li>

    <li>Changing the cover date of a media document once again correctly
        updates the primary URI of the media document. Reported by Serge
        Sozonoff. [David]</li>

    <li>Fixed API that was causing no elements to be returned on &quot;Add
        sub-elements&quot; page, when &quot;Filter by site context&quot; was turned on.
        [Jo&atilde;o Pedro]</li>

    <li>When the SOAP server serializes and deserializes element templates,
        it now correctly identifies the element by its key name, rather than
        its name. Thanks to Jo&atilde;o Pedro for the spot! [David]</li>

    <li>The template profile's &quot;cheat sheet&quot; of the subelements of an
        element now correctly display subelement key names instead of
        munging element names, as was required before version 1.7.0. [Jo&atilde;o
        Pedro]</li>

    <li><code>Bric::SOAP::Category-&gt;list_ids</code> now converts site names to site
        IDs. [Jo&atilde;o Pedro]</li>

    <li><code>Bric::Util::Burner-&gt;preview</code> once again defaults to previewing in
        an asset's primary output channel instead of using the element's
        primary output channel. [Jo&atilde;o Pedro]</li>

    <li>Added <code>first_publish_date</code> attribute to the SOAP input and output
        for stories and media. [David]</li>

    <li>The category SOAP class now correctly calls <code>lookup()</code> with the site
        ID to prevent multiple categories with the same names but in
        different sites from being looked up. [Jo&atilde;o Pedro]</li>

    <li>User overrideable preferences are now properly checked for
        permissions to allow users with READ permission to a user to see the
        permissions. [David]</li>

    <li>Users can now edit their own user-overrideable preferences. [David]</li>

    <li>Group management now works more correctly in user profiles where
        users have on READ access to the user object. [David]</li>

    <li>Removed queries added in 1.7.2 that were running at Bricolage
        startup time. They could cause DBI to cache a database handle and
        return it after Apache forks, leading to strange errors such as
        &quot;message type 0x49 arrived from server while idle&quot;, and
        occaisionally a frozen server. [David]</li>
