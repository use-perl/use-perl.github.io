<p>I'm thrilled to announce the release of Bricolage-Devel 1.7.3, the fourth
development release for what will soon become Bricolage 1.8.0. This
version of the open-source content management system addresses all of the
bugs discovered since the release of the third development release, 1.7.2,
and adds several new features and numerous improvements. The most
significant changes since 1.7.2 include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>New Features</li>
  <ul>
    <li>The virtual FTP server now moves templates into workflow when
        they're uploaded and puts them into the user's sandbox. This
        behavior allows the user to test the template changes without
        imposing possible bugs upon other Bricolage users. This approach is
        much safer than the previous behavior, which simply checked in and
        deployed a template upon upload. Templates can still be deployed via
        the virtual FTP server by appending <code>.deploy</code> to their names. The
        original behavior of always deploying templates upon upload can be
        restored by enabling the <code>FTP_DEPLOY_ON_UPLOAD</code> bricolage.conf
        directive. [David]

    <li>Added <code>ANY</code> function to be used with select parameters to story,
        media, and template (formatting) list. Pass a list of values to this
        function to have any of of them match for a given parameter. This is
        especially useful for matching on, say, a list of URIs or category
        IDs. This function is automatically available in templates. [David]

    <li>Added a feature that counts characters used in a textarea subelement
        on the fly. It displays this figure and the number of characters
        left, immediately above the textarea. This feature is enabled when
        the Max size attribute for the textarea is given a non zero value
        when adding it to the element profile stage. The JavaScript will
        also not allow you to have more than max size characters in the
        textarea by truncating the data to that number of characters every
        time someone adds another character beyond the maximum. [Paul
        Orrock/Digital Craftsmen]

    <li>Added a feature to display image thumbnails in the search results
        and active view for media objects that are image objects. This
        feature uses the Perl module Imager from CPAN and the relevant image
        library for each format you want to display. It can be turned on or
        off using the <code>USE_THUMBNAILS</code> bricolage.conf directive. See
        Bric::Biz::Asset::Business::Media::Image for more information. [Paul
        Orrock/ Digital Craftsmen]

  </ul>
  <li>Improvements</li>
  <ul>
    <li>More story, media, and template query optimization. [David]

    <li>The story, media, and template queries now use aggregates to create
        arrays of group IDs, instead of returning a separate row for each
        individual group ID. Since all story, media, and template objects
        are now returned in single rows instead of potentially many rows,
        this greatly cuts down on the overhead of fetching data from the
        database. Suggested by Josh Berkus. [David]

    <li>Thanks to the aggregation of group IDs into a single row for each
        story, media and template object, the <code>Offset</code> and <code>Limit</code>
        parameters to the <code>list()</code> methods of the story, media, and template
        (formatting) classes are now handled by the database back end,
        instead of in Perl space. This makes using these parameters much
        more efficient.

    <li>Added <code>get_element()</code> method to Bric::Biz::Asset::Business and
        deprecated the <code>get_tile()</code> method. This will make things a bit more
        consistent for template developers, at least. [David]

    <li>Added <code>primary_category_id</code> parameter to the story class' <code>list()</code>
        method. [David]

    <li>The list of output channels available to be included in an output
        channel now has the name of the site with which each is affiliated
        listed as well. This is to prevent confusion between output channels
        with the same names in different sites. [David]

    <li>The Contributor manager no longer presents a &quot;New&quot; link if the
        Contributor Type on which the contributor is based has no custom
        fields. This will prevent folks from creating new contributor roles
        in the UI only to find that Bricolage hasn't created them because
        there are no custom fields. [David]

    <li>In the formBuilder interface used by the Element and Contributor
        Type profiles, the maximum length of text and textarea fields is no
        &quot;0&quot;, or unlimited. [David]

    <li>When publishing from a publish desk, you can now uncheck related
        assets in order to not publish them. [Scott]

  </ul>
  <li>Bug Fixes</li>
  <ul>
    <li>The virtual FTP server now correctly creates a utility template when
        a template with an unknown name is uploaded. [David]

    <li>The virtual FTP server now pays proper attention to all permissions.
        [David]

    <li>A number of upgrade script annoyances were cleared up. [David]

    <li>The <code>simple</code> parameter to the Media class' <code>list()</code> method works
        again. As a result, so does &quot;Find Stories&quot; in the UI. [David]

    <li>Several Alert Type fixes. Rule regular expression matching (=~, !~)
        now handles patterns containing slashes (important for URIs, for
        example). Attributes no longer show up as stringified hash
        references in subject or message variable substitution.
        $trig_password was removed from the Profile as it caused an error
        and was useless anyway. And finally, duplicate and spurious
        attributes were removed from the rules and message variable lists.
        [Scott & David]

    <li>Fixed Template Element list, where container elements appeared
        twice. [Joao Pedro]

    <li>Changes to site settings are now correctly reflected in the UI for
        all users as soon as they are made. [David]

    <li>Autopopulated fields in media elements can once again have their
        values fetched in templates. This problem was due to bad key names
        being created for new image elements created after upgrading to
        1.7.0. [David]

    <li>The workflow profile no longer displays deactivated sites in the
        site select list. Thanks to Serge Sozonoff for the spot. [David]

    <li>Fixed URI uniqueness upgrade scripts, which were having problems
        with PostgreSQL permissions. [David]

    <li><code>make clone</code> works again. [David]

    <li>Distribution jobs can be edited via the UI again. Thanks to Marshall
        Roch for the spot. [David]

    <li>Publishes once again work when the &quot;Date/Time Format&quot; preference is
        set to something other than ISO-8601. Reported by Marshall Roch.
        [David]

    <li>Fixed previewing with multiple OCs. [Serge Sozonoff]

    <li>Fixed a bug in <code>bric_soap story create/update</code> caused by refactoring
        in version 1.7.0. Found by David during a demo. [Scott]

    <li>An attempt to preview a story for which no template exists now gives
        a friendly error message again. This was broken by the change in
        1.7.2 that made the Mason burner use document templates as true
        dhandlers. [Dave Rolsky]

    <li>The workflow menus in the side navigation layer no longer disappear
        after a server restart. Reported by Ben Bangert. [David]

    <li>The Mason burner's special <code>&lt;%publish&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;%preview&gt;</code>, and
        </code>&lt;%chk_syntax&gt;</code> tags now work as advertised. Reported by Ben
        Bangert. [David]
