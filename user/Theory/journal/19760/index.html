<div class="span8">
<p><p>The Bricolage development team is pleased to announce the release of Bricolage 1.8.1.
This maintenance release address a number of issues in Bricolage 1.8.0.
Here are the highlights:</p>

<h3>Improvements</h3>

<ul>
<li>More complete Traditional Chinese and Simplified Chinese
localizations. Also, the Mandarin localization now simply inherits from the
Traditional Chinese localization.</li>

<li><code>make clone</code> now copies the <em>lib</em> directory and all of the <em>bin</em> scripts from the target to the clone,
rather than from the sources.
This allows any changes that have been made to scripts and classes to be properly cloned.</li>

<li>When installing Bricolage,
it will now allow you to proceed if the database already exists by asking if you want to create the Bricolage tables in the existing database.
Suggested by Mark Fournier and Marshall Roch.</li>

<li>The installer is now a bit smarter in how it handles loading the
<code>log_config</code> (or <code>config_log</code>, as the case may be)
module.</li>

<li>Added language-specific style sheets.
This is especially useful for right-to-left languages or for languages that require special fonts.</li>

<li>The <q>New Alias</q> search interface now displays thumbnails when searching for media documents to alias and the <code>USE_THUMBNAILS</code> <em>bricolage.conf</em> directive is enabled.</li>

<li>Aliases can now be made to documents within the same site.</li>

<li>The SOAP interface for importing and exporting elements now properly has <q>key_name</q> XML elements instead of <q>name</q> XML elements.
The changes are backwards compatible with XML exported from Bricolage 1.8.0 servers,
however.</li>

<li>Added <code>move()</code> method to the virtual FTP interface.
This means that to deploy a template,
rather than having to rename it locally to append <q>.deploy</q>
one can simply move in FTP to its new name with <q>.deploy</q> on appended to the new name.</li>

<li>Document expirations are now somewhat more intelligent.
Rather than just scheduling an expiration job only if there is an expiration date the first time a document is published,
Bricolage will now always schedule an expiration job for a document provided that one does not already exist (scheduled or completed) for the same time and for one of the file resources for the document.
This should allow people to more easily and arbitrarily expire content whenever necessary.</li>

<li>Burner notes now persist for all sub burns (triggered by <code>publish_another()</code> and <code>preview_another()</code> in a single burn.</li>

<li>Added ability to create and manage groups of objects for several different types of objects.
Also added the ability manage group membership within the administrative profiles for those objects.
This change makes it possible to give users permission to administer subsets of objects.
The new groupable objects are:</li>

<ul>
<li>Preferences</li>

<li>Groups</li>

<li>Alert Types</li>

<li>Element Types</li>

<li>Keywords</li>

<li>Contributors</li>
</ul>

<li>Alert rules are now evaluated within a safe compartment (using Safe.pm) to prevent security exploits.</li>

<li>The Bulk Publish admin tool is no longer limited to use only by members of the Global Admins group.
Now anyone can use it.
All one needs is READ permission to the categories of stories,
and PUBLISH permission to the stories and media documents to be published.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>

<ul>
<li>Eliminated <q>Bareword &quot;ENABLE_HTMLAREA&quot; not allowed while &quot;strict subs&quot; in use</q> warning that prevented startup for some installations.</li>

<li>Changes made to user or contributor contacts without changing any other part of the user or contributor object are now properly saved.</li>

<li>The upgrade to 1.8.0 now correctly updates story URIs that use the URI Suffix of an output channel instead of using the URI Prefix twice.</li>

<li>Aliases of Image,
Audio,
or Video media documents no longer remain stuck on desks.</li>

<li>Related media and story subelements of media documents now work properly.</li>

<li>Calls to <code>preview_another()</code> in Bric::Util::Burner will now use any templates in the current user's sandbox and properly burn them to the preview root rather than to the staging root used for publishing.</li>

<li>Contributor fields for roles other than the default role now properly store and retain their values.</li>

<li>The virtual FTP server now properly checks out templates when a template is uploaded and is already in workflow.</li>

<li>Uploading a non-existent template via the virtual FTP server now correctly creates a new template.
The type of template depends on the name of the template being uploaded,
and for element templates,
on whether there is an element with the appropriate key name.
The user must have CREATE permission to All Templates or to the start desk in the first template workflow in the relevant site.</li>

<li>Reverting a document or template to the current version number now properly reverts all changes to the time the user checked out the document or template.
Reversion is also a bit more efficient in how it looks up the previous version in the database.</li>

<li>The SOAP server now rolls back any changes whenever an error is thrown.
This prevents problems when a few objects are created or updated before an exception is thrown.
Now any error will cause the entire SOAP request to fail.
Thanks to Neal Sofge for the spot!</li>
