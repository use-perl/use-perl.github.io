<p>I'm pleased to announce the release of Bricolage 1.6.9. This maintenance
release addresses a number issues discovered since the release of version
1.6.8. Here is the complete list of chnages for this release:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Fixed installation and upgrade scripts to use the same perl binary
        as was used to execute Makefile.PL. This ensures that all necessary
        CPAN modules will be correctly installed and located. [Simon Wilcox]</li>

  <li>Story profile JavaScript validation works again. Thanks to Simon
        Wilcox for the spot! [David]</li>

  <li>Eliminated the need for the Apache::ConfigFile module, and thus some
        annoying problems with the CPAN indexer when trying to install it.
        [David]</li>

  <li>Fixed order of SQL statement execution upon installation so that
        dependencies are properly handled. [Mark]</li>

  <li>New file resources created for distribution are now created with the
        proper media type. [Mark]</li>

  <li>The German localization module (Bric::Util::Language::de_de) had the
        wrong package name, which meant that attempts to use it failed with
        the error "Can't locate class method
        'Bric::Util::Language::de_de::new' via package
        'Bric::Util::Language::de_de'". [Dave Rolsky]</li>

  <li>Added new path to find PostgreSQL installed by some Debian packages.
        [Cinly Ooi]</li>

  <li>Workflows with special characters such as "+" and "&" now work
        properly in the side navigation. Thanks to Patrick Walsh for the
        spot! [David]</li>

  <li>Start desks can no longer be removed from workflows. This prevents
        workflows from having no desks, thus avoiding problems adding desks
        to such workflows. Reported by Patrick Walsh. [David]</li>

  <li>Pushing the cancel button in a desk profile and then in a workflow
        profile no longer redirects back to the desk profile. [David]</li>

  <li>Made publish_date not be empty when publish is done through the SOAP
        API and no publish_date argument is passed. [Scott]</li>

  <li>Fixed CPAN installer to correctly update the list of modules to be
        installed after a module has been successfully installed. Reported
        by Perrin Harkins. [David]</li>

  <li>Checkout checkboxes no longer appear for assets that users don't
        have permission to check out. Thanks to Alexander Ling for the spot!
        [David]</li>

  <li>Bric::Biz::AssetType::Parts::Data's "lookup()" method now returns
        deactivated objects, as it should. Thanks to Nuno Barreto for the
        spot. [David]</li>

  <li>Events with attributes with the same name as attributes of the
        object the event was triggered on (a common occurrence) no longer
        confuses the two. Thanks to Todd Tyree for the spot. [David]</li>

  <li>Users granted permission to access the members of a group via two
        user group associations now always get the highest priority
        permission, as it should be. Thanks to Patrick Walsh for the spot.
        [David]</li>

  <li>Textarea fields in elements no longer lose some of their default
        data after editing the field in the element manager. Reported by
        Todd Tyree. [David]</li>

  <li>Media assets now properly remember their class, which means that
        autopopulated fields (such as "height" and "width" for images) are
        autopopulated when a new image file is uploaded. Thanks to Patrick
        Walsh for the spot! [David]</li>

  <li>Updated Chinese Traditional localization. [Kang-min Liu]</li>
