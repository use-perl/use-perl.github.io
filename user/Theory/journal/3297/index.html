<p><a href="The&nbsp;Bricolage&nbsp;section&nbsp;of&nbsp;the&nbsp;Mason&nbsp;book&nbsp;is&nbsp;done."></a>

<p>I worked a lot over the weekend on the Bricolage section of the upcoming O'Reilly book on <a href="http://www.masonhq.com/">Mason</a>, and now it's done. I mean, it's a draft. Naturally, I'll want to go in and edit it again in a few weeks, once I have some distance from it.</p>

<p>Dave and Ken were kind enough to let me rewrite their section on content management, since for all intents and purposes Mason-CM appears to be dead, and Bricolage is quite actively maintained. I appreciate their allowing me to contribute -- I think this will be good for Mason <i>and</i> for Bricolage.</p>

<p>At any rate, after a busy couple of weeks, I'm ready to get back to plugging bugs in Bricolage and planning its future. I'm a bit behind. If I didn't have to spend so much time trying to hustle up work, it would help. Anyone want to hire an experienced Perl hacker and Bricolage developer?</p></p>

According to the Mason list, some people still use CM even though you are right about its maintenance level.<br/><br/>THe feeling I got from the Mason list is that CM is a much less complex program and preferable for some because it is easier to hack into and personalize.

<p>That's absolutely true. But the problem is that it's not being actively maintained. Bricolage, OTOH, is under very active development, and comes with a whole raft of features. But I would certainly agree that Bricolage overkill for some needs, and that Mason CM might be more appropriate for simpler situations.</p>

Well, without a maintainer, it's dead, plain and simple.  If people want to use it, great, but it'd silly for us to promote it in the book when there's a well-maintained and more modern system available.<br> <br>Plus when Mason 1.10 comes out I have a feeling the old Mason-CM code will _really_ be dead, because 1.10 will have a fair number of API changes and who knows whether Mason-CM will survive.<br> <br>It's worth noting that the MasonHQ site has a very minimal CM system as part of its code.  This CM-lite is loosely based on the old Mason-CM, and if someone extracted this from the rest of the site code it might make a nice Mason-CM replacement.
