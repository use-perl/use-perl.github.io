<p><a href="Getting&nbsp;closer&nbsp;to&nbsp;1.8.0"></a?

<p>It gives me great pleasure to announce the release of Bricolage-Devel 1.7.1,
the second development release for what will eventually become Bricolage
1.8.0. This version of the open-source content management system addresses
all of the bugs discovered since the release of the first development
release, 1.7.0. The most significant changes include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Eliminated the need for the Apache::ConfigFile module, and thus some
        annoying problems with the CPAN indexer when trying to install it.
        [David]</li>

  <li>Passwords can be changed again. [Mike Slattery]</li>

  <li>It is now virtually impossible to create media type or story type
        elements without site and output channel associations. This should
        eliminate errors when users try to create documents based on types
        without output channel associations. [David]</li>

  <li>The &quot;Output Channel&quot; item for templates on desks now displays
        properly. [David]</li>

  <li>Eliminated bogus &quot;Use of element's 'name' field is deprecated&quot;
        warnings. Key names are allowed to have digits and underscores, and
        we weren't consistent about that. [David]</li>

  <li>The <code>display_element()</code> method in the Mason burner once again passes
        component arguments on to components. And now, so does
        <code>sdisplay_element()</code>. [David]</li>

  <li>Fixed favicon.ico code so that the browser and server don't go into
        an infinite loop with redirects of redirects. The favicon.ico still
        doesn't pop up in the location field in my browser, but it does
        display properly if I point my browser at it. [David]</li>

  <li>An attempt to create a document with the same URI as an existing
        document no longer litters the database with broken stories. Thanks
        to Arthur for the spot. [David]</li>

  <li>Redirection after some publishes and previews works again, instead
        of returning a text page to the browser. [David]</li>

  <li>Now displaying the name of the site each story and media document is
        in in Find Stories and Find Media. Suggested by Arthur. [David]</li>

  <li>A number of fixes for the bric_media_upload contrib script:
    <ul>
       <li>Made it work with the 1.7.0 XML Schema.</li>
       <li>Fixed a bug in its use of File::Find.</li>
       <li>Fixed problem in calculating category names when given a directory
           to upload.</li>
       <li>Added <code>--bric_soap</code> and <code>--site</code> options.</li>
    </ul>

        See the script's usage info for details. [Dave Rolsky]</li>

  <li>Changing a media item's category and then saving caused an error.
        [Dave Rolsky]</li>

  <li>Changing a media document's cover date no longer causes the URI to
        disappear. Thanks to Dave Rolsky for the spot. [David]</li>

  <li>Attempting to preview a story for which there are no associated
        destinations no longer causes the error 'Can't call method &quot;ACCESS&quot;
        without a package or object reference'. Thanks to Earle Martin for
        the spot! [David]</li>

  <li>Added <code>output_channel_id</code> parameter to the <code>list()</code> method of
        Bric::Biz::Site in order to prevent sites without output channel
        associations from being listed in the select list for story type and
        media type elements. [David]</li>

  <li>When a document fails to publish because there are no destinations
        configured, the UI no longer displays a message saying that it was
        published. [David]</li>

  <li>Fixed page logging so that redirects to the page before the current
        page can work correctly. It was most noticeably broken when trying
        to associate a contributor with a document. [David]</li>

  <li>The upgrade process no longer moves media document files to where
        Bricolage can't find them. If this happened to you, just <code>mv
        $BRICOLAGE_ROOT/comp.old/data $BRICOLAGE_ROOT/comp</code>. [David]</li>

  <li>Performing an action in the contributor and category association
        interfaces in the story and media profiles no longer causes an empty
        search to be performed and return all contributors or categories.
        This could be a pain for organizations with 1000s of contributors or
        categories. Thanks to Scott for the report! [David]</li>

  <li>The Key Name field in the element profile is no longer editable.
        Only new elements can type in the key name field. Thanks to Arthur
        for the spot! [David]</li>

  <li>The Template toolkit burner now correctly uses element key names
        instead of names to find corresponding templates. [David]</li>

  <li>Management of user groups in a double list manager UI no longer
        causes an SQL error. Spotted by Alexander Ling. [David]</li>

  <li>Sites added to a site group will now be listed as members of the
        site group in the site group's profile. Thanks to Alexander Ling for
        the spot. [David]</li>

  <li>Improved permission checking in the virtual FTP server. [David]</li>

</ul>
