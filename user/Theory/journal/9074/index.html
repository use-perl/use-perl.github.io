<p><a href="Dreaming&nbsp;in&nbsp;C&nbsp;considered&nbsp;hazardous."></a>

<p>So last week, I decided it was finally time to put an end to my years-long
mental block and learn some C. Because I'm a crazy bastard, I decided to do so
by writing a new DBI driver for PostgreSQL. The existing PostgreSQL driver,
DBD::Pg, is a mess, and since it would be harder for me to just jump in and
start patching, I decided to follow the instructions in <a
href="http://search.cpan.org/author/TIMB/DBI/lib/DBI/DBD.pm">DBI::DBD</a> and
start cutting and pasting a brand new driver.</p>

<p>It's been a great experience for me so far, mostly because of the <a
href="http://archive.develooper.com/dbi-dev@perl.org/msg01731.html">tremendous
support</a> I've received from the denizens of the dbi-dev mail list. If it
wasn't for the great answers that so many of them have taken the time to
write, I would be getting more sleep at night, but wouldn't be learning half
as much, either!</p>

<p>Speaking of not sleeping, I was in Florida for a business meeting for one
night on Tuesday, and I sat up late with Comedy Central on, studying the
sources for DBD::ODBC, DBD::mysql, and DBD::Oracle, trying to wrap my brain
around the peculiarities of C and XS programming. I was completely absorbed in
what I was doing, and thinking a lot about how to parse SQL strings in C. I
finally went to bed around 3 am (it was only midnight my time, after all), but
lay awake for another hour, parsing SQL character arrays, moving pointers
around, trying to identify comments and literals. When I did sleep, I dreamed
in C.</p>

<p><i>What a nightmare.</i></p>

<p>Now, when I was first <i>really</i> learning Perl, and working very
intently in it for hours and days at a time, trying to grok what I was seeing,
it was a wondrous path of discovery. Perl is such a rewarding language to
learn; it thinks like I think. I even had a few dreams in Perl. Its
expressiveness was enjoyable in my dreams. I could communicate in Perl.</p>

<p>Not so with C. In my C dreams, things were rigid and structured, and didn't
always seem so consistent. I was just parsing, parsing, parsing character
arrays all night, and desperately needing a good regex to do the job for me.
Needless to say, I didn't sleep well.</p>

<p>I'm going to continue working on my new PostgreSQL driver. I want to make
it a top-notch DBI driver implementation. It's going to take me a few months,
but I look forward to the rewards. But, I think, I shan't be working on it
quite so intensely just before turning in late at night any more, especially
on those nights when I have to get up in only three hours.</p>
</p>

I've experienced the same.  Dreaming in C *sucks*.  A couple of weeks ago while porting Mac::Carbon, I was dreaming in XS.  It's a wonder I can still bring myself to use a computer.
