<p>&quot;This will go down in [my] permanent record,&quot; eh? I guess I'd better make it good.</p>

<p>There's been quite the <a href="http://www.geocrawler.com/mail/thread.php3?subject=%5BBricolage-Devel%5D+More+on+Releases&list=15308">debate</a> going on over on the Bricolage developers list. For those who don't know about Bricolage, its a full-featured, open-source, 100% Perl content management system that I maintain on SourceForge. You can learn more abou it <a href="http://bricolage.thepirtgroup.com/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Anyway, the debate is over the art and science of CVS management. We've been adding features to both minor and major releases up to now, but there has been substantial argument that the minor releases should be bug-fix only. The advantage of this approach is that new code won't threaten stable releases. The disadvantage is that it could slow development. Quick and easy new features will have to wait for more involved features to be complete before they can see the light of day of a release.</p>

<p>There are some strong opinions, but I'm currently sitting on the fence. More opinions are welcome!</p></p>

<h2>CVS Best Practices</h2>

Sorry this is such a late reply... but after your journal entry pointed to your website, and there I saw a CVS link, and I am the cvs guy at my job, I thought I'd read it. Anyway, enough of that tangent. Here goes.<br> <br> <a href="http://www.tldp.org/REF/CVS-BestPractices/html/" title="tldp.org">CVS Best Practices</a tldp.org> is something you probably already have read. If not, I highly recommend it. As I am writting this, I notice it is not version 1.4, and last I read it was 1.3, so it is a working document.<br> <br>Also, I found the <a href="http://www.cmcrossroads.com/bradapp/acme/" title="cmcrossroads.com">A.C.M.E.</a cmcrossroads.com> website helpful. A.C.M.E. stands for Assembling Configuration Management Environments (for Software Development). Most of this stuff is theory, since "Configuration Management" is usualy a set of tools, and not one huge utility (unless you count ClearCase, but that is a beast left elsewhere).<br> <br>At my job I think we are going to go with the branch per release, and fix a bug on a release, and then merge back into the HEAD (unless the bug does not exist in the HEAD branch). The actual process is not in place, and only a small set of developers are using CVS, since we have some old legacy in house CM type system, that just reaks of problems (and has been demostrated to have a ton of them). And there are a bunch of other little balls of wax I won't go into.<br> <br>Best of luck.

<p>Thanks for the comments, exeunt. I'm not really doing much CVS management these days. I ultimately made a decision, we went with it, and it's working pretty well. I imagine that if I get back into the fray, I'll be checking out your links.</p>
