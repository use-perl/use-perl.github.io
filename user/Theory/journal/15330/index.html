<p><a href="Well&nbsp;on&nbsp;our&nbsp;way&nbsp;to&nbsp;1.8.0!"></a>

<p>It give me great pleasure to announce the release of Bricolage-Devel 1.7.0,
the first development release for what will eventually become Bricolage
1.8.0. In addition to all of the bug fixes included in the 1.6.x series,
this version of the open-source content management system adds a number of
significant new features. The most significant changes include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Added multisite support. Now all stories, media, output channels,
        templates, categories, and workflows may be associated with
        different sites, and even have the same names in different sites.
        This simplifies the management of multiple Web sites with Bricolage.
        Story type and media type elements may be shared between sites.
        Funded by Portugal Telecom Multimedia.</li>

<li>Added document aliasing. Stories and media in a site may now be
        aliased and published in another site, as long as the elements on
        which they are based are shared between sites. Control over the
        content of aliased documents remains in the original site, thus
        ensuring the editorial integrity of the document for that site.
        Funded by Portugal Telecom Multimedia.</li>

<li>Added <code>$burner->sdisplay_element</code> method to Bric::Util::Burner. This
        is a <code>sprintf</code>-style version of <code>$burner->display_element</code>.</li>

<li>Added the <code>YEAR_SPAN_BEFORE</code> and <code>YEAR_SPAN_AFTER</code> bricolage.conf
        directives. These directives enable control how many years before
        and after the current year to display in the list of years in the
        date and time select widget. The default values are 10 for each,
        meaning that if the current year is 2003, then the date span will be
        from 1993 to 2013.</li>

<li>Added &quot;Email&quot; action, which can be used to email the files generated
        by a publish to one or more email addresses. Funded by ETonline.</li>

<li>Callbacks were moved from Mason components to modules based on
        Params::Callback and managed by MasonX::Interp::WithCallbacks. This
        makes the UI layer more responsive and enhances maintainability.</li>

<li>Optimized performance of URI uniqueness checks by adding database
        tables to do the job, rather than constructing the URIs for all
        other documents in the same categories as the document being
        checked. This was the last major bottleneck affecting SOAP
        performance, as well as document editing in general. Funded by
        Kineticode.</li>

<li>Added <code>output_channel_id</code> parameter to the <code>list()</code> methods of Story
        and Media to enable querying for documents in output channels other
        than the primary output channel.</li>

<li>Added Keyword Management interface to centrally manage keywords.</li>

<li>Added HTML::Mason Custom tags support, allowing template developers
        to write code blocks that are context sensitive.</li>

<li>Added new page extension support to the burner, which allows
        template developers to set string extensions to use for successive
        file names, rather than the traditional use of numeric file name
        extensions for successive file names.</li>

<li>Added &quot;Text to search&quot; option in the Advanced search of Media and
        Stories to search for documents based on the contents of their
        field.</li>

<li>All preview links are now generated by a single widget. This widget
        adds the story or media URI to the <code>title</code> attribute of the link tag
        (which is modern browsers will automatically work as a roll-over
        tooltip), makes the story or media URI copyable (by relying on
        JavaScript to actually open a new window for the preview), and
        manages selecting an output channel in which to preview a story.</li>

<li>Made User Group Permissions UI wieldy with larger numbers of users
        by adding a select list to choose which type of Permission to look
        at.</li>

<li>Added <code>contrib_id</code> parameter to the <code>list()</code> methods of
        Bric::Biz::Asset::Business::Story and
        Bric::Biz::Asset::Business::Media to return a list of story or media
        documents associated with a given contributor.</li>

<li>Switched Bric::Util::CharTrans from using Text::Iconv to Encode,
        thus removing the dependency on a C library (libiconv). Note that
        this has changed the API of Bric::Util::CharTrans. Its <code>to_utf8()</code>
        and <code>from_utf8()</code> methods now always convert the argument passed in
        in place. They did this before for references, but now they do it
        for plain strings, as well. Also note that use of character
        translation also now requires Perl 5.8.0 or later.</li>

<li>Added MediaType, Site, and Keyword SOAP modules.</li>

<li>Added <code>element</code> attribute to Bric::Util::Burner so that
        <code>$burner->get_element</code> should always return the element currently
        being burned.</li>

<li>Added a <code>throw_error()</code> method to Bric::Util::Burner so that
        template developers can easily throw an exception that their users
        will see in the UI.</li>

<li>Moved category selection from Media and Story Profiles into their
        own separate components so that organizations with hundreds or
        thousands of categories don't have to load them into a dropdown list
        every time an asset is edited. The category &quot;browser&quot; uses an
        interface similar to 'Associate Contributors', which has the
        advantage of being searchable rather than looking through a &quot;long
        list of all categories&quot;. This feature can be enabled via the new
        <code>ENABLE_CATEGORY_BROWSER</code> bricolage.conf directive.</li>

<li>Added list paging to Desks and My Workspace.</li>

<li>Added the ability to test templates without having to deploy them by
        using &quot;template sandboxes&quot; for each template developer.</li>

<li>Added Template Toolkit burner support.</li>

<li>Added support for installing and upgrading Bricolage with PostgreSQL
        on a separate host.</li>

<li>Added context-sensitive help for pages that were missing it.</li>
