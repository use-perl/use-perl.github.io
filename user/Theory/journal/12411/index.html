<p>IT-Director.com has published an article, <a href="http://www.it-director.com/article.php?articleid=10868">Open Source Content Management arrives</a>, in which Bricolage is the only content management system mentioned:</p>

<blockquote><p><i>However as these software applications mature and lose their uniqueness, they become candidates for the open source movement. In the case of content management, a number of open source contenders are emerging but <a href="http://www.bricolage.cc/">Bricolage</a>, in particular, stands out in terms of capability.</i></p>

<p><i>Bricolage is an actively developed content management system with a browser-based interface. It has most of the features you would expect from a full-featured content management system, including distributed authoring of content, workflow and support for user roles and groups. The product was built to run Salon.com. Visiting this site gives a useful and interesting demonstration of its capabilities.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>The interesting thing is that if you follow the link for the author, Martin Langham, you'll see that he works for a company called Bloor Research, and is working on a Report to be published in December for UKÃÂ£296 (US$467 / Ã¢âÂ¬438) all about content management. The upshot is that it's great that a research firm says that 1) Open-source CMS is coming into its own; 2) Bricolage is the standout in that field; 3) No other open-source CMS is mentioned; and 4) they're publishing an Content Management report. This makes me think that Bricolage could fare very well indeed when that report comes out. It would be interesting to see.</p>
