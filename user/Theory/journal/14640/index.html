<p>I'm pleased to announce announce the release of Bricolage 1.6.5.
This maintenance release addresses a number issues discovered since
the release of version 1.6.4. Some of the more important changes
include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Previewing stories with related media that have no associated file
        no longer causes an error.</li>

  <li>Switched to using <code>DBI->connect_cached()</code> from using our own
        database connection caching. This change does bump up the minimum
        required version of DBI to 1.18, though the latest version is always
        recommended. It's also the right thing to do.</li>

  <li>Fixed issue that could cause Bric::Util::DBI to create inconsistent
        transaction states.</li>

  <li>Passing an undef via the <code>workflow__id</code> parameters to
        the <code>list()</code> method of Story, Media, or Template really
        does again cause Bricolage to correctly return only those assets that
        are not in workflow. It wasn't as fixed in 1.6.3 as I had
        thought.</li>

  <li>Vastly improved the speed of the query that lists events, and added
        an index to help it along, as well.</li>

  <li>The FTP mover now properly deletes files rather than erroring out.</li>

  <li>Users without EDIT access to the start desk in a workflow can no
        longer create assets in that workflow. Nor can they check out assets
        from the library, as there's no start desk for them to check them in
        to. But they can still check them out from other desks that they
        have EDIT access to.</li>

  <li>Time zone issues have been fixed to be more portable. Some platforms
        that experienced Bricolage unexpectedly shifting cover dates and
        other dates and times by several hours should no longer see this
        problem.</li>

  <li>Adding a new element type with the same name as an existing or
        deleted element type no longer causes an SQL error.</li>
</ul>

<p>For a complete list of the changes, see the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/shownotes.php?release_id=183771">changes file</a>.</p>
