<p><a href="Masive&nbsp;performance&nbsp;improvements&nbsp;abound."></a>

<p>I'm thrilled to announce the release of Bricolage-Devel 1.7.2, the third
development release for what will eventually become Bricolage 1.8.0. This
version of the open-source content management system addresses all of the bugs
discovered since the release of the second development release, 1.7.1, and
adds several new features and some tremendous performance optimizations. The
most significant changes since 1.7.1 include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>New Features</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Bricolage now has a much more robust security policy. Users with
        permission to edit various objects and groups in the administrative
        interface can no longer increase their permissions. Nor can they
        manage the membership of groups of which they are not members or do
        not have EDIT access to the members. All this is to prevent users
        from giving themselves higher permissions. [David]</li>

    <li>Added "publish_another()" method to Bric::Util::Burner. This method
        publishes a document other than the one currently being published.
        This is useful when a template for one document type needs to
        trigger the publish of another document. [David]</li>

    <li>Added new permissions "RECALL" and "PUBLISH". These permissions
        apply only to asset groups, including desks, categories, and
        workflows. Now users must have RECALL permission to recall assets
        from the library and bring them into workflow, and PUBLISH
        permission to publish assets. This should make it much easier to
        create more flexible permissions to manage approval processes.
        [David]</li>

    <li>Bricolage now supports per-user preferences. Admins can mark a
        preference as overrideable, which allows users to set this
        preference to their preferred value. [Dave Rolsky]</li>

    <li>The character set and language preferences have been moved into the
        database, so that these can be overridden by individual users if
        needed. [Dave Rolsky]</li>

    <li>Added the "bric_queued" daemon to take advantage of the new
        publication scheduling of Bric::Util::Job::Pub. Together with the
        use of a carefully tuned instance of Bricolage, these new features
        allows the Bricolage administrator to control the amount of system
        resources given over to publishing. [Mark]</li>

    <li>German localization completed. [Thorsten Biel]</li>

    <li>Added User and Desk (asset) modules to the SOAP API, added asset
        commands to the Workflow module, and made corresponding changes to
        bric_soap. [Scott]</li>

    <li>Added "burn_again" attribute to the Mason burner. This method can be
        called from within a template to force the burner to burn the
        current page again, creating a new file. This can be useful for
        creating multi-file output without extra paginated subelements.
        [David]</li>

    <li>Added zh-cn localization, with translation based on zh-tw. [Kang-min
        Liu]</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Improvements</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Fixed upgrade scripts to be more intelligent in their handling of
        transactions. They no longer allow SQL errors without failing the
        upgrade. The upgrade scripts have also been updated to ensure
        successful upgrades to Bricolage installations as far back as 1.4.0.
        [David]</li>

    <li>Added "element_key_name" parameter to the "list()" method of the
        story, media, and formatting classes. This makes it easier to use
        the name of a story type element, media type element, or template
        element to search for assets, rather than the "element__id"
        parameter, which isn't as friendly. [David]</li>

    <li>Added "Filter by Site Context" preference. When active, search
        results only return assets relative to the site context instead of
        all the sites the user has access to [JoÃ¢â¬Å¾o Pedro]</li>

    <li>The Mason burner now uses document templates as true dhandlers,
        enabling full Mason-style inheritance from autohandlers to work
        properly. [David & Dave Rolsky]</li>

    <li>"All *" groups can now be accessed via the Group Manager. Their
        names and memberships cannot be edited, but their permissions can.
        Inspired by a bug report from Patrick Walsh. [David]</li>

    <li>Queries for stories, media, and templates have been greatly
        optimized. Thanks to a large database from *The Register* and query
        optimization from Josh Berkus (under sponsorship from WHO) and Simon
        Myers of GBDirect, searches for stories in the UI are now 10-40
        times faster than they were before (depending on the version of
        PostgreSQL you're running). [David]</li>

    <li>Added the "story.category" parameter to the "list()" method of
        Bric::Biz::Asset::Business::Story. Pass in a story ID, and a list of
        stories in the same categories as the story with that ID will be
        returned, minus the story with that ID. This parameter triggers a
        complex join, which can slow the query time significantly on
        underpowered servers or systems with a large number of stories.
        Still, it can be very useful in templates that want to create a list
        of stories in all of the categories the current story is in. But be
        sure to use the <Limit> parameter! Thanks to Josh Berkus for his
        help figuring out the query syntax. [David]</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Bug Fixes</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Category groups can be edited again. Reported by Alexander Ling.
        [David]</li>

    <li>Elements can be edited again. Thanks to Alexander Ling for the spot!
        [David]</li>

    <li>Element fields can be edited again without encountering the "called
        the removed method 'get_name'" error. Reported by Alexander Ling.
        [David]</li>

    <li>Templates can be deleted again. Thanks to Adeola Awoyemi for the
        spot! [David]</li>

    <li>Stories and media with non-unique URIs can now be deleted. Reported
        by Simon Wilcox. [David]</li>

    <li>Checkin and Publish once again works in the media profile. Thanks to
        Alexander Ling for the spot. [David]</li>

    <li>The inline "Bulk Edit" feature in story and media profiles works
        again. Thanks to Neal Sofge for the spot! [David]</li>

    <li>Templates are now correctly saved to the user's sandbox when "Save
        and Stay" is pressed. [JoÃ¢â¬Å¾o Pedro]</li>

    <li>Select lists now correctly save their states so that, for example,
        dropdown menus in New Story remember the element and category that
        was selected last time. [Scott]</li>

    <li>Sites can now be disassociated with elements. Reported by Alexander
        Ling. [David]</li>

    <li>Redirects during previews work again. [David]</li>

    <li>The virtual FTP server works again for the first time since before
        the release of 1.7.0. Now when you log in to the FTP server, the
        root directory will contain a list of sites. When you change
        directories into one of the site directories, you'll see a list of
        the output channels in that site. [David]</li>

    <li>The virtual FTP server no longer displays output channels or
        categories (or sites) that the user does not have at least READ
        permission to access. [David]</li>
  </ul>
