<p><a href="It's&nbsp;all&nbsp;good."></a>

<p>There's been a fair bit of press coverage of Bricolage lately, which, since it's all positive, is very satisfying. In addition to <a href="http://www.it-director.com/article.php?articleid=10868">the article</a> in <cite><a href="http://www.it-director.com/">IT-Director.com</a></cite> that I mentioned a week ago, a new article, &quot;<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/31/30959.html"><cite>The Register</cite> signs up for Bricolage,</a>&quot; appeared today in -- where else? -- <cite><a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/">The Register</a></cite>. They write:</p>

<blockquote><i>
<p>More than 30 companies contacted us with a view to pitching. Thanks guys, but we have made our CMS decision. Step forward Bricolage.</p>

<p>It's powerful, it's flexible, it's a perfect fit for the content we currently handle and the kind of content we want to handle in the future. As a bonus, Bricolage is open source, which we like.</p>
</i></blockquote>

<p>An article also appeared in <cite><a href="http://www.intranetjournal.com/">Intranet Journal</a></cite>, entitled &quot:<a href="http://www.intranetjournal.com/articles/200305/ij_05_05_03a.html">Faster, More Flexible Bricolage Challenges CM Vendors</a>&quot; There Michael Pastore observes:</p>

<blockquote><i>
<p>The acceptance of Linux as a viable OS in the enterprise has opened some doors for open-source enterprise applications, and in the Web content management space there has been a decent amount of buzz surrounding Bricolage.</p>
</i></blockquote>

<p>It turns out that Pastore also talked to Jupiter Communications about Bricolage:</p>

<blockquote><i>
<p>Matthew Berk, senior analyst for site technologies and operations at Jupiter Research, said Bricolage is one of the open-source projects that has proved to be a black eye for high-end content management vendors. (Jupiter Research is a division of Jupitermedia, the publisher of this Web site.)

<p>&quot;[Bricolage] is one of the first projects to claim that 'Hey, this stuff that Vignette said is rocket science, isn't,'&quot; Berk said. According to research done by Jupiter, eight out of 10 companies surveyed can meet their content management requirements with an open-source system.</p>
</i></blockquote>

<p>I'm pleased that the big IT analyst firms are paying attention to Bricolage. The success of Bricolage at well-known enterprises such as <a href="http://www.macworld.com/">Macworld Magazine</a>, <a href="http://maccentral.macworld.com/">MacCentral</a>, <a href="http://www.who.int/">The World Health Organization</a> and The Reg have caused so many in the industry to sit up and take notice. It's great for open source, for Perl, and hopefully for my business, too.</p>

<p>Speaking of Kineticode, I should also point out that we've not launched a series of <a href="http://kineticode.com/services/index1.html">Bricolage support plans</a>. We hope that these will help to keep steady revenues coming to Kineticode, as well as to validate Bricolage as a product. Wish us luck!</p>

<p>The Register likes to boast about its mini "slashdot effect" - since that article have you seen more traffic on the Bricolage webserver? More usefully, has Kineticode seen more traffic?</p>

<p>Interestingly enough, the Bricolage site didn't get as big a spike as it did when the first Bricolage article was published in The Register on the 23 (syndicated from Bloor Research's IT-Director.com). You can see a nice chart <a href="https://sourceforge.net/project/stats/index.php?report=last_30&amp;group_id=34789" title="sourceforge.net">here</a sourceforge.net> (date sensitive, so look at it now). It has been consistently much higher since then, however.</p>

The Kineticode site got a lot more hits, too. It's a much newer site, and we've typically been getting a couple of 100-200 page requests per day. But on May 23 (the day of the IT-Director.com article), we got over 500 page requests, and on May 30 (the day of the Register article), we got over 2400 page requests. Interestingly, the number of page requests stayed higher over the weekend, too, with over 700 on Saturday and over 700 on Sunday. I wonder how it'll look going forward? I need to get the site off my DSL before Slashdot actually <i>does</i> pick up the story!

<p>I guess the next newsworthy event that could get slashdotted is when The Register actually rolls out Bricolage. (I did get that right - they're still building up to that?). I'd be very surprised if they missed a second chance to crow about themselves.</p>
<p>Hmm, can a vulture crow without having an identity crisis?</p>

<p>Yes, that's correct, they're currently working on it, and the launch will be a big event that they'll crow about. There might be some other stuff in the interim, too.</p>.

<blockquote><div> <i>Hmm, can a vulture crow without having an identity crisis?</i> </div></blockquote>

<p>Perhaps not, but they're already out on a limb with the vulture stuff, since AFAIK there are no vultures in England at all, save perhaps in zoos. Maybe it's a stuffed vulture?</p>

<p>Why let the truth get in the way of a good story?</p>
