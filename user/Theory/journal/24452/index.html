<div class="span8">
<p><p>I'm pleased to announce the third alpha release of TestSimple, the port of
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Test-Simple/" title="Test::Simple and
friends on CPAN">Test::Builder, Test::Simple, and Test::More</a> to
JavaScript. You can download
it <a href="http://www.justatheory.com/downloads/TestSimple-0.03.tar.gz"
title="Download TestSimple 0.03 now!">here</a>. This release has the following
changes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Removed trailing commas from 3 arrays, since IE6/Win doesn't like
  them. And now everything works in IE. Thanks to Marshall Roch for tracking
  down and nailing this problem.</li>
  <li><code>isNum()</code> and <code>isntNum()</code> in TestBuilder.js now
  properly convert values to numbers using the global Number() function.</li>
  <li>CurrentTest is now properly initialized to 0 when creating a new
  TestBuilder object.</li>
  <li>Values passed to <code>like()</code> and <code>unlike()</code> that are
  not strings now always fail to match the regular expression.</li>
  <li><code>plan()</code> now outputs better error messages.</li>
  <li><code>isDeeply()</code> now works better with circular and repeating
  references.</li>
  <li><code>diag()</code> is now smarter about converting objects to strings
  before outputting them.</li>
  <li>Changed isEq() and isntEq() to use simple equivalence checks
  (<code>==</code> and <code>!=</code>, respectively) instead of stringified
  comparisons, as the equivalence checks are more generally
  useful. Use <code>cmpOk(got, &quot;eq&quot;, expect)</code> to explicitly
  compare stringified versions of values.</li>
  <li>TestBuilder.create() now properly returns a new TestBuilder object
  instead of the singleton.</li>
  <li>The <code>useNumbers()</code>, <code>noHeader()</code>,
  and <code>noEnding()</code> accessors will now properly assign a non-null
  value passed to them.</li>
  <li>The arrays returned from <code>summary()</code>
  and <code>details()</code> now have the appropriate structures.</li>
  <li><code>diag()</code> now always properly adds a <q>#</q> character after
  newlines.</li>
  <li>Added <code>output()</code>, <code>failureOutput()</code>,
  <code>todoOutput()</code>, <code>warnOutput()</code>,
  and <code>endOutput()</code> to TestBuilder to set up function reference to
  which to send output for various purposes. The first three each default
  to <code>document.write</code>, while <code>warnOutput()</code> defaults to
  <code>window.alert</code> and <code>endOutout()</code> defaults to the
  <code>appendData</code> function of a text element inside an element with
  the ID <q>test</q> or, failing that, <code>window.write</code>.</li>
  <li><code>todo()</code> and <code>todoSkip()</code> now properly add <q>#</q>
  after all newlines in their messages.</li>
  <li>Fixed line ending escapes in diagnostics to be platform-independent. Bug
  reported by Marshall Roch.</li>
  <li>Ported about a third of the tests from Test::Simple (which is how I
  caught most of the above issues). The remaining test from Test::Simple will
  be ported for the next release.</li>
</ul>

<p>Many thanks to <a href="http://www.spastically.com/"
title="Spastically">Marshall Roch</a> for help debugging issues in IE.</p>

<p>Now, there is one outstanding issue I'd like to address before I would
consider this production ready (aside from porting all the remaining tests
from Test::Simple): how to harness the output. Harnessing breaks down into a
number of issues:</p>

<p>How to run all tests in a single window. I might be able to write a build
script that builds a single HTML file that includes all the other HTML files
in iframes or some such. But then will each run in its own space without
stomping on the others? And how would the harness pull in the results of each?
It might be able to go into each of its children and grab the resultsfrom the
TestBuilder objects...
</p>

<p>More Feedback/advice/insults welcome!</p>

<h2>Purpose?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/n1vux/">n1vux</a> on 2005-04-30T01:16:19</h3>
This looks potentially useful, but I'm unsure for what.

<p> Since <b>Perl</b> Test::Simple/Test::Builder is generally considered a Unit Testing framework (<i>although it can be (ab)used as a Integration-Regression engine as well</i>), and <b>JavaScript</b> (or ECMA Script) runs in a <b>Browser</b> that is usually deeply connected, I'm missing a contextual leap here.
</p> <p>
I could really use a link to a web page describing the purpose and scope of the TestSimple JavaScript port.  All the posts on <a href="http://www.justatheory.com/computers/programming/javascript/" title="justatheory.com">Just A Theory</a justatheory.com> and <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/Theory" title="perl.org">here</a perl.org> are "Implementor's Doc", change-lists of what's implemented/fixed from your point of view. If there's a "Project Homepage", it's not linked.


</p> <ul>
<li> Is the point to integration test the whole distributed front-ends of applications from the (EcmaScript compliant) browser?
</li> <li> Or to unit test the client-side java-script as an entity, mocking the server??
</li> <li> Or is the point to Unit test JavaScript functions in the browser <i>in vitro</i>, mocking everything outside the current function?
</li> <li>Or is this for Unit Testing of the Presentation Layer on the server from the Brtowser? (If so, how can a JavaScript arrange to Mock the Model layer?)

</li> <li>Or is it more likely for driving Integration Testing from the browser with the scripting simplicity we've come to love, without resorting to OLE-stuffing the browser from Perl?
</li> </ul>

Digging into the TAR file (<i>which I normally wouldn't do before peaking at the web copy of the POD2HTML's</i>) I think I understand it's for <b>unit-testing JavaScript classes</b>, which I hadn't even considered. (<i>JavaScript has classes that fancy? *shudder* no wonder pages don't work between browser versions.</i>) I hope I don't need to do that.
<p> <b>How much of the other items above could I do with it, if any?</b> </p>

<p>Bill,</p>

<p>Apologies for the delayed reply. I've been busy with other things for the last few days.</p>

<p>I thought that your questions were important enough that I wrote a <a href="http://www.justatheory.com/computers/programming/javascript/test_simple_purpose.html" title="justatheory.com">separate post</a justatheory.com> to address them.</p>

Thanks, I'll check it out.
