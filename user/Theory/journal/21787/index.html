<p><p>The Bricolage development team is pleased to announce the release of Bricolage
1.8.3. This maintenance release addresses a number of issues in Bricolage
1.8.2. The most important changes eliminate or greatly reduce the number of
deadlocks caused during bulk publishes of many documents. Other changes
include new contributed scripts for importing contributors and for generating
thumbnail images, Russian localization, and various fixes for database
transaction, template formatting, and various user interface fixes. Here are
the other highlights of this release:</p>

<h3>Improvements</h3>

<ul>
<li>Added <em>contrib/thumbnails/precreate-thumbs.pl</em> script to pre-create
thumbnails from images. Useful for upgraders. [Scott]</li>

<li>Added <em>contrib/bric_import_contribs</em> to import contributors from a
tab-delimited file. Development by Kineticode, sponsored by the RAND
Corporation. [David]</li>

<li>Added the <code>published_version</code> parameter to
the <code>list()</code> methods of the story, media, and template
classes. This parameter forces the search to return the versions of the assets
as they were last published, rather than the most recent version. This will be
most useful to those looking up other documents in templates and publishing
them, as a way of avoiding pulling documents out from other anyone who might
have them checked out! [David]</li>

<li>All publishing and distribution jobs are now executed in their own
transactions when they are triggered by the user interface. This is to reduce
the chances of a deadlock between long-running publishing
transactions. [David]</li>

<li>Optimized SQL queries for key names or that order by string values to use
indexes in the <code>list()</code> and <code>list_ids()</code> methods of the
story, media, and template classes. [David]</li>

<li>Added Russian localization.
[Sergey Samoilenko].</li>

<li>Changed the foreign keys in the story, media, and formatting (template)
tables so that <code>DELETE</code>s do not cascade, but are restricted. This
means that before deleting any source, element, site, workflow, or other
related object that has a foreign key reference in an asset table, those rows
must be deleted. Otherwise, PostgreSQL will throw an exception. Hopefully,
this will put a stop to the mysterious but very rare disappearance of stories
from Bricolage. [David]</li>

<li>A call to <code>$burner-&gt;burn_another</code> in a template that passes
in a date/time string in the future now causes a publish job to be scheduled
for that time, rather than immediate burning the document and then scheduling
the distribution to take place in the future. Reported by Ashlee
Caul. [David]</li>

<li>Changing the sort order of a list of items in a search interface now
properly reverses the entire collection of object over the pages, rather than
just the objects for the current page. Thanks to Marshall for the spot!
[David]</li>
</ul>

<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>

<ul>
<li>Publishing stories not in workflow via the SOAP server works again.
[David]</li>

<li>The Burner object&#x2019;s <code>encoding</code> attribute is now setable
as well as readable. [David]</li>

<li>The category browser works again. [David]</li>

<li>Fixed Media Upload bug where the full local path was being used, by adding
a <q>winxp</q> key to Bric::Util::Trans::FS to account for an update to
HTTP::BrowserDetect. [Mark Kennedy]</li>

<li>Instances of a required custom field in story elements is no longer
required once it has been deleted from the element definition in the element
manager. Reported by Rod Taylor. [David]</li>

<li>A false value passed to the <code>checked_out</code> parameter of
the <code>list()</code> and <code>list_ids()</code> methods of the story,
media, and template (formatting) classes now properly returns only objects or
IDs for assets that are not checked out. [David]</li>

<li>The cover date select widget now works properly in the clone interface
when a non-ISO style date preference is selected. Thanks to Susan G. for the
spot! [David]</li>

<li>Sorting templates based on Asset Type (Element) no longer causes an
error. [David]</li>

<li>Fixed a number of the callbacks in the story, media, and template profiles
so that they didn&#x2019;t clear out the session before other callbacks were
done with it. Most often seen as the error <q>Can&#x2019;t call
method <q>get_tiles</q> on an undefined value</q> in the media profile,
especially with IE/Windows (for some unknown reason). Reported by Ed
Stevenson. [David]</li>

<li>Fixed typo in clone page that caused all output channels to be listed
rather than only those associated with the element itself. [Scott]</li>

<li>Fixed double listing of the <q>All</q> group in the group membership
double list manager. [Christian Hauser]</li>

<li>Image buttons now correctly execute the <code>onsubmit()</code> method for
forms that define an <code>onsubmit</code> attribute. This means that, among
other things, changes to a group profile will persist when you click
the <q>Permissions</q> button. [David]</li>

<li>Simple search now works when it is selected when the <q>Default Search</q>
preference is set to <q>Advanced</q>. Reported by Marshall Roch. [David]</li>

<li>Multiple alert types set up to trigger alerts for the same event will now
all properly execute. Thanks to Christian Hauser for the spot! [David]</li>

<li>Publishing stories or media via SOAP with the <code>published_only</code>
parameter (<code>--published-only</code> for <em>bric_republish</em>) now
correctly republishes the published versions of documents even if the current
version is in workflow. Reported by Adam Rinehart. [David]</li>

<li>Users granted a permission greater than READ to the members of the <q>All
Users</q> group no longer get such permission to any members of the <q>Global
Admins</q> group unless they have specifically been granted such permission to
the members of the <q>Global Admins</q> group. Thanks to Marshall Roch for the
spot! [David]</li>
