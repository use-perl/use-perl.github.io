<p><a href="Expect&nbsp;1.8.0&nbsp;in&nbsp;two&nbsp;weeks."></a>

<p>I'm thrilled to announce the release of Bricolage-Devel 1.7.5 &quot;Ashland&quot;, the
second release candidate for Bricolage 1.8.0. This version of the open-source
content management system addresses all of the bugs discovered since the
release of the first release candidate, 1.7.4, and adds several new features
and numerous improvements. The changes since 1.7.4 include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>New Features</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Added bric_template_dump to contrib. This script uses the Bricolage
        SOAP server to export all of the templates in a single output
        channel. [David]</li>

    <li>Added <code>SFTP_MOVER_CIPHER</code> bricolage.conf directive to tune the SFTP
        mover (if enabled) to the best cipher for good performance on the
        wire. [David]</li>

  </ul>
  <li>Improvements</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Added site and output channel support to bric_template_diff and
        bric_template_patch in contrib. [David]</li>

    <li>When cloning a story, you can now select a new primary output
        channel, in addition to category, slug, cover date, etc. Suggested
        by Serge Sozonoff. [David]</li>

    <li>Spell checking now works in HTMLArea. [Eric Sellers]</li>

    <li>When creating a new story without a slug, Bricolage will now
        autogenerate a slug based on the title. [Jo&atilde;o Pedro]</li>

    <li>Added single underscore parameters to the <code>list()</code> methods of the
        Story, Media, and Template classes to complement those that have the
        awful double underscores. [David]</li>

    <li>Made SOAP modules more tolerant of lack of sites in 1.6. [Scott]</li>

    <li>The collection API now checks newly added members when deleting
        members. This ensures that newly added objects won't be saved to the
        database if they are deleted, first. [David]</li>

    <li>Turned off browser autocompletion in the Server and User profiles.
        This prevents some browsers (e.g., Camino) from filling in your
        username and password where it doesn't belong. [David]</li>

    <li>When the &quot;Filter by Site Context&quot; preference is enabled, it no
        longer filters documents when searching for documents to alias.
        Reported by Patrick Walsh. [David]</li>

    <li>The &quot;Cancel Checkout&quot; button in the Story, Media, and Template
        profiles now tries to do the right thing instead of just leaving the
        asset on a desk in workfow every time. If the asset was just created
        by the user, it will be deleted. If it was just recalled from the
        library by the user, it will be removed from workflow and shelved in
        the library. Otherwise, clicking the &quot;Cancel Checkout&quot; button will
        leave the asset in workflow. Requested by Sara Wood, Rachel Murray,
        and others. [David]</li>

        <code>make clone</code> now provides the current date and time for the default
        name for the cloned package. Suggested by Marshall Roch. [David]</li>

  </ul>
  <li>Bug Fixes</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Bricolage no longer tries to display thumbnails for related stories,
        since stories don't have thumbnails and would therefore create an
        error. [Eric Sellers]</li>

    <li>Text::Levenshtein is again correctly loaded as an optional module,
        not a required module. Reported by Marshall Roch. [David]</li>

    <li>Bric::Util::Burner's <code>preview_another()</code> method now actually works.
        Thanks to Serge Sozonoff for the spot. [David]</li>

    <li>Fixed clone interface for IE users. Spotted by Serge Sozonoff.
        [Scott]</li>

    <li>Some of the supported values for the <code>Order</code> parameter to the Story,
        Media, and Template classes, such as <code>category_uri</code>, did not work
        before. Now they do. [David]</li>

    <li>Changing categories on a template no longer creates Frankensteinian
        template paths. [David]</li>

    <li>Added constant <code>HAS_MULTISITE</code> to the Bric base classe so that all
        classes properly declare themselves for UI search results. [Jo&atilde;o
        Pedro]</li>

    <li>Story and Media SOAP calls now correctly use the element's key name
        to identify the element. [Jo&atilde;o Pedro]</li>

    <li>Story, Media, and Template creation via SOAP now correctly look up
        the Category by URI and site ID. [Jo&atilde;o Pedro & David]</li>

    <li>The Template SOAP interface now suports the <code>site</code> parameter to
        <code>list_ids()</code>. [David]</li>

    <li>The Story, Template, and Media SOAP <code>list_ids()</code> intefaces now
        properly look up categories, output channels, and workflows with the
        <code>site</code> paremeter, if there is one. [David]</li>

    <li>The <code>LOAD_LANGUGES</code> and <code>LOAD_CHAR_SETS</code> directives are now space
        delimited, to better match other bricolage.conf options. [David]</li>

    <li>Aliased media documents now correctly point to the file name for the
        aliased media document. Reported by Patrick Walsh. [David]</li>

    <li>Thanks to the improvements to the collection class, cloning stories
        and putting them into new output channels to ensure that they have
        unique URIs now works properly. Reported by Serge Sozonoff. [David]</li>

    <li>The publish status and version is once again properly set for media
        when they are published. Reported by Serge Sozonoff. [David]</li>

    <li>The group manager now properly displays the names of the sites that
        member objects are associated with if the class of the objects being
        managed knows that its objects are associated with sites. Reported
        by Ho Yin Au. [David]</li>

    <li>The list of output channels to add to a media or story document in
        the media and story profiles now includes only those output channels
        associated with the site that the story or media document is in.
        [David]</li>

    <li>Thanks to the fix to 1.6.13 that prevents deleted groups from
        affecting permissions, there is no longer any need to provide a
        checkbox to get access to deleted groups in the permissions
        interface. So it has been removed. [David]</li>
  </ul>
