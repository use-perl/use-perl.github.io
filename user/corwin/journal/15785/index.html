<p><p>This is my first journal entry. I've only become a use Perl member, but since 
  I have I've realized that it's passable, however unlikely, that jotting down 
  my experience with the language, and more generally in the fields of computer 
  geekery about which I muck, may prove of interest to others. I do keep a <a href="http://corwin.mpls.cx">web 
  site</a>, and a <a href="http://corwin.mpls.cx/diary.html">more general journal</a> 
  there, but what I intend to put here will be strictly perl related. Or maybe 
  not. We'll see. </p>
<p> Anyway, I've just embarked on two rather ambitions projects that I'd like 
  to mention. </p>
<p>This first is the total redesign of the web site for the <a href="http://www.hackerslegion.com">Legion 
  of Ethical Hacking</a>, of which I'm a member, and for whom I operate the (trunk) 
  IRC server. The last (read: current) version of the site was done in PHP, of 
  which I'm not very fond, and so when time came to do a redesign I started mouthing 
  off about <a href="http://masonhq.com">HTML::Mason</a>. This has earned me a 
  rather prominent (if not actually estimable) position in the design group, and 
  the privilege of hosting the <a href="http://dev.leh.mpls.cx">development site</a> 
  for the project until such time as we're able to move to our new server, where 
  we'll be able to build our own httpd, mod_perl, and other goodies.</p>
<p>The other project is a collaboration. I've invested some effort, recently, 
  in writing plug-ins for <a href="http://jinzougen.net">Perl-fu</a>, and this 
  gave me cause to write several time to it's author, Brandon Beamer. Eventually, 
  we started talking, and he has since asked me to collaborate on the next version 
  of the bot. I've very excited about this. We're still in the planning stages 
  but the bot is going to kick serious ass when finished. I even think we'll stay 
  fairly true to the original <a href="http://infobot.org">Infobot</a>. I wish 
  I could still locate my notes from YAPC, where this was talked about.</p>
<p>In other news, today Halfjack on EFnet's #perlhelp pointed me at <a href="http://www.weitz.de/regex-coach/">REGex 
  coach</a> which I expect to seriously improve my life. Also I wrote:</p>
<blockquote><code>sub 
  there(&amp;){}sub is($){} not $try; there{ is do {} or do not eval{}}</code></blockquote>
<p>which I'm awfully darned pleased with. I also did</p>
<blockquote><code>sub 
  there(&amp;){}sub is($){} not $try; there{ is do{} or not do {}}</code></blockquote>
<p><code>but I think I like the former better. Suggestions (to either) very much 
  welcome. </code></p>
