<p>http://www.garshol.priv.no/download/text/perl.html<br/><br/>I read this and started to write a pissed-off journal article about it. Then I thought for a bit and realized that <i>it doesn't matter</i>. <br/><br/>I don't need to fight for Perl. I need to write it. Python isn't better. Perl isn't better. Perl is better <i>for me personally</i> because I can think in it. I can do things in it that can't easily be done in Python - as far as I know.<br/><br/>I have a job to do. It's writing code. It isn't to crab at people who don't like Perl. They can waste their energy on saying it sucks. They're not writing code while doing that.<br/><br/>Who is spending time better?</p>

<h2>he seems a bit clueless</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/TeeJay/">TeeJay</a> on 2004-04-06T17:15:51</h3>
he hasn't bothered actually reading the documentation provided or the books he names. If he had, he would not have struggled at all.
<p>
He sounds like somebody who tried perl for a couple of weeks, the jumped on the python bandwagon and swallowed their propaganda.
</p><p>
notice how he forgets that CPAN exists, with its modules to get what he wanted done quicker and easier than with python, or with OO interfaces.
</p><p>
notice also how he doesn't know how to use perldoc for answering simple questions.
</p><p>
fool.

It's not about clueless. It's not even about Perl or Python. It's about making people angry, which is the unforgivable part to me.<br> <p> <br>I'm planning on taking the anger I fel and transforming it into a few more CPAN modules. Creation in response to deliberate attempts to cause chaos is the only reasonable response.</p>

<a href="http://xahlee.org/UnixResource_dir/writ/responsible_license.html" title="xahlee.org">This</a xahlee.org> was posted in the perl community on Orkut, and the first reply was simply a problem with the swearing.
<p>
I can't seem to forget about this Xah guy, partly because his ideas run rampantly counter to my own, but mostly because he seems <em>so angry</em> about this issue.  He is the anti-RMS.</p>

Xah was on the macperl list once and he was <a href="http://bumppo.net/lists/macperl/1999/01/msg00309.html" title="bumppo.net">flaming Unix *and the people who like and use it.*</a bumppo.net>  I asked him to <a href="http://bumppo.net/lists/macperl/1999/01/msg00307.html" title="bumppo.net">not get into such things on that list</a bumppo.net>, as flaming is inappropriate, and he flamed me (IIRC, it was in private).  Then I see a post by him on his website <a href="http://www.xahlee.org/UnixResource_dir/perlr.html" title="xahlee.org">flaming me further</a xahlee.org> (note also his calling Larry Wall a troll).<br> <br>He's a nasty and uninteresting person; don't bother caring about what he has to say, unless you wish to be abused by him.

I was honestly wondering if some sort of cracked language generator was spewing the stuff on his site, because it seemed kind of disconnected and randomly flamy.  So he's actually real?

The page your URL points to hasn't been updated since January, 2002. Do you wonder if he still feels the same way or changed his mind?

I don't know, frankly. The link came up on del.icio.us the other day (good resource, by the way - thanks, gnat!).<br> <br>I know Xah Lee is still deeply committed to this POV; he tried to get a flamewar going on Orkut with the "Larry Wall is a troll" business, but nobody was interested.<br> <br>Not being interested seems the best policy.
