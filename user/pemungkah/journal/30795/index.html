<div class="span8">
<p>Just lately, I ran across <a href="http://librivox.org">librivox.org</a>, an open-source audiobook project. These folks read public-domain books, upload the recordings as MP3s, and then release them in the public domain. Pretty cool.<br/><br/>The project has been running itself via the Librivox forum, and has come up with a pretty decent workflow to allow people all over the world to participate in reading books. Heck, they even did <a href="http://librivox.org/the-importance-of-being-earnest-by-oscar-wilde/">The Importance of Being Earnest</a> this way, with individual folks from around the world reading lines, and an editor putting it all together to make the final "performance". <br/><br/>But they're starting to get to the point where it'd be better to have a separate application to handle the workflow and act as a search engine for completed works. I started looking at Jifty for this and it looks like it might be just the thing. Stealing some code from Wifty (the Jifty wiki) looks like I can bang together a basic application in a short while -- if an already-underway PHP/MySQL project isn't done first. That one has some of the more experienced Librivoxers behind it, so it may end up being the system of choice; it's more likely to have captured the workflow for sure, as I'm looking at it from the outside, as opposed to being experienced in the process.<br/><br/>Still, as a slightly-more difficult application, this should be a good vehicle for me to learn Jifty, and I'm going to go ahead anyway, even if they don't use mine.</p>
