<p>Being lazy <b>and</b> full of hubris in the <i>good</i> way, I decided that if I wanted to be able to display data structures in <i>a</i> debugger, that I should be able to do it in <i>the</i> debugger. Why not? Why give up all those great functions it's got just because I want a new one of my own?<br/><br/>Why not, indeed. I began digging into the debugger, and it is a wonderful, fascinating, terminally underdocumented, and monolithic piece of code. It does a lot of very heavy magic to be able to do an awful lot of processing without disturbing the running program, it is optimized out the ying-yang, uses a lot of arcane but useful techniques, and is not well-suited for extension. But hey, why let <i>that</i> stop me?<br/><br/>I've taken on the task (following encouragement by Schwern) of reformatting, commenting, and understanding it, hopefully well enough to talk about it at TPC and or YAPC.<br/><br/>It's really quite fascinating, and I think it'll make a good paper -- or man page, anyway.</p>

<h2>Have you tried ptkdb?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/djberg96/">djberg96</a> on 2002-02-11T22:36:10</h3>
Are you using the command line or ptkdb?  I find that, unless I'm debugging a fork'ing program, there's no reason to use the command line debugger.  The array and hash layouts are very nice.
<p>
As for how to use it, there's "Perl Debugged" and "Debugging Perl", both of which discuss how to use the debugger (though they talk about much more than that).</p>
