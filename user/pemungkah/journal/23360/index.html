<p>I've taken a typical Perl programmer approach to the OS X Long Now Chimes program I'm working on: do all the easy stuff first and then do the hard part.<br/><br/>Deep in the gut the application of course has to make noises. Turns out that the synthesis stuff is actually pretty simple: I can use Apple's provided-with-the-OS sample-playing MIDI synthesis AudioUnit to make noises (and since it's a sample player, making up a new soundbank lets me get away from just plain old General MIDI). I got the sample code working with a (fixed) arbitrary permutation of the chimes with no troble at all. Okay, I had a devil of a time trying to spot why my initializer was bad (one missing comma), but otherwise very easy.<br/><br/>Switching over to the other end, the user interface, Xcode makes the interface coding and design remarkably simple. I've gotten a nice interface that's almost complete in just a couple of hours of point-and-click.<br/><br/>Now all I need to do is shake out the interface a bit, hook up a stubbed-out permutation generator to the application, then drive the synthesis with that; we're coming right along.<br/><br/>When it gets to the permutation generator, I think I'm going to package it up as a C library; that way I can build TAP tests to see if it works (and recycle the ones that Sean has for his LongNowChimes CGI).<br/><br/>OS X coding is <i>so</i> much simpler than OS 9 and earlier that it isn't funny. It's actually enjoyable.</p>
