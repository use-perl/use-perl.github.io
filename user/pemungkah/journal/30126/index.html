<p>So on to specific items:
<ul>
<li>Jeffrey Goff (DrForr)'s presentation on PPI was cool. There seemed to be some confusion in the audience about exactly how much PPI understood about perl, and some of the folks asking questions didn't quite seem to get that PPI knows how to tokenize Perl well; it doesn't claim to understand it. Quite interesting, and possibly of use to me in connection with Class::Pluggability.
<li>Adam Kennedy (Alias)'s PITA presentation was very well done. The equation of the state of CPAN to London's sewers in the 1840's was actually spot on. Can't wait to see more from this project.
<li>Perl::Critic was good. The idea of including a Perl::Critic test in modules is also an excellent idea - setting that up as a derivative of Module::Starter::PBP sounds like it might be worth doing.
<li>Object::Trampoline looks like a great tool: I had some one-on-one time with Stephen Lembark after the session, and he has so many applications for this kind of thing it was amazing. Definitely looking for more stuff from him.
<li>The Perl 6 Update showed a lot of well-thought-out and interesting stuff. Perl 6 is looking exciting again.
<li>Luke Closs's Selenium testing stuff is great, and I intend to steal^Wadapt as much of it as possible for our testing.
<li>Jos&eacute; Castro (cog)'s Acme presentation was great, and I've got some ideas for a few modules of my own now...
<li>Jifty looks cool. I've installed it, and will be reading through it and through the docs of some of the more interesting-looking modules it loaded in the install process.
<li>Steval Little's Moose talk was interesting; have to look at it a bit more to see if it's useful to me.
</ul>
Got a lot more time in the hall sessions this YAPC, mostly because I seemed to have given people ideas both about doing more testing and about plugins.<br/><br/>It was a great YAPC. Wish I could do it more often!
