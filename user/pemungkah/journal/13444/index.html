<div class="span8">
<p>As promised, a quick South Indian chicken curry:
<ol>
<li>Take a large pot (4 quart or so) and put enough oil in to cover the bottom.
<li>Turn it up to medium, and put in:
<ul><li>One stick of cinnamon
<li>Two cloves (break off the little "ball" on the end and throw it away)
<li>Three cardamom seeds
</ul>
Cook this until the scents of the spices start to rise.
<li>Add your chopped chicken; the pieces should be about the size of your thumb.
<li>Add salt, cayenne and ancho pepper (tilt this toward the cayenne for hotter, toward ancho for milder), and turmeric. (I learned to do this by eye, so I don't have precise amounts; what you want is enough pepper so that eveything gets some pepper on all sides, and a teaspoon or so of the turmeric - it's just there to take away the <i>kavachee</i>; that flavor and smell that raw meat gets).
<li>Cook until the smell of the chili softens up a bit - maybe five minutes or so; you're trying to fry the cayenne enough to take of the worst of its acid bite.
<li>At this point, you can go a lot of different directions - we like to add some fresh or frozen vegetables and cook a little longer till everything's heated through. Suggestions:
<ul><li>Eggplant<li>Green beans<li>Broccoli</ul>
</ol>
Serve with rice. </p>

<h2>Malaysian? South Indian?</h2>

Nice Recipe. Reminded me of those days when I used to cook regularly.
<p>
However, I'd like to know since when Malaysia became South Indian.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

My wife, Shymala, is of South Indian extraction, but was born in Malaysia; she's taught me how to cook a good curry (after I had the utter brass to cook a Paul Prudhomme curry for he on our first date).
