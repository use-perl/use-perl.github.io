<p>This was a <i>looooooong</i> day.<br/><br/>Didn't have a lot of time last night to check out the laptop; I had to hurry my prep on Friday. Bad move #1, After getting it back from the sysadmins and deleting 17G of mp3s so I could have some room to work in, I tried backing it up to a FireWire disk. That worked OK, and the first reboot from the FireWire disk as external worked, so I figured that my troubles were over. I could take my bootable backup and transfer it at leisure once I got to my hotel room. Bad move #2.<br/><br/>A sneaking suspicion came over me on the first leg (BWI to Denver) of my flights today (more on that later). I got the machine out, connected everything up, and the dreaded smile/question-mark/smile/question-mark ensued. No combination of alternative boot tried worked, and I couldn't remember how to coax Open Firmware into doing the job.<br/><br/>Legs 2 (Denver to San Francisco) and 3 (San Francisco to Portland) were pretty darn boring - I had a laptop, so I brought to CD player, no books... I'm currently booted up on my backup on one of the iMacs in the terminal room, transferring the backup to a folder on this disk via psync, and thence back to the Powerbook again.<br/><br/>I could just wait for someone from Apple to be around in the morning and beg an install disk to get things working again, but I may get an early-morning call to work on something back home. <br/><br/>On other notes, I was so charmed by Portland on the way in that I rode the MAX train to the end of the line and had to do a heck of a lot more walking than I planned.<br/><br/>But:<ul>
<li>Really cool fountains
<li>Really pretty architecture
<li>A little bit of immersion in Portland
<li>Got to see The Sisters and Mount Hood from the air.
</ul><br/><br/>I am now really tired but happy.</p>
