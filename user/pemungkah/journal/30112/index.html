<p>This YAPC was far more intense than previous ones for me, both on the professional and the personal level - so much so that I've waited until getting home to try to blog about it.<br/><br/>I arrived Sunday evening - unfortunately too late for the arrival dinner. Or the anti-arrival dinner. In fact, I was so late that no one was willing to deliver food at all. The perils of routing oneself through O'Hare.<br/><br/>Chicago is an interesting town; a tad rough around the edges, and very much itself. I haven't stayed in doems since college, so I'd forgotten the dorm experience. As dorms go, the MSV dorms were quite okay. I gather that the SSV dorms were like living in concrete monk's cells. I was foresighted enough to take along a container of disinfecting wipes, which was nice to clean up around the shower and sink a little. I recommend it for anyone staying in a dorm.<br/><br/>The session were all very good this year, with some very cool stuff which I intend to start using and adapting as soon as possible: 
<ul>
<li>Object::Trampoline, which uses one of the most wonderful pieces of subtle Perl I've seen in a while: an object that exists only for the purpose of replacing itself with something else as soon as it's called. 
<li>Test::WWW::Selenium, which wraps up the Selenium web testing platform in a handy Test::More interface. I intend to try grafting this into simple_scan as soon as I possibly can.
<li>The Goo, a development environment which features a way of deciding "what do I feel like doing" (a couple problems installing, but I can work those out and send back some patches).
<li>Jifty, yet another web app development platform, but this one looks a little less esoteric - not trying do hard to be "Perl on Rails". It installed a lot of interesting-looking prereqs as well; I'm planning on firing up Pos::Webserver::Source and reading a lot next week.
</ul>
My presentations both went very well, though I think I may have been a little too high-energy in the Pluggability one, so I may have been off-camera a chunk of the time. Lots of interest in that; I'll need to finish off the final version and get it on CPAN soonest.<br/><br/>The simple_scan presentation went very well;. the jokes got laughs when they were supposed to, and the stories were well-recieved as well. I had someone come up to me and say that they'd come to my second talk because they'd been told that I was a good speaker, and that they were glad I did. Thanks <i>very</i> much, whoever you are!<br/><br/>I've spent more time on #perl this year, especially in the time leading up to the conference, and it was really great to meet the people that I did; I was also glad that I had good solid work to refer to this year. I feel like I've come a long way in the past two years.<br/><br/>Had a great time in the off-hours as well, with good conversation, and sharing MST3K with both old and new (hi, q!) friends.<br/><br/>More tomorrow. Time for bed.</p>

<h2>Pluggability presentation slides or notes online?</h2>

Have you (do you intend to) put your presentations slides or notes online anywhere?<br><br>cheers,<br><br>Garrett

<h2>Object::Trampoline</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jjore/">jjore</a> on 2006-07-05T21:39:50</h3>
Have you also seen Object::Realize::Later? They do the same thing.

Not yet, but I'll check it out.



<h2>And more...</h2>

<p>In addition to  <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Object::Trampoline" title="cpan.org">Object::Trampoline</a cpan.org> and <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Object::Realize::Later" title="cpan.org">Object::Realize::Later</a cpan.org>, there's <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Class::LazyLoad" title="cpan.org">Class::LazyLoad</a cpan.org>, and my own <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Class::LazyObject" title="cpan.org">Class::LazyObject</a cpan.org>.</p>
<p>Hmmm.... I'm definitely going to have to write about why there are <em>four</em> different modules for this. Of course, whether or not that's a bad thing is a <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/Alias/journal/30724" title="perl.org">different discussion</a perl.org> (I linked to that particular post because it presents the debate, not because I agree or disagree with it), but I also have some ideas about how we can pool our resources.</p>
<p>Thank you so much, I wouldn't have known about Object::Trampoline if you hadn't written about it.</p>
