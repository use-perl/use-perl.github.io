<p><p><b>Company Tax Time</b><br/>
I'm currently in the process of filling out our company tax return, and I now understand why the ATO provides companies with up to nine months to complete this task.  Put simply, the form is not user friendly.
</p><p>
Personal tax, even with all the suppliments, is a walk in the park compared to company tax.  Personal tax assumes that you don't have a copy of the taxation act on your desk, or know how <i>attributed foreign income</i> differs from its <i>unattributed</i> counterpart.
</p><p>
Personal tax provides great refernces to resources that explains all the terms used, whereas with company tax one needs to do much more research.
</p><p>
The question could be asked: why isn't our accountant handling all this?  Well, despite our accountant doing a good job of establishing the company, they've been fairly silent except for a glossy pamphlet reminding us that they'd love to fill in our personal tax returns.
</p><p>
In particular they've done nothing to let us know of the approaching company tax deadlines, or even ask for our financial records so they could make a start on completing the return.  I don't imagine most new company directors know when their company tax is due, and rely upon their accountants to tell them.  I was in this case until I got suspicious of the silence.  So in short, our accountants have failed the 'caring' test.
</p><p>
Given the amount the accountants would have charged for the return, and given that our 2003-04 return is relatively straightforward, we're making a slight profit doing it ourselves, even though I could be spending the time out doing real work.
