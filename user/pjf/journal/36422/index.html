<p><p><b>Rate a CPAN module today!</b><br />
One of the tough challenges facing someone new to Perl, or even someone who has been using it for years, is navigating the huge number of modules available via <a href="http://search.cpan.org/">the Comprehensive Perl Archive Network (CPAN)</a>.  CPAN is <i>very</i> comprehensive, with the little stats in the corner listing 6,500+ authors, 15,000+ distributions, and 55,000+ modules.  That's a <i>lot</i> of code.
</p><p>
Unfortunately, being faced with so many options can be daunting.  The <a href="http://search.cpan.org/">search.cpan.org</a> interface <i>tries</i> to show the most relevant results first, and seems to pay a good amount of attention to <a href="http://cpanratings.perl.org/">CPAN Ratings</a>, and rightly so.  In order for a module to be rated, someone has to get themselves a <a href="https://www.bitcard.org/">bitcard account</a> (usually meaning they're a CPAN author themselves), use the module, and have the time and passion to write a review.  This means that when such reviews do come in, they're highly relevant.
</p><p>
Unfortunately, not very many modules have been given reviews, and often those reviews are given to modules that already have a substantial number already, like <a href="http://cpanratings.perl.org/dist/DBI">DBI</a>.  Yet it's the modules that <i>don't</i> occur commonly in literature that need the reviews the most.
</p><p>
So, dear reader, today I wish to give you a quest.  Go to <a href="http://cpanratings.perl.org/">CPAN Ratings</a>, search for a module you use, and if it doesn't have a review, write one.  That's it, just a single review.  I don't care if you love the module or hate it, just let the world know how you feel.  It can be a single sentence if you like. Heck, you can even critique <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/pjf/?R=D">one of my modules</a> if you want.  Just write a review.
</p><p>
If you don't know where to start, go to a piece of code you've worked on, or the tests for that code, and just look at the <tt>use</tt> lines.  Trust me, you'll find something you care about.  It may even be something that was so simple and easy to use that you had forgotten all about it.
</p><p>
Finally, if you're itching to start a new project, and need an idea, turn <a href="http://cpanratings.perl.org/">CPAN Ratings</a> into a game, the same way it was done with the <a href="http://cpants.perl.org/index.html">CPAN Testing Service</a> and <a href="http://cpants.perl.org/kwalitee.html">Kwalitee</a>, or <a href="http://perlmonks.org/">PerlMonks</a> and their <a href="http://perlmonks.org/?node_id=5938">XP system</a>.  New reviews on a module give you +2 points, reviews on a module that already has reviews give you +1 point, each person who found your review useful gives you +1 point, and each person who didn't find your review useful gives you -1 point.
