<p><p><b>Another trip to Sydney</b><br />
A lot of people have been complaining recently that I don't write enough in my journal.  While I'm quite flattered that anyone reads the thoughts I jot down here, there are usually excellent reasons why there are periods when nothing seems to happen.  It's usually because I'm interstate, and working very hard.
</p><p>
Last week was no exception, with me spending a week in Sydney teaching more Perl.  The courses went down very well, some of the feedback and testimonies were just wonderful.  I was pleased to have such a curious class, I ended up staying back late at lunchtimes and afternoons to keep up with all the questions.
</p><p>
As part of my trip I gave my talk on conference presentation to <a href="http://sydney.pm.org/">Sydney Perl Mongers</a>.  It seems I actually started a minor kefuffle on one of the <a href="http://www.slug.org.au/">SLUG</a> lists, as I was talking about <i>mind control</i>, which we all know is <i>evil</i>.  I started my talk with <a href="http://eclectech.co.uk/mindcontrol.php">a song reminding everyone to wear their tin-foil hats</a>.
</p><p>
My actual talk went down extremely well.  So well that I ended up giving it a second time a few hours later, after Andrew Savige gave a presentation on Perl Best Practices (including a plug for <a href="http://perltraining.com.au/courses/bestpractice.html">Damian's courses</a>).  I'm seriously considering expanding  my talk to tutorial length for the conferences in 2006.
</p><p>
Highlights of the evening included meeting with Pia Waugh, of <a href="http://www.linux.org.au/">Linux Australia</a> fame, and obtaining photographs and movies of last meeting's flaming drinks from Conrad.
