<p><p><b>Retirement by 30</b><br />
I've been talking about early retirement for years.  I'm sure this has been a source of great amusement for friends, family, and peers.  Given that the start of my third decade of life will be happening later this year, I thought I should give a status update about how I'm going.
</p><p>
Retirement, in the sense of 'never need to work another day of my life', simply is not going to happen in the next six months.  That's okay, because retirement in the sense of 'only need to work fifteen days a year' has already happened.  Yes, that includes covering all our diving expenses and a modest amount of savings.
</p><p>
After many years of working insanely hard, I'm finally at the point where I can get some relaxation.  The factors involved in this are simple.  Sound investment plans, sound business management, and sound lifestyle management.
</p><p>
I'm expecting to continue to work more than my required 15 days/year, primarily as a form of insurance.  However for the moment I'm mostly working on maximising my standard of living, rather than maximising my total income.  It's a very, very satisfying state to be in.

<h2>&quot;semi-retired&quot;</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/merlyn/">merlyn</a> on 2006-02-27T14:22:39</h3>
I've been "semi-retired" for many years. As in, having restructured my work so that it mostly doesn't seem like work, and I get to spend a lot of my time doing only the things I enjoy doing, and would probably do whether I got paid or not (and in fact, most of the time simply don't get paid either).
<p>
I actually couldn't imagine not doing most of these things to which I've now become accustomed.  I can now see why so many folks in the US, shortly after the official "retirement", simply die within a few years, because it's just too radical of a change.
</p><p>
So, when my current 44-year-old brain devolves to the 65-year-old brain, I'll probably still be on the net somewhere answering questions.
</p><p>
Maybe just fewer of them.</p>



<h2>Congratulations</h2>

<p>And feel free to share any hints you have to make this come about for the rest of us.</p>



<h2>Actually...</h2>

aren't you starting your *fourth* decade of life?  Sorry to be a downer...<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)
