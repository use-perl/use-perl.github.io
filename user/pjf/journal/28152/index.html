<p><p><b>A venomous trip to the beach</b><br />
Yesterday was as beautiful summer day, with sunshine and clear skies &mdash; the perfect beachgoing weather.  Being the holiday season, Jacinta, myself, our friend Kat and daughter Emily all headed off to Williamstown beach for the afternoon.
</p><p>
I had my snorkling gear with me, and went for a bit of a swim around the beach to see what I could find.  I had a collection bag with me, mainly to pick up any rubbish found in the water, but also to collect anything particularly interesting that I may find.
</p><p>
My first trip back to shore had me arrive with a pretty sea-shell, which I proudly displayed and from which a small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue-ringed_octopus">blue-ringed octopus</a> emerged.  Yes, within only a few minutes at the beach I had discovered one of Australia's most venomous marine species.  Living in Australia is grand!
</p><p>
We all admired the octopus for a little while, and discussed how a single bite causes paralysis and respiratory arrest, and how there is no known antivenom.  Indeed, our book on dangerous creatures claims that a single octopus contains enough venom to kill <i>ten</i> adults.  An exciting find indeed.
</p><p>
Being careful to stay away from the biting end of the rather annoyed cephalopod, I walked back into the ocean and let it free.  The colour changes were quite amazing to watch, the octopus went from an angry blue-ringed pattern to a gorgeous orange as it swam away.
</p><p>
The remainder of the snorkle had me discover a number of old bottles, a golf-ball, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puffer_fish">puffer fish</a>, and a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skate">skate</a> (<a href="http://images.google.com/images?q=skate+fish">images</a>).  Overall a most rewarding day.
