<p><p><b>A day off</b><br/>
One of the nice things about running your own business is that after a long week in Sydney, and a busy weekend, you can choose to take the Monday off and have a long weekend.  That's the theory, anyway.
</p><p>
The trouble is that even if you take a day off, the rest of the world keeps working.  In the period of 9am - 11am I've accquired a new potential client, confirmed two off-site appointments, and had a phone-call letting me know of a machine compromise at a client.  Thankfully the compromise was rapidly contained and cleaned.
</p><p>
Given that works seems to have found me, I'm going to spend a few hours catching up on paperwork (relatively relaxing), and try to see if I can finish work early.

<p>
Unfortunately 'disconnect the phone' is the same as 'disconnect your primary source of income'.  I'm not yet at the stage where I'm willing to pay the rather large loss of potential revenue involved in simply not answering the phone.

<p>Clarification, in case it makes a difference: I don&#8216;t mean outright pulling the phone out of the wall plug or even cancelling the line, just something like muting the ring tone during your day off, or even simply setting an instant redirect to your answering machine.</p>

<p>If that still jeopardizes too much income, then you probably shouldn&#8216;t delude yourself by thinking about &#8220;days off.&#8221;<nobr> <wbr></nobr><tt>:-(</tt> </p>
