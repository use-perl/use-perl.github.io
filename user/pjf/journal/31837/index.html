<p><p><b>OSDC Day 2</b><br />
I missed the first half the day, as I had stayed up very late the night before and slept in.  It seems <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/cog/journal/31833">I wasn't the only one</a> who wanted an extra snooze.
</p><p>
I spent most of the day in the <i>Hallway Track</i>, speaking with people and catching up on events.  A notable exception was the lightning talks, which are always worth seeing at OSDC.  <a href="http://jose-castro.org/">JosÃÂ©</a> encouraged everyone to start <a href="http://use.perl.org/">use.perl</a> journals as a way to attract more international speakers, and singled me out as an example.  Whether I'm a  good example or a bad one, I don't quite know.
</p><p>
I'm presently working on my talks for tomorrow, including both a lightning talk and my main presentation.  I've also discovered I need to think more about my talk titles for multi-track conferences.  A title like <a href="http://osdc2006.cgpublisher.com/proposals/56/index_html">Human Interfaces for Geeks</a> works great for a single-stream, but I feel isn't catchy enough to attract the crowd I'd like when competing with multiple streams.  Next year I'll have to use a title like <i>Robotic Ninja Pirates</i>.

That looks fascinating. I hope you're able to post slides or a recording (but I'll understand if you're unable).<br><br>As someone studying both computer science and human-computer interaction, I've come to the conclusioin that creating APIs *is* interface design. Sure, you have code considerations, but it's ultimately humans who are going to be writing for your API.

I thought everyone knew APIs were HCI. Huh.

<p>APIs are sooooooo 2005.  We call them DSLs now!</p>

Maybe everyone does. It's a conclusion I've arrived at indpendently, but that does't mean it isn't well known.<br><br>The downside of an extremely theoretical computer science education is that it's easy to miss a lot of real-world stuff, like how humans relate to the code that you're writing.

My talk actually has nothing to do with computers.  It's <i>Human</i> Interfaces for Geeks.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)
</p> <p>
The slides aren't available, but there's a copy of the paper floating about.  I'll see if I can dig it up and attach a link to this entry, but that won't happen until after the conference.
