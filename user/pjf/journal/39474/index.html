<p><p><b>UK and Ireland thank-yous</b><br />
I've spent the last few days travelling around the UK and Ireland,
and it's just been lovely.  By far one of the nicest things about
travelling is the hospitality and generosity of the Perl community,
and so I want to take a moment to say thank-you to a few special
people who made my travels so enjoyable.
</p><p>
Thank-you to Drew, Kimberley, and Samantha for giving up their home
in Dublin, driving around two crazy Australians, and picking us up
when we get completely lost.  An extra special thanks to Kimberley
for some amazing cooking; it's not every day that we get to stay
with a professional chef!
</p><p>
Thank-you to Murray and Becky for giving us booze, conversation,
lodging, and wifi in their most amazing Edinburgh home.  I really
wish I got to spend more time in Edinburgh; both the city and its
people are beautiful, and haggis is plentiful and tasty.
</p><p>
Thank-you to Andy Armstrong for driving us around the spectacular
English countryside, putting us up for the night (and sleeping
on the couch!), and then driving us on to Darlington.  Given the
cost of trains in the UK, Andy saved us a small fortune.  Particular
thanks goes to Andy for the trip to 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadrian%27s_Wall">Hadrian's Wall</a>
and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vercovicium">Vercovicium</a>,
which was spectacular!
</p><p>
Thank-you to my Great Aunt Jennie, who isn't at all involved
in the Perl community, but gave us lunch, tea, great conversation,
and acted as a guide for many miles of walking and photography
around Darlington.
</p><p>
Thank-you to the charity shop five minutes walk from Great Aunt
Jennie's house, which had an almost complete <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Hulk">Space Hulk</a> 1st Edition
set with expansion cards for only ÃÂ£1.50.
</p><p>
Thank-you to Smylers, for putting us up in Leeds, and in particular
for putting up with me running off around the city with my pirate
friends.
</p><p>
Finally, thank-you to LÃÂ©on Brocard for organising a London.pm meeting, and
for Piers Cawley for the lift to the airport.
</p>
</p>
