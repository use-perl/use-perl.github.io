<p><p><b>End of financial year</b><br/>
It's the end of financial year, and everyone and everything is just a little more hectic because of it.  I have a ton of deadlines: negotiations with our bank, taxation matters, a stupidly big pile of paperwork, and a number of conference and magazine-article related matters.
</p><p>
However my real task for the day is clearing my desk, and making sure that there isn't anything that we really want to take advantage of in the 2004-05 financial year.  Any spare time will be spent catching up on accounting and tax matters.
</p><p>
The good news is that despite the busy time was year, I was still able to go out to dinner last night with about a dozen very good friends, and I was still able to sleep until the gloriously late time of 10am.  One of the distinct advantages of running one's own business is flexibility of hours.
</p><p>
On the matter of running a business, I'll be presenting a short yet amusing talk on starting a business at the <a href="http://www.osdc.com.au/osdclub/">Open Source Developers Club</a> on the 13th July, 2005.  This will be a sneak-preview of my paper and presentation for the <a href="http://www.sage-au.org.au/conf/sage-au2005/">Australian System Administrators Conference</a> in Perth later this year.
</p></p>

<p>
Absolutely, although usually my talks are uusally revised and re-presented a few times before eventually reaching the web.  And sometimes I need to be harrassed to publish slides...
</p> <p>
However for more instant gratification, my presentation on "Whirlwind Web Development" that was presented at SAGE-VIC, Melbourne.PM, Sydney.PM, and Canberra.PM, should be available on-line within the next week.  It's the pretty one with all the photos of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascidian" title="wikipedia.org">Ascidians</a wikipedia.org>.
