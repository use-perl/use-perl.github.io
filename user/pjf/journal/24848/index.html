<p><p><b>Tips for businesses - scheduling with others</b><br/>
Let's pretend that you've come across a <a href="http://perltraining.com.au/">dynamic, active business that provides Perl training in Australia</a>, and you're eager to market their courses to the rest of the Asia-Pacific region.  You have an agreement on how to handle bookings and payments &mdash; or at least you've been sent a proposal and you haven't objected &mdash; so it all looks pretty good.
</p><p>
The training manager informs you that they're <i>very</i> busy in the coming year, so please make sure that she gets any proposed dates ASAP to make sure there are no conflicts with existing arrangements.
</p><p>
Do you:
</p><ol style="list-style-type:lower-latin">
<li>Work with the training provider closely to arrange dates.</li>
<li>Don't liase with the training provider, but instead look at the training provider's <a href="http://perltraining.com.au/calendar.html">freely available on-line calendar</a> and organise courses that don't conflict.</li>
<li>Ignore the training provider and their calendar, organsie some dates that may or may not conflict, and send them notification after advertising has commenced.</li>
<li>Ignore the training provider and their calendar, and instead organise dates that suit you. Don't tell the training provider what the dates are, even though you've started to advertise the courses.  When the training provider asks for dates ignore them for the first six requests, and then finally respond.
</ol>
<p>
If you answered 'd', then congratulations!  You're in the same league as many other international training organisations.
</p></p>

<p>Actually if you have answered 'd' you either haven't read the same question as me or maybe you work for an <i>"international training organisations"</i><nobr> <wbr></nobr>;--)</p>

<p>
If you answered '4' then you're probably reading my journal on use.perl, which strips style information from &lt;ol&gt; tags.
</p> <p>
If you answered 'd' then you're probably reading my journal on <a href="http://advogato.net/person/pjf/diary.html?start=399" title="advogato.net">advogato</a advogato.net> or <a href="http://pjf.id.au/blog/?position=401&amp;count=1" title="pjf.id.au">pjf.id.au</a pjf.id.au> which retain the style information.
</p> <p>
Clearly I'll need to keep in mind the cross-platform nature of my journal in future.

<p>Indeed, use.perl it is.</p>
<p>I suspected something like this, but still couldn't resist nit-picking<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;--(</p>
