<p><p><b>Banking Insanity</b><br/>
We have a credit card, and <a href="http://www.commbank.com.au/">the bank</a> charges an annual fee on the 1st July each year.  Each year, I ring the bank and exchange some 'reward points' in return for having the fee reversed.  Everyone is happy.
</p><p>
Today I called the bank to have the fee refunded, and met with what must be one of the most ridiculous constraints I have ever encountered.  The conversation went something like this (<small>the date is fictious for privacy reasons</small>):
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Me:</b> Hi, I've been charged an annual fee on my credit card.  I'd like to use some reward points to have it reversed.
</p><p>
<b>Operator:</b> I'm sorry sir, I can't do that.  You'll have to wait until the 20th of August, as it's an annual fee.
</p><p>
<b>Me:</b> I think I may have been unclear.  The annual fee I was charged was on the first of July.
</p><p>
<b>Operator:</b> Yes sir, I can see that on my display.  However you reversed the fee on the 20th of August last year, and you can only reverse one annual fee per year.
</p><p>
<b>Me:</b> Isn't that what I'm asking?  I had last year's fee reversed, now I want this year's fee reversed.
</p><p>
<b>Operator:</b> I understand what you're asking, sir, but you can only reverse the fee once every twelve months.  The last time you reversed the fee was in August.
</p><p>
<b>Me:</b> But it's an annual fee!  Just because I was late to reversing it last financial year doesn't mean that I <i>have</i> to be late this financial year, does it?
</p><p>
<b>Operator:</b> I'm afraid it does, sir.  You'll have to call back in August.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
After many words on how ludicrous the condition was, escalation to a supervisor, and complaint, the bank agreed to reverse the fee, but <i>only on the 20th of August</i>, as that was when I reversed the fee last year.  Incredible!  Not really the resolution I wanted, but certainly better than having to call back next month.
</p><p>
After the resolution, I asked if I could speak to someone responsible for administering and supervising these conditions, and was presented with the number for the Customer Relations Department.  That sure sounds like a bit-bucket, but I took down the number anyway.  I was also asked if I wanted their postal address, and I refused, claiming that I was sure I could ask them over the phone.  I was wrong.
</p><p>
Upon calling the Customer Relations Department I was met with the most incredible message I have ever encountered.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Hi!  You've called the Customer Relations Department.  We're encountering a very high level of calls right now, and would appreciate it if you could call back later.  Good-bye!  <i>*CLICK*</i>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I thought that perhaps this was some kind of joke, so I called back, same thing.  Checked the number in the phone-book, it was the same.  This is certainly not the way in which I expect a customer relations department to be run.
</p>
<p>
Bouncing on the 'redial' key a few times finally got me past the 'call back later' message, followed by disclaimers, followed by being on hold for five minutes, followed by... you guessed it, <i>*CLICK*.... Beep.... Beep... Beep...</i>
</p>
<p>
Well, after being presented with ridiculous conditions, a complaints line that doesn't answer, and having had earlier in the day deal with <a href="http://www.commbank.com.au/">the bank's website</a>, many parts of which are broken or crippled in anything but MSIE, I did the only thing that could be considered sensible.
</p><p>
I applied for credit at another bank.
</p></p>

Reading this thread, I get the distinct impression that the hapless folks at the bank are at the mercy of a computer program.



<h2>write the CEO!</h2>

unless you already used all the time you wanted on it, then write a letter to the CEO explaining why you are now using a different card.<br> <br>The assistant of the CEO or President usually is able to "fix things".<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br> <br>

I've written a longer response to this in a new <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/pjf/journal/20029" title="perl.org">top level journal entry</a perl.org>.
