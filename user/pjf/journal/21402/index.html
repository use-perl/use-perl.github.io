<p><p><b>Exporting Training</b><br/>
Most of <a href="http://perltraining.com.au/">Perl Training Australia</a>'s business domestic, but from time to time we export our training; almost always to New Zealand, which is practically another state of Australia anyway.
</p><p>
However today we exported training to the Netherlands.  No PTA representative is traveling to Europe, nor is a delegate coming over here.  Instead, the group in the Netherlands are re-selling that training to an office in Hong Kong.  Hong Kong is then transferring the training to a person in their Sydney office.  The person in Sydney will be attending our course.
</p><p>
Recursion in business is a wonderful thing.
</p>
<p><b>Wedding Anniversary</b><br/>
Yesterday was our one year wedding anniversary.  It's been a very, very fast year.  We received cards, flowers, and best wishes, and went out for a lovely meal in the evening.
</p><p>
Coming back from dinner we helped keep a well-dressed but unconscious man in the recovery position and monitored his vital signs until the paramedics arrived.  The paramedics suspected a narcotics overdose and explained that victims are usually okay provided they can provide treatment before their heart stops.
</p><p>
Our fellow happened to still have a beating heart, and hadn't completely stopped breathing, and so with oxygen, assisted respiration, and some very effective pharmaceuticals the paramedics had him conscious and lucid in a surprisingly short time.
