<p><p><b>Paperwork</b><br/>
Another fun day of paperwork catchup.  Invoicing, tax, the joys of running a small business.  We're still behind in our investment decisions.  Too busy making money to, uh, make more money.
</p><p>
Still, I much prefer having too much paperwork than too little.  As long as I'm busy keeping tabs on all the invoices we're sending, I think that we're doing okay.
</p><p>
<b>Journal</b><br/>
I had a colleague remark the other day on my journal; even though all blogs are drivel, this was drivel that he could relate to.
While I was pleased that someone could relate to my writings (I guess everyone has to complete their tax), it did start me thinking about all the things that I don't write about.  I feel that only the most boring of subjects actually reach the keyboard; everything else is either confidential, personal, bound under an NDA, loses value if publicly known, or sometimes even bordering on slanderous.
</p><p>
All the good things that won't get me sued, ostricised, or hospitalised end up as training materials, conference presentations, or short talks that are foisted upon whatever local Perl Mongers or technical groups happen to be nearby.
</p><p>
<b>Day off</b><br/>
In theory I have tomorrow as a day off.  Perhaps I should spend the time harvesting wild vegetables without a mobile phone, so I can actually take it.  It should be mushroom season soon as well.  Mmmm, wild mushrooms.
