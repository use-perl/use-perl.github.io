<b>Childhood dream fulfilled</b><br/>
Like many other eight year olds, I was caught up in the <i>Ghostbusters</i>
craze some twenty years ago.  I watched the movie so often I knew most
of the script.  As a fledgling roleplayer I had the Ghostbusters RPG.
As an imaginative child I would procure many household items (vacuum
cleaners, turntables, radios, hairdryers) for conversion into
ghostbusting equipment, which (much to my parents chagrin) usually
involved them being disassembled and the electronics coated in cooking
oil to shield against ghosts.
</p><p>
I also had the Ghostbusters computer game, for the Commodore 64.
It was a good game for its era, although its primary selling points
were the song lyrics on the title screen, and two voice-synthesized
phrases: <i>Ghostbusters!</i> and <i>It slimed me!</i>.
</p><p>
Despite hours of play of the Ghostbusters computer game, I never
managed to complete it.  The last scene involved sneaking two
ghostbusters past the marshmallow man, and I could only ever get a
single one past.  I had heard tales of friends of friends who had
done it, but nobody I had actually met in the flesh.
</p><p>
Yesterday, on a whim, I grabbed a copy of Ghostbusters for my
emulator and tried my luck again.  As fate would have it, I got
past the marshmallow man on the very first game, with the very
first two ghostbusters.  My childhood dream was fulfilled.
</p><p>
Unfortunately, like many games of its era, the end-scene for
the Ghostbusters C-64 game was rather uninspiring.  A brief
and unexciting animation, followed by some written text which
amounts to a little more than <i>Congratulations, you have won</i>.
Regardless of the poor ending, I still feel superior over my peers
for having seen it.
</p><p>
<b>Breakfast dreams shattered</b><br/>
Awoke rather early today in preparation for a long trip across town
to visit an irregular client.  With some excitement I realised that
I woke early enough to allow me to comfortably make my favourite
breakfast: soft-boiled eggs with soldiers and espresso coffee.
</p><p>
Unfortunately, we were out of bread, so this dream never came to
fruition.  In hindsight I probably could have walked to the corner
store and picked up some bread rather than writing a journal entry
about things I thought were cool when I was eight, and what I was
planning to have for breakfast.
