<b>Travel</b><br>
Whenever I mention that I'm going away to another city, everyone always
acts like it's very nice to have a job that involves frequent travel.
It isn't.  Departure lounges are boring places.  Airplanes are cramped
and uncomfortable, and waiting for luggage is awful.  Today, particularly
so.
</p><p>
It takes an hour to fly from Melbourne to Sydney.  However today it's
taken at least another hour for them to be able to unpack the luggage
from the plane.  I say at least another hour, as I've been on the ground
for eighty minutes and the luggage still hasn't arrived, and isn't
showing any signs of doing so.
</p><p>
The excuse?  A thunderstorm.  I'm not sure why planes are allowed to
do the dangerous task of landing in thunderstorms, but bags cannot
be unpacked, but that apparently seems to be the case.  The voice-over
has just upgraded the wait to an 'indefinite delay'.  There's about
400-500 people waiting for their bags with me, and they're nowhere
near as happy as I am.  I have a copy of Half-Life in my bag, Proc::UID
to work upon, and a course to review.
</p><p>
I'm not going to get the fiendishly bad-for-you doughnuts that were
doing to be tonight's highlight, though.  The store closes in three minutes,
and is on the other side of town.
</p><p>
I do have wireless access, but it's a walled-city affair -- I can read
about how wonderful the airport is.  However DNS works.
I really have to get IP-tunneled-via-DNS happening.
</p><p>
<i>Update:</i> The other airline doesn't seem to have anyone waiting.
Lucky them.  Maybe only <i>Virgin Blue</i> staff are afraid of thunderstorms?
</p>
<B>Tomorrow</B><BR>
Tomorrow I'll be teaching Intermediate Perl, and squeezing in a lunchtime
meeting with a potential client.  They're an Australian distributor for
some huge e-commerce package written entirely in Perl, and are thrilled
about the idea of having someone write them customisations and train
their customers.  Lunchtime is a rotten time for the meeting, as it's
when I'd normally be relaxing, reviewing, and using some crippled internet
connection to post this journal entry.
</p><p>
All this assumes that I actually get my bags, and the airport doesn't
have us come back in the morning to collect them.
</p><p>
Unlike my normal arrangements, I'm not flying back tomorrow night.  Instead,
I'm flying back Saturday morning.  That gives me a little bit of a more
relaxed schedule, but there's not much I really want to do in Sydney
to be relaxed about.
</p>

You may be in a geek household when you watch Venus transitting the
sun on <tt>xplanet</tt>.

<B>Pets</B><BR>
Shadow found a way into the neighbours backyard today.  He seemed
<i>very</i> pleased with himself, and apparently set about eating
the lettuce and other good things in their vegie patch.  We took him
back home, found what we thought was the hole in the fence, and filled
it in.  Hopefully he won't be bad while we're in Sydney, as I'm not sure
how we'll retrieve him from interstate.
</p>
<p>
<B>Course-writing</B><BR>
I <i>should</i> be writing changes for my security course at the moment.
That would be a good use of time.  It's due for printing in just over
a week, and needs a lot more material to be long enough for a day-long
tutorial.  That I'm ending this journal entry here is probably a sign
that I've realised just how close the due-date happens to be.
</p>
<p>
<b>Update</b>
Luggage is finally running at 10:20, two hours after the flight landed.
