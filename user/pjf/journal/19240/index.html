<B>Holiday?</B><br>
Yesterday I did very little work.  It was just like a little holiday.  Out walking with jarich I bumped into a couple of canines that were happy to see us, shortly followed by their owner, Ian, who I don't think I'd seen since his wedding a little while ago.
</p><p>
Hung out with Jarich, Ian, Sofie and their friend <i>V</i> (short for Violetta), and had dinner at the Morrocan Soup Bar, which I hadn't visited for far too long.  Sofie baked lots of cookies, too.  I love Sofie's cooking.
</p><p>
All up a very enjoyable and relaxing day.  I'm looking forward to more days like that.
</p><p>
<b>Public Holiday</b><br>
Today is a public holiday.  Unfortunately, I'm working, reviewing the draft for the security course, which has a deadline in a week.  That's not fun, but it is needed.  The rest of this week will probably be filled with clients and meetings,.
</p><p>
I'd much rather spend the day doing accounting.  Yes, I'm rather strange like that.
