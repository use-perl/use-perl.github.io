Time is money, and money is time.  I'm in the fortunate position of being able to convert between the two very easily.  I have lots of contacts and work available, so I can easily turn time into money by working.  However that work also tends be very flexible.  If I want to, I can arrange to have lots of time by delaying work, or outsourcing parts of it to others.
</p><p>
I find that I never have enough time.  My overall goal is to ensure that I accumulate enough money -- which I can then turn into time -- so I can spend my days happily doing the things which I enjoy.  These include learning, writing, gardening, spending time with friends, and spending time underwater.  I'm also partial to the occasional game or two.
</p><p>
What I find interesting is looking at the rates at which I can sell time (by working) or buy time (just by living).  This lets me convert from using dollars (which I don't really care about), to days (which I do).
</p><p>
Based upon the 2003-04 financial year, and excluding weddings and funerals, the cost of living for Jacinta and myself with our current lifestyle is about $72/day, plus tax.  That drops to about $57.50/day (plus tax) if diving-related expenses are excluded.
</p><p>
Using these figures, I can answer all sorts of interesting questions.  How many days could I spend relaxing if I didn't buy this new toy?  How many days can I spend relaxing if I choose to allow this asset to be exhausted?  How many days of relaxation do I get for doing a particular job?
</p><p>
However, the most interesting question, "when can I retire?" is not one that can be easily answered.  I can retire when my investment revenue exceeds my cost of living -- or when I have around 20 years in the bank.  I could retire before then, but not without the risk of finding myself short in my old age.
</p><p>
This means that my "cost of living" figures aren't as useful as I'd like them to be, as they only tell me what I'd gain in time if I spent my savings, not what I'd gain by investing them.  Assuming a real ROI of 5%, I'll need twenty times my daily cost of living to obtain the cost of a "perpetual day", which in this case is about $1440.  Each "perpetual day" of savings represents one day each year that I don't have to work.
</p><p>
A perpetual day is a much more useful measure of time to money -- "If I don't buy this new toy worth $1440, I can have an extra day off work each and every year for the rest of my life."
</p><p>
If I actually use the perpetual days that I have saved to let me relax each year, then I'll have 365 perpetual days worth of savings in about eight and a half years, assuming my rate of saving remains constant.  Put another way, in around four years I'll need to do only half as much work as I do now.
</p><p>
Obviously if I continue to work as hard as I am now, I'll reach the end goal significantly sooner than 8.5 years.  The same applies if I can continue to increase the rate at which I can save money.
</p><p>
Well, that's something to look forward to.  I better get back to my accounting now.
