<p><p><b>Darwin Training</b><br />
For the last week I was training on a secure facility located near Darwin.  That means
that nobody can tell me why they're learning Perl, or what they do for a job.  It also means that I need to be accompanied at all times, including when getting a coffee, or visiting the bathroom.
</p><p>
Actually, I tell a lie there.  I'm not allowed to fetch my own coffee, since the area containing the coffee machine is restricted.  In some ways it's like being a little kid again, I can't go anywhere without being accompanied by a responsible adult.
</p><p>
Working on a secure facility is nothing new, I've done this a few times before with trips to Canberra.  However this facility has
by far has the best <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=darwin&ll=-12.358914,130.981906&spn=0.003385,0.005472&t=k&om=1">satellite photos</a> of anywhere I've worked.  That's a lot of technology out in the middle of nowhere.
</p><p>
While my 'need to know' extends about as far as the cafeteria menu, I've picked up some of the local rumours about the base. Apparently it's part of Australia's UFO-defense network, with interceptors launched from a <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=darwin&t=k&om=1&ll=-12.413715,130.879397&spn=0.027075,0.043774">nearby air-base</a>, and a UFO missile defense system near Alice Springs.  Apparently UFOs are a real problem during the hurricane season, as the bad weather can interfere with equipment and the number of abductions goes way up.  Another good reason to stay inside during a hurricane alert.
</p><p>
Unfortunately I didn't get to see any UFO intercepts, not least because I was teaching in a room with no windows.  Nor was I allowed to see the recovered alien technology on sub-basement 7G.  Even so, I'm very excited that Perl may potentially being used for integrating with other-worldly technology.

Good of you to provide some misdirection, but it's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UFO_(TV_series)" title="wikipedia.org">well known</a wikipedia.org> in the open literature the sub-orbital interceptors are sea-launched.<br/><br/>Interesting imagery. Reminds me of where I used to work, but they cleared the old junk off the lawn before the aptly named Google Keyhole went operative.
