<div class="span8">
<p>Only three more days of teaching until I can have a real weekend where I can sleep in and do programming instead of reviewing course notes.  :)
<p>
I've started teaching the OO course, which is enjoyable because it's a subject I enjoy and I have a little more time than the other courses to spend in teaching it.  The extra time is certainly needed, since everyone on the course either only started learning Perl from the courses last week, or is rusty with their Perl skills and is taking a while to remember how everything works.
<p>
Only about half as many people are on the OO courses as actually enrolled.  This isn't a surprise, I didn't expect most people to be able to handle zero-knowledge to "very advanced concepts" over a week of intensive training.  Mind you, some people are holding out <i>extremely</i> well.
<p>
Small class sizes are good for working through things and making sure everyone understands, but they're not as good when it comes to class discussions. When you want everyone talking and thinking, the more the merrier.
<p>
Got to do some more preparation for tomorrow.</p>
