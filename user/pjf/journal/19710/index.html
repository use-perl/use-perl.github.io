<B>Geeks from Childhood</B><BR>
Jacinta is in the process of updating many of our contacts, including old freinds from high school, and she came across a fascinating discovery.  One of our friends from University, Aaron Zurbo, I apparently knew when I was around 13 years old.  It's even mentioned in the minutes of a <a href="http://www.dataserve.org/julybm.html">DataServe Business  meeting</a>.  I had no idea that we had such a long history until today.  It appears that geeks at a young age tend to re-meet again as geeks when they get older.
</p>
<p>
For those interested, <a href="http://www.dataserve.org/">DataServe</a> is a business set up by a number of my friends and associates in high school.  It was a whole lot of fun, quite probably because I didn't have to do a ton of paperwork at the end of each financial year.

Company finances are mostly completed, but our personal finances have three months worth of book-keeping to catch up on.  The worst part of receipts from taxis in Melbourne, where many drivers don't seem to have the faintest clue about what a tax invoice is supposed to look like.  The best taxi drivers are in Canberra -- as the seat of government almost all taxi trips there are for business.
