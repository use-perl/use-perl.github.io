It works!  I've got Windows running inside Bochs, network and all.  I still don't know how fast it is for the things that I want to use, as I've got a bazillion critical security patches to install.

I found Bochs painfully slow on my Powerbook (867MHz, 640Mb RAM), almost to the point of being unusable.  I have however had greater luck with Virtual PC, which while slow, depending upon the operating system installed in the virtual machine, is quite usable.  I now keep a number of operating system installations and maintain a 'golden' version of these systems separate to my working version, so that the turn-around time from frying an installation is short.

Rob, it's good to see you still about.  We've missed you at Melb.PM.
</p> <p>
I'm running Bochs on a fast machine (1.6GHz Centrino - roughly equal to a 2.2GHz P4), which I'm hoping will overcome the slowness of being an emulated machine.  It's *still* installng service packs, and so far the biggest issue I've seen (besides speed) is that networking appears to drop out during high loads.
</p> <p>
I'm evaluating FOSS openings first before I go to commercial code.  Given that my primary motivation for setting up a virtual machine is for the installation of software with 'unpalatable EULAs', I don't want to be worrying about yet another EULA to run these.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)
</p> <p>
Thanks for the vote for VirtualPC.  I'll make sure that I give it a try if I do move to a commercial offering.
</p> <p>
Cheerio,

I'm running debian inside VirtualPC on a 1.4 Centrino and its doing really well. I tried out VMWare, but that is really heavy on your system even if you dont have it running, because it starts a dozen processes on machine startup.
