<p>Somehow all of my journal entries are about how busy I am.  I don't see this changing for the forseeable future.<br/><br/>We're seeing the usual expected flood of unexpected enquiries that are common at the end of the financial year.  These will continue with the flood of enquiries from the new financial year, next month.<br/><br/>Today was spent finishing my slides for my presentation tonight at Melb.pm, and which will also form part of my tutorial at the SAGE-AU conference in August this year.  I've got a *lot* of writing to do for the SAGE-AU tutorial, and I'm not quite sure when I'm going to get that all done.  Jacinta has been great in helping here -- three cheers for co-authors.<br/><br/>As usual, I'm really looking forward to clearing out all of my current work, so that way I can proceed to fill my life up with different work.  For some reason I believe this will be more relaxing, despite having done it many times in the past.<br/><br/>I don't even want to think about accounting, but I've got a big pile of paperwork on my desk that will need to be addressed.  I think I'll have to spend a day with loud techno and book-keeping soon.<br/><br/>On the conference front, Dan Sugalski has indicated he's willing to contribute to the YAPC::AU/OSDC proceedings, which has me thrilled.  As this is our first conference, having a few big names behind it really helps.<br/><br/>Proc::UID seems to be gaining silent acceptance.  The discussion on perlmonks has been slim, but the reputation of the node indicates that a lot of people are reading it.  I don't think I'll have it tested for enough systems to even try for Perl 5.8.5, but I'll be putting out a call for testers soon, and I may get lucky.<br/><br/>One thing I really want to do with Proc::UID is formulate a formal testing model to ensure that all privileges are tested for all possible state transitions.  This should be possible, although it's a fairly significant project in itself, and means that Proc::UID will be superbly tested.<br/><br/>It will also give me something else to write about.  Now I just need all my highly-paid work to stop for a while so I can spent my time working on lowly-paid journal articles.  ;)<br/><br/></p>
