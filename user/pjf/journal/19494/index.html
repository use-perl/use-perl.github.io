<b>Business</b><br>
It's the end of financial year, and sure enough jobs are appearing seemingly out of nowhere and into our work bucket.
</p><p>
I haven't had anyone come to me this year and say they really need to lose $10,000 in the next few days in order to justify their budget for next year.  However this is certainly the time of year that businesses tend to think about their spending.
</p><p>
My own goals for next financial year?  To do less work and make more money, of course.  ;)
</p><p>
<b>P5P</b><br>
I'm a little worried that if I write a set of regression tests, act courteously to different operating systems, and adjust Perl's configure scripts appropriately, then Perl 5.8.6 may well end up playing roguelike games when sort is called in a scalar context and built with <tt>--with-roguelike=/usr/games/nethack</tt>.
</p>
<p>
It'd certainly make it more fun to explain to students how different functions act differently depending upon context.
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://use.perl.org/user/merlyn">Merlyn</a> started the whole business in his post <a href="http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2004-06/msg00268.html">here on p5p</a>.  That I responded is a clear sign that I have some sixty pages on Perl security that I don't want to think about reviewing.
</p>
<p>
I wonder if 'play roguelike game' should become a Parrot opcode?  ;)
</p></p>

<h2>No roguelike games, no</h2>

Unless Damian decides to spend one of the opcodes he won at YAPC::EU in Munich.<br> <br>On the other hand, when we're done you ought to be able to load and run zork-like games, since z-machine code is (or at least will be) one of Parrot's native bytecode formats...<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-P
