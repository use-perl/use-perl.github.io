<b>Tax</b><br/>
Spent the day working on tax matters.  This wasn't anywhere as exciting as it
may seem, and I'm sure most people don't consider tax to be even remotely
enchanting.  Most of the work was spent ensuring that all the accounts were
reconciled for last quarter, and the primary source of frustration was
caused by some misplaced invoices.  It would appear that I had started two
indepdent folders for the invoices in question, and had filed the older
invoices into a section which I had since forgotten.
</p><p>
The most amusing part of dealing with tax matters was to discover that
the <a href="http://www.ato.gov.au/">Australian Tax Office</a> had given
me the option of making GST installments.  This means no <i>mandatory</i>
pain of ensuring accounts are reconciled at the end of each quarter,
and a generous period of time at the end of the financial year to
make sure that everything is accounted for.  The installments are also
well less than the tax we would otherwise have to remit, so the business
gains a slight gain from interest earned on this money.
</p><p>
Tomorrow will be spent double-checking what is likely to be the most
complex personal tax return I'll ever complete.  Thankfully it's all
filled out, and I only need to recheck the figures.
</p><p>
<b>Travel and Training</b><br/>
I'm flying up to Sydney next week to teach four days worth of
<a href="http://perltraining.com.au/">Perl Training</a>.  Sydney courses
are always a bit of a gamble, but we've got a good attendence for our
public courses, and a new facilities vendor who is offering lower prices,
better food, and more importantly <i>more drinkable coffee</i> than
our old suppliers.
</p><p>
While I love teaching, I don't enjoy the travel, and living away from
home for another whole week isn't particularly appealing.  Jacinta's
clearly looking forward to my return as well, since with me away she'll
be responsible for letting the chickens out at 5am each morning.
</p><p>
<b>Syndicated Blogs</b><br/>
I've got <a href="http://pjf.id.au/">pjf.id.au</a> now producing an
<a href="http://pjf.id.au/blog/index.rss">RSS feed</a> of my journal.
This is nothing short of pure narcissism, and rather pointless
narcissism at that, since I'll have no chance to write in my journal
while I'm away interstate.  Nevertheless, it's done.  There's even
a link on the <a href="http://pjf.id.au/blog/">journal navigation</a>
to add it as a Mozilla sidebar tab.
</p><p>
<b>Training Calendar</b><br/>
<a href="http://perltraining.com.au/">Perl Training Australia</a>
has just finished determining its
<a href="http://perltraining.com.au/calendar.html">public training calendar</a>
for 2005.  We're still finalising a few details near the end of the
year, but it looks like I'll be keeping out of trouble for some time.
Included is a <a href="http://perltraining.com.au/webdev.html">new course</a>
on web development, which will be focusing on using HTML::Mason,
along with plenty of practical exercises.
</p><p>
Our (obviously private) calendar of corporate bookings is also filling
up, with banks and government being the most active seekers of training
at this time.
