<p><p><b>More Diving</b><br/>
Leaving soon for my dive trip.  While performing pre-flight checks on all my equipment, I discovered a pressure gauge that rattled.  Now, most pressure gauges do rattle when they're not pressurized, but this one rattles noticably more.  It was working fine last time I dived, but maybe it got damaged in transport, or got dropped when it was in for servicing?  Maybe it's fine, and has always rattled like that.
</p><p>
Normally I would just cycle down to the nearest dive shop, have a chat to the staff there, pop the gauge onto a tank of air and make sure it gives a good reading.  Unfortunately, it's holiday season, and all the dive shops I could possibly reach are closed before I take off for a few days on a boat.
</p><p>
I'm going to contact the boat operator and ask if they can bring an extra set of regs, or just another pressure gauge, just in case this one is having problems.
</p><p>
Going to be a pain if the gauge is broken, luckily I believe I still have all the warranty papers to go with it.
