<p><p><b>Speaking at linux.conf.au 2007</b><br />
Every year I do an excellent job of getting my talks rejected from <a href="http://linux.conf.au/">linux.conf.au</a>.  That's not surprising, the LCA competition is tough, and lots of people want to speak.  This year, rather than just submitting a few talks, I instead took a shotgun approach.  I submitted six, ranging from Perl, to mind control, to presentation skills and business management.  To my great delight, my talk on starting an open source business was accepted.  As it happens, I discovered that I knew a few people on the review committee, and I have no doubt this helped somewhat.
</p><p>
According to the acceptance letter, 80% of all proposals were refused.  Since I submitted six, I guess that makes my acceptance rate "typical".  ;)  I'm going to have to remember this trick for next time.

Yeah, but suppose you submit a bunch of talks and they are all accepted...<br><br>And don't think that adding a note saying you only want to give one or two talks helps, because apparently nobody reads those!<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-\

I suppose I'd have to present all of them.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)  Many of the talk proposals were highly polished presentations I'd given at other conferences and to different audiences.  I wouldn't be developing six different talks from scratch.

I look forward to seeing you at OSDC in December!
