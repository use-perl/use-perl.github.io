<p><p><b>BarCampMelbourne2008 summary</b><br />
Yesterday was <a href="http://barcampmelbourne.org/">BarCampMelbourne2008</a>, a one-day un-conference held in the city.  For those who haven't been to a BarCamp before, everyone arrives, writes down talk ideas on sticky-notes, and a timetable is put together on the day.  BarCamp Melbourne was organised by <a href="http://benbalbo.com/">Ben Balbo</a>, who did an outstanding job at pulling it all together.
</p><p>
Good things about the un-conference was that it was free to attend, had a central location, and had free food and beer.  Bad things were that the aircon had a hard time coping with 60 people plus machines plus projectors, the lack of gender balance, and the hangover when I woke up this morning.
</p><p>
I managed to do three full-length talks throughout the day, and squeezed three lightning talks into a six-minute timeslot at the end, resulting in the occasional joke that perhaps I should just take a stream to myself.  My first (and best) talk was voted best presentation, and I was given my choice of <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/">SitePoint</a> books as a prize.  I think I'm going to have to stop accepting prizes for speaking, just as soon as conferences stop offering prizes that are really cool or useful. ;)
</p><p>
As usual, the conference came with learning experiences for me.  Always pack extra business cards, know your audience (I suspect my talk on Perl 5.10 went over a few too many heads), make sure you're not competing with cool-sounding talks, and don't hesitate to put lies in your talk description to gain a bigger crowd.
</p><p>
The downside of me doing so many presentations is that I spent most of my time preparing for them, and not enough time watching other people's talks.  This seems to have become my natural state at conferences now.  The big up-side of all my air time is that it makes social networking so much easier, and I enjoy meeting both new and old friends at conferences very much indeed.  Right now I have a wallet full of business cards with scribbled notes on them to go through.
</p><p>
The after-party was most enjoyable, and included a race against a failing laptop battery to <a href="http://pjf.jaiku.com/presence/27025305">try and get Ben a jaiku account</a>, a demonstration of <a href="http://www.flightgear.org/">open source flight sims</a> and custom control hardware, much talk about the open source training market, <a href="http://perltraining.com.au/talks/whirlwind/">half a talk</a> (fullscreen suggested) on <a href="http://www.masonhq.com/">HTML::Mason</a>, a signing of my new book by one of the authors, and many pints of beer sponsored by <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/">Microsoft</a>.
