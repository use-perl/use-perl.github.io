Bloodwork came back normal.  I'm remaining cautiously optimisitic, but have defensively booked a cardiologist appointment anyway.
</p>
<p><b>3am in Sydney (new ipod)</b><br />
I'm up in Sydney teaching Perl for the third time in four weeks.
This is such a common occurrence that it's not normally even
worth blogging about unless there's a
<a href="http://sydney.pm.org/">Sydney.pm</a> meeting (which there is tonight).  However
this visit is very special, and all due to an incident that
occured yesterday morning.
</p><p>
After waking in the middle of the night and discovering my pillow
could be more comfortable, I raided the cupboard in my hotel room
for alternative bedding.  While grabbing a fresh pillow a small item
fell from the shelf and landed on my foot.  I placed it beside
my bed and slept until my alarm woke me.
</p><p>
To my delight, I discovered the item was an <i>ipod nano</i> with
4Gb of storage.  It had been sitting on the top shelf of the cupboard,
completely out of sight, and probably out of reach except that it
got dragged out with my pillow.  No doubt it belonged to one of
the previous hotel guests.  I found myself wondering what they were like.
</p><p>
In fact, one can tell quite a lot about a person from their music
player.  In this particular case, I know that the previous owner's
name was probably <i>Jamie</i>, and he likes gangsta rap, bourbon,
motorcycles and porn.  Jamie also didn't have the foresight to
include a contact number or address.  Real shame that, since it doesn't give me a good way to return it.  Guess I'll have to hang on to it for now.
</p>

Err, couldn't you just return it to the reception desk, who presumably know the names of everyone who stayed in that room since the year dot?<br>

<p>
Absolutely.  Although depending upon the moral fibre of the reception staff, it may or may not actually get back to the original owner.  I'm sure there are some hotel staff who would gladly pocket an ipod that was handed in as lost.
</p> <p>
A more optimal solution is to ask reception if there's been a report of any lost property in the room, or to put me in touch with any prior occupant named Jamie.  The true owner of the device should be able to describe colour, contents, and other attributes without much difficulty.  This provides the more favourable default that if the owner cannot be found, I'm the new owner.
</p> <p>
The hotel reception actually has a very odd staffing policy, which means that the only time we can effectively talk to them is in the early mornings.  This has been thwarting my attempts to discuss findings of goodies with them thus far.
