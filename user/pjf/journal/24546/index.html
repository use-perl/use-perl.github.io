<p><p><b>A moment of rest</b><br/>
The next month is pretty busy, with short-staffing and training courses.  However I do have a small moment of rest before that starts.  Both Friday (tomorrow) and Monday will be spent in my own office, and while I don't have a hope of completing the huge amount of work that I have outstanding, I expect to complete a significant portion.
</p><p>
Yes, I'm calling work "rest".  It's restful in comparison to the remainder of the month.  There's also the weekend, which will probably also be spent "resting".
</p><p>
<b>SAGE-AU 2005</b><br/>
I've been accepted as both a tutorial presenter and technical speaker (with a double-slot) at <a href="http://www.sage-au.org.au/conf/sage-au2005/index.html">SAGE-AU 2005</a>.  While the tutorial is on Perl (no surprise there), the presentation is on the joys of starting a small business, and how it can be very different to what most people expect.  I've got plenty to write about, my main challenge (as always) is judging my audience.
</p><p>
For those who haven't attended a SAGE-AU conference before, they tend to be extremely well catered, and be filled with incredibly clueful people.  It helps that this year has a lagoon, heated swimming pool, beach, and five-star accomodation.
</p></p>

Argh.  Of all the years I can't go, this would be one of them.  {sigh}
<p>
Hopefully, next year will be earlier in the year again (why getting so much later, so that it conflicts with other things I do), and I'll get to go (instead of being denied my visa like last year).</p>

Hmm, let me look at <a href="http://www.stonehenge.com/merlyn/dot-plan.txt" title="stonehenge.com">your schedule</a stonehenge.com>:  <a href="http://www.dragoncon.org/" title="dragoncon.org">Dragon*Con</a dragoncon.org>, followed by two <a href="http://www.geekcruises.com/" title="geekcruises.com">GeekCruises</a geekcruises.com>, including Perl Whirl where you are a speaker.
</p> <p>
It's a tough choice: the world's largest SF&amp;F convention followed by a cruise in the Caribbean, or hanging out down under with Australia's best and brightest SysAdmins.  I can certainly understand how you'd be dissapointed, since I clearly have the better deal.
</p> <p>
I'm not quite sure of change in conference dates this year for <a href="http://www.sage-au.org.au/conf/sage-au2005/" title="sage-au.org.au">SAGE-AU</a sage-au.org.au>.  I think it was due to a conflict with another conference, but I'm afraid that I can't for the life of me remember which one.
</p> <p>
If you do want an excuse to travel back to Australia, then the next <a href="http://www.osdc.com.au/" title="osdc.com.au">YAPC::AU/OSDC</a osdc.com.au> is in the works, although I suspect the dates will end up conflicting with <a href="http://www.usenix.org/events/lisa05/" title="usenix.org">LISA</a usenix.org>.  If not then I hope that I'll have the chance to see you at SAGE-AU 2006.
