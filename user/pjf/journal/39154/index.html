<p><p><b>Dubai Adventures - Day 1</b><br />
<i>I'm posting my adventures out-of-order, apologies for any chronological confusion caused.  The events in this blog post happened yesterday.</i>
</p><p>
Last night I flew back to Dubai after my stint teaching Perl in
Saudi Arabia.  On the flight one of the Emirates stewards recognised
me from my Australian flight, and we shared a few friendly words.
Another seemed to take a shine to me and somehow produced the best
coffee I've had all week; I suspect they have an espresso machine
hidden away somewhere that they only bring out for special occasions.
As such, even though my flight arrived at 2am, I was awake and happy.
</p><p>
Dubai airport has free wireless, which is something I am deeply
grateful for.  Using the amazing power of VoIP I called home (where
it was a sensible time), and had a lovely chat with Jacinta.
Amusingly, the call cost me much less than if I were in Australia
making the same call from a mobile.
</p><p>
Eventually, with my e-mail updated and my social meter refilled,
I caught a taxi to my hotel.  It's a three-star apartment hotel in
the Bur Dubai district, which I had picked because it was cheap,
and looked like it was close to busses, souks, and the museum.  I
arrived, and pretty much collapsed into bed.
</p><p>
The hotel is right next to a mosque, and I had heard from a few
reviews that one can expect to be woken up with the call to prayer.
Sure enough, a few hours after I had gone to sleep, I could hear
soft, dulcet tones calling the faithful to awake with the first light
and gather for prayer.  I stirred only a little and smiled; the
call was very soft, and very musical, this wouldn't cause me to
lose any sleep at all.  Then the mosque outside my window started
its call to prayer, with the volume cranked to eleven.
</p><p>
Looks like I'll be waking at first light tomorrow.
</p><p>
The hotel itself been really good.  Being an apartment-hotel, I have
cooking facilities, the most important for me are a kettle and
microwave.  It also has a washing machine, and I've taken the
opportunity to wash some of my clothes.  My biggest complaint is
that like many hotels, it <i>does</i> have in-room Internet access,
and it costs a fortune.  There also seems to be an expectation that
guests leave their keys at reception when leaving the hotel (maybe
people have lost or disappeared with them?), but since nobody has
taken the time to explain that to me, I've been taking my keys with
me.
</p><p>
Today I woke reasonably late, enjoyed a long hot shower, and
prepared myself some maps to help me get around.  I'd figured that
on my first day I'd explore the local district (old Dubai), and on
the second day I'd explore further away (new Dubai).  A few people
had mentioned that walking in Dubai in the middle of the day is
unwise, but I like walking, and I like hot weather, so how bad can
it be?
</p><p>
About 45'C (113'F) and <i>humid</i> is the answer.  I had packed plenty of
water, and stuck to the shade, so I got a few good hours of
walking in before I decided to find a bus-stop for a rest.  Bus-stops
in Dubai are wonderfully civilized, since they're air-conditioned.
Unfortunately mine didn't have wireless access.
</p><p>
The main problem with trying to see Bur Dubai during the middle of
the day is that everyone else is smart enough to go and do something
else when it's that hot, and so with the exception of lunch venues and
supermarkets, eveything was closed, even the malls!  This was a bit
of a disappointment as I had found the museum, but it was also closed.
I hope to get in early tomorrow.
</p><p>
While I was in Saudi Arabia, my colleagues there told me that more
foreigners live in Dubai than locals.  I now believe them!  Exploring
Bur Dubai felt more like exploring India.  I too was obviously
something peculiar; I was a westerner, I had long hair, and I was
walking in the middle of the day in Dubai.  Any one of those
attributes was out-of-the-ordinary, so at times I felt that I was
positively head-turning.
</p><p>
To be honest, I enjoyed the attention.  Most of what I was were
smiles; a few people asked where I was from, and what it was like
in Australia, and why I was walking in the middle of the day when
everyone sensible was out of the sun and having a rest.
</p><p>
Walking through Bur Dubai took me to the fabric souk, but most of it
was closed.  I'm not much of a clothing/fabrics person, so that didn't
bother me too much.  It also took me to Dubai Creek, which is a
fascinating and enchanting throng of activity.  Water taxis dart
back and forth, larger dhows and other vessels travel up and down,
and somehow nobody collides with anyone else.
</p><p>
From here I returned to my room and had a snooze, but my evening
walk took me back to the creek.  I took a water taxi across for
the standard fare of 1 dirham (about $0.30), and set out to explore
Deira, the old parts of Dubai north of the creek.
</p><p>
In Bur Dubai, there were an endless number of shops.  I walked along
"Computer Street" and past "Bank Street" in my travels.  I found
streets that were filled with eateries, and filled with clothing
stores.  In Deira, the streets were also filled with shops, but it
felt like they had been randomly generated.  There's be stores
selling mobile phones, car tyres, bedding, motorcycles, computers,
food, movies, whitegoods, furniture, electronics, beauty products,
and fish, all next to each other.  Many seemed to have equally
random names, my favourite of which was "Moist Flower Electronics".
The streets were twisty-turvy little things, and I soon found myself
lost, and not for the first (nor the last) time that day.
</p><p>
I don't really mind being lost in other cities.  It means I get to see
things I didn't plan, and in Dubai in particular, I can always hail
a taxi to take me back to my hotel.  So I continued onwards, hoping
to find the Gold Souk that I had marked on my map, but really happy
with anything.
</p><p>
I eventually found myself at the Hyatt hotel and its attached mall,
because I wanted a break from the heat, and I had discovered my
map of Dubai had lacked public toilets.  Inside the mall was an
ice-skating rink, and while I didn't skate, it sure was nice to
be in a cool environment again.  Most other things were closed, so
after I had made myself more comfortable, I decided to go exploring
again.
</p><p>
Without too much travel, I found myself at the Dubai fish market,
a place which I was able to discover by its unique scent alone.
In Australia, I'm used to fish markets generally being indoors, and
air-conditioned.  I think the market had one air-conditioned
building, and that was filled with people in the process of preparing
the fish for sale (sorting, gutting, filleting, etc).  Most of the
other stalls had generous amounts of ice to keep the fish cold.
</p><p>
I honestly can't do the fish market justice with words.  There are
people <i>everywhere</i>.  There are fish, <i>everywhere</i>.  The
quantity of fish and people dwarfed anything I've seen in Australia.
</p><p>
The most striking image of the market was outside, where a huge line
of sharks were lined up outside; I can only assume for transport,
since nobody seemed to be buying them.  While it appeared that were
once on ice, the ice had since melted, so it felt like I had walked
out into some strange land where dead sharks are a natural feature
on the pavement.  I couldn't help but snapping a few photographs,
and some of the locals (who had also been photographing them) started
a conversation with me.  Apparently it's this busy every day,
and that if I think it's hot now, I should try coming back in August!
</p><p>
From the fish market I wandered along the foreshore, which seems to
be an extremely popular location if you're male and from south asia.
I got to see the port and some large cargo vessels, but it wasn't
particularly scenic.  I crossed the road and visited "Gold Mart",
since Dubai is renowned for its gold markets.
</p><p>
Gold Mart, as I was to discover, was not the Gold Souk, but a
collection of jewellery stores.  At this point I would discover that
a great many store owners thought I might like to buy a watch,
or a belt, or sunglasses, or numerous other items that I wasn't
interested in.
</p><p>
I left the Gold Mart, and a guy by the door assured me that he had
the greatest collection of pirated and counterfeit goods I could wish
for.  I walked down the street, and at every corner I was offered
a fake rolex for sale.  I eventually <i>found</i> the Gold Souk,
which really is awesome, but I could hardly move without someone
approaching me with offers of counterfeit merchandise.  To the
vendors' credit, they were always very up-front about the lack of
authenticity.
</p><p>
The Gold Souk is home to the world's "heaviest gold ring", which is
a glittering monstronsity that weighs about as much as I do.  It also
really does have a massive amount of gold on sale, in the form of
ingots, chains, rings, bracelets, necklaces, earrings, and many other
forms.  It was <i>very</i> sparkly.
</p><p>
From the Gold Souk, I made my way back to the creek, and discovered
a stall specialising in perfumes and incenses.  As my mother-in-law
put in a special request to bring her back some frankincense, I
took the opportunity to investigate.  I could get a small amount for
5 dirhams, a reasonable amount (100g) for 15, or a huge amount (500g)
for 55.  I opted for huge, and haggling, and got the price down to 45
dirhams, about $15 for 500g.  I actually have no idea if that's
a good price, and probably should have haggled more.
</p><p>
With the frankincense in my inventory, and the hope that I can bring
it through customs in my head, I caught another water taxi across
the river, and walked back to my hotel.  On the way, I discovered
an Internet cafe close to my hotel that assured me I could plug in my
laptop, at the rate of 10 AED/hr (about AUD $3.30/hr).  While that's
more expensive than downtown Bur Dubai (2 AED/hr, or 4 AED/hr if you
want a seat), it's a lot less expensive than the paid hotspots (15
AED/hr), and considerably cheaper than the hotel (35 AED/hr).  I
suspect I'll be visiting that cafe a lot.
</p><p>
My day ends with blogging, coffee, and a soak in the bath.  With Day 1
of Dubai over, I've walked somewhere in the realm of 15km, and spent
about 100 dirhams (about $35 AUD), excluding the hotel.  Tomorrow,
I plan to visit the museum early, and then head south to new Dubai.

Although the receptionist said it was because people lose their keys, I wondered if it was also a security measure to prevent people from copying them. (They were magnetic stripe keys, but I suppose they could be reverse engineered.)</p>
