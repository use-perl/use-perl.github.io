<p><b>Snorkling</b><br/>
Went snorkling under Rye pier, looked at wetsuits and made friends with the lovely lovely staff at <i>Aquatic Adventures</i>, who were generous enough to let us use their changerooms.  Would have loved to explore more of the pier than we did, but a forest of fishing lines made that too dangerous.
</p><p>
We had plenty of people on the pier interested on what was underneath, and we chatted somewhat about the local wildlife.  Given that all one really needs is a mask and snorkle, I'm surprised more people don't go exploring their piers.
</p><p>
<b>Trams</b><br/>
Discovered that Melbourne's tram stop displays run on Linux, as we caught one rebooting on the way home.  Jacinta was fast enough to catch a photograph of an upside down Tux before the display clearly started-up Xwindows.
</p><p>
As an interesting aside, the rail displays in Sydney run on Windows, as we caught one after a blue screen of death the last time we were up there.
</p><p>
I have no idea why my presence causes public transport IT infrastructure to malfunction.

<h2>Windows BSOD in public</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ajt/">ajt</a> on 2005-04-09T14:06:23</h3>
<p>Lots of stuff in the UK seems to run on Windows. It's not unusual for the public displays in my local station to have BSODed, and the EPOS system that Sainsbury's use is Windows 2K based, and that BSOD quite often, and/or needs to be rebooted to be usable.</p>

<p>I don't nessesarily believe that Linux is the best solution for everything, but a buggy closed source general purpose desktop OS is hardly suited to many of the places M$ have pushed it.... I find it really scary when it's a cash machine that's BSODed....!</p>
