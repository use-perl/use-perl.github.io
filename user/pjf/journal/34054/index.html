<p><p><b>Open Source Developers Club</b><br />
Last night we had another <a href="http://www.osdc.com.au/osdclub/">Open
Source Developers Club</a> (OSDClub) meeting.  I had volunteered
my talk on <a href="http://www.osdc.com.au/osdclub/200708/history_of_failure.html">An Illustrated History of Failure</a>, and
Simon Hildebrant had volunteered a talk on <a href="http://www.osdc.com.au/osdclub/200708/selenium.html">Selenium</a>.
</p><p>
The night seemed to go well, but I can't help but be disappointed
with my performance.  I've been teaching all this week, and this
is extremely time consuming.  Waking up very early and then standing
in front of a class for eight hours can sure be tiring, but that's not
the real problem.  After a full day of teaching, the last thing I want
to be doing is spending an hour or more rehearsing my talk.  I'd much
rather be playing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pikmin">Pikmin</a> (thanks Ian!), or mucking
with <a href="http://technorati.com/people/technorati/pfenwick">technorati</a>, or even watching commercial TV.
This is especially the case when I've been teaching roughly every
second week for the last two months.
</p><p>
I hold myself to a particularly high standard when it comes to
presentations.  Presenting is my job, and if I flub my lines or
forget my slide order, then I'm extremely unhappy.  For anyone
who noticed my errors last night, I apologise.  For anyone who
didn't notice, thank-you.  You're a great audience.
</p><p>
Simon's presentation last night was on testing the web with
<a href="http://www.openqa.org/selenium/">Selenium</a>, which is an awesome tool, and which has lots of ways
to plug into TAP and other testing frameworks.  There were some
interesting ideas being thrown around about how one can use
Selenium to provide repeatable test cases for web applications,
the same way that one would provide test cases when submitting
a bug report for a traditional application.
</p><p>
The discussion got me thinking more about what if one finds a bug, but can't get it fixed.  It's a good introduction to my next talk, which is
<i>Fixing the web with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greasemonkey">Greasemonkey</a></i>.  
</p>

<h2>didn't notice, thought it was a good, fun talk</h2>

i had hoped that simon would get a chance to talk more about selenium RC, but there was a lot of ground to cover and he did so very well.



<h2>Slides?</h2>

So where are the History of Failure slides? It sounds interesting but the odds I'll be able to see you do this in person are vanishingly small. I don't want to have to wait decades just to perhaps be in the right place at the right time to get the information from your presentation.

Most of my presentations (including this one) are designed to be run with a <i>real person</i> presenting them.  As an example, the failure talk is 150 slides in about 25 minutes, and a lot of those are pictures.  It is <i>not</i> death by powerpoint.  Unless you're hearing the talk, the pictures don't make (as much) sense, and you'll be disappointed.  I don't want that.
</p> <p>
I'm currently looking at using <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/faqs/slidecast" title="slideshare.net">SlideCasting</a slideshare.net> to put the slides online synchronized with my audio.  If I can get that working, then it will <i>definitely</i> be mentioned in my blog.

That's kind of unfortunate. A benefit of death by powerpoint is that the information is portable and doesn't require a human to perform.
