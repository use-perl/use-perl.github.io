<p><p><b>My strange working habits</b><br />
After far too long on the road, I've been in Melbourne for a whole week.  In theory, I get to spend at least another 10 days here before my next flight, which (provided the last piece of paperwork gets signed) will be to Saudi Arabia.
</p><p>
This week, when it comes to interesting FOSS stuff, I've done absolutely nothing.  What I've discovered is that when I'm on the road, I keep squeezing in bits of work around the edges.  A lot of my coding gets done in departure lounges, and for my last trips to Canberra, on a bus.  However when I'm home, I can <i>relax</i>.  I can sleep in, be comfortable, and have <a href="http://identi.ca/notice/4712036">long, drawn-out breakfasts</a>.  I have friends, real ones, that I can see and spend time with.  In short, I have all the things of which I've been completely deprived while travelling.
</p><p>
While this is great for recharging my batteries, it's not great in terms of deliverable productivity.  If you're waiting on me to complete or review a piece of code, you have my most sincere apologies.  Feel free to keep nudging me, it does help.
</p>

<p>
Actually, back-to-back flights to <i>conferences</i> (with a few weeks at home before each one) tends to be my most productive environment.  I'm almost always giving at least one presentation, and that's usually about whatever "new" thing I've been working on.  Usually that's not finished when at the time I submitted the proposal, so there's oft a frantic time beforehand to make sure that my code matches my slides.
