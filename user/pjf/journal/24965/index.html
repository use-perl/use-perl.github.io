<p><p><b>Luxury!</b></p><p>
I have time!
</p><p>
After what seems months of ending training, fire-fighting, software-development, and paperwork, I finally have a more free and flexible schedule.  It's glorious!  I slept in the other day, have been playing network games, writing conference papers, and otherwise having a wonderful time.
</p><p>
Sure, clients still call <i>all the time</i>, but with simple things that are easy to diagnose and fix.  No big disasters, no crushing deadlines.  It's just great.
</p><p>
Now, I have a big pile of work that hasn't been done because I'd been so busy.  Some of that's quite important, and it looks like I'll be able to knock it over with plenty of time to spare.  That's a really good thing, because it's means no painful deadline crunches later on.
</p><p>
I've even got confirmation that my replacement wetsuit is on its way, although I'm somewhat unconvinced about cold-water diving in winter.
</p><p>
Unsurprisingly, my body has reacted to all this wonderful time and relaxation by catching a very minor cold.  I don't know why people get sick when they <i>stop</i> being stressed and busy, but it's certainly more convenient then the other way around.
