<p><p><b>Linux.con f.au - Aftermath</b><br />
My talk on Thursday at linux.conf.au was very well attended, and received a very
good reception indeed.  For both Thursday and Friday I seemed to
have no lack of attendees wishing to ask or comment on my talk;
it seems my biggest failure was that I didn't come equipped with
sufficient business cards, and I found myself having to start
rationing them.
</p><p>
Friday morning I participated in the Speakers' Adventure.  I'd
heard a variety of reports on what this would be; the official
documentation suggested heights, but Adam Kennedy had suggested
it involved a swim at the aquarium, and Jamie on the organisation
committee also backed up this story.  As such, I arrived at
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_Tower">Sydney Tower</a> with mask, snorkel, and underwater camera.  Thanks guys, they were really useful 250m in the air. ;)
</p><p>
The keynote on Friday was presented by Kathy Sierra.  Essentially
a talk on how to grow communities, Kathy covered how we're all
fitted out with "legacy brains" that still react to stimulae that
were important when we were living in caves.  Kathy put her knowledge
of legacy brains to good use in her talk, providing a good example
of how presentations should be done.
</p><p>
LCA have been putting up a talk of <a href="http://lca2007.linux.org.au/Programme">talks on-line</a>, including <a href="http://mirror.linux.org.au/pub/linux.conf.au/2007/video/talks/322.ogg">mine</a>.
Talks are in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theora">Ogg Theora</a> format, so make sure you have an appropriate client if you want to view them.
