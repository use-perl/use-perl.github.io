<b>End of Financial Year</b><br>
Well, it's the end of financial year, and I have an incredible
amount of paperwork that requries filling in.  Tomorrow is devoted
to the task.
</p><p>
Most of the work is just plain accounting.  I need to catch up on
all the paperwork for two businesses over the last quarter.  Luckily,
one of those businesses has ceased operation, as it's been
restructured into the second business.
</p><p>
1st July 2004 will also represent my first day as a normal employee
again.  My own tax return for 2004-05 will be boring and simple, rather
than the incredible task that it is now.  Sure, I own the business that
I work for, so not too much has changed, but it will make my life
easier.  I'm looking forward to that a lot.
</p><p>
<B>YAPC::AU::2004/OSDC</B><BR>
We've had an incredible number of talks submitted for
<a href="http://www.osdc.com.au/">YAPC::AU::2004/OSDC</a>.  We're
going to have a very full schedule, which makes me very happy.
Now the programme committee (which includes me), needs to figure
out who is talking and when.  I'm not looking forward to that.
</p><p>
<B>Make it faster</B><BR>
I'm spending most of this week with an old client of mine, optimizing
code.  This is something I really enjoy, and I suspect the reason that
I'm back is that I've pulled a few miracle speed improvements at
this client in the past.
</p><p>
I'm working right next to <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/scott/">Scott
Penrose</a>, which is really enjoyable.  I get to see Scotty a lot
on <a href="http://melbourne.pm.org/">Melbourne.PM</a> and
<a href="http://www.osdc.com.au.">YAPC::AU/OSDC</a> matters, but it's
been years since we've actually worked together.
</p><p>
A few hours of today was spent writing C code that both calls and is
called by Perl, and then making the darn thing compile under an older
compiler on a different box.  The result was a 50-70% increase in speed
for the code in question, depending upon the benchmarks used, and a
lot more learnt about juggling SVs.  Overall a very productive
experience.
