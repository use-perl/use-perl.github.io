<b>Melbourne/Australia Perl Happenings</b><br/>
It seems that some individuals read my journal to hear about the latest happenings in the Perl scene in Melbourne and other parts of Australia.  With that in mind, I believe that I should mention a few recent events.
</p><p>
<a href="http://melbourne.pm.org/">Melbourne Perl Mongers</a> has restarted, and our first meeting for the year had discussions about <a href="http://www.osdc.com.au/">OSDC/YAPC::AU 2004</a>, the <a href="http://qa.perl.org/phalanx/100/">Phalanx 100</a>, an offer from yours truly to talk about <a href="http://www.masonhq.com/">HTML::Mason</a>, and the discussion of starting up combined open-source developer meetings, affectionately known at this stage as <i>Open Source Developers Club</i>.  OSDClub is currently arranged for every second month, instead of Melb.PM.
</p><p>
I volunteered to try and rejuvenate the Melb.PM website (which is currently down), although I'm currently waiting to receive the appropriate keys from the relevant people inside Melb.PM.
</p><p>
Last Friday was <a href="http://securecon.unimelb.edu.au/">SecureCon</a>, which Jacinta and myself attended, and discovered that all the usual suspects were there.  There were large contingents from <a href="http://www.sage-au.org.au/">SAGE-AU</a>, including Baden Hughes from <a href="http://www.perlfoundation.org/">The Perl Foundation</a>.  Practically all the SAGE-AU members there had submitted proposals for the next SAGE-AU conference, or were on the reviewing committee, or both.  There were a couple of <a href="http://www.linuxchix.org/">LinuxChix</a>, a group from <a href="http://www.2600.org.au/">2600</a>, and all the old <a href="http://www.unimelb.edu.au/">Melbourne University</a> computer science crowd.
</p><p>
The weekend was spent on a new project that focuses on the Australian Perl community, which is active but fragmented.  I'm hoping to reduce community fragmentation and produce a way that all Australian entities (including businesses, user groups, and invididuals) can communicate more effectively.  Stay tuned for more details (and hopefully a beta in the next couple of weeks).
