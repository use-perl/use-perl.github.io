<p><p><b>Rant: The pains of publishing talks</b><br />
I've just spent about 16 hours in utter frustration <i>trying</i> to publish my dinner keynote from OSDC 2007.  Normally I'd use <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/pjf">SlideShare</a> for this, as I've done with some previous talks, but I've found it simply can't handle my presentation. Here's why:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Slides of more than 30MB are not accepted.  Mine is 36MB, even after slimming down the slides (I got around this by exporting PDF).</li>
<li>The slide editor insists that each slide is a beautiful snowflake that deserves at least five seconds worth of display time.  I have large sequence where I'm displaying each slide for perhaps 1-2 seconds each.</li>
<li>The editing application only allows one to go forward/back one slide at a time.  I have 275 slides, so navigation is extremely time-consuming.</li>
<li>The timing application is buggy, and regularly stops responding to changes to slide transitions.  In fact, I've reached the point where I can't edit any slide times at all, and with about 100 slides to go.</li>
</ul>
<p>
So, I thought I'd do things the old fashioned way.  I'll grab my audio, drop it into some video editing software, import my slides (as images or whatever), and tweak the timings.
</p><p>
However everything I've found is buggy, completely sucks in the usability department, or both.
</p><p>
I use Windows on my laptop, and thought that the <i>Windows Movie Maker</i> might do a passable job.  It looks like it <i>should</i> do a passable job, but it crashes whenever I try to move more than eight slides into my project.  I've tried to use Jashaka, but I've found the interface to be opaque, and nothing to work how I expect.  My futile attempts at searching for something decent has resulted in large lists of what look like dodgy commercial tools, or unfinished FOSS projects.
</p><p>
I swear things shouldn't be this hard.
</p><p>
So, this is a lazyweb post.  What free (as in beer or speech, for Windows or Linux) software would <i>you</i> recommend for taking an mp3 file, adding a bunch of images (or OOo slides), adjusting the timings, and outputting a file format I can upload to youtube or google video?  If you're reading this on use.perl, then feel free to add your comments there, otherwise drop me an e-mail at <a href="mailto:pjf@pjf.id.au">pjf@pjf.id.au</a>.

<h2>Screencast?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Alias/">Alias</a> on 2008-01-29T06:56:57</h3>
Use screen capture software and export to flash?



<h2>Quicktime Pro</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jj/">jj</a> on 2008-01-29T09:48:16</h3>
<p>See <a href="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/pro" title="apple.com">http://www.apple.com/quicktime/pro</a apple.com>
</p>
<p>OK, it's not free, but it is available for Windows as well as OS X and only costs about the same as a round of drinks.
</p>
<p>You can get very small file sizes - using AAC for audio and H.264 for video a 1m30s screencast with voice over came in at less than 900Kb, of which the audio track was 256Kb.
