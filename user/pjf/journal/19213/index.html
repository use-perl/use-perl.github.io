<p>I'm back in Melbourne, which is nice.  And it's a long weekend, which is nicer.<br/><br/>The Sydney course went off very well. Despite all the frustration at the airport, our class went smoothly and our attendees gave us practically full-marks in all areas.  All but one opted to stick around later to hear me talk about taint checks and modules.<br/><br/>Half of them stuck around an extra hour (well beyond the formal close of class and the facilities we were using) to talk about mod_perl, RT, Maypole, and other technologies.  When students are that eager to learn more it's a good sign you're doing something right as a trainer.<br/><br/>Bumped into Arjen Lentz and Jonathon Coombes who were presenting a MySQL course in the room next door.  I meant to arrange to catch up with them afterwards, but I spent so long after the class chatting to our attendees about Perl that I missed them entirely.<br/><br/>The doughnuts from the store with the incredible queue of customers were just like eating fairy floss (cotton candy) turned into a fried dough product.  I'm still reeling from the sugar the next day.<br/><br/>The meeting with a potential client at lunch went well.  I've been given a few demonstration copies of their product.  Yes, they're written in Perl, but they're also close-source and obscured with Filter::Netcrypt.  Trying to look at the source code is a wonderful challenge to rise to, but I have a course to complete, so I'll have to do that next week.</p>
