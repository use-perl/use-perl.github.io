<p><p><b><a href="http://perl.net.au/">PerlNet</a> - The Australian and New Zealand Perl Portal</b><br />
During my travels I've discovered that the Australian and New Zealand Perl communities are very active, but also very insulated from each other.  While lots of activity can be seen in local user-groups, those groups rarely talk to each other to share ideas, code, or activities.
</p><p>
Unfortunately, having such insulated groups makes it more difficult for anyone who wants to have a better idea of the state of Perl in Australia.  I'm regularly asked "who uses Perl?", "who supports Perl?", "where can I find a Perl job?", "where can I find a Perl programmer?".  While I've often been able to answer this questions accurately and successfully, the knowledge has come from my own personal experience, and not from a freely available source.
</p><p>
In order to better encourage communication between Australian and New Zealand Perl groups, users, businesses, and organisations, we quietly launched <a href="http://perl.net.au/">PerlNet</a> almost a year ago.  It's been running in stealth mode since that time, but now it's finally time to take it out into the open.
</p><p>
There'll be a formal announcement a little later on, but for those who read my journal you're welcome to get involved early.  The site is aimed at the community, we want <i>you</i> to get involved.
</p><p>
Chatter can be found on <tt>irc.freenode.net #PerlNet</tt>, and the main website at <a href="http://perl.net.au/">perl.net.au</a>.  It's a wiki, so <b>be bold</b> in your edits.

Hi Paul,
<br> <br>
I don't want to create a new user for just one edit. If you want, you can add the link to my thoughts about the OSDC 2005 in the Wiki:

Cheers,<br>

<p>
I want you to create a user for just one edit.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)  Then we can say we've had contributors from Germany in the press release.  Making an account is very, very easy.  None of this email rubbish; just pick a username and go.
</p> <p>
The whole topic of anonymous edits has been hotly debated on the IRC channel, and will probably continue to do so.  Currently they're turned off, but that may well change in the future.
</p> <p>
I'm glad to read in your write-up that you both enjoyed the conference and my talks.
</p> <p>
All the best,<br>
<i>Paul</i>
