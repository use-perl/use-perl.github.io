<p><p><b>OSDC-2006 Day 1</b><br />
Today has been the first day of <a href="http://www.osdc.com.au">OSDC</a>.
My Perl 5.10 talk appeared to be received acceptably well, and I was
humbled and honoured that Randal provided positive feedback.  I consider
today's talk my "poor" talk, and hope that I'll see a good crowd for
my Friday talk, which I consider superior.
</p><p>
Jose Castro (cog) was scheduled with all <i>three</i> of his talks
in the first day, and I admire his ability to present after a 26 hour
commute from Portugal and 11 hours of timezone difference.
</p><p>
The highlight for the day was the dinner.  Damian Conway's
<i>Da Vinci Codebase</i> was awesomely fantastic.  I mean, Damian's
talks are normally awesome, but this really went above and beyond.
If you get a chance to see it at another conference, see it.  Wow.
</p><p>
The dinner continued with many jugs of <i>diet beer</i> (just
like regular beer, but with "diet" written on the jug), and a
discovery that Adam Kennedy covets the <tt>Acme::Playmate</tt>
module.  Actually, that's not quite fair.  Adam wants to write a module
that looks up stats on Playmates and allows you to print patterns so
you can crochet clothing for your favourite model.  I suspect there'll
be a lightning talk very very soon.
</p><p>
Other features of the day included catching up with Skud and watching
her music videos, and catching up with an incredible number of people
who I haven't seen since last OSDC.  
</p>
