<p>Life is indeed too short to waste it on inconsequentialities.<br><br>
My dogs woke me up this morning, about 4 a.m., barking at a loud diesel noise coming from the street.<br>
<br>
When I went to see what they were barking at, there was an ambulance across the street. It was followed, shortly thereafter, by a police car.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, my neighbor's wife had passed away, shortly before 4, while going to get a glass of water (her son assumes).  Her son and his wife were visiting, and found Ellen on the floor, where the coroner said she had probably been for an hour or more, dead of a cerebral stroke.<br>
<br>
This makes me really regret the small fight I had with my wife the night before last, as you never really can tell what might happen.  I think I will try to be nicer to everyone from now on.<br></p>

It's a good dog that wakes you up at 4 AM to warn you that you're life is passing you by and that you may not be appreciating the people in it enough.<br> <p>Make sure to give that dog and extra treat tonight.<br> </p><p>Mine just barks at the birds in the backyard.</p>

Huh, if we gave them any more treats they would want to take the bed away from us and put us in the garage.<br> They already think they are people.<br>
But, I'll be sure to tell them whom to thank tonight when they get their extra biscuit.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-&gt; <br>
