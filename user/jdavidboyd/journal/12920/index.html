<p><p>Have you ever felt stagnant and stale at your job?  After five years of working on C source, I'm getting to that point. <br>
I try to use as much Perl and Java and shell scripts, on internal utilities, as possible, just to alleviate the sameness, but it doesn't quite take care of it anymore.<br>

Boy, I was just thinking the other day that I'd like to do more C.  I did C for years and I miss it.<br> <p>I think it would be really neat to setup a big C project using <a href="http://splint.org/" title="splint.org">Splint</a splint.org>.  Setting up application specific abstract data types/objects that are automatically checked.<br> </p><p>Maybe setting up Splint with some XS data structures would be an interesting project...<br> </p><p>I'm not looking for a job trade, mind you, I doubt seriously if you'd be interested in what I'm doing now.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>

I like C just fine.<br>
My trouble comes from the fact that we are at a CMM level of approximately <b>0</b>, maybe <b>-1</b>.<br>All talks to the <i>powers that be</i> to try to implement standards, code reviews, processes, go nowhere.<br>  So, slowly, (well, not so slowly anymore), our company is dying. Ah well, it could always be worse...

<p>Write an automated testing framework for testing C.  Then start practicing Extreme Programming.  I actually thought about suggesting that just in response to the job being stale, but given the comment about CMM, I'll bet it would do even more wonders.</p>

<p>I'm actually enjoying automated testing of PL/SQL right now.</p>

I hear you and I know what you mean about getting tired of what you are working on.  I feel the same.  I guess the "Grass is always greener" is a bad Subject...
