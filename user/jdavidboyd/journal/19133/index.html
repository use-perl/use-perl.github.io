Let's see.<br> My wife has been up north for the past two weeks,
tending to her Mom, who is dying from some kind of internal
cancer.<br><br> My cousin, (not very close, but not all that distant)
is dying *soon* from a cancer that started in his mouth and has now
found it's way into his brain stem.<br><br> A buddy of mine is losing
his dad in the next few weeks to pancreatic cancer.<br><br>My company
is losing one of our biggest clients at the end of the year, they have
informed us, to go with one of our competitors.<br><br>Another one of
our clients has been unreachable since last Thursday, all we can find
out is that their office here in the states has been shut down by the
police/FAA.<br><br>Now, it seems to me that with all this going on,
the past two weeks should have gone by fairly quickly, but instead,
they are dragging by.<br><br>Two more weeks until I have to fly to
Rhode Island and drive home with Anita, and it seems as if the day
will never get here.<br><br>Then, of course, she is going to go back
up for the last several weeks of her Mom's life.  That is NOT going to
be a fun time for anyone.</p>
