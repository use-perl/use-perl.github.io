<p><p>As I was driving to work today, I saw a car coming toward me, at the head of a line of 10-15 other cars.<br><br>
The driver opened their sunroof, reached an arm up, and let go of their McDonald's bag of garbage.  Flew over the car, onto the road, and was run over by all the following cars.<br><br>
How could anyone possibly still litter this way?  Were they a total moron, brain dead, or just not caring about society, the planet, etc.<br><br>
I do not understand it, and probably never will...

Where is this, that you saw this happen?
<p>
I don't like saying nice things about Maine, but it's rare to see litter along the highways.  There's a fine, the details of which escape me, but it's something along the lines of 200/400 dollars per instance.
</p><p>
Of course, such a law means nothing without enforcement.  The cops here don't have a lot to do, so I suspect that's a good part of the reason I've never seen anyone do what you describe.</p>

Palm Harbor, Florida.<br>
It's a small city north of Clearwater, FL, which is on the west coast of FL.<br>  I live in Largo, and work in Palm Harbor.<br>
Sure surprised me to see such behavior.<br>
