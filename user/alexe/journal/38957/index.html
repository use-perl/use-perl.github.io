<p>Yes&#65292;itÃ¢â¬â¢s 1.0. It is a long time to release Screenshot from last time.
Eventually, it is released now.<br/><br/>The function of Opener Package: install the programs. It orients the stand-alone Perl programs, like NSIS.
The program consists of three elements:
1.	The main program, Setup.exe, which is capable of parsing setting.ini files, can execute relevant installations. It contains an intact interpreter and the runtime environment.
2.	The configuration file, Setting.ini, guide Setup.exe how to execute the target program for installing.
3.	The file needed to install, .Zip, waits the Setup.exe to install to the directory specified.<br/><br/>Usage: 
1. Package the installation programs you need and relevant resource files into a .zip pack, and place them in the directory in which the setup.exe lives. If there are multiple attached sections need to be installed, you can package them into multiple .zip files and place them in the directory in which the setup.exe lives. For example, Gtk runtime library.   
2. Edit setting.ini files. Based upon the examples, edit and set the option what you need, such as: registry, start menu, environment variables, etc.
WhatÃ¢â¬â¢s the most important is setting the .zip files you just package in the [File] option. For example:
[Files]
File1=setup.zip; main_run_file=perl.exe; install_dest=c: \test
file2=svn.zip; install_dest=c: \test\test<br/><br/>File1=setup.zip is the file what you packaged to be installed. install_dest=c: \test orients the directory where you default install to.
file2=svn.zip is the file need to be installed too.
3. Release the setup.exe file, the setting.ini file and the .zip file together.<br/><br/>
Feature:
1. Built-in contains the Perl interpreter, which makes the installation of Perl program much easier. Specify an installation of Perl interpreter in setting.ini file. Then, the Perl program you released can be executed directly.
2. There are relative perfect installation parts. You can set the registry, installation menu, file associations, environment variables, shortcut and autorun.
3. You can create the installer in the way of editing the simple setting.ini script. ItÃ¢â¬â¢s quite simple, you just set some values. It is quite easy to set the registry with the same format as the registry of Win32.
4. Support for the installation of multiple programs. You can install multiple .zip programs to different directories.
5. Support for multiple languages interface. Build-in support for Chinese and English.<br/><br/>
Disadvantage:
1. It runs slowly.  The Perl program , packaged by Par, runs not so fast at the first time. The installation program packages many Per1 attached modules. &#65288;In order to solve this complex problem ,we  have to study the Par itself first.&#65289;
2.  We can not package the whole installation program into a file like NSIS for a while. We divide the installation program into three files. (To solve the problem, we can create a GUI program which can create the installer.)
3. There's no uninstall program  (It isn't made yet)
4. The Perl library needed by the Perl program, which you want to install, may be not in the installation program . (Because the installation pack has been packaged before, it can't contain Per1 library all we  need. It can be solved by a GUI program of installer creating. )<br/><br/>Site: http://sites.google.com/site/openerenglish/opener-package</p>

<h2>Feedback</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/daxim/">daxim</a> on 2009-05-12T13:53:10</h3>
Running setup.exe crashes with:<blockquote><div><p> <tt>Can't locate Win32.pm in @INC (@INC contains:<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.) at -e line 762.<br>BEGIN failed--compilation aborted at -e line 947.</tt></p></div> </blockquote><p>I thought the program perhaps needs Perl installed as runtime environment, but installing Strawberry Perl does not help; I get the same error.

</p><p>Also the group <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/opener-com-work-team" title="google.com">http://groups.google.com/group/opener-com-work-team</a google.com> and its archive are not publicly accessible.</p>

I bet he forgot to include this module when creating the PAR archive.
