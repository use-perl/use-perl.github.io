<div class="span8">
<p>I just want to clarify something about my <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/autarch/journal/33175">Why I don't like TT</a> entry.<br/><br/>When reading it, don't implicitly add anything like "and therefore TT sucks", or "and therefore <em>you</em> should never use TT" at the end.<br/><br/>That was not my intent. My goal is simply to explain some issues that <em>I</em> have experienced with TT. I think they're important to consider when you look at templating systems, and these particular problems are also very much non-obvious. They're not an obvious limitation like not having some feature, rather they're fundamental design issues arising from the design of the language.<br/><br/>Similarly, my intent was not imply that because <em>I</em> don't like TT, <em>someone else</em> should use Mason. Personally, I <em>would</em> choose Mason whenever I'm given the choice, but that's done knowing its limitations and potential pitfalls, which would be a good topic for another entry.

In line with mjd's old article, <a href="http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2000/12/advocacy.html" title="perl.com">http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2000/12/advocacy.html</a perl.com>, on why he hates advocacy, where he makes similar points.<br><br>I was just reading that, led to it by a reply to a vituperative anti-perl message on a haskell list.<br><br>Ecumenicism is good. Now I just have to overcome my own commitment by trashing it and perl together<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)
