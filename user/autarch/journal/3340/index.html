<p>So earlier today I found that one of my mother's good friends had killed himself last week.<br/><br/>His partner of twenty years was killed by falling debris on 9/11.  Later, he lost his apartment (his partner made more money) and then for some reason lost his job (he worked near the WTC so that may be the explanation).<br/><br/>And to top things off, his partner's mother (with whom he had had good relations before) brought a lawsuit against him about the estate.<br/><br/>I didn't know this guy well at all, I just met him once, but he was a loud, very lively, flaming, fun guy.  Imagining how much sadness he must have felt in order to kill himself is horrible.  Plus I know my mother was very upset when his partner died, and now to have this is just awful.<br/><br/>Then I did some work on my current contract, as well as some stuff for the Mason core and the book.<br/><br/>I was pretty damn depressed by dinner but then later my wife and I went to a <a href="http://www.400bar.com/">scuzzy bar</a> to see an <a href="http://www.gorkys.com/">delightful Welsh band</a> that I had wanted to see live for a while.<br/><br/>That cheered me up, especially the song "Poodle Rockin'", which starts with the lead singer barking.<br/><br/>So now I'm up late at night typing this and I still feel pretty sad but not quite as bad as before.  That's nice, I guess.</p>
