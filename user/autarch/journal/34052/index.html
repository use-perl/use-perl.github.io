<div class="span8">
<p>I have a server at my home that hosts my email and a bunch of domains (urth.org, masonbook.com, my SVN stuff, etc). Every time I go on vacation some shit happens and my DSL connection goes south or my server goes down or something.<br/><br/>I'm on vacation now and of course it happened again. Thankfully my friend John has a key and was willing to go troubleshoot. Power-cycling the DSL modem didn't fix it, and there's not much else we can do, so he took the server to his house, which is great, but this is getting old.<br/><br/>So I was thinking "gee, I've written all this software that I know a lot of Perl people use, and lots of ISPs use Perl". So to be 100% crass, I'd really like to get some <em>cheap</em> colo or dedicated server hosting. If you work at an ISp and use some of my software and would like to help out, I'd greatly appreciate it.<br/><br/>I look at these services every time I have a server problem and at $70+/month, they're just too expensive. Yes, I know about virtual machine hosting, but I need a fair bit of RAM for the stuff on this machine (various mod_perl and other apps) so that's out.<br/><br/>Yes, I am publicaly begging ;)<br/><br/>My email is autarch@urth.org, though this may not start working 100% til my DNS change finishes propogating sometime tomorrow evening.</p>

<h2>Server Pronto?</h2>

I use Server Pronto for some personal stuff. It's $30 for a dedicated box that isn't too bad.

I did take a look at them but I need a box with at least 1GB of RAM, since I run a lot of database and mod_perl stuff. Their cheap boxes all have a pitiful amount of ram (256MB).
