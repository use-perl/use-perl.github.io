<p>Some more problems:<br/><br/>Issue #2 - Request (and Response) subclassing<br/><br/>This is a problem we encountered in Mason development as well, and I don't know of any great solutions.<br/><br/>The basic issue is that everyone wants a piece of the request (and response) class. It's the logical place to put app-specific per-request/response attributes & behavior. I note that the Catalyst docs seem to encourage you to do this:<br/><br/><pre>
{
    package Catalyst::Request;
    __PACKAGE__->mk_accessors('toejam');<br/><br/>    sub foo { }
}
</pre><br/><br/>Naughty, naughty. This works fine for one app, but under mod_perl you might have a bunch (or a few) Catalyst apps sharing one interpreter, and the above is massively polluting.<br/><br/>The next solution you think of is subclassing a request. That works fine when you're writing an application. You subclass Catalyst::Request, let's call it VegGuide::Request, and add your new bits there.<br/><br/>This fails miserably if you want to distribute stuff on CPAN, however. A good example is Catalyst::Action::REST, which comes with its own request subclass. But what if there were also a Catalyst::Request::WhizBang that I wanted to use? I guess I could multiply-inherit in VegGuide::Request, but that gets really gross.<br/><br/>Another alternative is to encourage CPAN authors to distribute request/response class changes/improvements in the form of trait classes. Then in your app you can do this:<br/><br/><pre>
package VegGuide::Request;<br/><br/>use base 'Catalyst::Request';<br/><br/>use Class::Trait ( 'Catalyst::RequestTrait::REST' );
use Class::Trait ( 'Catalyst::RequestTrait::WhizBang' );
</pre><br/><br/>I guess that's no so different from multiple inheritance, really, but it feels saner, especially when those Catalyst::RequestTrait classes probably provide one or two attributes or methods each.<br/><br/>We came up with an entirely different solution in Mason, but this was before Class::Trait, and nowadays I'd probably go the trait route. For the curious, the Mason solution involves a method called <a href="http://www.masonhq.com/docs/manual/Subclassing.html#request">alter_superclass()</a>, and is well, really bizarre.

<p>I haven't touched Catalyst in a long time, but when I did, I seem to recall that they implemented plugins via multiple inheritance.  I urged them to consider something different, including a trait model.  It would have been far more sane, but they were concerned (if I recall correctly) about backwards compatibility.  Traits solve so many problems and I wish more people would take a look at them.  Of course, it would help if I completely rewrote the Class::Trait documentation.</p>

<p>Where does the documentation say that?</p>

Argh. That was even _my_ fault. I hadn't done that much with Catalyst, and this document is really outdated. Fortunately, I'm about to finish a new version that focuses more on best practices.
