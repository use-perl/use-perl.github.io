<p>So I'm upgrading some code on a client's site, and I notice via portaudit that the currently installed apache/mod_ssl has some security holes.  Time to upgrade.<br/><br/>I do the upgrade and it <b>overwrites the server.crt and server.key files!</b><br/><br/>Good job, FreeBSD.  Remember, any files you find on the system can't be too important.<br/><br/>On a side note, I did not choose FreeBSD, and so far I completely hate it.  I will point out that Debian <b>never</b> overwrites an existing file without asking you first.  That's cause Debian doesn't suck hairy monkey nuts.<br/><br/>Of course, I'm an idiot too, because it turns out I didn't have a backup of the private key for the cert, so I had to buy a new one.  Thankfully, freessl.com made this pretty easy and cheap.</p>

<h2>FreeBSD: The OS that hates you back</h2>

You may think that FreeBSD sucks, and you may hate it, but the two are not totally unrelated.
<p>
Many moons ago, I was the raving Unix bigot in a Windows shop.  A half dozen of the programmers were switching to IBM's newly-released OS/2 Warp, and they were loving it: memory protection, multiple DOS sessions, Windows emulation, the works.
</p><p>
I decided to give it a try, and boy did it suck.  It was annoyingly slower than Windows for the work I was doing at the time, it was ugly to look at, bloated, and didn't support my hardware.
</p><p>
Around that time, I divined what was going on.  The 20-odd floppy disks needed to bootstrap OS/2 to the point where it could read the install CDs included a very crafty piece of AI for the early 1990s: if you were predisposed to liking OS/2, everything went flawlessly, and your experience was quick and painless.  However, if you disliked IBM, OS/2 or any other IBM product for that matter, the little AI in the installer would detect it and make the installation and use of OS/2 a living nightmare.
</p><p>
From your experience, I can only presume that IBM has open sourced its user-satisfaction AI and donated parts of it to the FreeBSD project.  Once you stop hating FreeBSD and just turn the love up to 11, you'll find it doesn't suck nearly as much.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)</p>



<h2>source or package?</h2>

Did you install from the ports source or a package downloaded from freebsd.org?<br> <br>Also, put your anger to good use and fire off a complaint to the maintainer of the apache/mod_ssl port.<br>

I installed from ports.  I kind of assume that's how you're supposed to do it.<br> <br>I don't suppose there's a nice bug reporting script like reportbug for Debian, is there?
