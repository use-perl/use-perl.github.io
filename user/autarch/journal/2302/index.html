<p>The saga continues:<br/><br/><blockquote>Dave, 
There are currently 21 programmers making a minimum of
85k per year working with us of which 6 we located
through your service so your assumption that we are
offering worthless stock, pizza etc. only leads me to
believe that you are at best 30 years old and going no
place in your career and if you worked for me you
would ce fired for stupidity.</blockquote><br/><br/>I like how he threatens to fire me from a job I don't have with a company that doesn't pay actual money.</p>

<p>but are you 30 years old, unemployed and going nowhere?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) </p><p><p>Some people might want a job that pays in stock so you reconsider the listing since not everyone wants the same job. That job might look good to you in a month or two even.</p>

Puke.  Generally, stock-only jobs are reserved for VP's, board members, etc.  This tells me it's a company without a lot of capital to their name (or a consulting firm), and not one that I would be my career on.  Of course, I don't know the company or its history, but that's something you'll want to look into before considering any job.
<p>
Then, there's the added disadvantage of capital gains hits.  See the site below for more info if you're interested.

I'm _under_ 30 and jobless.  But I already got at least one unsolicited job offer which looks quite promising so far.  And they pay with real money, even!
<br>
<br>As to the going nowhere, I'd have to disagree with that part.
<br>
<br>The (fairly recently added) jobs.perl.org policy is to require that jobs pay in cash.  I actually just assumed that (foolish me) but recently spelled it out quite explicitly on the job posting page for would be employers.
<br>
<br>With the economy the way it is, jobs that pay in just stock seem even worse (though really the idea has always struck me as incredibly bad).
