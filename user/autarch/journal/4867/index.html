<p>Well, I feel like I have been reasonable productive these past few weeks.  We finally met another milestone on my satanic contract project that someone tricked me into taking.  Ok, I wasn't tricked, I just needed the money.<br/><br/>I met the first milestone on the <i>other</i>, pleasant project (code review, basically).<br/><br/>The book is in tech review!<br/><br/>I finally made <a href="http://www.alzabo.org/">alzabo.org</a>, all by myself with CSS2.  Now I just need to get the POD => HTML custom converter finished and it's all good.<br/><br/>Alzabo itself is making progress, with much fixing of bugs.  I should put out a new release real soon, probably sometime this week.<br/><br/>In Mason-land, bugs are being fixed and we are approaching a second pre-1.10 beta this week as well, I believe.  After that I don't expect too much time to pass before the actual 1.10 release, which will be cool.<br/><br/>My animal rights group is getting its act together too, which is great.  The board, which I'm on, has actually sat down for the first time ever and come up with a strategic plan.  We've got a budget.  We have things to do.  This is all very exciting, because I think we're moving on to a new level of professionalism, and hopefully effectiveness.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, a friend of a friend might be <a href="http://www.indymedia.org.il/imc/israel/webcast/26926.html">dying in an Israeli jail</a>.  I hope he doesn't, because he is too good a person to lose, and I think he can do a lot more for the Palestinians alive rather than dead.  The US embassy in Israel claims that he did not collapse from his thirst stirike, but who knows what the truth really is.<br/><br/>Now to wrap up the third milestone on the hell project (Monday), finish up the good project, fix more Alzabo bugs with Postgres (yes, Terrence, I will work on it, really), plan YAPC trip, organize more animal rights activities, get Mason 1.10 out,  see Spider-Man, see Nine Queens, call Israel some more (hey, maybe I can help a little).</p>
