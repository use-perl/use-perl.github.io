<p>I have a friend who's just had brain surgery to remove a tumor (second attempt).  And he may have lost all or some of his vision in the process.<br/><br/>Times like this make me wish I'd decided to be a doctor instead of a programmer.  What am I going to do, write him a Perl script to fix his sight?  Not that being a doctor would be of much more help, most likely.<br/><br/>And yes, I saw that guy's presentation as OSCON 2001, and yes, it was super-cool, but I still want a goddamn magic fucking wand.</p>

<h2>Helping the disabled</h2>

While we obviously can't perform medical miracles, there are ways to contribute.
<p>
I create accessible web sites and am always happy to get mail
from a blind or low vision person thanking me for providing access to government data.
It may not seem like much to us, but working on accessible IT makes a big difference in the lives of disabled persons.
</p><p>
In fact, the American Federation for the Blind is looking
at Open Source tools to help them with this, and
GNOME has an <a href="http://wwws.sun.com/software/cover/2001-0828/?redirect=false" title="sun.com">accessibility</a sun.com> initiative.</p>

Yep, that's cool.  I am just frustrated because I want my friend to magically be healthy and there's nothing I can do about it.  Being a programmer isn't necessarily, the problem, though.
