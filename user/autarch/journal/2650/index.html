<p>So I finally stopped playing ADOM non-stop and in a frenzy of coding just about half-finished the sample site for the Mason book.  Hopefully I'll finish it over the next couple days.<br/><br/>I got distracted this weekend by losing a motherboard and hard drive for <a href="http://www.hkmdb.com">The Hong Kong Movie Database</a>.  Fortunately, the drive with all the important stuff survived but I really need to set up some sort of backup (rsync, I think).<br/><br/>Then I pounded my head against a bug in mod_proxy with Apache 1.3.23 last night.  It turns out that mod_proxy will drop all but the last one when dealing with multiple Set-Cookie headers.  Considering most mod_perl sites use a dual-Apache setup with mod_proxy on the frontend that could affect a lot of people.  Once I figure out the problem it was easy to simply go back to 1.3.22 but it took quite a while to figure out WTF was going on.  No fun at all.<br/><br/>My job search seems to be going ok.  I've got some decent leads which will hopefully turn into something this week.<br/><br/>Last Friday I got together with my former boss and CEO for dinner.  What a pair of wackos.  We had a good time.  I teased them about being broke (they're both working for no pay).  I really hope that they can turn it around because it was a cool place to work and all the people there were pretty cool.  I don't know if I'll end up back there in any event, but I'd hate to see them all out of a job.
