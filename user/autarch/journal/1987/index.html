<p>I just found out my wife and I are having our green card interview (for her) this Monday morning.  I thought we'd get a lot more notice but apparently not.<br/><br/>Its a real marriage (duh) but I'm still quite nervous.  Job interviews I don't sweat but this is more serious (since we'd like to live in the US and not Taiwan).</p>

<h2>Experience of the whole thing?</h2>

How was your wife's experience of the whole process? I know it was quite some work with papers and all to get me over here. I was kind of nervous when I had to go to my interview at the American embassy in Copenhagen, but it wasn't quite as rough as some people's posts to alt.visa*something made it out to be.
<br>
<br>But yeah, it does seem like very little notice to get for the interview itself.

Well, my wife was already here as a student when we got married.  After she left school we immediately applied for a green card.  The whole thing has been really simple so far.  We hired a lawyer and basically we just had to collect some paperwork.
<br>
<br>But it probably makes a big that she was already legally in the country.

<h2>Immigration</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/vek/">vek</a> on 2002-01-08T22:26:28</h3>
After having gone through this personally (I'm a Brit, my wife is American) the best I can say is try not to worry about it mate.  Easier said than done I know.  I was <b>really</b> nervous at the time and waiting in the immigration office for a couple of hours (even <b>with</b> an appointment) doesn't calm the nerves much.  But I had <b>nothing</b> to worry about.
<br>
<br>What stage of immigration are you at?  We (after waiting for <b>years</b>) just went through the "removal of conditions of residence I-751" interview.  The entire interview lasted approx 10 mins.  They ask you if you swear to tell the whole truth and nothing but (yes you are standing with your hand raised!).  They ask if you are still Married and if you have any children plus a few other generic immigration questions.  As long as you have the paperwork they asked you for when you got your appointment letter you should be in and out in a flash.  Of course, then you have to wait 10-12 month's to get your card but that's another story...

Which card did you have to wait 10-12 months for? I got my permanent resident card (Still conditional though) in 4-5 months. And in about 1 year and 3 months we'll have to apply for removal of my conditional status and go to an interview.

See the reply I made to my own comment.  I too got my <b>initial</b> card fairly quickly.  Once you have the interview to remove the conditional status you get the <b>permanent</b> card.  It's <b>that</b> card that could take 10-12 month's to arrive (so the Immigration Office told us).  This is obviously not a big deal as you are already here in the States at that point.

After reading your reply to the comment <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/Thomas/" title="perl.org">Thomas</a perl.org> posted it looks like you're in the first stage of obtaining a green card.  We were at that stage some years ago before moving to America.  Yes you'll be pleased to know that you will have <b>another</b> interview even once you've obtained said Green Card.  The initial card will only be valid for 2 years.  90 day's prior to it's expiration date, you have to fill out form I-751 to remove the conditions of residence.  Then be prepared to wait for a <b>long</b> time.  The INS will send you a letter informing you of your next interview.  It was <b>that</b> interview that my Wife and I just had.
<br>
<br>All in all, as long as everthing's legit, you should have nothing to worry about whatsoever.
