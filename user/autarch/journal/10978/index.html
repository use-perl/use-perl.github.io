<p>No, not other people's, my own.<br/><br/>I've found that periodically re-reading the docs of my modules is a good habit, as it helps me spot typos and thinkos that have gone unreported, as well as outright mistakes and holdovers from past versions which should have been changed but weren't.</p>

It's my theory that my brain gets entirely replaced every three months.  That's about how long it is before my code doesn't make sense without comments or additional documentation.  That's how long I remember why I was being particularly clever.  That's why it's important to put comments on things: it's not just for the next guy, it's for <i>me</i> three months from now.
<p>
And as you're seeing, that's how long it is before you're a "fresh reader" on a doc.  Yes, good idea to go back, with your new brain.  Three months.</p>

<p>Luckily, a lot of your code comes with a column's worth of commentary.  You get to rediscover what you were thinking along with the rest of us.</p>
