<p>That's a bummer.  None of my three proposals were accepted.  It's an especially big letdown given that last year I submitted two proposals and both were accepted (including one tutorial I co-presented with Brent Michalski).  I wonder what changed this year?  Or maybe I just sucked ass last year and got bad reviews.<br/><br/>Hmm, I wonder what happens to those review sheets?  I'd kind of like to see them.<br/><br/>Anyway, since none of my talks were accepted I doubt I'll be there unless some rich person comes out of the woodwork to pay my way.  I wasn't sure if I could make it if I couldn't do a tutorial (which pays for airfare + $1500 (or did last year)) but only a regular talk (free admission).  But without free admission it's a no-brainer, cause I've got no money ;)<br/><br/>I hope to be able to make it to YAPC this year, which is closer (cheaper air fare), shorter (less hotel costs), and it doesn't matter if I give a talk or not (cheap reg fee).<br/><br/>I wonder if ORA ever just gives free admission to authors?  I'll have to check with my editor.<br/><br/>I could also just show up and sneak in, which I think would actually be fairly easy, except that I just mentioned it here.  Doh!</p>

<p>I was really, really looking forward to going for the first time this year. But unless $COMPANY gets a big cash infusion it's just too much money for the trip, hotel and entry fee.</p>

<p>And we scheduled a short trip to NC before YAPC was announced. Of course, they conflict. So looks like no conferences for me this year. Shit.</p>

<p>Maybe I need to go to work for a big company where  conference fees like this aren't even a speck of dust on a drop in the bucket.</p>

Right now I'm working for $SELF, so these fees are the entire bucket!  Of course, my last employer was a 8 person company and couldn't've payed for a conference either.

Well, working for $BIG_COMPANY doesn't always mean that they'll automatically let you go.  I got the big thumbs down this year because of 'the budget'.  I <b>did</b> get to go to OSCON last year though (thanks to $BIG_COMPANY) - I suspect it will be the last one for a while...

I suspect that attendance will be way down in general.  Whether it's $SELF or $BIG_COMPANY footing the bill, all the objects in question seem to have a much smaller value in their -&gt;{available_cash} attribute this year.<br> <br>Honestly, I wonder how OSCON can survive this sort of thing given that I suspect the fixed costs (the space and staff) are probably fairly significant.<br> <br>Well, see y'all at YAPC this year<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)
