<p>I have a lot of <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/drolsky/">modules on CPAN</a>. There are way too many for me to give them all the attention they deserve, so often patches get dropped and bugs ignored.<br/><br/>In particular, there are a few that could use the attention of someone interested in helping maintain them. Log::Dispatch is used by a lot of people, and could definitely use some attention. There are a number of <a href="http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Dist/Display.html?Name=Log-Dispatch">open bugs</a> in RT, and I have more patches & bugs in my email inbox.<br/><br/>Another distro that could use some love is Alzabo. I don't think it has a lot of users, but if you are a user of it and want to see it better maintained, let me know.<br/><br/>If there is some other distro of mine that you'd like to help maintain, especially one with open bugs, please let me know.<br/><br/>Write to autarch@urth.org and tell me what you'd like to help with. If I don't know you, I'll probably ask you to start by submitting a patch. All of my code is in <a href="http://svn.urth.org/">my svn repo</a>, so getting the latest version is easy (https://svn.urth.org/svn/Distro-Name/trunk).
