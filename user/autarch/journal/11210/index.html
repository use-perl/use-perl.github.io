<p>Here's some places that are cheaper than staying at the Marriot where the conference is at.  All rates are based on staying from Tuesday, July 8 through Sunday, July 13, for one person.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.markspencer.com/">Mark Spencer Hotel</a> - $87.55 with online reservation - includes free wireless<br/><br/>But it gets better.  Thinking that the people likely to attend are geeks who'd enjoy free wireless, I called about group rates and they can offer a group rate of $79 per night for standard rooms, $99 for junior suites, and $119 for executive suites.  The suites can all hold up to 4 people, though it's +$10 per person over 2.  So that's a pretty good deal.<br/><br/>It's about 1 mile from the convention hotel, 2 blocks from Powell's, and there is free public transportation in downtown Portland, so getting around should be easy.<br/><br/>So if you're interested, watch this journal space for more details.<br/><br/>Disclaimer: I have never been to this hotel, but it looks quite nice.<br/><br/>Disclaimer 2: I might get some sort of upgrade if a bunch of people stay there cause of me.<br/><br/>Other places:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.daysinn.com/">Days Inn</a> - $69<br/><br/><a href="http://www.downtownvalueinn.com/">Downtown Value Inn</a> - $55 - looks like a dump ;)<br/><br/><a href="http://www.doubletree.com/en/dt/hotels/index.jhtml?ctyhocn=RLDT-DT">DoubleTree downtown</a> $116 for first 3 nights, then $114, or with AAA it's $99 for the first 3, then $122 for the last two (weirdness).  You can probably do AAA for the first 3, then regular for the last 2<br/><br/><a href="http://www.starwood.com/fourpoints/search/hotel_detail.html?propertyID=97512&fromSearch=22XX&linkbrand=fourpoints&links=all">Sherator 4 Points downtown</a> - $99 or $79 with AAA<br/><br/><a href="http://www.5thavenuesuites.com/">5th Avenue Suites</a> - $119<br/><br/><a href="http://www.vintageplaza.com/">Hotel Vintage Plaza</a> - $119

<h2>free wireless</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/merlyn/">merlyn</a> on 2003-03-25T04:04:08</h3>
The PDX Wireless Telco project has most of the park blocks and the pioneer square covered in free wireless anyway.  You have to authenticate with a web browser to say "I'm abiding by your EULA", but after that, it's free and fast.
<p>
In fact, Portland recently got awarded by Wired magazine as the "most unwired city".  Woo hoo!</p>

That's cool.  But it won't help late at night in your hotel room.<br> <br>Anyway, if you want to save money this seems like one of the better deals out there.

my wife and I were just in Portland at the 5th Ave Suites for under $50 per night via priceline.com. If you're not very particular about which hotel you land in, you might want to give it a shot. Start with a very low price and see if anyone bites. (They took our first bid, making us think we should have started lower.)<br> <br>The year before, we landed in the Doubletree which is a bit South of all the action, but it's only a few blocks from the free trolley which will take you into downtown proper.<br> <br>-matt<br>
