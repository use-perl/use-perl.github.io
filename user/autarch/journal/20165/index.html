<p>There were lots of people I saw at OSCON too briefly, or said hi to in the halls.  Off the top of my head, this includes Andy Lester, Bill Odom, David Wheeler, Stas Bekam, Phillipe Chiasson, Jamie McCarthy and so many more.  There's never enough time at these conferences.  On the flip side, I actually met some new people and had a great time hanging out with them, including Martin Galese, Chris Dawson, Keith Lofstrom, Alex (last name I cannot remember), Schuyler Erle (who I missed last year), and others.<br/><br/>That means that next year there will be even more people I want to talk to and don't.<br/><br/>All in the all, the conference was really great on many levels.  I think my talk went well, and I was happier with it than others I've done recently.  I also attended some really interesting sessions and got turned onto the whole GIS thing by Schuyler, Jo, and Rich Gibson.  This prompted me to go to the PostGIS session (great talk, BTW), and I'll be looking into the whole GIS thing quite a bit in the near future, I think.<br/><br/>Not enough Go, unfortunately, just one game with Autrijus.  It's hard to identify other Go players without screaming out "anyone want to play Go" in the hallways or something like that.</p>

<h2>Too many cool folks</h2>

It was funny, too, 'cause I was up on stage talking about hiring and I thought "Shit, I leave tonight, I haven't talked to Rolsky."
<p>
I would really like to have something like a mini-con weekend where we don't even have talks, we just sit around talk about cool stuff.  It'd be regional, so it wouldn't be too tough to get to.</p>

<p>That mini-con sounds a lot like FOO camp.  Last year, we had self-organizing talks, which worked out really well.  I think this year'll be the same.</p>

Foo Camp sounds cool, except for that icky camping part.  The outdoors is not for sleeping in.  It's filled with rocks and bugs and stuff.

<p>There are hotels in the area as well as the great indoors -- plenty of space where you can pitch a tent in an unused corner of a conference room.</p>

Some animal lover <em>you</em> are!

Being an animal rights activist and an animal lover are two different things.  I have a friend who I've done animal rights activism with in the past, and who will soon be re-joining the board of my AR group.  He doesn't really like animals at all, not even dogs or cats, and generally avoids them.<br> <br>I, OTOH, _do_ like being around _some_ animals, primarily mammals and birds, though reptiles are ok too.  Bugs and sea life, however, freak me out.  And the outdoors is filled with lots and lots of icky bugs.
