<p>Ugh, every Saturday morning I have to get up at an unholy hour (round 8:00 or so) to drive my wife to work because she still doesn't have her license.<br/><br/>Normally I'd then go see a Hong Kong movie at 11 AM (<a href="http://www.amamedia.org/">www.amamedia.org</a>) but I went and saw it last Friday at midnight instead and while I like Once A Thief a lot, I don't need to see it twice in the space of 8 days.<br/><br/>I added some cool stuff to Alzabo recently to allow you to join to a single table under multiple aliases.  Its very simple to use, which is good.  Now to get it to output Dia XML!<br/><br/>The book is damn close to being done (for tech review) if I could just get around to it.<br/><br/>I started playing with KPresenter yesterday (though I'm a Gnome'r) and it is quite nice.  It has a good balance of features and simplicity.  I've decided I'm going to be slick at YAPC and OSCON this year and have real slides, no more HTML crud.<br/><br/>Damian (I think) makes the point (somewhere online) that having bullet points appear on the screen as you talk about them is a really good strategy because it keeps the audience focused on what you're talking about at _that_ moment, as opposed to seeing a huge blob of text and randomly reading bits of it.<br/><br/>So far, so good.  I have about 8 slides or so for a revised-from-last-year Alzabo talk/tutorial.  I figure it'll be about 70-100 more.<br/><br/>If I actually go ahead and submit the 5 talks I'm thinking of and they get accepted then I'll have my work cut out for me.  Actually, I probably need to cut it down to only 3-4 since 3 of the talks I am considering giving are on projects that I've either just begun (Dia::Diagram) or not even started at all (HTML::Mason::I18N and a web forum using Mason & Alzabo).  I told a friend of mine about this tentative plan of mine and he just shook his head like I was crazy, which I probably am.  But it seems like it'd be good incentive to actually finish the code!<br/><br/>But then I remember that I already have plenty of work I haven't done yet, like version 2 of the <a href="http://www.hkmdb.com/">Hong Kong Movie Database</a>.  That's coming along nicely though.  Alzabo makes it really easy (and this is the project for which Alzabo was started, those 2 long years ago), at least relatively.  I never could have gotten anywhere on this without it.  I promised myself I wouldn't buy Wizardry 8 til a releasable version of HKMDB v2 is done.  That's incentive!<br/><br/>Well, I have til March to do all my submissions so I guess I'll see how things stand then.</p>
