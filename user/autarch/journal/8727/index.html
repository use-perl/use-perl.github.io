<p>Wow, it's been a while since I wrote here.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.masonbook.com/">The book</a> has been released.  A hearty "bite me" to the people who felt compelled to criticize my grammar in the release announcement here and on Slashdot.<br/><br/>The initial feedback is looking good, and hopefully there will be full-blown (and positive ;) reviews sometime soon.<br/><br/>In news of the pathetic, I managed to injure both of my ankles rather badly in a marathon session of Dance Dance Revolution at home.  My previous problem with exercise was that I found it boring and just gave up.  Now I've found a form of exercise I like too damn much, and I hurt myself.  I think I tore a ligament or something like that, cause its been about one and a half weeks and its healing, but very slowly.  I really miss playing DDR, sigh ...</p>

You should set yourselves up as an Amazon affilitate so you get your 15%, that's a whopping $3.60 a purchase!
<p>
I would buy it from Ruminator, but it's only $24.47 at <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0596002254/" title="amazon.com">Amazon</a amazon.com>, a $10 saving.</p>

It's $21.50 at <a href="http://www.bookpool.com/" title="bookpool.com">Bookpool</a bookpool.com> (<a href="http://www.bookpool.com/.x/dsp7dt9t1m/ss/1?qs=perl+mason" title="bookpool.com">link of unknown persistence</a bookpool.com>).

There are a number of reasons I wouldn't become an Amazon partner.<br> <br>First, Amazon engaged in union-busting when some of the support workers tried to organize.  Very slimy.<br> <br>Second, they abuse the patent system.  Also slimy.<br> <br>Third, I _like_ independent, locally-owned businesses and I want to support them.  That's why I chose Ruminator, which is a Twin Cities area bookseller.  Places like Amazon and B&amp;N are pushing these places out of business, and that sucks.  I don't want to live in a chain store world.<br> <br>I know Amazon is much cheaper, and we get more from Amazon, but I sleep better at night this way.

O'Reilly tells me that my book is waiting for me in Brooklyn.  Joy!  I'm stuck in Washington, DC for the moment but should be home to unwrap my new tome by tomorrow (11/03).<br> <br>
I'm looking forward to it.  I've enjoyed looking throught the book sources as I wait.
