<p>It's that time of year again.<br/><br/>I don't get too excited about it, myself, having grown up a Jewish atheist and now being mostly just an atheist.  I guess I'm still Jewish but I've gotten so completely disgusted by Israel that I feel weird about being Jewish.  That's very sad because being Jewish isn't really a bad thing, but I have trouble embracing it nowadays.<br/><br/>Anyway, I will engage in my traditional Christmas celebration tomorrow, which consists of going to see a movie and eating out (with my parents as a kid it was always Chinese but there's a great vegetarian Indian place here that'll be open tomorrow).<br/><br/>Movie theaters and ethnic restaurants are usually the only things open (and gas stations too, I think) and its always fun to go hang out with all the other non-Christians.<br/><br/>Today was a _big_ patch to various libraries in the Perl core as part of some ExtUtils cleanup I've been doing.  Then I should get back to work on the Mason book (we're almost done!) and the new version of the Hong Kong Movie Database and Alzabo and my bazillion other projects.  I am such a geek.<br/><br/>
