<p>I set up a mail server running Linux at my dad's office. He has a bunch of computers running various versions of windows, now including XP on some. He got a new laptop and cannot get his email client (Thunderbird) working with the server.<br/><br/>He talked to some idiot who suggested the following:<br/><br/>1. The Linux server is not listening to the right port (but it is).
2. It could a Windows security issue (maybe)
3. Upgrade to Vista (huh?)
4. He doesn't know Linux so he can't help (err, it's a problem on the client)<br/><br/>Anyway, I'm looking for someone who can help my dad get this working.<br/><br/>Part of the problem is that the server's on a local network, so he needs to set up a hosts file to specify the addresses. At least, that's what I had him do for other computers in the office.<br/><br/>Anyway, if you know Windows networking and are interested in getting paid to help my father, please contact me (dave at urth dot org). This is for a non profit so reasonable rates are appreciated. He knows how to get VNC through his firewall so it's actually possible to get onto the system in question if necessary.</p>
