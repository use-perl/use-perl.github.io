<p>I guess before that there was just a formless void with no time, no past and no future. Ok, maybe not, but no DateTime.pm for sure.<br/><br/>I realized that the 5 year anniversary of the Perl DateTime Project passed by recently. I date it <a href="http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.datetime/2003/01/msg388.html">this post to the datetime@perl.org list</a> I made on January 9, 2003. That really got the ball rolling, and I was actually working on the first version of DateTime.pm in the next day or two.<br/><br/>Thanks to everyone who's contributed over the years. I don't think we realized that we'd end up creating _the_ definitive set of Perl date/time libraries, to the point where a _lot_ of people say "oh, I just use DateTime for everything".<br/><br/>Even better, I think we still have one of the best date/time library suites of _any_ language out there. The only thing I've seen in all this time that comes close is the Chronos library for Smalltalk, myself. Of course, if someone wants to point me at one they think rocks, I'm happy to learn more.

As a heavy user of Joda I echo what you've heard -- it's excellent. It's well-coded and well-designed, and threadsafe throughout. Particularly compared to what's in the JDK, blech.

You (and all the other contributors) did a great job to make a single family of modules to solve almost all date/time related issues.<br><br>Now if someone will do the same for emailing, please!

Didn't it die a year ago?

Not that I am aware of. One of the devs still posts not to use MIME::Lite (and he is the maintainer of it) as the Email modules are better.

It's not dead, but it never saw the same kind of mass enthusiasm and initial flood of work that the DateTime project did. However, I do use the Email::* modules all the time for <em>sending</em> emails, and they work great. I get the impression that if you wanted to do something like write a mail client, you'd have your work cut out for you.<br><br>As sigzero mentioned, it's still active, and Ric Signes (RJBS on CPAN) is still working on the project. I'm sure he'd appreciate some help.<br>

Wow, has it really been that long! I still remember all of the silly questions I posted to the list as if it was yesterday<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)
