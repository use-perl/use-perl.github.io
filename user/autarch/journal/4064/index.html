<p>It'd be neat if we could apply moderation points to journal entries, as well as comments.<br/><br/>I cannot be the first one to think of this, I imagine.<br/><br/>Ok, pudge, hop to it ;)<br/><br/>(That is a joke, for the humor-impaired.)</p>

No, no, I don't want all my journal entries to be downvoted for my bad English<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

If anyone did that hopefully they'd get a metamoderation smackdown.<br> <br>Entries are supposed to be judged on content, not English proficiency.

<i> It'd be neat if we could apply moderation points to journal entries...</i> <br> <br>Just out of curiosity, why do you think that would be neat?  I'm just trying to get a sense of how that would improve one's use.perl.org experience.<br> <br>I dunno, to be honest I don't mind one way or the other but I can't help thinking that 'journal moderation' may make some people think twice before posting.  I like the fact that you can post random musings without a care in the world.  What if people starting thinking 'hmm, wait a minute - maybe this post isn't interesting enough'.<br> <br>Then again, maybe I'm reading <b>way</b> too much into this<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

It could be useful if the points showed up in the journal list.  An annotation like:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; (2,3)(1) (2)<br>could mean that there are two journal entries in the most recent day (same day as the most recent entry, whose timestamp is already noted) with ratings of 2 and 3, one entry the previous day with a rating of 1, and one entry from multiple days earlier (the blank means there was at least one day with no entry posted) with a rating of 2.<br> <br>You could look at the list of journal entries and go to the highly rated entries for journals you might otherwise ignore, as well as still going to your favourites.
