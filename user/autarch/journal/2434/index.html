<p>Its a totally addictive Rogue-like game (much more interesting than Rogue or Nethack, though).  Unfortunately, I'm spending all my time playing it instead of using my unemployment (hopefully) brief to do useful stuff like finish up the book or work on Mason or Alzabo (or any of a number of other projects).<br/><br/>I just zipped up the directories with the games and my saved games in the hopes that the (minor) inconvenience will help my self-control.  I am truly pathetic.</p>

<p>That's why I've steered clear of computer games for years now.  I remember wasting countless hours with something as stupid as a Mah Jongg solitaire game.</p>

<p>Now instead I spend my precious time on productive things like <a href="http://archive.develooper.com/fwp@perl.org/msg01203.html" title="develooper.com">Perl golf</a develooper.com>.</p>

No mate you've got it all wrong.  You can never <b>waste</b> time playing computer games<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)

I love this game! I pretty much stopped playing since I started messing up with modules and having a kid, but I was really addict for a while.
<br>I never ceased to be amazed by people on the NG winning seamingly at will though, I only won once (elf warrior) and got to level 50 of the CoC 2 more times, only to end up as a writhing mass of chaos whatever<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;--(
<br>I must say I still like Nethack better though, and I think it is more complex. Amusingly I found that I just can't play Nethack any more, as I keep using the ADOM commands. And why can I only play Nethack with the graphic tiles while I have no problems with ADOM in text mode?
<br>So many mysteries...

Well, I've been save-scumming (and pool-scumming) so its a lot easier but for me a game is more about exploration and seeing stuff than doing it the "right" way.
<br>
<br>I can't imagine how much time investment it would take to actually win legitimately.  Too much for my tastes, I'm afraid.
<br>
<br>How is Nethack more complex?  I only played a little and thought it had less going on than ADOM (with its many quests, gods, etc, various dungeons, etc.).

Don't save-scum! And use an XML Parser! Wait, no...Seriously, you haven't played a roguelike if you haven't felt the horror of loosing a high-level character "for good". This will really make you play much better, because you have to think before pressing each key. And really that's much more fun. Nethack is actually not that difficult with some classes (Valkyrie and Samurai for example).
<br>As for Nethack being more complex: it is open-source and very old. This gave plenty of people plenty of time to write a much richer game than ADOM. Sure ADOM is more coherent and more serious, but the level of detail in Nethack is incredible. Any item in the game can be used in many different ways. The number of funny messages is amazing too. I am sorry I don't have any example, but I haven't played it in a couple of years.
<br>It is actually recommended to have a look at the source in order to get good at it. That plus the geeky humour makes it the real Open Source game<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;--)
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>Oh, and ADOM might have many dungeons, but I end up basically doing them always in the same order, so it does not add much compared to Nethack's branches.
<br>
<br>Note also that nethack -x puts you in explore mode, where you won't die, so you can try anything and explore to your hearts content!

Well, my current goal with ADOM is to do one of the Ultimate endings and then delete the thing forever, hopefully having satisfied my sick, disgusting urges<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)
<br>
<br>Save-scumming means that this can be accomplished within the next day or two, meaning I can actually do something useful with my free time after that.  Without save-scumming I'd be at this for months and I really don't want that to happen.  And stop telling me about how cool Nethack is!  I don't want to know!
