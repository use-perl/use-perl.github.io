<p>The Frozen Perl 2008 deadline is coming up. I wrote some text that I've been asking folks to forward to their internal work email lists. If those of you out in use Perl land who are reading this could do the same, I'd be most grateful.<br/><br/><blockquote>
The early bird deadline for Frozen Perl 2008 is fast
approaching. After midnight Central on Saturday, January 12th,
the rate for non-students will double from $20 to $40.<br/><br/>Frozen Perl 2008 is a one-day Perl workshop happening on
Saturday, February 16th, with a great schedule of speakers. The
theme is "Perl in Practice", and there are a lot of great talks.<br/><br/>We have two tracks of talks. For folks new to Perl, there is a
strong slate of talks for beginners, including introductions to
OOP, testing, and more. For more experienced Perlers, there are
talks on Moose, Catalyst, and all sorts of interesting Perl
wizardry.<br/><br/>Registration includes breakfast and lunch, and possibly a
t-shirt, all for the ridiculously cheap price of $20. If you're
coming from out of town, there is a group rate at the nearby Days
Inn. There will also be an all-day hackathon on Sunday, February
17th for the true geeks.<br/><br/>For more information, check out the website at
http://www.frozen-perl.org/. You can sign up online, so don't
delay.<br/><br/>We hope to see you there.<br/><br/>Dave Rolsky
Frozen Perl 2008 Organizer
