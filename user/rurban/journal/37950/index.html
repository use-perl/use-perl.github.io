<p>Bratislava, 2008-11-08 16:05 MET<br/><br/>=head1 NAME<br/><br/>Need help with the perl compiler, emit C or JIT, blabla<br/><br/>=head1 Preparation<br/><br/>  open L<B-C/perloptreeguts.pod> and 
  L<perl-current/pod/perlguts.pod><br/><br/>=head1 Contents<br/><br/>I'll present very briefly about 5% of the internals, will debug
some real-life problem and you have enough time to task deeper
questions.<br/><br/>* History
* Current Status
* Compilation
* The op tree
* B::Bytecode
* B::C
* Using the compiler
* Debugging a problem
* Ideas, pro and contra B<br/><br/>-----------<br/><br/>=head1 History<br/><br/>The "perl compiler" modules B<B::Bytecode>, B<B::C> and B<B::CC>
(C<B::C> compiles B to simple C, C<B::CC> to optimized C source)<br/><br/>written 96-97 by Malcolm Beattie, Oxford.<br/><br/>in core since Alpha 5, perl5.002<br/><br/>Out of core since 5.9.5 (5.10)<br/><br/>Now at CPAN as B::C maintained by me, rurban, 
at F<http://search.cpan.org/dist/B-C/> (still as devel)<br/><br/>--------<br/><br/>With alpha3 (1997) it could compile almost the 
whole perl test suite for all 3 compilers.<br/><br/>With 5.10 it cannot even compile a regexp (due to the 5.10
rewrite and SV changes) and its 21 internal tests
(due to advanced features since 5.002: AUTOLOAD, our, ...).<br/><br/>  perl -MO=C,-otest.c test.pl
    => test.c
  gcc test.c<br/><br/>--------<br/><br/>=head1 Current Status<br/><br/>5.002 up to 5.8.9 works "ok", most tests pass, but not all.<br/><br/>For 5.10 properly calling and saving a lexical context needs some 
help, most likely from eastern hackers. I have best experiences 
with russians.<br/><br/>For 5.10/5.11 calling and constructing a regexp for B::C
needs help. From demerque in Frankfurt, or someone else who
knows how to call PM_SETRE and CALLREGCOMP in XS in 5.10.<br/><br/>When these two problems are solved, I can release it as 
B-C-1.05 and replace B::C from 5.8.<br/><br/>When the testsuite with some advanced tests will pass, we can
start using the compiler and bytecode features. Probably put the
bytecode stuff back into core, because we need plc/pmc support
and the ByteLoader part builtin.<br/><br/>5.6 and earlier will keep using the core B::C modules, 
as its internal structures changed too much.<br/><br/>--------<br/><br/>=head1 "Compilation"<br/><br/>perl has an internal compiler, i.e. a parser (perly.y) reads the
source lines and compiles it to a so-called op tree, a tree of
simple operators (ops), which are internal pp_() functions.<br/><br/>  See opcode.pl or perloptreeguts.pod<br/><br/>As with XS all internal perl pp_ functions take no arguments, 
all arguments are expected to be on the "perl stack", which 
is a special heap area, not the CPU stack. (pp for "push/pop")<br/><br/>The op tree represents the program code, but a program also needs 
the data, the SV's, AV's and HV's. The arguments for the ops are 
typically pointers to those SV's (SVREF) or lexicals (on PADs) 
or direct SV's.<br/><br/>perl is not too much functional, so there are seldom pointers to
ops used as args to ops, mostly lexicals and SV's. 
In L<perlguts.pod> you will see the all the used perl data, the
internal variables, the SV's, AV's, HV's, but also CV's, GV's,
...  But you will not learn about the op tree, the structure of
the ops.  The perl compiler is all about the op tree, the ops.<br/><br/>When executing a program, perl compiles ("parses and constructs")
the optree and then simply runs linearly through the optree (a
linear list now) from the beginning to the end.<br/><br/>In the "perl compiler", the B backend is just the XS
representation of the optree as perl objects, you can use perl
methods to read from the various OP structs.<br/><br/>The perl compiler consists of various B modules to convert from
those B objects, representing the ops, to bytecode or C code.<br/><br/>----------<br/><br/>=head1 The op tree<br/><br/>See L<perloptreeguts.pod> (in B::C and the perl5 wiki) and
L<perlhack.pod><br/><br/>Similar to the perl internal variables, the SV's, the B<OP>'s are
built as hierarchical C structures, based upon the BASEOP, and
then more specialized OPs, for the different number of args and
types of operations.<br/><br/>  "$a + $b * $c"<br/><br/>is compiled to (in C syntax, but really in memory)<br/><br/>  newBINOP(OP_ADD, flags,
     newSVREF($a),
     newBINOP(OP_MULTIPLY, flags, 
         newSVREF($b), 
         newSVREF($c)
     )
  )<br/><br/>Two BINOP's for ADD and MULTIPLY take two args (BINOP), and of
those two args are the op for a SVREF (pointer to the SV for $a,
$b and $c) and the OP_MULTIPLY.<br/><br/>This parse-tree is recursive and looks like nested LISP code.<br/><br/>The internal compiler (not B::C) runs in three passes over the
perl code. The various passes contain also a "peephole"
optimizer, which optimizes this recursive op tree and in the end
it is ensured that we can linearly run through the tree by simply
stepping through the C<op_next> pointers and with lists through
the C<op_sibling> pointers.<br/><br/>The Walker:<br/><br/>  int
  Perl_runops_standard(pTHX)
  {
	dVAR;
	while ((PL_op = CALL_FPTR(PL_op->op_ppaddr)(aTHX))) {
		PERL_ASYNC_CHECK();
	}
	TAINT_NOT;
	return 0;
  }<br/><br/>
=head1 B::Bytecode<br/><br/>Generate the optree from a binary .plc/.pmc file, 
platform-compatible.<br/><br/>CROSS-PLATFORM PORTABILITY
For different endian-ness there are ByteLoader converters in effect.
Header entry: byteorder.
64int - 64all - 32int is portable. Header entry: ivsize
ITHREADS are unportable.<br/><br/>Needs much less opcodes (~100) than perl opcodes.pl, 
all the pp_ functions (~400).
Just for every op, all the op flags (the struct fields) 
and for every sv/av/hv type.<br/><br/>Assembler and disassembler roundtrips.<br/><br/>=head1 B::C<br/><br/>Similar to bytecode it generates the whole optree ("code") and 
data in memory with XS functions, and then jumps into ENTER 
via the main walker C<Perl_runops_standard>.<br/><br/>But it generates C code, which is statically compiled and linked
to libperl. Dynamic perl features are still dynamic, but
guaranteed static decisions can be optimized. => L<B::CC><br/><br/>=head1 Using the compiler<br/><br/>  perlcc test.pl<br/><br/>  t/testplc.sh (see the .plc, .asm, .disasm files and 
                the roundtrips)<br/><br/>  t/testc.sh 2<br/><br/>=head1 Debugging a problem<br/><br/>See STATUS<br/><br/>  t/testc.sh 02 <br/><br/>Debug a failure in the PREGCOMP call <br/><br/>Expand the preprocessor C macros to find 
the actual failing calls.<br/><br/>  gcc -E => .cee<br/><br/>Fix the line number from main() on for the gdb stepper. 
Our main() is perl_init_aaaa() here.<br/><br/>Step to the problem and inspect it. gdb b perl_init_aaaa p<br/><br/>
=head1 Ideas<br/><br/>The B modules can be used the read or change or transform the
perl optree - a perl program in the internal representation.<br/><br/>We might want to convert perl5 to various other formats, such as
native code (JIT), perl6 or PIR, but maybe also to java, LISP,
scheme, and compile this then to fast native and optimized code.<br/><br/>Other possible advanced ways are:<br/><br/>1. B<PPI>, the perl source level parser together with a source
filter, which could be used for source level macro trickery.<br/><br/>2. B<MAD>, compiles the optree externally to XML or YAML, and
offline tools can convert these XML to other formats, such as
perl6 code.  Advantage: This looks awful, but is easily debuggable.<br/><br/>3. undump() and unexec<br/><br/>Some cool B modules are L<B::Concise>, L<B::Deparse>, L<B::Lint>,
L<B::Generate>.  <br/><br/>And as advanced modules L<Devel::TypeCheck>, L<optimize>, 
L<optimizer>, L<types>.
These are the building blocks for a statically optimized 
compiler (as B::CC), in contrast to the current slow, 
dynamic interpreter.<br/><br/>--
