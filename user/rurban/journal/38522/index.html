<p>I thought that having portable parrot bytecode (pbc) is a good idea,
similar to portable perl5 bytecode (B::Bytecode). And parrot was designed for bytecode portability. So it should be better than perl5 plc. And it is.

<p>

Anyway, it does not work since a while. Some random notes for debugging this:
<p>

We support 32-bit and 64-bit architectures, that makes a wordsize
(integer) and ptrsize of 4 and 8, and the floats can be 8-byte
(double), 12-byte (long double on i386) and 16-byte (long double
elsewhere).  <p>

The trouble with portability is besides the required bitshuffling when
reading foreign pbc files, the trouble of what to do with deprecated
features (new parrot reading old file), and new features (old parrot
reading new file).  <p>

And interestingly better architectures require a ptr alignment > 1. 
Sparc 32-bit requires 4-byte ptr alignment, Sparc 64-bit requires
8-byte ptr alignment. You can reset this with a compiler flag but 
it is not recommended for performance reasons.<p>

This hits us when writing code on our simple i386 platform with a ptr
alignment of 1 and a wordsize of 4. <br>
The 64-bit sparc just does cursor++ (a opcode_t ptr) running through the file. 
cursor is 8-byte there, 4 byte here. So we have to take care in the 
writer also to properly align code, because it must be easily readable 
on the foreign machine also.<p>

The section I'm tempted to adding to the pdd31_bytecode.pod is:<p>
<blockquote>
<h3>=head4 8-byte ptr_alignment</h3><p>

We should be aware that some systems such as a Sparc/PPC 64-bit use strict
8-byte ptr_alignment per default, and all (opcode_t*)cursor++ or
(opcode_t*)cursor += advances must ensure that the cursor ptr is 8-byte aligned.
We enforce 16-byte alignment at the start and end of all segments and for all strings,
but not in-between, esp. with 4-byte integers and 4-byte opcode_t pointers.
<p>
Which means that for a 32-bit (4-byte) pbc on a 8-byte ptr_alignment machine
the pmc designer should take care that integers and opcode_t pointers appear
pairwise in the frozen format, so that the 16-byte padding at the end of a
segment already happens on an already 8-byte aligned pointer (xxx0 or
xxx8), and not on a 4-byte ptr (xxx4 or xxxc) alignment. Operations
on aligned pointers are much faster than on un-aligned pointers.
<p>
</blockquote>

With #define TRACE_PACKFILE 1 in include/parrot/packfile.h you can
enable debugging output for the packfile reader, the parrot utils
pbc_dump accept a --debug flag to use this. But you can also use the
debugger to check alignment problems.

<p>

There's nice table in the PPC manual which I need often, because when
staring at the ALIGN'ed ptr's you have to see errors, which will
happen if start reading at the wrong point. Un-aligned.<p>

<code>
  Operand    Length  Addr if aligned (in bits, 0b)<br>
  Byte       8 bits  xxxx   any                   <br> 
  Halfword   2 byte  xxx0   even <br>
  Word       4 byte  xx00   0 4 8 c <br>
  Doubleword 8 byte  x000   0 8 <br>
  Quadword  16 byte  0000   0              <br> 
</code>

So look for any ending hexbyte but 0 and 8 for your ptr's to see 8-byte 
misalignment, and 0 for proper 16-byte alignment.<p>

The interesting point, which I first got wrong, is that the ptr alignment
(we guarantee 16-byte ptr alignment) is for the cursor stepper
cursor++ to advance the ptr in memory not to the next char, but the
to next word = opcode_t.<p>

This is the macro (WRONG), which automates the cursor stepper.  To
makes things complicates we already copied the contents into memory,
so the base address is not 0 but <tt>pf->src</tt> and the alignment must be
guaranteed for all three ptrs involved: the base <tt>pf->src</tt>, the cursor
(current position) and the offset, the relative position in the file,
<tt>cursor - pf->src</tt>.<p>

<code>
#define ALIGN_16(st, cursor) \              <br> 
    (cursor) += ROUND_16((const char *)(cursor) - (const char *)(st))/sizeof (opcode_t) 
</code>
<p>

cursor += advances the pointer by the alignment calculation in the
macro. But this does not do ptr alignment!  The ptr must already be
properly aligned in terms of the native ptrsize. So on 32-bit (4-byte) there 
must be 0 4 8 or c as last hexdigit in the cursor and the offset.
The padding can only 0, 1, 2 or 3.<br>
On 64-bit (8-byte) there must be 0 or 8 as last hexdigit in the cursor 
and the offset. The padding can only 0 or 1.
<p>

My padding tables for ALIGN_16:<p>
<code>
ptrsize=8   pad         <br> 
    0   0              <br> 
    8   1              <br> 
</code>
<p>
<code>
ptrsize=4   pad              <br> 
     0   0              <br> 
     4   1              <br> 
     8   2              <br> 
     c   3              <br> 
</code>
<p>

The other problems are simply looking innocent steppers, like this in 
PF_fetch_string() (WRONG):<p>
<code>
    size = ROUND_UP_B(size, wordsize);              <br> 
    *((const unsigned char **) (cursor)) += size; 
</code>
or this from PF_fetch_op() (CORRECT):<p>
<code>
    o = (pf->fetch_op)(*((const unsigned char **)stream));              <br> 
    *((const unsigned char **) (stream)) += pf->header->wordsize;
</code>
<p>

Here we cast the ptrsize stream down to 1 to be able to advance misaligned 
pointers, but upwards in the directory segment we should be aligned again.
And PF_fetch_op() and PF_fetch_integer() only guarantee 4-byte alignment, 
not 8-byte as needed on 64-bit strict PowerPC.<p>

Strings are the most potential problem to destroy alignment, because
they may be mod 1, mod 2 or mod 3 byte long, any size. But strings are
safer because we ensure proper ptrsize alignment for them. 4-byte
integers and pointers are more problematic because on 8-byte machine
we easily get misalignment in uneven integer or pointer pairs.<p>

So look for uneven ptrs, also when thaw'ing pmc data. 
This must also be aligned! <p>
 
Did you see catch the error above? No? Me neither, but there is one, and 
it is hidden in the ROUND_UP_B macro, which is not 32/64-bit proof. It 
only works on the native platform.<p>

And don't whine about this stupid machines. They are right, even if
its just a 64-bit sparc which is that strict (ptr alignment 8,
remember), unaligned code is shorter, but much slower.<p>

So it's better to catch unaligned data while compiling or even running
(as on the sparc), than running slow and misaligned.
