I've looked at the Perl apocalypses and they are hardly more than a scatter-brained enumeration of trivia and faux pas; it reads like a blind man's account of constructing a puzzle. It doesn't solve problems by solving problems; it's a misadventure in stochastic symbol-pushing. Perl 6 is just another iteration in that language's interminable and drunken meandering. Occasionally it stumbles across a good idea, in the same way that a construction worker might unearth a fossil when drives his pickaxe through it. According to you, I guess "we can regard him as" a paleontologist, then. </CITE>

<CITE>(I'm sorry but I really need to get this off my chest, again:) Scripting languages thrive on hype because they have no other advantage; their advantage is the hype, and the popularity which accompanies it. Sure, Perl may be an improvement on sh (frankly, I am not so sure :) but it is hard to find a strawer man. </CITE>
