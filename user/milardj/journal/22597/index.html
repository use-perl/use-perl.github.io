<p>Will Eisner <URL:http://www.willeisner.com/index.html> died on January 3rd.  For those who have never heard of Will he created comic books and IMO the best comic to be distributed by newspapers: the 16 page supplement following the adventures of <b>The Spirit</b>.
<p>
Starting in the late 70's and continuing until his death Will also pioneered the creation of literaty graphic novels(in North America - Asia and Europe have never had the "comics are for kids" stigma prevalent here)
<p>
Will was an inspiration for multiple generations of comic artists and his work done 60-70 years ago holds up remarkably well today.
<p>
This weekend I need to wipe the cobwebs off of my comic collection and find the Kitchen Sink reprints of The Spirit and spend some time with an old friend.
<p>
Rest in peace.</p>

That truely bums me out. I have a fair collection of the Kitchen Sink reprints, and grew quite fond of "The Spirit" before running into my still-current comedy of errors regarding finances.<br> <br>Will, you indeed WILL be missed, and the world is blessed to have known your presence.<br> <br>oh okay fine, I'll say it. someone has to<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:j  "the Spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.."<br> <br>Yeah yeah, I know, my puns are always awful.<br> <br>I'll miss you, Will. Cheers, and thanks for the memories. *sniff*
