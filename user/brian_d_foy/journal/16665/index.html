<p>Now I have done it.  <a href="http://weblogs.oreilly.com/pub/au/4135">I made resolutions for 2004 and posted them in my O'Reilly weblog</a>.  I really should not write that stuff directly in the web form, because I tend to get carried away.  Oh well, now I just have to deliver, or change my name and leave the country (half of that is already done).<br/><br/>The highlights:<br/><br/>I want to work on TPR.  It has $2,000 in the bank, and with a little more, we are going to send people dead trees and ink really soon.<br/><br/>I want to work on Perl module testing and release utilities.  No surprise there, but I want to work directly on that stuff rather than as a support issue for other stuff I am doing.  Andy's Phalanx project sounds like a good place to do that.  Perhaps I could pick a couple of people to help out by writing test suites for them---maybe have a Perl Idol competition to select a lucky candidate.<br/><br/>Arghh---there is another frickin' project.  <br/><br/>[Carrier dropped by brian's wife]</p>

Now I need Test::Post.

a full test suite for the stuff you worked on for me last year should shake down your test modules pretty well....<br/><br/>gwhite

I'd love to work on that stuff again.  Too bad I probably won't be back in the working way until after TPC.<br> <br>I'm curious how well that particular test suite comes to full coverage to the code.  Heck, if the CVS repository is in the same place I could probably hack on it a bit here.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

same place... but I am such a CVS dolt, you might scream at the train wreck.
