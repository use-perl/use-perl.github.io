<p><a href="http://www.panix.com">Panix</a>, my shell host, has their domain named snarfed by faceless, evil, international criminals.  Hopefully, by the time you read this, there won't be a problem, but right now there is.  <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/6238">I described it in my O'Reilly weblog</a>.<br/><br/>So, if you sent me mail since Friday night (huh, snarf a domain on friday night of a long American weekend), I might not have got it.  If I got it, I'm not responding to it until they fix this problem. I'm not ignoring you, really.  You could ask dha or ziggy, but they have mail accounts at Panix too.<br/><br/>If you sent me mail before that, I <i>am</i> ignoring you.  Well, not really, but hey pudge, do I really need to know the points for/against ratios for every NFL team since the start of the league?  I don't really care if they come out to Pi or e or whatever creepy, magic number you said it was. It could be sqrt(3)/3 for all I care.  I don't think that's any sort of owners' conspiracy. You're this close to a new procmail rule, buddy.</p>

I've been following the <a href="http://merit.edu/mail.archives/nanog/threads.html#04242" title="merit.edu">relevant NANOG thread</a merit.edu> since last night (also <a href="http://merit.edu/mail.archives/nanog/threads.html#04258" title="merit.edu">here</a merit.edu>). Scary.

NANOG makes me want to unplug everything and hide under the bed.

Did Panix not have a Registrar Lock on their Whois, or is that really useless? (They do now on their<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.NET, but the<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.COM is still hosed; NANOG says recovery is underway.)

That doesn't seem to be <b>my</b> shell-account ISP's excuse for SSH-2 not working today - their old host is on air for SSH-1, but the SSH-2 enabled host is off air.

Right on! SSH rocks. I'm oldfashioned, I use ELM unless there's MIME involved.  AFTER triage with ELM, I slurp with POP (into a non MS mailreader) for fancy footwork. ]Of course, at WORK I ahve to use Outlook<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-( ]

I'll resend my last message of Friday night to your panix(dot)net alias when I next log into work.

I never email you anyway.  I demand that I get your attention RIGHT NOW.
