<p>My tent is the new unit library.  Stacey also
tells me that a group of Chicago-based flight attendants are collecting DVDs to send to me, so
I can be Blockbuster too.
<p>
Bad news, folks.  I'm here to April, at least.
I wanted to get back into the Perl world sooner
than that, so my Powerbook and other cool things
are on their way here.  We'll see what happens.
<p>
When I get back my priority is a paper version
of TPR in some fashion.  I've been thinking 
about it, and with the extra scratch this long
deployment will give me, I should be able to do
it, especially since I'll be on the dole for a
bit.
<p>
But hey, life isn't all bad.  The temperature 
is a chilly 95 F.  That is chilly, too.  I use
my wool blanket at night.
<p>
Anyone who wants to send me Perl related snail
mail (conference proceedings, slides) eventually gets a free beer. :)

<p>How would that address be written to work from outside the US?</p>
<p>I regret that I can't think of anything that I have duplicates of to send, so I can't promise anything.</p>

The address is a regular US address, so you can just attach USA to it. Postage should be the same as to the US, since everything goes through New Jersey for us.<br> <br>If you are near a US military base, sometimes you can just inject it right into the Army (or Fleet)Post Office, like my British friends have.
