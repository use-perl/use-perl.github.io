<p>While David and I were sitting in the speaker's lounge at the Mac OS X conference, he pulled on a pair of funny looking gloves and started typing.  I, while waiting for a very large file to transfer, stopped minding my own business and asked him about the gloves. <br/><br/>They did not look like anything special---just some thin material gloves without fingers called <a href="http://www.handeze.com/fingerless.htm">Handeze</a>.  They are, however, designed to relieve repetitive stress injuries.  I was skeptical, but he said that his arms felt better with them than without them.<br/><br/>Since then, I have been using them too.  They took awhile to get used to because there are only three finger holes (and one for the thumb, too).  This pushes the middle two fingers together, or keeps them from moving too far apart.  Those two fingers use different nerves (whose names I forget), so maybe part of the painful forearm thing is friction between those two nerve bundles.  Ask a doctor if you really want to know.<br/><br/>While wearing the gloves I can sit with my laptop in positions that would normally painfully strain my left arm.  If I wear the gloves all day, even while not typing, my wrists and forearms feel better at the end of the day, although if I go outside people might think I am some sort of freak.<br/><br/></p>
