<p>I'e been getting a lot of DVDs in the mail, but with no notes.  I am grateful to anyone who sends me anything and will have a big party at the next TPC/YAPC/ObOReillyCon with free beer until my big army paycheck runs out.<br/><br/>Even though I have my laptop here, and we have a little bit of access to the internet, I do not get enough time on the network to look around. Anyone want to help me answer some questions?<br/><br/>
* is there a module to create and parse multipart HTTP messages? i'm working with IE's one-file web archives since it works well with sneaker-net.<br/><br/>* i want to record audio on my Mac OS X machince, but now I can't find anything like Simple Sound. What gives?  Short of Pro Tools (on the way, i think), what does Mac OS X come with for that?<br/><br/>* is there an A to D board for OS X?  I want to get one and then write Perl interfaces if it does not already have them.  I know they were around for System 6/7/...<br/><br/>* anyone made a therimin out of their Macs (see A to D board, above)?<br/><br/>* and, some things I could use if anyone wants to send me CDs: iTunes 4, TeXShop (already have TeTeX), something shareware that records from the external mic, that program for MacOS X that turns shell scripts into droplets (DragThing?), any cables you may not need or want (USB, firewire, Cat 5 since we're trying to put together a network over here---everyone's buying laptops this month), a MacWarehouse catalog (so I can drool).<br/><br/>maybe someday i'll get more than 20 minutes at a computer on a network *and* the network will work.</p>

<h2>Simple audio recording</h2>

<p>
The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0596004508/" title="amazon.com">
Pogue book</a amazon.com> mentions that you can use iMovie's voice over functionality in a pinch.

I tried using iMovie, but not only does the application suck ass, it wastes a lot of time recording a movie rather than just the audio.  I get "Disk is responding slowly" warnings that stop the recording after 10 seconds or so.<br> <br>What I would relly like is something that will just play through the mic input so I can grab it with Audio Hijack.

<p>If all you want to do is record give <a href="http://versiontracker.com/dyn/moreinfo/macosx/17392" title="versiontracker.com">Audio Recorder</a versiontracker.com> a whirl. Free (as in beer) and under 500Kb.</p>

Audio Recorder is just what I need---no fancy bells and whistles, and it records straight to MP3!
