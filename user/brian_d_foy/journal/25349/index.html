<p>Randal reminded me today that Canada will try to collect taxes at the border. I figured out how much I'd have to pay to bring in a bunch of The Perl Reviews to Toronto next week, and I'd have to pay more than I have at the moment.<br/><br/>Any ideas? </p>

...so, trying blaming them.  That seems to work.

Blame them for what?<br> <br>I just completely forgot that I had to cross a border with a box of commercial goods. Of course they're going to tax me.

<p>I think he was referring to <a href="http://www.sing365.com/music/lyric.nsf/Blame-Canada-lyrics-South-Park/9E94B82AED5BC99248256DD600151A00" title="sing365.com">this song</a sing365.com> from the <a href="http://www.comedycentral.com/shows/south_park/index.jhtml" title="comedycentral.com">South Park</a comedycentral.com> show on Comedy Central.</p>
<p>Or were you being sarcastic?</p>

I wasn't being sarcastic. I though my original message may have come off as if I thought the situation was dumb, when in reality I'm just dumb.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br> <br>I know about the "Blame Canada" song.  I've even heard it done in a serious opera fashion by world famous opera singers (who were rather drunk at the time, but still in fine voice<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)

When I used to work in the electronics field service industry, we always used to have a barrister meet me at customs, with the necessary paperwork to allow my tools to come in to the country.<br> <br>  Has something changed recently?<br> <br>  You mean that they charge tax on things that you own, and bring into the country?<br> <br>  They've always done that....
