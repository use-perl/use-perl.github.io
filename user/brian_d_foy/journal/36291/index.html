<h1>Updating perl-mode and vi macros answers in perlfaq3</h1>

<div class="span8">
<p>I notice that Jon Rockway <a href="http://blog.jrock.us/articles/Emacs%20and%20Perl%205.10.pod">updated cperl for Perl 5.10</a>. Since I don't use emacs I'm just getting that news. However, <a href="http://faq.perl.org/perlfaq3.html">perlfaq3</a> is even more out of date. Can someone with up-to-date emacs knowledge read through perlfaq3 and update anything emacs related? <br/><br/>I figure the vi crowd should get the same chance too. I use vi, put without the fancy macros. Rather than try to update the vi stuff myself, I figure someone who really loves vi should get a chance.<br/><br/>The latest perlfaq are at https://svn.perl.org/modules/perlfaq/trunk/ (as noted in <a href="http://faq.perl.org/perlfaq.html">perlfaq</a>). You can send patches to me directly, or to the mailing list address listed in perlfaq.<br/><br/>Thanks, :)</p>

<h2>For the vi content...</h2>

<p>I nominate Ovid for updating the vi (vim) stuff. His journal entries on integrating Devel::Cover/Devel::CoverX::Covered with vim macros has me practically considering switching from emacs back to vi after nearly 23 years.</p>

<h2>Better to update the original cperl-mode...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jand/">jand</a> on 2008-04-30T21:23:39</h3>
and not the version already mangled by RMS.  Ilya is still releasing updates to the original cperl-mode (and Perl 5.10 comes with the latest version at the time of its release).  I would prefer to see the 5.10 patches applied to that version instead of promoting the RMS fork.

Hi.  We try to keep sync'd with IlyaZ, but his version control isn't public and I can't read his mind.  Better to have something than nothing, even if you contend that the original emacs is a fork of the original emacs<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:P

<h3><a href="/user/jand/">jand</a> on 2008-05-01T03:36:26</h3>
Yes, something is better than nothing, and I do appreciate that you put in the effort to get Perl 5.10 support into cperl-mode.  I understand that Ilya is not always easy to work with, so I don't know if he rejected applying any patches you may have made against his version.

<p>As to why I consider the RMS version a fork, just try to get the change history comments from Ilya's version into the RMS version and see what happens...

</p><p>However, I just did a diff between the 5.23 versions from Ilya and RMS and they seemed much more similar feature-wise now than they used to be, so maybe this isn't really a big issue anymore.</p>
