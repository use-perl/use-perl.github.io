<p>I figured there must be an easier way to extract email addresses then sorting through a file full of emails. The problem is more process than technology. I want to be involved in the process as little as possible without letting a program possibly clobber a bunch of data.<br/><br/>Since I use PINE, I went looking for some way to pipe messages to external programs, and indeed it has one.  I needed to enable the enable-unix-pipe-cmd command, and then with the | key I can send the entire message to whatever program I like.<br/><br/>I created this little program I named "f" to extract the From address and store it in a file.  I'm not ready to let it directly add the address to my white list, so for I leave the addresses in a different file.<br/><br/><pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl<br/><br/>while( <> )
	{
	next unless /^From:/;
	chomp;
	s/^From:\s+//; s/.*<(.*@.*)>.*/$1/;
	if( open my( $fh ), ">> $ENV{HOME}/mail/fix-addresses" )
		{
		print $fh "$_\n";
		}
	else
		{
		print "$_: Problem: $!";
		}
	last;
	}
</pre><br/><br/>I named the program "f" so I wouldn't have to type  a lot when I have to tell PINE which program to use.  PINE does remember the last program I specified, but once I quit, it forgets it.  Oh well.<br/><br/>Now, I don't have to separate the falsely tagged spam then deal with them later.  I can extract the From address right away, then add them to the white list later.  If I wanted to get fancy, there would be a database somewhere in all of this, but I have real work to do.</p>

The following bit <em>still</em> irks me<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<blockquote><div> <tt>s/.*&lt;(.*@.*)&gt;.*/$1/;</tt> </div></blockquote>It's one of the things that constantly annoys me, like a pebble in the shoe, when I write sed scripts. What I believe it really should phrased as is<blockquote><div> <tt>$_ = $1 if<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/&lt;(.*@.*)&gt;/;</tt> </div></blockquote>

"Should" is strong phrasing. If that's the way you like to do things in sed, that's fine, but around these parts there is more than one way to do it.<br> <br>But this is open source, so if you decide to use the script, you can change it to anything that you like.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

What I'm saying is that I <em>can't</em> do it this way in sed, so I'm forced to repeat myself: "find <em>anything</em> followed by the bit I want followed by <em>anything</em> and replace it by the bit I want". At times, I've pined for a <code>crop()</code> function (in sed more so than in Perl, of course, but the Perl verbiage can get old as well).

<h2>Ready-cooked software</h2>

I use a program called the "little brother database" (lbdb in Debian) to handle this for me.



<h2>'Pine' Piping</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Smylers/">Smylers</a> on 2004-07-09T19:37:40</h3>
<p>To get round 'Pine' only remembering one pipe command, and forgetting that when you quit, you can use its print functionality instead.</p>

<p>The definition of a printer in 'Pine' can just be a command to pipe stuff to; obviously you're <em>supposed</em> to put commands like <code>lpr</code> in there, but there's no reason why you can't set up anything else as a printer.</p>

<p>When I was a 'Pine' user I had <code>gvim</code> as my default printer.</p>

Ah, very cool indeed.  Thanks<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br> <br>I never thought of that because my PINE machine does not have a printer that I can use, so I never bothered to look into that.
