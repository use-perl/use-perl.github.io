<p>The bits can now fly safely from here to the satellite, so I released the things I have been saving up:<br/><br/><ul>
<li><a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/grepurl/">grepurl</a> - a program to extract the URLs from an HTML document and filter the list in various ways, suitable for use with xargs.
<li><a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/webreaper/">webreaper</a> - my program to scrape web sites so I can look at them offline.  Now it has more ways to get around tricky web site things, like throttling.
<li><a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Test::Prereq/">Test::Prereq</a>, <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Test::Manifest/">Test::Manifest</a> - now fat free, with less dependencies, and documented ways to show how you can make their use optional.
<li><a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/iphoto">iphoto shell</a> - control iPhoto from this little shell, using Mac::Glue behind the scenes.
</ul></p>

<p> <tt>grepurl</tt> looks a lot like my <tt> <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/urifind/" title="cpan.org">urifind</a cpan.org><nobr> <wbr></nobr></tt>.</p>

It is a lot like your urifind!<br> <br>I do not get enough time on the net to research things as much I would like.  I figured there was someone who must have done this before.<br> <br>I had to sit at a desk for 12 hours doing pretty much nothing, so I made grepurl.  Oh well, I had fun with it<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

<p>For the first few weeks after I put this on
CPAN, I kept waiting for the same message you
just got, and it never came, which leads me to
believe that there are now exactly <em>two</em>
things that do this.</p>

<p>We should start a club.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<p> <tt>urifind</tt> uses <tt>URI::Find</tt>,
which, in my benchmarks, is slower that <tt>HTML::SimpleLinkExtor</tt>, and relies on regexes
rather than document structure.  Which means
<tt>grepurl</tt> will most likely be faster and more accurate (<tt>urifind</tt> cannot do
relative URIs, for example).  Then again, I wrote
<tt>urifind</tt> specifically to extract URIs
from my mail, none of which is HTML.</p>

<p>So they are only superficially related.  I
hereby disband our club!</p>

I looked around for URI::Find for about a week, because I knew something like it existed, but I kept thinking it was called something like Text::Extract::*.  I have a minicpan on my computer, but I don't have a good way to search it (like search.cpan.org---the cpan script assumes you have a pretty good idea to start).<br> <br>I've got urlfind now and i'm going to go back to my tent and look at it.  one of the things i wanted to add was different data sources (HTML, text, xml, and so on), and i have a lot of time here recently.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
