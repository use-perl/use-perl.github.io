<p>I have no idea what that phrase means, but now <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/7472">I'm the "formerly respected" member of the Perl community</a>. :)<br/><br/>Despite the low number of comments in my "<a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/7472">Toxic Developers</a>" post, a lot of people are talking to me about it at OSCON. I'd thought I'd get a lot of hate mail over it, but it's been just the opposite.</p>

<h2>if perl were subjected</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/hfb/">hfb</a> on 2005-08-03T08:13:23</h3>
<p>
to the same scrutiny, no one would be using it today given the history of perl and vicious personality conflicts.
</p>
<p>
I was under the impression that the conflict and legal threats were personal, not Tony threatening users or programmers dealing with his code. I'm surprised about the threat, but making a big deal out of what likely should have remained personal seems to only intensify the situation rather than quell it.
</p>
<p>
In the absence of information, people simply make shit up...just like Perl6 development and the mistrust that anything will ever come to fruition. If people would just say what was happening, even if that means telling folks absolutely nothing is happening, life would be much easier all around. Then again, perl people aren't known for their ability to communicate save perhaps poorly.
</p>
<p>
You aren't helping the situation any more than Schwern alluding that Tony isn't insane or all the gossipy rumours. Isn't there some other scandal this year to better distract people? I know of at least two far more fun rumours than this whole tragedy in a vacuum of information that few outside the immediate blast zone give a rats arse about.
