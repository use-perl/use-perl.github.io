<p>Besides missing the train to McHenry today (and missing my chance to hang out with <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/petdance">Andy</a> and <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/inkdroid">Ed</a>), other things today convince me I am a dumbass.  Can you score better than me?<br/><br/><b>Regular</b>: <i>All Things Considered</i> started a story with "Unless you have been living on another planet, you know this weekend is ..."  What is this weekend?  I did not know. Do you?<br/><br/><b>Unleaded</b>: Today I ran into a Perl error that I have never seen or knew existed.  Like a dumbass, I just kept running the program over and over thinking the error might go away.  What does it mean to be "unintroduced"?  For extra points, what sort of syntax error leads to this compilation warning?<br/><br/><b>Premium</b>:  While looking for a particular album on Amazon.com, I discovered that this composer did the soundtrack for <i>Tron</i> and <i>Clockwork Orange</i>.  Who is the composer that I did not know did the soundtrack for two movies I have on DVD and watched last week?<br/><br/><b>Diesel</b>:  Based on what I have published elsewhere this week, you might be able to guess what album I was looking for.<br/><br/><b>Hydroelectric</b>: This composer also worked under another name.  What was it?<br/><br/><b>Solar</b>:  Which Perl module would this composer likely use? Which Perl module would this composer likely write?  (Seriously---remember, this composer scored <i>Tron</i>)  Anyone with a good answer gets points.<br/><br/>Comments enabled, no Googling, Amazoning, IMDBing, Randaling, void where prohibited.</p>

<h2>Dumber</h2>

It's Super Bowl weekend.  I have $5 against my Dad that the Raiders will lose.
<p>
The rest are all new to me.</p>

Andy wins those points, but he's not dumber---I did not know <i>any</i> of those, and he knew one.  He gets discretionary points because he also knows who is in the Super Bowl.

<h2>%s never introduced</h2>

I know this one, because I was looking recently with Dave Mitchell at the regression tests for the warnings emitted by the source file pad.c in bleadperl. I noticed that this warning message hasn't a regression test -- it's marked as to-be-written. However I was unable to come up with a short case that triggers the warnings, because I don't fully understand the guts of lexical variables. I didn't try very hard, though.

You know it but you did not answer the question!  That's the right error message though.<br> <br>If no one posts a situation where it comes up, I will show what I did to get it.

<h2>Clockwork Orange Soundtrack</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/dws/">dws</a> on 2003-01-25T17:29:11</h3>
I would have guessed someone else wrote the score for Tron, but I used to own the Clockwork Orange soundtrack. That was Walter Carlos, before he became Wendy Carlos (or Wendy after being Carlos -- one or the other). You were probably looking for "Switched on Bach", or maybe "Switched on Brandenburgs".

We have a winner!<br> <br>Yes, W(endy|alter) Carlos scored <i>Tron</i> and <i>A Clockwork Orange</i>, which I discovered while I was looking for <i> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00002DDS5/briandfoy-20" title="amazon.com">Switched-On Bach</a amazon.com> </i> on Amazon.<br> <br>She did a lot of stuff with a <a href="http://www.moogmusic.com/" title="moogmusic.com">Moog synthesizer</a moogmusic.com>, including Bach's Well Tempered Clavier (or, Synthesizer in this case).<br> <br>You win the Premium, Diesel, and Hydroelectrical points.  Andy won the regular points.<br> <br>The Unleaded and Solar points are still available.

With that much of a clue, the Solar points should be for <tt>Switch.pm</tt>.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)
