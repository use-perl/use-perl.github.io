<p>I got around to reading this month's (although it say "November") <i>Dr. Dobbs Journal</i> (which I keep getting although I have never subscribed to it).<br/><br/>On page 14, they have a couple of news items under "open Source Grant Money Available".  They mention Mozilla's bug bounty, and two Python programs.  I guess they must have forgotten about <a href="http://www.perlfoundation.org/gc/grants/benefits.html">Perl grants</a>.  They aren't exactly new, but maybe they only talk to Eric Raymond for their news.</p>

Perhaps it's a bonus because you wrote <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Addj.com+%22brian+d+foy%22" title="google.com">a few articles</a google.com> for them, a few years ago.

I also started getting DDJ, about three months ago.  No subscription.  I also just got a SysAdmin yesterday, which *might* be part of my USENIX/SAGE membership, but I don't remember reading anything about that.  Very strange.

<h2>DDJ tends to pretend that perl doesn't exist</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/TeeJay/">TeeJay</a> on 2004-10-20T09:49:59</h3>
DDJ has focussed on<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.net and Java for so long it has forgotten that anything else exists. Of course this might have something to do with all those tool and library vendors that pay for advertising in the magazine.
<p>
Even if the advertisers are almost exclusively for<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.net and java stuff they could make an effort to include or acknowledge perl - I remember they managed to forget to include perl in one article about jobs (a piece that would be too trivial to deserve an article if done in perl).
</p><p>
Perhaps you could get an apology from the DDJ editors - they managed to eventually remember perl existed for the jobs article I am sure they can be persuaded to remember perl again now - I am sure they owe us a decent edition that skips the usual Java and<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.net crap for some decent CS, Perl and C/C++ for a change.
</p><p>
I have to admit that I don't even bother buying it these days for several reasons :
1) The 'security' series of articles is no better than I can get online for free, and usually of a lower over-simplified standard.
2) No more computer science and algorithms, instead we have that idiot from Byte talking about his latest Wintel PC and what books he likes.
3) No perl, well ok.. 1 small ammount of perl in an occasional article, but you have to download the source code to the article to actually see it.
4) Far too many advertorials for new products or libraries in Java and<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.net thinly disguised as articles.
5) A regular<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.net section - why? where is my OSS or perl or C/C++ section.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.net developers have MSDN and several other perfectly good specialist magazines that offer this kind of thing
6) It is still stupidly expensive to subscribe from europe -- hello why does it cost more to post a CDROM or magazine than for me to fly over to the US and buy it from a newstand??
</p><p>
DDJ isn't about programming anymore and I don't buy it anymore

I'm not sure what goes on behind the scenes, but I'm pretty sure they know Perl exists.  They even have a  part of their web site devoted to it (athough I hear they cut the funding).<br> <br>If they had just mentioned Mozilla, I would have thought nothing of it.  But they mentioned Python (twice!).  It seems they could have filled out the article a bit with a couple sentences about Perl.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

They don't have a perl section, they have an archive of perl articles, mostly from other sources, that hasn't been updated or added to for as long as I can remember. unlike say.. python-url which they do weekly.
<p>
DDJ really needs a kick up the arse, if they wan't to be MSDN fine, I just hope another publisher will provide a decent mix of CS, Algorithms, low level and high level programming articles.
</p><p>
Even at its best DDJ is hit and miss when it comes to decent articles
</p><p>
If there was a magazine that mixed algorithm/CS with what I could get from the C++ journal, onlamp style articles but for C and TPR/TPJ/LJ I would shell out the 4 GBP they cost, but its not worth paying 4GBP when the articles are mostly irrelevent.

I had a subscription for a year, but I cancelled it.  They picked me to fill out this survey, on a 3.5 floppy.  So I filled out.  I wrote that I was cancelling the subscription because I found 1 out 3 issues somewhat useful/interesting.  I indicated that if I was a visual<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.net c# vb java programmer (something like that), I would keep the subscription.  I also added that the fact that I am taking this survey on a windows box, because that is the only thing it will run on is more fuel for the fire.  I did get an email for a free subscription and accepted it, for free I'll take it.  I'll save my money for TPR, TPJ, Daemon News,<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...etc.   It is funny how you get the free magazines without signing up for them.   At one time I was getting INC, now I get Wired, Fast Company, Parenting.  I never signed up for any of those.<br> <br>

As I'm learning in a the magazine biz, free subscriptions are a way to get ad dollars.  It's how many people get the magazine, not how many people pay for it.

  I figured that was the case, with Soooooo many free magazines out there.<br>
&nbsp; Well as far as TPR is concerned I am very happy to pay for it.  Getting the first printed issue in the mail was awesome,  I really missed the printed TPJ.<br>Not the supplements, the original ones.  I look forward to many more.

<h2>well, most perl people don't know</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/hfb/">hfb</a> on 2004-10-20T16:38:51</h3>
about TPF grants, the results of those grants or what TPF actually does. Why would you expect Dr. Dobb's to know more than the folks around here?

I would expect more because they are writing a bit on Open Source grants and Google exists.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

Google doesn't magically pull stuff out of its arse. I tried several different keyword searches and TPF was nowhere in the top 5 pages. People shouldn't be expected to beat a path to your door.

Well, <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=perl+grant&amp;start=0&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official" title="google.com">perl grant</a google.com> worked for me.  If I was looking for Perl grants, that's what I would search.

<h2>maybe from OSCON</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/wickline/">wickline</a> on 2004-10-21T01:58:53</h3>
I have a habit of using particular tweaked versions of email and street addresses for different purposes so I can tell who spreads my contact info around (and so I can kill email addresses that get spam).<br> <br>My OSCON 2004 registration address is now getting a free subscription to DDJ. I think the second or third issue of that free subscription arrived last week.<br> <br>-matt
