<p>Anyone written a Sudoku solver in Perl? I'd sure like to get an article about that into <a href="http://www.theperlreview.com">The Perl Review</a>. I can barely leave the house now-a-days without seeing someone playing one of those.</p>

brian - I wrote one over Christmas as a brain-exercise.  I'm doing a talk for kw.pm about it and puzzle-solving in Perl in general.  I was going to do some research on other solutions.  I can write an article if you are intersted.<br><br>fishbot =&gt; "Eric Maki"

There must have been something in the air. <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/runrig/journal/28193" title="perl.org">I did it too</a perl.org>. Though it'll have to wait 'till I get home to forward it to brian.

Sudoku solvers must be the modern day equivalent of
web templating engines.
I wrote one a few months ago but it is far too ugly to show anyone.

<h2>how about generating them?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/perrin/">perrin</a> on 2006-01-05T19:24:49</h3>
Is it possible to programmatically generate new ones rather than solve them?  That would be more useful for the people who actually play them.

I believe so... I was starting to figure out how to get my program to guage the difficulty of a given puzzle.  It can already determine if a given puzzle is solvable and unambiguous.  And it is easy to generate a completed matrix.  The only challenge is coming up with a good strategy for deciding what to reveal as a clue and what to leave blank.  Just doing it randomly and iteratively would be graceless and expensive.

I had just picked up Sudoku when I was on the Geek Cruise with Brian a few months back and was toying with a solver then (I have a fairly well working, though slow, solver now).  An interesting theory Ive seen used to generate Sudoku is to first generate a solved board. Most solvers will work on an empty board, just pick random places to "guess" and pick the first solution that comes up.  After that, its just a matter of removing certain spaces.  True Sudoku always has some pattern to the board, so you could use some template or some symetry rules to get a nice looking board.  Difficulty can often be gauged by how many itterations of the various algorithms used are needed to complete the puzzle from a given state.

<h2>Funny Story</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/pudge/">pudge</a> on 2006-01-10T22:41:32</h3>
I had never heard of or seen this until last November when I was on the plane.  The guy next to me was playing it, and I tried to divine the rules from what he was doing.  I failed.  I turned to my copy of National Review, and read it.  One of the articles I read over the next half hour was about<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... Sudoku.  WEIRD.<br>
