<p>I've been working on the Pod chapter for <a href="http://www.pair.com/user/comdog/mastering_perl">Mastering Perl</a>, and wrote <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Pod-Perldoc-ToToc">Pod-Perldoc-ToToc</a> to demonstrate how to use <code>perldoc</code> with your own formatter as well as how to subclass <code>Pod::Simple</code>. This example simply extracts a table of contents, something I do quite often while working on our book sources.<br/><br/>Since I had this new module, I decided to try it with my <a href="http://code.google.com/p/brian-d-foy/">Google Code</a> project which I created after their OSCON announcement.<br/><br/>So far, I'm not that impressed with Google Code. It's a publically available subversion repository, but that's about all I like. It's still a young project, but I don't see any reason to switch over anything from Sourceforge yet.</p>

<h2>For bigger projects, Ack.</h2>

Sure, I wouldn't recommend Google's Project Hosting for larger projects with much activity yet. But it's a great opportunity for authors of smaller modules to provide an easy accessible public SVN repository.

&gt; It's a publically available subversion repository<br><br>NOW you definitely got my interest.<br><br>I've been needing one of these for ages.<br><br>I'd love to be able to get rid of my own svn and move to one that someone else hosts and manages and deals with downtime for.<br><br>(goes to take a look)

<p>Moreover, it's got http and https access, and you can give a commit bit to anyone with a gmail address.  I think it's ideal for open repositories more modules.</p>

<h2>Continuous beta!</h2>

<p>Well, first of all I thank you for bringing this up, since I didn't know about this Google service. Said this, we can at least hope in future improvements, due to their <em>"continuous beta"</em> development model. I'm confident new features will be constantly added (with the hope that they will be the Right&trade; ones).</p>
