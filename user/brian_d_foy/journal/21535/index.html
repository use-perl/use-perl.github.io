<p>Ever since Chris put the Sox logo on use.perl, the boys from Boston have not lost a game.  They haven't even come close to losing.  Now they are 3-0 in the World Series, which gives them 4 chances not to screw it all up in game 7.<br/><br/>It's vitally important that the Red Sox win tomorrow.  If the Series goes all the way, no one in Massachusetts or Rhode Island will be sober enough to wake up on election day, perhaps giving up the state's 12 electoral votes to the other guy.  The next president is likely to choose at least one Supreme Court justice, so we'd better get the right president.<br/><br/>So, if things go right and the Sox win tomorrow, averting a presidential disaster, you'll know who to thank, even if he does live on the wrong coast now.  </p>

<h2>Election Day Sox Fever</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/n1vux/">n1vux</a> on 2004-10-27T18:35:51</h3>
Worse than that, even if we wake up on election day, the parade is scheduled for second day after the final game -- which if it goes to Game 7 on Halloween would be Election Day!  Parade would block access at least temporarily to a number of polling stations and election headquarters<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... and there's at least one polling place literally across the street from Fenway Park that was impacted quite hard by the previous series.

<p>I hope any St.Louis PMers aren't offended by the logo. They seem to be good sports fans out there, cheering good plays by both teams and booing lack of hustle by both.</p>

The logo seems to have worked. Thanks you!
<p>The St.Louis fans seem to be great sports, so I expect St.Louis PMers to accept it as a reasonable perogative of a volunteer sysadmin.</p>

<p>Not that it matters now, but don't you think they would have just rescheduled the parade? As it is they seem to be scheduling the parade for Saturday instead of Friday -- probably because  everyone would have taken Friday off anyway. Surely they would have done the same to avoid a conflict with the election...</p>
