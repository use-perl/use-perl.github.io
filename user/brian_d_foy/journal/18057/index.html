<p>I am no longer in Iraq, but I am not home yet, and do not expect me to be for at least another month.<br/><br/>The end of this thing has been pretty busy (and un-networked), so I have not made any progress on programming things.  I transferred a few modules to other people because I knew they wanted to work on them more than I did (and I am still open to that, really) so I could explore other things that I have thought up since I have been here. <br/><br/>Oh well.</p>

<h2>Thanks</h2>

...for your service and we're all glad you made it out of there whole.<br>

I'm reminded of a star trek novel called "Uhura's Song", wherein they encounter a group of semi-nomadic catlike beings, whose planet has a native lifeform they've christened 'welcome-homes', as when you're returning thru the forest to their camp, they raise an unholy chatter, and toss nuts and things at you. (don't know if I've gotten that description quite right.. it's been a while since I read that story.) Don't know if you're a star trek fan, but the story is highly enjoyable and one I wish they'd made into a show.<br> <br>Anyway, WELCOME HOME! *rustle rustle*
