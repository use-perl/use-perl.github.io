<p>Gnu has the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/ddd/">Data Display Debugger</a>, or ddd, and I even found <a href="http://www.linuxfocus.org/English/January1998/article20.html">an article in English about it</a>. I was going to ignore it for my <a href="http://www252.pair.com/comdog/mastering_perl/Chapters/debugger.html">chapter on debugging</a> in <a href="http://www.pair.com/comdog/mastering_perl/">Mastering Perl</a> until I saw that Peter Scott showed it breifly in <i>Perl Debugged</i>.<br/><br/>After much yak shaving last night (fix my FreeBSD routing table so I could cvsup ports so I could compile gcc34 so I could compile ddd), and much <a href="http://www.fulltiltpoker.com/">online poker playing</a> while the compilation was under way (won one tournament, second in two others, final table in another, and a miserable 48th in the last one, up 15,000 play chips by the end), I got this thing install. With more yak shaving to let my FreeBSD machine display thing on my Powerbook (not sure I had to use xhost last time I did this, odd) because my Intel laptop's monitor flickered a moment then never came back. It isn't fun editing /etc/rc.conf to set the defaultrouter when I can't see the screen. Some of you might really like the challenge, but I think it sucked. Although, punching the screen won't break it any worse. :)<br/><br/>So, does anyone use this? Does anyone happen to have the Mac OS X binary that seems to have disappeared from the net?<br/><br/>Aside from that, what else might you be using as a debugger or IDE? I know about Komodo, EPIC, and Affrus. What else is out there?</p>

<h2>ddd on OSX</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/sigzero/">sigzero</a> on 2006-10-02T01:08:30</h3>
You seem to be able to install it using macports.



<h2>Updating FreeBSD ports</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/tagg/">tagg</a> on 2006-10-02T07:36:33</h3>
Now that you've set up cvsup it may not be an issue anymore, but alternatively, check out <a href="http://www.daemonology.net/portsnap/" title="daemonology.net">portsnap </a daemonology.net> for updating your ports tree.



<h2>Yes, barely.</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jjore/">jjore</a> on 2006-10-02T16:28:01</h3>
I've used ddd only very lightly when debugging the C++ code at work and I might have loaded perl into it once or twice. It's one of those things I think I really ought to get goot at but haven't yet.<br><br>Either that or Emacs' GUD. Both probably. I ought to learn both. It's all gdb under the hood anyway.



<h2>Used it for debugging C</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/shild/">shild</a> on 2006-10-02T17:15:12</h3>
I used it to debug C code, although not lately.  It is great for displaying structures.<br>
For Perl I prefer the '-d' debugging.<br>
Are you adding debugging of XS modules? <br> If so I have a neat trick to debug using gdb that I learned from muppet on the perl-xs list.<br>  I haven't tried it with ddd, I should test it someday.

I won't cover XS debugging since I'm not covering XS stuff (leaving that to <i>Extending and Embedding Perl</i>), but what's your trick?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

Here are the instructions I got.  This has saved me a lot of debugging time.<br><br>#################################################<br><br>set the env var PASTHRU_INC when compiling your extension:<br><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; $ # turn on debugging symbols, turn off optimization (to<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; $ # prevent out-of-order execution that makes debugging<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; $ # rather confusing)<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; $ export PASTHRU_INC='-Wall -g -O0'<br><br>then you can run your program in gdb and be taken to the exactly right<br>spot when it crashes.  you can inspect all of the values to find out<br>what happened.<br><br>some versions of gdb don't get things right when you try to set a<br>breakpoint in a module that isn't loaded yet, and since xs modules are<br>dynamic objects then you run into this a lot.  i get around this by<br>running the perl debugger inside gdb.<br><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; $ gdb perl<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (gdb) set args -d mycoolscript.pl<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (gdb) run<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; DB # break here to get back to gdb<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; DB ^C<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (gdb) # set the breakpoint where you want... C function...<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (gdb) break gtk_main<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (gdb) # or the xsub<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (gdb) break XS_Gtk2_main<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (gdb) # go back to perl<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (gdb) continue<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; DB # carry on<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; DB c<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Breakpoint 1, XS_Gtk2_main (my_perl=0x800200, cv=0x8c1434) at<br>xs/Gtk2.c:381<br>
