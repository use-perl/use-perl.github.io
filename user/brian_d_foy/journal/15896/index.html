<p>That is, they are useless unless you can tell them what to do. I am forced to use these gub'ment computers that do not have any programming tools on them, so I cannot get a lot done.  I am amazed that anyone can get anything done without knowing at least a little of some language.<br/><br/>My laptop has about 10 perl programs that simply agreggate information for me so I do not have to do so much pointy-clicky stuff.  I can read use.perl without a web browser (a truly awful experience tempered only by the potential good info in the journals)---the program downloads all the recent journals and I just keep hitting the space bar.  I'll have to turn this into a CGI script or something so I can use it from a browser.  I have another program which scraps a couple of Army sites to pull together my daily update of stuff, but I haven't been able to use that either. And so on and so on...  Life takes so much longer without something to tell the computer what to do.<br/><br/>I bet there are people out there who go around banging things with hammers just because they have hammers, too.</p>

Geologists only bang on rocks so they can lick them.  The hammers are only a quick way to get to the juicy center.
