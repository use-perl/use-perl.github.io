<p>Where's the mailing list for those who've been threatened with legal action? I haven't been threatened yet, but it sounds like a pretty cool group to be a part of. Who do I have to call what where?<br/><br/>Maybe everyone can get sued and we can have BOFs and dinners during the trial. I haven't seen some of the people across the pond in quite a while.<br/><br/>If anyone calls me a name, I'll sue them. Then I'll call them a name, and they can sue me.  What fun!<br/><br/>I've left comments enabled so you can call me names and threaten me with legal action and what not.</p>

<h2>Names</h2>

Whats especially nice, is that everybody is using Sebastian's real name so every future employer can find this childish shit on google. That's much worse than this law suit shit.

Well, he used his real name in the emails which were being publicly archived anyway. So either way, google would have found out.

My sister was lamely threatened with legal action for mentioning a guy's name on her blog.  The guy moaned about the trauma or potential trauma this was causing in his marriage, work, and political aspirations.  But in complaining, the guy used his full name giving Google more bait.



<h2>Plenty of lawsuits for everyone!</h2>

<p>That's the first post on here in three years that needed to be modded up.  Does anyone get mod points any more?</p>

What's the point? Does anyone bother to set a threshold? This isn't Slashdot (fortunately).
