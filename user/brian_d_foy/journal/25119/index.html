<p>I've been doing some research to see if a TPF branded credit card might be a good thing. Maybe it could be, mayage it won't be. That's for TPF to decide once I hand over my homework.<br/><br/>As part of that, I'd like to play some of the banks against each other. I don't go for the affinity cards (the ones where an organization gets a portion of all your charges). If anyone has these, I'd like to know the issuing bank. I'm especially interested in banks who won't be limited to the US. You can leave a note here or talk to me in email :)</p>

For a decent rate...



<h2>I used to have a silly number of affinity cards.</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/wickline/">wickline</a> on 2005-06-10T01:13:14</h3>
I believe all/most of them were MBNA. This was almost a decade ago, and for all I know they may have been the only significant affinity card shop back then. I really can't say much about the company one way or the other as I'd not made any significant use of the cards.<br> <br>I'd gotten sick of getting credit card offers in the mail. It seemed that every day at least one offer would arrive. Most of the offers seemed very familiar, as though the compaies had nothing better to do than spam my mailbox every week or two. I thought maybe I could get them to stop by accpeting their offers.<br> <br>For about two years I accepted every credit card offer I got via mail. They did finally stop sending offers after I'd collected a few dozen cards over about a year and a half<br> <br>My wife and I would joke about charging them all up (to a sizable six-figure total) for cash advances and/or jewelery or other liquid assets and then starting a new life in another country.<br> <br>Never happened. When we started talking about buying a house one day (three or four years back), I spent a day canceling the cards. I never paid a penny of interest on any card, or even used the majority of them so there was no ill affect on my credit.

the card(if we pull it through) will be a way to support  perl fundation and get a credit card that have a camel on it. <p>

see the <a href="http://perlmonks.org/?node_id=463462/" title="perlmonks.org">http://perlmonks.org/?node_id=463462/</a perlmonks.org>meditation on the topic on perlmonks.</p>

I don't think you (personally) will be able to get a card unless you hook up with a bank in China that will issue the card.

<h2>Credit card motto?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/bluto/">bluto</a> on 2005-06-10T15:57:37</h3>
Is there going to be some kind of motto for the card?  Perhaps something like...
<p>
Just another Perler (in) Hock
</p> <p><nobr> <wbr></nobr>... or<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...
</p> <p>
There's More Than One Way to To Debt It
