<p>Pudge tells me that SourceForge is having some problems with its File Release System.  Files do not get attached to releases.  Apparently this has been a problem for a couple of months.<br/><br/>On the "release" side, Module::Release looks at a chunk of HTML to figure out if the file was added.  Apparently, that chunk of text,  "Adding file", shows up even if there is an error. <br/><br/>That is just another reason to love SourceForge.</p>

<h2>Oooooh, yeah</h2>

Oh yeah, I should have told you about that.  I never bothered investigating, 'cause I wasn't too interested in the SF.

When I get that far into my queue of work, I am going to break Module::Release into separate modules for CVS, SF, and so on.  That should make things much easier to test and develop.<br> <br>As far as I know right now, though, this is a problem with SourceForge because it doesn't work by hand, either.

<h2>FRS</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/djberg96/">djberg96</a> on 2004-05-18T21:48:04</h3>
I've always thought SourceForge's FRS system was *DUMB*.
<p>
"Let me get this straight - I can't use the web interface to upload a file.  I have to ftp it using an anonymous login.  Oh, and I have to remember to cd to the '/incoming' directory first, then upload it.  Then, I grab it out of a pool of files and attach it to my project.  Oh, and anyone could steal my files before I have the chance to associate them with my project.  Got it".
</p><p>
Totally retarded crap.  This is the only GForge interface I've seen that does this.  On the other ones (well, one) that I use, you upload the file directly via a "choose file" button - one easy step.  None of this ftp-and-grab-it-out-of-a-pool crap.</p>

Is there a better, public service or do you have a local installation?

For Perl?  No, there isn't one, which is kinda why I would like to see a PerlForge.  I suppose there's always Savannah.

Savannah is also PHP based. However, there is a perl-based alternative. Autrijus' openfoundry is based on RT and various other pieces of perl. (http://rt.openfoundry.org)

You can upload a file through the web interface.  I didn't try that in this case.  I don't know how long they've had the file upload, but it is indeed there.  At least, you can in the QRS; it appears maybe you can't in the FRS.
