<p>Since I got back from holiday I have wondered how much force I might have generated on the <a href="http://disneyland.disney.go.com/disneylandresort/Disneyland/Lands/Attractions/index?id=1039">Disneyland teacups</a>.<br/><br/>I think I literally hurt my brain (and if I did, I could engage <a href="http://www.scarlettlawgroup.com/traumatic_brain_injury_biomechanics.html">San Francisco Brain Injury Attorneys</a>). <a href="http://maic.jmu.edu/journal/4.2/Focus/Bass/bass.htm">Cameron R. Bass of University of Virginia</a> says that the head can withstand 60 times the force of gravity, and the <a href="http://ttb.eng.wayne.edu/user/cavanau/brain2.html">Wayne State Concussion Limit Curve</a> seems to agree (although some monkeys they slammed into windshields withstood up to 85 time the force of gravity), but I think means pancaking the skull and dying.  I do not want to know if I died (I did not), just if it was a concussion that made me want to sit down for a couple of hours, and, as a side curiousity, if age and concussion tolerance have an inverse relationship.  I am pretty sure that I spun as fast in the teacups when I was a kid, but I do not remembering wondering if I had hurt my brain.  Nowadays I wonder if there is such a thing as a brain bruise.<br/><br/>With a back-of-the-envelope calculation I figure my head was experiencing 5 or 6 times the force of gravity when I leaned back.  I have seen <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0086197">The Right Stuff</a> and know that I cannot stand as much as those supermen, but just how wussy is my brain?  Going 5 or 6 Gs may not sound like a lot, but I was about to lose my $9 hamburger and fries, and then felt not-so-well for a while. <br/><br/>After I did the rough calculation, I wanted to refine it a bit.  I estimate two variables---radius and angular momentum---to produce the third value, the force.  I do not have Mathematica, but I remembered that Apple has a 3D graphing calculator that I have never used and this is perfect.  I can put in the equation, set the domains, and have a nice picture that I can save with a screenshot.  However, I cannot find the calculator, so no pretty force surfaces.  Damn graphing calculator---there when I do not want you and missing when I need you.  Damn dirty calculator!<br/><br/>This is the information age, however, and someone must of thought of this before.  Indeed, at least one person <a href="http://www.geocities.com/disneylander2k/cups.htm">rode every teacup and rated its force producing capabilities</a>, but provided no hard measurements.  His calculations are close to mine, though.</p>
