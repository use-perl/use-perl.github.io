<h1>Automatic license detection in Perl distributions</h1>

<div class="span8">
<p>Before I reinvent the wheel..<br/><br/>So, given an arbitrary Perl distribution (anything in BackPAN), does anyone have code to guess the license for the code? I know that I can look in META.yml if someone typed the right things somewhere, but that's not enough. Many distributions aren't well-formed, and there are a lot of different ways to license code.<br/><br/>And, does anyone know of Perl distributions that contains files that have different licenses so that that distribution isn't covered by a single license? File A is under License Foo but File B is under Licence Quux, or something like that.</p>

<h2>See Module::Install ?</h2>

<p>When I used Module::Install it (a) griped about me citing GPL then "All Rights Reserved", then also (b) detected a "same terms as Perl itself" statement, and finally (c) wrote the META.yml for me.</p><p>That suggests some smarts are in there somewhere, so my suggestion would be to check that dist out.</p><p>...specifically sub license_from() in Module/Install/Metadata.pm, now I've looked!</p>

<p>That's not smart enough. It's just looking for strings in files without knowing anything about their context. It doesn't discover license versions either.</p><p>Thanks though<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<h2>Software::License fwiw</h2>

<p>Software::License is an extended, refactored version of what's in M:I.  I'm not sure exactly what you want beyond what M:I does, though, so I have no idea if S:L is more useful at all.</p>

<p>I looked at Software::License, but it looked like something that went the other way. All I saw was stuff to write the correct text somewhere.</p><p>I'm indexing BackPAN, so I want to look at a bunch of files I can't change and get an answer back about what license is present, no matter what they have done.</p><p>For instance, some of the files might not have any license notice, but the distro has a COPYING file.</p><p>I'm not concerned about any legal stuff and what people should do, just what they have done (that I can't change).</p><p>Making people do the right thing is not what I care about for this problem.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<p>S:LicenseUtils has methods for looking at POD or META.yml (which isn't very good for getting specifics).  It doesn't try to look at anything else, but could.</p><p>It's just, you know, heuristics.</p>

<h2>Debian's dh-make-perl...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/gwolf/">gwolf</a> on 2008-09-02T22:57:44</h3>
In the Debian pkg-perl group, we extensively use a tool developed by us called dh-make-perl, that creates the basic skeleton of a Perl package ready to be assimilated. One of our core requirements is to have the proper copyright information - As often as possible, we take the information from META.yml - but it's often not specified, or even worse, is completely bogus (i.e. META declares one license but a different licensing is explicitly mentioned elsewhere.<br>
You can <a href="http://svn.debian.org/wsvn/pkg-perl/trunk/dh-make-perl/dh-make-perl?op=file&amp;rev=0&amp;sc=0" title="debian.org">take a look at our (quite ugly, yes) dh-make-perl</a debian.org>. It tries to get this information from META.yml, then from several popular files (i.e. LICENSE, COPYING, etc.), and from the module's POD. And, of course, it goes on to create a <a href="http://wiki.debian.org/Proposals/CopyrightFormat" title="debian.org">machine-parsable debian/copyright file</a debian.org> (of course, machine-parsable according to our sick and twisted standards).<br>
I looked a bit into CPAN modules offering this functionality, but found nothing. If you think it's worth it, I can weed it out of dh-make-perl and make it into its own module.

<p>I skimmed the code, and maybe it's what I need. If you guys are using it to guess the license, you're probably doing the same thing I am. I'll look more closely in a few days.</p><p>Did the debian people steal ideas from anyone else? Do the other linux distros do this too?</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<h2>CPANTS has_license</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/gabor/">gabor</a> on 2008-09-02T23:16:16</h3>
CPANTS has a broken version of what you are looking for.
<p>
It is broken partially as it is not yet clear what exactly it needs to look for.</p>



<h2>Multiple licences</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/drhyde/">drhyde</a> on 2008-09-03T11:41:22</h3>
<p>CPU::Emulator::Z80 has three different licences.  Most of it is "GPL2 or artistic" and some of the tests are GPL2 only.  That's because I took the tests from a GPL2 project, but I want the bits that are all my own work to be even more free.
