<p>I spent a while talking to the fine folks over at <a href="http://www.apress.com">Apress</a> today.  They just published Randal's <a href="http://apress.com/book/bookDisplay.html?bID=307">Perls of Wisdom</a> and Scott Walter's <a href="http://apress.com/book/bookDisplay.html?bID=355">Perl 6 Now</a>.  You'll have to wait for the next issue of <a href="http://www.theperlreview.com">The Perl Review</a> for reviews.<br/><br/>Besides that, they told me that they have this huge pile of free stuff to give away, but only 8 user groups are registered with them.  I know we have more Perl Mongers groups than that!  <a href="http://apress.com/userGroups/">Register and get free stuff</a>. </p>

<h2>Talking to Apress? Gah!</h2>

Apress was supposed to have sent you a promo copy of Perl 6 Now a long time ago along with a dozen Perl Mongers groups (the ones that actually responded of the more than 30 I emailed) but it looks like nothing went out. Gah! There are sample chapters on <a href="http://perl6now.com/" title="perl6now.com">http://perl6now.com</a perl6now.com> by the way, but I know *I* for one am waiting for The Perl Review's review<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)<br>

They did send me the promo copy on CD, but it was broken, and then I was travelling for a bit.  Thanks for the link:  I'll include it with the review.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:xy  --- I think I'll just leave that in there.
