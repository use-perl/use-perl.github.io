<div class="span8">
<p>Last week I learned a lot about Mac OS X just by noticing what Randal was doing while we were in meetings.  Someday I want to famous enough be able to openly surf the web in meetings and have the client thank me for it.  And, I realized, he does things differently than I do, and a lot of them get the job done better.<br/><br/>This situation is described in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1578517087/briandfoy-20">The Social Life of Information</a>.  We do not learn everything by reading books---we learn most of what we know because we see other people do or say it.  Since you cannot sit in my office and watch me (that's by policy, not geography :), today I kept a list of the things I picked up on.<br/><br/>I started making a list of ten things, but then I wanted to throw in a bonus item, and then I lost control.<br/><br/><ol>
<li>My use.perl reader gets confused with unicode because Sean Burke has fancy looking quotes in his  entries.  Those explain the rest of the warnings I get from Text::Autoformat.
<li>Running while it is snowing isn't bad---it's the day after when it is icy that I should worry about breaking an ankle.
<li>If I am going to run while it's cold, I should route my Camelback hose down my sleeve to keep the water in the tube warm.
<li>AppleScript can talk to other machines with <code>tell application "Foo" of machine "Bar"</code>
<li>RealOne Player will not accept remote AppleEvents (as documented), so I have to find another way to do that.
<li><a href="http://www.geekcruises.com/home/ae_home.html">GeekCruises is leading a digital photography cruise to Alaska</a>.  Imagine going on vacation and beign able to get expert help with your spiffy new camera.  Sadly I already have plans.
<li>Derrick Story's <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/digphotopg/">Digital Photography Pocket Guide</a> has some great tips.
<li><a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/interests/oreilly/">O'Reilly's ThinkGeek</a> gift shop is public, and it does not have the Gone Green logo (yet).
<li><a href="http://www.panix.com/user/comdog/Pictures/tough_guys.jpg">My kitten</a> has learned how to open cabinets by standing on the microwave.  So that's how that's happening.
<li>I can get volume names with Mac::Carbon, so I do not need Mac::AppleScript.
<li>Mac::Path::Util sucks (and I wrote it).
<li>Weapons inspectors made their first inspections today and nobody called me.  No war this week.
<li>USB Printer Sharing between Mac System 9 and Mac OS X does not work.  Now I am in a bind---might have to revert to FreeBSD for printer sharing.
<li>An alias in the Dock does not necessarily do what an alias in the Finder does, but I can just drag the original application icon into the Dock anyway.
<li>A single "f" in Welsh is pronounced as a "v", so I have been pronouncing a name incorrectly for a month.
<li>IMAX Star Wars Attack of the Clones has scenes missing, but the production of Die Walkure I saw does not (and stops for dinner).
<li>Walgreen's sells blank CDs at a good price.
<li>PAUSE uses mod_perl.  I should have known that, but I have never really thought about it.
<li>CPANPLUS is still too young for automated testing.
<li>Test::More's like() is better than is() is better than ok(), for what I do.
<li>Telemarkers now leave recorded messages on answering machines.  I need to block calls that do not expose caller-id.
<li>CGI.pm make new style query strings using semicolons as the default (since version 2.64).
<li>Intel sells the SpringPort cheaper than retail---a lot cheaper.
<li>Mozilla 1.2 sucks.  I thought it was just me, but other people have the same problems.
<li><a href="http://pudge.sourceforge.net/">Chris Nandor has a SourceForge project</a>.
<li><a href="http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/91.htm">According to the Geneva Convention, enemy prisoners of war can receive as many letters as they like, but the Detaining Power may set a quota on the number they send.</a>
<li>Major League baseball owns the Montreal Expos---the team I did not care about when I collected baseball cards (back in the day).
<li>Spike, the character on Buffy, got his name from something to do with railroad spikes.
<li>Rafael gets to sync the perlfaq trees.
<li>Nat is working on Ram 2.
<li>There are teeth marks on one of my monitor cables, and neither of the cats is owning up to it.
