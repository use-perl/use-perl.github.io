<p>I am getting up really early every day because I just cannot sleep that long.  My body is not used to all of this free time.<br/><br/>And, now that I have an open ssh port, I can commit a lot of the things I have been working on them.  Not only do other people have to worry about the back-ups and whatnot, but other people can see them too.<br/><br/>I committed to CVS my Perl Module Browser.  I have decided to call it a module browser since perl does not really operate at the class level.  I could create a module Acme::SomeoneElse, but it could really define the LWP::Tetris package.  The file name is not the package.<br/><br/>What I have now depends on Tk and CPAN.pm, so you have to be able to use those.  CPAN.pm likes to get things off of the network unless you have a local CPAN (but you could probably fake it with just the modules directory which has the meta-data files which I need).<br/><br/>Despite its early stages and primitive nature, it has been very useful to me already.  I am even using it to develop it, although <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/petdance/Apache-Pod-0.03/lib/Apache/Pod.pm">Apache::Pod</a> can deliver a lot of the same stuff.<br/><br/>If you want to skip the hassle of installing Tk and making an X server work on your Mac, I have <a href="http://www.pair.com/user/comdog/Perl/perlbrowser1.pdf">one [24k PDF]</a> or <a href="http://www.pair.com/user/comdog/Perl/perlbrowser2.pdf">two [24k PDF]</a> pretty pictures.<br/><br/>The <a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/brian-d-foy/perlbrowser/">SourceForge CVS browser</a> seems to be having problems at the moment (maybe it needs to update from a master server or something).  You can use anonymous CVS to checkout the sources. The password is "anonymous".  Enter that after using <code>cvs login</code>.<br/><br/><pre>
cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/brian-d-foy login
 
cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/brian-d-foy co perlbrowser 
</pre><br/><br/>The next thing I need to do is handle links in the POD so that I can jump from one module to the next.  I am not sure how I want to do this.  Maybe I should make the text in the big pane HTML if someone already has a widget for that sort of thing.<br/><br/>I would also like to add tabs so I can keep the size of the main window small but still give access to a lot of information.  I am thinking about the pane that some web browsers put on the left to show histories, links, and so on.  I need to learn more Tk though.  That is a lot more difficult than any of the simple widgets I have ever made.<br/><br/>Of course, a lot of this stuff would be really easy to do as a mod_perl plug-in, and I should develop this thing to keep the display layer separate, but for now I am playing with Tk.  I do not want to assume that every computer will have a webserver anyway (although part of perlbrowser could be a tiny webserver).</p>
