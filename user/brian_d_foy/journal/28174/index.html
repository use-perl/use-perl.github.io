<p>chromatic's brother's son kicked me in the kidneys. Several times.<br/><br/>Here's how this completely true story (according to Allison, who told it to me), happened: I flew from Salt Lake City to San Jose on the 28th. I sat in my usual exit row seat, and a toddler sat in the seat directly behind me. He wasn't having a good time during most of the flight and took it out on the seat-back in front of him. Being that I was on a puddle-jumper type aircraft, the seat transferred most of the force from his feat directly to my back.<br/><br/>This isn't such an odd thing, though. I didn't find out until the next day who the kid was. At dinner with Allison, she asked me if I was on the flight in from Salt Lake City the previous night. I thought she must have been on the flight too and I just missed seeing her. Nope: chromatic's brother's son's mother saw the nametape on the back of my carry-on and recognized it when (Allison|chromatic) mentioned that I was in town, then related the story. Allison found out about the story and told me about it at dinner.<br/><br/>It's not all that exciting, and it was probably more interesting to me since I was part of the adventure, and you're probably sorry that you've read this far. As far as I know, it's completely true, and even if it isn't, some kid was still kicking me.</p>
