<p>Unfortunately I am stuck with public computers running Windows something or other.<br/><br/>I have a USB key drive, and it has been a very painful process to install an SSH client on it.  Windows keeps trying to install things on the hard drive rather than my removeable drive.<br/><br/>Hopefully, once I get that all set up, I can commit to CVS from that.  I might be able to install Perl too, and then maybe, just maybe, I can use my release script.<br/><br/>Don't hold your breath.</p>

The "putty" ssh client for Windows is really easy to install.  First, you<br>download the binary from the web site.  Then, you run it.  (Insert<br>fingerprint-checking in between the two steps, if you like).<br> <br>You can also download "pscp" and "psftp" programs, each one standalone again.<br> <br>Putty is what I always use when I'm stuck in front of a Windows box.<br> <br>I have no idea where it stores config info, though.<br>

<ul><li><i>I have no idea where it stores config info, though.</i></li></ul>  <br> <p>It puts it all in the Window Registry.<br> </p><p>I haven't found the right magic to encapsulate and move these settings from machine to machine, yet.  Although I haven't tried too hard.<br> </p><p>Does anyone know how to extract Registry information in a portable form that can easily be loaded onto another machine?</p>

Run "regedit", find the correct branch of settings and chose Registry | Export Registry File...<br> <br>This will save a little plain-text file with the contents of that branch.<br> <br>Move to another computer and run the file.

I thought I tried that and it didn't work, but it's been awhile since I've been there and tried that...<br> <p>Thanks.  I'll try again.<br> </p><p>What I really want is to save my favorite settings  for when I change machines.</p>

Putty also has pretty much everything configurable from the command line.  <p>
<code>putty -ssh -2 hostname.domain.ext</code> </p><p>
so you could just make batch files in the putty folder for your mostly used ssh sessions and just have everything on the command line. The batch file could even run the putty -clean at the end if you want to clean your tracks.</p>

oops, <a href="http://the.earth.li/user/sgtatham/putty/0.53b/htmldoc/Chapter3.html#3.7" title="earth.li">here are the actual command line options</a earth.li> and it's putty -cleanup and you can't specify window size or colors from the command line, but there might be enough.

I'm using TeraTerm Pro with the SSH extensions.  It is easy to install too, but Windows keeps getting in the way.  I think it is the fascist settings on the public computer.

<h2>PuTTY</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Mr. Muskrat/">Mr. Muskrat</a> on 2003-12-30T14:05:03</h3>
<p>I agree with mary.poppins.  Go with PuTTY (<a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/user/sgtatham/putty/mirrors.html" title="greenend.org.uk">mirrors</a greenend.org.uk>).</p>
<p>Download PuTTY (get the<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.zip file).  Extract the files to a directory on your USB key drive.  Create your keys and store them on your USB key drive as well.  When you run PuTTY, use the following command to tell PuTTY to remove the registry keys and random file.  <tt>putty -cleanup</tt> </p>



<h2>[offtopic] stop loss?</h2>

brian d foy,<br> <br>I know this is way off topic, but are you affected by the recent bunch of "stop<br>loss" orders that prevent people from leaving the military at the end of their<br>contract?  What sort of reaction are soldiers having to these orders?<br>
