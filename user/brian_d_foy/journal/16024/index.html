<div class="span8">
<p>A couple weeks ago, I had an idea as I was walking across the desert.  If I could pretend to be base.pm, I could do whatever I wanted whenever a module did a <code>use base</code>, and along the way I could map the @ISA tree.  Now, this was just for fun, since I know that every module does not use base.pm.  <br/><br/>First, the code:<br/><br/><pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl -w
use strict;<br/><br/>$INC{'base.pm'} = 1;<br/><br/>package base;<br/><br/>sub import { 
	my $class  = shift;
	my $caller = ( caller )[0];<br/><br/>	$main::Isa{$caller} = [ @_ ];<br/><br/>	foreach my $package ( @_ )
		{
		eval {  eval "require $package"  };
		}
	}<br/><br/>package main;<br/><br/>eval {  eval "require $ARGV[0]"  };<br/><br/>delete $INC{'base.pm'};<br/><br/>display( $ARGV[0], 0 );<br/><br/>sub display
	{	
	my( $key, $level ) = @_;<br/><br/>	my $space = "\t" x ($level + 1);
	print "$space$key\n";
	return unless UNIVERSAL::isa( $main::Isa{$key}, 'ARRAY' );
	
	foreach my $key ( sort { lc $a cmp lc $b } @{ $main::Isa{$key} } )
		{
		display( $key, $level + 1 );
		}
	}
</pre><br/><br/>First, I have to make Perl think it has already loaded base.pm, otherwise it will load it when a module tries to use it.  The %INC hash keeps track of that, so I create the right key and give it a true value (although you typically find path names there).<br/><br/>Second, I create my base package and its import routine.  This is the subroutine that perl calls when I <code>use base qw(foo bar)</code>.  I do some magic to pull out @ISA, and store it.  I do everything with full pacakge specifications because somewhere along the way I was worried about things going kablooey with all my shenanigans (for instance, can I trust vars.pm when I am fooling around like this?)<br/><br/>Third, I go back to the main package, load the module named on the command line, and I am off to the races.  Once I am all done, I pretty print the stuff in @Inc.<br/><br/>Fourth, I realize although I have a lot of fun, this is a really stupid thing to do and it is not very illuminating.  It is more like an extra credit homework problem than a useful task.</p>

You can push a smart subref into @INC that noted the activity and then figured out what actually was needed, kinda like an AUTOLOAD.

<p>I tried pushing a subref into <tt>@ISA</tt> once.  I was sad when it didn't work.  Someday, I'll look at the core about it.</p>

How would that work?  I mean, I know I can do just about anything with a subref, but I have never played around with those.  They sound like the spawn of satan, sort of like pseudo-hashes.
