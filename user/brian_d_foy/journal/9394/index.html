<p>A couple of weeks ago <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/brian_d_foy/journal/9181">I ordered a Xircom SpringPort Wireless Ethernet module</a>.  I was not sure the price was right because it was so low, so I thought it might not show up.<br/><br/>When I got back from my trip yesterday it was waiting for me.  I needed to charge it for two hours before I used it so I went to bed while I left it in my HandSpring cradle.<br/><br/>Today I tried to use it.  Oops!  I use a Mac---no network HotSync for me.  The Apple iSync stuff apparently is just a front end for the HotSync Manager.  The HTML browser that comes with it requires a proxy server that I have to sign up to use---no thanks.  I need to find some network tools for this thing.  Maybe I could reverse engineer the network HotSync functionality so I can support it on the Mac.<br/><br/>So, when is Perl going to be on the Palm OS?</p>

<h2>Comments!?</h2>

I just had to put a comment here.<br> <br>I haven't had much time to play with my Springport yet on my Visor Pro. I haven't really explored the network hotsync. I have got it to work on a wide open network and a vpn'd network.<br> <br>I definitely need to start looking at wifi apps for the palm now.



<h2>Hm</h2>

I don't understand the problem; iSync/HotSync works great for me.  Maybe it is a Handspring/Visor problem?
