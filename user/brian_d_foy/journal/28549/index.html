<p>A while ago, Sarah Burcham and I were talking about making a bunch of Perl wristbands (just like the Livestrong bands, etc), so when I got back from the holiday, I went out and had 1,000 #perl wristbands (see <a href="http://www.pair.com/comdog/wristbands/">some pics</a>) made (and yes, in hindsight, I should have made that #!perl, but we were talking about IRC too and that's what stuck in my mind when I ordered them. We'll fix that in version 2).<br/><br/>We figured we've give Perl Mongers people, friends, and family the chance to take a bunch off our hands at cost, so before I start selling them at $2 a band (and that includes shipping in the US and taxes!), PM groups can buy them in bulk and just pay our costs.<br/><br/>If you're interested in that, send me some mail and we'll work it out. In the next couple of weeks I'll get my act together so I can sell these online.<br/><br/>We're hoping to turn around most of that money to donate to YAPC Chicago, or even make some different wristbands for YAPC. :)

some twat points out that the lettering is all caps, eh?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

Actually, that happened pretty quickly, but that's all you get unless you pay the big bucks for fancy lettering.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

I think most people are able and willing to pay $5 for them.  I think they should be promoted as a $5 donation and maybe at YAPC have an option for students to pay $2.

That could be, but I wasn't focussed to much on mining the money in the Perl community.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br><br>Right now, for the cool kids, Perl Mongers, and whoever sees this before I start to really sell them (maybe I should have waited until I moved into my new place<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:), I'll give the big discount.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
