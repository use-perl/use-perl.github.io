<p>For anyone that cares, I'll be off the grid for about three weeks while I take care of my annual military thing.<br/><br/>If you send me a patch and I ignore it, it's because I probably didn't see it rather than one of the other excuses I tend to use. If you need to be ignored by someone right away, email Randal. I'll be back to ignoring things in the usual manner in October (when I then have to ignore things because Randal is making me go on a cruise).<br/><br/>The only worrisome part is the beater Powerbook I'm taking with me. I just put Tiger on my old Titanium and have been installing things I think I'll need. I'm probably going to forget something essential (hey, I just thought tonight "I should install subversion", so that was close!).  I should be able to still get work done although nobody will get to see the result of it for a while.  No matter: the editor is cracking the whip for <i>Intermediate Perl</i> so I should hammer on that while I'm off the net.</p>

<p>I've got into the habit of keeping everything I download. It just goes in an svk repository called 'installers'. Being able to just copy it across to new boxes has saved my bacon several times.</p>

Yeah, I used to do that, then I needed more space for pirated MP3s and internet porn. I'm going to need a terabyte drive soon.

<p>The scary thing is that terabyte drives are pretty darn affordable these days (although I want two so I can RAID them<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>

I &lt;heart&gt; LaCie's TB drives enough that I bought five of them.  Two for data, two for backups, and a spare.

Embed the MP3 data into the porn images (a-la steganography). Must be some space saving in there somewhere.. or at least it will cut down on your files!
