<p>The <A href="http://workshop.perl.pt/ptpw2008/">Portugeuse Perl Workshop</a> is less than a month away, and I'm giving a keynote about "Why People Are Passionate About Perl" on June 4. So, why are you passionate about Perl?<br/><br/>I've been thinking about this quite a bit since we selected the topic. I can only really talk about why <i>I</i> am passionate about Perl. I want to talk more about that in the keynote. Post your story somewhere. If you don't think I'll find it, send me a link. I'll google the title "Why People Are Passionate About Perl" though :)<br/><br/>I've also been thinking that I want to do this keynote without slides, or at least the boring sort that are really just talking points. Chicago doesn't have 10 of the world most dangerous anythings, so Damian's approach is right out (and I don't have the Chicago accent anyway). I can't think fast enough or clever enough to use the Takahashi Method. I don't especially like orange, so copying Leon's slides don't quite fit either.<br/><br/>I figured I'd take a few good stories of people and their passion for Perl and show their picture on the screen while I told it. Then, in the audio that I'll record for <a href="http://www.perlcast.com">Perlcast</a>, I'll figure out how to make the album artwork be the slides. Or do something else like that.<br/><br/>Here's a set of questions, mini interview style, to get you started on your own post:<br/><br/><ul>
<li><b>The person who introduced me to Perl showed me that...</b>
<li><b>I first starting using Perl to...</b>
<li><b>I kept using Perl because...</b>
<li><b>I can't stop thinking about Perl...</b>
<li><b>I'm still using Perl because...</b>
<li><b>I get other people to use Perl by...</b>
<li><b>I also program in ... and ..., but I like Perl better since...</b>
</ul><br/><br/><i>[Note: I've turned off comments. If you want to tell me why you are passionate about Perl, make a blog post somewhere. Explain to the world why you really, really like Perl (and I mean like like!). I think they call this thing a meme. ]</i><br/><br/><i>[Note note: Steal this meme for Python, or Ruby, or Java, or LISP, or whatever. I think the most enjoyable posts from my "<a href="http://use.perl.org/user/brian_d_foy/journal/32556">Five Things I Hate About Perl</a>" where actually the ones from other languages. I learned the most from those. ]</i>
