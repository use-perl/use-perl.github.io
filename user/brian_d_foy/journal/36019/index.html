<p>In 12 hours I leave for the <a href="http://perl-qa.hexten.net/wiki/index.php/OsloQAWorkshop2008">Oslo QA Hackathon</a>. Right now I'm copying all 10 Gb of BackPAN to a portable USB drive and a thumb drive. It's taking a long time. While I waited I created a <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&hl=en&msa=0&msid=103796120077176421266.000449ca10b9c9bda06fb&ll=60.052033,10.913305&spn=0.351013,0.929718&t=h&z=10">Google Map for the things I need to find in Oslo</a> (such as my hotel).<br/><br/>April 2 is the <a href="http://oslo.pm.org">Oslo.pm</a> meeting. I get into town about eight hours before that, so here's hoping that I can stay awake for it. When I went to Oslo for NPW 2006, I ended up staying up all night because nobody told me they don't turn off the sun during the summer. There I am thinking it's about dinner time and it's 1 am. I should have an easier time with the QA Hackathon because the sun actually sets. It looks like it will be nice Chicago weather too.<br/><br/>Now that it's Oslo time, I can start thinking about the stuff I want <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/brian_d_foy/journal/35944">to do at the hackathon</a>. Part of my task is indexing BackPAN. Besides finding modules in distributions, I also want to find packages, I think. By convention, we normally make a package per file and give it the same names, but it doesn't have to be that way. So how to find the package names given a file? I could just match the text, but I think I want to try using PPI to look for real package declarations. It's a bit easier than the normal problem since <code>package</code> has a bareword following it. I won't mess with those in <code>eval</code>. That's a nice little project for the plane ride.<br/><br/>Jonas from Copenhagen tells me he might come out for the weekend, and since he's training for a marathon and I'm working toward a half-marathon, I also need to go running when I get there so he doesn't kill me on a Sunday long run. That's okay. I get in at about noon and I don't get to check in to the hotel until 3. I need something to pass the time anyway. :)</p>
