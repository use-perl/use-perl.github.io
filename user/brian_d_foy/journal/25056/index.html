<p>While I was on my big camping trip Apple changed the format of the iTunes binary library file. I finally got some time to look at it this weekend (it helps that someone wants to pay me to do this).<br/><br/>I thought it might be a simple fix: find out a few points of difference and code around them.  No big whoop. I've done that with previous versions.<br/><br/>But, looking at the files, I don't see anything I recognize. Well, I know what the first 16 bytes are, but after that there isn't a human readable string. It's compressed or encrypted or something.<br/><br/>But, luckily, I'm off to WWDC and there is someone there who may be able to help. Well, he has the knowledge, so I'm hoping he isn't bound by an NDA, a hatred of Perl, or a revulsion to money.</p>

<h2>plist?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/pudge/">pudge</a> on 2005-06-07T23:30:53</h3>
Is it a plist file?  Apple now uses binary formats for plist files.  I don't know how to get at the data programatically, but it's the same data, and Property List Editor (in<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/Developer/ somewhere) can read it.

No, it isn't a plist file, it appears to be encoded somehow, I know apple has used base 64, but this doesn't appear to be base 64 encoded, I could be wrong... I don't have a good resource on what typical encodings look like so I can't really tell.
