<p>I have been away from the internet for a while.  IF you thought it was tough to get a service technician wherever you are, try out in the middle of the desert!  After three weeks someone came out to fix our satelite dish.<br/><br/>In the mean time I have been working on a thing called perlbrowser, which is that class browser I was blathering about earlier.  I do not have anything to upload yet, but it is already immensely useful to me.  It is a little Tk thing where I can select a module, and in tabbed panes it shows me the docs, code, symbol table, ISA tree, dependencies, CPAN info, local installation info, and which versions came with which version of perl.  Using Tk::CodeText, I got everything syntax highlighted.  It even has "bookmarks". I'm still learning a lot of the Tk stuff, but most of the functionality is there (even if it isn't pretty). <br/><br/>At some point I will turn it into a class (it is a big messy bottom-up script right now) so you can overload various parts of it, and I will get it upload to something when I finish up a couple of annoying glitches.<br/><br/>I need to find out how to make links in text, though, so a mention of a module in the docs or code (or even a mention of a subroutine) can hyperlink to that module.  Too bad I am doing this with just the Tk docs, which are not all that great if you do not know anything. :)<br/><br/>I also have a lot of good pictures of camels :)</p>

It sounds very interesting, I am curious on how you visualize the symbol table?<br> <br>jonasbn

Right now I take the output from Module::SymDump (or soemthing like that), turn it into POD, and simply display it.  However, I want those sorts of things to be pluggable so that others can override it.<br> <br>Once I get a chance to have a bit more computer time, I'll upload what I have.
