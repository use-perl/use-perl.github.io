<p>I don't have the packages yet, but UPS says that TPR got into Portland around 5 am, and that they were put on the truck at 7:12 am.  I hope that means they  will show up at Stonehenge (Consulting, not the mystical teleportation station) before 10 am.<br/><br/>I'm getting a pretty good rate of new subscriptions too, although I could always use more.  Some people are asking me to print "The Best for the First Two Years" or something like that.  If I had the money, that wouldn't be too much of a problem. :)</p>

Hi, Brian! Could I support the perl community a bit by providing an interest-free loan to you to get The Best of TPJ printed?

Thanks for the offer. I'd rather get an interest-free loan to print The Best of TPR.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br> <br>When I get back from the conference I'll think about this special issue more, but what I really need more than a loan is just a sense of how many people would actually buy it, and what they think the best articles are (or, at least, the articles that they want reprinted).  That way I can order a bunch of them and immediately send them out to a bunch of people rather than take up a lot of space in my office while one and two orders a day come in.

<p>I would<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

</p><p>You can always open a subscription stating it won't be valid unless X people are interested in it...</p>

Okay, here's a plan.<br> <br>When I get back from OSCON, I will get an estimate from the printer, then figure out how many I need to sell to make it work.  This special issue is probably going to be a small book (I think we have 300 pages of stuff, half of which may be worthy).<br> <br>Once I know the rough price, I will make an announcement.  When a certain number of people prepay, I'll do it.  As long as I can get a minimum commitment, I know the rest will come when I actually have it in my hands.<br> <br>
