<p>The editors at O'Reilly asked me for a list of people I think should review the next edition of <i>Learning Perl</i> and it's (separate) study guide.<br/><br/>I gave them a list, but that doesn't mean that those people have time to do it.<br/><br/>Does anyone else want to jump in? I'm not sure what O'Reilly does for tech reviewers, but at least we can put your name in the acknowledges, give you a free Stonehenge shirt, and a free pass to the Stonehenge party at OSCON.  Heck, I can even throw in a box full of vintage O'Reilly titles (my choice, slightly used). :)<br/><br/>Just send a note to me and I'll add you to the list of names I give to the editors. After that it's up to them what happens.</p>

Tech reviewers get a small amount of cash, an acknowledgement, and the ability to put on their resume the fact that they were a tech reviewer for a well-known book.<br> <br>For me the most valuable bit was the last.<br> <br>Incidentally I wouldn't mind being on the short list again.  Though if I am and Randal doesn't remember his promise to stop using $a and $b in example code (unless he's sorting of course), then I'm definitely going to have to do some tsking.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)<br> <br>Cheers,<br>Ben

<h3><a href="/user/brian_d_foy/">brian_d_foy</a> on 2005-03-13T05:12:07</h3>
Okay, I'll have to go through the samples looking for $a and $b.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

<h2>If you find any...</h2>

I sent you an email letting you know I was interested. I'm also posting here, in case you missed it.

<h2>If someone actually in the learning process counts</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/zatoichi/">zatoichi</a> on 2005-03-13T18:55:33</h3>
Add me to the list...<br/><br/>Robert



<h2>yup</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/kungfuftr/">kungfuftr</a> on 2005-03-13T19:44:57</h3>
Yup! I reckons i'd be up for it, especially seeing as I'm around a few people just starting to learn perl. So, add me to the list!



<h2>Tuits</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/KM/">KM</a> on 2005-03-13T23:29:32</h3>
I can usually find a few tuits for things like this. Add me on the list if you wish.



<h2>Me too</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/bart/">bart</a> on 2005-03-14T11:47:03</h3>
I'm not sure why should pick me, but I'm willing to go through the book and comment on it.<br> <br>I'm a perl user since 10 years, have been active on comp.lang.perl.misc and the MacPerl mailing list since 1996, and am a Perlmonks user since 2002.



<h2>Ditto</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/chaoticset/">chaoticset</a> on 2005-03-14T15:11:51</h3>
I sent an email as well.



<h2>Mee too!</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/pelagic/">pelagic</a> on 2005-03-22T11:46:51</h3>
I'd like to review it. Put me on that list if you wish.
