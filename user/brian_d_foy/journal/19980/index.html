<p>I just talked to the printers.  They had some extra time on the machines, so TPR gets the extra cycles (literal cycles too: things going round and round).  It looks like I'll have 1,000 copies in my hands on Friday. :)</p>

<p>Having checked your previous journal entries I see that 1000 was the number of copies you were originally aiming at, so you're not gaining extra copies here. So I infer it's delivery time. Without the extra cycles, when would the hardcopy have arrived?</p>
<p>I hope that it all works out, as these guys sound like a good bunch of printers to keep using.</p>

I'm not sure what you mean.  The delivery time from the printers to me would have been the same time, I think.  The printers are good, but I'm not sure I would have gotten bumped up in the schedule if I had a smaller order.<br> <br>Delivery time to the subscribers might be sooner.  I might be able to pack and mail these before I leave for OSCON.  Otherwise, I have to wait until I get back.<br> <br>I'm working on opening up subscription orders today too.

Well, paint me confused then too.  Why were you excited about the printer getting extra cycles, when it didn't mean a change externally whatsoever?  No extra copies, nor earlier?

I was excited because it was being printed earlier in the week rather than later.  The didn't have anything on the press, so they had extra time on the machine.<br> <br>The "extra" cycles apply to the printer's time.  If they can get one step of the process done sooner, then that step has less of a chance of impacting the timing of the next step. That's a lot of excitement for me, especially when I'm up against an OSCON deadline.<br> <br>

<h2>And...</h2>

when I will have one in my hand? Any idea?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

I don't get them from the printer before Monday, and then I'm at OSCON.  Once I get back I'll mail them out.  I have no way to estimate overseas shipping times though.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

Hehe. Now another question: didn't you say it would be available also on Internet? Or it will, but only after you ship them?

It will be available as a PDF to subscribers soon, and beyond that I'm not sure yet.<br>
