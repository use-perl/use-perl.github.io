Perl is the first relevant word, because the others are "stop words". There some modules on the CPAN to work with these stop words. There are also a lot of modules to index text (even if your first intention isn't to really index text in the sense of a search engine). The occurences of term is often saved into the database because these value is used to compute the ranking of the document after a search (the most known of tese methods are TF.IDF). So, it could be simpler to query the database. perlindex is a script available on the CPAN that index the Perl documentation available on your hard disk. One option of these script ask the total number (-d threshold for the occurence) of occurences. On my box, head is the more often word used.

The joke doesn't work as well when "perl" is at the top of the list for both books.<br><br>I don't think it's simpler to make a database. My script was only 10 lines, including blank ones<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

Dear <code>brian</code>,

<p>Sorry I went Pedantic on your joke along with saorge. The <code>perl perl perl<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...</code> graf you threatened to add to the next book <b>is</b> funny. I just got caught up in search boffin blather on about stopwords<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... a hot-button thing.

<h2>Stopwords and relevance</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/n1vux/">n1vux</a> on 2005-10-31T12:49:12</h3>
Right on. Perhaps even stronger, Perl is the first substantive word, relevant or otherwise. But <i>stopwords</i> <b>is</b> the correct searchwonk jargon for this. I susspect philologists have their own term, Larry probably would have a word that means "not a helper verb, particle, article, or pronoun". Perl is the first substantive noun, proper or common, on both lists.

<p>Be happy!
