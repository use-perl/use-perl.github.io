<p>I got Tony Bowden's email this morning. He doesn't like my <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/7463">Will Class::DBI fork?</a> post in my O'Reilly weblog. He made vague references about lawyers and courts, and I'm not sure that he didn't mean to direct that at me.<br/><br/>I've told him he needs to get his story out that and repair the damage he's doing. No one is going to make this any better with lawyers, and someone has to be the adult.<br/><br/>As it is, people at OSCON have told me that this little mess is enough to scare them away from Class::DBI no matter how great it is. Some people  consider the source of software when making their decisions.</p>

<p>All he has to do is say "Sorry folks, I overreacted.  Let's continue coding.".</p>

<p>How hard is that?</p>

<p>However, judging by what I continue to read, it seems that he <em>doesn't think he overracted</em> and he continues on with threats.</p>

<p>I have yet to use C::DBI as I find that TT or CGI::APP with plain ole DBI does what I want. But I will certainly think 3 times before using it now. Who wants to worry about that kind of stuff when all I want to do is use the module?</p>

Tony has told me in private email that he's tied up in a lot of other legal action and lawyers are telling him not to say anything.<br><br>This is the sort of thing that potential Class::DBI users are worried about. They don't want any spill-over liability.<br><br>At this point, I don't think people should use Class::DBI until Tony leaves. He's too much of a liability because of his legal problems which he won't explain.

You have no argument from me on that.

Not that it matters or that he could say...<br><br>Other legal action related, or unrelated to the CDBI flamefest?
