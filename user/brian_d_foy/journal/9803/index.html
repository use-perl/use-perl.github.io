<p>The <a href="http://www.noaa.gov">National Oceanic and Atmospheric Adminitration</a> has the 8th fastest computer in the world, according to <a href="http://top500.org/lists/2002/11/">Top500</a> (<a href="http://www.hoise.com/primeur/analysis/top500/database/top500-200211.xml">results available in XML</a>).  I do not see the <a href="http://www.nsa.gov/">NSA</a> listed as number 1 (although several rankings are simply labelled "US Government"), so take the results however you will (and ask Ziggy's about secretive US Government organizations if you really need to know the real story :).<br/><br/>I do not need all that computer power,  I just want the weather in cities that affect me.  The <a href="http://search.cpan.org/author/MSOLOMON/Geo-WeatherNOAA-4.37/WeatherNOAA.pm">Geo::WeatherNOAA</a> module does most of the work for me in my first attempt at a personal weather script.  I read lines from DATA (until I make a proper configuration file) and use that to fetch and present the data. <br/><br/>To do this, I need to know what NOAA calls the local weather station.  The area I care about right now (Chicago near Lake Michigan) shows up as <a href="http://www.ohare.com/meigs/home.shtm">"Meigs", a small airport on the shore</a>, rather than "Chicago", which stretches almost to the western and northern borders of the state, I think.  I also care about Dallas (and Salt Lake City, and Atlanta, and Cincinnati---weather there affects my life several times a month).  To see the weather for Dallas, I had to fetch the <a href="http://iwin.nws.noaa.gov/iwin/tx/hourly.html">hourly report for Texas</a> and find the name of something close to Dallas---I chose <a href="http://www.dfwairport.com/home.asp">"DFW AIRPORT"</a>.  I can do that for any state with the right state abbreviation in this URL: &lt;URL:http://iwin.nws.noaa.gov/iwin/STATE_ABBR_HERE/hourly.html>.<br/><br/>
