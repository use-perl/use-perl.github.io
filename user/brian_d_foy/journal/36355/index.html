<div class="span8">
<p>I'm spending May in Lille, France, so on May 13, I'm going to visit <a href="http://bruxelles.pm.org">Bruxelles.pm</a> just up the road. It's a quick train trip. I'll be at the Greenwich CafÃÂ© around 18:00 if anyone wants to meet earlier. I have to catch the last train back to Lille at 21:00, so don't come late!<br/><br/>I thought about visiting London.pm tonight, which is also not that far by train. Eurostar wants $800 per person for the trip, so I guess that is right out. Even booking two weeks in advance they want a lot more than I'm willing to pay to have a few drinks with one of the biggest Perl Mongers groups. So, sorry London :(.</p>

<p>Eurostar prices become a lot more reasonable if you're willing to travel either side of a weekend instead of out and back on the same day or on consecutive days.  They seem to think that if you do the latter you *must* be travelling on business, and so spending someone elses money, and so not care how much it costs.

</p><p>Of course, staying in London for the weekend would eat any money that you save on the train ticket<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-(</p>

I did see advice to buy round trip tickets for which you would only use one portion. For instance, I could have bought a round trip ticket from Lille to visit London.pm and virtually stay the weekend, but use a different round trip starting in London to go home the same night. I'd then discard the return trips on each.<br><br>Even then, the lowest prices are too high to justify visiting London even for a weekend. So, the UK can do without my money<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

Hello Brian,<br/><br/>Please check on the Bruxelles.pm mailing list if anyone will attend the meeting on tuesday. I am in Barcelona till wednesday, so I will not be there. Gilles won't be there also.
Sorry, I just don't want you to make unnecessary train trips...<br/><br/>If it is ok for you, we might plan a special meeting for welcoming you on another day in may...<br/><br/>Regards,
Erik

I'm going to Brussels that day to visit, so if there is no meeting I just won't be at a meeting. I won't be available on another day. It's not a big deal if there won't be a meeting.<br><br>I could check the Bruxelles mailing list archive if it were open to non-subscriber<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
