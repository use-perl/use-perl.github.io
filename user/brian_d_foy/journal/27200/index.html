<p>I'll be in Boston (well, Milford) this week. Anything going on with the <a href="http://boston.pm.org">Boston Perl Mongers</a>? According to their page it looks like I'm going to miss all of the scheduled meetings.</p>

I noticed that my company is running the stonehenge course this week and wondered who was teaching it.  I'm in Boston (Hopkinton, not Milford) too this week for a company internal conference.  I'll try to drop by and say hi to you.

They've been working on the proposal for a while - I've chimed in occassionally with some perspective thoughts (I was on the committee for the past YAPC in Torontoand I travel to Boston a few times per year).  The Boston PM has a large group of people working on the proposal and they've done a good job.  (Of course if they win, their work has just started, heh, heh.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

But I'm exhausted after writing that proposal!  I thought the gnomes were supposed to come out at night and finish the conference for us.<br><br>I guess they just do shoes.<br>

<h2>Boston embarrassment of riches</h2>

No, <a href="http://boston.pm.org/" title="pm.org">Boston.pm</a pm.org> has nothing scheduled this week. You'd mentioned you'd be in Boston later in the fall, but if a week was mentioned, it didn't register.  If you want to arrange something, we should discuss it with Ron. I will send you &amp; Ron email.
<p>In a different room at the same MIT building that Boston.PM is using now, the <b>Boston Linux Unix aka <a href="http://www.blu.org/" title="blu.org">BLU</a blu.org> </b> will be hosting <b>Mako on Ubuntu 5.10</b> release.
</p><p>And there is a rumor of a <b>Damian</b> in Boston later in the month<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...</p>
