<h1>The O'Reilly Network Weblogs are more tricky than I thought</h1>

<div class="span8">
<p>My <a href="http://weblogs.oreilly.com/">O'Reilly Network</a> weblog reader is complete crap, I discovered, because, now that I am using it, I realize that the number assigned to the weblog is only accidently related to its release date.<br/><br/>To write a weblog,  I create an entry, and the O'Reilly Network system records this entry as a "draft".  I can work on it all that I like and nobody will see it until I mark it as "final", when it then shows up on the public website.<br/><br/>So, if I want to read all of January 15's new (public) entries, I have to download those marked { 4189, 4194, 4195, 4196, 4198 }.  Looking back at January 14's entries, I find { 4151, 4102, 4184, 4185, 4187, 4188 }.  Not only are they not in consecutive (my program can deal with gaps), but they are not in order either (which craps up the whole thing). <br/><br/>However, I do not consider this some sort of flaw---I like the way they have made things. It is just more of a challenge to read offline.<br/><br/>I could grab <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/meerkat/?_fl=rss10&t=ALL&c=5209">the RSS feed</a>, but that only lists the articles they show on the main page.  If I cannot read the weblogs for a week, I am going to miss some. I can choose <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/weblogs/date/2004/01/">a monthly archive</a>, but that has no RSS feed.  I do not really need an RSS feed because I can just use HTML::SimpleLinkExtor and a regular expression to pull out the URLs that I want.<br/><br/>No matter what I do, I now need to keep track of everything that I have read, not just the last thing that I read, and if I am going to do that, I might as well go back to the first entries, in 2000, where it was just Tim O'Reilly remarking on whatever cool thing he saw that week.<br/><br/> </p>
