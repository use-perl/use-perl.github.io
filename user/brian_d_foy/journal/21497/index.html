<p>I've had another <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ause.perl.org+dumbass&start=0&start=0&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official">dumbass episode</a>, and even doubly so today because Ziggy told me to stop working (and get some sleep) or I was going to make a dumbass mistake.  And so it came to pass.<br/><br/>I've been working on my laptop, which is fine and dandy.  Everything was working really nice and I was ready to deploy the script.  I had tested it and everything.<br/><br/>Once I deployed, minor bits and pieces stopped working.  <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Template">Template</a> was acting oddly, and Business::OnlinePayment::AuthorizeNet was silently failing.  Everything worked on my side.  I didn't get errors on the remote side: I just got odd behviour.<br/><br/>Three hours later (well, I was watching "The Office" special at the same time).<br/><br/>What I hadn't done, however, was check the version numbers on the modules on the remote machines.  I took it for granted that they were up-to-date because they usually are up-to-date.<br/><br/>It turns out the remote side as an old version (2.09, 1.5 years old) of Template, so it doesn't understand "IN", and the old version (3.12, two years old) of Business::OnlinePayment::AuthorizeNet doesn't understand transaction keys.  Luckily, the Changes files (<a href="http://search.cpan.org/src/ABW/Template-Toolkit-2.14/Changes">T</a>, <a href="http://search.cpan.org/src/IVAN/Business-OnlinePayment-AuthorizeNet-3.14/Changes">B::O::A</A>) for these modules note when the features were added, and my problems have notes between the latest versions and the ones I actually have on the remote machines.<br/><br/>Of course, I installed that latest versions in my private directory and sent a nice note asking for modern versions of the modules, but I'm still a dumbass.<br/><br/>Now if I can just figure out why gpg insists on using temporary files.</p>
