<p>I've been kicking around Walt Disney World this week (I'll take a chilly 58 F Florida over a freezing 10 F Chicago), and I now have it in my head that TPR needs a panel cartoon.  Anyone a cartonist?  <br/><br/>I might have an illustrator for the cartoon, but she knows nothing about Perl, the Perl community, geeks, and whatnot, so I'm also looking for cartoon story ideas.</p>

<h2>Try Perlmonks...</h2>

... the solution to all problems!<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)
<p>There's some talent hanging around there. Take <a href="http://perlmonks.org/?node=teabag" title="perlmonks.org">teabag</a perlmonks.org>, for example, he surely can draw. He drew the picture on his home node. He plays in a rockband, for which he made the <a href="http://hotel.xs4all.nl/mier/bluezooka/" title="xs4all.nl">online cartoon</a xs4all.nl> too.
</p><p>There's a <a href="http://www.cafepress.com/perlmonks.4100611" title="cafepress.com">Perl   theme baseball shirt</a cafepress.com> for sale, of which I like the cartoon on the front very much. The names on the side of the cartoon are <a href="http://perlmonks.org/?node=briac" title="perlmonks.org">briac</a perlmonks.org> and <a href="http://perlmonks.org/?node=larsen" title="perlmonks.org">larsen</a perlmonks.org>, two Perlmonks user names &mdash; unsurprisingly, when you look at what online store the shirt is sold at.
</p><p>And allegedly <a href="http://perlmonks.org/?node=ybiC" title="perlmonks.org">ybiC</a perlmonks.org> is talented cartoonist, too &mdash; though you wouldn't really tell from his current home node picture. He definitely has a prominent, almost childlike, sense of humor. And I mean that in a good way.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

Wow, thanks for thinking of me, brer [bart].
<p>
I have a reasonable feel for Perl, the Perl community, geeks, and maybe even for some whatnot you might have laying about. &nbsp; But I've nary a creative synapse in me wee 'ead these days, and havn't done any drawring to speak of for a good 25 years.
</p>
But if good sir brian_d_foy finds himself desperate, I'd be happy to storyboard any bored stories someone might throw at me.

I'd be honoured to make you a nice cartoon. And just for the record, I've got some cafepress items too: <a href="http://www.cafepress.com/teabag" title="cafepress.com">http://www.cafepress.com/teabag</a cafepress.com>
<br>I seem to have lost the login though<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)<p>kind regards,<br>
