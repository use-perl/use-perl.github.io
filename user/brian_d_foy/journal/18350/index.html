<p>I made it back to Chicago, and I have dumped all of by bags onto the floor of my home office.  Now I need to sort through those piles, along with the mail that has built up, and all sorts of other things.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, my rich and successful wife starts another out-of-town gig on Sunday, and it lasts for a month, so I will be following her to Detroit, with nothing to do other than whatever I want (and I am still on military leave, so I am getting paid to do it).<br/><br/>So, gentle readers, what is there to do in Detroit, other than see the new polar bear couple at the Zoo?  Is Detroit.pm still around?  Alas, I will not have a car, I think, but we are staying in some snazzy hotel near <a href="http://www.motopera.org/default.htm">the opera house</a>.</p>

Detroit isn't the most exciting town.  The Henry Ford museum is pretty cool,  and if you like to eat Greektown is a good place to visit.  Other than that, I can't think of much.  Detroit is not a good town to be car-less in, what public transportation there is isn't that great, and much of the things to do are actually in the suburbs. (The zoo is all the way up by I-696 for example).

Oh no.  It's not so bad to need a car, but now I need a driver's license too.  Mine expired while I was overseas, and although I am renewing it, the gubment is in no rush.

Oh that's nice of them, especially considering that you were only overseas because you were slaving for The Man<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

Oddly enough, searching for "dia" in Google brings up the Detroit Institute for the Arts before the drawing program of the same name.<br> <br>I will have to see the Tigers and the Henry Ford museum too.

surely that should be dia.org.us !!
<p>
The united states has a TLD, surely sites that are specific to 1 place in the U.S. should use it.
</p><p>
Thats almost as bad as a UK insurance company using<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.org (not<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.co.uk or even<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.com)
</p><p>
whats the point in having TLD's if people don't use the appropriate one, why making them meaniningful? we might as well just<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.1 or<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.foo or<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.whatever.I.Like at the end of an url.

gah!</p>
