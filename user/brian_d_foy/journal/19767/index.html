<p>I spent the day talking to printers, and I think I know who is going to print the first issue of <i>The Perl Review</i>.  Most shops quoted the same price,  but it came down to this question:<br/><br/><blockquote>
<b>Me:</b> So what happens if I blow it and give you the file late?<br/><br/><b>Them:</b> We have to do it faster.<br/><br/><b>Me:</b> How much extra does that cost?<br/><br/><b>Them:</b> Um... [pause] ... nothing. We just do it faster.
</blockquote><br/><br/>Well, okay then. :) </p>

<h2>Europe</h2>

brian, how are you thinking to handle Europe? Mailing from US?

Right now I have to mail from the US, but that it not all of that bad.  I have been considering mailing a stack of issues to someone in the EU who can act as a distribution point, though.  That might be faster.<br> <br>Someday I might be able to print in the EU, but then I have to find a printer here and there that can do the same size of paper.<br> <br>I have a few subscriptions from Asia too, but not enough to do anything other than just mail them from the US.

So, you are preparing to print on Letter?

Right now the folio size is US Letter.  I don't really care too much about that, but it's easy for the printer and me.  Right now easier is better.<br> <br>I wouldn't mind an A4 size, but then I need to reconfigure all sorts of things on my side.<br> <br>During the first year I should be able to work out all of these things.
