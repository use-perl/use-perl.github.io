<p>A couple days ago I got some spam promoting some new advertising scheme. It's another one of those javascript based things. I selected the option to display the ads that payed the most per click. That doesn't mean much because they only had two ads from which I could select.<br/><br/>I put it at the bottom of <a href="http://www.theperlreview.com">The Perl Review</a> page to play with it (although it will disappear in the next update since its not in source control). No big whoop. I clicked an ad, it was a broken link, but the site said I just earned $0.50.  <br/><br/>I forgot about it (and forgot to remove it, making me one of those nasty people who surround three sentences of content with 9,000 ads) until I looked at the site again today. Curious if it had done anything, I checked the ad server site again. Apparently someone's been clicking on it.<br/><br/>Maybe I'll leave it there for a few more days, since a click on that ad gets me the same amount in the bank (after expenses) as selling a single issue. If 16,000 people clicked on the ad, I'd have all the money I need for printing the magazine for the next year (like that would ever happen). It's amazing what people will throw money at, though.</p>

<p>I suspect won't last. Right now, the ads blend in and look like content (though bizarrely unrelated content).  However, I suspect you have a few repeat visitors.  After they've clicked through a few times, they'll stop.  I you have plenty of new visitors, perhaps they'll work after all.</p>

<p>My <a href="http://users.easystreet.com/ovid/cgi_course/" title="easystreet.com">CGI Course</a easystreet.com> also has ads, but I get plenty of new folks checking it out, so it's a constant (albeit tiny) revenue stream.</p>

Yeah, the money isn't going to last, and I don't think the ad company will either. They have only a couple of clients, and there are hundreds of people trying to do the same thing.<br><br>Indeed, as I write this, I notice the $0.50 ads are gone and it's all nickel stuff, mostly for the ad company itself.
