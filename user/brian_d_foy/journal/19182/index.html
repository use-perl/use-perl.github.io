<p>Yeah, but the results aren't as good.</p>

I agree.  I was merely commenting on the fact that Brian thought the search on use.perl was hard to find.

Wow, you mean you don't use "light" mode?  I can't stand the default slash look, turning on light mode makes both use.perl and slashdot much more readable.  Have a look in your prefs...

It's not necessarily at the top right.  In the light version it is at the very bottom.

We found Google search results so much improved over our search engine so we just went with Google as our search engine.

Hm, that's a pretty good endorsement: "search results good enough to satisfy the US census bureau".

We never endorse anything.  We're just satisfied users.

Perl is quite capable of knocking the socks off googles generic crawler based indexing.
<p>
Its not hard to write a basic search engine that delivers a lot more punch with a little knowledge of your application.
</p><p>
Both use.perl and search.cpan as well as perl.com all suffer from fairly pedestrian search engines, comparable with the lame efforts of the average<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.asp site.

It's mostly because of two things: limitations in MySQL's search abilities, and limitations in our time.  It's on our wishlist, now that we can take advantage of MySQL 4.x.

Kind of Mysql's fulltext is limited, it isn't aware of your application and doesn't allow you to index accross objects or tables.
<p>
It doesn't take that long to write your own and have much better results. I would love to work on the searching for search.cpan.org.
</p><p>
If I had any idea how the data was stored and some sample data I would be happy to have a go.
