<p>I have wanted a wireless module for my Handspring, but I always thought those things were really expensive.  <br/><br/>I have been setting up a Mac network at home so we can share printers and a big drive full of MP3s, so I fantasized about a common Handspring sync point too.  The network cradles are pretty expensive---$300.  That is more than I paid for two Handsprings combined.<br/><br/>I really wanted <a href="http://intel.com/network/connectivity/products/xirswe1130.htm">the  Xircom Springport wireless module</a> ever since I saw Rael Dornfest using it at one of the P2P conferences.  Most of the online retailers were selling them for $299.  That is still too much, even if they are cool toys.<br/><br/>Today I stumbled across the <a href="http://www.handspring.com/">Handspring web site</a> again, so I did a little window shopping.  They listed the Xircom wireless module for $99, <a href="http://www.shop-intel.com/shop/product.asp?pfid=44&pid=SINT1037&mscssid=A8T4SHKXUSWN9J0WPJ1C3S9PA4GG3P7C">available directly from Intel</a>.  Amazon lists it at $209 after a $93 markdown, and the lowest used price is $93.  A few other retailers had it for $299.  The price direct from Intel is about the same I pay for a dinky Airport card.<br/><br/>Since $99 is a good price point for what I will get out of this, I bought it.  I expected the confirmation screen or email to show a real price to confirm my suspicious that the first web page must have been a misprint, but they all agree that I spent $112 after tax and shipping.  Now I only have to get by a possible apologetic email explaining the error and asking to charge me $200 more dollars.<br/><br/>If this actually arrives, I solve one of my biggest problems---getting out of the front door without a phone number because I forgot to sync my handheld.<br/><br/>And, although I am not a war-walker, I might give it a try.</p>
