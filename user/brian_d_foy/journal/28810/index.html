<p>Jeff Bisbee invited me to join <a href="http://www.multiply.com">Multiply.com</a>, which looks like a hybrid <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/47329375@N00/">Flickr</a>/<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/profile?viewProfile=&key=2321971">LinkedIn</a> sorta thing. This one is built by members of the South Florida Perl Mongers though. Everyone talks about hardware convergence, but what I really want are less accounts. Fortunately, Firefox remembers all of my usernames and passwords for me.</p>

<h2>OpenID</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/sky/">sky</a> on 2006-02-28T14:26:51</h3>
You want OpenID (openid.net)..<br/><br/>I added support to it for RT at <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/abergman/RT-Authen-OpenID-0.01/" title="cpan.org">http://search.cpan.org/user/abergman/RT-Authen-OpenID-0.01/</a cpan.org><br/><br/>With an implementation using it at rt.livejournal.org

I don't really want that. Only two sites I use have it, and I know my passwords for those.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)  OpenID is just another ID I have to remember.

You want everything to support OpenID, and then the problem would go away.<br/><br/>Seriously, any new web app out there support openid.

I don't really want everything to use OpenID, just like I don't want everything to use my social security number, ATM PIN, or many of the other things.<br><br>It's not really that I'm unaware of these things. You just took an offhand comment said in jest a bit too seriously.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

Jeff also invited me to join, but I haven't for the same reason. Yet Another Account. Same reason I don't do Flickr or MySpace when people invite me. How many accounts do I need to view photos from 'friends'?<br><br>What happened to the good old days when people just put up pictures on their website, and you didn't have to do anything but bookmark a URL? All my photos and my journal are online for anyone to see. No need to sign up for an account somewhere, remember you login info, get SPAM from those sites, opt-out of newsletters, change configurations, etc...<br><br>Free your photos people!!

You should really give it a try... I know the guy who runs it and he's pretty cool<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)<br><br>Multiply, as opposed to a lot of other services, is focused on more powerful communication with people you already know.... not fakesters that you might find elsewhere.<br><br>P.S. you don't need to register to view public content, only to post or read protected content.<br>
