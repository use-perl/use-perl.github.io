<p>Usually I have to come up with a book to add to The Perl Review's book section. This month I have 4 books that could be headline reviews. Ugh.<br/><br/>Somewhere in that, I didn't assign "Higher Order Perl" to anyone. Is there anyone who already has the book (and read it ;) who would like to write 300 words about it for TPR? I usually arrange to get the book to the reviewer for free, but in this case you already have it. I'll make it worth your while in another way.<br/><br/>I have a <a href="http://www.theperlreview.com/Authors/book_review_howto.html">Book review how-to</a>.</p>

<h2>Sample review?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Ovid/">Ovid</a> on 2005-05-01T15:28:54</h3>
<p>I have the book and I'd be willing to review it.  What's the due date?  Also, do you have a sample review that you consider good style?  I read the howto, but sometimes seeing a living, breathing example can be golden.</p>

<p>Not a problem, but I'm assuming you mean May 9.  Still, I've started on it now and I don't think it will take too much time.  I'm fresh from the book.</p>

<p>I tried replying to your last email, but it bounced twice.  Am I get filtered as spam or something?</p> <blockquote> <div> <tt>This is the qmail-send program at yahoo.com.<br>I'm afraid I wasn't able to deliver your message to the following addresses.<br>This is a permanent error; I've given up.

<p>I dunno, I kinda like your description.</p>

<blockquote> <div>Ovid is a grant manager for Perl Foundation, has a couple of patches in the Perl core and a few CPAN modules.  His work is Perl.  His hobby is well, Perl.  He lives in Portland, OR.</div> </blockquote>

<p>Feel free to trim as needed.</p>

That's odd. This anti-spam stuff is starting to get out of hand.<br> <br>Thanks,

Looks like this is recent and somewhat dubious.<br> <br> <a href="http://rfc-ignorant.org/tools/lookup.php?domain=yahoo.com" title="rfc-ignorant.org">http://rfc-ignorant.org/tools/lookup.php?domain=yahoo.com</a rfc-ignorant.org> <br> <br>Panix should be smart enough not to rely on any one single blacklist for spam catching.<br>
