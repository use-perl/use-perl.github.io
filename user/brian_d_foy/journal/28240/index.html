<p>Let's ensure the Perl books on Amazon have their tags!<br/><br/>Marsee Henon from the O'Reilly Media writes in the <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/oreilly/ug/newsletters/12162005.html">Dec 16, 2005 User Group Newsletter</a>:<br/><br/><blockquote>
Looking for Amazon Users to Tag Our Books on Amazon Amazon recently released a new feature that lets you put "tags"--one or a few word descriptions--on their products. We think it's a cool way for users to help others find the right books, so we're looking for people with Amazon accounts to help us tag our books. <br/><br/>Here's how it works: You can mark books with as many tags as you want. We're hoping to tag all our books with "oreilly" and to tag books from series such as "missing manual," "hacks," "annoyances," and "nutshell." [Tags are case-sensitive, and most people seem to be creating them in lower case--no shift key to press]. You can also tag subject areas such as "perl," "photography," and "excel." And you can include author names and user level, like "beginner" and "intermediate." For example, the book "Mac OS X The Missing Manual, Tiger Edition" is already tagged with: "oreilly," "missing manual," "pogue," "mac os x," "mac," and "beginner." If someone's already added a tag, you can cast your vote by using that same tag again--the page shows how many times a tag's been used for that book. Let [Marsee] know if have any questions or need some help.

That sounds like a scriptable task. Not that I'm volunteering - both O'Reilly and Amazon are commercial companies. Let them put their own resources to work.
