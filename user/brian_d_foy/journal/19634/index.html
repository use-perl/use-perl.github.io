<div class="span8">
<p>This week I have been looking for a printer for <a href="http://www.theperlreview.com"><i>The Perl Review</i></a>, which I need to get on paper by next week so I can pass out some at OSCON.  <br/><br/>The good news is that printing is a lot cheaper than I thought it would be, and I have plenty of money right now to print 1,000 copies of two issues.  That number seems to be the magic one.  Printing 500 costs almost the same amount.<br/><br/>Now I need to actaully layout the next issue so I can give it to the printer in time to have it for OSCON.  That's a really quick time-table considering that the longest part is editing the articles.  I have two articles 95% done, and several others 50% done.  It will be a race amongst the authors to see who makes it into the issue.<br/><br/>Right now I'm planning for 32 pages, and since this is now dead trees instead of PDF (which will still be available), the printer gets to decide a lot of things.  That 32 pages should be all Perl content minus a few pages for the covers.<br/><br/>I will provide more details when I have them, and I will be contacting all of the subscribers within the next week to verify shipping addresses. </p>

Current subscribers get a copy whether or not they are at OSCON?

Yes, subscribers will get a copy in the mail, although I will probably have to mail them after OSCON.  I am barely going to be able to get them soon enough for that, so I may have to wait until I get back to mail them.<br> <br>This is unusual only because of the time I got off active duty, just got back from my wedding and honeymoon, and OSCON is right around the corner.  I intend to give subscribers the priority on getting the issues.  Future timetables should be much more sane.
