<p>Bad things that have happened on this holiday:<br/><br/><ul>
<li>Left house keys at the last place we stayed.
<li>Pulled over by cops when we almost turned the wrong way onto a one-way street.  Since we were not drunk, they let us go.
<li>Pulled over by cops for making an illegal U-turn.  Since we were not drunk they let us go. 
<li>Locked keys in car.
<li>Waiting for tow truck to take car with brand new but defective clutch to nearest dealer---over an hour away.
<li>Very bad muscle strain in shoulder from recurring sports injury.
<li>Florida National Guard mobilizes.  The list of available units is getting short.  
<li>Bailed on Lord of the Rings after seeing a very long line to get in.  We bought tickets earlier, but were not expecting people to camp out to see it.  There is not much else to do here though.
<li>I lost every game of hearts tonight.
<li>My partner's computer needed an OS re-install (although her brother is an Apple dude with a couple of iPods just for that reason).
<li>I cannot get GD to install correctly.
</ul><br/><br/>Still, no one was shooting at me, no one was bleeding, and I was not wet, cold, tired, hungry, or sleeping in mud.  Any day I can walk away from is a good day.</p>
