<div class="span8">
<p>Andy Lester gave me quite a beating over Test::Data and Test::Prereq, so I have uploaded new versions of those.  He squaked about Tie::Cycle and Tie::Toggle last week, and I have new distributions for those.<br/><br/><a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?q=http::cookies::mozilla&hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&selm=5230027.X5PjGp7UDu%40nyoga.dubu.de&rnum=3">Someone asked about reading the Mozilla cookies file, and someone else recommended</a> my <a href="http://search.cpan.org/author/BDFOY/HTTP-Cookies-Mozilla-1.03/">HTTP::Cookies::Mozilla</a> module.  HTTP::Cookies::Mozilla and HTTP::Cookies::Omniweb should show up in the module list shortly.  Recommendations for my modules that do not come from me are always pleasing.<br/><br/>I am trying to figure out the iCab cookies file format (it is binary), so I can finish HTTP::Cookies::iCab.  Somewhere down the road I have plans for modules for Opera and Internet Explorer.<br/><br/>I am thinking about HTTP::Cookies::Magic which would automatically detect the cookie file format and choose the right subclass as well as rebless objects into other subclasses for easy conversions.<br/><br/>Chad Walker has been sending me fixes to Mac::PropertyList.  He gave me a couple of ideas that solved my brainlock about nested container tags in the XML format.  He also completely rewrote the module to use XML::Parser, which might be useful if people can interact with the plist as the parser encounters tokens.<br/><br/>I have an idea to let Test::Manifest have different levels of testing.  Right now I can specify the order of test files in the test_manifest file, but if I add a second parameter to each line, each test can decide when it wants to run.  During `make test`, the base set runs, and higher levels require some sort of environment variable.  <br/><br/>Chris released Mac::Carbon 0.03, so Mac::iTunes should use that soon.  I am also thinking about separating the Mac::iTunes distribution in three smaller distributions.  I can work on that as I travel for the next couple of weeks.<br/><br/>Pod::LaTeX::TPR has been saving me a lot of work.   I want to develop a better pseudo-Pod format for <i><a href="http://www.theperlreview.com">The Perl Review</a></i>.  <br/><br/>I am sorely tempted to write GDGraph::Economist to make graphs that look like those in <i>The Economist</i>.  I muck around in GDGraph about once a year and send changes to Martien, and it is that time of the year, I think. <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/brian_d_foy/journal/8314">I like graphs</a>.<br/><br/>Sean Burke released a lot of new Pod stuff recently, so Test::Pod is even more sensitive---I have been fixing a lot of documentation formatting errors for my modules.  Annoying to deal with, but I like quality.  <br/><br/><a href="http://perl-rss.sourceforge.net>XML::RSS</a> is moving along, and is only limited by my meager understanding of RSS.  I want to make sure the next release really fixes the outstanding issues, which means I need to write tests, which means I need to know what to test, which means...  The project has 5 members who have been extremely helpful---people seem to like this module and want to see it live.<br/><br/>Business::ISBN now has a separate distribution for Business::ISBN::Data which holds the country and publisher codes.  Lately some ISBN agencies have issued new publisher codes, and I do not want to release a new vesion of Business::ISBN just for that.<br/><br/>My <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/brian_d_foy/journal/9418">release</a> script makes maintenance pretty easy.  The only parts that slow me down are rewriting tests for Test::More when I go back to the older modules.  Once I have the tests in place, fixes are easy, and uploading to the right places is literally two keystrokes.  CPAN Testers tell me I messud up and the cycle repeats, or Andy gets on iChat and prods me with a pointy stick.</p>
