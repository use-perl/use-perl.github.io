<p>My laptop has been a bit wierd lately---I think the desert might be slowly horking it (need to find compress air to blow out the dust).  A couple of times it seizes, and I think some files get messed up when I restart it.<br/><br/>For instance, all of a sudden I could not add applications to the Applications folder, and I cannot change the printer list.  I am a admin user, so I should be able to do that.  After I checked my account settings, re-logged-in, and tried a few other things.  The Mac Help just kept saying "See your system administrator."  Well hell, Apple, that's me.<br/><br/>Google pointed me towards a "Repair Permissions" utility for 10.1.5, and then I remembered a little button I had seen in Disk Utility---"Repair Permissions".  This must be a common problem.  I give that a whirl and several problems immediately disappear.<br/><br/><pre>

</pre><br/><br/>This reminds me of a program I wrote a long time ago when I had to wrangle a group of web designers. We were a small company so a lot of people had access to most of the servers (although I changed that by getting a good sysadmin).  When a lot of non-techie types have access, they hork things in various ways.  I wrote a little database app to store a list of files and their correct permissions, then had a cron job check every 15 minutes or so.  When things have to be a certain way, I always like to check that they are, even though they should not change.  I wish MacOS X did that.</p>

<h2>mtree</h2>

Aaron suggested:<br> <br>* mtree<br> <br>"The utility mtree compares the file hierarchy rooted in the current directory against a specification read from the standard input.<br> <br>Messages are written to the standard output for any files whose characteristics do not match the specification, or which are missing from either the file hierarchy or the specification."<br> <br>http://www.osxfaq.com/man/8/mtree.ws<br> <br>Haven't tried it myself yet.
