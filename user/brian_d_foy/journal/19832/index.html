<p><i>The Perl Review</i> really looks like it is going to happen.  I'm supposed to give everything to the printer on Friday morning.  If I don't sleep between now and then, I think I can make it.<br/><br/>I have a problem though: I've been so out of the community for the past year and a half that I could use some help filling up two pages of Perl news.  I don't have the time to discover it on my own (if I want to get everything else done too). I mean, here I am in Buffalo only to find out YAPC was <i>last</i> month.  D'oh!<br/><br/>Pretty please, with sugar on top, speak up if you have a conference coming up, just wrote a book, did something cool, or know anyone who has.  What are the new projects of the summer?  Give me the scoop on what's happening in the now and in the next three months of the Perl community.<br/><br/>Failing that, anyone want to have a listing in the Perl Personals? :)</p>

From the top of my head, I can think of three books that are coming out<br>(supposedly) in the next three months (not necessarily one per month).<br> <br>Being Portuguese (1), I don't know if the authors would want me talking about<br>them... but two of the authors are Randal Schwartz and Mark Dominus O:-)<br> <br>(1) - I've been told by someone this is a typical Portuguese characteristic,<br>not mentioning anything that should be mentioned by others in order not risk<br>saying something that somebody wouldn't want to be said...<br> <br>I'm not saying who told me that, though O:-)<br>
