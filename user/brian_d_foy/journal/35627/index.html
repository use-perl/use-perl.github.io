<p>Last week I finished updating <i>Learning Perl</i> for Perl 5.10, and it's time for it's technical review before I turn in the book to the publisher at the end of the month. Anyone with 5.10 experience interested? Email me and I work out the details with you.<br/><br/>I'll have more to say about the newest edition later, but it's not a minor update. There's a completely new chapter on smart matching, and lots of additions to the regex stuff. Perl 5.10 adds some nice features for newbies.<br/><br/>Here are some of the things that we've added:<br/><br/><ul>
<li>say
<li>Named captures in regexes
<li>Relative back references in regexes
<li>state variables
<li>stacked file test operators
<li>defined-or
<li>smart matching
<li>given-when and for-when
</ul><br/><br/>I expect the book might just squeak in by YAPC::NA, but it should definitely be at OSCON.</p>

I was just wondering this morning if the series would be getting a refresher. It is only the Llama or the others as well (eventually)?

Next month I'll look at the Alpaca to see what would change. I don't think there are many things that would change there except for converting any Makemaker stuff to Module::Build (but that's about a third of the book).<br><br>I think Vicunas is pretty safe for now, although I've been slowly taking notes for a possible second edition. We'll have to see if continued sales justify that though.<br><br>Everything else is waiting for its Perl 6 version, I think.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
