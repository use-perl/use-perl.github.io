<p>Randal, Tom, and I are gearing up for the second edition of the Alpaca, which we are going to re-title "Intermediate Perl". Just like we did with the Llama Fourth Edition (now finishing QC1 and on track to be at OSCON), we're looking for tech reviewers and masochists you want to tell us where we made mistakes, what we left out, and so on. You can write to me directly (comdog@panix.com), leave a note here, or show up at a special geo-cache Randal set up in the Brazilian rainforest (write to me for the coordinates).<br/><br/>In the last tech edit, I included a lot of Perl newbies so I could get beginners comments on Learning Perl. This time I'm looking for people who pretty much already know the stuff in the Alpaca and also know what's happened in the three years since it was first published.<br/><br/>Typically these things are a volunteer edit, but if you catch up with one of us at a conference we'll buy you drinks, etc.<br/><br/>Need need to waste your time writing, dha, since I've already volunteered you. :)</p>

I'm interested in reviewing the book.



<h2>Intermediate Perl</h2>

<p>
I'm quite amazed at the independent evolution of different Perl training houses to similar course names and content.  Our course has been called <a href="http://perltraining.com.au/perlinter.html" title="perltraining.com.au">Intermediate Perl</a perltraining.com.au> for years.  However while it covers packages, references and modules, we've split the object oriented material out into a <a href="http://perltraining.com.au/perloo.html" title="perltraining.com.au">separate course</a perltraining.com.au>.  The only trouble with that is convincing businesses that a knowledge of OO Perl is worthwhile.
</p> <p>
We do have a noticable absence of alpacas on our course covers, I suspect mainly because <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/Erudil/" title="perl.org">Erudil</a perl.org> hasn't written any alpaca programs of which I am aware.

in case you think I can be a good reviewer (as you had some experience before with my comments).

I think I've read and coded enough to be helpful.
