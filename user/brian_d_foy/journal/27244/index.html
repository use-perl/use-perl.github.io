<p><a href="http://boston.pm.org/kwiki/">On Thursday I'll be getting together with Boston.pm for some bbq</a>. I have one or more Llama books to give away, although if you want to buy your own and bring that I'm not going to stop you.</p>

<h2>What??!</h2>

<p>Barbecue?  In Boston??  Oh my...</p>

<p>Back away slowly from the smoker with your hands where I can see them!</p>

<p>This is culinary sacrilege of the worst kind, even more extreme than that damned "Semi-Homemade Cooking" show.  Stick with the brown bread and beans, you'll be okay.</p>

<p>Unless they had the REAL stuff shipped in.  It comes from the part of the country defined by Kansas City (or parts southwest) and Memphis (or parts southwest).  Anything else is fake.</p>

<p>No offense to those on the seaboard, but life's pace there is usually too frantic to produce good barbecue.  My dad's family is from "Glohsta", so I'm speaking from first-hand experience.</p>

<p>Oh, and that stuff you get in the Carolinas?  The first time I got that, I almost threw up.  Meat soaked in vinegar?  Please!</p>

<p>Please let us know how it turns out.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p><p><p>John</p>

I've been living in the north for so long (almost all my life) that I've pretty much given up looking for good bbq. It's sorta like getting bagels outside of New York City, cheesesteaks outside of Philly, or "chowda" outside New England. You have an urge, so as Secretary Rumsfeld might say "You eat the bbq you can get, not the bbq you want".<br><br>The Carolinas do it right, by the way. You must be doing it wrong.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br><br>But in my defense, I didn't select the restaurant.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

<p>Ooooh, you reeeally know how to hurt a guy!</p>

<p>If you ever venture into southwest Missouri (and watch out if you do, what with that accent you must surely have, you damned yankee!), I will change your opinion about the swill they serve as barbecue in the Carolinas.  The gauntlet has been thrown down!</p>

I didn't select it either... giving up spicy food is almost a career ending disability in this field!

<p>Whatever Uri may think about Red Bones and Blue Ribbon's "authenticity"<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... and whatever the purists may think about a joint trying to serve 12 distinct styles of BBQ for mix-n-match/u-pick-em<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... Yes, if you want *authentic* Carolina style barbecue in Boston, you can <b>get</b> it, if someone tips you were to look.

</p><p>All you have to do is cross the tracks over to my neighborhood, where some guys operate out of trucks in vacant lots and make it they way granpappy taught 'em.  (Their relatives bring up south-of-the-border fireworks for 'em in the summertime too.)  But you might want to bring your flak vest<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... the gangstahs eat there too.

</p><p>whether it's coastal or piedmont carolina style, I can't tell you<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...</p>
