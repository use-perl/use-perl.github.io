<p>I have to take a break from my life to do some stuff with the military, and I will not have access to fancy technology like running water and computers.  I am not going to say anymore on what I will be doing, how soon it starts, or when I will be back.  I don't know any of that anyway.<br/><br/>I am looking for anyone who wants to take over any part of anything I am doing in the community so it still gets done:<br/><br/><ul>
<li>Andy Lester or Randal can make any decisions regarding <a href="http://search.cpan.org/author/BDFOY/">my modules or code</a> if I am not around. Everything is in CVS in a SourceForge project, most things have decent test suites, and some people even use a couple of them.  I will continue to handle maintenance as long as I can, but I will not be doing any new development because I don't want to leave more of a mess than it might already be. 
Please feel free to request control of any module you would like to take over or maintain. (This could be a good opportunity for some up and coming Perl gurus :)
<li>Someone needs to take over the FAQ autoposter to comp.lang.perl.misc, and updates to the faq.  I can explain how it works (and it is all in <a href="http://cvs.perl.org/cgi/cvsweb.cgi/perlfaq/">the perlfaq CVS</A>).  This only takes up about two hours a week and has been a great way to learn things I would not have otherwise run into, and I do not even have to deal with p5p :)
<li>I'm working on what happens with <i>The Perl Review</i>.  Feel free to express any concerns, complaints, and so on to me directly (comdog@panix.com).  All of the TPR is in <a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/brian-d-foy/YAPJ/">my SourceForge CVS</a> too.
<li>The XML::RSS folks are pretty much squared away, but if you are interested in working on that project, check out the <a href="http://perl-rss.sourceforge.net">the project website</a>.
<li>Everything else already has a bunch of volunteers, so they won't miss me all that much. :)
</ul></p>
