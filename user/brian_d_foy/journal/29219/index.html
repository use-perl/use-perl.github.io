It's kinda annoying that he had to cut and paste my entire post into his.<br/><br/>That's the life of a content creator though. Everything thinks they are entitled to the money to be made from your creation, and want to suck as much of it away from you as possible. From reading his other posts, he's mad that anyone buys anything anywhere but his store, apparently.</p>

His point seems to be that somehow by selling you one product, and hence making a profit, that the original seller should be renumerated for further sales of that product to the same customer, regardless of where it was purchased.
<br> <br>
I wonder what would happen if they tried to apply the same methodology to say, confectionary. Would one retailer then have to pay a royalty on a mars bar to the retailer who initially sold the customer that specific product?
<br> <br>
Perhaps there is a local context I don't understand but it seems a little like madness
to me.
