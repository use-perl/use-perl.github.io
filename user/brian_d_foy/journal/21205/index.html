<p>Before I took my long vacation, I updated the perlfaq frequently.  I haven't really looked at it since then.<br/><br/>Today I finally decided at add the new answer "How do I tell the difference between errors from the shell and perl?" which has waiting on my desktop for a while.  <br/><br/>So I did.<br/><br/>While I was at it, I created a t/pod.t for the perlfaq.  Surprising, all the tests passed.  I deliberately messed up some of the files to make the tests failed, just to make sure they were really passing.  Nope: they all really pass.  <br/><br/>Then I had to update perlfaq.pod, which is the table of contents.  That's a rare event since we hardly ever add new answers.  Luckily, I had written a script for this, although I had to change a few things in the template.  No big whoop.<br/><br/>I think I need to get the FAQ autoposter working again:  that's what really drove the improvements and corrections before.  I'll save that for later, though.</p>
