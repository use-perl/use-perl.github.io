...but I do know that the piano playing dog is named "Rolf", not "Ralph".

Actually it's "Rowlf".  Rowlf The Dog's <i>Old Brown Ears Is Back</i> is a great collection of pop tunes.

I think Randal does impressions of Kermit the Frog.

One point for the honorable representative from Maryland.

Bah, I do a better Kermit than Randal does.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

According to <a href="http://vr.ncsa.uiuc.edu/BS/Muppets/episode_guide_ms.html" title="uiuc.edu">The Muppet Show Episode Guide</a uiuc.edu>, the first guest in the first season was Charles Aznavour, and the last guest in the last season was Senor Wences (pop!).

That's the go ahead score! Two more points for ziggy, with a half-point bonus for a link, for a total score of 3-1/2.

'First guest' is relative.<br> <br>muppetcentral.com lists Episode 1 as starring Juliet Prowse.<br> <br>Juliet Prowse - Episode 1<br> <br>Taping Dates: January 29-February 1, 1976<br>Original Airdates: April 25, 1977 (New York)<br> <br>Charles Aznavour - Episode 9<br> <br>Taping Dates: June 29 - July 1, 1976<br>Original Airdates: January 17, 1977 (New York) and January 22, 1977 (LA)<br> <br>"While The Muppet Show had two specials that aired on ABC as pilots, this debut episode (Prowse) and the subsequent Connie Stevens show were shot before the rest as pilots as well."<br>

<h2>Rawlf's song</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/delegatrix/">delegatrix</a> on 2003-11-14T00:10:20</h3>
I would guess Rawlf most often played either the Muppet Show Theme Song, or It's Not Easy Being Green.
