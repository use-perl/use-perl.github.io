<p>I started a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl_mongers">Perl Mongers entry at Wikipedia</a>, mostly to get a bunch of scraps of paper off of my desk. Surprisingly, I didn't have that much to put in the entry. Maybe you can help.<br/><br/>I really wish I had taken better notes while we were starting Perl Mongers (but actually programming Perl was much more engaging, and we didn't have fancy blog software back then). After Dave Cross conducted the <a href="http://www.pm.org/census/2005/">2005 Perl Mongers census</a>, I wanted to make a list of who did what in Perl Mongers, especially in the early years. I tracked down the names of the first groups, mostly with the help of the news sections Chris Nandor wrote for <a href="http://www.tpj.com">The Perl Journal</a> (back when it was on paper).<br/><br/>If you can fill in some of the details, please edit the page or let me know what you know. Links to substantiating evidence is nice (such as a first post to a mailing list) since those things tend to have dates on them.</p>

Say it three times: "Lisbon is in Portugal, not in Spain. Lisbon is in Portugal, not in Spain. Lisbon is in Portugal, not in Spain"<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br><br>Moreover, it's Portugal's capital<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

Ugh. I knew that too. I'm such a dork.<br><br>However, it looks like people fixed it pretty quickly on Wikipedia.

I am really curious to see what will happen now: basically, you have asked a group (already computer-literated of course) to write their own history. Will this lead to a very good Wikipedia entry? Are we going to witness a huge stream of revisions? We'll see.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

I predict a huge stream of revisions and reverts entirely around brian's name.<br><br>I'm considering starting a discussion note, just to try and prevent that, but I'm not sure if that's going overboard...

Colour me unsurprised.<br><br>Interestingly to me, the official wiki style seems unclear to the extent it tolarates differences.  I weighed in briefly, against my better judgement.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
