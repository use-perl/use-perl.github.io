For anyone who missed the Start of Joke / End of Joke tags<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... this is the style of forged email of a current eMail trojan-worm floating around. IIRC, it's one of the several templates for <a href="http://securityresponse.symantec.com/avcenter/venc/data/w32.mydoom.ax@mm.html" title="symantec.com">MyDoom</a symantec.com>.

I figured it was something like that, but I normally don't see them.  I've been getting one about every five minutes today.

Oh, I assumed you recognized it for what it was and were posting it for the pure irony.

You missed several really weird, really pernicious worm/trojans during your "camping trip".

I love the ones I get from "the org.uk team".  org.uk only contains third-level domains.  They're almost as good as the ones I get from "the cantrell.org.uk administrators".  So that would be from me then?  I don't think so!
