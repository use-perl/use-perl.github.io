<p>I had to edit perlfaq6's "I put a regular expression into $/ but it didn't work. What's wrong?" last night, so I did what I usually did: use a word from the question title to jump to the right place in the document.  I figured the right word would be "wrong", but as I jumped from instance of "wrong" to "wrong", I thought there were an awfully lot of "wrong"s.  I hadn't really thought about it before: what's the balance of "wrong" and "right" in the perlfaq?  Who's winning?<br/><br/><pre>
#!/bin/sh<br/><br/>cd /Users/brian/Dev/perlfaq<br/><br/>echo "    doc           wrong    right"
echo "----------------------------------"<br/><br/>for doc in perlfaq[123456789].pod;
do
	wrong=`grep -c -i wrong $doc`
	right=`grep -c -i right $doc`
	printf '%-12s %8d %8d\n' $doc $wrong $right
done
</pre>	<br/><br/>Even without tallying the totals, I see the "right" wins out over "wrong", although perlfaq6, the doc I was editing, does have the highest number of "wrong"s.<br/><br/><pre>
    doc           wrong    right

</pre><br/><br/>Curiously, the distribution of "wrongs" is a bell curve, although not
quite symmetrical.<br/><br/><pre>

I at first thought "R" must be a really bad name because it must be hard to find in Google, but <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=R&start=0&start=0&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official" >it's the second result</a> (the first is the stock quote for "R" (Ryder System Inc)).  "R" is slick: I wish I had this when I was doing chemistry.<br/><br/><pre>

Still, "wrong" might be right word even if it seemed to show up a lot. I modified my shell script to check the other words too, and on a second revision, check some words with their juxtaposed punctuation, thinking that combination would be even less frequent.<br/><br/><pre>
#!/bin/sh<br/><br/>cd /Users/brian/Dev/perlfaq<br/><br/>doc=perlfaq6.pod<br/><br/>echo "     doc        word            count"
echo "-------------------------------------"<br/><br/>for word in "I" "put" "a" "regular" "expression" "into" "$/" \
	"but" "it" "didn't" "work" "work." "What's" "wrong" "wrong?"
do
	count=`grep -i -c $word $doc`
	printf '%-15s %-15s %4d\n' $doc $word $count
done
</pre><br/><br/>If I wanted to jump right to the question, "didn't" is the word to choose, although "wrong?" gets me there in at most two hops.  I shouldn't choose "I", "it", or "a".  Their numbers are low because the -c switch only counts matching lines, remember. Curiously, "work" seems to always show up next to a full stop.<br/><br/><pre>

Not exactly a standard directory name, is it?<br>Just curious, do you use Gobo Linux (http://www.gobolinux.org/) or is there another reason for such a name?<br> <br>--<br>Offer Kaye

It depends on what you think "standard" is.  On MacOS X it's pretty standard.<br> <br>
