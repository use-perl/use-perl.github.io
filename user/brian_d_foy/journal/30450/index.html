<p>I hadn't thought about this before, but someone told me that the renewal emails I send out for The Perl Review get a high enough SpamAssassin score, about 3.5ish, to be blocked and probably never seen. <br/><br/>That's no good. Since we're about to start our third year of print issues, it's time for most subscribers to renew. If you haven't seen your renewal message, you can still <a href="https://www.theperlreview.com/cgi-bin/subscribe.cgi?renewal=999">renew online without it</a>, but I'd also like to know if a message titled "The Perl Review: Time to renew" showed up in your spam folder so I can fix that for next time.<br/><br/>I checked my code and found it didn't have the parts i thought I had put in last time, including names in the To and From fields. I also got a report that the email might be missing Message-ID. If anyone would like to help me investigate this, please send your raw message with headers to me (it's the reply address on the email).<br/><br/>This is actually a big deal in the magazine industry as people tyr to figure out how to get around bulk mailings and giving money to the post office. </p>

What SpamAssassin tests does the mail match?</p><p>

SpamAssassin isn't that mysterious. It's easy to find out what the tests match on, and therefore you can change your mails so that they don't match on those tests.</p>

This claims to be from Copperfasten Mail Firewall but they seem to be SpamAssassin rules. As was mentioned message id and to/from names are  missing.

Those do look a *lot* like SA rules, which is odd -- the copperfasten web site doesn't mention SA!  As an SA developer, I find this interesting...<br><br>Anyway, it's expected that occasional non-spam will score about 3.3 points -- and a newsletter sent to many subscribers would be quite typical for that score range.<br><br>The SA default threshold is 5, which is quite a bit higher than 3.3; anyone using a threshold that low needs to expect to spend some time monitoring for false positives, and rescuing and whitelisting them.  Personally, I would not recommend it, but it's up to them!

hey, gimme a shout if you need help on that.<br><br>I'd say with a To, From and MEssage-ID, though, you should be 99% of the way there....

I've seen some headers now that people have sent me their SA scores, and when I get back from traveling I'll set up SA on one of my machines to investigate further.<br><br>It looks like SPF_NEUTRAL gets a pretty high score, so I'll have to think about that.

good point, I hadn't noticed that.  interesting.<br><br>it has got a pretty high correlation with spam; 95% of the SPF_NEUTRAL hits fire on spam these days (3.2% of spam, only 0.16% of ham).  still, it's nonintuitive.

Do they go out to everyone or *just* the people that need to renew? I absolutely do not want my subscription to lapse.

It's just the people who need to renew. In gerenal, if you wonder where you are in your subscription, send me email. I am working on a way to put this online without divulging personal details, but that's not fully finished.<br><br>Your subscription, however, ends with the issue after the next one, so you're okay right now.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

If we renew early, it justs adds to year to your account anyways, right?  So just renew early.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)
