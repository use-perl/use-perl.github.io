<p>Oh gees. Just when I thought the world was safe, Stacey starts to read anything I write on the web.  But, since we have been together, she learned HTML on her own (she asked me for help, so I helped her buy the O'Reilly book and that was that).  She learned how to ssh and scp to our internal staging server, she bought a new iBook and added its MAC address to our Airport access list, when I was on leave she showed me her shiny new iBook with MacOS X and I showed her Terminal, which she used to fix a permissions problem with something, and now she is reading this journal.  <br/><br/>So, by the time I get home, I expect that she will be sending in patches to the perlfaq, and over dinner I will have to explain how I did not get to them and I will commit them later.</p>
