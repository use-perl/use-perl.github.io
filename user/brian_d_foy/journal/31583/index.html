<div class="span8">
<p>I've released Crypt-Rijndael-0.06_01 to see if the simple change of using &lt;sys/type.h> solves most of the <a href="http://rt.cpan.org/Dist/Display.html?Queue=crypt-rijndael">bugs in RT</a>. In trying to test this, I've discovered that everything in my life is now some sort of BSD. I used to have linux logins, and I guess I should pul that Windows box out of the closet, but I'll wait to see what CPAN Testers say.</p>

<p>In looking at the entry, I see you don't state <em>what</em> it uses.  Further, in viewing source, where you would have stated what it uses, I see that it has two blank spaces instead of one, implying that some programmatic transformation took place (or just some very weird typo).</p>

<p>Looks fine to me, though it might just be that brian got to it before I got here.</p>

<p>Interesting.  It looks fine to me now, too.  However, that doesn't how &lt;sys/type.h&gt; disappeared when I viewed source.  Weird.</p>

I just got there before I saw Ovid's comment. The angle brackets look like HTML so the Slash either removed them when it stored it or displayed it. They where there when I edited it but not when it showed up.  Whatever.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

<p>Ah, yeah, of course. The HTML tag filter doesn&#8217;t mangle user input, it just scrubs posts during rendering.</p>

<h2>Win32 a nogo</h2>

(AS 5.8.6, XP SP2, VS.NET2K3)<p>

Doesn't build on Win32; but after I hacked
the UINT32/UINT8 typedefs back to the 0.05
original, it built (w/ a few warnings):</p><p><blockquote><div><nobr> <wbr></nobr><tt>/*<br>typedef __uint32_t UINT32;<br>typedef __uint8_t UINT8;<br>*/<br> <br>typedef unsigned long UINT32;<br>typedef unsigned char UINT8;</tt></div> </blockquote>Lemme know if you want an RT ticket on it.

I think there is already an RT ticket for this, but it uses cygwin, so was hoping it would all work out.<br><br>I'm not much of a Windows programmer, but is there another header that's equivalent to types.h? If not, what's the best way to do an #ifdef to detect windows? Pointing me at a module that does it right is fine as long as I can see an example.<br><br>Thanks,<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

Win32 does have a sys/types.h (that part compiles
OK), just no __uint32_t/__uint8_t.<p>

A quick scan of perl-5.8.8 srcs shows WIN32
(and occassionally _WIN32) are the defines used. IIRC, thats defined by VC by default. In fact,
when applied to rijndael.h, this works:</p><blockquote> <div><tt>#ifdef WIN32<br>typedef unsigned long UINT32;<br>typedef unsigned char UINT8;<br>#else<br>typedef __uint32_t UINT32;<br>typedef __uint8_t UINT8;<br>#endif</tt></div> </blockquote>

Yeah, I figured that out right after I posted that. I did that for Crypt-Rijndael-0.06_02 which I uploaded last night.
