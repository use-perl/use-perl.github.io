>Curtis tagged me so I guess I'm it</a>. I have to tell you five things you don't know about me. <br/><br/><ul>
<li>I've personally violated the <A href="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode18/usc_sec_18_00001385----000-.html">Posse Comitatus Act</a>.
<li>I made it appear as if I worked for the CIA to get past a military checkpoint in a foreign country while on official business of the government.
<li>I've seen $600 million in cash in a pile on the floor. It's a smaller pile than you think it is. I've only held $100,000 in cash at one time though. It's also smaller than you'd think.
<li>I took over a Jordanian airliner and told the security official if he didn't like it he could leave my airport. We had a brief armed stand-off then shook hands and were friendly from then on, even after I gave him a tampon and told him it was a cigar.
<li>I worked with the guy who put the first Java applet on the web. He had it before everyone else because he was the guy creating it for Sun.

Personally, I think they should have distributed it to the troops.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>
