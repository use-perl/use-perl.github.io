<p>Horror of horrors---I was in the middle of editing an article for The Perl Review and I could not launch other applications.  I started quitting things, but then I could not launch them again.
I restarted (sigh---first time in months) and then it looks like darwin could not launch the window manager, which left me with a blank blue screen.  My first blue screen of death has to happen on a Mac.<br/><br/>No problem.  I have been meaning to get Jaguar for a bit, so now I was forced to do that.  I was not worried about my data---everything is in CVS somewhere---I just need to get to a shell.  I wonder if there is a way to get to the console. If I had set up sshd I might have been able to get in from another machine.<br/><br/>The problem with Jaguar is that I need to buy it in a store if I want it right away.  The store that sells it and that is reasonably close is the wretchedly clueless CompUSA.  I have to dodge the red-shirted zombies and get past the dorky PC junk  and make it to the checkout with the eager beaver new guy trying to upsell me.<br/><br/>Jaguar took a bit of time to install, bash did not work at first, and a lot of other things needed some adjustment.  Jaguar installed perl5.6.0 again, and that is what /usr/bin/perl became.  However, in the Perl maintainer's infinite wisdom, the good Perl was still around as perl5.6.1, and none of my scripts have complained about @INC problems yet.<br/><br/>Other nice inclusions: python and ruby!</p>
