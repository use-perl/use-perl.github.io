<p>I've been doing more work on my <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/brian_d_foy/journal/37375">BackPAN Indexer</a>, but the sort that doesn't do any indexing. What I really need to do is be home for more than one day at a time so I can get everything set up on a computer that I don't have to use. Indexing tens of thousands of distributions takes over my MacBook's poor disk drive, and then I can't do much.<br/><br/>So, in the meantime, I'm cleaning up the structure of the code so I can make things pluggable. There are several components that you can plug in: A Queue class that makes the list of things to process, a Worker class that defines the work to do on each thing in the queue, a Reporter class to store the Worker's results, a Dispatcher to hand out work to the Workers, and an Interface to show the live run information. <br/><br/>It's turned out to be a really nice design (that's getting better). I know I have a good design when the things I want to do next naturally fall out of the design. For instance, I wanted to test <a href="http://vimeo.com/1677855">the Tk Interface</a> and move things around, but I didn't want to actually process anything. I started working on a test script to mock everything, then I realized I didn't really need mocks because I could plug in null classes to handle the Queue, which would be empty or not, and the Worker, which would just do nothing.<br/><br/>So, as I've been moving around the country, I've been working on coding at least two examples of each component. That's a really nice way to design things. A design that works for one thing might not work for another thing. Forcing myself to come up with two non-trivial examples shakes out some of that stuff. This stuff is going to be inportant if people want to run the indexer themselves, or if someone ever sets up a CPAN Testers style group to do it (i.e. the dispatcher can distribute work around the world).<br/><br/>This week's work has been to create <a href="http://vimeo.com/1732149">a Curses interface</A> (because if I can't run it in a terminal, it's not Scottish), and something I'm calling the Test Census, which just counts the Test:: modules instead of doing the full indexing (and storing the large amounts of data I collect). If you're looking in <a href="http://github.com/briandfoy/mycpan-indexer/tree/master">the git repo</a>, check out the <a href="http://github.com/briandfoy/mycpan-indexer/tree/test_counter">test_counter</A> branch. There is something a bit broken with the dispatching or the reporting somehow, but I'll think about that next week.<br/><br/>I think the full index of BackPAN will start next week, and I expect it to run for about a week. I figure the error rate will be about 5%, like it was for MiniCPAN, and I'll then spend some time improving the indexer. While the indexer is running, I'll work on the other bits.<br/><br/>
