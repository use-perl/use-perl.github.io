<p>If you think a new <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Crypt-Rijndael">Crypt::Rijndael</a> might break your application, please test it with 0.06_09. Barring anyone complaining, it's going to be an official release after the holidays.<br/><br/>When I took over <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Crypt-Rijndael">Crypt::Rijndael</a> I didn't ealize how many people were using it, and I don't want to break any applications with an unintended upgrade some of you might perform.<br/><br/>I think I've fixed most of the architecture issues, and  am waiting for more results from CPAN Testers. I'm especially interested in Solaris reports for this release.</p>

Could you give me any ideas how to fix those? Was it already declared in basetsd.h?<br><br>Although I do want to fix the module for everyone, I'm not going to hold things up for Strawberry Perl since its still experimental. I will try to fix it though.

<p>Do you feel the patch in <a href="http://use.perl.org/comments.pl?sid=33654&amp;cid=51659" title="perl.org">this  post</a perl.org> is too much of a hack?</p>

Experimental? Well the packaging mechanisms we are using are still alpha, but the Perl itself and the compiler are bog standard 5.8.8 and MinGW...<br><br>There's nothing particularly special about them at all.

I don't know much about Windows, but when I looked at the Strawberry Perl page, it says "Strawberry Perl is currently an alpha release and is not recommended for production purposes." That's what I mean by "experimental".<br><br>I'm happy to apply patches, but I don't know why MinGW is acting differently from GNU on unix.

<p><blockquote> <div><tt>[22:24] &lt;@tsee&gt; BinGOs, since you have VC++, can you test Crypt::Rijndael 0.06_09 for me after replacing "typedef unsigned long UINT32;" with "typedef unsigned int UINT32;" in the MINGW ifdef in<br>rijndael.h? Or rather for brian d foy who maintains it now.</tt></div> </blockquote>  <p>I did this and it compiles and tests fine on Strawberry Perl with MinGW and dmake.</p>

<p>I also built and tested with Activestate Perl and VC++ toolkit and that compiled fine and tested okay.</p>
