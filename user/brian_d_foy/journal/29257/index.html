<p>...if you are near Boston, Dallas, Atlanta, anywhere in England, Paris, Oslo, Chicago, Portland, or Frankfurt. In how many of these places can I give a Perl talk? <br/><br/><ul>

<li>May 22-25, Dallas, TX
<li>Most of June, Lewes, England
<li>June 13-15, Paris, France
<li>June 16-17, Nordic Perl Workshop?, Oslo, Norway
<li>June 25-30, YAPC, Chicago, IL (hey, that's close to me!)
<li>July 10-14, Atlanta, GA
<li>July end-ish, OSCON, Portland, OR
<li>September 15ish, Frankfurt, Germany
</ul><br/><br/>I've sent mail to some of the people I know in these cities, but if you should have been on that list and didn't get mail from me, let me know!<br/><br/>And, does anyone in the European cities need a little Perl work? I could use something to defray those travel expenses. I shouldn't try to write a Perl book and travel in the same year! One doesn't make money and the other needs it. :)</p>

Hehe. Your geography lessons must have slipped your mind here, brian. Oslo is the capital of Norway. Sweden is next door.

Ah, damn. I shouldn't think about this stuff so late at night.

<h2>Portland, OR and OSCamp</h2>

<p>There is some talk of doing this OSCamp thing during OSCON this year as a community-led bunch of fringe events.  Nobody is exactly certain yet as to how it will manifest itself, but we would be happy to have you.</p>

I'm down for fringe events. This is going to be at the Portland Convention Center concurrent with OSCON, right?<br>
