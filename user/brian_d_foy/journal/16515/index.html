<p>The mud in Iraq is more like cement.  We don't get much rain, but it is still enough to create giant mudpits everywhere, and once you step in the mud, it decides to stay with you.<br/><br/>In other news, Sean Burke sent me some sample code to add hyperlinks to POD in a Tk text widget (very cool), Chris Nandor sent me some example iPhoto Mac::Glue things, although we both agree iPhoto is mostly unusable after a couple hundred images are in it, and I hear Andy Lester has a big surprise for TPC.<br/><br/>Last night we set up a wireless router in our tent, and the Windows folks who owned the router couldn't figure out what its name was or what network it was serving.  I leaned over to my Mac (I was reading at the time), popped open MacStumbler, found the router, then wrote an address/port scanner (the things you have to do when you are all alone in the middle of the desert...) and quickly found the router (it wasn't 10., so the program tried 192.168. and there it was).  We didn't have the username or password to configure the router, so I brute-forced it with LWP.  Then, they got out their PC games and did their thing while I went back to reading, casually wondering aloud why they couldn't do that stuff on their PCs.</p>

<p>They could have done it if they were geeks.  I'm a geek and you're a geek but chances are that they are not.  Not all gamers are geeks, and not all geeks are gamers.</p>
<p>Being a PC geek, instead of MacStumbler, I have <a href="http://www.stumbler.net/index.php?cat=2" title="stumbler.net">NetStumbler</a stumbler.net> installed on my laptop.  Oh and I probably would have started with 192.168. simply because every router I've ever owned has had a default address in that range.</p>



<h2>They are network geeks :)</h2>

I guess their version of Windows is not as wireless aware as MAc though.  The Apple Airport software can automatically detect networks, but they were having trouble with that.<br> <br>Windows does not come with Perl, either, so writing a program to scan a network (even if you know it was 192.168), then brute force the password (most routers use the same things) are almost impossible for them.<br> <br>If I did not want to use Perl, I could have used C, Ruby, or Python.  That's stuff that comes on the install discs from Apple.<br> <br>It is more of a success story for Perl, though, and why every computer should have it available.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
