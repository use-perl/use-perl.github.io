<p>Washington State GOP Precinct Committee Officer Chris "Pudge" Nandor makes it onto liberal media, a long time dream of his. His <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4f28pO17Ug">GOP Debate Song</a> made it onto NPR's <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=16726577">Morning Edition</a>. It's not listed in the rundown, put it's toward the end of the story and the music in the segue to the next story. As part of the continuing liberal conspiracy, however, NPR didn't include the parts of the song mentioning Ron Paul, prefering to focus on Romney, Guiliani, and Thompson.<br/><br/>He also made it onto <a href="http://www.rushlimbaugh.com/home/daily/site_112907/content/01125113.guest.html">Rush Limbaugh's show</a>, although the dittohead apparently misses the point and thinks Pudge is a Democrat.</p>

<h2>Opening act for the debate too</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/cbrandtbuffalo/">cbrandtbuffalo</a> on 2007-11-29T20:36:35</h3>
If you watched the debate during primetime on CNN last night, he was also the opening act for the entire gig. They played the whole song on a big screen while the bemused candidates looked on and listened for their names. They clearly hadn't heard the song yet.
<br> <br>
The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2007/11/28/us/politics/20071128_DEBATE_GRAPHIC.html?#video" title="nytimes.com">
NYTimes</a nytimes.com> has the whole thing in their video section.



<h2>&quot;Fair Game&quot;, too</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/stu42j/">stu42j</a> on 2007-11-30T19:15:56</h3>
His song was mentioned on PRI's Fair Game as well although not in a positive way.  It was referred to as "horrible".  It was part of their Daily Show style "comedy" segment though.<br><br><a href="http://www.publicbroadcasting.net/fairgame/.jukebox?action=viewMedia&amp;mediaId=653957&amp;podcastId=3567" title="publicbroadcasting.net">http://www.publicbroadcasting.net/fairgame/.jukebox?action=viewMedia&amp;mediaId=65<nobr>3<wbr></nobr> 957&amp;podcastId=3567</a publicbroadcasting.net><br><br>BTW, why does your Morning Edition link point to your perlmonks page?
