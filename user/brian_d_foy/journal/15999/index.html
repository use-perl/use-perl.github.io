<p>A long time ago I went away (well, February 7), and now that I am back in Chicago for a week I am clearing up the long queue of internal support tickets for my household. (The nerve of adding more computers to the network while I was gone!)<br/><br/>I logged into my FreeBSD machine, after several unsuccessful attempts to remember its name or IP address, and discovered it is still cranking out <a href="http://www.theperlreview.com/at_a_glance.shtml">CPAN stats</a> for <i>The Perl Review</i>.<br/><br/>I think it may have been turned off once for a thunderstorm, but that does not really count.  We do that to a lot of things just in case.  Other operating systems that I have used hardly make it through a day without blue screens of death.</p>

My Mail/Web server at the house just passed 1 year of uptime.
<p>
11:04am  up 367 days, 19:11,  3 users,  load average: 0.12, 0.16, 0.10
</p><p>
We've had at least 5 power outages, none out lasting the UPS.  It's really a shame, because I bought a larger UPS for this system a while back (10 months or so) and haven't had the heart to powerdown to move it over.  Now I'm afraid what won't come back after a reboot, so I'm holding off for now, maybe I'll give it a shot after 2 years of uptime<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

Ah, uptime comparisons.  I try to avoid them normally, but I was particularly chuffed when I got mailed the uptime of a box from a previous job, before it got made redundant.  It was one of the first things that I set up for that company.<blockquote><div> <tt>% uptime<br>&nbsp; 2:51pm&nbsp; up 1489 day(s),&nbsp; 2:45,&nbsp; 1 user,&nbsp; load average: 0.02, 0.04, 0.04</tt> </div></blockquote> <p>It's been running squid constantly for several hundred users since day 1.  The OS is SunOS 5.6, so you can't have it all.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)

I am not really so concerned about the uptime, but the fact that it is still doing what is supposed to be doing pleases me.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br> <br>Maybe, in FreeBSD 8 or so (isn't that one code named SkyNet?) we won't even be needed.
