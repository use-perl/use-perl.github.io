<p>I have a use for Crypt::Rijndael, and it appears the author has disappeared (for the last several years).  Unless anyone complains, I'm going to take over the module, apply the outstanding patches, etc.</p>

Earlier this year I contacted the author and he said he wasn't using perl anymore and was happy for me to take it over. Adam Kennedy gave me co-maint on it, but to my shame I have yet to make a release.<br>If you've got the time to do it, please do!<br>I had been planning on adding it to Adam's shared svn repository, but however you want to do it is fine.<br>The specific fix I wanted was to get it to work with VanillaPerl. I'll check whether I posted it to RT, and if not, I'll post the patch.

So how would you prefer to do this Brian?<br><br>Take it over entirely, or do you want me to chuck it in my svn (since so many people already have commit) where multiple people can hack on it, and you can release from there...<br><br>Thoughts?<br>

If I take it over, I'll use my own repository. I know that in your svn, people can commit to it, but I also know that they haven't.<br><br>If fireartist or anyone else wants to maintain it, that's fine, but then they have to actually maintain it.

To be honest, I'd rather you maintain it.<br>My reason for patching it was just to get it working with VanillaPerl, but I haven't even used Windows in months now, which is why it slipped off my TODO list.<br>My knowledge of xs is also very basic.

We could fight over who has less XS knowledge<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br><br>
