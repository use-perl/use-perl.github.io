<p>Here's a little portability quiz for you.  Why doesn't this work?<br/><br/><pre>
... unless $^O =~ /win/i;
</pre><br/><br/>For bonus points, what do you think I was trying to do (just with the conditional)?<br/><br/>For super bonus points, which module do you think I look in when I use $^O?<br/><br/>

It's time for pre-Labor Day parties.

<h2>Portability</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/grantm/">grantm</a> on 2004-09-05T22:03:00</h3>
<p>I'm guessing you wanted to match something like 'MSWin32' and not match something like 'Darwin'.</p>

<p>As to what operation you were going to skip if you weren't on Windows, my crystal ball isn't too clear.  I used to skip flock on Win95/98/ME since it was (fatally) unsupported, but NT/XP etc do support flock.  It's not binmode because you'd be using 'if' rather than 'unless' (or just doing it anyway on all platforms).</p>

Yep, that's it.  I thought I was pretty slick with that<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/Win/ thing, until it didn't work on my Powerbook, which sets $^O to "darwin".<br> <br>That's all.  The operation I was trying to skip is no big whoop: just a test that won't work on Windows.  It was the intent of the conditional that was interesting, and you got it.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

Also 'cygwin'.<br>

I'd want to skip that one too, though.

&gt; I'd want to skip that one too, though.<br> <br>In the general case that's a tricky one, of course, since Cygwin can do quite many UNIX tricks, but also some Win32 tricks (and with libwin32 even more of the latter).<br> <br>
