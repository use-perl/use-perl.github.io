<p>I am only about half finished figuring out the "htim" block in the iTunes database, but I am almost  half finished with the first season of Will & Grace too.  After I figured out that I could turn on Quicktime sound for windows inthe background, I thought I might multitask and try to do both at the same time.  Well, I am making progress on Will & Grace.<br/><br/>I did have some minor revelations on the other side of the multi-tasking though.  So far I have used only MP3s created by iTunes, since that is how I ripped all of my stuff.  I checked out an MP3 I created directly from Audio Hijack, and that popped out a few more things.  Anyone have some links to some MP3s made with other things?  I need to know what created them too.  iTunes keeps this information separate from the file and creator types that the file system uses, and it might only be useful for MP3 created (or downloaded) with a Mac application.<br/><br/>I am still wrapping my head around the time offsets.  I think they changed it, or I am having wierd behaviour with my time zone (Baghdad---three hours ahead of GMT), the creation time of some things (Chicago), and GMT.  It looks like everything is 22 hours ahead (exactly) of what I expect.  Being on this side of the Prime Meridian provides me with a new way to play with times in my head.  I need to get on eof those multiple clock wall displays like you see in NASA movies (which reminds me, I want a digital watch with unix epoch time on it---in seconds).</p>
