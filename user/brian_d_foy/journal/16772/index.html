<p>I thought I might start to classify bugs---create a taxonomy, so to speak, that perhaps gives a latin name to every species.<br/><br/>I could start with the one I beat my head against today. I wanted to print some formatted text.<br/><br/><pre>
use Text::AutoFormat;<br/><br/>$text = autoformat( $entry, { ... } );<br/><br/>print $entry;
</pre><br/><br/>Why does this not work? I just want to format some text. For 20 minutes or so I fiddled with all sorts of things to figure this out, and no matter what I did, the text still came out in a big jumble.<br/><br/>Can you spot the problem?<br/><br/>If I want to print the value of $text, I should use $text in the print statement.  It seems so simple, but today that eluded me.  Not only that, I know I have made this same sort of error many, many times in my life.  It deserves a name---a really important name---to elevate it beyond its mere stupidity into some sort of software engineering jabberwocky worthy of conference presentations, journal articles, and high brow discussion.</p>

Not a side effect.  The variable doesn't get modified....

<p>&lt;aside&gt;Ain't it nice to be able to comment in brian's journal?.../me wonders how long this can last.&lt;/aside&gt;</p>

I just figured it was a brainfart when adding the autoformat call, that the code was originally something like:<blockquote><div> <tt>$entry = get_the_entry();<br>print $entry;</tt> </div></blockquote>and brian said "Hey, I want formatting", and added the autoformat line.<blockquote><div> <tt>$entry = get_the_entry();<br>$text = autoformat( $entry, {...} );<br>print $entry;</tt> </div></blockquote>At least, that's usually how I get in this situation...

<p>"Brainfart" now that's "worthy of high discussion"<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-) Perhaps "Brainus Farticus" would lend it more latin flavor (or not). Seriously though, brian's error looked to me like it was coming from too much C programming, a la...</p> <blockquote><div> <tt>stpcpy (char *to, const char *from)</tt> </div></blockquote> <p>"C Considered Harmful"? Nah...</p>

I can see Ed's point, and if I had showed the progression of my thought, it would have been more clear (or maybe less).  I wanted to use $text, but something earlier was messing up, so I put $entry into the string, although it was ugly, unformatted HTML.  I never changed it back to $text.<br> <br>[I'll keep comments on from now on.  At the beginning I was just afraid of a bunch of people saying really stupid things (like on other blog/journal sites, but use.perl does not really have a lot of that]

This seems to be a sibling-bug to:<blockquote><div> <tt>use warnings;<br>$value = 42;<br>print "$valu is the answer.\n";</tt> </div></blockquote>I think that for short programs, both bugs might be caught by use warnings; but in long programs, your bug is more likely to be undetected becase both names will be reused.
<p>
I would call your bug something like "unintended discarded outputs."  Which doesn't sound very high-falutin', but oh well.</p>
