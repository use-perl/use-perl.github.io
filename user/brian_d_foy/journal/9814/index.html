<p>I was given a <a href="http://www.despair.com/">Demotivator calendar</a> for Christmas, probably because I found an old one and cut out the picture to hang over my desk---A man in a track suit sitting on the bench by the side of the track with his head in his hands, under which it says "Failure: When your best just isn't good enough".<br/><br/>Andy Lester called me the other day, as he tends to do when he's driving and has run out of interesting people to talk to, and I started to tell him about this calendar.  As usual, he had heard about the cool new thing about two hours before I did because someone in his office has the same calendar.  I tell him "Listen to January's quote" and then he tells me what it is.<br/><br/>For those of you who are not on the leading edge of trend like Andy (but like me), here is the quote under a serene forested- lakeside sunrise scene titled "Motivation":<br/><br/><blockquote>
If a pretty picture and a cute saying are all it takes to motivate you, you probably have a very easy job.  The kind robots will be done soon.
