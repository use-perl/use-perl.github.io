<p>I'll be in Heathrow Terminal 4 most of the afternoon on the 23rd.  Who needs a drink?
Or are the airports as messed up as the American ones?<br/><br/>And, if you cannot make it, any suggestions on ways to keep myself occupied during the layover?</p>

<h2>Layover</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Buck/">Buck</a> on 2003-11-21T16:02:48</h3>
<p>Coming back from Jamaica last month, I was OK until arriving in Miami. Immigration was swift enough, but customs was more time consuming; I had to uncheck my baggage and go through TSC's inspection area. Then, go through metal detectors to get to my terminal. It was a four-hour layover, so I fired up the TiBook, updated my journal and uploaded what pictures I still had in my camera to iPhoto and created an album. There was no wi-fi where I was at the airport, and the battery was getting low, so I shut it off and listened to some music on the iPod.</p>
<p>By the way, my Jamaica pictures, for those who are curious, are <a href="http://webpages.charter.net/buckp/" title="charter.net">here</a charter.net>. When you get to Image16, I'm the one on the far left, with the drink in my hand.</p>



<h2>mmm, beer</h2>

<p>I think there are some suitably awful bars ground-side that are open during regular licensing hours, so I'll try to make it down.</p>
<p>I'll also forward this url on to london.pm in case anyone else feels the urge.</p>
<p>And now for the part that could miss if this is too late, what time do you get in?</p>

i get in at 1300 from that country in the south that doesn't start with an "I".<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br> <br>i won't be able to leave the terminal though.
