<p>This week I get to sit behind a desk for the midnight shift.  I make sure that somebody gets a call if we all catch on fire or a mortar round lands on us.<br/><br/>That also means I get to use the computer when everyone has gone to sleep.  I have a long list of things to download.<br/><br/>I started to use my <code>journals</code> program to download all of the use.perl entries I have not read, and when that file got to be a few megabytes, I realized I had not used <code>journals</code> in a long time.  I was automatically making about 1,000 serial HTTP requests.  Bandwidth is decent (15k) considering I am in the middle of the Iraqi desert.<br/><br/>While walking around while on duty today, since there were no fires to put out (literally, we call it fire guard if we are in garrison), I thought about making a Perl class browser.  Since I work offline, I do not have search.cpan.org at my fingertips.  I have not gone much farther than that thought though.  Maybe something like Squeak's method browser?<br/><br/>Stephen Jenkins sent me some reprints of some articles.  At first, I thought some lawyer from Canada was suing me since I saw the back of the articles first, and then I turned it over to see his business card stapled to the top and the word "Perl" sprinkled about the text of the article.  The stuff looks really cool, like some of the stuff I was doing in grad school to automate simulations (Laziness, indeed).<br/><br/>And, sorry that I don't have your name at your fingertips, but I've been talking to a RealBASIC programmer about iTunes libraries.  Between us I think we cleaned up the parts I couldn't figure out. I just got iTunes 4, so I can start playing with that.<br/><br/>The Perl Review is on my mind a lot lately.  Too bad I am gone until April (then DisneyWorld in May, then wedding and honeymoon in June, then TPC?).  I think this little hiatus is giving me the clarity petdance wishes I had when I was neck deep in it.  Ziggy created an LLC in Maryland, too, so that is a bit of a kick in the ass to get my act together.<br/><br/>Again, thanks to the nameless people who may be sending me things from my Amazon.com wishlist.  I got four of those today.  Make sure I buy you the appropriate amount of beer when we meet.</p>

<h2>Good Mood</h2>

I really get in a good mood when I read your journal. I know the Perl community is very helpful and very supportive, but it really cheers me up when I see it effect.
