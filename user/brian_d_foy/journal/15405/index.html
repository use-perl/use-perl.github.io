<p>I have been in Iraq (or, as we say, "in theater", which includes all
of CENTCOM, or Central Command, which also includes Afghanistan) since
April, and, when I found out that we were going to be here for 365
days, the functional equivalent of forever, I had my PowerBook sent to
me. I can now download pictures from my digital camera and my wife can
send me pics, MP3, and whatnot on CD, and I can do the same thing
back.
<p>
Some time after I got my PowerBook, we got a limited network
connection, but I still have not been able to connect to it because
they have not approved laptops yet. They have not figured out how to
identify people who violate the use policy, which is probably the
strictest policy ever to exist, designed by a team of pogue REMFs
(rear area mother... well, this is a family friendly place) who
throttle traffic so their connections stay fast. I kid you not.  So,
without the network, I cannot sync any of the CVS working copies I
have, cannot use my iJournal client, and cannot ssh.  Well, I cannot
have everything I guess. When you think about the sacrifices that
soldiers make to be here, remember that I cannot ssh. The horror.
<p>
After two weeks of asking around, I found a USB floppy drive that I
could borrow, and after a month I found someone selling floppy disks.
Everyone sells blank CDs, but I cannot put CDs in the internet
computers. Now I can do my work on my Powerbook, save it to disk, and
walk over to one of the internet computers.
<p>
At the moment I am at a southern camp were we work from time to time.
It is really just a big parking lot and gas station, sort of the
middle-of-the-desert Truckers America, but without the convenience
store, hot showers, and scales. I live outdoors when I am here. They
have a signal company here so they have good internet access, and
people can register to add their laptops to the network.  They get a
DHCP address with a lease time of about a week, and everything is then
tracked by that IP.  When I went to register my PowerBook, they said
that they could only put Windows and NT on the network for security
reasons.  They told me that they did not have service paks and
anti-virus software for Macs.  I told them that's because Macs do not
need them.  Still, this was decided much higher than their level, but
they had not thought about what problems Microsoft had caused them two
weeks ago when that worm brought everything down for two days.  I know
when I am licked, so I did not push it.
<p>
My internet life is a bit complicated.  I want to save various things
off of the net and get them to my PowerBook.  I have to save them to
the floppy disk then carry it to my PowerBook. When I do whatever I
need to do with the information, then carry the floopy disk back to
the internet computer.  The whole process takes about a week because I
only get internet access every other day for about 30 minutes---no
time to waste, I come in with a list and buzz through it as quickly as
possible.  I typed this post a couple of days ago and left it on the
floppy for the next time I got access.
<p>
I am getting back into Perl, although I am making some really stupid
little mistakes because I have been away from it for eight months. Now
that I have time (well, what I have left over at the end of the day),
I can take care of a lot of little things I never got to because I was
too busy with the big projects.  I am constantly amazed how important
the network is when I need to research a problem.
<p>
That is it for now.  I have used up my use.perl time for today.</p>
