<p>I saw an interesting post on the comp.lang.ruby group this morning: <a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=200301141604.h0EG4cD03914%40vendian.org&oe=UTF-8&output=gplain">The Year In Scripting Languages  Lua/Perl/Python/Ruby/Tcl 2002</a>. (It does not appear to have been cross-posted to comp.lang.perl.misc, which is fine with me).<br/><br/><a href="http://www.theperlreview.com"><i>The Perl Review</i></a> is called a "quality publication", and Perl Mongers has "succeeded in cemeting [the Perl] community".  I had a pretty good year I guess, even though the credit most of the things that make those statements true belongs to other people.<br/><br/>I must have missed that people were putting this together, because a few other things have happened:<br/><br/><ul>
<li>A group of people have taken over active maintenance and development of the perlfaq.  I get to commit the changes, but most of the real work is done by other people.
<li>The code for PAUSE is in version control and the admins have started to make things easier to use.
<li>O'Reilly & Associates held the first Mac OS X Conference, and a lot of Perl people were there.  The rapidity which Perl has embraced Mac OS X has been amazing. Perl has CamelBones (and Ruby has RubyCocoa), but a lot of the big names in Perl use Mac OS X, which is not my impression of the other communities.
<li>Dave Cross, in the name of Yet Another Society, took over the role of Perl user group coordinator.
