<div class="span8">
<p>Someone told me the other day that the person who could figure out how to easily configure software who be rich beyond any dreams of avarice.<br/><br/>By easily, I think he probably meant something like what DBI has done for databases---even those things might be different behind the scenes, humans interact with it in the same way.<br/><br/>Once I thought about it, I realized how many attempts I have seen (or taken part in) to do that.  I have seen a lot of web interfaces (and even created a few), interacctive programs, autoconf style things and so on.  What a mess!<br/><br/>This reminds me of some advice I got in graduate school: these problems have not been solved because nobody wants to work on them, I think meaning that they are either unrewarding or intractable.<br/><br/>A long time ago, I took over the ConfigReader::Simple module, which handles line-oriented configuration files, and it has mostly made me happy.  However, all sorts of other things are going on in the world: Apache style configuration files, perl code as configuration, configuration by script editing (oh dear!), setting environment variables (a recent favorite sin of mine), command-line argurments (and the shell aliases to hide them), and all sorts of other things.<br/><br/>I have been sitting under the configuration tree for a while without illumination.  Anyone else have any ideas?</p>

<h2>Makefile.PL</h2>

I've been looking closer at Python these days and was suprised to learn that the module install process:<br/><br/>    python setup.py build
    python setup.py install<br/><br/>Lacks a *standard* testing call, so there is no<br/><br/>    python setup.py test<br/><br/>Even if the internals of ExtUtils::MakeMaker are gnarly, and make insn't always available, I sure do appreciate having:<br/><br/>    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install<br/><br/>and shiny new:<br/><br/>   perl Build.PL
   perl Build
   perl Build test
   perl Build install<br/><br/>I also like code generators which ask me questsions and then *write* the code for me with the correct configuration. I guess this doesn't work in all situations, but it's fun...especially in a text friendly language like Perl.



<h2>Config::Auto</h2>

I wrote this module after deciding I never wanted to write another configuration file parser again. Try it.
