1) print the line number and the line<br>2) off the cuff guess:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <tt> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; while ( &lt;&gt; ) {<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </tt> <br>3) <tt>}</tt> <br>4) Hmmm. , $/, @ARGV...that's all I can quickly dig up. So 3.<br> <br>Does reading your previous entry count against me? I'm guessin' this is related to line counting.<br> <br>I know I'm mostly wrong but it was fun to read perlvar again to see how far off I was.

1) No points awarded.<br> <br>2) Yes, the preceding line was while(){.  Bonus points awarded.<br> <br>3) Nope. Platinum points still available.<br> <br>4) The Global Thermonuclear War points are still available.<br> <br>5) Actually, this is unrelated to my post on line counting.  It comes from another program I was working on today.

At first glance, it looks like you're trying merge lines from a file with filenames passed on the command line. Why? Heck if I know. If your line appears after a file has been read, $. will be &gt;= 1, so $ARGV[0] might be the name of the file containing lines you're reading (since that name wouldn't print).
<p>
<code>open(IN, $ARGV[0]) or die "$ARGV[0]: $!";<br>
while ( &lt;IN&gt; ) {<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp;    print "$ARGV[$.] $_\n";<br>
}
</code>
</p><p>
What I'm pondering while looking at this, and without virtue of <b>perlvar</b>, is whether there's some other way that $. is side-effected.

Oh. I see. You were trying to print lines from all files in @ARGV, preceded by the filename. Unfortunately, $. is incremented after each line read, and the magic &lt;&gt; form of read is destructive on @ARGV anyway.

1) Points awarded.  I was trying to prefix lines with their file name and line number.  The line should have been "$ARGV\[$.] $_" so the "[" is not treated as the start of an array indexy thingy.  I typically print values between square brackets so I can notice any whitespace that might be there.<br> <br>2) Bonus points already awarded to gizmo_mathboy.  The preceding line used the diamond operator &lt;&gt; which I forgot to entity encode in my last response.<br> <br>3) Platinum and Global Thermonuclear War points still available.

Hm... for Platinum, I guess "use strict;".
<p>
For GTW, @ARGV, $ARGV, $., and $_

I guessed, without looking at the replies, that you were trying to print the filename and line number before the line. Your program is similar to an entry in my one-liners file:<blockquote><div> <tt>&nbsp; &nbsp; # Print filename before line<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; perl -pe '$_="$ARGV: $_"' file</tt> </div></blockquote> <p>
For question 5: <tt>$/</tt> and <tt>$\</tt> would directly influence the operation. I don't think that any special variables are affected by it (apart from the stringification of <tt>$.</tt>.</p>

You are right on my intent, but points have already been awarded.

A quess at the next line of code:<br/><br/>
    $. = 0 if eof;

No, that was not the line, although I have never thought to do that.  Interesting...

<h2>Line after</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/runrig/">runrig</a> on 2003-01-21T17:55:20</h3>
<code>close ARGV if eof</code>;
<br><br/><br/>Another way to say what you meant:
<br> <blockquote><div> <tt>print "${ARGV}[$.] $_";</tt> </div></blockquote> <br>I don't care for backslashes much if I can help it<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)



<blockquote>

<h2>Re:Line after</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/brian_d_foy/">brian_d_foy</a> on 2003-01-21T18:11:44</h3>
Nope, no close ARGV.<br> <br>Maybe it is time for another hint:  it is nothing tricky or unusual.





</blockquote>


<h2>Global Thermonuclear attempt</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/runrig/">runrig</a> on 2003-01-21T18:02:22</h3>

<code>$ARGV, @ARGV, *ARGV (or does that just count as 1 since you can get to them all through *ARGV?), $_, $.</code>
<br>So, 5?



<blockquote>

<h2>Re:Global Thermonuclear attempt</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/brian_d_foy/">brian_d_foy</a> on 2003-01-21T18:14:06</h3>
Nope, still missing a lot.  No points awarded.

<h2>One more stab at it</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/dws/">dws</a> on 2003-01-21T20:35:36</h3>
Double bonus: #!/usr/bin/perl -w
<p>
(Actually, I bet you really have a blank line before the while loop, but that you're not being that evil in the nature of your question.)
</p><p>
Global Thermonuclear War Bonus:
</p><ul>
<li>$_, obviously</li>
<li>@ARGV, via &lt;&gt;</li>
<li>$ARGV to get the name of the file you're processing</li>
<li>$. to get the number of lines read from that file</li>
<li>$|, just because it's there, and it affects what you'll see before the script craps out</li>
<li>$/, untouched (probably), to let you read your files line-by-line</li>
</ul>

Double bonus:  nope, the preceding line was the while().  nothing tricky.<br> <br>Global Thermonuclear War bonus:  i think that is pretty close---I had not actually considered $|.  Still, at least one is missing.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

Platinum. I meant Platinum. Aaaarg.

Bah. Never mind. I misread Platinum as being the one "before" the one before your line.
