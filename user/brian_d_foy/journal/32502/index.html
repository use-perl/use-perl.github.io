Flavell passed away in December</a>.  There aren't any details other than <A href="http://www.physics.gla.ac.uk/pipermail/psitg/2006/000053.html">a meeting change noting the funeral</a>.<br/><br/>I knew him from my heavy usenet days, and he would often send me corrections and updates for the perlfaq, especially perlfaq9, as well as my <a href="http://brian-d-foy.cvs.sourceforge.net/*checkout*/brian-d-foy/CGI_MetaFAQ/CGI_MetaFAQ.html">CGI Meta FAQ</a>. I never got the chance to meet him at a conference though.<br/><br/></p>

<h2>I miss him too</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/merlyn/">merlyn</a> on 2007-02-25T20:50:26</h3>
I too, interacted with him heavily, both in public support for the Right Thing in the CGI and HTML newsgroups, as well as discussions via private email.  I had said "someday we should meet in person".  Guess that's not an option now.



<h2>Sad news.</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/tsee/">tsee</a> on 2007-02-25T22:59:23</h3>
Back when I was at school and posting to comp.lang.perl.* regularly, Alan and I had some exchange of email. I noticed he was using a cern.ch mail address which prompted me to ask what he was doing.<br><br>Just recently, I wondered whether I might meet him again in an entirely different context since I'm now a particle physicist. I certainly did not expect to hear that there will not be such an opportunity any more.<br><br>This is sad news.<br><br>Steffen



<h2>RIP Alan Flavell</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/pne/">pne</a> on 2008-01-09T11:45:08</h3>
I only just found out about this. I remember him from my heavy Usenet days, too.
