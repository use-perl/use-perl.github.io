<p>We're having dinner at <a href="http://www.summershackrestaurant.com/Locations_Cambridge.asp">Jasper White's Summer Shack</a> in Cambridge (149 Alewife Brook Parkway) on Friday, May 28 at 7 pm. At the moment there's no agenda, but I'm sure someone will bring up Perl at some point. :)</p>

<h2>It's the kitschy tiki shack :)</h2>

That place in Fresh Pond is one of the goofiest places in town.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) Great for umbrella drinks in tiki glasses and nerds from 10 Moulton around the corner in Hawaiian shirts.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)



<h2>Just looking at the menu..</h2>

<blockquote> <div><i>
a gratuity of 18% will be added automatically to parties of 8 or more.
</i></div> </blockquote>
<p>
Isn't this a disincentive to take along parties of 8 or more?  Is this in addition to sales tax? Are the menu prices inclusive of any required taxes, or do they come on top at the end?  On top of this gratuity as well?  Are you still expected to tip or is that what this is?
</p>
<p>
I've been to a lot of (Australian) restaurants where they have a minimum table spend (often quoted in $ per guest) for large parties, but never one which just includes an extra 20%.  Is this common?
</p>
<p>
I hope you all have a great night!

None of that is strange in the US. In fact, usually the tip ends up being more, so it's not an issue. Since an average tip is 15%, and extra 3 cents on the dollar isn't going to outweigh hanging out with a bunch of friends.
