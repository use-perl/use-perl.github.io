<p>I was away from home for 234 days in 2004, which counts a couple of months of active duty, a couple of opera benders, and then the usual Stonehenge travel. That's only 33 weeks, though, and I mean "only" because Randal usually comes in around 40 weeks away each year.  His house is really just a very large, very expensive storage facility with an attached garage.</p>

THANKS for all you do, brian!



<h2>and go_home() is a recursive function</h2>

<p>Once in college (back before the turn of the century) my mother was shocked and hurt to hear me refer to going back to the dorm as "going home".

</p><p>Two old sayings are in conflict, <a href="http://scrapsayings.com/say-home.htm" title="scrapsayings.com">Home is where you hang your hat</a scrapsayings.com> and <a href="http://scrapsayings.com/say-home.htm" title="scrapsayings.com">Home is where your heart is.</a scrapsayings.com>

</p><p> Home was where-ever I wasn't, but would return next.

</p><p>In class, "home" was where I could unwind, the dorm. In the dorm, home was where I could really relax, my parents' place. But when there, home was where I belonged for next week, back at the dorm again. (Luckily for me my Mom groks enough maths to get the explanation.)

</p><p>So be sure to alway set $HOME with
<code>local $HOME=$here;</code> so like Dorothy in Oz you can click your heels and go $HOME when you're ready, with only a <code>return;</code>.</p>
