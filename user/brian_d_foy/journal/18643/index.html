<p>I wrote the teeny cpan command line script that comes with perl.  I just realized that it also comes with Mac OS X Panther (and probably Jaguar).<br/><br/>That is cool. I never really thought about it until I had to install perl on my new PowerBook today.</p>

<h2>similar experience, two decades earlier</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/merlyn/">merlyn</a> on 2004-05-06T09:45:35</h3>
When I was in the QA department at Sequent, I was having trouble getting consistent trouble tickets from the developers and the few end users we had.  So I wrote a little "mailbug" tool that collected relevant data and mailed it to a fixed address on the central server, then extracted that information into a database.
<p>
When they shipped the product to the first alpha customers, they included that tool for feedback.  And it stayed in through production.  As far as I can tell, my little quick few-dozen line shell script continued life through the end of the Sequent product (and company).
</p><p>
And then there was the time that I noticed that there was no "pretty printer" for Emacs Lisp data forms.  So I hacked one out, and posted it to the mailling list equivalent of the CPAN for little Emacs hacks.  A year later, I got email from RMS asking for permission to include pp.el into the core distro.  A year after that, when I invoked "M-x gnus" for the first time, I saw "Loading pp.el...", and gasped.  My little hack had come full circle.
</p><p>
Be careful what little hack you write... it may persist to the end of time. {grin}</p>
