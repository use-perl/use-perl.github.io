<p>I think I may be able to go to the Nordic Perl Workshop this year. I'm going to be in England that week, so I should be able to take a quick trip to Oslo. I don't know for sure since I haven't seen my wife's schedule yet, and the Glyndebourne Festival people are keeping mum about the performance schedule until next month, I guess (which means even if I knew the dates I couldn't tell you what they are).<br/><br/>What's the best way to get from, say, London, to Oslo? Is there something that doesn't involve airports? How about coming from Paris, where I might be? (and yes, that mean the Monguers de Perl should invite me to something: it will be our first time in Paris, and a local guide is always nice :)</p>

Copenhagen or Oslo? The Nordic Perl Workshop is in Oslo. AFAIK, there's a ferry going from Britain to Oslo - not sure where it leaves from. Hull perhaps? And there's always the possibility to go by train.

Oh, Oslo of course. Somehow I thought it was in Copenhagen, but that was a previous year.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

<h2>ferries to norway</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/cyclist38/">cyclist38</a> on 2006-03-08T08:41:44</h3>
there are ferries leaving newcastle to norway (kristiansand and haugesond) but both are quite a bit from oslo (250 km + if i recall correctly). as far as i know the only way to 'ferry' to oslo is from copenhagen, kiel and fredrikshaven, which would mean two ferry trips. if you're not gonna fly the best way is to kristiansand and by car to oslo.



<h2>Newcastle - Bergen</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/sjn/">sjn</a> on 2006-03-08T09:44:09</h3>
If I were you, I'd take the ferry from Newcastle to Bergen, and then take the train to Oslo.<br/><br/>I've heard the train trip between Bergen and Oslo can be stunning even in bad weather...<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)



<h2>Train</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Abigail/">Abigail</a> on 2006-03-08T16:47:11</h3>
If you take the train, it takes almost 24 hours, with 5 transfers. Leave at 6:10 AM from London, switch trains in Bruxelles, K&#246;ln, Hamburg, Koebenhavn, and Malm&#246;. Arrive the next day at 7:00 AM in Oslo.
