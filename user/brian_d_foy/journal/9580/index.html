<p><a href="http://associates.amazon.com/exec/panama/associates/ntg/browse/-/1067662/104-9755969-0647930">Amazon.com lets people access their "Properties" via SOAP,</a> and several publishers now like to mine that data for all sorts of reasons.  Amazon.com could have a small market information business if they wanted it---maybe they do, but people seem to be doing it themselves.<br/><br/>This puts me in a new situation when I do this sort of work.  Each person (or organization) that wants to access Amazon.com (which they call Properties) needs to have their own access token.  I have an access token, and I can access data but I cannot redistribute it.  That seems fair enough.  If the person I work for has their own token, and they contract me to do some work for them, I can use their token and give them the data they asked me to get for them.  They cannot redistribute it either.  Nothing changes in the technology, and only a little bit changes in what actually happens, but it is completely different legally.<br/><br/>As I was collecting sales ranks the other day, I wondered how various Perl books were doing.  I grabbed all of the data for those books, processed it, and output a nice chart.  Then I realized I probably should not post it to my journal (since that would be redistribution of their data), at least not without Amazon's approval.  I would like to add this sort of data to <a href="http://www.theperlreview.com/at_a_glance.shtml">Perl at a Glance</a> so we can see how Perl is doing compared to other technologies.<br/><br/>Instead of posting the data, here are some interesting conclusions.<br/><br/><ul>
<li><i>Programming Perl</i> (2nd Edition) ranks higher than <i>Programming Perl</i> (3rd Edition)
<li><i>Learning Perl</i> sells, but <i>Learning Perl on Win32</i> does not, according to the sales rank
<li>PHP books rank high, as do books with "Cookbook" in the title.
<li>Python books have middling sales ranks
</ul><br/><br/>What does this mean?  Write <i>Learning Perl PHP Cookbook</i> if you want to have a high sales rank, but leave off the Win32 bits.</p>
