<p>Have you read <a href="http://planet.perl.org">Planet Perl</a>? You probably have without knowing it because it just aggregates a lot of other stuff, like journals from this site.<br/><br/>Curiously though, it's a Python program, <a href="http://www.planetplanet.org/">planetplanet</a>,  doing all of the work.<br/><br/>Not that there is anything wrong with that.  We can be a big tent too.  But this reminds me of some question I raised a long time ago: <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/brian_d_foy/journal/9974">Perl  applications</a>.<br/><br/>Somehow I still have it in my head that the Python world is full of cool things designed for people to use for personal projects and Perl doesn't.  It could be that I've written mostly modules instead of cool applications (like blosxom, for instance).</p>

<h2>Timesink</h2>

In the same category than planet, there's Richard Clamp's <a href="http://unixbeard.net/user/richardc/cgi/timesink/" title="unixbeard.net">timesink</a unixbeard.net>. However it's less polished, not available (afaik) except from an svn repository, and lacks user-friendly installers and so on. Which are important part of applications.



<h2>Replace &quot;python&quot; with &quot;php&quot;</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jjohn/">jjohn</a> on 2004-08-22T13:27:03</h3>
...and I agree with you.  as does freshmeat.net.



<h2>PHP/Python have filled gaps where perl could be</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/TeeJay/">TeeJay</a> on 2004-08-23T10:35:14</h3>
There are definately good applications written in PHP and Python that are not available in perl, this is a shame as perl could often do the job better, but hasn't. It is also a shame because people who could be discovering Perl are instead using something else and missing out on what perl offers.
<p>
One of the key things we need to do if we want to advocate perl is to provide applications written in perl that people want to use, and can install quickly and easily.
</p><p>
We now have a decent perl based mailing list manager (siesta), and have always had a lot of very strong applications in the content management and ecommerce areas, but still no equivilent to Squirrel or a simple, secure bbs.

I wouldn't count that sort of thing because I'd lump it in with back-end stuff.  Indeed, I wouldn't count most CGI scripts since the user still creates web pages so that other people can use them.<br> <br>I'm looking for things that people use for themselves instead of making available to other people.
