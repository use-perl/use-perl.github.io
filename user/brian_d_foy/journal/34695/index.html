<div class="span8">
<p>It's looks like I've solved the Crypt::Rijndael problems thanks to <a href="http://use.perl.org/comments.pl?sid=37216&op=&threshold=-1&commentsort=0&mode=nested&cid=58312">a patch from djberg96</a>. It looks like some systems had an integer overflow problem with:<br/><br/><pre>
0xff << 24
</pre><br/><br/>So djberg96 changed that to use an unsigned int by attaching the <tt>U</tt> to the end of the number. I think I used to know that.<br/><br/><pre>
0xffU << 24
</pre><br/><br/>Additionally, I cast some return values from the XS stuff to <tt>(UINT *)</tt> to ensure that everything treated them as unsigned ints.<br/><br/>I hadn't been able to play with Solaris since Sourceforge's compile farm went away, but after <a href="http://use.perl.org/comments.pl?sid=37216&op=&threshold=-1&commentsort=0&mode=nested&cid=58318">elwarren suggested finding a QEMU image of Solaris</a> and a bit of googling on that, I remembered that somewhere on my bookshelf I had Solaris 10 media from their initial offer when they made it open source. It was still shrink-wrapped even. It took me a day to install that because I actually did it three times before I realized that even though I installed the 32-bit version, <a href="http://kb.vmware.com/selfservice/microsites/search.do?language=en_US&cmd=displayKC&externalId=1975">Solaris was assuming it was 64-bit at boot time</a>, causing panics. I have to fiddle with the VMware image by editing a file in the Mac OS X package (control click on the package, choose "Show Package Contents"). I found the <tt>.vmx</tt> file and added:<br/><br/><pre>
monitor_control.disable_longmode = 1
</pre><br/><br/>After that I had a bootable and fully useable Solaris 10. I spent half a day installing almost everything from <a href="http://www.sunfreeware.com">Sunfreeware.com</a> while I added a minicpan.<br/><br/>Two days after I started, I was able to fetch <A href="http://search.cpan.org/user/bdfoy/Crypt-Rijndael-1.04_03/">Crypt-Rijndael-1.04_03</a>, run a clean make with no  warnings, and then run the tests with the latest RT test cases passing.<br/><br/>Now I have a decent Solaris 10 virtual machine on which I can test things. It's on an external disk, so I can bring it to conferences to share with anyone who wants it. Anyone got anything good to trade? :)</p>
