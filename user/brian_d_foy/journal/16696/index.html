<p>inkdroid got me to thinking about what else I could do with Perl and the US Congress.<br/><br/>What if, like Fantasy Football and Baseball, there was a Fantasy Congress, or maybe even SimCongress.  Perhaps it could be like a role playing game (RPG) where you roll dice to create your senators and representatives.  Then, someone, bills get injected into the game and you either have to get them passed or beat them down. You win when your state gets an aircraft carrier contract and 10,000 miles of new highway. (What would Illinois do with an aircraft carrier?  There is the Great Lakes Naval Training Center (or, as the sailors say, Great Mistakes)).<br/><br/>Of course, the back end would have to be in Perl so objects could screw up other objects (core wars, anyone?) and steal secrets from other classes.  Objects could even mess with inheritance trees to steal votes, turning Republicans into independents. Forget about trying to do that in Java or C++.  To model Congress, you need a language that understands politics.</p>

<h2>Winning isn't everything</h2>

<p>How about if by winning you just recapture the 9th and 10th amendments?</p>

<p> <i>Of course, the back end would have to be in Perl so objects could screw up other objects (core wars, anyone?) and steal secrets from other classes.</i> </p>

<p>No way!  I'd make everything a lexical variable inside an anonymous block, so you couldn't get to it.  You'd have to go into C to do that.  (I wonder what protection there could be against Inline::*<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...)</p>



<h2>Sounds like some overlap with nomic</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Fletch/">Fletch</a> on 2004-01-08T13:51:49</h3>
<p>Not exactly, but similar.  You start with a set of rules (constitution, as it were) which allow for the modification of same and then go from there.
