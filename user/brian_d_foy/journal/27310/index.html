<p>On the Perl Whirl Geekcruise, I got to see Allison's Perl 6 talk which means I got to see her run some Perl 6 code. For the basic stuff I saw it was still pretty exciting.<br/><br/>Who wants to write the first Perl 6 article for The Perl Review? I'm not looking for a grand survey of the field; I want a quick and easy "Start writing Perl 6 now" article.<br/><br/>Here's my concept of the article, although it doesn't have to go this way:<br/><br/><ul>
<li>Installing Pugs
<li>Hello World
<li>Introduction to Pugs History
<li>Nifty new Perl 6 operators you can use now
<li>Lots of little programs
<li>References to all the other places to look
</ul><br/><br/>I also tend to have these ideas too close to the deadline for articles :(</p>

<h2>and then theres</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/n1vux/">n1vux</a> on 2005-10-25T17:16:16</h3>
All the Perl6::* modules on CPAN.

<p>No, I'm not volunteering. Need more TUITs, round preferred, but octagonal would suffice.</p>

<h2>need more tuits?</h2>

<p>Aha. <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/n1vux" title="perl.org">Boston.pm</a perl.org>, I see. You should have said that you were short of tuits last week. I could have given <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/jesse/journal" title="perl.org">Jesse</a perl.org> some to give to you.</p>

<h2>Not sure if you are still looking...</h2>

I'm not sure if I could be the type of Perl6 user you want for such an article, but I'd be interested in giving it a shot if you feel what I have to offer is a good match.<br/><br/>I've been using perl5 heavily since 1995 in various IT capacities so I am very familiar with the community. However I am just getting my feet wet with Perl6.  Although I've been avidly reading the Perl6::Bible modules for quite a while I only just downloaded pugs and started playing with it for a few weeks.  In a way that is good, since my troubles are probably the troubles of many others.  However you might be looking for more of an expert.  Please let me know.
