<p>I have the Magellan GPS Companion, which is a Springboard module for my Visor Edge (but really any Palm thingy).<br/><br/>I've been having a bit of fun taking it around Chicago, and even on trips.  Now I have a bunch of waypoints, but until last night they were stuck on my Visor.  The software lets me beam waypoints, presumably to other thingys with the same module, but I don't see any way to export them to something like text.<br/><br/>No matter. Perl can do it just fine.  I started with the Palm::PDB module, wrote my own concrete class for the factory, and shazam!: Palm::Magellan::NavCompanion.  It's a developer's release right now, but you should be able to access your waypoints even if the module is a bit ugly and incomplete. It should make its way around CPAN in a day or so.<br/><br/><pre>
	use Palm::Magellan::NavCompanion;<br/><br/>	my $pdb = Palm::Magellan::NavCompanion->new;
	$pdb->Load( $file );<br/><br/>	my $waypoints = $pdb->{records};<br/><br/>	$, = ", ";
	foreach my $wp ( @$waypoints )
		{
		print $wp->name, $wp->latitude, $wp->longitude;
		print "\n";
		}
</pre><br/><br/>I can only read the file right now.  I need to reverse engineer some more bits before I figure out how to write things back out.<br/><br/>Interesting tech note:  a lot of the things in the database format as C strings, so they end in a null byte.  I thought that I could handle that with some "x" placeholders in unpack, but I kept getting errors like "x outside of string".  Apparently it can't figure out the null byte positions on its own.  I punted and read the strings as one chunk then split on the null bytes.<br/><br/>I know the maximum length of the strings (because the GUI won't let me enter more characters than that), so I should be able to use the Z format specifier, but I didn't get around to trying that.  When I don't have much time, I use stuff I know will work.  I can refactor later.</p>

<p>Springboard is some weird Visor-only thing, and definitely not for "any Palm thingy".</p>

Hmmm, maybe so.  I guess the actual Palms don't do this sort of thing.
