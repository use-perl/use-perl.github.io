<p>Adam Turoff, Leland (???), and I walked over to Stonehenge to pick up 75 pounds of TPR (only half o the print run).  We walked about 8 blocks through very warm and humid Portland weather, and are now sitting in the speaker lounge enjoying the air conditioning.<br/><br/>Adam, Dave Adler, and I will have issues with us on the conference floor.  All I ask is that people cover my costs with a suggested donation of one dollar (feel free to give more).  I don't want to have to carry these things back with me.  For you subscribers that aren't here, I'll make up the delay in your delivery somehow.  I'll have 500 left when I get back to Chicago, and most of those are already committed to subscribers, so if you want one you need to say so.<br/><br/>I gave Allison Randal (TPF Goddess) the first 10 issues out of the box so she could auction them in the TPF fundraiser.  Those are the very first issues, so wash your hands before touching them, or put them in an archival quality frame or something.<br/><br/>So, now I feel a lot better because the printing doesn't suck.  I'll be able to sleep tonight, maybe.</p>

How it looks? Fantastic? I liked the cover in the website.

It looks decent.  It's not the fancy magazine that you'll see in a bookstore---yet.  It's going to get better and better though.

I'm working on a non-Paypal payment method now, but I might not get it going for a couple of weeks.
