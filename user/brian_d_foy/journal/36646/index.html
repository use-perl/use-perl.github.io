<p>The <a href="http://workshop.perl.pt/ptpw2008/">Portuguese Perl Workshop</a> is over and I'm finally back home after my first European Perl Tour. Now that you don't have any more iPhone hype to listen to, you can listen to my Portuguese Perl Workshop keynote address (<a href="http://www.cyberears.com/cybrss/3217.mp3">mp3</a>) and see the slides (<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/brian_d_foy/why-i-am-passionate-about-perl">Slideshare</a> ).<br/><br/>You can also see the media from <a href="http://workshop.perl.pt/ptpw2008/wiki?node=SlidesAndMedia">other workshop presentations</a>.<br/><br/>I haven't had time to figure out how to put the slides and audio together in one package. Has anyone done that before?<br/><br/>I 'll have more to say about the workshop later. Thanks to everyone who participated, even if you didn't make it into the slides. I'll make a summary post of the whole thing later too :)</p>

I started writing a comment, but it ended up being rather long.  It's now a full blog post.  You can read it <a href="http://pjf.id.au/blog/?position=541" title="pjf.id.au"> on my main blog</a pjf.id.au> or here at <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/pjf/journal/36649" title="perl.org">use.perl</a perl.org>.

Yeah, I know how to do it the hard way that takes a lot of time. I was hoping for an easy way that doesn't take a lot of time.

The <i>really</i> easy way is to get someone to video your talk, and then put the video up on-line.
</p> <p>
Failing that, I find that editing the audio takes a huge amount of time.  So if you skip that, and you don't mind there being the occasional flub or unwanted noise, you've saved plenty of time.
</p> <p>
Given that you've only got 18 slides, I think using the slideshare slidecast tool will work fine for you.  Provided you don't have your slide transitions closer than 10 seconds apart, it shouldn't have any problems.  I assume you have more than three minutes worth of talk (the<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.mp3 is still downloading).
</p> <p>
If you <i>really</i> want to put no time at all into it, use the slidecast tool and just don't enter any timing information.  The user will hear the audio, but will have to do the slide transitions manually.

Videoing it isn't so easy. The lighting difference between the speaker and the slides makes that really tough. To do that, I could just use something like Profcast. I thought I'd be able to use that later to combine the audio and slides, but I guess not.<br><br>I'm really looking for something that is independent of any website so I have a standalone movie. I think the audio is too large for SlideShare, anyway. I guess there isn't an easy way.<br><br>The really cool way would be to put the slides as album art in the MP3. I've seen some other services do that, but I haven't been able to make it work.<br><br>It's not that I want to put no time into it. I just don't want to put more time than its worth, and I want it to be easier the next time. Most solutions are the same amount of work each time.

<h2>Combining audio and slides</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/drhyde/">drhyde</a> on 2008-06-11T11:31:03</h3>
I presume that the best way to combine the audio and slides would be in a Flash file.  Buggered if I know how to do it though.
