<p>I have been writing to just about any address I can find.  Some companies have written back.  Most companies are polite.  Hershey's and Kraft sent back quite hostile responses---their customer relations maganers were assholes.  Lone Star Western Beef sent me $40 of gratis beef jerky and a nice, handwritten note. Not only is their jerky the best I have ever had, they are nice people. :)</p>

What have you been writing them?

This was the first question that occurred to me, as well, but probably not for the same reason.  (Robrt is probably merely curious.  I want jerky.)

Given that he works as military police in Iraq, I assume he wants some free samples to hand out to the local population.  Giving away the chocolate from your own ration doesn't get you that far.  Just guessing here though.

<p>Sitting out in an MP station, brian probably doesn't have a lot else to do than critique his food.  I guess he's writing to the manufacturers of the food rations he's been eating.  The Army buys a lot of civilian food these days rather than make special stuff.  Cheaper, more familiar and with a long shelf life.

</p><p>Having done 10 days on dehydrated food, I can say that anything containing protein (ie. jerky) takes on a whole new taste sensation when you can get your hands on it.</p>
