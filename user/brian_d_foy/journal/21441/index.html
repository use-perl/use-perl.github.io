<p>All the Sox needed was a little karma, and Chris provided it by adding their logo to the use.perl main logo.<br/><br/>Did they call him to say thank you?  I'm guessing they are too drunk on their victory (and cheap wine) to do anything.  They've played a lot of baseball this week, and they need a good bender.</p>

Technically, beating the Yankees lifted the curse.  I and other Red Sox fans helped provide the good will to make that happen, but those things themselves did not lift the curse.<br> <br>But I agree, it is over.  However, ending the curse doesn't win you a World Series.<br>

I should point out that the curse has <em>not</em> been lifted.  The curse is considered to be the fact that the Red Sox haven't won the World Series since 1918, not that they haven't gotten there (which they did in 1946).

That is not how curses work.  The curse is not the fact that they have not won the World Series, the curse is what <em>prevents</em> them from winning the World Series.  Whether the curse has been lifted is not dependent on them winning the World Series, but winning it will be proof that the curse has been lifted.<br> <br>If I lock my door, it prevents people from coming in.  But just because I take the lock off doesn't mean people will come in, and the fact that no one has come in is not proof the lock is gone.<br> <br>I fully agree getting to the World Series is not proof of anything itself -- they got there in 67, 75, and 86 too -- even getting there by some great comeback, as they did in '86 against the Angels.  But the fact that this was against the Yankees, in the house that Ruth built, in the multiple-record-setting greatest comeback in the history of baseball<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... that could very well have broken Babe Ruth's curse.<br> <br>Either that, or it just pissed him off a lot more.<br>
