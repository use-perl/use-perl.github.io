The special variables involved are:
<ul>
<li>$. - the line number
<li>$/ - the input record separator (for &lt;&gt; and chomp)
<li>$\ - the output record separator (for print)
<li>$ARGV - the file I am currently reading
<li>ARGV - the filehandle I am reading
<li>@ARGV - the array I got the filename from
<li>$| - the autoflush value
<li>$_ - holds the current line
<li>STDOUT - the default output filehandle

<p>
It shouldn't need one. The <tt>$_</tt>line must already have one if you are looping with <tt>while(){}</tt> (unless you have -l on the #! line).
</p><p>
I think that I'm still missing something (apart from the black and white stripes). Does your code look like this:</p><blockquote><div> <tt>while (&lt;&gt;) {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; print "$ARGV\[$.] $_";<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; chomp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...<br>}</tt> </div></blockquote>If so the <tt>chomp()</tt> is unrelated to the <tt>print()</tt>. How could we guess that?<br>

I expected people to guess that since a very common operation after reading a line and before using that line is chomp().  Once someone knew that I did not chomp() before I printed the value, they could guess I did it afterwards.<br> <br>Oh well.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
