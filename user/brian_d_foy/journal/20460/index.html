<p>Somehow I am always surprised to see other people mention me in books and whatnot (I mean, why else would someone start a magazine unless they think they need attention? :)<br/><br/>But this week I saw it twice.  I had a couple of trips to the VA Hospital for some routine, back from the Middle East sorta things, so each day I took along a book to read.<br/><br/>Monday I took Peter Scott's latest gem, <i>Perl Medic</i>. The first thing I noticed with "The Perl Review" in big letters on the front next to a quote from Adam Turoff.  Of all the things Adam could have associated himself with, he chose TPR.  Okay, cool. Inside, Peter mentions Test::Pod, and hence me, on page 37.  However, the book is already out of date because Andy Lester completely changed the module and now it has a different module.  <br/><br/>Today I took Peter Scott's (and Ed Wright's) first gem, <i>Perl Debugged</i>, which I bought for $91 at The Perl Foundation auction.  I didn't pay as much as Michel Rodriquez who outbid me at $100 before they let on they had a second copy.  I found my name on page 41 when the authors listed a bunch of people with nice coding styles.<br/><br/>It still seems really odd to see my name along with the names of truly cool people.</p>

<p>I won't disagree that you have a nice coding style, but it is a bit unique:</p> <blockquote><div> <tt>if( open my( $fh ), "&gt;&gt; $ENV{HOME}/mail/fix-addresses" )<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; print $fh "$_\n";<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; }<br>else<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; print "$_: Problem: $!";<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; }</tt> </div></blockquote> <p>I've always wondered how that came about.  I must confess that I found it a bit jarring when I first saw it.</p>

I made it up before I had a lot of other code to look at.   I like lots of whitespace, and I don't like to stick parens and braces far away from the thing they enclose.  Otherwise, I get confused.<br> <br>It's kinda like optional Python.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

Worse yet, this is the style of code that Peter and Ed used in <i>Perl Debugged</i>.  I didn't realize anyone else did it like that.

It's called the "whitesmith" style by emacs.  According to the <a href="http://cc-mode.sourceforge.net/html-manual/Built-in-Styles.html#Built-in%20Styles" title="sourceforge.net">manual</a sourceforge.net> for cc-mode, <em>Popularized by the examples that came with Whitesmiths C, an early commercial C compiler.</em>
