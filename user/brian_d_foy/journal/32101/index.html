<p>We've cut the price for online subscriptions to <A href="http://www.theperlreview.com">The Perl Review</a> to $7, and made the PDF-only subscription available to everyone, including subscribers in the US. People who subscribed to the web-only edition in the last couple of months will have their subscriptions extended by a year. Normal print subscription prices will stay the same as long as the Postal Service keeps their prices the same.<br/><br/>The online-only version was really something we wanted to offer to international subscribers and eventually change to a print version. After researching the possibility of printing in three different countries in the European Union, we discovered that the same thing kills it: postage to other countries. The very slight savings in postage in the EU is offset by higher printing costs for lower print runs and a lot of extra work to come out the same as sending it from the US.<br/><br/>We are looking at ways to get the print copies to international customers though. We have two and a half years of back issues (10 in all) and those magically fit together into a single Global Priority Flat Rate envelope that we can send to most countries for $US9.50. That brings the price to just below the $1.11 postage to send a single copy in the US, which is the basis for our prices.<br/><br/>To make that work we need to rejigger the subscriber database a bit to recognize the different subscriber model, but that's actually fun work once we have the time for it. :)</p>
