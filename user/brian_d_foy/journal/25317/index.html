So far so good. :)</p>

<h2>4th Edition Question</h2>

How does the new edition differ from the last one?

Well, it's one higher, isn't it? It's not three. You see, most blokes, you know, will be reading at three. You're on three here, all the way up, all the way up, all the way up, you're on three on your keyboard. Where can you go from there? Where?

We've updated the content for the latest version of Perl and cleaned up a lot of things where we have better ways to explain it. We also added a whole chapter on CPAN.<br> <br>If you've used a previous edition of Learning Perl, there might be a couple new things for you to learn, and there are a couple of new jokes.<br> <br>Also, there is a special secret promotion that O'Reilly has. If you've read the Da Vinci code, well, you'll figure it out. The secret message contains the email address you need to use.<br> <br>Good luck!

I guess I will buy it then since I did not read that book.  : )

<h2>Hopefully the post-release ratings stay high :-)</h2>

<p>So, out of idle curiosity, do reviewers get a copy?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>

<p>And do you still need reviewers for <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/brian_d_foy/journal/25202" title="perl.org">Intermediate Perl</a perl.org> ? I sent in an email about helping with it but never heard back...</p>

I think we can work something out.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

Yes indeed, reviewers get a free copy. You should have got an mass email from me about that today, but if not ask me about it in private email and I'll give you the details.

<h2>Reviews of books that don't exist</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/drhyde/">drhyde</a> on 2005-06-23T09:01:12</h3>
Reminds me of the reviews of Peter Hamilton's "Judas Unchained" on Amazon.  He hadn't even finished writing the book when the first review appeared, giving it four out of five stars.  The reviewer gave it four out of five because "... Hamilton just needs to wrap it up nicely and he'll have a 5* book out again<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... but if he does slip up it will be a great disappointment and probably a 3*. Hence, before reading the book, I rate it 4* and look forward to it eagerly.".
