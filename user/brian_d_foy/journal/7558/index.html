<p>For the past couple of years I have wanted to codify what I actually do when I need to solve a Perl problem, even though  I don't think I am naturally gifted or have any special insight into the matter.  As one colleague told me, "An expert is somebody who has made every mistake."  I have certainly made a lot of mistakes, and after I get tired of a certain mistake I look for a way to not make it.  For Perl, I wrote my way of trying to not make mistakes in "<a href="http://www.panix.com/user/comdog/solve_any_perl_problem.pod"
>brian's Guide To Solving Any Perl Problem</a>".<br/><br/>I passed my guide around to my usual reality-checkers and I have let it sit for a month, so now it is your turn to see it, tell me where I went wrong, and add what you do right.<br/><br/>This is the first document I release for the new <a href="pdp.perl.org">Perl Documentation Project</a> which wants to create living Perl documentation that can flourish, change, expand, and adapt even if the original author abandons it (like much of the present documentation).  <br/><br/>As a community we know quite a bit, but we have trouble passing it around.  Other communities, such as FreeBSD or Linux, abound with HOW-TO documents.  We can say "Read the docs" as often as we like, but something needs to connect the hundreds of pages of Perl reference documentation to practical, everyday experience.<br/><br/>If you are an expert in your area, share your mistakes too :)</p>
