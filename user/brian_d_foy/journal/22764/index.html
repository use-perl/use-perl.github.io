<p>I'm creating <a href="http://www.theperlreview.com/Found/">"Found Perl"</a>, a little, virtual Perl memorabilia museum.

They publish pictures things that people find lying about: mostly flat things like scraps of paper. I'd like to do that for Perl.<br/><br/>For instance, I have on display:<br/><br/><ul>
<li>Pictures of a couple of versions of the Perl Monger t-shirt
<li>The temporary camel tattoo I was giving out at one of the Perl conferences
<li>My original receipt for my first copy of Programming perl
<li>Mark Jason's card announcing "Perl Advanced Techniques Handbook" (now "Higher Order Perl")
<li>and some other things
</ul><br/><br/>There is a lot of stuff I'd like to find, and even more stuff I probably don't know about.  If you have something, please send me an image or scan at <a href="mailto:found@theperlreview.com">found@theperlreview.com</a>.<br/><br/><ul>
<li>a picture of Amelia, the camel mascot of London.pm
<li>Nat's "Perl is my bitch" sticker set (What were the other slogans?
<li>An original blow-in card for The Perl Journal
<li>Pictures of other Perl t-shirts, especially the one given out at the first couple of Perl conferences
<li>The O'Reilly beret given out at one of the Perl conferences
<li>Scans of signatures from various Perl people (I don't have any myself)
<li>Tim Bunce's handwriting on a bar napkin saying "Generic database interface: use GDI or something"  :)
<li>Images of swag (keychains, water bottles, pens) that Perl vendors gave out.
<li>Instances of the string "Perl" in everyday life.  I remember seeing an image of a European road sign pointing to "Perl".  I think it was German, but I can't find it.
<li>and lots of other stuff that might be out there.

<h2>Kenmore</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/n1vux/">n1vux</a> on 2005-01-18T03:41:16</h3>
Thank you, your TPR DBA address in Chicago may explain (finally) why Chicago-based Sears sells <b> <a href="http://www.sears.com/sr/kenmore/products/km_product_entry.jsp?BV_UseBVCookie=Yes&amp;vertical=Kenmore" title="sears.com">Kenmore</a sears.com> </b> appliances.  Us Boston folk have wondered if their old, elegant <a href="http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/bu/?id=158468" title="emporis.com">Regional admin and warehouse at 309-401 Park Drive / 201 Brookline Ave</a emporis.com> (near Kenmore Sq and Fenway Park, now the <a href="http://www.brunercott.com/library/landmark/landmark.htm" title="brunercott.com">"Landmark Center"</a brunercott.com>, a urban-mall theatre/Staples/BestBuy) was really that great an influence on a Chicago chain. If the Sears household appliance line is named for a street in Chicago, or the town the street is named for, that makes much more sense.
<p>(One doubts Mrs. Sears taking residence in Brookline had anything to do with it.)</p>

I think the streets are named for the appliances.  I've been trying to find out the origins for the names of the streets around me, but I haven't figured out Kenmore yet.<br> <br>There are an amazing number of household names that come out of Chicago though.  This month's <i>Chicago</i> magazine goes through most of the roster.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

Actually the photo of a camel that came with London.pm's Camel Adoption Pack was just a random camel. It wasn't a picture of the camel that we adopted.<br>

<i>Instances of the string "Perl" in everyday life. I remember seeing an image of a European road sign pointing to "Perl". I think it was German, but I can't find it.</i> <br> <br>I can't help you with the road-sign (although I didn't look too closely), but a little wine village on the banks of the river Mosel is called Perl. They even have a <a href="http://www.perl-mosel.de/" title="perl-mosel.de">website</a perl-mosel.de> with a pretty emblem.

I once got a bottle of wine from "Perl" as a price for an obfuscation at the German Perl Workshop 2002. Unfourtunatly, I have neither the bottle nor an image of it. But maybe somebody from the GPW orgas can help..., I'll ask them..

I looked closer, but even some quality time with Google didn't bring up anything. I wonder what the look on the receptionist's face will be if I call the town hall and ask them if someone has a photo of the road sign.

Or rather, 5/6 of Apache is on the same road as Perl.  I guess the other 1/6 is dedicated to e-business.

<h2>CafÃÂ© Perl</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/BooK/">BooK</a> on 2005-01-18T08:24:20</h3>
<p>I have an ugly scan of a receipt from Caf&#233; Perl, in Lyon (where Lyon.pm meets). The receipt itself was given to me in 2000 (before Lyon.pm even existed) by a friend who knew I was interested in Perl and kept it for me. Note that the prices are in FRF, not EUR. I scanned it only a while later, which explains why it looks so... old.</p>
<p>Grab the shot at
<a href="http://paris.mongueurs.net/meetings/2001/cafeperl.jpg" title="mongueurs.net">http://paris.mongueurs.net/meetings/2001/cafeperl.jpg</a mongueurs.net>.</p>

The Caf&eacute; Perl has even a <a href="http://www.cafeperl.com/" title="cafeperl.com">website</a cafeperl.com>. That said, you should be able to scan a menu or something.

<h2>&quot;GDI&quot; or &quot;DBI&quot;</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/bart/">bart</a> on 2005-01-18T08:33:09</h3>
Good thing Tim Bunce didn't decide to actually call it "GDI", as that acronym is <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/winprog/winprog/graphics_device_interface.asp" title="microsoft.com">taken</a microsoft.com>, as the name for the group of drawing functions in the Windows API.
<p>But which was first? Windows' GDI probably already had that name in Windows 3.0 (<a href="http://www.computerhope.com/win3x.htm" title="computerhope.com">1990</a computerhope.com>) or Windows 3.1 (<a href="http://www.computerhope.com/win3x.htm" title="computerhope.com">1992</a computerhope.com>). I thought DBI's roots lie in 1994 &mdash; which is definitely not as old as Windows.</p>



<blockquote>

The GDI was in fact part of Windows 3.0.

<h2>Rue de la Perle</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/mir/">mir</a> on 2005-01-18T14:15:51</h3>
<p>I have a picture of the road sign "Rue de la Perle", in Paris, taken at YAPC::EU. Of course it's on my website at home, which is down while I am away. I'll send it to you next week.</p>



<h2>Amelia and PimB</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/muttley/">muttley</a> on 2005-01-18T18:13:30</h3>
I'm currently tending to Amelia so I'll try and get a photo of her sometime soon. I can also supply photos of the front and back of the original Perl is my Bitch tshirts, the sticker (which I thought I was given by Dave Adler at OSCon 2001 but memory may fail).<br/><br/>I've also got examples of the last London.pm tshirts  (which had logos for Sunnydale.pm, Rivendell.pm, Ankh-Morpork.pm, Tatooine.pm and ZZ9pluralZalpha.pm) as seen<br/><br/>    http://www.thegestalt.org/tshirts/<br/><br/>Also - The first ever London.pm meeting<br/><br/>http://london.pm.org/nx_meetings/1998_aug.shtml



<h2>As I recall, there were no blow-in cards</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/hfb/">hfb</a> on 2005-01-19T05:15:12</h3>
in the original first few TPJs. I don't think it was until they went to glossy format that the dreaded cards that fall everywhere began. I've got a picture of MJD's hairy ass from YAPC EU<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

Oh, yeah, I don't think they were in teh magazine.  Jon mentioned some in the O'Reilly Perl books, I think.  I don't know if I ever saw the fabled card myself.<br> <br>So what might you have, Elaine?  Anything history worthy rather than simply a curiousity?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
