<p><a href="http://use.perl.org/user/brian_d_foy/journal/36356">brian d foy asked people why they are passionate about Perl</a>. This is my reply to this question...<br />
<br />
<b>The person who introduced me to Perl showed me that...</b><br />
There was no person who introduced me to Perl. In my vocational training I worked for two different companys, both in the bioinformatics sector. In the first company I had to write a parser for files in a special format - and I had to use Java. In the second company they asked me if I can use Perl for the same kind of parser. I haven't heard about Perl until then. But I said that I'll have a look at Perl and give it a try. I was impressed that I can do the same job with less pain. The parser in Perl was shorter, faster and more robust.<br />
<br />
<b>I first starting using Perl to...</b><br /> do a lot of bioinformatics stuff.<br />
<br />
<b>I kept using Perl because...</b><br />Perl is the right thing for me. I feel good when using Perl and I get my jobs done. And the people in the bioinformatics department only knew Perl. There is BioPerl, a great bundle of modules for bioinformatics and it helped me a lot.<br />
Everyone knows that one of Perl's strengths is "text processing" and bioinformatics mean a lot of "text processing", so it was the right tool.<br />
<br />
<b>I can't stop thinking about Perl...</b><br />
Indeed, I think about Perl all the time. My jobs require Perl, and there is "<a href="http://perl-magazin.de">$foo</a>",...<br />
<br />
<b>I'm still using Perl because...</b>Perl is the right thing for me. I feel good when using Perl and I get my jobs done. It makes my life easier.<br />
<br />
<b>I get other people to use Perl by...</b><br />
talking to them. I show them how fast they can get solutions for their problems. CPAN to the rescue ;-)<br />
<br />
<b>I also program in ... and ..., but I like Perl better since...</b><br />
I also use PHP and Java, but there is no CPAN for PHP (ok, there is PEAR, but that is not as good as CPAN) or Java. I like that Perl is so flexible and much more...</p>

Glad to see you use it!  I'm currently toying around with perl6, so maybe a bioperl6 is down the not-so-distant road...
