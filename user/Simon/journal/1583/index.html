<p><A HREF="http://www.fsck.com/projects/rt/">RT</A> rocks. 
I can't believe how much RT rocks. RT really, really, rocks.
<P>
Here's a typical day for me. I get up. I log into my home
RT queue to see if there's any personal stuff I need to
do today - bills to pay, stuff I need to take to work, etc.
It's OK, because I can get at all the details from work
anyway, thanks to my DSL. Head into work. Log into my
work's RT system, look at the things I need to do today,
deal with tickets coming in from users, and so on.
<P>
Get home. Log into CPAN's RT system, handle any bugs in
my modules, and fire off responses to people lodging
bug requests. All the patches are there in RT, so I can
just copy and paste them into patch and I've got a release.
Check that into Perforce and we're good to go. I don't need
to make much of a Changes file, since I can just point
everyone at the tickets.
<P>
Log into perl.org's RT system and check out the status
of Parrot. Ideally, I'll have all the outstanding Parrot
patches in there too.
<P>
Next, I log back into my own RT system and check the Perl
queue, which has all the neato-keen Perl things I've thought
of and not got around to implementing. Stare at them. Fail
to get around to implementing them. Play quake and/or Go
instead.
<P>
RT: It doesn't make you more productive, but it certainly
makes you more organized.</p>
