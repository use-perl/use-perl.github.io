<h2>so does this mean</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/hfb/">hfb</a> on 2002-06-19T23:14:12</h3>
<p>That a photo featuring 'twin' breasts of a woman with the caption 'collapse into soft' will traumatise the entire population of the US? How utterly stupid and inane if people are working that hard to find sinister meaning in the most mundane of adverts.</p>

<p>I think we are being trolled in the classic sense.  Surely noone can be that misinformed.  Even if I was that misinformed, my first question would surely be, "Was there a second book, and what was its title?" directed at someone more knowledgeable than myself.</p>

<p>Stupid me.  I ask questions and try to understand things.</p>

<h2>Busted Neural Wiring</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/gizmo_mathboy/">gizmo_mathboy</a> on 2002-06-20T02:57:46</h3>
I must be wired extremely wrong because I didn't take offense to that ad or to the T-shirt the mimicked the I "heart" NY with a plane crashing into the N.<br> <br>I guess I saw it like a natural disaster. Really scarey but not much you could do about it. Then again I thought Mt St. Helens blowing up interesting and the Challenger disaster rather comical.<br> <br>Don't get me wrong I have empathy for the victims but lots and lots of people die everyday in non-spectacular ways and in just as great of numbers (just not so many all at once)<br> <br>Like I said I must have some really messed up mental wiring.



<h2>OLD NEWS</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/belg4mit/">belg4mit</a> on 2002-06-21T00:07:26</h3>
This was actually (AFAICT) originally brought up<br>oh about 2 weeks ago on Politically Incorrect.

You think Politically Incorrect is seen by everybody around the world, don't you?<br>

No but it did slip my mind that Simon<br>is in the UK. What without any extra<br>`U's in the posting<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-P<br> <br>That, and I don't exactly expect<br>information to take much real time<br>to propogate anymore.
