<p>So I've managed to pass on my Parrot pumpkin to Jeff Goff, and released 0.0.4 to the wind. Uh, world. As I'm now retiring from any status I have in the Perl community at large, I get more time to   play with other things. The most important things for me right now are to get a holiday, and to try and beat down this <A HREF="http://www.britgo.org/results/oxford02.html">stupidly high kyu rating</A>.<P><br/><br/>After that, of course, I still have a million and one things lined up. <A HREF="http://www.perl.com/">Perl.com</a> still keeps me looking out for the best Perl content I can find (Please send me article proposals!) and I still have the <A HREF="http://www.manning.com/">XS book</A> to finish off.<P><br/><br/>Then what? I'm currently working on compiling Perl 5 to <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/net/">.NET</A>. That's, uh, challenging. Someone has to write the Perl 6 compiler, and I suspect I may be involved in that at some stage. Maybe.<P><br/><br/>There are other small projects I shouldn't forget about. <A HREF="http://www.fsck.com/projects/rt/">RT</A>. <A HREF="http://www.reefknot.org/">Reefknot</A>, maybe. I want to write the <A HREF="http://simon-cozens.org/software/optimize.html">optimizer cookbook</A>, despite the fact that nobody seems interested in what it can do.<P><br/><br/>I want to do some <A HREF="http://developer.apple.com/macosx/">Mac OS X</A> programming, once I can find an idea that sufficiently itches that I'll scratch it. Maybe the <A HREF="http://www.isc.org/products/DHCP">DHCP</A> stuff. I want to run <A HREF="http://www.python.org">Python</A> on <A HREF="http://www.parrotcode.org">Parrot</A>. I want to learn <A HREF="http://www.ruby-lang.org">Ruby</A>.<P><br/><br/>I'm still going to be quite busy, but at least I'll be busy with <A HREF="http://www.britgo.org">stuff I want to do</A>, not stuff <A HREF="http://dev.perl.org">I'm expected to do</A>. So maybe, just maybe, one day, working on Perl might be <A HREF="http://www.ibiblio.org/Dave/Dr-Fun/latest.jpg">fun</A> again.</p>

Hey, don't say that nobody is interested in your pluggable optimizer, I do!
<p>
I hacked a bit B::Lint recently, and I thought that an optimizer-based perl lint would be fun. Another use I see is to extend perl, with or without the help of source filters: new special variables (e.g. a counter for foreach loops), etc. In brief, lots of perl 5 fun.</p>

<i>Are you saying that fobbing off the pumpkin renders you without Perl community status, or did retiring from Perl community status lead to fobbing off the pumpkin?</i>
<p>
The latter. I'm tired, far too busy, and want more time for myself. That said...

<i>I ask because there's a memory leak in Mail::Audit that I'd like to fix, and I'm unsure if I should be bugging you, or talking to Meng Weng Wong and module-authors about making sure this fine module doesn't get dropped.</i>
</p><p>
I've just written <code>Mail::Audit::Vacation</code> at last, since I now have use for it.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) (Flying out to Tunisia on Sunday, for a week of... well, finishing off my book, unfortunately. But at least I'll be doing it in the lap of luxury.) This means that I'll be collecting together all the patches to <code>Mail::Audit</code> since 2.1 and rolling out another release Real Soon Now. So please send a patch to me, or better, to the <a href="http://rt.cpan.org/" title="cpan.org">CPAN RT instance</a cpan.org>.</p>

<i>So please send a patch to me, or better, to the CPAN RT instance [cpan.org]. </i> <br> <br>Great, thanks.  Feel free to ignore the email I sent you a couple of weeks ago, as I subsequently filed a couple of replacement bugs with RT.<br> <br>Nat
