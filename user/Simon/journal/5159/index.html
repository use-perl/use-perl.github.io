<p>I've found a way to get around the broken headphone jack that's been screwing up sound in my laptop for the past few weeks. Since Darwin is open source, I've grabbed the code for the sound driver and hacked it to not mute the speakers if headphones are installed.
<P>
Unfortunately, I was running <A HREF="http://www.apple.com/macosx/newversion/">Jaguar</A> (you know, CD magically appeared on my desk, etc.) and had a bunch of problems insmod'ing the new kernel drivers due to incompatibilities. So I thought I might as well go back to OS X 10.1.3.
<P>
Unfortunately, OS X won't downgrade itself on install. So it was going to be a hard install. No problem, I wanted to churn up the disk anyway, since I only had 100M free and could do with getting rid of the cruft. 10G of MP3s went to a spare partition on a cow-orker's machine. (He's off sick, and I'll get them off before he notices. Heh, heh...) 1G of home directory stuff went onto my desktop; around 3G of cruft got deleted. Now, by my reckoning, that adds up to 14G.
<P>
I do the reinstall, trashing the filesystem, copy back the 1G of <TT>~simon</TT>, reinstall the applications that I use, and somehow there's 26G free. Something got away somewhere.
<P>
And for some reason, not only do I have more disk space, but the laptop's running much faster (maybe that was just Jaguar being slow, to be honest) and  even more bizarrely, I have much better Airport range at home.
<P>
There's obviously something tremendously therapeutic about newfs'ing your hard disk and starting again.
<P>
Still haven't got the speakers working, though.</p>
