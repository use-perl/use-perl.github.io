<div class="span8">
<p>Today, I almost entirely finished writing the 
embedding chapter of our new book. I suppose
"new" is a bit of an overstatement, since we're
supposed to have been working on this thing for
the best part of two years now. I'm confident
that - assuming I get some time (huh, huh) - we'll
have the manuscript delivered by the end of next
week.
<P>
Yesterday and Thursday I took two days off work,
ostensibly for writing, but I ended up going down
to watch the <A HREF="http://www.britgo.org/events/kisei2002/index.html">Kisei</A>
 title match in London. Now, some people might not
find it terribly exciting to watch two grown men
place stones on a piece of wood at the rate of 5
per hour, but it honestly was. This is because the
things that you don't see in a go game are far more
interesting than the things that get played; behind
each move, there are twenty or so lines that get examined,
refuted, rejected and re-examined. When you've got two
people playing each other who are both capable of that
kind of analysis, it makes for a very interesting game.
When every move is good, how do you win a game?
<P>
Afterwards, Piers and I went to the Gombei, for the usual
UTTERLY FANTASTIC food. And I found that they do <A HREF="http://www.bento.com/re_nabe.html">nabe</A>,
so I know what I'm having next time I'm there.
<P>
Now it's reached the point in the evening - 7pm - where
I have to decide whether or not I'm going to get any
more work done today. I suspect I'm not. So the rest
of the day will be dedicated to IRC, good beer (currently
the Caledonian Burns Ale, nice coffee flavours, almost a
porter) and general timewasting. See you tomorrow.</p>
