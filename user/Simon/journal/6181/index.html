<p><A HREF="http://www.oreillynet.com/user/rael/lang/perl/blosxom/">Blosxom</A> is lovely, and lets me take my blog <A HREF="http://blog.simon-cozens.org/">home</A>. So I'll be writing from there from now on. Oh, yes, and importing the use.perl blog into blosxom was quite fun. <P>
So, bye for now, hope you'll catch the blog at its new home - oh, and <CODE>Config::Auto</CODE> is out.</p>

<p>If everybody goes home, it will increase the work I need to do to get my daily dose of Perl Community goodness.<br> </p><p>It'd be neat to throw out Soap commands to post to the Journals here to parallel those you make on your Home blog.  There's an interesting feature.  Tagged categories in your own blog for automatic publication elsewhere...  Even automatically submitted to the front page of Use Perl; (or elsewhere) for consideration.  Hmmmm... you are an editor at Use Perl;, so you wouldn't have to get it approved, technically...</p>

I don't regularly go to other sites for "blogs".  Too much work.

I sync the Recent Journals list to my Palm every day when I go home. Then I read the journals on the subway on the way home. If people leave to go blogging elsewhere, I'm probably not going to bother syncing them.
<p>
So I guess a feature that would allow a user to specify another site as their journal/blog site and have the Recent Journals module keep track of the last-modified time would be helpful to me.
</p><p>Going a step further and indexing a user's external journal/blog would be helpful too.  Use.Perl could then be an aggregator of journal/blogs.  Then the Use.Perl community would journal/blog where they choose.</p>
