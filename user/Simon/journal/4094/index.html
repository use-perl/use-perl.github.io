<p><BLOCKQUOTE><I>
Well, I wake up in the morning, look at my clock,<BR>
It's way past noontime, now I'm late for work,<BR>
Tell me, tell me, what have I done wrong,<BR>
Ain't nothing go right with me,<BR>
Must be I've been smoking too long.<BR>
</I>
</BLOCKQUOTE><br/><br/>I have taken up smoking.
<P>
But, me being me, I don't smoke cigarettes. And unlike Nick Drake, it's not anything more sinister.<P>
I brought back from Tunisia two very nice water pipes. (<I>shisha</I>s) Relatively expensive, by Tunisian standards, and of very good quality. I also brought back, through customs, (with a little bit of fun) one pot of mint tobacco, one of strawberry, one apple, and one mixed fruit.
<P>
I used to smoke shisha quite regularly at college, and now I have my own. It's very aromatic, not as bad for you as most forms of smoking - the tobacco is quite natural, not full of chemical crap, and water cuts out a lot of what's left of the badness, and a pipe using a few grams of tobacco lasts around three or four hours - and, of course, it's wonderfully exotic.
<P>
The flat smells strongly of mint. Yum. <I>Exit stage left, pursued by de rigeur jokes about cavorting with hookahs.</I></p>

<h2>Effect on other people</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/pne/">pne</a> on 2002-04-11T10:07:27</h3>
At least with a setup the size of what I imagine water pipes to be, it's not something one tends to carry around with oneself wherever one goes.<br> <br>Said as by someone who's not particularly bothered whether anyone smokes, but whether they smoke *around me*. (Especially in places that are difficult to avoid, such as public transport or, to some extent, restaurants.)
