<p>Unfortunately, due primarily to my own fault, Parrot development has slowed down. This is because the whole
point of 0.0.3-to-be is that it will have PMCs, and I've promised to implement them, but am finding it amazingly difficult to find the time. This is the problem with the
ol' "day job" idea.
<P>
The day job, incidentally, is enjoyable, even if it does eat into all my hacking time. It's just the right mix of challenging programming tasks, new development, challenging sysadmin tasks, and sheer political wrangling. And working with cool people. I like. Today I've been writing a review daemon in Perl for Perforce, which I probably ought to release since it's quite extensible and rather powerful. This afternoon, I'm going to be setting up a new staff webserver, and then later on finishing off some perl.com stuff. 
<P>
Back to Parrot. PMCs are really pretty trivial, (hey, they're just SVs done right) but the clever bit is making the preprocessing framework around them so that they're easy to edit and maintain. Hopefully, I'll have some time for that tonight and Friday. However, I'm supposed to be going to a friend's party this weekend - at least I'll have time to hack on the train...</p>
