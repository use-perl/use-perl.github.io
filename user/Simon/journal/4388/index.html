<p>This is getting stupid now. I've got a
back-friendly chair. (One of those funky things
that you kneel on and it forces you to sit upright.)
I've got rid of the laptop and am using the desktop
at work. I'm taking regular breaks. It still hurts.
Guh. Time to go see the doctor. Right bloody now.</p>

Only thing I ever got from these is "knees ache", to go along with back, etc.  I didn't last long enough to even get used to it, sadly.<br> <br>Anyone else have luck w/ these?

I use one. It would hate to use it as my only desk chair; I prefer to trade off to it from my more traditional chair when I have had my butt planted for too many hours. Relieves fatigue and keeps me going.<p>A pleasant bonus is that new co-workers insist on casually plopping down on it backwards. The physics are all wrong, and they end up on the floor. They have taken to calling it my Scandinavian Death Chair. (No offense intended to any Scands.)</p><p>

yes, they are great.   It's easier to sit up straight on them.  It's much easier to be in some kind of movement.  Infinitely better than sitting still on a bad chair all day.  Sure, it can be harder for the knees; so you might want to keep some normal chairs around too.  Oh, and on the cool "knee chairs"[1]  you can actually sit backwards in funky ways too; it's fun. <br> <br>Simon, you are such a moron.  You do have RSI.  Get the books now.  NOW.  Did you see the doctor?  Did she say anything clued?  Check with the books if she did.  If not, find another doctor.<br> <br>
&nbsp; - ask<br> <br>[1] I only know the Stokke chairs; and of those I always liked the simplest (and cheapest) model best for that particular reason.
