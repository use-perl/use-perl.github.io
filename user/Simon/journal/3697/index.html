... who it was that thought capitals in a legal document would make people more inclined to read it.<br> <br>I tend to skip over those sections because they're so bloody hard on the eyes.<br> <br>Why do they do it?

At a past job, one day the Chief Incompetent was writing up a new
contract for future clients to sign, as part of their deal with the
company. Besides HAVING PARAGRAPHS in allcaps, he'd also write "seventy
(70)" instead of just "70". I asked him why he was going these things,
and he said "isn't that just the way it's always been done?".

<p>So apparently, people have weird (bad-weird) attitudes toward the law; weird pseudo-religious deference and distance and general ceremonialism of unknowing.</p><p>Another case in point: When a
distant relative of mine died, everyone in the family got copies of
various relevent legal documents in the mail. So I sat and read them.
When I mentioned this to others, they were astonished. They had always
just assumed that anything from a lawyer is no more intelligible
than microfiche in cuneiform.

</p><p>I've decided that if I ever become a sociopath, I
can be <a href="http://www.suck.com/daily/2000/02/22/daily.html" title="suck.com">a serial killer,</a suck.com> and if that gets dull and/or too messy, I can go whole hog
and become a lawyer.</p>
