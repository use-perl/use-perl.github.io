<p>Last night, I attended the emergency social meeting of London.pm. I don't often go to Perl Monger events, since they emphasise quite what's wrong with the Perl community - egotism, pedantry and ingratitude, writ large.<P>
But last night was special. The emergency was my leaving Perl development, and the meeting was apparently subtitled "Why Perl is f*cked".<P>
It's a pretty daunting task to go talk about such a subject to a Perl Mongers group. But it's a lot easier if they do the talking and you just agree. Some of the things we agreed on I don't want to go into in public - or even in private, sorry. Some points were quite interesting. Paul Makepeace talked about the lack of a J2EE-style application framework for common web application tasks. Amazing, given that we've got nearly a gig of CPAN, that we don't have a nice easy way to do stuff like registering a user for a web site and storing their email address. Why? Because there's too many ways to do it, so everyone does it their own way. Oh, and a lot more stuff, besides. I don't need to explain it. You know, deep down, don't you?
<P>
40 members of London.pm have formed London.class.

Simon said regarding Perl being F'ed:  "I don't need to explain it. You know, deep down, don't you?"

<p>Boy - I wish I did know.  You've said you aren't going to explain it more here but you've really got me wishing I was in London last night rather than Bristol...

</p><p>Anyone else want to explain?</p>

I'd love a pm group to go to but being in Burlington, VT the nearest one is a bit of a trek.
<p>
I got the urge to sit down over a few beers and talk geek stuff<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
</p><p>
p.s. why is the submit and preview buttons the wrong way round?</p>

<i>p.s. why is the submit and preview buttons the wrong way round?</i> <br> <br>They're fine.  You should preview before you submit, and the Preview button is on the right, in accordance with English left-to-right text orientation, with browser Back-Forward orientation, and for good measure with the <a href="http://developer.apple.com/techpubs/mac/HIGOS8Guide/thig-52.html#HEADING52-3" title="apple.com">Mac HI guidelines</a apple.com>.<br> <br>It's Windows that's the wrong way round.<br> <br>

<p>
Some people, it seems, have misinterpreted this to mean that I'm stopping Perl development (which, if you look back in my journal, isn't <i>amazingly</i> true, since I'll still be doing stuff. Lots of stuff.) because of the egotism, pedantry and ingratitude.
</p><p>
*sigh*. No, you've missed the point. I'm retiring because I don't have time to do the stuff that people expect me to do and I'd rather do the stuff I find fun when I can. I'm retiring because I'm knackered. I spent nearly two years working almost full-time on Perl hacking, to the possible detriment of my degree, and that's enough to tire anyone out.
</p><p>
The egotism, pedantry, and ingratitude is pretty much part of any community, and is irrelevant to the fact of my retiring. I just don't like it.
</p><p>
And to those who think I'm egotistical - what took you so long to work that out?</p>
