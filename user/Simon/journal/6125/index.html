<p>I got back from YAPC yesterday after a reasonably sleepless night flight. I was slightly suspicious to find my mail sorted and the kitchen tidied. But I was too tired to work out what was going on, so had a bath and forced myself into work, which was possibly a bad idea. I took the rest of the day to catch up with what's been going on here, and then returned home to find, yes, I had indeed acquired a housekeeper.<P><br/><br/>By way of explanation, a friend had been staying with someone who's since moved back to Japan; she then planned to move to Cheltenham, leaving her bags at my house for the time being. However, the Cheltenham idea also fell through and she was stuck in Oxford homeless. So she's staying with me for now.
<P><br/><br/>At the airport on the way back, I managed to get a lot more done on Shishi, and so I've released the prototype to CPAN; I've also got a reasonable stab at an approximate Perl 6 regular expression compiler which compiles to a shishi parser. Unfortunately, it's got to the point where it's really very difficult to build up the data structures that I need from a simple-minded tokenization of a Perl 6 pattern, and I'm left trying to bootstrap Shishi by hand-coding a parser. This is not fun.
<P>
This morning, we finished the 6 week Perl course I've been teaching. We did half the lesson on CPAN modules, looking primarily at the modules in my "10 modules" talk from YAPC. Of course, we got to a demonstration of <CODE>LWP::Simple</CODE> just as the demonstration web server was being upgraded, so I had to puzzle over why one person's code worked fine, but someone else's identical code a few minutes later didn't work. In the second half, people built a news ticker utility out of <CODE>LWP</CODE>, <CODE>Mail::Send</CODE> and dodgy screen-scraping regexes. Good fun, and I think people finished the course with an idea of how to do relatively complex things in Perl - given that the previous course got to subroutines and just abruptly ended, I think adding the modules lesson was a big improvement.
<P>
And now, after a flight, a bad night's sleep, and about three hours teaching, I'm utterly shattered.</p>

<p>
Are you going to post the slides from your 10 modules anywhere?  I'd like to see them, since I was only able to catch the last minute of that session...</p>
