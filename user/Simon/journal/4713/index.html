<p>Councils won't work with you if you get elected by the people, it's a "sad day" for the country if people vote for you, and if you get <B>really</B> popular, you get shot dead. And, of course, this democratic insanity is all your own fault. Right?</p>

<h2>could be worse</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Bumppo/">Bumppo</a> on 2002-05-07T19:50:33</h3>
As long as we're drawing sweeping conclusions from isolated events, it's still a better time to be a xenophobic and/or anti-semitic far-right-winger than it is to be a doctor performing abortions in the US.<br> <br>Fortuyn's murder is getting nearly zero coverage in the US, by the way.  An NYT search for his name turns up two stories not written by wire services.  I had to go look it up at the BBC before I knew what you were talking about (at first I assumed someone had killed Jean-Marie Le Pen, which would have made a bigger ripple).

<h2>Isolated events</h2>

I wasn't just talking about the murder, as I hinted by talking about councils not working with people and so on. I was talking about the 20% share of the vote for Le Pen, and the election of two BNP councillors in the UK; but then, I don't expect a USAian to have heard of those events either.
