<p>It is my New Year's Resolution to write my journal
every day, without fear or favour. So here we commence.
<P>
Staggering back from a NY party at Ray's in Iffley
Village, I asked the Lord if there was any special
New Year's message for me. And of course, there was.
Now, God's pretty cool, and He understands allusions
that make perfect sense to us. So what He said made
sense to me.
<P>
When I started to play Go, I asked some people in my
club what books should I read. The answer I got was
simple: James Davies' "Tesuji". And when you've read 
James Davies' "Tesuji", you read James Davies' "Tesuji" 
upside-down, James Davies' "Tesuji" sideways, and James 
Davies' "Tesuji" sideways and upside-down. Then you 
start again from the beginning.
<P>
This was a book I obviously ought to study much, much 
deeper if I wanted to get strong at Go.
<P>
So I asked the Lord what I should be doing to prepare
myself for 2002, and He responded by telling me to read
the ultimate guide to living in Oxford: that is, obviously, 
1 Corinthians. Then 1 Corinthians upside-down, 1 
Corinthians sideways, and 1 Corinthians sideways and 
upside-down. It's the way to understand how to approach
this town and what makes it tick. He's right.
<P>
Now, of course, I have to worry about finishing my book.
Tomorrow is going to be a day of much effort. Until then,
"Tesuji". Or 1 Corinthians, depending on who you work for.</p>
