<p>YAPC::NA this summer is going to be the last Perl conference I do for some time, so let's make it a good one. Here are the talks I have prepared; which do people think they'd like to hear, which should I write proposals for, and which would be better off turned into articles or just binned altogether:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Tutorials:<br/><br/><UL><LI>Perl For Systems Administrators - 3 hour tutorial
<LI>Perl 5 Internals - 3 hr. rerun from TPC5
<LI>Unicode and Perl - 3 hr. rerun from TPC5
</UL>
<LI>New talks:
<UL>
<LI>Bacman - A Distributed Backup System
<LI>optimizer.pm - Speeding up Perl the hard way
<LI>Mail::Miner - Finding stuff in that mass of mail
<LI>Parroting On - Lessons from the coal face
<LI>Perl 6 for Cats (5 min lightning talk.)
<LI>How To Write Bad Perl
<LI>Using and Customizing RT - 1.5 hour
<LI>The .NET You Need To Know
</UL>
<LI>Reruns from TPC 5:
<UL>
<LI>Mail::Audit - An introduction
<LI>10 Modules - I wouldn't go anywhere without
</UL>
</UL>
I'm sure I've got more than that, but I can't find them. :(</p>

  I won't be at YAPC so that my voice may not count, but here are those that I'd definitely like to see as articles (or in a conference, if that ever happens): Unicode and Perl (missed it last year), optimizer.pm, Mail::Miner, Parroting On, Using and Customizing RT, The<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.NET You Need To Know.
</p>

<p>
  As a sidenote, are you still on holiday or is it worth one sending you article proposals for perl.com?

Thanks for your ideas, Robin.<p><blockquote><div>

Think I'd be writing journal articles if I were in North Africa?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

Presentations I'd like to see, in order from most-prefered down. Note that I'll likely attend the lightening talks regardless, but I placed the LT at the end because if some other too cool talk conflicted, I doubt that any single lightening talk would convince me to miss the other too cool talk. I'm interested in Mail::Miner more than anything else on the list by about an order of magnitude (according to my recently-calibrated interestometer<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;) The others I'd love to see on the schedule, because I know I'm interested. Whether I attended would likely depend on what they run up against. I'd probably see Mail::Miner no matter what (well, unless you ended up scheduled against LW or DC).<br> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Mail::Miner - Finding stuff in that mass of mail<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Mail::Audit - An introduction<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Perl For Systems Administrators - 3 hour tutorial<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 10 Modules - I wouldn't go anywhere without<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; How To Write Bad Perl<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Perl 6 for Cats (5 min lightning talk.)<br> <br>The following I'd read if they were articles, agains listed in order from most-prefered on down...<br> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; optimizer.pm - Speeding up Perl the hard way<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Using and Customizing RT - 1.5 hour<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Parroting On - Lessons from the coal face<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Unicode and Perl - 3 hr. rerun from TPC5<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Perl 5 Internals - 3 hr. rerun from TPC5<br> <br>The following I probably wouldn't read even as articles, unless I was procrastinating<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) Nothing personal, they just don't fit my interests/needs at the moment...<br> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Bacman - A Distributed Backup System<br>

I'll be at YAPC so here's my listing:<br> <br>- Using and Customizing RT - 1.5 hour<br>- 10 Modules - I wouldn't go anywhere without<br>- Mail::Audit - An introduction<br>- Mail::Miner - Finding stuff in that mass of mail<br>- The<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.NET You Need To Know (more for my company than me, but hey that's life)<br>- Perl For Systems Administrators - 3 hour tutorial<br> <br>The rest I'm not sure how to rank, maybe toss in optimizer.pm?<br>
