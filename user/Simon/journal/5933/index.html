<p>23/7/2002 - St. Louis
<P>
Woke up too early, and wrote a Perl 6 regular expression engine. Don't
you just hate it when that happens?
<P>
At 6:30, I headed off to find some coffee, which was more of an ordeal
than I expected. The hotel's on the edge of quite a small town, and
nothing opens until at least 7am. Finally, I wandered down past
Concordia seminary, and found a lovely little cheap and tasty coffee bar
on the corner. I got my stuff together and around 8:30 I was ready to
head into St. Louis itself.
<P>
This town, as a famous man once said, is coming like a ghost town. St
Louis is a weird, weird place. The car culture has driven a few of the
usual things you'd expect to see in a city out to the suburbs. Basic
things like "shops" and "people". Until around noon today, there was
essentially nobody on the streets apart from me. (Granted, it was a
Sunday.)
<P>
Even when the city started to liven up, I couldn't help noticing, while
I was wandering around, that there wasn't really a central business
district. There were a few delis, pharmacies and 7/11s dotted around,
but not even so many of those. Instead, many of the downtown streets
were filled with empty buildings, boarded up doors and the shells of
long-dead shops. It was bizarre. Some of the most wonderful urban
architecture I've seen in a prime position in the city center was just
lying empty and forgotten. Even the St. Louis Center, a four storey
shopping and restaurant complex, hadn't really taken off. Many of the
units remained closed, and those which were let were not exactly
inspiring.
<P>
The only signs of real civilization were the Busch baseball stadium, -
complete with crowds of mourners for legendary baseball radio announcer
Jack someone-or-other - the old Union Station, - now a restaurant complex -
and the Gateway Arch - long queues and tight security. It took me half
the day to find somewhere which would sell batteries, and then I took
another few hours taking pictures of some of the great yet desolate
buildings I'd seen. Finally, an hour long trip on a Mississippi steamer,
before ordering a van ride back to the hotel. Then writing, writing,
writing.
<P>
The language barrier is turning out to be a problem. I ordered a
cheesesteak from the St. Louis Center when it finally opened, and was
startled to be asked by the server "Why do we pray?" Well, I wasn't
really in the mood for theological discussions, so I just shrugged. This
wasn't enough. "Why do we pray?" This a trick question, isn't it? The
server got agitated, and picked up two bags of rolls. "Why do we pray?"
<P>
Realisation dawned. "Oh, um, wheat, please."

<p>Shouldn't you be in San Diego on that date?</p>

Uh, yeah. So I don't know what month it is.
<p>
And no, I won't be in San Diego on that date.</p>
