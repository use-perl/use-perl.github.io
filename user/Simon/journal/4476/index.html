<div class="span8">
<p>I haven't written any songs for a while now, but when I used to write them quite regularly, the source for my best songs would be things I heard in my dreams. I used to wake up and sing to myself until I was sure I could remember the song. If I didn't do that, I would forget it, and another excellent song would be confined to oblivion.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I've got out of this habit, and so when I was woken up this morning by a really beautiful song, I thought "Ack, too early, I'll write it down later on when I get up". *poof* Gone. Damn.<br/><br/>What's particularly annoying is that I remember in my dream having to concentrate on that song because I had heard another song that wasn't quite so nice and I knew I wouldn't be able to remember both. Time to have a tape recorder by the bed again...</p>

Except that I would usually just jot down some lyrics and chords on paper, which would *usually* be enough to jog my memory later.
