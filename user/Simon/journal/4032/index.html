<P>
Seriously, it seems to be the topic <I>du jour</I>. Everyone else is mouthing off about use.perl censorship without knowing any of the facts involved, so it's my turn. Because obviously, right, Pudge and I are really bad at taking flames, (as it isn't like either of us have been flamed less than a million times each in our lives) and we nobble everyone who says anything against us. We're <B>that evil</B>.
<P>
Dave Cross's journal had a rant about censorship this morning. I can't find it now. Coincidence? <I>I THINK NOT!</I>
<P>
Quick to accuse, quick to paranoia and quick to bite the hand that feeds? You too can be a Perl programmer!</p>

<p>Before this all goes too far, it was <b>me</b> who deleted my journal entry. There's another entry there now with a vague explaination.</p>

Hmm. I'm going to have to keep more on top of journals. Just so that I can read them all before people delete them =)<br> <br>Thankfully, I'd looked at yours when the message came in that it had been posted - it had an interesting subject =)

There's a difference between questioning and accusing.<br> <br>And I ate my tasty humble pie.
