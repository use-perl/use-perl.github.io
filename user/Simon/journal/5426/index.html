<p>Damn, I love bank holidays. Not only did I get a lot of code and writing done, I also had plenty of time to relax. On Saturday night, we had the anime night - we watched Mononoke Hime, which was so long we didn't have time for anything else - and although the turnout was low, good fun was had by all.
<P>
 Sunday was spending shooting a video for Eiko, and then wandering around town. In the afternoon, we went and had a drink at Frevd's, then dinner at the Pink Giraffe. Finally, to the Angel and Greyhound, because they have a bar-billiards table, and bar-billiards is truly the game of kings.
<P>
 On Monday, got up early to go meet <CODE>pod</CODE> and Ray outside the Science Museum in London. The Museum has a fantastic IMAX film at the moment, taken from the International Space Station, talking about the astronauts' life and work up there. I think all of us left that wanting to go up into space... Afterwards, we met up with Alastair and his son Eugene, who's horribly cute. We got tickets for the Queen musical at the Dominion, and had lunch at a cheap vegan buffet place in Greek Street. The musical itself was much fun - a really, <B>really</B> tacky plot and worse dialogue, but plenty of naff jokes and good music, and a great atmosphere. <P>
Then Alastair met up with his wife, who I haven't seen in a good few years, and baby. They went off to the Palace to watch the concert, and we went to Belgo's to meet RDD and MBM for a few beers. After a nice Indian meal near Euston, we came back.
<P>
Tuesday was pretty lazy, and I couldn't really get in the mood to program, so I went and spend lots of cash on Borders, picking up some great CDs - Bert Jansch, John Martyn, Dinah Washington, and Eddi Reader, as well as some chill-out stuff. Did manage to get a bit of coding done, working on my Internet banking module, and <CODE>Games::Goban</CODE>. Oh, and then played go.
<P>
I woke up at 5am this morning, though, for some reason, and came into work; this was a good idea, since it meant I got lots of work on <CODE>Games::Goban</CODE> done - this is nearly finished now, apart from some of the "hard" routines like displaying, saving as SGF and inserting a new move.<P>
Still, after such a nice break, it's back to screwing around with XSP. Yum.</p>
