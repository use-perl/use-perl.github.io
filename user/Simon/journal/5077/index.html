<p>I really have turned into <A HREF="http://www.popmatters.com/film/fight-club.html">Ikea Boy</A>. I've noticed that some of the books I've been buying recently are there not to be read, but to sit on the table and look cool. Example: <A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0714834491/ref%3Dpd%5Fsim%5Fbooks/002-6510599-7458411">The Art of Looking Sideways</A>. A nice design book, and certainly very interesting, but let's admit it, it's there for the "ooh shiny" factor.
<P>
 <A HREF="http://www.januarymagazine.com/artcult/pad.html">Pad</A> is excellent fun, but dammit, I'm not going to be redecorating my house any time soon.
<P>
I'm not sure whether or not <A HREF="http://www.sccs.swarthmore.edu/users/00/pwillen1/lit/citysum.htm">Invisible Cities</A> counts, since it doesn't have any pictures. My <A HREF="http://www.adbusters.org/">Adbusters</A> subscription definitely counts, which is a shame since I really <B>do</B> actually read it. 
<P>
Anyway, I was extremely tempted to buy another one today - <A HREF="http://shop.store.yahoo.com/harvarddesignbooks/2hardesschoo.html">Project on the City 2</A>, the Harvard design school's guide to shopping and shopping centers - but then I realised that I had taken a step too far, and I saw the book for what it was: pretentious <A HREF="http://www.martian.fm/artfucos.htm">artfucko</A> Ikea-boy coffee-table wank.
<P>
Maybe I'll get it next week.</p>

<em>My Adbusters subscription definitely counts, which is a shame since I really do actually read it.</em>
<p>I think about one issue a year of <cite>Adbusters</cite> is all that's worth reading.  More than that, and you risk suffocating in the soft-headed Vancouverish nimbus of self-satisfaction that's no more thoughtful than <cite>TV Guide</cite>, and considerably less pleasant.
</p><p>So I cancelled my subscription to <cite>Adbusters</cite>.  I'm tempted to replace it with a subscription to <cite> <a href="http://www.benetton.com/colors/" title="benetton.com">Colors</a benetton.com> </cite>.  Plus, it's fun to compare the Spanish and English translations.
</p><p>I think <cite>Adbusters</cite> would be great if they simply got rid of all the blathering text.  The (fake) ads and other photo stuff speaks for itself.  More than that is just harping.</p>

<p>What I wonder is why on signs I've seen in restaurant restrooms the English-speaking employees are told to wash their hands before returning to work, while the Spanish-speaking employees are told to wash their hands after using the bathroom.  I guess English speakers don't have to wash if they go directly home after the last trip of the day.</p>

It's a class thing.  The anglos can go grab a bite and/or smoke before returning to work, while the hispanics, typically mere bus-boys, get no such slack.<br> <br>Maybe.<br>
