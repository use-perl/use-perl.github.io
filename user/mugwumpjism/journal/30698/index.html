<div class="span8">
<p><p>After the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID">ACID</a>
revolution of the 1960s, Relational Database Design was the next big
thing during the late 60's and 70's.  It marked an evolutionary step
forward from the Heirarchical models of early ACID conformant systems;
for after all, it <em>included</em> the heirarchical model, as any
heirarchy can be expressed as relationsÃÂ¹, yet <em>transcended</em> it
by expressing structures that didn't fit heirarchies.

<p>And it has some solid theory behind it as well - the relational
model has strong roots in mathematics and logic, and so you can expect
that University-goers will be poring over it with a bit more scrutiny
and peer review than your average <tt>use.perl.org</tt> columnist.

<p>Through all this, we have a decent set of experience for looking at
data management problems through the goggles of the Relational Model,
of which modern Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS's)
provide a reasonable approximationÃÂ².  We have built it up logically
with key concepts such as <em>constraints</em>, <em>sequences</em>,
<em>triggers</em>, <em>joins</em>, <em>views</em>, <em>cursors</em>,
etc, and well-known performance hacks such as <em>indices</em>,
<em>partitioning</em> or <em>materialized views</em>.  And this
logical layering is what allows us to build complex RDBMS's and
database applications that do not violate the strict requirements of
ACID.  Well, some of us, some of the time.  I won't say it's easy to
do it without making mistakes.

<p>We have a set of rules that let you decide whether data in the
model is <em>normalized</em> - that is, it is not duplicated or
aggregating any other information in the database, or
<em>de-normalized</em>.  We should be able to look at a table, and
decide whether that <tt>auto_increment</tt> primary ID key is actually
a normalized and valid member of the model (such as a customer or
invoice number), or whether it is just a surrogate ID thrown on the
row so that the programmer doesn't have to guess whether
<tt>table.id</tt> exists or not, that does not actually <em>mean</em>
anything in terms of the data model.

<p>We have a graphical language of notation, called <em>crowfoot
diagrams</em> (<a
href="http://utsl.gen.nz/img/crowfoot.png">example</a>).  And this is
a very good common language.

<p>We even have Relational abuses such as <em>stored procedures</em>
and <tt>NULL</tt> valuesÃÂ².

<p>But we want a common language for writing Perl components, not just
how for talking to DBAs or writing database schema.  We cannot write
entire applications in SQL.  And nor do we want to.

<p><strong>What defines "Database Abstraction"?</strong>

<p>For the heritage for this term, we can look to Dave Rolsky's <a
href="http://poop.sourceforge.net/">POOP Comparison</a> document.
POOP stands for <b>P</b>erl <b>O</b>bject-<b>o</b>riented
<b>P</b>ersistence, and stands out as one of the worst acronyms for a
user group ever.

<p>So, "Database Abstraction" is my own refactoring of the term
"RDBMS/OO Mapper" from the above document.  Modules such as <a
href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/DBIx-Class"><tt>DBIx::Class</tt></a>
and Dave's <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Alzabo">Alzabo</a>
clearly fit into this category.

<p>Allow me to hazard some key characteristics of modules strictly in
this category;

<ol>

<li>they (in principle) do not have particular requirements on table
layout, such as surrogate IDs or type indicators

<li>they do not try to represent or provide concepts not described by
orthodox relational model literature, such as inheritance

</ol>

<p>Perhaps I'll think of some others as time progresses; I'll try to
add them here if I do.

<p><strong>What's so cool about DBIx::Class</strong>

<p>In a nutshell, it does the Database Abstraction part very well,
with a clean modular implementation via <a
href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Class-C3/"><tt>Class::C3</tt></a>.
Which isn't quite as chic as <a
href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Moose"><tt>Moose</tt></a>, but close
enough that it's probably not worth re-writing <tt>DBIx::Class</tt> in
the near future.  It has active maintainers, it has releases, it has
users, it has mailing lists and IRC and all those other indicators of
projects which are "succeeding".

<p>One thing I particularly like about its API is <a
href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/DBIx-Class/lib/DBIx/Class/ResultSet.pm"><tt>DBIx::Class::ResultSet</tt></a>.
In particular, the way that you don't get <em>tables</em> from your
schema, you get <em>result sets</em> that happen to be for
<em>all</em> objects.  What's more, they don't actually run the query
until you use them, which makes for easy piecely building of simplish
queries.

<p><strong>Driving the Perl Objects from the Database Schema</strong>

<p>One of the most popular <tt>DBIx::Class</tt> extensions, which I
also think is pretty nifty, is <a
href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/DBIx-Class-Schema-Loader/"><tt>DBIx::Class::Schema::Loader</tt></a>.
This actually connects to a database, uses DBI's various interfaces
for querying the table structure in about as DB agnostic a way as you
could imagine a tool of its class doing, and then calls the relevant
<tt>DBIx::Class</tt> hooks to create classes which are a reasonable
representation of what it found in the database.

<p>For those people who are adamant that best practices be strictly
followed, and normalization guidelines honoured, this works very well
- and it sure is a delight when you have an application with a
database clean enough for this to work without tweaking the schema.
Then again, those developing applications from scratch might prefer
writing in <tt>DBIx::Class</tt> directly.

<p><strong>What's the model of your model?</strong>

<p>In all of the above scenarios, but particularly with the
<tt>Loader</tt>, the <em>model</em> (ie, schema) of your database has
a <em>meta-model</em> (ie, governing schema form).  It is a very close
relative of the Data Definition Language, DDL - <tt>CREATE TABLE</tt>
statements and so-on that tell the database what to do.  And that is
perhaps key to the success of <tt>DBIx::Class</tt> and perhaps all
other modules that work like this - they piggy back on the success of
the relational model.

<p>It should be noted that the <tt>DBIx::Class</tt> meta-model is
currently <em>implicit</em>; there is, for instance, a
<tt>DBIx::Class::Schema</tt> module that lets you create objects for a
model, but they just go ahead and make the classes immediately rather
than a separate step.  The closest thing I could find to a pure set of
data structures that represent the schema was probably
<tt>DBIx::Class::Schema::Base</tt>, but even that had the "side
effect" of compiling the classes into Perl as the schema is
constructed.

<p>But that's not necessarily a harsh critique of a real problem.  As
an exercise, and for a RAD (Rapid Application Development) tool I was
writing at the time to procrastinate from building a real application
for a VC project, I developed a set of modules for Tangram called <a
href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/T2">T2</a> that described the
Tangram meta-model using the <a
href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Class-Tangram">Class::Tangram</a>
meta-model.  I later found myself wanting to do the same thing to
<tt>Class::Tangram</tt> itself - that is, have <tt>Class::Tangram</tt>
re-entrantly be its own meta-model.  Other people have tried this sort
of thing, too - Kurt Stephen's UMMF, David Wheeler's Class::Meta, etc.
Metamodelling really amounts to the data modeller's equivalent of
navel gazing - ie fruitful but only with good practice and a clear mind.  I admire Stevan Little's accomplishment with <a
href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Class-MOP">Class::MOP</a> in this
regard, which is why I didn't cut my Moose talk.

<p>But I digress.  Why don't I summarise the usage scenarios where I
think the <em>Database Abstraction</em> approach really wins.

<p><strong>Summary - Where Database Abstraction Wins</strong>

<p>There we go, large heading and everything.  I have observed
Database Abstraction to be effective, both in my own practice but more
in others, in two situations:

<dl>
<dt><em>Well designed</em> models
<dd>
If the information has been modelled well using classical set theory
notions, and those notions are adequate for the task at hand and
little denormalization present in the data, then any approach that
ends up getting to <tt>DBIx::Class</tt> classes will work well.
</dd>
<dt><em>retro-fitting</em> existing models
<dd>
The <tt>DBIx::Class::Schema::Loader</tt> wins here.  You already have
a set of tables, you've defined your foreign keys properly using
constraints and what-not, and it's not just a bunch of integer id
keyed data dumping grounds, so just go ahead and load it all using a
set of clearly-defined conventions.
</dd>
</dl>

<p>Right, time to collect a free meal for my delayed flight, then I'll
have a crack at part 2.

<p>Footnotes:

<ol>

<li>Yes, querying heirarchies in SQL sucks and usually relies on
vendor-specific extensions which are inflexible and not portable.  We
will get to this a bit more in part 2 hopefully.

<li>Insert long rant about <tt>NULL</tt> values and duplicate rows
here.

</ol>
