<div class="span8">
<p><p>As described in the previous post in this series, Subversion is a
great way for people to collaborate on projects together using a
central server.

<p>However Subversion, being chiefly designed largely as a stable and
clean replacement for CVS, had some somewhat peculiar design decisions
made along the way.  One of them was the implementation of
"disconnected operations".  Being an inherantly centralised system, it
only had a few operations which would work disconnected, such as
<tt>status</tt>, <tt>diff</tt>, and anything else that didn't have to
save to the central depository.  A major annoyance was the way that it
achieved this - by keeping the repository versions of files as full
copies at every directory level, using the apologist line "disk is
cheap".  This meant that any given checkout was guaranteed to be twice
the size of the files checked out, and everything from '<tt>grep
-r</tt>' to tab completion were interfered with by these <tt>.svn</tt>
directories littered everywhere.  It was only slightfully less hateful
than CVS in that regard.  Not only that, but there were still core
operations that couldn't be performed disconnected, such as
<tt>commit</tt>.

<p><strong>Enter SVK</strong>

<p>In September 2003, Kao Chia-liang aka <tt>clkao</tt> decided that
he wanted disconnected operation to be a bit smarter.  Instead of
keeping the server-side versions of files separately per-checkout, SVK
will mirror revisions from the remote Subversion repository in a local
Subversion repository (or 'depot') in your <tt>~/.svk</tt>.  The
guaranteed availability of a local repository meant that you did not
need to keep lots of files in every checkout path - in fact, SVK
checkouts are <em>spotless</em>.  The only way you can even tell a
directory is a checkout is because of information in
<tt>~/.svk/config</tt>.

<p>SVK tool the general Subversion CLI look and feel, and introduced
some new keywords as were required for the new operations that this
approach allowed you to do; so, now you have terms like
<tt>mirror</tt> to tie a reference to a remote repository to a local
SVK path, <tt>sync</tt> to fetch revisions from a remote repository,
<tt>smerge</tt> or "source merge" to copy revisions or changes from
one path to another within a repository, <tt>pull</tt> to fetch and
merge from the centre, and <tt>push</tt> to copy revisions back
towards the centre.  "Centre" in this case meaning the Subversion
repository which the other branches stem from.

<p>SVK puts little cookies in subversion properties to track this
information, called "merge tickets" - though sadly, a consequence of
the design is that these tickets must refer to the UUID and revisions
in <em>your</em> SVK depot - making them quite useless to anyone
without a copy of itÃÂ¹.

<p><strong>SVK and development team interaction</strong>

<p>SVK suits the "star merge" pattern of distributed developers well.
"Star Merge" refers to a set of distributed repositories, all merging
back to a central server that holds the master copies of each branch.
People are expected to make branches within this repository to precede
each new chains of development or for "release" branches, and within a
single one of these branches, you are expected to keep up to date and
only ever commit back based on what the latest version of a particular
file is.

<p>A logical extension of this is that SVK also supports the "tree
merge" pattern well.  People can share their SVK depots via
Subversion, and so long as people are not allowed to commit to
"mirrored" paths within the depot, they can safely form another star
of committers around the secondary depot.  The flow of commits then
becomes an <em>acyclic graph</em> or <em>tree</em>.

<p>SVK fixes a key design flaw in Subversion - the <a
href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/nightly/en/svn.branchmerge.copychanges.html#svn.branchmerge.copychanges.bestprac.track">indecent
punting on attempting automatic merge tracking</a>.  Being written in
Perl, more advanced user interface features have been added -
including <em>interactive commit</em>, a <tt>darcs</tt>-bourne system
of guiding the developer through generating high quality change sets,
and integration with over 13 different merge tools.  These features
are a boon for committing to a project using Subversion - You could
say that SVK has moved the Subversion approach an evolutionary step
forward, - and as a result, for those familiar with Subversion
already, <tt>SVK</tt> offers a big advantage and few downsides for
virtually every normal application of the Subversion client.

<p>Footnotes:

<ol>

<li>This flaw is visible by running `<tt>svn pg svk:merge
http://svn.openfoundry.org/pugs/</tt>' - note how the merge tickets
are relative to repository UUIDs, paths and revisions that cannot be
converted to a local repository number.
