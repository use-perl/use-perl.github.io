<h1>Database - Slave or Master?  2 of 3 - Object Persistence</h1>

<div class="span8">
<p><p>One of the coolest things about "Object Persistence", is that it
has the word "Object" in it, which of course means better than
anything that was around before "Object Oriented Programming" was
decided to be flavour of the decade.  Even better than that, it even
has the word "Persistence" in it, which sounds much more sophisticated
and modern than "Database" or "Relational".

<p>Then are shiny tools in this space, like Hibernate for Java.  Using
Hibernate, you can make an Enterprisey Macchiato Java Servlet that
blends your database to a set of Java objects, and then provides
Soaped-up Beany Hyper-galactic XML Web services for other parts of
your Enterprisey code base to access.  It's fantastic - you end up
with a set of tables (all with surrogate IDs, of course) that you are
guaranteed to not be able to write to safely from anything except the
Java Server.  This puts the Java developer in control.  Which is the
way (s)he likes it.  Maybe hibernate doesn't have to work like this,
but (s)he prefers it because it means that all the changes to the
objects have to go through the same central set of functions.
Otherwise, the development investment is wasted.  And we can't have
that, not at the price it cost.

<p>Anyway, Tangram is not quite so antisocial as that.  It at least
behaves transactionally, given appropriate use of <a
href="http://search.cpan.org/user/samv/Tangram-2.10/lib/Tangram/Storage.pod#unload_all(_%5B_%24notify_method_%5D)"><code>$storage-&gt;unload_all</code></a>
(also <tt>-&gt;recycle</tt>) and distribution of clue.  But it is
currently anti-social in other ways, such as the surrogate ID
requirement.

<p><strong>Wait a minute - the database has .oids, too</strong>

<p>Postgres, and Oracle, both have a concept of <tt>.rowid</tt>; all
tables except for 'index organised tables' have them by nature.  I
have observed that in the vast majority of code that uses the Tangram
API, I never need to use or refer to this <tt>.id</tt>; in fact, when
storing an object in multiple stores, its <tt>.id</tt> will vary
across those stores.  In light of this, while I consider surrogate IDs
a design flaw - it's not a tragic one, it's consistent with what the
database does anyway, and it has allowed for interesting patterns to
be built in the mean-time while better ideas come forth.  For a more
detailed analysis of what I think is wrong with Tangram, see the <a
href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Tangram/lib/Tangram/Sucks.pm">bugs
POD file</a> in the Tangram distribution, especially the <a
href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Tangram/lib/Tangram/Sucks.pm#tables_without_a_type_column">section
on surrogate type columns</a> (actually I've just tidied those up, if
you're reading this before I make a release then read the fresh one <a
href="http://utsl.gen.nz/gitweb/?p=Tangram;a=blob;h=cc70b396;hb=doc-updates;f=lib/Tangram/Sucks.pm">here</a>).

<p><strong>What defines "Object Persistence"?</strong>

<p>Again, hazarding a set of common features of object persistence
tools that could plausibly form part of a definition;

<ol>

<li>They normally <em>do</em> have requirements of the database;
usually not all valid DDL models can be mapped to a set of objects.

<li>They will map features of objects not usually considered
relational concepts such as inheritance and Perl structures like
Arrays and Hashes.

</ol>

<p><strong>What's so cool about Tangram</strong>

<p>The key design feature of Tangram is what is frequently referred to
as being <em>orthogonal</em> - it is normally non-intrusive on the
objects being stored.  A given object may even exist in multiple
stores simultaneously (but be represented by the same Perl object).
The result?  Classes do not need to be aware of their storage; any
more than a tuple needs to know it's being stored in a table space.

<p>This is implemented with <em>Lazy Loading</em>.  The in-memory data
structure is considered equivalent to the database form; via types
such as <a
href="http://search.cpan.org/user/samv/Tangram/lib/Tangram/Type/Set/FromOne.pod">Tangram::Type::Set::FromOne</a>,
it is possible to follow joins between tables by just walking Perl
objects with visitor iterators like <tt>Data::Dumper</tt>.

<p><strong>Tangram Querying</strong>

<p>For the cases where you have specific questions for your data
model, and you are not just following adjacent relations between
objects, lazy loading is not enough.  We still need some form of query
syntax.

<p>For this, Tangram uses <a
href="http://search.cpan.org/user/samv/Tangram/lib/Tangram/Expr.pod"><tt>Tangram::Expr</tt></a>
objects that represent <em>database objects</em> - and they use
<tt>overload</tt> so that you can write your query expressions using
standard perl operators (as far as <tt>overload</tt> allows).
Depending on your inclination, you either "run screaming" from this
syntax or love it.
 
<p>In my experience, Tangram's query syntax makes some previously hard
queries easy, and some "impossibly difficult" queries easy.  You can
build intricate joins with a consistent notation.  For example,
process a form, make a list of <tt>Tangram::Expr</tt> fragments, and
then combine them into a filter that can be used for multiple queries.

<pre>
  # get the table aliases
  my ($r_artist, $r_cd, $r_track)
      = $storage->remote(qw(Artist CD Track));

  # build a set of filter expressions - some of these
  # represent joins.
  my @filters =
      ( ( $r_artist->{name} eq "The Black Seeds" ),
        ( $r_cd->{artist} == $r_artist ),
        ( $r_cd->{tracks}->includes($r_track) ),
        ( $r_track->{name} eq "Heavy Mono E" )      );

  # AND them all together
  my $filter = reduce { $a & $b } @filters;

  # then use them for queries
  my (@cds)    = $storage->select( $r_cd, $filter );
  my (@tracks) = $storage->select( $r_track, $filter );
</pre>

<p>The query there is already getting reasonably impressive; the first
<code>-&gt;select()</code> maps to:

<pre>
 SELECT
    t1.id,
    t1.type,
    t1.artist_id,
    t1.name
 FROM
    CD t1,
    Artist t2,
    Track t3
 WHERE
    t1.artist_id = t2.id         AND
    t2.name = "The Black Seeds"  AND
    t3.cd = t1.id                AND
    t3.name = "Heavy Mono E"
</pre>

<p>This is a simple example, and I have found that there are very few
real queries on well designed schema that do not map to this syntax
well.  That being said, sub-selects require an undocumented syntax,
and while I have some sympathy to the notion that you should be able
to write sub-selects as joins most of the time, it's certainly an
example that the API hasn't been extended in all directions yet.

<p><strong>Tangram Maps Inheritance</strong>

<p>There are those that would say inheritance is about a relational a
concept as an <tt>.mdb</tt> file, but I think that there is adequate
justification for its use in data modelling.

<p>A good question to ask when validating a relational schema to be
normal form, is "what does this relation <u>mean</u>?" or "what fact
is being represented by this tuple?".  We can ask this question for
all tables - and the basic answer is "there exists an object with
these values"ÃÂ¹.  The fact is that the object exists.  Better answers
can be made for individual tables; consider that answer a template -
ask a meta-question, get a meta-answer.

<p>This is where the argument for inheritance stems.  The relations
still describe existence of an object, but certain types of objects
will have extra items in their tuple - relations to the extra
properties bestowed upon them by their sub-classes.

<p>In the <a
href="http://search.cpan.org/src/SAMV/Tangram-2.10/t/musicstore/MusicStore.pm">CD
store schema</a>, for instance, 'Artist', 'Person' (perhaps better called
'Musician') and 'Band' are related like this.  The justification is,
that an artist can be either a musician or a band, but if we are
relating to something in its capacity as an artist (ie, from the CD
table, to say who released it), there also exists by association a
relationship between the CD and all of the properties of the artist in
its capacity of a musician or a band.

<p>Tangram short-cuts the query overhead of this situation using a
'<tt>type</tt>' column.  The type column is an index into the schema,
and is used to derive a bitmap of which extra tables associated with a
base class are expected to have rows for this primary key.  This is a
de-normalization of data, so technically a hack - as noted on
<tt>Tangram::Sucks</tt>, it should be possible to detect the type
using the presence or absence of tuples in the corresponding tables.
Or, somewhat equivalently, <tt>NULL</tt>s when using "Horizontal"
mapping - see <a
href="http://search.cpan.org/user/samv/Tangram-2.10/lib/Tangram/Relational/Mappings.pod"><tt>Tangram::Relational::Mappings</tt></a>
for a description of these terms).  I'm told that David Wheeler's <a
href="http://search.cpan.org/user/dwheeler/Object-Relation/"><tt>Object::Relation</tt></a>
can work like this.

<p><strong>But what about the Schema?</strong>

<p>Having a schema structure that is <em>free from side-effects</em>
can be quite useful.  Tangram has this down well; its input is a plain
set of perl hashes and arrays, no side effects.  If you want to use
the pure objects to create code, you can still pass them to
<tt>Class::Tangram::Generator</tt>.  If you want to connect to
storage, pass to <tt>Tangram::Storage</tt>.  <a
href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/T2">T2</a> was my attempt at making
a set of objects that can both describe this Tangram model
relationally, and itself be stored in a Tangram database.  This is
useful for building <em>rapid application development</em> /
<em>Computer-Aided Software Engineering</em> (RAD / CASE) tools.
Consider <a href="http://uml.sourceforge.net/">Umbrello</a>; it could
not compile classes as the objects were manipulated, otherwise you
might override internal behaviour and break the running program!

<p><strong>You don't have to write comprehensive schemata any
more</strong>

<p>Consider the package manager, <a
href="http://fink.sourceforge.net/">Fink</a>.  Whilst using
<tt>Storable</tt> for persistence can make applications like Fink
faster by reducing parse time to load their entire state at start-up,
it is still not as fast as a Berkeley, ISAM or SQLite-style database
which is loaded on demand for small accesses.<br />

<p>The general approach is not making the whole schema relational in
one go, but instead cherry-picking out the columns that you think are
useful enough to be indexed, and throwing the rest into a single
column that contains a <tt>Storable</tt>, <tt>Data::Dumper</tt> or
even <tt>YAML</tt> data field which is used to construct the rest of
the object.  <a
href="http://search.cpan.org/user/samv/Tangram/lib/Tangram/Type/Dump/Any.pm"><tt>Tangram::Type::Dump::Any</tt></a>
is built for this.  I wrote a Tangram schema for Fink that does this,
which is <a href="http://utsl.gen.nz/fink/">lurking here</a>.<br />

<p>You end up with a data source which can be queried on all mapped
columns, and almost all close that was written for the old,
non-Tangram system works too - because previously, the only option was
to follow Perl references, but we've made sure they all get lazy
loaded.

<p><strong>Where Object Persistence Wins</strong>

<dl>
<dt><em>RAD-developed, and imported models</em>

<dd>In the RAD case, the model for your program is developed with a
tool; the relational mapping is then derived by mutating the generated
model.<br />

In the imported case, it comes from the metamodel of an another
module, such as <tt>Class::Tangram</tt> or <tt>Class::Meta</tt>.<br />

In both of these cases, a general form of translation is "all that is
required" - write a few rules about how to convert from one metamodel
to another, and you have automatic Object Persistence.  Sadly this
"all that is required" part can get quite difficult to understand and
debug.

<dt><em>retro-fitting storage around existing objects</em>

<dd>This works out best when you have code that already stores via
something like <tt>Storable</tt>, and hasn't been written relationally
in the first place, just like Fink.

</dl>

<p>Yes, I know this is another absurdly long post in a multipart
series.  That's actually mostly in this case because I have more to
say about it, rather than being a particular endorsement of the
approach.  But more on what I <em>will</em> endorse in the next part.

<p>Footnotes:

<ol>

<li>Yes, I know there is a widely circulating school of thought saying
"that's not The Right WayÃ¢âÂ¢ to do object-relational mapping, you should
be using object values as <em>columns</em> and tuples as <em>object
relations</em>".  The former isn't available in current databases, and
the latter is done using classes that consist only of foreign keys
(<tt>Tangram::Type::*::FromOne</tt> relations).

</ol>

While I don't currently use Tangram, I always found the filter syntax and the inheritance support really impressive.  It makes for a fun read.
