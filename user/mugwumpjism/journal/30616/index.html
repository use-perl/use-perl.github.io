<div class="span8">
<p><p>With the shining review of <tt>git</tt> just posted, it seems there would be
little ground left for other tools to show distinction.

<p>However I respect and admire <a
href="http://www.darcs.net/DarcsWiki/FrontPage">darcs</a> on several
grounds, and there are still clear and useful development interactions
for which <tt>darcs</tt> has an advantage over all current <tt>git</tt> porcelainÃÂ¹.

<p><strong>It's also properly distributed</strong>

<p>Firstly, it should be noted that almost all of the distributed
development advantages of <tt>git</tt> also apply to <tt>darcs</tt>.
<tt>darcs</tt> also uses a single directory for its repository, so
'<tt>grep -r</tt>' is ok from sub-directories, and like <tt>git</tt>, it keeps
these repositories with the checkouts so you can freely move and copy
your checkout directories without worrying about using special
commands or updating some mapping file in an obscure location in your
dotfiles.

<p><tt>darcs</tt> has not been scaled to massive projects, instead
focusing on smaller ones (say, a few thousand commits), where the
extra functionality is considered more important than speed.  That
being said, in fact you'll see in newer <tt>darcs</tt> repositories
the first traces of content hashing, which have made drastic
improvements - and could eventually render <tt>git</tt>'s performance edge
marginal.

<p><strong>The (in)famous Patch Calculus</strong>

<p>Patch Calculus has to be one of the most frighteningly named terms
used in revision control systems today.  It screams "Maths to
University Level required to understand".

<p>But let's throw away the awful term and describe it in plain Geek.
Basically it's all about ways of determining, from a set of possibly
unrelated patches, which extra patches are required for any given
"cherry pick".  I much prefer terms like <em>Patch Dependency</em> to
refer to this set of concepts.  Even <tt>darcs</tt>' term <em>patch
commuting</em> could be better called <em>patch re-ordering</em>.

<p>The theory goes like this.  If you are trying to get a specific
change from a tree, then quickly work out by examining the history
which other changes are required first, and so add all of those
patches to your tree.

<p>The general finding from this technology is that it is useful, but
it opens a big can of worms.  In essence, the version control system
is tracking not only the history that you recorded, but also all the
different paths through the patches you have made that history might
have successfully progressed.  And on any code base, simple metrics
such as "does this patch apply cleanly" cannot be relied upon to
verify whether or not two changes are actually interdependant.

<p>So, what some developers do is manually mark which patches are
predecessors to the next patch that they make.  Even more enlightended
developers use metrics such as whether or not the changed code still
compiles successfully or even passes the regression test suite to
consider changes dependant.

<p>Whether patch dependency works or not in practice depends on
whether or not developers create commits of a high enough standard
that they co-operate with this feature.

<p><strong>Interactive Commit</strong>

<p>I didn't talk about this much in the SVK section despite SVK having
this feature, mainly because <tt>darcs</tt> is where the feature came
from in the first place.

<p>Basically, the way it works is when you <tt>record</tt> changes,
you are presented with a summary of the changes, then asked to group
each change, <em>hunk by hunk</em> into bundles which are darcs
patches.

<p>This is largely how it is possible for the patch calculus to work
so well - if changes to a single file are combined into a single
commit as so frequently happens with file-grained <tt>commit</tt> in
other VCS, it entwines the two features being worked on to be
co-dependant.  The better the tool is at keeping changes small and
tidy, the better - but if they are too small, the reverse happens -
every feature is considered to be its own independant change.

<p><strong>ÃÂ¹ - And now darcs is a <tt>git</tt> porcelain, too</strong>

<p>With the arrival on the scene of <a
href="http://www.darcs.net/DarcsWiki/DarcsGit"><tt>darcs-git</tt></a>, a <tt>git</tt> porcelain with the UI of <tt>darcs</tt>, I have access to the interactive commit interface of <tt>darcs</tt> already.

<p>I don't miss patch dependency, because it is easily - and I would
add, less confusingly - performed with <tt>git</tt> using topic
branches (making a new branch for each new feature or stream of
development), and the powerful tools of rebasing and cherry picking.

<h2>Thank you!</h2>

Thank you for writing this excellent series. It's given me a good deal to think about.



<h2>git with interactive commit</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/mndrix/">mndrix</a> on 2007-02-09T19:32:08</h3>
git 1.5.0 has "add --interactive" which provides something similar to interactive commit.
