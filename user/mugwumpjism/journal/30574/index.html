<div class="span8">
<p><p>People are fussy about which version control system they use, to
the point of starting flamewars if the one they hold dear is knocked
in any way.

<p>But there is something entirely different about the version control
system "war".  Because, unlike the choice of window manager, desktop
system or editor, it limits which developers will be able to
co-operate in your project - at least, on the face of it.  Socially speaking, you then try to choose
the VCS that doesn't discourage people to contribute.  And therein
lies the principle resistence to any change.

<p>Subversion certainly has the upper hand on this front these days;
virtually everyone these days has a good idea about how to use
Subversion.  Its basic tenet is simple to understand; "Build a perfect
atomic filesystem that remembers the state after every commit and you
will have the perfect VCS".

<p>Subversion's model itself also allows for files and directories to
be "Copied-From" other files and revisions, which allows for branches
to be "cheap", essentially only the changes in the branch need be
represented in the model.  This is a good feature and a key selling
point.

<p>Subversion took the central, synchronised development idea of CVS,
and near perfected it as well as making it simpler to understand.  Despite the
complexity and rampant C programmer's diseaseÃÂ¹
in the code base, it has been
successfully integrated into many places.  Subversion's WebDAV module
for Apache2 allows it to be one of the few version control systems
that can <em>commit</em> via HTTP.  It also means that many of the
problems of distributed application management (such as encryption and
access/password management) to be deferred to the web server, which is
a Good Thing.  User interfaces have embraced it too, with tools like
TortoiseSVN (originally TortoiseCVS) and Cervisia coming to mind.

<p>There are other reasons that people have come to fear resistence to
change when it comes to version control.  Version control is
frequently viewed as being difficult, arcane and perhaps fragile.
Files are squirrelled away into this big opaque repository thing, and
only those with the know-how can get them back.  VCS experts use weird
and scary sounding terms like "branch", "tag", "merge", and "revert".
The 'common knowledge' is that doing these things is 'hard' and
shouldn't be attempted unless you're an expert.

<p>Sometimes, VCS experts of different systems even mean
<em>different</em> things with these terms!  For instance, in
Subversion, "merge" means copying changes from one place to another,
typically losing the intermediate history (though you are <em>strongly
recommended</em> to place in the changelog the revision numbers you
are merging), whereas in some VCS systems, "merging" means that two
branches become one, with a new word "pulling" when you are copying
changes.  Editors further overload the "merge" term to be the physical
act of taking two slightly different file, perhaps with a "merge base"
(or even "merge bases") and combining them into a result that
(hopefully) has both of the changes in them.  This creates further confusion exploring the deeper topics of version control, which are not actually very hard.

<p>Branching and Tagging didn't really fit into the filesystem model -
it's just not something you do with a normal filesystem - so the
authors made some vague references to not being able to see in three
dimensions, before shoehorning them in-band to the filesystem, a place
that many things have been shoehorned into over the years.  And that's
not necessarily so bad. A common convention has been established, with
a (hopefully immutable) <tt>tags/</tt> directory for snapshotting
releases, and a <tt>branches/</tt> directory for feature branches and
the like.  Then you have this idea of a place where all 'new' or
'current' development goes on, which is usually called something like
<tt>master/</tt> or occasionally the tongue-in-cheek path
<tt>ghetto/</tt>.  Different projects put these directories at
different levels, but for humans this is no problem.  And so long as
everyone can access and commit to the repository and plays nicely, it
works.

<p>You're told that the system remembers <em>everything</em>, so if
you screw that merge up or commit it to the wrong place, it's forever
there for all who care to see (<b>update:</b> <a href="http://colabti.de/irclogger/irclogger_log/perl6?date=2006-08-09,Wed&sel=323#l573  ">see what I mean?</a>).  Yet despite this, newbies to VCS in
general often fear a bad command undoing all the work they just did,
or learning that they somehow weren't committing properly and lost 2
weeks of work.

<p>Subversion is especially well known in the Perl community, with
high-profile projects such as <a
href="http://svn.openfoundry.org/pugs">pugs</a> with a wiki-style
commit policy and 12,000 commits in 18 months, and with community
groups such as <a
href="http://dev.catalyst.perl.org/repos/Catalyst">Catalyst</a>
publishing their work via Subversion.

<p>Despite the title of this post, I feel there is little else I need
to say to the Perl community to sing the praises of Subversion - we're
already rejoicing in harmony with a Version Control System that, largely speaking, Just WorksÃ¢âÂ¢.

<p>And with all that investment of time, goodwill and co-operation
happening under Subversion in the Perl community, any change had
better come with some pretty damned good pay-offs.
