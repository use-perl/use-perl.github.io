<p>Just got back from Starbucks and am enjoying a Caffe Mocha.  Good stuff.
<P>
I finally installed <a href="http://spamassassin.org">SpamAssassin</a> on our mail server and configured MailScanner to work with it.  Now any spam gets marked appropriately and redirected to a folder in my mail client.  I will soon redirect it to /dev/null when I'm comfortable with the filtering process.  I even wrote my first rule (some of our users receive an offending [to SpamAssassin] e-newsletter).
<P>
Casey & I also got back from a trip to the West Coast last weekend to Carmel, CA.  We flew out Friday morning and came back Sunday morning.  I figure in between the rush & travel (& some naps we threw in), we never experienced the jet lag. :)  We were out for a wedding of a good friend, as well as break away from North Carolina for a bit.
<P>
We had the early part of Saturday to enjoy Carmel and checked out the Carmel Mission and we drove down to Point Lobos, where it's said that it's the most beautiful meeting of land & sea and also where Robert Louis Stevenson got his inspiration for <i>Treasure Island</i>.  It was beautiful, granted, but I didn't get the chance to fully enjoy that area & its trails.  I did take pictures, but I haven't uploaded them to our Web site yet.  Coming soon, I promise!
<P>
I just realized I started this entry around 10:30am and now it's 5pm and ready to check out for the day.  Been pretty busy!
<P>
