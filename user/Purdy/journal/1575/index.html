<p>I decided to drop one of the two book deals, the one where I'd write an "Intro to Perl" with a co-author (and also the one that seemed more of a sure thing).
<P>
I'm gearing up to write up my proposal for the 2nd offer, which I would have more control of and one that I believe would have more of an impact than yet another "Intro to Perl" book.
<P>
My publisher is interested in hearing from others in this field (of web dev/perl folks) to see if we can get some editorial or publicity support... if you're interested, <a href="mailto:jason@journalistic.com">e-mail me</a> and let me know.  She may also want to see if you're more qualified to write the book or want to help write - I don't have qualms with that ... if my proposal ends up being written by someone else more qualified, all the better for the Perl community, imo.
<P>
I'm also wrestling with some stuff, too ... I'm currently thinking of donating half of the author proceeds (guess I don't have control over the book proceeds ;)) (after tithing) to Perlmonks, which is where I get a whole lot of information already and am grateful for the fine folks there that provide an overwhelming amount of technical support.  Marketing-wise, it would make a lot of good "synergy", but would that be too transparent?  Anyway, I risk bad vibes already with this journal post, b/c if I end up writing the book and greedily taking all the money, then that would be bad.  Oh well ... just thinking out loud, I guess.  Just don't set any expectations just yet!
<P>
