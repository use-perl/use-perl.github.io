<div class="span8">
<p>Last night (@ <a href="http://raleigh.pm.org">Raleigh.pm</a>) was a blast!  I didn't feel comfortable enough to go to the nearby bar (alas, no pub) afterwards, but that will come in time (after I find out they're no <a href="http://www.123nc.com">serial killers</a> - hah hah).
<P>
So we tackled tie's and I went into the meeting knowing <B>NOTHING</B> about ties, which was kinda scary, b/c I have a recurring nightmare of always being out of place and a mass of faces turning to me and in a chorus of a deep rumble, saying <B><I>"What are you doing here?"</B></I>.  But it wasn't like that at all - there were about 20 folks there and only about half of them had experience w/ ties.  So that made me feel pretty good/not so outta place.
<P>
Halfway through the program, the lightbulb went on in my head and I believe I now understand ties. :-)  Someone did bring up the question of efficiency of ties and no one authoritatively answered that question, so before I slam ties in every piece of code, I want to play around with it a bit and see just how useful it could be.  Right now, I'm envisioning database stuff... I'll letcha know what I find out.
<P>
