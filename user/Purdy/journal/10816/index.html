<BLOCKQUOTE><TT>
SEPTEMBER 11, 2001; THE UNTOLD STORYWHO REALLY BOMBED THE WORLD TRADE CENTER AND THE PENTAGON?? <br/><br/>THE UNTOLD STORY OF THE WORLD TRADE CENTERÃ¢â¬â¢S 53,000 SURVIVORS. <br/><br/>
ADVANCED KNOWLEDGE OF THE BOMBINGS.<br/><br/>Some 56,000 people were employed at the World Trade Center Twin Towers in September 2001. Of the total 230 floors in the two buildings, 85 floors were in the NO SURVIVOR zone. That is the zone above the floors where the planes hit, the three floors in each building that were taken out by the plane crashes, and the several floors below each crash that were engulfed by the inferno caused by the 20,000 gallons of high-octane fuel that each plane was carrying. There were NO survivors on those 85 floors in the two buildings!! (48 floors in one building and 37 floors in the other!)<br/><br/>Of the 56,000 people who worked in the two World Trade Center buildings, some 20,500 of them worked in the no survivor zone. Remember there were no survivors on those 85 floors of the two buildings. The floors above the crashes, the floors taken out by the crashes and several floors immediately below the crash points that were engulfed by the raging inferno caused by the 20,000 gallons of high-octane fuel that each plane carried.<br/><br/>Of the 20,500 people employed in the no survivor zones, there is a margin of error of possibly as many as 1,500. That leaves 19,000. Of those, there could be as many as 10% who could be out for one reason or another. Probably less because vacation season was past. 10% of 19,000 is 1,900. Call it 2,000 that could have been out that day for some legitimate reason. That leaves 17,000 people that would logically be in the NO SURVIVOR zone on September 11th.<br/><br/>It now turns out that there were 3,660 killed in the two buildings; 350 firemen, 20 cops, and several hundred people in the lower floors. Fewer then 3,000 people died in the NO SURVIVOR zone. What happened to the other 14,000 people who worked in the NO SURVIVOR ZONE who would have been killed if they had been at work that day? How did they know?<br/><br/>Maria Sanchez was on her way to work, but something just didnÃ¢â¬â¢t seem right to her. As she was parking her car, she found it very easy to get a parking spot. There were less than half as many cars in the parking lot that day in September as there normally would have been on any other given day. So she checked her watch thinking that she was just running early, but she was right on time. As she was walking down the sidewalk to her building, the World Trade Center, she was looking around and noticed that the sidewalks were less crowed than on other days. Maria started to think to herself; well maybe itÃ¢â¬â¢s a holiday, IÃ¢â¬â¢ll go check my calendar in my office. As she walked into the lobby of her building, again she noticed that the usual swarm of people was much smaller that morning. Where is everybody, she wondered. Maria went to the elevator to go to her floor. Normally the elevator is always packed like sardines, but today it was almost empty. Normally the elevator stops about nine times before she gets to her floor. But today the elevator stopped two times and the third stop it made was her floor. As she got off the elevator and started to walk to her office, she noticed that half of the people that work on her floor werenÃ¢â¬â¢t even there yet. Could she be early? She checked her watch. The first thing that Maria did as she walked into her office was look at the clock on the wall, and then she checked her calendar. There was nothing on the calendar about today being a holiday. She started to ask around, why most of the people arenÃ¢â¬â¢t at work today. Nobody had an answer for her because it wasnÃ¢â¬â¢t a holiday. So where was everyone? Maria looked around again. Mrs. Rosenthal is not here, Mr. Silverman is not here, Mr. Goldstein is not here, Mr. Finestine is not here, and Mrs. Kessler is not here either. ThatÃ¢â¬â¢s it, it must be a Jewish holiday, she said. Maria asked, is it a Jewish holiday? <br/><br/>
One of MariaÃ¢â¬â¢s co-workers Lisa McFadden, said that it wasnÃ¢â¬â¢t a Jewish holiday that she knew of. Maria asked Julia Kipinski. Julia replied laughingly, I donÃ¢â¬â¢t know. Kipinski is spelled with ski, not sky. I am Polish, not Jewish, but I will ask the people across the hall; they are all Jewish. But the office across the hall wasnÃ¢â¬â¢t open!! <br/><br/>
"I have to find out what is going on" Maria stated. "I get my work load orders from Mrs. Ullman and she isnÃ¢â¬â¢t here. If I stay and do nothing, I might get fired. And I need my job."<br/><br/>
Just then her phone rang; it was her babysitter, Lucy. Lucy told her that her son, Jose, has been hysterical for his mama to come home. Maria told Lucy that she would be home shortly. Since Maria didnÃ¢â¬â¢t have her work orders for today, and she didnÃ¢â¬â¢t want to get fired for sitting around and doing nothing, she left a message with Lisa, her co-worker. Maria told Lisa that if people started to come in, or if she found out anything as to why so many people werenÃ¢â¬â¢t at work today to call her right away and let her know. "Just tell them that I will be right back", she said. When Maria arrived home she called her office to see if Lisa had heard anything yet. The other office workers had NOT arrived and it was not a Jewish holiday. Just then the first plane hit the World Trade Center.<br/><br/>
If Bin Laden had never been born, Israel would have had to invent him. All of the terrorist acts attributed to Bin Laden did him no good. He has a twenty-five million-dollar price tag on him, dead or alive!! A price tag that could easily grow to one hundred million dollars!! He is presumably hiding out and running for his life!! He can never again be seen in public!! He will finally be caught and killed!!<br/><br/>
Every terrorist act attributed to Bin Laden has benefited his absolute worst enemy in the world and no one else!! His worst enemy in the world, the nation of Israel, has been trying for more then fifty years to get the U.S. to fight their war for them and destroy all Arab countries!! Israel could then expand and control the Middle East oil supply!!<br/><br/>
The only beneficiary was the nation of Israel!!! The Jews stayed away from the World Trade Center on September 11th. They knew and they were the only ones that did. Ask your Congressman and both U.S Senators to investigate this act of treason against America. Tell them to collect the $135 trillion Israel owes the United States and send each of them a copy of this letter!! $135 trillion will pay off all U.S. debts and have a large enough surplus to generate enough interest to abolish all taxes. 91% of our money goes towards taxes. <br/><br/>
The U.S. regular Army, Special Forces, Army Rangers, Marine Corp, Army Airborne, Navy, Air Force, FBI, CIA, Secret Service, U.S. Marshals, 50 foreign countries, 25 million Jews, 10 million Pakistanis, 5 million Afghanis, are all looking non-stop around the clock every day and every night for Bin Laden. They have not even found a trace of him. The only ones that can find him are the people in the news media, and they would have us believe that they interview him three times a week.<br/><br/>
The 25 million dollar price tag on him, to a one-dollar a day Afghani, is the equivalent of five tractor-trailer loads of hundred dollar bills to an American. The Afghanis change sides twice a week depending on who offers them more money. And the typical Afghani family has children who generally do not get enough to eat. They live in shacks or have no shelter at all, without fuel to keep them warm. Can anybody imagine that they would refuse to tell or give any information on Bin Laden and collect a $25 million reward? If he was dead, do you think they would refuse to bring in his body and collect a $25 million reward, which would feed their family and all of their friends for the rest of their lives? Since we are spending untold billions to wage war against him and find him, why are we not saving money by offering a one billion dollar reward to the country of the person who turns him in, plus the $25 million reward to the person. They would be a great hero for their country.<br/><br/>
Since there is a mountain of evidence that all the Jews who worked in the World Trade Center took the day off on September 11th, it is obvious to anybody who has been paying attention and following events, that the bombings were done by the nation of Israel. The sole purpose of the bombings was for the propaganda value. The purpose of the bombings was to blame Osama Bin laden, and accuses IsraelÃ¢â¬â¢s enemies of harboring him, so that the U.S. and other countries would wage war against IsraelÃ¢â¬â¢s enemies. If they blamed the bombings on somebody who actually existed, he would long since been caught and killed. The propaganda value of the bombings would have ended there with his death. IsraelÃ¢â¬â¢s propaganda machine (including the Israeli controlled news media), would have had to stop blaming IsraelÃ¢â¬â¢s enemies (all Muslim countries) of harboring him. How could they be guilty of harboring him if he was dead? On the other hand, if they blame somebody who does not exist, we could never catch him and then Israel would be able to continue blaming their enemies for harboring him. When I was in the military, working for General Douglas MacArthur, one of my jobs was to invent people. If you trained bird dogs all day every day for a living, you would pretty soon know a bird dog when you see one.<br/><br/>
Bin Laden has all the earmarks of one who was invented by the Israel propaganda machine. They will never catch Bin Laden because he does not exist. So long as his supposed existence has any propaganda value for the nation of Israel, their propaganda machine will continue to accuse their enemies of harboring him. When they will find it necessary to deceive us once again. I predict they will find a skeleton in a cave somewhere and they will have a Jewish dentist claim to have the dental charts of Osama Bin Laden and that they match the skeleton found in the cave.<br/><br/>
Meanwhile, the Israel propaganda machine VIA the Israel controlled news media in America will continue to proclaim that the enemies of Israel are harboring Osama Bin Laden. Just be glad that Al Gore is not president. Part of their plan was to have Al Gore president when this happened. If Al Gore and his cronies had been able to steal the election; we would be in full-scale war right now; and war to the death against IsraelÃ¢â¬â¢s enemies. It would probably include war against every Muslim country. We are very fortunate that we are not at full-scale war. For that we can thank God and Saint George.<br/><br/>

I worked in the WTC for a while, and they'd have been thrilled with a 53K employee count. Alas, the towers were partly empty, and the higher you went the emptier they were. (The bombing in the basement really cleared the place out, and it never really filled again, and the high floors were a <i>pain</i> to get to)<br> <br>Besides, if there really were some sort of Great Jewish Consipiracy, Cantor Fitzgerald wouldn't have lost nearly as many people as they did...

<h2>Obviously anti-semitic fabrications</h2>

Obviously.  There were similar stories about Arabs and Muslims being warned that sounded a lot like this one that I remember from late September 2001.
<p>
Let's accept as fact the 85-floor "NO SURVIVOR zone" is legit.  Let's also accept as fact that there were somewhere in the range of 19,000 to 20,000 workers in those floors.  Let's also be generous and accept most of the roughly 3,000 workers who perished worked on those floors.
</p><p>
Everything listed so far is just on the edge of being plausable.  Everything after the introduction of "Maria Sanchez" is not; the second part of the letter is written to pull on your heart strings and lead you down an antisemitic line of thought, and lead into the third part that questions Israel's right to exist and the competance of the US Military.  It also reads like poorly written fiction.
</p><p>
Set aside the rhetoric and examine these seemingly plausible facts.  The first plane hit at around 8:45 am.  Anyone who has worked in NYC knows that most people do not show up at their desks at 9 AM sharp, and are chronically a few minutes late for a host of good reasons, mostly transit related (slow train, commuter rail schedules, long line at the bagel shop today, etc.).  But the plane didn't hit at 9AM, it hit earlier when <i>fewer</i> people would have been at their desks.  Don't forget that the people who were en route around 8:45 and later just didn't go into the office.
</p><p>
Next, a goodly chunk of those 85 floors were in tower 2, the second one to be hit and the first one to go down.  The second plane hit about a half hour later.  So not only were <i>fewer people</i> at their desks, but they had <i>more time to evacuate</i> before their offices were hit.
</p><p>
Add all that up, and it's quite reasonable that a small fraction of the presumably 20,000 office workers in these 85 floors perished.
</p><p>
Realistically, the estimate of 85 floors and 20,000 people "supposed to have died" are way high.  I don't have the numbers in front of me, but I remember the number of high floors where no one survived only numbered about 12-20; according to this kook's numbers, that would bring the number of office workers in these floors down to the 5,000 range; factor in people not at their desks for any number of reasons, and 3,000 is both believable and accurate.
</p><p>
So even if you weren't going to paint this guy as a kook for his anti-Israel, anti-semetic and anti-US rhetoric, look at his numbers.  They don't add up.</p>

The numbers are actually pretty bad on top of that.<br> <br>For a data point, WTC 1, the first tower to be hit, housed Cantor Fitzgerald securities. Cantor had floors 102 to 107 (107 was the top floor of tower 1), and they lost 600 people for 6 floors, and they were by far the most densely packed of the top floor tenants, especially at that time of the morning. (The brokers got in to get a jump on the markets)<br> <br>That's at best, then, assuming the 85 floor 'kill zone' is accurate (and it wasn't, given tower 2 had time to evacuate, and believe me, when a plane hits the tower next to you, you get the hell <i>out</i> of the building), 8500 people. At the outside, presuming that all the floors were as densely packed (they weren't) and that people don't worry and leave (and they do).<br> <br>Just another dopey conspiratorial spam thing, and not a very inventive one at that. Whatever happened to the space alien and mind control conspiracy folks? They at least were amusing in their absurdity...

So fourteen <b>thousand</b> people got warned beforehand, and <b>none</b> of them told anyone outside of the conspiracy afterwards?<br> <br>Yeah, that seems kinda likely...

If it were true, then maybe my daughter's classmate wouldn't have lost his father on that terrible day.
<p>
Maybe my son's teacher wouldn't have lost her husband.
</p><p>
Maybe the man with the yarmulke, last seen carrying
his wheelchair-bound coworker down the stairs of one of the towers, is still alive.</p><p>
Perhaps <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/03/31/national/portraits/POG-31MILLER.html" title="nytimes.com">Joel Miller,</a nytimes.com> who according to the NYTimes enrolled in the <a href="http://courses.jtsa.edu/" title="jtsa.edu">Jewish distance learning program</a jtsa.edu> where I work as a programmer, would still be taking courses with us.
</p><p>Perhaps these <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/search/pog?gfield=body&amp;gquery=Jewish&amp;x=0&amp;y=0" title="nytimes.com">19 people with 'Jewish' in their obituaries</a nytimes.com>, would be alive.
</p><p>I'm not going to echo previous posters' points on the obvious nonsensical notion of a conspiracy of that magnitude.
</p><p>I am, however, angry and offended and hurt enough by this email -- which makes light of the grief I experienced as a Jewish member of the New York City metropolitan community -- to toss back some hard questions:
</p><ul>
<li>Why would somebody write this?</li>
<li>What's wrong with the conventional wisdom -- that the plot was planned by Islamic fundamentalists?</li>
<li>Who doesn't want us to remember that most of the murderers were Saudis?</li>
<li>Who has threatened to attack Jews wherever they live?</li>
<li>Who has been spreading sick conspiracy theories about Jews for decades now?</li>
