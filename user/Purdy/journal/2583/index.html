<p>Whoa!  A journal entry about Perl?  What's going on? ;)
<P>
We're having a problem with our Web site with our subscription database, especially since we started auditing ourselves through a third party vendor (audits are useful when selling our magazine to advertisers to backup our claims of circulation, though a pain digging numbers out of a system that wasn't designed for such to begin with).
<P>
One of the problems is that there are multiple ways to add/remove subscribers to our internal database.  Every change to the database needs to be recorded in a separate table, which some current scripts aren't doing.  My idea is to create a centralized "Subscriber" object that can handle additions, removals and alterations.  My manager doesn't 'get it', though, and tells me to wait for some incoming e-mail from him that would explain his needs more.  He believes we can just patch all the set of scripts we have now.  Whatever the needs are, I can't seem them eclipsing the need for such an OO'd design.  It would be a week or two of work, for sure, but worth it (especially for future script work)... may need to don my battle gear for this one. ;(
<P>
Oh well ... back to reading 'perldoc perltoot'
