<p>Interesting article (well, more like Trend report) in <a href="http://shopper.cnet.com/4002-7409_9-5076132.html?tag=shfd.smpl">Computer Shopper </a> about the next version of Windows and how it's gonna have fancy 3D graphics, but also dumbed-down interfaces for computers without the fancy video cards.<br/><br/>Man, whatta pain for Windows developers, having to create branches of their software for the different presentation types.  Or maybe Windows will flatten fancy apps automatically.<br/><br/>I love this quote: "We're not doing 3D in the [Windows] shell because it's cool - but it is cool."  How about why you <b>are</b> doing it, then?  Maybe you just wanted the article out there to let people know that you haven't fallen asleep at the wheel while Sun's <a href="http://wwws.sun.com/software/looking_glass/">Looking Glass</a> desktop gets a lot of the limelight and Longhorn won't see the light of day until 2010 (or whenever you've stabalized XP and incorporated those changes up to Longhorn).  I still remain unconvinced of a 3D environment's advantage, but then again, I haven't seen it in action.<br/><br/>I'm not sure if the <a href="http://www.microsoft-watch.com/article2/0,1995,1581842,00.asp">leaked specs</a> are accurate, but they sure will boost hardware evolution (and budgets) if so.  2GB RAM?  1TB Hard drive?  Methinks I'll be in XP for a while... at least until the coolest app ever comes out for Longhorn. ;)<br/><br/>Article: Longhorn Sends Windows Into Another Dimension - Computer Shopper, pg. 15. (sorry, can't find story online)<br/><br/>Peace,<br/><br/>Jason</p>

OS X already does the 3D trick.  The seemlingly flat desktop is actually rendered as 3D objects.  This lets them do things like transparency, overlapping windows, window scaling and window warping (like when a dropdown box slides out of the window bar) on the graphics card.  This is how Expose can move and resize a dozen windows quickly.<br> <br>Your desktop is getting more like a video game every day.<br> <br>PS  No, the developers likely won't have to code everything twice.  The window widget toolkit should just figure it out same way as you don't have to do any extra work for a black and white system.<br>
