<div class="span8">
<p>It seems that advertising is getting more & more pervasive into what most think of as editorial content.  There was <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article_email/0,,SB102089211635400,00.html">a good article</a> in the WSJ about this a few weeks ago and I'm seeing it again on <a href="http://www.theonion.com/">The Onion</a> with their <i>What Do You Think?</i> feature.  <a href="http://www.theonion.com/onion3820/wdyt_3820.html">Check it out</a> and see "Tom McEwan"'s answer and the plug for NetFlix.
<P>
That's a very very slick ad - most people would think that's part of a joke, but I bet that NetFlix paid for that.
<P>
Not that I'm totally naive about advertising, but I do believe it's wrong to devalue real content with integrated advertising... it will shortly "numb" audiences away from reading or viewing the content - basically what makes them audiences in the first place.  I know companies have to make money and advertisers have to get audiences to spend money on the companies they represent, but I believe there should be a sacred ground.
<P>
If they keep at it, it's going to be interesting to see the evolution of "content"... the public will demand it and it will exist in one form or fashion.
<P>
This Journal Entry brought to you by the fine folks at... heh. ;)
