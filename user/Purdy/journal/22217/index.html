<p>I think I'm getting the hang of this CPAN thing!  Unfortunately, <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/markstos/">Mark Stosberg</a> threw me a curve by introducing me to Module::Build, so now I'm wondering what's the best way to build CPAN modules ... the Makefile.PL way or the Build.PL way?  Guess I need to buy <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/159059018X">Writing Perl Modules for CPAN</a>.</i><br/><br/>Anyway, I have released two new-from-scratch modules:<ul><li><a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/purdy/CGI-Application-Plugin-Stream-2.00/">CGI::Application::Plugin::Stream</a></a> - CGI::Application Plugin for streaming files
(with major help from Mark on v2)</li><li><a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/purdy/Data-FormValidator-Tutorial-1.50/">Data::FormValidator::Tutorial</a> - Rewritten tutorial for Data::FormValidator
(co-authored with <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/wmckee/">William McKee</a>)</li></ul>I'm also starting to prepare for my trip.  I hope I can find my power adapter.  I'm not sure what to pack for the weather (besides rain ;)) - my expat friend says now's an arctic time, but weather.com says it'll be around 50.  Must be that global warming... ;)<br/><br/>Peace,<br/><br/>Jason</p>

I'm always slightly annoyed when I run a Build.PL script that wasn't written with <code>create_makefile_pl =&gt; traditional</code>.  If EU::MM is already installed and works, why should I have to go and install another module in order to build this one?
<br> <br>
That said I suppose if M::B become the canonical way to build modules I won't care too much.  But in the mean time, I appreciate traditional compatibility.
<br> <br>
Just my free advice, which is worth exactly what you paid for it {grin}.

I like Ken Williams' work a lot, but Module::Build is not shipped with Perl.  Don't use Module::Build unless you have a problem that it solves better than MakeMaker.  That would be something like interactive questions for the user.<p>
Alternatively, support both equally well by using the "traditional" option for creating a Makefile.PL from Module::Build.  Otherwise I would have to install Module::Build on every machine where I want to put your module, for no good reason.</p>

<p>I too really like Module::Build and use it exclusively when developing internal projects. However, I think that wisdom of the previous two posters prevails until such time as M::B is shipping with a mainstream version of Perl.</p>

<p>Because I haven't released many modules to CPAN, I didn't even realize M::B could generate a traditional Makefile.PL. Indeed the create_makefile_pl parameter to new() in conjunction with Module::Build::Compat should generate the file as Perrin describes. Cool!</p>

<p>Doh, I also meant to mention <a href="http://search.cpan.org/author/RGEOFFREY/ExtUtils-ModuleMaker-0.32/lib/ExtUtils/ModuleMaker.pm" title="cpan.org">ExtUtils::ModuleMaker </a cpan.org> which I use for creating my base packages. It can generate EU::MM, M::B, or M::B with a proxy Makefile.PL packages. The latter option isn't much help to you since it would still require M::B to be installed on the target system (it's like the 'small' style of create_makefile_pl).</p>

<h2>Module::Release{::Extras}</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/nik/">nik</a> on 2004-12-09T10:40:18</h3>
<p>If you're releasing stuff to CPAN you should take a look at Module::Release, and the associated release(1) command, which makes the process much easier.</p>

<p>And if you do use Module::Release with either Subversion or Module::Build then you should probably look at Module::Release::Extras too...</p>

<p>I found Module::Release::Extras on the CPAN but not Module::Release.  Can you give a link?</p>

<p>Er, that's odd.  It certainly used to be on CPAN.  Last I knew, brian d foy was planning a new release -- you can see this <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/nik/journal/19393" title="perl.org">from the horses mouth</a perl.org>.

</p><p>There's "release" on CPAN, listed under brian's software list, but that looks like it's a very old version (from before release(1) was split out in to Module::Release).  I wonder if brian's uploaded an old version by mistake at some point.</p>

There is apparently bad reindexing bummers running around.  Apparenlty I have the latest release, but I'm no longer the registered owner since brian came back.

<p>

Please ping brian directly and ask him to upload a new one, if only to get the version bumped, and then I'll delete all my versions.</p>
