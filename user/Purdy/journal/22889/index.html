<p><p>Polished off three more books so far this month:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Snow Falling on Cedars", by by David Guterson</li>
<li>"Vertical Run", by Joseph Garber</li>
<li>"Reckless Abandon", by Stuart Woods</li>
</ul>
<p>
"Reckless Abandon" was a wreck.  Formulaic dialogue and plots ... easy read ... one of those plane ride books.
</p>
<p>
"Vertical Run" was a little stronger.  Kinda reminded me of Die Hard.  The book was published in 1995 and on the book jacket it said the movie rights were sold, but I don't think that ever came to fruition (at least a movie by the same title).
</p>
<p>
"Snow Falling on Cedars" ... well, what can I say about this book?  It took me a month to wade through it.  It was a slow starter, but beautifully-written.  The phrase "tendrils of snow" will remain etched in my head as a powerful example of imagery.
</p>
<p>I'd say out of the four books I've read this month so far, that "Captain Saturday" remains the top one - a well-written book that makes you think on the priorities in your life.  Also upon the way you've constructed things and how life can be fragile and challenging (would you have the guts to rebuild your life if it was taken away from you?).
<p>Got two more books in my queue: "Code to Zero", by Ken Follett [NOT a coding book] and "Life of Pi", by Yann Martel.</p>
<P>Peace,</p>
<p>Jason</p></p>

<h2>Vertical</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/cog/">cog</a> on 2005-01-26T08:55:33</h3>
<i>"Vertical Run" [...] the movie rights were sold [...]</i>

<p>You mention "Die Hard", so maybe the book got to the movies by the name of <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0190865/" title="imdb.com">Vertical Limit</a imdb.com>?</p>

Well, I guess I shouldn't rule it out entirely as I haven't seen that movie, but the book took place mostly inside of a 50-floor business skyscraper in NYC.

Nope, that's not it<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br> <br>What happens inside the skyscraper?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

<h2>It's a pretty cool story, actually....</h2>

The main character goes to work and everyone seems to be in on a plot to kill him.  It starts w/ his boss coming in with a gun, trying to shoot him, then his friends, his family<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... everyone seems to be in on it.  What could be going on?
