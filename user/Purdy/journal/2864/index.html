<p>I'm slowly mounting stuff on my plate that I need to learn, to take our company into the next century.  Right now, we have one small simple Web server co-lo'd up in New York somewhere (we're in North Carolina).  When something happens to either the server or the ISP up there, we have no recourse and our visitors cannot get to us.
<P>
My manager doesn't want to see that happen again, so I need to learn/grok how to set up a secondary server somewhere (prolly w/ another ISP) that can accept the traffic when the primary server is down.
<P>
Does this make sense?  Can anyone point me to a resource to learn more?
<P>
Thanks,
<P>
Jason

<B>Update:</B> Oh, and I don't know how third-level domain names (instead of WWW, something like 'rt' (.mysite.com)) work - we don't provide our own DNS (we let our ISP handle that nightmare)... do they need to do this?</p>

IIRC (it's been a while), but each 'third-level' domain is just another host with its own A (address) or CNAME (alias to an A) record -- www.mysite.com, mail.mysite.com, use.mysite.com, etc. The folks who maintain your DNS definitely need to do this for you as it's all part of the same hostfile.

Hmm<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... ok.  That answers one of my questions.  My punk-ish ISP folks charge me $50/DNS entry/year<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... not sure if a third-level is worth that (yet).  I was trying to install <a href="http://www.fsck.com/projects/rt/" title="fsck.com">RT</a fsck.com> and it wants its own virtual domain in your httpd.conf file... I tried with an Alias and Location tag in the httpd.conf, but that didn't seem to work.

$50 per domain or $50 per DNS entry? The latter is highway robbery, IMO. Changing the zone takes on the order of 60 seconds even for a slow typist, and zones are changed very rarely. If so you should look into another service: maybe even the (super cool

<a href="http://www.dyndns.org/" title="dyndns.org">DynDNS</a dyndns.org>. It seems like the Custom DNS service lets you admin your zone from the web. Tres cool.

Well, per domain, but I bet if I ask 'em for a third-level entry, they'll charge me another $50.  Haven't asked 'em yet, tho.  I'll check out DynDNS - Thanks!
<p>
Also, I went to B&amp;N and grabbed wrox's Professional Apache which answered my question about the backup server: setup DNS on the web server and if it fails, have the second DNS point to the second web server.
