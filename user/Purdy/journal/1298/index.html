<p>On Saturday, I noticed our Web server not responding very well.  I tried telnetting into the server (which is co-located with <a href="http://www.vastnet.net">Vastnet</a>) and it connected, but wouldn't get to a login prompt.  I was able to pull up the Web administrative interface where I can tell the server to reboot, but it didn't reboot (I was able to continuously ping the server).
<P>
That was Saturday.  Since then, I've called & e-mailed them on Saturday, Sunday, and now today.  No response.  They're a Web hosting company, for goodness sake!  You'd think they'd have 24/7 support!  So now I'm waiting until 9am or 10am EST when they decide to work again to have them manually reboot the server.  Then my real fun begins in going through the logs and seeing what happened.  I can think of either two things:<BR>
<OL>
<LI>some software/hardware issue where the system is hanging up or</LI>
<LI>we were hacked (oh fun) - I just started NFS/Portmap service.  I did configure hosts.deny/hosts.allow properly, I believe, but who knows?
</OL>

<h2>Check your SLA</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/hfb/">hfb</a> on 2001-11-19T15:03:17</h3>
<p>Colo boxes don't get the time of day if the SLA you pay for doesn't include weekends or late nights so check the SLA clause in your contract.</p>

<p>It could be that the ISP you are trying to connect from has lost DNS as mediaone/ATT/whatevertheyarecalledtoday often has this happen and I can't connect due to rabid wrappers.</p>
