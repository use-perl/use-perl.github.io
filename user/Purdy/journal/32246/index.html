<p><a href="http://www.activestate.com">ActiveState</a> has released version 4.0 of their <a href="http://www.activestate.com/komodo_ide/new">Komodo IDE</a>, which supports multiple languages (Perl, PHP, etc), including TemplateToolkit.  It has tons of other features, including vi key bindings and extensive configuration options to make it bend to your will.  I've been playing around with the betas for the last few months and the new excitement for me is the capability to edit files remotely over SSH.<br/><br/>They also have XPI support, so we could develop add-ons much like those for Firefox & Thunderbird.<br/><br/>I was surprised that my fellow folks on #cgiapp haven't heard about it, so I wanted to share its goodness here.  They also have <a href="http://www.activestate.com/komodo_edit">a free version</a> with some functionality stripped out.  If you're using some other editor (<a href="http://www.crimsoneditor.com">Crimson Editor</a>, <a href="http://www.jedit.org/">jEdit</a>, etc), Komodo (Edit) is definitely worth your replacement consideration.<br/><br/>Also to share my latest webdev bounty, make sure you have <a href="http://www.getfirebug.com">Firebug</a>.  There was <a href="http://www.ddj.com/dept/debug/196802787">a great article in Dr. Dobbs</a> about how it can be used and I've found it priceless when trying to debug javascript & css/layout stuff.<br/><br/>Anyway, enough shilling for now. ;)<br/><br/>Peace,<br/><br/>Jason</p>

<p>I am toying with the "free" version. Some of the stuff I can replace with commands and snippets but I wish they would have left the in:</p> <p><blockquote> <div><tt>RX toolkit<br>Code browser</tt></div> </blockquote>  <p>If they would have left those 2 things in I would have given up $50.</p>

Agreed - I really like the Rx Toolkit.  A while ago, I came across an open source Rx Toolkit application, but can't find it again.  A Google search comes up with <a href="http://weitz.de/regex-coach/" title="weitz.de">RegEx Coach</a weitz.de>, though - it is a separate program, but perhaps there's a way to integrate it in?<br><br>- Jason

You can create a command in the toolbox to launch it. You can even create a custom toolbar and add it to there with its own icon if you so choose. RX Toolkit was really good though. : \<br><br>Also I am on OSX so some of the free ones aren't going to work. I know of a good Tcl based one as well. I will do a search tonight.<br>

<h2>A turning point.</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jk2addict/">jk2addict</a> on 2007-01-25T01:47:17</h3>
Version 4.0 may be a turning point for me. I've hated all previous versions...esp the code complete because it almost always never works most of the time.<br/><br/>I just tried 4.0 Edit..and I rather like it now. The prefs are saner. Much to my surprise, I could run server type perl scripts , have the output go to the console real time for requests. Add a browser pain on top of that, and Catalyst development just got a lot easier.

I lied. I had to stop using it. Simple things like add/moving files didn't work. IF would add a file to the root project, even though I told it to add it to a specific folder. And moving it around does DWIM. Maybe a bug, but a dangerous one at that.

I hope you either report a bug or asked AS about it.

I went to have a peek at that Firebug thingy and, wow, I think I'm in love.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br><br>I had been forever looking for something to help me debug javascript, and I think that the search is finally over.<br><br>Thanks for sharing!
