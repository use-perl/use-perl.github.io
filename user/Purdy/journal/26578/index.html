<p>When I first heard the news of Katrina, I really didn't appreciate the level of disaster.  After all, I live in NC and have been through a few hurricanes and didn't really see what all the fuss was about.<br/><br/>But seeing the pictures, the news videos, the breakdown of society ... we also asked our subscribers in those states how they were doing and <a href="http://www.qsrmagazine.com/shells/full.phtml?id=4656">the response</a> was very touching.  Reading that really opened my eyes and called me into action.<br/><br/>My Uncle sent an email saying that for Christmas presents this year, he was making a donation to the relief efforts.  This is a great idea and makes for a more meaningful and special family event.<br/><br/>So, however cynical you are ... whatever you belief ... whatever your political affiliation ... people in those affected areas need your help!<br/><br/>Think about donating and asking your family and friends to see if they'd rather their present money be redirected to a donation in their honor.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/><br/>Jason</p>
