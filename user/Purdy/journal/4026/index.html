<p>Hmmm ... well, where to start?  It's been a while since I've updated this blog... and there have been quite a few good reasons, but one really big one that has me a little "spooked."
<P>
About a month ago, I received an e-mail from an old friend who I hadn't seen in ... hmm ... well, probably 10 years.  Anyway, with the help of Google and the information I have put out there, he was able to summarize our lives (me & my wife) up to the current day.  I don't really mind ... well, actually, I do a little - I do like to have some surprises up my sleeve (as well as when we do get together, it doesn't keep the "let's catch up" conversation one-sided).  What I'm really concerned about is any stalkers out there with violent (or somewhat harassing) tendencies (which wouldn't be too hard to create/envision with some of Casey's students).
<P>
I remember back in high school - I would rarely pose for a picture because I thought if I ever went into the spy business, it would be great to have no picture available (of course, that never panned out - well, not yet ;)).
<P>
Ok, so moving beyond that, I'm figuring out what to do with the web thing - should I start putting an anonymous filter on what I do?  What privacy concerns should I be worried about?  It's got me thinking...
<P>
So I've been a little wary of posting about the wedding and the new house (both of which "transacted" perfectly ;)), or anything else new in my life.  Perhaps I should simply keep this blog in a professional manner, journaling only work details and what-not...
<P>

<h2>why worry?</h2>

<p>I've been on the receiving end of several stalkers and you really shouldn't change the way you wish to live in hopes that someday, somewhere it will help protect you from someone with a pathologically determined mind. I had one guy go through 5 unlisted phone number changes in short order. Write about what you want as if someone wants to terrorise the internet is only a small part of the equation.</p>
