<div class="span8">
<p>First, let's start off with some really great news: my boss approved my trip to <a href="http://london.pm.org/lpw/">LPW</a> and I've already booked my flight & <a href="http://www.cairnhotelgroup.com/dtls_htl.asp?hotelclicked=yes&hotelvalue=BG1">hotel</a>.  I'm really looking forward to the talks, though it's humbling that with my experience, I'm more suited for the <a href="http://london.pm.org/lpw/talks.html">"Learning Perl" track</a>.  Oh well, I'll get over it, learn a lot and I'm sure a pint or two will quickly make me forget all about that.<br/><br/>Speaking of which, I've been off beer as part of the South Beach Diet, opting for wine instead.  I guess it's been close to 3 months now and I've lost 28 pounds.  My goal is 40-50 pounds, but I may have to take a diet-hiatus come LPW-time, given the exquisite beer selections in London.  More on the diet - I had a physical a few weeks ago and my bloodwork came back last week and my doctor called me and said it was flagged b/c my cholesterol was too <b>low</b>!  Nothing to be concerned about, really (the body will make the necessary cholesterol to survive), but 97 total cholesterol.  My "good" cholesterol is less than it should be, too (37 vs. &gt;=40), so the doc recommended exercise (*grumble* - I'm much too lazy for that) and red wine (oh, ok ... I can handle that).<br/><br/>In <a href="http://www.apachecon.com">ApacheCon</a> news, I've had to cancel my tutorial.  There were still only 2 registrants, the conference was (rightfully) backing down from their obligations and I didn't want to end up paying to present the material.  Ever since the initial warning, I was also slack in preparing my presentation, so with less than two weeks to go, I'm not crazy about bum-rushing the presentation together (in addition to paying to present).  I'm disappointed that I couldn't attract more registrants.  I'm wondering if the conference as a whole is down this year, especially with some folks not liking the venue (Vegas).<br/><br/>I could ramble on about some politics and the recent election, but I'll save that for another entry (soon to come, I'm sure).<br/><br/>Tomorrow, <a href="http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2004/11/04/komodo3.html">my review</a> of <a href="http://www.activestate.com/Products/Komodo/">ActiveState Komodo 3.0</a> will be published on <a href="http://www.perl.com">perl.com</a> (or so <a href="/user/chromatic/journal">chromatic</a> tells me).  I'm excited to have something written published, even moreso with O'Reilly - Stay tuned!<br/><br/>Peace,<br/><br/>Jason<br/><br/><b>Red Wine Recommendations:</b> <ul><li><a href="http://www.bevmo.com/productinfo.asp?sku=00000018609&sasrc=HomeNav&N=168+166+39+4294956551&area=wine">Bogle Zinfandel</a></li><li><a href="http://www.wine.com/product/display.asp?pproduct_id=WWH31BBHR2_2002">Big House Red</a></li><li>There's also a really great French one, but I don't have the label handy.  I'll update this journal entry w/ the label after I go pick up some more.</li></ul><br/><br/><b>Update:</b> <a href="http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2004/11/04/komodo3.html">Review is now online</a></p>

You wouldn't happen to know how close/far that hotel is from the venue, would you?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

I asked on #london.pm and they said it was walking distance, so it's walkable.  It's also two tube stops away, too.  They also said that hotels right close to the event would probably be pricey.
