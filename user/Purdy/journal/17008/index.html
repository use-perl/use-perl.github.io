<p>Reading some of the headlines on <a href="http://news.google.com">Google News</a> and saw that LotR won some awards ... hoorah for them.<br/><br/>&lt;HollyWood_Rant&gt;Honestly, how did these clowns ever dream up an award show to celebrate themselves?  And get the rest of the media and public to care?  And how many times do they have to repeat themselves?  Oscars, Golden Globes, SAG, People's Choice, MTV, etc ... and that's just the US.  Who cares?&lt;/HollyWood_Rant&gt;<br/><br/>Anyway, not to take away from LotR - I finally saw the third one last weekend and it was a good movie.  Great stuff... now I can't wait until the super directors cut rainbow edition premium 25 DVD collection of the whole trilogy comes out.  Probably a few months before the Hobbit comes to screens and then tack on another 4 DVDs for that.<br/><br/>You know it's all about the dollar... that's what 99% of the Hollywood types are looking at in terms of the success of a movie.  If it wins an award, that's cool ... marketing slaps the award sticker logo on the product to boost sales, too.<br/><br/>I remember watching one of the earlier MTV Movie Awards shows (don't ask) and Jim Carrey comes out to either accept an "award" or introduce someone and he makes the comment about how he didn't really want to be there, but Ron Howard, the director of his upcoming movie (the Grinch) called him up and coerced him, based on the premise that the appearance would help promote the upcoming movie.<br/><br/>Gah, I'm bitter... ;)  I guess I'm not telling you anything you don't know already - I'm just venting. :)<br/><br/>Peace,<br/><br/>Jason<br/><br/>PS: <b>You</b> are just as special as any of those other guys & gals.  We just don't have a multi-billion dollar industry to put together a multimedia, celebrity-packed spectacular to recognize your greatness.  So Smile, Be Happy and Enjoy the Moment ... you've won the 2004 Special Person of the Year Award.</p>
