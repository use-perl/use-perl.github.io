<p>Had an excellent weekend - on Saturday, I went golfing with my best friend.  We're both horrible and play nothing-over-double-par, which definitely kept us from monopolizing the course (an easy par 3 course, useful for practice and gentle to the beginners [though we did end up losing our share of balls to the water]).  Before we tee'd off on the first hole, a teenager (10th grader from a nearby high school) asked to join us.  We didn't mind and we gave the disclaimer that we sucked.  I beat my friend by 8 ... but here's the embarrassing part.  Par for the course?  54.  Our scores:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Me: 90
<LI>Chris: 98
<LI>Teenager: <B>60</B>
</UL>
<P>
Oh well, I'm fine w/ the fact that I'll never be a Tiger Woods. ;)
<P>
Then yesterday, I took possession of a keg of a double bock beer from the <a href="http://www.weepingradish.com">Weeping Radish</a> brewery.  Another friend of mine has a keg-erator (a fridge specifically designed to house and distribute a keg of beer [tap at the top]).  I had called the brewery and arranged the deal with the brewmaster - we actually got the last keg (and thus, now the only place where you can get the Christmas Bock).  The main problem is that they don't have a distributor nearby (and the brewery is a 5 hour drive away).  Fortunately, they had a delivery due in the opposite side of the state and they passed through where I was, so I met them in a parking lot nearby.  I'm sure it looked suspicious to any onlookers - two cars pulling up and a keg exchanged. ;)
<P>
Whatever - now I have some of the darned best beer on tap!  It's a smooth double bock (which led me to the cute Subject - double bock -> bock bock ... chickens!).  Here's a quandry, though: in North Carolina, they prohibit the sales of beer over 6% ABV (alcohol by volume) [don't know why], but by definition (in Germany), a double bock is no less than 6.7% ABV.  Where's a mass spec when you need one?  I think I'll call the brewmaster and ask on the down-low...
<P>
Hope everyone else had a wonderful weekend...
<P>
Jason</p>
