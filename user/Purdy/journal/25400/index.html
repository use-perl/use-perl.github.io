<p><strong>good talks</strong><br/><br/>Went to a lot of testing talks, so my head is spinning on that front.  One neat concept I picked up from statico & chromatic's talk is MockObject.  With that, I could mock MIME::Lite and override the email sending to not send, but test the email body to see if it matches expected customization.<br/><br/><strong>great food</strong><br/><br/>Toronto has some of the greatest restaurants.  I always find myself exploring the food options whenever I travel - I like to find places that are local-flavor.<br/><br/>Had a great Thai meal in some hole-in-the-wall place right around the corner from the conference.  It was so good, I might have to go back again today for lunch...<br/><br/>I was overthrown for the dinner choice (Bow & Arrow).  It was said it would take too long to get there ... took us two shots at a replacement (first restaurant was already full) along with a 20 minute walk.  I'm not sure we saved time, but a good time was still had by all.  <br/><br/><strong>awesome cgiapp meeting</strong><br/><br/>We had a CgiAppBOF later, which was awesome - it included a lot of the folks from the mailing list and some new folks as well.  We talked about marketing efforts (always amusing to dabble in the dark side) to create more awareness of cgiapp's capabilities.  We also talked about the CAF project, a BREAD project and cgi-session.<br/><br/>Sorry for the lapse of links -- rushing this out to go get ready for Day 2.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/><br/>Jason</p>
