<p>It sucks when you hear odd noises coming from different places in your car.  Casey's Honda ('95 Civic) has a high-pitched whining noise coming from the front right wheel area and rattling noise coming from the muffler area.  My guesses are that something's off w/ the brakes and the muffler and/or catalytic converter.  If the catalytic converter's involved and has to be replaced, that's easily $800.  Ouch!  I dropped it off at the local Honda dealership this morning - you do NOT want to mess around with putting that stuff off (if you put off the catalytic converter, the filter pieces can break apart and flow down your muffler pipe, causing further problems [backfiring to stalling out] and you'll have to end up replacing the muffler as well).
<P>
I know what you might be saying - take it to Meineke (or however they spell themselves).  I did that w/ my Saturn when it needed a new catalytic converter.  Saved me $400 - BUT, they welded on a universal catalytic converter and to this day, their shoddy job results in a un-doable rattle in the exhaust system.  Reminds me of the saying: <i>You get what you pay for</i>... - well, the converse is equally true: <i>You pay for what you get</i>.

<h2>check the alternator belt</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/hfb/">hfb</a> on 2002-01-29T15:42:47</h3>
<p>Usually the high pitched squeal is a slipping belt...most often the alternator belt. often easy and cheap to fix.</p>



<h2>Heard back from the Honda folks..</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Purdy/">Purdy</a> on 2002-01-29T15:54:52</h3>
The squeal noise was the breaks - the pads were worn down and it was the "indicator" that was making the noise.  Cost?: $214.13
<p>
Then, hfb - you also get a point - the belts (timing, etc) were dry/cracked and suggested replaced.  Cost?: $235.00 (no $0.13 there?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;))
</p><p>
The exhaust system was "tight" and "clean" and they didn't recommend repair.  Phew!  I was so thankful that it wasn't the catalytic converter.  They weren't able to reproduce the rattling noise, so hopefully that means it's gone away (ha ha).  We'll see after we get the other noise eliminated.

They want to charge you $200+ to replace BRAKE PADS? If so, <b>RUN</b> as fast as you can to a local mechanic. Dealerships are great for warranty work, but they are just too darn expensive for routine things like brakes.
<p>
And I bet you can get a better deal on the belts. How many miles are on the car anyway?</p>

<h2>Catalytic converter</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/lachoy/">lachoy</a> on 2002-01-29T17:31:27</h3>
A few years ago we had to replace the catalytic converter on my wife's 1991 Cavalier. I was very pleasantly surprised when the total came to just under $200 for labor and parts. Maybe it won't be as much as you expect.
