<p>I think I read someone's journal that recommended this movie (The One w/ Jet Li).  I got to see it last night and thankfully, I went in with low expectations (I've heard bad things about it, namely the plot).  It was entertaining (great fight scenes), I'll say that - it at least gave me & my friend material to talk about over dinner.
<P>
I don't want to spoil anything about the movie if you go & see it ... BUT I do have to say that the premise of the movie is that there's a multiverse with multiple parallel universes.  I've heard this theory before (btw, that reminds me of a great book if you haven't read it already - <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0679444815">Timeline</a> by Michael Crichton), but in the movie, instead of there being infinite parallel universes, there were only 125.  Huh?  Where'd they even get that number?

Well, think back:  Whenever you see technical concepts used in plots of major motion pictures, they've inevitably been reduced in complexity to make sure the modern moviegoer will understand them a little.
<p>
Therefore, for the modern moviegoer, infinity = 125.
</p><p>
I'm sure lots of interesting conclusions could be drawn using the ratio 125/infinity to determine how watered down a technical subject has become in a movie.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
</p><p>
I think it's also nice of the movie industry to do what the mathematical world has been unwilling to for so long!  Finally, we can replace infinity in all those equations!</p>

I don't know about that....
<p>
There are probably exactly 127 parallel universes (2^7 - 1; who said that all of creation was supposed to be 8-bit clean?).  For reasons we don't fully understand, universe 0 is a purely theoretical construct, and one of the other universes may have winked out in a fit of illogic.
</p><p>
Ergo, there are exactly 125 parallel universes.  QED.
