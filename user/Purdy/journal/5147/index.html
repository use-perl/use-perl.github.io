<p>I'm back from Chicago, where I did booth-duty at the NRA (<i>s/Rifle/Restaurant/</i>, silly) show, which was the biggest trade show I've ever been to (and I've been to Comdex).  I took <a href="http://www.purdy.info/gallery/nra2002">some pictures</a>.
<P>
I definitely kept busy - I didn't get a chance to go to the <a href="http://chi.pm.org">Chicago.PM</a> meeting or get some Chicago-style pizza.  Maybe next trip!
<P>
Ok, so Star Wars ... I saw it last Friday (I was in the neighborhood of the theater and walked by to see if they had tix available and they did ... strange).  It was ok - I enjoyed the fight scenes.  Other than that, it was horrible - Anakin just made me laugh and groan at the same time.  <b>Someone</b> has got to do a better job w/ the dialogue - you can't just rely on the Force and lightsaber fights.  I was able to break away & see the digital projection at Loews McClurg Court Sunday night @ 10:15.  That was pretty cool, too - much sharper picture.
