<p>A few weeks ago, I finally bought a new car ('03 Jetta GL 1.8T), a sweet lil' car with the Euro-flair and 180hp to boot.
<P>
It's my first new car purchase and it took over 5 days of negotiations and countless more days of research to find the right make/model for me.  I was looking at getting an used car, to save money, but when it was all said & done with, I got a great deal and a car that fit my needs (& personality).
<P>
So I love commuting now - I was driving my first car purchase, a '92 Saturn, which was wearing me out, driving 25 miles one way in a manual transmission with no cruise.  Now, I just hit the cruise and enjoy the ride.  Having a CD player is pretty cool, too ... now I just gotta find a 6-disc CD Changer that will plug into the pre-wired space in the trunk that can hopefully play MP3's (wouldn't that be cool?  Over 1200 songs ... I'd never have to listen to the radio!).
<P>
Anyone know anything about changers around here?

I guess It's cool that if you live in america you can attach something like "euro flair" to what I would call the most boring car in the world<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

Indeed<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... if the gas prices ever come down in Europe, you (assuming you're European) might be introduced to the "American might" (the SUV).<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)
