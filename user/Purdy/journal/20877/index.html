<p>I have this rule in my postfix configuration to block out .com attachments:<blockquote><tt>/name=[^>]*\.(ade|adp|asd|bas|bat|chm|cmd|com|cpl|crt|dbx|dll|exe|hlp|hta|inf|in

Please do not include any executable attachments in your email.</tt></blockquote>So what's interesting is that some people are complaining b/c they're sending us e-mail and the server is rejecting it:<blockquote><tt>Sep 14 14:13:00 mail postfix/cleanup[24893]: D6354198047: reject: body  name=3D"place" downloadurl=3D"(Link: http://www.5iantlavalamp.com/)http://www.5iantlavalamp.com/"/>; from=&lt;someemail@domain.com&gt; to=&lt;someemail@domain.com&gt;: Potentially dangerous file attachment. Please do not include any executable attachments in your email.</tt></blockquote>It kinda stuck out at me b/c this was the 2nd time I saw that 5iantlavalamp.com domain, so it piqued my interest.  A WHOIS reported it was owned by Microsoft!  I go to <a href="http://www.5iantlavalamp.com">the Web site</a> and it redirects me to some Office site.  So I'm guessing that some new version of Outlook has that stuff embedded in the e-mail message and other Outlooks know about it and will do something (spiffy ;)) w/ that.  I'm sure there's no security vulnerabilities, there. ;)<br/><br/>I could refine that rule a bit (not sure how at the moment), but I'll wait & see if it becomes a big problem.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/><br/>Jason</p>
