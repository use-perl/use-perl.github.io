<p>This is just blowing off some steam and perhaps a warning, too.<br/><br/>So I ordered a Mac Mini for my wife's birthday back in February (Feb. 16th).  When I ordered it, the graphic on the main page was "Now Shipping", though that all depends on your interpretation of "Now", as after I ordered, it told me it would be 2-3 weeks. I suppose it told me while I was ordering, but I was in the shopping "zone."  My local Apple store didn't have any in stock, so that's why I used the Web.  I also used the Web to upgrade the RAM, which the local Apple store would charge extra for.<br/><br/>Anyway, during the purchase, they were giving a printer away for free (after rebate).  So I tacked it onto the order, thinking, "Ok, cool -- a free printer."  I also choose to pay for expedited shipping and to have the order items shipped as soon as possible (again, hoping to get things in place for Casey's birthday).<br/><br/>The next day, the printer, the AppleCare Protection Plan and Keyboard/Mouse arrive.  That same day, the Apple store calls to tell me they have a Mac Mini in stock, if I want it.  D'oh!  Meanwhile, the Web store still tells me 2-3 weeks.  So I resort to presenting Casey w/ the accessories and a mock-up of the computer (I made one out of cardboard, to spec).<br/><br/>Casey was disappointed that it wasn't all in place, but she was a good sport.  Meanwhile, my frustration and disappointment is mounting.  Finally, I can't stand it and I go to the local Apple store, buy a stock Mini, cancel the Web order and get Casey going.<br/><br/>So I prepare the rebate.  Here's the pinch: in order to qualify for the rebate, the purchases must be done at the same time and appear on the same receipt.  I figure how technical can that be?  I mean, I feel like I've honored the agreement by buying the qualifying products.  So I cut out the UPC codes from the packaging, fill out the form and include everything in an envelope.<br/><br/>A few weeks later, I get a letter from Apple (this Apple is from South Bend, Indiana ;)) saying they couldn't verify my purchase.  So I figure they're onto my game.  So I resort to writing a letter explaining everything and hope for the best.<br/><br/>Nope.<br/><br/>I receive another letter that says that since I didn't buy them at the same time and they don't appear on the same receipt, they wouldn't honor the deal.<br/><br/>So I call them and talk to a very non-helpful person.  I figure that's gotta be a tough job and I resolve myself not to express any anger or frustration on the phone (maybe that didn't help).  Anyway, she sticks to the party line, offers no further explanation.  I ask if I could return the printer and she says she doesn't deal w/ returns -- she's just a rebate person.  I ask if I can get my UPC codes back (badge of honor!) and she says no, they become property of Apple upon submission.  Note that it doesn't say that in the nitty-gritty details of the rebate and that's a weaker argument since they're not really using them in the first place.  More like they tossed them.<br/><br/>Last night, we decided to end up keeping the printer.  I made the comment that it was better to spend $100 on something than the $30[1] on nothing.<br/><br/>Several times during writing this post, I wanted to scrap the whole thing, it makes me pretty mad.  But hopefully, this will be cathartic to my system, and I won't want to scream everytime I see the printer.  Hopefully this could be an example or lesson for others, too -- though you probably wouldn't have done what I did.<br/><br/>It's also pretty interesting that Casey hated the transition initially, but I've heard her say several times now "I love my computer" -- music to my ears. :)<br/><br/>Peace,<br/><br/>Jason<br/><br/><small>[1]: I figure I could sell it on eBay to recoup some of the cost, but end up leaving about $30 (or so) difference.</small></p>

<h2>I would not have given up so easily</h2>

I am the sort of person that lets a lot of things slide.  I let people get away with things just because it is not worth the time or energy.  When I do push an issue, I seldom end up with any result other than the one I want.<br> <br>I recently switched banks after being with one for years.  Their customer service had gone down hill over the course of 6 months and I had given them every opportunity to correct the problem to include spending copious amounts of time documenting problems.  When I finally left, I did so knowing I did everything I could to improve the situation.<br> <br>At the new bank, we didn't start off on the right foot.  I had customer service problems in every department (it is a large bank) within 3 months.  Every time I talked to a manager, they wanted to address the problem at hand even though I kept telling them it was a rampant problem that could not be fixed so easily if they looked at it holistically.<br> <br>Then there was a straw that broke the camel's back.  I wrote a letter to the president of the bank along with any other high level executives I could find the email address for.<br> <br>What did it get me?<br>1.  Phone calls from heads of each department wanting to know more about what problems I experienced and what I thought could have been done better.<br> <br>2.  Waiving of my home loan application fee ($300).<br> <br>3.  A letter from the president signed in ink with a check for $250 apologizing for the problems.<br> <br>4.  An open invitation to point out process (not personnel) problems that will be elevated straight to the top.<br> <br>Why did they do this?  Here are the closing paragraphs of my email:<br> <br>I could leave BANK_NAME in a huff and I am sure that it would not hurt business in any significant way.  I could speak vehemently about how poorly I have been treated to friends, family, and strangers.  I could do lots of things, so why have I chosen to take the time to elevate things to this level?  It is because I believe strongly in giving second chances even though as individuals, we seldom receive them.  If I mail a check to BANK_NAME to pay a bill but forget to put on the stamp, will the Post Office forgive me my mistake and deliver it anyway?  Will BANK_NAME waive the late fee because it didn&#8217;t arrive on time because everyone makes mistakes once in a while?<br> <br>I am giving you this opportunity to improve before I pass judgement and move on.  This is your opportunity to show me that the past few months were a fluke and that you indeed know what good customer service is all about.

Yeah, well, my spirit is sapped and based on my experiences thus far, I honestly believe no good would come from any further efforts.
