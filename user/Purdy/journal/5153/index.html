<p>Well, I finally gave up on having Linux as my workstation here at work.  While it was cool having virtual desktops, a real stable environment, etc, it really came down to productivity - something that Linux just couldn't provide me with (perhaps it's b/c I grew up on Windows):
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Scroll wheel: Sure I had a crappy OEM Logitech mouse, but Linux for some reason couldn't handle it.  It sure comes in handy when dealing with a lengthy piece of code.
<LI>Printing: Got a Novell network and got it set up, but for some KDE applications, it wouldn't work and for others (StarOffice, the console 'lpr' command) it would.
<LI>CD Ripping: I was using RipperX (on the old drive) and it would take hours to rip a CD.  Needless to say, RealJukebox does this in minutes.
<LI>CD Burner: I could only burn a CD and after doing a <i>modprobe ide-scsi</i>.  <b>cdrecord</b> is an awesome application - I do give that props... but ...
<LI>CD Mounting: After getting my new CD-RW drive installed, I couldn't mount CD's anymore.
<LI>Coding: I'm not a gvim or emacs guy - I like project-based IDE's to work within.  I tried Glimmer and Komodo, both of which were either slow or had functionality missing that I needed.  I'm now using Crimson Editor on Windows right now.
</UL>
<P>
So now I have a cheesy/instable Win98 workstation, but at least I found a virtual desktop shareware app (<a href="http://www.shelltoys.com">Cool Desk</a>) and Putty & WinSCP are cool apps, too.
<P>
Of course, I'm just waitin' 'til I get a new tiBook/OS X, hopefully later this year.
<P>

<P>
<B>Update:</B> Added the coding point... I'm sure this list will grow as I think of other things that bugged me.</p>

<h2>Win2K</h2>

Windows 2000 seems reasonably stable (compared to 9x/ME). You may want to consider that. Or not =)

Agreed - I just haven't a copy of Win2K here at work.  I use Win2K at home and it's very nice.

Normally, I'd agree.<br> <br>But my copy has just decided that it wants to crash any installers that run. On the bright side, <cite>Emperor: Battle for Dune</cite> is already installed. On the not so bright side, programs that my gf would like to learn to use aren't.<br> <br>Darnit.<br> <br>
