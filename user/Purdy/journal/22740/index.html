<p>Lately, I've been outsourcing my library book selection to my wife, mostly because I'm usually staying at home with Meredith at the time.  This has had the additional benefit of reading books that I wouldn't necessarily look at to begin with.  She has an uncanny knack of picking books that I enjoy (e.g. "Zenith Angle", by Bruce Sterling and some Brad Meltzer thrillers).<br/><br/>The latest book she picked was "Captain Saturday", which was written by a local author and set in my neck of the woods, both in terms of where I am now (Raleigh) and where I grew up (Pender County and the rest of southeast NC).  So these "hooks" were appealing, but this is a great book for others, as well.<br/><br/>This book is very well-organized, flowing through the main character's (Will Baggett) life in a Pulp Fiction-esque style.  As a matter of fact, this was one book that I could see made into a movie (and would love to see it done, too!).  Robern Inman also develops the character into a very sympathic one Ã¢â¬â one that I could identify with.<br/><br/>The story is a great inspection of Will's life.  Will has constructed a life as the most popular weathercaster in Raleigh and when life throws him some major curves and Will takes a few self-destructive steps, his life becomes derailed.  His cousin Wingfoot (what a great name) arrives, plucks him from the mayhem and places him on a path of self-discovery and proper prioritization.<br/><br/>My only gripe about the book is that the ending could have been longer Ã¢â¬â I wanted to know more (What happened with his wife?  What did he mean by resuming "Captain Saturday"?).  A great book and recommended read.  I'd love to see this in a movie, though I'd be scared of the typical treatment Hollywood gives us Southerners.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/><br/>Jason</p>
