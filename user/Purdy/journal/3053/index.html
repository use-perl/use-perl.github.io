<p>Seeing hfb & pudge go at it was pretty entertaining, until it prompted hfb to leave this site altogether... that's not cool.  I don't know them personally, but I imagine they're both pretty hard-headed with opposite polarity of perspectives.  Kinda like oil & vinegar ... or matter & anti-matter.
<P>
Patriotism is a funny thing, as well as a personal thing.  Personally, I believe the good ol' USA is a great place to live and I daresay better than most countries out there.  I agree that there are problems in the US (education, taxes, social security, health care, sporting leagues ... the list goes on), but as someone who's raised American, those are familiar problems that I'm just used to.  Often I look at picturesque vistas from far-away places and imagine myself there (much like the grass is greener on the other side), but every time I travel abroad, I look forward to coming home ... because it's familiar footing and I'm the type of person that doesn't like strange environments.
<P>
So ... does that make me uninteresting?  Ignorant?  Perhaps so ... I'm just happy to be in my (small & comfortable) world.

I am not going to argue, but I would like to point out that I know a great many "colored" people in this country who think it is a great country.  That includes the many in the inner cities that I've known.<br> <br>I'm done with trying to convince people, not that I am right, but that there are other ways to see things, and that I am not stupid or uncaring for my opinions.

First, "colored" is a rather offensive term these days.<br> <br>Second, I never said that there aren't people of color who like this country.  There are <b>many</b> places that are worse for people of color around the world.  For example, most of Africa is pretty bad.  Of course, it's well worth remembering <b>why</b> Africa is such a mess right now, largely due to Western influence.<br> <br>On the other hand, there <b>are</b> places where certain things are better for people of color.  Cuba, for example, has done a <b>much</b> better job of addressing historical racism than the US or any European country.  Which isn't to say that Cuba on the whole is a better place to live, just that it has different problems.<br> <br>Second, I didn't say squat about you.  You and hfb can argue you all you want but please don't put her words into my mouth.  I agree with some things she has said, but certainly not all.<br> <br>My original point was aimed at getting people like Purdy (who I presume to be a middle class white male because programmers are mostly middle class white males) to realize that most people don't have access to all the goodies he has (or I have, or you have) in this country.

Point taken - I do live a comfortable life and thus find myself not wanting to "rock the boat".  I'm a great empathizer, though and take responsibility for the benefits I've received: tithing (sp?) at church in addition to giving to other charities.  I plan on doing more, too - just haven't gone that extra step of volunteering my time to worthy causes, such as Habitat for Humanity, Special Olympics, Mentoring<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... on my list!<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

I was not trying to say you are a <b>bad</b> person.  I was just trying to put your words into perspective.  As middle class white people, we basically live in a bubble of our own making.  We don't really see racism (and other problems) because, well, we just don't <b>have</b> to if we don't want to.  They don't really affect us.

If "colored" is offensive, the NAACP should change its name, and you shouldn't use "persons of color."<br> <br>If you didn't mean to say thay America is not such a great place to live in for some people who are poor and non-white, you shouldn't have lumped them all together.  I find it offensive that you would lump all "persons of color" together and tell them that this country is not a great place for them to live.  That is what you did, and that's my point.<br> <br>And no, I wasn't putting anyone's words in your mouth.  You've before expressed the opinion that because I disagree with you on issues of race, that I haven't looked closely enough at the issues, or looked at them from the proper perspective.

The NAACP is an organization created by black people for black people.  I do not presume to tell black people what to name their organizations.  Doing so would be extremely racist, but well in line with a <b>very</b> long history of white people telling black people what they should and should not do.<br> <br>My point was not that the US is or is not a great place for poor people of people of color.  My point was simply that Purdy's statement that the US is a great place to live is very much a product of his being a middle class white male.  These are the people with the most advantages in this society (except for rich white males, of course) and so it looks pretty damn great from their (our) viewpoint.<br> <br>As to <b>you</b> personally, I do indeed think you don't understand something I do.

It's also a great country to live in if you're non-white or non-middle class.  The US is a large enough place that practically anything you say about it is going to be true to some non-trivial degree.
<p>
I don't want to get into a[nother] heated debate about what's great or horrid about these 50 states.  The US has a <i>lot</i> of good points going for it.  There are also a <i>lot</i> of things that really stink when you stop to think about them.  Perhaps your own personal moral calculus leads you to believe that there are more positives than negatives.  Perhaps the opposite is true.  But there is no one single objective way to perceive the US such that it is a great place to live, a terrible place to live or a reprehensible nation to defend.
</p><p>
In my estimation, anyone who would judge a nation of 285,000,000 based on the actions of one person, or a hundred people is an utter fool.  Focusing on the minutiae obscures the larger picture, whether it be the greatest accumulation of wealth since the invention of the Shekel, a murder trial with a questionable outcome, a vibrant alternative/sustainable energy industry, or a healthy organic food movement.  Focusing on some of the bigger issues is more worthy of discussion, whether it be about the largest donor of foreign aid, funding the basis of information economy, encouraging human rights abuses in China, or miserable turnouts at the ballot box.
</p><p>
But I'm not particularly interested in discussing that.  There's some Perl code here calling my name.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>

<p>
What are you talking about?  Is it your opinion that the US is holding these countries down?  Let's look at two of your examples:
</p><p>
1) Africa.  Not a single great nation has come out of Africa since Hannibal &amp; Cleopatra.  I'm sure Africa's "demise" had much more to do with European colonialism (all the way through WW2) than anything the US did.  Personally, I blame that bastard Scipio Africanus - it's all his fault!  Let's attack Italy!
</p><p>
2) Russia.  Hmmm...let's see.  Crushing rule by Czar, followed by Bolshevism, followed by the crushing rule and downright imperialism of Stalin, followed by 40 more years of Communism, virtual (if not literal) occupation of Eastern Europe followed by eventual collapse.  Ummm...where did we fit in again?  Oh, yeah.  We "tricked" them into trying to keep up with us militarily, thereby causing their economic collapse.  Whatever.
</p><p>
As for the "dozen other places", I'm curious as to which countries you feel we're making life miserable for (besides Iraq).</p>

Well, the American slave trade didn't exactly do any good for Africa.  Nor did US support of the South African apartheid regime.<br> <br>Russia, yes, had internal problems.  The cold war, explicitly designed to destroy the Russian economy, also didn't help.<br> <br>But here are a few others:<br> <br>- Iran, where we installed a dictator that served our (oil) interests.  That dictator's oppression was so severe that he was overthrown by a fundamentalist Islamic regime, which has been making Iran miserable ever since.

<i>Well, the American slave trade didn't exactly do any good for Africa</i>
<p>
True, but then let's keep in mind that we were still <i>Europeans</i> when we were first dealing in the slave trade.  In other words, we have plenty of company in that area.
</p><p>
<i>Nor did US support of the South African apartheid regime</i>
</p><p>
True, but then it was partially US pressure that ended it as well.  I can also tell you that the American public despised the South African regime.  And where does the South African government have its origins, hmmm?  Oh, yeah - The Netherlands.
</p><p>
<i>The cold war, explicitly designed to destroy the Russian economy, also didn't help.</i>
</p><p>
You know, I'm not really sure I buy the "let's outspend them" theory.  It's one of the theories that fits the facts in hindsight, but it sure didn't feel like it was the goal at the time.  In the meantime we were generating our own insane debt.  I'd call it a Pyrhhic victory.
</p><p>
<i>Iran</i> - Yep, I'd say we screwed up royally there.  But I'd also say that an 8 year war with Iraq was much, much more devastating to Iran than the Shah.
</p><p>
<i>Support to Israel (#1 recipient of foreign aid) in killing huge numbers of Palestinians.</i>
</p><p>
I could just as well transpose "Israel" with "Palestinians" in this sentence and it would be just as accurate.  A virtual no-win situation in my opinion, but the fact remains that the odds of us breaking ties with Israel are about as great as the odds of us breaking ties with England.  I heard on the news today that Saudi Arabia (of all countries) had a good proposal on the table.  I think it's safe to say that the world would like to see this one end the best way for both sides for all time.
</p><p>
<i>Argentina, Honduras, Guatemala</i>
</p><p>
Have to agree with you there.
</p><p>
<i>Nicaragua, where US support of the contras led to thousands of murders</i>
</p><p>
Replace "US" with "Russian" and "contras" with "Sandinistas" and you would have an equally accurate statement.
</p><p>
<i>Taiwan, where the US supported a government (the Nationalists) that killed approximate 18-28 native Taiwanese people when they first arrived and ran the country via martial law until 1988</i>
</p><p>
Would you care to tally the murder count by the Communist/Mao regime?  From dubious beginnings has emerged a strong little, uh, pseudo-nation.  I'm not sure how you think it is we're making life difficult for them.  By not forcing reassimilation into China?  Sorry, bud, but even Clinton all but said it would be World War 3 if China invaded Taiwan.
</p><p>
<i>Saudia Arabia, where we support an autocratic monarchy hated by almost all of the people in the country</i>
</p><p>
I hate these bastards as well, though I also include the harboring of Idi Amin, the worst mother fucker since Hitler, within their territory as a reason for hating them.
</p><p>
<i>Turkey, where the US supported government has massacred huge numbers of Kurds</i>
</p><p>
Old, old conflict, started long before US support ever rolled around.  Our relationship with Turkey has always been a little odd, especially when you factor in Greece.  Mainly, we started that relationship because of it's geographical importance (straits, border with ex-Soviet Union).
</p><p>
<i>Colombia, where we are supporting yet another death squad employing government, this time in the name of the drug war</i>
</p><p>
A hopeless situation.  Should we support death-squad-employing-government X, drug-money-mobster-government Y, or withdraw any and all involvement and let anarchy reign so we can be attacked by the world for doing nothing?
</p><p>
<i>Cambodia, where the US support Khmer Rouge killed over one million people!</i>
</p><p>
Don't know enough to comment.  Actually, I thought they were our enemies, so that shows you what I know, other than the fact that they were total bastards.
</p><p>
<i>These are places where either past or current US actions have led to massacres, starvation, state-sponsored terrorism, and unheard of human rights abuses, as well as the continued impovershment of people all over the world</i>
</p><p>
This is part of a disturbing trend I'm seeing in world opinion.  It seems *everything* is our fault.  It's either too much, not enough, or the wrong way.  We just can't do *anything* right, no matter how hard we try.

I'm not up on all of these events and all of their degrees of complexity (I'm still trying to get my head around the Milosevic stuff), but I think it unfair to directly associate the deaths of millions of people to the support (or lack thereof) of the US.
<p>
The US is not pulling the trigger in most of those examples, and I would hunch that it was not only the US that supported those governments or parties that led to those atrosities.  Additionally, hindsight allows us the luxury to see that they were atrosities instead of what could have been a better situation.  That's a harsh judgement to apply to any country.

I definitely think Kissinger is a war criminal.  As are Bill Clinton and Madeline Albright (Iraq) and numerous other US government officials.  Frankly, the list of people in the US government, past, and present, who should be indicted on war crimes, is simply too long to list.  And then we can go to the puppet regimes the US supported in South America and Southeast Asia, there's Ariel Sharon, and the list goes on.<br> <br>Of course, none of them will be brought to trial because it is not politically useful for the US to allow that.

<p>The US provied the technology and sold the Nazis the computing machines that made their census possible. The US also took no action until Pearl Harbor even though the NYT had front page news of the atrocities of the war. Hitler had a lot of support, even if indirectly, from the US too. Also, Finland was, as I recall, promised help from the US that never came and when faced with Russia or Germany, the latter seemed to them the lesser evil.

I would argue that genocide is more horrible (if that point hasn't been made already) than war-time casualties (oops, I mean "slaughtering").

Vietnam was a war only because the powers that be (here in the US) called it a war.  The vast  majority of people killed were Vietnamese non-combatants.<br> <br>The peasants that made up a large majority of the country pretty much all supported the Communists.  But of course a (relatively) bloodless communist takeover could not be allowed.<br> <br>So US policy was designed to kill and uproot huge numbers of peasants.  The ones who weren't killed outright by US weapons still had to survive in a country that was mined like crazy, had no infrastructure left for things like health care, and had been defoliated through the massive use of agent orange, making it all the more difficult to grow crops.<br> <br>Then after the war the US maintained an embargo against Vietnam for eighteen years, further exacerbating the already desperate situation.<br> <br>You need to do some research on what was going on beyond what you might have learned in high school.  The idea that this was a civil war in Vietnam is a joke.  The South Vietnamese government was a US puppet.  Without US support, it never would have existed and the country would like have become communist with far less suffering.<br> <br>In fact, their had already been a treaty signed between the Vietnamese and the French which provided for elections in Vietnam.  The US outright ignored this treaty because it knew that the communists would win the election.<br> <br>During the "war", the US consistently opposed any political settlement, knowing that while we were politically weak (with no popular support) we could at least beat the hell out of them with military might.  And so we did.<br> <br>The death toll in Vietnam was enormous, in the <b>millions</b>, while the US death toll was about 58,000.  Is that not a holocaust?

I have plenty of unspoken arguments against your negatives too, but I don't think it's interesting to debate them, as most people who care know that e.g. the issues of Israel, Taiwan, Saudi Arabia etc. are a lot more complex and have a lot more sides to them than you present; I'd say that those three examples are all more positive than negative, and I don't find it interesting to try to prove to you why, since you clearly want to emphasize the bad.  I just pointed out the self-evident (to most people) fact that America has done a lot of good in this post-WWII world -- again, not even attempting to weigh good vs. bad, just noting that there has been a lot of good -- and if you can't see it, well, it's a pity, I suppose.<br>
