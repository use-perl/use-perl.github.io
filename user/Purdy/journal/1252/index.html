<p>For some reason, my journal entries from yesterday didn't go through.  Oh well, you didn't miss much.  I ranted about NFS & blowing half a day trying to get that working without success.  You can see <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=481524&group_id=14&atid=200014">my support query</a> if you want and try & help.
<P>
Let's see, what else?  Oh yeah, I'm building a house.  We signed the paperwork back in early August.  Since then, it took the builder <b>2.5 weeks</b> to file the paperwork with the town of Apex (NC) and another <b>2.5 months</b> for the town of Apex to approve the new permit.  So now we're finally in business.  We have our pre-construction meeting next week.  Just bought a digital camera (Olympus 2040) to help document its progress, as well as any flaws we see.  We've already heard all kinds of horror stories - feel free to reply to this with any advice you may have (this will be our first home).
<P>
I stayed up last night 'til about 2am and had to get into work at 8am, so you can bet I'm feelin' kinda shot.  Thank goodness for coffee!  I was finishing up my next installment of <a href="http://softwaredev.earthweb.com/sdtech/article/0,,12065_900181,00.html">my column</a> and also surfin' atomfilms.com (I highly recommend the <a href="http://atomfilms.shockwave.com/af/content/atom_1403">Gangsta Rap</a> short in the Star Wars section).

<h2>Recommendation</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/pdcawley/">pdcawley</a> on 2001-11-14T14:50:27</h3>
If you haven't done so already run, don't walk to the bookstore of your choice and get hold of copies of <i>The Timeless Way of Building</i> and <i>A Pattern Language</i>, both by Christopher Alexander.
<br>
<br>Even if you don't take the advice offered, they give you a useful set of concepts and 'vocabulary' for thinking about buildings.

When I first saw those titles, I didn't know if you were responding to the right entry (thinking they were programming books specifically).  Looking over at Amazon &amp; seeing what they are, they look really cool!  I'm on my way to the bookstore to check 'em out more thoroughly.  But first... Raleigh.pm &amp; another journal entry!<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)
<p>
BTW, pdcawley - Love your pictures &amp; journal.</p>
