<p>What an AWESOME game!  I know this is late news, but I didn't wake up at 5:30am to watch the game (like I should have), rather taping it to watch after work yesterday.  So yesterday, I starved myself from Web sites so I wouldn't find out the news (unfortunately, I was doing research for a co-worker on newsweek.com and it was on their front page, so I found out early that the US won, but no score or how the game actually played).
<P>
Anyway ... WOW!  What a game!  <B>NO ONE</B> could have seen that coming and I'm proud to be an American at this point.  Last World Cup, we didn't even win a game ... this year, we win against a team that went undefeated through the European qualifiers!  Take that, Europe! *laugh*
<P>
<B>Best moment:</B> The diving header goal from Brian McBride<BR>
<B>Worst moment:</B> Giving Portugal a 2nd goal from our own player (Jeff Agoos).  I don't think a <a href="http://www.kuro5hin.org/comments/2002/4/15/63058/7049?pid=19">"Columbia"</a> will happen when he returns home, but why do I think that goal will haunt us when it comes to the 2nd stage?
<P>
Our next challenge will be Korea - a tough game to play in front of the raucous Korean home crowd and a team that sounded played/defeated Poland.
<P>

I could hardly believe it myself - especially going 3-0 up.  Good game.<br> <br>Personally I'm <b>really</b> looking forward to England vs Argentina tomorrow.  Must remember to tape it or (if I have a sudden rush of insomnia) watch it live<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

I'm also <b>really</b> looking forward to that game, as well.  I will probably take off work to watch that game live so I don't have to deprive/isolate myself again.
<p>
It's been said that Argentina are the heavy favorites for this game, looking at motivation, for the most part (as I said earlier, England didn't show up for their game against Sweden).  But great stuff comes from these teams when they match up (the top two <a href="http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com/en/pf/h/gotc/launch.html" title="yahoo.com">"Goals of the Century"</a yahoo.com> - including my favorite, the Michael Owen goal).

Unfortunately I forgot to tape the bloody England-Sweden game so I can't really comment but by all accounts England played poorly.<br> <br>I too voted for the Michael Owen goal.  Can't say I'm surprised that Maradona's effort got first place though - it <b>was</b> a classic - unlike his earlier "hand of god" goal.  I remember watching that game (as a wee 13 year old) and could not believe he got away with that.

I doubt he could.
