<div class="span8">
<p>My wife woke up this morning to a call from our MasterCard (<a href="http://www.chase.com/">Chase Bank</a> - lovely people), calling to confirm recent activity.  I thought that was odd, but I have made several large purchases recently - plane tickets to <a href="http://www.yapc.org/America/">Boca</a>, two <a href="http://www.dell.com/us/en/dhs/products/model_pda_axim5_entry.htm">Axims</a> and a server from <a href="http://www.intrex.com/">a local computer store</a>.<br/><br/>Anyway, the item that stuck out to them was a $367 charge to "Home Shopping Network."  Come to find out, HSN had called our bank to confirm the account, shipping to a Scott Stevens in Alabama (huh?).  Needless to say, we are not Scott Stevens nor did we buy anything on HSN for Scott Stevens (much less buy anything on HSN, period ;)).  So Chase is re-issuing account #'s and FedEx'ing us new cards tomorrow before we take off for YAPC.<br/><br/>Couple of things to take away from this:<ul><li>Do not use a check/debit card for online purchases.  You do not want a hacked card to affect your checking account.  It's also nice to use a regular credit card that is well-protected in terms of liability and fraud.  I use that Chase card everywhere on the internet for online purchases - I wonder who got hacked recently [and didn't tell me].</li><li>I wonder what algorithms Chase (or whomever) use for fraud detection?  Not that they were used in this case, as HSN prompted the query, but thought-provoking, nonetheless.</li><li>"Scott Stevens", whereever you are, I wouldn't be expecting a package from HSN anytime soon.  Or rather, if you get a package, it's most likely an attempt to tie you physically to the virtual fraud.  Perhaps I shouldn't be saying anything, but I highly doubt this blog is monitored.</li></ul>Cheers,<br/><br/>Jason</p>

<h2>possibly not even hacked</h2>

There are plenty of easier ways to get credit card details than hacking servers (although that is pretty easy with the number insecure ecommerce sites).
<p>
You credit card details will appear all over the shop - resturants, shops, train stations, etc.

Hmm - I use my debit card for physical transactions<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... now you're giving me some unease on that<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)

<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... remember Hanlon's Razor - <i>Never attribute to malice that which can be adequately explained by stupidity</i>.
(Although, I like to substitute incompetence for stupidity). Employing phone slaves for $6.50 an hour can lead to lots of typos.

True - but to get both the number AND expiration date<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... and perhaps the operator prompted for the CVC # on the back, too?<br> <br>Don't worry, though - my trust in humanity is far from shaken.  Got my new card today and it looks pretty cool - different and sleeker design.
