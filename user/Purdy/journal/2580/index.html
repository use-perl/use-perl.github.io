<div class="span8">
<p>Night before last (Wed), I went over to a friend's to check out their recently-purchased Nintendo GameCube.  I love keeping up with the technology side of things, but never found gaming my niche - don't get me wrong, I love to play games, but more of the board variety ... Risk, especially, though I can't seem to find friends that enjoy it as much as I do.  I also love to play simple electronic games ... you know, where you have at most a joystick and a button, maybe two.  Obviously, "KISS" never caught on within the game developer community and the "joystick" has evolved into a mass of buttons, X/Y pads, mini-joysticks, etc.  Bring back the days of Super Tecmo Bowl!  Galaga!  When I have to worry about how long or hard to push a button or variety of buttons to differ between a bullet pass and soft pass from the QB to the WR/TE, it just gets too complicated.  Sure, some of you may say more realistic.  But I'm more of a couch-QB ... where I don't want the realism or complication.
<P>
Anyway, he had some cool games (Rogue Squadron, Road Rage, Smash Brothers and NHL Hockey game) and I was impressed with their graphics and what-not.  My favorite game was Road Rage (it was a Simpsons game, actually).  I was surprised that Rogue Squadron was not multi-player - it woulda been neat to dogfight in X-Wings or collaborate on shootin' down the Death Star!
<P>
I got in the doghouse a bit because I ended up staying too long, not b/c I played games, but mostly watching my friend play Smash Brothers (for some reason, I enjoy watching people play those fighting games instead of participating myself - must be that complication thing again [I mean, com'on ... "If you press X and then Y+Z and then X again for 2 seconds, you unleash the Death Grip SuperCharge Kick O' Pain" ;)]).  Well, maybe it was that I also forgot to give our <a href="http://www.purdy.info/daisy/daisy1.html">dog</a> her ear medication the morning before.  Whatever the case, I got out of it by taking her out to sushi last night (always a plus in her book :)).
<P>

<B>Update:</B> I took my wife out for sushi ... ;)</p>

What's with that?
<br>
<br>Or am I confused again. I often am. What year is this? Is George VI still king?

*laugh* - took the wife out for sushi... the dog may like sushi, but being a Golden Retriever, she's happy with rice cakes, too<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... and rice cakes are cheaper!<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)

<h2>Rogue Squadron</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/vek/">vek</a> on 2002-02-01T14:53:26</h3>
absolutely rocks - worth the price of the Gamecube alone (IMHO)!  I haven't played it much lately though as I'm currently addicted to Jak &amp; Daxter on the PS2 - now <b>that game</b> rocks.

Yup, RS was indeed a cool game, but I couldn't get past the attack the Death Star mission, in the trenches.. and on Hoth, how to fire off the Tow Cable.  Of course, I didn't play it but for 15 minutes.
<p>
The graphics were amazing... things have come a long way since the Atari 2400, my first foray into the console games.  Pong, anyone?

<i>but I couldn't get past the attack the Death Star mission</i>
<br>
<br>-Destroy <b>all</b> the towers.
<br>-Destroy <b>all</b> the tie fighters (using the targeting computer helps, although if you want a medal you'll want to use this <b>very</b> infrequently).
<br>-Fly down the Death Star trench, destory the laser cannons, destroy the tie fighters, shoot Darth Vader's tie fighter.
<br>-When you get somewhat to the end of the trench use your proton torpedo (B button I think).
<br>
<br> <i>and on Hoth, how to fire off the Tow Cable</i>
<br>
<br>-Fly near an AT-AT - about half way up a leg is a good a point as any.
<br>-Press the 'B' button (your tow cable will automatically attach itself to the AT-AT).
<br>-The camera angle will now change and all you have to do is circle around the AT-AT 3 or 4 times.  Voila - dead AT-AT<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)
<br>
<br>My start with computer games was a friends Commodore Vic20 (remember those).  You could get a 16k ram upgrade cartride and everything.  The first video game console/computer I owned was a Commodore 64 - a <b>substantial</b> upgrade from the Vic20.
<br>
<br>Of course, if you lived in England back in the early 80's you would also be aware of the Sinclair Spectrum (which absolutely sucked) but was quite popular for a while - gave the C64 a run for it's money as I recall (well I was only 11 in 1984!).
