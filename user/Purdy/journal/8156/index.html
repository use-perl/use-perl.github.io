<p>Got my latest issue of <a href="http://www.eweek.com">eWeek</a> and the cover has two headlines: <B>Open-Source Insecurity?</B> and <B>Microsoft puts meat behind security push</B> ... let's see ... they're talking about the OpenSSL worm that already had a patch out BEFORE the worm was let loose and we've yet to receive a fix for Microsoft's lousy certificate-spoofing bug.
<P>
In the article, they put together a cute little table of OS's and the # of patches that have been released (<I>Source: Vendor Web sites</I>).  For Red Hat Linux 7.3, they say 35.  For Windows XP Pro, they say 6.  6 ?!  Are they smoking crack?  The SP1 for XP Pro contained several (more than 10, for sure) patches all-included and today, I downloaded two more.
<P>
Then ya got this quote from Gene Spafford, professor of CS @ Purdue University:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CITE>
"Linux is awful.  There are no design specs.  Everybody and their half-brother who knows some [C code] writes code for it, and they all have the same lack of knowledge.  It's who writes it and whether it's planned [that makes a difference], not who looks at the code."
</CITE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Note to self: Sign Gene up for Microsoft's security alerts... 1000 times. ;)
<P>
Well, I guess it shouldn't come as a surprise, as Microsoft has an inside front-cover spread and another 2-page spread in the middle - I'm sure they can flex their advertising spending dollars onto the "objective" editors.
