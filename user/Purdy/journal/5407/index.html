<p>After reading Matt's <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/Matts/journal/5404">journal entry</a> about Episode 2, I wonder if Lucas will break Episode 3 into more than one movie... there is a lot of plot development left to branch Ep2 to Ep4 and it would be a way to keep the moolah rolling in, of course.
<P>
Not that I'm for such a thing, but I just wonder if that's an idea being passed around Skywalker Ranch.

Oh, and you forgot the scene where Luke's mom prophetically says, "Gee.  I wonder if these two will ever end up on the wrong end of a love triangle because I separate them...naaaaah."
<p>
Doesn't seem like that couldn't all happen in one movie.  Might be a little crowded, sure, but what the hell.
</p><p>
A lot of that doesn't have to be established as such; it just has to be hinted at properly.  "What are you doing with the babies, so Vader won't get them?" "Obi-Wan is rescuing the boy.  The girl is going to Alderan..." etc.
</p><p>
Counting the birth scene (where Anakin steals the baby boy, we'll say for the moment) that's two scenes that tie up 4 points on the list.   The rest of the movie could be nothing but action sequences involving fights (where Jedi are slain and Anakin is nearly killed) and medical scenes involving the helmet and suit, plus a little Boba Fett thrown in to keep the Boba stuff going, and it would minimally tie things up.</p>

They've already set the scene for a bunch of these. Leia's "Father" has already shown up, though they didn't name him. Jimmy Smits in Episode II played "Bail Organa".<p>

Lucas has an advantage. He knows that we've already seen episode 4. All he has to do for a bunch of these is to just nudge the plot in that direction and leave the intervening 20 years between 3 and 4 to the viewer.</p><p>

The only thing I hope for is that we do bring Han Solo into the story in some way. He's already given nods to Boba Fett, Jabba and Greedo, as well as Uncle Owen and Aunt Beru. He should be able to bring a few more in, and none are more important than han.</p>

<p>To be honest, I think all that could be done in a two hour movie, although the thought of having multiple movies is nice.  A few thoughts:</p>

<p> <i>I miss anything?</i> </p>

<p>Yoda and Obi-Wan go into hiding in their respective new homes.  I sure hope we see this.</p>

<p> <i>A young Han Solo will possibly be introduced.</i> </p>

<p>This seems doubtful, although Han is probably the most missed character from the original trilogy.  Han is only a few years older than the twins.  Episode II is probably not going to show the twins as anything older than infants, so Han would have to be under ten years old (probably closer to four).</p>

<p> <i>All good Jedi except Yoda and Obi-Wan are slain</i> </p>

<p>I have a fear that we're not going to see this; that we'll see Anakin turn to the dark side and the Emperor's rise to power, but the "great purge" will only be planned or hinted at during the movie, and occur between III and IV.  I hope we see it, though.  Leads to some incredible possiblities.</p>

Don't forget that we saw quite a few Jedi go down in the droid battle.  If they do show the slaughter of the rest of the Jedi, I wonder how they're gonna handle those kid Jedi's...

<p>Lucas has said that Episode III will be "very dark"; to the point that he thinks some of us may not like it.  That may include wholesale slaughter of the younglings; who knows?</p>

<p>I've wondered if the great purge has already started behind the scenes.  Mace Windu said he would take "our remaining Jedi" to Geonosis.  Had a bunch of Jedi disappeared, or were they all out on lunch break?  If the number of Jedi fighting on Geonosis represents "all the Jedi left," that's not near as many Jedi as I thought were in existence.  It would appear to be only one order of magnitude more than the council (and I don't think there's one Jedi council member for every ten Jedi).  For that matter, how did Master Sifo-Desis (or whatever his name is) die?  Accident, "accident," open combat with a Sith, natural causes?</p>

<p>Read a timeline yesterday that suggested the Jedi's numbers were depleted by the (recent, but centuries-old) code of one padawan per master.</p>
