<div class="span8">
<p>So I was on #cgiapp (irc.perl.org) and Cees Hek taught me a few things, one involving lists, arrays and scalars.<br/><br/>Have you ever tried this?<code>
@a=('one','two','three'); $b = @a; print $b;</code><br/><br/>So what's the output?  '3' ... I knew that and my world was safe & sheltered.  Then Cees threw this one at me:<code>
$b = ('one','two','three');print $b;</code><br/><br/>What's that output?  '3'?  ... Nope, it's 'three', the last element of the list.<br/><br/><i>insert sound of head exploding</i><br/><br/>Before moving on, I think this is a good example of how such a truth of life can really alter your worldview.  Not just in Perl, but when you learn something new like that, it really breaks your grip on "reality" and takes a moment (or two) to readjust and get a new grip.  I encourage a good shake-up every once in a while.<br/><br/>Ok, so then I was head-coding while playing with <a href="http://www.purdy.info/gallery/album46">Meredith (she's so cute)</a>, getting around a CSV file that I will need to import into a database and it has rows with ID #'s and then a column in a row for other ID #'s that are the same 'entity'.  So I plan on consolidating them into my shiny new relational db.  So I'll need something to determine if the ID # is the minimal # of the set - if so, it's a new 'entity' record.  Otherwise, associate the new record w/ the minimal number.<br/><br/>So I'll have the ID # and a list of other ID #'s and I need to know if it's the smallest.<br/><br/>So then I said to myself ... what if I used that concept that Cees taught me w/ a reverse sort?  Like:
<code>if ( $id_number == reverse sort @ids )</code><br/><br/>There are some context issues there that I couldn't (and still don't all that well) understand.  Cees nailed it, though:
<code>if ( $id_number == @{[reverse sort @ids]}[0..$#ids] )</code><br/><br/>Pretty cool, huh?  I call it the Hek-Purdy min().  Or maybe "a Hek of a Purdy-good min() function" (helps if you say that in a Southern accent ;)).<br/><br/>Now this is not very readable or maintainable, so I don't plan on world-wide deployment - just my import script ... for now. ;)<br/><br/>Peace,<br/><br/>Jason</p>

You went a very convoluted route to do this:<blockquote> <div><tt>if ( $id_number == (sort @ids)[0] )</tt></div> </blockquote>Learn about literal slice: (LIST)[INDICIES].  We document it in Learning Perl.

*grin* - yeah, I know.  I should have put a * next to "good" - I'm not endorsing that as THE way: TIMTOWTDI and all that.  And your approach is definitely cleaner<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... I was just thinking about how to incorporate what I learned about scalarizing a list.<br><br>Peace,<br><br>Jason

</i></div> </blockquote>
<p>
That code is very confusing.  Sorta like taking a flight from NY to LA by via Johannesburg and Perth.  Why not just grab the smallest element of the list?
</p> <blockquote> <div><tt>use List::Util qw(min);<br> <br>if ( $id_number == min(@ids) )</tt></div> </blockquote> <p>
If you <i>needed</i> to avoid <tt>List::Util</tt> for some odd reason, I don't know why you would sort a list, reverse it and take the last element (in a most convoluted fashion) when you could just:
</p> <blockquote> <div><tt>if ( $id_number == (reverse sort @ids)[-1] )</tt></div> </blockquote> <p>
Or even more clearly:
</p> <blockquote> <div><tt>if ( $id_number == (sort @ids)[0] )</tt></div> </blockquote>

*nod* - agreed.  See prev. comment - I simply wanted to apply what Cees taught me about scalarizing a list.<br><br>Hmmm -- maybe this won't even see the light of day in my import script now.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)<br><br>Peace,<br><br>Jason

<p>I thought it was common knowledge that there is no such thing as a list in scalar context.<nobr> <wbr></nobr><tt>:-)</tt> </p>

<p>The context issues are particularly important when you <code>return</code> things. <code>my $foo = bar();</code> will produce a different result with a <code>bar</code> function that does <code>return @arr;</code> vs one that does <code>return ( $baz1, $baz2, $baz3 )</code>. This is even more insidious if you do something like <code>return grep quux($_), @arr</code>.</p>

<p>Always mind your context.</p>

<p>Your particular example, btw, besides all the issues already pointed out by others, should at least be written without that anonymous array in there:</p> <blockquote> <div><tt>if ( $id_number == ( reverse sort @ids )[ 0<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.. $#ids ] ) {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; #<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...<br>}</tt></div> </blockquote> <p>which then leads to the further simplifications <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/ziggy" title="perl.org">ziggy</a perl.org> pointed out.</p>
