<p>As an un-objective writer (I admit it - it's hard to be objective when inundated with the US media/POV everyday), I'm fully behind our President in whatever course our country (and its allies) takes with Iraq.  It's easy for me to say that, since it will have relatively little impact on me, personally (though I may pay more for gas and my stocks may take a hit).  I've said it before: I believe our leaders are operating on a greater knowledge of world affairs than I, and their decisions are just and right.<br/><br/>It would be great to have an unified stance on Iraq from the rest of the world, but that will never happen (try to get a room full of your friends to agree on political/religious matters).<br/><br/>The conservative talk shows here are quick to point out that France & Germany aren't falling into line because of power/money issues, but can you blame them for looking out for themselves?  The US is currently doing that, too.<br/><br/>I do, however, find disturbing the report I heard (again, on a conservative talk show) that France shared UN Inspection plans with Iraq Intelligence in order to ensure their investment in Iraq-based businesses and contracts would continue to be solvent.  One country should not undermine a world-unified initiative, especially one to disarm a dangerous regime.<br/><br/>So peace is great.  Anti-war demonstrations are great, too - they show that people should be allowed the right to self-expression and that they provoke our leaders to fully consider the ramifications of their decisions.<br/><br/>But evil should not go unchecked.<br/><br/>Jason</p>

Man, what a pleasure to read.  It's so nice to find such reasoned and insightful messages online.

I'd like to reply to a couple of your statements.

<blockquote><div>
I believe our leaders are operating on a greater knowledge of world affairs than I, and their decisions are just and right.
</div></blockquote>

I'd like to believe so as well.  Those in power <em>should</em> have a greater perspective through through better information.  Why can't they pass along this insight, though?  Logical arguments stand by themselves.  If there's a logical argument for the invasion of Iraq, then why isn't THAT the message being pushed by the White House?
<p>
If, during one of their daily press conferences, they said, "American people, here is evidence that Iraq is in violation of UN resolutions and International Law."-- such as Colon Powell attempted at the UN last week-- "It is our duty as members of the United Nations to enter Iraq and put them back in compliance." then I'd be satistified.
</p><p><nobr> <wbr></nobr>..But what we're doing now seems wrong.  We're part of an international community, bound by the laws that rule how nations must interact.  One nation attacking another without international mandate seems an awful lot like New York's state militia entering California to re-criminalize marijuana use.
</p><p>
Now, I realize that international law is very much in its infancy, and that there's much it doesn't cover yet, but wouldn't it be better to develop it through intellectual debate than disregard it totally?

</p><blockquote><div>

</div></blockquote>

Yeah, but should we be ready to go to war over a political/religious matter?

<p><p>
Okay, that was a bit more long winded than I meant to be.  Thanks for providing the forum!

Yeah, I've heard that too.  Accepting that that might be the case, I'd think that we could share it with leaders in France and Germany, though.  If there were convincing evidence, I'd expect them to be... well... convinced.
<p>
Of course, it might be that there isn't <i>convincing</i>, smoking gun-style evidence, but just a lot of circumstantial evidence.  Even then though, if there's enough of it to convince Washington, there should be enough to convince other allies.
</p><p>
Man, it's hard to argue a case either way when you're just going on the reactions of others and not the actual information.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:/

</p><blockquote><div>

</div></blockquote>

Yeah, I guess there really isn't much of a distinction between "forced disarmament" and "war".  The latter is just a means to achieve the former.  I'd feel a lot better about it if it were a UN mandate, though.  Still feels like we're violating that ethereal "international law."

<blockquote><div>

</div></blockquote>

Yeah, I'm glad it's getting as much coverage as it is.  No one's been providing any "what-if" scenarios.  I think most people think that we're just going to go in, clean up the place, and leave.

<p>
After giving a feather-slap to Microsoft's wrist for criminal misuse of monopoly power, and extending the Mouse's copyright beyond my likely lifetime; I find it difficult to believe that any policy puts <b>just and right</b> on the priority list - it is <b>what is best for General's Bullmoose and Bullwinkle?</b> that is clearly of the highest concern.</p>

Welcome to the US/American way: capitalism &amp; democracy - where the dollar is king and we the people have the power to change things, if we have money to throw at the people we put in power (see all the loops in there?).<br> <br>You bring up two domestic issues that most of us agree were mishandled, and there are likely more.  You could also add historical international issues (Vietnam, Iran-Contra, Bay of Pigs Invasion, etc).  "Just and right" are subjective to those that hand down the decisions that affect the issues, but probably <b>more so</b> to those that observe and judge those decisions.  It sure is easy to be the backseat driver when the weight of the world isn't on your shoulders <b>and</b> you don't have all of the information available (or your information is biased by the provider of the information you do have).<br> <br>I can't say anything to reassure <b>you</b>, except you have the power to affect policies by your willingness to gather groups of voters and communicate with your representatives.<br> <br>Jason

<h2>Its about isreal stupid!</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/TeeJay/">TeeJay</a> on 2003-02-11T10:05:05</h3>
This war has everything to do with isreal and nothing to do with Weapons of mass Destruction.
<p>
Any weapons that Iraq has were sold to them by the US, and the UK, or given freely - remember Donald Rusmfield was still giving Iraq weapons just before the last gulf war.
</p><p>
The reason we are going to war is to protect our interests in kuwait (not democratic) and isreal (a racist military state in contravention of UN resolutions).
</p><p>
If this was really about the UN being taken seriously then China would be taken to task about its occupation of Tibet and Isreal would be held to account for its breaches of UN resolutions and war crimes.
</p><p>
If this was really about terrorism then Saudi Arabia would be the target.
