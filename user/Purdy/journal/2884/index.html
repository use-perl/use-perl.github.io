<p>Phase 2-4 went through flawlessly (at least in Casey's perception :)), though next time, I will use a different florist.
<P>
<B>Phase 2:</B> Have flowers delivered to Casey's work with a handwritten personal note (not ordered over the phone/net).  I asked the florist to put together a collection of pink flowers (not roses {Casey doesn't like 'em}) and ended up with the florist (cheap) collection of carnations, babys breath and greenery.  NOT what I had in mind.  Next time I will have to do it myself...
<P>
<B>Phase 3:</B> Came home from work with a small box - it was a pair of earrings that I got from <a href="http://www.baumdiamonds.com/">a local jewelry store</a> (where I also got our engagement ring and pair of perl {oops, pearl ;)} earrings the year before).  They were something new & unique - grape garnets, which are almost a pinkish/purplish hue (can you tell that pink is Casey's favorite color?).  I had them reseat the stones in white gold, since Casey's also not a fan of yellow gold.  So the end result was something very neat, unique and customized for her.  I noticed she wore them on the way out to work this morning. :)
<P>
<B>Phase 4:</B> Dinner at <a href="http://www.chefjohncafe.com">Chef John's Cafe</a>, which is co-incidentally right around the corner.  Awesome meal - it was six courses: 1) baby spinach salad, 2) lobster bisque, 3) burgandy mushroom appetizer, 4) here, we both chose the filet mignon entree - a pile of garlic mashed potatoes surrounded by wilted baby spinach cooked in a vinagrette sauce, then topped with a sauted portabello mushroom, then topped with a filet mignon cooked to perfection and wrapped with a slice of bacon and lastly, topped with gorgonzola cheese... mouth watering yet? ;), 5) choice of dessert: Casey chose the regular Creme Brulee and I chose the chef's innovative chocolate Creme Brulee (the other choice was tiramasu), and lastly 6) an after-dinner mint & coffee.  All enjoyed with an excellent bottle of Pinot Noir. :)
<P>
Oh yeahhh ... so I've survived the first special day ... next up, we have her birthday and then our anniversary.  Wish me luck! :)
<P>
