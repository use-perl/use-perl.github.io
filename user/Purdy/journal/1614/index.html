<p>The movie is coming out next week and the local awesome cinema (the awesome one w/ surround digital sound & stadium seating) is starting to sell tix today.  Casey (my wife) is heading over to the cinema to pick up tickets for us and some friends after work.  I'm on page 359 (out of 525), which is at the point in the book where they're still at Elrond's council.  They've been there for a while and I'm wondering if they're ever going to get going to Mount Doom. ;)

Oh, an interesting tidbit, the book I'm reading is a paperback published by Ballantine Books.  It says 'THE AUTHORIZED EDITION' on the front cover.  And there's a forward by Tolkien in which he says:<BR>

It seems to me a grave discourtesy, to say no more, to issue my book without even a polite note informing me of the project... However that may be, this paperback edition and no other has been published with my consent and co-operation.  Those who approve of courtesy (at least) to living authors will purchase it and no other.  And if the many kind readers who have encouraged me with their letters will add to their courtesy by referring friends or equirers to Ballantine Books, I shall be very grateful.

Interesting... I guess there was a black market on LotR books back then (this paperback edition was published in 1965).
