<p>Lots of stuff to go over today ... needless to say, I've been quite busy with life and work, so I haven't had the chance to update my journal.
<P>
First, I gave up on the Patriotism thread - I believe we beat it to death and that I either don't have enough information or cannot argue effectively against autarch.  I do believe there's some shade of truth to pudge's comment that autarch is too pessimistic.  Anyway, enough of that.
<P>
In other news, I've installed <a href="http://gallery.sourceforge.net">Gallery</a> on <a href="http://www.purdy.info">my Web server</a> and have organized my house photos - very neat software!  Check out <a href="http://www.purdy.info/gallery/index.php">my gallery</a> and let me know whatcha think.  I also downloaded and played with some panoramic software and took a panoramic shot of the new kitchen and family room.  I plan on doing more of that - that's neat!
<P>
The house is coming along - sheetrock's up and I'm busy with lining up movers, insurance, inspections, etc.  It's really exciting, looking forward to moving in.
<P>
Working on a Palm Web Clipping Application for our Web site and Palm users - that's kinda fun, especially when you get the "oooh"'s and "aaaahhh"'s from your co-workers.  We plan on shipping it next month, so I've got some time to make it fancy and interactive... for our 2 users, I bet. ;) (that's me being cynical again ... sorry)
<P>

Or maybe, just maybe, there's some small grain of truth to some of the things I said?<br> <br>I gave you lots of concrete examples of US foreign policies which led directly to massive suffering.  In fact, most of these policies were _designed_ to do so.<br> <br>If you don't believe me I can certainly refer you to some good books.
