<div class="span8">
<p>Went to my 10-year high school reunion this weekend (<a href="http://www.purdy.info/gallery/phs92">pictures</a> - again, I LOVE our digital camera).  It was great seeing folks that I haven't seen in over 10 years, but also sad in knowing that there are great people out there that I could/should have been in better touch with.
<P>
When I was younger, I looked at having a successful reunion only if I could roll in with a Bill Gates situation (billionaire, yada yada yada), but as I grew older, "success"'es definition has changed.  I'm living very well, happily married, great friends, awesome dog and financially fit.  Sure, more money would be great, but the money itself doesn't bring happiness.
<P>
Anyway, I'm just spoutin' out now ... our high school valedictorian/salutatorian were no-shows.  The salutatorian lives on the West Coast now, and I imagine he didn't or couldn't see the benefits of attending over its cost... great guy - I wish he did show up.  The valedictorian is another story - for some reason, I hated this guy - he & I were intensely competitive.  With his no-show, it stirred up speculation on his exact story.  I heard he was 1) a DJ in Atlanta, 2) lived somewhere on the West Coast, and 3) lived outside Raleigh [nearby] with a wife & two kids and didn't finish medical school.  Whatever the case, I'm over our "fued" now - if you're out there Joe, I hope you're happy & doing well.
<P>
