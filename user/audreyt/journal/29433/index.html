<p>(Two-sentence summary: I intend to relicense the Pugs internals code (i.e. the bin/pugs binary) to the MIT license, and only if fellow contributors are happy with that.  Everything else under the Pugs tree is unaffected, and the the "compilation-right disclaimer" in README does not affect any code committed in Pugs in any way.)
<hr>
<p>I apologize that I've not conveyed the scope of licensing to our
contributors properly, causing a lot of confusion.&nbsp; While I have been
saying &quot;only the <em>src/</em> tree will be affected&quot; from the start, I did not clarify that the <em>src/</em> here explicitly means the <a href="http://svn.openfoundry.org/pugs/src/">src/</a> directory in the Pugs repository, containing Haskell/C/Perl6 code that builds the main <em>pugs</em> executable -- i.e. it's Pugs's internals code.</p>
<p>I'm really, really sorry to cause people misparsing it as the &quot;Pugs
source tree&quot;.&nbsp; All other subdirectories, such as t/, examples/, perl5/ ext/,
doc/ and util/, remains exactly in the same licensing situation
(Artistic 2.0b5/GPL) as they were.&nbsp; Please see the <a href="http://svn.openfoundry.org/pugs/README">README</a> file for the full details, as well as my <a href="http://use.perl.org/comments.pl?sid=31298&cid=47399">public apology</a> to chromatic.</p>

<p>So, to reiterate again:</p>

<ul><li>For Pugs contributors working on non-src/ directories, such as modules, tests, examples or documentations, <em>nothing</em> has changed in the licensing situation, and there is no plan at all to change them.</li>

<li>For Pugs contributors who have checked in src/, I would like to survey if you are okay with releasing your previous and future work under the <a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php">MIT license</a>.&nbsp; If you are explicitly not okay, I'd like to know why.</li>

<li>Chromatic has requested that his work be pulled out from the src/ directory because he was unwilling to release it under SQLite's terms.&nbsp; However, he later amended that he would be comfortable with the MIT license.</li>

<li>As my intention with src/ was merely allowing maximum reuse, I'm certainly happy to change to the MIT license's terms; I have reflected this change in the Pugs README.</li>

<li>
The README does not change src/'s licensing currently; nothing will take effect until the next Pugs release, which will happen only after sufficient discussion time for src/ contributors to voice their opinions.
</li>
</ul>

<p>Aside from the src/ directory, I am uncomfortable with using Artistic license as whole-distribution <em>compilation copyright license</em>, because according to TPF, that may make it illegal to distribute Darren Duncan's <a href="http://svn.openfoundry.org/pugs/ext/Rosetta/lib/Rosetta.pm">Rosetta.pm</a> module (GPL2+) along with Pugs, and I <em>may</em> have already been guilty for doing that for the past Pugs releases, just like Ruby people <em>may</em> be criminal for that with their <a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/doxygen/1.8.4/regex_8c-source.html">regex.c</a> (LGPL2+).</p>

<p>Because of this, I still wish to disclaim my compilation copyright, which basically means there is no <em>global</em> license that covers all of Pugs's subdirectory contents. This does not affect any contributed code in any way, and new commits in non-src/ trees are still under the Artistic2.0b5/GPL license by default, unless explicitly marked otherwise in that subdirectory or file.</p>

<p>Again, sorry for the confusion raised around this matter. I wish my English was more clear and succint...</p>
