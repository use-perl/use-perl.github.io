<p><p>It's been a long time since I wrote, and I keep thinking about small things to write about but can't bring myself to do it because I'm (beyond) overwhelmed with work and also volunteer stuff so I'm delaying writing.</p>

<p>Still, next week I have an upcoming lecture about Programming Red Flags. This is a subject I've mentioned in a previous post and already did such a lecture (based on MJD's one on Google Video)</p>

<p>This upcoming Sunday, I will be lecturing on this at the Tel Aviv Open Source Club, an Israeli group of open source enthusiasts, which meets on a monthly basis to host various talks and lectures on open source related issues, such as Gabor's Perl 6 beginner tutorials and Padre lecture, Fring CTO on Fring technology and infrastructure and others as well.</p>

<p>Shlomi Fish, who organizes these meetings, has been working hard (as always) on organizing and advertising this upcoming lecture and I would like to thank him for the hard work. Not just for this, but for all the other meetings I've had the pleasure of attending.</p>

<p>I intend to have slides for the lecture in English so I could upload them to a website afterwards for peer viewing.</p>

<p>If anyone had read my post on my previous Red Flags lecture material and finds the concept interesting, you're welcome to come! I'm going to cover more things than just the previous post material and sharpen things a little. Even though I'm covering examples in Perl, the issues are known in most other languages and the solutions are usually the same. That means that if you don't program in Perl, this would still probably cover much of the things in your chosen programming language as well, and you should consider coming.</p>

<p>See you there,<br/>
Sawyer.</p></p>

Yes, I do believe there will be slides, and I intend to upload them, and post a link in a new post.
