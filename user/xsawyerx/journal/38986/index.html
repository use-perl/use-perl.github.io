<p><p>Recently there had been a lot of small bits I wanted to mention, but I don't have the time. Also, I'm never quite confident that they would interest anyone.</p>
<p>One thing I did find extremely interesting is <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Net::SFTP::Server">Net::SFTP::Server</a>. A long time ago when I wrote Test::SFTP, I had a problem with SFTP giving me weird results and getting confused about extreme usage cases of Net::SFTP, so I had decided to write a testing module. However, Net::SFTP has the same problems as Net::Perl::SSH of very long and difficult dependencies, not getting updated too frequently and not having a normal testing suite. Test::SFTP itself doesn't have a testing suite (which I should be ashamed of, I know) because I didn't know testing as good as I know these days but mostly because I had no idea how to test it really. I wrote simple examples but couldn't be sure I wouldn't cause damage with them.</p>
<p>My conclusion was that we need some sort of SSH daemon and SFTP daemon modules, and we could run tests through them. That will also help me test testing modules that I write against them. Alas, this is a _very_ difficult task or at least very time and energy-consuming. I definitely wasn't up for the job. But I always hoped the module would get written.</p>
<p>Enter Salvador Fandino Garcia! I gotta say I really love this guy. He's written a lot of excellent modules (most recently that I use is Net::OpenSSH). Apparently Mr. Garcia is now working on yet another great module called Net::SFTP::Server which is an SFTP server!</p>
<p>Since Salvador writes dynamic modules which you can plug in and out all over the place, that means a LOT to us! Several uses would be:</p>
<ul>
<li>an infrastructure to test SFTP modules (Net::SFTP::Foreign, possible Net::OpenSSH at some point)</li>
<li>a POE SFTP server!</li>
<li>embedded SFTP server in a script, easy to deploy for specific (temporary?) uses</li>
<li>since the SFTP server is in Perl, you'll be able to hook up additional possibilities even easier</li>
</ul>
<p>So, to Salvador Fandino Garcia: thank you!</p></p>
