<p><p>I have a WD Elements USB hard drive. I recently tried to create a 50GB file on it. It didn't work.</p>
<p>All USB disks these days (that I know personally, at least) use FAT32 as their FS. Really? Are we still with the Windows 98/98SE/ME compatibility mode? Why? Who uses these arcane systems and why can't these people progress to this century and use XP? Someone already wrote support for NTFS on Windows 98 (JFGI), you can capsule it in the USB (instead of all the other useless crap they stick in it) for these oldschool legacy guys/girls on completely outdated machines.</p>
<p>And if you need it for the DVD/DVR/car radio, reformat it. Or, here's an idea: leave the 1GB - 16GB USB sticks with FAT32 and the 50GB and up (sizes that car radios and DVDs can't read anyway) with NTFS. Not that I personally use Windows, I don't, but NTFS can be accessed on *nix on userland with ntfs3g, so why not.</p>
<p>I'm just mad I didn't think of it before and had to work for two days to move everything out, reformat it, and move everything back.</p>
<p>Do you know how much time it takes for NTFS to reformat 250GB? Too freaking long! I'm too used to reasonable file systems like Ext3, ReiserFS and XFS.</p>
