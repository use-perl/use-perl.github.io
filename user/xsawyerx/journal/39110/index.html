<div class="span8">
<p><p>We can't stop laughing at this at $work. Apparently PHP decided to add <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/control-structures.goto.php">goto</a> control structure!</p>

<p>So you say "okay, on the plus side, at least they remembered a really basic control structure" but then you say "who the hell uses goto in anything that _isn't_ assembly or _perhaps_ condensed C [that isn't a really oldschool person]?!"</p>

<p><a href="http://www.procata.com/blog/archives/2004/07/29/goto-in-php/">Some people</a> mentioned a few things good with GOTOs, and here is my 2 cents on them:</p>

<ul>
  <li><u>Useful for error handling:</u> did any of you heard of <i>structured code</i>? perhaps heard of <b>logging</b>?</li>
  <li><u>Useful for writing parsers:</u> I would use some better coding conventions for this like function referencing, dispatch tables and others to write a parser, but not goto. writing parsers with goto is just abusing an arcane control structure for something advanced ones are better used to maintain readability and workflow. besides, who the hell writes parsers in PHP? </li>
  <li><u>Can be faster than other control structures:</u> are you freaking kidding me? you're using a DYNAMIC LANGUAGE. you have performance hit by even echoing a hello world, but you're worried about a goto being a <b>bit</b> faster than a nested if()?</li>
</ul>

<p>Remember when I started by asking <i>"who the hell uses goto in anything that _isn't_ assembly or _perhaps_ condensed C?!"</i>? After asking one of our PHP developers that question, I spit out another question without noticing: "Do they [the PHP developers themselves] have a lot of use for goto in PHP code they write?" and right after I thought "Do they write a lot of goto in C?"</p>
<p>Thus...</p>
<pre>
$ grep goto -r php-5.2.9 | wc -l
21848
</pre>
<p>But then I wondered...</p>
<pre>
$ grep goto -r perl-5.10.0 | wc -l
2513
</pre>
<p>Here's some more info:</p>
<address>(php has also extensions and a ton-load of documentation)</address>
<pre>
$ find php-5.2.9 -type f -iname '*.c' -or -iname '*.cpp' -or -iname '*.h' -exec cat {} \; | wc -l
149352
$ find php-5.2.9/win32/ php-5.2.9/Zend/ php-5.2.9/main/ -type f -iname '*.c' -or -iname '*.cpp' -or -iname '*.h' -exec cat {} \; | wc -l

<h2>Worse is better, obviously</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/nicholas/">nicholas</a> on 2009-06-10T10:11:16</h3>
<p>Sadly <code>goto</code> is a useful construction in C, because the flow control primitives are, well, far more primitive than Perl. For example, you can only break out of the innermost loop.</p><p>Perl's <code>goto</code> has something that isn't offered by C or PHP - <a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/perlfunc.html#goto-%26NAME" title="perl.org"> <code>goto &amp;NAME</code> </a perl.org>. That form is really the only form that anyone should be using in Perl code, and then only when they know what they're doing and why. I don't know PHP, but either it has flow control structures as powerful as Perl's, in which case <code>goto</code> is not needed, or the flow control structures themselves should have been enhanced, rather than adding <code>goto</code>. Either way, what they did is daft.</p><p>Your stats don't line up. You're grepping all files, not just C code initially, and I don't believe that your find commands do what you expect.</p><dl> <dt>Perl</dt><dd><blockquote><div><p> <tt>$ find perl-5.10.0 -name ext -prune -o '(' -type f -iname '*.c' -or -iname '*.cpp' -or -iname '*.h' ')' -exec cat {} \; | wc -l<br>231417<br>$ find perl-5.10.0 -name ext -prune -o '(' -type f -iname '*.c' -or -iname '*.cpp' -or -iname '*.h' ')' -exec cat {} \; | egrep '\bgoto\b' | wc -l<br>1216<br>$ find perl-5.10.0 '(' -type f -iname '*.c' -or -iname '*.cpp' -or -iname '*.h' -or -iname '*.xs' ')' -exec cat {} \; | wc -l<br>293114<br>$ find perl-5.10.0 '(' -type f -iname '*.c' -or -iname '*.cpp' -or -iname '*.h' -or -iname '*.xs' ')' -exec cat {} \; | egrep '\bgoto\b' | wc -l<br>1340</tt></p></div> </blockquote></dd><dt>PHP</dt><dd><blockquote><div><p> <tt>$ find php-5.2.9/win32/ php-5.2.9/Zend/ php-5.2.9/main/ -type f '(' -iname '*.c' -or -iname '*.cpp' -or -iname '*.h' ')' -exec cat {} \; | wc -l<br>120833<br>$ find php-5.2.9/win32/ php-5.2.9/Zend/ php-5.2.9/main/ -type f '(' -iname '*.c' -or -iname '*.cpp' -or -iname '*.h' ')' -exec cat {} \; | egrep '\bgoto\b' | wc -l<br>201<br>$ find php-5.2.9 -type f '(' -iname '*.c' -or -iname '*.cpp' -or -iname '*.h' ')' -exec cat {} \; |&nbsp; wc -l<br>783305<br>$ find php-5.2.9 -type f '(' -iname '*.c' -or -iname '*.cpp' -or -iname '*.h' ')' -exec cat {} \; | egrep '\bgoto\b'|&nbsp; wc -l<br>11699</tt></p></div> </blockquote></dd></dl><p>So most of PHP's C <code>goto</code>s are in extensions, whereas most of Perl's are in the core.

<p>Thanks for providing more accurate (or.. much more accurate) finds</p><p>I also liked the explanation you gave on the use of gotos. I had a discussion about that with a colleague (who is a Python programmer) and we got around to labels and I tried to explain that Perl has label-aware loop commands. That you can <code>last</code> to a label. In PHP, you can <code>continue</code> an amount of loops outside (<code>continue 3</code> would exit 3 loops above) while apparently in Python you can't do either, only <code>break</code> and <code>loop</code>.</p><p>I guess what I'm saying is that there's a lot of ways to peel an onion (I know at least two!), and a lot of ways to construct a better workflow in dynamic programming languages, but the language developers have to think that a programmer might want/need it and then provide it. Thus, as you put it (but I'll rephrase), either PHP isn't good enough to overcome goto or they've added something that isn't required for no good reason (since it's not required).</p><p>The only time I've personally ever used goto was assembly programming</p>

<h2>A quick plug for ack</h2>

For those who don't use ack, this is exactly the sort of thing ack was designed to do easily.<blockquote><div><p> <tt>find perl-5.10.0 -name ext -prune -o '(' -type f -iname '*.c' -or -iname '*.cpp' -or -iname '*.h' ')' -exec cat {} \; | egrep '\bgoto\b' | wc -l</tt></p></div> </blockquote><p>is just</p><blockquote><div><p> <tt>ack --cc --cpp -w goto perl-5.10.0 | wc -l</tt></p></div> </blockquote><p>--cc means "C source and headers only", --cpp is "C++ source and headers only", -w means "word only".
</p><p>
Just install CPAN package App::Ack.</p>
