<p><p>Here are some ideas I have floating around. I really don't have any spare time to implement them, so I feel like I can't really ask for anything of the authors, but I feel like sharing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A fork of Module::Starter that will use File::ShareDir to store the templates. That way I could access it and change it. I find inline POD very disruptive.</li>
  <li>On that note, perhaps a script or something to tear the POD out of files, and perhaps create a link for an online tool that does that for modules on CPAN. I view the source often, and I would like to reach just the code, not the user documentation POD. Also, syntax highlighting in CPAN "Source" view would be quite helpful.</li>
  <li>Put use.perl.org on Git or SVN and start a fund to help pay for some designer (preferably from the Perl community like Andy Wardley or Jon Allen) to redo the website. Please oh god please!</li>
  <li>Fix use.perl.org so I when I login it returns to where I was so I don't have to crawl back there from the main page. It is so god damn annoying.</li>
  <li>Patch POE::Component::Generic to encapsulate the internal object in the Session, so you won't have to put it in an attribute or stuff it in the data hashref.</li>
  <li>Create the ::Simple interface to Devel::Declare. I have no idea what's going on there.</li>
  <li>Conversely, learn Perl internals, become wizard, learn to use Devel::Declare!</li>
  <li>Improve the design of Perl101.org.</li>
  <li>Explain <a href="http://mail.perl.org.il/pipermail/perl/2009-September/010578.html">this</a> to everyone searching for help without using strict or warnings.</li>
  <li>Dear god, proper documentation for WxWidgets. Gabor: this is why I strayed away from contributing to Padre. I tried and tried and tried till I hit myself over the head with the keyboard, loss consciousness and forgot I ever wanted to write a plugin or fix bugs with anything that uses WxWidgets :)</li>
  <li>Do a lecture on Moose in Israel.pm or ask/convince/threaten Yuval Kogman HaMagniv [some Hebrew there] to do one.</li>
  <li>Telekinetically force at least 3 authors to apply at least 4 patches I wrote to at least 4 modules a while ago which went completely unnoticed.</li>
  <li>Help out more with Module::Build, I really liked the guys there. Same goes for Perl::Critic.</li>
  <li>Write a 100% Perl implementation of Wordpress to use Template::Toolkit. Dear god I hate the stupid <i>"write templates using hardcoded php!"</i> approach.</li>
<ul></p>

<h2>For the blog stuff, look at Catable</h2>

Hi Yaron! For the WordPress-like blog engine, look at <a href="http://github.com/shlomif/catable/tree/master" title="github.com">Catable</a github.com>, which <a href="http://github.com/Altreus" title="github.com">Altreus</a github.com> and I started working on. It's written in Perl 5 using Catalyst, Template Toolkit, DBIx-Class, etc., has several tests and it is MIT/X11L. It's still not ready for deployment, but we're making progress, and we'd love to have more contributors. Feel free to fork the github repository, and hack on.
</p><p>
I'd like to work on it more intensively in the near future, because I'd like to move my blogs to blog.shlomifish.org, where I can have more blogs, put some ads, have an unlimited amount of user-pics (always a plus) and have more control of the blog.
</p>

<h2>Forked it</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/xsawyerx/">xsawyerx</a> on 2009-09-10T14:09:59</h3>
<p>Sounds decent. I'll have a look at it later.</p><p>Great initiative!</p>

<h2>wxWidgets documentation is coming</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Alias/">Alias</a> on 2009-09-10T16:50:59</h3>
<p>The Perl Foundation just funded a Wx documentation grant.</p>

<p>Maybe I sounded too one-sided. Lack of documentation of Wx (which - YES, OH YES - is coming) is perhaps a turn-off for working or contributing to Padre.</p><p>However, the great people involved and the amazing work done and being done is definitely the reason why I wanted to contribute, would want and will try and hopefully succeed in the future.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<h2>Good ideas</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/petdance/">petdance</a> on 2009-09-11T00:28:15</h3>
Glad to have the help on perl101.  The github project is at <a href="http://github.com/petdance/perl101/tree/master" title="github.com">http://github.com/petdance/perl101/tree/master</a github.com>
<p>
I'm not necessarily adverse to some taking over ownership of Module::Starter.</p>



<h2>use.perl.org</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/petdance/">petdance</a> on 2009-09-11T00:30:31</h3>
As to the redesign of use.perl.org, it would require the owners of the site to go along with it.  I'd pursue that before pursuing that line of thinking any further.
