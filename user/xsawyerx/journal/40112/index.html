<p><p><address>this was originally posted on my new <a href="http://blogs.perl.org">blogs.perl.org</a> journal, which can be found <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/sawyer_x/">here</a>.</address></p>

<p>Shlomi Fish <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/shlomif_tech/42895.html">published a post</a> in Israel.pm that I think is worth reading by anyone from Israel (or Israhell), especially if you're from the Tel Aviv region.</p>

<p>In a year that dealt mostly with marketing, there seemed to be a decline in people showing up to meetings. Even though Tel Aviv University provided us with a room (and now a better room), with a projector, boards, air conditioner and a lot of space, few people show up.</p>

<p>Whatever the reason is, if these trends continue, the meetings will cease. If you care about Perl, if you like to learn, if you like to teach and if you want to spread it, these meetings are for you (or for you to drag someone else to :).</p>

<p>I find it hard to believe there are no Perl programmers in Tel Aviv (I personally know a few), and that they all know everything already.</p>

<p>Seriously, wake up and give a shout out to Shlomi (or even me) about why you aren't showing up. Whatever reason it is, there's bound to be some solution to it.</p>

<p>P.S.:<br/>
<p>No, I didn't really understand what you wanted, Shlomi. :) My answer was <em>"whatever parser you want to write, it has two steps. Step one is <code>Parse::RecDescent</code>."</em> I thought it was funny.</p></p>
