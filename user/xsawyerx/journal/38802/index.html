<div class="span8">
<p><p>Having such serious asthma attacks that I need to stay and work from home gave me more time on my hands in front of the computer and one night I decided to try git again.</p>
<p>When I tried out the famous git tutorial, it didn't really help me understand how to really use it for what I wanted - a centralized repo for all my stuff, so I googled for a long while and still didn't really get anywhere. I went to the git chatroom and in 5 minutes got a bare git repo initiated, moved a few projects and started developing synchronously from 3 different places.</p>
<p>Basically, this is what I had to do:</p>
<ol>
<li>cd /home/sawyer/code/project</li>
<li>git init</li>
<li>git add .</li>
<li>cd /repos</li>
<li>git --bare clone /home/sawyer/code/project</li>
</ol>
<p>At least, that's what I think I did.<br>
Anyway, a few things worth mentioning about git (for those that don't know it too well):
<ul>
<li>Amazing community. People who are always happy to lend a helping hand (not unlike other communities)</li>
<li>Each copy is actually a repository, so each copy has its own history</li>
<li>Branches are fun: they're made in each (local) repository, allowing it to be created, edited, deleted and/or merged without touching the remote repository.</li>
<li>You <u>commit</u> locally, you <u>push</u> remotely when you're done (if you want)</li>
<li>Can automatically create numbered patches for each commit, and create them as emails so you can just pipe it through a mail client</li>
</ul>
<p>I know there must be many things that I'm not mentioning that other git veterans know, such as advanced merging, multiple remote repos and stuff I probably don't know about.</p>
<p>Reasons to put your code in a repository:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you have various versions of your code - which we ALL do</li>
<li>If you ever code on more than one computer</li>
<li>If others need to review your code</li>
<li>If you work on code with other people</li>
</ul>
<p>More thoughts I feel like throwing in:</p>
<ul>
<li>I could probably write something that creates a Changes file from git/svn commits</li>
<li>git-gui needs some more work</li>
<li>I honestly think Subversion is one of the best (honestly, BEST) free and open source projects out there and it's suitable for almost any case, IMHO</li>
</ul></p>

<h2>writing changes files from git</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/domm/">domm</a> on 2009-04-13T12:21:21</h3>
<p>I don't actually write the Changes file directly from git, but I find this command rather helpful when preparing a new release:
</p><blockquote><div><p> <tt>git --no-pager log --no-merges --pretty=format:' %x20%x20 - %s (%an)' `git tag | tail -n 1`..</tt></p></div> </blockquote><p>
Which prints the summary of all changes since the last release (= last git tag). In fact I added this (and a few variations) to my<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.gitconfig, like this:</p><blockquote><div><p> <tt>[alias]<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; lastchanges =!git --no-pager log --no-merges --pretty=format:' %x20%x20 - %s (%an)' `git tag | tail -n 1`..</tt></p></div> </blockquote>

<p>Nifty stuff, thanks!</p><p>After reading your comment, I wrote a simple script to convert the `git --no-pager log --no-merges` to a well structured Changes file. The only problem was that you can't figure the version of the file each time. However, if one will add a check in the script to see when a certain file's $VERSION had changed, one would be able to output a well structured Changes file from git history. Sounds like an idea for a module, really. Maybe I'll sit and write it some day.</p><p>For some reason the formatting didn't work for me, and I'm not using any tags yet, but it's really cool to learn new things. I didn't know about --no-merges and --no-pager. Thanks again.</p>
