<p><p><address>So it's been two weeks since I wrote. I don't find it a big loss, I don't always (correct, "I seldom") write useful or enlightening posts. I usually prefer reading some better material like Ovid, David Golden, Yuval Kogman and other kickass people's journals.</address></p>

<p>When I write a program with a configuration file, usually the configuration file is composed of two parts:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Credentials:</b> the actual user and password (or multiple ones) for databases, web or other interfaces to fetch data from or store in.</li>
  <li><b>Core Configuration:</b> configuration for the program. How to act, what to work on, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>Many a times I would opt for a database to keep those but usually a YAML configuration file suits me just fine and is easier for others to edit.</p>

<p>However, this configuration file (or database file) will reside in our SCM system (Subversion, Git, whateva') and thus, I cannot store passwords in it. So, I create a copy of the configuration file under "<i>config.yaml.generic</i>", and I shadow the passwords there and put it in subversion.</p>

<p>My problem occurs when I want to make changes. I have to keep <i>config.yaml</i> and <i>config.yaml.generic</i> in sync <b>without</b> keeping the actual passwords in the <i>config.yaml.generic</i> file because it goes in the repository. This is much more annoying when trying to keep more machines in sync with these changes</p>

<p>When writing with Moose, I like to use MooseX::SimpleConfig or MooseX::Getopt to handle my configuration file reading. MX::SimpleConfig is a role by Brandon L. Black that reads files through MooseX::ConfigFromFile which uses Config::Any, which uses whatever it recognizes (through YAML/INI/other modules).</p>

<p>What I wanted to do was separate the entities of the configuration files allowing the credentials to remain unchanged on the server (and <b>not</b> in the repo) and the actual core configuration (that I <b>do</b> want in the repo) to remain in a different file. However, MX::ConfigFromFile and MX::SimpleConfig don't support multiple files, only one.</p>

<p>This is the part in which I praise opensource. I just patched them up to support multiple files (as many as you want), they pass the (actually, very few) tests and I'm gonna also add a test or two to each just to make sure I didn't fsck stuff up, and I'll send patches to Brandon. I hope he's available for this.</p>

<p>Yay opensource communities!</p></p>
