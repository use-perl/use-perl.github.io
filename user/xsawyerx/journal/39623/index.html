<p><p>Google Code uses Subversion. If you do not have a commit bit to a project, you can use the readonly mode and check it out.</p>

<p>However, since it's Subversion, you cannot commit anything under readonly. So, yeah, I guess you create a patch from a diff and send it to the developer. However, if you do a lot of changes, you have to create patches against the older versions of changes you've already made.</p>

<p>For example: I got <b>A</b> from Subversion readonly. I made changes and now have B. I can't commit <b>B</b> so I create a patch from the diff (<i>B.patch</i>) send send it to the developer. Meanwhile, I've made more changes (now it's <b>C</b>) and I want to send it to the developer. I need to create a diff now between <b>B</b> and <b>C</b>. I need to create a copy of the code at every stage to create patches between the different stages. Err.. isn't that why we have SCMs in the first place? I haven't even begun on other issues like making my changes on top of more changes the developer put in between my work.</p>

<p>Git allows me to create a local repo that has access to an SVN path to pull from or push changes to. I just use <code>git-svn</code> and then once I have a commit bit, I can push (or <code>dcommit</code> in <code>git-svn</code>-speak).</p>

<p>That way I fetch the readonly using <code>git-svn</code>, commit commit commit, then when I have a commit bit I can update the Subversion repo with all my commits, or even rebase my code to be the latest after pulling more recent changes from the Subversion repo.</p></p>
