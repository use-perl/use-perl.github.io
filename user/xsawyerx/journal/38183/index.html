<p>In the previous post I actually wanted to show an error message that was hard for me to understand at first. It was suppose to be a tidbit but I was too excited about Moose so I forgot all about it and wrote about my Roles usage attempt.<br/>

This was so simple it hurt that it took me a few minutes of going back and forth between the error message and the code to see what's wrong. I imagine that if I used <i>diagnostics</i>, it would be much bigger.<br/>
<br/>
When asked in an interview "what would you do if you explain something to someone and they don't understand?" the answer <b>shouldn't</b> be "say the exact same thing, only louder", but <b>should</b> be "say the (possibly exact) same thing, only much slower and see where I lose them."<br/>
Andy Lester might disagree and I would automatically have to forfeit to whatever he suggests (good luck with the book, by the way!), but this is the first impression I would apply in my situation here.<br/>
<br/>
The error message's first line is what the error is (compile-wise) and the second part of it (in the second line) is what perl thinks the problem is. It's an educated guess but perl is particularly smart (has anyone seen the configuration script for perl?) so there's a good chance it hit the nail on it, and it did.<br/>
