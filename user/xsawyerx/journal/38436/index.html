<p><address> disclaimer: this was written out of frustration and perhaps a note or two are wrong, but the general concept is right. hopefully not for long </address><br/>
<br/>
So, yeah, we got Jifty and Catalyst and Maypold and CGI::Application and Titanium and plenty more. Great. But lets start to break that down:<br/>
<ul>
  <li> Jifty doesn't have a clean view. You can't give it to a designer because there's a lot of coding logic in there.</li>
  <li> CGI::Application's modes are confusing to someone coming from the MVC world </li>
  <li> Titanium and Maypold are projects made by serious people, but wouldn't you rather use CGI::Application or Catalyst instead? </li>
  <li> Catalyst - by far the most broad and extensible and thus dynamic out of them all - still lacks (out of purpose) much of what web programmers need </li>
</ul><br/><br/>We haven't even started the lynch yet (though I'm expecting to experience one at the comments), we're just starting.<br/>
<br/>
What does a web developer really need in a serious system? First of all, a way to CRUD data (Create Read Update Delete) online - usually because you're writing a small CMS engine for someone or you don't like working with SQL directly to enter huge blobs of text. Makes sense. None of these MVCs have it. And why should they? They are MVCs only, not CMS programs. But.. this really is the first thing (and usually, the most) I (and most web programmers) really need.<br/>
<br/>
Catalyst itself does not provide a lot of things because it goes after the concept of Perl of write another extension to do what you need and then just mix them all together. I love that, I really do. I love that if I want to do some nifty socket stuff, I just use it (and if it's not there, I install it through CPAN) unlike in PHP where you have to COMPILE SOCKETS IN THE FSCKING BINARY OMG! Then again, perhaps that's there's a lot of CRUD options which none of them work well enough for me or anyone else I personally know. Perhaps me and the people I get to meet are all idiots, but.. perhaps not.<br/>
<br/>
So, when we look for something to do CRUD. We have:
<ul>
  <li> Catalyst::Controller::CRUD </li>
  <li> Catalyst::Enzyme </li>
  <li> CatalystX::CRUD </li>
  <li> ... buncha others </li>
</ul>
What all of these (and the rest of the *CRUD* modules on CPAN) have in common is that they are either over documented - meaning there is so much documentation you don't even know where to begin and have to put aside a week or two or three to read and experiment - or under documented, which is usually the case. I still don't understand why developers figure that writing the name of the method and the purpose of it in one line is enough. "Sure, I get it now! It's so obvious!"<br/>
It's worth noting that many of them didn't work for me, and I have really tried. One even refused to work with a simple DBIC schema, but ONLY dbdesigner4 files. WTF?!<br/>
<br/>
It all started when I wanted some CRUD. At first I started writing it. Then after showing my girlfriend a part of mjd's awesome lecture on Red Flags, I figured I shouldn't repeat myself, so I tried to write generic CRUD functions but stumbled across some inheritance issues with FormBuilder so I went over to #catalyst to ask for some advice. The advice given was to try other form building modules. While I checked FormFu (underdocumented IMHO, but seems like worth a try), I was tipped off on HTML::FormHandler which is basically a Moose (love Moose) wrapper to handle the form logic, and has a small (yet extremely ugly) form rendering option. This, funny enough, was the only JFDI I've tried yet with all of these (and I've tried over 10, no kidding). All the rest are more than 30 lines of code or 30 piles of documentation to understand, or better yet, a few one liners that tell you NOTHING. With HTML::FormHandler, I got a simple CRUD up with just a few lines, expressively and easily. Finally!<br/>
<br/>
However, my life is still not easy. Since HTML::FormHandler is so simple it's missing a lot of things, and I'm pretty sure bugs are still lurking (as in any software - as Steven Little notes). Now I have to write my own abstraction layer in order to allow CRUD for every possible controller that I want without having to replicate the code + minor differences between them. Hopefully it will work. Perhaps I'll have to patch some things.<br/>
<br/>
Why isn't there any standard module that JFDI?! The greatest language in the world, and we can't have a database <-> web simple and working interface. Woe is me.</p>

I was pretty sure I'd suffer some flames for it because Perl programmers (me included) do not like to hear bad things and whenever someone says "this is bad", it automatically becomes "no, you suck!" and in most cases it's correct but this isn't a simple dichotomous situation in which either the framework/language is wrong or the user/programmer is wrong.<br>
<br>
I don't think Catalyst should have default scaffolding or even built-in scaffolding. I think the Catalyst programmers have much more important things to work on than scaffolding. Important to note that I wouldn't object that kind of thing if it were to turn up but I'm not suggesting that this is the way it should be.<br>
<br>
Beyond that, I do not think that this specific thing that I need right now (and almost every time) is the only thing that is important and that it automatically refers to everyone. You're taking things out of proportion and by so you're missing the entire point.<br>
<br>
My point was strictly (through a rather long rant) that a major component in other frameworks that are essential to a lot of people is missing here. Beyond that, that every project I tried on CPAN (albeit I haven't tried all - and tomorrow I'm dedicating a whole day to keep trying) does not cover it or does not do it right - and that it's frustrating. I also tried to note that we have a documentation problem, and that we as a community still haven't solved something that deters a lot of programmers from using Perl-based MVCs.<br>
<br>
I was pretty sure I'd get some flames in the regular type of "you're wrong, you whiny little bitch", but I hoped it wouldn't come from people who can read what I write. I just needed to blow off some stream from trying to do something in the language that I love that is considered easy and simple and straight forward in other languages, that I don't enjoy using.

<p>I'm not sure what "good defaults" means. Scaffolding is not a good default if you don't need scaffolding.</p><p>And I was talking about Catalyst, not Perl. Yes, Perl (the core) could use better defaults. Catalyst is fine the way it is (well, it needs lots of changes but not wholesale addition of huge features for a small audience).</p>

<p>If Catalyst is the preferred web framework for new Perl projects in 2009, it either needs good defaults such that novices can pick it up and start to be productive without having to make several technical choices they're not necessarily qualified to make, or it needs a very clear explanation that it's not for novices.</p><p>It's perfectly fine to say "Catalyst is a platform for experts who can assemble their own frameworks for themselves."  It's not acceptable to say "Catalyst is the right place to start for everyone."</p>

<h2>Make it modular, flexible just like Catalyst</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/oliver/">oliver</a> on 2009-02-12T13:30:47</h3>
<p>I think one of the reasons there are so many CRUD systems for Catalyst, and none of them ever feels right, is because the CRUD system is almost an anti-Catalyst concept.

</p><p>Catalyst as you say is all about choices, flexibility in application, etc. A CRUD system is (usually) a drop-in single "app" which works with ORM X and HTML templating system Y. So each CRUD system has a different X and Y. I could see CRUD working far better for, say, Jifty.

</p><p>I am the author of one such Catalyst CRUD system, and I fully accept it "works for me" and we make great use of it at work. I also hope I pitched the docs right so others can use it too<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

</p><p>I have recently been wanting to completely rewrite this CRUD system, but it's an overwhelming task. I want to reach the same end point as you - something which is flexible and yet easy to use. This is Hard. Hey, if you are going to produce a lovely Moose CRUD layer I can stitch into my system between TT and DBIC that would be appreciated.

</p><p>For info, my CRUD system is "the Javascript heavy one with the awkward name", called CatalystX::ListFramework::Builder - see <a href="http://tinyurl.com/listframework" title="tinyurl.com">http://tinyurl.com/listframework</a tinyurl.com> and <a href="http://dragonstaff.co.uk/oliverg/" title="dragonstaff.co.uk">http://dragonstaff.co.uk/oliverg/</a dragonstaff.co.uk> for a demo.</p>

<p>I think CatalystX::ListFramework::Builder was the one I haven't tried yet but wanted to. Usually when you start checking these things out, you get discouraged pretty quickly and don't even remember what you tried or didn't try.</p><p>It's definitely the prettiest, and I'm checking the tinyurl.com slides right now. I think I'll try it today. Thank you.</p><p>Usually I write my own CRUD because:</p><ol>
  <li> I want it done fast </li><li> I want to make some checks in the way </li></ol><p>There's a major problem I think in this area because it's tricky. For example, in CatalystX::ListFramework::Builder, the ExtJS library does the rendering but also the form handling (create, add) so if it was </p><blockquote><div><p> <tt> [DB] &lt;-&gt; [form handling] &lt;-&gt; [form rendering] </tt></p></div> </blockquote><p> it has changed to </p><blockquote><div><p> <tt> [DB] &lt;-&gt; [form handling + rendering] </tt></p></div> </blockquote><p> and somewhere there you still have to fit the code for the controller methods to have the CRUD functions. If I could make a wish, I would wish on a generic CRUD layers model and thus be able to provide a standard glue for each piece, but the piece move around with the inclusion of AJAX, etc.</p>

<p>Yes by all means have a poke and feedback on LFB is welcome - but at the same time I completely understand why you would want to go a different way.

</p><p>LFB, as a "first stab" at this type of application, was a good learning experience and highlighted to me much of why CRUD is Hard to do right. But LFB is a mess of design, it's true.

</p><p>If you look at the last slide of my LPW talk, I'm basically saying the same as you - what we need is a generic CRUD layer, or really a set of layers which conform to an API. Then you could have different frontends (ExtJS, plain HTML, etc), different ORM plugins, and so on. That would be my ideal.</p>
