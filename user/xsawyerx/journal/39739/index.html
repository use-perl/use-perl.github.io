<div class="span8">
<p><p>My <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/xsawyerx/journal/39734">last post</a> went over the idea of ordered tests, in which we run events in a certain order. It's a simple concept, it's easy to test and it's very nifty.</p>

<p>However, it fails to cover some more advanced grounds, specifically the idea of multiple runtimes of a session or event, in which we can result in a race condition where two or more instances of the event will try to fire first and we aren't exactly sure which will come first. One could stumble over an <code>if()</code> that will take it a little bit more while the other might handle an unexpected delay because of its flow.</p>

<p>Still, the point to make is that usually in such situations we don't really care what was the <b>numbered order</b> of the events, we care about the <b>preceeding order</b> of the events. Meaning, the <b>sequence of events</b>.</p>

<p>Here is an example:</p>
<pre>
package MyPackage;
use MooseX::POE;

has 'num' => ( is => 'ro', isa => 'Int', default => 0 );

sub START { # in MX::POE, this is mapped to _start
    $_[KERNEL]->yield('first');
}

event 'first' => sub {
    if ( $_[OBJECT]->num == 7 ) {
        # lucky number slevin
        $_[KERNEL]->yield('long_taking_event');
    }

    $_[KERNEL]->yield('second');
};

event 'second' => sub {
    print "reached second!\n";
};

event 'long_taking_event' => sub {
    print "reached long taking event!\n";
};

package main;
MyPackage->new( num => rand(10) ) for 1 .. 5;
</pre>

<p>In this example, we aren't exactly sure if <code>num</code> will be 7 or not, and thus we aren't sure if <code>long_taking_event</code> will even be called. Besides, we're running each event more than once so the <code>order</code> function with the static number of running order of the events cannot even be applied here.</p>

<p>Interestingly enough, we can stipulate that we do know <code>first</code> is suppose to run only after <code>START</code>. This might seem a bit given, but maybe we've made an error in the code and run <code>first</code> directly? How about knowing that <code>long_taking_event</code> and <code>second</code> can only be run after <code>first</code>? That's pretty good to know. If we run the program and it will see that <code>second</code> ran <b>before</b> <code>first</code>, we know we've made a mistake!</p>

<p>That's what I call <b>sequenced-ordered tests</b> or <b>event-dependency order</b>. It's when the order isn't conclusive, but the sequence of events is. Right now my (yet unnamed and unpublished) framework supports that in a very simple form:</p>
<pre>
with 'POE::Test::Simple'; # running title

has '+seq_ordering' => ( default => sub { {
    'first'            => [ 'START'          ],
    'second'           => [ 'START', 'first' ],
    'long_taking_event => [ 'START', 'first' ],
} } );

# then each event/sub called can register itself with the framework
event 'second' => sub {
    $_[OBJECT]->seq_order('second');
};
</pre>

<p>Right now I'm working on making this implicit so it's not required to run at all in order for the testing to run. Much help on this came from <code>mst</code>, <code>doy</code> and other great people at <code>#moose</code>. Thanks guys!</p>

<p>Again, thinking about what this still misses: <address>how many times each event ran?</address> We have no counting of this, so the next post will cover <b>event counting</b>, which is exactly it. Meanwhile, if you feel like pitching ideas for the framework module name, I'd appreciate it.</p></p>
