<p><p><address>this was originally posted on my new <a href="http://blogs.perl.org">blogs.perl.org</a> journal, which can be found <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/sawyer_x/">here</a>.</address></p>

<p>Yesterday I gave a talk on Moose (the post-modern metaclass-based object system for Perl 5) in TelAviv.pm. The <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/xSawyer/moose-perl-5">slides are available on slideshare</a>. They aren't a lot of slides because I mainly wanted to give an introduction to Moose for beginners and the gist of the lecture is me speaking, so the slides can't really express that.</p>

<p>Now, regarding the talk. There were few people present, which was a bit unfortunate but I'm assuming it's somewhat due to the change in location in the university. It was difficult to find, I have to admit. However, it's a new place, bigger and more comfortable.</p>

<p>If I could do it over again, I would definitely want more people and more participation so we could give some live examples instead of trying to squeeze it out of people. But overall, I'm happy with it.</p>

<p>I scheduled with Gabor to do the lecture on <a href="http://rehovot.pm.org/meetings.html">March in Rehovot.pm</a>. If you're near Rehovot, stop by, say hello and learn how to use Moose!</p>

<p>I want to thank Shlomi Fish for organizing TelAviv.pm, the lectures (including this one), the promotion, receiving a free guest room from the university and all the other annoying/difficult things most people don't feel like doing.</p></p>
