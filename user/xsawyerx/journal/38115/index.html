<p>Recently, an old project I worked on (and deprecated) was passed on to a new developer. When moving the materials with explanations for them to the new developer, it seems hard to let it go. Not so much because of the sentiments towards personal projects (and by that, I mean projects that I personally do - not just projects for myself), but more so because I feel like I've done such a poor job compared to what I would do today.<br/>
<br/>
The improvements we make within a relatively short period of time to our abilities, insights, concepts and understandings are so tremendous that it makes sense how better we could do anything. I can't let go of the desire to bring the old code up to date with my current abilities or what I perceive as the bare minimum. I'm sure others feel this way too.<br/>
<br/>
I don't think I can shake this feeling, but maybe with time, when more recent projects will be in par with what I perceive as reasonable coding standards (Damian, Critic, etc.), I'll have less and less to try and shake. I guess the most I can do at this point is try and work on a reasonable explanation to why I wrote the following line, and hope no one will ever remember it:<br/>
<pre>
$subjects{"$subject"} = $id . ";;" . $desc;
</pre>
Possible explanation candidates:<br/>
<ol start="1">
<li> &#8220;<i>He</i> made me do it&#8221; </li>
<li> &#8220;I was up 3 days in a row&#8221; (<a href="http://bash.org/?221580">exempli gratia</a>) </li>
<li> &#8220;I didn't do it&#8221; (a la <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bart_Gets_Famous">Simpsons</a>) </li>
</ol></p>
