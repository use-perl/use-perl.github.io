<p><p>I've just released Test::Ping version 0.09 which has a fully ported version of the Net::Ping testing suite. Basically I took all the tests from it, rewrote them to use Test::More and Test::More's functions (SKIP, TODO, etc.) and Test::Ping instead of Net::Ping. I thought it might be a time to write some of the things I have on my mind right about now.</p>

<p>I started Test::Ping on Apr 22nd, exactly one week ago, and I think I've already reached the high point in the functionality of it, or at least what I imagine(d) it would be. I don't anticipate many (if at all) changes to Test::Ping at this point, since most changes to Net::Ping will continue to be transparently supported in Test::Ping.</p>

<p>The current most interesting discussion (to me) on the Perl front right now is specific Role usage situations. Ovid, Steven Little, Chris Prather, Shawn Moore and a lot of other prolific CPAN/Perl authors I admire quietly are openly discussing it and provide a lot of interesting insight into smart programming paradigms... and I'm sitting and writing a testing module that does pings that probably won't be used by many.</p>

<p>Here are a few reasons why I don't think this module was completely pointless:</p>
<ul>
<li> It's easier to have functional programming for testing than object oriented, as long as it's not too complex. Andy Lester's Test::WWW::Mechanize is a prime example of when object oriented testing is preferred. </li>
<li> It's easier to write <code>ping_ok( '127.0.0.1', 'testing localhost' );</code> than <code>my $p = Net::Ping->new(); my $alive = $p->ping('127.0.0.1'); ok( $alive, 'testing localhost' ); $p->close;</code> </li>
<li> It has a clean and updated version of the entire Net::Ping testing suite. </li>
<li> It provides another standardized test module using Test::Builder to Perl's repertoire. </li>
<li> Gave me my first taste of GitHub. I love it. </li>
<li> Gave me my first taste of Test::Builder. It's pretty cool. </li>
<li> It's well written, well tested and well documented. If anything, it might help even out the amount of bad code that exists on CPAN. </li>
</ul>

<p>At least I didn't spend too much time over it.</p></p>

<h3><a href="/user/chromatic/">chromatic</a> on 2009-04-29T23:36:26</h3>
<p>Don't forget that you've wrapped up useful behavior in a package that's easy to understand and easier to use!  That's good for everyone.</p>

It clearly needs a <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/educated_foo/journal/33322" title="perl.org">DSL</a perl.org>.

<h2>learning through small steps</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/oliver/">oliver</a> on 2009-04-30T12:34:26</h3>
<p>The thing I liked that you mentioned is the way it's possible to learn about a bunch of stuff through actually tackling a relatively simple and small task. Here, you learned about Test::Builder, GitHub, and more.

</p><p>I'm doing the same at the moment. I have a large, popular piece of software to rewrite in Moose. First, I'll rewrite one of my small systems that no-one uses in Moose - I'm picking up lots on structuring Roles, etc, and what feels right. It's a great way to learn with relatively low risk.</p>
