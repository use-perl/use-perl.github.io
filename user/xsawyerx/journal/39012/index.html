<p><address><b>update:</b> the caveat mentioned at the bottom isn't of Test::Able. It's just how programming works</address>

<p>Today I tried to convert some standards tests that I have with <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Test::More">Test::More</a> and <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Test::Block">Test::Block</a> (which is what I normally use for testing) to <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Test::Class">Test::Class</a>.</p>
<p>First thought that came to my head was <i>"I bet <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Moose">Moose</a> could be useful here"</i> and remembered <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Test::Able">Test::Able</a> which I never really used. I quickly compared them both and found Test::Class to be shorter, so I started off with it.</p>
<p>The problems first appeared when I tried to convert the roles I had into inherited tests. They seem to work, only that the startup() method I had written is being performed on <b>EVERY</b> inherited test! What the fsck would be the point of writing a base test to inherit from, have startup methods in it and then re-run these for every possible inherited test? For every role test I'm going to ask the user for the same input he gave at the startup()? I had to rethink this.</p>
<p>I tried Test::Able which might be able to solve this more elegantly. I ported the Test::Class tests easily enough and even used attributes instead of tested hash values (leaving Moose to test some input for me), which was more comfortable. Then I set out to convert the inherited tests.</p>
<p>I started by writing them as roles since it seemed to make sense. First error:</p>
<pre>Could not load class (Code::Test::Role) because : Code::Test::Role already has a metaclass, but it does not inherit Moose::Meta::Class
</pre>
<p>Checking Test::Able, we can see that it has roles support under <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Test::Able::Role">Test::Able::Role</a>. Whoops, my mistake! Using Test::Able::Role my tests now work, except when I try: <code> test plan => 3, test_method => sub { }; </code> Apparently Test::Able::Role doesn't support multiple tests per method. Alright, lets try setting the plan inside the method:</p>
<pre>
test test_method => sub {
    $_[0]->meta->current_method->plan(3);
    ok( 1, "test $_" ) for 1 .. 3;
};
</pre>

<p>This works. Finally I can run tests. One caveat I've noticed is that one of tests in the test class was done first, while another one was done last. This is not a caveat in Test::Able, this is just how methods work in programming. Perhaps I should keep those tests at the startup() unless they don't mean anything to the roles.</p>

<p>Thank you Justin DeVuyst for Test::Able!</p></p>

<h2>fixed</h2>

Its a genuine bug that Test::Able::Role doesn't
like planning.  Please file that in RT.  I've
already fixed it and I'll release tomorrow.  Thanks!
