<div class="span8">
<p><p>I remembered a long-forgotten snack from my childhood this morning: rice cakes!  My grandmother discovered these before I knew what health food was and was feeding them to us for snacks because we liked them, not because they were good for us.  Two changes since then:</p>

<ul><li>Many rice cakes are corn cakes.  Still include rice, but primarily made of corn.  Not a problem for me as long as fat and cholesterol remain constant, but might affect some people.</li>
<li>All rice cakes are flavored now.  There's no such thing as "plain" or "original."  There is "unsalted," but I don't want that.  The white chedder seems to be good (and low fat), and later I'll try the buttered popcorn I also bought (which is <b>no</b> fat).</li>
</ul>

<p>These seem like a reasonable way to replace chips, popcorn, and other snacks in my diet.  Bags of 14 cakes were on sale US$1.50 at Albertson's.</p>

<p>Other discovery, and I sort of already knew this: I can get fat-free salad dressing: Italian, ranch, Caesar, or just about any other.  Fat free mayo and miracle whip exists, too.  From experience I can say that while I notice a difference, the fat doesn't add much to the flavor.  Given that I can get enough salad in a bag to last me a week for a reasonable price (or make it myself for an even more reasonable price), I think a salad at every dinner is in order.  (Related note: croutons will be 2% of my fat per serving.)</p>

<p>It's starting to seem like I could make a real revolution in my eating.</p></p>
