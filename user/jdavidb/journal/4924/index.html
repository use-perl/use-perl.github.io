<p><p>I've got tickets to Episode II at the wrong theater.  If I'd gotten tickets for Tinseltown in Grapevine (which is between my house and the theater we're going to), I'd have gotten the chance to meet David Prowse, the man behind the original Darth Vader mask.  He's going to be present for the opening screening and available to sign autographs after the movie.</p>

<p>All in all, I think it's pretty cool that he's appearing in my area.  I wish I could be there, but at least I get to see the movie, and I'll be happy. :)</p></p>

Well, if you're like some people, you've already seen it.  I have this bad feeling that pirated versions of AOTC are going to be exhibit A in an upcoming rehash of copyright legislation within a couple of years.

<p>Actually, I'm one of the people who attempts to go into seclusion to avoid knowing <i>anything</i> about the movie from the time filming wraps until opening night.  I unfortunately clicked on a spoiler image link from some rude poster on slashdot yesterday and learned something about the movie I'd rather not have known.  I ranted and raved for a long time, and grumbled for quite a while afterward (still grumbling).</p>

<p>I can't imagine ruining the entire plot of AOTC in a 3" window with my computer's speakers.  If I didn't want to go opening night, I'd wait a week or two and then go see it, and if I still didn't want to pay that much, I'd wait until it got to the dollar theater.  Why would anyone ruin the movie for themselves and make it such a crummy experience?</p>

I avoid commercials for movies I want to see as well.  Sometimes, however, the studios themselves give away too much in the previews IMO and, while I can flip the channel or change the radio station, I'm not gonna get up and walk out of the theatre to avoid a preview.  I also avoid slashdot articles about any movies I want to see for precisely the reason that you mention - you never know when someone will spoil something.
<p>
I think the first studio-sponsored spoiler example that comes to my mind were the previews for <i>Castaway</i> in which they let you know that he is rescued from the island.  I still liked the movie, but I would have enjoyed that movie more if I hadn't known going in that he would eventually get picked up.
</p><p>
Probably my best experience was with <i>The Matrix</i>.  I avoided all previews and really had no idea what the movie was about and enjoyed it that much more because of it.</p>

<p>The slashdot article in question wasn't even about Star Wars.  The post was a troll that sounded informative, and thus modded up.</p>

<p>I had a similar experience on the Matrix.  I hadn't even heard of the movie when I went to it.  It was just something we went to because nobody except me wanted to see TPM again.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>
