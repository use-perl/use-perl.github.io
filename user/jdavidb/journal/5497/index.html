<p><p>The local station that airs Sailor Moon quit doing it last week.  I've been watching Sailor Moon nearly every Saturday morning for at least two years (and every so often before that).  Last time they came to the end of the series (at least, the end of the part they have; they only air the DIC dubs.  Yes, I like them.), I got the bright idea of taping every episode.  I have every episode on tape from episode #3 through most of the Ail and Ann story.  Unfortunately after almost a year I missed an episode one month when I staggered in from First Saturday (Dallas's once a month midnight madness used and new computer stuff street sale) and was so delerious I proceeded to set the VCR to tape but left the tape out.  I got every episode since then, including two copies of one that was aired two weeks in a row.  At that point they suddenly went crazy and skipped the end of the Ail and Ann story and jumped right in to the arrival of Rini.  We got all the way up to the death of Rubeus two Saturdays ago, and then suddenly the junk cartoon on in the earlier time slot was moved down a half hour and its original slot filled with "paid programming."  Same thing this week.</p>

<p>This is certainly annoying.  I've started most Saturdays with Sailor Moon for so long that it doesn't feel like a day off if I don't get to watch it.  I didn't even manage to get every episode of any of the three stories in the DIC dubs on tape.  Cable listings show that Sailor Moon is airing on Cartoon Network.  Seems like quite a waste to pay for cable just to tape one show.  I'm curious as to what they're airing.  It has to be English, but episode descriptions for the next two weeks include episodes that were left out of the DIC dub of the first season.  Anyone know if they were redone?</p>

<p>Maybe I could break out my tapes and watch an episode every Saturday morning.  Bah!  &lt;whine>It's just not the <i>same</i>.&lt;/whine></p>

<p>The preceeding was another useless insight into my mundane life.  Hey, I enjoy it, even if it does look boring in print. :)</p></p>
