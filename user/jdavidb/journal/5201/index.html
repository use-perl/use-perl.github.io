<p><p>I've just come up with a wonderful idea to revolutionize the United States government with open source software.  No, I'm not proposing a law like the guy from Peru (although that's a nice idea, too).  My idea is that both houses of Congress set up a publicly accessible slash site.  Imagine: new bill is introduced in the Senate, it's immediately posted on slash.senate.gov, the country gets to debate it, some Senators actually listen to our opinions.</p></p>

That's a good idea.  Each critter could have his own section for his constituency.
<p>
(I also like any idea that sells 535 more copies, oh yes.)</p>



<h2>Slash government</h2>

I have a horrid feeling that your idea would merely recapitulate the worse properties of Slashdot and talk radio.  People do not want to debate ideas -- they want to shout their opinion and swat down other people's.  Have a look at CNN's chatrooms some time; it's appalling.

<p>Yes, but the nice thing is that the moderation system tends (only TENDS, mind you!  I'm not saying it's perfect) to put forward the best arguments.  In a country that's as split as the U.S. (judging by the past election), there should be a sufficient number of people on "both" sides that folks who, like me, browse at +4 would get to see the best arguments for their side as well as the other.</p>

<p>Yeah, it's not the best idea in the world, but as I've said before, Slash fits very well with the way I think, and I love the moderation system.  I'd love to see someone try it.  (Maybe if senate.gov and house.gov have a place where an LWP program could fetch the text of each bill brough before each house, someone outside of the government could set this up.)</p>

<p>Oh, well.  I'm just talking to hear my head rattle.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>
