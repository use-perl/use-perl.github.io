<p><p>I want to be able to apply the -B test to the contents of an arbitrary scalar to see if it's binary or not.  I've got files that are occasionally spewing junk at me; the first N,000,000 records may be just fine, but toward the end they turn into gibberish.  I want to print out erroneous records, unless they are binary garbage, in which case I just want to print a statement that says so.</p>

<p>Thinking of looking into IO::Scalar or something...</p></p>

<h2>Uses the current buffer</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/merlyn/">merlyn</a> on 2004-05-07T16:38:23</h3>
If I haven't been misinformed, <tt>-B</tt> uses the current STDIO buffer of the filehandle for its value, so you could seek near the end and possibly get a different result for -B as the file became "more binary".

<p>For the record, I decided to just match each line against \0 as I read it, and that seems to work fine for now.  Not quite as advanced a heuristic as -B, but good enough.</p>

<h2>-B cheap plastic imitation</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jhi/">jhi</a> on 2004-05-14T19:52:32</h3>
The heuristics seem to be pretty simple... if you ignore fancy bits like Unicode, locales, EBCDIC, MS-DOG line endings, and accept also the vertical tab as whitespace, the test for -B is pretty much<br> <br>3 * tr/\0-\x07\x0e-\x1a\x1c-\x1f\x7f-\xff/\0-\x07\x0e-\x1a\x1c-\x1f\x7f-\xff/ &gt; length<br> <br>That is, printable and whitespace ASCII and ESC are okay,<br>others not, and if there are more than 1/3 not okays, call it binary.

<p>That seems like the kind of thing that would be nice to expose in a function, in much the same way uc, lc, and glob started their lives.</p>

&gt; That seems like the kind of thing that would be nice to expose in a function, in much the same way uc, lc, and glob started their lives.<br> <br>I dunno... I think the heuristic is so weak (false positives for arguably "text" data, for example), and by definition a binary test (ta-dah!), as opposed to multivalued, that I find little value of exposing that logic.  I think e.g. adding my snippet to the FAQ should be quite enough for those who need it.<br>
