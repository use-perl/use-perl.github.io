<h2>What extra hour?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/duff/">duff</a> on 2006-04-03T15:05:36</h3>
We "spring forward" and so <em>lose</em> an hour, not gain one.

<p>You know, I've asked that question in several places (online, and in the analog world), and I keep getting the same misunderstanding.</p>

<p>I don't mean an hour gained one time, during the transition.  I mean the alleged hour we gain every day during the period of daylight saving time.  Allegedly we're all getting another hour of daylight.  What are you going to do with it?  If we're not actually getting that hour in any tangible way, we might want to reconsider whether the costs of the transition are worth it.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

"If daylight savings is so good, why not go on it year-round?"
<p>
And before you think that was a joke, that's exactly what some of our proud lawmakers want to do.  How... misunderstood.</p>

<p>I'd prefer it to the current system, especially today when I'm finally seeing what it's like to internally change the offset I apply to my watch.  (I went onto UTC just before the last time change.)</p>

<p>My dad's always thought going to DST year round would be great, but probably somewhere between my reasoning and that lawmakers.</p>

<p>I don't care what the standard is.  I just don't want it to change twice a year!<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<p>And if you're interested in raising public awareness of the issue (not that it's a huge deal or anything), be sure to ask at least one person today what he or she is going to do with his extra hour every day this summer.</p>

<p>How so?</p>

<h2>Actually ...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/grantm/">grantm</a> on 2006-04-03T21:42:09</h3>
<p>... here in New Zealand summer time <i>finished</i> a few weeks ago.  However I <i>have</i> in fact been enjoying the extra hour - at the start of the day.</p>

<p>I go cycling for half an hour before breakfast.  Before daylight savings ended, it was getting really dark at 6:30am.  Now I have more natural light during my ride and I much prefer that.  Of course as we head into winter it's only going to get darker.</p>
