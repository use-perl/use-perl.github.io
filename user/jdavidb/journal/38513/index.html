<p><p>The truth is after my previous journal entry I went on to write a program that just takes the output of UNIX find. :)  But I didn't finish, and I got pulled off of that project until later, so when I come back I may do something else.</p>

<p>Contrary to popular belief, I did <b>not</b> conclude that File::Find::Rule was dead!!!  Nothing of the sort!  I saw the date, and thought "That looks odd," and decided to ask.  And provoked a great little discussion to come back to, in the process.</p>

<p>I actually wondered if the truth wasn't "The module is doing so well nobody's seen a need to update it since then."  But I also thought it was entirely possible that work had carried on under a different name, much as WWW::Mechanize took off from its predecessor module (whose name I don't even remember at this point, but whose author was Kirrily "skud" Robert, IIRC).</p>

<p>I am quite glad to see that ack's approach can be accessed through File::Next.  I will probably look into that at some point.</p></p>

<h2>It was WWW::Automate</h2>

It was originally WWW::Automate, and I knew I was going to change the API so it needed a new name.

<p>Oh, yeah!  I used to remember those days a lot better than I do, now.</p><p>I remember I thought it was a really cool project idea back then, but it wasn't until it became WWW::Mechanize that I really found it usable.</p>

<p>Oh, and I remember that for a long time I thought the new name wasn't as good as the old.  Apparently since then my subconscious has changed my mind for me, since I didn't even remember the old.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>
