<div class="span8">
<p><p>Since school's over (Neural Networks final last night), I decided to clean up my kitchen and cook tonight.  That's the first really decent meal I've fixed since I moved into my house in November.  It's been depressing me that I couldn't sit down and cook a really nice meal.</p>

<p>Tonight I dug out my old wok which has been in a box since 1998.  A real, honest to goodness, stirfry with nothing special, but it's the best meal I've had in a while.  Unfortunately that wok never really was that good, and I think I was injesting teflon.</p>

<p>Way back there, we tried to find a real steel wok, but gave up.  Everything was either coated in something or was stainless steel.  But back when we were searching (pre-1996), we didn't have what I have today: google.  It's amazing how I'm always remembering something I always wanted to know or find before I discovered the Internet.  Now I can always find what I want.</p>

<p>So, the second hit on "wok" was The Wok Shop located in San Francisco's Chinatown.  I figured a steel wok would run me a lot of money, but it turns out they were $15!.  I clicked through the first page of links and the sponsored ads and didn't find a deal that good anywhere else, nor did I find a place that seemed as authentic.  So, there's a carbon-steel wok headed straight to my front door.</p>

<p>Life is good!</p></p>

Perhaps, if you want something simple, like a plain steel wok.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)
<p>
I have a decent amount of fun with The Hunt: seek out interesting little shops and ask around for the obscure items you really need in your kitchen.  It took me 10 years, but I eventually did find a simple Mat&eacute; cup in Vancouver, BC (T, the tea shop on Broadway).  They even had roasted Yerba Mat&eacute; (but not the authentic-yet-inexpensive-and-easy-to-find kilo bags from Argentina, but something packaged in-house).  Not that I have a Mat&eacute; fixation or anything, but the next time I'm entertaining South Americans, (or have a craving for mateine), I'm set.
</p><p>
It's not the nicest Mat&eacute; cup, but it works.  And it'll probably take another 10 years to find something nicer.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)
</p><p>
On the other hand, I've been looking for a hand-hammered copper[*] ibrik for about as long.  Google doesn't turn up anything for that (at least in English).  Brass and steel-plated ibriks are quite easy to find.  Rumor has it that the hand-hammered copper ones are reasonably easy to find in Turkey and the southern ex-Soviet republics.  So if any of you folks are going to be travelling in/near/through Turkey, drop me a line!
</p><p>
*: I think the conducitivity of copper does make a difference here.  That, and when I do eventually find it, it'll make a good story.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>
