<p><p>If I had wireless, you could see these in realtime, instead of the next day.  I'm foregoing checking my email to post these.</p>

<p>Box lunches were provided for the first day.  It looked like by the
time I got there all that was left was vegetarian meals.  However, it
turned out the "Hail Caesar" lunch I got was a chicken Caesar salad
wrap.  Pretty good, and I can pretend I ate healthy because of the
salad part.  The lunch included a one ounce bag of chips.  I don't
think I ever saw a one ounce bag of chips before.  I'm by no means
complaining because the lunch was great and I didn't realize they were
going to feed us anyway.
<p>After lunch I posted my accumulated journal entries from the same
room where the rt talk had been.  The next talk in the room was
Simon's Perl for system administrators, which he said was only for
people who barely knew Perl.  He recommended MJD's secrets of the
ivory tower talk instead, except for people who'd already seen, for
whom he recommended Damian's Perl 6 talk.
