<div class="span8">
<p><p>So, before I headed off to singing school, I got RT up and running.  I should have mentioned earlier that I reported the problems I was having to the mailing list and immediately a patch was issued to remove the assumptions making it difficult to install RT as a user besides root.  (As I mentioned there, I have <i>everything</i> for RT installed by a user named rt: RT, mod_perl, apache, mysql, and even a separate installation of perl itself.)</p>

<p>Last week, getting back from my trip, I of course had hundreds of email messages.  Tuesday or Thursday I sat down and entered every issue into RT.  I finally realized why email is RT's primary interface instead of web: if our exchange server was set up to mail to the box on my desk running RT it would have been so much easier to enter all this stuff.</p>

<p>I felt pretty unproductive last week as I floundered around my huge list.  This Monday I wound up spending two hours just processing requests for me to say, "how long <b>it</b> was going to take," for over 25 values of it.</p>

<p>Then, Tuesday, things suddenly kicked into high gear as I started down my list.  I prioritized, I attacked one thing at a time, I knew where to go next when I finished an item or came to a point where I was waiting on a computer or a person.  And, I'm happy to say, I just had the most productive week I've seen in two years, I think.  All thanks to RT.  We should all be using this stuff!</p>

<p>Immense thanks to Jesse.</p></p>
