<div class="span8">
<p><p>The Cult of Scientology is conducting some kind of Google bombing to get earthlink.net, their ISP, to show up on all kinds of religious searches.  Sometimes it even comes up as the first link!  I've noticed it on other things, too, including genealogy-related terms.  Sometimes Google even shows seemingly relevant metadata for the search, even though the link is just to earthlink.net.</p>

<p>Really annoying.</p>

<p>I have reported this to Google sometimes on particularly egregious searches, and I've noticed they've started slipping back to the third page or so sometimes.  earthlink.net still just shouldn't even show up in a search for <a href="http://216.239.39.100/search?q=cache:kXJf75KIY40C:start.earthlink.net/+bear+valley+bible+institute&hl=en&ie=UTF-8">Bear Valley Bible Institute</a>.</p>

Wow<br>Where did you learn this?<br>  I live just south of Clearwater, FL (the Sci's international hq), in Largo, and have never heard this.<br>  It would stop a lot of people in the area from doing business with them.<br>  They aren't well thought of around here, and they are buying up much of Clearwater.

<p>Well, I went a bit overboard with the "wholly owned subsidiary" comment, but Earthlink is owned by Scientology.  And if you doubt me, try some random religious searches on Google and question why Earthlink keeps coming up.</p>

<p>Here's some <a href="http://www.metroactive.com/papers/metro/03.19.98/scientology-9811.html" title="metroactive.com">information</a metroactive.com>  (Oh, and if you want a little less <a href="http://www.skeptictank.org/hs/elcoslnk.htm" title="skeptictank.org">unbiased view</a skeptictank.org>.)  The first link maintains a healthy skepticism, but how else do you explain earthlink showing up on my searches?</p>

<p>The fact that earthlink is "scientology's ISP" is fairly well known in the slashdot crowd and related communities.</p>

I'd never heard that.  I'll ask around and see if anyone around here knows it.<br>  <br>  I'll make sure everyone knows it now...

<h2>New Weird Al song?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/djberg96/">djberg96</a> on 2003-04-25T20:00:03</h3>
For some reason, this started me thinking that <i>Cult of Scientology</i> would be a good Weird Al Yankovic song (sung to Living Colour's <i>Cult of Personality</i>).
<p>
Or has it already been done?</p>

<p>Unfortunately Weird Al won't take song suggestions due to IP liability concerns.  So now that you've mentioned it<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... he can never do it!<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>
