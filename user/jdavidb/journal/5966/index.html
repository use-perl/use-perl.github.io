<div class="span8">
<p><p>Bugzilla more specialized than rt: bugs.
<p>RT designed to be general: track everything from bugs to worklist to
grocery list.  Project management.  PM frontend w/ basic Gantt charts
on the way.
<p>RT predecessor: req.  Lotsa languages.
<p>Jesse wrote webreq.  And didn't mesh with req.
<p>RT written because his company wouldn't run req.
<p>His own DSL provider used RT and tracked his problems (DSL on
cellphone) with it.
<p>RT2: designed.
<p>RT3 on the way.  Improved installation.  Built for the enterprise.
Runs on Win32.
<p>Can interact entirely by email.  Access rights governed by GPG.
<p>WAP interface.
<p>Good cross-browser compatibility.  Palm pilot.
<p>Developer interface does periodic page refresh ala Drudge report.
Nice!
<p>Can have tickets referring to or depending on things outside of rt;
by means of a URL.
<p>If I were to build a sourceforge product, I think it would use rt.
<p>MIME fine.  Screenshots.  MP3s.
<p>Time tracking.  Time worked, etc.
<p>Reply to any member of the collection of emails in the ticket.
<p>Update a bunch of tickets at once.  Sponsored by DynDNS.
<p>Scrips: auto replies, ticket reopens, page me, check the weather.
Scrips stored in the database so you can upgrade without losing
customizations.
<p>rt is being used for Parrot development.  Puts attachments on the
web and generates links to them.
Email.  Web.  Command line.  Perl API.
I find myself wanting to be a goof and ask "Is there a C wrapper for
that Perl API?" :)
WAP.  WAP is dead.
<p>End users.  Mostly email, web possible.  Users can see their own
issues.  Code coming to email people a password for a new account upon
their first request.
<p>Oracle 8 didn't search blobs.  Oracle Text.
<p>rt runs on Mason.  Gotta check out Mason.  Missing that talk now.
:)
<p>A Portuguese translation surfaced in the middle of the talk.  This
conference is neat that way.
<p>The phrase "Circuit ID" came up.  :)
<p>DBIx::SearchBuilder
<p>For localization, use Locale::Maketext.  Makes easy translation
files mapping a message id (basically the original language?) to the
translation.
<p>Test::Inline.
<p>Mason has components, like modules (@INC).
<p>I should have done my YAPC todo list with rt.
<p>Can override any subroutine in RT through a series of overlay
systems in a way that will persist across upgrades.
<p>RSS feed!  Cool!
<p>Code for rt.cpan.org customizations is available.
<p>CPANPLUS will integrate with rt.cpan.org.
<p>RT/FM is a knowledge base.  Eventually.  Asset tracking system coming
eventually.  (No code yet).

<p>
A knowledge base called RTFM?</p>

<p>Yes.  RT FAQ Manager.  You know what the original RT domain name was, right?</p>
