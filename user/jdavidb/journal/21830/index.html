I don't think the vote count will get the attention it should until he gets more than about 300 million.<br> <br>Maybe, just maybe, then someone will say... <a href="http://www.onlisareinsradar.com/archives/002282.php#002282" title="onlisareinsradar.com">"Hey, doesn't that seem a little high?"</a onlisareinsradar.com> <br> <br>But, I wouldn't count on it. (no pun intended)



<h2>56 Million</h2>

I wouldn't call this a mandate or evidence of the people's will.<br> <br>It does show he won the election.

Hi.  Did you ever finish the Metafont font for doing shape notes in Lilypond?  I need to set some hymns using the Aiken system for some Mennonite singers.<br> <br>Also, which Sacred Harp book would you recommend?  I also love the old blood, guts and thunder hymns and would like the edition that has the mostest and the bestest.  Cooper or Denson?  Modern edition or older edition?  What sort of hymns did they drop out?  Any good ones, or just ones that weren't that good?  Or was the dropping based on theology?<br> <br>Jonathan Walther<br>Tabernacle of Truth and Love

<p>Heh; hello, there!</p>

<p>I am sorry; I never did finished setting up shaped-notes in lilypond.  Someone contacted me during the last 12 months and said he almost had it working.  I believe he did announce his work on the list; I'm not sure if he ever finished it.  It turned out my work was going on the wrong track.</p>

<p>There is a shaped-note font provided in lilypond that will cover both 7-shape and 4-shape systems.  The difficulty is getting them set automatically.</p>

<p>I'm sorry that I can't comment about sacred harp books.  My experience is almost exclusively with the 7-shape system.  (Until this year I had never sung a sacred harp song.  And even now it was just a small informal afternoon thing among people who knew the 7-shape system.  Only one of us knew sacred harp.  I've never attended a real SH singing.)</p>

oops, my bad, I got you mixed up with pdcawley.  Sorry!  And yes, according to Han-Wen the font is there.  I promised to donate $100 to Lilypond, and he said in that case he would look into it for us.  Maybe if a couple others also pitched in $100 each it would be much more likely to happen in a nice way?<br> <br>To make a donation, we use Paypal to Han-Wen (hanwen@xs4all.nl)<br> <br>I too have only used the 7-note system, and need to use it for getting some old-timey singers to try out some new hymns.<br>Cheers!
