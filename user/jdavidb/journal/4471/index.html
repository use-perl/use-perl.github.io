<p><p>Gonna be up most of the night finishing project #2 for my distributed systems class.  (They call it "operating systems 2," but I sure didn't get to do any of the neat operating systems stuff I was hoping for.  Looks like I'll just have to read my Linux Kernel Internals book on my own if I want to have any fun.)</p>

<p>Our projects in this class are supposed to be in Java.  There's a lot of client/server type stuff, and this second project uses CORBA.  For the first project, I managed to find an excuse to write a test scaffolding program in Perl (which connected to each server and sent initialization information and a start signal).  Haven't found an excuse for this project, yet, but I'm looking for one.</p>

<p>I've mostly liked Java, but I'm one of those people who never really met an OO program he didn't like.  I like exceptions.  But the thing I really like is threads.  Most of what we're doing wouldn't be possible if we couldn't have multithreaded peer-to-peer apps playing client and server with each other many times over.  I'd tremble to try the same thing in Perl.</p>

<p>Haven't heard news on iThreads or anything else about Perl threads in a long time.  What's the status?  Are we reentrant, yet?  The last killer functionality Perl needs for me is reliable threads.  And if I had them I'd be prototyping all this in Perl, showing it off to my TA and professor, and trying to get away with turning in Perl versions.</p></p>
