<p><p>Today I am finally going to need to use XML to do my job.  This is a historic first.  I've looked at XML off and on for I don't know how many years now, and never once actually used it for work.  (Though I did have an aborted attempt to use XML as config files a few years back.)</p>

<p>I'm familiar with most of the basic issues in XML use, but I couldn't quite remember all the details about which module did what (in what way).  So I googled for Perl XML and found <a href="http://perl-xml.sourceforge.net/faq/">this handy FAQ</a>.  Thank you, to whoever provided this; it was just what I needed!</p>

<p>Haven't read the whole thing, yet, but so far it hasn't mentioned XML::TreeBuilder, which was the module that worked most like the way I think, way back when I first started looking at XML.  I remember also designing a simpler module that worked about the same way, as an exercise in writing automated tests.</p></p>

<h2>Followup</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jdavidb/">jdavidb</a> on 2004-06-09T13:54:54</h3>
<p>I don't get it.  Last time I checked, expat was included in the XML::Parser distribution.  Now I have to go fetch it myself?  Why the regression?  (I swear I remember being delighted when someone finally decided to include it; am I thinking of another module?)</p>



<h2>Expat conflicts</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/grantm/">grantm</a> on 2004-06-09T19:19:22</h3>
<p>A common problem people encountered with Expat was that Apache included it by default.  So if you tried to load XML::Parser under mod_perl Apache would segfault with a symbol clash.  So the right solution is for the system to include a shared libexpat used by everyone that wants it.</p>

<p>Most Linux distributions provide Expat as a package and ActivePerl provides Expat in the distribution (PPM needs it).  When I was using Solaris an HPUX, I found that binary packages were not hard to come by.</p>

<p>PS: re the thanks for the FAQ - you're welcome.</p>
