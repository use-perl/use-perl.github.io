<div class="span8">
<p><p>Strawberry Perl 5.12.0 was almost completely installed when suddenly it flashed some message I didn't see into the install wizard and the progress bars started moving backward!  I have never seen anything like it.  I realized the progress bar caption had been changed to simply "Rolling Back Action" and watched as at least three anonymous "actions" were rolled back, progress bar by progress bar.  Then the install wizard simply told me "Strawberry Perl Setup Wizard ended prematurely  Strawberry Perl Setup Wizard ended prematurely because of an error.  Your system has not been modified.  To install this program at a later time, run Setup Wizard again.  Click the Finish button to exit the Setup Wizard."</p>

<p>I wish it would tell me what the error was so I might have some hope of correcting it.</p></p>

<h2>Previous version</h2>

<p>Looks like I fixed the problem by de-installing a previous version of Strawberry Perl.  I thought my previous version was so old it wouldn't even appear in add/remove programs.</p>

<p>That would do it.</p><p>Here's my bet as to why: The 5.12.0 versions run a perl script to do their relocation - when the script fails for some reason, it rolls back - and since it is a script, the only way to tell which file caused the problem is by reading the logs that normally do not get created, but can be asked for. This is something that was improved in the current betas, (we now run a DLL instead of a Perl script, so we can get back more information - running a script only gives us a "successful or not, and if not, log the output of the script" ) but still needs further improvement.</p>

<p>Thanks for the clarification, Diamond.  I appreciate the stellar product you guys are putting out and the fact that you're telling me this was fixed even before I mentioned it.  You guys must be psychic.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p><p>I may even be daring enough to run the betas; I'll have to see.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>
