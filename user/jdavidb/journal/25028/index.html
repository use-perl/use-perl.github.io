<div class="span8">
<p><p>I don't listen to music like most people listen to music.  I own about 20 CD's.  They are a mix of mostly movie soundtracks, classical pieces I played in high school band, and singing school recordings involving my wife and/or myself, or at least featuring songs written by friends of ours.</p>

<p>I'm particularly fond of the Star Wars soundtracks.  1999-2001 saw me listening to the Phantom Menace soundtrack something on the order of 10K times.  I kid you not; I could put that CD on repeat and shuffle and never get bored.  I would spend whole weeks at work listening over and over again.</p>

<p>I'm also slow in procuring the soundtracks I want.  We just now purchased the Attack of the Clones soundtrack.  The advantage of waiting so long is that things are a lot cheaper.</p>

<p>However, our CD comes with a label that states, "will <u>not</u> play on PC/MAC."  Aside from the worry that the CD would not work with my Ethernet cards, I was quickly pacified when we tried the disk on Sarah's computer and it worked just fine.  It also plays just great on our Tivo.</p>

<p>But today I brought it to work.  And sure enough, the CD refuses to load.  It just spins the drive (so much so, and so noisily, that I'm somewhat concerned about damage).  This stinks.  I borrowed a friends Attack of the Clones CD in 2002 and it worked just fine.</p>

<p>I'm not sure where I need to go to find out if this is one of those CDs that will work just fine if I mark around the center edge with a black marker.  I did try holding down the shift key when inserting it, and that did not work.</p>

<p>I guess I'll take the disk home and rip it to MP3 on my wife's computer, then burn the MP3's and bring them to work.</p>

<p>And if that doesn't work, I'll download the tracks from the Internet.  (If I can figure out how; I haven't much kept up with that scene since Napster, holding out for Freenet to become useable.)  And I'll feel now qualms at all.  I own this disk.  I have a license to hear this music.  I WILL hear it, when and where I want.</p>

<p>At long last I am finally disgruntled with Lucas.</p></p>

George Lucas is the luckiest man in Hollywood.  Not only is James Earl Jones still around to do the cameo voiceover for Vader, but John Williams is still around to score the last movies of the cycle.  Nevertheless, the only thing that sucks more than the plots to Lucas' movies is the dialog.  None of that has any impact on the soundtracks, all of which were scored by John Williams.
<p>
You can still love the soundtracks, and yet be seriously disgruntled with Lucas.  (I'm still waiting for my $6.50 back from Jedi...)
</p> <p>
John Williams, on the other hand, need apologize for nothing.</p>

<p>My wife and I love all six of the movies.  Her favorite is Jedi.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)  Hence my reference to the fact that only now am I disgruntled with Lucas.</p>

<p>Turns out I have a UK version of this disc.  The American version is not copy-protected.</p>

<p>Reading indicates this may be the kind of problem solveable with a marker, but I'm supposed to be able to see a clear separation between an outside fake data track and the inside audio tracks.  I don't see it.</p>

It also sounds like the version of copy protection that tries to install a driver at AUTORUN...<br> <br>No adays if the label mentions that it might not play or doesn't conform to CD standards, I don't buy it...like the latest Dave Matthews CD.<br> <br>If I really have to have it, I make sure to hold down the shift key to keep that driver from installing.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br> <br>It's funny how their copy protection just makes me more inclined to download the CD illegally.

<p>Yep.  That was the main theme of my post.</p>

<p>From what I understand, this is not correctable by shift.  It may be correctable by felt tip marker, but I'm scared to try.</p>

I can't wait until they do a complete set of the first three like 4/5/6 where it's an uneditied soundtrack that exactly matches the movie.<br> <br>Ever since I saw ROTS, I've had that darn fight music in my head...duh duh dududuh...duh duh duduh...with the low bas/tenor voices chorale in the background....<br> <br>Damnit...I'm going to have to snag one of these CDs tonight to get the earwig out of my head.

And the moment you say "fight music", I'm flashing back to ST:TOS fight music, used in nearly every episode.  Kirk vs $beast_of_the_week.

The music from episode Arena, where Kirk and Spock have to fight to the death? The same thing they make fun of in The Cable Guy.<br> <br>I have that clip on my computer. I'll break it out every now and then when I hear two people in my area arguing about something...<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

<p>They already have the "Ultimate Edition" soundtrack for Episode I, which I have and enjoy, and which is pretty much exactly as you describe.  They did not do one for Episode II, and I was quite disappointed.  I pretty much gave up hope of seeing one for II and III, but maybe some day.</p>

<p>Do you have the "special edition" soundtrack for VI (ROTJ)?  Does it still have the Ewok victory song from the original ending, which was removed for the special edition?  I've gotten conflicting reports on this.  I want those soundtracks, too, but for me Star Wars just does not end without the Ewok victory song.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

Duel of the Fates is the theme I was thinking of.
