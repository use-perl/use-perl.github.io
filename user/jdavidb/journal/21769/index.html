<p><p>I've requested tickets for Sarah and myself to attend the Presidential inauguration.  I didn't realize this before, but U.S. citizens can request them from either of their Senators or their Representative.</p>

<p>I was last in the capital city at the age of 2, and believe it or not I can remember sitting with my dad on the edge of something look across some distance to see the capitol and hearing him explain to me what it was.  Since that time I've always planned to go back; when we heard during the recent Reagan funeral how many people had just jumped up and changed plans to be there, we wished we had, too.  We had in fact talked about trying to be in DC for Christmas.</p>

<p>All of this made it easy to jump at the idea when I saw the request form on Senator Cornyn's website.  I figure that the Senator owes me something, anyway, for driving around for the past two years since he was elected with his sticker on the back of my car.  Of course, we won't know until January if we actually get tickets, but we bought plane tickets anyway and will at least get to take our long desired trip to DC.</p></p>
