<p><p>How do you think it would go over if I started refusing to attend any meetings at work without a clear agenda spelling out what is to take place?</p>

<p>In general, I just never need to be "on a call."  People need to ask me questions, and occasionally I need to ask questions, which best takes place in private phone calls or email.</p>

<p>Thankfully I don't have to attend a lot of meetings, but those that do are often just a complete waste!</p></p>

If you just said, "<b>No, I'm not going</b>".<br> <br><br/><br/>
Let us know how that works out!



<h2>The Mute Button</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jmcada/">jmcada</a> on 2005-08-12T17:11:49</h3>
I end up in meetings all of the time at my job.  In the past, I would attend in person and would end up day-dreaming the meeting away.  Now, I have found that I can call-in to the meetings and stay at my desk and be just as effective.  If it is a meeting that I'm only present for occasional questions, I typically just put on the headset and hit the mute button.  When a question comes up, the meeting leaders have learned to say my name so that it gets my attention and then ask the question... I end up with the best of both worlds, present in the meeting and at my desk getting work done.  Also, if they ask something that needs to be looked up, I'm right at a computer and can answer immediately.

Right on, the headset and mute button rule.

<p> Of course, sometime we have to say "John, you're talking to your mute button" to someone of whom we've asked a question.

</p><p>And even better, we techies can IM each other during the meeting to get the facts straight during the meeting -- both as a back-channel of those in the meeting and as a lifeline from those in to those out but with the real info.

</p><p>And of course, at my desk with headset, I have full access to my email log, server status, google, and intranet search to answer questions.

</p><p>Or even get work done<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... or read use.perl.org... if the meeting gets  irelevant.
