I'm wondering if I should make someone my enemy just to see what the face looks like...<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

<p>Somebody clear this up for me.  Is the ability to tell who named you "friend" or not a change, or has it always been that way.  Because I thought the message used to say, "Who you pick as a friend is private; it cannot be used against you," but it says just the opposite.  Did it change, or am I blind?</p>

<p>Actually, if you saw how thick my glasses are, you'd say I'm blind.  But seriously.</p>

No, it said just the opposite.  It's always said it is NOT private, that it CAN be used against you.  I remember because when we designed the feature, I insisted on making sure that disclaimer was there for the time when we might decide to make the information available.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

<p>Somehow I misread it the first time through.  No harm done, though.  (So far I've marked only two people as friends.  Not that I don't like anyone else, just not making full use of the feature yet.)  I always presume anything I do here can be visible to the full Perl community, because you run the site, and everybody knows you.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)  (And I don't see that as a problem.)</p>

<p>Y'all can pick me and I won't get my feelings hurt.  (Just don't leave it permanent.)</p>

<p>Hey, can the message system notify us when someone picks us as a friend (or un-friend)?</p>

It can, in theory, but it's not set up to do that.  It'd be relatively easy to add, but I have no plans to do it.
