<p><p>Had some funniness after I posted the Abigail entry.  Apparently I wiped out the entry of the Mac::Perl talk.  So, these two are out of order.</p>

<p>Note this: Chris's wife sounds tired of telling people that her
baby's name does NOT include the word "pudge."  Please take note of
this should you ever get to meet the Nandors in person.
<p>Chris's presentation was made with the assitance of Riley, who was
strapped around him where she could get a good view of the audience.
Youngest YAPC presenter ever (3 months).
<p>Chris (pudge) is the MacPerl maintainer and has been since Jan
2001.  MacPerl is a much better thing today than it used to be.  It
<i>closely</i> tracks the main Perl code base now.
<p>Some people still like classic Mac (OS 9) better than OS X.
<p>Pudge just posted a <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/pudge/journal/6045">journal entry</a> on use Perl; live with MacPerl and
some command-key combination.
<p>Pudge's presentation works really well with these Next, Previous,
and Document menus and buttons in his browsers.  I need to figure out
how he did that; it looks useful.
<p>Pudge doesn't like AppleScript, but it is very, very useful.
<p>A lot of what MacPerl does isn't necessary for OS X.  However, there
are some very good reasons to get it running there.
<p>You can run MacPerl in classic in OS X, but it's slow.  We got to
hear one of Riley's favorite songs. :)
<p>AppleEvents can pass out of classic into OS X.  You can control
iTunes, which runs under OS X, from MacPerl in classic in OS X.
Demoed, with another of Riley's favorite songs.
<p>Announcement: macperl tool to run under OS X.  You heard it here
first, folks!  (Actually, since I won't post this for a while, you'll
probably hear it somewhere else first.)  The "macperl" tool is
actually a Perl script that passes into MacPerl in classic.  This
warps your brain.  Cool.
<p>Full access to the Carbon API is slowly maturing.  Meanwhile, Chris
is working on straight ports of existing useful Mac::* modules.
<p>Graphical user interface stuff is up and running well.  Nice looking
"shux" POD browser.
<p>Inline::C works fine with Carbon and probably with Cocoa as well.
Wow.  There is some magic code you need to include that the MacPerl
programmers have figured out: linking flags, and so on.  As a measure
of how well this works, if he hadn't told us he was using it, we
wouldn't have known.
