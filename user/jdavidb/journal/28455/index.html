<p><p>I'm feeling inappropriately proud of myself.</p>

<p>Big Manager just looked in on The Project.  Really, The Project shouldn't be happening.  This is obvious to me, but not politically expedient for me to say.  Today, though, Big Manager (whom I've never met) is asking questions that he indicate he is wondering why The Project exists.  He actually sounds like one of the smarted Big Managers I've ever heard from.</p>

<p>So I decided to find a way to provide more information to Big Manager yet sound like I'm trying to help the cause of the project.  I helpfully "provided more information" that pointed to the obvious conclusion, with a tone of voice that sounded just ever so helpful as possible.</p>

<p>Now Big Manager wants to have another meeting that includes my manager and the manager of The Project to get a real picture as to what is going on. :)</p></p>

<h2>Careful ...</h2>

<p>More than once I've discovered that management reads my journal(s).</p>

<p>Immediate management for me is about to find out today my candid opinion about the project.  So I think it's all good.</p>

<p>I did think slightly fearfully about posting this as I sometimes direct coworkers to technical entries in my journal.  But I think they rarely prowl around otherwise, and I'm hopeful that by the time anyone does (if ever) that it won't be an issue.</p>

<p>Besides<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... I'm reporting on FIVE dotted lines right now.  If anyone sees this, I just claim, "No, yours is not the project I was talking about."<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<p>(Note to any of my bosses reading this: the previous paragraph is tongue in cheek, and as you know, you can trust me to be honest, and though being candid is sometimes discouraged around here I definitely will upon request.)</p>

<h2>Well ...</h2>

Your boss is David Wheeler, so that's a reasonable expectation. If your boss isn't a coder, I would be surprised if they read use.perl, especially if you're posting under an alias.



<h2>Hmmm</h2>

<i>I helpfully "provided more information" that pointed to the obvious conclusion, with a tone of voice that sounded just ever so helpful as possible.</i> <p>This is exactly what managers do to each other!  Your path to the dark side is almost complete.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>

<p>ROTFL!  If it involves more money and not many more hours, I'll take the promotion.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>
