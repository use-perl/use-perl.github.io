<p><p>Got my numbers wrong since I was going from memory.  My total cholesterol is actually 260, not 250!</p>

<p>I'm sitting here eating a bowl of cheerios in 1% milk.  My dad and sister made me load up on boxes of cheerios, 2 for $4 at Walgreen's tonight.  I guess I'll add a bowl of cheerios a day to my list.  I like cheerios but haven't been eating them often since the store brands are noticeably inferior and I prefer to buy store brands to save money.  It's kind of weird going from a "save money at all costs" way of thinking [due to my former surplused condition] to a "avoid cholesterol at all costs" way of thinking.</p>

<p>You know what's annoying?  If I buy more than a quart of milk, I end up throwing some out.  But the store (well, Kroger at least) only sells quarts of whole (3.5%), 2%, and skim milk!  I had to buy a half gallon.  Fortunately my girlfriend will be visiting soon and will help me consume some, but it looks like I'll be throwing out 50 cents every time I buy milk now, at least until I can taper down to skim.</p>

<p>I'm still hungry.  Hmm, I wonder if I can have another bowl of cheerios.</p></p>

Hi David,<br/><br/>I'm glad to see that you're alive and well, even if your cholesterol is too high...you could drop an email once in a while, you know my address. It seems all the addresses I have from you are outdated.

<p>Wow<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... hey, good to hear from you.  Didn't know you were watching here.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)  Email should be the same as before; let me email you and see what happens.</p>

<h2>Powdered milk</h2>

Give powdered milk a try.  We can't tell any difference in taste from the real thing, we can mix up as much or as little as we like at a time, and we don't feel bad about throwing it out since it's so inexpensive.<p>John</p>
