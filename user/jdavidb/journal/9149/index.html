<p><p>Okay, so I've shoved DBD::Excel and all its prerequisites onto an IIS system, and I can get all the modules to load, but when I try to connect to an Excel spreadsheet I get an error from OLE::Storage_Lite that just says "Error PPS:0"  This is from somewhere inside the constructor; looks like one of those situations that the author thought could never happen.</p>

<p>Any ideas?  Anyone have experience in this?</p></p>

I can't remember exactly what it means, something like it failed to open the file, or failed to parse it as an OLE compound document. Try opening it first and passing in a FH (if that's possible).

<p>Thank you, thank you!  I'll try it immediately.  (Wait, hmm, can I do that in DBI?  Well, since I'm uploading my own copies of the modules, maybe I can kludge it...)</p>

<p>Have slept on it and traced it down to an unpack statement that's deciding on a type of PPS (whatever a PPS is); the unpack yields a 5 on Linux and 0 on Win32.  If this is the case, I wonder even if I hardwire it to 5 or something if the spreadsheet will parse correctly.  Unpack is not portable?</p>

<p>Eek, I boiled down to a Spreadsheet::ParseExcel example and tried this; still didn't work.  It comes down to some place where something tries to unpack the string "^E^A" as an unsigned char.  I have a feeling that in Win32 it's trying to unpack "^E^A" or something.  That said, I probably can't trust the entire module, because there's no telling how many non-portable unpack statements there might be.</p>
