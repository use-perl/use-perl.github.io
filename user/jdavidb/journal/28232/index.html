<p><p>Awhile back I related <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/jdavidb/journal/27843">this conversation</a> between my wife and me.</p>

<p>Well, as it turns out, Sarah is pregnant with our second child.  So I gave her the same gift for Christmas this year as last year.  Only she has to wait until August or so.</p>

<p>We announced this to our families by having Joseph wear <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/58694384@N00/77283246/">this shirt</a> at family Christmas gettogethers and waiting until someone noticed.  It took two hours for anyone in my family to discover it; my mother failed to see it even though she took off Joseph's jacket and fed him, and finally when my sister got to hold him she made the discovery.  We should have awarded a prize.</p>

<p>The story was different at Sarah's parents' house, as the minute after we arrived Joseph needed an emergency diaper change after creating a huge mess.  My mother-in-law managed to stand staring straight at him but not noticing, waiting for us to unpack diapers and wipes, etc.  It wasn't until she came back after bathing the baby to collect the clothes for the washing machine that we suddenly heard a surprised yelp. :)</p>

<p>Sending the link to that picture to friends was entertaining, as some of them failed to notice not only the shirt but the big black headline, simply saying what a nice picture it was.</p></p>
