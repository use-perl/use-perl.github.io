<p><p>I'm still having <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/jdavidb/journal/28978">my SNMP problem</a> (and after <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/jdavidb/journal/28984">yesterday</a>, I'm not really any closer than I was on Monday.  Today I'm trying every other SNMP module I can find, and any other ideas I have.  If it doesn't work by the end of the day, I'm going to forget using the module and just parse the output of the snmpwalk command.  Sigh.</p>

<p>Presently I think I'm installing an alternative module to Net::SNMP which will actually talk directly to the same library that snmpwalk uses.  I suppose Net::SNMP is a pure Perl implementation of the protocol.</p>

<p>I did discover that when I try to do what snmpwalk does, which I think consists of repeated calls to get_next_request, it simply skips this Counter64 value (I should get the MIB that points at it returned at some point, but I never do; it simply returns the next non-Counter64 value), while when I pass in that MIB directly to get_request, it gives me this error: "Received noSuchName(2) error-status at error-index 1."  Whatever that is.</p></p>

<h2>What version?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Mr. Muskrat/">Mr. Muskrat</a> on 2006-03-15T20:31:01</h3>
I too am trying to wrap my head around SNMP.  What version are you using: 1, 2, 3?  It sounds quite a bit like you are SNMPv2 when using snmpwalk but SNMPv1 when using Perl.  Version 1 doesn't know about Counter64's and it does in fact return noSuchName when it is asked for one.  See RFC2089, Mapping SNMPv2 onto SNMPv1 within a bi-lingual SNMP agent.  Specifically bullet point 2 under both <a href="http://rfc.net/rfc2089.html#s3.1" title="rfc.net">Section 3.1 Processing an SNMPv1 GET request</a rfc.net> and <a href="http://rfc.net/rfc2089.html#s3.2" title="rfc.net">Section 3.2 Processing an SNMPv1 GETNEXT request</a rfc.net>.

<p>Hmmm, I was pretty sure it was version 2 (or version 2c???) for both, but you raise a good point that I should check that.  Thank you.</p>

<p>THANK YOU!!!!!!  That was my problem!!!</p>

<p>Net::SNMP defaults to version 1.  I'm using version 2 with snmpwalk.  (Actually apparently the formal name is 2c, but Net::SNMP names it "2".)</p>

<p>I had only thought to be explicit about the version with snmpwalk, which wanted to use 3 by default and failed to work at all, with noisy error messages.  Using 1 only silently failed for the Counter64's.</p>

<p>I owe you a drink sometime, but since I don't buy alcohol, maybe we'll make it a soda and a burger.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)  Thank you so much for resolving this for me.</p>

Glad I could help.  I work in Irving near 161 and 114, perhaps we can do lunch sometime.

<p>Wow; yeah.  Didn't realize you were in the area.  I definitely owe you lunch, so we'll have to arrange that at some point.</p>
