<p><p>We're about to have a huge auction of books: O'Reilly, Manning,
Addison-Wesley, and others.  And two Stitch dolls from the new Disney
movie.  (Thank the mouse for us, Robert. :) )  The "this will be over
all-too-soon" atmosphere seems to be building up a bit.  Hopefully
Damian's talk in a little while will dispel it.  Of course, then it
will be over and that will be all too soon.
<p>I've never heard a Damian talk before.
<p>It was suggested we all use our laptops to just put these books up
on ebay and sell them off real fast.
<p>Abigail and Ann volunteered to help take money and hand out books.
<p>Joe (gizmo_mathboy) bought Brent Michalski's CGI book for $40 from
the balcony.
<p>For some reason the Java and Python books didn't go for prices as
high as comparable books.
<p>It got real hard to tell what was going on at some point.  I think
some books wound up going to people other than the highest bidders.
<p>Complete set of Manning Perl books: $100.
<p>The bioinformatics books seemed to be a hard sell; possibly because
most people who wanted them already had them.
<p>I got Running Weblogs with Slash for $20.  I expected it to go for
more.
<p>Ruby in a Nutshell went for $20.  First bid.  No snide remarks like
there were for some other languages.  Hmmm.  Must check out Ruby.
<p>Programming Python 900 page book.  Kevin drops it with a thud and
says, "There's a lot of whitespace."  :)
<p>I got Learning Python for $10.
<p>We just analyzed a Beginning Web Design book to death before someone
finally bid.
<p>Two Stitch dolls from the man from Disney.
<p>This was great.  Short break, and then my mind will commence its
self-destruction. :)
</p>

Normally it would, but someone must have let on that there's a (brief) biography of <a href="http://cmdrtaco.net/" title="cmdrtaco.net">Rob Malda</a cmdrtaco.net> near the beginning.
