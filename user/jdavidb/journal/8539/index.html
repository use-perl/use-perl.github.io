On the first day I posted downloadable music, my merchandise sales tripled, and they have stayed that way ever since. I'm not about to become a zillionaire as a result, but I am making more money. At a time when radio playlists are tighter and any kind of exposure is hard to come by, 365,000 copies of my work now will be heard. Even if only 3% of those people come to concerts or buy my CDs, I've gained about 10,000 new fans this year.</p>

<p>I'm not really as motivated about music downloading as some of you guys, but I thought you'd find this interesting if you hadn't seen it.  I don't even know who Janis Ian is. :)  (My tastes in music tend toward John Williams.)  But I am interested in "intellectual property" conerns and how it relates to technology, and potential new business models that may arise when the entire world gets a clue as to how bits work.</p></p>

Her best known song, at least it's the only one <em>I</em> know, is "Fly too High", dating from around 1980.

I would say that her best known song is <i>At Seventeen</i>, from 1975.<br> <p> <a href="http://lubbockonline.com/news/102697/uk5518.htm" title="lubbockonline.com">An interesting article that recaps her life in advance of a tour she undertook in the late 90's</a lubbockonline.com> , seems to agree that this was her biggest hit.  I learned from that article that she wrote a hit song about Interracial Dating in <b>1966</b>, when she was <b>15 years old</b> (possibly 16 years old, but still)!  It's amazing enough that you could have a hit song about such a sensitive subject in 1966, but written by a 15 or 16 year old makes it even more remarkable.<br> </p><p> <i>At Seventeen</i> is a great and poignant song.  Sung really well by Janis, also.  Don't just read the lyrics somewhere, find a copy and listen.</p>
