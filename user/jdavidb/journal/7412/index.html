<p><p><a href="http://www.procomputing.com/">ProComputing</a> called me back yesterday to say my ibook was fixed.  The power adapter in the machine was bad, as well as my power cable, as well as the power cable the lady at the desk used to test it for me initially.  Oh, well.</p>

<p>Total cost was about $160, so in my mind that cost has been added to the price I paid for this refurbished machine.  I've bought refurbished items from the manufacturer before, but this came from a third-party refurbisher.  Maybe I'll keep that in mind next time I buy a machine.</p>

<p>The $160 includes a $45 diagnostic fee.  ($100 is for the new power cable!)  CompUSA quoted me a fee of $140, but I think that was just the diagnostic fee.  Even if that's their total fee, it's worth $20 to deal with people who aren't jerks.</p>

<p>Last night was the first night my professor came to class.  He took one look at my ibook and said, "Did you switch, now?"  Apparently he never realized I was a Mac man in the first place.  Of course, I did switch to Debian. :)  This is the same professor who made the remark about how you couldn't do object oriented programming in Perl two years ago.  I have ribbed him about it ever since.</p>

<p>Oh, and he says we're going to be using Agile development and XP!</p></p>
