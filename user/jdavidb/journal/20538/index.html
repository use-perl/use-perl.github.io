<p><p>Actually I am still on an older version, so it is Firebird.</p>

<p>I was just trying to pull up a few news articles on an Olympic event that interested me.  The first one took forever to load, so I clicked on a few others, which also all seemed slow.  Then suddenly I got a popup I'd never seen before:</p>

<pre>
A script on this page is causing mozilla to run slowly. If it continues to run, your computer may become unresponsive. Do you want to abort the script?
</pre>

<p>Bravo!  Three cheers for Mozilla!  That feature just shot to the top of my list of reasons to use Mozilla, even above popup blocking and compatibility with some sites that just don't like IE.</p>

<p>I didn't even really realize this was a problem, though I knew it was theoretically possible.  I wonder if a lot of slow loading I see is due to this.  I wonder if they could make the check for this a little more strict.</p>

<p>What might be better is a convenient way to enable javascript on a page-by-page basis.  (That's probably in there and I just don't know.)</p></p>

<p>I've not encountered your particular feature, but more recent incarnations of Firefox allow disabling of the more intrusive forms of Javascript trickery (I particularly detest sites that try to change the status bar text).
</p><p>That's <i>my</i> killer feature.</p>
