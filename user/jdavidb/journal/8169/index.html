<p><p>A lot of important things happened on July 19th.  Perl 5.8.0 was released.  A lot of you were getting ready to leave for TPC.  I stayed up late getting ready to leave for singing school the next day.  And in the midst of it all, a long-expected event happened I completely failed to notice: Debian 3.0 was released.  Yep, for two and a half months, Debian 3.0 was out there and <b>I didn't know</b>!</p>

<p>I finally found out yesterday; I thought at first I had just forgotten in all of the joy and excitement of installing 5.8.0 and leaving for singing school (I remember I debated whether to install 5.8.0 on my laptop, which I took with me, before I left; then decided packing was more important).  After that week I was pretty much wiped of any important short-term information I knew before.  Turns out, though, that the announcement hit slashdot around 5:30 that evening (my timezone), and I was already home and practically cut off from the net at that point.</p>

<p>Yes, I live under a rock.</p>

<p>Of course, because I run the testing distribution, and because I use apt-get frequently, I've actually been running 3.0+, and just didn't know it. :).</p></p>
