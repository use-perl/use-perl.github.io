&gt; LD_LIBRARY_PATH, which explains why you should never be using this variable<br><br>That's not what he said, read again.  There are still legitimate uses for LD_LIBRARY_PATH (and its moral equivalents, not all platforms call it that).  For example, Perl's build process uses that for a very good reason.<br><br>

<p>When I said "you" should never be using this variable, I meant the average person reading what I was writing.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)  People who've done heavy hacking on Perl's build process have a high probability of running into the legitimate use cases for it, and I knew that.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<p>Basically, if the developers of a package do their job right, and know what LD_LIBRARY_PATH is for and what it is not for, the <i>end user</i> should almost never, ever have to use it.  If I purchase a huge commercial package like, say, Oracle, and have to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH to use it, the developers of that package have not done their job right.  Likewise if I compile all the pieces of GNOME from scratch and put it in a non-standard location.</p>

I've always wondered why some versions of Oracle had it set to something and others didn't.  I don't recall needing it for 10.1.0.3 but during the 10.2.0.x installation it gets set.  Now that I think about it, it may just been the DBAs that tweaked our installation scripts.

<p>Let me also amplify that not only should a user never set LD_LIBRARY_PATH, it should never be set for him.</p>

<p>LD_LIBRARY_PATH is a developer-only variable.  It's a test-time option, not a run-time option.  Unfortunately due to many developers who don't know what they're doing, it becomes a necessary run-time option for some apps.  But even then it should only be used as a method of last resort to get them running!</p>
