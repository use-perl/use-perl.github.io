<h2>How about an MP3 of me describing the problem?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/merlyn/">merlyn</a> on 2006-03-02T01:48:09</h3>
Or an MP4 of a video capture of me handwaving while describing the problem?



<h2>Yes, not so obvious...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Alias/">Alias</a> on 2006-03-02T04:12:13</h3>
Why would people be sending you screenshots exactly?

<p>Allegedly to illustrate the problem.</p>

<h2>A picture is worth a, er</h2>

Reminds me the day we got at perl5-porters a bug report containing a jpeg file, copy of a DOS console displaying a rather trivial perl error (such as "Global symbol requires explicit package name" or so). (Can't find it now.) Nicholas commented privately that this way of reporting bug was crap: the reported could have used, at least, a lossless image compression format!



<h2>Unfortunately, this is SOP where I work</h2>

If users have a problem with our GUI app, they'll copy the entire screen and send it rather than just describe what the problem is. When there's a SQL error, a box pops up with the current SQL statement. Unfortunately, it's a scrolled box and the statement is usually truncated in the screenshot. I often have to tell them to copy and paste all of the text in that box<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

Sounds like you need a "Report This Problem" button on the SQL dump thing.

<h2>so what's the problem...?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jhi/">jhi</a> on 2006-03-03T06:35:31</h3>
I used to routinely debug intranet apps (web frontend, db backend) using Windows<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.BMP snapshots, each sized several dozen megabytes... it made one debug fast unless I wanted my email quota to run out pretty quickly.<br><br>

<p>File size is often a problem, but the big problem is the often irrelevancy or redundancy of the screenshots.</p>



<h2>Re:so what's the problem...?</h2>

<p>Oh, and sending it to me when I'm not the one responsible for the problem (because you CC'ed it to everybody and their dog) is also a problem, particularly if it's a really big file.</p>

<p>I have very few apps for which a screenshot would help in debugging.</p>
