<div class="span8">
<p><p>I have a hash of hashes.  Slices in this context are notably underrepresented in the Perl literature I've consulted (POD's and Camel).</p>

<p>I've done this before, but always by experimentation.  Time has taught me not to depend on something I've only learned by verifying against an implementation.</p></p>


<hr/>



<h2>And this is how to do it:</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jdavidb/">jdavidb</a> on 2002-06-17T19:04:26</h3>
<blockquote><div>
<code>
$hash{hash} = {five =&gt; 5, six =&gt; 6, seven =&gt; 7};<br>
@vals = @{$hash{hash}}{qw(five seven)};
</code>
</div></blockquote>

<p>Note, don't make the mistake of
</p><blockquote><div>
<code>
@vals = $hash{hash}-&gt;{qw(five seven)};
</code>
</div></blockquote>
which parses correctly but does not give you what you're looking for.

<p>I don't think I'd even know about slices if it weren't for the warning you get with <code>@array[$i]</code>.</p>

<p>One of my beefs about perl is that it doesn't come with a good interactive environment (unlike python).  I frequently test things against an implementation, just to see whether something works or not; I usually go to the documentation afterwords.<nobr> <wbr></nobr><tt>:-)</tt>

</p><p>I must say though, that hash slices are one of those things that I nearly always avoid if possible; they're just too visually cluttered.</p>

<p>It's not a <i>very</i> good interactive environment, but you can use the debugger with a command like <code>perl5.6.1 -de 1</code>.  I do it often, including yesterday when playing with slices.</p>

<p>I haven't completely decided if I should avoid hash slices or not.  I'll agree they seem cluttered.  I'll have to wait until I'm maintaining this code three years from now to decide.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)  For now I'm using them because they seem less cluttered than the alternative.</p>

I don't understand what you mean.  Yes, there is perl -d, as mentioned, and you can always use perl -e itself, too.  But not knowing what you mean, I can't say if these are sufficient to your desires.<br> <br>Testing is sometimes a problem.  For testing Slash, I wrote <tt>Slash::Test</tt>, which exports the four major objects, Dumper(), the entire API, all the constants, all the available plugin objects, etc. so I can do stuff like:<blockquote><div> <tt>% perl -MSlash::Test=useperl -e 'print Dumper $slashdb-&gt;getUserFoo($user-&gt;{uid})'</tt> </div></blockquote>Everything I need is right there, so I don't need to bother setting it up, and testing little snippets is very simple.  I can test templates, too:<blockquote><div> <tt>% perl -MSlash::Test=useperl -eDisplay<br>[% USE Dumper; Dumper.dump( Slash.db.getUserFoo(user.uid) ) %]<br>^D</tt> </div></blockquote>etc.<br> <br>Testing environments are important, but if perl doesn't have one you need, it's not too hard to write one to suit your own purposes.<br> <br>As to hash slices, I use them sparingly, usually only when other methods are more cluttered.<br>

There are a few different interactive environments out there including the <code>perl -dead</code> that folks have mentioned.<br>For interactive exploration of complex structures, I've found <a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?dist=Data-Walker" title="cpan.org">Data::Walker</a cpan.org> to be very useful.
