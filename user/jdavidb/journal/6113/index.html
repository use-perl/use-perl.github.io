<p><p>I'm not too keen on the locksmith profession right now.</p>

<p>My grandmother has been losing her mind since the beginning of the year.  She's been in good shape for her 87 years, so it's pretty sad to see her go through this.  Two or three months ago we had to take away her car keys so she couldn't drive anywhere.  If she tried, she would either get lost or hurt somebody.  She's been pretty mad about it, but it's less like seeing my grandmother mad and more like seeing a young child having a temper tantrum.  She's even tried to walk away from the house a time or two.</p>

<p>So today, she hatched a plan.  She called a locksmith to come make keys for the car!  She's pretty crafty and devious for a woman whose mind is leaving her. :)  [/me blushes with pride]  When the man arrived my disabled (physically) grandfather explained to him why she had no keys and asked him to leave.</p>

<p>So, who do you think the locksmith believed?  That's right!  Our man with the tools followed the money and started tearing the car apart to make a new set of keys for my grandmother.  His excuse (given to my frightfully angry father, who arrived shortly after my grandfather called him)?  Well, he couldn't really tell which one was senile.  So, of course, he endangered my grandmother not to mention every pedestrian in this city by making a set of keys!  Way to take the profitable way out, buddy!</p>

<p>Yes, he got paid.  Dad made him put the car back together (the keys, which were already made, were delivered into the hands of my grandfather, at Dad's insistence) and allowed my grandmother to pay him.  Cash.  He probably won't even report it to his employer.  And when I came home this afternoon I was surprised to find my grandparents' car in my driveway and wondered what had happened.</p></p>
