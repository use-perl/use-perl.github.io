<div class="span8">
<p><p>Had a new icon in my toolbar which I assumed came from the Yahoo messenger which my boss asked me to install.  Turned out instead it was notification that "there's a new Macromedia flash player available."</p>

<p>You know, honestly I don't care.  But I do care about the icon: I don't want to see it.</p>

<p>My options, of course, are "update," "remind me later," and "settings."  No, I don't want you to remind me later.  Give me an "I don't care" button or checkbox that just turns it off.  That must be in "settings," right?</p>

<p>But settings takes me to a webpage.  That's right, I have to go online to change my settings.  Utterly bizarre.  I want the programs on MY computer (well, my company's) to be configured by me.  I don't want them configured by a database on some other company's computer.  I don't want that company to even know I exist.  I don't want my program to check online to see if it should check online to find updates.</p>

<p>What utter crap.</p>

<p>It looks like it's possible this is just a flash applet that lets you change your local settings.  But I can't tell.  And Macromedia's not a company I trust to make the right decision about what level of the API stack should hold a piece of information.  (I mean that in a software engineering sense, but I suppose I feel the same way in a privacy sense.)</p></p>

As of a little while ago, s/Macromedia/Adobe/<br><br>And after being told to upgrade Acrobat with a maximum "remind me later" of "3 days", I trust them even less than Macromedia.
