<p><p>Personally, I'm all for deregulation of utility companies.  But if we're going to regulate them anyway, can't we enforce legal standards for online payment websites?  I can't pay my bill for Public Utility X tonight because it doesn't work with either Netscape 4.7 or IE for Macintosh.  Hmm...I guess I could put Windows on that Intel at my feet.  Of course, that would obliterate my Linux installation, and it's a moot point anyway since the power supply died Tuesday.</p>

<p>Honestly, it's so easy to write a secure CGI application that works with any browser.  The only time you wind up with a nonportable webapp is when you try to do something special.  Online management of accounts and secure transactions isn't special; it's textbook.</p>

<p>Since we're regulating the utilities anyway, shouldn't it be illegal to design an incompetent website like this?  Isn't it discriminatory or something?</p>

<p>So, I click the "next" button, which could've been a simple submit button in a form, but instead has an icon and who-knows-what-kind of javascript behind it.  Why do you need to script a submit button!?  And when I click it -- the website resizes itself so that the right 1/2 of the page shows in my browser.  No horizontal scrollbar; it's like the left 50% just disappeared.  Not a new page, either; the same page, with all my info filled in, waiting to be submitted.  When I think of all the extra hours put in to make the site "special" I want to vomit.</p>

<p>I could've written their payment site in a week, and it would have been better.</p></p>
