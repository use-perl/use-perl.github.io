<p><p>I expected RT installation to be a little rough.  You know, some things to enter on my own that installation scripts will figure out on their own a few years from now, extra modules to install, and so on.  (Actually, they got the extra modules part down great, except for the aforementioned <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/jdavidb/journal/6313">problem with deprecated Mason features</a>.)  But hey, I've handled rough installations before.  I was ready to rise to the challenge.</p>

<p>I'm having to rise a little higher than I want.  One of the last steps of the process is to change the root RT user's password from the default of "password."  The docs mention not doing so is a security risk, and plenty of mails in the archive contain questions like, "Did you see the part where it says in BIG BLACK LETTERS to CHANGE THE DEFAULT PASSWORD!?!" (I'm exaggerating.)</p>

<p>Unfortunately I get a weird "No RT user found. Please consult your RT administrator." error when I try that.  Several people have had this problem and been told to go into the WebUI to add/change/delete users.  That makes sense if they are later along in the process, but I haven't even gotten past the installation yet.  (And, of course, I already tried it.  My first response was, "I'll accept the security risk for the time being and change it when I can.  I just go ahead and log into the WebUI!"  But I can't log in to the WebUI, either.)</p>

<p>There is a nice guy helping me on the mailing list, though.  I expect it won't take too long to figure out what's going on, and maybe they'll smooth it over in future versions of the installer.  If you're reading this, thanks Phil.</p></p>
