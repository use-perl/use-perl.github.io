<p><p>I've really enjoyed watching use Perl;'s popularity rise since I discovered it.  (I guess around a year and a half ago.)  I've recently noticed a milestone that I think indicates we've started to hit critical mass: twice this week when I've metamoderated, I've had 10 moderations to metamod.  It used to be one or two, and often none.</p>

<p>Congratulations, pudge.  And thanks.</p>

<p>I remember not long ago when pudge asked, "What else should we do to make this site useful?"  Around that time I think journal use just really took off.  On slashdot, moderating comments in journals just seems stupid (not that there's a problem with the concept or the code; it's just that most slashdotters don't have anything to say in their journals that I want to read and discuss).  Here I think it helped build community and keep us coming back.  Even if some of you guys wandered off into politics and other things. :)</p>

<p>Right now, use Perl; is my biggest participation the Perl community.  I haven't been to any conferences, and p5p and the p6 lists are just two much for me to stay subscribed to.  But here I enjoy the feeling that if I have some little insight I can post it and share it with everyone, and get feedback to see if I'm off base or not.  (To that end, I'd love to have people comment on <a href="http://use.perl.org/comments.pl?sid=3734&cid=5532">this</a>.)</p>

<p>So, thanks again, pudge, and I look forward to seeing the advance of this site and the code that runs it.</p></p>

After all, these are journals.  And while use Perl represents a community based on a shared technical interest, I think that this site (and the journals in particular) would be _awfully_ dull if the _only_ thing people ever wrote about was their latest bit of code.

I agree -- the whole point of these is that they're not <em>just</em> Perl, they're the edge of Perl, where Perl meets something else in your brain.  It isn't merely a discussion of code, but also a discussion of your (job|food|politics|problems), and Perl just happens to show up a significant amount of time.
<p>
Which isn't to say that code discussion's bad, just that this is a place for that and more.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

I'm down with discussion of code too.  I just don't feel limited to that particular area<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)

<p>I agree with you.  I just noticed quite a bit of political stuff recently and wanted to rib people about it.  To be serious, the site really is better because of those discussions.</p>

<p>Gasp!  You mean some of us have lives beyond coding?!</p>
