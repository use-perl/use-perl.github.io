<p><p>I'm starting to think that I'd really like to live without television as we know it.</p>

<p>Awhile back, I <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/jdavidb/journal/5497">lamented</a> the loss of Sailor Moon from broadcast television in my area.  Now, today I received my first <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/jdavidb/journal/6291">Sailor Moon DVD</a>.  (Yes, I like the DIC dubs.  Knowing me, isn't that what you'd expect? :) )</p>

<p>The arrival of this disk has prompted me to make a decision: I am finally going to buy a DVD player. :O  Yep, I have a DVD and nothing to play it on!</p>

<p>Didn't I read something awhile back looking for ideas that could allow television to survive without advertising revenue?  I'm at the point where, having identified a series I like, I'd rather just buy the whole thing on DVD and be done with it.  No ads, no Tivos (considered that, too).  Just let me pay for the show.  Sure, Sailor Moon is cheap because it's old, but the same is true for anything else for sale.  Buying something newer (like, say Buffy the Vampire Slayer ... I understand it's available, at least if you're lucky enough to live in the right area) would obviously cost more.</p>

<p>Alas, rather than allowing the market to evolve and take its course, we'll probably have laws passed to ensure evil people like you and me don't steal from our gracious providers of entertainment (oh, what would we do without them?) by skipping commercials.</p></p>

I recently started renting "The Sopranos" on DVD, since I don't have HBO, and I feel the same way, except that I'd prefer to rent since I have no real desire to watch a TV show over and over again.<br> <br>Unfortunately, Blockbuster has only the first season, even though the second season has been out for ages and the third just came out.  I've been trying to decide whether Netflix is worth it.

<a href="http://www.netflix.com/" title="netflix.com">Netflix</a netflix.com> is great, I never go to blockbusters anymore.
<p>
I'm pretty sure you can sign up for a 2 week free trial too.</p>

It's great if you watch many DVDs per month.  Blockbuster only charges $4 for a 1-week rental; Netflix is $20 a month.  I don't watch enough DVDs to make Netflix worth the money, and I'm not interested in becoming more of a couch potato.
