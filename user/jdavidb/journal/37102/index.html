<h1>MSSQL SQLServer FreeTDS Unicode collation error</h1>

<div class="span8">
<p><p>I'm using DBD::Sybase over FreeTDS to access an MS SQLServer database and getting the following commonly-encountered error:</p>

<pre>Unicode data in a Unicode-only collation or ntext data cannot be sent to clients using DB-Library (such as ISQL) or ODBC version 3.7 or earlier.</pre>

<p>This error is all over the net, seen by poor souls using Python, Borland tools, and I don't know what all else.  Sadly, most of them appear to have not found a solution, other than "change the type of your column."  That solution isn't available to me (if it were, I would be changing the type of my database!), so I had to keep digging until I found the real solution:</p>

<p>Set tds version = 8.0 in your freetds.conf file.  (Using 7.0 will also correct it, but after experimentation I chose to use the latest value.)</p>

<p>Pages and pages of grief and agony on the net would've been dispelled if somebody had known in all the many conversations that have ensued about this message.  I feel really bad when I see people asking questions over and over again and the answer never emerges.</p>

<p>For the record, I found the answer <a href="http://php.filearena.net/manual/kr/ref.mssql.php">here</a> after much searching, posted by "boonkit" on 2005-03-29.  But I had the idea in the back of my mind this could probably be solved by changing the TDS version, and if I hadn't found it here I was going to be cycling through each possible value and trying them.</p>

<p>Now I want to figure out how to set this in my DBI DSN string.  Until this moment, I didn't actually have to have a freetds.conf file. :)</p>

<p>Here's hoping that the next poor soul to encounter this error will Google for it and find the solution spelled out plainly here.  For the record, if you are such a soul and are clueless about what a freetds.conf file is and where to find yours, post here to give me a ring, and assuming I'm not dead by then, I'll try to help you out. :)</p>

<p><b>Update:</b> Experimented with the different TDS protocol versions, discovered 8.0 also works, decided to use that.</p></p>
