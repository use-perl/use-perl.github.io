<p><p>Last week my side of the building was practically empty.  Now there's five more people.  That means a lot of noise (especially since my job is mostly my in front of a screen, while some other jobs are mostly on the telephone).</p>

<p>This morning I couldn't concentrate at all.  I've been in this kind of environment before, but not in a long time.  I tried turning on the radio, but it wasn't enough.  Fortunately, a coworker here has a pair of green headphone-like earmuffs he loaned me.  Blissful silence.  I got more done than I have in a long time.  My friend doesn't remember where he got these, but as always, the Internet comes to the rescue.  If, like me, you are distracted by office noise, look <a href="http://www.elvex.com/earmuffs.htm">here</a>.  Elvex also sells earplugs, but I figured you could find those in the drugstore.</p>

<p>Anybody else bothered by office noise?  Having those earmuffs on was better than the door I've always wanted for my cube.</p></p>

<h2>headphones</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/gav/">gav</a> on 2002-06-20T18:09:38</h3>
I'm the opposite, I switched from the main office into the 'back' office which is a lot quieter (but with a window <a href="http://gavin.bock.com/" title="bock.com">view</a bock.com>). I share the room with 2 others but it's still really quiet. It feels a bit too quiet sometimes. I tend to make up for it by listening to my cds.
<p>
Just a thought, wouldn't it make more sense to wear headphones that provided music<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<p>Yes, but I've done that until I'm tired of it.  Also, I'm a little worried that constant music right in my ears could damage my hearing over the long term.  So I do headphones from time to time, but I was looking for an additional alternative.</p>

<p>I <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/jdavidb/journal/5133" title="perl.org">recently ripped</a perl.org> my entire CD collection to MP3's so I could put them on shuffle here.  Like I said, though, it gets tiring sometimes.  I want to listen to music because I felt like having some music, not because I'm trying to flee the noise.</p>

<h2>Noise-cancellation headphones</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ziggy/">ziggy</a> on 2002-06-20T19:32:05</h3>
Sounds like what you want is a pair of noise-cancellation headphones.  They tend to run about $100, and you can use them to get something approximating near absolute quiet, or use them as a pair of headphones to hear only music (and none of the background noise).
<p>
I think Bose makes a pair.  Should be able to find them in any decent stereo store (or high-end yuppie shop; they also work well on airplanes).
</p><p>
Be careful that you don't make your work area too quiet.  I was born with tinnitus, so I hear a constant ringing in the ears if the room is too quiet.  I find that I need some form of light background noise to distract from the ringing.  But too much noise is even more of a distraction.  (I haven't heard ringing all day; now that I mentioned it, I'll probably hear it for the rest of the afternoon...oh well.)</p>
