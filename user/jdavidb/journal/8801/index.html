<p><p>I read that _ (the operator formerly known as .) has been changed to ~.  I'm pretty happy about that; _ seems like a very expensive character to type, while I type ~'s all the time, and it seems much easier.  Both still require the use of a shift, but ~ feels like it's much closer.</p>

<p>Of course, I still like ..  Maybe there can be a syntax warping pragma for us . diehards.</p>

<p>I realize none of this makes any rational sense.</p></p>

* garghhhh *<br> <br>On a Swedish keyboard, the ~ is AltGraph-akey+Space. That's so we can produce chars like &#227; with the ~ on top of the a (we don't use that in Swedish, but still).<br> <br>Right now it's just annoying when writing urls with home directories. With ~ as a Perl operator, I'll have to bind it to a macro if I want to remain sane...<br> <p><nobr> <wbr></nobr>/J<br></p>

<p>Sorry to hear that.  I can see how it will be painful.</p>

<p>Maybe with the Perl 6 syntax warping features we'll both be able to:</p> <blockquote><div> <tt>{<br>&nbsp; use concatenator '.';<br>&nbsp;<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...<br>}</tt> </div></blockquote> <p>Out of curiosity, I would expect that =~ gives you grief today, too?  Maybe Swedish Perl programmers use $_ more often than others.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<h2>Why buck tradition?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/djberg96/">djberg96</a> on 2002-11-06T19:46:39</h3>
How about using what every other language uses for string concatenation: "+"
<p>
As for the ease of the "~" key - not if you're on a Sun keyboard.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<p>(Glances over at the blade I'm still not using more than this Linux box.)  Ooh, you're right.  Hadn't thought of that.</p>

<p>Why is it the price of getting the control key in the "right" place on my keyboard is totally losing the ~ key?</p>

Because in Perl, numbers and strings are easily interconverted.  Just try:<br> <br>perl -e 'print "5"+"6"'<br> <br>and see what happens!<br> <br>In any case, the dot operator is wonderful, and I'm disappointed that it's being changed at all.

<h2>Confusing</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/bart/">bart</a> on 2002-11-07T08:59:46</h3>
So now we'll have two similar but completely unrelated operators =~ and ~=. Hmm.
Just like we already had &lt;= and =&gt;.

I think =~ is turning into ~~ in perl6, so you'll just have the pre-existing pair to disambiguate.<br> <br>-matt

<p>I got my info from the latest Perl 6 summary, which also mentioned they were getting rid of (one of those...) for just that reason.</p>
