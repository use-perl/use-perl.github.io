<p><p>Well, I may have found The Right Way to accomplish my timed reads.  Term::ReadKey has a ReadKey() function (exported by default) that accepts a timeout and returns a first keystroke or undef if the timeout occurs.  So I can write a timed_read() routine around it which goes ahead and reads until $/ with &lt;>, prepends the first character, and moves on.</p>

<p>I've already got a routine with IO::Select, but it appears to not be working sometimes, and I don't know why.  Sometimes it times out when the input should be there.  I'll implement the ReadKey() version and see if it makes a difference.</p>

<p>Of course, when I discovered ReadKey() gave me what I needed, I looked to see how it was implemented.  The answer was that the author checks far more things about the system than I knew existed and then eval's one of many ReadKey() definitions into existence.  Wow!  Talk about a motivator for calling a module instead of cut-and-paste.</p>

<p>I'm doing all this over sockets, through inetd, just to be difficult, you know. :)  One of the first things I checked with Term::ReadKey was if it would work with a socket.  (Or, at least, a socket that looks like a STDIN.)  BTW, I absolutely love the Net::DummyInetd module, removed from the libnet distribution, but still available unless the author has done housekeeping.  (Like Matt Sergeant, who recently removed the older, pure-Perl version of Time::Object from CPAN before last Friday when I really needed it all of a sudden.  I forgive you, Matt! :) )  DummyInetd.pm can let you write your programs for inetd without having to set up inetd yourself.  (I let the sysadmins do that; they always want to keep control, anyway.)</p></p>

You don't need a sysadmin to set up inetd for you.  Just write your own configuration file and do:<br> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; %<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/usr/sbin/inetd ~/my-inetd.conf<br> <br>So long as the port you are using isn't below 1024 there shouldn't be any problem.<br> <br>BTW, if your sysadmin notices two copies of inetd running, she may start getting confused, so it's probably an idea to let her know what you're doing even though it's perfectly reasonable.<br> <br>-Dom

<p>Yep.  That's another advantage of the wrapper script.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<p>I think I did the personally run inetd a couple of years back, but the wrapper I've written with the DummyInetd module makes it easier because I don't have to do any setup.  It's just<nobr> <wbr></nobr><tt>./inetd path/to/program</tt>.  Also, don't you still have to configure<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/etc/services with inetd even if you're not root?  It's been awhile, so I don't remember.</p>
