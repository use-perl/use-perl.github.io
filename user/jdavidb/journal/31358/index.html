<p>You know, I don't want to cause more trouble for the film maker.  On the other hand, I don't feel that suppression of this movie is appropriate.  It's something that people wondering about Scientology should be aware of, if for no other reason than to let them research the background and find out if it's an accurate reflection of the church.</p>

<p> <i>You know, I don't want to cause more trouble for the film maker.</i> </p>

<p>I don't want to, either, but I have a very highly attuned and bullheaded sense of who is responsible for whose actions.  He did what he could to stop the film, but it is (thankfully, IMO) out of his hands, now.</p>

<p>The problem is, I wonder if the scientologist nuts will have anything like that sense of who is responsible.  He <i>can't</i> stop every copy of that film from circulating (nor should he be able to, IMO).  I wonder if they will still hold him responsible.</p>

<p>Maybe the proper reaction is not to cease distribution, but to start a fund to help Mr. Hannover deal with the fallout. Yeah, Scientology won&#8217;t like that either.</p>

<p>If that's even possible.  It may be a simple case where he needs a big lawyer.  But it may be a case where they said, "If you don't cooperate with us we'll tell everyone that we found out your brother is secretly gay."  (Or whatever secret it is that whatever loved one wants to keep.)</p>

<p>He was already smart enough to produce film guerilla-style, seeing the problems that plagued the production of the previous feature-length film, but unfortunately not smart enough to also release it guerilla-style: he put it up on his own website and attached his name to it in big letters, and so gave the detractors an easy single point of failure to attack. I guess the next guy to tackle Scientology will be smarter about that as well.</p>

While I don't know much about the issues, I do remember a case in the Netherlands that was pretty big. As far as I can remember, a journalist published certain Scientology documents, after which she and her ISP were raided, and a big lawsuit ensued.<br><br>Read more at <a href="http://www.religionnewsblog.com/13054/final-victory-xs4all-and-karin-spaink-win-scientology-battle" title="religionnewsblog.com">http://www.religionnewsblog.com/13054/final-victory-xs4all-and-karin-spaink-win<nobr>-<wbr></nobr> scientology-battle</a religionnewsblog.com><br>and <a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/user/kspaink/fishman/home.html" title="xs4all.nl">http://www.xs4all.nl/user/kspaink/fishman/home.html</a xs4all.nl><br><br>The relevancy (for me, at least) is that it shows it is possible and legal to publicly write and film about them.
