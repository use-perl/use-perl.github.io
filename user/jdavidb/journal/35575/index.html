<p><p>I've mentioned before my preferred hosting provider is <URL:http://www.nearlyfreespeech.net>, which by your usage, allowing small traffic websites to exist for basically less than a dollar a year.  Now NFS has introduced a plan for higher-usage websites: previously, usage was $1 per Gigabyte of bandwidth used.  This is still true for your first gigabyte.  However, starting <i>immediately</i> upon completion of one gigabyte, the price starts going down logarithmically.  A reloadable page displays in real time your changing bytes-per-penny pricing.</p>

<p>For almost all of my purposes, NFS has been suitable.  I could pay a lot more for certain things, but I haven't found it to be worth it at this point in time.  I'd rather continue to run my websites for the price of rifling through my couch cushions for spare change.</p></p>

<h2>Slashdotted?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/stu42j/">stu42j</a> on 2008-02-04T18:43:11</h3>
Do you ever worry about getting slashdotted (dugg, etc) and ending up with a huge bandwidth bill?

<h2>Re:Slashdotted?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jdavidb/">jdavidb</a> on 2008-02-04T19:37:19</h3>
<p>No.  I worry a little bit about getting slashdotted and <i>hacked</i>.  Or vandalized.  But mainly, I don't worry about getting slashdotted, because I'm not producing anything of that kind of interest.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<p>This whole journal entry was about the fact that becoming a large bandwidth consumer at nearlyfreespeech.net is now less of an issue than ever, because it'll cost less today than it did yesterday.</p>

<p>But for the record, with NFS you have a certain amount of money deposited, and that's it.  If a sudden surge of traffic eats up your deposit, your site shuts down, and you'll have to talk to somebody to reactivate it.  You can never get a huge bandwidth bill, because you'll never get a bill.  You pay ahead of time.</p>

<p>By the way, you'll never believe this, but your question is <a href="https://www.nearlyfreespeech.net/about/faq.php#Slashdot" title="nearlyfreespeech.net">in the FAQ</a nearlyfreespeech.net>.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)  Under "What happens if I get slashdotted?":</p> <p><div class="quote">A "major slashdotting" of a site hosted on our service will cost you (on average) about $10, one time.</div>  <p>There's also <a href="https://www.nearlyfreespeech.net/about/faq.php#Deposit" title="nearlyfreespeech.net">Why do you want money up front?</a nearlyfreespeech.net> and <a href="https://www.nearlyfreespeech.net/about/faq.php#Empty" title="nearlyfreespeech.net">What happens if my account runs completely out of funds?</a nearlyfreespeech.net>.</p>

<p>I imagine that <a href="http://www.bugmenot.com/" title="bugmenot.com">http://www.bugmenot.com/</a bugmenot.com> runs quite a bandwidth bill every month, but they are still a prominent NFS.net customer.  NFS is not a trap to make money by tricking people into paying a lot more than they expected.</p>

I have used NFS for a couple of sites that I get paid to maintain. They have always been great and have installed or updated any modules I have asked them for. I wish they did FastCGI though or maybe they do and I haven't looked.

<p>I <i>think</i> they do FastCGI, but I know zilch about it so I'm not sure.  I know they don't do mod_perl.</p>

From what I can tell you have to fork out some money at hosting providers to do mod_perl.<br><br>From the site:<br><br>FastCGI / SCGI (this is not applicable in our hosting environment, thus we do not offer it and programs written specifically to depend on its API will not work)<br><br>

<h2>Re:NFS</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jdavidb/">jdavidb</a> on 2008-02-06T20:44:09</h3>
<p>Does FastCGI basically start up a daemon process or something that keeps running in the background for new requests?  Because I know they specifically don't allow server processes, daemon processes, or even just long-running processes, so that might be the issue.</p>
