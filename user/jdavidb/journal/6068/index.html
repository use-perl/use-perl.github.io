<p><p>Damian.  Imminent warping of my brain.
<p>Kevin says last time Damian didn't go far enough out with his talk.
<p>Damian is "SO over" in constant time.  He's done with it.  You heard
it here first, folks.
<p>Ain't got time for "in constant time."
<p>New Damian slogan: in zero time.
<p>Programming with the space-time continuum itself, dedicated to Jon
Orwant, who gave Damian a thought two years ago that has gestated into
this.  Thanks a heap, Jon.
<p>4-dimensional representation of Jon Orwant.
<p>Relativity for hobbits.
<p>Relativity: the theory that beat Bohr and Newton.
<p>Everything is relative except the speed of light.
<p>Why Make C Absolute?
<p>4D graph of your position as a hyper cone in the future provided you
do not move faster than the speed of light.  On a t-shirt.
<p>Time-like interval.  Light-like interval.  Those of us made out of
photons, like Damian.
<p>Space-like interval.  Portion of spacetime not covered by the
hypercone.
<p>C is just a conversion factor converting time and space, which are
interchangeable or something.
<p>Time is sensibly measured in seconds.  Distance is measured in made
up units.
<p>Damian with a French accent.
<p>If distance were measured in light-seconds, c would be 1, and e^pi*i
= -1 would equal -c.  More universal constants related!
<p>When you move up you chop off another hypercone, narrowing your
possiblities.
<p>If Jon Orwant threw a coffee mug at the person on the train...
<p>Light isn't like a coffee mug.
<p>The universe conspires to make this so -- Lorentz.  The universe
cheats: it's a Perl programmer.  Shrinks your space in the direction
you travel, and stretches time in the same direction.
<p>The Great Perl Conspiracy.  MJD was restrained.
<p>Good use of all the nice pictures you've seen of folks selling olive
oil^W^WPerl.
<p>Perl eugenics.
<p>Darth Wall.  Took me awhile, for some reason.
<p>Lorentz contraction can be interpreted as viewing something on two
sets of axes.
<p>Damian just proved the possibility of time travel.
<p>Derivation of E = mc^2.
<p>Turning a merry go round very fast changes the measurements.  Pi is
not constant.  But measuring radius is perpendicular to direction of
motion, so it is not contracted.
<p>Pi is 4 at 600 million rps.
<p>Area inside gets bigger.  Space became less dense.
<p>Damian Conway is probably the hacker pun master.
<p>An easy way to do that for sufficiently hard values of easy.
<p>Time::Like::Loops
<ul><li>while spacetime sloop
<li>while st loop
<li>whilst loop</ul>
<p>-t "time-like" suffixes for other loops.
<ul><li>fort
<li>untilt</ul>
<ul>
<li>not
<li>dot
<li>diet
<li>post
<li>cost
<li>joint
<li>pipet
<li>closet</ul>
<p>National Equirer operators
<ul><li>seekdirt
<li>mkdirt
<li>telldirt
<li>readdirt</ul>
<p><code>$var --> 0  # decrement and check against 0<br>
<p>            # while $var goes to 0 :)</code>
<p>Something really magical going on here or something.  Hmmm.
<p>Time like loops are faster than C by definition.  I'm embarrassed;
someone explain this pun to me, please.  Update: 30 minutes later, I
finally get the pun!  Yea, me!!
<p>Perl Wars I A New Computation
<p>Perl Wars II The Einstein Strikes Back
<p>Perl Wars III Return of the Aussi  quantum physics and general
relativity unified
<p>Rats.  The conference is over.
