<p><p>My brother told me I was crazy when I bought a package of 12 or so post-it note pads earlier this year.  I'd never use them all.  I didn't need anywhere near that many.  Slowly, I've scattered these things around the house and now there's <b>always</b> one near when I need it.  And believe me, with my scattered brain, I always need to make a list of something to remember.</p>

<p>Now I've hit on another idea.  I'd been thinking of getting a bulletin board, but today I realized that if I just stick all my post-it notes <i>on the door</i> I will see them as I leave, and can even grab the appropriate note or notes for whatever excursion I'm making.  This is great; two notes so far, going on two hundred I'm sure.</p>

<p>This beats PDAs all to pieces.  If I had a PDA I'd spend all my time looking for it.  There's literally a post-it pad nearby almost everywhere in the house.  I scoff at your high tech solutions! :)</p></p>

<h2>PDA/PIMs are complementary to the Post-Its</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jordan/">jordan</a> on 2002-10-12T16:56:47</h3>
I use the heck out of Post-Its and I agree they are very useful.<br> <p>However, every few days, I go through the clutter around my work spots, looking for the gems that don't really add any value to being posted anymore.  Phone numbers, appointments way in the future, tasks that I need to do, all get committed to my PDA (various passwords get committed to an app on my PDA, phone numbers go into my PDA, etc.) or my Reminder System I use on my laptop (currently Outlook, but I'm looking for something better).<br> </p><p>Eventually, the Post-It Knowledge-base falls over.  You get to a point where you can't find anything anymore and some fly off and get thrown away.<br> </p><p>The high tech solution is not as good for the quick note, but the low tech solution also has it's limitatations.</p>

<p>This is more for to-do lists, etc.  I, too, have had the problem with scattered bits of info on post-it notes, but usually I go through some similar process of assembling them and discarding them after determining that the information is either committed to memory or a file somewhere.</p>
