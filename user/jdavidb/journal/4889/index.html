<p><p>I am now in possession of five tickets to Episode II at 12:01 A.M.  It's hard to contain the excitement; anything I type here is going to come off as understatement.  I often remark how I've been waiting for the prequel trilogy since February 14, 1985, the night when I first noticed Star Wars began "Episode IV."  When The Phantom Menace came out, I remember the incredible feeling that came across me as the intro crawl finished and we caught our first sight of Obi Wan and Qui Gon's ship; it was like being personally present at important events in history.</p>

<p>My brother's coming over in an hour or so, and we're going to watch The Phantom Menace.  Anyone remember when Jason of Fox Trot and his friend Marcus showed their "undying devotion" while the special edition trilogy was out by watching it back-to-back-to-back?  ("Wow! That's six hours!" says his brother Peter.  "Six!" exclaims Jason.  "No!  We're going to watch the entire trilogy <b>back-to-back-to-back</b>.  That's <b>eighteen</b> hours!")  That's me.</p>

<p>By the way, I have a cron job at work that runs every day to give us an approximate countdown to Episode III. :)</p></p>
