<div class="span8">
<p><p>Abigail's talk started off with a basic introduction to objects in
the abstract.
<p>Objects need:
<ul>
<li>set of attributes
<li>set of methods
<li>set of inherited classes
<li>means of method dispatch
</ul>
<p>If methods are closures, the methods contain the attributes for us:
instant encapsulation.  The attributes would also be lexical instead
of hash keys.  Typos would be caught by strict.
<p>There was a really neat code example of using OO::Closures.
<p>This is the second talk I've seen where we've seen how to build an
OO programming system in Perl.  There's actually lots of ways to do
this.  Perl is the first OO language I ever learned.  Really.  I have
a lot of preconceptions about how things should work that give me
problems in other languages, and some of these preconceptions probably
give me problems in Perl, as well.
<p>There were no uses of bless here, I believe.  You know, some day I'd
like to see people come up with a solution for bless besides OO; we've
already seen many interesting ways of doing OO without it.
<p>Problems with using hashes:
<ul>
<li>no strictness
<li>no encapsulation
<li>lots of punctuation
</ul>
<p>An inheriting class can blow out a parent class's attribute.  And of
course, those attributes are internal so they are not documented.
<p>Inheritance in Perl is HARD.  In order to subclass, you actually
ought to look at the code for the superclass and see how it is
implemented.  That's not what you're supposed to do in OO.
<p>Inside out objects: the person next to me just tilted his head 90
degrees counter clockwise to look at Abigail's slide.  I don't think
he noticed it.  I wonder if it helped.
<p>You can get compile time error messages for nonexistent attributes
with this system.
<p>Class::MethodMaker, according to Schwern, isn't possible with
strictness.  However, source filters answer the problem, according to
Abigail.  There's a Class::MethodMaker::InsideOut on the way.
