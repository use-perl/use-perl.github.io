<p><p><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/race/story/0,11374,1264179,00.html">This article</a> mentions that the UK became a multicultural society more than 40 years ago.  What, exactly, was the defining event that caused this?  A legislative action?  An announcement of census results?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance.</p></p>

<h2>40 Years</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/davorg/">davorg</a> on 2004-07-19T16:16:25</h3>
To be honest I have no idea. I thought that most people measured the beginning of the UK as a multicultural society from the arrival of the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/arts/books/windrush/windrush.shtml" title="bbc.co.uk">Windrush</a bbc.co.uk> in 1948.



<h2>I also have no idea</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/grantm/">grantm</a> on 2004-07-19T22:28:11</h3>
but you might find <a href="http://www.movinghere.org.uk/" title="movinghere.org.uk">this site</a movinghere.org.uk> relevant.



<h2>Around 1980 or so.</h2>

<p>Thank God I never had to really deal with racism (I was 13 when we left England in 1984) but it was a constant topic amongst my friends and relatives.  While there may have been noises in the direction of multiculturalism from the 60s onwards, the Guardian has a notoriously leftist outlook so I think its just a case of rose-coloured glasses.  The UK didn't actually become livable for Asians at least until Thatcher came to power.  She made a point of visiting temples, mosques etc. symbolic gestures maybe but it impressed the hell out of us.  It was from then that young people started feeling that they actually belonged to English society.  Though IMO there is still a lot more alienation than amongst Indian-Americans.  (Witness the number of British Muslims who support Al-quaeda.)</p>
