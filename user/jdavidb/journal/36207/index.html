<div class="span8">
<p><p>Based on <a href="http://tsunanet.blogspot.com/2007/07/git-cvs-in-5min.html">this</a> and <a href="http://issaris.blogspot.com/2005/11/cvs-to-git-and-back.html">this</a>, I worked out a complicated process to use git and integrate with our team's CVS repository.  I could use gitk to browse the entire CVS history; when I was ready to push to CVS every intermediary change I had made in git would go into CVS (albeit with inaccurate timestamps).</p>

<p>And it promptly broke.  I had a catastrophic failure with cvsexportcommit (well, it probably wouldn't have been catastrophic if I'd been more experienced and had a bare clue what to do next), and at the same time I broke the build of our software (this wasn't git's fault) and spent way too long trying to figure out how far back to revert.</p>

<p>Way, way too complicated, too fragile, and too hard to even explain what I was doing.</p>

<p>Then while reading <a href="http://benlynn.blogspot.com/2007_08_01_archive.html">this blog entry</a>, specifically the section on just using git to save state in a directory, I had a brainstorm and worked out a new, simpler procedure.  Interestingly enough, it's not too much different from how I was trying to make SVK work with CVS.  Except for the fact that it works. :)</p>

<p>The new method does not turn every single git commit into a CVS commit, but that's probably okay since:</p>

<ol><li>People probably didn't want to see that many commits from me</li>
<li>The timestamps on the commits were wrong and deceptive, anyway.</li>
<li>It scared me to death to push 20 commits and worry that everything was going to fail on commit 16.  Which it did, once.</li></ol>

<p>The new method also doesn't turn every CVS commit into a commit in my local git repository.  Oh, well; I probably didn't need that, anyway, although it was super cool.  Instead, I just get daily (or so) CVS snapshots on the branch that tracks CVS.  Which is not bad, at all.  Maybe by the time I need something more (if I ever do) the tools will be less fragile, or we'll be using something better than CVS here.</p>

<p>Here's the method I worked out:</p>

<ul><li>Make myself a fresh CVS checkout:
<pre>$ cvs -d $CVSROOT checkout -d /path/to/wc $module
$ cd /path/to/wc
$ cvs update -AdP  # prune the numerous useless empty directories</pre></li>

<li>Turn this checkout into a git repository:
<pre>$ git init
$ echo CVS > .gitignore  # Ignore all CVS subdirectories
$ git add .
$ git commit -m'Initial import'</pre></li>

<li>Teach git to ignore build artifacts:
<pre>$ ant [build...]
$ git status | grep '^#   ' | awk '{print $2}' | sed 's/\/$//' >> .gitignore
$ git add .gitignore
$ git commit -m'Ignore build artifacts</pre></li></ul>

<p>From there I made a branch named local with local changes that I want to work with but which the team will probably never want (hence, changes which will never be committed to CVS).  I do work on branches off of the local branch; when I'm ready to commit I use git-rebase to pluck those branches off of local and rebase them onto master; i.e., subtracting my local changes.  Then I commit from there and delete the branch.  Meanwhile, whenever I want to update from CVS (including after committing my own changes) I checkout the master branch and perform the update, and use git merge to pull changes down into local and then again into work branches as needed (and if desired).</p>

<p>Seems to be working great so far.  I've got two separate small work projects going right now on separate branches and the changes don't conflict with each other a bit, and I'm a lot happier and more willing to try things like this than I was a few weeks ago.</p></p>
