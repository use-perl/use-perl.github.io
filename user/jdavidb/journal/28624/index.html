<p>"...Joel Hunter, pastor of a megachurch in Longwood, Fla., says: 'As Christians, our faith in Jesus Christ compels us to love our neighbors and to be stewards of God's creation. The good news is that with God's help, we can stop global warming, for our kids, our world and for the Lord.'"</p>

<p>Personally, I think some people are a little out of touch with reality when they say, "federal legislation that would require reductions in carbon dioxide emissions through 'cost-effective, market-based mechanisms'."  By definition, if government mandates it, it's not market based, and it's probably not cost-effective.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I thought those of you who think of religious people as reactionaries with their heads in the sand who hate science might be interested in this.</p></p>

<p>
Sorry, but your definitions are off.  Paying taxes is a government mandate, and there's a cost-effective, market-based industry to help us do it.  Nothing is compelling you to spend a weekend with a shoebox full of little slips of paper constantly adding and subtracting the same numbers over and over.
</p>
<p>
Similarly, emissions caps tied to markets for trading emissions credits is both market based and cost effective.  You don't <i>need</i> to retrofit your coal fired powerplant.  But it's in your best interest to do it once the cost to buy the emissions credits is more than the cost to upgrade your facility.  A government mandate that's not tied markets and not cost effective would be something like desegregation or the Apollo program.

Wow.  I don't think I've ever seen so many people painted with such a broad brush.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)

Actually, it's more a sign that W has what he wants (8 years in office, war in Iraq), and burning all of his bridges, since he won't need them anymore.

<em>Similarly, emissions caps tied to markets for trading emissions credits is both market based and cost effective.</em><br><br>It's debatable how cost-effective it is in practice.  But yes, it is market-based, however, obviously not wholly so.  A wholly market-based solution would be for there to be no laws specific to it, and let the market decide it all, with no government pressure.<br><br>But few people think that when you significantly affect other people through your actions, there should <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/helipilot/.Pictures/vistasaereas/CornerHouse.jpg" title="mac.com">always be no government regulation.</a mac.com><br><br><em>Actually, it's more a sign that W has what he wants (8 years in office, war in Iraq), and burning all of his bridges, since he won't need them anymore.</em><br><br>Hm?  Bush has favored cap-and-trade since the 2000 campaign, and has worked to implement cap-and-trade programs several times (including the 2002 Clear Skies Initiative).<br>
