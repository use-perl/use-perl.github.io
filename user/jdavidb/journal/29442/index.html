<p><p>Would you please, please, <i>please</i>, <b>PLEASE</b> quit trying to tell me what the problem is?  Just tell me what's wrong; what's not working for you; what symptoms you're seeing.  Use the <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/jdavidb/journal/12638">bug report formula</a>.  Don't decide what is causing the problem and then tell me that, because you're almost certainly wrong about what the problem is.  (And a great many other things too, it would seem.)</p>

<h2>More on XY</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/dagolden/">dagolden</a> on 2006-04-25T22:36:19</h3>
<p>There was a good riff on the XY problem on Perlmonks:  <a href="http://perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=542341" title="perlmonks.org">XY Problem</a perlmonks.org>.</p>

<p>Also, for those inclined to tell you what the problem is, perhaps you should encourage them to <a href="http://perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=500115" title="perlmonks.org">write it as a test file</a perlmonks.org>.  At least that way you get something useful to work with.</p>

<p>I didn't even realize "the XY problem" had become a standard term for it.  (Or that there was a better source about it to point to, within the Perl community rather than without.  But knowing how things are, I should not be surprised.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) )</p>

<p>I'd love to see test-driven bug reporting.  Unfortunately that doesn't work in this case for a number of reasons.  The primary reason in this case is that the problem is not with my code, but with theirs.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)  Other problems are that this is SQL, and that the users are effectively non-technical.  For me, the bug report formula I linked to earlier is enough for me to get a test, or to discern when the issue is user error.  As long as I can coerce people into actually providing all three pieces of information.</p>

<p>In this case, what I got was the answer to #1: "What did you do?"  I'm going to have to work out the answers on my own to #2: "What results did you get?" and #3: "What results were you supposed to get?"</p>
