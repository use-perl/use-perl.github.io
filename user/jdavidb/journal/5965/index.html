<p><p>Some of these entries get kind of stream-of-consciousness.</p>

<p><p>I just realized I numbered YAPC days like A.D./B.C.  No zero.  Maybe
this should be zero.  Oh well.  I guess we'll keep it all in the name
of "backward" compatibility.
<p>I managed to sit down right in front of Jesse, who's doing the RT
talk.  Looking forward to that in a little while, but for now I'm
watching Larry Wall set up for his presentation.
<p>Everyone's sitting here in the same room, talking on IRC.
<p>Everyone's also using Apples.  At least, a whole lot of people are.
Jesse says he bought his to run UNIX on.  I wonder how many other
people here are recent converts, and how few Apples there were last
year.
<p>I just heard a baby crying in the back.  I looked back, and thought
I caught sight of pudge.  See you in a few minutes with those Tick
comic books, pudge.
<p>Larry's talk began with a picture of Bilbo Baggins giving his
birthday speech, and a comment that it wasn't always easy being
Larry.  This made me worry he was going to put his hand in his pocket,
say goodbye, and disappear.
<p>Then he went on to give a mild indictment of hero worship.  You
know, people who do what I did last night.  Strangely, I didn't feel quite as sheepish as I should have.  There was probably a lot of that
yesterday and today.
<p>Then we lost the projector and Larry stood around looking sheepish.
Now we're sitting in a dark room with keys clicking on a hundred
glowing laptops.
<p>Larry's talk highlighted J.R.R. Tolkien as a hero.  Among other
things, he credited the Lord of the Rings with changing his college
career, which eventually led to Perl.
<p>Applicability: freedom of the reader
<p>Allegory: dominance of the author
<p>Hobbits are newbies when it comes to adventures.
<p>Hacker puns were in full form.  In fact, it'd be hard to classify
Larry's talk as allegory, application, or just one big pun.  Is there
a difference between allegory and pun, I wonder?
