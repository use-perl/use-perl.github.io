<h1>Suggestions for merlyn's mirror CPAN program</h1>
<h2><a href="/user/jdavidb/">jdavidb</a> on 2002-10-16T16:27:32</h2>
</div> <!-- /span4 -->


<div class="span8">
<p><p>I've been running my CPAN.pm shell sessions with a file:// URL for awhile now, thanks to merlyn's recent CPAN mirror program (which pulls the bare minimum to create a usable CPAN repository: only the most recent modules).  I noticed today though that CPAN.pm is still going to my previous first choice repository to download and compare checksums.</p>

<p>So, I added the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Declare an %authors hash just before the while gzreadline loop</li>
<li>After calling my_mirror on the module distribution file, get just the directory name with dirname, and add it to the hash as a key</li>
<li>For each key in the hash, call mirror (not my_mirror) on "authors/id/$key/CHECKSUM"</li>
</ul>

<p>Here's the actual patch, but you might prefer just the description:</p>

+  # contents but not names
 }
 
 ## finally, clean the files we didn't stick there
</pre>

<p>This is being tested even as I speak.  It may not work for you.  It may not work for me.  It may only work the first time I run it. :)</p>

<p><b>update</b>: Actually I screwed up and tested a version that called my_mirror instead of mirror.  Had a misunderstanding in the call semantics of my_mirror that made the version above not work (fixed).  Of course, now you're making connections to check each CHECKSUMS file to see if it changed, which is pretty lame.  Maybe someone can come up with a better idea.</p>

<p>Question: why are the my_mirror and clean_unmirrored subroutines wrapped in a BEGIN block?  I understand why they are in a block, but why does it have to be compiled first?</p></p>

Are you <i>sure</i> you have the <a href="http://www.stonehenge.com/merlyn/LinuxMag/col42.listing.txt" title="stonehenge.com">latest version</a stonehenge.com>?  There's code specifically in there to download the CHECKSUMS file to prevent exactly such an action:<blockquote><div> <tt>&nbsp; &nbsp; if ($path =~ m{^authors/id}) { # maybe fetch CHECKSUMS<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; my $checksum_path =<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; URI-&gt;new_abs("CHECKSUMS", $remote_uri)-&gt;rel($REMOTE);<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; if ($path ne $checksum_path) {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; my_mirror($checksum_path, $checksum_might_be_up_to_date);<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; }<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; }</tt> </div></blockquote>I added this code because I noticed the same behavior you reported when I was offline (at 30,000 feet, actually {grin}). I do recall some preliminary version of minicpan being circulated about... maybe you picked that up from somewhere.

I just noticed that the
<a href="http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=188527" title="perlmonks.org">Perlmonks</a perlmonks.org> version is the buggy preliminary version.  Please use <a href="http://www.stonehenge.com/merlyn/LinuxMag/col42.html" title="stonehenge.com">the final version</a stonehenge.com> instead.

<p>Thank you!  Turns out my solution didn't work, anyway.  It went downloaded all the CHECKSUMS files<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... then deleted them!</p>

Heh!  That's exactly what the very next version did for me.
<p>
At least you were on the right track.  Another 42 minutes or so, and you'd have ended up with my final version.
</p><p>
The key was not running <tt>mirror</tt> needlessly.  I ended up with a multi-stage algorithm, described in the accompanying text.  The result is that I don't try to mirror any CHECKSUMS for which I already have a local version <b>and</b> none of its associated files have been updated either, and that I don't ever mirror the CHECKSUMS more than once in a session.  That keeps the fetches to a minimum.  It's really rather slick in operation.  I can update my mini-cpan over a 28.8 connection from a hotel with just a minute or two of overhead, plus the download times of the actual <tt>tar.gz</tt> files.  (Now if only <a href="/user/brian_d_foy/" title="perl.org">some people</a perl.org> would avoid putting entire MP3s in their test suite... {grin}.)</p>

There isn't anyway to avoid putting an entire MP3 in Mac::iTunes because there's no way to put half of one there.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

It could be a *tiny* MP3 though.  10 seconds of silence or something. {grin}

It could be smaller, but it can't be silence.  Besides not adequately testing things, I don't have permission to use silence. John Cage's lawyers recently settled a case over a one-minute track of silence.

<p>Maybe you can come up with a GPL-ed alternative to silence.</p>
