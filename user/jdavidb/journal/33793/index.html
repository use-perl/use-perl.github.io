<p><p>An old boss who works in my building is getting rid of a lot of his old books, and he just gave me a 1st edition <i>Programming perl</i>!  I'm ecstatic because I've always intended to get one of these from my library because:</p>

<ul>
<li>It's the book I first learned Perl from: sentimental reasons</li>
<li>I got a real kick out of the Job examples in the book.  Who could forget open PRINTER, ">/dev/ctp"; to open the clay tablet printer device?</li>
<li>I remember it as looking like a simple and effective text to learn programming in general from, not just Perl.  My kids may learn from portions of this book some day.</li>
</ul>

<p>Interestingly enough, I seem to recall that when our little group realized we had outgrown Perl 4 (which happened far later than it should have), this same boss, at the time a coworker in a another group, was the man who loaned us our first 2nd edition Camel.</p></p>

Although I had written a shelf-full of books for other companies, that camel was the first time I could pick up a book with <i>my</i> name on the cover.  What joy.
<p>
It was really great to work with Larry on that book... our humor styles were similar enough that when we got to the glossary, and I stubbed in a few dummy terms (Regular Expression:<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/Oh s.*t./) just to keep things moving, Larry and I quickly agreed that we could do some of the terms as a joke, other terms seriously, and a few somewhat ambiguously.
</p><p>
It's hard to believe that this was all done about 17 years ago.  Geez, I'm getting old.
</p><p>
And I certainly couldn't have predicted that having written <i>that</i> book, I was then asked to write a training course, which inspired the Llama book, which (thanks to good timing) became the basis for most of Stonehenge's activities in the late 90s.  What a wild ride it has been.</p>
