<h2>consequences</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/lachoy/">lachoy</a> on 2005-09-07T16:06:36</h3>
I'm ambivalent about that last assertion. I think there's a societal implication that if things get really bad, the police/army/coastguard will have to come in and rescue them. Sure, you can say, "Don't rescue me!" but people (and polling-twitchy politicians) simply won't stand for it. So it's different than all the rest because it implicitly involves someone (a rescue worker) who's not giving consent and who may be endangered by the rescue.



<h2>My answers</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/sigzero/">sigzero</a> on 2005-09-07T18:02:00</h3>
<p>Some of those are cut and dried "yes" answers. Some of them have caveats that need to be added. For instance donating an organ to who ever you want should have a medical rider. Some of them are matters  of interpretation, or conscience, or even morality. All subjective.</p>

<p>You still have to live under the laws of the land.</p>

<p>However, all those lines really start with an unstated "I think". Which is fine and dandy.</p>



<h2>Almost agree, but ...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Ovid/">Ovid</a> on 2005-09-07T18:24:39</h3>
<p>Sure, someone should have a legal right to ride a motorcycle without a helmet but that poses an interesting dilemma.   Some feel that society has a moral obligation to help those who cannot help themselves, such as with medical expenses.  If an indegent mother cannot afford pre-natal care, the argument asserts that by society providing her with such care, we lower long-term costs by ensuring a more healthy baby.</p>

<p>However, what about the motorcycle rider?  Should society bear the costs of his voluntary activity?  I would argue that I shouldn't have to pay for someone else taking risks.  The same goes for skydiving, bungee-jumping, etc.  However, that really becomes a slippery slope.  An indigent mother choosing to have a child and thus further impoverishing herself and the child can certainly, by some, be considered "voluntary risky behavior."  It's a tricky ethical question.</p>

<p>What I think it all comes down to is pretty simple:  there's no "natural" way these issues can be resolved.  People argue all the time about what's right or what's wrong and they ignore the fact that the more complicated something is, the less likely we can pigeonhole the activity.  Thus, we're forced into a series of compromises that no one is quite happy with.  In our current state of affairs, the motorcycle rider who seriously injures himself and sits in a hospital for months without paying is driving everyone's medical bills up.  Do we tell the doctors to just let him die?</p>

<p>Note that I'm pretty much a "it's nobody's damn business what I choose to do" sort of guy, but I do realize that my voluntary activities impact others, so I'm not making an argument one way or another here.  I'm just discussing differing viewpoints.</p>

<p>I recognize and agree with your point that there are occasionally complex issues.  However, I have simple answers to some of the ones you raise.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<p> <i>Some feel that society has a moral obligation to help those who cannot help themselves, such as with medical expenses.</i> </p>

<p>Those who feel that moral obligation should bear the burden of carrying it out, rather than legislating their morality onto anyone else.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<p> <i>In our current state of affairs, the motorcycle rider who seriously injures himself and sits in a hospital for months without paying is driving everyone's medical bills up. Do we tell the doctors to just let him die?</i> </p>

<p>I would think that after what happened to Terri Schiavo, it would be easy to do so.  I'm certainly <b>more</b> in favor of letting a person who left an end of life directive, or a person who engaged in a potentially lethal risk without proper precautions, die than I was to let Terri Schiavo die, who did not do either.</p>

<p> <i>Note that I'm pretty much a "it's nobody's damn business what I choose to do" sort of guy, but I do realize that my voluntary activities impact others</i> </p>

<p>And I'm in favor of restriction the moment a person's behavior impacts others without their consent.  And I realize that occasionally gives us fuzzy lines: should a pregnant mother be forbidden to drink alcohol?  I do not have the answer to that question.</p>

<p> <em>should a pregnant mother be forbidden to drink aclohol?"</em> </p>

<p>No, but that doesn't stop me from talking to her about how bad drinking (and smoking) is to her unborn child.</p>



<h2>proof of insurance</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/gizmo_mathboy/">gizmo_mathboy</a> on 2005-09-08T04:25:17</h3>
I'm fine with people not riding without helmets. I would impose two legal requirements:<br><br>1) proof of health insurance<br>2) be an organ donor<br><br>I would say the same for those that feel the need to not use seat belts.<br><br>Freedom to fuck your life up as much as you want is fine. Imposing a burden on society for your actions needs to be somehow amerliorated.<br><br>If one wants to belong to a group for certain benefits then you need to go along with the group's rules.<br><br>I suppose if a helmetless rider signs a document that he won't be given medical aid in the event of an accident I suppose that's ok, too. Harsh but reckless behaviour needs some limits.<br><br>

<h2>In general yes, bet there's problems with a few...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Alias/">Alias</a> on 2005-09-09T22:53:36</h3>
I don't know about in countries with fully privatised medical systems, but in Australia we have largely public health.<br><br>And some of the assertions fall down under those circumstances.<br><br>For example. As a general rule, you should ride a motorcycle with a helmet. REALLY REALLY bad things happen to heads in motorcycle accidents.<br><br>The government owns those roads you want to ride on. And they are going to have to pay if you hurt yourself. So the deal they do is that if you want to ride a motorcycle on their roads, you have to wear a helmet so you won't cost them hundreds of thousands (or millions in worst cases) of dollars if you fall off it. The injuries from normal motorcycle accidents are much lower, and they are happy to take the risk.<br><br>The same could be said to apply to New Orleans. They've gone to huge expense to get people in their to rescue you from what is an untenable situation. There's no foo, no power, no water, no sewerage, disease on the way, and gators in the streets. You really are completely fucked, you just might not know it yet.<br><br>You might say you don't want to go, but 2 days later when you are desperate and sick and shooting at helicopters to try and get their attention, then what are they supposed to do? Rescue you AGAIN? And this time use up a hospital bed you put yourself into? And no, saying "Well he said to absolutely not rescue him" isn't going to cut it.<br><br>Ditch your pride and take photos of everything you leave behaind. Take your kids and your memories and get the hell out. You paid the insurance company for a reason.<br>
