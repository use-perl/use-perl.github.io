<div class="span8">
<p><p>The call depth of Java exception stack traces never ceases to amaze me.  These are easily 200 levels deep.  I know I'm seeing things that trace back deep into the bowels of our application server, but I also remember working with much simpler Java programs in school that were still 50 levels deep or so.</p>

<p>I don't think anything I wrote in Perl ever had that many routines calling that many routines.  Even if they had a comparable number of routines, they didn't go that <i>deep</i>.</p></p>

<h2>proxies are part of the problem</h2>

A lot of systems today use one or more proxies around a number of objects to implement declarative transactions or other goodies. (Of course, these are much easier to implement in Perl or other dynamic languages, but that's another show.) So as a result you'll frequently have a number steps where each proxy intercepts the method, figures out what to dispatch it to, then invoke the relevant method using reflection.<br><br>Fun when debugging, too...

<p>Yes; I'm seeing a <i>lot</i> of those.</p>

<p>There needs to be the equivalent of goto &amp;NAME in Java.</p>

Yeah, I'm starting to boggle at the Java-length stacks I'm seeing from my code that uses both Moose and POE.  Pages and pages long.

That's 'cause stevan loves longmess apparently.<br><br>As for Java, the call traces are deep because you see the call stack all the way down to "main".  Try going 50 levels deep in a mod_perl app, then looking at the C stack in GDB.  It's deep because you have Apache in there, then Perl, then Perl's management of your stack.

<p>Be nice if he gave the user the choice. There&#8217;s always Carp::Always for those times you do need a full trace, and then you get one from <em>any</em> uncaught exceptions, not just those where the author co&#246;perated. And the rest of the time, you can leave it out.</p>
