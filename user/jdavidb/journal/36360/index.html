<p><p>I'm interacting with a .NET (I think) webservice, and I have to create a URL-encoded POST request.  Conceptually, no biggie: I've used CGI.pm for years and understand the concept well.  (Better than ASP.NET webservices, apparently, as I am aware that semicolon is a valid substitute for ? as a variable separator and ASP.NET webservices are not.)  But of course I'm doing this from Java, so there's the extra work of looking up the right library^Wseventeen libraries to use.</p>

<p>Except that the libraries don't seem to fully cover this.  Thankfully there's a URLEncoder class, or might just crawl away and die, but there's nothing to create the whole POST request for me from a HashMap or something.  I have to generate all the headers myself, including the content-length, and I have to encode each parameter individually and glue them all together myself with = and ;.  I mean = and &.</p>

<p>Annoying.  So I guess I'll subclass HashMap myself and do it that way.  Fun little exercise, I suppose, but this should be there for me.</p></p>

Don't use a subclass of HashMap.  Write a class that implements Map, and keep a HashMap internally.  That'll be much more flexible.

<p>It's a little late.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<p>But really, I don't see how I'm more flexible for implementing Map than simply subclassing HashMap.  That just seems like a lot of trouble writing delegates methods that would otherwise just be there if I subclass.  It's probably because Perl is the screwdriver with which I attempt to hammer every nail, and the Perl version of hashes as one of the three fundamental data structures is indelibly marked on my mind.</p>

<p>I suppose it makes things easier if ever I want to use some other structure to store the data, but I can't imagine anything better than a hash for storing data.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)  This is most likely a limitation on my perspective, but I don't see it.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>
