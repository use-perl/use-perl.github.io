<h2>HTTP Sucks</h2>

While I agree that requiring JavaScript enabled is annoying, how many online stores actually work if cookies are turned off?<br><br>HTTP is stateless. Under any shopping cart type scenario, you need to be able to persist the list of products the customer wants to buy. The alternatives to cookies are rewriting every link on every page to include a state identifier, which has its own wonderful problems associated with it.<br><br>May I ask what the context was in which it was onerous to use same-domain session-only cookies? I'm having trouble thinking of any, but it looks like you encountered one.

The conventional way to handle this is to to put session keys into the URI instead of the cookie.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/shop/1b28dcb81028be012b8dc01/item/12345

<p>Yeah, HTTP is garbage. Luckily, we have stateful protocols like FTP that scale so much better.<nobr> <wbr></nobr><tt>:)</tt> </p>

Or you could use POST and hidden session variables.    It seems kinda dodgy to me to be using GET in the first place if your state is going to be changing.  Doesn't sound very RESTful.
<br>
<a href="https://www.eusecwest.com/register" title="eusecwest.com">EuSecWest</a eusecwest.com> is an example of a cart that doesn't require either cookies or javascript.  Mostly because we sell to a very security conscious/paranoid audience who don't necessarily have either javascript or cookies turned on, and may restrict both by organizational fiat.

<p>I'm not saying stores should be able to function without cookies.  I'm saying that I don't want to have to turn them on for your site until I decide if your site has anything worth selling, and if your site can't even <i>display</i> the goods to me without having to track the fact, you need to get over the ego that made you think this was important and just show me what you're selling.</p>
