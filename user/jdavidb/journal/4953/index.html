<p><p>The biggest problem with this movie is that there's no podrace for me to use for the same purpose I used the Episode I podrace for during viewings numbers 2, 3, 4, and 5. :)</p>

<p>The movie brings back all the Star Wars action we remember from times past, with a lot of other things we've never guessed at.  I don't think any of the complaints about Episode I can be applied to Episode II.  While I would not rank it a perfect movie, I can't imagine any Star Wars fan not liking it.  I've heard it said several times that this movie is better than The Empire Strikes Back.  While I currently wouldn't rank it there (my rankings are subject to change), I couldn't argue with someone who put it that high.</p>

<p>Of course, Star Wars is melodramatic.  If you don't like that, you might criticize AOTC for it.</p>

<p>There are a lot of interesting similarities to Empire in this movie.  I'll have to go see it again because similarities at the end were so interesting I forgot about many of the ones at the beginning.</p>

<p>I wish all you people who complained about Jar-Jar had just shut up.</p>

<p>I wound up watching this movie from the front row because arriving 30 minutes ahead of time was not early enough to find five seats together.  It was a little disorienting, and I'm looking forward to seeing the movie from a better view.  In particular, some of the lightsaber action was too bright and too quick to follow from the bottom of the screen.</p>

<p>At any rate, there's only about 1096 days until Episode III.  I'm looking forward to it!</p>

<p><b>update:</b> One last thing I forgot to mention in my delerium last night.  Fans of the expanded universe novels will be surprised at the significant amount of material that is <b>contradicted</b> by this movie.  You can throw a lot of those books out the window.</p></p>
