<div class="span8">
<p><p>Two weeks ago Sarah and I were sick.  Jokingly, Sarah's mother asked her on the phone if she was pregnant.  "Of course not," Sarah said, "We're both sick."</p>

<p>But then, as I got better, Sarah continued to be <a href="http://www.wsu.edu:8080/user/brians/errors/nauseated.html">nauseated</a>.  She started to get suspicious, and I came home last Thursday to a positive pregnancy test.</p>

<p>I don't think either of us were completely willing to believe it till we had a doctor check her out Thursday.  There is, in fact, an eight week old baby in there, and the doctor proved it by showing us <a href="http://www.churchofchristdiscussions.com/babyblackstone.jpg">the picture</a>!  18 mm long, and the little heart was visibly beating in the middle.  I have truly never seen anything like that; the feelings of fatherhood were not something I could have understood before.</p>

<p>I've always loved and wanted children.  My transformation to homeschooler over the past two years (since meeting Sarah, my wife who was completely homeschooled and never attended a public or private school in her life until she got to college) has only increased my enthusiasm.  I can't wait to teach this little one to read, to do math, to read and sing music, to program, and all the other things I want our children to learn.  I can't wait to take trips together in the off-season and see all the places I could only see in summer as a child.  I can't wait to watch my child grow in political awareness and form his or her own opinions about government and defend those to his friends.  I can't wait to see my child learning about our faith and the beliefs of others.</p>

<p>So, what do you guys think?  Should my child start out on Perl, or scheme? ;)</p></p>

<i>Should my child start out on Perl, or scheme?</i> <p>
You should start out with perl for teaching purposes; the child will have developed the ability to scheme long before.</p>

<p>Thanks; you're right!  As evidenced by hiding from us for eight weeks!</p>

How cool is that.. teaching Perl, of course, goes without saying.



<h2>I'd suggest VB</h2>

Leave better programming languages until after toilet training.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)<br> <br>Congratulations and good luck.

FWIW, I lean towards unschooling, which is -- when followed strictly -- entirely child-led learning.  You only help them learn what they are interested in, as a part of just growing and living.  I don't subscribe to it strictly, but I will only teach programming if my children are interested in it, and even then will let them choose the language as much as I can.<br>
