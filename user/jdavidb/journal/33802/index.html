Think of it like "retarded" in the US -- it's used as a generic insult, but also describes a particular set of people (those with mental disabilities).  Whereas "bloody hell," "son of a bitch," and "shithead" don't denigrate any particular people.

<p><div class="quote">Think of it like "retarded" in the US</div>  <p>Yeah, I sort of realized it must be an insult like that.  But honestly prior to last night I didn't notice the word "spastic" had a prior meaning referring to people with a particular disability.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)  That's just not how it's used over here.</p>

<p>Of course, we also insult each other with "retarded" a lot.  And I guess the same could be said for most of our insults that denigrate intelligence: "idiot," for example.</p>

It's pretty offensive in the UK because Spastic refers to 'spacticity' i.e. uncontrolled, feeble movements and associated problems or serious illnesses like cerebral palsy.<br><br>read the wikipedia page (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spastic) for more info - quite why americans don't consider using serious medical conditions as insults offensive I don't know - particularly when the the nation/media get's so worked up over perfectly natural stuff like nipples, sexual organs or fairly tame sex acts.

<p><div class="quote">quite why americans don't consider using serious medical conditions as insults offensive I don't know</div>  <p>Perhaps because Americans have never heard of the serious medical condition known as "spacticity"?  I'm 29 years old and never had a clue until Friday that the word "spastic" had something to do with a disability.  And I thought that was pretty clear from my post.</p>

<p>Do you use the word "idiot" in your vocabulary?  Are you aware of its etymology?</p>

<p>Americans do not, in fact, refer to people as "palsied" or anything like that.</p> <p><div class="quote">particularly when the the nation/media get's so worked up over perfectly natural stuff like nipples, sexual organs or fairly tame sex acts.</div>  <p>Ah; yes, all our problems come from our sexual repression.</p>

But if is "retaahded" in a Saturday Night Live skit, then it's okay.<br>



<h2>BEP</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/bart/">bart</a> on 2007-07-15T12:05:43</h3>
You know the hit song "Let's Get It Started" by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Eyed_Peas#Elephunk" title="wikipedia.org">Black Eyed Peas</a wikipedia.org>? It is recorded as "Let's Get Retarded" on the album.<br><br>Apparently, somebody thought that line was too offensive, indeed.
