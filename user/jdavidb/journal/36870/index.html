<p><p>Today I'm removing evolution from my Fedora 8 system, because it ate my mail this morning, and I'm switching to Thunderbird.</p>

<p>Remember how livid the world was because Microsoft claimed that Internet Explorer was integrated into the OS and could not be removed, even if you were to remove the icon from the desktop?  Well, pot, meet kettle: if I attempt to remove the package evolution-data-server from my system, it attempts to take along with it a whopping 32 other packages, including pidgin (the IM client formerly known as gaim) and gnome itself in the form of crucial pieces of gnome such as gnome-panel and gnome-applets.</p>

<p>Gnome and evolution should immediately be sued and brought to justice for their evil monopolistic practices.</p></p>

<p>I tried to delete Evolution and switch to T'bird under Debian. It was not a clean process, so I gave up and went back to Evolution. At least it hasn't eaten any of my email, but it does have bugs.</p><p>Eg The last upgrade means when you select a set of emails and try to delete all, it deletes all but the last, which is strikes-thru, and then ignores. So you have to undelete it and then delete it<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-(.</p><p>Apart from that, it's fine. So I worry about other things.</p><p>But you're right, it should not be tied into anything, a la MS. That's a bad thing to do.</p>

And in this case, I did remove the main Evolution app, so whatever's left is some kind of component.</p><p>But it looks bad, and hypocritical, and mainly I thought it was funny!<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<h2>not evolution's fault</h2>

Not that I like or use Evolution, but:
GNOME is not the operating system; you can use KDE, for example. pidgin is not the operating system; you can use another instant messenger. And it's not even Evolution's fault; it's whoever decided that those other packages depend on Evolution.
