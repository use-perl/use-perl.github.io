<h2>Straight Edge is Vegan?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/gizmo_mathboy/">gizmo_mathboy</a> on 2003-09-04T03:44:37</h3>
I have two questions:<br> <br>1) I didn't realize Straight Edgers had to be vegan.<br>2) Why would a school ban either Straight Edge or Vegan?<br> <br>Weird in all sorts of ways.

<p>I never heard of straight edge.  Apparently, in context, it was almost a gang-like organization.  (Which doesn't sound vegan to me, but what do I know?)  They banned the word because it was associated with straight edge, and thus seemed to imply a risk of violence.  I'd bet the administrators didn't even know what the word meant.</p>

<p>I'm not vegan, but the ones I've met in person have always been nice.</p>

My understanding of Straight Edge is from my college days, it's more of a life style than a gang. The idea is to live a clean life, no drugs, and such.<br> <br>Here's a decent <a href="http://www.straight-edge.com/definition.html" title="straight-edge.com">description</a straight-edge.com> of Straight Edge:<br> <br>I'm not sure why a school would want to ban such a philosophy. Maybe the way it was being carried out. I still don't get the Vegan angle. Maybe more of an extreme take of being straight.<br> <br>These google <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22straight+edge%22" title="google.com">results</a google.com> seem to be the best about showing the spectrum of what Straight edge is.

It's because the people who run them are stupid.
<p>
As far as I can remember back, that simple mantra has explained everything about every public school I've ever seen.  (And the one private one, as well.)
</p><p>
As far as I can tell, most of the people who work as "educators" are people you wouldn't trust to make an ice cream cone, much less teach other people what the real world is like.  The real world does a remarkably quick job of that despite the efforts of public education.</p>

Many straight-edgers are also vegan, but the original definition of straight-edge, as taken from a song by Minor Threat, does not include veganism.  I think the (potential) ascetism of veganism attracts people who are already attracted to the asceticism of straight-edge.<br> <br>However, as a vegan who is <b>not</b> an ascetic, I don't particularly like the connection between the two.  Straight-edgers are generally not great ambassadors for veganism, as they make it seem quite unappealing.<br> <br>In answer to your second question, that's because in some places, particularly Utah, the straight-edge kids have gotten violent in their "enforcement" of their tenets, attacking people who smoke or drink.<br> <br>Straight-edge in and of itself isn't a bad thing, and I've known a lot of cool straight-edgers, but like many subcultures, there are elements in it that take things too far.  In fact, while I'm not into punk or hardcore music at all, I am basically straight-edge (no drugs or alcohol ever).
