<p><p>Hastily and forcibly upgrading old code to SQLite 3.  The old compiled sqlite 2 executable no longer even works; I have no idea how many upgrades have been performed on this machine.</p>

<p>And I can't install sqlite 3.  I'm having to install in my home directory ... and it doesn't work because, despite the fact that I said ./configure --prefix=$HOME, it's trying to install a bunch of TCL crap in /usr/share/tcl.  Um, if I actually did want that installed, and on the even more unlikely chance that I don't want it put somewhere that corresponds with $PREFIX, I would SURE like to find it in /usr/local/share instead of /usr/share.  But I don't want it.  And I'm in a big enough hurry I think I'll look for the quickest possible way to rip it out.  Ugh.</p>

<p>I said failure due to TCL ... it's really failure due to implementing part of the install process in such a way that it does not respect ./configure's options.  If you're going to do that, there's not that much point to ./configure.</p>

<p><b>Update 2006-05-03T07:21:00 UTC</b>: That was quite easy: ./configure --disable-tcl --prefix=$HOME .  Thanks, SQLite!</p></p>
