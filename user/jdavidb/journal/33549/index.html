Social Security is a broken system. It is a ponzy scheme managed by the government. Yet, nobody is willing to touch it.

<p>Government is a broken system and should be tossed out.  The natural ecology of human civilization that resulted would not be perfect, but would be far healthier.</p>

Sure, not that agree with that on any level, but if you did we would no longer be the United States. We would be something totally different and probably not very good at all.

<p><div class="quote">if you did we would no longer be the United States. We would be something totally different and probably not very good at all.</div>  <p>Why does "not the United States" equate to "not very good at all."?  I have a religious faith, but this belief is not an article in my confession.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<p>I believe an anarcho-capitalist society would be far, far superior to the United States system.</p>

<p>How do you steal from the poor and give to the rich?  The poor don't have any money!  That's why they're poor.</p>

If I read my courses in economy right, stealing the poor to give to the rich is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surplus_value" title="wikipedia.org">very basis of capitalism</a wikipedia.org>. But you need a lot of poors to make one rich.

<p>No, free and voluntary exchange is the basis of capitalism.  Theft is anything but free and voluntary exchange, and therefore is not capitalism.  You're speaking about mercantilism, a situation where government steals money from people (possibly justifying it with a name like "taxation") to give to businesses, and then justify themselves as "capitalist" because they are supporting businesses.</p>

<p>In the case of the situation referenced by the linked article, the poor are that way because their income is stolen somewhere around the employer-employee interface.</p>
