<div class="span8">
<p><p>I mentioned awhile back I was going to start using SVK while our repository at work is CVS.  After a couple of false starts, I've really started to use SVK this week.  It's already helping me, but I'm having some problems from lack of knowledge.</p>

<p>SVK and CVS integration isn't perfect at this point (where "perfect" would be that SVK can mirror a CVS repository the way it can a Subversion repository, and I could use SVK to push to it and pull from it seamlessly), so basically you check out a CVS working copy and then track that CVS copy as it changes in SVK.  This gives some headaches, but actually this alone has helped me in several ways.</p>

<p>I think what I want to do is have a branch that tracks the CVS trunk, and then one or more local branches for development.  I have some local changes I want to have all the time but not commit, and I think I want that to be my trunk and everything else to be a branch off of that.  I want to update my CVS trunk periodically, then pull those changes down to my trunk at times that are sensible for me.  When I want to commit changes I want to push them into the CVS trunk from the downstream branch, and then push them back from there into CVS.</p>

<p>I sort of got this working yesterday, and it was very nice.  I tested several times pulling CVS changes into my CVS trunk, then using smerge to pull them into my working trunk.  Nice.  I was excited.</p>

<p>And then I tried to do some work in my trunk and pull it back into CVS trunk.  Crash!  I ran headlong into a knowledge problem.  I know how to execute "take all of the changes in this branch and pull them into that branch."  But I cannot figure out how to execute "take <i>some</i> of the changes in this branch and pull them into that branch."  So I've got files modified in the working trunk, and I don't want to pull the changes to those files into the CVS trunk, but I don't know how to merge the changes from just some of the files.</p>

<p>I've tried to view the docs on the merge, cmerge, and smerge commands to figure out how to do this.  I suspect it's the merge command, but I just can't get the syntax right even looking at the help.  I've tried looking through the SVK book, but it's very much a work in progress and doesn't seem to be helping me.</p>

<p>If anyone can tell me what command I should be using and how to execute it, that would be great.  I'm not posting the commands I've tried or the error messages because I really think I was barking up the wrong tree and the commands I executed would just confuse knowledgeable SVK users as to what I was actually trying to do.  The commands I typed probably don't even come close to matching the prose description above. :)  But if error messages can help someone who's willing to take the time to help me, I'll post them.</p>

<p>I <b>am</b> willing to listen to "Use git; you won't have to deal with this." :)</p>

<p><b>Update:</b> I just now found out I can use svk push and svk pull to move some stuff between branches, but it still doesn't seem to have a provision for moving the changes to only some files.</p>

<p><b>Update:</b> <a href="http://lists.bestpractical.com/pipermail/svk-users/2007-October/000084.html">Here</a>'s where the question was asked on the svk-users mailing list.  I can't see if it was answered anywhere.  The svk-devel list seems to be the better place for questions, but I don't see it asked there anywhere.  I may ask there myself next week.  Or I may try a git trial.  For now I'm stuck with a single branch into which I pile both my local changes and pull updates from cvs.</p></p>

<p>There are at least three functional ways to get from CVS to git listed on the <a href="http://git.or.cz/gitwiki/InterfacesFrontendsAndTools#head-8870e1c81cc93f9a7a7acb5e969924ee60182d6b" title="git.or.cz">Interfaces, Front-ends And Tools page on the git wiki</a git.or.cz>.

</p><p>If you want to be able to commit back to cvs, you probably want to go the git-cvsimport / git-cvsexportcommit route.</p>

<p>Thanks.  I'll definitely look more into it.</p>

<p>I came into work this morning to discover our CVS server has a kernel panic; one of the only two guys who can fix it didn't arrive till just now, so at the moment I can't really use much of anything.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)  Actually I can continue to commit to my SVK repository; just can't get all the updates that happened after I went home on Friday and over the weekend.</p>

<p>Thanks again.  A little bit of reading, study, and practice, and now I see that git does in fact handle my gripe above quite nicely.  Score 1 for git, 0 for svk, which disappoints me, because to be honest I'm biased in favor of svk.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<p>I love that with git I can take a long time specifically marking what I actually want to commit and that when I commit, unless I make an unconscious habit of using the -a option, I'll just commit the things I marked rather than possibly screwing up and committing everything!  Score 1 for git over cvs, svn, and svk.  Wow.</p>

<p>I think git is going to end up being my final destination.</p>
