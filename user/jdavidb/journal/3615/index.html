<p><p>I'm just really enjoying sitting at my kitchen table with this debian-running ibook and surfing the net.  Now if only I had wireless networking so I could eliminate the long green ethernet cable running from my kitchen table to the DSL modem.  And not have to move the modem from the living room to the kitchen.</p>

<p>Been having to do an inordinate amount of work in matlab for a neural networks class.  I'm fanatic enough to try to avoid working with nonfree software more or less (yes I still have a MacOS machine), so I really enjoyed discovering GNU Octave (which I had run across three times before looking for <a href="http://www.lilypond.org/">a music notation program</a>), which is just about a clone of matlab, except without a lot of the recent graphing and GUI features.  However, my ultimate goal is to start doing this work with PDL.  Because if there's one thing I try to avoid more than nonfree software, it's programming languages other than Perl.</p>

<p>It's weird how you learn something, and then it comes in handy later.  I first heard about PDL in the early days of Perl6, back in those crazy days when I was trying to drink the firehose.  At the time, it made no sense to me at all.  But then when I was introduced to matlab, I immediately recalled PDL and finally understood what it was for.</p>

<p>Give me PDL + Perl/Gtk over matlab any day.</p></p>
