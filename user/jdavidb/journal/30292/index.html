<p><p>I'm desperately trying to tell Configure not to insert -I/usr/local/include into ccflags.  There is complete junk in that directory, and I've gone to great lengths to get a gcc compiled that doesn't even look there (unless told to, sigh).</p>

<p>Unfortunately it looks like the only way to do this is to run Configure interactively until I get to that option, and type none.  Passing -Dccflags=none doesn't work at all, nor does passing a real value for ccflags, because Configure tacks -I/usr/local/include onto ccflags anyway and goes on its merry way.</p></p>

    sh Configure -Ulocincpth=<br>should do what you want.  (You may also wish to add<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -Uloclibpth=<br>if<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/usr/local/lib also has junk you don't want.)<br><br>(Incidentally -- posting to perl5-porters@perl.org with build questions is far more likely to get a timely response.  I don't usually read use.perl.org.  I only saw this because Jarkko spotted it and sent me a note.)

<p>Thank you.  Unfortunately now I've discovered that gcc chooses to search<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/usr/local/include anyway.  Lovely, huh?</p>

&gt; gcc chooses to search<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/usr/local/include anyway<br><br>Gah.  At this point one is supposed to challenge the gcc developers to a game of bat-leh.  Or binary patch gcc.  Or possibly its spec file, or where it is pulling that silly idea from.<br>

<p>lol.  I worked and worked to try to figure out where gcc was getting that from.  I could not find a single file used by gcc that included<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/usr/local/include!</p>

<p>Finally I took this route: I found out what option to pass to gcc at configuration to tell it to not look in<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/usr/local/include.  I compiled a gcc on another system.  Slightly older operating system, but it worked when I tarred it up and moved it over.  Ugh, I hate doing that.  Then I used that working gcc to compile a new gcc on the target system so I could know everthing was configured correctly.</p>

<p>And now I'm up and running!  I just configured CPAN.pm and am busy installing the modules that I need.  Wow, this has been a nightmare.</p>

<p>Oh, and yesterday I got permission to temporarily move all the *.h files out of<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/usr/local/include in order to build a working gcc that would ignore it.  But in the end my compiler built on the other system idea worked.</p>

<p>Interestingly enough, Sun's cc also searches<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/usr/local/include, and so therefore it does not work on this system, either.  That was my team lead's initial response.  (And I discovered that my team does not even know what gcc or GNU are.)  So even the compiler they wanted me to use is borked up.</p>

<p>Option to change this is --with-local-prefix=dirname.  It doesn't seem to output with<nobr> <wbr></nobr>./configure --help on gcc 4.1.1.  Not sure if that means it's gone or what.  (I may know soon, though.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) )</p>
