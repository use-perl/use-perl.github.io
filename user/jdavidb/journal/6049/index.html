<div class="span8">
<p><p>Mark counts program lines.  Some people think that's crazy.  People
I respect (like Watts Humphrey of SEI.CMU) think it works fine.  I'm
sure Mark and Humphrey would probably be at odds over what to do with
the linecounts, though, because Mark's goal in this talk is to
<i>reduce</i> linecount.
<p>Red Flag 1: use an array instead of $X1, $X2, $X3.  Hands up; how
many people learned that in BASIC? :)  Yet some people still don't get
it in Perl.  Trust me, I've seen it.  I still like my predecessors,
but they have caused me some amazing problems with this simple mistake
alone.
<p>my($one, $two, $three, $four ...) = ...  Similar problem, only
worse.  Mark calls this problem "families of variables," in general.
<p>Better to have an array with two variables (which seems silly to
some people; I guess) than to repeat all the code twice. !
<p>Mark loves talking at YAPC because we already know what map does.
<p>Mark's final solution to a problem was the first one I thought of.
Weird.  He says, "Don't go with the solution you think of first."  But
he says if you thought of this first, you should go think of more
solutions and pick the best one.  Mark says Larry says the problem
most people have is they have a problem, they think of a solution, and
they implement it.  They don't think of several solutions, analyze
them, and pick the best one, which is engineering.
<p>That's exactly what's wrong with most of the systems I maintain at
work.  Somebody said, "I need this data," then somebody said, "You can
get it from here if you jump through twelve hoops."  So we jumped
through twelve hoops in code, and after a few years you're jumping
through fifteen hoops because of new requirements.  Meanwhile, the
docs actually told us the real way to do it, which only required one
or two hoops.  My predecessors were smart, but our organization
systematically encouraged this.
<p>One way is not as good as another.
<p>Interpolation with double quotes is almost always better than the
dot operator.  I believe this from my own experience.  He also says
don't put trailing slashes in scalars that are directory names,
because then you can "$dir/$file" and it's perfect.  My first boss
taught me that.  They had learned that from experience.
<p>It's ironic that a minute ago I was complaining about code my
predecessors left me, and then now I'm expressing gratitude for the
useful things they taught me.  Know that the overall feeling is
overwhelmingly gratitude, despite the complaints I had earlier.
<p>Mark's class is built so every piece of advice he gives has a
counterexample where the wrong way from the first situation is the
right way in the second situation.  The idea being that you should use
judgment rather than saying "MJD told me to code it like this."
<p>People who backslash things that don't need to be backslashed
indicate they are superstitious.  They could go try the code and see
how it works to decide if they need to do it or not.  I might mention
that indicates they are doing things without knowing what they are
doing.  As MJD said in gnat's lightning talk yesterday, "You can't
just make stuff up and expect the compiler to do what you want ... why
are you putting that in your program if you don't know what it does?"
<p>Precedence superstitions.  I probably suffer from some of this,
although I go by the Practical Programming philosophy of multiply
comes before add, put parenthesis around everything else.
Nevertheless, the parenthesis in <code>$scalar =~ (m/pattern/)</code>
are clearly extraneous.  <code>perl -MO=Deparse -e</code> is a useful
tool for curing precedence superstitions.
<p>Mark and Uri like unless.  Non-native speakers of English apparently
don't.
<p>Global variables.  Bad.  You knew that, right?  You cannot
understand the function in isolation, nor can you reuse the function
in another program.
<p>I understand there are 3 and 6 hours versions of this class, in
addition to the 1 1/2 hour one I'm seeing.  I'll have to arrange to
see the 3 hour version some day.
<p>The problem with some parameters is that they don't matter.  That
is, they don't mean anything.  I think that's why I shy away from
array subscripts so much.  Most of my arrays aren't used like C
arrays; they are collections.  Sometimes ordered, sometimes not, but
they fifth one doesn't mean anything different from the fourth one.
[Pseudo-hashes; same problem, I think.]  I foreach instead of
$array[$i].  $i has no meaning.  I think this makes me feel better
about my use of subscripts in my recent Stratego program, because
there the subscripts mean something.
<p>Mark says say what you mean a lot.  I say that to people a lot,
too.  Say what you mean especially in a regex.  Write your code to say
what you mean.  Name your variables to say what you mean.  And so on.
<p>Try it.  It's easier to see than to think.
<p>Prepending 0's to a number with extreme code repetition.  I've done
this.  I hate myself.  Fortunately I haven't done it since 1998.  I
met a friend called sprintf.
<p>Repeated code is boring to write.  You can't keep your brain engaged
and so you aren't thinking.
<p>Mark pointed out that even if you didn't know sprintf you STILL
shouldn't repeat.  You can use length and the x operator, or if you
didn't know the x operator you could use a while loop.  So, yes, I
confess my iniquities.  Fortunately I've learned so much since I
started programming Perl I have trouble feeling guilty for mistakes I
used to make four years ago.
<p>Backslash double quote is a red flag.  I should use qq instead.
Oddly, one in ten characters of HTML strings may turn out to be a
backslash!  It did in Mark's example.  It looks like it's a lot less
than that, but it's really that many.
<p>Repressed subconscious urges will always surface: making almost
global variables with huge lists of my variables to get around use
strict.  "Smoking in bed is bad because it sets off the fire alarm."
"That's why I always hang a sheet over the bed when I smoke in bed."
<p>Exercise: which of the strict effects is most valuable?  Which is
least valuable?</p>

<i>He also says don't put trailing slashes in scalars that are directory names, because then you can "$dir/$file" and it's perfect.</i> <br> <br>The one problem with this is that the root directory needs a trailing slash to be correct.  The above approach results in $dir = '/', $file = 'foo', "$dir/$file" = '//foo' - it gets a double slash for an important special case.  If you always leave the trailing slash, you can use "$dir$file" instead and $dir is correct.  Using '/foo/bar/' as a directory name is perhaps a bit ugly but correct.  (A doubled slash is also ugly but correct, so you choose whichever ugliness grates less.)

<p>Double slash makes it ugly to the OS; not having a slash between filename components makes it ugly to the programmer.  I choose making it nice for myself.</p>

<p>Plus, how often do you need to represent the root directory in a variable?  Do you write many temporary files there or anything?  Or permanent files?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<p>No, just a quick survey at one of MJD's training sessions.</p>
