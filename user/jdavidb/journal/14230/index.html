<p><p>I've been using the <a href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/www/hackdiet.html">hacker's diet</a> exercise program for about 18 weeks now.  I exercise for less than 15 minutes (more like 10, at the moment) every morning immediately after waking.  I've noticed that when I get up and exercise first thing, I usually don't need to drink a soft drink to get up any more!  Apparently exercise wakes me up and replaces my need for a caffeine jump-start.  I've been wanting to reduce my caffeine intake for awhile, so this is a welcome discovery.</p>

<p>I've also switched to diet drinks most of the time.  This seems to be helping the weight go down slowly, too.  Unfortunately, I hate most diet drinks.  I also find the store brands, which I usually purchased for sugared drinks, make really crummy diet versions.  I've found diet Dr. Pepper to be one of the best so far.</p></p>

<h2>The &quot;Joe Do Nothing Diet&quot;</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/gizmo_mathboy/">gizmo_mathboy</a> on 2003-08-21T03:51:13</h3>
At least that's what my friends call it.<br> <br>October 2001 I was around 240-250 pounds, by June 2002 I was around 210. I didn't do anything special, other than get laid off. I just didn't eat until I was stuffed, mostly ate until I felt full. I tried to eat more fruits and vegetables but failed. I never exercised.<br> <br>Earlier this year I was back to 220. I decided to stop putting sugar in my iced tea for lunch (I drink a lot of iced tea at lunch) as much to see how it would affect my weight as well as to get more sugar out of my diet. The "Do Nothing" diet worked again and I'm down to 205.<br> <br>I really wonder if I do even a little exercise each day, say crunches and pushups, if I would lose a little more. Ideally I would like to get down to 180-190 (I'm 6 feet tall).<br> <br>For whatever reason I seem to be able to lose weight rather easily. In high school I was a wrestler. Only once did I have to go to extreme measures to make my weight. Heck, ever other time I could have stood to add some weight. They exertion from practice would cause the fat to just melt away. I was a scrawny bastard when I graduated high school, 145. I put on about 30 pounds my freshman year and I looked ok (not fat but not muscular either), filled out I guess would be the term.<br> <br>In any case, I hope your effort pays off. I really need to do more cardio type stuff to keep the old heart in shape more than anything.

<p>I'm pretty sure Dr. Pepper contains caffeine, though I'm not sure how much...</p>

<p>Um, yeah.  The key is the word <b>reduce</b> my caffeine intake.  I reduced it; I didn't eliminate it.  I just don't need one in the mornings any more.</p>
