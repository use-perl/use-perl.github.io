<div class="span8">
<p><p>Someone here mentioned virtual hosting, and I'm starting to warm up to the idea.  I've found Linux virtual hosts as cheap as $5 a month.</p>

<p>At the moment my preferred hosting company is <a href="http://luxsci.com/extranet/hosting.html">Lux Scientiae</a>, primarily because they seem <i>incredibly</i> security conscious, and therefore also incredibly competent.  From them I can get just about any mail protocol over SSL, an https control center and web email app, ssh/scp access to my disk space, and a shell account, not to mention most of the things you might expect (though I don't see mod perl listed).  They even say they'll install perl modules for you.  A user testimonial even mentions they reworked their webmail interface to work with his Mac OS X browser.</p>

<p>If anyone has any experience with LuxSci in particular, or another hosting company that stands out (good or bad), I'd love to hear it.</p>

<p>I typed "linux virtual hosting" into Google to find these; LuxSci was about the fourth on the list.  I'm aiming at about $10/month, $100/year in services, although the first on the list was $5/month.</p>

<p>In related news, I'm getting hit by the big DirecTV broadband disaster.  It's a shame I found out from Slashdot before I found out from DirecTV.  I wanted DSL primarily for the always on connection and the static IP address, not the speed, because my purpose was to educate myself and be able to set up servers I fancied I might need, like CVS, or a prototype for a web-based school project I did this semester.  With virtual hosting in mind, I am tempted to switch back to dialup!</p></p>
