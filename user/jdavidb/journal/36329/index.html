<p><p>I saw a coworker I don't know personally reading a Kindle the other day at lunch.  At least, I think it was a Kindle.  I've never seen anything like it.  It looked so legible.  I want one.</p>

<p>Except that they don't do PDFs.  Well, they sort of do.  Apparently it converts them to something else for viewing, and that conversion is experimental.  It says "some complex PDFs may not render properly."</p>

<p>I don't want to deal with that!  The main reason I would want the Kindle is not for purchased books (although I'm sure I'd be tempted to do more of that than I can afford), but for reading a bunch of PDF books I have available.  This item would make those so much more valuable.</p>

<p>Why do they have to "convert" the PDFs for viewing?  What are they converting them to?  Honestly, would it have been too hard to have included actual PDF viewing software on the device?  For $399, can't they include a GPL-ed PDF viewer?</p>

<p>So, never mind on the Kindle, for now.</p></p>
