<p><p>I've been picking USPS media mail as my preferred shipper for a couple of years, now.  For one thing, the USPS has always been more reliable and provided better service to me than UPS and FedEx.  (Yes, I know a lot of people can't identify with that statement.)  For another, they are faster than those services about 50% of the time.</p>

<p>Plus, media mail is usually dirt cheap, and it is often free.  (Especially from Amazon and Bookpool.)  If I don't need something immediately, I pick media mail.</p>

<p>But today I got an unexpected surprise: a package I had shipped by media mail can be tracked at stamps.com.  That's a new feature, I think.  Yet another service of the commercial providers that the USPS has duplicated.</p>

<p>I'm happy, for now.  Some parts of the libertarian revolution can wait.</p></p>

That doesn't correspond at all to my experience.  I'm currently waiting for an order sent by media mail that shipped February 18, and two-week waits are typical. And I live in the middle of a major metropolitan area (DC), not the boonies. Also, a couple of years ago a book sent by media mail was damaged in transit.<br> <br>In contrast, UPS ground shipments routinely arrive in one day, at least if they're shipped from somewhere in the eastern US. I never pay for UPS two-day or next-day shipping.

<p>Got a media mail package this week that I ordered late last week.  Probably only took about 4 business days to get here.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, my other media mail package was delayed from Amazon, and when it finally shipped, they FedExed it.  It arrived last night.</p>
