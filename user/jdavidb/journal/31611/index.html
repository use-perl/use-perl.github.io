<p><p>Anyone know what's the intelligent way to connect to a machine with ssh and not see the MOTD?  I'm currently redirecting stderr to /dev/null, but obviously that means I miss some errors.  The -q option doesn't do it.  I can't see anything in the ssh manpage to help.  I don't have access to the server config files in question to tell them not to print the MOTD.  I can't find a way to pass my ssh client an option to pass to the server to tell it not to do that, but I'm hoping it exists.</p></p>

<p><br>ssh won't know anything about the source of the characters, it just transports them. I think you want to create a<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.hushlogin file to tell the shell not to show you that.<br></p>

<p>Unfortunately I don't have shell access.  I'm accessing with SFTP.  I guess maybe I can ask the vendor of the box to create the file, though.  Thanks!</p>

You can't transfer a file over SFTP?

<p>I can (although I thought I wouldn't have write access).  I tried it; it doesn't work.  My original response was addressing the fact that the shell was showing me the motd.  It's not the shell showing it; it's the sshd.  I'm not accessing a shell at any point, to my knowledge.  So I guess that's why<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.hushlogin doesn't work.  But thanks for trying to help.  At least I learned something.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

Try creating a<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.hushlogin file in the home directory of the account you're connecting to.<br><br>-Matt<br>
