<p><p>Wikipedia handles articles for different subjects with the same name by using parenthetical expressions to disambiguate:</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software)">Git (software)</a> vs. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(album)">Git (album)</a>.</p>

<p>However, when you go to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git">the disambiguation page that links to both of those</a>, you see that the parentheses have been encoded: <URL:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_%28software%29>.</p>

<p>My problem is that in my browser history, <URL:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_%28software%29> and <URL:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software)> are completely different objects.  And one of them is completely unreadable and unwieldy.  Firefox is smart enough to display the links correctly when I hover over them.  But it does not know that it can convert that link back to the readable form and make my life easier.</p>

<p>This gets even worse when I try to get links to RSS feeds back out of Google Reader where I have subscribed to them.  Occasionally I want to pass such links to someone, or pass them a link where they can view the feed's history in Reader, which is accomplished by prefixing <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/view/feed">http://www.google.com/reader/view/feed</a> to the feed URL.  Firefox beautifully allows me to right click on the links Reader provides that would be equal to that string and copy it, but Google has URL-encoded it to death, so colons, backslashes, and who knows what all else have been turned into ugly percent-containing strings that I am scared to transmit over email or, worse, use as the target of a link on a web forum post.  The most convenient solution available to me seems to be to go back and manually de-URI-encode the link, and so therefore it doesn't happen much.</p>

<p>I'm sure there's some technical reason why this "has" to be done, but it's obvious that in practice (from the links above) it does <i>not</i> really have to be done most of the time, and I would love to hear someone tell me that this is a technical misunderstanding and that this really isn't required and all these people should change their software.</p>

<p>Footnote of supreme irony: while previewing my post, my two example links using parentheses broke because the space gets lost somewhere along the line. :)  But the parentheses are just fine.</p>

<p>Footnote of supreme irony #2: I can't post here examples of the URLs I hate because something DE-URI-encodes them to make them look right!  They are in the above, but to really see them you'll have to go to the disambiguation page I linked to.</p></p>

<h2>Actually</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Aristotle/">Aristotle</a> on 2007-08-06T17:10:31</h3>
<p>The right thing to do is to stop <em>not</em> URI-encoding everything. The browser should use the encoded form as a key everywhere and show it in some contexts when it matters (eg. autocompletion when typing) but show it decoded as an aid when that&#8217;s OK.</p>

<p>(For basis, see also: homographs.)</p>



<h2>History</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/bart/">bart</a> on 2007-08-06T17:54:42</h3>
I can think of this as a browser bug: it should treat the URI-encoded and equivalent non-URI-encoded URL as the same URL, for the history.
