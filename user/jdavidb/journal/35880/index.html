<p><p>Another reason I like $NEW_JOB:</p>

<p>I just went to buy something from the vending machine.  The spiral wire holding the item spun a little while, then stopped before my item was vended.  I've seen it pause like that before, so I wasn't yet too worried it was going to get stuck.  It then proceeded to unwind a little more, until my item dropped ...</p>

<p>... and promptly got stuck, with the bottom end of the package sticking underneath the wire.  Oops.  At this point I did think I'd lost my item, and was starting to wonder if shaking the machines is appropriate here (it was at $OLD_JOB).  But suddenly the wire started to unwind again ... and unwound until the <i>next</i> item in the slot had fallen, along with the one I paid for.</p>

<p>Wow.  Apparently the machines here are built with the idea that they'd rather err on the side of vending more items than you paid for rather than taking your money without giving you anything due to a mishap.  Wow.</p>

<p>I took the extra item back to the storeroom where I know $FOUNDER's grandson keeps the items he puts in the vending machine.  Not sure if the boy gets to keep the profit from the machines or not, but I sure wouldn't want to rip him off, nor whoever else might be benefiting from the machines.  Especially after the courtesy that was just shown to me.</p></p>
