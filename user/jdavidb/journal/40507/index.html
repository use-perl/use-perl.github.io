<p><p>I'm doing some quick code generation (the output is Java), and I found myself writing the below routine.  I like it because of the names I picked for the variables.  Not exactly self-documenting (although it is when you think about it), but this is throwaway.  You can probably tell what the code is doing and why I named the variables as I did, and you might be entertained.</p>

No, I didn't.  Thanks!

<p>LOL!

</p><p>And you were leaving comments on perl 5 and 6 replying to my criticisms of the language? Maybe its time to change your sig:

</p><p> <i>"J. David works really hard reimplementing bult-in functions"</i>

<i>J. David writes a lot of one-off crap and wishes he wrote Perl full-time...</i>

<p>My signature was a quote from someone here about me that was just so incredibly complimentary that I grabbed it and kept it.  I suppose keeping it was a little pompous, but you know, it really built me up.  And reminds me to try to be a good programmer even when circumstances aren't always conducive.</p><p>To that end, even my one-off crap used strict and warnings, but I guess it still doesn't get me out of the guilt from reinventing a wheel.  Has ucFirst been around forever, or was it something that came around after I quit doing Perl full-time in 2007?  (Hoping for a little reprieve.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:P<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) )</p>

<p>Hey, I think its a really nice quote; personally I wouldn't use it in my sig - maybe just quote it in my website or something, dunno. I would treasure it just like you did, though.

</p><p>ucfirst() has been around for ages, afaik. At least a decade, possibly much more.

</p><p>Why did you quit doing Perl full time?  Was it a decision or did the market push you to it? Just curious. Do you actually want to go back to writing Perl full-time?

</p><p>I am currently doing Objective-C most of the time, and even though I miss some of the ease with which you can process strings in Perl, I'm quite happy with the way things are.

<p>I changed jobs in 2007 in order to be able to move my family out close to my inlaws.  In my previous job I was doing Perl with pressure to switch to Java.  I traded that for doing Java after all, but closer to where I wanted to be, in a business environment that is somewhat saner.</p>

Similar to what I went through around 2005/2006. Except that what ended up deciding was how much more Java programmers were able to make, especially if they sported the magic "J2EE" incantations. Boy, was I wrong. When I first saw EJBs I knew it was time to get a new job.
