<p><p>Someone else is giving gnat's something, something talk.  MJD stayed
for this talk, so I figure this'll be good.
<p>Something, something <i>faster</i> is a condensed version of a three
hour optimization talk.  With a lot of cussing.  Our cussing was
surprisingly provided by a Disney employee standing in for gnat.  I
haven't trusted Disney for family entertainment in years, so I wasn't
nearly as surprised as some people.
<p>Management is optimizing the users away.
<p>There's some profiling stuff here.  That's good; I like profiling.
<p>There's a Benchmark.pm module that will run something repeatedly and
see how long it takes.  In 5.8 it will take its own overhead into
account.
<p>Devel::SmallProf runs for each line, which makes it slow.
<p>csh has a better version of the time command, but that's still not
an excuse for using csh. :)
<p>Function calls are ~25% faster than method calls.  If Perl 6 fixed
only that about the OO model, it would be great.
<p>I've finally had the Schwarzian transform explained to me!  Now I
understand.  map sort map.
