Seems like tuxedo.org got hacked.  Eric's <a href="http://www.tuxedo.org/user/esr/writings/" title="tuxedo.org">writings</a tuxedo.org> page now redirects to <a href="http://www.debian.org/" title="debian.org">debian.org</a debian.org>.  His <a href="http://www.tuxedo.org/user/esr/faqs/" title="tuxedo.org">faqs</a tuxedo.org> page goes to the <a href="http://www.eff.org/" title="eff.org">the EFF</a eff.org>.  And some of his individual pages are linking elsewhere, like <a href="http://www.publicknowledge.org/" title="publicknowledge.org">Public Knowledge</a publicknowledge.org>.
<p>
This smells like a political hack.  His <a href="http://www.tuxedo.org/user/esr/continuity.html" title="tuxedo.org">Continuity</a tuxedo.org> page (who should take over his projects should he be hit by a bus) now links to the <a href="http://www.fsf.org/" title="fsf.org">FSF</a fsf.org>.</p>

Not really. If you repeatedly try to get the same URL, you'll get different 302 responses (<i>moved temporarily</i>).

<p>
I first read that as "302 different responses", and wondered how many times you had hit reload to figure that out.</p>

Eric's stuff is now at www.catb.org.  Scuttlebutt has it that the random redirects are tuxedo.org's WebMaster's way of getting people to update their links.<br> <br>N

<p>Thanks; that's just what I was looking for.  Google didn't know it yet, at least not in the first few links, but I did find <a href="http://216.239.37.100/search?q=cache:BAPjE06IMpUC:www.tuxedo.net/user/esr/+eric+raymond&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8" title="216.239.37.100">this</a 216.239.37.100> after reading your post, which leads to catb.org.  Guess we better get started letting Google know where the new preferred location for <a href="http://www.catb.org/user/esr/" title="catb.org">Eric Raymond</a catb.org> is.</p>

<p>ROTFL!</p>

<p>I'll repeat what I said yesterday in davorg's journal: Perl programmers are smart people and have interesting opinions which I benefit from being exposed to, even when I disagree or those opinions are wrong, because in general those opinions are well thought out, teach me something, and help me to think.  Eric Raymond, though not a Perl programmer, is also a very smart person.  Things he has said have really, really caused me to think.  And, no, I don't agree with a lot of what he's said.  For one thing, I'm a Christian and he's a pagan.</p>

<p>In conclusion to my previous post, I'll just say don't <a href="http://www.petdance.com/perl/geek-culture/" title="petdance.com">flip the bozo bit</a petdance.com> on Eric Raymond just because of his stance on weapons.  A lot of what he says is still worth your thought.  (Thinking about the weapons issue is, too, even if you don't agree.)</p>

<p>I find it ironic that somewhere back there people were putting forth Raymond as a more tolerable spokesman than Stallman.  Perhaps most of that sentiment came from Raymond himself, though.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)</p>

<p>
I don't believe I'm on the record anywhere on the topic of gun control.  This is not the issue.
</p>
<p>
I found his comments inappropriate.  He's a self-described and self-appointed spokesman for Linux and Open Source.  He used that self-appointed position to push his other views that have absolutely nothing to do with Linux or Open Source.  Worse, he tried to associate his views with the rest of use who have, at one point or another, identified with Linux or Open Source.  (Yes, he did include a disclaimer.  Why then, did he push his release to organizations such as NewsForge?)
</p>

<p>
I reserve the right to flip the bozo bit on people who don't know when and where to speak.

I don't ignore ESR because he likes guns.  I ignore him because -- for example -- he wrote that it is <a href="http://armedndangerous.blogspot.com/2002_11_24_armedndangerous_archive.html#85135479" title="blogspot.com">reasonable to kill an airport security screener</a blogspot.com>.<br> <br>Oh, if only I were making it up.

<p>Hmm, yeah, kind of hard to get around that one.  He does seem to say he doesn't think things have gotten that bad, yet, and I bet he flies without shooting the screeners.</p>

<p>Myself, I thank security screeners.  I really made some guy's day in London last April; I must have been the only one.  (Meanwhile, the American Airlines pilot travelling in our group cheerfully had his fingernail clipper confiscated.)</p>

I think in the <i>very limited</i> area of OS/FS software hacking, ESR has made some interesting observations.  Other than that, I really don't think he has much of interest to say.  His political views are just silly, because they lack any sense of history (or present reality).  Even on software hacking, he often starts spouting BS, maybe just to hear his own voice.<br> <br>Ever watched the Revolution OS movie?  I got so annoyed during some of the ESR interviews I almost started shouting "you're a moron" at the screen.  It would have been quite amusing had I done so, since I saw it at OSCON 2001 and it turns out ESR was in the theater about 15 rows ahead of me<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)
