<p><p>Saturday Sarah and I became engaged.  We met online almost a year ago, and have tentatively set our date for July 5th of next year.</p>

<p>Some things geeks might like to know:</p>

<p>You can now email Sarah at sarah@mydomain.  (Like, if you want to express condolences or warn her off, or whatever.)  She's moving to my town from two hours away for school this fall, and she needed to get a new email account since she'll be leaving her family's long standing AOL account.  She was talking last night about getting a yahoo account or something, when I suggested since we were getting married the least I could do was let her share my domain. ;)</p>

<p>Sarah is the second most tech-savvy AOL user I know.  She's also been on the net longer than I have.</p>

<p>I just whipped up a Perl program with Time::Piece to let me know how long it is till we get married.</p>

<p>Sarah is both a Star Trek and Star Wars fan.  She has the entire Star Trek original series taped.  We both like the prequels.</p></p>

<i>Sarah is both a Star Trek and Star Wars fan. She has the entire Star Trek original series taped. </i> <p>
That sounds like one facet of a good basis for marriage - it worked for me.  My wife used to get strange looks in high school when she got excited on the night that Star Trek was on (original series).  We got hooked on Next Gen together.  Next year will mark our 20'th anniversary so far, with no end in sight.</p>

<p>I always considered that a compromisable issue in a relationship, but then I met Sarah and learned my standards should be higher.</p>

<p>Don't settle for anything less!<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>
