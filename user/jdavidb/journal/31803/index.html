<p><p>So I've wrapped up <code>warn</code> and <code>die</code> in order to log whatever they say using Log::Log4perl.  However, in my code at one point, I perform an <code>eval</code>, planning to check <code>$@</code> and ignore it in the most common case, but re-<code>die</code> again if it is something unexpected.  Unfortunately, this breaks logging by my definition: I'm still ignoring the case of $@ I specified, but that caught exception is getting logged.  I don't want that.</p>

<p>I can mess around with local and removing the %SIG handler, but that still doesn't fix all my problems: I'm calling a module where the author also does an eval that runs some code that occasionally traps an exception I definitely don't want to see (and don't even understand).</p>

<p>I want my @SIG{'__WARN__','__DIE__'} to not fire within an eval.  Anyone know how to do that?</p></p>

First of all, there's the special variable $^S that is set in a special way inside <tt>eval</tt>. Check <a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/perlvar.html#$%5ES" title="perl.org">perlvar</a perl.org> for the details. So, you check its value in the $SIG{__DIE__} handler, and respond appropriately to its current value.<br><br>Second, I think I saw a module recently that did a<p><blockquote> <div><tt>local $SIG{__DIE__};</tt></div> </blockquote> before invoking the eval &mdash; or even inside it, before doing anything dangerous.<br><br>Some modules even do<p><blockquote> <div><tt>local $SIG{__DIE__} = 'DEFAULT';</tt></div> </blockquote> though I don't know about any benefit. I guess there is none.<br>

<p>That special var looks like what I want!  Thank you!.  Although by now I've adopted a totally different approach to get around it.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)  But I still wanted to know the answer, because this is going to bite me again.</p>

<p>I tried local and the DEFAULT thing, but it still became a problem because I'm using modules by other people that do eval's.</p>

Unfortunately, it's just a problem you have to live with.  I've got <tt>local $SIG{__DIE__};</tt> scattered all over my code, not because I've written a DIE handler, but because Mason has one.  I can see why they do it, but it's a nuisance.  I'd really like a way for the handler to only apply in certain circumstances...

The consensus (that I only partially agree with) appears to be that every $SIG{__DIE__} handler is supposed to check $^S. So it really should be considered a bug in Mason.<br><br>Personally I would have preferred it if $SIG{__DIE__} handlers would just not be called in eval. Life would have been a  lot simpler, then.
