<h2>All I know</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Aristotle/">Aristotle</a> on 2008-01-17T17:07:30</h3>
<p>&#8230; is that I hate Tk.</p>



<h2>Cocoa</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Dom2/">Dom2</a> on 2008-01-17T18:37:34</h3>
All I know is that <a href="http://developer.apple.com/cocoa/" title="apple.com">Cocoa</a apple.com> is the only thing that hasn't made me barf just reading the docs / sample code.  <a href="http://developer.apple.com/tools/interfacebuilder.html" title="apple.com">Interface Builder</a apple.com> is superb.

<p> <a href="http://trolltech.com/products/qt" title="trolltech.com">QT</a trolltech.com> looked interesting, but C++?  You've got to be kidding.

</p><p>Many years ago, I confess to purchasing a <a href="http://www.opengroup.org/motif/" title="opengroup.org">Motif</a opengroup.org> programming manual.  I started reading and never wrote a single line of code such was my revulsion.

</p><p>Plus, what Aristotle said about Tk.

</p><p>On the whole though, writing GUI programs makes me realise why I like the command line so much&#8230;</p>

<p>FWIW, I really don&#8217;t hate <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Gtk2" title="cpan.org">Gtk2</a cpan.org>. The docs can be a bit sparse at times, mind, but I haven&#8217;t found much to complain about in the framework as such, and the quality of the bindings is superb. They have had serious effort (both conceptual and labour-wise) put into them by a large group of people over a long time and the spit and polish really shows.</p>

<p>I have to say that wiring up event handlers and juggling widgets in a language that has closures and automatic memory management is <em>so</em> much nicer than doing GUIs in any ALGOL descendant.</p>

<p>As for Qt, well the toolkit itself is written in C++, but that doesn&#8217;t necessarily count for much; there are Perl bindings. And conceptually, I hear it&#8217;s pretty well thought-out. I don&#8217;t know if the bindings are any good though.</p>

<p>I played with the Perl GTK bindings briefly circa early 2002.  I recall that I really liked them, but at the time I think I was a Gnome fanboy.  I had a graduate-level machine learning class in which we were using matlab as our standing programming and GUI tool, and I was actually planning on using Perl, PDL, and GTK instead for a while.</p>

<p>But I remember zilch, and I realize I have very little basis for comparison amongst other GUI toolkits.  My opinion that GTK was great, or that I really like Swing (I'm starting to like Swing) doesn't count for much, and I know it, so I'm hunting around for perspective.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<p>Note that I&#8217;m talking about Gtk2, the bindings for gtk+ 2.0, not Gtk-Perl, the bindings for gtk+ 1.2. The latter were far more rudimentary and have long since been abandoned, as has the underlying toolkit.</p>

<h2>Which ?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/sigzero/">sigzero</a> on 2008-01-17T19:07:34</h3>
I actually like Tk and the new themeing that is out for it now.<br/><br/>I like wxWidgets as well.

<h3><a href="/user/Ron Savage/">Ron Savage</a> on 2008-01-17T23:46:29</h3>
I refuse to use things like Tk and wxWidgets.<br>Having to specify placement of items is not how I want to spend my time.<br><br>So I use HTML and get the browser to do most of the layout-type work for me.<br><br>And yes, I'm lucky in that I can get all my clients to accept browser interfaces to anything.

<p>The proper way of writing UIs manually is by packing widgets into hboxes and vboxes, which is pretty much the same as table-based HTML layout. HTML done properly (ie. without tables for layout) is <em>worse</em> than that, actually, since CSS only provides a float model and absolute positioning. There have been some tentative steps towards hbox/vbox style positioning in drafts of newer versions of CSS, but the CSS WG is not exactly the most healthy or productive working group around.</p>
