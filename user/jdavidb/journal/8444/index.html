Given all my deadlines, does anyone know anything about "speed <i>writing</i>"?

{grin}</p>



<h2>A blessing and a curse</h2>

Speed reading has its uses --- surely you've read technical specs and just glossed over sections. Similar to speed reading. The speed readers just extract the gist rapidly and move on.<br> <br>It's also a nasty thing when it comes to anywhere the author's crafted their words. You miss the joy of reading the words, reflecting on why the author chose them, etc. A tragedy.<br> <br>I sometimes catch myself speeding over some books and have to deliberately go back a few pages and carefully read. It's not good.

I think that's my fastest rate I hit in high school when I was learning to speed read. I had about an 80% comprehension/retention rate. I stopped speed reading so I have really lost the skill. I still remember most of the techniques and such but I don't use it much anymore.<br> <br>I was able to consume a lot of books during that phase. It's definitely a skill that takes some effort to acquire and maintain.
