<p><p>I just tried to type "cause loss," and came out with "cause lause," or something like that.  After correcting "loss," I went on to type the word "rate," and came out with "reight."  What is wrong with me??</p>

<p>My senior year in high school I once stayed up nearly all night long typing a very, very long assignment.  I found that after a few hours of sleep deprivation, I developed the strange habit of trying to add a silent "e" to every single word.  In fact, that habit has never completely left me, but it has faded in the years since.</p></p>

I find that I mispell/misspell words much more now than I used to.  I've always thought it had to do with getting older and having a critical brain cell die.  The one that takes over probably just didn't pay as much attention in school -- that's what I get for slacking off...
