<p><p>RT needs an O'Reilly book.  We'll know RT has arrived when it has its own book.  Looking at how much it seems to be in use, I'm guessing that may be soon.  (Gnat?)</p>

<p>I might sound like an anti-business guy or something, but I look forward to seeing large-scale proprietary systems supplanted by open source alternatives with freedom.  I hope BestPractical (the company that supports RT) is making out good on their business model.  Going further I sometimes imagine OS and RDBMS vendors gradually adopting this business model.</p></p>

<p>the RT book proposal was turned down due to a lack of forseeable financial viability.</p>

In order to have a book about a useful tool (it looks very useful) it needs to be viable? Wouldn't it help the viability of RT to have a good manual/book for it?<br> <br>Just some late night/early morning crankiness I guess.

<p>Well, considering that O'Reilly, like many publishers, are in the business of _making money, yes they do whatever they can to make sure their investment is a sound one. If it's any comfort, AW gave it a pass too. The book market is utterly awful right now and pubs can't afford to publish on a whim like they did in the boom time.</p>

Why not create an Open Source manual, using a wiki (a la wikipedia)? Not a discussion, but an O'Reillyesque user guide. Now the only question remaining is, what 19th century animal woodcut should we use?
