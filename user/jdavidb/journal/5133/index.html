<div class="span8">
<p><p>I never could find a good comprehensive guide to turning CD's into MP3's with Linux, and I found out how recently, so I thought I'd post it for posterity.  Note that I am legally entitled to translate my CD's into any audio format I choose, as long as I am not sharing them.  [I am not a lawyer; this is not legal advice.]</p>

<p>If anyone actually wants to use this document for a HOWTO or other documentation project, you can redistribute it under either the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License or the GNU GPL.</p>

<p>I'm using Debian.  You're on your own if you're not.  I install abcde and all of its prerequisites, of which the main one is cdparanoia.  Now, I want to rip to MP3 (some day I'll probably go the OGG route), so I change OUTPUTTYPE in /etc/abcde.conf to mp3.  (I'm sure there's a per-user file where you can change this, too.)  Making MP3's with abcde requires two other packages: id3v2 and toolame.  The program actually requests a program called lame, but to get that you'll need to install toolame and make a symbolic link from /usr/bin/toolame to /usr/bin/lame.  I suspect lame is a piece of proprietary software and toolame is a free clone, but I didn't look into this.</p>

<p>The CD ROM appears to be /dev/hdc.  abcde wants it to be /dev/cdrom, so I make a symlink.  (This was the case on my ibook and my intel machine; YMMV.)  I also change the group ownership of /dev/hdc to audio and add myself to group audio so I can do this without being root.  That's probably a bad idea long term.  (Like if you ever want to use a data CDROM again.)</p>

<p>Then you just put the CD in and run abcde.  It does a lot of nice things for you including naming the tracks.</p>

<p>I learned most of this the hard way.  If there's an easy way I should have learned it, please post links. :)</p>

<p>Coming soon, or at least some day: actually getting your Debian GNU/Linux system to play sound.  (In some ways RedHat really has a leg up, but I don't think I'd trade apt-get.  Besides, having to figure this all out myself is educational.)</p></p>

I haven't used <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/lame/" title="sourceforge.net">LAME</a sourceforge.net> but it isn't commercial, though i'm not sure what the difference between it and <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/toolame/" title="sourceforge.net">toolame</a sourceforge.net> is. <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/winlame/" title="sourceforge.net">winLAME</a sourceforge.net> is a pretty nifty win32 encoder which I have used.

<p>The primary difference for me was I couldn't <tt>apt-get install lame</tt>.  At least, not with only a free setup.  (No contrib or non-free.  I try those from time to time when looking for something I need for school, but this was for fun, and I saw toolame first.)</p>



<h2>Double take</h2>

<p>Gasp!  Sputter!  What happened to sourceforge?  It<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... changed.</p>

<h2>BeOS is your friend</h2>

I do almost all of my cd ripping in BeOS with a very nice gui app called "Flipside A.E.".  Let's you choose your encoder (including ogg), naming style, bitrate, etc.

<p>iTunes used to be my friend, back when my Macintosh would boot<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)  But I never got much into it, then.</p>
