<p><p>If I wanted to write a Strawberry program to run as a daemon and periodically pop up alerts on my machine, and I had no Windows Perl GUI programming experience other than an abortive look at WxPerl years before anybody ever thought of Strawberry, what module would I be looking for?</p></p>

<p>Any of the GUI toolkits that are available from CPAN?</p><p>- Wx<br>- Tk<br>- Win32::GUI<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...</p><p>Should all work either out of the box or after a simple "cpan" invocation. I haven't used the latter toolkit, though.</p>

To clarify, I was looking for recommendations.  I figured everybody would say Win32::GUI, but I wanted to see what prevailing thought is.

<h3><a href="/user/Alias/">Alias</a> on 2010-06-10T01:07:06</h3>
<p>For simple jobs where the gui is incidental and doesn't dominate the application, I'd probably agree on Win32::GUI is you can deal with it.</p>

<h2>Growl</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/link/">link</a> on 2010-06-09T18:14:26</h3>
<p>This sounds like something growl would be a decent match for. I have not used it myself but Growl::GNTP should let you send notifications to growl from perl.</p>

<h3><a href="/user/jdavidb/">jdavidb</a> on 2010-06-09T19:14:31</h3>
<p>Hmm, Growl looks like it's going to solve a number of my problems.  Unfortunately I simplified my original question and I'm not sure Growl alone will be up to that task.  But I think I owe you lunch for showing me this!</p>



<h2>Re:Growl</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jdavidb/">jdavidb</a> on 2010-07-27T14:27:08</h3>
<p>Thank you very much for this suggestion.  Growl turned out to be perfect for a LOT of things I want to do.</p>

As you said<p><div class="quote"><p>periodically pop up alerts on my machine</p></div><p>do you even need a GUI toolkit? It seems to me like a plain <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms645505(VS.85).aspx" title="microsoft.com">MessageBox</a microsoft.com> API call is all you need.
</p><p>That is, unless you want the script to continue running while the message is shown.
In that case, you could set up a simple window with <a href="http://www.darserman.com/Perl/Loft/" title="darserman.com">The GUI Loft</a darserman.com>. Oldie, but probably good enough.
</p><p>And I've never seen a service with a GUI, I'm not sure if it will behave nicely.</p>

<p>Actually I think I'll probably input a couple of things into the dialog box, so it's more than just a message box.</p><p>But I'm unclear on what you're suggesting<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... write XS code?  Or is there some standard way to call MessageBox from Perl?  I'm pretty ignorant.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<p>I said</p><p><div class="quote"><p>And I've never seen a service with a GUI, I'm not sure if it will behave nicely.</p></div><p>and today I found this blog post: <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/yvesdolc/archive/2009/08/20/do-you-still-use-the-messagebox-api-in-your-windows-service.aspx" title="msdn.com">Do you still use the MessageBox API in your Windows Service? (Or do you display any type of User Interface?)</a msdn.com></p><p>and it says:</p><blockquote><div><p>Starting with Windows Vista and above, user interfaces generated by Windows services can&#8217;t be seen. And even worst, your service could be stuck waiting for some user input that the user cannot give as she does not see anything!</p></div></blockquote><p>It goes on to give a generic solution (plus a simple solution for just a messagebox), but it's anything but trivial.</p><p>But I was right to be wary.</p><p>And I'm not sure that this solution will work on a Windows earlier than Vista. At worst, you might have to hack in 2 interfaces, for multiple versions of Windows.</p>
