<p><p>I've been on the new job a month as of today.  Most of that time has been spent getting up to speed on Java itself.</p>

<p>Yesterday I was getting some weird errors out of my IDE that didn't make any sense at all.  It kept saying it couldn't find a certain constructor I was expecting to be there.  I vaguely remembered having a similar error last week with the command-line javac and a couple of classes I was playing with; I'd fixed it by working around it since I wasn't devoted to getting those classes perfect.</p>

<p>But yesterday I wanted to find out what was going on.  I started Googling and digging through a Java book.  Finally I realized what was happening:</p>

<p>Ladies and gentlemen, after nearly a month of solid Java study, I did not realize until late yesterday afternoon that while Java subclasses inherit methods, they do not inherit <b>constructors</b>.</p>

<p>Papa always said I was oblivious. :)</p></p>

I'm not sure I realized that either<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:/<br><br>I did a whole Java project without apparently realizing it.

<p>ROTFL!  Now I feel better!</p>

<p>I'm also still struggling with the fact that constructors aren't really methods that just happen to return a new object.  In fact they don't return anything at all.</p>

<p>I believe the site I found that clarified the issue of method inheritance vs. constructor inheritance stated that calling constructors methods was a bit like saying the platypus was just another mammal.  But then, when I finally tracked down the statement about the lack of constructor inheritance in O'Reilly's <i>Learning Java</i> (and it eluded me because it is not in the section on inheritance; it's in an earlier section), they basically admitted that constructors are methods with some really serious differences.</p>

<p>For the record, constructors and methods are different in the Java reflection API.  I wrote a little utility awhile back that basically reads a class file and spits out as much of the original code as it can get from the reflection API, providing a class file full of declarations.  (All this was an exercise in the reflection API, but more importantly just in writing a complex Java program.)  I was profoundly disturbed by the duplicated code I had to output method and constructor declarations, but I found it was impossible to find a way to reuse the code, as it had to be different for both Method and Constructor arguments.</p>
