<p><p><a href="http://use.perl.org/user/jdavidb/journal/20696">These guys</a> never delivered.  The end of the story was we had to call their warehouse directly for an order of that magnitude.  A very distracted sounding woman took our order.  When I hung up, I told my wife I had the feeling the lady didn't write a single thing down and we'd never hear from them again.</p>

<p>We went over our recent credit card statements last night to verify that we were never charged, and I guess we'll start over again with a company that actually wants to sell something to us.  Anyone know a good site for cheap DVD-R's?</p></p>

I have purchased all of my DVD-R's (for my Pioneer 810 Tivo) from them. I buy in 100 disc spindles (Ritek), about $45.<br> <br>

<p>Maybe we should try them again, then.  (We have the same Tivo, incidentally.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) )  We were trying to buy an enormous quantity to get the best discount, and that seemed to confuse them, as they forwarded our call to the warehouse people, who seemed very confused.</p>
