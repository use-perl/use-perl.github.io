<p><p>Yesterday I made the comment about my coworkers that, "I know more about Perl than anyone else here."  Well, today I am put to shame because a few days back a coworker asked me how to write a program to send an attachment and I said, "I don't know, sorry, you'll have to find a module to do it and teach yourself."  Well, he went out and got after it and self-taught himself how to send attachments with MIME::Lite.  Then today he taught me, and, combined with a great technique for interfacing with Remedy saved my bacon, made me look good, and helped me to fill an urgent user need.  I've been wanting to know how to do this for a long time but never learned.  Must remember to emphasize to the end-users (and their managers) that it's the other guy they should thank for this program.</p>

<p>Sending attachments ... I feel myself growing stronger in the Force. :)</p></p>

BTW, what module or technique are you talking abou that interfaces with Remedy? I'd like to create a command line utility to add quick notes to tickets in Remedy.

<p>For what you're looking for you probably want the ARS.pm module (usually referred to as "ARSperl").</p>

<p>The technique my coworker showed me was how to create an "ARTask" shortcut.  It's basically a plain-text file record of a Remedy query.  I'd been sending out an audit to certain people who couldn't access the records on the audit, so now I'm emailing them the canned query as an attachment.  They open the attachment, and Remedy starts up automatically and runs the query.  I'll send you details if you want.</p>

<p>The strange thing about this technique is that you never actually have to access Remedy, because you're just writing a (possibly complex) query into a text file.</p>
