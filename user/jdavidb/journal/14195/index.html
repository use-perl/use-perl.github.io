<p><p>Sarah is moving to DFW this Saturday for school.  She'll be living with her grandmother in the next city, but a lot closer!</p>

<p>Since Sarah's new home will not have room for all of her things, and since we'll be married in less than a year, God willing, she's putting a lot of her books in my house.  (Seems Sarah's homeschooling parents believed in taking the kids to Half Price Books once a week.  Say ... I live around the corner from a Half Price Books...)  I'm sitting here with five (heavy, for a wimpy geek like me) boxes of her books.</p>

<p>It's amazing how much you can tell about a person by their books.  For one thing, I'm looking at at least one box that's packed solid full of Star Trek novels.  I have the biggest collection of Star Trek novels I'd ever seen ... until now.  Now I realize why she rearranged my bookshelf the other day and separated out the Star Trek and Star Wars books; she needed more room on the Star Trek shelf.  (She'll need multiple shelves, actually.)</p>

<p>I can see a lot of what went into developing the mind I'm marrying.  Sometimes the similarities between us are frightening.  There's books on her own independent interests, but then there's religious books on uncommon beliefs that we share, science fiction books, and in general things that make me say, "Cool!  Wish I'd had one of those!" when I pull them out.  No wonder we were so attracted to each other.</p>

<p><b>Update:</b> Make that two boxes of Star Trek books.  And we're going to have to get rid of some duplicates.  Hmm, hardback versions of some of my favorites! :)</p></p>

Before you throw out your paperback copies of your favorite Star Trek books, consider this: In the many year to come of life together, will you two continue to be buying books? Do you expect to be affording to buy bigger and bigger houses in which to store them?<br/><br/>If not, consider sticking with the paperbacks. Speaking from experience (my garage is filled with cartons of books from the attic which has become a bedroom), there's a reason that hardcovers don't sell for a premium.
