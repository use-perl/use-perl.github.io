<p>I read a name in a mailing list last thursday; that name was the same one of a friend of mine when I was a child, Michele B. (oviously I'm not going to write his surname here!).<br/><br/>I decided to try the luck and write him, asking if he lived in my same town when he was a little child.<br/><br/>He said yes. He was the same Michele I played with until we were 5 and he followed his parents away from the town. I remember I missed him a lot...<br/><br/>On saturday, I went to my parents' house in town, and spent a couple of hours with a box of old photos. It took a while, but I finally got home with four photos, that I passed through the scanner and put on the Internet for Michele to see them.<br/><br/>There was Michele (nearly) alone in the first, his mother in the second, his father in the third.<br/><br/>The fourth was a group photo taken during my fourth birthday party. I was amazed looking at the smiles of all the children there: no sadness, no bad remebers, no worries in those eyes, just happiness.<br/><br/>Looking at those smiles, I realized that no adult man can smile the same way (unless they are really happy with their life). And that I missed a friend so much.<br/><br/>Welcome from the past, Michele. I hope we won't lose each other again, and that we can meet soon.</p>
