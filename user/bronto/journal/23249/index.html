<h2>I decided I am a communist</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/mary.poppins/">mary.poppins</a> on 2005-02-18T22:02:17</h3>
I decided I am an (anarchist) communist.<br> <br>I decided, because technology has implications on the rest of our society, to promote free software.<br> <br>I decided that libertarian left-wing politics should embrace worker control wherever it take hold; hence:  if I support worker control in general, I should support free software in particular.<br> <br>I promote free software because it is made by and for the people who use it, without much interference from bosses.<br> <br>I promote free UNIX because it is useful, costs nothing, and makes me happy.<br> <br>I publish my own programs on the network in the hope that they will be useful for at least one human being.<br> <br>I decided what I am doing. And I decided I am a communist.<br> <br>Because software affects the society I live in, and because "political" is broadly used to indicate anything that affects society, and because I care about what sort of society I live in, I make "political" choices about software.<br> <br>I give meanings to the things I do.<br> <br>I want to be helpful to people, I want to do something useful for people. I decided that one way to do this is being communist.<br> <br>Hugs all around!
