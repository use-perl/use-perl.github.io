<p>So said that short Beatles' song that you may or may not know, but that's not important.</p>

<p>I am starting to close this year's gates and go into the next one, and it looks like a wind of change is timidly starting to blow. My application for a job abroad has been dropped after two consecutive interviews, but at least I had them; that looks different from the old days of 2002 when I sent hundreds of CVs around, got just two interviews early in the year and silence for the rest. Maybe I'm grown, maybe new positions are coming out, maybe...</p>

<p>Maybe I'll learn new, great things and for some time I'll be definitely happy of what I am doing.</p>

<p>Maybe I'll find so many closed doors that I'll wonder what is keeping me here</p>

<p>Maybe I'll surrender and stay here</p>

<p>Maybe I won't renounce to always improve</p>

<p>Maybe I will be just happy that my child is here (well, he will in the new year) and I won't care if I can't spend that small part of my small spare time for programming in Perl or experiment new things</p>

<p>Maybe I won't stop trying to be useful to other people, even when I think that what I am doing is stupid, or is not enough for anybody.</p>

<p>Maybe I'll discover I really have been useful, and people apreciate what I do, and they are happy, and I'll be happy of that</p>

<p>Maybe, as always, at the end of the new year I won't be able to express that strange sense of happy melancholy that my heart is feeling</p>

<p>Maybe.</p>

<p>Happy new year, everybody</p>

<p>Marco</p></p>
