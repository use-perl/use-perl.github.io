<p>Subversion repository is finally back, and I'm committing things we've been
hacking on in the past two days.  luqui and nothingmuch hacked on reifying the
PIL AST as Perl 6 objects (so we get true macro support for free), and a codegen
written in Perl 6 that takes PIL and emits Perl 5.  Stevan worked on a Perl 5
metamodel that runs Perl 6 roles and classes from Perl 5 space, so we can use
Perl 5 as our host VM (in addition to Parrot and Haskell); nothingmuch further
joked about a PIL codegen that targets Forth (but turns out he was entirely not serious); Patrick implemented
builtin rules for PGE, and put qualified and inheritable+lexical
grammar/subrules support in place.  Ingy worked on his new Perldoc framework
that provides unified, comment-driven, haddock/javadoc-like metadata and
macro-friendly way to generate Kwid and POD and translate between them.  lwall
continued to hack through mad segfaults on PDD/MAD_SKILLS, refactoring Perl 5's
toke.c to be more informative.

<p>
Allison arrived today and we debated for nearly an hour on the implementation
strategy.  This Pugs Hackathon work was focused on having the Perl 6 compiler
written in Perl 6, that translates the parse tree into PIL, then from PIL to
either a Parrot syntax tree that emits PIR, or to Perl 5, Mono or even
Javascript.  However, that means to compile a newer version of Perl 6 compiler,
we need to have an older version of Perl 6 around, first via the non-Parrot
side of Pugs, and then in the form of a Perl6.pbc runtime.  This is just like
how the Mono C# compiler is written in C#, or GCC itself written in C, or how
PyPy is written in Python.

<p>
Allison prefers instead to see the production Perl 6 compiler and related tools to be written
entirely in PIR or other non-Perl6 Parrot languages, so that we can compile any version of
Perl 6 without having access to previous versions of Perl 6, and she suspects
that a parser/compiler/emitter written in PIR would be easier to write and
maintain than the same toolchain written in Perl 6.  The parser and emitter
tools will then be reusable by other languages (eg. PHP) that want to target
Parrot, because PHP folks would prefer to use the compiler suite written in PIR
than one written in either Perl 6 or PHP.  That ties Perl 6 to PIR, but one can
persumably link in libparrot in Mono or JVM to run the PIR code via their
foreign call interface.  This is similar to how the Perl 5 runtime is written
in XS/C, and just like a (hypothetical) Mono-targetting compiler written in the
.NET/IL high-level assembly language.

<p>
Thus, we have two possible implementation strategies that will evolve
separately.  People will, well, use whichever one that actually works. :-)

<p>
Now... revelation time!

<ul>
<li>
To use a perl 5 module, put a <code>perl5:</code> in the front of the module name:
<pre>
  use perl5:DBI;
</pre>
<p>Extending this metaphor, to use a python module:</p>
<pre>
  use python:Zope;
</pre>

<li>
When calling a function, the unary splat <code>*</code> takes an aggregate, or reference
to an aggregate, and flatten them out on the invocation list.  Unary splat on
hash arguments flattens it out as pairs for named bindings; splat on scalars
deref it to find an array/hash reference; for code and
non-reference-to-aggreate scalars it's a no-op.

<li>
<code>&prefix:&lt;int&gt;</code> now always mean the same thing as <code>&int</code>.  In the symbol table 
it's all stored in the ``prefix'' category; &int is just a short name way for
looking it up -- it's just sugar, so you can't rebind it differently.

<li>
Here is a more clarified role hierarchy:
<pre>
  Any | Object  | Item | ...pretty much everything else goes here...
                | Pair
                | Junction
      | int
      | str
      | num
</pre>

<li>
Constrained types in MMD position, as well as value-based MMDs, are <em>not</em>
resolved in the type-distance phase, but compile into a huge given/when
loop that accepts the first alternative.  So this:
<pre>
  multi sub foo (3) { ... }
  multi sub foo (2..10) { ... }
</pre>
<p>really means:</p>
<pre>
  multi sub foo ($x where { $_ ~~ 3 }) { ... }
  multi sub foo ($x where { $_ ~~ 2..10 }) { ... }
</pre>
<p>which compiles two different long names:</p>
<pre>
  # use introspection to get the constraints
  &foo<ANONTYPE_1>
  &foo<ANONTYPE_2>
</pre>
<p>which really means this, which occurs after the type-based MMD tiebreaking
phase:</p>
<pre>
  given $x {
      when 3 { &foo<ANONTYPE_1>.goto }
      when 2..10 { &foo<ANONTYPE_2>.goto }
  }
</pre>
<p>in the type-based phase, any duplicates in MMD is rejected as ambiguous; but
in the value-based phase, the first conforming one wins.</p>

<li>
Closure composers like anonymous <code>sub</code>, <code>class</code> and <code>module</code> always trumps hash dereferences:
<pre>
    sub{...}
    module{...}
    class{...}
</pre>

<li>
The <code>do</code> form is now taking a single statement (that may still be a block); what
it does is turning the statement into an expression form, immediately
evaluating it when the left hand side demands a value.
<pre>
  my $val = do use CGI;   # same as
  my $val = BEGIN { use CGI };

  # This assigns 4 to $foo
  my $foo = do given 3 {
      when 3 { 4 }
  };
</pre>

<li>
A closure form of <code>but</code> is desugared into a <code>do given</code> block that
eliminates the need of returning <code>$_</code> explicitly.  So those two forms
are equivalent:
<pre>
  my $foo = Cls.new but {
      .attr = 1;
  };

  my $foo = do given Cls.new {
      .attr = 1;
      $_;
  };
</pre>

<li>
The anonymous class is allowed to both <code>is</code> and <code>does</code> any class/roles;
it will be composed in compile time into an anonymous (but unique) class,
same way as an anonymous closures remembers its original place of definition:
<pre>
  role Foo {...}
  class Boo is Baz {...}

  (class{ does Foo; is Boo }).new(1);
</pre>

<li>
The <code>is Foo</code> and <code>does Bar</code> declarations inside class body is always
lifted up as class traits and executed at class composition time.

<li>
There's another pseudopackage, <code>OUR::</code> and symbol table form <code>%OUR::</code>
that contains the symbols in your current package namespace.

<li>
<code>trust</code> is lexical: It controls accessor generation for all <code>my</code>, <code>our</code>
and <code>has</code> forms in its scope.  Inside a class body, the <code>my $.x</code> and
<code>our $.x</code> always generates public accessors on the spot:
<pre>
  class Foo {
      trusts Bar; # sees the accessor methods in the scope
      { # some inner scope
          my $.x; # This creates accessors by inserting these two lines
          # die "Duplicate accessor" if %OUR::<&x>;
          # our &x := method () is rw { $.x };

          my $:y; # This create accessors by  inserting these two lines
          # my &:y := method () is rw { $:y };
          # $?SELF.trust_access.push(&:y); # adds to Bar -- $?SELF is class object
      }
      trusts Baz; # this is always an no-op because there's nothing below
  }

  class Pie is Foo { }

  Pie.x = 5;      # lvalue method - writes back to lexical $.x
  say Bar.x;      # 5 - shared by Bar and Pie
</pre>
<p>The twigil <code>.</code> and <code>:</code> controls the generated accessor's scope (<code>our</code>
and <code>my</code> respectively).  The scope of the variable itself is orthogonal
to the accessor.</p>

<li>
In order to pass by read-only reference, we need a way to bind a container into
a new name, but say that it is read-only while the original is read-write.
This is a contradiction, since binding by definition binds a container to two
names.  Still, we have to do it.
<p>In parameter lists, the <code>is constant</code> default trait on parameter variables is
not really acting on their containers; it creates a transparent container on
top of an existing container.  It is ``transparent'' because it autoderef for
everything except for write-type STORE/PUSH/SPLICE methods; all read methods
like FETCH are passed to the underlying container.  Even <code>.ref</code> and <code>.does</code>
calls are passed through to the underlying container, but the <code>.tied</code> call
does get you the wrapped implementation object.</p>
<p>The upshot is that these are now errors:</p>
<pre>
  sub foo ($x) is rw { $x }
  my $a;
  foo($a) = 4;    # runtime error - assign to constant

  sub constref ($x) { \$x }
  my $a;
  my $r = constref($a);
  $$r = 4;        # runtime error - assign to constant
</pre>
<p>To get a normal reference, use the <code>is rw</code> trait on the parameters.</p>
</p>
