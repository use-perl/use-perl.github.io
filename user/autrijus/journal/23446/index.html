<p>It's been a month since I first <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/autrijus/journal/22965">started Pugs</a>. In this month, we have had <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Perl6-Pugs/">9 releases</a>, <a href="https://rt.openfoundry.org/Foundry/Project/Admin/Upload/?Queue=270
OSSF">373 commits</a>, an <a href="http://svn.perl.org/perl6/pugs/trunk/docs/01Overview.html">Apocryphon</a>, and most importantly, a team of <a href="http://pugs.openfoundry.org/">16 committers</a>, even more <a href="http://svn.openfoundry.org/pugs/AUTHORS">contributors</a>,  and many intelligent discussions on <a href="http://colabti.de/irclogger/irclogger_logs/perl6">#perl6</a>, <a href="http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl6.compiler">p6c</a>,  <a href="http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl6.language">p6l</a>,  <a href="http://perlmonks.org/?node_id=433161">PerlMonks</a>, as well as many other places. I'd like to thank all of you for <a href="http://svn.openfoundry.org/pugs/src/Main.hs">building this new ship</a> with me. Also, much kudos for the design team, for continuing this extremely difficult and often thankless task.
<p>
On February 4th, in a private mail to Damian, I said this:
<blockquote>

I'd also like to thank you and other people in the design team, for
bringing the power of Oz and Curry to the masses, in such a nice,
pleasant, humble package.  I did not capture the beauty of Perl6 until
I started implement it, and now I hope I had started sooner.
</blockquote>
<p>
Indeed, as each day of Pugs hacking passes, I became more and more delighted by the wonderful design of Perl 6. Although Pugs (and Perl 6 itself) still has many rough edges, they will pass away gradually, and the <a href="http://wagner.elixus.org/user/autrijus/perl6.png">imaginary timeline</a> will one day become real.
<p>
Today saw a large number of commits. A particular highlight is that, with help from SubEthaEdit, I have collaborated with Ingy to create a Kwid lexer, parser, AST, and compiler (to HTML), all in one hour. In a few days, Kwid will probably become the first haskell-based extension module, which may be dynamically loaded via a DynaLoader-like mechanism.  That will instantly give us a wealth of libraries, including many GUI toolkits like OpenGL, Gtk and WxWindows, which will make writing Real World application in Pugs all the easier.  Other notable commits include:
<ul>
<li>SyntaxNinja's massive -Wall cleanup landed; Pugs is now using a more maintainable and idiomatic Haskell style.
<li>The tireless Stevan added tests for new features in 6.0.9, including ref(), magicals, and more.
<li>metaperl has started documenting the Haskell source files, starting from the <a href="<a href="http://svn.openfoundry.org/pugs/docs/src/Junc.pod">Junction engine</a>. Yay!
<li>duff has committed a new example, the <a href="http://svn.openfoundry.org/pugs/examples/hanoi.p6">hanoi tower solver</a>.
</ul>
<p>
Oh, and tonight I was moved to a better room with high-speed internet access, so I can finally install FreeBSD. Hopefully it will increase my productivity, just in time for recruiting more Pugs hackers in the 48-hours-nonstop CodeFest Asia, which will start in 5 hours from now. See you tomorrow!</p>
