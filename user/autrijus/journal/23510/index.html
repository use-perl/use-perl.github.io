<p>I spent the whole day with nearly 20 friends from <a href="http://www.perlchina.org/">PerlChina</a>, talking mostly about Perl 6 and Pugs, but with a healthy dosage of PAR and my popular <a href="http://wagner.elixus.org/user/autrijus/favcpan/">1% of my favourite CPAN</a> talk as well.
<p>
It seems to me that indeed the confusing syntax of Perl 5 reference vs sigils is a major hurdle here (and indeed the first question asked about Perl 6 was whether it can work in a sigilless fashion for non-English speakers); coupled with the relatively few information of CPAN modules in Chinese, it made Perl a really unpopular choice. Perl 6, Parrot and Pugs are good as future-proofing, but spreading the knowledge of useful CPAN modules like WWW::Mechanize and Inline 
has far more visible benefits.
<p>
For Perl 6, I browsed the official <a href="http://dev.perl.org/perl6/talks/">talks</a> page and failed to find anything in 2005, so I improvised some examples using Pugs's <code>examples/*.p6</code> and <code>Test.pm</code> as starting points. Right after the meeting I discovered Allison's excellent <a href="http://www.lohutok.net/talks/p6update.pdf">Perl 6 Update</a> -- I think it really belongs to the talks page.
<p>
On the code front today, the big news is I've released 6.0.10. Special thanks to Stevan for compiling the <a href="http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl6.compiler/250">ChangeLog</a> entries! Right after the release, luqui committed <code>.kv</code> on hashes, as well as support for <code>foreach</code> that can iterate more than one values at a time; he also implemented adverbal blocks. The last one broke some parsing logic, which I promptly fixed. Our new committers (nothingmuch and scw) are progressing well on learning Haskell with YAHT; they also kept sending test cases for unimplemented features. Thanks folks!
<p>
Two best quotes of the day (slightly paraphrased):
<ul>
<li>&lt;rooneg&gt; I love that all I had to do was post a test for %hash.kv and when I wake up in the morning it's been implemented.
<li>&lt;clsung&gt; Hacking Pugs is a lot of fun, especially during its early days; it feels quite like playing the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Maker">Princess Maker</a> game...
</ul>
<p>
The plane back to Taiwan will take off in 7 hours; I should really sleep now. See you!</p>
