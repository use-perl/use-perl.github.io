<p>Today was all about hacking in the English language.  I started working on the <em>Learning Haskell</em> talk, but ended up getting less than half finished, partly due to hacking the amazing <a href="http://piro.sakura.ne.jp/xul/applications/takahashi/">Takahashi XUL kit</a> and converting the CUFP Pugs talk into that format.

<p>
You can take a look at my <a href="http://perlcabal.org/user/autrijus/tmp/haskell.xul">work in progress</a>; note that the code snippets are not in preformatted layouts as they should be.  But try to "view source" and move the mouse cursor on top of the canvas -- you'll be positively surprised.

<p>
45 minutes is not anywhere enough to get people acquainted with <em>both</em> Haskell's syntax and practical uses, so the slides are very concise.  Suggestions welcome!

<p>
On the lightning talk front, I collaborated with Allison over <a href="http://www.codingmonkeys.de/subethaedit/">SubEthaEdit</a>, as the <a href="http://gobby.0x539.de/">Gobby</a> site still does not offer a OSX binary package.  We adapted the first two stanzas, reviewed another four, and left the remaining six untouched.  The text is in the pugs tree as <a href="http://svn.openfoundry.org/pugs/docs/talks/larry_mariner.txt">docs/talks/larry_mariner.txt</a>.  Making an epic-esque poem of Perl is quite challenging; it would be impossible without Allison's strong poetic cluefulness.  But we still need much help from fellow wordsmiths...

<p>
After Euro OSCON, I'll be in Stockholm for <a href="http://conferences.yapceurope.org/npw2005/">Nordic Perl Workshop</a>.  A month after that, I'll be in Australia for <a href="http://www.osdc.com.au/">OSDC 2005</a>, hopefully finding some time to work with Damian, as well as visiting <a href="http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/user/dons/">dons</a> (of hs-plugins/yi fame) in Sydney.

<p>
Hmm, it's well past 5am, so no changelogging for today...  See you tomorrow!

<h2>greet greet?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/luqui/">luqui</a> on 2005-10-13T13:43:55</h3>
About half way through:<blockquote> <div><tt>&nbsp; &nbsp; greet x = "Hello " ++ x<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; main&nbsp; &nbsp; = print (greet greet)</tt></div> </blockquote>(assuming you did mean the "main =" part).  This looks like a type error to me (can't unify [Char] with (a -&gt; b)).<br><br>Nice, introduce GADT (without its scary name) right off the bat.  Pretend like it's always been there.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br><br>You probably want more examples for the pattern matching stuff.  You showed one example for each WTDI, but if you're really trying to teach it, you probably need more.  Come to think of it, if you're really trying to teach it, you should get people to open up ghci at the beginning of your talk.<br><br>Looks good so far.  Get people hooked!<br>

<li>Yes, it's an error and is updated to say such. Thanks.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</li>
<li>Indeed, but with 45min I can only try to make people not freak out.</li>
<li>Thanks!</li>

<h2>Takahashi XUL kit</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/slanning/">slanning</a> on 2005-10-13T13:46:04</h3>
That's really slick. Looks like a good example
to learn XUL from. From reading it a little,
it turns out that Takahashi is the name of the
presentation method, not the author of the kit.
Also, I was confused at first on the page you
linked to; it seems you want to download
the two links called <a href="http://piro.sakura.ne.jp/xul/applications/takahashi/takahashi.xul" title="sakura.ne.jp">takahashi.xul</a sakura.ne.jp> and <a href="http://piro.sakura.ne.jp/xul/applications/takahashi/takahashi.css" title="sakura.ne.jp">takahashi.css</a sakura.ne.jp> (scroll down a little).
