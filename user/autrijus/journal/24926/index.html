<p>I'm surprised and delighted to see lathos porting his Maypole framework to Perl 6:

<pre>
<lathos> I'm actually *really* enjoying porting Maypole to Perl 6. SO much cleaner.
</pre>

<p>
I relayed this news to #catalyst, only to discover that sri has already beginning a Perl 6 of Catalyst.  I happily sent commitership invitation mails to both of them; it is an honour to have two such illustrious hackers on board.

<p>
Another big news today is iblech's evalbot.p6, an IRC bot providing <code>?eval</code> command for all <code>#perl6</code> folks to try out Perl 6 code with.  To protect against <code>system(<rm -rf>)</code>, a <em>safe mode</em> is implemented to disable all IO primitives, when Pugs is started with a true value in the PUGS_SAFEMODE environment variable.  The evalbot has already proven to be a very useful quick-checking tool during language discussions; iblech++ for getting it written!

<p>
iblech also added the <code>$?PUGS_VERSION</code> special variable to represent the revision number of Pugs.

<p>
eric256 and his wizard.p6 continued to drive more development:
<ul>
<li><code>.attr = 1</code> is no longer parsed as <code>$_.attr(=1)</code>.
<li><code>use lib '/path';</code> now works correctly by calling <code>::lib.import('/path')</code>.
<li><code>when .does(Foo)</code>, <code>when $_.does(Foo)</code> and <code>when Foo</code> are all implemented now.
</ul>

<p>
Some more work on the Pugs/Perl5 embedding front:
<ul>
<li>Perl 5 can now invoke Pugs objects as well as closures.
<li>Chained method application like <code>DBI.connect($x).do($y)</code> now works properly.
<li>Tweaks on C compiler flags handling to make it compile on even more platforms -- as long as GHC and Perl was built with the same C compiler.
</ul>

<p>
broquaint wondered why <code>$str.split(//)</code> was parsed as <code>split($str, //)</code>. I fixed that specific case, but <code>$x.split($y)</code> still does not mean <code>split($y, $x)</code> yet; broquaint added various tests for them.  Also at broquaint's request, iblech implemented <code>&getc</code>.

<p>
iblech added some information about using the Compose key under X11 to enter special characters.  I followed the instruction with the Menu key, but it had no effect at all.  Strange...

<p>
Aankhen ported HTTP::Headers::Util from Perl 5, along with its unit tests.

<p>
SamB started working on Pugs.Compile.Pugs to produce more readable output code. 

<p>
hcchien, our Taipei.pm leader and one the first committers, returned to Pugs today and implemented a input method driver for lukhnos's <a href="http://openvanilla.org/?English">OpenVanilla</a> framework.  He remarked that Pugs is not yet fast enough for a real-time imput method.  This will likely change next week when I started working with Leo...

<p>
There have been a flurry of commits on util/perl6.vim syntax file from iblech, ninereasons, scw and me. With the improved highlighting, it's now much easier to edit OO modules in Perl 6.

<p>
That's it for today.  See you tomorrow!
