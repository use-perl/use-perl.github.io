<h1>Day 92: New PGE released; Pugs now embeds Parrot!</h1>

<div class="span8">
<p>I'll start with a fresh quote from #perl6:

<blockquote><tt>
* Limbic_Region patiently waits for a "the most productive day in Pugs yet...." journal entry
</tt></blockquote>

<p>
But, indeed, today is a quite important day to the Perl 6 project.  Two announcements happened within the same hour:

<ul>
<li>Patrick announced <a href="http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl6.compiler/685">a new release of PGE</a>, the Perl 6 Rules Grammar Engine, now entirely written in Parrot PIR, and generates PIR code.
<li>Shortly after, I announced that <a href="http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl6.compiler/686">Pugs can now embed Parrot</a>.
</ul>

<p>
Taken together, this not only means Pugs can call PGE natively, but also that we no longer need <code>pugscc</code> to compiler Perl 6 to IMC code anymore; Pugs will soon be able to turn Perl 6 into IMC in memory, feed it into the embedded Parrot, which will run it in blazing JIT speed.  Jeff Horwitz, mod_parrot leader and new lambdafolk, is working on getting all this Just Right.

<p>
Oh, and there is news #3.  I pointed Leo to <a href="http://repetae.net/john/computer/jhc/">Jhc</a>, a Haskell compiler.  <a href="http://repetae.net/john/computer/jhc/jhc.html">Grin</a>, the low-level intermediate language it uses, is very simple, and a Grin to C compiler is merely <a href="http://repetae.net/john/repos/jhc/C/FromGrin.hs">300 lines</a>. I think it would be relatively straightforward to create a Grin to Parrot compiler (or even a Grin to Perl 6 compiler), which would make Pugs itself -- indeed, an entire Haskell compiler -- run on Parrot.  We will probably spend some time, during the two-week hackathon time after the Austrian Perl Workshop, to look into this.

<p>
There are lots of other developments today, as usual:

<ul>
<li>I started <code>$real_work</code> in Perl 5 today, but I can't stop but noticing the <code>my ($x, undef, $y) = 1..3;</code> idiom, which was not supported in Pugs.  So now Pugs supprots undef in LHS lists.
<li>Stevan checked in a <a href="http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl6.compiler/682">new TODO model</a> for Pugs, so we can mark our TODO tests with different categories, and have them counted and reported by Harness, instead of grouped under the <code>various reasons</code> umbrella.  Now I just need them to show up in different shades of colours in <code>smoke.html</code>...
<li>Following that change, iblech marked our <code>:todo</code> tests in <code>t/oo/</code> as <code>:todo&lt;feature&gt;</code> tests.
<li>I inquired about <a href="http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl6.language/20771">Perl 6 type systems</a> on p6l; Larry gave some <a href="http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl6.language/20780">sensible answers</a>, followed by Thomas SandlaÃÅ¸'s <a href="http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl6.language/20789">scary answers</a>.
<li>theorbtwo laboured to add function signature declarations to Parser and Lexer, resulting in much nicer Haddock output.
<li>scook0 continues to add Haddock API comments to Eval, AST and Types, which (as usual) prompted me to rename the <code>Junc</code> constructor into the more consistent <code>MkJunc</code>.
<li>With one line of code, I implemented <code>state $x</code> support, which is like Perl 5's old <code>my $x if 0</code>, but this one works sanely. :-)
<li>Limbic_Region promptly submitted a closure-based <a href="http://svn.openfoundry.org/pugs/examples/cashiers.p6">OO implementation</a> using <code>state</code> as class variables, and <code>my</code> as instance variables.  iblech then proceeded to decorate it with helpful comments.
<li>iblech also added tests to <code>map</code>, topicalization, and add
<li>putter tried to build Pugs on x86_64 but failed; after some discussion in #haskell, a workaround was found and added to README.
<li>ninereasons added some failing tests to exercise Pugs's <code>pairs</code> behaviour. 
</ul>

<p>
Whew, that's a lot for one day.  Oh, and finally, another good news: I don't need to struggle to derive a transformer from SPJ et all's subcontinuation paper anymore, because Oleg Kiselyov et all has just finished it, and they generously agreed to let Pugs use their <a href="http://svn.openfoundry.org/pugs/src/Pugs/Cont/CC_2CPST.hs">CC_2CPST</a> module freely.  Many thanks to these scintilatting lambdafolks for sharing their wizardry!

<h2>Why a Haskell compiler on parrot?</h2>

For those of us standing back at a safe distance,<br> <br>Why pursue a Haskell compiler that runs on Parrot?

Hmm, it is desirable to <em>run</em> Haskell on Parrot, by compiling Haskell to PIR; this will allow Pugs itself, as well as many interesting Haskell applications, be shared natively with other languages running on Parrot.
<p>
The fact that we will, by definition, get a self-hosting Haskell compiler running on Parrot, is just a nice bonus.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>
