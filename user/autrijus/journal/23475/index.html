<p>My productivity on Pugs has been seriously reduced today, due to my participation in the AOSS conference.  Learned lots of interesting things, in particular I'm sold to <a href="http://xliff-tools.freedesktop.org/">XLIFF</a> by my friend Hideki Hiura san.  I have also spread the word of Pugs and the extraordinary productivity boost of Haskell to several people, inciting excited responses and hopefully a few new volunteers.
<p>
So, my only commits today has been little cleanups for Pretty printer to print Sym and App more happily, and allow <code>&lt;</code> to mean ReadMode in <code>open()</code>. Also I installed GHC 6.4 prerelease, and ported Pugs to it.  I'm excited by more complete Posix support on Win32, together with much faster Data.Map implementation, and even more nifty automagic parallelizable code compilation support. However, I intend to still support GHC 6.2 in the forseeable future.
<p>
While I was occupied, other committers kept the commits busy as usual:
<ul>
<li>Stevan added tests for the elusive double-evaluation bug. Actually, he also added lots of other tests, which pretty much covers all new features 6.0.9 and TODOs for 6.0.10. You rock, Stevan!
<li>ingy transcribed the introduction chapter of <a href="http://www.isi.edu/user/hdaume/htut/">YAHT</a> to <a href="http://svn.perl.org/perl6/pugs/trunk/docs/yaht.kwid">Kwid format</a>, and continued working on the <code>ext/</code> system.
<li>On the <a href="http://svn.perl.org/perl6/pugs/trunk/src/Pretty.hs">Galadriel</a> front, nnunley worked some more on Pretty-printing for strings.
<li>metaperl, continuing his question to get the source tree <a href="http://svn.perl.org/perl6/pugs/trunk/docs/src/">documented</a>, hacked on a Haskell-side test module of Junc.hs, as well as better documentation in Junc.pod. I'm amazed how much he have figured out, all by himself, in a few days.
<li>nothingmuch donated to my <a href="http://par.perl.org/">paypal account</a>, and also volunteered to write tests for the upcoming try/catch/throw functions. Thanks a lot, bro! :)
<li>Last but not the least, scw checked in <code>$junction.pick</code> support, in particular for <code>any()</code> junctions.
</ul>
<p>
The more exciting thing in AOSS is that there is probably going to be a CodeFest every 6 month, coinciding with AOSS itself; also various asian country's software repositories are conspiring to have an unified portal interface (sort of like "planet foundries"). Lots of interesting developments, and lots of interesting people. See you tomorrow! :-)</p>
