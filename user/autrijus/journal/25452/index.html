<p>During my YAPC talk, I commented that the past five months feels like five really long
days to me -- I kept the Reality window firmly minimised; Pugs virtually
occupied all my waking moments, if not totally, at least in part.  Even my dreams are
populated with syntax trees, code generators, and runtime dispatch algorithms.
<p>
This month especially feels like a really long day, constantly interacting with
some of the most interesting people I know, with no much room left for rest --
I'm glad I have the window of one-day sleep through tomorrow, before I fly back
to Taipei and have to face $jet_lag and $work again. :-)
<p>
This afternoon I had some really good talk with cwest about his <a
href="http://openjsan.org/">JavaScript Archive Network</a> ideas, and his
ongoing quest to expand the Perl community's norms -- the culture that
let us fill in practical utilities in all possible gaps, with brutal
efficiency -- to areas beyond the current CPAN.  We also talked at
length about compiling Javascript to PIL and PIL to Javascript, and the
benefits of using one single well-defined vocabulary for database, server-side
logic and client-side scripting.  The idea is similar to <a
href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/">Wadler</a>'s Links project,
but with a vast body of CPAN-rooted norms (eg. DBI, DateTime, Test::*,
LWP/Mechanize, etc.), so maybe we will have a better chance of adoption
when the technology becomes available.
<p>
Btw, my set of <a href="http://perlcabal.org/user/autrijus/t.tgz">Test::Base demos</a>
for <a href="http://yapc.kwiki.org/data-driven-testing/slide1.html">ingy's
talk</a> is online.  I think the Test::Base methodology (a natural extension
to Cunningham's <a href="http://fit.c2.com/">FIT</a>) is sound, and I look forward
to bring it to Perl6 as well as adding a specification-based generator interface
(ala <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Test-LectroTest/">Test::LectroTest</a>,
<a href="http://www.cs.chalmers.se/user/rjmh/QuickCheck/">QuickCheck</a>) to it.
<p>
...I see that chromatic, stevan and nothingmuch are still hacking madly when
I'm writing this, but now I have to sink back into blissful sleep again...
