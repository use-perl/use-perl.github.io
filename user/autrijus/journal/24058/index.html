<p>Today is a day of wonderful Hackathon news: Chip the fearless Parrot leader plans to visit Austria,
working with Leo the mad Parrot pumpking and yours truly for some serious
Pugs/Parrot hacking.  Please let me know if you are planning to hack with us
during or after the Austrian Perl Workshop.
<p>
The YAPC::NA hackthon is also gathering people: Patrick the PGE mastermind
and p6c head will probably be there, as well as our scintillating Stevan.
Please inform the host/organizer <a
href="http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl6.compiler/514">John
Macdonald</a> if you are going, as the space is limited to ~12 people. <b>Update:</b> Breaking news: Larry Wall and Luke Palmer are also coming. Wow.
<p>
Following yesterday's suggestion of translating <a href="http://pleac.sourceforge.net/">pleac</a> for Pugs, kungfuftr reported today that he had a chat with Randal Schwartz about porting <a href="http://examples.oreilly.com/lperl3/">code examples</a> from <em>Learning Perl</em> to Pugs; apparently there's nothing stopping us from doing it, so volunteers welcome!
<p>
Stevan had this great idea of compiling a reading list for Pugs hackers, and I suggested <a href="http://svn.openfoundry.org/pugs/READTHEM">READTHEM</a> as the file name.  Feel free to add relevant things to it...
<p>
On the code front, theorbtwo reported after his diving into DynamicLoader,
concluding that the now-LGPL-licensed <a href="http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/user/dons/hs-plugins/">hs-plugins</a> is really the way forward on inlining Haskell and C code.
<p>
Also, ninereasons reported that <code>my ($a, @b) = (1,2,3)</code> is broken, with <code>@b</code> getting <code>(2)</code> while it should get <code>(2,3)</code>. shapr kindly gave a nice <a href="http://colabti.de/irclogger/irclogger_log/perl6?date=2005-04-07,Thu&sel=857#l1240">Eval.hs walk through</a>, which proved effective:

<pre>
02:16 <ninereasons> assume I know nothing, and you'll be very close to the truth.
...
02:20 <ninereasons> omg, i think I actually understand
</pre>

<p>
I dived into multidim, first by refactoring the <code>VArray</code> type into the much faster (and more accurate) <code>IntMap</code> type, dropping the <code>MkArray</code> newtype prefix along with <code>MkHash</code>.  However, $work took hold and I did not find enough time to complete the IType refactoring; will resume tomorrow.
<p>
iblech implemented the <code>pi()</code> primitive, conveniently using the same-named Haskell primitive.  He also added tests for <code>$*OS</code>, followed shortly by corion's test cleanup and backlinking efforts, and tobez's work on <code>uc/lc</code> tests.
<p>
The amazingly addictive <code>hangman.p6</code> received love from five Pugs hackers (stevan, theorbtwo, ninereasons, iblech and me), making it the most popular example code to date.  It also prompted more work on <code>File::Spec</code> and <code>lib.pm</code>.
<p>
Finally, just to make my life easier tomorrow morning, Stevan added even more multi dimensional structure tests, so I can get things <em>Just Right</em>. Hurray for test-driven development!
<p>
On a final note, a new version of <a href="http://svn.perl.org/perl6/doc/trunk/plans/design_docs.pod">Perl 6 Design Documents Roadmap</a> is online, with a section on "candiates for delegation" -- and that means <em>us</em>, folks! :-)
