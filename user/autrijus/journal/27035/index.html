<p>geoffb fulfilled his promise and delivered a nice <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/7996">write-up</a> of yesterday's #perl6 discussion.  The immediate reaction:
<blockquote><tt>
&lt;autrijus&gt; geoffb: I feel... a bit embarrased I guess, but very grateful for the writeup. it's excellent.<br>
&lt;geoffb&gt; thanks<br>
&lt;autrijus&gt; geoffb++<br>
&lt;geoffb&gt; I had a choice to make you anonymous or not, I decided that people just plain like celebrities.  :-)<br>
&lt;leo__&gt; geoffb++<br>
&lt;geoffb&gt; thanks for the kind words<br>
&lt;autrijus&gt; geoffb: hence, the embarrasment
</tt></blockquote>

<p>
It is an excellent summary.  However, I'd like to stress that <em>none</em> of those are designed upfront; indeed, I didn't set out to do anything more than modelling junctions.  As geoffb said, everything else were spotaneously derived from optimizing for fun.

<p>
In other weblog news, why the lucky stiff <a href="http://redhanded.hobix.com/inspect/pugsAndEigenclassesYessirThisSatireSGotLegs.html">immediately noticed</a> that we did, in fact, steal the <em>eigenclasses</em> -- which is I suspect that he was aiming for all along, with all those hypnotising <a href="http://redhanded.hobix.com/cult/theLeastSurprised2CodingAtVanishingPoint.html">Least Surprised</a> comic strips.  So: well done!

<p>
With gallant help from gaal, we brought the failing subtests down to less than 200 -- one more day's work and it'd be releasable.  Several weird bugs got fixed today, including the one that rendered <a href="http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl6.language/23340"><code>say {1}.()</code></a> into <code>(say{1}).()</code>.  Oops.

<p>
Also, the Perl5 and JS backend generators are now installed with Pugs, so <code>pugs -BPerl5</code> and <code>pugs -BJS</code> should run in the PxPerl binaries for 6.2.10, in addition to the PIR backend.  I'm glad to see that the two stand-alone backends are in a good shape to become the highlight of this release.

<p>
Gaal also made all I/O errors catchable with <code>try{}</code>, thanks to a new<code>guardIO</code> lifter that promotes IO errors into <code>fail</code> in the Eval monad.

<p>
Tomorrow will be mostly about tidying up for the release.  geoffb updated the <a href="http://svn.openfoundry.org/pugs/STATUS">STATUS</a> file extensively, so that leaves some changelogging and cabalization.

<p>
Oh, and an unfortunate news: TSa <a href="http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl6.language/23346">bowed out</a> from the p6l mailing list, ironically at the same time as I refined the 6.2831 milestone into <em>Type system and linking</em>.  I'm grateful to him for keeping up discussions about types, as well as referring me to various useful papers.  Hopefully we'd indeed make Perl 6 the <em>artige Sprache</em> -- language of kindness -- as he wishes.

<p>
See you tomorrow! :)
