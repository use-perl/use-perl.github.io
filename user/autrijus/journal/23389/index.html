<p>Today I completed the first installment of the Pugs Apocrypha -- <a href="http://svn.perl.org/perl6/pugs/trunk/docs/01Overview.html">Pugs Apocryphon 1: Overview of the Pugs project</a>. If you are still wondering what Pugs was about, please read that document first. :-) Many thanks to people who have contributed questions; I have postponed the more technical ones to the next Apocryphon.
<p>
In this Apocryphon, I have stated my decision of not submitting a TPF grant for Pugs. Although Ingy mentioned some <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/ingy/journal/23384">psychological factors</a>, the real reason is that I think it would be more helpful to donate time to the Perl 6 project by hacking Pugs, rather than asking TPF for money to do the same thing.
<p>
So with Apocryphon out, I will finally get some time to hack Pugs code during my stay in Beijing for <a href="http://www.asia-oss.org/march2005/overview.html">AOSS</a>, between Feb 27th and Mar 6th. During that week, I'll also talk with perlchina folks about hcchien's initiative to <a href="http://svn.openfoundry.org/p6l10n/">translate Perl 6 documnents</a> into various languages, as well as try to get more people to try out Pugs.
<p>
In other news, we have two more committers on board. viirya was the one who sent the first patch to pugs; after 3 days of work, he finally tracked down the hideously silly bug that caused <code>undef(0)</code> to be treated as nullary, and we promptly fixed that problem. Much kudo for his persistence.
<p>
Another committer is Luke Palmer (luqui), who threatened to implement Rules in Parsec, so he can use it to parse Perl 6 and rewrite Pugs in Perl 6. On his first day into learning Haskell, he made good on his threat by implementing qq[] with matching brackets, string interpolation and hash subscripting in the Pugs parser.  Wow.
<p>
Stevan, bsmith and duff continues to polish the test suite, bringing the total number of tests up to an impressive 437 in a couple days. nnunley committed a particuarly nifty <a href="http://svn.openfoundry.org/pugs/examples/sendmoremoney.p6">send+more=money</a> solver into the examples/ directory, showcasing the use of junctions in Perl 6.  It doesn't run yet, but will be soon.
<p>
Jesse Vincent (obra) plays the <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/jesse/journal/23290">junior Perl 6 manager role</a> pretty well: at his suggesion, I have moved tests for &?CALLER_CONTINUATION, a speculative implementation of escape continuations not found in Synopses, into a new t/unspecced/ directory. The idea is everything else in t/ and Perl6/lib/ can then be trivially shared between different Perl 6 implementations.
<p>
As I'd like to release 6.0.9 before I fly to Beijing, tomorrow I'll try to get all examples/ running, implement multidimensional (and hopefully sliced) array assignment needed for is_deeply(), and cut a release. Let's hope it go well. :-)
<p>
Oh, and I'm thrilled that <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/ziggy/journal/23379">ziggy</a> is finding a use for Parsec on parsing domain-specific languages. It's nice to see Haskell improving camelfolk's lives. It's not only one direction, though. #perl6 is already talking about improving GHC's tool chain by writing a <a href="http://wagner.elixus.org/user/clkao/svk-cover/">code coverage</a> tool, based on pjcj's excellent <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Devel-Cover/">Devel::Cover</a> module, so we can identify untested conders in Pugs. 'Tsall good. :-)</p>
