<p>I mentioned yesterday that hyperoperators are coming soon.  As expected, today
iblech and I hacked them in.  Now all prefix, infix and postfix operators have
hyper forms, regardless of whether they are user-defined or builtin:

<pre>
pugs> (1,2,3) >>-<< (4,5,6)
(-3, -3, -3)
pugs> -<< (4,5,6)
(-4, -5, -6)
pugs> sub postfix:<!> { [*] 1..$_ }; (4, 5, 6) >>!
(24, 120, 720)
</pre>

But it gets scarier when you mix hyper metaoperator with reduce metaoperators:

<pre>
pugs> [+]<< ([1,2], [3,4]);
(3, 7)
pugs> [+]<<<< ([[1,2], [3,4]], [[5,6], [7,8]])
((3, 7), (11, 15))
</pre>

<p>
iblech implemented <code>FIRST {...}</code> with trailing <code>undef</code>, <code>INIT {...}</code>, and <code>CHECK {...}</code>.  Together with the existing support for <code>BEGIN {...}</code> and <code>END {...}</code>, we have a pretty good coverage of global closure traits now.  Next in sight would be things like <code>PRE</code> and <code>POST</code>...

<p>
clkao is working on Benchmark.pm, which really wants <code>times()</code> support.  I walked him through the implementation and testing in 30 minutes; Corion then ported the underlying <code>getProcessTimes</code> Haskell function to Win32.

<p>
clkao tweaked <code>cmp_ok()</code> from Test.pm to show the name of the comparison operator used. I hacked in <code>&code.name</code> to support this, as well as <code>&code.arity</code>.

<p>
Juerd added <a href="http://svn.openfoundry.org/pugs/docs/quickref/reduction">quickref/reduction</a> for reduction metaoperators, and iblech contributed some more examples to it.

<p>
Backtrace in error messages is now much more legible:

<pre>
$ ./pugs -e 'sub{ sub {die "Error!"}.() }.()'
*** Error!
    at -e line 1, column 1-32
       -e line 1, column 6-28
       -e line 1, column 11-23
</pre>

<p>
iblech added the ability of dumping raw AST structure to the interactive shell.  Following that, I reorganised all commands in the shell to being with <code>:</code>.  Hopefully this will eliminate the confusing situation of <code>!1</code> evaluating to <code>1</code> in the shell.

<p>
Stevan continued to study metaclass koans, aiming for grokking the inner working of Perl 6's OO model.  He recorded his current understanding in the <a href="http://svn.openfoundry.org/pugs/ext/Perl-MetaModel/docs/perl6_meta_meta_class_hierarchy.pod">Perl 6 Meta Meta Class Hierarchy</a> document.

<p>
Also in the metamodel front, mugwump updated <a href="http://svn.openfoundry.org/pugs/ext/Perl-MetaModel/docs/perl6_meta_model.pod">Perl 6 Meta Model</a> with the latest insights.

<p>
asavige added some precedence tests, more todo tests to assign, and reported that <code>1..Inf</code> as parsed as <code>&.Inf(1)</code>.  I fixed it a while later.

<p>
I also implemented the three "yada" literals: <code>???</code> that warns, <code>!!!</code> that dies, and <code>...</code> that fails -- i.e. dies when <code>use fatal</code> is in effect, otherwise return a delayed error that dies when actually evaluated.

<p>
gaal added missing signatures for the Win32-specific parts of source code.  With this, Haddock will finally recognise all our toplevel functions.

<p>
knewt, our new committer, made the backend part in command line parsing case-insensitive, so <code>pugs -Bparrot</code> will also work.

<p>
Aankhen added support for stringifying cookies to CGI.pm, un-evalled passing OO tests, and cleaned up operator_overloading.t.

<p>
adehohum added many tests, ranging from OO, syntax, operators to rules. scook0 also added tests for exclusive-range operators.

<p>
eric256 improved the wizard.p6 game by adding rooms and more enemies -- it seems that the player doesn't stand a chance against the Skeleton -- but curiously, fleeing from the room made the enemy disappear.  This bug would probably not last for long...
