<h1>Day 107: Inline::Pugs!  Infix operator!</h1>

An one-hour hack of mine proved fruitful.  Below is a Perl 5 script, calling into Perl 6 functions:

<pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl
use Inline Pugs => '
    sub postfix:<!> { [*] 1..$_ }
    sub sum_factorial { [+] 0..$_! }
';
print sum_factorial(3); # 21
</pre>

<p>
The implementation is in the Pugs tree as
<a href="http://svn.openfoundry.org/pugs/lib/Inline/Pugs.pm">lib/Inline/Pugs.pm</a>; you wil need <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Inline/">Inline.pm</a> from CPAN to run the example above.

<p>
Another big news is that iblech hacked in user-defined infix operators.  He started a <a href="http://svn.openfoundry.org/pugs/ext/fp/lib/fp.pm">fp.pm</a> to showcase all the APLish things we can do with infix Unicode OPs.  But my favourite sickitude is this faked list comprehension:

<blockquote><tt>
# This prints "3 9 15 21 27"<br>
say [ {$_ * 3} | $_ &lt;- [1 .. 10],:{ $_ % 2 } ]<br>
<br>
# ...and here are the magic bits...<br>
sub infix:ÃÂ«|ÃÂ»  ($x, $y) { $x }<br>
sub infix:ÃÂ«,:ÃÂ» ($x, &y) { [grep &y, $x] }<br>
sub infix:ÃÂ«&lt;-ÃÂ» (&x, @y) { map &x, @y }<br>
</tt></blockquote>
<p>
mugwump and iblech applied this to <a href="http://svn.openfoundry.org/pugs/ext/Set/lib/Set.pm">Set.pm</a>, which overloads various ASCII operators, as well as the &#8745;, &#8746; and &#8715; Unicode operators.

<p>
Seeing how PA02 has been delayed (again), nothingmuch interviewed me for a couple hours about Pugs interals, so he can start writing it.  We covered Parser, Eval, ITypes and some Object core today -- more to follow later!

<p>
iblech also hacked in preliminary support for auto-generating <code>[...]</code> (reduce metaoperators); support for <code>ÃÂ»...ÃÂ«</code> (hyperoperators) should be coming soon as well.

<p>
putter reported that external PGE's match fails when the string to match contain a newline; it turns out to be a problem involving Parrot's line buffering.  I fixed it using a hand-rolled escape scheme; however, I learned from matt in #parrot that <code>stdin."setbuf"(0)</code> will probably also fix it.

<p>
Corion reported that Win32's <code>system($cmd, @args)</code> quoting had similar problems with Perl 5; he committed some basic test for it and starts thinking of a better plan to fix it.

<p>
bsmith discovered a pugsbug that parses <code>(1) { 2 }</code> as <code>(1).{2}</code>, and wrote  tests for it.

<p>
Stevan and mugwump continued MetaModel work, adding findMethod, invokeMethod, isPropertySupported and various other features.  Most of them even comes with tests!
<p> ninereasons fiddled with <a href="http://svn.openfoundry.org/pugs/examples/advocacy/motd.p6">motd.p6</a> to generate a more sentence-like fragment, and tidied up its code.

<p> theorbtwo committing another 100ish lines of changes, adding signatures and Haddocks to many Pugs internal modules.

<p> putter did tons of work on the Rules tests imported from Perl6::Rules, cleaning up obsolete syntax and ensure that things pass both for external and embedded Parrot.  Lots of bugs were shaken out and fixed.

<p>
I think that's all for today.  See you tomorrow!
