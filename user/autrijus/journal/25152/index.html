<div class="span8">
<p>iblech just <a href="http://m19s28.vlinux.de/iblech/pugs-macros.patch">implemented</a> rudimentary macro support in Pugs.
<pre>
pugs> macro test ($x) { say "macro"; "100$x" }
pugs> say 2; test 3
2
macro
'1003'
</pre>
As seen on #perl6:
<pre>
22:53 < nothingmuch> my god, you go for 10 minutes, and pugs gets macros
00:11  * putter thinks "macros !?!" O.O ;)
00:12 < iblech> Yeah, and the tests pass! :)
</pre>
<p>
In other news I submitted <a href="http://perlcabal.org/user/autrijus/hw2005.pdf">hw2005.pdf</a> (<a href="http://perlcabal.org/user/autrijus/hw2005.tex">tex</a>,
<a href="http://perlcabal.org/user/autrijus/hw2005.ps">ps</a>),
 two hours before the extended deadline.  Sadly I don't fully grok how BibTeX works yet, so it's missing references; also many unfinished paragraphs in the final section and conclusions are mercilessly cut out.  I'll see if can still fill in tomorrow.
<p>
...except putter just offered to do all the bibtexing for me.  putter++ jens++ iblech++ leo++ for getting my paper in shape just when I'm about to give up all hope.
<p>
Great progress at hackathon too.  We figured out:
<ul>
<li>Compilation strategy of PugsExp-&gt;PugsAST-&gt;PIR-&gt;PBC (a small part of it is in the paper; more is written on the whiteboard scratchpad thing here.)
<li>Leo wrote down some notes in perlcabal.org:~lt/docs/STM.txt that talks about how to implement STM in Parrot.
<li>I also got to the end of the serialised interpreter context -- that is to say continuation -- implementation problem; it's basically the same problem Pugs faces when reifying the interpreter states, so we have a pretty good chance of sharing the solutions -- that's section 5.3 in my paper.
<li>We started to review and purge misleading PDDs.  Lots of things gets excised, rewritten, and generally improved to stay up to date with the current code.
<li>How to support for runtime-added attributes for ParrotObjects, that can be shared among PythonObject and Pugs's VObject interfaces.
</ul>
<p>
nothingmuch's <a href="http://perlcabal.org/user/nothingmuch/harrorth/doc/">Harrorth journal</a> is very helpful -- Leo mentioned it's the first Haskell text that actually makes sense to him.
<p>
Oh, and #parrot now has a commit bot, svnbot6, that is, of course, powered by Pugs.  I look forward to compile it to PBC. :-)
<p>
Check <a href="http://perlcabal.org/user/chip/Chip_APW.sxi">Chip's APW presentation slides</a> (<a href="http://perlcabal.org/user/autrijus/chip_apw.pdf">pdf</a>) too. I think it's a much needed attempt at at least some underpromising, and the refocus on PIR level stability for compiler authors is certainly a welcome change.
<p>
There's also extensive discussions on generational GC, unifying PMC interface with ParrotObject, and unifying ParrotString with PMCs, etc.  Lots of handwritings covered several large scratch papers -- expect more tomorrow when I actually get to code!
