<div class="span8">
<p>It has been two months since I first <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/autrijus/journal/22965">started Pugs</a>.  Compared to one month ago, we have 53 committers (was 16), 1395 commits (was 373), and a new roadmap that more closely align us with the Parrot project.  As Nicholas had put it in the <a href="http://www.parrotcode.org/faq/">Parrot FAQ</a>:
<p>
<blockquote>
Pugs will probably be the compiler that first compiles the ultimate Perl 6 compiler, but thereafter Pugs will no longer be the primary reference implementation.
</blockquote>
<p>
However, I think this "ultimate Perl 6 compiler" will start off as a simple (even mechanical) translation from Pugs's Haskell code to Perl 6, just to guarantee its correctness.  That may or may not come to pass.  We'll see. :-)
<p>
Today the Hualian gang keeps churning out amazing breakthroughs that read like April Fools day's joke, but are actually all real:
<ul>
<li>clkao <a href="http://rt.openfoundry.org/Foundry/Project/Forum/List.html/wws/arc/svk-dev/2005-04/msg00003.html">implemented</a> the basics of darcs <a href="http://abridgegame.org/darcs/manual/node8.html">patch dependency calculation algorithm</a> in <a href="http://svk.elixus.org/">svk</a>, in a O(n) fashion which is much faster than darcs!
<li>acme <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/acme/journal/23967">wrote</a> a new <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Devel-ebug/">perl debugger</a>, complete with a web interface that lets you step and watch things from a browser!
<li>obra prototyped <a href="http://svn.bestpractical.com/cgi-bin/index.cgi/bps/browse/experiments/Bamboo/">Bamboo</a>, a meta-MVC toolkit that works as a plugin to any MVC frameworks, and we completed a minimal application in it. It's hard to describe Bamboo, other than saying it's a cross between <a href="http://api.rubyonrails.com/?u=ap.rubyonrails.com">RoR ActionPack</a> and <a href="http://cocoon.apache.org/2.1/userdocs/flow/continuations.html">Cocoon FlowScript</a>. I have high hopes on it taking over the world, maybe starting by implementing it in Pugs...
<li>ingy designed <a href="http://yapc.kwiki.org/taipei/index.cgi?FreepanProposal">FreePAN</a>, and figured out how it complements CPAN and other repositories, then talked with gugod so they can make it all happen on this weekend.
<li>mugwump has written a regexp-based YAML 1.1 validator (and soon parser, based on Parse::RecDescent), that is generated from the <a href="http://yaml.org/spec/cvs/current.html#id867381">BNF grammar</a>. It is likely to pave a way to the <a href="http://www.cs.chalmers.se/user/markus/BNFC/">BNFC</a>/<a href="http://haskell.org/alex/">Alex</a>/<a href="http://haskell.org/happy/">Happy</a> based YAML support in Pugs.
<li>miyagawa, although not in hualian physically, stayed with us in #yapc.tw, kept sending Kwiki patches, prompting a new release of <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Kwiki-Atom/">Kwiki::Atom</a>. A new set of Kwiki/Spork/Spoon releases will happen soon, too, with fresh tweaks from YAPC::Taipei.
</ul>
<p>
So, what did I do, you ask?  I mostly just kept chating with other hackers about their projects, and try to raise some bad ideas. :-) It feels good to not code a lot for a day, and thanks to #perl6, our puppy is being fed very well when I'm in this IMC-diving mode.  In particular, I'd like to welcome our new committer shapr, a veteran lambdafolk who has provided many Haskell insights on the channel.  Thanks, shapr!
<p>
I think that's all for today. I'll save my "looking forward" paragraph in the upcoming PA02. Meanwhile, you can look at this <a href="http://svn.openfoundry.org/pugs/VICTUALS">VICTUALS</a> file. Happy April 1st!

<p>Oops. I failed to put in the commit message that that question (and answer) <a href="http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl6.internals/28746" title="perl.org">was supplied by Aaron Sherman</a perl.org>. Sorry. And if I'm being pedanticly honest, most of the answer to the first question was actually supplied by Dan and Autrijus on IRC. I just rephrased parts to make it flow better.</p>



<h2>&quot;Second&quot;, or third?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/bart/">bart</a> on 2005-04-01T17:03:56</h3>
Surely you mean the third month is starting, as 2 months have passed already.
<p>This reminds me of the discussions on non-existence of the year Zero (looking back in history, it apparently skips from -1 to 1) and on the discussion in what year the 21st century started... (2001?)</p>

Aye, I've just fixed the title. Thanks!

<h2>URL for Bamboo</h2>

Hello Autrijus,<br/><br/>I would like to try Bamboo out. What is the correct URL for the svn repository? You have only given the svnview-URL.<br/><br/>Thank you, Uwe

The repo is at svn://svn.bestpractical.com/experiments/Bamboo/ -- but it's probably prudent to wait a little while; it should be ready for general consumption when we upload it to CPAN as Bamboo 0.01.
