<div class="span8">
<p>At nothingmuch's request, I changed all IORef and HashTable in Pugs to use TVar, a STM-powered, concurrency-safe, deadlock-free storage.  For people who were not following along, here is a <a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/linksetaps/slides/peyton-jones.ppt">presentation</a> and <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/Users/simonpj/papers/stm/">paper</a> about STM as used in GHC.

<p>
This means that all our variable access are automatically atomic -- i.e. there can never be corrupted pads when pads are shared among multiple <code>async</code> blocks.  By nothingmuch and my benchmarking, there is no visible performance loss.

<p>
In other news, I eliminated the troublesome mutual module recursion, to pave a way for a new <code>EvalT</code> monad transformer that can expose <code>atomic {}</code> to Perl 6 level.  The idea is that this should work:

<pre>
    my ($x, $y) = (1, 2);
    async { atomic { $x = $y * 10; $y = $x * 10 } };
    async { atomic { $x = $y * 10; $y = $x * 10 } };
    async { atomic { $x = $y * 10; $y = $x * 10 } };
    atomic { $x = $y * 10; $y = $x * 10 };
    say "$x, $y"; # always "20000000, 200000000"
</pre>

But this should throw a catchable exception:

<pre>
    # die "Can't perform IO inside atomic {} block"
    atomic { say "Hello, World!" };
</pre>

I'm having some problems in modeling the neccessary <code>MonadCont</code> continuation semantic, so <code>atomic</code> is not exposed right now.  However, as a happy side effect, the elimination of mutual recursion has improved performance by another 15% or so.  Yay for a fast Pugs!

<p>
There are many other notable changes today as well:

<ul>
<li>Stevan committed a working <a href="http://svn.openfoundry.org/pugs/ext/Pod-Steam-Parser/">Pod::Stream::Parser</a> to ext/, in preparation for Pugs to be <em>self-documenting</em>.
<li>Speaking about documentation, theorbtwo started investigating adding <a href="http://haskell.org/haddock/">Haddock</a> annotations to Pugs.  I have used Haddock for my first Haskell project, <a href="http://wagner.elixus.org/user/autrijus/darcs/openafp/docs/">OpenAFP</a>, and it is indeed very pretty and useful.
<li>For OpenAFP, I added a <code>VOpaque</code> value type, to encapsuate any other types into an opaque reference.  The upshot is that we should be able to manipulate arbitary Haskell types (and by extension, C types) as Pugs objects soon.
<li>nothingmuch fixed <code>eval_is</code> and <code>eval_ok</code>, then proceeds to implement <code>.wrap</code>. Juerd, I and nothingmuch all agreed that the current semantics in S06 (based on Hook::LexWrap) is very awkward, and conflicts with how <code>.assuming</code> behaves; we worked out a much more perlish semantics, and nothingmuch proceeded to implement it.
<li>machack666 is working on supporting block closure traits like <code>FIRST</code>; his work may also provide a more generic trait system for other structures to use.
<li>andras checked in Memory Game v0.2, this time with tooltips on each boxes and a turns counter.
<li>iblech continues to update loose ends everywhere, including the mandelbrot tests, <code>BEGIN {...}</code> block tests, and more.
<li>bsb, nothingmuch and I moved readline probing to <code>Makefile.PL</code>, so the interactive shell should be usable for people who needs the <code>-package readline</code> flag.
<li>bsb tested and fixed <code>pick</code>'s behaviour on <code>one</code> junctions: <code>one(1).pick</code> should return <code>1</code>, but <code>one(1,1).pick</code> should be <code>undef</code>.
<li>gaal made the YAML harness sort its input, so our tests are always run in the same order, regardless of the underlying filesystem. rootmj also committed a small message fix in <code>run-smoke.pl</code>
<li>Stevan and Limbic_Region added some last/next tests.
<li>revdiablo, our new committer, added various tests on recursive function calls and subroutine references.
<li>mugwump added tests for a function returning its inner function, ensuring that the inner pad is being preserved.
</ul>

See you tomorrow!

Hi,<br> <br>The two URLs about STM in the Thursday April 28 entry are identical, both referring to the presentation. Could you post the URL to the paper?<br> <br>Thanks<br> <br>Hans

Why, sure, fixed, thanks!
