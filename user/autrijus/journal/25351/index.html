(and no, Perl 6 was too much fun so that we didn't tackle the ICFP contest in the end. sadly.)

<ul>
<li>Roles are also classes!  They can be instantiated just fine if they are concrete enough.  Basically they mean <em>composable classes</em> or <em>mixin-able classes</em>.  Hence, <tt>RoleName.new&#40;&#41;</tt> instantiates an object that will probably fail on all stubs.
<li>Class-defined methods with the same short name as their roles must conform to the same signature as the role methods; otherwise a fatal exception occurs.
<li>Abstract pure methods in Roles really just return an Exception object, exactly the same way as if the <tt>...</tt> is evaluated normally.
<pre>
method foo () { ... } 
</pre>
<li>Perl 6 is defined with separate compilation in mind; each compilation unit is going to pretend they are compiled in a different process.  They are allowed to bind names &#40;exports&#41; in other namespaces, but they cannot read anything from others.
<li><tt>&#38;chomp</tt> and <tt>&#38;wrap</tt> are now nondestructive; chomp returns the chomped part, which can be defined by the filehandle that obtains the default string at the first place.  To get destructive behaviour, use the <tt>.=</tt> form.
<li>Filehandles opens chomped by default; you need to add the <tt>:newlines</tt> flag to turn off chumping.
<pre>
my $fh = open 'file';                   # autochomp
my $fh = open 'file', :newlines;        # non-autochomp
$fh.newline = "\r";                     # now split on \r
$str = $fh.readline;
$str.newline;                           # \r

for chomp =$fh { ... }
</pre>
<p>
If <code>.newline</code> is set to a rule, then its captured variables are made available to the calling block as if it has done a matching. 
</p>
<li>The chained associativity level is associative with the precendence level it is in; hence, in the same level all chainfix operators glue together the same way the chained comparisons glue together.  The listfix associativity always accept one trailing operator, so <tt>1 Y 2 Y 3 Y</tt> is legal.
<li>Rules have their grammatical category, <tt>&#38;rule:&lt;foo&gt;</tt>, that can reside in either grammars, non-grammar packages, or the true global namespace where they get names like <tt>&#38;*rule:&lt;ident&gt;</tt>.  Inside grammars they are called <tt>&#38;Foo::rule:&lt;blah&gt;</tt>.
<li>Grammar is a specialized form of Role &#40;which is a special form of Class, which is a special form of Package&#41;.  When a grammar <tt>does</tt> another grammar, it mixes in the grammar&#39;s rules as package globals.
<li>To invoke an unqualified subrule, look at the lexical scope of the invocation site, then package globals, then finally global builtins.  This is exactly the same order as a normal subroutine lookup.  One can think rules as submethods that gets mixed in with a <tt>does</tt> call.  You call them with the current invocant &#40;i.e. the Grammar&#41;:
<pre>
# calling <ident>
&rule:<ident>.($?SELF: $state);
</pre>
<li>To invoke a qualified subrule, one look the package-level named rule up, then invoke it with two parameters: The invocant is the package object that subrule belongs to; the argument is the state object the rule engine is currently treading upon:
<pre>
# calling <Grammar::ident>
&Grammar::rule:<ident>($Grammar: $state);
</pre>
</ul>
