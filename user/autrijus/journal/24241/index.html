<p>The openfoundry subversion server is down today, delaying the 6.2.1 release a bit.  Several committers sent patches on p6c for me to apply to the <a href="http://svn.perl.org/perl6/pugs/trunk/">svn.perl.org mirror</a>, but many decides to wait until the server is back up.  Hence I'll wrap up the commit summary tomorrow, and chatter about noncode stuff today.

<p>
Nearly a week ago, somebody with a l33t spelling habit decided to submit the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autrijus_Tang">Autrijus Tang</a> entry to wikipedia, causing an immediate <em>vanity page</em> vote for deletion.  I'm not sure on how to handle this, except by pointing out I have nothing to do with the entry submission...

<p>
Most of my time today was spent on Bamboo, building and scratching many prototypes, each time a little closer to the <em>Right Thing</em>. sky asked for a short description for Bamboo, and here it is:

<blockquote>
In many web applications, one form submit may actually encompass multiple REST
actions, and one REST action may actually span several HTTP transactions,
making exception handling, ACL, parameter unpacking and rendering difficult. 
<p>
Bamboo is a virtual machine for the web that handles this context for you. It
builds facade objects from various models (Class::DBI, SearchBuilder, etc),
mapping them to RESTish URI endpoints, and provide Controller helper functions
to manage them.  Also, it provides a View kit that let you use Ajax form
controls, yet preserving the continuation context so it still works on
javascript-challenged browsers.
<p>
Bamboo is not, in itself, a MVC framework; rather it provides M/V/C adapters
into existing MVC frameworks, from barebone CGI to Catalyst to RT, so it can
work side-by-side with existing applications.
</blockquote>

<p>
Thanks to miyagawa-san's pub track talk in YAPC::Taipei, I surveyed <a href="http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-atompub-protocol-03.txt">Atom Publishing Protocol (draft 3)</a>, and I like the service/workspace/collection/entry hierarchy very much.  The use of <code>Range</code> header also neatly solves the <em>search</em> problem I encountered in my previous RT::Atom work.

<p>
Meanwhile, roie is unifying the parsing code for all our quoting constructs, and raised various <a href="http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl6.language/20386">corner cases</a> on p6l, significantly improving the list's signal ratio. Wonderful work!

<p>
I'm delighted to learn that nothingmuch is coming to YAPC::NA hackathon too; thanks for Stevan for making this possible.  Also, the hackathon will start one day earlier on 22th, so there will be three full days to hack for the lambdacamels.

<p>
That was it for today.  Tomorrow is April 18th, and I will be 24 years old when I wake up, so here's Happy Birthday to myself, I guess... :-)

May you always do for others, and let others do for you.
