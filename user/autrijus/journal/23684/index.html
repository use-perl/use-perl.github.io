<p>During my refactoring of <code>arith.t</code>, I noticed the need of wrapping the <code>ok()</code> and preserve the error reporting done inside with <code>$?CALLER::POSITION</code>, so I <a href="http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl6.language/19741">queried</a> how to extend this Perl 5 trick into Perl 6, perhaps with the <code>wrap()/call()</code> combination:
<pre>
{
    local @_ = ($lhs == $rhs, $todo);
    goto &ok;
}
</pre>
<p>
Shortly after, Larry <a href="http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl6.language/19754">answered</a> that while <code>caller()</code> may choose to ignore the <code>call()</code> scope, it does not really erase the current scope from the calling chain; to do that, he suggested the <code>.goto()</code> form would be good too. That makes me very happy, so I promptly hacked it together in 10 minutes. So now this works:
<pre>
&ok.goto( $lhs == $rhs, $todo );
</pre>
<p>
Another thing that took me much longer is tracking down the annoying GHC bug that prevents it from using the wint_t type available from FreeBSD libc, which renders Unicode programs like <code>sub &#24120;&#24335; ($&#35722;&#25976;) { ... }</code> unparsable. Annoyed by the multitude of bugs, I hacked together <a href="http://svn.openfoundry.org/pugs/src/Unicode.hsc">Unicode.hsc</a> and <a href="http://svn.openfoundry.org/pugs/src/Unicode.c">Unicode.c</a> , converted from Perl 5.8.6's <code>unicore/</code> data. I really like GHC's ability to practically inline any C code, and I'm happy to report the Unicode semantic now applies across all platforms, with no noticeable performance penalty.
<p>
In other news, lightstep hacked <code>:l</code> into the interactive shell, so we can more easily debug modules. He also improved error reporting in the shell, and conspired with me on moving the pad into the new <em>VThunk</em> type, as well as plans on producing a real compiler that may target <code>any(&lt;Haskell Parrot C--&gt;)</code>.
<p>
Speaking of VThunk, it was added today to rescue our mad golfer from the <a href="http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl6.compiler/361">punishing sand trap</a>. So short-circuit works again in Pugs now; as an added bonus, I also implemented <code>nor</code>.
<p>
I have also spent some time to convert the group p6ification project <a href="http://svn.openfoundry.org/pugs/modules/Algorithm-Dependency/">Algorithm::Dependency</a> into the <em><b>self</b>less</em> style, namely replacing all <code>$self.method</code> calls into <code>.method</code> and member variables into <code>$.var</code>. I have but done the two main modules, so volunteers welcome to complete the rest.

<p>
There have been various reports that some versions of Win32 fails to build Pugs; Ingy today got to the bottom of it and proclaims that it is now Fixed For Real. Win32 users, please update to the latest repository trunk and try again; thanks for your patience! :)
<p>
malarie asked various insightful question on #perl6, culminating in the successful implementation of <code>rindex()</code>. We still need a better grasp of when to use multi subs and when to use optional parameters, but we are learning as we go. Plus, Rod's <a href="http://www.rodadams.net/Perl/S29.html">S29: Builting functions</a> looks like a promising start toward this direction. It even comes with reference implementations, which is one of the many things I like about the <a href="http://www.haskell.org/onlinelibrary/standard-prelude.html">Haskell Report</a>. Wonderful.
<p>
On the test front, Stevan continues to improve <code>Test.pm</code>, including the test suite for <code>Test.pm</code> itself. nothingmuch collected tests from various sources, including asavige, and committed them in. scw added comprehensive tests for his favourite ternary operator <code>?? ::</code>. mattc, our newest committer, added tests for <code>time</code>, <code>times</code>, <code>localtime</code> and <code>gmtime</code>. I also restored <code>basic.t</code> to sanity.
<p>
By the way, today my total commits fell below 50% -- we are at the 813th revision, and I'm responsible for only about 400 of them. I expect the percentage to continue falling as Pugs matures; this makes me really, really grateful to the wonderful team of committers. Thank you, folks!
<p>
So, with YAPC's Hackathon drawing near, I'm drawing up plans on 6.2.0 and beyond: the use of thunks, ITypes and Perl5 "magics", meta model of the Class system, and the Rules parser are among the many things I'm experimenting with. Stay tuned!</p>
