<p>Turns out that the new hard disk only lasted for 18 days --
it suddenly broke without any warnings. To make things even more
catastrophic, my /home backup dump is corrupted as well.
<p>
So instead of hacking on Pugs, I've been stuck for a whole day
salvaging bits, buying another replacement disk, et cetera.
<p>
This has totally convinced me of the need of a software RAID for
my laptop, so that's what I'm setting up now.  Since the laptop
can only carry two internal disks, RAID1 looks simplest to set
up with FreeBSD's GEOM/gmirror, but I'm still looking for other
solutions...

<h2>Ouch</h2>

If it were me, I wouldn't use GEOM. I setup a new web server last week using dual drives and a bootable GEOM mirror using these instructions:<br><br><a href="http://people.freebsd.org/user/rse/mirror/" title="freebsd.org">http://people.freebsd.org/user/rse/mirror/</a freebsd.org><br><br>After about 4 reboots and 30 minutes later, they crapped all over themselves and I had to start over. I settled for a nightly dump to disk two and weekly CD backups of that.

Hmm....  I have been using gmirror for a quite while and I like it.  I have experienced disk crashes several times already but for all cases the recoveries went well.  That even includes that case where BOTH disks got corrupted -- in which case I set up yet another gmirror disk consisting of only one disk, copied everything that can be copied, booted from the new gmirror disk, and finally added a disk to the mirror.   If I were to choose software RAID on FreeBSD, I'll use gmirror.  I used to use vinum but gmirror is much more straightforward.<br><br>Dan the Man with Too Many RAIDs to Babysit

I'm a sysadmin by trade (well, one of too many trades these days<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) so I know how it feels like when your disk is dead.<br><br>However I am not sure if RAID on laptops is a good idea in terms of power consumption.  What I do is protect the server with RAID and backup your laptop there.  Simple rsync would suffice for most cases.<br><br>And if possible make your laptop as "thin" as possible -- for instance, I use IMAP for mails so I do not have to backup mails on my powerbook.  I even do most of development via ssh so my powerbook is virtually a thin client.<br><br>Dan the Man with Too Many Dead HDDs to the Date<br>



<h2>Better solution...</h2>

Sorry to hear that. Modern laptop harddisks are a problem. I can't recommend putting 2 into one laptop. This will drain to much power and also be too hot. (Well you can spin down the second disk, etc<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...)<br><br>What I can recommend is an "offsite" solution with a USB or Firewire 2.5" HDD Enclosure, preferably USB which drains the power from the laptop.<br><br>rsync once a day, and/or after a hacking session and you will be fine<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... hopefully<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)<br><br>The great plus is that you can use the rsynced hd in every computer without opening it...



<h2>USB</h2>

My laptop doesn't carry a second drive. It could if I could find the right ultrabay adapter for it, but I couldn't. So I decided to attach a small USB drive to the exterior. This works perfectly. It takes over an hour of battery life, but the feeling my data's a little safer is worth it.<br><br>My next laptop will be an ultraportable, though, and to that I don't want to glue anything. It also doesn't have an optical drive that I could replace. It has a single cardbus slot, but I use that for EDGE. I'm currently thinking of buying a cardbus drive anyway, and living without RAID when I need an internet connection.<br><br>Suggestions are welcome<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
