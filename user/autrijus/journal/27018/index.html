<p>I'm finally setting the land in order, with aid from a richly alive #perl6.  Together we fixed and TODO'ed some 400+ failed subtests today, with about the same number to go tomorrow, before we can release 6.2.10 in good conscience.

<p>
Happily, leo has become a #perl6 resident; with his help, we regained compatibility with Parrot 0.3.0's new calling conventions, and rules support via PGE again works.  The new calling conventions are much saner; chip/leo have done a wonderful job.  They are working on named parameters, lexical pads and variable-sized register frames for 0.3.1, which could be the first Parrot that Pugs can seriously target to.

<p>
Talked with Stevan about MM2, and we both agreed that Ruby-style singleton classes -- I mean <em>eigenclasses</em> -- is a saner way than this arbitrary distinction of class methods and instance methods.  The user-visible API (aka metaobject protocol) would remain the same, but the internal dispatcher would be much easier to reason about.

<p>
After fixing the aforementioned arbitrary dispatch in the default runcore, brentdax's <a href="http://svn.openfoundry.org/pugs/ext/Cipher/">Cipher</a> suite passed all tests.  It's a nice demonstration of multi-paradigmic module API; it supports functional, OO and procedural modes of operation.

<p>
Following yesterday's <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/jesse/journal/26998">Parrot Sketch</a> (which finally appeared on <a href="http://planetsix.perl-foundation.org/">Planet Six</a>), nothingmuch volunteered to parse the rules tests into specification-based <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Test-Base/">Test::Base</a> tests, so we can move them all into the Parrot tree where it belongs.

<p>
So, things are looking good for 6.2.10; we still need to solve installation for <code>perl5/</code>, and I'd like to integrate <A href="http://svn.openfoundry.org/pugs/Pugs.cabal">Pugs.cabal</a> for libpugs.o support as well.

<p>
After 6.2.10, the push for 6.28.0 will be done roughly by taking the PIL compilation backend, write a new container/metamodel runcore in Haskell to make sure it works correctly, improve the intermediate language until it hits what we needs for PIL2, and adjust js/p5/parrot backend accordingly.

<p>
Two months is an extremely long period between two releases; thanks for all lambdacamels for getting it into a fine shape, largely in my absence. It looks like <b>-O<em>fun</em></b> is a worthwhile optimization after all: I'm happy to rejoin the fun, and even happier to see new committers around.  geoffb promised to capture some related discussions in his <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/au/2333">weblog</a> tomorrow; I'm looking forward to see it.  Ciao!
