Stevan's life as the <tt>ChangeLog</tt> scribe would probably be much miserable, if I actually skipped all daily summaries for this week.  So I'm back now to summarise the developmeng since Pugs 6.2.5's release:

<ul>
<li>Multi-invocant calls like <code>foo($x, $y: $z) is no longer legal, according to Damian's new revelation.  That broke <code>&sub.goto</code> for a while (since you can't re-appoint invocants anymore), but it's fixed now.
<li>Class methods now works; <code>Int.isa(Int)</code> now returns true.
<li><code>./SUPER::method()</code> implemented at chromatic's request.
<li><code>pugs -MFoo</code> now means <code>use Foo</code> instead of <code>require Foo</code>.  That makes <code>pugs -MDBI--perl5 -e '...'</code> work correctly.
<li>chromatic hacked in <code>DESTROYALL</code>/<code>DESTROY</code> support with help from scook0 and SamB, taking advantage of GHC's fast generational GC system and System.Mem.Weak's support for adding finalisers.  I also forced a GC run to always happen on program termination.
<li>luqui implemented exclusive-range operators: <code>^..</code>, <code>..^</code> and <code>^..^</code>.
<li>integral (aka bsmith -- I'm going to switch to IRC nicks as primary handles) continued to factor away AST, Parser and other modules into smaller submodules.
<li>gaal added quickref/unicode to document how to enter those Unicode operators in editors, upon dragonchild's request on p6l; Juerd also improved layout on many quickref documents.
<li>ninereasons worked on the cookbook, in particular 01-02default-variables.t, adding idioms like the use of <code>[//] @foo</code> to find the first defined value in <code>@foo</code>.
<li>iblech adjusted the scaling of svnlog2graph.pl again, because we have more 4000 commits now.  Parrot has ~8000, so there's still some way to go...
<li>mugwump played with the new <code>coro</code> support, adding a (not fully working) iterator interface to his Tree.pm module.
<li>theorbtwo and scook0 tweaked PA02 to make it more readable.
<li>mugwump rearranged metamodel-related modules under <code>ext/Perl-MetaModel</code> to be more consistent; the beginning of a Perl 6 port of Pugs's source code is interesting.
<li>Stevan updated perl6_meta_meta_class_hierarchy.pod; I asked chromatic to audit them before I implement them in Pugs.
<li>rgs, integral and clkao worked on Makefile.PL's support for Perl 5 embedding; it should now work on most *nix platforms.
<li>Limbic_Region needed hyper-dereferencing operators, so he wrote test for them.
<li>iblech made <code>&reduce</code> and <code>&map</code> accept n-ary functions, in a similar way as the <code>for</code> block.
<li>dakkar, our new committer, added a JAPH written for the t-shirt of the Second Italian Perl Workshop:
<pre>
say [~] (-> @c is copy {gather { while @c[0] { for @c -> {take(.shift)} } }
}(['Joec','utrk','shle','te6r',' r .','a h.','nPa.'].map:{[split "",$_]}));
</pre>
<li>Aankhen added <code>&escapeHTML</code> and <code>&unescapeHTML</code> to CGI.pm, refactored CGI::Header to behave more like the Perl 5 counterpart, implemented full support for <code>CGI::redirect</code>, and ported over Perl 5's CGI::Util module.
<li>cdpruden, our new committer, found that our <code>&eval_haskell</code> is broken with newer hs-plugins.  Old versions with non-hierarchical namespace is no longer supported.
<li>Corion declared that <code>&times</code> now works on Win32 for real.
<li>iblech made <code>die "abc\ndef\nghi"</code> correctly align vertically.
<li>gaal started working on the standard Prelude.pm, a set of not-really-primitve functions that can be implemented in Perl6. The first example is <code>&Pipe::open</code> (but known as <code>&openpipe</code> for now.
<li>Hyper-reduction prefix operators like <code>[+]ÃâÃÂ«</code> are now parsed, thanks to iblech.
<li>iblech also made <code>&readline</code> handle UTF-8 correctly, so svnbot6 can finally announce the commit messages as UTF-8.
<li>scook0 added more Haddock, and renamed the enterLoop internal function to the more correct enterWhile.
<li>fireartist, our new committer, added many tests for corner cases in array and hash slicing.
<li>iblech unbroke <code>"$hash&lt;key&gt;"</code> in string interpolation.
<li>nothingmuch added a draft module, Class::Events, a publish-subscribe event framework much like <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Class-Publisher/lib/Class/Publisher.pm">Class::Publisher</a>.  With luck (and <code>handles</code> delegation support), hopefully he will finish it before the 6.2.6 release and move to <code>ext/</code> where it belongs...
<li>iblech contributed another useful real-world Perl 6 script, <a href="http://svn.openfoundry.org/pugs/examples/network/screen-nodestatus.p6">screen-nodestatus.p6</a>, that monitors host aliveness for GNU screen users.  The bottom-right corner of this <a href="http://m19s28.vlinux.de/iblech/screen-nodestatus.png">screenshot</a> has this in action.
<li>Aankhen moved ext/LWP-Simple/ to ext/libwww-perl/ after some discussions in #perl6.
<li>ninereasons improved support for inline documentations in <code>perl6.vim</code>.  I wonder when will we see a <code>perl6-mode</code> for Emacs...
<li>SamB, our new committer from lambdaland, added export lists Pugs.Types, while investigating various ways to speed up the compilation process.
<li>iblech implemented implemented a couple Control::Basic::* functions from S29: <code>&nothing</code> and <code>&evalfile</code>.
<li>ninereasons clarified a <code>pair.t</code> test that reflects Larry's ruling that <code>=&gt;</code> now assumes assignment precedence, so <code>1 =&gt; 2 ?? 3 :: 4</code> will construct a pair.  I promptly implemented it.
<li>Aankhen improved <a href="http://svn.openfoundry.org/pugs/docs/other/porting_howto">porting_howto</a> to keep it up to date with recent practices.
<li>eric256 continued to work on wizard.p6, uncovering many issues with given/when and wrote tests for them. Thanks to his report, <code>when .method() {...}</code> now works.
</ul>

Whew. I think that's all. See you tomorrow!
