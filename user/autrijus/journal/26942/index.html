<div class="span8">
<p>Continuing yesterday's work, today I got seriously addicted in GHC core hackery, skipping the entire Curry workshop.  It was a real pleasure pairing with <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/user/simonpj/">spj</a> on this.  He reminded me of lwall -- both have an obsession on providing useful feedback to programmer, strong intuition on how language features intersect, and above all a deep enthusiasm to their respective languages.
<p>
Thanks to spj's continuous guidance, I hacked in support for existential record types on both vanilla and GADT types, which allows us to write:
<pre>
data Counter public = forall this. New
    { self   :: this
    , inc    :: this -> this
    , output :: this -> IO ()
    , tag    :: public
    }
</pre>
The <code>tag</code> function is well-typed as <code>Counter public -> public</code>; the other three fields hides the real implementation from the <code>Counter</code> data type, so one can have a counter using Int, another using String, and have both be of the same type.

<p>
This representation is quite close to how encapsulation works in OO langauges, and the feedback from #haskell has been very positive.  Additionally, the soundness of the GADT/Labels treatment passed scrunity by Oleg today, which made me feel much safer.

<p>
Of course, any attempt to use the three private fields as normal functions raises a compile-time error that advises the use of pattern-matching syntax instead.  Also, in the GADT form, the <code>forall this</code> may be omitted to improve readability.


<p>
While I was madly hacking away, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_Eich">brendan</a> passed by, and graciously accepted a Pugs T-Shirt from me.  We talked about many things -- I'm very excited to hear that they are considering to adopt Rhino's continuation engine for SpiderMonkey (which will make Perl6-on-JavaScript insanely faster), and that the XUL scripting is proceeding well.  They would like to use user's system python/perl/ruby/etc if possible, but that complicates the versioning problem.
<p>
Inevitably, the topic of shared runtime came up, and it seems that Mono's RAND patent position is still not yet very satisfatory.  Parrot has matured a bit since two years ago when brendan checked it out, so I filled him on some recent development.  With 0.3.0 out in a couple days, we can finally start targetting Parrot again -- hopefully the long wait will be proven worthwhile.
<p>
Oh, do check out <A href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/7928?CMP=OTC-BD0016219291">geoffb's writeup</a> of his musings on #perl6; it's a nice survey of some of the good ideas from other language that are finding their way into Perl6.
<p>
After yesterday's discovery of <a href="http://cvs.haskell.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/fptools/ghc/compiler/ilxGen/">ILX codegen</a>, spj pointed out that there is a more robust <a href="http://cvs.haskell.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/fptools/ghc/compiler/javaGen/">Java codegen</a> on the same directory.  Targetting JVM suddenly looks more attractive too...
<p>
All in all, I think my time on hacking GHC core is well-spent; I learned a lot of Haskell idioms that should make Pugs code cleaner (such as the <code>case x of DataCon {} -&gt; ...</code> syntax that works even on non-record types), and about complexity management of a large real-world language implementation -- i.e., what makes it to evolve extremely fast, despite a relatively small core team and contributor base, and an utterly broken issue-tracking system.  RT-powered bugs.haskell.org seems like a good idea...
<p>
Tomorrow is the Haskell workshop, the final day and highlight of this conference.  See you!</p>
