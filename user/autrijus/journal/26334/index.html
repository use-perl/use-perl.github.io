<p>In the last two days, four people orderd T-shirts from the <a href="http://www.cafepress.com/pugscode">Pugs Store</a>, a fact that made me unreasonably happy. :-)

<p>
mugwump's cute "Powered by Ph.D." design joined the store, along with a metamodel raglan shirt.  We are bouncing a few new ideas in #perl6, most of which related to a hypothetical WebService::CafePress module (eg. per-release shirts that are available for a very limited time).  This leads to conversations like:
<blockquote><tt>
&lt;kolibrie&gt; autrijus: update the AUTHORS shirt every release, it can lag some<br>
&lt;kolibrie&gt; but WebService::CafePress would be good<br>
* autrijus ponders a t-shirt that reflects the sky every minute<br>
* kolibrie knows autrijus is crazy now<br>
&lt;autrijus&gt; that would not be a news to many people here :)
</tt></blockquote>

<p>
Okay, enough shop talk.  Today I succeeded in getting <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/brentdax/journal/">brentdax</a>'s <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/WWW-Kontent/">Kontent</a> running -- the default page looks elegant indeed.  Thanks to kolibrie for reporting the Kontent failure with Perl 5 binding; it turns out that the perl5 glue was casting <code>POPi</code> as <code>bool</code>, causing a method call to only succeed if its CODE pointer address is an odd number!  This weak typing thing is really annoying...  Fortunately it's all fixed now.

<p>
Our new committer, Yiyi "xinming" Hu, <a href="http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl6.compiler/1057">reported</a> that <code>method $obj</code> didn't call <code>$obj.method</code> as specced in the Synopsis.  I fixed it promptly.

<p>
As an added bonus, I fixed the long-standing parse glitch that makes <code>class Foo { syntax'error }</code> report the error at the outer block level, instead of where the error happened.  This should simplify debugging OO code a lot.

<p>
iblech finished converting PIL2JS to use the much faster <code>-CPerl5</code>, cutting down compile time by 50%.  However, the CPS transform made the runtime 2x slower, so the end result for <code>make jssmoke</code> is about equal before and after the conversion.  putter suggested some trampoline techniques to speed things up, so there may still be room for improvement.

<p>
iblech also made DrIFT.Perl5 emit <code>Math::BigInt</code> objects for <code>NaN</code> and <code>Inf</code>, so Perl6's numeric semantic can be correctly duplicated in Perl 5.  As a result to the CPS conversion, various new features are working in JavaScript, including a true lexical <code>$_</code>; <code>$CALLER::_</code> follows naturally.

<p>
putter added a link to mugwump's <a href="http://wellington.pm.org/archive/200506/perl6-intro/html/index.html">Wellinton.pm Perl6 talk</code> in <a href="http://svn.openfoundry.org/pugs/docs/talks/README">docs/talks/README</a>.

<p>
Limbic_Region reported that <code>1_000_000.00_00</code> was not parsed, and I implemented it right away.  Curiously, that broke some code, because dot is a method invocation now, and <code>1.e10</code> can take two meanings.  An ongoing <a href="http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl6.language/22769">p6l thread</a> is triggered to resolve this issue.

<p>
fglock cleared up much of the boxed/unboxed/reference semantics in the Perl 5 runtime implementation, and reimplemented the Scalar container to autoderef calls such as <code>$x[2]</code>.  It's really exciting to see Pugs inch closer to the day of Perl6-on-perl5...

<h2>cameleopard</h2>

Whenever I see the word 'lambdacamel' I think of the cameleopard (the kirin in Chinese and Japanese). With the appearance of a camel and the skin of a leopard, the cameleopard was either a fantastic animal or the giraffe. Here is an image by the English wood engraver Thomas Bewick, which emphasizes the camel connection:<br><a href="http://liesl.sharecom.ca/bewick/quadrupeds/9039051.html" title="sharecom.ca">http://liesl.sharecom.ca/bewick/quadrupeds/9039051.html</a sharecom.ca><br><br>With perl 6 being a transformation of the camel into some other kind of beast, the cameleopard seems an appropriate image for the language.
