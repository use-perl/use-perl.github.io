<p>Of all commits today, only 1 was mine (a very small step on getting on-the-fly
compilation to work), and 32 are from other committers, doing great work
at an amazing rate as usual.
<p>
My subpar productivity was due partly to carsick and mild food poisoning 
(again), partly from this silly <em>CPAN drinking game</em> which I won,
and also from this even sillier but surprisingly addictive <a href="http://www.ufoot.org/liquidwar/">Liquid War</a> game, which clkao largely dominates over me, obra and acme.
<p>
However, I did find time to read over the extremely concise, well-written
and robust <a href="http://yaml.org/spec/current.html">YAML spec</a>, and
have started some work on a Parsec-based YAML parser that can deal with
infinite streams, which according to ingy will make the world a happier place.
<p>
Now, let's see what other people have done to Pugs today...
<ul>
<li>corion has made great progress on command line switches, making <code>-I foo</code> and <code>-l</code> work, added <code>@*ARGS</code> access to <code>pugs -e</code> one-liners, and written tests for <code>-C</code> and friends.
<li>asavige the mad golfer checked in the first <a href="http://svn.openfoundry.org/pugs/examples/obfu/snowing.p6">Pugs Obfuscation</a>. It looks really nice -- but I'm not going to tell you what it looks like. Try running it with pugs!
<li>kungfuftr worked on <a href="http://kungfuftr.com/pugs-smoke.html">pugs-smoke graph</a>, so we can now all see in plain daylight how the trunk is burning. There's been lots of work into it, making pretty tooltips on the test failure messages, and hyperlinks into the actual tests, even down to the <a href="http://kungfuftr.com/t_index/t/subroutines/sub_return_values.html#line_133">failing line itself</a>. I'm as amazed as the first time I've seen the <a href="http://wagner.elixus.org/user/clkao/svk-cover/">Test::Cover graph</a>.  Wonderful work!
<li>mugwump keeps churning out large chunks of Perldoc code. DOMs can now send events to each other, which means we are closer and closer to the nirvana of interoperable Perldoc dialects.
<li>lightstep took the plunge to restore sanity to option parsing, by introdusing an abstract data type for options. corion and shapr followed up with some discussions and debug actions.
<li>stevan took a clue from #perl6 and changed the name of CGI::Pugs to be just CGI. He then proceeded to port lots of functionalities from Perl 5's CGI.pm, as well as quite a few tests.
<li>stevan also added various tests for string and math processing builtins.
<li>theorbtwo rewrote our test cataloger that links tests with design documents.
<li>kcwu added tests for pointy blocks, and fixed the test for <code>rand()</code>.
<li>hcchien added tests for multidimensional arrays.
<li>rgs added some more keywords into perl6.vim.
<li>darrens continues to p6ify SQL::Routine. Strangely, they look even more perlish to my eyes. Maybe that's because Perl 6 no longer forces us to pay the 30%+ "language tax" of code overhead anymore...
</ul>
<p>
Oh, and I've talked with Leo on IRC today, and there is a distinct possibility that I may stay in his place for a couple weeks in the months to come -- I'll keep you posted. But, just imagine the unstoppable combined productivity! :-)
