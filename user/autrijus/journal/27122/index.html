<p>Happily, both lightning talks got accepted, so I committed the unadapted <a href="http://svn.openfoundry.org/pugs/docs/talks/larry_mariner.txt">Larry was a mariner</a> text into the Pugs tree, planning to work on it (and read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1593600259/002-1756408-9829609">The Sillymarillion</a>) whenever my brain feels overheated.  Thoughts, ideas, patches and commits are all very much welcome!

<p>
Today I wade through the code in <a href="http://svn.openfoundry.org/pugs/perl5/">perl5/</a> (i.e., the Perl5 and JS runtime engines), to prepare for the renovated container/object runcore.  The Perl5 runtime's hook with metamodel was very enlightening, and fglock's meticulous TODO comments helped much.  Also iblech's <a href="http://svn.openfoundry.org/pugs/perl5/PIL2JS/libjs/PIL2JS.js">JS runtime</a> is so concise, it looks almost like poetry.  *smile*

<p>
I then turned to read <a href="http://svn.openfoundry.org/pugs/docs/notes/theory.pod">theory.pod</a> for the third time, which is a good summary of GADTs and generics in a Perl6 setting -- but whenever I start to think about how to reconcile it with optional dynamicness, my head starts throbbing.  No wonder why Larry spent much time <a href="http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl6.language/23429">mulling over</a> it, and I sympathize luqui's <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/luqui/journal/27116">conflicted feeling</a> a lot.  Still, I think here formalization still helps, not hinders, so I look forward to spend some time with @Larry next week to hammer this out.

<p>
On the metamodel front, stevan attempted to steer Perl6's OO model toward Smalltalk/CLOS/Ruby from the Java/C++ direction, <a href="http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl6.language/23455">proposing</a> that we drop class method inheritance and instead embrace eigenclasses, per-instance methods and roles as the True Way of doing things.  Damian <a href="http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl6.language/23456">wondered</a> how can we tell people to do away with the perl5 idiom of inheritable class-method <code>new</code>, and the discussion continues...  Personally I think having a certain kind of Class that supports inheritable class methods can work out, but I'm not sure; fortunately, stevan volunterred to experiment and report back.

<p>
eric256 continued to make examples more pugs and runnable, and uncovered a bug that makes pugs too eagerly handle <code>-n</code> and <code>-p</code> in the script's argument list.

<p>
iblech added proper exception for division/modulo-by-zero to PIL2JS, a complete set of bit operators, fixed evaluation order so the indices are evaluated before the array/hash, and converted more p6l discussions into somewhat saner and certainly more tractable tests.

<p>
There's more, but I need to sleep.  Ciao! :)

<h2>Subclass of Class with inheritable class methods</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Stevan/">Stevan</a> on 2005-10-12T02:21:40</h3>
As promised, I have managed to implement a subclass of Class which will create classes which themselves have inheritable class methods (wow, thats kind of a mouthful). It is commited as a test in the Perl 5 meta-model prototype <a href="http://svn.openfoundry.org/pugs/perl5/Perl6-MetaModel/t/37_inherited_class_methods.t" title="openfoundry.org">here</a openfoundry.org>. It has some quirks, but nothing which cannot be overcome easily.
