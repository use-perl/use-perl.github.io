<h1>Day 91: YAML, PGE, fast arrays.</h1>

<div class="span8">
<p>We now have built-in YAML parsing support with <code>eval_yaml($str)</code>.  The amazing <a href="http://whytheluckystiff.net/syck/">libsyck</a> and Haskell FFI made it possible for me to code this in under an hour.  Anyone wants to try writing the emitter as well? :-)

<p>
With my newly aquired FFI-fu, PGE (the Perl 6 Rules Grammar Engine) is now embedded within Pugs.  Using <code>rx//</code> and <code>s///</code> now emits some random PIR code.  Rumour has it that Patrick will release his new PGE later today; I will promptly update our <code>Text.PGE</code> module to the newest code, so courageous lambdacamels can try hooking it up to <code>Pugs.Rules</code> while the rest of us continue to get the OO model done.

<p>
Sol Foster wrote in to say that his Erastothenes Sieve implementation, while indeed 10x faster than Pugs 6.2.1 at first, gradually slows down to a crawl.  This is because array storage was using a List; I have quickly swapped it into using IntMap, allowing O(1) access for smaller arrays. Now the sieve program runs much faster.

<p>
shapr reports that Simon Peyton-Jones, father of GHC, grants us the permission to derive our subcontinuation code from the <em><a href="http://research.microsoft.com/Users/simonpj/papers/control/control.pdf">A Monadic Framework for Subcontinuation</a></em> paper.  I'm honoured at these words from SPJ:

<blockquote>
Actually, we're rather impressed at the sophistication of the
programming techniques that Autrijus and you and the other Pugs folk are
deploying.  Subcontinuations, GADTs, what next?
</blockquote>

Hmm, Template Haskell and STM, of course -- Pugs already uses them profitably. :-)

<p>
Some other notable developments today:

<ul>
<li>
I began converting my <code>~/bin/</code> to Perl 6, and hacked in <code>system($cmd, @list)</code> support, as well as <code>exec($cmd, @list)</code>.

<li>
Stevan is thinking about <code>:todo<parsefail></code> attributes; I pointed to him that <code>sub ok(Bool $cond is lazy, +$todo) {}</code> can delay evaluation for <code>$cond</code>, which may be what we want when the error is untrappable.

<li>
scook0 continued adding Haddock API documentations to Pugs modules.  It is extremely helpful -- I fixed some naming inconsistencies by looking at his comments.

<li>
skew (aka brandon) checked in a small perl script -- likely his first -- to post-process profile outputs from <code>make pugs.prof</code>.

<li>
Limbic_Region added an infinite list generator to examples.

<li>
iblech updated svnlog2graph.pl to use a better scaling.

<li>
rootmj added tests for lvalue functions in <code>for</code> loops, e.g. <code>for @list.values -> $num is rw</code>.

<li>
gaal fixed concurrency issues with parallel <code>make smoke</code>; he also added more <code>#line</code> tests; I made them pass shortly after.

<li>
luqui noted that the <code>for (@list_q): sub {...}</code> form, as used in the current test, should not work; the colon should be a comma.  I fixed the parse accordingly, too.

</ul>

<p>
Since I am already past deadline for <code>$work</code>, this week I'll focus on it instead of Pugs.  I trust the lambdacamels will keep it well-fed, though, so I'm not too worried.  See you tomorrow!
