<p>This afternoon I've thrown together a <a href="http://svn.openfoundry.org/pugs/examples/mandel.p6">mandelbrot</a> example for the Pugs compiler (to haskell) backend work. It looks like this <a href="http://autrijus.org/mandel.hs">Haskell code</a>; and here is the original <a href="http://autrijus.org/mandel.ast">Pugs AST</a>.
<p>
Here's the benchmark numbers:
<pre>
Pugs Interpreted:   77.29 seconds 477k memory
PugsCC Unoptimized: 01.35 seconds 476k memory
PugsCC Optimized:   00.39 seconds 455k memory
Perl 5:             00.14 seconds 362k memory
</pre>
<p>
Note that the <code>mandel.hs</code> above is still using the doubly-boxed <code>Val</code> type, and the ultra-slow <code>op1/op2</code> dispatch, just so we can reuse all <code>Prim.hs</code> code and guarantee to have the same semantics. Hence, there is a large room of improvement. But I think it's good for a two-hour hack. :-)
<p>
For the next step, I'm hanging out in irc.perl.org #parrot now, learning from Coke, Nicholas, chip, bernhard and other helpful people about how to model a Parrot AST in Haskell, as <code>Compile/Parrot.hs</code> in Pugs. The plan is to use Template Haskell to compile Pugs AST into a Haskell program that, when executed, produces PIR code. See <a href="http://www.venge.net/graydon/talks/mkc/html/index.html">One-Day Compilers</a> for the general technique.
<p>
So I plan to start from Python and Cola's AST-&gt;PIR translators and work from there; we'll see if I can get one working this week before YAPC::Taipei.
<p>
In other news, nothingmuch hacked a whole day on the currying <code>.assuming()</code> code, radically refactoring the underlying <code>VSub</code> structure to contain prebound parameters, as well as refactoring bindings to use <code>Val</code> instead of <code>Exp</code>, to allow both lazy and strict evaluation modes. His enthusiasm and the amazing ability to grok the non-commented evaluator core is really, really moving to see. Way to go, &#1497;&#1493;&#1489;&#1500;!
<p>
Stevan, the test squad leader and another tirelessly helpful soul, listed a large set of <a href="http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl6.compiler/417">TODOs</a> for us to work on before we reach 6.2.0. Development has never been so joyful for me, with this thourough test-driven plans, clear implementable goals, so I can code with abandon without fearing regressions. Soon, with the test cataloger and backlinker, we'll have a nice HTML page for interested people to see our status at a glance. Wonderful.
<p>
On the documentation front, ingy and mugwump has finished most of Kwid to DOM to HTML formatting stuff, and got lots of DOM semantics done. I am really looking forward to their arrival on 23th, so we can get Pugs's object metamodel going and start moving toward 6.2.0.
<p>
Randal Schwartz reported that <code>CPAN.pm</code>  and <code>CPANPLUS</code> could not detect that there is a newer version of Pugs on CPAN. The reason turns out to be that MakeMaker and CPAN::Version has different ideas about v-string versions, so I whipped up some Module::Install magic to compensate the MakeMaker bug. So Pugs 6.0.13 should be appropriately upgradable.
<p>
I think that's about it for today. Soon I'd need to work on my YAPC::Taipei talk. Hopefully I will have a Perl 6 -&gt; Parrot compiler for the audience to see...</p>

Excellent.  Looks like pugs is starting to give perl5 a run for its money.  Although I suppose we should wait at least a little while longer before submitting entries to <a href="http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/" title="debian.org">The Computer Language
Shootout</a debian.org>.
