<div class="span8">
<p>With Pugs 6.2.3 out of door, many lambdacamels turned their attention to the newly introduced OO implementation, committing lots of examples, documentations and tests:

<ul>
<li>Stevan neatly <a href="http://svn.openfoundry.org/pugs/ext/Perl-MetaModel/docs/meta_meta_classes.pod">summarised</a> the ongoing MetaModel work, a basis for the future (or imminent?) Perl6-compiler-in-Perl6 effort.
<li>eric256, our new committer, implemented a <a href="http://svn.openfoundry.org/pugs/examples/games/wizard.p6">RPG game</a> (also see his <a href="http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=456587">Perlmonks writeup</a>), which exercised many OO features and bugs.
<li>...those bugs, in turn, were made into unit tests by eric256. Yay!
<li>Juerd started the <a href="http://svn.openfoundry.org/pugs/docs/quickref/">quickref</a> project to produce short summaries of Perl 6 syntax. The <a href="http://svn.openfoundry.org/pugs/docs/quickref/op">operator</a> part is already quite complete; volunteers welcome!
<li>mugwump and Stevan continued to work on <a href="http://svn.openfoundry.org/pugs/ext/Set/lib/Set.pm">Set.pm</a> and <a href="http://svn.openfoundry.org/pugs/ext/Tree/lib/Tree.pm">Tree.pm</a>,  the first two Perl 6 OO modules.
<li>Stevan noted that many of <code>t/oo/</code> tests actually passes; iblech and he then proceeded to write some more.
</ul>

These activities prompted various internal changes:
<ul>
<li><code>$.typed_attribute.method</code>  is now handled by MMD.
<li><code>.method</code> changed to mean <code>$_.method</code>; to call method on the current invocant, use <code>^method</code> instead.
<li><code>do { ... }</code> block literal is now supported.
<li><code>submethod</code> is parsed.
<li>Qualified type literals are now parsed correctly, e.g. in <code>sub Baz returns Foo::Bar</code>.
</ul>


On the bot-writing front: right after 6.2.3's release, metaperl invited #perl6 to play hangman cooperatively, with him relaying between the channel and <a href="http://svn.openfoundry.org/pugs/examples/games/hangman.p6">hangman.p6</a>. I noted that a hangman bot is more suited for this task; minutes later, iblech produced <a href="http://svn.openfoundry.org/pugs/examples/network/hangmanbot.p6">hangmanbot.p6</a>, and we played a couple round of games.  Lots of fun!
<p>
Also as a result of hangmanbot.p6, people found the NOTICE messages used by bots annoying, so iblech turned them into regular PRIVMSGs.  Hopefully my checkins won't disrupt people's sleep again...
<pre>
<Stevan> horray,.. openfoundry is back
<wilx> ~_~
<wilx> I forgot to turn off my speakers befire I went to sleep and my mIRC beeps on notice.
<wilx> It woke me up :/
</pre>

<p>
clkao finally got the committer bit and wrote his first lines of Perl 6 code, to change the svnbot's announcement from <code>committer --</code> to <code>committer++</code>. We also discussed various approaches to port svk to Perl 6.

<p>
On the perl6-language front, after some discussion with pmichaud, we <a href="http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl6.language/21100">suggested</a> the <code>$0</code> (that's <code>$1</code> in Perl 5) produced in <code>'123' ~~ /(\d+)/</code> should numify to <code>123</code>, instead of the absurdly surprisingly <code>1</code> which tripped iblech, Stevan and me.  Fortunately, sanity prevailed; Larry and Damian both OK'ed the suggestion, and it's been implemnted in both PGE and Pugs.

<p>
Also, per Larry's <a href="http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl6.language/21096">explanation</a>, <code>split</code> with capturing rules now inserts the match objects of submatches into the resulting list, instead of their stringified forms.

<p>
Other commits of note:
<ul>
<li>bsmith added more export lists to .hs code, making refactoring easier.
<li>bsmith, Forth (another new committer!) and I worked on getting <code>pugs_version.h</code> correctly generated from svk checkouts.
<li>corion helpfully moved away passing tests from <code>t/pugsbugs/</code> to other subdirectories where they belong.
<li>ninereasons purged the remnants of old-style <code>force_todo</code>
into per-test <code>:todo&lt;bug&gt;</code> forms.
<li>jhorwitz and I made  <code>$!</code> into the exit value after an unsuccessful <code>system()</code> that returns false.
<li>iblech cleaned up Net::IRC a bit, adding even more commands to it.
<li>gaal made the tests more robust when running in parallel, by using nonces as temporary file names and cleaning them up.
<li>iblech noted with delight that <code>s/./{ state $var; ++$var }/</code> works perfectly, and added a test for it.
<li>scook0 inquired me about the design for various internal data types, then added them to the <a href="http://pugscode.org/haddock/">API documentation</a>.
</ul>

<p>
Last, but not the least, I've finally committed some non-broken C code into the Parrot tree! I separated the bogus mix of ASCII and ISO-8859-1, and made ASCII-to-Unicode transcoding an O(1) operation, as it should be. Following on my suggestion, Leo proceeded to implement <code>utf8:unicode:"string"</code> literals that plays well with the existing unescape code.

<p>
I also made ASCII and Unicode's <code>validate</code> detect noncharacters correctly, so there is less chance of accidental double-encoding now.  The mistake of Perl 5's latin1-biased Unicode model must not be repeated in the new era! ;-)</p>
