<p>The pre-release bughunting fest went all day long, amassing over 80 commits and still counting upward. PIR now passes all sanity tests again; the main test suite is down to 2 failed test files.
<p>
Aankhen, Stevan, bsmith, dudley, fglock, gaal, geoffb, iblech, nothingmuch, putter, rafl all chimed in with bugfixes and more test cases.
<p>
putter interviewed me about the imminent, PIL-based "Pugs as the Compiler" change, and put up a writeup in <a href="http://svn.openfoundry.org/pugs/docs/notes/plan">docs/notes/plan</a> which received lots of editing help from geoffb.  If you were wondering what's the Next Big Thing for Pugs development, please check it out -- I think I'll merge it with my (rejected) <a href="http://perlcabal.org/user/autrijus/hw2005.pdf">hw2005 paper</a> to produce the much delayed Pugs Apocryphon 2...</p>

<h2>PIL-to-cpp?</h2>

This is very cool!
Is there any plan to do a PIL-to-Cpp (or C) emitter? Native compilation would be the killer feature in Perl 6 (at least for me). Excuse if the question is dumb! No idea about how XS is being dealt with in Perl 6...

Parrot can generate a native executate from PIR, so once Pugs compiling to Parrot is in place, generating native executables is pretty much there.<br><br>As for XS in Perl 6, as far as running Perl 6 on Parrot goes, Parrot has a native calling interface to easily call into C libraries. So maybe we'll not have XS style things, but simply write a PIR module to directly interface with the required C library.

It's not a dumb question; it's entirely valid.  However, we probably will not have the resource to directly compile to runtime-less C code, since that will mean maintaining a set of primitive functions.
<p>
However if indeed we can target Haskell with PIL, then it is conceivable to generate runtime-less ANSI C via <a href="http://repetae.net/john/computer/jhc/" title="repetae.net">Jhc</a repetae.net>, an experimental Haskell compiler.  This is in its early speculative stage, though.</p>
