<p>So I'm in Zurich airport and (finally) working toward the slides for my talk, cheduled to go on air in 24 hours.
<p>
I'm adopting the <a href="http://www.rubycolor.org/takahashi/thinkinrails/img0.html">Takahashi</a> method, which basically means doing six lightning talks in a row, and somehow string them all back together in the end.  It's fun and very challenging...
<p>
The <a href="http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2005/09/22/onion.html">State of the Onion 9</a> talk transcript is quite entertaining.  I hope to run into other fun amplifiers in ICFP, so the two weeks after that can be optimised to get Pugs 6.2.10 (or even 6.28.0) out in a useful shape in time for Euro OSCON.

<strong>Perl6-MetaModel News</strong>
<p>
Role work is now (mostly) complete. We still need more tests, and there is
still more Class and Role integration planned but not yet implemented. 
<p>
To exercise the meta-model I have ported chromatic's Perl 6 version of 
Test::Builder (complete with tests) to the meta-model. The translation 
was fairly seamless, and even used the meta-model based package system 
instead of Perl 5 packages.  
<p>
You can see it <a href='http://svn.openfoundry.org/pugs/perl5/Perl6-MetaModel2.0/ext/Test-Builder/'>here</a>
and you will find the Perl6 code in the POD documentation for reference.
<p>
<strong>Blondie wants You (pointing finger) to give it more backends</strong>
<p>
Blondie is a side project whose purpose is to prototype some approaches towards
compiling the dynamic/static conglomerate that is Perl 6 into something that
runs efficiently and portably, in as little effort as possible.
<p>
Blondie needs as many backends as possible as early as possible to stress it's
design.
<p>
Blondie is already interpreted in perl, and partially compiled to C (supported
by a primitive type inferrencer), but we want more!
<p>
The backends we're still interested in are:
<p>
<em>Parrot and PIR</em>
<p>
This is what Perl 6 will run on by default, so we better support it
<p>
<em>Other virtual machines, e.g. LLVM, Ruby's YARV, the JVM through Jasmin, C--</em>
<p>
For two reasons:
Running Perl 6 on foreign runtimes designed for high level languages
Learning what VMs look like when targeted uniformly
<p>
<em>GCC's GENERIC</em>
<p>
Although we're already harnessing GCC with the C backend, making a GCC
frontend for Blondie has two interesting aspects: it's higher level than a
VM, so this illustrates AST conversion, and it requires completely manual
memory management
<p>
<em>Other interpreted backends, e.g. JavaScript</em>
<p>
Interpreting approaches are by far the quickest way to get Blondie to run on
strange platforms.  This will stress the way the shared prelude is handled.
<p>
<em>Mock backends</em>
<p>
Harsh environments for a dynamic language, like no IO, hard real time (all
builtins which cannot be realtime are masked from the prelude), etc.
<p>
Please see the todo file for more tasks under perl5/Blondie/TODO in the pugs
repository.
