<div class="span8">
<p>The main ICFP conference session concluded today, so I'm finally getting a
tiny slice of time to write down what I've been doing.

<p>
I enjoyed handing out Perl6/Timeline T-shirts to various lambdafolks,
including bpierce (author of TaPL), spj (author of GHC), as well as several cool
hackers from #haskell.  At any time in the conference hall, there was always
someone with a Pugs shirt in sight, leading to many interesting discussions and
opportunities to join forces.

<p>
I spent much time hacking with the GHC core team (spj and simonmar, also known
as "Simon and Simon"), to get my current #1 feature request -- GADT with record
types -- into GHC.  Among Haskell people, GADTs are all the rage this year; see
<a
href="http://svn.openfoundry.org/pugs/docs/notes/recursive_polymorphism_and_type_inference">luqui's
notes</a> for a short introduction from Perl6's perspective.

<p>
During the YAPC::NA 2005 Toronto hackathon, I presented the then-brand-new
PIL1 data structure to @Larry, using GHC's then-brand-new GADT syntax:
<pre>
data PIL a where
    PCode       :: SubType -> [TParam] -> PIL [Stmt] -> PIL Expression
    PBind       :: [PIL LValue] -> PIL Expression -> PIL LValue
    PAssign     :: [PIL LValue] -> PIL Expression -> PIL LValue
    -- ...etc...
</pre>
luqui looked at it and asked quite innocently: "Why are the arguments
not labelled, such as 'lhs' for 'PAssign'?" -- To which lwall said,
half-jokingly: "Because autrijus is a lazy bastard."

<p>
However, the real reason was because GHC's extended Haskell syntax only allowed
positional argument types for GADT.  To name them with the <em>record
syntax</em>, we'd need to go back to the vanilla data types, and forgo the
ability to encode type information using the constructor's return type (as
demonstrated in <code>PIL Expression</code> and <code>PIL LValue</code> above).

<p>
A month later, I diligently re-encoded the structure using vanilla
record types, so we can export them into hash-based Perl (and JSON) data
structures, instead of array-based ones.  This significantly improved
the readability of iblech's PIL2JS code, but the Haskell data declaration
became 3 times longer, because each GADT variant needs to be re-encoded
into vanilla data types.

<p>
Ever since then, I was hoping that GHC may one day remedy this by allowing
GADTs and record syntax to play together.  When I met spj in ICFP, he was
gladly surprised that I'm eager to hack GHC to make it happen.  After bouncing
several design ideas, we settled on this syntax:
<pre>
data PIL a where
    PCode   { typ :: SubType, params :: [TParam], body :: PIL [Stmt] }
        :: PIL Expression
    PBind   { lhs :: [PIL LValue], rhs :: PIL Expression }
        :: PIL LValue
    PAssign { lhs :: [PIL LValue], rhs :: PIL Expression }
        :: PIL LValue
    -- ...etc...
</pre>

The neat thing is that <code>PBind</code> and <code>PAssign</code> can share
the <code>lhs</code> and <code>rhs</code> labels, as long as their return
value <code>PIL LValue</code> stays the same.

<p>
During the reception, spj was kind enough to guide me through the GHC core to
unify the two data type definitions together back.  The next day, simonmar
walked me through the <a href="http://haskell.org/happy/">Happy</a> parser
to get the new syntax recognized, and today spj showed me how the GHC typechecker
works.   All there's left is installing the labels as record selectors, and the
upcoming GHC 6.6 will have a nice feature to fit Pugs's needs.  Hacking GHC is
evidently not as difficult as I feared! :-)

<p>
Talking about GADTs, I was also involved with the crazy project of encoding the
<a href="http://darcs.net/">Darcs</a> patch algebra into the GADT type system,
letting the compiler catch entire classes of common logic errors in darcs,
bringing us dagerously close to the ideal of proof-carrying code.

<p>
Two days ago, when droundy told me this idea, I was very excited, started
prototyping it, then promptly ran into errors on existential types.  Heffalump
took my laptop and shuffled it with Igloo, arriving at something that seemed to
compile, which evolved into an embedded DSL for patches.  After today's
conference sessions, a dozen darcs hackers gathered together, learned about the
recent developments of the patch theory, then worked on the GADT encoding.
The hacking session was quite successful -- we didn't run into any showstoppers,
much to everybody's surprise -- and I visiolized the whiteboard into this
<a href="http://perlcabal.org/user/autrijus/darcs-gadt.png">diagram</a>.

<p>
On the Pugs backend front, I learned from simonmar the existence of the ILX
emitter library, hiding in a forgotten corner of GHC source tree.  This enables
us to emit pre-CLR-2.0 MSIL code that could run on Mono, under a 3-clause BSD
license.  Targetting CLR suddenly looks more attractive...

<p>
I also learned how to generate native machine code straight from C--, using
the GHC API distributed as part of Lemmih's <a href="http://scannedinavian.org/user/lemmih/ghc-api">ghc-api</a> Cabal package.

<p>
Speaking of Cabal, I learned from SyntaxNinja about the design of the Cabal/Hackage
system, which is the Module::Build/CPAN equivalent for Haskell.  We shared our
experiences, and he helped me setting up the basic Cabal build rules for Pugs.
With Cabal support, Pugs's Makefile.PL would only need to care about the Perl
parts in the source tree, and we can finally get a libPugs to link with pugscc
and other programs -- Inline::GHC is definitely on the radar, and the idea of
using Perl6 to script the Haskell IDE (hIDE) is also gaining some traction.

<p>
Compiling with continuations, another pet interest of mine, also got a boost
from ICFP.  The <a
href="http://www.cs.brown.edu/user/sk/Publications/Papers/Published/pcmkf-cont-from-gen-stack-insp/">Generalized
Stack Inspection</a> talk outlined how to use vanilla <code>try/catch</code>
mechanism to implement full continuations, which is much more efficient than
the regular trampolining approach as used in Pugs's JavaScript backend, since
only people who actually use full continuations need to pay the cost for
<code>catch</code>.  Their technique operates on the ANF form, which seems to
be a good low-level intermediate form for Pugs.

<p>
Interestingly, the paper went as far as saying that Parrot might have made a
suboptimal choice in paying the full cost of going full-CPS, since we could
emulate full continuations using exception handling efficiently.  They gave
concrete implementations in CLR and JVM -- we'll see if this result can carry 
over to Perl5 and JavaScript runtimes.

<p>
The invited talk of the first day tackled impredicative type inferencing, a
long-standing problem in inferring types for a rich system such as Perl6.
I had much trouble grokking the <em>Wobbly Type</em> idea of spj's, so I
was much delighted to see that fpottier gave a very intuitive treatment of
splitting the user-annotation-driven phase and the complete inferencing
phase apart.

<p>
Oh, the ICFP contest.  Haskell won again, which came at no surprise, but
the Dylan Hacker team made another strong showing.  From the brief
investigation, I think Dylan is even closer to the "Perl 6 without
advertisement" mark than Ruby, largely due to its incremental soft
typing system, where one can start rapid prototyping with full dynamism,
then generate more efficient and robust C code by adding type annotations.

<p>
Tomorrow is the Curry workshop, then the Haskell workshop on the day after.
After that I'll get two weeks of Pugs hacking time.  I can barely wait to
apply those new techniques, tools and thoughts into Pugs!

I would just like to say thanks.  I'm glad that there are people out there who understand this stuff AND want to spend there time building pugs and perl6.  I generaly consider myself fairly smart but when i read this compiler theory stuff my eyes just glaze over and my head spins.<br><br>So thanks for taking your time to build pugs and hears hoping you continue to use your power for good!<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)
