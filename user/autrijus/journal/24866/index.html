<div class="span8">
<p>Earlier today, I've posted my Perl 6 (wishlist|todo list) as a <a href="http://perlmonks.org/?node_id=459750">survey</a>.  The responses were very constructive.  My #1 wishlist item is apparently shared by many:
<ul>
<li>An improved Inline::Pugs so I can call Perl 5's DBI.pm from Perl 6 code, and manipulate Perl 6 objects from Perl 5.
</ul>
So, wish help from clkao, we just did it in the last 3 hours. There's many rough edges that will be tested and fixed soon, but this already works:
<pre>
use Digest::SHA1--perl5;

my $cxt = Digest::SHA1.new;
$cxt.add('Pugs!');

# This prints: 66db83c4c3953949a30563141f08a848c4202f7f
say $cxt.hexdigest;
</pre>
<p>
My full wishlist, ordered by descending importance, is reproduced below:

<ol>
<li>An improved Inline::Pugs so I can call Perl 5's DBI.pm from Perl 6 code, and manipulate Perl 6 objects from Perl 5.
<li>A fully working Perl 6 compilation backend to Parrot or C, so Perl 6 can run in a very competitive speed.
<li>A more stable core language definition, with both online and offline documentation.
<li>Unit tests for the language and the "core" modules/pragmas I'd use.
<li>A few really neat Perl 6 modules that simply can't be done in Perl 5.  A robust <a href="http://blogs.inextenso.com/seaside/blog/learning/">Seaside/Halo</a>  implementation that makes Rails/Catalyst pale in comparison; a <a href="http://www.cs.uu.nl/user/daan/parsec.html">combinator library</a> that can be used for <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Template-Toolkit/">formatting</a>, <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Template-Extract/">parsing</a> and <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Template-Generate/">template generation</a>; et cetera.
</li>
<li>Shared introspection, threading and debugging support for Perl 5 and Perl 6, as offered by Ponie.</li>
<li>A translator from Perl 5 code to Perl 6, to ease migration efforts.
<li>...after those, a fully bootstrapped Perl 6 compiler written in Perl 6, and for Larry to call it Perl 6.0.0. :-)
</ol>


<p>
I think I can be excused of not doing the usual summary today.  :-)</p>

<h2>as always</h2>

Very, very impressive!



<h2>darn it</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ajtaylor/">ajtaylor</a> on 2005-05-25T21:07:48</h3>
Now you've got me interested in yet another application framework! And in a language I don't know yet. Just when I thought I could get away with not learning ruby/rails (because of Catalyst), now I have to go learn smalltalk. There goes another time sink...<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br> <br>Thanks for the tip.



<h2>Debugging hooks!</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/mugwumpjism/">mugwumpjism</a> on 2005-05-26T02:58:45</h3>
<p>Don't know why I didn't think of this before, but the thing I miss most about pugs is no <tt>-d</tt>.  Yes, I know that you can use <tt>say</tt> at strategic places, and re-run the program, but I really like interactive debuggers.  Maybe it was all that time spent with DOS <tt>debug</tt> pulling apart my old XT's BIOS and hack 8086 machine code, or the extensive use of <tt>gdb</tt> to debug my C++ programs at university.  I've just always been a debugger person.</p>
