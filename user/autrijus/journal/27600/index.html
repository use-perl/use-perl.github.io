<div class="span8">
<p>Before I departed for Taipei, I had a very fruitful meeting with aevil and jhi, talked about all things CPAN, Unicode, P5/P6 interop, pumpkineering lessons,  et al.
<p>
jhi gave me a heavy book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0201700522">Unicode Demystified</a>, which really made sense to me.  I brought jhi's concerns to #parrot, mainly about the combinatorial explosive danger of introducing charsets other than ASCII/Latin1/Unicode, and the benefit of shifting away from UTF8 as internal encoding, by determining the optimal charset (i.e. 7/8/16/21 bits of Unicode) at PIR compilation time.  Leo seems receptive, but more benchmark number is needed.
<p>
So I returned to .tw, abducted by Unicode Demystified, abused by jetlag (did lots of design work on paper as LCD made me doze off), as well as cleaning up the huge backlog of forgotten/repressed/misremembered commitments.  <p>
Then I was abducted by another fantastic book -- <a href="http://cc2e.com/">Code Complete 2nd Edition</a> -- which convinced me that this whole ten-day yakshaving was actually worth it.
<p>
Happily, my anxiety level now is at its all-time low in ten years, and commitment to Perl6/Pugs at its all-time high in ten months, so that's definitely improvement.  More details later. :-)
