<p>$work took most of my time today.  However, late tonight I caught Stevan
on #perl6, and he guided me through his amazing self-hosting <a href="http://svn.openfoundry.org/pugs/perl5/Perl6-MetaModel/">implementation</a>
of Perl 6's meta-object protocol in Perl 5, so I can port it to Haskell
for the new PIL runcore.

<p>
At the same time, iblech is merging the
<a href="http://svn.openfoundry.org/pugs/perl5/Perl6.MetaModel/">JavaScript
version</a> of metamodel into the PIL2JS runtime, so that backend can have a
reasonable chance of passing (and unexpectedly succeeding) <a href="http://svn.openfoundry.org/pugs/t/oo/">t/oo/</a> tests.

<p>
Meta-object protocol is a lot of fun.  Thanks to Haskell's lazy evaluation
and the builtin yadayada operator (i.e. <code>undefined</code>), I churned out
the first cut of <a href="http://svn.openfoundry.org/pugs/src/PIL/MetaModel.hs">primitive metaobjects</a> relatively quickly.

<p>
To aid my understanding, I drew in lots of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnosticism">Gnosticism</a> metaphors.  For example, the <em>demiurge</em> below is the original <b>Perl6::MetaClass</b>, the root of everything, with its metaclass defined as an instance of itself:

<pre>
-- Perl6::MetaClass - &_build_meta line 1
-- First metaclass by parthenogenesis
demiurge :: Object
demiurge = MkObject{ objClass = cls, objData = dat }
    where
    (fld, dat) = splitMap (gnosis $ MkName undef) -- no $.name
    cls = MkClass{ clsMeta = demiurge, clsFields = fld }
</pre>

<p>
After it consumed the bare-bones class definition in <em>gnosis</em>, we build the archetypical <b>Perl6::Object</b> metaclass from that; it's called <em>pneuma</em>, with its class definition defined in <em>logos</em>, which covers the class methods (<code>new, bless, CREATE, isa, can</code>) and instance methods (<code>BUILDALL, DESTROYALL, isa, can</code>).

<p>
Then we use the <code>_build_meta</code> helper -- conveniently named <em>metamorph</em> in my current code -- to augment <em>demiurge</em> with primitive, internal-only methods (<code>BUILD, is_a, _merge, _create_accessor</code>), plus accessors to the attribute and method tables.  The code that does this reads:

<pre>
-- Bootstrapped MetaClass - suitable for applying to environment
theos :: Object
theos = metamorph demiurge
</pre>

<p>
The final task of this first-step bootstrapping, <em>genesis</em>, merely declares that <em>theos</em> has <em>pneuma</em> as a superclass; that is, the Perl6 MetaClass is itself a Perl6 Object, fully exposed to the userland.  Using this as a base, all primitive runtime constructs can automatically appear as well-behaving objects.  But that's another topic for another day...

<b>Gnosticism</b> in the text is rendered <b>Gnoticism</b>.

<p>
It is lovely seeing all these powerful words inspiring (<cite>pneuma</cite>) life.

But this is only the created life of the flesh (and you are aiming higher than this; Perl is intended to enrich the spirit also: the <cite>rhema</cite> that complements the <cite>logos</cite>). There is <b>more</b>.

He was with God in the beginning.

Through him all things were made; without him nothing was made that has been made.

In him was life, and that life was the light of men.
