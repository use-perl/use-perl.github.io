<p>With nothingmuch's lead, it seems that a good portion of development is now occuring in SubEthaEdit space.  That is exciting news -- here's hope that MoonEdit can work on OSX some day, or (preferably) DocSynch or any of the many SEE-clone projects can finally deliver us from the multiplayer <code>cat</code> (IRC) age into the multiplayer <code>notepad</code> age.
<p>
Today saw 50+ commits by 10+ committers, which is at least twice the number I've been used too. Maybe I'll get used to it gradually... *grin* Anyway, here's some of the developments happened today:
<ul>
<li>Stevan, nothingmuch &amp; co worked on a <em>test cataloging</em> script, an important technology that will cross-reference the Synopses with the coverage in unit tests. It will let us better visualize the untested/unimplemented parts of Synopses better, hopefully with minimal burden on test writers.
<li>malaire tested, implemented, refactored, and simplified the <code>index</code> primitive.
<li>Darren Duncan turned <code>Algorithm::Dependency</code> into a Perl 6 module in just a few hours, including the entire test suite. Wow!
<li>lightstep, our prolific lambdafolk, cleaned up the source tree and hacked the interactive Shell; now lexical variables is preserved across lines, so we can now do this:
<pre>
pugs> my $x = 1
1
pugs> $x
1
</pre>
</pre>
<li>As more and more people are building Pugs with GHC 6.4, lightstep, theorbtwo and I worked on silencing warnings and fixing dvergin's <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/dvergin/journal/23656">build failure</a>.
<li>mugwump started working on a Kwid spec; ingy moved core kwid documentations into <code>ext/Pugs-Documentation/</code>.
<li>scw cleaned up some tests and elaborated on the precedence problem around <code>?? ::</code>. This leads to...
<li>...I finally checked in the code to parse <code>?? ::</code> correctly, thanks to scw's analysis and the advice from kosmikus. Here is a short <a href="http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl6.compiler/353">write-up</a>  of the approach.
<li>Thomas Yeh reported that <code>pugscc</code> was broken on case-sensitive filesystems, because I misspelled <code>MainCC.hs</code> as <code>MainCc.hs</code>. I fixed it, and it now works; we can finally make stand-alone AIX executables from Perl 6 code to deploy into production!
<li>I have implemented the <code>true</code> primitive, which is to <code>?</code> what <code>not</code> is to <code>!</code>. Everyone on <code>#perl6</code> disliked the operator name; after some <a href="http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl6.language/19702">discussion</a> on p6l, Larry suggested <code>so</code>, which I happily implemented.
<li>I fixed <code>last</code> so it no longer conflicts with <code>return</code>, and simplified the control flow considerably. All hail <code>callCC</code>!
<li>gaal checked in many, many TODO tests; nothingmuch cleaned up many of them, and many besides. We have 1659 tests now.
<li>ingy makes Pugs installable on systems that did not install Perl5 into a path that contains <code>perl</code>.
<li>Pugs was numifying <code>"0xFF"</code> as 255; that was arguably the wrong behaviour. After some discussions with pmichaud, we settled on only numifying digits and the dot, ignoring everything else; that means <code>"1e2f3g4"</code> is now numified as 1, not as 100. Larry has since expressed <a href="http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl6.compiler/356">the DWIMmier</a> view, so that may change tomorrow. :)
</ul>
<p>
So, that's it for today. See you tomorrow!</p>

I am still unable to build pugs , I have put the details here

Aye. nmake seems to come in many flavors and ingy's MakeMaker magic seems to upset some of them. Please send <code>Makefile</code> and <code>ext/Kwid/Makefile</code> over and we'll try to fix it.  Alternatively, find a Module::Build guru to help us...<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

2005/3/15 - 8/1658 subtests failed, 99.52% okay.
