<p>Today there has been 32 commits in the repository, but only 5 were mine. bsmith, Stevan, smpeters, along with two new committers nnunley and duff, has implemented many things among themselves:
<ul>
<li>Test.pm receives skip(), plan(), fail(), todo_fail() and pass(); those functions were subsequently refactored to avoid duplicate code.
<li>Lots of unit tests has been converted to use Test.pm.
<li>James Mastros submitted a helpful patch to show svn patchlevel as part of Pugs version string.
<li>New and improved tests for various language features, including multidimensional arrays, push() and more.
<li>New examples: fisher-yates shuffle and send+more=money solver.
<li>Support for while/until loops.
<li>The int() primitive.
<li>Imported synopses as t/Synopsis/* as a beginning to POD-based acceptance tests.
</ul>
<p>
In other news, Pugs was mentioned on <a href="http://sequence.complete.org/node/21">The Haskell Sequence</a> today. Indeed, I have noted that a significant part of questions asked in #haskell are from camelfolks. Conversely, we saw a large influx from lambdafolks to #perl6 as well. Lots of knowledge transfer is happening, which makes me really happy.
<p>
So, I have finally sorted out most of the non-technical questions from the large question list, and produced a <a href="http://pugscode.org/pa1draft3.html">draft version</a> of Pugs Apocryphon 1. It needs more work (especially on the two paragraphs about Apocalypses and Synopses), but it is a start. 
<p>
I'll merge the mess that is the technical-oriented questions tomorrow.  Please Feel free to submit more questions, or comment on the draft above. Enjoy!</p>

<h2>Monads in Perl</h2>

If there are a lot of new people coming to Haskell from Perl, they might find my <a href="http://sleepingsquirrel.org/monads/monads.html" title="sleepingsquirrel.org">Monads in Perls</a sleepingsquirrel.org> tutorial helpful.  There's also an example of <a href="http://sleepingsquirrel.org/monads/parser/monad_parser.txt" title="sleepingsquirrel.org">monadic parser combinators</a sleepingsquirrel.org> (in perl).  Heck, might as well plug my perlmonks node about <a href="http://perlmonks.org/?node_id=428733" title="perlmonks.org">infinite lazy lists</a perlmonks.org> (also in perl, of course) as long as we're at it.

Whoa, Parsec in Perl5! You are truly an amazing soul.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-) Hmm, I wonder if we can redo Perl6::Rules by translating Rules to Parsec primitives (which is part of what Pugs is going to do), and then translate it to your monad parser.  Sounds sick...
