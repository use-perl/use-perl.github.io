<p>Wow, I'm still alive after this tumulous week, which featured not one but <em>three</em> met-at-the-final-minute deadlines, a rescheduled and forced-upgraded plane ticket, my passport stuck in limbo for three days due to DHL system errors, and of course even more hardware failures.
<p>
At long last I'll be able to catch some sleep now, wake up and board the plane, step off it and sleep for a few hours, then immediately step up to speak in <a href="http://galois.com/cufp/">CUFP</a>, with nary a page of slides in sight (or in mind).  Wish me luck, as I'd need it very much...

<strong>Perl6-MetaModel News</strong>
<p>
Some re-arranging has been done, <code>::Object</code> now shares <code>pneuma.pl</code> with 
<code>::Package</code> and <code>::Module</code>, while <code>::Role</code> has been moved to the new 
psyche.pl file. This means that <code>genesis.pl</code> is concerned simply with
bootstrapping things, and nothing more. 
<p>
The Role work is progressing slowly becuase of $work. However, we have 
added pictures (<a href='http://svn.openfoundry.org/pugs/perl5/Perl6-MetaModel2.0/docs/p6_role_model.jpg'>p6_role_model.jpg</a>) and there is some general thoughts/comments in <a href='http://svn.openfoundry.org/pugs/perl5/Perl6-MetaModel2.0/lib/psyche.pl'>psyche.pl</a>
as to how the bootstrapping will actually work.
<p>
We recently added a test which implements the inside-out style of 
objects within the meta-model. This basically shows that the meta
model is capable of itself hosting other models.
<p>
Basic support (read: very experimental) for parameterized classes
has been added recently. This is implemented entirely on the "macro"
level, and not actually part of the meta-model itself. Here is an
example of how it is used:
<p>
<pre>
my $Scalar = class 'Scalar' => [ '::T' ] => sub {
    my %params = @_;
    my $T = $params{'::T'};
    
    $::CLASS->add_method('STORE' => ::make_method(sub {
        my ($self, $value) = @_;
        $value->isa($T->name) or die "Incorrect Type";
        # ... store the value here 
    }));
};
</pre>
At this point <code>$Scalar</code> is not actually a <code>Class</code> instance, but more a 
<code>Class</code> instance factory (actually it's a <code>CODE</code> ref). Here is how it
is used:
<p>
<pre>
my $Int = class 'Int' => {};
my $ScalarInt = $Scalar->('::T' => $Int) 
</pre>
Now <code>$ScalarInt</code> is actually an instance of Class parameterized to 
only accept Int objects. For a working version of this example see
<a href='http://svn.openfoundry.org/pugs/perl5/Perl6-MetaModel2.0/t/32_parameterized_classes.t'>32_parameterized_classes.t</a>.
</p>

<h2>Parameterized Classes and Types</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/chromatic/">chromatic</a> on 2005-09-21T19:14:10</h3>
<p>Is the check for the type actually an <code>isa()</code> check or is it a <code>does()</code> check?  I think it should be the latter, but I don't know if you're that far in the code yet or if anyone's banged his shoe on the desk and said "Allomorphism matters!"</p>

Ouch! stop hitting me with the shoe!

<p>
Actually that check really should be (and eventually will be) a <code>does()</code>, however at the time of that writing Roles were not yet complete enough to be used in that manner.
