<p>At the town hall meeting, the organizer rdice made fun of the lambdacamel table, where lwall, stevan, nothingmuch and luqui are still hacking madly, largely oblivious what happens on stage. :-)
<p>
After the town hall meeting -- I'm told that Andy mentioned Pugs and it got an ovation, but I sadly missed it -- we moved to my room to continue hacking.  Stevan finished a less hacky model of Perl 6 object space in Perl 5, so I can finally start porting it to Haskell; we figured out ways to encode Pad in PIL, and nothingmuch/luqui switched to <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Code-Perl/">Code::Perl</a> instead of PPI for the codegen.
<p>
We also got some really amazing people trying out Pugs: drolsky is trying to rethink his DateTime API in Pugs, and coke (of ParTcl fame) committed the long-sought message in Makefile.PL that warns OSX 10.4 users that they need a gcc_select 3.3 before running <em>make</em>.
<p>
chromatic and I worked for an hour to get down to the weird bug that reverts the instance attribute in in <code>submethod BUILD (?$.x=3) { $.x=4 }</code> to its binding value.  I joked that I need to get to the bottom of this, or I'll commit <em>seppuku</em> -- and promptly traced it down to see that a single <code>return</code> will fix it, but falling through the block won't -- however I was stuck there, so I'm forced to commit <code>seppuku.hs</code> (to my local svk branch). Oh well, at least we hacked in useful stuff like <code>$obj.perl</code>. I'll get to the object alligator when I get enough sleep...
<p>
...but chromatic promptly fixed it with a two-lines patch.  It turns out his original implementation runs the parameter-defaulting code <em>after</em> the body, so of course it broke -- but it's all good now. :-)
<p>
Showstoppers for 6.2.8:
<ul>
<li>Prelude.pm needs to be precompiled -- it's too slow to load it. 10x slowdown for a new release cancels all our optimization work in the past few releases. :-/
<li>Fix qualified name lookup that broken Darren's Locale::KeyedText
<li>Of course, solve all the regressions... which is going quite well already.
</ul></p>
