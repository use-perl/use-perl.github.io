<p>Today has been really really crazily full of Pugs events and developments, even by the breakneck Pugs standard, and I can't possibly summarize them all. So just some short links:
<ul>
<li>Mad Golfer asavige ported the original Golf test program into Perl 6, and wrote a <a href="http://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=440685">summary</a> about his findings.
<li>Shortly before he posted it to PerlMonks, asavige asked on p6l about how best to slurp a file in Perl 6. I promptly <a href="http://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=440685">implemented</a> the <code>slurp()</code> builtin for him.
<li>Larry <a href="http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl6.compiler/396">made fun</a> of my incessant use of <a href="http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl6.compiler/389">Woot</a>. I feel honoured. :)
<li>malaire, nothingmuch, gaal and stevan of the test squad kept churning out tests; a <a href="http://pugs.kwiki.org/?Perl6Testing">better layout</a> for the <code>t/</code> directory is being worked out just now.
<li>masak reported that <code>hanoi.p6</code> produces weird results. It turns out that in binding <code>sub foo ($a, $b)</code>, the <code>$a</code> is being seen from the expression bound to <code>$b</code>; this bug was caused by the support for <code>sub foo ($a, ?$b = $a)</code>. Now only the defaulting for optional args can see the earlier bound parameters.
<li>My <a href="http://colabti.de/irclogger/irclogger_log/perl6?date=2005-03-18,Fri&sel=1079#l1797">Pugs hacking walkthrough</a> on #perl6 for masak may be of interest to aspiring Pugs hackers. Some of it is likely appear in PA02 in a more concise form.
<li>Ingy refactored our <code>Makefile.PL</code> to be less insane, but made it break for earlier MakeMakers, so we now require MakeMaker 6.17 or later. Much kudos to gaal for spending tons of time tracking this down!
<li>The Unicode problem has been resolved; I switched to Dimitry Golubov's code (the same codebase as the upcoming GHC 6.4.1), and it now works across all platforms.  I have also added <code>-O</code> to Eval and Unicode modules, so a normal Pugs executable should now be up to 5x faster.
<li>I applied lightstep's massive refactoring patch to make <code>:=</code> binding produce <em>thunks</em> (evaluations that remembers its original environment). So lvalue binding now works consistently, and the symbol table no longer contains Exps -- it's all Vals now.
<li>malarie implemented <code>substr</code>; jworthington implemented ASCII versions of hyper operators; stevan finished porting <code>File::Spec</code> , except for the VMS part, but I don't think GHC runs on VMS anyway...
<li>Darren continues to make <code>Locale::KeyedText</code> more idiomatically p6ish; so far all p6ification works have resulted in fruitful p6l discussions, often causing healthy <a href="http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl6.language/19796">rule 2</a> invocations. Nice!
<li>Speaking of rule 2, Larry's <a href="http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl6.language/19821">sleepy brain</a> came up with a truly ingenious idea to fix the <code>$self.method vs $_.method</code> dilemma, namely to introduce <code>o</code> for the current object and <code>c</code> for the current (dynamic) class. I think it is really the best solution I have seen so far, but p6l is still hashing it out and Larry seems about to change his mind again, so maybe it will become something even better.
<li>Oh and I'm going to <a href="http://yapc.org/America/register-2005.shtml">YAPC::NA 2005</a> in Toronto. Hope to see you there! (and no, I'm not going to OSCON. I'm highly interested in EurOSCON, though.)
</ul>
<p>
Whew. I don't think I've covered more than half of today's developments. But I must sleep now. <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/jesse/">obra</a> will arrive in less than 24 hours...</p>
