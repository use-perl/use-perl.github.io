<div class="span8">
<p>After much help from TheHunter and skew in #haskell, I have finished the
new definition of Pugs's main <code>Eval</code> monad.  Curiously, it uses all
four structure declaration statements in Haskell:

<pre>
type Eval x = EvalT (ContT Val (ReaderT Env SIO)) x
newtype EvalT m a = EvalT { runEvalT :: m a }
data SIO a = MkSTM (STM a) | MkIO (IO a) | MkSIO a
class (MonadReader Env m, MonadCont m, MonadIO m, MonadSTM m) => MonadEval m
</pre>

<p>
As yesterday's journal indicated, the key idea behind this restructuring is that
we can safely use both <code>liftSTM</code> (for in-memory variable access) and
<code>liftIO</code> (for input/output with the external world) primitives, and
mix them freely in a normal <code>runIO</code> evaluator:

<pre>
runIO :: SIO a -> IO a
runIO (MkIO io)     = io
runIO (MkSTM stm)   = atomically stm
runIO (MkSIO x)     = return x
</pre>

However, inside a <code>atomic {}</code> block, <code>runSTM</code> is used
instead, so <code>atomic { say "Hello" }</code> will trigger an exception:

<pre>
runSTM :: SIO a -> STM a
runSTM (MkSTM stm)  = stm
runSTM (MkIO _ )    = fail "Unsafe IO caught in STM"
runSTM (MkSIO x)    = return x
</pre>

Although I had not got around to expose the <code>atomic</code> primitive,
the restructured <code>SIO</code> structure has already improved performance
dramatically (again):

<pre>
<obra> autrijus?
<obra> What the hell changed in the last 12 hours with pugs?
<autrijus> hi. schwern made all our :todo fail.
<autrijus> or rather, all the force_todo fail
<autrijus> so you should see red.
<autrijus> don't panic :)
<autrijus> "env PUGS_RELEASE=1 make smoke"
<autrijus> will give the original green one.
<obra> no. I mean it smoked 30% faster
<autrijus> obra: oh. yeah. I rewrote the monad
</pre>

<p>
Another big news today is I have largely rewritten the <code>Statements</codE>
structure and associated <code>Exp</code> types; each token in the parse stream
is now assigned <em>ranges</em>, for a much better diagnostics output:

<pre>
$ ./pugs -e 'die "Hello, World!"'
*** Error: Hello, World! at -e line 1, column 1-20
</pre>

Note the column range above; multi-line constructs are also handled correctly.
Much thanks to gaal for keep prodding me with his <code>#line</code> patch,
and for reporting various breakage in the old, statement-level position handling
scheme.

<p>
In other news, Larry invoked a <a href="http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl6.language/20705">Rule 2</a> today on S02: during array/hash slicing, outside context is now no longer propagated to index expressions.  This resolves the problem encountered by Juerd and me a few days ago; Pugs has been fixed to adopt the new semantic.

<p>
As the IRC log above indicated, Schwern fixed our <code>Test.pm</code> so force_todo failures are still reported as failures during normal development.  To inhibit them, one must set the <code>PUGS_RELEASE</code> environment variable to a true value.  Stevan is still working toward a better way to replace force_todo, perhaps based on a multi-level todo notation like <code>:todo&lt;bug&gt;</code> and <code>:todo&lt;feature&gt;</code>...

<p>
theorbtwo valiantly hacked forward on adding <em>Haddock</em> support to Pugs, but kept running into Haddock limitations against newer GHC features (e.g. GADTs).  The current plan is to write a simple translator to convert our <code>.hs</code> files to Haddock-complaint <code>.hpp</code> files, while minimizing the information loss.

<p>
Aside from hacking on <code>#line</code> support, gaal ported Pugs to Cygwin, although the .msi version of GHC is still needed. 

<p>
Corion and iblech unTODOed and cleaned up various tests as usual; bsb reported that the current CVS version of GHC 6.5 already contained the same copy of <code>Unicode.hs</code> as our own, causing conflicting symbols.  This is now fixed.

<p>
That's it for today. See you tomorrow!

I had a chuckle on that one. hehe</p>
