<p>The YAPC::NA hackathon did fill up quickly.  We have 10 people now: jmm, chip, tdl, stevan, pmichaud, luqui, lwall, theorbtwo, castaway, autrijus.  As there are only rooms for 3 more people, please <a href="http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl6.compiler/514">let our host know</a> if you'd like to go.

<p>
I've spent many hours today on various false starts regarding ITypes, trying to do clever dispatches based on Parrot's PerlArray/PerlScalar/PerlHash PMC mode.  Sadly, I have come to the realization that the semantic for ITypes seems to be exactly the same as the Perl 5 model, their only difference being the possibility of multiple mix-in ITypes on the same variable, as well as the auto-referencing bit.
<p>
However, with tremendous amount of help from Stevan in forms of tests, I have at least got the value part working, so this <a href="http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl6.compiler/516">small example</a> from asavige runs correctly now. Yay!
<p>
Also fixed is the <code>undef $x</code> bug (<code>undef</code> was not declared as <code>is rw</code>), reported and tested by ninereason; he have also added various lvalue related tests.
<p>
Stevan reported that in <code>sub foo (+$x = 3, +$y = 4)</code>, the comma is parsed as part of the default for <code>$x</code>.  I'm not sure how to deal with it rigorously, so I have simply removed <code>,</code> from the parser for default parameter values.
<p>
Stevan also asked for <code>is rw</code> support in parameter declarations, which I promptly implemented.  Now he wants <code>is copy</code>... Any takers?
<p>
The trailing comma (and redundant comma anywhere) is finally parsed correctly.  Building on that, I have implemented this idea of Larry's:
<pre>
    @a[0]  = expr();    # scalar context to expr()
    @a[0,] = expr();    # list context to expr()
</pre>
<p>
Ovid suggested (and luqui confirmed) that <code>say</code> and <code>print</code> should default to <code>$_</code>, and I implemented as such.  Shortly after, I was surprised to see that Damian updated <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Perl6-Say/">Perl6::Say</a> to do the same thing, which marks his first upload in a year.  Welcome back, Damian!
<p>
Gruber sent in a patch to make <code>$*PID</code> work on *nix systems; I gladly applied it. gaal committed a few tests for the yet-unimplemented <code>next</code> primitive.
<p>
Two more days for Pugs work until the scheduled 6.2.0 release.  Stay tuned!
</p>

<h2>Minor Correction</h2>

CPAN uploads is one of the many places I lurk - Damian actually uploaded version 0.03 of Perl6::Say only a month ago, so he has had 2 uploads in the last year.<br> <br>Cheers,<br>L~R
