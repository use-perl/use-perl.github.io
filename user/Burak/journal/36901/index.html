<p><p>I don't know how long I've been a user in use Perl, but this is my first journal entry. Yay! :)</p>

<p>I've released <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Sys-Info/">Sys::Info</a> 0.60 today. It's a milestone version that has mostly compatible Linux & Windows & Unknown (Generic) drivers. Windows OS driver now supports Windows Server 2008 and a lot of other Windows editions too. Windows Server 2008 support was a little bit tricky since Microsoft did not bump the version number with this os release (unlike Server 2003) and it has the same version number as Windows Vista. It is only detectable through the editions.</p>

<p>For the Windows driver, my original plan was to drop WMI interface and use Win32::API, however I've dropped Win32::API idea in favor of XS and WMI turned out to be some huge beast that can not be duplicated easily (or not at all). I was lost on MSDN on this subject :p</p>

<p>Linux driver also has improved OS support too. I've implemeted several OS meta keys and also tried to mimic the "Edition" information for distros. Currently, only Ubuntu is supported by the edition() method.</p>

<p>There is also a new cdkey() function to return the cdkeys for the OS and Office software. You can guess that this only has a meaning and only implemeted in the Windows driver :) It's basically a shortcut to learn the cdkey quickly in case you need it. Original code for that was taken from a PerlMonks thread.</p>

<p>There are some improvements on the CPU detection side too. Hyper Threading detection is improved and it now returns the number of threads if Hyper Threading is in effect. Also, the data structure now has the "architecture" key. However the load() method has a caveat it returns the current CPU usage instead of the load average (which does not exist in Windows anyway).</p>

<p>Sys::Info was initiated back in 2004 while I was supposed to write down my undergraduate thesis some time late at night (3 am Eternal :p) and evolved from that. The idea was to display the OS & CPU name (and HTTP Server name) correctly in a CMS system I was (and still -- I'm lazy --) working on, but this thing resulted with a  module suite. The first CPAN release was two years later from that... </p>

<p>I'm trying to create a single and mostly equal interface between the OS specific drivers for system information but it turned out that this is not as easy as I thought back then. </p>

<p>Future plans:</p>
<ul>
   <li> Improving current drivers (Windows/Linux/Unknown).</li>
        <ul><li>- Maybe split the drivers into their own distros.</li></ul>
   <li> Creating a separate distro for Sys::Info::Device::BIOS</li>
   <li> Adding support for some other devices</li>
   <li> Create a mechanism for drop-in driver/device system.</li>
   <li> (In a far far future) Create a *BSD driver (which I didn't even use once 'till now)</li>
   <li> (In a far far future) If (somehow) I can have access to a Mac(book(\s?Pro|)?); create a MacOSX (darwin?) driver</li>
</ul>

<p>
Patches & Suggestions are welcome as always :)

<h2>Linux::Distribution spoils the party</h2>

<p>L::D crashes during testing under Debian, and after that it all downhill. See existing RT ticket for details.</p>

L::D has many bugs but the last update to that module is from 2006. I can't currently test Debian though<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) Anyway, the bug you reported is related to my dumb version checker test, which seems unsuitable for Sys::Info. I should have released another underscore version before 0.60<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:p Thanks for reporting.

No they are not meant to be the same. 0.61 also addresses this issue<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
