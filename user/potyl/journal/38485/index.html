<p><p><a href="http://use.perl.org/user/jozef">Jozef</a> brought me the big news today: <a href="http://www.debian.org/News/2009/20090214">Debian GNU/Linux 5.0 released</a> (<i>Lenny</i>). Congratulations to the Debian team. I'm looking forward for the next release. Don't forget to improve the <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=497038">speed of apt-file</a> ;)
</p>

<p>
Inspired by the majestic release of Debian, I was compelled to make a release of Xacobeo. This new release addresses a nasty bug: the application crashes when opening non XML files. It never occurred to me to open something else than an XML file (except for HTML). But an user did try it and reported the results (Segmentation Fault), it is now fixed.</p>

<p>This new release makes Xacobeo reentrant, that's right you can now read Xacobeo's source code with Xacobeo. Actually, this is misleading as nothing will be displayed as Xacobeo's source code is not a valid document. But at least Xacobeo will no longer crash.
</p>

<p>Speaking about opening non XML files. This week at work a colleague wanted to edit an existing HTML file and to save the results so he came to ask me about XPath, which he doesn't know. I showed him how XPath worked and he was quite impressed by the technology. Of course I tried to display the HTML document with Xacobeo but the document wasn't valid and a big chunk was missing. I replaced a single <code>parse_file()</code> by <code>parse_html_file()</code> and Xacobeo could handle HTML! I have to give XML::LibXML and libxml2 all credit for this. Of course, Xacobeo doesn't support yet HTML but in a near future I'm planning to implement this.
