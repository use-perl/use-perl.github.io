<p><p>The summer is almost over and I didn't realized it! This year was full of adventures and surprises.</p>

<p>It all started when I accepted a job at <a href="http://www.booking.com/">booking.com</a> and joined the team in June. New company, new town and new country! All while my wife stayed in Bratislava, pregnant with our first baby!</p>

<p>Then there where the many flights to Bratislava during the weekends. Luckily Sky Europe had a cheap Amsterdam/Vienna connection. I've said <i>had</i> because the company is no more as it died one week ago. Everyone saw this coming: flights started to be delayed, then flights where operated by other companies, afterward flights where redirected to Bratislava (that was actually nice for me) and then flights got canceled.
</p>

<p>I didn't mind too much having my flights delayed of a couple of hours. Now that I have git, being disconnected is no longer a problem. This gives me a good way of passing my time: Open Source. Thanks to git I was still able to hack and to commit code from the airport while I was monitoring the next delay (yes flight schedules where that bad that delays where delayed). Once I arrived home all that I needed was to push my changes and voila!.</p>

<p>Not only did I get to fly to Bratislava I also managed to go to YAPC::EU 09. That's something that I wasn't expecting as I just joined Booking.com! Once more the flights where delayed and a lot, luckily I wasn't alone this time as daxim and pepl where in the same flight. This YAPC was great and I had the chance to see some old friends that you only get to meet from YAPC to YAPC.
</p>

<p>Finally, I'm made it back to Bratislava last week. Just in time for assisting to the birth of our first baby! Laurita was born last Thursday and I'm now going to visit her and her mother to the hospital as often as possible. While the family is being monitored and recovering at the hospital daddy is working from home and still hacking during the weekend. I know that very soon my random hacking during the weekends and evenings will be postponed for a while, but it's going to be worth it! I'm looking forward to have my whole family back under one single roof.
