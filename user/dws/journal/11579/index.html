<div class="span8">
<p>Three friends, each unknown to the others, have told me that they've had to resort to packet traces to debug Samba on RH8. Two of them learned about packet traces specifically to debug their Samba configurations.
<p>
All three, independently, discovered that you have to punch a hole (3, actually) through the default RH8 firewall, but only one managed to restrict that hole to his local network.
<p>
One is still trying to figure out why Samba is making external DNS requests to resolve local names. I am still working through why some combinations of machines see each other, but others don't.
<P>
A small part of this is a RedHat problem -- their firewall folks aren't talking to their Samba folks. Or, if they are, they've left clues that are very difficult for mere mortals to find. Is this any better in RH9?
<p>
I suppose there are Samba issues in the mix, though there's nothing I can point with certainty.
<p>
But by far, the majority of the wierdnesses that friends and I have had to deal with have been Microsoft issues. Win98 doesn't behave quite like Win2K, which doesn't behave quite like WinXP (which doesn't always seem to behave like itself).
<p>
Does anyone have a good source of Samba tips that includes WinXP issues?
