<p>My new cell phone reports 5.2Mb free. That's more total amount of memory my college had when I graduated.

I'm dusting off my Perl fu after several months on a J2EE project. We've got a bunch of repetitive, schema-based code to be generated, and Java just aint the right tool. J2EE can be painful. On the other hand, a lot of Test Driven and Test First Design has been done in Java. I'm picking up lots of tricks.

<h2>generating Java</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/lachoy/">lachoy</a> on 2003-07-27T15:50:51</h3>
I did a short <a href="http://www.cwinters.com/programming/yapc-2003-codegen/" title="cwinters.com">talk</a cwinters.com> on generating Java with Perl at YAPC::NA 2003. No code to share, but one of the main things to build into a code generation system is customization. Too many generation systems assume that they can handle everything you need, which is silly. You'll always need to customize the objects, even if it's just shortcuts save some keystrokes and bits of sanity here and there. We solved this by having the generated classes subclass custom (abstract) classes if they existed.

<p>I hope to write this up in an article form in the near future...</p>



<h2>Device memory</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/grantm/">grantm</a> on 2003-07-28T09:31:40</h3>
Each of my last three home PC upgrades (XT =&gt; 486 =&gt; P100 =&gt; P4-2.4) has given me a system with more video RAM than the previous system had total RAM.

I remember reading, several years ago, a question in a tech advice column in a computer mag from someone who wondered whether there was any way to use video RAM as general-purpose RAM.<br> <br>Apparently, he had bought a new graphics card and now had more memory on that than on his mainboard (I think back then the numbers were 8 MB vs 4 MB, or something like that).
