<p>I switched off of Emacs a bunch of years back after most of the vendors moved the meta key into an awkward position. But after a few days pair programming with a proficient Emacs user, it's clear that I'm going to have to dust off the old muscle memory. What finally pushed me over the edge was watching his Emacs do a CVS history of a file, with each line color coded by age, and stamped with the last author and edit date. I'm not aware of a way to do that with vi/vim.<br/><br/></p>

<h2>Emacs - a bright shiny object!</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/merlyn/">merlyn</a> on 2004-04-08T09:30:42</h3>
Emacs is a relatively-easy-to-program generic user interface manager for curses-based and X11-based displays.  Lots and lots and lots of specific useful applications have been written for it.
<p>
Oh yeah, and I hear there's an editor buried in there somewhere. {grin}
</p><p>
On a practical note, if you haven't hacked emacs in a while, the newer X11 goodies are nice, and the customization guides can help with almost all useful tweaks now. Very little<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.emacs stuff any more.</p>

After nearly four years with it I can't imagine using emacs for extended periods of time without my <a href="http://www.kinesis-ergo.com/us_versions.htm" title="kinesis-ergo.com">Kinesis</a kinesis-ergo.com> -- Ctrl/Alt at your thumbs, where they belong!

One of the developers here has a Kinesis. I'll give it a try, but have to admit that certain parts of my anatomy retract at the thought.

It takes a while to get used to it (give yourself a few days), but once you're acclimated it's amazing. The only problem with the keyboard is it's really bad for gaming, if you're into that sort of thing.

<h2>xmodmap</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/bluto/">bluto</a> on 2004-04-08T15:49:09</h3>
If you are on some unix variant, xmodmap may help with the key location.  It's a bit arcane, but it allows me to add alternate ctrl/alt keys (e.g. I don't really need a caps lock key so I have an extra ctrl key), which are usable in my shell as well.
