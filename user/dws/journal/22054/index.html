New Mexico really does have an <a href="http://www.itsatrip.org/abqinfo/faq/">Official State Question</a>. The question, which you'll get asked in many places when you order local food, is "red or green?" 
The question asks which of the two common chile pepper sauces you'd like with your food. (New Mexico offers some truly yummy chile peppers, which turn into truly yummy sauces.) The common responses are "red", "green", and "Christmas". The latter response asks for a bit of each. Countering with "which is hotter|better today?" is also acceptable.

When I saw the hint about two colours this morning, I guessed "red or green", but that was a random jump from the Mexican flag (skipping white).  My second thought was "orange and green", but that would be for a region with an Irish background. ("Oh, it was the biggest mixup, that you have ever seen.  Me father he was orange and me mother she was green.")  Chile peppers were the furthest things from my thoughts, though.
