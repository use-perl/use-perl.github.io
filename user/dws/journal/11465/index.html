<p>Comes the time in most parts of the U.S. when clocks get set forward an hour. A few clocks are smart, and will reset themselves. The rest need to be located (some hide in subtle places) and adjusted manually. It's a twice-a-year excuse to resynchronize all clocks. In California, dialing POPCORN is the standard trick for getting the correct time.
<p>
I grew up in the Midwest. Every year at this time there would be an angry letter-to-the-editor from some dairy farmer, complaining that the Daylight Savings Time switchover confused his cows, and why couldn't the Gubmint stop meddling.

Sometimes I want to send one of those angry letters too, complaining that the switch confuses the computers, especially when I'm trying to deal with timestamps on files in a mixed Linux-Windows environment (Windows has the idiotic idea that all timestamps should change for DST).  Not to mention not being able to set daily cron jobs for times between 01:00 and 03:00.<br> <br>The whole idea is a bit stupid.  If people want to get up earlier, they should just get up earlier.  No need to mess with the clocks.

You can avoid the cron issue to some extent by keeping your system time in GMT and setting the TZ environment variable to display times in the time zone of your choice.

<p>I'm on the farmers' side.  I grew up in a country that didn't have Daylight Savings, then spent my first eight years in the US in Indiana, which also doesn't observe Daylight Savings.  I hate the twice-yearly ritual of giving ourselves jet lag by screwing up our clocks.</p>
We're in the daylight time zone for seven months out of the year, so presumably we like it better.  I don't mind going to work when it's dark, and I prefer it to be light when I come home.  So can't we just keep it all year?
<p>As you can tell, the time change makes me cranky.  Bah.</p>

Apparently the US did have <a href="http://webexhibits.org/daylightsaving/f.html" title="webexhibits.org">daylight saving time for most of the year</a webexhibits.org> during the oil crisis in the 1970s.  All-year DST sounds fine to me.
