<p>I've used the time between jobs to do a lot of reading, and have gotten into the habit of leaving books scattered around the house, so that wherever I am, I can pick one up and read a few pages. As my wife reminds me, things that way have gotten just a little bit out of hand. I'll spare you a long list of titles, other than to note that <i>The Python Cookbook</i> is in the bathroom reading stack, and that the token work of fiction, Patrick O'Brian's <i>The Surgeon's Mate,</i> is on the bedside table. A quick count shows 15 books in progress, for some definition of "progress", and another 6 in the immediate queue (i.e., in an active pile).
<p>
This qualifies me as a piker in some camps, but for someone who has typically kept no more than 5 books going at a time, the raw numbers warrant a careful review of habits.
<p>
Now to count the number "active" projects... :(

<h2>too many books</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jdavidboyd/">jdavidboyd</a> on 2003-04-15T02:04:57</h3>
Yes, I have this problem too...<br>
I usually have 10 to (at the most) 30 books/magazines (science fiction, fact, and trade/computer magazines (ACM queue is the latest)) laying around, in various states of 'perusal'.<br>  My wife doesn't like clutter, so I try to keep them neat, but it doesn't work very well.<br>  I've got it down to 2-3 mountains of reading material, and she seems to be content with that (luckily for me).<br> Of course, that is, as long as they are out of sight, as in, in my office, by the bed (my side, down low), and in the 'library'.<br>
