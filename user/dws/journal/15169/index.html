<p>Round one includes a surprisingly simple "prove you can code in Perl and C" exercise, at a very nice, wall-to-wall whiteboard. Round two, several days later, is in the same room. The code on the whiteboard (for the same exercise) is different. Glancing at it during the course of the interview, I spot one outright bug, and then notice that whoever wrote the code didn't understand autovivification. And they didn't anchor a regex.
<p>
What would you do in this situation? Would you mention it to the interviewer? Why (or why not)?</p>

<h2>That is a hard one....</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Herkemer/">Herkemer</a> on 2003-10-11T14:31:16</h3>
I guess it would certainly depend.  The way the job market is right now, at least for me, it's dog eat dog and you have to to anything and everything to stand out as the cream of the crop.
<p>
So, I say, if you left them with any doubt about your coding abilities, point out the error, it will strengthen your position and weaken whoever wrote the code.  If your skills are not in doubt it's perhaps a little tougher call, but I probably would anyway, maybe it is their way of a test.
</p><p>
A lot of the things I read about interviews stress being able to give the interviewer the impression that if you started today you could solve some problem they have today.  I love it when they give you real world examples, maybe a problem they are currently trying to solve, and I'm able to give them some sort of solution.  It proves that you won't need a couple weeks "ramp up" time to get going.
</p><p>
That said, it would also depend on the mood of the interview, not all things are appropriate in all situations.</p>



<h2>Tell them</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Mr. Muskrat/">Mr. Muskrat</a> on 2003-10-11T17:36:48</h3>
<p>I was shown production code in my interview.  I did a quick scan and started asking questions as to why certain "standard coding practices" were not used.  I believe that by pointing these things out, I earned  some added "brownie points".</p>
<p>One warning, be prepared to fix whatever code mistakes you point out.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>



<h2>if the mood is right ...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ask/">ask</a> on 2003-10-11T23:46:33</h3>
If you are able to do it in a friendly and helpful manner, then definitely yes.  "I think the fellow writing this meant<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... because other autovivification would<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...".  And fix the missing delimiter in the regexp without mentioning it.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br> <br>
