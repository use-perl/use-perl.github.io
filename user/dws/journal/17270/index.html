<p>I try to keep up. I really do. But somehow the need to use <tt>binmode()</tt>, even on *nix, to mitigate the undesired effects of a UTF8 locale was something I missed until someone on Perlmonks posted a "why did this break?" question. The same MySQL database that correctly stored and retrieved BLOB data on one Linux box was returning different bits on another. On questioning (with chromatic providing a key question), the boxes were show to both be Linux, both running 5.8.0, but one was RH7 and the new, errant one was RH9. They had different locale settings.
<p>
A tiny light bulb, of the "Hm... I've heard something about this before..." variety, went on, and subsequent reading and discovery probably saved me several hours of debugging when I upgrade to RH9 in a few weeks.
<p>
I suspect that locale-related problems are going to bite quite a few of us insular Americans in the butt before too long.

<p>Perhaps you mean <em>two</em> key questions!  Of course, I thought the supplicant had moved from a Unixy platform to a Windowsy platform or vice versa.</p>

Actually, I meant one, but it was a very good one. Asking about whether an app (or a file) has been moved from Win32-land to Unix is an obvious question. I ask it at least once a week myself. But your question about locales was non-obvious, at least to me at this point in time.
