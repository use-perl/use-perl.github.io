<p>It's been years since I remember having one of those
"The final exam is today,
but I never went to class or read the textbook!" nightmares
(or that evil variant, the "I made it to the exam, but forgot
to put on pants!" dream).
<p>
Last night brought a new variant:
I needed two particular classes to graduate, but they were on opposite ends of
a large campus, with not enough time to make it from one
classroom to the other, and a professor who was very
uncompromising about getting to class on time. No matter how
fast I ran, or biked, or had a friend drive me (getting lost along the way, of course), I couldn't
get to the second class on time. The prof was getting
more and more annoyed, and was on the verge of failing me
when I woke up.
<p>
I think my subsconcious is trying to tell me something,
and it probably has to do with being overscheduled. Bah.
<p>

<h2>17 years later ...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/derby/">derby</a> on 2004-02-16T13:11:07</h3>
... and I still get that type of nightmare. Either that one or the one where I've missed the drop deadline and now I'm
stuck with a course that I've missed half of and have no
way of making up the lost time.
<p>

But then again I still get the nightmare from grade school when I show up to class in my pajamas! Imagine my horror when my wife (grade school teacher) tells me they now have "pajama" days in schools!</p>



<h2>I know the feeling</h2>

I'm just about 7 years out of college, and I have
the "exam I've not prepared for" dream 4-5 times
a month still.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)<p>

It'll pass in another decade or so.
