<p>I'm trying something different on a personal project.
Usually, I approach a project by first laying a bit
of groundwork, and then by driving a series of "stakes",
each of which goes bottom-to-top to
implement a small number of related features.
(I used to call these "spikes", but eXtreme Programming
uses the term to mean something different.)
A few stakes provide both a proof-of-concept and a
sketch to base further work on. And they reduce the
risk of building up a large infrastructure, only to 
find that you really didn't understand what the client
wanted after all.
<p>
On this project, I'm working from the UI down, first
mocking up screens with HTML::Template and
dummy data, then working backwards from the dummy
data, building what I need to get to real data.
I've avoided
working this way in the past after seeing the kind
of organizational chaos that happens when higher-ups
see what appears to be a polished UI, then completely
fail to understand how much hard work remains to make it
real. "The demo looks good, ship it!" is a classic antipattern.
But this is a personal project. At most,
I risk disappointing a few colleagues who see the mocked up UI, like it,
and want it Real Soon. The upside is that I get usability
feedback early.
<p>
The other thing I'm noticing is that working top down
makes writing unit tests harder.
When driving a bottom-to-top
stake, I write unit tests on the way up, each tests building
on the ones below. This feels a lot more solid to me
than working top-down. Perhaps it's just a matter of getting used to working in this direction.
