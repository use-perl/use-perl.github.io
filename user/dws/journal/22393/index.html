<p><p>
This morning's expedition into the bizzare involved tracking down an obscure interaction between mod_perl 1.99 and <tt>CGI::Simple.</tt> Normally, these two get along just fine, though we noticed a while back that file uploads would cause later users of the same Apache process (e.g., some  <i>other</i> browser) to lose URI arguments. (Finding this involved some fine detective work and a bit of luck.) The fix at the time was to note that a <tt>multipart/form-data</tt> post had just been handled, then  rflush the request object and exit the process. File uploads were infrequent in our app, so forcing Apache to start a new process was no big deal.
</p>
<p>
Time passes, and along comes a feature that requires keeping the connection alive. Debugging ensues.
</p>
<p>
When the dust settled, it appears that there are two problems that manage to avoid each other <i>almost</i> all of the time. The first is that the Apache object hangs on to the request type (which is normally undefined, but will be <tt>multipart/form-data</tt> when a correctly coded file upload happens), and reports this as the type for subsequent requests, including GETs. An oops, but a mostly benign one.
</p>
<p>
The complementary problem, in <tt>CGI::Simple</tt>, is that requests with a type of <tt>multipart/form-data</tt> get special handling, <i>regardless of the request method</i>. If the request doesn't include arguments, nobody notices. But if there are URI arguments, they get ignored in favor of a non-existent form. An oops, and one that would occassional cause our app to squawk.
</p>
<p>
I suggested a fix in the bug report: only do the <tt>multipart/form-data</tt> handling if the request method is POST.
</p>
<p>
Debugging Apache processes isn't fun, but it beats late holiday shopping.
</p>

<p>Both components should be fixed, though. It is wrong for Apache to report the MIME type of an earlier request for a later one. The bug in CGI::Simple is less obviously wrong behaviour.</p>

<p>The fact that fixing the smaller bug in CGI::Simple hides the problem should not result in complacency about the problem in mod_perl; components other than CGI::Simple in different circumstances might still be confused by that behaviour.</p>

<p>
We're back a few levels on Apache; I'll verify if it's still a problem with current code before reporting a bug. As for CGI::Simple's behavior being less obviously wrong, I invite you to provide a scenario where a <tt>multipart/form-data</tt> GET that makes sense.

<p>That's not supposed to happen.<nobr> <wbr></nobr><tt>:-)</tt> </p>

<p>My point is along the lines that Apache will exhibit a bug even on correct input, while CGI::Simple does not sufficiently validate the correctness of its input.</p>

<p>Thinking about it, the most correct is probably for CGI::Simple to raise an error of some form when it encounters that combination.</p>
