<p>When my Dell laptop dies, (or slightly before, if I can time it right), I had been planning to replace it with an iBook. But the constant stream of breakage stories has put me off. After a friend's broke (the reed switch in the hinge would only let him open the lid 2" to do work), he was advised to buy two, so that he would always have one working while the other was in for repairs.
<p>
Has <i>anyone</i> not had to send their iBook in for repairs?

<h2>Happy with mine</h2>

It's my only machine now: development platform, presentation tool, mail server, diary, etc. etc. It's done over 50,000 air miles in the last year and I've had absolutely no problems with it. Remember, you only ever hear about the troubles that people have, not the successes.

True, but all of my friends who have iBooks (8, at current count) have had problems. Granted, that's still a biased sample, but it's not a self-reporting one. (Friends with TiBooks report fewer problems.)

<h2>Happy</h2>

I am very happy with my ibook, which I have had for nearly two years. I am not really a heavy user of it, but for general hobby development work and everyday use it is great.
<p>
However, to add to your list of breakages, mine had a screen death after about a year.</p>



<h2>I love mine</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Elian/">Elian</a> on 2003-02-26T15:51:02</h3>
I've had mine for well over a year now, it's travelled all around the country, I tote it with me pretty much everywhere in my backpack, and I've had no trouble with it at all. It's been dropped, bumped, stacked with books, and I've even spilled coffee on it. (Whoever designed the keyboard and case for it did a good job there--it's the most coffee-resistant laptop I've seen) It's the most rugged laptop I've seen since the glory days of DEC engineering. (With the big difference being that the iBook was actually affordable)<br> <br>Never a spot of trouble with the thing, for all the abuse I've given it, though I did buy the extended repair option, just in case.
