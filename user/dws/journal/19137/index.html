I'm not much for gaming, but on the theory that we could all use a bit more exercise, I bought a Playstation 2, a dance pad, and a copy of Dance Dance Revolution. Our daughter took to it right away. I was able to keep up with here through the first two lessons, though doing so involved some muscles that must not have been getting much use.

Sore. Sore. Sore.

So, now that we have the thing, I'm thinking that a little carnage would be a good way to unwind after a hard day at work. Ideally, it would involve piloting a giant robot and blowing lots of things up. Any recommendations?

For the robotic blowing stuff up: Ratchet and Clank.  It's cheap, it's great, it's funny.  Robots are invovled.<br> <br>Amplitude, which is sort of like Simon on ecstasy.<br> <br>Ico, which is sort of like Zork without a parser.<br> <br>Rez, which is sort of like Tron, but you can dance to it.<br> <br>Those games are all super awesome.

Ratchet and Clank may be just was I'm looking for, since the XBox seems to have a lock on Mech Warrior.

If you have a dance-mat, you can play *any* game with it.  Try Gran Turismo on a dance-mat for a completely new driving experience.  Got a friend over?  Break out both dance mats and play Street Fighter.  Want to look like a complete fool?  Try out Tony Hawk skateboarding -- disco dancer style!<br> <br>Having said all that, Dance Dance Revolution is *much* kinder on your ankles once you get the hang of it.
