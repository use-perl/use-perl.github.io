<p>I got to play with a friend's Sharp Zaurus yesterday, at least long enough to type "ps -aux". It's a neat little... box? Didn't think to try "perl -v".
<p>
We have ants, and the cold weather is driving them inside. Since the smell of <small>RAID</small> in the morning does <i>not</i> remind me of victory, I've fallen back on an old family trick: Cinnamon. The little buggers don't like it. Find the crack/hole they're coming into the kitchen through, get some cinnamon into a straw, and blow it into the crack. They'll stop using that crack, and find another. It's a lot cheaper than bug spray, and leaves the house smelling much nicer.

<h2>Better ant control than cinnamon</h2>

<p>Use diatomaceous earth, available at most gardening centers that have organic products.  (I've been told the stuff for swimming pools won't work because it's not the same.  I don't know what the difference is, though.)  It's odorless and stops them in their tracks.  It's  also totally harmless to humans and pets.</p>
<p>I've used it for years.  Great stuff.  No, I'm not affiliated with any company that sells it.</p>
