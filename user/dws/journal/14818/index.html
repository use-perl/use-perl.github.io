<div class="span8">
<p>I just lost several hours of debugging time due in large part to my failure to distinguish "multipart/form-data" from "multipart/form-date", despite looking right at it several times. 10pt Courier New seems smaller these days. Perhaps it's time for new glasses.</p>

<h2>komodo?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/gav/">gav</a> on 2003-09-21T21:37:23</h3>
One of the things I liked about using <a href="http://www.activestate.com/Products/Komodo/" title="activestate.com">Komodo</a activestate.com> as an editor as ctrl-mousewheel changed the font. I found it nice to be able to zoom out and see the big picture or zoom in to make a tricky regexp really big. In the end I just preferred Vi, especially considering the price tag and buggyness (though I haven't used it since V1).



<h2>Screensize?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/WebDragon/">WebDragon</a> on 2003-09-22T14:40:51</h3>
In the end I think this may be a by-product of screensize..<br> <br>I've had several people walk by my 17" Sony 200GS running at 1280x1024 with a 14pt monospace font in gvim, commenting "how can you read that?" and "isn't that too small?" when I myself have NO problem reading it.<br> <br>Are they suffering from Windows-itis, where instead of making the default fontsize be 72dpi like Apple has done since the first Mac for desktop-publishing purposes, it was set to 96dpi (thereby forcing users to increase the fontsize)? Or is it just because I'm running a desktop that's much larger than normal for a 17" display (which technically (again according to the Apple monitor spec) should be running at 832x624 not 800x600) thereby making the displayed fonts smaller than usual.<br> <br>Again, *I* have no problem reading it. Hell I even wear glasses and have no problem reading it.
