<p>Last night the Silicon Valley Patterns Group (SVP) took a break from reviewing books and manuscripts,
and tackled Test-Driven Development (TDD) using Eclipse (an Open Source Java IDE). We had enough laptops--mostly
PCs, a few Macs--to break into "pairs" of 2 and 3, with an expert or two as floaters. The organizers brought a CDR
with the lastest stable Eclipse release (3.0M7) and the latest JDK. I've done a fair amount of TDD,
but had only poked around with Eclipse 2.1. Eclipse 3.0 is a <i>substantial</i> improvement. In
the unlikely even that anyone ever gets it working with Perl, I'm there in a flash.
<p>
The real value of the evening was osmosis: A bunch of nerds sharing tricks and techniques.
Half the folks had never had any keyboard time with Eclipse, and several people got their first
exposure to JUnit. (SVP is mostly a Java crowd, with some C++ and *cough* other languages thrown in.)
I'm looking forward to part 2 next week, when we'll mix the pairs up.
<p>
This kind of experience--sitting down with non-coworker fellow travelers to share skills--is one that
I haven't had for a while. Getting out of the rut now and then is fun.

No debugger yet, even though the page says there is one.  I assume it's coming sooner or later.</p>

Cool. Thanks for the pointer.
