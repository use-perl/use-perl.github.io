<div class="span8">
<p>When I was growing up, the family business was a Ford dealership. One of the bits of unwritten wisdom then was to never buy a car that was built on a Monday (or during labor negotiations), as they tended to suffer from more problems than cars built mid-week. (The image was of hung-over factory workers returning to work after weekend-long benders, picking up tools and then trying to assemble <i>your</i> car.)
<p>
I'm wondering if there's a similar effect with code. That is, do defects tend to correlate with the day of the week (or the day into the project) when code was written? I'll bet there are some interesting patterns there, should someone care to do the legwork. I've taken it as far as musing about whether there's enough information gleanable from CVS to timestamp each row of a file. At that point, this joined the list of "neat projects that'll never get off the ground in this lifetime."

I definitely have days when I know code won't be written. So I try not to write it on these days.<p>
Or is it just progressive slacking ? hmm...</p>

I was playing with the RT statistics tools today. The only graph of interest to our projects (*) was the "when do bugs get filed/resolved" graph. This showed that most bugs got filed on a friday, but most bugs got fixed on a Tue/Wed/Thu.<br> <br>Interesting.<br> <br>(*) I think the package was mostly intended for call centres using it as a tracking tool.
