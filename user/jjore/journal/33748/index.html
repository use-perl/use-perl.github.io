<div class="span8">
<p>I started reading <a href="http://www.info.ucl.ac.be/user/pvr/book.html">Concepts, Techniques, and Models of Computer Programming</a> because it spends a bunch of time discussing concurrency and constraint programming. I was wowwed this weekend when I got to the OO section. I didn't expect anything particularly interesting from this part. Not so.<br/><br/>It solved the allomorphism problem as a "oh, by the way." I just was totally blindsided by it. You can get confused method resolution when your method head is just a string or other atom. This is what happens in perl and just about every OO language I'm familiar with. In the book's pet language, your method head is often a string but isn't required to be. If the head is a "name," an unforgeable identity then it can only be invoked by call sites that have been given the method head.<br/><br/>I suppose this is just a side effect of having first class classes and methods. If you haven't given your method object to a call site, it can't be invoked. This is obvious, right? Still... it's neat and unperly.<br/><br/>Parrot's pdd 15 says methods are invoked by name. Classes, methods, and objects are PMCs though. I can get first class methods in Parrot, right?</p>

<p><blockquote> <div><em>I can get first class methods in Parrot, right?</em></div> </blockquote>

<p>Yes, but be sure that when you <code>invoke</code> them, you have a valid invocant in the appropriate place.  (I thought it was <code>P5</code>, but it looks as if that place has moved.)</p>

<p> <em>You can get confused method resolution when your method head is just a string or other atom. This is what happens in perl and just about every OO language I'm familiar with.</em> </p>

<p>I'm just guessing as to your meaning, but are you referring to the following problem?</p> <p><blockquote> <div><tt>&nbsp; if $obj.can('fribble') {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; my BadPoet $jibbet = $obj.fribble('repeatedly');<br>&nbsp; }</tt></div> </blockquote>  <p>Just because <tt>$obj.can('fribble')</tt> doesn't mean that <tt>fribble()</tt> accepts a string or returns a <tt>BadPoet</tt> instance.  I asked about this on the P6 language list in late April/early May and a variety of solutions were suggested, including this, by Larry:</p> <p><blockquote> <div><tt>&nbsp; &nbsp; if $obj.&amp;fribble:(Str --&gt; BadPoet) {<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... }</tt></div> </blockquote>  <p>Or did you mean something totally different?</p>

<p>Is that, *gulp*, really Perl6?</p>
<p>I'm just.... Is the point to <b>shock</b> people into not using it? I really need to learn Python or something.</p>

<p>No, that was just one suggestion.  The problem is that many popular OO programming languages don't really make introspection terribly easy when it comes to determining method dispatch.</p>

<p>If you can suggest a cleaner, unambiguous syntax which solves the same problem, I'm sure that Perl 6 folk would welcome it.  It's also worth pointing out that this isn't something you'd be using a huge amount.  Generally it would be shielded from users of your code.</p>

<p>I could loan my four year old nephew <em>Gravity's Rainbow</em>, but I think I'll wait until he's a better reader.  The fact that as a thirty-something I had to read <em>The Crying of Lot 49</em> first doesn't put me off from English altogether.</p>

Condescending as always.
If your point is that it's confusing to read something when you don't know the language - I know Perl. If Perl6 is so different that I can no longer comprehend it, then it could be called something else like Emerald or Jade or simply Rock.

<p>None of the goals of Perl 6 were "Perl 5 programmers should be able to understand perfectly all code written in Perl 6 without learning anything new."</p>

<p>Heck, I know Perl 5 pretty well by now and there's plenty of code I don't understand immediately.</p>

<p>How do you change Perl 5 only so much that it requires no learning to comprehend the new features?</p>

To my eyes "<p><blockquote> <div><tt>fribble:(Str --&gt; BadPoet)</tt></div> </blockquote> " ought to be a pattern. It isn't entirely clear what all the components you'd like to express things about, perhaps just everything that fits into a method head. In Perl 5, this is just its name. In Perl 6, you've also got the type signature for what the method accepts and returns.<br><br>Is there more data available to match against? Perhaps methods can also be "branded" by having something like "tags" attached to it. Imagine a tag swarm for your methods, *grin*!
