<p>By chance I looked at the tester reports for overload::eval and discovered that its never worked for anyone else. I never got a note about it failing or anything.<br/><br/>How's an author supposed to get notified that stuff is broken? I thought the new cpan test reporting stuff was supposed to make sure I'd get cc-ed on failures. Apparently it doesn't. There's nothing that looks helpful on cpantesters.perl.org either.</p>

I still get lots of fail reports, so it's not<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/dev/null.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br><br>I also look at the RSS feed for my PAUSE ID too, though.

I don't do RSS. I've never met an RSS client I liked.

I don't really like RSS readers either, but I do what I can to get the information I need.

I figure I don't need the information if its going to come in such inconvenient packages.

Maybe you cold take a look at <a href="http://netvibes.com/" title="netvibes.com">NetVibes</a netvibes.com>, which is like an RSS reader in a customizable web page &mdash; using Javascript. Web 2.0 at its best.

<h2>*It* is decentralized</h2>

<p>FYI, there is no centralized "it" to be<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/dev/null.  Individual testers may configure their CPAN Tester client to CC authors or not.</p>

<h2>Your email?  Or something else?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/dagolden/">dagolden</a> on 2007-09-25T16:26:39</h3>
<p>My first thought is that there could be something wrong with emailing to your PAUSE ID at cpan.org.  Or something filtering emails on their way to you.  But the overall number of reports on cpan testers is pretty low.</p>

<p>With the addition of the 5.9 dependency, I'm surprised there aren't any N/A results -- which would be the correct report to see on CPAN Testers for older Perls.  Note that N/A reports are now not sent to authors by CPAN::Reporter, and possibly not by CPANPLUS/YACSmoke either.  So those should only be on the mailing list and website -- you wouldn't get them directly.</p>

<p>There's a new crop of smokers that are pretty aggressive about smoking any new releases within a day or so.  Some of them are bleadperl, too.  So you might want to just kick out a new release and that will trigger a bunch of smoking.</p>

<p>Note -- I tried it on my bleadperl with CPAN::Reporter and it was a pass.  So keep an eye out and see if it shows up on CPAN Testers.</p>

<p>-- David</p>



<h2>How many smokers email reports?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/mr_bean/">mr_bean</a> on 2007-09-26T00:20:37</h3>
I only get FAIL reports from David Cantrell, so I was<br>surprised to see half of the reports on cpantesters for me<br>were failures.<br><br>That said, I have ambivalent feelings about getting more<br>FAIL reports in my mailbox.<br><br>But, seriously, smokers, Good Job!



<h2>Speaking for CPANPLUS</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/BinGOs/">BinGOs</a> on 2007-09-26T06:27:36</h3>
<p>CPANPLUS pulls the<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.yml file from <a href="http://cpantesters.perl.org/" title="perl.org">cpantesters.perl.org </a perl.org>to determine if a FAIL has already been reported or not. If a FAIL already has, it skips sending the cc'd email to the module author.</p>
