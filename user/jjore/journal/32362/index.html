It's not really "STM has huge drawbacks as a basis for concurrency", but rather "sharing data among concurrent processes creates complexity" -- In practice, when it's desirable to have _some_ data shared, STM is one of the best way we know about to manage that complexity.

<h3><a href="/user/chromatic/">chromatic</a> on 2007-02-10T19:17:37</h3>
<p>Agreed.  The goal here in language design may be to encourage shared-nothing where it's appropriate (that is, almost everywhere) and making shared-something much less dangerous where it's absolutely necessary.</p>

Yup.  And I think having <code>fork</code> and <code>async</code> being the triggers for the two sharing models, respectively, and enable "my $x is shared" work transparently across forked processes, may be a fruitful way to go.
<p>
Also, GHC 6.8 will come with a <a href="http://www.seas.upenn.edu/user/lipeng/homepage/unify.html" title="upenn.edu">unified thread/event model</a upenn.edu> that let people flip between explicit-sharing event "view" and implicit-sharing thread "view" freely, instead of maintaining an adhoc per-thread event queue; this also greatly simplifies asynchronous programs, while preserving linearly-scalable SMP performance.</p>
