<p>I barely remember what the problem was this morning. I wanted to sync my parrot source tree up to the central repository.<br/><br/>Last time I tried to use SVK I'd just tried upgrading to 2.0. I removed subversion, all it's libraries, all my user-installed stuff and had Ubuntu install it's bog-standard version. This took a little effort but was largely painless.<br/><br/>Now "svk ls //" errors out in the ->lock method by attempting to call a method on a non-object. Oops. A pile of manual debugging didn't get me anywhere.<br/><br/>Tried using the SVK verify and recover functions on my repository. Apparently it has no problems. Uh...? Tried using the svnadmin verify stuff too. Still no problems detected.<br/><br/>I dumped the inner svn repository and filtered out all the stuff I'd mirrored. This was interesting to learn. My repository went from 600MB to 15MB compressed.<br/><br/>Loaded and reloaded and reloaded and reloaded my repository.<br/><br/>At the end of the day my repository is still broken. Somehow the properties for my /File-HomeDir/ are preventing me from doing anything.<br/><br/>I wish for a sane version control system. Surely this isn't sane.<br/><br/><pre>
svk mirror //parrot https://svn.perl.org/parrot/trunk
Filesystem has no item: File not found: revision 30026, path '/File-HomeDir/trunk'

You can use git to track SVN and CVS archives.  I do that for many Perl-related things.

To bring up your issues on svk-devel@lists.bestpractical.com or #svk on freenode, where folks can help you get them resolved.



<h2>Bad smell</h2>

All the problems I see reported about svk, both around the net and at work, is just a bad bad smell.  I won't use it any more.

I guess people like the whine more than they like to praise. Let me be clear: SVK rocks!

Oh, I like *using* SVK. I just seem to have lots of problems operating my installation. I'm sure I'll be expert by the time I'm done...
