<p>I hate YAML. I really do. I'm emotional about a data  serialization format. People have told me that YAML is "soo easy!" but whenever I try to write some by hand I get an incomprehensible error from the parser and it's greek to me about what I'm doing. Fuck. <br/><br/>YAML is nice to read but I don't understand how anyone manages to write it. Surely it's parsing rules are more complex than ... something complex.<br/><br/>Maybe the other half the time I'm getting fouled up by an intolerance for Windows new lines. Fuck. Same incomprehensible error.</p>

<p>In mathematics, if you can't prove a thing, it does not mean it cannot be proved or that it is wrong. It just means that at that time it is beyond your patience.

</p><p> <tt>YAML.pm</tt> has serious issues but it most works. It helps if you know some of its limitations.

</p><ul>
<li> It is more complete than <tt>YAML::Syck</tt> (although 100x slower<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:( ).</li>
<li> <i>Don't</i> dare to include non-alphanumerics in anchor names.</li>
<li> <i>Don't</i> be so bold to forget the new line at the end of the document.</li>
</ul>

<p>And the list goes on. For many (me among them), YAML rocks. I hope this feeling becomes more widespread after the ongoing Ingy's work:

So what the hell is wrong with YAML that a person still needs to handle all that stuff I wouldn't be able to guess? Why isn't it DWIMming that stuff you mentioned? I don't really want an answer.<br><br>I figure eventually I'll be forced to deal in YAML and then I'll really take the time to figure out YAML. All I'm doing now is being BITCHY that YAML isn't a DWIMy kind of language and it's freaking easy to write invalid syntax.<br><br>If it was meant to be used by humans it shouldn't be so difficult to write acceptably!

I don't think your genuine frustration with YAML is experienced by everyone. It may depend on the specific corners of YAML you are reaching or the amount of YAML you're using. A similar pain to me is DBD::Oracle which I just can't get right to install anywhere I try -- it is different however, I recognize it usually as my fault or fault of the bloody environment in use (Oracle installation, OS, available compiler, etc.) But the frustration is similar. I usually don't have bad times writing YAML that YAML.pm groks.

<p>At least YAML.pm is horrible with its error messages, which makes it completely unusable for human-generated files. If a module <a href="http://search.cpan.org/src/INGY/YAML-0.62/lib/YAML/Loader.pm" title="cpan.org">dies with <tt>die;</tt> </a cpan.org>, that's unacceptable.</p>
<p>A config file format that insists on a file being terminated with a newline also is stupid, especially if the parser cannot correct that, but dies.</p>

That's just one parser and I'm sure that it's either better now or it will be.

YAML came out as a reaction to XML, and for a brief while it was fine and easy for data serialisation, but then the YAML spec came out, and as the spec was refined -- the authors discovered that the issues that XML solves are actually HARD, and the spec grew and grew. The YAML spec is now about 5 times the length of the XML spec, and it is *way* harder to implement.<br><br>I'd stick with XML if I were you, but YMMV.

<p>Just thought I'd chime in with a "me too".  I find YAML OK to read but don't seem to have had much like writing it.</p>

<p>I've also had a number of strange situations where a data structure written out with YAML.pm turned out to not be readable by YAML.pm - so it's not just us.</p>
