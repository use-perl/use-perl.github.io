<p>I was tired of having to type my username and password to svk commit commands. I didn't see anything obvious in the documentation for my 1.x version and thought maybe the new version would have this feature.<br/><br/>Upgrading SVK right in CPAN doesn't really work. It requires that I upgrade SVN::Core which is provided by subversion.<br/><br/>I can't upgrade SVN::Core without upgrading subversion but Ubuntu doesn't have a high enough version in it's repository. I had to move subversion out of Ubuntu's control so I installed it into /opt and removed subversion with apt-get.<br/><br/>Had to figure out how to manually install SVN::Core because it wasn't getting installed in my perl. Argh.<br/><br/>Had to move swig out of Ubuntu's control because it needed a higher version than was in Ubuntu's repository. Argh. Ok, now I have /opt/swig-x.x.x.<br/><br/>Now I'm getting errors that there's a library version mismatch in something called an RA library about http. Drat.<br/><br/>A few hours later and a short helpful chat on #svk pointed me at looking for subversion libraries under /usr. Ahhh! I removed those and rebuilt /opt/subversion-x.x.x.<br/><br/>Now it works... well now it complains that BDB isn't integrated with APR anymore. Argh!! I guess I don't care overly much about APR because it isn't web accessible but I assume the BDB backend is better than the non BDB backend.<br/><br/>Suck ass!<br/><br/>It all seems to work just fine now but I wasted a day and a half just struggling with this recalcitrant tentacle beast of a version control system. I just wanted to commit stuff to Parrot without the password reminder ceremony.<br/><br/>:-(<br/><br/>I'm an unhappy developer. This experience made me sad.<br/><br/>Oh yes, apparently the dump/load parts of SVK don't work. I did a `svk admin dump // > somefile' which later couldn't be read by `svk admin load < somefile' because the dump version was incompatible or something.</p>

<h2>use git-svn to track remote svn</h2>

<p>I'm happy using git-svn to track remote svn archives, yet having the entire archive on my disk (efficiently), and I can commit svn commits as well. Get <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software)" title="wikipedia.org">git</a wikipedia.org>!</p>
