<ul>
<li>tests not run by default when you install</li>

<li>lots of gems now on github and dont make it to rubyforge</li>

<li>people have personal gem repos which you have to use sometimes.</li>

<li>up until gem1.3 installs would use a gig of ram.</li>
</ul><p>
there is one relatively nice feature. running a local repo is as easy as typing gem server</p>

They can be run explicitly, though. And, they can be run after they're installed. I don't know how to do that with cpan.</p><blockquote><div><p> <i>lots of gems now on github and dont make it to rubyforge</i></p></div> </blockquote><p>
You can add github as a gem source so it will automatically look there.</p><blockquote><div><p> <i>people have personal gem repos which you have to use sometimes.</i></p></div> </blockquote><p>
I repeat, you can add a source. And that's not an issue unique to Ruby. I don't see some of Dave Roth's stuff on CPAN for example.</p><blockquote><div><p> <i>up until gem1.3 installs would use a gig of ram</i></p></div> </blockquote><p>
Good thing most people have upgraded then, eh? And it really depended on how many gems you had installed.
</p><p>
Also, I miss sane session handling on use.perl. Gah!</p>

<h2>What a gem...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/educated_foo/">educated_foo</a> on 2009-07-24T13:30:56</h3>
<p>It would have to be named "Robby's Runit Resting Ramework," since all Ruby modules have to follow the cutesy Scooby Doo naming convention.  To me, the Big Suck of gems is the fact that it's not just a package installer -- it also has to be loaded every time you run a script using a package installed via gems, slowing down your script.  Ruby copied some things from Perl, and improved others, but totally botched its version of CPAN, Perl's biggest asset.</p>

<h2>Rubygems</h2>

Just wanted to add that you should add gems.github.com as a rubygem source, very handy!

<p>I'm mirroring rubyforge and github's gem stream now. I figure I can build something afterward to add categorical information so it's browseable.</p><p>Of course I'd *done* if I were using perl...</p>
