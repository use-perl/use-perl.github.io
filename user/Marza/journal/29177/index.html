<p>The trip to Disneyland was great.   The kid (she is 4) had many magical moments as she met princesses and the characters.   Mickey, Minny, and Sleeping Beauty are now the favorites.<br/><br/>Why do we stop believing in Magic?<br/><br/>The Park has a great scheme going witht he fast passes.  Since they allow anybody into the park, wait lines can be 30-60 minutes.  Hell the Indiana Jones ride is actually a quarter mile of walking through a temple and tunnels to get to the ride.   <br/><br/>AAA's package will give you unlimited fastpasses.   With the regular setup, you can only have one fast pass in force.  Triple A allows you to get as many as you want.<br/><br/>Trip let down.   Back to reality and the lack of money.  Some would ask why the trip if money was hard?  We have not taken a trip in 9 years.  It was needed.  Been burned out far too long.<br/><br/>Wife may have a job.  Part-time only.   The "Booming economy" seems to make it only cost effective for a part-time job.  A full time job would basically mean taking most of her salary would have to go to daycare. <br/><br/>The job just laid off 23 people.    But we are hiring like crazy in India.   I guess that is the job creation or dear "leader" keeps talking about.   Is India another State that hasn't been announced yet?<br/><br/>I might have to find a moonlighting job to make ends meet.<br/><br/>Not much time for Perl right now.   Life is getting in the way.<br/><br/>I just exist now.</p>
