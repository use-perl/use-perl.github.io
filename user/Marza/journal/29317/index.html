<p>A curse and a blessing of working in IS involves the ability to get "hand me down" computers.   My old IBM T21 had the display fry.  Luckily I had a monitor which could work.   The boss just tossed me a Dell C400.   Light weight.  1.2 Gig processor, 40 gig drive, 512 ram and a wireless card.  Not bad.  The IBM was only had a 700 Hz processor.  Now the fun part, moving files and reinstalls.  I hate spring cleaning! ;)<br/><br/>Writing Doc is sooo much fun.  It's about 1/4 the way done.  I shouldn't complain as this will keep me from becoming the owner of this new server.  No more "I don't know what to do arguments."<br/><br/>Ewwww Sanitizing computers!   That's what you get for having initiative.   We had some old LH3s that were basically table space.   Said we should get rid of them but need to sanitize the disks because of financial data.   Now I get to sanitize all retired computers and about 30 drives that were pulled from other retired computers.   Oh well.  Not like it's an urgent project at least.<br/><br/>Read read read silly certification stuff.   When I first got them, they were somewhat valuable.  Now I am getting the impression they will not do anything for you but you are expected to have them.   Hmmmm sounds like the company will pay for the redhat engineering cert.   I am told this guy costs $450.  Will not complain about that.<br/><br/>Back to work.</p>
