<p>Somebody said I should make entries to this thing.  I haven't really tried as I am one of those Neandertals that doesn't have a blog *shock*<br/><br/>I haven't written anything in Perl for awhile.   Working with Networks, I don't have (or have found) the need for "serious" scripts.   Most of the time it's in projects.   Be it the Windows 2003 conversion, install and converting users to a new Mirapoint server, or testing out and installing the new Lyris spamming server.<br/><br/>Windows 2003 is proving  to be a rock solid OS.  Never see it crash.  Conversion from 2000 to 2003 was a breeze.   One thing that is hard to belive is NT4 still exists.   I finally killed off the last production server.  However, we still have 6 boxes and it don't look like they are going away anytime soon.   Well I should be able kill of 3 of them.  Change is bad for some people but mainly its the customers.  We have to make the big customers happy and continue to support Dead OS's.  That is the way of things.  It took a year to get them to let go of ME.<br/><br/>We entered the world of spam.  We have marketing and training notices but we are honorable about it as companies should be.   You have to request to be on our lists for example and we are quick to remove.   We had outsourced the job and those people started spamming porn.   Our hit rate went from 90% to 40% really quick.<br/><br/>Mirapoint makes a great IMAP based mail appliance!  Expensive but still cheaper then a full blown Exchange setup.<br/><br/>Certifications again.  My last cert was cisco and NT4.  Both have expired so now I am chasing the 2003 cert and CISSP.  Might become the security person for the company.  I started out that way a few years ago and left it in disgust *coughsgovermentworkcoughs*<br/><br/>So why the tangent on non-perl related stuff?  Simple point.   If you don't keep yourself hacking away at perl; job/workload burnout can make it easy not to do it and before you know it, the last script you wrote was about a year ago.<br/><br/>I am going to turn this around by going through my Perl book library.  I am going to go through the basics and work up for the fun of it.   Probably will purge and or update a few books.   Somewhere I picked up the learn perl on nt in 21 days.  Funny.   As if it was possible to do that.<br/><br/>Hey!  My first entry is done!</p>
