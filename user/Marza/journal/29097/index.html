<p>After many long years; I am taking a vacation.  First for the family.  First for my girl.   She can hardly contain herself.   She is at that age where things are still real.  However, she is starting to suspect.    Why do we stop beliving in Faries, dragons, and heros?<br/><br/>No laptop.   Hmm I can't remember any trip where I didn't have one in tow.   Boss isn't happy but hey give me a replacment if it's such an issue.<br/><br/>I finally found the damned Active Directory ghost problem.  With AD many errors are caused by DNS.   The rogue domain was not sharing DNS info.   I had to configure it to all zones to allow accesss.   Don't like that as it is a security hole.   Will have to review things.  However, I can go on my trip without thinking they will call or worst hire a consultant to fix it.<br/><br/>I took of the IDS/Firewall system.   Read the docs and have to say they are the worst thing I have ever read.   Missing a great deal of info and had detail they didn't need.   For example; I don't need several chapters on equipment I don't have.   Ahh well.  Such is the way of things.  You sometimes have to use equipment made by members of your companies board.<br/><br/>The economy?  Hmmm?   I keep hearing things are great but I sometimes wonder where and in what?   It isn't here.   I get many questions about people hiring sys admins and there really isn't any "serious" jobs around here.   Not without a serious paycut.   A good sysadmin has been out of work for 3 months now.   My cousin works for a part's company in Detroit.   He says things are bad there as well.  So where is this booming economy?   Where are these new jobs?   My companies creates jobs.....in India.   We are probably going to have a layoff in month or so.  I figure 10-15 people.  But Hey we are creating jobs in India so that makes it right?<br/><br/>Now I hear the talk about retraining being the key.   Retraining for what?   Computer work is shrinking.    You can't retrain if you don't know what to retrain for.....<br/><br/>The new mail server is online and running well so far.   Some issues with the domain but the vendor is sorting it out.  Never fails to hear "It's not supposed to do that" when a major thing like this is done.   Ah well.<br/><br/>At least I am reading full force again.  Even on my trip; I am taking a fat book on windows 2003.   I will get the certs back online again.  Never hurts to have the silly things when/if you job hunt.<br/><br/>We are testing out a device made by Silvercreek.   Wan access is noticible faster.   We are waiting for the box to hit India and will see how it works there.   It will be great if we don't have to pay another 6 grand a month for faster access.<br/><br/>Time to read!<br/><br/>'nuff said<br/><br/></p>
