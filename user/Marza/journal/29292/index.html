<p>The one thing of a good boss is that your review is kept short and to the point.  You get your goals for the year, you listen to what you did right or wrong and then you get your money.<br/><br/>-edited- for the better part of valor<br/><br/>Hmmmm top rung at what I can do.   My "growth" area is to set up a network management system for the company.   After that it is pretty much just rehashing what has been done.    Hmmm what to do.  Good money but it appears no growth potential. hmmmmm   Probably time for a new adventure after next year.<br/><br/>Just upgraded the wifes mac to OSX.  Not bad so far.  Not bad.<br/><br/>Just installed Remote installation services.   For such a small function so much work.  It's not documented well as to issues.  Ah well.  It's in place and now the documentation I have to write.   Fun fun fun.<br/><br/>Hmmm back to SNMP......</p>

Well THAT was not such a great thing to say on a public website.<br><br>But seriously, I imagine that current work would have other areas that you might be able to move into?<br>

Actually that was a good call as it would probably be frowned on if they saw the bit I took out.<br><br>However, if you mean the top rung comments?   Well, I am not too worried.   If we had a proxy server, I would be the one running it.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)  Only one person might look on this site and he would tell me he saw this.  That is if he guessed the id.   Finally, my comments are not unknown.  I have expressed them.<br><br>Installing the network management system for a global WAN might be the precursor of things to come.<br><br>If not, I have been here over 5 years so it might be time for a change.<br><br>
