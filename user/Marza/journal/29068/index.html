<p>Not surprised by the verdict on no repair as the display would cost more then the value of the computer.   I am going to try and see if I can get it going as an alternat plug on the monitor.<br/><br/>Chasing a ghost.   Damn AD is giving strange answers with two domains.  Search a computer and it will find it but it will not know where it is.   Have to solve this one as the boss said we could bring somebody in to do it.  That never bodes well for your status in things.<br/><br/>Checking out schools for the kid.  Man this is a pain.  The good ones have a screw you mentality as you need them and they don't need you.   This country is going to crap on education.  When I was a kid there was an art and music program.   Many schools either don't have it or barely have one.   Libraries are a joke.   Her Pre-school has a mobile libraries with a small collection of books shared between mutilple schools.<br/><br/>This day was a waste!</p>
