<p>I think I might be comming down with something.  Not surprising since I live with a 4 year old germ carrier.<br/><br/>Mail system migration goes on.  People are funny, even though you offer them a better setup; change is bad!  Oh well.  Makes my job easier.<br/><br/>One less domain for the company!   Already the AD is acting better since the dead domain would for no reason drop out of replication and tie the other domains since they needed to trade info.<br/><br/>Google Desktop!   Sure I would be happy to share my customers information on the Google servers!  What were they thinking?  I have to prevent it from getting installed.   Perl could make the changes but it can't prevent the engineers from overriding the changes.   I have to work a global policy and off course google is ooh so helpful.  I am wondering if their claims are true.   I have put a few questions out to see if others have done it.  Nothing yet.   Might have to trail blaze on this one.<br/><br/>Book is sitting idle for now.   Just not in the mood.<br/><br/>It will be Friday!   The CEO will talk to the ocmpany about the lost project/product.   It's a loss of 3 million a year.   I smell layoffs.<br/><br/>Time for bed I think.  Damn I hope this is not a sickness.</p>
