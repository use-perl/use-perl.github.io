<p>Damn.  My IBM work laptop decided to blow it's backlighting.   Of course the warrenty is gone.   Being it belongs to work; I have to wait what they will say.   Probably won't get repaired and i will not get a new one as IT people don't need laptops and thus we tend to get the handmedowns.   They will do something as I can't support work remotely anymore. ;)<br/><br/>The one thing that sucks is the fact I can't do any perl or work on my book!   Well I can I guess but I don't want to write things on this computer(my wifes Mac).<br/><br/>It's interesting to feel naked without the laptop.   I guess that's a sign of a techno geek.   At least I am getting caught up on my reading.   My certs have all expired so it's time to upgrade everything(windows and cisco).  I am also going to add CISSP and probably linux.   Man those tests are expensive and CISSP makes you send in a recommendation that you have been in the field for 3 years.   <br/><br/>People have asked why the CISSP?  Well at the current spot; I have no where to advance.   WAN designed.  LAN designed.  IDS installed.  LAN management getting installed.  Network redesign and upgrade in progress.  OS upgrades.   Doing these over and over only keeps me current.   Management is only place left.   Some said consult but I am not so sure.   Wife and kid makes it desireable for insurrence and a steady income.   Time will tell.   Need the certs upgraded though so mondo reading to do.<br/><br/>Hmmm what to do monday?  I feel like a script!  Maybe that mirroring software validater routine!<br/><br/></p>
