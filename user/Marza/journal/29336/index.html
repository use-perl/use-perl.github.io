<p>Did a retard thing on Perlmonks with a link and ended up turning the post, the update button and vote button to the link.   Well not for others at least; just me.  Tilly told me what to do but I just couldn't get it going.<br/><br/>I really need to get this stuff down.   Never had to build a web site so it's time.   I just have the perfect thing.  An IT website for the department and company.   The other departments are plain and boring.  I am thinking along the lines of Dante's inferno.   It will be work to learn it but it will be fun in the end.  Just need to find some decent references and howtos.<br/><br/>Family coming in so not much time to read or code.  Blah.  It will be good to see them.<br/><br/>Did I mention I don't like writing Doc?  ;)  Ohh well.  It's more or less laid out.  Just need to finish writing it.   Have to do it because the others aren't going to read books and as mentioned  I don't want to inherit this new process.   No excuse for them now so it's worth it.<br/><br/>Got to try and sneak some 2003 reading in.....
