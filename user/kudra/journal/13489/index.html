<div class="span8">
<p>Yesterday, on my way home from work,
a man started following me and talking to me.
Although I really don't like it when random
people start talking to me, I figured I'd be
polite since it was only a short walk to the
grocery store.
<p>
This has happened before (especially where
I used to live in Rotterdam, where it happened
about once a week), but he was more
persistent than most in trying to give me his
phone number.  Usually if I mention having
a boyfriend the conversation tapers off after
I establish that I'm not interested in a cheating
quickie (yes, they always ask--I wonder who
has given the impression that this form of
'seduction' is effective).
<p>
So this was a bit familiar, but a bit different,
because he hadn't mentioned sex although he
had brought up religion.  But
he didn't seem to be trying to sell me Jesus.
He mostly just wanted me to have his phone
number, although I said I wouldn't call.
<p>
Then he asked if I'd ever been to west Africa.
I replied I hadn't, although I was thinking
of visiting a friend in Tanzania (east).  But, I
wondered, why was he asking about west Africa?
Why did he want me to go there?
<p>
<i>There is a nation in west Africa that has a
reputation for trying to encourage foreigners
to visit.  The people of this country tend to
contact you unsolicited.  And they are usually
quickly intimate, calling you 'friend' before
they know your name.</i>
<p>
The CAPS and the $$$ were missing, but the
entire encounter was already reminiscent of
spam.  And he was from Nigeria.
<p>
My (silent/spam) assassin is on vacation.
<tt>:(</tt>
<p>
Side note: I have heard the worst pickup attempts
since moving to the Netherlands.  The
least tempting offer was probably when I was
having lunch in a park next to my work and a
man offered me money (no, he didn't say how
much and I didn't ask).  Fortunately this sort
of thing doesn't happen often--this is the first time
since I moved from Rotterdam, and the guy in
the park was the first time before I moved to Rotterdam.
I wonder what kind of hell the
women who don't walk around scowling go through.

<h2>pre-email scammery</h2>

This scam certainly predates email.  According to <a href="http://www.snopes.com/inboxer/scams/nigeria.htm" title="snopes.com">Snopes</a snopes.com>, it dates back at least to the 1920s.

I'm really kind of curious as to how many people have ever left home to follow up on one of these without telling anybody (it's a <em>secret</em>, y'know) and never return, and how many missing persons that accounts for...

<p>Maybe you have a very friendly scowl.</p>
