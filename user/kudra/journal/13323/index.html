<p>I finally decided to create an account and so
I've got this journal.    
<p>
Now I just need to
determine if my ramblings warrant preservation
and a wider audience (where 'wider audience'
means the two people that will read this, both
directed here by me). In short, I'm skeptical
about this.  
<p>
This is where you get to reply to tell me to
keep my thoughts to myself, or to share some more
of my wonderful opinions with the world.</p>

I knew that, I just didn't think anyone would
follow the link.  Probably you didn't yet know
what a dull posting it was.

<p>Yes, share more of your opinions with the world!  For example, how is your quest to improve the testing capabilities of your colleagues?</p>

I'd really like to know what you think of the effects of three field crop rotation on medieval society.

Three field crop rotation was a great boon on
medieval food production.  Like the invention of
the heavier plow for more northern climes, the
discovery that crops such as alfalfa could be
used to enrich the soil and increase production
was an invention easy to underestimate today, when
food is in abundance (even if it is poorly
distributed).
<p>
In the WWII, British farmers considered cultivating higher in the hills, but abandoned
the locations after realizing that the yield
was too low to sustain life. Yet at these sites,
evidence of medieval farming was found.  With
the techniques of the period this would have been
completely futile.
</p><p>
One of the problems facing the medieval farmer
was the increasingly small plots of land available.  It was customary for land to be
divided amongst sons, leading to a smaller
family plot each generation.  Such was the
state of peasantry that the black death was in
fact a useful development (from the perspective
of the class as a whole, rather than the
individuals) because it reduced the population
enough to ensure more land and greater wages
for the lower classes.

Blah blah blah blah blah, and thusly blah blah
blah.  Furthermore, blah blah blah.  In conclusion, blah and blah--blah--blahblah (blah).</p>
