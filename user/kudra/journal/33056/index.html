<p>Jonathan Lang suggested a change to S03 which was inspired by the new
array indexing syntax from S09.  This would make Ranges in an array

<p>Jonathan Lang had a proposal to generalize the negated relational
operators to apply to any infix operator which returns a boolean.
Larry Wall rejected the suggestion because the relationals Jonathan

<p>This thread began with Klaas-Jan Stol asking about the syntax for
constructing new objects because he thought that it was going to
be changed.  Allison Randal replied with examples of the two proposals
for the new syntax.  </p>

<p>This led Alek Storm to ask if <code>new()</code> would be
a vtable method or a PCCMETHOD.  Jonathan Worthington confirmed
that it is a PCCMETHOD.  Allison elaborated that it is a class method.</p>

<p>More recently, Alek replied that he thought that <code>new</code> should be kept
an opcode, and <code>new()</code> should be a vtable method which is called from
inside the <code>new</code> opcode.  Jonathan Worthington was confused by Alek's
proposal.  He suggested making BaseClass implement all the vtable
variants of a method, and Class can inherit from it and provide a sane
interface.  Alek thought that Jonathan's suggestion was similar to
one he had made in <a href="http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=41619">[perl #41619]</a> but that Jonathan's explanation
was superior.  Allison also added her thoughts to this subthread.</p>

<p>In the main thread, Jonathan proposed deprecating the old syntax
in the next release and removing support for it in the following release.
Allison agreed to marking it as deprecated now.  Joshua Isom wanted
the dot syntax to still work so that tests wouldn't need to be rewritten.
Allison explained that there were several reasons to remove constants
for types and the class registry.</p>

<p>Klaas-Jan Stol added a vtable to the parser in <code>compilers/pirc</code>.
He proposed looking at the bcg project to see if it would fit in
with <code>compilers/pirc</code>.  Allison Randal thought it was worth exploring.</p>

<p>A commit by Allison Randal integrated some questions and comments
into the Objects PDD.  Jonathan Worthington had a few comments,
such as noting that <code>resolve</code> is sugar rather than something new,
and that comments about offsets should go away.  Allison noted
that <code>resolve</code> is the preferred way of dealing with conflict
resolution, and removed references to offsets.</p>

<p>James Keenan posted some failures in <code>make test</code> in ticket
<a href="http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=42261">[perl #42261]</a>.  Paul Cochrane reported that he was unable to
replicate the failures with r17914 and asked James to check his
revision.  James looked into it further and concluded that the name
of the sandbox was affecting the test results.  He wondered if anyone
could explain why that was happening.</p>

<p>A commit by Paul Cochrane noted that Perl code with <code>__END__</code>
or <code>__DATA__</code> blocks should not get an emacs or vim coda.  Shawn M
Moore suggested putting the coda at the top of the file, but Paul
explained that this had been attempted but proved to be a poor solution
for several reasons.</p>

<p>In ticket <a href="http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=39878">[perl #39878]</a>, Will Coleda wanted tools which insert messages

in r17923 to pass the test.</p>

<p>In ticket <a href="http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=40861">[perl #40861]</a>, Paul Cochrane suggested adding a check
for 'FIXME'/'TODO'/etc for the Perl source files, as there is currently
only a check for the C files.  This was done in r17925.</p>

<p>Chris Dolan suggested using an existing Perl::Critic policy.  Will
Coleda asked if Andy Lester would accept a patch which would optionally
permit 'TODO' comments which included ticket numbers and reject those
which don't include ticket numbers?  Andy replied that he didn't want
to build exceptions, and proposed that people just write 'RT #12345'
instead of 'TODO (#12345)'.  Paul Cochrane agreed with this suggestion.</p>

<p>Ron Blaschke reported that he was looking into errors in linking and
loading on Windows.  With linking, there were some symbols which
weren't exported.  He planned to provide a patch to export them.</p>

<p>To solve the loading issue, he wanted to change several files to
include the full path.</p>

<p><i><a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/856c1c4e1dfae108/24767c8fe96fc18e?#24767c8fe96fc18e" name="460FBE7C.7090409@rblasch.org">Current State of Building Parrot on Cygwin</a></i></p>
<p>Ron Blaschke reminded the list that it is necessary to include the
absolute path to <code>blib/lib</code> in the PATH environment variable to build
on Cygwin.  He also explained that some problems could be due to a
file having Windows line endings.</p>

<p>Eric Hanchrow wondered if it was possible to make Parrot less fussy about
the line endings.  Ron wanted to see that happen, but explained that
his suggestions were workarounds until the problem was resolved.
Steve Peters said he would be looking at how to improve the process.</p>

<p>Ron described his thoughts in more detail in
'<a href="#460FBBAA.5060409@rblasch.org">Link'n'Load on Windows</a>.'  chromatic asked if it
was possible to pass flags to the linker to hint at the path, which
is how the Linux version works.  Ron thought that was handy, but hadn't
seen something similar for Windows.</p>

<p>Jonathan Worthington showed two examples of iterating through a hash,
and noted that in his first example you will only get the first key
in the hash.  He believes that the hash and iterator code are closely
tied and isn't thread safe.</p>

<p>Allison Randal replied that the significant differences are down to
the iterator's <code>shift_pmc</code> throwing an exception if the key is -1,
while <code>shift_string</code> doesn't check.  She agreed that the code was
excessively mixed and needed review.  Leopold Toetsch added a further
explanation on the implementation.</p>

<p>Jonathan Worthington explained that he was starting to move class
functionality into vtable methods, but ran into the issue that you
cannot have a METHOD or PCCMETHOD with the same name as a vtable method.
This is, however, required to implement the interface specified in PDD 15.
He made some changes to get Parrot working again, which affected the
Complex PMC.</p>

<p>Fran&ccedil;ois PERRAD
reported that this change breaks Lua.
Allison Randal observed the same thing, and asked Jonathan to either
fix the problem for Lua or revert the change from the trunk.
Jonathan apologized for breaking things and said that it was fixed
in r17982.</p>

<p>Leopold Toetsch suggested that perhaps language maintainers who are
using "features" of Parrot could submit core tests for these features,
so that this type of problem won't occur in the future.  Joshua
Isom thought this could be expanded to anyone using Parrot where a
"feature" isn't tested.  He proposed an open repository for tests.
chromatic wondered if it was that difficult to mail in patches.
Joshua offered some arguments in favor of it.

<p>Will Coleda solicited for suggestions concerning parrotcode.org because
the current system requires that he do quite a bit of work every time
that directories are moved or files are added.  He proposed having a
directory on the site which is a checked in version of the <code>docs/html</code>
directory after a <code>make html</code>.  He also suggested having docs for the
latest release as well as for the 'svn head'.</p>

<p>In ticket <a href="http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=42293">[perl #42293]</a>, Will Coleda suggested removing the script
<code>tools/doc/pod_errors.pl</code> because the functionality is already replicated
in <code>t/doc/pod.t</code>.  Also, the script finds errors which the test does
not, which requires investigation.</p>

<p>Joshua Isom reported that he got a segmentation fault when he tried to
run the script.  When he persisted with running it, he found that
it appeared to have a stricter POD checker.  Jerry Gay thought that perhaps
the script and the test were checking different files.</p>

<p>Paul Cochrane found that on Gentoo the <code>t/codingstd/c_indent.t</code>
test caused Perl to segfault, but with a new Perl compilation it
worked.  He was curious because he wondered if the error was due
to Gentoo Perl.  Joshua replied that he was using Darwin.</p>

<p>Paul also remarked that the script reported where the errors were
in the file, which the test didn't do.  Jerry Gay and Nicholas Clark
commented on this.</p>
