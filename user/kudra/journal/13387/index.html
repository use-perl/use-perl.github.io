<p>Today's my birthday, and I've reached that age
where I don't want to say how old I am.  I can
still say '20-something' but just barely.
<p>
Why do people congratulate you on your birthday?
It's not a great achievement to age.  Or are they
expressing the sentiment that it's odd you're
not dead yet?  Attention is nice, but I've long
wondered what exactly 'congratulations' means
in the context of birthdays. <p> Here in the 
Netherlands, people congratulate your relatives
for your birthday.  That one always makes me
think they're congratulating them for putting
up with you for another year.
<p>
Sanity prevailed yesterday as we went for the
Apache option.

<p>Why do I say it?  Because it's something to have gone around the Sun once more, and still be alive and healthy.  Not everyone who was here last year can say that.  I'm glad that you're still here to write interesting questions in your journal, and that I'm still here to respond to them.  (Although you may not be happy about that last part.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)</p>
<p>It may not be a great personal achievement, but it's fun to remember.  All you can do is watch the odometer, so you may as well have a drink when the 0's turn.  I'll make an extra contribution to the WDF today.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)</p>
