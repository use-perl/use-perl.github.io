<div class="span8">
<p>...has been brought to me by SSI.  Specifically,
the problem of trying to include them in CGI
output.  Naturally the easy options are out.
<p>
Simply reading in the file won't work because
of further includes.  Putting them through an
Apache filter has been set as a last resort
due to restrictions on the live server.  With
CGI::SSI the JavaScript doesn't work.  The 
templating system doesn't handle includes.
The existing solution--which consisted of a
function parsing the SSI and recursively
parsing includes--can't handle this new SSI.
<p>
I have finally gotten something functional by
using LWP to make requests for all the includes
(roughly 5 per page), and to return the result
for inclusion in the template.  I'm not very 
happy with this solution, but it has to be
done by Monday and I was hoping to take the
afternoon off tomorrow for my birthday.
<tt>:(</tt>
<p>
Better suggestions which don't include multiple
HTTP requests to serve a single page are
welcome.    
<p>
I must note that:  1) I had nothing to do with
the SSI.  2)  This is legacy code and I can't
do anything dramatic like make it work in 
mod_perl overnight, or change the templating
system.  3) The JavaScript is not my choice,
either.
<p>
I seem to be using the world 'hell' in all my
journal entries.  I wonder why this is.</p>
