<p><i><a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/1b9b274859624bd4/c3144a3ea3629125?#c3144a3ea3629125" name="4586835B.8060206@numeninest.com">RAII in Perl6/Parrot</a></i></p>
<p>Previously on this thread,
Blair Sutton asked if Perl 6 would be able to do RAII. He cited some articles
which expressed the view that it was not possible in Python due to the fact
that garbage collection does not offer deterministic finalization. This led to
the question of whether Perl 6 would suffer from the same problem due to
Parrot's style of garbage collection.</p>

<p>Larry Wall replied that deterministic reference counting was only one way to
provide transactional security and timely destruction. He assured Blair that
Perl 6 has ways to let you not care about some dependencies, while paying
attention to others.</p>

<p>Blair appreciated Larry's explanation, and admitted to relying on the
deterministic nature of C++, and using RAII to manage locks between threads
and tear apart sockets cleanly. He asked for an example of Perl 6 offering the
capability to execute code once every reference to an object has been removed.
Luke Palmer replied that the LEAVE closure trait was a general method for
addressing this.</p>

<p>This week, Blair posted a script in Perl 5 with a multi-threaded RAII idiom.
Blair asked if the LEAVE closure trait takes the previous role of P5's DESTROY
or if it will always be executed when one falls out of scope.</p>

<p><i><a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/3d3965e2b54a5a08/feaba31d6dd8fe0a?#feaba31d6dd8fe0a" name="7ca3f0160612290134n25ae3444rd1114fd0f560e70b@mail.gmail.com">Numeric Semantics</a></i></p>
<p>Last week,
the subthread was further expanded, with TSa suggesting that all rounding
functions such as floor, round and trunc take an optional second argument
which defines the jump size. TSa also proposed a number of division function
pairs, such as fdiv and fmod for flooring division and modulus, or tdiv and
tmod for truncating division and modulus. Smylers felt that this would
introduce far too many functions in to the Perl core, given that few people
would use them. Smylers felt that it was more appropriate to have them as
modules. Jonathan Lang added that it was unlikely anyone would need multiple
definitions of division and modulus at any given time, so modules made sense.
The only question he saw was which definition was default, the mathematically
elegant one or the industry standard one.</p>

<p>The main thread was revived when TSa replied to Luke Palmer's
question of whether 1 is different from 1.0. TSa wanted 1 to be an Int and 1.0
to be a Num. There was some discussion with Jonathan Lang over the
relationship between Int and Num, specifically which one does the other.</p>

<p>This week, Larry Wall put his foot down and stated that the default <code>/</code> operator
is not going to do integer division and that this is not negotiable. Later in
the thread, Larry said that for various practical reasons, he didn't think
that Int can be treated as a subset of Num. He agreed that <code>1.0 == 1 !===
1.0</code>.</p>

<p>Larry's messages generated praise from Smylers, but TSa was not satisfied.
However, he did not receive a noteworthy response this week.</p>

<p>This commit message by Larry Wall logged the following: "Tweak <code>|</code> to provide
longest-token instead of short-circuit semantics. Now use <code>||</code> for old
short-circuit semantics!" In a follow-up message, Larry elaborated: </p>

<p>This checking majorly changes the semantics of <code>|</code> within regex to support
required longest-token matching semantics rather than left-to-right matching.
It will enable us to write parsers more consistently, and it also opens up
normal regexes to better optimization via tries and such. You can now use <code>||</code>
for the old <code>|</code> semantics, which is majorly consistent with how <code>|</code> and <code>||</code>
work outside of regexen.</p>

<p>Patrick Michaud asked if a similar situation would arise for <code>&amp;</code> versus <code>&amp;&amp;</code>.
Larry answered that, for reasons of consistency, that would indeed be the
case.</p>

<p>After reading that binary operators may be declared as commutative, Dave Whipp
asked if this is restricted to only binary operators, or if he could tag any
function/method with the trait. After a brief discussion, Larry replied that
he had decided "is commutative" must die of ill-definedness.  See instead
the recent S13 change to support multiple signatures on a single body.</p>

<p>This commit, by Larry Wall, changes how regular expressions are analyzed.
They are seen as pattern/action pairs and grammars as collections of those
pairs.  In addition 'token' is defined more rigorously.</p>

<p><i><a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/d1e166aa063d29b5/45a49c998af9c4e6?#45a49c998af9c4e6" name="20070119175044.54390.qmail@web33711.mail.mud.yahoo.com">Remember: Outlaw to declare a lexical twice in the same scope</a></i></p>
<p>Steve Lukas reminded people of a proposal from September which involved
a change on S04 and linked to an earlier edition of this summary to
describe the conclusions which had been reached.  He requested that
the changes be made.  Carl M&auml;sak
added that he also considered this to be an important issue.
He wanted to see a warning when a lexical is declared
twice in the same scope.</p>

<p>Dave Mitchell and Smylers clarified how it works in Perl 5 (it's
possible, but generates a warning).</p>

<p><i><a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/06939f942c4ba711/0f1904590f4658b1?#0f1904590f4658b1" name="45B40B08.5020906@bereft.net">DFA/NFA context is non-local</a></i></p>
<p>Brad Bowman expressed his concern about the context dependence of DFA
prefix mode.  He felt this might be because he hadn't yet digested
the new rules completely.</p>

<p><i><a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/35837e7960c3eff0/4ae09ce01ad3a51e?#4ae09ce01ad3a51e" name="20070124022237.GA7201@wall.org">Smooth or Chunky?</a></i></p>
<p>Larry Wall asked for some advice with a missing generalization that
he hadn't been able to work out yet.  Given that <code>zip</code>
and <code>each</code> produce similar results, he wondered what is the use
of two functions which do almost the same thing.  This led him to
believe that zip should return something different and let the
context determine whether the result should be flattened.  This
led to musings on a default smooth and an optional chunky, and a
question on whether chunky should be the default when it makes more
sense.  He suggested various options.</p>

<p>Darren Duncan thought that the Perl 5 approach of default 'smooth'
with optional 'chunking' was appropriate.  As an example he offered
the smooth <code>map { $_, $_ * 10 }, 1..3</code> versus <code>map {[$_, $_ * 10]}, 1..3</code>.
Larry replied that this was one function where the approach was possible,
but that Perl 5 has many places where it fails to scale well to a
multi-programmer team.</p>

<p>Ruud H.G. van Tol believed that it looked like a 'multiple faces'
domain.  He sees the dimensionally structured data as a living
entity which should give different representations depending upon
the requirements.  As an example, he cited a meal, a recipe and
a shopping list, adding that his preference was for the shopping
list to be ordered by where things are found in the store.
Brad Bowman suggested that the dimensional information should be
retained, but that it might not need to be returned.</p>

<p>Ben Morrow proposed <code>[[]]</code> as a nice visual way to indicate that
a list should be built.  Blair Sutton listed several possible syntax
options.  Austin Frank joined in, offering the outverse of <code>[;]</code>,
namely <code>];[</code>.</p>

<p><i><a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/13b73273cbf799ea/28c0a9c4c86ab41f?#28c0a9c4c86ab41f" name="45B96CE0.808@carolina.rr.com">Map on a multislice</a></i></p>
<p>Joe Gottman wanted to know if map on a multislice performs deep
or shallow iteration.  He wanted to know what the default iteration
level was and how to override it.  Dr. Ruud added that there's also
the option of depth first or width first.</p>

<p>Earlier,
Jerry Gay complained that the perlcritic coding standards test was using
resources, and asked in ticket <a href="http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=41230">[perl #41230]</a> if someone
could look in to this problem.  Paul Cochrane reported that he thought
there was a memory issue relating to <code>critique()</code> and that the memory

elaborated on what what he had attempted to address the issue.</p>

<p>This week Jerry Gay congratulated Jeffrey Thalhammer on version 1.01 of
Perl::Critic, which solved the memory issue.</p>

<p>Jerry Gay announced the release of Parrot 0.4.8, "Eponymous".</p>

<p>Jarkko Hietaniemi questioned whether there was in fact extended support
for Tru64, as he had only reported problems for subsystems like PGE.
chromatic offered Jarkko commit access, but Jarkko declined.</p>

<p>Matt Diephouse volunteered to work on Tru64 if someone could give him
access to a system.  Nicholas Clark replied that HP gave access to a
number of test systems, but not Tru64.  Jarkko grumbled about HP's
restriction.  Unfortunately he was not able to provide a developer with
Tru64 access.  He thought that perhaps development on any 64-bit
platform would already improve Parrot.</p>
