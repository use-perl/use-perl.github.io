<p><p><b>This week on the Perl 6 mailing lists</b></p>
<p>"Short answer: absolutely.</p>

<p>"Long answer: emphatically not."</p>

<p>-- Larry Wall, in 'RAII in Perl6/Parrot'</p>

<p><b>Language</b></p>
<p><i><a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/ddc65ef6154f4a12/571afce559470764?#571afce559470764" name="457D965C.2010701@barco.com">supertyping</a></i></p>
<p>Earlier, TSa asked about supertyping, specifically if supertyping will
exist in Perl 6.  Larry Wall wanted to see some more complicated use cases 
which would demonstrate that the concept was useful rather than simply
an aspect of type theory.  Several other people contributed to the thread.</p>

<p>This week, Jonathan Lang addressed TSa's other question of what would happen
if an object's type changed while its identity was preserved.  Tsa replied
to the subthread.</p>

<p><i><a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/1b9b274859624bd4/c3144a3ea3629125?#c3144a3ea3629125" name="4586835B.8060206@numeninest.com">RAII in Perl6/Parrot</a></i></p>
<p>Blair Sutton asked if Perl 6 would be able to do RAII.  He cited some
articles which expressed the view that it was not possible in Python due
to the fact that garbage collection does not offer deterministic
finalization.  This led to the question of whether Perl 6 would suffer
from the same problem due to Parrot's style of garbage collection.</p>

<p>Larry Wall replied that deterministic reference counting was only one
way to provide transactional security and timely destruction.  He assured
Blair that Perl 6 has ways to let you not care about some dependencies,
while paying attention to others.</p>

<p>Blair appreciated Larry's explanation, and admitted to relying on the
deterministic nature of C++, and using RAII to manage locks between
threads and tear apart sockets cleanly.  He asked for an example of
Perl 6 offering the capability to execute code once every reference
to an object has been removed.  Luke Palmer replied that the <code>LEAVE</code>
closure trait was a general method for addressing this.</p>

<p>Allison Randal reviewed ticket <a href="http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=33962">[perl #33962]</a>, which was created almost
a year ago by Matt Diephouse to report that the readline opcode returns
too many lines.  She decided to leave the ticket open and link it to the
I/O PDD ticket.</p>

<p><i><a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/049e4a3c48c6274d/3c20fba58ff26540?#3c20fba58ff26540" name="427F75F3.1090505@toetsch.at">Re: [perl #34994] [TODO] make useful parts of Parrot config available at runtime</a></i></p>
<p>Leopold Toetsch responded to ticket <a href="http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=34994">[perl #34994]</a>, which was created
in April.  He noted that there had been several attempts to solve the issue,
and the only working scheme was to link with an object file which had the
path inside.  He left it as 'todo'.</p>

<p><i><a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/cc72706710098919/9de7aa74026b08a4?#9de7aa74026b08a4" name="rt-3.6.HEAD-1814-1166322228-1872.39997-14-0@perl.org">[perl #39997] [PATCH] PGE P5 Test Cleanup </a></i></p>
<p>Patrick R. Michaud and Paul Cochrane looked at ticket <a href="http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=39997">[perl #39997]</a>,
which was written in July.  Patrick felt that it was safe to close the ticket,
because all 'skip' and 'todo' markers had been factored out of the regex
test files.  Paul resolved the ticket.</p>

<p><i><a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/2cdc1b3daa45b859/93a0f96904b1e416?#93a0f96904b1e416" name="8e8ee0d40612190554k45efd27ve3c11996f182f0d0@mail.gmail.com">Re: [perl #40361] [PATCH] #40278 [CAGE] perl coding standards coda. (cont.)</a></i></p>
<p>Ticket <a href="http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=40361">[perl #40361]</a> from September was revived and elicited a great
deal of discussion between Paul Cochrane, Chris Dolan, Bob Rogers, Allison
Randal, Lee Duhem, Patrick R. Michaud, chromatic, and Nicholas Clark.</p>

<p>It started with Paul suggesting that the ticket could be closed once a
decision was made on where formatting information for emacs and vim should
be located.  Chris mentioned a limitation with the verbose form of the
Emacs settings.  Bob elaborated, offering a patch as a work-around.</p>

<p>Allison suggested removing all emacs and vim settings from the source code
files.  She felt that having the tests check for correct formatting addressed
the issue without the maintenance costs of editor tips.  Patrick and
chromatic agreed with her suggestion.</p>

<p>Paul thought that editor hints reduce the amount of cage cleaning work
by ensuring that code contributions use the correct style.  Nicholas
Clark pointed out that the alternative, top-level editor settings, assumes
that all a developer's projects use the same coding standard.</p>

<p>After further discussion on options, Allison proposed that for the time
being, hints would be left out of Perl files with <code>__END__</code> or <code>__DATA__</code>
blocks.  A future task would be for someone to figure out a way to encourage
good habits, without cluttering the source code or assuming that everyone
uses emacs or vim.  Paul updated the Perl::Critic policy accordingly, and
made a note in PDD07.</p>

he supplied a patch to address the issue.</p>

<p>A while ago, Will Coleda reported in ticket <a href="http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=39742">[perl #39742]</a> that there
was a conflict between an installed version of Parrot and a development

<p>Will Coleda wanted to know if Hash and Array keys are meant to have
different results when keys are unset.  Leopold's opinion was that
the <code>.Undefs</code> returned by Arrays are a legacy, and that <code>.Null</code> is
correct.</p>

<p>Jonathan Worthington submitted a patch which changes the PMC to
use <code>.Null</code>.  However, he did not want to apply it until there was
a design decision, and until he'd had a chance to fix some of the code
which expected to receive <code>.Undef</code>.  </p>

<p>Patrick R. Michaud added that there are several places where <code>.Undef</code>
was expected.  He had no strong feelings about one design over another,
but wanted people to be aware of the impact the change would have.</p>

<p>Jerry Gay felt that it would take a coordinated effort and suggested a
dedicated day for the change, with community involvement.</p>

<p>chromatic reported that he was creating the next Perl.com newsletter
and needed a list of Cage Cleaner tasks suitable for someone with Perl
and C skills, but very little free time?</p>

<p><i><a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/91e0367d91abd1f3/8288f4ee946c33cc?#8288f4ee946c33cc" name="198c87380612211537w64f09063x6869c4ff21eded4c@mail.gmail.com">Bind to an Unspecified Port</a></i></p>
<p>Matt Diephouse is writing a PIR socket library.  He found that if he
uses '0' as the desired port, the OS will select a port, but that Parrot
offers no way to discover what the port was.  He included a patch which
fixed this for UNIX, and requested help with the Windows version.</p>

<p>Ovid thanked the mailing list for answering some of his earlier questions.
His latest question was how to dereference an unexpected scalar reference.</p>

<p><i><a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.users/browse_frm/thread/dca0bb564713f219/cba9712cd8826c8d?#cba9712cd8826c8d" name="em4eav&#36;56h&#36;1@sea.gmane.org">hello, does anybody who knows the svn respo of synopsis docs?</a></i></p>
<p>Fayland Lam asked for the location of the synopsis repository.
Audrey Tang replied with
<a href="http://svn.perl.org/perl6/doc/trunk/design/syn/">the repository URL</a>.</p>

<p><i><a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.users/browse_frm/thread/d9d16d291fd7057d/71d98ad76efede79?#71d98ad76efede79" name="152837.53305.qm@web60820.mail.yahoo.com">Junctions as arguments (Pugs bug)</a></i></p>
<p>Ovid included a code snippet where he was casting a junction as a string
and received unexpected results.  He wanted to know what the proper response
was, in order to write a test.</p>

<p>Jonathan Rockway was not sure what output could be expected from say-ing
a junction.  He saw two possibilities, and thought that Ovid's expectation
was better, but wanted to hear other opinions before tests were added.</p>

<p>Larry Wall answered that what Ovid described was standard autothreading
behavior, as described in S09.</p>

<p>Ovid posted some code which was failing with the latest Pugs and asked
if there was a problem with the code or Pugs.  Sean O'Rourke also
thought it was a bug.  Ovid later confirmed that it was a bug and it
was being worked on.</p>
