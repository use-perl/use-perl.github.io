<p><p><b>This week on the Perl 6 mailing lists</b></p>
<p>"With the little sense of smell I have left, this smells like INTERCAL's
'COME FROM' statement to me..."</p>

<p>-- Larry Wall, who has a cold, in 'supertyping'</p>

<p><b>Language</b></p>
<p><i><a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/ddc65ef6154f4a12/571afce559470764?#571afce559470764" name="457D965C.2010701@barco.com">supertyping</a></i></p>
<p>In this thread, TSa brought up the concept of supertyping again.  The
example of <code>Square &lt;: Rectangle</code> was included, along with others.  TSa's
question involved an example where the object's type was changed while
its identity was preserved.  Additionally, TSa asked if supertyping will
exist in Perl 6, and if so, how would 'superdoes' and 'superis' concepts
be expressed.</p>

<p>Jonathan Lang attempted to rewrite the question for a larger audience.
He explained that the suggestion was to go from specific to general,
rather than the other way around.</p>

<p>Jonathan then noted that there are four approaches to code reuse,
three which add functionality, and one which restricts it.  This led
him to see supertyping in terms of exemptions for the fourth case.
Luke Palmer responded with an equation to express the relationship,
and his answers to the questions of whether it should be illegal
to add a required method to A if B does not implement it, given
<code>role A superdoes B</code>, and if a required method for A should
automatically become a required method for B.</p>

<p>There was some discussion on how 'superdoes' would be written,
with 'done_by', 'bequeath', and 'by' being proposed.  Ruud H.G. van Tol
offered more suggestions than a thesaurus.</p>

<p>Larry Wall first wanted to see use cases which go beyond the number
examples in order to see the value of the proposal to those who aren't
interested in type theory.  Luke Palmer, on the other hand, expressed
his interest in continuing to consider the idea until it is solid enough
that he would be comfortable with it.  Larry added his thoughts concerning
namespace issues.  There was a great deal more discussion formulating
the specifics of the proposal.</p>

<p>Given a gather block which spawns multiple threads,
Joe Gottman wanted to know if it is guaranteed that no object returned
is lost, given that the relative order of items returned is
indeterminate.</p>

<p>This week, Larry Wall responded that gather/take is defined over a
dynamic scope, and each thread is a different dynamic scope, so by
default there would be no results from other threads.  He also entertained
the converse, that gather/take is a normal way to set up inter-thread
queuing.  The short answer seemed to be that this has not yet been
decided.</p>

<p><i><a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/1fd0d3b432c2e425/664324a6e0a3d691?#664324a6e0a3d691" name="17751.57028.857483.568233@rgrjr.dyndns.org">RFC:  Proposal for dynamic binding</a></i></p>
<p>This thread was started by Bob Roger's proposal for dynamic binding.
To date, it has included an extended discussion between Bob and Allison
Randal, plus a request from Leopold Toetsch.</p>

<p>Allison began this week by explaining her understanding of the terms
dynamic scoping, assignment and binding.  Her view of the proposal
is that it offers a textbook definition of dynamic scoping.  The discussion
has included dynamic binding, dynamic scoping, and temporization, however.
With the terms defined, she went on to propose that Bob create a new
proposal for implementing dynamic scope which does not contain any
references to temporization.  Bob agreed to do this, but asked for a few
clarifications first.</p>

<p>chromatic responded to ticket <a href="http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=40958">[perl #40958]</a> with a second patch,
which improves upon his earlier attempt.  However, he noted that it
seems to work poorly with Data::Dumper and that his solution, while
non-invasive, was not ideal.  He described his preferred fix.</p>

<p><i><a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/33fa840d77492cd0/12359b6bf035854c?#12359b6bf035854c" name="rt-3.6.HEAD-13126-1165578920-639.41055-72-0@perl.org">[perl #41055] [BUG]:  &#39;Argument is not numeric&#39; warning in Darwin configuration </a></i></p>
<p>Last week, in ticket <a href="http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=41055">[perl #41055]</a>, James Keenan registered a bug
with running <code>perl Configure.pl</code>, which seemed to be related to having
a 3-level version number.</p>

<p>This week, Lee Duhem commented that it would probably be enough to get
the major OS version.</p>

<p><i><a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/720cc5af7c1091d4/7ecbeb1715fb7b04?#7ecbeb1715fb7b04" name="rt-3.6.HEAD-13138-1165721213-1892.41064-72-0@perl.org">[perl #41064] Not-so-new &#39;make&#39; failures on Darwin </a></i></p>
<p>Ticket <a href="http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=41064">[perl #41064]</a> was created by James Keenan to report another
failure to make Parrot on Darwin.  He expressed frustration that he is
still seeing the same problem which he encountered at the Chicago
Hackathon and described the measures he has taken to resolve it.</p>

<p>Will Coleda found a possible file ownership problem, and suggested
trying a new checkout.  After determining that this was not the cause,
Will asked several questions in an attempt to pinpoint the cause.
Several further posts were made by both James and Will as they tried
to determine the source of the problem.  Eventually Will concluded that
the most likely culprit was James using another compiler, rather than
the Apple version of gcc/g++.</p>

<p><i><a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/d8a49cba0cc8977c/27a7af01dfdcb74a?#27a7af01dfdcb74a" name="20061208210037.25637.qmail@spout.spiders.net">yield from a method</a></i></p>
<p>Will Coleda showed how the current <code>:method</code> and <code>.yield</code> implementations
and asked if it was desirable for them to work in this way.  He was
working on the 'Range' object and encountered this problem.  </p>

<p>Bob Rogers
thought the proper fix would be to build Coroutine on Continuation instead
of Sub.  He also suggested storing the coroutine state explicitly in the
object, and emulating yielding the method.</p>

<p>Allison Randal responded that the current functionality is desired for class
methods, although it makes no sense for instance methods.  She advised
making yield object-specific within methods.</p>

<p><i><a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/9e5def0aa1ea06f4/fdbb558f0f40904c?#fdbb558f0f40904c" name="5.1.0.14.2.20061212084536.0277dff0@pop.besancon.parkeon.com">Side effect between exit &amp; .HLL</a></i></p>
<p>Fran&ccedil;ois Perrad
showed some example code where an error of 'no exception handler' was seen
when a .HLL directive was added before a simple subroutine.  He wondered
if that was a feature or a bug.</p>

<p><i><a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/b439dd027d05ce92/997dc544c50b7c78?#997dc544c50b7c78" name="457EEA4B.1030902@kasuku.org">Past-pm basic string types</a></i></p>
<p>Allison Randal asked how to best pass-through string types from a compiler
to Parrot without doing string processing.  Patrick R. Michaud replied
that it is expected that it will be rare for a HLL string literal format
to exactly match a string literal in PIR.  Consequently, it expects that
the HLL will have decoded the strong constant according to the HLL rules,
and PAST-pm will re-encode the string to work in Parrot.  He offered to
modify PAST-pm to provide a "send literal" option.</p>

<p>Allison thought that
was a good idea, and appreciated that the current system makes no assumptions
about what constitutes a string.  Later Patrick realized that the
functionality already exists, if the <code>ctype</code> isn't set.  This is subject
to change, however, so he included more specific instructions for performing
the task.</p>

<p><i><a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/c7307291e4b6e407/b638910634c4416e?#b638910634c4416e" name="457EEB24.8040009@kasuku.org">Past-pm printing the return value of the main routine</a></i></p>
<p>Allison Randal cited an example of printing a simple statement, '2', which
would actually print '21' because the main routine is returning the value
of the last statement (true), which is correct for Perl but not all languages.
Also, the HLLCompiler is printing out this return value, and she
wanted to know why that was happening.  Patrick R. Michaud reported
that this has since been fixed.</p>

<p>Greg Bacon opened ticket <a href="http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=41082">[perl #41082]</a> to report a failure with
building r16097 on Cygwin.  He supplied a patch.  After Jerry Gay
closed the ticket, he asked if it was a known issue, and what the
solution was.</p>

<p>Will Coleda created a page to prepare for

December 16th was bug day.</p>

<p>Ovid reported that Pugs r15881 gave some errors with his new GHC 6.6
if he ran a test without <code>-lblib6/lib</code>.  He wondered why it would generate
a syntax error if he left out that portion of the line.  Gaal Yahas suggested
that it was due to an old version of Test.pm from the earlier installation.</p>

<p><i><a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.users/browse_frm/thread/92da03829cd6fe39/b3527aad8f46ee63?#b3527aad8f46ee63" name="94339.38297.qm@web60815.mail.yahoo.com">Introspection and list question</a></i></p>
<p>Ovid had a quick question on how to do introspection in Pugs.  He also
wanted to know how to flatten nested lists in Perl6.  Jerry Gay responded
that introspection is mostly unimplemented.  He also pointed Ovid to S02
for the answer to his other question.  Gaal Yahas suggested that
the <a href="http://spec.pugscode.org/">Official Perl 6 Documentation</a> was the
best place to look for updated synopses.  He proposed <code>gather</code> to flatten
a list, but noted that it was not yet implemented.  Larry Wall replied
that that would only flatten a recursive structure with help, and noted
that Pugs implements the block form of <code>gather</code>.

<p>Ovid showed some code he had written to compress a list.  He showed that
once he had added some return statements inside an anonymous subroutine,
he received an error message about using a control structure outside
a routine.  Ovid wondered if he had made a mistake or if there was a bug.</p>

<p>Larry Wall replied that it was expected to work that way.  He quoted
a section of S06, and also referenced S04.  He advised changing the pointy
block in to an official sub.  Gaal Yahas also gave similar advice.</p>

<p><b>Compiler</b></p>
<p><i><a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl5.porters/browse_frm/thread/42c935428732c177/36ee2425ef95d8ff?#36ee2425ef95d8ff" name="20061213224148.GC6402@plum.flirble.org">6-on-5 and read only aliasing</a></i></p>
<p>Nicholas Clark announced a placeholder named BIND for 6-on-5 aliasing,
which should replace the need for the Perl 5 internal type PVBM as of
r29544.  He included a list of features he thought were needed for
6-on-5, and asked for other 4-letter (or shorter) words which were
better than BIND.</p>

<p>David Nicol noted that increasing internal types to 32 instead of
keeping them at 16 would allow the top ones to accelerate tied and overloaded
types.  Nicholas replied that there were too many switch statements in
the core, and he would prefer switching to vtables.</p>

<p>David Landgren thought BIND was an alias, which was like a nickname,
and therefore proposed NICK.</p>
