<p><p><b>This week on the Perl 6 mailing lists</b></p>
<p>This summary has been posted early because I will be going to
OSCON Europe on Sunday.  Next week's summary will include any
threads which were not included this week.</p>

<p><b>Language</b></p>
<p><i><a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/eb230b7016bae3db/50b58620a83597f4?#50b58620a83597f4" name="edd5nt&#36;990&#36;1@sea.gmane.org">multi method dispatching of optional arguments</a></i></p>
<p>Last week,
Mark Stosberg wanted the specifications to address what should happen
in MMD when optional arguments are present (S12).  He patched
<code>mmd-draft.txt</code> and sent the text to the newsgroup.  Luke Palmer
offered a suggestion.</p>

<p>Ph. Marek wondered if there will be MMD based on the value of parameters,
as in Haskell.  Audrey Tang confirmed this and pointed to S06.  Trey
Harris updated it with a reference to S12.  Ruud H.G. van Tol also offered
an example of syntax.</p>

<p>This week, Larry Wall clarified further, noting that every scalar value
is a one-element subset of its type.</p>

<p><i><a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/3eb87bd3594336c6/74b039045507bbd1?#74b039045507bbd1" name="ee2c1g&#36;nqa&#36;1@sea.gmane.org">Inf appears to be unspec&#39;ed</a></i></p>
<p>Mark Stosberg was unable to find the formal definitions for <code>Inf</code>, <code>not</code>
and <code>true</code>.  Later he found them, and was able to add smart links.</p>

<p><i><a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/359b3d3e3cbc6983/a59aa4c2584eab63?#a59aa4c2584eab63" name="C1B4826E-33B7-4B9D-86C6-C966CF24C8C2@audreyt.org">Reduced assignment operator?</a></i></p>
<p>Audrey Tang noted that S03 was inconsistent about the treatment of assignment
operators in the reduction operator. Audrey further commented that she doesn't
see a problem with supporting assignment reductions as a syntactic exception.
Larry Wall replied that it was worth supporting.</p>

<p><i><a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/05c902b290fb7a5a/f9506f5acde3ceb4?#f9506f5acde3ceb4" name="20060911113508.851.qmail@web33703.mail.mud.yahoo.com">Outlaw to declare a lexical twice in the same scope</a></i></p>
<p>Steve Lukas quoted S04: "If you declare a lexical twice in the same
scope, it is the same lexical."  He felt that declaring the same lexical
should give an error, because when he does this, he's made a mistake.
Rick Delaney disagreed; for development or debugging he will often add
a second declaration line to temporarily override the first.
Juerd agreed with Steve.  He appreciates that <code>my $foo</code> always gives
a new variable, so he does not need to know anything about the surrounding
code.  Carl M&auml;sak also wanted the compiler to catch second declarations.</p>

<p><i><a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/50f6802e8c1bb5f3/4fcc8e4f0e9fc673?#4fcc8e4f0e9fc673" name="f60fe000608310645n7103d278i51c279d959bbed4e@mail.gmail.com">Naming the method form of s///</a></i></p>
<p>Earlier,
Mark J. Reed noted that according to S05, the string method equivalent of <br />
<code>s///</code> is <code>subst</code>.  He felt it might be easily confused with <code>substr</code>
and suggested <code>replace</code>.</p>

<p>A long discussion on how the method would actually work followed.</p>

<p>Recently, Larry Wall noted that he should clarify the role of <code>=</code>
with regard to preceding declarators.  They control how often the
expression is evaluated.</p>

<p><i><a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/e7b62b3f11dd80a0/262615fd0a535bba?#262615fd0a535bba" name="20060911155951.78358.qmail@web56215.mail.re3.yahoo.com">META vs meta</a></i></p>
<p>David Brunton noted that S12 specifies <code>$obj.META</code>, but in Pugs it is
implemented as <code>$obj.meta</code>.  He wanted to know if he could change <code>meta</code>
to <code>META</code>.  Larry Wall replied that he was considering renaming the
method to use interrogative pronouns.  David Green commented on Larry's
proposed names, and Larry responded.  </p>

<p>Sam Vilain wondered if upper
case was needed.  Jonathan Scott Duff thought that it fit in with
Perl's culture.  Aaron Sherman had some other suggestions for avoiding
namespace pollution.</p>

<p>David Brunton wanted to know if there was some reason that the meta
methods could not be part of a default function package.  Aaron
Sherman gave two reasons why this was not desirable.</p>

<p><i><a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/364f59e1333b9c4e/458278a875c8c175?#458278a875c8c175" name="20060912102017.GB28644@sike.forum2.org">single named param</a></i></p>
<p>Gaal Yahas wondered if <code>:(:$x)</code> was a single named parameter called $x
or a default invocant and a single required positional named $x.
Audrey Tang replied that a default invocant would not make sense
because there is nothing to default to.   Gaal then wondered what
invocant is constructed for <code>method foo ($just_a_named_param)</code>.  Larry
Wall replied, and Mark Stosberg also commented.  Audrey answered too.</p>

<p><i><a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/f02ce6977a8f0af3/cf4be17ab7c71775?#cf4be17ab7c71775" name="20060912145114.EF7DDCBA4D@x12.develooper.com">[svn:perl6-synopsis] r11965 - doc/trunk/design/syn</a></i></p>
<p>Larry Wall made a commit to S03, which led Ruud H.G. van Tol
to ask if <code>[=] $x, @y</code> was equivalent to 
<code>$x = @y[0] = @y[1] = @y[2] ... @y[-2] = y[-1]</code>.  Larry replied
that they were.  Ruud asked for additional clarification.</p>

<p><i><a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/c2606df6d6e480de/80a7037f7f52b2b2?#80a7037f7f52b2b2" name="20060903181114.GV27085@sike.forum2.org">Unpacking tree node parameters</a></i></p>
<p>Earlier,
Gaal Yahas asked for some clarification on the intent in S06's "Unpacking <br />
tree node parameters" so that he could introduce the optional use of the <br />
colon more gradually.</p>

<p>This week,
Audrey Tang replied with answers to Gaal's questions.</p>

<p><i><a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/8c8611c236585564/5a49b428c6a2cb54?#5a49b428c6a2cb54" name="20060912180701.EEAF7CBA4D@x12.develooper.com">[svn:perl6-synopsis] r11969 - doc/trunk/design/syn</a></i></p>
<p>Several threads grew from Larry Wall's commits on the <code>X</code> operator.</p>

<p>Darren Duncan expressed his appreciation for it.
Miroslav Silovic asked if it would be possible
to extend <code>next</code> to pass arguments to the 'nexted' iterator.  </p>

<p>In thread <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/6155f8c16a1d4c22/6a10369a6cd0053c?#6a10369a6cd0053c">[svn:perl6-synopsis] r11971 - doc/trunk/design/syn</a>,
Daniel Hulme requested a variant which does the diagonal order.</p>

<p><a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/f0914f342e46c16b/14d5320fdfb7205c?#14d5320fdfb7205c">[svn:perl6-synopsis] r11975 - doc/trunk/design/syn</a> led to
additional comments.  Carl M&auml;sak wanted to know why <code>X-X</code> is
needed if <code>X</code> already concatenates strings.  Daniel Hulme
thought it was an incomplete change which should have read
<code>XX</code>.  Carl agreed, but thought <code>X,X</code> would be nicer.</p>

<p><i><a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.language/browse_frm/thread/ec6df58c9b7f3ef1/0df4c931d1c12bc5?#0df4c931d1c12bc5" name="45093EBF.2080006@ajs.com">assigning to named parameters</a></i></p>
<p>Aaron Sherman wondered if it would be possible to treat named parameters
as lvalues, so that <code>foo(:a&lt;1&gt;, :b&lt;2&gt;)</code> could become
<code>foo(:a=1, :b=2)</code>.</p>

<p><i><a href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.perl.perl6.language/8108/focus=8108" name="450AFED6.5050107@ajs.com">-X file test operators</a></i></p>
<p>Aaron Sherman raised ambiguity issues between identifiers with dashes in their
names, like the file test operators, and unary minus (-4). Juerd replied with
proposals for phasing out <code>-e</code> and friends in favour of some more
flexible/modern approaches. Larry Wall cleared up the syntax for calling
prefix operators as methods, and other funny method names.</p>

<p>Acording to S05, due to the longest token rule <code>-e</code> will be parsed as the prefix
op <code>-e</code>, and not as prefix unary minus and call to <code>e</code>. However, this is only
the case if the prefix operator <code>-e</code> is actually defined.</p>

<p>A discussion on identifiers with funny characters in them also started under
this thread.</p>

<p>Darren Duncan made the suggestion that CGI.pm be improved for Perl 6
rather than simply ported.  He listed a few ways in which it could
be improved.  Mark Stosberg replied and mentioned some of the points
he considered most important.  These suggestions in particular received further
discussion: removing HTML generation methods, renaming the module,
and incorporating session management.</p>

<p>Trey Harris agreed with Mark's sentiment
about excluding HTML methods from CGI.pm, but felt this could lead to
limited Perl 6 adoption.  Thomas Wittek suggested <code>use perl5:CGI</code>
for legacy support and allowing CGI.pm to develop.  Amir E. Aharoni 
was also in favor of the backwards-compatibility module, and an improved 
default.  David Cantrell wondered if anyone was actually using HTML-generation.
In Andy Dougherty's opinion, there are probably many people using
it that way, because it features heavily in the documentation.
Leon Timmermans admitted to using them a few times, and wanted
a modern equivalent, but in a separate module.  There were a number
of other comments.  The general gist seemed to be that HTML-generation
functionality is used and should still be available, but optional.</p>

<p>The discussion of HTML methods led to Steffen Schwigon's observation
that CGI.pm could use a name change to make it appear more modern.
Darren Duncan and Juerd also disliked the current name.  David Cantrell
and Darren discussed whether 'CGI' implies an implementation or a standard
interface.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.users/browse_frm/thread/8acd5b0e9848ba52/c931a35a5e16a1d3?#c931a35a5e16a1d3">CGI Session management (was Re: the CGI.pm in Perl 6)</a>,
Michael Snoyman suggested making session management easier, and
perhaps integrating it.  Yuval Kogman requested that session handling 
be left to a plugin, and offered to share what he had learned from 
redesigning the Catalyst session handling.</p>

answered that imports were implemented a few weeks ago, but implicit
