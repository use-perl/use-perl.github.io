<p>Thom Boyer responded to Damian Conway's post from November which
thanked people for offering feedback on the first draft.  Thom said
that he had been unable to find the XHTML version of S26 and wondered
if it was available.</p>

<p>Jerry Gay replied that there wasn't a pod parser available yet.
Damian responded with the requested file, and said he still hoped
to finish the Pod6 parser but he wasn't sure when he would have time.</p>

<p>&AElig;var Arnfj&ouml;r&eth; Bjarmason
asked if Damian could post the code he currently has, so that others
could work on it.</p>

<p>Jonathan Lang proposed a module which would let you set a cycle for
enumerations.  For instance, a 'seasons' enumeration might be defined
as 'spring, summer, autumn, winter' and incrementing summer would result
in winter.  Andy Armstrong described enumeration as a simple state machine.</p>

<p>In ticket <a href="http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=41871">[perl #41871]</a>, James Keenan reported a failure he'd encountered
with <code>make test</code>.  Later he reported that he had heard that this test was
supposed to fail, and suggested making it a TODO.   chromatic said that
expected failures need to be marked as TODO, because volunteer time is

<p>Jerry Gay noted in ticket <a href="http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=41878">[perl #41878]</a> that Allison Randal had
replaced the <code>.IMPORT</code> macro with the <code>export_to</code> namespace which
was defined in PDD21.  However, the code was lacking safety checks
and he suggested creating an Exporter PMC.  </p>

<p>Allison elaborated by
suggesting an interface.  Patrick R. Michaud added his comments.
A discussion on importing followed, with Will Coleda also contributing.</p>

Jonathan Worthington was not sure that eliminating the macro there
would be the correct thing to do.</p>

<p>In ticket <a href="http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=41886">[perl #41886]</a>, Paul Cochrane noted that the <code>Icov</code>
tool can be used to produce HTML output of code coverage information.
He thought a <code>make cover</code> target could be added to the Makefile.</p>

<p>Paul Johnson mentioned the option of using  Devel::Cover to generate
the reports.  Paul Cochrane also noted that there was a script in
<code>tools/dev/parrot_coverage.pl</code>.</p>

<p>Will Coleda created ticket <a href="http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=41505">[perl #41505]</a> to suggest that documentation
of all svn properties needs to be cleaned up and reorganized.  Paul
Cochrane attempted to do this with r17591.</p>

<p>Steven Pritchard remarked that he had been working on getting a package
built for Fedora, and shared his current package.  Allison Randal
asked if he had kept track of the things which caused problems, so
that the packaging process could be improved.</p>

<p>chromatic speculated that installation paths which are not present
or are incorrect is a common problem.  Allison agreed, and wondered if
some tests could be created to check for installation paths.  Mike
Mattle explained some of the difficulties in doing this.
Joshua Isom thought that it would not too difficult.</p>

<p>Steven made a list of his three major problems: hardcoded 'lib',
<code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> had to be set to <code>blib/lib</code> in the top directory,
and the <code>languages/</code> files aren't automatically installed.</p>

<p>Jerry Gay felt that there should be a coding standards test to ensure
that C source files have the correct indentation.  Some time ago he
created ticket <a href="http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=39823">[perl #39823]</a> on this subject.</p>

<p>Recently, Paul Cochrane asked if <code>t/codingstd/c_indent.t</code> met the
requirement.  Jerry replied that there were still some further checks
which should be implemented as tests.</p>

<p>In ticket <a href="http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=41884">[perl #41884]</a>, Alexandr Ciornii submitted a patch to fix

<p>Earlier,
in ticket <a href="http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=41168">[perl #41168]</a>, Will Coleda added a request for a 'no
compiler found' error message in <code>configure.pl</code>.</p>

<p>A patch was supplied by chromatic, and applied by Paul Cochrane
in r17614.  Paul asked for someone to check if it also worked on
Windows, because he had only been able to test it on Linux.  Jerry
Gay confirmed that it worked.</p>

<p><i><a href="http://groups.google.com/group/perl.perl6.internals/browse_frm/thread/ade47fa6f12bb011/6a9724464353041b?#6a9724464353041b" name="rt-3.6.HEAD-1687-1174228211-1470.41889-72-0@perl.org">[perl #41889] [PATCH] hoist cut and paste duplication into a function in src/library.c, also possible win32 bug found ? </a></i></p>
<p>Mike Mattie created ticket <a href="http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=41889">[perl #41889]</a>.  He thought he had seen
some duplication in <code>src/library.c</code> and so he attached a patch which
corrected it.  He wasn't able to test it on Win32, however.</p>

<p>Jonathan Worthington noted that some of the code Mike thought was broken
worked.  He also planned to apply the patch.  Eventually this was done
as r17626.</p>

<p>Nicholas Clark had some comments on the algorithm involved, and some
questions about 2-letter drive names.  There was some further discussion
on the temporary solution and the proposed final resolution of the
issue.  Joshua Juran was also involved in the discussion.</p>

<p>Later, Mike posted another patch to <code>src/library.c</code>, meant to be
applied after the previous patch.  This was ticket <a href="http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=41900">[perl #41900]</a>.
It was applied as r17628.</p>

<p>After this, Mike supplied a third and a fourth patch in <a href="http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=41902">[perl #41902]</a>
and <a href="http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=41903">[perl #41903]</a>.  These were later replaced with <a href="http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=41905">[perl #41905]</a>.
Ticket <a href="http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=41906">[perl #41906]</a> was also part of this series.  Jerry Gay was able
to confirm that it works on Win32 and it was applied as r17630.</p>

<p>Finally, ticket <a href="http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=41918">[perl #41918]</a> addressed some spelling errors
noted by Jerry Gay.  It was applied as r17680.</p>

<p>Paul Cochrane submitted the output of <code>make test</code> on FreeBSD 6.1.
chromatic had also seen a failure with <code>t/stm/llqueue.t</code> but considered
the other errors unexpected.  He asked if Paul had GDBM installed.
Paul answered in the affirmative.  This was covered in ticket

<p>Mike Mattie described himself as a programmer interested in the Parrot
virtual machine.  He found that one of his biggest obstacles to working
with Parrot is that it doesn't have a working install target.  He explained
his reasoning and needs in depth.</p>

<p>Allison Randal replied that it was well-known that the install process
needs improvement, and patches and suggestions are welcome.  She addressed
many of Mike's points, and welcomed proposals which may come from the
careful analysis Mike offered.</p>

<p>Earlier,
In ticket <a href="http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=37178">[perl #37178]</a>, Will Coleda applied a patch which quieted
some alignment warnings.  Andy Dougherty had created it some time ago.
He hoped someone else would take up the task of trying to document
and check Parrot's alignment assumptions. <br />
Later, the patch had to be removed because it had introduced some
problems.  One problem was that it incorrectly assumed that all
compilers accept a <code>-h</code>, <code>--help</code> or <code>/?</code> switch.  He and chromatic
tried to find a solution but were not successful; chromatic promised
to work on a better patch.</p>

<p>More recently, Andy Dougherty figured out part of the problem.  Nicholas
Clark and chromatic also discussed the issue further.</p>
