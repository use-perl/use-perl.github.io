<p>Well, I noticed this journal thing a couple of minutes ago in the form of a link from Simon Cozens's site, so I guess I'll write an entry.  Hopefully I'll remember this thing exists and continue to write entries.
<P>
This week I managed to get some hacking done.  It's all related to the Parrot regular expression engine.  Since I'm writing the third major version of it (the first was crap and the second was okay but was never released) I'm calling it Rx3.  It has some cool features, like being able to find the rightmost match and being able to advance backwards through the string.  It's still missing a ton of stuff--among them the regex compiler (although there <I>is</I> a stub in place) and full support for most of the modifiers--but it works.  Or at least it should--I haven't worked up the courage to compile and run it yet!  :^)
<P>
In preparation for that, I also wrote two fairly minor patches for Parrot.  The first added a function to allocate stacks.  The second added a new PMC type, the Handle; it hasn't gone in yet because Dan has doubts about its usefulness.  Hopefully I'll be able to change his mind.
<P>
In other news, I'm thinking about rewriting Parrot's Configure system to make it modular.  Then again, I think about that at least twice a month and never decide to do anything about it...  :^)</p>

I think about it about twice a day, and am doing something about it.
Just not very quickly.  Email me if you want details.
