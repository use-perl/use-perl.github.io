<p>I did indeed get page creation working.  That meant, after a couple days devoted to release engineering, I could send this:<br/><br/><pre>I am happy to announce the release of WWW::Kontent 0.01:<br/><br/>    File: $CPAN/authors/id/B/BR/BRENTDAX/WWW-Kontent-0.01.tar.gz
    Size: 27402 bytes
    MD5 : 1295736bac6b0ef3339998ea47b9ad61
    
    <http://search.cpan.org/user/brentdax/WWW-Kontent-0.01/><br/><br/>Please note that it may take some time for the distribution to reach
your local CPAN mirror.<br/><br/>Kontent is a flexible web content management system written in Perl 6
and executable with Pugs.  I am writing it with the help of The Perl
Foundation and Google's Summer of Code program.  This release is an
incomplete preview, demonstrating my progress and giving a hint of
what's to come.  It is not feature-complete, and what's written isn't
yet suitable for use in production, but it's certainly good enough to
download, untar and play with on localhost.<br/><br/>In its initial configuration, Kontent looks quite similar to a wiki,
with the ability to create and edit pages through a web interface and
view a revision history.  Examination of the code, however, will
reveal a fairly sophisticated architecture capable of giving each page
unique behavior and rendering the same content in multiple formats.  A
command-line tool is provided which can manipulate pages at a low
enough level to change a page's class.<br/><br/>Although the distribution is on the CPAN, it cannot be automatically
installed by CPAN.pm or CPANPLUS, largely because I haven't decided
what should be installed where.  I recommend you simply download the
tarball and extract it in your home directory.  The INSTALL file
included in the distribution will explain how to get it running.  Note
that you will need both a copy of Pugs (the just-released 6.2.9 will
do nicely) configured with Perl 5 interop, and a copy of Parrot to
execute Perl 6 regular expressions.  You will also need a SQL database
engine and the Perl 5 DBI drivers to access it.<br/><br/>I am rather excited about this project, and I hope you will be too.<br/><br/>Share and enjoy,
--

Perl and Parrot hacker</pre><br/><br/>Now that the release is out of the way, I'm starting in on the Kolophon markup language's parser.  Until Perl 6 grammars are available, I'm probably going to follow the great tradition of web apps everywhere, and hack together a parser with regular expressions, loops, chewing gum and twine.  (I started to type <code>use perl5:Parse::RecDescent</code> when I went "wait a minute, all my actions will have to be in Perl 5...and the interface of WWW::Kontent::Skeleton depends on Perl 6 calling semantics...<em>Mommy!!!!</em>)<br/><br/>Thus far, it's been fairly easy.  On the other hand, thus far I've only written the easy part...</p>
