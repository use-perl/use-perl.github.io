<div class="span8">
<p>I'm taking a trip to Europe with my family, and won't be back until about five days before my SoC project is due.<br/><br/>I won't be slacking off, though.  I'm taking my laptop with me, and I'll be working every night, hopefully productively.  Besides documentation&mdash;and there's plenty to document&mdash;I have only the user system (which is going to boil down to a field in WWW::Kontent::Request, a login page, and a User page class), the Magic hook system, the Fidelis access-control system on top of Magic, and a couple minor classes left.<br/><br/>I spent yesterday writing code to resolve links.  In Kontent, relative paths have more complex resolution rules than the Unix-ish "current directory" concept; this is mainly because Kontent tries to minimize how large a link must be.  The basic algorithm is this:<br/><br/><ul><li>Treat the link as a fragment of a path.
    <ul><li>Try to see if that fragment can be completely resolved below the current page.  (i.e. if the user requested /foo/bar which has a link to /baz/quux, see if there's a page called /foo/bar/baz/quux.)  If so, this is the page.</li>
        <li>If not, try the page's parent, recursively.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>If the path-based resolution failed, treat the last part of the link as a page title, applying the same sort of recursion but looking up the last part by title instead of name.</li>
</ul><br/><br/>This means that links to [[/code_catacombs/crosslink]], [[code_catacombs/crosslink]], [[/code_catacombs/Crosslink]], and [[code_catacombs/Crosslink]] would work, although the second and forth forms might mess up if a page called code_catacombs with a child named 'crosslink' or titled 'Crosslink' exists somewhere between the children of the current page and the root node.<br/><br/>Anyway, today was spent getting SVK set up, packing, and vaguely wondering why Perl 6 regexes weren't working in Pugs.  Fortunately, putter figured it out pretty quickly once he learned there was a problem.  (Fortunately, I was too busy to lose more than a few minutes.)<br/><br/>Though I'll try to keep this journal up to date, I don't really know what my connectivity will be like, and I'll need to focus on programming when I get the time; hence, it might not be updated as often as usual.  Sorry about that...</p>

<p>Brent, on the off chance you see this before you notice the problem, your site is down.  I tried to send you email about the status of your project but it bounced.</p> <blockquote> <div><tt>Hi. This is the qmail-send program at yahoo.com.<br>I'm afraid I wasn't able to deliver your message to the following addresses.<br>This is a permanent error; I've given up. Sorry it didn't work out.<br> <br>&lt;***@****.com&gt;:<br>Connected to **.**.**.** but connection died.

Thanks--I contacted some family in California and asked them to reboot the server.  It seems to have come up fine; I've committed all of my work thus far back to my server, which makes me feel much happier about everything.  Your 18 August e-mails seem to have come through.
