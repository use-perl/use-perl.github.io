<p>First journal entries are always troublesome. It's just you and a lonely text-area, eager to feel your soft keystrokes. Kinky, eh? Well, maybe not.<br/><br/>I think I'm going to start with a problem I'm having. My son will be 5 months old in a couple of weeks, and it's starting to pay attention to the world. As any father, you want to protect it from the bad things in life and guide him in a path that leads to the discovery of the wonderful world thats out there.<br/><br/>So I'm thinking: what book should I buy him to start learning perl? I'm mean is never to late to start. He likes to listen to my voice, but I'm tired to read from Perl Journals or the Jabber handbook.<br/><br/>I'm thinking that a nice perl book will be a welcome change. I though about starting with Conway's Object Oriented Programming, but it's probably too advanced. And I don't thing I'm ready for questions about the Regexp book either, specially if he sees the last page. Another possibility is the Larry quote file, but I also don't think he will enjoy is father always grinning or even worse, laughing out loud.<br/><br/>I'm sure there are other perl persons out there who already forked some copies of themselves, and I'm sure I'm not alone in this quest. So, the dilemma: which book?<br/><br/>You see, you have to protect children. You never know when they'll bump into a Java or a Python book... </p>

<h2>Child Process</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ambs/">ambs</a> on 2004-07-15T10:52:24</h3>
Hmms, I don't have a child process, yet. Nor another process to create it with.
<p>Meanwhile, perl books... O'Reilly books are nice, but you can allways buy a book about cammels. Soft, and indirect!
</p><p>Specially, leave your baby away from coffee and snakes<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>



<h2>OO Perl</h2>

Damian's book isn't too advanced.  And it's excellent!
But read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0596001789/t/" title="amazon.com">my book</a amazon.com> first!  It's good and good for you!
