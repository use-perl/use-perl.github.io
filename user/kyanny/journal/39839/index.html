<p>Hi everyone. I want to know about manners that release CPAN modules. Please teach me.<br/><br/>I took over many CPAN modules. I want to inform everyone that person who maintain these CPAN modules changed. What should I do?<br/><br/>I think I should add my name to documents. What section is proper? AUTHOR(S)? I might have to increase the version, but any code has not changed. Is this appropriate as release?<br/><br/>I am a newbie of PAUSE. I do not have an experience enough to release CPAN modules. I want to learn polite way to release CPAN modules. Please teach me. thanks.</p>

<h2>I wouldn't do anything yet...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/bart/">bart</a> on 2009-11-04T15:08:09</h3>
<p>PAUSE doesn't allow new uploads with the exact same version number as what is there already.</p><p>And as long as the code, nor the docs, change, I wouldn't upload anything, yet. There's no reason for people to upgrade.</p><p>Just my 2 cents.</p>



<h2>Do nothing.</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/dakkar/">dakkar</a> on 2009-11-04T15:15:48</h3>
<p>If PAUSE knows about you taking over (that is, you have PAUSE permission to upload those modules), you don't need to do anything else.

</p><p>People should submit bugs via RT, and you have access to that. If the previous maintainer is still reading e-mail sent to the address written in the docs, (s)he'll forward people to you.

</p><p>When you have a new release of a module, add yourself to the AUTHORS, and publish it (with a higher version number, of course).

</p><p>Don't do a release just to say "hey I'm here".</p>



<h2>If you aren't releasing, what are you doing</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Alias/">Alias</a> on 2009-11-06T04:39:55</h3>
<p>I'm assuming you took over the modules mainly because you had some bug that you needed fixing, or some feature you needed to add.</p><p>When you do the release with that change, change the author value.</p><p>If you take it over, and then disappear and don't do anything, you don't want your name in there. The need to release acts as a kind of sincerity filter.</p>
