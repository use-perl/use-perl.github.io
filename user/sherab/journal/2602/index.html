<p>Someday if you're lucky, you might recognize meeting a tulkyu. Tulkyus are those wonderful souls that have in previous lives contributed great things, accumulate great knowledge and have come back yet again to do more.<br/><br/>We have one right here in our community named Jeff Pinyan. How else is it that he can be so young, so brilliant and so damned nice? Jeff has a book coming out soon: buy it.<br/><br/>As far as bodhisattvas: these are folks who take the vow to keep coming back until human suffering has ended. Human suffering in this case may be those who are not yet aware of open source and and bodhisattvas would be those who work tirelessly to enlighten those who don't.<br/><br/>I'm open to suggestions on this one but I want to nominate Damian Conway. So much time spent on our behalf and so much time away from his home and family. All for YOU dear reader.<br/><br/>Buy his books, send him a message thanking him, and more importantly before he changes his mind, contribute to the Perl fund to keep him here. Your karma will benefit tremendously (and I don't mean that kind of "karma" that is casually tossed about on slashdot).<br/><br/></p>
