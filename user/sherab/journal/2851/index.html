<div class="span8">
<p>The idea of taking refuge in the sangha is one where the sangha will help you in your common cause.
<BR><BR>
Our common cause is PERL.
<BR><BR>
There are opportunities that we miss in promoting this wonderful thing.
<BR><BR>
Free trips for the people who make PERL what it is for example. I have a LOT of frequent flyer miles since I am Elite on Northwest. You know if I had the opportunity to give up some of those miles to get Larry, Randal or any other perl luminaries to spread the gospel I would. Without question. I am not good enough to instruct people in the ways of PERL but I can help in this way.
<BR><BR>
What about YAPC? How to defray the costs? I spent time in the travel industry in a recent previous life and I thought of an idea. If the host PM group finds a local travel agency (fairly decent in size) and has them to negotiate a rate for hotels nearby and a group rate with airlines, they can always agree to a revenue sharing agreement where by some of the commission goes back to the PM group or YAPC. Corporations do it, why not YAPC?
<BR><BR>
Hosting services. Has any PM group ever considered the idea of getting themselves a reseller account and selling virtual hosting space to PM members? A reseller's account where the PM pays 2.00 a month can easily be resold for 20.00 a month.
<BR><BR>
That would add up...
<BR><BR>
Maybe there needs to be a central web site to facilitate these ideas. I'll be the first to donate 25,000 miles towards a free ticket if anyone else is interested in joining me.
<BR><BR>
It's the VERY least I can do for all the good the PERL community has done for me. <br/><br/><br/><br/></p>
