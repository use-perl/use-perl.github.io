<p><p>Well, Speilberg thinks he's seen the future.  I saw <i>Minority Report</i> today -- which was pretty good -- and can report that the future is a platform game with flat screen TVs on every wall.</p></p>

<tt>Philip K. Dick, everyone's favorite dead drugged<br>paranoid sci-fi author.<br> <br>Many paranoid sci-fi movies are based on his stories.<br> <br>So, 'twas Dick who saw that particular future.<br>Spielberg just placed the products in it<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br> <br>-matt<br> </tt>

<p>I dunno... Dick saw the bits that made the film interesting for me.  The predestination, the vague psycho-babble about choice and the insertion of spiritual / religious motifs here and there.  The more, er, flashy bits are pure Speilberg and a little distracting if anything.  I did like the UI for their computers though, very swish.</p>

<tt>I didn't mean to diss Dick at all. I actually have<br> <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; (...<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/me runs in other room to count<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... )<br> <br>28 Dick titles on my shelves right now. I enjoy even<br>the *bad* Dick-based movies because I can pick them<br>apart and think about which bits were Dick and which<br>bits were the director and which bits were "this will<br>help the movie sell better" hollywood decoration.<br> <br>I've been looking forward to A Scanner Darkly, but<br>it seems that either the project never got started,<br>or it died:<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; http://www.philipkdick.com/news/archive1.htm#scanner<br> <br>It's one of my favorite tales. I spent a summer basically<br>tripping, bumming around a coffee shop, and reading PKD.<br>One can achieve quite entertaining levels of paranoia<br>through such activities<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)<br> <br>-matt<br> </tt>
