<p><p>Back in sunny Oxford but horribly busy.  Some playing with the Parrot (mostly stomping on broken things with the test suite).  Parrot seems to be coming along well, although perl6-internals might be turning into a big talking shop with little being done.  Topic of the week has become a portable build system with most discussion focusing on tools which aren't portable and probably aren't licensed in quite the right way for our purposes.</p>

<p>I'm also seeing just how nasty C portability is, especially when gcc has a habit of working when other compilers croak.  On x86 systems this isn't really an issue, as gcc is one of the better compilers available, but when you leave that world behind it really starts to suck.</p>

<p>I've also been faffing a little with the MPI bindings I started on a while ago, and might be able to finish this off shortly.</p>

<p>This all assumes that I can find the time between looking for a "career" (with a company that will admit to what it actually does, instead of being a building full of "dynamic, team orientated driven individuals with attractive and competitive salary and benefits packages"), canoeing, lifesaving, listening to kids read and generally enjoying myself.</p></p>
