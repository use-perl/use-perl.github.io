<p><p>My book queue, the vaguely ordered set (something not implemented by java.util.collections) of volumes that I've obtained and actually physically have in a pile next to my bed, grows and shrinks with an odd will all of its very own.  Sometimes it retains the same three books for months on end as I keep finding slightly more interesting things to start as their predecessor ends, sometimes a book sits in limbo so long that I forget why it was that I wanted to read it in the first place.  When this happens it usually gets read quite quickly though, as I've two things to be curious about.</p>

<p>From time to time the whole queue suddenly, and without much warning, shrinks to nothing as I embark on a literary binge leaving me with nothing to begin and a void of newness to fill (I have a seperate repeat book queue, but that fills a couple of bookcases).  This happened to me last week, so I shot off to amazon and ordered up a few things from my wishlist but, while waiting for those to arrive[0] I found enough books to borrow from friends that my queue is now back at a very healthy nine books.</p>

<p>[0] These actually arrived a couple of days before I thought they did but for some reason known only to the Royal Mail their encapsulating parcel was left not at our front door but under a bush around the side of the house where all sane men fear to tread.  Needless to say it was discovered while searching for something else.</p></p>
