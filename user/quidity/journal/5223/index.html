<p><p>Now that I've got lovely mouse gestures, what I really want is a predictive <i>forwards</i> button.  This is closely related to my need of tab completion for <i>mkdir</i>.  One day it'll happen, just you see.</p>

<p>Of course, a predictive forwards button could actually work, given that all it needs to do is follow a link following the text "next:".</p></p>

<h2>That was the plan...</h2>

<p>
  If you look at the specs for the &lt;link&gt; element, you'll see that a predictable next and previous (and a bunch of other things back when TimBL considered metadata to be just some nice sugar) were planned for. In fact, a bunch of (very) early browsers did in fact have that functionality.
</p>

<p>
  I even have some of my sites following such conventions (for no good reason at all apart from the usual "if only Netscape/Mosaic had been a web browser" dream), but I very much doubt that even the most standard following folks would implement that given the likeliness that website creators will follow it.
</p>

<p>
  On the other hand, it would be very much possible to create a Mozilla bookmarlet (available as a toolbar) that would look inside the document for such elements and make them work when available. It would even be simple. All you'd have to do then is turn that into something trendy that sites would actually implement. If you do have the courage to undertake the latter part, I'd be happy to provide you with the trivial bookmarlet<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

<h2>Mozilla...</h2>

Erm. Mozilla currently does support the  tag for next, previous, top, author, copyright and a few others. The bar in question is available somewhere on the View menu (I'd say precisely, but I'm running Mac OS 8.6 here).<br> <br>Forward and back don't get affected, since (thankfully enough) it was decided that those buttons should stick to going backwards and forwards through the history.

<p>But it's precisely when I don't have any forward history that I want this to work...</p>

(Mine was meant to be a reply to darobin's post - must've clicked on the wrong 'Reply' button.)<br> <br>How would you distinguish between "<i>having no forward history and using page's Next field</i>", "<b>have a forward history and not using page's Next field</b>" and "<b> <i>have a forward history and using page's Next field</i> </b>"?<br> <br>The Mozilla bar is good - it keeps it separate and distinctive.<br> <br>Of course, if the Forward button changed colour, shape or something, then that may work (of course, changing colour isn't a recommended behaviour for things to show change due to colour blindness and so on), but I'm rambling now.<br> <br>

<p>Well...</p>

<ul> <li>No history - have both forwards and next go to next.</li>
<li>Forward history - have next go to next, and forwards go through history</li> </ul>

<p>It ties the two concepts together, essentially creating a history before you knew you had one.  The reason I think the feature is good is that I can then browse massive online tutorials using mouse gestures, in this case it's obvious to me -- reading the page -- what my history is likely to become.</p>

Mozilla (for now) no longer supports it.  It was removed before 1.0 RC 2, IIRC.  It's not in RC 3.  It annoys me.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:/

Bloody hell. They probably took that out and left in some useless crap. Sometimes I wonder where the Mozilla team are actually going.
