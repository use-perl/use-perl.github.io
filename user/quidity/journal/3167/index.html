<p><p>The last couple of days were spent interviewing for a job in London, a job I'd very much like to get.  I've no idea how well I've done though, which is probably the real reason that I loathe assessment events quite as much as I do.  Oddly, for a technical post, there wasn't a single directly technical question in the interview parts of the day which makes it hard to believe that I've been able to fully represent my skills and abilities.  Thankfully the exercises on the day were based on what the organisation did, so weren't so contrived that it was hard to care about doing well in them.  Also the person running the assessment day deserves a medal for keeping all the nervous applicants happy, informed and fed.  I should hear the results of this application in the next couple of days.</p>

<p>But, the best thing is that I don't entirely care... as I finally have an offer from at least one place I'd like to work at so, although I would probably prefer to get one from today's fun, I won't be too upset if I don't.</p>

<p>On the Perl side of things, I shall soon release a documentation patch for Parallel::MPI::Simple with instructions for building the module on broken redhat boxes.  Something which has been the cause of far too many not-quite-bug reports recently.  I'll also direct people to rt.cpan.org, mostly because I'd like a chance to use the system and no one's registered any problems through it yet.</p></p>
