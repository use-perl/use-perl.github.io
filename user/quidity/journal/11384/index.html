<p><p>Yep.  I've been back at work two days now, and I've still not decided what it was I was going to be doing when I returned.  I seem to have spent these last two days doing something though, even if I'm not entirely sure what.  It's all pensionable pay, I suppose.</p>

<p>I've also got my new machine back into that happy land where Real Men roam and Consider things Harmful.  Slightly stumped by the lack of a working sound card, but that can be fixed through the application of a few beer tokens to those with shrines to decayed hardware.  As far as I can tell, nothing in my collection of dust gathering devices and drives has the right holes in the back to be a soundcard.</p>

<p>Also found odd okra dish from a new local Indian delivery place.  Alas, everything else from them sort of sucked, and they took ages to deliver and wouldn't give us a free anything no matter how hard we tried.  I suspect our custom will remain with our usual source of spiced meat and rice -- although I'm a little worried as we no longer have to give our name and address when phoning in our order (and no, they don't have a clever caller id system).</p>

<p>It could be that we're eating too many curries, but I'd prefer to put this down to some contorted conspiracy of curry chefs, albino fighting midgets dressed in gorilla suits and elite badger death squads.</p></p>
