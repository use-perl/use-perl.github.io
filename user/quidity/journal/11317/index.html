<p><p>Holidays are good.  Especially those where you return without any knowledge of which day it is, and what it was you were doing at work before you left.  Hopefully I'm correct in thinking I have nothing scheduled during my first morning back, as I intend to be as late as possible.</p>

<p>The holiday itself was more kayaking.  Like last year's trip up to the cold and rainy north, it entirely failed to be either cold or rainy.  This left a lot of the rivers being little more than streams, but thankfully we found some here and there that run in even the silliest water levels.  This dry state didn't stop some of them being fairly evil, and one caused a slightly scary swim as I was recirculated behind a waterfall.  Since last year, I'm fairly sure I've improved as I swam less and was able to confidently run more rapids than last time which was satisfying.  I think that's one of the major attractions of kayaking for me -- it's always possible to raise your level, and the vagaries of the climate combined with the ravages of time ensure that no two runs down the same river are the same.</p></p>
