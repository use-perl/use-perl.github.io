<p><p>I lost my watch a while ago.  I replaced it with a cute little toy I saw in the Science Museum shop, a little digital thingy on a keychain.  This broke after six weeks, but I liked the idea as I don't like wearing wristwatches, as I either never take them off or forget to put them on.  I cannot forget something that's on my keys, or at least if I do, not having a watch is the least of my worries.</p>

<p>Anyway, I couldn't find any higher quality key-chain watches (although Nurse's fob watches come close, but are quite expensive) so I've settled for a cheap digital affair on a fabric strap which I'm going to attack with a sewing machine in the near future.  My fight against the machines crops up because I had to read the instruction manual to work out how to set the time on the watch, something which I've never needed to do before.  I'm blaming this on poor user interface design, and I'm hoping I don't lose the manual, as I don't expect to remember the complicated order of button presses required to get the thing working.</p>

<p>I will remember that next time I buy a cheap watch, it'll be a Casio again...</p></p>
