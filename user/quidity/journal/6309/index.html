<p><p>I'm liking Oxfam today.  I managed to finally find my own copy of <i>The Pauper's Cookbook</i> which I've been searching for for ages.  Charity Shops are good.</p></p>

Our copy is falling apart but it's a well loved cookbook. _The New Pauper's Cookbook_ is nowhere near as good as the original, but still worth hunting up. <br> <br>It's also weird about how prices have changed. There's very little chance that an up to date version would rely on fish so much, or spareribs...

<p>Indeed... my mother has one, but won't lend it to me as it also has fallen apart.  I was tempted to use the stuffed heart recipe when out in France and someone decided it might be amusing to buy some pig hearts from the meat counter.  Upon realising I was serious they fell back to sausages, which I at least thought was a shame.</p>
