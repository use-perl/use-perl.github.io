<p><P>Just had a fantastic week skiing in Val Thorens, with the best snow for six years and not a cloud in the sky for the entire week.  Such things are impossible.  They Just Don't Happen and certainly not to people like me.  I shall be gloating about the quality of the snow and the weather for at least five years.  I now need to find the means and the time to go skiing again this year.</p><br/><br/><P>I'm also getting annoyed by the limitations of the UK's online train timetable searching wossname run by National Rail.  It's fantastic if your journey fits all in one day, but I'll need to make a journey between two places which must span a night (as the distance is too far to do all in the evening or all in the morning).  I can fairly easily find that I could stay the night in Nuneaton, but I've more sense than that, so I'd love to query it for the intersection of <i>All stations reachable from Cambridge after 1900</i> and <i>All stations from which Lancaster is reachable by 0930</i>, and then have those stations sorted by the quality of the local hotels, restaurants and pubs.</p></p>
