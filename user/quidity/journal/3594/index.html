<p><p>I was robbed on Sunday.  Very briefly: I'm a student living in university accommodation with a room next to a kitchen.  I popped into the kitchen to cook stuff.  In the meantime $person entered room, saw wallet, liked it, and kept it.  Humph.  Anyway, the good news is that I noticed, cancelled everything and got to talk to a nice policeman.  The bad news is that I've been living a life without plastic for the last week, something I've not done for around seven years.</p>

<p>If I want money, I have to go to my bank while it's open.  I can't walk into a bar without any cash on me, order a pint of beer with a burger and ships then leave with twenty pounds in cash.  I have to walk around with far too many pieces of complicated pieces of paper, just in case I need to spend some money.  I want to buy a fob-watch, but have to wait until I've got a new magic number with which to summon goods from the internet.</p>

<p>I like my plastic money. I like my debit card.  I want to get it back and never lose it ever again.</p></p>
