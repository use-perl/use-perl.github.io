<p><p>Everyone else has been talking about Writer's block, I don't think I suffer from this, more from Idea Block.  I'll know I want to do <i>something</i> but not have a good idea of exactly what to do.  It's a sort of urge to be productive, or at least to avoid being bored.</p>

<p>This problem is compounded by my mind's habit of thinking most creatively when I'm either on a long walk or paddle, or in the shower.  These being times when I'm far, far away from anywhere that I can use to move the idea into reality.</p>

<p>Often I'll carry a notebook with me, but that's just not practical when I go out on the river, so I try to hold things in my mind until I get back to civilisation (or out of the shower...).  I find the best way to do this is to make myself very annoyed with whichever problem the idea should solve, as I can hold that small gem of bile in my head for days.  This approach works fantastically when there actually is a problem to solve (software, physics) but falls over where the thought was a simple creative leap.</p>

<p>I think this means I'll never quite write a novel, but I quite like the time I can spend with friends, so maybe this is a good thing.</p>

<p>I also bought a great book today <i>Vacuum bazookas, electric rainbow jelly and 27 other saturday science projects</i> by N Downie.  It contains 29 vaguely scientific, but still fun, things that can be constructed in a saturday afternoon.  Each has a vague set of construction instructions, a collection of directions that could be taken to change what the project does, and a very good description of the science (including the all important mathematics) behind it.  My favourite project is a nut cracker capable of exerting a few tons of force to a nut, which will crack the shell, but which then ceases motion, so that the nut itself isn't damaged.</p></p>
