<p><p>I'm about to be very busy with important things, so am presently escaping from the rest of the world.  All but a select few mailing lists are headed for /dev/null, IRC channels I frequent will see a lot less of me (sighs of relief are heard from afar), and perl6 gets to get by without me, but it was anyway, so that's ok.</p>

<p>It will be more interesting to see which of these things I miss and want to start doing again after my little haitus...</p>

<i>Oh, and everyone should pray for rain in Scotland, so that my paddling trip isn't dried out.</i> <br> <br>A friend of mine from university went to Glasgow for his Ph.D.  As a preliminary to enrolling there he went for a visit.  When he cam back, he reported to us that they have a saying in Glasgow: "If you can see the hills, it's going to rain."  They didn't bother detailing the reason why you might be unable to see the hills.
