<p><P>Journal transitioning to http://the.earth.li/user/alex/halley/halley.rss</p><br/><br/><P>So, <B>Better Living through Biscuits</B>.  A new plan for
social reform bringing forth benefits of time and convenience for all.
The principle is simple, but highly effective.  Biscuits (as you might
have predicted) are to be deployed for the improvement of the Common
Good...<br/><br/><P>Consider: At the airport waiting for boarding to be announced.
Aside hundreds of others you slump patiently in your seats.  The plane
is called.  The mass leaps forth to stay in line for minutes, to stand
and queue a little more.<br/><br/><P>Consider: Your flight has landed.  You arrive in the baggage hall.
You crowd still and silent around still silent conveyers.  Jerking
into motion, you still stand, craning glances past a forest of necks
as clattering nothing passes your position.  A bag!  Yours?  You
cannot see, cannot be sure.  Too late!  Not yours but his as he
presses past, grabbing, grunting and swinging his precious piece
against your leaden legs.  Patiently bruised you stand your ground
while brown bags bang their tattered way around.<br/><br/><P>Better: Sit and stay away from the door.  Relax until the line
grows short.  Join the end at the line's beginning and get a biscuit.<br/><br/><P>Better: Stand back until you spy your case.  Approach the belt at a
gentle pace.  Leave a good amount of space and get a biscuit.<br/><br/>
<P>And, of course, I've been busy: Firstly, and most importantly, I
now have a place to live in Cambridge.  I am therefore a happier bunny
and more able to concentrate on getting finished up here
properly. Currently this involves a hideous Heisenbug, a BBQ at the
weekend, a pub here and a walk in the country there.  This week's
weather has been pretty good, with clear evenings and dramatic sunsets
behind the Malverns.<br/><br/><P>On the down side my dentist is being useless, not only going on
holiday directly after I first went to see him but rescheduling my
appointments once he'd come back two weeks further into the future,
making it unlikely that my teeth will be through with him before I
have to move on.  Grrrr.<br/><br/></p>
