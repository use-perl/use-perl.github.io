<p><p>Today I continued my fight against technology.  This time it was
the turn of the VCR and its disgusting eating habits.  Mostly I abhor
the taste in tapes it has gained, I was enjoying <i>The Long Good
Friday</i> very, very much.  The VCR seemed to enjoy it as well,
before it choked, clunked and refused to show me any more of Bob
Hoskins.  I eventually opened up the machine, exorcised the ghost
within it, and watched the end of the film after a bit of splicing,
but next time I see it I'll need to do so off a shiny disc.  At least
this particular technology has a sane replacement.</p>

<p>I've also noticed that I have a huge mp3 collection which I mostly
skip.  I've decided it's high time for me to delete a few of the more
annoying tunes, but can't quite decide which ones.  I'm perfectly
capable of saying "nope, don't want to listen to this right now" and
hitting ctrl-C as mpg123 cycles through the play list, but can't muster
the will power to go through the entire list, one by one, and consign
some of it to the bit bucket.  Time enough for some magic with <code>
$SIG{INT}, DB_File</code> and <code>sysread/syswrite</code> to harvest
my skipping habits.  In a week or so, I should have a nicely sorted
list of hatred, and can wield my <i>rm of song destruction +2</i></p></p>

<h2>weeding out unplayed mp3s</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/TorgoX/">TorgoX</a> on 2002-04-03T22:10:56</h3>
I recently wrote to the WinAmp folks asking for optional logging of events (like "started playing X but skipped it", and "played X to completion") specifically so I could write a program to figure out what I hadn't chosen to listen to in a while.
