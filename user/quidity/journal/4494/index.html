<p><p>It seems that the Monkeys are men meme has surfaced again, and that they should obtain <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/sci/tech/newsid_1952000/1952902.stm">legal representation</a> because they share 98.7% of our genetic code.  I wonder if this means quite what the tree (ape?) hugging statisticians would have us believe... after all, most of our genetic code is, strictly speaking, inactive rubbish -- is it this part we share?  Also, does this mean fish should gain 24.5% of the rights of a person?</p></p>

If you had read the whole article a little more carefully, you might have noticed that there are other arguments presented, besides that of genetics.  I would agree that the genetics arguments is potentially misleading, if not outright bogus.<br> <br>Even worse, in my opinion, it bases animal rights solely on their "resemblence", genetic and behaviorally, on humans, which I think is a terrible position for any animal rights activist to take.<br> <br>Animal rights should be based on something more concrete, like their ability to suffer or their ability to be "subjects of a life", as Tom Regan says.  These are less speciesist and arbitrary than "well, the chimp picks his nose too."<br> <br>But to characterize all animal rights activists on the basis of this one article, and this one action, is quite ridiculous.
