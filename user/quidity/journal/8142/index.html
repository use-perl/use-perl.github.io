<p><p>I tried to understand some code from a contractor today.  It was awful.  Really, really, really bad.  Terrible.  No, worse, words barely manage to describe its grotesquely overbearing design.  Wailing and gnashing of teeth is nearer the mark.  I survived this though... somehow I lived to tell the tale... I still dream -- and shudder while I dream -- of many tentacled creatures from an alien sphere... but I did live.</p>

<p>Then I opened up the second batch of code.  I tried, really tried, to understand it.  I pulled out every trick in the book but I couldn't for the life of me work out where best to put that little debugging statement that would suddenly make everything dissolve into the realm of the obvious.  I gave up.  Well, no, I cheated.  I solved my problem, and made the bad, naughty code go away and stop bullying the nice computers.</p>

<p>You know your code's gone bad when it's easier to rewrite it by reverse engineering a packed binary file format, than it is to understand it by thought alone.</p>
