<p><P>Journal transitioning to: http://the.earth.li/user/alex/halley/halley.rss</p><br/><br/><P>The first major part of my journey (aside from fun form filling) is
a few months in Cambridge where I'll learn about the systems deployed
at Halley, get to know the people I'll be working with (both in
England and at Halley), while remaining a little excited about the
whole thing.<br/><br/><P>Cambridge is, though, not a good commute from Cheltenham, so living
there is essential.  To that end, I'm hunting houses (ssssh!).  I
might have found one that seems reasonable, and I'll be off to look at
it on Friday.  Hopefully it will turn out to be right, and my poorly
car can be saved any more trips across the country.  Houses are
houses, though, and prone to confuse and confound, so the first part
of this saga might go on for longer than really necessary.<br/><br/><P>I'm something of an avid reader, and for the time being I'm
avoiding books about the polar regions, its explorers and its history
as I expect I'll have both plenty of time, and plenty of books,
available once I get myself there.  I'm being a bit bad, though, and
rereading my HP Lovecraft, scaring myself silly in the process.  Any
lapse into an archaic style should be excused, modern service will
probably resume shortly...<br/><br/>
