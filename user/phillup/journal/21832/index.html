<p>In <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/phillup/journal/21827">my last installment</a> I found out that destruction of objects durning global garbage collection happens in a somewhat random order.<br/><br/>So, I need to make sure that all of my code undefines the $session instead of letting Perl do it for me. This way I know that the objects I'm referring haven't been destroyed yet and I can clean up properly.<br/><br/>Since this code runs in a Mason environment, the natural thing to do was insert a cleanup section in my autohandlers. But, I wasn't sure I had got them all.<br/><br/>And, I wanted to make sure that if I created an autohandler in the future that I remembered to clean my session.<br/><br/>Since I'm working on tests for the application, this seemed like a natural fit. So, I wrote a test to check all of my autohandlers for the correct code.<br/><br/>Now, if I create another autohandler it will get caught by the test script. At the very worst I'll have to update the plan. But, I won't forget to clean my session!<br/><br/>--- the code ---
<pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl<br/><br/># check all of the autohandlers and dhandlers and make sure that they have a cleanup section
# that undefines the $session variable if they do not inherit from another file<br/><br/>use strict;
use warnings;<br/><br/>use Test::More tests => 20;<br/><br/># start in this directory
my $app_dir = '/home/Mason/comp/Gradebook/';<br/><br/>use File::Find::Rule;<br/><br/>my $rule = File::Find::Rule->new;
$rule->or(
    $rule->new->directory->name('CVS')->prune->discard,
    $rule->new->directory->name('Admin')->prune->discard,
    $rule->new->file->name('autohandler'),
    $rule->new->file->name('dhandler')
  );
  
my @files = $rule->in($app_dir); <br/><br/>foreach my $handler (@files) {
  # open our file and read it in
  open I, $handler or print 'Bail out!';
  local $/;
  my $code = <I>;
  close I;<br/><br/>  # first we need to check and see if this autohandler inherits from another
  if ($code =~ m|^<%flags>\ninherit=>'undef'\n</%flags>|sm){
  
    # if it doesn't then it should have a cleanup section
    # let's grab the contents
    $code =~ m|^<%cleanup>(.*)</%cleanup>|sm;
    my $cleanup = $1 || ''; # so we don't trigger a warning with undefined scalar
    
    # and check to see that we are triggering the DESTROY method of our session   
    ok( $cleanup =~ m|undef \$session;$|sm , "$handler cleans the session" );
 } # if inherits
  
} # foreach handler
</pre></p>

If you call $m-&gt;abort, or just die, then the cleanup sections never get run.  It'd be better to write a custom handler, wrap the call to Mason in an eval block, and do cleanup after that.

Yeah, this was one of those 80% solutions.<br> <br>I started with the custom handler but it wasn't playing nicely with some of my internal redirects. So, this was kind of a "quick hack" 'till I could study the problem a bit more.<br> <br>The flip side of the coin is that I never had a problem in the Mason environment with the session and just letting it get destroyed during global destruction. I did, however, notice the problem when I needed to make a change to the database and decided to use the session module to do most of the work... because it already had methods in it to do what I needed.<br> <br>It was while writing a script to run from the command line that I noticed the problem with the session.
