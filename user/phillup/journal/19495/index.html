<p>Here in the U.S. we have the big opening of <i>Fahrenheit 9/11</i> today. In many ways the pre-release "buzz" surrounding the film has caused many comparisons to <i>The Passion of the Christ</i>. Not because the films are similar, but because the controversy they evoke is so strong.<br/><br/>I'd like to see a Venn Diagram of the population that paid* to see each of the movies. My gut tells me that the overlap is not large and I wonder how right or wrong that perception is.<br/><br/>I also find it interesting that in the current "anything to make a buck" climate of business... both movies were <a href="http://www.dailynews.com/Stories/0,1413,200~20954~2233813,00.html">shunned by Hollywood</a>, and both look to make a lot of bucks.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>*Just the self selecting crowd. Not those that saw it in a classroom or some other "captive" audience.</p>

<p>I wouldn't call being distributed by Miramax shunning.  Anyone associated with the film who seriously claims that is practicing the kind of marketing that gives the honest people a bad name.</p>

Actually, I'm the one that used that term.<br> <br>The article I linked to uses the phrase "shied away from". My command of the language isn't good enough to describe the intricate differences, but... if there are any, it is my fault.
