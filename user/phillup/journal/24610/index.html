<p>Posted here to help any others that have this problem.<br/><br/>I updated my Debian workstation yesterday.<br/><br/>Suddenly, my web based application that I work on was telling me that inserting data into the mysql database was inserting zero rows. But, the data was actually being inserted!
<pre>
my $rows = $sth->execute($data, $to, $add);
</pre><br/><br/>Always returned a value of '0E0' with no errors or warnings, when it should be returning a value of '1'. But, only when running under mod_perl.<br/><br/>However, all of my tests passed with flying colors... and eveything worked perfectly in a command line environment.<br/><br/>Something was obviously different between the two environments but no amount of poking on my part could figure out what that something was.<br/><br/>(Lesson learned: tee the output of apt-get upgrade to a file to record what software was changed!)<br/><br/>Anyways... I noticed I had two libmysqlclient* libraries installed...<br/><br/>After removing libmysqlclient10, leaving libmysqlclient12, everything works again.<br/><br/>Apparently, libmysqlclient10 is used by mysql navigator... which I don't use any way.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Does anyone know how mod_perl decides which mysql client library to load... and how I could have narrowed down the problem? I'm thinking the problem may be DBI related, since I use Apache::DBI in the mod_perl environment but not in the bash environment... but that is just a guess.<br/><br/>Right now, finding a solution was just blind luck on my part! I was minutes away from restoring my backup, but kept poking at it since the problem is not likely to go away as Debian stabilizes towards the next version.<br/><br/>TIA</p>

it's whichever version your newest dbd::mysql is compiled against, etc.

Wouldn't that be the same under both environments if @INC is the same under both environments?

depends in on the order in which your @INC directories get searched
