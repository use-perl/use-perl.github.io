I needed to write a quick script today to iterate over my database and update some records. Pretty standard stuff.
</p>

<p>
If I'm having a problem with a section of code, I will usually wrap it in a "sub" statement to skip it while I figure out what is going on.
</p>

<p>
But... I noticed that when I did this and the program was finished (it prints "done" when finished) it would segfault. I reduced the script to this...
</p>

<pre>
#! /usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use MyDB::GradeBook::Session;

my $session = new MyDB::GradeBook::Session('phillup','mypassword');

sub skip_this{
	$session->update_status_all();
}

print "\ndone\n";
</pre>

<p>
I must be having a major brain f*rt today, because I just can't see what would cause this to segfault. To make matters worse... if I remove the "sub" wrapper... the code executes as expected, does what I want... and does not segfault.
</p>

<p>
And... if I just comment out the line of code, like this:
</p>

<pre>
#! /usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use MyDB::GradeBook::Session;

my $session = new MyDB::GradeBook::Session('phillup','mypassword');

# commented out instead of wrapping in a sub
#	$session->update_status_all();


print "\ndone\n";
</pre>

<p>
It works fine.
</p>

<p>
Any ideas why wrapping this line in a "sub" would cause a segfault?
</p></p>

<p>Since the subroutine is a closure, the object won't go out of scope until the subroutine is destroyed.  That tends to be quite bad news for objects with some sort of <tt>DESTROY</tt> action.</p>

Ah... Must review closures.<br> <br>That explains why I tracked it down to a problem in the destructor of the session object. The closure would change *when* the object is being destroyed... do I have that right?<br> <br>The problem goes away when I use a different serializer for my CGI::Session object, which is contained in the session object (has a, not is a). I close the CGI::Session object in the destructor of my session object.<br> <br>I have not thought of subroutines being a closure... just a different lexical scope. I'm still not sure how simply using the $session variable (which is "global") in the sub changes anything, but it does seem to be something to do with object destruction.<br> <br>Thanks for the input... I'll read up on closures tomorrow morning. Gotta go play with the kid...

Did some quick reading...<br> <br>I didn't realize that *accessing* a variable from within a closure makes it hang around until the closure goes away. Actually, it makes sense... I simply had not thought too deeply about it.<br> <br>It looks like it does this by increasing the ref count of the variable... which would definitely change when it gets destroyed.<br> <br>*Now* I'll go play with the kid.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)
