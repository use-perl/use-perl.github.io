<p>I want to go on the record as saying that I think Saddam is a "Bad Guy" and should be punnished to the fullest extent of the law.<br/><br/>That said...<br/><br/>Something just does not seem right to me about him appearing before a judge in Iraq tommorrow.<br/><br/>Why?<br/><br/>Well, this government did not exist until yesterday. So, its laws did not exist until yesterday... at the earliest.<br/><br/>So, how can a man in US custody be guilty of breaking those laws?<br/><br/>I guess my point is, that I just think it is the wrong venue. But, that fits well with the current administration doing everything in it's power to deny legitimacy to the UN.<br/><br/>To me, these machinations on the administration's part, weaken the legitimacy of their actions. Our country does not need that right now, IMHO. And, I don't think it is necessary to get the conviction.</p>

So what is your answer then? Let him go? Maybe go the route that Melosavik (bad spelling I know) went with the International court? I think it is appropriate that the people that he terrorized get to try him.

<i>So what is your answer then? Let him go?</i> <br> <br>I'm definitely not trying to imply that he should be let go. I simply think it is the wrong venue.<br> <br>What about something like <a href="http://www.pict-pcti.org/courts/ICC.html" title="pict-pcti.org">this</a pict-pcti.org>?<br> <br>My point is that he should not be punnished by a system that has to employ retroactivity. He should be punished by a system that had jurisdiction <i> <b>before</b> </i> the invasion, avoiding the question of retroactivity.<br> <br>If the invasion was justified, then the system that justified it should be the one to try him.<br> <br>IMHO.
