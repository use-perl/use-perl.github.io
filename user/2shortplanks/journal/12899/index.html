<p>So, then there was a conference.  acme, james and Pierre
ran around making badges for everyone while people ate
muffins and Damian did the first third of his talk on Perl
6.

<p>

A quick break and I went to see abigale speak about Benchmarking.
Some good points covered - essentially four points where you
can easily get caught out when benchmarking, explained carefully
with proper reasoning.  I then went to see merlyn give his teaching
learning perl talk, which is a talk on talking and teaching.  He
covered some good points, which I think if combined with mjd's
conference judo should should be very helpful.

<p>

After lunch, I listened to Damian's talk on being lazy in the way that
you work.  I think I would have got more out of it if he's been
talking about my shell (bash) not tcsh and editor (emacs) not vi.
Still, he did remind me that there's a large number of ways I could
make my working environment better.  Now if I only knew how to write
proper bash and emacs scripts.  Tutorials anyone?

<p>

In the evening we headed back to the hotel for a swim and chat by
the pool, where we tried to come up with the next big thing in perl.
Came up with a few ideas, but they're things that need doing first
rather than discussing.  So watch this space.

<p>

We then went to the party as Boston's By The Beach.  Turned up early
and had food.  I think I had the world's largest blackened swordfish,
but OTOH, it was nothing compared to the surf and turf.  Band turned
up, played lots of reggee.  People shouted to other people.  We all
tried to ignore the twenty or so TVs showing baseball.  You get the
idea.  Though Boston's isn't actually on the beach, we did walk down
there.  Managed to find a shell I could skim into the Atlantic (there
were no stones.)  That's one big objective for the trip out of the way
at least ;-)
