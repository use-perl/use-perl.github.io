<p>Damian's coming to London to give us a talk on Perl 6.  Yey.  See the
london.pm list for more details while we sort out a venue.  Anyhow,
this has unfortunately stirred up a hornets nest of FUD regarding Perl
6.  People are starting to make blanket statements about Perl 6.  For
example:

<blockquote><i>
I don't think it's that using Perl6 day to day is going to be more
complicated, just that understanding the resultant crap is going to make
the life of maintainers even more horrendous that it is now.
</i></blockquote>

For example, the statement above is not too helpful.  I mean, what
aspects of Perl 6 do they have issues with?  The complexity of the
language?  We've had this debate over and over - the changes to the
language are designed to make it easier, purer and more simple to
program Perl.  But that's not the point is it?

<p>

You see if someone had said "I'm worried about the complexity the
changes in Perl 6 are introducing and it's knock on effects on
software maintenance" then they'd be something to answer.  But that's
not the way FUD works.  You make a statement that is one point but in
it you slip in a passing blow at some other aspect.  In this case
rather than just conceding the point that it possibly might be easier
day to day to use Perl 6[1], you transfer the problem to that of
maintenance, and label the output (i.e. what people were programming
what was your original point that you just conceded) as crap
sidestepping the issue.

<p>

Let's compare that with Java:

<blockquote><i>
Java is exactly like interpreted C++.<br>
And what I mean by this sentence ?<br>
C++ is designed to be a compiled language not for run time interpretation like perl/python .<br>
When Java developers ripped C++ I think they forgot about that<br>
Now you know why Java is so bloated....<br>
</i></blockquote>

That's from <a
href="http://apple.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=36861&cid=3963777">here</a>
of course, where else.  Different language, same M.O.  Notice how the
poster makes two valid points that Java is like C++ and that C++ isn't
designed to be interpreted and draws the conclusion that Java
therefore isn't any good at interpretation, neatly skipping all the
important fact that quite a few of the differences in C++ and Java
tend towards run time interpretation (er, reflection, bounds checking,
etc)

Now I'm not saying that his point isn't valid, but it's the way that
he's stated it.  The fact is that it's been <em>stated</em> rather
than being presented as an argument.

<p>

Oh note the good sideswipe about bloatedness at the end.  Totally
unrelated comment coming into play.  Nice.

<p>
So, it seems, no matter what you're language (or
topic) you're going to run across some FUD.

<p>

To be honest, I think it's too early to be making any statements about
Perl 6 as a language - it's still in development and we'll only see
the results when we have the results. What would be nice is some
debate though...I'm always up for some healthy dialog.  The trouble
with this is that FUD, be it in my favor or against it, isn't healthy
dialog - hell, it's not even dialog.

<p>

[1] I'm not saying it will be easier to use Perl 6 day to day.  We
were arguing that the language changes might have the potential to be
so.

<h2>unmaintainable crap</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/TeeJay/">TeeJay</a> on 2002-07-29T12:01:05</h3>
There is plenty of crap out there in perl (and more so in VB, VBScript and pascal) that is near impossible to maintain using the same version of the same language.<br> <br>If you fear that it will be difficult to maintain code when moving to Perl 6 the problem lies more-often-than-not with the code being unmaintainable in the first place.<br> <br>If the worst comes to the worst it is likely possible to 'use perl 5;' so that horrid old perl 5.00001 hacks that should have been rewritten long ago can remain untouched.<br> <br>The move from perl 5 to 6 is considerably smaller than the move facing many using alternative platforms and languages -<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.net means a massive migration of legacy code for all MS developers - similar issues are occuring elsewhere.
