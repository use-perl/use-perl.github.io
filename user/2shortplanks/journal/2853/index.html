<p>So, <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/simon/">Simon</a> came to visit the



big smoke last night, so there was an emergency social meeting promply



aranaged, or as we like to think about it...we went to the pub.  <p>



Interesting pub, <a



href="http://grault.net/cgi-bin/grubstreet.pl?Marlborough_Head,_W1Y_1WD">The Malbrough Head</a> .  Hidden toilets (you have to walk through the



bookcase,) screaming loos, gargoyles and references to guts and death.



Interesting.  No-one tried the seven deadly sins cocktails.  <p> Simon talked about how he's been really busy at his day job, doing



interesting things.  We agreed that one of the annoying thing about



having an interesting day job where you get to code and do cool stuff



is that by the time you get home you're all coded out.  However, you



keep thinking about all the cool things that you've been not working



on all day long.  This is a common theme that comes up a lot it seems.  Oh well....Impatience is a virtue and all that.  <p>



Simon's given up drinking for lent (40 whole days) which kinda puts my



week short efforts to shame.  <p> MBM went to see <a href="http://www.stallman.org/">RMS</a> talk yesterday,



and so predictably we had a big old conversation about copyright and



patents, and IP and so on and so on.  I don't like copyright myself,



but don't think we've got anything better.  This moved onto a talk



about the law in this country, <a



href="http://www.stand.org.uk/">RIP</a>, police powers, etc.  In the



end we decided to see both sides of the argument, why people want the



powers and why they shouldn't have them.  Shades of grey.  <p> <a



href="http://use.perl.org/user/blech">blech</a> talked a bit more about



starting up an infobot design list for London.pm.  The Next Gen



infobot is one of those things often talked about, but no-one ever



gets round to creating one.  Kake wanted a bot that would wish you



happy birthday on your birthday.  I counted that teaching the bot when



your birthday started (mine starts midnight GMT but I'm not mercan)



would be hard.  I want a better todo interface to the bots.  <p> Blech



also wibbled for a bit about future meetings, both social and



technical.  I think he's got things under control.  <p> Other things



were talked about Neverwhere/Buffy/Angel, Hair, Non-CFT, Palms and the



Tube, Walking Places, Breaking New Years Resolutions, Power Cuts and



Lack Of Email, Drinking in pubs in your own, Cafes, Payday, Extreme



Banking and Last Orders</p>

<h2>Other stuff...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/pdcawley/">pdcawley</a> on 2002-02-14T10:20:03</h3>
We also came up with the concept of 'Stallman Bingo'. Actually, you probably don't really have to play it, but it would be fun to see his reaction if, say half way through one of his talks when he hit some new buzzword, someone were to say loudly, almost as if in agreement, 'Bingo!'.



<h2>Bots list and birthdays</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/blech/">blech</a> on 2002-02-25T18:13:25</h3>
There is now the infobot list mentioned in the journal, at <a href="http://london.pm.org/mailman/listinfo/bots" title="pm.org">http://london.pm.org/mailman/listinfo/bots </a pm.org>(although it's not an 'official' london.pm project).<br> <br>Also, purl on #perl manages a birthday list via a CGI, which is nice, although it doesn't wish new speakers happy birthday automatically.
