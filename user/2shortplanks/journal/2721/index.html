<p>Perl Mongers social last night.  Beer.  Odd Beer.  Good Beer.  Back
once again in the <a
href="http://london.pm.org/meetings/locations/cittieofyorke.html">Cittie
of Yorke</a>, down in the cellar.  Cool pub.  Needs a pool table ;-)
<p>
chrisc talked about scary bioinformatics stuff.  And you ever thought
you had a lot of data to process!  I bored him with talk of my recent
adventures with <a
href="http://2shortplanks.com/temp/tbt/">Test::Builder::Tester</a>.
Yey, tests.
<p>
<a href="http://use.perl.org/user/davorg">davorg</a> and <a
href="http://use.perl.org/user/acme">acme</a> kept muttering "Must finish
slides" under their breath, presumably to do with the upcoming <a
href="http://www.perlworkshop.de/">German Perl Workshop</a> where
they're both giving tutorials
<p>
<a href="http://use.perl.org/user/richardc">richardc</a> popped open his
(paper) notebook and wrote some new ideas down in it.  Something to do
with <a
href="http://search.cpan.org/search?dist=Devel-Cover">Devel::Cover</a>
on C code, taking over the world, and blaming me for really annoying
tests for <a
href="http://search.cpan.org/search?dist=Acme-Your">Acme::Your</a>
IIRC.
<p>
I brought with me qmacro's <a
href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/jabber/">Jabber</a> book and the
<a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/runblogslash/">Slash</a> book which quite a lot of people had a look at.
The latter is a silly (but possibly useful) book, the former is very
thick and is probably the definitive work on the subject.  Proper
reviews at a later date.  Davorg was pleasantly surprised to find
himself name checked in the slash book (referring to his <a
href="http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2001/01/tt2.html">perl.com article</a>
on the <a href="http://www.tt2.org">Template Toolkit</a>.)
<p>
Talking of Jabber mutated into a discussion with Ivor about monitoring
systems, writing graphical systems to tail log files, and finally
wrapping command line scripts with <a
href="http://projects.prosa.it/gtkperl/">Gtk with Perl</a>.  I'm still
thinking about that one, I've got some ideas...
<p>
Kake talked about <a href="http://grault.net/grubstreet/">grubstreet
project</a> (the London wiki.)  She also tried to convince me to use
mutt to read my mail (sorry, I'm sticking to PINE for the
pointy-clickness - at least I'm not using Outlook)
<p>
<a href="http://use.perl.org/user/muttley/">muttley</a> was still
recovering from <a href="http://dorkbot.org/">Dorkbot</a> and talked a
bit about that.  <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/blech/">blech</a> was
still raving about playing <a href="http://www.u-ga.com/rez/">Rez</a>
on a huge projector.  Sweet.  Oh, and talking about arranging other
things such as the next social and the next tech meet.  Herding cats.
<p>
davorg talked more about <a
href="http://nms-cgi.sourceforge.net/">NMS</a>.  Some fights he had
fought.  Some new ideas.  Organising things and Project Management.
Scary, but highly cool, stuff.
<p>
And other things were discussed;  The uselessness of the NHS;  Accidental
forkbombing;  From Hell;  Running out of hash space in main memory; 
Primary Schools; Playstation Linux; Doodling; 
Perl and Branding and Press Coverage and how it's all going to go wrong;
Let's all stop being ill; Java verses C verses Perl (TMTOWTDI); More trips
to Amsterdam;  Going for a curry? ; CVs; CVS;  Missing people;  My
Dog Is An Alien Dot Com; BBC and domain squatting;  We all hate our jobs;
We all love our jobs;  Another beer?  Go on then.

<h2>Drinking?</h2>

So your new year's resolution went out the window then?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)

Ah, it was only for a week.  A detox rather than not drinking at all.
<p>
Of course, I've broken quite a few of my other new years resolutions.  But ssssh....</p>
