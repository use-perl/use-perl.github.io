<p>Yawn.
<p>
So, yesterday being the day after the first Wednesday of the month, it was time for our usual Perl Mongers get-together.
<p>
A reasonable number of new faces turned up, plus most of the old faces.  Old faces and new faces combined, we took up a sizeable section of the <a href="http://london.pm.org/meetings/locations/penderel.html">Penderel's Oak.</a>  Much beer was ordered, and TVRs drunk.  People didn't recognise me with no beard and shorter hair.  Hmm.
<p>
<a href="http://use.perl.org/users.pl?nick=simon">Simon</a> turned up and proceeded to tap away on his laptop and generally explained what he'd been up to since TPC with Parrot.  <a href="http://use.perl.org/users.pl?nick=davorg">Davorg</a> convinced me to work with <a href="http://use.perl.org/users.pl?nick=blech">blech</a> and <a href="http://use.perl.org/users.pl?nick=ranguard">Ranguard</a> to do some more of the immediate NMS stuff.  <a href="http://use.perl.org/users.pl?nick=muttley">Muttley</a> started a conversation a random conversation about music that when I turned my back for twenty seconds had suddenly changed into a discussion about 6502 assembler.  <a href="http://use.perl.org/users.pl?nick="dumrats">dumrats</a> blamed <<a href="http://use.perl.org/users.pl?nick="acme">acme</a> for certain photos.  I had various discussions with people about what the state of the UK job market and house market.   Some people needed to employ people, some people needed jobs.  Oh, and finally <a href="http://use.perl.org/users.pl?nick=unimatrix">Unimatrix</a> and Simon and I had a discussion about mad art we've seen around the globe.  Must get someone to herd cats to another art gallery sometime soon.
<p>
At the end of a pleasant evening I tried to sneak off to catch a bus home, but was alas thwarted by a shout from someone in the group spotting me walking off.  I don't think I've seen anything more terrifying than a large group of Perl Mongers all shouting (even if it is only 'goodbye') at once ;-)</p>
