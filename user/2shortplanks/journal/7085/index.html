Last Thursday was the official London Perl Mongers meeting.  The New
Heretics had held their meeting a week earlier (on the first Thursday
of the month rather than the official day after the first Wednesday of
the month.)  Since they both were in pubs, I went to both.

<p>

This week <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/acme/">acme</a>, <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/james/">james</a> and I (and later Nick) talked about <a href="http://www.yapc.org/Europe/2002/">YAPC</a>.  We're
all <a href="http://www.yapc.org/Europe/2002/speakers.html">speaking</a> this year.  james and acme are doing over an hour and a
half each, and both Nick and I are doing 45 minutes (and Greg's doing
45 himself) meaning that London.pm is speaking for about six and a
half hours this year.  Funky.

<p>

We, with <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/ranguard/">Ranguard</a> and <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/blech">blech</a>, morphed this conversation into one about
setting up a mini conference.  The idea that YAPC, while being an
order of magnitude cheaper than OSCON, was still too expensive.  The
expenses were tied up in the things that YAPC couldn't do anything
about - accommodation and flights.  So, the solution as we see it is to
have a 'mini-conference' that lasts only a day, meaning people can go
home after it's done, and only really involve people from the UK (others
still welcome, but make it small enough that we don't have to rely on
them)

<p>

There was much discussion about this - where it would be (hmm, venue for
300 people, hmm), who would come (UK people, London.pm and the other
people who don't get a chance to meetings) who would speak (The UK has
some big names,) how much it would cost (very little, cover the venue
and the speakers and provide nothing else - not even muffins,) and 
when to have it (eerk, try not to clash with other conferences.)

<p>

It's all very much pie in the sky atm.  Though it does seem like a
good idea, if we can ever get organised, and if we see if there's
demand.
 
<p>

<a href="http://use.perl.org/user/davorg/">davorg</a> talked about his <a href="http://use.perl.org/article.pl?sid=02/08/07/1055215">new role</a> as the overall coordinator for all
the Perl Monger groups.  I think what he's trying to do sounds really good
 - though he's still working out the details.  I promised to help him
and acme, and reminded acme that he promised to help me with some
<a href="http://www.template-toolkit.org/pipermail/template-axkit/2002-July/thread.html">Template/Axkit</a> stuff.  Ranguard and I chatted with blech about
applying this to the london.pm.org website, and plans were made.

<p>

mbm turned up and shouted abuse at davorg across the room.  Greg
didn't turn up and buy us beer as promised.  aef showed us his new
digital camera (which acme complained about when he took too many
<a href="http://2799.org/photos/geek/lpm_Aug2002/index.html">pictures</a> - irony strikes.)  <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/zool/">zool</a> totally failed to tell us about
<a href="http://www.dorkbot.org/">dorkbot</a> as she was engrossed in a conversation with <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/robin/">robin</a> that I
couldn't make heads or tails of.  Jasper and andym also wibbled on
about something totally non-linear too.  <a href="http://www.youngs.co.uk/htmldocs/products/products.asp?SelectedID=13">Waggledance</a> is excellent.  A
large tip was left with the remains of the kitty and we staggered back
home.

<h2>a mini conference</h2>

Seems a great idea, particularly for those on a tight budget or with time constraints. Make sure there's some decent beer nearby...
