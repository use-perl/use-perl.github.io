<p>So, I've been really lax in keeping up with my journal over YAPC::Europe.
As you can guess, that was because I was busy.

<p>

Let's see, what have I been doing with my days?  

<p>

I've listened to many talks.  The ones that stick out are the <a href="http://belfast.yapc.org/wiki/index.cgi?CreatingCrossPlatformGUIProgramsInPerl">talk
on WxPerl</a> (short summary: It may be the best tool for the job but
it's not a good enough tool to use if that's not what you need
the tool to do,) <a href="http://belfast.yapc.org/wiki/index.cgi?UsingPerlToDealWithMicrosoftExcelFiles">Spreadsheet::WriteExcel</a> (soon: charts!)
<a href="http://belfast.yapc.org/wiki/index.cgi?AMatterOfCharacter">Unicode</a> (databases are fun,) and <a
href="http://belfast.yapc.org/wiki/index.cgi?UsenetGems">Usenet
Gems</a> (substr in lvalue context can be odd.) There were also
gazillions (well, twenty) <a href="http://belfast.yapc.org/wiki/index.cgi?LightningTalks">lightning talks</a> I watched and they
were all really interesting.

<p>

I gave <a href="http://2shortplanks.com/talks/yapce2004/">three
talks</a>.  The one talk I knew I was giving before I got there
was on bundling.  I then found out from Geoff I'd had a lightning
talk accepted (on Perl and UTF8) and I ended up padding out the
end of the WWW Smackdown talk session with an hour from my CPAN
Modules talk (in the process of I drunk half a litre of water and
still had a dry throat by the end.)  I think they all went well
in the end, and considering I wasn't expecting to give so many
before I arrived, I think I did okay.

<p>

Of course the best thing about YAPC is the chance to meet up with
people who I don't get to see that often.  In addition to many of
London.pm who don't make it to every social meet, there was
Birmingham, Paris and Stockholm Perl Mongers in full effect.  If
I spend time listing all the people who I got to speak to - only
briefly - I'd be here all evening.  In the end I got my
mini-axkit-bof.  And I sat in many a scary conversation
(including Tim Bunce on the problems with utf8 and databases
which has given me quite a bit to think about.)

<p>

What have I been doing with my evenings?  We boozed the Tuesday
night at the crown, on Wednesday I went for sushi and then headed
home early (and ended up hacking automatic unicode handing into
Spreadsheet::WriteExcel,) and on Thursday we all headed off to <a
href="http://www.theodyssey.co.uk/">the odyssey centre</a> where
we split off and ran around doing all kinds of mad things (I had
tapas, played air hockey, watched people bowl, play pool and shoot
zombies, and of course went to one of the bars.)  I tried to stay
out of the Crown <em>too</em> much, and almost succeeded most of
the time.  And Friday night?  I'm sitting in the airport watching
planes land and writing this (wireless++).

<p>

All in all it was a great conference, it had it's highs and it's
lows.  But in the end Karen, Marty, and all the orange clad
helping crew did an excellent job.  Now all I have to do is sit
down and go though my notes and work out all the interesting titbits
I've learnt so I can write them up here.</p>

I left YAPC on Thursday so I didn't get a chance to talk to you about this. Which is a shame.
</p><p>
I received your email (but not the patch). My replies, I guess, are in your spam traps.
</p><p>
Anyway, automatic handling of Unicode under perl 5.8 is a very good idea so I've added it to the write() methods for the next release and I'll implement it everywhere else in the release after that.
</p><p>
Thanks.
