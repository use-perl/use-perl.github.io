<p><b>6.06am GMT (UTC), Heathrow (Waiting for the bus to Gatwick)</b>

<p>

The wedding was wonderful; The bride was beautiful, the service was
amazing and the reception was merry.  I tired myself out playing
cricket with my nephew.  Staggered back home only to realise that even
though I'm traveling by eticket I might need to know the number.  So,
several cursed words and application of long nosed pliers later I
managed to connect the household PC to the interweb, only to find that
virgin hadn't sent me a eticket at all (or I'd deleted it.)  The
helpful woman on the phone tells me I have to ask at the main virgin
desk at Gatwick this morning.

<p>

Four and a half scant hours of sleep only interrupted by a SMS from
acme later...

<p>

The bus from Chippenham was fifteen minutes late arriving.  And the
first thing the driver asked me was "Do you know the way back to the
M4 from here?"  I would be annoyed if the driver wasn't such a decent
bloke, and we hadn't just spent the last two hours shooting the shit.
And I've just watched the dawn come up along the M4.  I can feel the
surreal edge of any YAPC trip kicking in, and I haven't even left
the country yet.

<p>

<b>8.13am GMT (UTC), Pizza Express Gatwick</b>

<p>

Fading fast.  Stating to feel nausious though lack of sleep
(<b>must</b> sleep on the plane.)  Have ordered breakfast - let's see
if that sorts me out.  Lack of eticket wasn't a problem.  Maybe
watching "Saving Private Ryan" isn't such a good idea when
semi-asleep.  Where's the damn free wireless in this place?

<p>

<b>9.58am GMT (UTC), Gate 35 Gatwick</b>

<p>

Went through security.  No-one swabbed my shoes this time (unlike when
I went to Geneva.)  Remembered I didn't buy travel insurance so had to
pick up an instant insurance pack from the airport, which is terribly
expensive and doesn't cover most cases (for example, if my Mac gets
knicked, they'll pay out 200ukp...)  OTOH, I can now (literally) afford
to break my leg.  I always forget that when you go outside the EU you
actually have to pay for treatment of such things.  Still no
wireless...turning Airport off for flight now.

<p>

<b>2.05pm GMT (UTC), The Atlantic Ocean, 2995 miles to Florida</b>

<p>

Okay, so they inspected my shoes during boarding.  I should have
bought a bottle of water with me to drink on the plane.  Might
actually try and update my slides now.

<p>

<b>7.51am EDT, The Conference Center</b>

<p>

Yey! Got lots of work done on my slides.  I want to tweak a couple
more examples, but that's done.  Also watched two movies and didn't
die.  Bonus.

<p>

Nine hours of flight and I was itching to get off the plane.  American
customs are no fun whatsoever, and they asked all kinds of annoying
questions.  At least whenever I was stopped, the first question I
was asked is "Where you're flying in from?" and as soon as I said the
U.K. I was waved through.

<p>

Information at the airport directed me to the free bus to the train
station (free!)  Walked outside...wow.  First up, it was wonderful
sunshine when I left London.  But it's raining here.  Raining and like
80% humidity.  Wow.  Run for the aircon!  Caught the train to Boca
Raton, which was about a tenth the cost it would be to travel on the
UK rail.  Met Mark Overmeer getting off the train and we debated the
the cost of catching a cab.  A helpful police officer asked us where
we were going, and then pointed out that the hotel was literally just
round the corner.  D'oh.

<p>

Finally made it to the hotel.  Oooh!  A Pool! A Pool!  Found acme,
james and Pierre who had apparently been spending all day sorting out
the Fotango sponsored badges for the conference (in between lounging
by the pool and abusing the wireless.)  A quick swim later and fifty
or so geeks head off to this Sushi Buffet.  Really!  Sushi.  Buffet.
What a concept.

<p>

uri made a brave effort to organise us but was thwarted by the staff
trying to help him out and charge everyone for what they've eaten
(instead of just letting us say "here...take 35bucks off this credit
card").  Back for last orders at the bar at the hotel which was at a
disturbingly early 10pm.  Pool.  Hot-tub.  Realising at 11pm that I'd
been up for 26 hours, and maybe it was time to go to bed to get
up bright and early for the conference.
