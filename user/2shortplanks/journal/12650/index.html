<p>London.pm went back to the Star this month for it's regular social
meeting.  It seemed more packed than last time - though I guess that
could be because the room is smaller.

<p>

There was a lot of talk about the various conferences that are coming
up.  Who's going?  Who's not?  gellyfish thinking of backing out since
his birthday's in the middle and he doesn't trust people to drink
responsibly.  Other people promising to make it next year.  Other
people saying that hearing about it they'd like to come.  It's all
coming together - deadline for signing up with essuu is Monday IIRC.

<p>

Related to this several people asked me about talking at the next tech
meet - especially if their slides get picked for YAPC::Europe (the
next London tech meet is the Thursday before YAPC.)  Must sort out
this (and a venue) soon.

<p>

jerakeen and I started a crazy talk about the Template Toolkit.  He
had some crazy scheme where he wanted to pass a object into TT's
process method rather than a hash, and have TT call the object's
methods to get things.  davorg suggested he post the idea to the TT
mailing list and let the now amazingly less busy Andy and Darren in on
the idea.  davorg and I chatted about the new TT book, and how he,
Andy, Darren and gnat have been worked really hard on it recently.

<p>

There were some people at the meet that I haven't seen in ages.
Shevek (from Bath.pm) was in town to pick up a rack for his bedroom,
and scared muttley with some of his work on virtual machine security.
Bob was far below form having been drinking in the Star the night
before for a company party.  Spurkis started a really bad trend of
asking people in the room what they wanted to drink, meaning that
fourteen pint rounds weren't that uncommon (though they were paid out
of the kitty, so it's not as bad as it sounds.)  When it was my turn I
wrote down what everyone wanted and simply handed the list to the
bar lady - it was just easier.

<p>

Various people involved in siesta chatted about various things
though out the evening - adding more output types for marriachi (RSS?)
and how that should be handled (yet another pipeline?)  simon
had a couple of suggestions for getting the summary information out
of emails.

<p>

Marna turned up and handed me a pile of books to read that I'd asked
her for on irc.  Evil Dave told me about a ORA party that I can't go
to since I'm off at YAPC::NA.  And I finally got to talk to Todd right
at the end of the evening, a guy who'd mailed me offlist and I'd been
meaning to talk to at the start of it.  He's developing a business
providing mail systems for IT professionals and looking for someone
with Perl skills to come aboard the project.  Anyone want in?

<p>

We (well I) totally failed to sort out where we're going next month
for our social, or where we're going for drinks with Perrin Harkins on
Wednesday 25th June when he's over. Suggestions to the usual place
(i.e. the mailing list.)
</p>

Actually it was today (Friday 6th) but since I probably lack tuits to put everything together to send to the agents before the end of the day, I can easily extend the deadline until <strong>Monday morning</strong>.

Do you want to post to the list (normal, not annouce) reminding people this?<br/><br/>Thanks for all your help.<br/><br/>Mark.
