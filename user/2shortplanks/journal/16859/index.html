<p>So, the tech meet's finally organised.  As usual I had only about
an hours worth of talks until I pointed this out to people and
then a million and one people said "Oh, don't you remember that time
in that pub that place where I asked you about doing that talk that
time" and now we're up to our usual hectic two hours.  We'll have
to see how it goes on Monday.
<p>
I'm getting increasingly aware of the fact that I've let a few things
slip.  I haven't patched Test::DatabaseRow yet, even though petdance
sent me patches almost a month ago.  Damn, must get round to that this
w/e.  I haven't been keeping up with the TT stuff as much as I'd like.
<p>
Spoke to Andy Wardley in the pub last night and there was much
scribbling on paper about TT3.  I told andy about a bunch of stuff I'd
coded (and even released to the CPAN) that I'd forgotten to mail the
list about.  Must. Do. That.  Also Must Subscribe to TT3 List.
<p>
Spoke to Simon Wardley about BCS (which is going okay atm ) and about
the Mini-perl conf.  I need to catch up with davorg now.
<p>
Other things are quite pressing too.  This should be a fun w/e.
