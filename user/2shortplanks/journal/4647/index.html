<div class="span8">
<p>Woohoo, another social meet!  At The <a
href="http://london.pm.org/meetings/locations/cittieofyorke.html">Cittie
Of Yourke</a>.  But this time with the <em>whole</em> downstairs bar.
London.pm meets are getting bigger.  Lots of drinking.  <a
href="http://icsf.org.uk">ICSF</a> seem to be increasing their
presence in London.pm and helped with the consumption of booze.  Note
to the pubs: starting new bar staff on a 'quiet' evening with London.pm
may not be such a good idea.

<p>

I started off the evening talking to <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/natalief/">natalief</a> and aef about the need for
coworkers to talk to.  My boss was away for most of yesterday, and when
he got back I sat him down and explained the problem I was having, and he
spotted the mistake (I was releasing the parent object which had
in it's DESTROY method a close of the database handle it created, even
though I was still using it.)  Often enough it's just good enough to explain
the problem to someone else and you spot it yourself.  My mother (an accountant) used to do this
with me when I was young - and even though I didn't understand any of it
it always helped her.

<p>

I brought along the review copy of <a
href="http://www.peachpit.com/books/catalog/K5815.html">Learning CGI
and Perl for the World Wide Web</a> that I'm reviewing.  Showed it to
many people, reactions were mixed.  I should be done reviewing that
sometime this week.  I've got a good idea what I want to say, but I'm
reading it all to make sure I haven't missed anything.

<p>

I'm also working on some other reviews.  I've got a review copy of <a
href="http://www.manning.com/shigeoka/index.html">Instant Messaging in
Java (The Jabber Protocol)</a> which I'm going to do a comparison
against <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/jabber/">Programming
Jabber</a>.  That should be fun but it's a lot of material to cover.  Alex
turned up and handed me some fiction to review as well.

<p>

Alex gave <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/dumrats/">dumrats</a> a XML
book for him to review and dumrats and I ended up in a conversation
about what we like and dislike from our textbooks.  To give an
example, did we prefer the simplicity of Instant Messaging with its
focus on just Java or did we prefer Programming Jabber with it's
broader range of languages?

<p>

Nigel and I talked about what we'd been up to.  I bored him on the
latest changes to <a
href="http://2shortplanks.com/temp/tbt/">Test::Builder::Tester</a>.
It now supports all versions of Perl since 5.004 inclusive (with help
from <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/richardc/">richardc</a>'s machine with many many perls installed on it.)  It
also has vastly more readable pod (with thanks to my editor Kake, who
send me major patches)

<p>

<a href="http://use.perl.org/user/randuard/">Ranguard</a> and I attacked
<a href="http://use.perl.org/user/blech/">blech</a> and demanded to know
plans for the technical meeting.  He said he'd sort them out today and
then mumbled something about more booze.  We probably should have
cornered him before that late stage in the evening.

<p>

grue, shortly to depart to Australia, ran around taking <a href="http://unixbeard.net/user/richardc/Photos/2002-05-02/">photos</a> with richardc's
digital camera, natalie took some shots with a real camera, and blech
managed to get some rather <a
href="http://husk.org/pics/index.cgi?browse=london.pm-2002-05-02">intesting
photos</a> of his own (including some <a
href="http://husk.org/pics/index.cgi?view=london.pm-2002-05-02/playing_with_leia_hair.jpg">evidence</a>
that Beth should not be let anywhere near Phil ever again.)

<p>

Nik and I talked about his company, what he's up to, and why we
shouldn't ever let him drink as many redbulls as he did the meeting at
<a href="http://london.pm.org/meetings/locations/doggetts.html">Doggetts</a> after last year's linux expo.  Sounds like fun.  essuu
reminded us that it's his last day at work today, and we talked about
his plans to take over the world, or at least get up later next week.

<p>

Various people had been involved or effected one way or another in the
<a
href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/uk/newsid_1960000/1960904.stm">mayday
protests</a>, though most of them just because they worked in the
local area and had a hard job getting lunch.  Some humorous stories,
and media inaccuracies were told and exposed.

<p>

In other news; space in a skirt (faint); chrisc and Imran in a conversation
about the Dreamcast and PS2 (which muttley wasn't involved in, faint); The
pros and cons of triple gin and tonics; Dropping keys; Drinking in Earls
Court; There's a Very Big Wall on That There Prison; Here kitty kitty kitty....
