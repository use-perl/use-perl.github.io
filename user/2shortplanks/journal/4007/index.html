<p>...for the smalltalk programmer in the corner please.
<p>
Thursday saw once again another London.pm social meeting.  The <a
href="http://london.pm.org/meetings/locations/cittieofyorke.html">Cittie
of Yourke</a> is fast becoming our new regular boozer it would seem.
The meeting was busy, with us streching over the edge of our half of
the basement bar, forcing us to colonise the area nearer the beer
supply.
<p>
<a href="http://use.perl.org/user/dumrats">dumrats</a> talked about some
crazy crazy scheme involving bidding for random items on ebay.  I
won't spoil with the details, but let me assue you that the concept
was very crack fueled.
<p>
I spoke seperatly to Nigel and <a
href="http://use.perl.org/user/mstevens">mstevens</a> about <a
href="http://london.pm.org/mailman/listinfo/london.class">Java</a> and
Perl.  mstevens and I are still looking into Java more and more.  As I
said, I don't like favoring any one language - I want to use the best
tool for the job.  90% of the time this tool is Perl...but I refuse to
be blinkered and shut out other things.  Incidentally, this is why I
think that this month's The Perl Review was so good...  Anyway...
<p>
<a href="http://use.perl.org/user/james">james</a> talked about the
madness that is his conversion of Perl 5 code into parrot code by
running Perl 5 through perl and then using the B (backend) modules to
access the abstract syntax tree.  To quote the man "I'll be happy if I
can get 90% of the code to work...we'll see about the rest."  Good
Luck james.
<p>
I asked <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/pdcawley">pdcawley</a> about his
opinions on the latest <a
href="http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2002/04/01/exegesis4.html">exegesis</a>.
He liked it.  No surprise there then.  james offered his doubts on the
unary dot prefix being able to parsed as "this" or "self."  Hmmm. I
may have to agree with him.
<p>
<a href="http://use.perl.org/user/richardc/">richardc</a> and I suprised Kake with the fact that emacs can do that
MSWord/Abiword thing of highlighting words that are misspelt and
allowing you to click on them to get a context menu of alternatives.
(Click on the bit that says '(Fundamental)' or '(C-Perl)' in the
status bar with the right mouse button and select "Fly-Spell Mode)
<p>
<a href-"http://use.perl.org/user/robin/">robin</a> turned up and we
chatted about trying to prove that his <a
href="http://www.puffinry.freeserve.co.uk/regex-extension.html">adaptations</a>
to the regular expression engine could now parse any context free
grammar.  This was quite hard to grasp after much beer.  Interestingly
we'd both thought about approaching the problem in a different manner.
<p>
<a href="http://use.perl.org/user/blech/">blech</a> gave away copies of DJAdams' Jabber Book and the Slash book for
review (both of which I've already read,) and tried to flog a few more
<a href="http://thegestalt.org/tshirts/">tshirts</a>.  Nicolas chatted a
lot about the complications of utf8 and other encoding schemes in perl
5.8.0.  He made my head hurt so I ran away.
<p>
veeg and I talked about stuff, and wondered a bit about wrist and 
arm pain caused by computer usage (what is commonly referred to as
RSI.)  desnarf, putting his first appearance in at meetings for many
many months was convinced to try the local stout.
<p>
Grue, hugged everybody, at least three times.  <a
href="http://use.perl.org/user/sphyg">sphyg</a> talked about
birthdays.  dumrats talked about weird cupboards in the toilets until I
fed him scotch.  Chris and I talked about the woes of working.  Evil
Dave and richardc got port.  I helped consume it.
<p>
Finally, I talked to everyone about the fact that my todo list seems
to get longer, as I always put more things on it than I take off.
<p>
<i>
&lt;Trelane&gt; my fun todo?<br>
&lt;dipsy&gt; trelane, your fun todo is install slash on intranet server, gtk
wrapper for sudo, Test::GD, GD::TextImage,   add things to grubstreet, read
the jabber book  or patch T::P::XML::DOM documentation, write documentation
for TT and XML, write an rsync backup scripts or  makepm script or tidy up
Test::Accessor and CPAN it or patch Carp's docu or merge
Template::Plugin::Filter or fix tickets on RT or thunk about Test::Set
</i></p>

<h2>Perl6 unary .</h2>

<blockquote><div>I asked pdcawley about his opinions on the latest exegesis. He liked it. No surprise there then. james offered his doubts on the unary dot prefix being able to parsed as "this" or "self." Hmmm. I may have to agree with him.</div></blockquote> <br> <br>So might I. I'm in the process of writing an initially small schemish interpreter in Perl 6 and I'm starting to confuse myself with unary dot.<br> <br>Here's a relatively common idiom from some of my code:<blockquote><div> <tt>method foo($bar) {<br>&nbsp; given<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.some_attrib {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; when<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.baz {<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.do_something_with($bar) } # Oh, hang on, I wanted that to go to '$self'<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...<br>&nbsp; }<br>}</tt> </div></blockquote>As soon you introduce a given/when block or any other topicalizer, unary dot stops refering to the current object and starts pointing at 'this'. Which is generally what you want; it's a remarkably handy idiom. Even in the cases where I could get by with if/else I've tended to use given/when/default because of the topicalization. <br> <br>But this means that, if you need to refer to a method's object inside a when block, you've got to reintroduce the object as an explicit parameter<blockquote><div> <tt>method foo($self: $bar) {<br>&nbsp; given<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.some_attrib {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; when<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.baz { $self.do_something_with($bar) }<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...<br>&nbsp; }<br>}</tt> </div></blockquote>Which is sort of okay. But then it's easier to always use an explicit <tt>$self</tt> in case you end up introducing a given/when later.<br> <br>I confess, I can argue this both ways. When I'm doing all out OO programming I don't often resort to switches anyway so the problem sort of goes away but for casual programming (and for getting the tests to pass before I realise I should extract a class or two and recast the switches as polymorphic method calls) they are great. I want them now.<br>

So, how do you get the context menu listing the spelling alternatives with just the keyboard?

M-$ while your cursor is within the word.

Oddly, that doesn't unhighlight the word after I've corrected it.<br> <br>Oh well.
