<p>So, like, <a href="http://use.perl.org/users.pl?nick=unimatrix">unimatrix</a> came to town.  Why's he here?  "Good Question" he says.  Apparently it turned out to be a holiday, but I've known unimatrix to fly to London for a pint or two in the past so it's not that unheard of.
<p>
Anyway, so being sans irc (the horror, the horror) he asked me to organise a get-together.  So I did, in the <a href="http://www.henandchickens.com">Hen and Chickens</a>.  So about ten perl mongers turned up and then we proceded to drink (it being the done thing in these situations.)  True to perl monger form everyone turned up early and <a href="http://use.perl.org/users.pl?nick=acme">acme</a>, <a href="http://use.perl.org/users.pl?nick=muttley">muttley</a> and unimatrix actually had to drag me to the pub three quarters of an hour before things were due to start. It's a hard life ;-).  After that all back to mine for pizza and red wine.  I must apologise to my guests for not having a large enough stock of this, but bully for them not wanting to move onto the spirits.
<p>
Some Perl was talked.  I waffled quite a bit about a concept I'm having for doing apache like handlers in <a href="http://poe.perl.org">POE</a> (where each item in the chain can decline or accept the object) where everything is passed back and forth through the POE event loop, concurrently like.   I'm still re-writing the documentation (throwing one away) so we'll have to see if that actually comes to anything or gets abandoned.  Unimatrix praised Parse::RecDescent, and then came up with some mad talk about a secondary simpler documenting grammar that you code inline with the main grammar.  Acme talked about the <a href="http://astray.com/services/">stuff</a> he'd been doing with dipsy and SOAP::Lite.  Then muttley chimed in, to explain what would be  a perfect Perl project:  Something that used POE, Template Toolkit, and SOAP::Lite and did it using Inline and Attributes, and possibly Q::S.  Maybe that 
should be in Klingon too.
<p>
Must drink tea and rush to work now.</p>
