<p>Well, I guess the main thing to say here is that IÃ¢â¬â¢ve made it back to my parentsÃ¢â¬â¢ house in one bit and IÃ¢â¬â¢m getting my nose back onto the perl grindstone ;-)<br/><br/>This weekend IÃ¢â¬â¢ve been up in the fields surrounding Birmingham for a friendÃ¢â¬â¢s wedding.  The bride was beautiful, the groom respectable (once the beard and eye-ring had been removed,) the setting picturesque, and yes, yes, the drink was free flowing.  Pints of green drink badÃ¢â¬Â¦.<br/><br/>On the train on the way to the wedding I listened to DamianÃ¢â¬â¢s keynote speech from YAPC::NA (arenÃ¢â¬â¢t laptops great?)  DamianÃ¢â¬â¢s a really good speaker and it was pretty easy to follow even though I didnÃ¢â¬â¢t have any of the visual aids.  A year ago at YAPC::Europe 19100 I remember feeling a great sense of trepidation about Perl 6; Change is risky and I wasnÃ¢â¬â¢t sure what we were going to end up with.  Almost a year on and IÃ¢â¬â¢m *still* not sure what weÃ¢â¬â¢re going to end up with Ã¢â¬â but now IÃ¢â¬â¢ve got confidence in the way things are going and IÃ¢â¬â¢m pretty sure IÃ¢â¬â¢m going to love the end result.<br/><br/>Whilst returning to my parentsÃ¢â¬â¢ place, I chose to break my journey in Bath and see a couple of Bath perl moungers.  Bath is Bath and not a lot has changed.<br/><br/>While waiting for the train to leave Bath I had a odd London.pm perl monger moment.  Tapping away at my keyboard at some perl I look up to see Anthony Stewart Head and Alyson Hannigan waiting for the train (along with a rapidly growing throng of fans.)  Since I had no particular reason to harass people simply trying to use public transport I left them alone (though itÃ¢â¬â¢s a shame I didnÃ¢â¬â¢t have my copy of programming perl on me, a signed copy would have had made an excellent auction at YAPC::Europe.)  Public transport of course chose to repay me by rerouting the train via another line that doesnÃ¢â¬â¢t have my home town on it, forcing me to take a bus replacement Ã¢â¬â but thatÃ¢â¬â¢s another (much more boring) story.<br/><br/>On the NMS front, this weekend IÃ¢â¬â¢ve been going over the code and think thereÃ¢â¬â¢s a few things I need to change to the dev site before it becomes useful.  For example, IÃ¢â¬â¢ve got a RSS editor of sorts, but itÃ¢â¬â¢s all a bit slap-dash at the moment and needs to be one module rather than lots of pithy cgi scripts.  Time to look at CGI::Application I think.  The trouble with the large number of small scripts is the lack of documentation and testing that the structure leads to, and as IÃ¢â¬â¢m a documentation, then tests, then code kind of programmer IÃ¢â¬â¢m not happy with the situation.  So, that, along with the task of getting my Linux laptop to talk to the parentÃ¢â¬â¢s computer and via that the net, is the main task for tomorrow.  Not forgetting to watch Hollioaks of course.
