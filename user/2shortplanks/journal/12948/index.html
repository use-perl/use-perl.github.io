<p>Tuesday morning came around pretty quickly, and after a quick
breakfast at the hotel we dragged ourselves to the conference.
I spent the morning watching sky's talk on threads.  I'd seen
a version of this talk before at a YAPC::Europe, but having
forgotten it all hence and this talk being much longer, I
thought I'd see it again.  This was a very good move - I learned
a lot, and I'm itching to see if I can take advantage
of this to get some of my programs running twice as fast on
my dual CPU machines at work.

<p>

At lunch Pierre and I spent a little time bashing out a quick script
that spit out wiki formatting for all the photo badges.  They're
located <a href="http://yapc.kwiki.org/index.cgi?Attendees">here</a>.
All the photos are hosted on my site - I'm glad I don't have metered
bandwidth.

<p>

After Lunch I went to see Ingy talk about Extreme modules (XP style
module work.)  The very brave man gave his talk directly from the
conference wiki, and there was no surprise as people edited his slides
as he was presenting them.  Silly Ingy.

<p>

Ingy broke early so we could go see the lightning talks.  That was
one very very packed room.  All of the speakers completed on time
and there were some very good talks.  Quite a lot of the speakers
were first time speakers, and they did really well (in fact, I
only found out that they were first time speakers from Geoff Avery
later on in the evening.)

<p>

We all walked over to Grand Palm (the main meeting room) for dinner.
but alas...the catering service had screwed up and thought we were
coming on Wednesday not Tuesday.  All bow down to the power of the
almighty cooperate cock up.  Domino's were rang, and pizza for two
hundred people (no kidding..) was ordered.  Wow.

<p>

Then there was the auction.  I managed to get my hands on a couple of
books I'd been wanting to buy.  I also purchased the final proofs for
Perl 6 Essentials.  acme got himself auctioned.  merlyn let me push
him up on buying the right to insert a comment into the perl source
code.  All in all much fun.  Having the ability to pay by credit card
was very useful.  Over three thousand dollars was raised for YAS.

<p>

In the evening we went to see the Matrix Reloaded.  We'd booked an
entire cinema for YAPC attendees, and since most people had seen
the film already there was much jeering at the screen.  Trinity looks
at Neo:  "What is it, what's wrong Neo?"  Voice from the back "I can't
act".  "Emote damnit".  "Woha".  You get the idea.  So much fun
I almost died laughing.  I think we totally ruined the film for
Pierre who hadn't seen it before though.  C'est la vie.

<p>

Back to the hotel.  Pool.  Drinks.  Discussion of Perl, life, the
universe and why American Guinness is pasturised (yech!)  Bed at
two a.m. (way too late considering I'm speaking on Wednesday.)</p>

<h2>Heckling @ 'Matrix Reloaded'</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/prakash/">prakash</a> on 2003-06-19T14:41:20</h3>
My favorite comment:
<p>
Guy-in-white says something.<br>Neo responds: bullsh*t.<br>Guy-in-white: Denial is the first response of a human being to anything they don't like (or something like that)
</p><p>
Someone shouts: <b>No, it's not.</b>

</p><p>
It was my first time watching the movie too. But I thoroughly enjoyed the heckling more than the movie itself.

My first time too, didn't stop me heckling. Or nodding off during the car chase

My favorite heckle was during the (overly boring and exceedingly tedious) restaurant scene: <i>how long to the next fight scene?</i>

I confess that I spent most of the restaurant scene wondering what on earth the pink prong sticking out of the whatsisname's salad was.

Sounds like the fun my friends &amp; I had when we saw "Independence Day" when it came out -- it was like a homemade MST3K episode. Every time two characters are in a room together, we'd should out the line from "Airplane": "I know this is a bit forward of me, but you see I've never been with a space alien before, and well..."
<p> The heckling was much more fun than the movie<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>

I first saw The Matrix at the first YAPC.  We heckled that one, too!
