<div class="span8">
<p>Well, this weekend has been pretty busy perl hacking.

<p>

Mostly I've been working on a module called - for now - Test::GD.  The

idea behind the module is that it does what Test::More does for

strings, but for GD images.  With it you can write a selections of

tests to say things like "this image should be 200x200 in size" or

"the pixel at (25,12) should be red".  And the module will either

print out "ok 1 - image size" if it's okay or "not ok 1 - image size"

followed by some debug information if it's not, in Test::Harness

compatible way.

<p>

This is of course all based on <a href="http://search.cpan.org/doc/MSCHWERN/Test-Simple-0.41/lib/Test/Builder.pm">Test::Builder</a>.  And I'm testing that

with my Test::Builder::Test module.  You may recal me chatting about

this a bit in <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/2shortplanks/journal/2641">previous journal entries</a> - it's a module that allows you

to test tests by declaring what they're going to produce in advance

and then running the tests and comparing the exected and actual

output.  Well, there's nothing like using a module in anger to shake it

up a bit and realise what features you needed to add!

<p>

The first function I added was a function that determines what line

number a statement is on, rather than hard coding in the line numbers

into the expected debug output of the test.  Now rather than saying

<p>

<tt><pre>  test_err("#&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Failed test ($0 at line 12)";</pre></tt></pre></tt>

<p>

I can say

<p>

<tt><pre>  test_err("#&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Failed test ($0 at line ".line_num(+1).")");</pre></tt>

<p>

Of course, I got really bored of this real quick for the standard test

message above that occurs on every test that fails and I added a quick

method that means I can just do 

<p>

<tt><pre>  test_fail(+1);</pre></tt>

<p>

For those simple cases.  Other debug information has to be output in

the form

<p>

<tt><pre>   test_err("#&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You forgot to change your socks");</pre></tt>

<p>

Which was also tiring, so I added another convinience method to do this

<p>

<tt><pre>   test_diag("You forgot to change your socks");</pre></tt>

<p>

Instead, which is a lot simplier.  So now I have a lot more convinent

module to write tests with.  Yay!

<p>

The main problem with testing tests is the quality of the debug information

that you get out of a module when the test fails.  Because you're quoting

the diagnostic text that you expected and what diagnostic text you actually

got back from the test you were testing in the diagnostic text that you're

outputting, it's really hard to tell what diagnostic text is what.

<p>

I played with many potential solutions, but in the end I decided to

take advantage of the <a href="http://search.cpan.org/doc/RRA/ANSIColor-1.04/ANSIColor.pm">Term::ANSIColor</a> module to add colour to my diagnostics

if you want them.  So now the code can (if you enable it) print out the

matching diagnostic text in green and differing diagnostic text in red.

This is a lot clearer and makes the whole process a lot quicker.

<p>

But man, was that hard to test.  I have tests that check the tests

that test Test::Builder's test function's output (which in turn is a

module that I'm using to write tests to test the output of Test::GD's

tests, which in turn again will hopefully used to write tests that

test another of my pet projects GD::TextImage.)  Let's just say by the

end of the process I was very confused - but at least I got an "All

tests successful."...

<p>

This is all available from: <a href="http://2shortplanks.com/temp/tbt/">http://2shortplanks.com/temp/tbt/</a>- please download it and have a play.

<p>

Anyway...

<p>

<a href="http://use.perl.org/user/blech/">blech</a> has a concept of brain farts.  This - for want of a better description

- is an idea that you come up with that might be cool, but you never know

if you're going to implement it or not.  It's just "at the conceptual stage"

<p>

I was thinking about GD::Test and the is() function.  This enables you

to check that pixels are of the correct colour or not.  I got to thinking

what if you want to check if a pixel is yellow <em>or</em> blue.  There's

currently no way of doing that.  If I was doing a test on a string using

Test::More I'd use like() and a regular expression for both options.  Hmm.

<p>

Regular expressions for images.

<p>

Now there's a concept.  I'm not sure how these would exactly work.  You

could have them function left to right, row by row.  This would make them

analogous to regexes for strings.  Or you could allow them to move to any

adjacent pixel.  This would make them more like xpath, where you can

move in many directions (and even more NFA than DFA.)

<p>

The implementation aspect boggles the mind.  Could I map an image to a

string and use the normal regex engine?  Would I want to?

<p>

That's the good thing about brainfarts....I don't have to worry about that

just yet ;-)</p>

Hahaha... if the regex allowed moving to any adjacent pixel, you could write a regex to solve a black-and-white maze image<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)<br> <br><br/><br/>So going from the red starting pixel, to the green ending pixel travelling only on the white paths:<br> <br>
<code>print "yay" if ($image =~<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/\N{red}\N{white}*\N{green}/);</code> <br> <br><br/><br/>That would totally rule! I don't think mapping an image to a string would quite be feasible if you allowed adjacent pixels though... unless the string was lazily generated or something... wow - crazy thought!<br> <br><nobr> <wbr></nobr>.g

The idea of being able to move to any adjacent pixel reminds me of Befunge.  Don't go there!
