<p>So, about thirty seconds after I posted about not being able to get GD
to work I saw that <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/muttley/">muttley</a>
had managed to get it to render true type fonts fine.  The problem in
the end turned out to be that the makefile needed yet more tweaking to
find stuff.  To be honest, it suddenly just started working.  We're
not sure what actually did it.

<p>

Anyway, it's too late for a site redesign and I think we'll stick with
what we've got now.  Maybe next year ;-)

<p>

When I woke up on Thursday I found that my neck had in the middle of
the night decided that it was going to go into spasm which means that
I've been in pain and unable to sit at a desk properly for the end of
this week.  This, understandably, makes it hard to program.  Thanks
god for laptops and mail clients where I just need to hit "N"
repeatedly to cycle though my mail.

<p>

Finally not that I've not got enough mailing lists to read already but
I've just subscribed to the <a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/inline%40perl.org/">Inline mailing list</a> as well (Mail::ListDetector++).  I'm attempting to get Inline::Template
working still, but I've hit a few snags.  Maybe the clever people on
there will be able to help me.
