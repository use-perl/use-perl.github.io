<p>Gah, technology hates me.
<p>
So not only did my laptop hard drive completely and irrevocably trash
itself on the plane on the way back from YAPC::Europe, somebody stole
my lucent gold card, CLIE and memory stick reader, but my work PC seems
to have started to eating NICs and spitting them out broken.  This
doesn't happen to anyone else in the company you understand - I think
I'm cursed.  Hardware hates me: It's official.
<p>
But of course, it's not just hardware.  Since I've been sans laptop
this last week, at home mostly I've been using tigger.  Tigger is
<a href="http://use.perl.org/users.pl?nick=acme">acme's</a> second laptop that he's been kind enough to lend to <a href="http://use.perl.org/users.pl?nick=muttley">muttley</a> and
I for a bit, entrusting us not to completely trash it.  So all was
going fine until last night when instead of typing <tt>rm -r
/usr/lib/mozilla</tt> I accidentally typed <tt>rm -r /usr/lib</tt>.  Very messy.  acme
is a very understanding guy.  Oh, and as a side note the <a href="http://redhat.com/">Redhat</a>
install procedure is very nice these days isn't it. There's one for <a href="http://use.perl.org/users.pl?nick=pdcawley">pdcawley's</a> 12 step perl (well, it's not perl, but it's defiantly a bad
one.)
<p>
Of course, it's not just limited to bash.  I've been having real 
problems with <a href="http://poe.perl.org/">POE</a> recently, running on - you've guessed it - Windows.
I've been trying to get <a href="http://search.cpan.org/doc/RCAPUTO/POE-0.15/POE/Wheel/SocketFactory.pm">POE::Wheel::SocketFactory</a> to work, and while
it works fine on Linux (and Windows 2000 apparently) it's just having
none of it on WinNT, giving the helpful 10022 error (which apparently
translates into the equally unhelpful Invalid Argument message.)  The
people on #poe have been very useful and understanding (I love the 
perl community) but as I know nada about Windows socket programming
I can't really work out what the problem is.  There's a <a href="http://archive.develooper.com/poe%40perl.org/msg00514.html">post</a> on the
poe mailing list about it if you're interested.
<p>
Sigh.
<p>
On a positive note, spurned on by my success in getting Wireless
working in the pub, I've invested in a larger aerial for the stuff
which means I may or may not get involved with the whole <a href="http://consume.net/">consume</a>
thing.  This all depends if my curse seems to lift in the near future
- otherwise I'm going to end up falling off of the roof, I know it.
