<p>So, I decided last night to have a complete reorg of my httpd.conf.  I broke each of the virtual hosts up into their own files, so I have /virtual/twoshortplanks.com/www/conf/httpd.conf for example, and then use the Include directive to bring them into the main file.  This means that all the stuff for each virtual host is truly under /virtual now and makes things like backing up a lot clearer.
<p>
However, I want to go a little further.  I'm fed up taking down and bringing up the main servers every time I want to change a config change (which is quite often when I'm playing around with AxKit for example.)  So I want to be able to run each virtual host standalone on a high port as well as run it as part of the main server.  To this end I've split the remaining main httpd.conf into a common.conf and all.conf.  And I've implemented a standalone.conf for each virtual host that uses the common.conf and starts the high-port server.
<p>
This is all fine and dandy, but what I want is an apachectl for each of these development servers.  Which leads me to a problem.  They're written in bash.  Has anyone got any idea how to referrer to a file relative to the bash script itself (i.e. what Perl's FindBin module does?.)  I really don't want to have to have a apachectl file that's hardcoded for each and every server.</p>

<h2>dirname</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Dom2/">Dom2</a> on 2004-08-10T10:00:09</h3>
It's more or less similiar to perl:<blockquote><div> <tt>mydir=`dirname $0`</tt> </div></blockquote> <p>Of course, this forks an external command, so you might prefer the builtin, but slightly uglier syntax</p><blockquote><div> <tt>mydir=${0%/*}</tt> </div></blockquote> <p>-Dom</p>

The problem with dirname is that (unlike FindBin) it doesn't give me an absolute path.  Which causes things later in the scipt to go very very wrong.

In that case, you need something like:<blockquote><div> <tt>dir=`dirname $0`<br>fulldir=`cd $dir &amp;&amp; pwd`</tt> </div></blockquote> <p>-Dom</p>

<h2>just replace it</h2>

apachectl is a tiny script.  I use a perl replacement that I stole from <a href="http://krang.sf.net/" title="sf.net">Krang</a sf.net>.
