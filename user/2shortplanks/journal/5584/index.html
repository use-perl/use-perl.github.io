<p>At about ten pm on December 31st last year, <a
href="http://use.perl.org/user/mstevens">mstevens</a> and I came to an
agreement.  We would get Java certification in the next six months, to
see what the hype is all about.  We'd been talking about it a lot on
list and it seemed like a good idea.  Of course then we consumed a lot to
drink, set off fireworks, congaed through the neighboring houses and
did all the other things one traditional does at new years.  And then
I forgot about it.

<p>

I love programming in Perl, but I'm not bigoted enough to think
that there might not be something I can learn from another language.
And I used to be a pretty good Java programmer - I've just got a bit
rusty of late.  So certification seems like a good idea all round.

<p>

So mstevens reminds me of this fact, six months and 11 days later
and actually was organised enough to give me a number to call in
order to get a voucher that I can use to book a test.  All I need
to do now is brush up on a bit of terminology and remember how to
deal with a strict typed language again ;-)

<p>

I'll be sure to let you know how it goes.

<p>Why can members of london.pm never understand a calendar?</p>
<p>It's only <i>five</i> months and 11 days<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

There's <b>ALWAYS</b> something you can learn from another language.  There's a lot to learn from Java on many levels (language adoption, marketing tactics, "enterprise grade" software development platforms and toolkits, etc.).  There's also a lot to learn from where the Java development team learned from: various versions of C and C++, Smalltalk, various LISPs, FORTH, and so on.  That's certainly the less practical direction to approach, but possibly more fruitful.
