<p>Had the London.pm social last night.  At the Star.  As usual we filled
the upstairs room we booked out completely.  I like the Star - it has
nice beer (not that that really mattered as I'm not drinking this month)
and in these cold months it actually has an open fire.  Excellent.

<p>

Managed to finally get to talk to davorg about the hundred and one
things that I needed to talk to him about.  Discussed the upcoming BCS
competition.  BCS run an annual programming competition.  For the
first time this year they're going to allow Perl as a language on a
trial basis, assuming that they can get the judges (of which Dave is a
potential.)  Simon Wardley and Fotango have been pushing hard this
year to make sure it happens and it looks like it's all going ahead
swimmingly.  I've just emailed the bod at BCS to see if there's
anything else we need to do.  I'll keep people posted.

<p>

There's this idea of a London Perl Workshop/Mini conference banding
around that we've got to get ourselves in gear and organise if we're
going to have one.  One day event, one and a half to two tracks, at
a yet undecided venue sometime around Easter.  Watch this space.

<p>

Dave's (and Andy's and Darren's) new <a
href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/perltt/">book</a> is out.  Dave
had a copy on him and it looks very good.  I of course displayed my
annoying habit of finding a minor technical glitch within three
minutes (I did the same with both the Perl Cookbook and the mod_perl
Developers Cookbook) and I don't think Dave will ever forgive me.  DHL
are shipping me my copy as I type, and as soon as my boss gets back on
Monday I need to bug him to buy a copy (or two) for work.  Oh, why is
it that DHL are happy to rearrange delivery via email or fax, but won't
do it over the phone?  All telecommunication bits are equal, but some
are more equal than others?

<p>

Speaking of the badger book, and talking, Joesette is trying to
organise a uk unix usergroup meeting where people from London.pm talk.
The current idea is to make it all about TT.  Watch this space again.

<p>

Lots of other things discussed with people.  I convinced muttley to be
the new Pub Minion (he incharge of sorting out pubs for social
meetings.)  Nick talked to me so much I now know more about the woes
of the latest releases of perl than I ever needed to know.  Talked
about new module ideas (I'll let the module authors write about
those).  Yacked about the fragility of various brands of laptops.
Wibbled on about nicotine patches and gums (oh, it'll be January
then.)  Ranguard asked me when we're losing the Esperanto from the
front page of London.pm (hmm, must work that out.)  Ate Sausages.

<p>

Lots of people talked to me about the tech meet, which I really need
to get round to sorting out today if I have a free half hour.  The
trouble is that I have the sneaking suspicion that I've lost a few
emails of people offering to talk.  Ooops.  I'll have to trawl though
my mail (with the awesome power of grep) before I commit myself to any
more speakers.

<p>

Right, on with the todo list.
