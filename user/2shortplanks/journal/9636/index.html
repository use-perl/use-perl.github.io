<p>Well, That's Christmas done and dusted.  More importantly, that's the
Advent Calendar done for this year.  Phew!  I tell you, I couldn't keep
that up for another day.  I'm totally exhausted of writing a tutorial a
day on such tight deadlines while trying to do Christmas socialising
at the same time.

<p>

So now what?  Very good question, one that I can't think of an answer
for.  Before you start all emailing me with the hundred and one things
that I could be doing I should point out that I've got more than
enough things to do, it's just deciding which I needed to do first.
One good thing about the Advent Calendar was that it was an overriding
concern - I couldn't do anything else while I was doing that.

<p>

I guess my number one priority now is getting everything organised for
the London.pm social and technical meets happening in January.  I've
got to chase speakers, check that we've got enough people speaking
but not too many (I think we've got four confirmed speakers, but I need
to check how long each is going to be.)  And I've got to confirm
venues for the social meeting on the 9th.  Pub minion, if you're reading
this have a think about it.

<p>

Oh, there's other London Open Source things happening in Jan too.  I
really should check them out.  

<p>

Aside from that I've got a few projects on the go that I should have a
think about.  I really should write some notes to go along with my
YAPC::Europe <a
href="http://2shortplanks.com/talks/yapce2002/>slides</a> from last
year.  I should also think about going though the Advent Calendar and
bundling it up into tarballs for those people who want local copies
(people asked.)  Oh, and possibly reformatting the articles for other
uses.  At the very least I should clean up the subversion repository
and unpassword read access so people can get at the raw POD.

<p>

Speaking of making improvements to the Advent Calendar I should also
start work on my nefarious scheme to convince people in London.pm to
help me write lightning articles.  These are (hopefully) the article
equivalent of lightning talks - basically like the shorter of the
Advent Calendar entities.  I shall probably talk this over with
people at the social meets.

<p>

Oh articles.  Since I've been writing stuff for myself so much I
should probably see if tpr/tpj/perl.com want me to write anything for
them.  I really should get round to completing some of the articles
I've got in the works and offering them.

<p>

Let's not forget modules.  Aside from fixing outstanding bugs (kudos
to matts for doing this on his modules today) I've got Test::Set
(fuzzy data set matching) to write for schwern, and I really want to
get Test::Template (a testing module for all templating systems) out
the door.  Not to mention a few modules I've had that do useful things
with GD, and the breadcrumb navigation systems for the Template
Toolkit.

<p>

Oh, the Template Toolkit.  Should really go over the documentation for
that a little in the near future.  Oh, and I said I'd try and do the
same for Pixie.

<p>

See!  Too much to do already.  I've got a plan.  Let me know which
would be most useful to you guys and I'll do that first.

<p>

I'm staying at the folks place for a few more days, so I'm still on
the modem so I'm not reading most of my mail (thank god for borrowing
richardc's airport though.)  And I left my mobile in London.  If you really
want to get hold of me, send me a mail with something interesting in
the subject line that I won't mistake for spam.
</p>

<h2>Bread crumbs</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/gizmo_mathboy/">gizmo_mathboy</a> on 2002-12-27T15:10:01</h3>
I really like the idea of a bread crumb module for TT.<br> <br>I'm currently reading the Mason book. I was reading the docs for TT as well and am still not convinced one way or the other. I like both systems. I guess I  just have to whip something up with both and see which I like better.
