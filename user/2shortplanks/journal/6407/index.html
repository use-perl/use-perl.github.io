<p>I got caught up in another side project again, this time working on
AxKit and the Template Toolkit.  <p> Now in AxKit you can place
numerous processing instructions at the top of the XML file that tells
it to run the file via several stylesheets in order.  Each of these
take the output from the previous layer and apply further
transformations to it.  It's a pipeline.  <p> These stylesheets can be
in various languages and how the stylesheet is interpreseted is
governed by a pseudo mime type attribute on each processing
instruction.  For example, on my system the "text/xsl" mime type is
tied via AxKit to the XML::LibXSLT module, causing that stylesheet to
be loaded and used as an XSLT 'script' to process the current working
document.  <p> This is where the Template Toolkit stuff comes in.
I've been working on adding it as another Language option, so you can
use the mime type "text/tt".  The document you're working on is then
passed into the stylesheet template in the stash.  <p> This has
created a lot of alpha level code, which I have linked to <a
href="http://www.template-toolkit.org/pipermail/template-axkit/2002-July/000010.html">here</a>
<p> People have been asking me why I'm doing this.  Several reasons,
but mainly because compatibility is good.  I don't think there's any
one tool for the job, and I think the largest number of tools that you
can convince to play nice with each other the better.  <p> Take AxKit
and Template Toolkit into the Shower?  Nope, I just code and go.</p>

  If I may suggest a slightly different mime-type which would be more standard conformant than text/tt: application/x-tt. I know it's longer but who types in these things anyway? I always copy from something else<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)

<p>
  That's a very cool project, keep us posted!

Sure...anyway it's not really up to the module author; You set this up in httpd.conf...<br>

  Yes I know, but the doc will dictate what people actually use<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) I know it's the smallest nitpick, but the reason I jumped on it is because "text/xsl" is very reminiscent of M$'s borched attempt to provide their own version of XSLT.
