<p>Busy week, Perl wise.

Thursday was the social, at the Star.  Good Beer (with service
upstairs and everything,) good food, and wireless.  The meeting was
really busy with people in town for the CPAN meeting that acme
organised.  Everywhere you turned another Pumpking.  Scary.

<p>

I wussed out on Friday night and stayed at home and installed
richardc's Timesink application, which is a web accessed RSS
aggregator.  I ended up patching it so a) it installs and b) it uses
HTTP::Cookies to store cookies while scraping (this means that I can
give it a cookie from my browser and it can now scrape friends only
livejournal posts.)

<p>

Saturday evening I ended up joining the 'beer track' of the CPAN
meeting at the Prince of Bonaparte in Notting Hill.  One of acme's
favourite pubs (even before it became his local) it was good, even if
they did run out of pride.  Truly excellent food; Getting a perfectly
cooked burger at five to nine on a busy Saturday night is a miracle.
Pub got busy, and last orders came, so some of us invaded acme's flat
until the wee hours in the morning.

<p>

On Thursday and Saturday there was a lot of discussion about a whole
host of Perl stuff, of which these are the highlights in no particular
order:

<ul>
<li>Autrijus showed me Module::Install which I was very impressed with.
Ingy had recommended it to me a YAPC::NA, but I hadn't had time to check
it out.  Having Autrijus walk me though some examples was really impressive.
I've got to rewrite my stub-module maker now.
<li>sky explained how progress on Parrot was going.  "Hopefully something
out by Christmas".  Apparently he means <i>this</i> Christmas too.
<li>James and I, and then Spurkis and I talked a lot about Pixie.  I think
I need to call up pdcawley and convince him to come out for Sushi so I
can pick his brains.  Spurkis thinks we need a mailing list, and I'm
inclined to agree.
<li>hfb briefly explained what everyone had been up to at the meeting
and mentioned a lot METADATA.  It's almost as if we're chasing dahuts.
Once again she made me sad that I had to miss her talk at YAPC::Europe.
</ul>
