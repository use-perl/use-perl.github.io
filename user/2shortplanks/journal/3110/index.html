<div class="span8">
<p>So, at lunch today a few of us from the #openframe channel decided to
meet up and have lunch to discuss Pipelining and All That.  Dim Sum
rocks my world.  Justin, if you're reading this, thanks for letting me
take a long lunch!

<p>

Anyway, between eating lots of stuff many aspects of pipelining were
discussed.  What's Pipeline.pm all about then?  What's the difference
between a segment (aka a slot) and a pipeline?  In our various models
how are we going to link them together?  How to we dispatch?  What is
the store and what can it hold?

<p>

<a href="http://use.perl.org/user/muttley/">muttley</a> talked about
Tanker.  <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/james/">james</a> talked about
<a href="http://openframe.fotango.com">openframe</a> and <a 
href="">Pipeline.pm</a>.  <a
href="http://use.perl.org/user/acme/">acme</a> complained about getting
old (happy birthday tomorrow acme) and <a
href="http://use.perl.org/user/blech/"> blech</a> demanded more
pastries</a>. 

<p>

<a href="http://use.perl.org/user/pdcawley/">pdcawley</a> talked about
problems with multiple entry points.  It turns out that in some
applications you simply <em>need</em> to enter in at a different point
in the pipeline, or you need some other form of mechanism that floats
around with the session (which is at a higher level than the current
store) and allows for dynamic dispatch.  This is needed for situations
where you have multiple communication channels (e.g. multiple web
servers, different irc channels, etc.)  I'm sure he'll write a better
journal entry discussing this.

<p>

Of particular interest to me is the complexity of a store in a pipeline
model (the store is the name for the "thing" that flows through your
pipeline from segment to segment, carrying the data with it.)  james
neatly sidesteps the issue by having an abstract store.  I, being an
awkward so and so actually want to know how this is going to work ;-)

<p>

The essential problem as I see it is that you should never throw data
away.  I always want to be able to access my data later on down the
pipeline.  This idea is simple, every time you do something you add
more data, not take data away.  In the standard -&gt;get() and
-&gt;set() store this means setting a new key for each item in the
pipeline.  Once your nice segment has done something to "foo" then it
shoves it in "bar".  OpenFrame apparently currently does this
kind of action by having one of each object type in the store, so that
when you move from an Apache::Request to your broken up request
(having extracted the data you want) you have it under another key.

<p>

The essential problem is this;  When I insert a segment into an existing
pipeline I want to do two things:

<ul> 
<li> Preserve the existing data so that should something later on
down the pipeline need it, it's accessible
<li> Transparently alter
data as it passes through so that later segments can use this
segment's data being naive of it's presence
</ul>

<p>

Of course, you can see that these ideas are mutually exclusive.  In
order to transparently replace data (so that you can later act on it
and are none the wiser that a segment in the middle has altered it)
you have to do just that - and then you can't access the original
data anymore, because you've replaced it!  Arrrgh.

<p>

My proposed solution to this was that whenever -&gt;set() is called
the module stores it under a key and the name of the segment that altered
it.  This way you can either request the generic version with just the
key (in which case you'll get the latest version back) or you can request
with the data stored under a key the named segment left.  Of course, this
isn't a perfect solution (if you do this too much you might want to
insert something transparently in the pipeline between those elements,
and now you need a third key to disambiguate the data, and so on and so
on.)  But it's a relatively simple solution that might be good enough.

<p>

Of course, if someone can come up with a better solution, let me know...

Is how do Pipeline/Tanker's differ from SAX pipelines/machines. I mean apart fromt the fact that James doesn't grok SAX pipelines<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

I'm only really interacting at the annoying question level atm (I am the thorn in other people's side's.)..I'm not that near the code, so you might want to ask muttley or james, but...
<p>
Tanker (from what I understand) is a wrapper framework that wraps around pipelines to add concurency to them and other framework support issues.  It's pretty much pipeline agnostic, so you (in theory, it's all 'in theory' code) wrap it round any pipeline - even existing SAX ones.
</p><p>
Pipeline.pm is just a simple pipeline concept that allows you to connect segments together.  The dispatch method is designed to be overloaded in order to implement different dispatch techniques (plain perl, POE, maybe even via SAX)
</p><p>
The current idea is to steal coding concepts from this that and the other.  The XML stuff is interesting.  You're probably right we don't fully grok SAX pipleines properly.  Got any good references?</p>

Kip Hampton's articles on XML.com are the best place to start. Just try and read them with an open mind, thinking all the time: "This stuff has applications outside of XML". Honest guv.<br> <br>Unfortunately it's hard to think about SAX pipelines while taking them out of the context of XML, but really they are highly generic, and a very interesting solution space for a wide class of problems.<br> <br>It's certainly fun to see people starting to really rave about Pipelining solutions, when this really was one of the major basis for AxKit all those years ago<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

Of course it was the basis for axkit all those years ago.  I still remember the talk you gave at London.pm.  Don't think people won't try and steal ideas from you too...
<p>
I'm sure you'll agree that it's probably not a good idea to shoehorn Axkit into being an IRC bot for example though<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)</p>

No, AxKit wouldn't make a good IRC bot, but AxKitNG would (the thing I've been calling AxKitB2B elsewhere).
