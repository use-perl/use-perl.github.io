<p>So on Wednesday I'm going to mailbox to move my server.  It's not
much of a move - in fact it's going one rack over to be placed
in robin's rack next door to it.
<p>
acme's going to come along to shove his new 1U box in the rack
too.  This is slightly cheaper than going with mailbox direct, but
more importantly gives us the advantage of our own private network
between our boxes - which means we can transfer data between our
boxes as fast as the network cards will transfer them - which is
really going to be useful for doing live backups.
<p>
Oh, and we get UPS as well.  Yey!  Boy, would that have been handy
with the brown outs during the time the advent calendar was running
on it.
<p>
Then I'm off to Birmingham for the evening to give talks at
Birmingham.pm's tech meet.  Busy busy busy.
