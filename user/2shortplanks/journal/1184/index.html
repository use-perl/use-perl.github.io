<p>...Queen.  Hey, you can't fit much in these subject lines can you
<p>
<i>Hey, I just worked out that I didn't post a journal entry on friday like I thought I had.  I'd written it, just not posted it.  D'oh.  Here we go:</i>
<p>
The heritics are dead.  Long live the heritics.
<p>
(If you have no idea what I'm talking about then let me explain that
last night was the first meeting of the new heretics, London.pm
members who think that meetings should be on the first Thursday of the
month.  The new heritics formed at <a href="http://www.yapc.org/Europe/2001">YAPC::Europe::2001</a>  after the old
heritics bought the right to hold the proper meetings on the day after
the first wednesday of the month during the dutch auction)
<p>
We met in the porterhouse, which was unbelivably packed, and I drank
lots of oyster (a stout) which was good.  <a href="http://use.perl.com/user/pdcawley/">pdcawley</a> talked a bit about
refactoring browsers, and how it feels to make slashdot.  <a href="http://use.perl.com/user/davorg/">davorg</a>
talked about the new <a href="http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2001/10/31/lighter.html">article</a> on perl.com that mentions
Symbol::Sub::Approx.  Then the three of us and <a href="http://use.perl.com/user/muttley">muttley</a> and space
discussed what we thought the best Buffy eppisode was (can't elborate
without leaving spoilers here)
<p>
<a href="http://use.perl.com/user/hitherto/">Hitherto</a> and <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/grexnix/">Grexnix</a> and I chatted about the problem of someone
turning off your mp3 server when you're streaming from it.  <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/blech">Blech</a> and
Jerakeen talked houses, which covered such areas as broadband
solutions (they're all bad, but I suspect the gareth will have some
opinions too.)  Robin and I chatted about CFT and the pros and the
cons of it (summary: it's an excellent thing if it's volentary and
you've got a young family to spend time with.)  <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/mstevens/">mstevens</a> is doing CFT
for a week (or 'holiday' as we like to call it) and was planning to
have a go a <a href="http://www.reallifecomics.com/d/20011106.html">GTA3</a> at some point.  <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/acme/">Acme</a> and I talked tests and about the
problems I've been having with CPAN.pm not being able to install
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?mode=module&query=Test%3A%3AHarness">Test::Harness</a>.
<p>
And then the live musak came on.  And it was loud.  There was much
shouting.  Hmm.
