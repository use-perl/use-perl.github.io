<p>London Perl Mongers had a tech meet at Morgan Stanley last night.
This is the coolest venue we've been in yet.  Not only did they
have a massive back projected screen, but every two seats had their
own LCD screen showing what was on the main screen.  How cool is
that?

<p>

Oh the Perl!  Yes, we did talk about that.  Andy kicked off with
his talk on Template::Sitemap, which is essentially how he created
a simple XML format that, with a shedload of convince, can be easily
accessed from within his website.  Looked good - I've implemented
similar things in the past, but never really abstracted it out from
the site I was working on or added the functionality that makes the
sitemap manageable.  I look forward to the CPAN release.

<p>

Andy was followed by Shevek explaining Acme::HaltingProblem (which
apparently has only one bug), and then jerakeen gave his talk on
Bot::BasicBot.  Bot::BasicBot was one of my modules that I gave up
ownership on because I didn't have time to implement all the features
that people were requesting.  Tom's done a lot of work, especially in
the boring mundane sections, like getting the damn thing to connect
to channel if it fails for any network reason.  I'd <i>never</i> have
had the patience to do that.

<p>

After the break Nik talked about use DateTime to compute sets and
intersections to work out a combination of outages on his network.
Many questions were asked.  Nik agreed that he'd post to the DateTime
list to talk about it, so I await that post.  He went on to talk about
Text::vFile::asData that looks interesting, and reminds me that I should
talk to richardc about applying some of the work they've been doing on
parsing/generating iCal feeds to doing more with the London.pm.ics feed.

<p>

Shevek talked about SRS, which is a scheme for rewriting email
addresses that are forwarded in order to verify that they came from
where you thought they did when they're forwarded.

<p>

Finally Simon talked about Maypole, which as far as I can gather is
toolkit for creating ways of rendering and editing databases, with
powerful default states.  Big applications in twenty lines of code.
Powerful combination of Template Toolkit and Class::DBI.  Looked
interesting.  I will wait the month he's going to spend (thanks to TPF
donations) documenting the code.

<p>

I really enjoyed this meet.  As I was saying to James, none of the talks
were "This is the best thing in the world ever" or "We've developed the
new framework that's going to make everything else obsolete".  They were
"there's this problem, and we wrote this/used this tool which was helpful
maybe you'll find it helpful or do something similar too".  I was impressed
greatly by the number of talks that talked about other approaches that
they'd tried and showed how they'd prototyped similar solutions in the
past.  Conference organisers take note: These are the kind of talks
we really liked.
