<p>I hate it when you've spent weeks tracking down a bug, and then (and
only then) do you realise how stupid you've been.
<p>
I've been using <a href="http://search.cpan.org/author/RBERJON/XML-SAX-Writer/Writer.pm">XML::SAX::Writer</a> to spit out some XML, and I couldn't
work out why the prefix wasn't getting written on the start element.
In the end I extracted out a small bit code and made a test case that
continued to fail.  The prefix and namespace are quite long and hence
were defined as constants at the top of the script.  Just before
I was about to mail the perl-xml list shouting BUG! BUG! I decided
I'd better shorten this prefix and uri to something a couple of
chars long so I can format the xml the writer spits out in 78 chars
easily.
<p>
And then it starts working.
<p>
Like a bolt of lightning I suddenly realise that the prefix was
starting with 'xml', which of course is reserved in the spec.  You
can't start tag names with xml.  Of course, I hadn't noticed it as I'd
been spending the whole time staring at the code that was creating the
tag which had constants like PREFIX and NAMESPACE rather than the actual
values.
