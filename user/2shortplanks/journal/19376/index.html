<p>So I haven't written in here in ages.  Maybe I should comment on YAPC::NA.
<p>
My <a href="http://2shortplanks.com/talks/yapcna2004/">talks</a> went okay.  People came up and asked sensible questions (which is great, as this means they've been paying attention.)  Other people came up and said that they really liked both the bundling for cpan stuff as there's nowhere this is really documented well in one place (to my knowledge - please correct me if I'm wrong) and the modules I selected from CPAN for my talk as there's so many modules on CPAN they couldn't find the wheat in the chaff.  It's always great to get feedback like that and is one of the reasons I love to talk.  Thanks for everyone's kind words.
<p>
I should really get round to emailing the few people that I didn't get to say thanks for their talk.  Geoff, if you're reading this both your <a href="http://www.modperlcookbook.org/user/geoff/slides/YAPC/2004/">talks</a> rocked.  Simon, though your <a href="http://simonf.com/flap/">talk</a> on AMF::Perl was plauged by technical problems, the software looks really promising.  Allison, nice keynote.  Perrin, I've learned about a couple of interesting <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/robm/Cache-FastMmap-1.06/FastMmap.pm">looking</a> <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/bradfitz/Cache-Memcached-1.13/Memcached.pm">modules</a> from you.  Andy, Bill - you already know that both talks you did rocked.  Ian, you've made me think about kwiki again.  Worry about people in tin foil hats.
<p>
I took some pictures of which I got iPhoto to create a cruddy <a href="http://2shortplanks.com/temp/yapcna2004pics.html">web page</a> for me.  See James and Alex soaked to the skin by several tons of falling Canadian water.  Marvel at us watching Euro 2004 on dodgy video feeds.  See Katrien being bored by Perl geeks.  Be amazed by the funky waffle maker.
<p>
One of the things from the Town Hall was an idea mentioned to write a guide to writing lightning talks.  When I get back from New York state, I'll have a go at doing this as London.pm is currently organising a <a href="http://london.pm.org/pipermail/london.pm-announce/2004-June/000097.html">Lightning   Talk only tech meet</a> next month.  Which, of couse I'm still looking for speakers from.  Instructions how to apply in that link.</p>

My talk 'Grokking the CPAN' in my CPAN dir, http://www.cpan.org/authors/id/H/HF/HFB/, covers a lot of this as does the CPAN FAQ to some smaller extent. You could have harped on the $VERSION problem a bit<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) Bundles and dists don't work as well when they aren't numbered or numbered poorly...which describes about half of CPAN. Maybe it's a documentation project...maybe it's something else.

I've just read your slides - they rock.  I really wish I could have seen you give it at YAPC::EU::2004 - but alas I was speaking against you in the other room<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-).
<p>
I think my talk needs expanding out into a fourty minute talk.  I got the whole thing covered in 19min and only had one minute for the bonus sections that were h2xs and ExtUtils::ModuleMaker.
</p><p>
I did explain $VERSION a bit more than the slides imply, but there wasn't time to harp on to the level one needs to.  There's actually a lot of other things I would have liked to stick in there if I had the time to.  Note the lack of explanation of META.yml or even the README for exmaple.  I'd also liked to have at least mentioned Andy Lester's Module::Starter.  And being the testing nut that I am I'd have liked to explain a lot more about how to run individual test (oh, and mention prove) and stuff.
</p><p>
I really should turn this into an article at somepoint.</p>

s/2004/3003/.  I haven't quite completed the design of the time machine yet (and as I haven't popped back from the future to tell me what I'm doing wrong, I suspect I never will)

<p>
Hey, I'm usually shocked and amazed when folks get the makedist right so I aimed a little lower...you don't have to put it all into one talk<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) I think EU::MM and h2xs both could get their own talk. Go easy on h2xs, too...for most people it's enough, it comes installed with perl and it gets you there. The 40% or so of distributions that still lack a simple description likely aren't needing the whizbang new tools until they master $VERSION and filling in the description. </p>
<p>
You're welcome to use what you like from my slides and, on the testing side of stuff, I really recommend Peter Scott's Perl Medic as it has a lot of terrific tidbits in there. I'm really sorry we aren't going to make YAPC::EU this year as we had to choose between it and a wedding....I had wanted to give a talk called the '7 deadly sins of CPAN', but maybe next year. If you use keynote, I can give you the originals as well.
</p>
