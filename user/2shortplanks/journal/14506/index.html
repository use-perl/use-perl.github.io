<p>I've been really busy lately.  Too busy to organise the London.pm
social meet, so kudos for Kake for sorting it all out so it happened
last night.  Hopefully, I'll have a little more free time now.

<p>

Not bad venue, the Green Man near Great Portland Street.  We
accidentally drunk them out of bitter, which was a little on the
upsetting side, but apart from that very nice.

<p>

This week was games week.  People played Go.  blech brought <a
href="http://www.wunderland.com/WTS/Kory/Games/Zendo/">Zendo</a> with
him[1].  The were other card games which I didn't understand.  mbm showed
people more Poi.  Much fun was had by all.

<p>

Whilst this was going on I also found a lot of time to talk about
Perl.  I discussed davorg's <a
href="http://use.perl.org/user/davorg/journal/14503">problem</a> about
registering plugins.  There's a lot of thought that needs to go into
this as there's quite a few nasty problems you can get in odd cases
(what if it's loaded from PAR?  What if you want a local plugin
installed alongside global ones?).  I also talked to acme about some
of the problems with cpan testers (how do I recind a result if I
submit a stupid failure?  What happens if I fix a failing distribution
by fixing another distribution it relies on?  In that case do I have
to upload a new module version just to get a 'clean sheet'?)

<p>

sphyg tried to explain what she does with perl, and how gene sequences
work (apparently sequencing is done by 'giving it to the technicians to
do'.)  Martin talked me though his work on making a linux boot floppy
that has every single network driver (including wireless cards), a dhcp
server, router, ssh server, shell and editor.  It was very very nifty.
Oh, and he got persuaded to give a tech talk at the next meet.  Which
reminds me.  Tech meet a week on thursday, email me if you want to
speakx

<p>Is this a first for a london.pm social? When did they run dry?</p>

Neat, thanks for the Zendo link, I have never heard of it before.

Sounds like a good use for a (new) Perl Poetry kit.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)
