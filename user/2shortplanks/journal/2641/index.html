<p><blockquote>I wish it was Sunday</blockquote>
<p>
Last night I had a flash of brillance in the bath, and
got out and started to hack.  And came up with this:
<p>
<a href="http://2shortplanks.com/temp/tbt/">http://2shortplanks.com/temp/tbt/</a>
<p>
It's a module for testing testsuites by simply declaring what you're expecting to come out, calling the tests, and then calling another routine to check that what you expected actually matched what you wanted.  This is great as it's a hell of a lot easier than the mess I'd managed to get myself in with Test::Catch. 
<p>
So now I've got the tests to pass for the thing that I will use to write the tests for the testsuite I'm developing that I will use to write the tests for the module I'm currently working on.  Phew!  More on that module and the testsuite in anohter journal entry
<p>
Of couse, I was feeling quite good about doing this last night.  And then I came into work.  <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/richardc/journal/2634">richardc</a> seems to have had one of those "it's all going wrong, oh no it's going okay again" type of mornings.  I've just had one of those "It's all going wrong" kind of days.  Though richardc's help was invalible last night, he hasn't had the battle that I've been having with CPAN.pm all morning which has nearly had me pulling my own hair out.
<p>
<tt>
cpan> install Template<br>
Running install for module Template<br>
<br>
  The module Template isn't available on CPAN.<br>
<br>
  Either the module has not yet been uploaded to CPAN, or it is<br>
  temporary unavailable. Please contact the author to find out<br>
  more about the status. Try 'i Template'.<br>
</tt>
<p>
Argh!  I've tried everything I can think of but I can't get it to install via cpan.  And yes...I am using the main mirror.  Of course I can still install it by hand, but as it's part of a giant "Install everything I ever need" script  this isn't really an option.
<p>
You win some you lose some I guess ;-)
