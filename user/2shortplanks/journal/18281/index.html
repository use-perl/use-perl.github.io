<p>So, I've been accepted to speak at YAPC::NA.
<p>
I've got two talks.  Firstly there's a new version of the advent
calendar talk, which I'm hoping has been accepted as a tutorial.
It's another year on, and we're now up to a hundred modules that
have been covered by the advent calendar.  So, instead of listing
all the modules I've picked this year, I'm going to pick my
favorites (the favorites of the favorites as it were) and
give a tutorial on using them.  The CPAN modules every user should
know about kinda thing.
<p>
This dovetails nicely with the twenty minute talk I'm giving as part
of a London.pm presentation to the UK Unix User Group on Perl.  I'm
meant to be covering CPAN, showing how cool it is, so I'll probably
use the same modules in that as in the tutorial - just without the
explaining how the modules work kinda way.
<p>
The second talk I've got accepted for YAPC::NA is about turning a Perl
module into a distribution.  It's a short talk that covers things like
writing a Makefile.PL, bundling the thing, writing simple tests, etc.
The kind of thing that all Perl Programmers need to know.  I suspect
most people at the conference will know this already, but for the
intermediate programmers there it should provide useful; More
importantly, I think it's a talk that needs writing so there's a
resource I can point people at whenever I talk about how Perl's
distributions work.
<p>
All this reminds me I need to sort out the next London.pm technical
meet, which looks atm like it could be clashing with the Austrian Perl
Workshop.  I shall have to give this some thought, and find out who,
it anyone is going and schedule things accordingly.</p>
