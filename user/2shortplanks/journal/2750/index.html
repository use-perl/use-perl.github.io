<p>I really should get work to make me go home and have at least three


baths a day.  The reason?  That's where I seem to do all my thinking.



<p>



This morning I was pondering next year's <a


href="http://2shortplanks.com/xmas/">advent calendar</a>.  Yes, I know


it's almost an entire year away, but actually it's only nine and a


half months away, and hey, this project kinda is my baby...  Anyway,


if you heard my talk at the London.pm tech meet (which I must get


round to uploading the slides, especially as <a


href="http://use.perl.org/user/acme/">acme</a> kindly rendered them to


PNGs for me) you'll know that I had a bit of a rush job last year.


And the year before that.  This year the plan is planning ahead.  Or


I'll probably end up rush it all at the end again anyway (only time


will tell which I do.)



<p>



One of the things that I was planning to add to the advent calendar


for 2002 is a comments section where people can post their opinions


and experiences on the module.  People seemed to like my summary of


the module quite a bit, but I'm thinking that why should I be the only


one to have my say?  Much better to make it freeform so everyone can


chime in.



<p>



Also this week I've been reading the <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/runblogslash/">ora slash book</a>.  Slash ... advent


calendar with comment system ... slash ... advent calendar with


commenting system ... Hello, McFly?  Just. Use. <a href="http://slashcode.com/">Slash</a>.



<p>



So, the idea is that I gut slash (sic) so that instead of showing the


list of stories on the front page, it simply shows the 5x5 grid of


doors that I've been using instead.  Then when you click on these


it takes you straight through to the story for that module.  Excellent.



<p>



Using slash will also give me some nice extras for free.  Firstly, I


needed a framework to more efficiently serve my content.  Slash uses


templates from my templating system of choice (the one I used for the


last two calendars, The Template Toolkit) directly out of a database.


Job done.  Secondly, I need to do some automated publishing this year


rather than running the scripts by hand when I get back from the pub.


Slash allows you to schedule stories to be published at a set time.


Job done. Thirdly, I need a mechanism so that people who don't like


using the web (yes, <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/richardc/">richardc</a>, I'm talking about you) can have the


calendar entries mailed directly to them.  Slash uses can set up headline


mailing.  Job Done.



<p>



Fourthly I was going to provide better links to the rest of the


community so that people that stumble onto the advent calendar know


where else to go.  With slash, I can take their RDF feeds and simply


stuff them in slashboxes.  Job done.  Fifthly I was going create some


form of XML RDF summary of the modules that I've picked sites and


infobots can get at the data and access it directly.  Slash does this


automatically.  Job done.  Sixthly (this is getting silly now) I was


planning to do some mad stuff to enable people to see what modules


were picked from their mobile phone (I've also been reading Martin's


<a href="http://safari.oreilly.com/main.asp?bookname=learnwml&mode=0">Mosquito Book</a>.)  Slash automatically creates a WML summary of the


stories too.  Job done.



<p>



...and I'm going to stop there.  I think I've convinced myself enough


to cope with the overhead of installing slash on my server.  Now I just


have to see if this is all possible.  I know some of the other members


of London.pm run slash on high volume sites.  Time to ask them about


what to do.
