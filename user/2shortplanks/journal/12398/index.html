<p>London.pm had a tech meet.  It was very good, though turnout was a bit
low for a London.pm tech meet.  State 51 a bit out the way?  Or
you had other things on?  Let me know people - I need feedback.

<p>

I started speaking giving my <a href="http://2shortplanks.com/talks/xmlfiltertt/">lightning talk</a> on XML::Filter::TT.  zool
did a fun talk on noderunning - getting GPS data while trying to find
wireless nodes - and marking it up in RDF and drawing SVG graphs and
everything.  acme did his half finished talk on little languages with
parrot that followed his usual pantomime style with lots of audience
participation.  Nick followed this with a lightning talk that had
props and people holding props and was very good (I won't describe it
too much to avoid spoiling it.)  Needless to say, I'm unsure about
my new found acting carrier as a Perl scalar.

<p>

After the break Pierre showed us pure Perl 3D work with a shiny shiny
spinning tk demo.  Finally richardc did a great talk on Siesta (a
mailing list manager in Perl) that included many Mexican and A-Team
jokes.  No, really.

<p>

Afterwards to the pub, where Evil Dave tried to convince me that CGIs
could work in gopher, richardc and acme and I batted around the idea
of modifications to Perl 1, james wibbled about insurance and what
happens when your fellow conference delegates spill coke in your
laptop, and mbm explained how he wasn't going to burn himself to death
when he eventually starts with fire poi.

<h2>Turnout</h2>

Maybe turnout was low because there was such a dearth of webby talks.  I consider this to be a Good Thing, and the fully-buzzword-compliant nature of the previous one is why I didn't bother going along. &lt;/troll&gt;
