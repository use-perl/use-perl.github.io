<p>Last night was the first London Perl Mongers social of the year.
Turnout was low, but it always is in January.  We were back in the <a
href="http://london.pm.org/meetings/locations/penderel.html">Penderal's
Oak</a> as <a
href="http://london.pm.org/meetings/locations/threecups.html">The
Three Tups</a> is closed for refurbishment.  I didn't realise how much
I'd miss us having our own room until we didn't have one.  Though we
clustered a group of tables together, it's just not the same.
<p>
Worse than that of course was the fact that I'm still not drinking
 - damn new years resolutions.  I'd forgotten how terrible soft
drinks that are available in pubs are.  I've been to the pub six times
since new year and I've been drinking pub lemonade (which is terrible
BTW - get some decent mixes,) cola and orange juice.  Why don't pubs
sell Dr Pepper or Iron-Bru?  Considering that they sell them for the
same as beer, but they don't have to pay the tax, you'd think they'd
be promoting them a lot more....
<p>
The talk was mainly about Perl (unusually ;-)) and what people had
done for Christmas.  We were all glad to have <a
href="http://use.perl.org/user/acme/">acme</a> back in one piece after his
adventures.  We're not sure about this new trend he's got for drinking
cocktails though.
<p>
<a href="http://use.perl.org/user/blech">blech</a> was broken in as new
leader.  He greeted the newcomers (after a little promoting) and even
gave away an <a href="http://www.ora.com">ORA book</a> for someone to review.  <a
href="http://www.imdb.com/Title?0112431">"That'll do pig, that'll
do."</a>
<p>
The most popular Topic was the upcoming conferences, especially next
year's <a href="http://www.yapc.org/Europe/">YAPC::Europe</a>.  Are we going to have a communal hotel?  Yes,
but we're waiting for some more advice from our German Perl Mongers
first.  Are you going to speak?  I probably don't want to this year
- I haven't been to one of these where I don't yet.  What was good about
last year, what we're looking forward to this year.  Ooooh, a Beer
Festival.
<p>
acme complained that there weren't enough new modules being released
in the <a
href="http://search.cpan.org/search?mode=module&query=Acme::">Acme::
namespace</a>.  We all tried to put our heads together to come up with
some good new idea.  In the end we've got a few that might be
contenders - I won't spoil them by mentioning them here.
<p>
We discussed tests for a bit.  General feelings that Schwern has 500
USD too much money still, and maybe we should do something about that.
Testing tests again.  Testing stuff on obscure systems.  This mutated
into some talk about scary C stuff.  Inline C.  Number
representations.
<p>
Other notable items of discussion included the new Foxton's site (well
done Ranguard - though it crashes Mozilla,) Kake still not having
posted her mulled wine recipe from Blech's New Years party, Walnut
Trees, Communting to Work and getting up Early, Boo.gone and Mobile
Phones (thWAP!)
<p>
Finally I tried to get some advice on hosting.  I've got a 1U box that
I want co-lo.  Anyone know a better (or similar) deal to <a
href="http://www.mailbox.net.uk/services/cohosted/fulham_noc.shtml">Mailbox's</a>
775 UKP per year for 256Kb/s fixed, let me know!

<p>
  Acme::Dahut came out as a #axkit joke, and contains more of these but it's true that it doesn't do much that's actually interesting (especially if you know nothing about <a href="http://robin.menilmontant.com/dahut.txt" title="menilmontant.com">dahuts</a menilmontant.com>).
</p>

<p>
  I would however welcome suggestions to make it more interesting, and thus help the namespace grow.
