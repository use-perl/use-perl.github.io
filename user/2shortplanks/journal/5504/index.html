<div class="span8">
<p>In a <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/Matts/journal/5245">recent journal
entry</a> <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/Matts/">matts</a> commented
about putting an item on mnt todo. I used to have a big pile of things
at the bottom of these journals of things that I needed to do.  My
list has grown beyond that - it's turned into a bit of a
mountain. Well today I've decided to take it easy, after spending too
much time running around doing things too much recently.  Today I've just been
reading though the ORA <a
href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/exim/">Exim book</a>, and of
course watching the Football.  Much more relaxing...

<p>

Remember when <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/gnat/">gnat</a> <a
href="http://use.perl.org/user/gnat/journal/4779">asked</a> for tech
reviewers for Perl Graphics Programming?  Well, I agreed to.  It
was great fun doing it but it sure did take a lot of my time - and
I only managed to review about half the book.  I've never done
a tech review before, and I'm not sure if I wrote too many comments
or too few.

<p>

I owe <a href="http://www.diversebooks.com/">diverse books</a> a couple
of reviews, most notably a review of the various Jabber books out there.
I've also got a review of lcastro's book which is 98% complete and
just needs me to go over it and tidy it up a bit.  I'm really worried
about this one as I don't want to be misunderstood about what I want
to say.

<p>

I'm also working on writing documentation for Test::Builder::Tester
(more on that in another journal entry) and I've started to think
about the Test::Set module I proposed a few months back on perlqa.

<p>

There's numerous side projects on the go - a simple tool for
extracting and processing images in Gtk, a countdown module (that
shows just two - or 'n' - units of accuracy - eg "3 days, 4 hours
remaining" - "2 hours, 1 minute remaining") and my script to render my
CV from XML into as many formats as I can think of (HTML, text, PDF,
MSWord, JPG, WML...)

<p>

Oh, and I have numerous other non Perl related projects I need to
get started on - in particular coming up with a website for
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/gravel/">gravel</a>.

<p>

It's all go go go.
