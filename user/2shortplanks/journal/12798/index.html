<p>So I didn't get time to pack last night, and tonight's packing
for YAPC::NA was a little frantic.  It was about nine when
richardc arrived to help me look for my spare battery for my
mac.  Ironically, it wasn't down the side of the sofa as the
London.pm group claim for all kinds of lost items (keys, phones,
working Perl 6 compilers), but down the side of the bed between
it and the linen box.  Too many late night hacking sessions
I think.

<p>

Had a panic moment when I realised no tickets had arrived when I
was talking on the phone to acme.  Took me a couple of seconds to
work out we're flying on etickets, so we just need printouts.
Bad acme!  Don't do that!

<p>

There's just too many things I need to get now.  Both my laptop
and mobile phone needs either a mercan figure of eight cable or
a UK to mercan power adaptor.  I need more socks (I'll go shopping
before the wedding tomorrow.)  I have no sunglasses, but I suspect
they'll be cheaper out there anyway.  Oh, I can't find my cufflinks
for tomorrow - but you never can when you need to, can you?

<p>

Oh, I should probably write my slides sometime, but I'm just too damn
tired now (and I have a pint of Fuller's Summer Ale sitting infront of
me - I'm sitting in Padington station waiting for my train - which
isn't going to be conducive to doing some work.)

<p>

Hmm.  I'm bound to have forgotten something (passport...check, eticket
check...gift for bride and groom, check...)

<p>

Gah, this is going to drive me mad.

<h2>Assume you have forgotten something &amp;amp; don't wo</h2>

<p>I always assume I have forgotten something, and I don't worry about it, as there is usually something you can or nothing you can do about it.</p>

<p>To date we have left home without Eurostar tickets once, and airline tickets on another occasion. In both cases we <strong>had</strong> to go back to get the tickets. On other trips I forgot my hat, and DEET, in both cases we obtained them locally.</p>

<p>Enjoy your trip!</p>
