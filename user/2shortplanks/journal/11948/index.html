<p>I'm one of the main mailing list admins for the London.pm mailing
list.  Whenever someone emails to the list that's not subscribed the
mail ends up in a queue of mails that must be approved by an admin
using a web form.  Every time a mail enters this queue I get the
subject and who sent it emailed to me, but not the whole message.

<p>

This queue gets about five or six spam messages a day, so if I think
that a subject and sender looks like spam, I tend to ignore it until I
see a message that doesn't look like spam.  This normally isn't a
problem, but today I found a legitimate message that'd been in the
queue for over a day because the user that sent it was using a hotmail
account and I'd been ignoring it. Ooops.

<p>

This raises a nasty question: Has spam turned me into a domain bigot?
Get your own domain name or I'll discriminate against you - you'll have
a much longer wait for a posting.  Scary thoughts.

<p>

In completely unassociated news, I've been playing around a lot with
CGI::Untaint (and Class::DBI::FromCGI) and getting my head in a
complete mess.  There are some situations where I need the extraction
handlers to legitimately return undef.  The only way to tell this apart
from a extraction failure is to check the undocumented
<code>error</code> method in CGI::Untaint.

<p>

After much scratching of head, we now have a new release of
Test::CGI::Untaint that deals properly with undefs.

<p>

Head all confused.  Must go to pub now.</p>

<em>This raises a nasty question: Has spam turned me into a domain bigot? Get your own domain name or I'll discriminate against you - you'll have a much longer wait for a posting. Scary thoughts.</em> <br> <br>I am a domain bigot, but it is mostly very large providers, like AOL.com.  And most people who rely on such providers don't even care if you "discriminate" against them, and they don't know the difference anyway.
