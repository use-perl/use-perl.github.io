<p>Haven't been doing much recently.  Went into work today and picked up                                                                                                   
my x86 machine that has svn installed on it so I can make changes to                                                                                                    
my work svn repository again - petdance sent me a load of patches for                                                                                                   
Test::DatabaseRow I should look at integrating.

Announced the London.pm social meet and hinted at the tech meet.  I                                                                                                     
really need to sort out the speakers tomorrow.  I've got a bunch of                                                                                                     
emails off of people which I need to go though and check that they're                                                                                                   
okay to talk, and I might need to russle up another couple of speakers.

Been having a look at muttley's <a href="http://search.cpan.org/src/SIMONW/Module-Pluggable-1.00">Module::Pluggable</a>.  It looks nice, but                            
it really won't work with PAR, and I really really like PAR.  I think                                                                                                   
we could special case it.  This code (or something like it) should                                                                                                      
detect when we're dealing with a magic PAR reference is in @INC and                                                                                                     
deal with it.  It's a matter of changing the code that looks  in the directories in @INC

Note the large amount of ... still left to do.  Should probably write                                                                                                   
some tests first.

Of course, it'd be easier if PAR had a way of saying 'get me all files that look like this glob pattern'.  Hmm.  maybe should mention that on the PAR list.                                                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                        <p>
Think about such things tomorrow.
