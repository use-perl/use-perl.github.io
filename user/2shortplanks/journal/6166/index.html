<div class="span8">
<p>Last night the subscribers of <a
href="http://london.pm.org/mailman/listinfo/bots">bots@london.pm.org</a>
got together for a drink down the pub and a discussion about all the
things that we've talking about online.  The venue was the most
excellent <a
href="http://penderel.state51.co.uk/meetings/locations/henandchickens.html">Hen
and Chickens</a> pub, which was chosen for both it's excellent
wireless bandwidth, and its excellent location (being
very easy for some of us to get home afterwards ;-).)

<p>

Mainly I talked about the very <a
href="http://twoshortplanks.com/bots/basic/">basic bot framework</a>
that I'd been working on.  It's built on-top of POE::Component::IRC and
is very similar to <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/matts">matts's</a>
recently released <a
href="http://search.cpan.org/search?dist=POE-Component-IRC-Object">module</a>.
I'm determined to get my module to work transparently between IRC,
Jabber and from the console.  <a
href="http://use.perl.org/user/acme">acme</a> helped me look up
POE::Component::Jabber (which doesn't seem to be on CPAN yet)

<p>

<a href="http://use.perl.org/user/muttley">muttley</a> talked a bit about Tanker and POE and the various limitations
of the system.  I tried to convince <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/hitherto">hitherto</a> that I don't think you
need a true process based timesharing system and that cooperative
multi-threading a la POE is good enough.  Things will get interesting
when Perl 5.8 threads become more mainstay I should imagine.

<p>

I talked to acme and <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/blech">blech</a>
about various aspects of <a href="http://www.scribot.com">scribot</a>.
blech said that he thought the web front end been released too early.
I retorted that all the users are the beta testers and he should
lighten up somewhat (even if I do seem to find all the bugs myself ;-)
)

<p>

hex showed us some code he was working on to create a similar
bot that would work with a Wiki.  It looked interesting and I look
forward to seeing how he copes without a structured data structure
when it comes to churning - or if it'll even be a problem in the
freeformedness of the Wiki.

<p>

mbm talked about trust networks which are a tricky problem to
say the least.  I nodded my head - I'm not sure I'm up to
understanding them.

<p>

mattb and hitherto and I - sometime before closing time - started a
discussion about a basic out of band information exchange system that
bots could use to identify each other and their facilities on IRC.
The idea of this is that a) bots could avoid replying to other bots,
meaning you don't get a bot cascade and that b) bots could
ask each other for information.

<p>

The tricky bit is working out a way of communicating between bots that
won't seem intrusive to humans (I wouldn't like everything going
"excuse me, are you a bot" every twenty seconds.)  The best thing we
could come up with was a standard CTCP ping that could send a simple
response of "yes", "no" or "maybe" back.  "no" is obviously the
default (meaning no further out of band communication, and defintly no
direct communication ) "yes" would indicate you can try direct
communication (i.e. I'm a bot, I won't get annoyed and will stop you if
I don't understand you) or "maybe" (I'm an augmented human with a 
cool IRC client, send more out of band communication to see what
messages you can safely send directly that won't be just displayed
by the client as a normal message.)

<p>

So, that was it...apart from the post pub pizza eating (very hot,)
gin and tonic drinking and halo and rez playing.</p>

<h2>bots and autonomy</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/TeeJay/">TeeJay</a> on 2002-07-04T08:25:18</h3>
I have been thinking about trust (or rather authoritiveness) and bots communicating with each other.<br> <br>I like the idea of bots operating in a similar manner to DNS - i.e. they can find an authoritive bot on a certain subject either by lookup requests or by embedding metadata in factoids.<br> <br>I plan to integrate bots and other information sources into my personal search engine.. allowing you to use bots as a peer that can rate sites as we ll as googles technique of link counting. (this goes with the authoritive-ness idea so that for example a bot on the #axkit channel will be authoritive on axkit, respected on xml and perl and can probably provide the names of authoritive bots on xml and perl.)<br> <br>As for out of band communications - bots can always run whois against a user, and publish that they are a bot in their whois info. This would be out-of-band and transparent to most irc users.



<h2>churning</h2>

It must have because I was drinking (or maybe because I don't know all that much yet (or both)), but what does "churning" mean in this context?

Oh it's a pharse that's quite common in scribot like bots, but parlance that #london.pm doesn't use (as we don't have any such concept.)  Basically the process of taking a chunk of URL exposure and publishing it and arciving the previous stuff.
<p>
For example: <a href="http://www.axkit.org/irclog.xml" title="axkit.org">The axkit daily churn.</a axkit.org></p>

Oh, right! OK. I admit that I have no idea how to deal with archiving at the moment, but I'm sure I'll get around to it soon enough, because I'll have to....
