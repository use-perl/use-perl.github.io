<p>Two pints of water, plus one in the middle of the night seem to have
done the job.  Tea is helping too.  Praise be for tea.

The meeting was back at the Calthrope Arms, which used to be a bit
of a regular for us.  They've fixed the toilets so we returned.  The
turn out started out quite low, but we got up to about twenty five to
thirty people in the end.  Quite a few of the old school regulars weren't
at the pub - I'm not sure if that because quite a few of them don't
like being so far from the river, or if the fact that there was a heretics
meeting earlier in the month helped deplete numbers from the main meetings.
Please let me know guys so I can work out what we're up to in the future.


<p>

The XML peeps from XML Europe turned up and made me realise how little
I know about Axkit.  Must try harder.  Talked though the way that
Language providers work.  Hmm, must get myself in gear and actually
get round to doing some TT/Axkit integration.  Showed hitherto the
XML::Filter::TT stuff I've been up to - he liked it.  I talked to
Marcus who's just starting out with Perl and recommended stuff to him.
Sounds like he's got an interesting learning curve ahead of him.
Confirmed with Nick that he's going to talk about Copy-on-write at the
tech meet.  Sounds like fun.  Also discussed swiss money - is it me or
has half of London.pm and friends been to Geneva or is going to Geneva
in a space of about three months?

<p>

I convinced acme to sort out hotels for YAPC::NA.  And I remembered to
remind him today after the pub (we have a long standing rule that no
important information can be imparted down the pub and must be
confirmed the next day.)  Kitty et al had a discussion regarding the
horrors of spending any amount of time in a Co-Lo place.  Nasty.
Spoke to Reem about housing and things.  Caught up with mstevens who I
hadn't spoken to in ages, and waffled about Java for a bit.  And told
(well richardc) told new-short-hair muttley that we're covering Siesta
at the next tech meet.

<p>

And what else happened?  Well lots else, all of which I shall neglect
to summarise here.  It was lots of fun (as can be determined from
everyone else's blog/journals.)  The Star should be fun next month.

<p>Strangely there don't seem to be any use.perl journals that give any hint of events. Marna made a <a href="http://marna.org/comic.gif" title="marna.org">comic</a marna.org> which gives a rough summary. (no idea how permanent that URL is). The bottom line - we forgot to talk about perl</p>
