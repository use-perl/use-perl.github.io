<div class="span8">
<p>Hey! So I got a PAUSEID.  I'm now an official CPAN author, meaning my software now being mirrored worldwide!  How cool is that.

<p>

Better remember to spellcheck the documentation in the future then.

<p>

Oh that reminds me.  I wondering if anyone has a way to get emacs
(that can tell what's pod and not) to spellcheck just the non code pod
in a file.

<p>

Anyway, I uploaded <a
href="http://www.cpan.org/authors/id/M/MA/MARKF/Test-Builder-Tester-0.07.tar.gz">Test::Builder::Tester</a>.
This is exactly the same as the version on my <a
href="http://2shortplanks.com/temp/tbt/">website</a>.  There's a few
other modules I've got that I should get round to uploading, but I
haven't touched them in ages and I'd better check that they work
properly before I upload them...expect more later.

<p>

I've also been playing with the <a href="http://www.tt2.org/">Template
Toolkit</a> a bit recently.  I've been patching the XML plugins to
allow some better mapping of XML elements to VIEWS, in particular
making the recursion of rendering work as they should.  I've patched
the XML::XPath plugin and now I just need to do the same for the
XML::DOM plugin.  While I'm doing this I'm working on some
documentation to explain how you can use the Template Toolkit
to easily render out XML.  The Template Toolkit has it's own kooky
Template / POD hybrid system for documentation.  It's fun.

<p>

I also got a mad idea in my head about building a
Template::Plugin::Filter module that allows you to easily add filters
to the context from within a plugin.  I coded it, wrote the
documentation, made the tests.  Published it to the template list
to find out that <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/abw">abw</a> had already
written a module of the same name that did almost the same thing that
had been integrated into a previous developer release.  Arrrgh!  I'll
try and integrate the two to take the advantages of both.

<p>

Oh, and I've got to write slides for my talk "Building Testing Tools
with Test::Builder" for the London.pm technical meeting on Thursday.
Panic!

<p>
<i>
&gt; dipsy, my fun todo?<br>
&lt;dipsy&gt; trelane, your fun todo is install slash on intranet server, gtk
wrapper for sudo, Test::GD, GD::TextImage, Pod::POM Testing or add things to
grubstreet, read the jabber book or upload slides or patch T::P::XML::DOM,
write documentation for TT and XML, write talk (and make slides) or makepm script
</i>

<h2>Pod::Spell!</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/TorgoX/">TorgoX</a> on 2002-03-15T22:40:12</h3>
Pod::Spell!  Pod::Spell!  Pod::Spell!



<h2>Tutorial</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/chromatic/">chromatic</a> on 2002-03-16T04:00:19</h3>
I'm interested in seeing those slides.  (Since I assembled Test::Builder, I feel a little guilty about *not* writing something along those lines myself.)



<h2>DOM</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/darobin/">darobin</a> on 2002-03-16T16:15:11</h3>
<p>
  I don't know what TT2 does with XML::DOM in that plugin, but you might want to look at other DOM implementations instead. XML::DOM is aging, and is only a DOM1 implementation. It's also slow and memory intensive. XML::LibXML would probably be a better choice.
</p>

<p>
  Also, you might want to spellcheck those journal titles<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)
