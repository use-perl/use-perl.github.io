<p>So, there's been three London.pm meetings since I last wrote.  First,
there was the heretics meeting that took place at the Founders Arms.
That was nice: Sitting by the side of the river on the first day of
the year warm enough to do it.  I still can't believe the barman had to
ask "Are you serious" when I ordered twenty pints of special, a
waggledance and a pint of lemonade.  Maybe he had something against us
Lemonade drinkers.
<p>
The main social meeting this month was at the Windmill on the eve of
Good Friday, which meant it wasn't that busy.  It's a small venue
though so it filled up all the same.  I was plagued by a terrible
headache the whole day and ended up burbling to myself in the corner,
or so it seemed..  hitherto finally turned up and we wished him a
happy birthday in the traditional way(we bought him booze.)
<p>
Finally Abigale and his fiancee were in town, and unexpectedly so was
I (long story...short version: don't lose your passport) so a few of
us met up with them at the Windsor Castle (no, not that one, the pub in
Notting Hill) yesterday and ate the truly excellent sausages.
