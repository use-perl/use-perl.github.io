<div class="span8">
<p>So, london.pm technical meeting last night.  You can read about what
happened in <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/acme/journal/3718">acme's
journal entry</a>.  Fun fun fun.

<p>

I gave my <a
href="http://twoshortplanks.com/talks/testing">talk</a> on Building
Tests with <a
href="http://search.cpan.org/doc/MSCHWERN/Test-Simple-0.42/lib/Test/Builder.pm">Test::Builder</a>,
which also included some discussion of my <a href="
http://search.cpan.org/search?dist=Test-Builder-Tester">Test::Builder::Tester</a>
to test the testing tool you were creating.  It went okay, as well as
can be expected.  I think it was a little rushed, but it's quite a
complicated subject matter to cover in a short talk.  I think I should
write it up as an article and submit it to somewhere.

<p>

Everything that could go wrong before this talk did.  On Tuesday I was
upgrading my laptop with <a href="http://www.ximian.org">Ximian</a>,
which included upgrades for libc and all.  Which didn't work, and left
me without libc.  Which meant that non of my programs, like, say the
login prompt or anything from init at all, worked.  Thanks Ximian!

<p>

In the end I ended up booting into my Win98 partition and reading off
my home directory with <a
href="http://uranus.it.swin.edu.au/user/jn/linux/explore2fs.htm">Explore2fs</a>,
since my last backup was two days old.  This works quite well, but means
that I lost all my permissions for the files.  Darn.  (I sort of fixed this
later with a recursive Perl script that guessed what the permissions should
be depending on the path and filename.)

<p>

<a href="http://use.perl.org/user/blech/">blech</a> and <a
href="http://use.perl.org/user/hitherto/">hitherto</a> were kind enough to sit me down
with a net connection and talk me though bootstrapping a <a
href="http://www.debian.org">Debian</a> from the windows partition (I
have no internal floppy or CD drive, and you can't really boot from
the external USB ones.)  So by 3am the same day (well, the morning
after) I had a system that was apt-geted (or dselected) enough stuff
to be useful.  Some things need tweaking (for example, the wireless
networking needs frobbing some more) but basically with a few more
prompts from <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/richardc/">richardc</a> I
had <a href="http://www.mew.org/mgp/">MagicPoint</a> working properly
so I could work on my slides

<p>

This left me with having to complete my slides the night before the
talk, which isn't ideal, but Tuesday night had been lost to the reinstall
gods.  Which would have been fine, if I hadn't got an email earlier that
day telling me of a <a href="http://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/Bug.html?id=379">bug</a>
in Test::Builder::Tester, caused by an incompatability with the latest
version of Test::Builder.  Ooops.  I'm now giving a talk on a module
that no longer works.

<p>

Of course the bug would break some of the hardest to debug sections of
tests ever.  To test that Test::Builder::Tester produces the correct
error messages when the Test::Builder module that it is testing
produces incorrect error messages (i.e. so we get the right debug messages
showing that the test we were testing didn't produce the right debug
messages itself) we need to do some nasty stuff.  Basically we
reimplement a cut down version of Test::Builder::Tester in the tests
to test itself.  The trouble with the cut down version is that it doesn't
have all the nicities that Test::Builder::Tester has - in particular
no easy to debug colour highlight mode - so I end up staring
at two screens of text for half the evening looking for the one char
difference in the test output that is causing the tests to fail...

<p>

So that took up a lot of my evening.  On the other hand, when I got a
CPAN Testers message saying my module was broken the next day I was able
to email back straight away and say "please retest the next version" ;-)

<p>

<i>&lt;Trelane&gt; my fun todo?<br>
<i>&lt;dispy&gt;
i guess your fun todo is install slash on intranet server, gtk wrapper
for sudo, Test::GD, GD::TextImage,   add things to grubstreet, read the
jabber book or patch T::P::XML::DOM documentation, write
documentation for TT and XML, write an rsync backup scripts or  makepm script
or tidy up Test::GetSet and CPAN it
