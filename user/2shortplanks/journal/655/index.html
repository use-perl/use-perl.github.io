<p>So, what have I been up to this weekend?  Well, aside from lots of non-perl and perl monger related stuff (ask me about it on IRC) I have been mainly been roped into drinking by <a href="http://use.perl.org/users.pl?nick=blech">blech</a>.
<p>
Cunningly using <a href="http://use.perl.org/users.pl?nick=ingy">ingy</a> ariving back in the country as an excuse, on two hours notice we ended up having an impromptu gathering at <a href="http://london.pm.org/meetings/locations/theanchor.html">The Anchor</a>.  Beer was drunk.  <a href="http://www.blackstar.co.uk/zone/buffy">Buffy</a> was talked about.  We may have even discussed Perl 6 at some point.  I seem to remember ingy starting coding <a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?dist=Acme-YBFOD-0.10">something</a> during this.
<p>
Which leads us to yesterday.  Celia informed me that she and her partners in crime were working on a pet project to produce yet another online photo archive tool, and they were going to meet up and Would I Like To Come To The Pub Too.  So I did.  And I cunningly arranged it so it was the one next to my house so that I didn't have to walk very far...and the added bonus thing about the pub next to my house?
<p>
<em>The wireless networking from my house works in there.</em>
<p>
Wireless networking.  Pub.  Wireless networking.  Pub.  Need I say more?  So, ingy has now released (what we believe to be) the first module ever uploaded to CPAN from a London Pub.  Nutter.</p>
