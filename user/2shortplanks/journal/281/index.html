So I can't sleep. Guess this is a good as time as any to start with this
whole journal thing.
</p>

<p>
A couple of months back (well, okay, maybe a little more) I said that I'd
help out with an effort London.pm was making to get some semi-reasonable
perl cgi scripts written. We basically got fed up with fact that though
most of the scripts out there in public accessible achieves are badly
written, insecure, and were terrible. But it's all very well (and all very
easy) to complain about others' work when you can't suggest anything
better; We decided to do something a little more daring: Write our own
replacements.
</p>

<p>
These perl scripts are designed to be simple to upload and adapt for the
inexperienced user (I hate the term 'newbie'.) The kind of person that
doesn't know how to use CPAN. The kind of person who may only have a ftp
up to a server that they hear they've got this 'cgi thing' on. You get the
idea.
</p>

<p>
So, I've kinda ended up organising this whole affair...or not as the case
may be. In fact, I've been nothing short of useless over the last month.
The key problem is that I haven't been keeping people informed about what
I've been doing...hence the Journal.
</p>

<p>
Right, so my current plan revolves around the fact that I'll be taking
next week off of work, and that I'll have some time to hole myself up with
a laptop and get coding. My primary aim is to get the developer website up
and running in the barest form so that people can at least start having a
go. Hopefully after that I'll get a snowball effect or not. We'll have to
see.
</p>

<p>
In other perl related news I heard back from YAPC::Europe today about that
talk I'm doing with Richard Clamp has been accepted. As we get round to
writing that I guess I'll post details of that too. Again, we'll see.
</p>

<p>
Right, let's have another go at going to sleep again.
