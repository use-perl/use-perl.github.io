<p>So, my <a href="http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2004/07/30/lightningtalk.html">article</a> got published on Perl.com.  Huzzah.  It seems to have gone through some strange change from English English to American English enroute, but hey ho, I'm not picky.
<p>
I released a new version of Test::Builder::Tester.  Minor change to deal with the new Test::Builder that Schwern is going to release Real Soon Now.  If you use TBT, I recommend re-releasing your module with a dependancy on the new version so that if anyone installs the new Test::Harness their tests don't unexplainedly fail.
<p>
The <a href="http://www.axkitbook.org">AxKit Book</a> arrived at work yesterday and I've been pouring over it ever since.  It's really good, just thick enough to contain what I want to know without being too thick.  It's an irony for all the time I hang out on #axkit-dahut that I've never really used AxKit itself in anger (just all the XML tools it's made up of.)  Maybe that's time to change.  I'm only slightly upset that ORA seem to have let so many typographical errors slip into the book - there's some examples that contain fragments of XML that are obviously (after a bit of head scratching) meant to indicate things to the publisher (e.g. make this bit bold) and have no place whatsoever in the example that is being covered.  But hey, I can live with that.  I'll have to get my tippex out when the errata is published.
<p>
I've been playing more and more with <a href="http://camelbones.sourceforge.net/">CamelBones</a> and have had a go at developing some simple applications in this.  It helps that the local expert jerakeen sits across the desk from me and I can keep prodding him when I can't get something to work.  I'm really impressed that I could write one class in ObjectC and another in Perl and they all interoperate seamlessly - without me having to write a line of XS code!  This stuff rocks.
<p>
Oh, and in other good news we've finally got that little bit closer to organising YAPC::Europe from work - acme, richardc, jerakeen, Nicholas and I will be staying in the <a href="http://home.btconnect.com/Days-Hotel/">Days Hotel</a> with all of Birmingham.pm if you want to join us.</p>
