<p>This wouldn't be a proper journal if I didn't spend time whinging in it
how overly busy I am atm, rather than getting on with things that I
should be doing.  That said, if you're reading this, then don't give
me anything else to do, okay?

<p>

I fly out to YAPC::NA on Sunday, and I still need to tweak my slides.
I could do that there, but I'm not taking any computer with AxPoint
installed on it with me, so I'll not be able to.  I guess I could
install it on my Mac OS X laptop...but who has the time?

<p>

The IBM that has AxPoint installed on it's going back to IBM for
some screen repair (since I'm out of the country for a week it's
the only time I can realistically be without it.)  Of course this
means that I won't have it to generate slides.  It also means I
need to do a full backup before I send it away - anything important
is checked into subversion, but there's probably some critical
config file somewhere on this damn thing that I'll never find again.
This may take several hours.

<p>

Oh, and I'm tech reviewing a book.  This takes <i>forever</i>.  Many
many many many hours.  And it has to be done before Wednesday.

<p>

A Non-Perl event that's taking up some of the time is my brother's
wedding on Saturday.  I'm really looking forward to it, but it add
more complicated dependencies.  For example, I've got to take my suit
to the dry cleaners today if I don't want to get stressed out about it
being ready in time.  Maybe I should doing Gant charts and milestone
diagrams.  There's some other major stuff going on immediately after
YAPC::NA that I need to get sorted (which I won't bother you with in
my Perl journal) but let me just say I'd probably need a a2 sheet to
fit my chart on if I did one.

<p>

Aside from all this, I've got the usual problem of packing, working
out where my suitcase and suit carrier are.  And it's not like Sky
aren't showing the last ever episode of Buffy on Thursday evening, the
night before I go away.  Arrrgh!.
