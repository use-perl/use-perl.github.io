<div class="span8">
<p>On Monday we had an extra London.pm tech meet.  I say extra
as we weren't scheduled to have another tech meet until next month,
but as David Wheeler was in town and was offering to speak I
didn't want to pass up the opportunity.

<p>

I'd been meaning to get Mark Lester and Andy Wardley to speak for
ages.  Mark is the creator of Jake, Yahoo!'s internal templating
language, and as everyone who reads this journal knows, Andy wrote The
Template Toolkit.  Since David was speaking we had three experts on
templating systems, so I got the Fotango lot to convince Alex Monney
to make it four and did something we've never done at London Perl
Mongers: a panel discussion.

<p>

So after David did the same talk he's scheduled to present over an
hour and a half at YAPC::NA in 30min (way to go David), the panel
answered questions from the audience.  I was really pleased that
we got a collection of sensible questions, though I did love Dom's
"What's the worse way you've abused a templating system" as well.

<p>

And then we knocked off early and went to the pub.  Everyone seemed
to enjoy it, though acme complained that no-one threw any punches in
the panel even though they were using different templating system.
I guess he has a point...next month we'll have vi and emacs users
getting on.</p>

<h2>Templating Abuse</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Dom2/">Dom2</a> on 2003-04-17T12:58:37</h3>
I was thinking about that one afterwards and I came to the conclusion that the worst templating abuse I have seen was <a href="http://www.de.ioccc.org/winners.html#Tony_Finch" title="ioccc.org">fanf</a ioccc.org>'s <a href="http://www.de.ioccc.org/years.html#1998_fanf" title="ioccc.org">entry</a ioccc.org> in the IOCCC.  Ok, cpp is not a perl templating system, but <i>what-ever</i>!

Oooh, and I'd like to nominate sendmail's m4 macros as a close second.

And I'll nominate the EEEEEEEEEEEEEEVIL m4-based DNS producing thing at my previous employers.
