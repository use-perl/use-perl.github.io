<p>Last year when I got back from YAPC::E I found that my laptop hard
drive has died and gone to the big bit bucket in the sky.  Boy, was I
glad I backed up (side note: rdist-backup++.)  This year my laptop
screen has started to die.  It looks a bit like a analogue TV that's
just so slightly out of tune.  Oh and james spilt coke on my keyboard
so it's all sticky now.  Bad Monger.  Bad!  Am I fated each year for
this thing to die?

<p>

Laptops rock, as does wireless.  Apart from the obvious use of
heckling the speakers behind their back, I've found that they're
really good for looking up module documentation, previous
presentations and other things that you can do to research into what
people are talking about.  I have my mozilla set up to do "cpan
Foo::Bar" to search for the Foo::Bar module on search cpan....and with
the cool new documentation and view source options this is really
powerful.  Now if only I could see my screen properly.

<p>

Yesterday afternoon I was sitting in the POE talk (which was really
good) and it was really excellent to be able to go to the web
resources during the talk.  I haven't used POE in ages and I don't
remember their being such good documentation and examples...and now I
know.  Learning is good.  Oh, and Co-Kane has some really silly war
stories.  Ask him about it some time.

<p>

I've decided that lightening talks are good (or more accurately I've
had my previous opinion confirmed.)  I'm of the MTV generation and I
get bored quickly.  It doesn't happen so much in lightening talks as,
well, they're over before they've begun.  Lots of cool talks - We're
not building a f***ing house, lazy loading objects (oooh, coool!), web
spidering war stories, xs war stories, DNA searching, Mac computer
games (blame greg), etc, etc, etc.  I'm looking forward to the next
London.pm tech meet where we're all doing all lightening talks.

<p>

Some of the other talks I've been in have gone on way too long (but at
least that gives me a chance to play with Perl on the laptop doing
things that I've learned about.)  I think MJD's talk talk should be a
prerequisite for everyone that ever speaks at these things.

<p>

Other things I've been excited about: Perl 5.8 threads.  Threads are
something that I used to use a lot in Java (back in the day) and I
haven't really had a chance to play with them in Perl.  The shortened
talk (to give more time for lightening talks) was really good and just
showed how to use the syntax and a couple of pitfalls.  I like talks
that are essentially someone quickly talking though what something is.
You do this, you do this, and then you can do this.  Simple!

<p>

noidd and I got to see more of Munich last night.  After hanging
around in the bar under the hotel (where London.pm were ordering
rounds of twenty beers a go every ten minutes) we headed out and
looked for a restaurant to eat in.  This took forever as we kept
walking past italians, vietmanise, porterican, and the local
equivalent of the All Bar One.  Eventually we found a really nice
upmarket restaurant that served us great food.  I'll never be able
to find that place again.

<p>

I got back to the hotel and managed to walk by the bar (Greg and sphyg
gave us really bad looks though the window.)  I played with my slides
for a bit, but decided I liked the original version better.  And the
important thing...I got an early night.   So I feel really good this
morning (especially as I didn't eat breakfast - I don't normally eat
it and it makes me ill.)  Since my talk is last thing today I thought
I'd better not be semi-conscious the entire day.

<p>

Eeek...talk this afternoon.  At least no-one will come (the other two
talks I'm up against look really interesting.)  It seems like I've
been waiting forever to do this thing.  For three years now I've been
giving talks on the last day last thing.  And I've had enough.  So
next year I'm either going to give a tutorial or demand that I speak
on the first day when I submit.  Anyone think there'd be much interest
in a "learning the template toolkit" tutorial?
