<p><blockquote>
..everybody's having fun.<br>
Look to the future, Blech.<br>
It's only just begun.<br>
</blockquote>

<p>

It was <a href="http://2shortplanks.com/xmas/about13.html">(the night before )x11 Christmas</a>.  And the <a href="http://london.pm.org/">London Perl Mongers</a>
had gathered in <a href="http://london.pm.org/meetings/locations/threecups.html">the Three Cups</a>, for the annual Christmas "lets see what
we can drink the pub out of this year" competition (Chocolate Double
Stout it would seem.)  Oh, and something about announcing the results
of the election for our new leader.

<p>

<a href="http://use.perl.org/user/blech/">Blech</a> won.  Reopen nominations came in second.  The <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/amelia/">stuffed toy camel</a>
came in last.

<p>

Blech thanked everyone for voting, and the people who didn't vote, and
<a href="http://use.perl.org/user/davorg/">Davorg</a> for his great work up to date, and hoped he wouldn't break
anything in the next year.  He also threatened to go round and talk to
all the people that have been organising things and ask them if they'd
mind continuing to do that.  Dave The Goth pointed out that Davorg's
answer would probably be no....

<p>

I've taken a photo of Blech shortly after he was declared leader.  I
plan to take one a year later so we can count the extra gray hairs.

<p>

<a href="http://use.perl.org/user/muttley">Muttley</a> attempted to flog everyone in the room one (or five) of the
Lovely <a href="http://thegestalt.org/tshirts/">London.pm T-shirts</a>.  Boxes full of T-shirts turned out to be
quite heavy and Blech and <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/hitherto/">Hitherto</a> gave him a hand fetching them
from islington half way though the evening.

<p>

Lots of other stuff was talked about.  MBM told us that he'd had his
laptop, phone and palm stolen during a mugging.  We commiserated.
<a href="http://use.perl.org/user/acme/">Acme</a> talked about his testing of <a href="http://openframe.fotango.com/">Openframe</a> on multiple platforms, going
over what he'd recently discussed in his journal entry.  I talked about
the Template stuff I've been playing with (Inline::Template, 
Template::ModuleInstaller) and some of the testing suites I've been
trying to get to grips with and develop with (Test::Builder.)  

<p>

I got a few comments back on the <a href="http://2shortplanks.com/xmas/">Perl Advent Calendar</a>.  Barbie said
that he'd shown it to someone who was relatively new to perl and they'd
really liked it as it meant that they could get to grips with the
vastness of CPAN in one go and cut 'straight to the vital stuff.'  I'm
not sure how vital <a href="http://2shortplanks.com/xmas/about6.html">Acme::Pony</a> is but there you go.  <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/ricahrdc">Richardc</a> said that
I'd picked really boring modules.  There's several reasons for that
(they're only boring because you know about them already, I'm saving
the interesting ones for later on, the boring ones have universal
appeal) but I think he was just smarting because he hadn't had one
included yet.  Davorg also suggested on of his not-so-serious modules
for inclusion to lighten things up a little.

<p>

I talked to Davorg some more about Scalar::Approx::Sub, and the new
module String::KeyboardDistance that popped up on CPAN yesterday.
We're going to have to write a plugin.

<p>

It seems like everyone at the meeting was complaining about one of
two things (or even both sometimes)

<ul> 

<li>That they'd had one two many nights out already this Christmas and
they really just needed a night in with cocco and biccys and lots of
sleep.  The irony of discussing this while drinking at the pub did not
escape them.

<li>Their office was running a Secret Santa competition and they had
no idea what to get their randomly chosen colleague.

</ul>

<p>

A large number of other random topics were covered: Running mod_perl
on Zeus, Museums and CFT, CV technique and job interview questions,
using catfile (from File::Spec) to do system independent path
operations, burning beards, smb and firewalls, trips to wales,
installing broadband, cam.pm, interior decoration, handcuffing snarfs
and dragging them to meetings and finally What Are You Doing For
Christmas.

<p>

And as a final thought to leave you with - remember: Why did we do
that?  Because Blech told Dave to tell us to.
