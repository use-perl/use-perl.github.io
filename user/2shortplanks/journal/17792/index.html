<p>Darn, I broke my new year's resolution and didn't write in this as
often as I need to. I need a script to upload the text file to
use.perl.org.  There are a lots of modules on CPAN.  I should work out
which to use.
<p>
Yesterday acme, davorg and myself went to judge the BCS programming
competition.  We took our own team along who came a wonderful seventh
out of eight teams.  I would have been more disappointed but they
weren't that far behind the others (remember, I got to see everyone's
answers as they came in,) and they had a much smaller team than the
others (only two members compared to four to five.)  This put them at
a significant disadvantage as they couldn't have people thinking about
the other problems while they were working on one.
<p>
Next year I hope Perl will do a lot better;  With more notice so
that we can arrange a bigger team I think we could clear up.</p>

I think they were seventh out of nine.

No, remember one of the teams didn't turn up on the day due to illness (unfortunatly, that was the other Perl team that had registered) so there were only eight teams.

There were teas A - J (that's 10) and team D failed to turn up (so that's 9).

I stand corrected (well, I sit at my laptop corrected anyhow.)  So Perl did better than I thought.  Anyway, next year we're entering a bigger team.

So Perl is 7 of 9?  That seems appropriate.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

<h2>uploading to useperl</h2>

Maybe this is stating the obvious, but "WWW::UsePerl::Journal" is a darn nice solution.  You can write a one or two line script to upload journal entries with that.
