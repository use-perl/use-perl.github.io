<p>You know, there's nothing like saying "please fix" on IRC to me in a throwaway comment that makes one even less inclined to fix a problem.

<p>

I'm getting increasingly tired of this whole London.pm leadership thing.  Recently I've had the whole stress of people <i>continually</i> asking me about the London.pm page being turned into esperanto (because that's <i>obviosly</i> at the absolute head of my everyday priority list.)  Now the London.pm DNS is screwed.  I've left that in the hands of the sysadmin (who seems to know what he's doing) but that doesn't stop people coming after me.  Or rather, not, just complaining about it in general - maybe someone should do something about it?  Maybe someone is?  Maybe someone should email people offering to help.

<p>

I guess I could have communicated things better, but to be honest, I tried that with the Esperanto issue and people <i>still</i> bugged me about it every day.  I guess I don't feel there's any point in that kind of thing anymore.

I'm going to write Arnold Schwarzenegger to see if he wants the job.</p>

<h2>If I had a nickle</h2>

<p>for every whiner on IRC or in email who demanded to know why search.cpan was down for the past 4 years I'd be rich by now. Or the nearly incessant backbiting that makes my experience in a bitchy all girl's school pale by comparison. It's nice to see someone else truly understand the source of the bitterness in "No good deed shall go unpunished" in the perl community. It's far easier and far less of a hassle to just sit on your ass and keep a low profile since few are confrontational enough to peg those who don't do anything at all, instead only the ones who have too much to do already or find their interest in masochism is on the wane.</p>

<p>With regard to the DNS, email Ask as both of the DNS servers are in the develooper domain and I know he has been having problems with that DNS host in the past week or so, e.g. www.cpan.org pointed at a host in denmark for a few hours recently. No big deal, no drama, no corpses and no billions of lost revenue. Go drink a few beers instead of worrying about it<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>



<h2>Sorry</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/nicholas/">nicholas</a> on 2003-10-08T14:14:05</h3>
<p>As one of the people who was bugging you, please accept my apologies.</p>
<blockquote><div>I guess I don't feel there's any point in that kind of thing anymore.</div></blockquote>
<p>Please don't stop - you're doing an excellent job. We should all be better at saying thank you. Perhaps we should all mail <a href="http://lists.perl.org/showlist.cgi?name=perl-thanks" title="perl.org">perl-thanks</a perl.org> at least once a lifetime. Anyway, thanks for being leader and persisting in herding all the cats, however ungrateful we all are.</p>

<p>Oops. The list page doesn't give the address. It's:</p>
<p> <code>perl -le 'print join q{@}, map "perl$_", reverse @ARGV'<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.org -thanks</code> </p>
<p>
(now lets see the spam harvesters decode that one)</p>

<h2>You're doing a great job, you know.</h2>

But when's the next election, anyway?

When I was elected leader, I said I'd stand down in a year. Given how I felt when I stepped down (which is even more bitter than Mark feels now, I'd bet), it's a decision I was happy with.<br> <br>Mark, on the other hand, never did say he'd only serve for a given amount of time. Of course, like Dave Cross before both of us, he can stand down whenever he wants, and hand on power however he wants. (London.pm doesn't have (or need!) a constitution, so it's up to the current leader to do things however they want.)<br> <br>Mind you, I think Mark's doing a great job, and I hope he doesn't feel the need to hand over the reins. (I remember the <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/blech/journal/5428" title="perl.org">previous penderel downtimes</a perl.org>. Don't let the bastards grind you down.)
