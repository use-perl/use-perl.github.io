<p>Well, we've had an entire day of YAPC now.  Let's see what we got up to.

<p>

Wednesday morning I saw the talk on Mail::Box.  Interesting.  One of the
things I've decided I like are modules that just do the right thing in
most situations.  No massive interface.  No jumping though hoops.
One of the examples of Mail::Box was the coercion of Mail::Internet
messages and it's ilk into the right object type.  Lots of lazy work
going on behind the scenes (for example, using 'partial objects' that
can upgrade themselves if they need to do more work.)  You could force
the user to do this and worry about it...but the module handles it all
behind the scene.  Nice.

<p>

james' Pixie talk this morning mention that Pixie does this kind of
thing too - it pulls objects out of the ODBMS and stubs them with
proxy objects.  I don't like having to think about things.  I
sometimes get them wrong.  Modules that do the right thing are a Good
Thing...It means someone else did the thinking for me and codified it
into code.

<p>

The other thing I think I like really well are very intelligent
questions at the end of the talk that are answered really well without
excessive detail.  Not questions about the typos.  Not questions
about people that haven't understood what's been said.  Questions
about big problems.  For example, james didn't actually cover the
stubbing process - that came out of a question.  I really like
speakers that say "So the question was..." and rephrase the question
so it's clear how they're answering.  I don't like it when speakers
try and explain a complex thing.  I like it when they say "It's complex
and you could do something with foo...infact a quick example of that
was when we did..."  Describing code is a hard thing that should not
be attempted...especially when both of your native languages aren't
the one you're communicating in.

<p>

Schwern did a lot of good question answering yesterday afternoon in
his Testing talk, and the whole thing was very entertaining.  I was a
little disappointed with what was actually covered though.  To be
honest, the main problem was that most people hadn't seen (or read)
his Test::Tutorial talk that was essentially required reading.  So he
had to go over that a lot and the whole thing became disorganised.
Greg did do a wonderful impromptu presentation half way though the
talk though - excellent considering schwern had only told him at the
start that he expected him to present with slides.

<p>

In the evening I headed off to the speakers dinner that was much fun.
The place we went to was so much better than the pub we went to on
Tuesday night.  The food was good, the service was excellent, and I
could be convinced that this whole table service is a good idea after
all.  I was introduced to the system of the staff writing things down
on beer mats which you pay at the end of the evening, which seems a
lot better than the previous system of the server trying to remember
everything in their head.  I like people coming round and asking you
if you want a replacement beer when your glass is empty.  Well done
for Munich.pm for organising such a great night.

<p>

The trouble with staying in the hotel with the other London Perl
Mongers is that when you get back you can find them all drinking the
bar downstairs.  The other problem is that Greg will try and convince
you that everyone drinking brandy in his room is a good idea.  Do you
know how hard it is to buy painkillers in this country?

<p>

This morning I saw cwest's Template Toolkit talk.  It was very good
and I'm glad that he did it.  Now when I do my talk on Friday that
says "I'm not going to explain TT syntax" and anyone complains I'll
be able to say "well you should have gone and saw Casey's talk then."
Eeek.  Talking.  Should find some time to tweak the slides somewhen.
