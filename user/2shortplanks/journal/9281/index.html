<p>So, yesterday, as I pointed out on the Advent Calendar story, my
co-location place suffered a power cut.  This is just damn bad luck.  I
work myself ragged doing the advent calendar and just as it hits
the front page of use.perl, just as it's on the Yahoo! internal
mailing list, just as it's on countless blogs all over the place
it suffers a power cut.

<p>

What's the chances of that happening again.  Not much, right?
Wrong! Fulham has lost power again...only this time it doesn't
seem like my box has come up again at all.  Damn.

<p>

What I can believe is no-one told me for three hours.  C'est la vie.
Next time it happens guys, phone me okay? (No, emailing me would be a
<em>bad</em> idea.)

<p>

Luckily for me http://mirror.perladvent.org/ was set up (thanks
to Bob Walker, who has been working tirelessly with this.)  I've
switched the DNS and it should be serving all of the Advent Calendar
for a while until I can work out what's gone wrong.  If we've got a
dead box then I'm going to be really, really annoyed.

<p>

I'm learning the lesson of not committing stuff to the repository
often enough.  Most of the really useful bits of the code that creates
the calendar wasn't in subversion, so I couldn't create the 5th's
page.  I had to resort to using pod2html and lots of manual twiddling
of the output.  How humiliating.

<p>

Remember kids, commit.  Commit early.  Commit often.

<p>

Not to be unfair to Mailbox I should note it's not just them that are
having problems - a certain major north London hosting company not that
far from my house suffered a worse fate only a week ago.  This is all
worrying...can't people please keep the power running...where do we
think this is?  California?

I think your Perl advent calendar is great. Okay, got that out of the way<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br> <br>The next and previous links on today and yesterday's entries seem to be wrong - on the 5th it points back to the 2nd and forward to 4th, and the 4ths does not have an active next link.<br> <br>It has also been pointed out that the text-only version is missing the 5th from its list...

Gotcha
<p>
This is one of the problems with doing it by hand.  The box is back up and I'll regenreate the pages with the perl scripts, which means that everything will magically sort itself out.</p>
