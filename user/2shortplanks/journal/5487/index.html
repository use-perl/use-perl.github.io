<p>London.pm had another monthly meeting last night.  This time we
revisited the Anchor.  People had originally planned to sit outside in
the sunshine by the river, but we were thwarted by bad weather.
Turnout was low, maybe because everyone was still tired from the
weekend, maybe due to the lack of a room or the sudden change of pub.

<p>

Nick, Dumrats, richardc and myself chatted about building very slow
test-suites for perl, which migrated itself into a talk about
versioning control systems and avoiding conflicts.  "Check in often"
was the conclusion in the party - this is CVS as a collaboration tool
rather than just a code backup system.

<p>

Ivor pointed out where he used to work as blech confided in us that
he'd taken photos of most of the 42 cranes we could see about the
city.  Dragging him away from his obsession, blech talked a bit
about yapi (yet another photo indexer) which I agreed to have a look
at in a few weeks time when we both had more free time.

<p>

Ranguard talked about how he misses working in the city and not being
able to go out for dimsum all the time, and acme and I poured salt in
the wound by agreeing that we must go visit lots of nice restaurants
in the near future.  Both acme, myself and him agreed that we'd all
had good weekends, and that there should be more sun.

<p>

A congregation departed for the prearranged Groucho Grill meal
(which means steak, steak and more steak.)  I stayed in the pub, and
talked to Paul Makepeace about his time in the states, and why exactly
all his stuff had ended up in New Zealand.

<p>

At about 10pm the kindly barstewards kicked us out of the upstairs area
we'd congregated in and moved us downstairs.  This of course put us
closer to a bigger bar and the kitty was quickly exchanged for various
drinks.  These finished, and time called, we staggered home.
