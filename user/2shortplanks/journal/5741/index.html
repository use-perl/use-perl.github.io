<div class="span8">
<p>Ever since I got my copy of <a
href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/perlxml/">Perl &amp; XML</a> I've
been fiddling around with XML no end.

<p>

The fruits of all of this are two more new modules.  The first of
these is the pretty much completed one <a
href="http://www.twoshortplanks.com/temp/xsc/">XML::SAX::Convenience</a>
which is a simple Exporter module that provides quick and dirty routines
for quickly spitting out SAX2 events for starting, filling in, and ending
XML.

<p>

What do people think of this?  Is it too simple?  Is there something
better that does this kind of thing already?  Should I upload it to
CPAN (er, after I've spell checked the documentation anyway?)

<p>

The second one is - of course - a testing module.  This is tentatively
called <a
href="http://www.twoshortplanks.com/temp/txs/SAX.pm">Test::XML::SAX</a> and
is designed to test that a handler pipeline is spitting out the
expected events.  This hasn't got past the documentation stage - I
need to actually write the tests and the code - but please, first,
some feedback.

<p>

You know, I should probably join a Perl related XML mailing list
somewhere, but yeesh - more mailing lists, scary...
</p>


<hr/>



<h2>Perl XML Mailing List</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Dom2/">Dom2</a> on 2002-06-19T15:52:09</h3>
<p>The best place is probably the activestate one:

</p><p> <a href="http://listserv.activestate.com/mailman/listinfo/perl-xml" title="activestate.com">http://listserv.activestate.com/mailman/listinfo/perl-xml</a activestate.com>

</p><p>It's got most of the XML module authors on it and it's not too high volume (10-15 messages per day when busy).

</p><p>-Dom</p>



<h2>SAX Modules</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/darobin/">darobin</a> on 2002-06-19T16:09:54</h3>
<p>
  Your SAX helper is definitely useful, no doubt. In fact, that has been in plan for ages (I think you could find the details in the archives. Look for NodeFactory if you want, but it's mostly historical). The main reason it never saw the light of day is that we wanted it to be coordinated with the PerlDOM efforts, but that lost steam in the process. So yes, please do release it (and announce it).
</p>

<p>
  The only flaw I can see with it is that it doesn't look very namespace friendly. You can set a namespace mapping but that wouldn't be enough for a number of uses and doesn't seem to work for namespaced attributes (unless I misunderstood it, which is very much possible). I'm sure however that there are nice solutions for that.
</p>

<p>
  As for the test modules, it's also something that's needed. You might want to look at Devel::TraceSAX to see if it couldn't cooperate with it (that way one could test any part of a pipeline).
</p>

<p>
  Thanks for joining the crew, we definitely need new hands as there's always cool stuff to do<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;) Welcome!
</p>

<p>
  I have to second Dom in inviting you to join the perl-xml list. It's a really low traffic list, the level isn't always high but if you ask a question with any degree of complexity you're almost sure to get a good answer. You might want to drop by #axkit-dahut on rhizo as it's the informal place to discuss Perl and XML stuff (and Dahuts).
</p>



<h2>Right a Plan Then</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/2shortplanks/">2shortplanks</a> on 2002-06-19T17:11:31</h3>
<ul>
 <li>Perl and XML list subscribed to</li>
 <li>Move ahead with XML::SAX::Convenience
 <ul>
  <li>Rename element_wrap to element - it's just too long</li>
  <li>lose chars, it takes more space to type than doing the original
      by hand.</li>
  <li>Think about implmenting jclark notation for attributes rather
      than setting default namespaceuris, with the possibility of
      extended jclark notation "{NamespaceURI}prefix:localname" should
      we really want it</li>
  <li>Poke around in  XML::Generator::PerlData because that has lots
      of goodness that I can steal.</li>
 </ul></li>
</ul>
