<p>So I've been experimenting with Tony Bowden's excellent <a
href="http://search.cpan.org/author/TMTM/CGI-Untaint/lib/CGI/Untaint.pm">CGI::Untaint</a> module that can be used to automate the
process of extracting verified data from CGI requests.  This is making
our lives so much easier for us at work for some of stuff we're up to
at the moment.
 
<p>

One of the things you can do with this module is define your own
"local extraction handlers" which are tiny four line modules that know
how to extract data from a string for a particular type.  For example,
you can get ones for making sure the data is all digits, or ones for
getting valid urls.

<p>

Of course, writing new local extraction handlers involves writing
regular expressions.  And as anyone knows, it's quite hard to write a
complex regular expression and guarantee it's right - every once in a
while you make a stupid mistake, so you have to check your work.  The
only real way to avoid this is to test your data.  And that's where
the module comes in: It's a Test::Builder compatible testing tool that
can be used to test if the local extraction handler extracts the right
thing from a string or rejects the string outright.

<p>

This is <a href="http://www.profero.com/">Profero</a>'s first open
source module that we've <a
href="http://search.cpan.org/author/PROFERO/">uploaded</a> to to CPAN,
and I'm really happy that in addition to helping promote Perl we've
finally released something of our own.  Hopefully it'll be the first of
many.

<h2>How about tainting?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/petdance/">petdance</a> on 2003-02-05T14:11:32</h3>
I don't see the module up yet on search.cpan.org, but does it have a facility for tainting data for the sake of testing?  I've never had much happiness with either Taint module.

No, it doesn't - luckly I didn't have to deal with that.
<p>
Any data that is extracted by a local extraction handler <em>has</em> to have run though a regular expression and therefore <em>has</em> to be untainted (at least in the -T sense of the word.)</p>
