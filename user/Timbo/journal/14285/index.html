<div class="span8">
<p>One of my most prized possessions is an old IBM PS/2 style keyboard.  I know, they're a dime a dozen, and frankly if this <i>particular</i> keyboard was unavailable, I would move on quite nicely to another one.  If I had to do without <i>any</i> IBM keyboard, though, there would be a significant hole in my life.
<p>
First, there's the fact that all of the keycaps are moved around to the DVORAK scheme; not because I type in DVORAK, but because I once wanted to.  I type well enough that I never have to look at my keyboard anyway, so it doesn't bother me at all.  It keeps casual "can I borrow your workstation for a minute" trespassers away, though.  Sort of a keyboard encryption scheme.
<p>
Secondly, it is built to withstand nuclear war.  My gift for hyperbole notwithstanding, this keyboard is indestructible.  I have poured large cups of coffee on it, and done significantly more damage to myself than the keyboard.  On one occasion, a maintenance man used it to stand on in order to change out flourescent lights.  From it's general appearance, it was used during the Battle of the Bulge to help give armored vehicles additional traction.
<p>
It may not be translucent, or have the latest web keys, but at least it doesn't have a windows key.
<p>
Finally, it weighs a metric ton.  I can place it firmly on my lap (with only two assistants spotting me) and it won't move for the rest of the day.  Yes, my legs are numb within an hour, but I can type in that most comfortable of positions... reclined.
<p>
What's your favorite keyboard, and why?</p>

I recently wrote about why I love my keyboard <a href="http://cwinters.com/News/show/?news_id=995" title="cwinters.com">on my site</a cwinters.com> as well.

I probably should have given you credit; one of your journal entries inspired this.  I hadn't seen which type of keyboard it was, though.
<p>
I have been fortunate, as I have never had a hint of carpal tunnel syndrome or tendonitis, so haven't felt the need to jump to an ergo of any sort.  I should probably be &lt;buzzword&gt;proactive&lt;/buzzword&gt; and get used to one soon...</p>

<h2>The keyboard I'm looking for</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/yudel/">yudel</a> on 2003-08-24T15:08:00</h3>
is an old-style PC keyboard with the function keys
on the left side, as God intended.<br/><br/>I wonder how many billions of dollars of Carpal Tunnel damage and lost productivity was inflicted by Bill Gates' changing the keyboard to undermine WordPerfect?

Wow, I didn't know Bill Gates had that kind of power! It's a good thing he's not British or all the steering wheels in the US would be on the right<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

Mr. Gates is the most powerful human on the planet.  The only word that's uncertain in that sentence is "human".

Timbo, serving out a proprietary mixture of drivel and hyperbole since 1971.</p>

I will keep my eye open for one for you... sometimes the level of crufty hardware stashed in Alaskan back rooms is amazing.  I hope you don't mind an old one...
