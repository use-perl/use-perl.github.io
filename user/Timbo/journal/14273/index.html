<p>Remember <a href='http://use.perl.org/user/Timbo/journal/14226'>this</a>?  Probably not, as I wasn't exactly overwhelmed with responses.  Anyway, turns out you can create a perl (or anything else, for that matter) script to just loop infinitely and respawn <code>lpd -P printer &lt; fifo</code>.  It blocks while waiting for input on the pipe, so no processor utilization or resources are used.  At least that works under Linux... I still haven't gotten printing to a pipe from a Windows Parasite(TM) to work.  I think now it's related to Windows vs. Linux EOF character semantics.
<p>
I love difficult problems, but wish I had more time to devote to this one.</p>

It may be easier than you think...<br> <br>do a: "route print" at a command line and look at what Windows thinks your routing should be... then connect to your vpn and check again.<br> <br>I'd bet you still have a route to your local network... it just has a lower precedence.<br> <br>Your printing probably uses broadcasts to find the printer... which sends the packets over the VPN.<br> <br>You can solve this (usually) by setting up the printer as an LPD or direct IP printing type device. Then, it doesn't use a broadcast to resolve the printer name.<br> <br>I don't use Windows much... but I have solved this problem before using this technique.<br> <br>Hope it helps.

No joy.  I really appreciate the suggestion, but (and I just tested this to be sure) the companies I VPN into turn off local LAN access when connected with the VPN client (Cisco, in one case, Lucent "Contivity" in the other).
<p>
I wonder if I could just run a regex looking for Ctrl-Z (the DOS/Windows EOF marker) from the pipe.  </p><p>
Frustrating.</p>

That's a bummer... but, I wonder where in the stack they grab the packets...<br> <br>If you can print to a serial or parallel port... perhaps you could use a "net" command to map LPT1: to your network printer...<br> <br>I don't have a WinBox handy, but I think it would be something like this:<br> <br>net use lpt1: \\systemname\printsharename\<br> <br>Then you print to lpt1: and the OS sends it to the mapped printer.<br> <br>Thier coding may have been sloppy enough that this would fool the VPN software...<br> <br>I guess, worst case, I'd just print to a file on a Samba share... then toggle to Linux and dump the file straight to the printer...

Of course... if you could dump a file to a Samba share...<br> <br>Man, I can't believe I said that...<br> <br>Sorry.
