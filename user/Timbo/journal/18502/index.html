<div class="span8">
<p>Well, obviously my commitment to blogging waned significantly.  Maybe I'll be able to muster some more energy now that the Long Dark of winter has passed.
<br><br>
Sometimes I wonder if I have ADD or if I am just easily bored... I can concentrate my full attention on a subject that interests me for roughly two months, after which the rest of the entropy in my life overwhelms the object of my obsession.  Knowing this about myself, I should probably break each of my major life goals into two-month chunks, in hopes of actually finishing something before I have rigor mortis.
<br><br>
I just had an incredibly frustrating conversation (can you call it that when you aren't allowed to finish a single sentence?) with a Microsoft Professional Services zombie.  The gist of his position was that Open Source is destroying the national economy; interestingly, despite his claim of impending doom, he is confident Microsoft is not losing market share.  Oh, and he thinks Madonna is still a virgin that is saving herself for him. 
<br><br>
He made the following claims:
<li>Munich is still using Microsoft tools almost exclusively</li>
<li>Nearly all viruses targeting Microsoft systems are written by Open Source proponents with an agenda</li>
<li>Indian coders aren't capable of putting together a high quality product</li>
<li>Redhat's corporate earnings are attributable only to investment income (Anyone?)</li>
<li>Netcraft is biased, and most of the sites it reports as running Apache are unmaintained</li>
<li>Windows has a much better security track record than Linux</li>
<li>Germany, France, and Finland are subsidizing Open Source to hurt the US</li>
<li>Lots more that I couldn't hear because of my loud internal laughter</li>
<br><br>
I just pray that I sounded like the calm and reasonable one in that conversation; it was at the client site, and we were surrounded by management offices on nearly all sides.  Hopefully some of the more intelligent managers thought he protested too much.
