<p>Or, the unfolding story of my limitless cheapness.
<p>
I am without that part of my brain that tells me I am not capable of doing something.  For the most part, it serves me in good stead; rather than, say, paying someone to change my oil or fix my computer, I have traditionally just tackled it myself.  Today, I might just have learned that some things are better left to professionals.
<p>
In my journal, I have mentioned on more than one occasion that I'm building the MOAD (Mother of All Decks).  I have installed the MOAHT (Mother of All Hot Tubs) in a prime location in that deck.  Having had an anuerism shortly after birth, I thought I should be able to wire in the 50 amp, 240 volt branch circuit rather than shelling out the $250 for an electrician to do it properly.  This would have been the largest mistake in the history of the universe if <a href='http://www.nbc17.com/news/2412225/detail.html'>this guy</a> not taken that dubious award earlier this week.
<p>
Anyway, everything was going well with the spa for about a day; tonight, I came home to find "dcp" flashing on the display, and no heat in the spa.  It seems that I hadn't properly covered a second 120V feeder circuit (for deck lights, etc.), and for some reason known only to the Gods of entropy, had flipped on the breaker.  With the significant amount of rain we've had lately, it eventually tripped the switch and highly annoyed the spa.  It doesn't seem to have let the smoke out, and once everything was reset it seems to be working properly, but I'm now pretty sure it would be a good idea for someone who knows what the hell they are doing to check it out.  After all, my kids are going to be climbing into 400 gallons of water near that 50 Amps... I really don't want them to be filaments that light up the neighborhood for a few seconds.
<p>
Either that, or I could just take a look at it myself...</p>

Heh... nope.  I just lurk there, trying to skim useful tidbits from the flotsam.
