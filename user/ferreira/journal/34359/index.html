<p><p>
Back in the university days, I've read a few 
texts on
language acquisition and almost understood
some of the mechanisms used to learn a foreign
language. I enjoyed learning about learning.
A lot of reading helped me out with
English and a lot of practice allowed me
writing some comprehensible articles.

<p>
Nowadays, I am faced with the inverse phenomenon:
language de-acquisition. I never knew it existed.
But after years of non-practice, I don't have
any conversation skills in English and I just found out
that I am getting worse at writing too. Silly
me that thought that it was like riding a bike: 
never to be forgotten.

<p>
I diminished a lot on the diversity and volume of reading.
Today it takes me too long to write 
a few paragraphs. And when it is done, it does not 
make much sense and is riddled with mistakes.
It sadly reminds me of a joke we use to tell 
on a guy that went into 
USA, could not learn some English and came back
home... dumb. Disgusting.</p>

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_attrition" title="wikipedia.org">rose</a wikipedia.org>. There's an adage in English that rings true with regards to language: Use it or lose it. My French is now abysmal, and my Latin is getting worse by the day<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-(

<p>Experience tells me that&#8217;s wrong. You&#8217;ll have to practice to become fluent again, but you will continue to understand it indefinitely. You don&#8217;t ever have to <em>relearn</em> the language &#8211; you never <em>lose</em> it.</p>

<p><div class="quote">Experience tells me that&#8217;s wrong. You&#8217;ll have to practice to become fluent again, but you will continue to understand it indefinitely.</div> The original post was specifically mentioning losing production fluency in English, and I think that it is appropriate to use the word "loss" to describe this. My experience is probably the same as yours with regards to understanding language: I don't lose much, but I must admit I do lose some. But I wasn't referring to understanding a language, I was referring to the production aspect. Practicing to become fluent again seems to me to be synonymous with <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/relearn" title="reference.com">relearning</a reference.com>.
My understanding is that if you forget how to produce a language (in terms of muscular coordination or syntactic construction or something else), that's language loss and something that has to be relearned.

<p>You might have to relearn, but you won&#8217;t have to re-learn. The effort it takes to brush off the rust is orders of magnitude smaller than what it takes to initially learn the language. It might be appropriate to say you lose production fluency, however the ability remains latent and can very easily be reactivated &#8211; my experience is that you get 90% of your fluency back in about 10 days once you immerse yourself in the language fully.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s just not what I tend to think of as loss.</p>

<p>I responded specifically because I&#8217;ve heard fears about permanent loss expressed by many people who have moved to a locale where another language is spoken. When you haven&#8217;t made the experience of how easy it is to regain command of a language, it can seem like you&#8217;ll later have to relearn it from scratch or nearly so.</p>

<p>So the worry is unnecessary. That&#8217;s what I was saying.</p>

<p>(Regaining command of the <em>written</em> language is much harder &#8211; in particular, fluent proper spelling requires that you <em>read</em> a lot, and that takes quite a while longer.)</p>
