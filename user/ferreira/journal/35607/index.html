<p><p>
A few days ago I was bitten by the dual nature of <code>reverse</code>.
</p>

<pre>
$s = reverse 'xyz'; # 'zyx'
@a = reverse qw(a b c); # qw(c b a)
</pre>

<blockquote>
<p><em>
This is even worse because <code>reverse</code> in scalar
context may receive a LIST as argument and
concatenates the reverse string of each element.
</em></p>

<pre>
$s = reverse qw(abc mni xyz); # 'zyxinmcba'
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
There was a code where a method <code>history</code> was meant to return
an array and got used in a few places this way:
</p>

<pre>
$history_size = $o->history();
</pre>

<p>
which worked ok, until I found a subclass implementation
which had been coded like this:
</p>

<pre>
sub history {
    shift;
    return ( reverse @history );
}
</pre>

<p>
and the assumption that it should return
the (history) array size when called in 
scalar context failed miserably.
The solution was to document what it was
supposed to return in list and scalar contexts
and to change the implementation to:
</p>

<pre>
sub history {
    shift;
    return my @h = reverse @history;
}
</pre>

<p>
That's the kind of thing I remember when someone
says: "What's so wrong with Perl 5 that we
might need Perl 6?"
</p>

<p>
That's the kind of subtlety that caught you
by surprise occasionally, beginner or not.
Idiosyncracies like that put a burden at
the programmer which has not a perfect memory
(and I am one of such programmers unfortunately,
I have to admit)
and makes some feel that a Perl guru is needed
to detect, solve and explain such bits. 
This kind of weird behavior leads sometimes
to workarounds because there is no time
to think about what's wrong with that f...
piece of code. And then it distorts into ugly
things that contributes to the bad fame of
our favourite language.
</p>

<p>
Such ugly things go like a current joke 
on Portuguese ortography. 
A friend tells the other: "Write me a
check of 'sessenta' Brazilian Reais"
-- "How dow I spell 'sessenta'?" --
"Well, make two checks of thirty."
(Background: the word
"sessenta" (sixty) may raise doubts
to careless people about the right spelling:
"sesenta", "seÃÂ§enta", "sessenta".)
</p>

<p>
If Perl 6 fails to get rid of such subtleties
(and this is one of its design principles),
it will have failed to be the improvement
of the Perl language it was supposed to
be.
</p>

<h2>on a sidenote..</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Qiang/">Qiang</a> on 2008-02-07T18:45:58</h3>
i would name the function name as <code>history_size</code> instead of <code>history</code> to avoid confusion. but i agree what you have said.

<p>
Most of the time, the method is used to get the whole history as an array.
</p>
<p>
To give a more concrete background, I was working with the <code>GetHistory</code> method from <code>Term::ReadLine::Gnu</code>, <code>Term::ReadLine::Perl</code> and <code>Term::ReadLine::Zoid</code> when used by <code>Shell::Base</code>. That said, instead of trying to convince all involved authors to change code or/and documentation, I tried to work with the contrived and actual API.
</p>
<p>
I agree that introducing a <code>GetHistorySize</code> method would eliminate instantly the problem associated to the overloaded meaning of <code>GetHistory</code> at list and scalar contexts.

<h2>ugh!  use &quot;wantarray&quot;!</h2>

<p><blockquote> <div><code>

<p>
Ugh!  You really have two return values, so say so:
<code>
sub history {
    shift;
    return wantarray ? reverse @history : scalar @history;
}
</code>
This saves the extra work of reversing something that you don't need to reverse.</p>



<h2>sort too</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jplindstrom/">jplindstrom</a> on 2008-02-07T22:44:39</h3>
This goes for "sort" too.<br><br>I'd say that in application code 97.21% (plus/minus<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.03%) of all subs are <i>meant</i> to be context <i>in</i>sensitive.<br><br>So there really is a need for a Perl::Critic plugin that warns against "return CALL_TO_CONTEXT_AWARE_FUNCTION" where the context of the caller leaks into the sub and causes this severe action-at-a-distance.<br><br>(meta: five timeouts posting this)
