<p>I don't get what is happening at O'Reilly. But that's alright because I am too naÃÂ¯ve in practical affairs most of the time. They stopped publishing Perl 6 summaries - something which Piers Cawley publicized back in Oct 10.<br/><br/><blockquote>
-- <a href='http://dev.perl.org/perl6/list-summaries/2005/p6summary.2005-10-09.html#___top'>http://dev.perl.org/perl6/list-summaries/2005/p6summary.2005-10-09.html#___top</a></blockquote><br/><br/>Yesterday, Roberto Ierusalimschy (one of the Lua authors) said they canceled his contract for a new edition of Programming Lua and the publishing of many other books.<br/><br/><blockquote>

</blockquote><br/><br/>O'Reilly is shifting? Where to?</p>

<h2>Summaries are still alive</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/brian_d_foy/">brian_d_foy</a> on 2005-10-28T16:27:19</h3>
I imagine that the Perl 6 summaries aren't their best articles. It's not that they're poorly written, but that most people probably don't care about them. They have too much information and are too frequent for the layperson to pay attention to. People want to know the big news, and the summaries get them buried in minutia.<br><br>For those that care about them, it doesn't matter where they are published. One RSS feed is as good as another.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)



<h2>No Conspiracy But Practicality</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/chromatic/">chromatic</a> on 2005-10-28T17:16:23</h3>
<p>We publish a lot with a little.  As <code>brian</code> suggested, I couldn't justify the resources necessary to edit, produce, copyedit, and publish the summaries based on the amount of people who read them.  Thus I made the choice to stop publishing them to free up all of our time to work on other projects.</p>

<p>We'll continue to point to them on Perl.com (though the project to revise our Atom feed reader is still in progress, so it could be another week or two).</p>

<h2>What about the Lua news?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/offerk/">offerk</a> on 2005-10-30T07:18:27</h3>
<p>With the increasing popularity of <a href="http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/" title="worldofwarcraft.com">World of Warcraft</a worldofwarcraft.com> and the fact that the scripting language there is Lua, wouldn't this be a good time for Oreilly to publish a new Lua book? </p>I know I would find a book with a chapter about WoW scripting  very interesting<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

Well, as a warcraft widow, I might be glad such a book never sees the light of day.<br/><br/>But...maybe have the guy resubmit the title either as a 'hacks' book or couched in some Web 2.0 mumbo jumbo...that'll work.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
