<p><a href="~jesse">Jesse</a>
has announced <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/jesse/journal/34451">the acceptance of
my microgrant proposal</a>. It is a plain simple idea,
whose effects are yet to be seen. Comments
and feedback most welcome.

<p>
The plan is to write a series of 
blog entries discussing a Perl 6 operator
at a time or a small group of closely related ones.

<p>
My working hypotheses are:

<ul>
<li> the audience is broader than Perl 6 developers

<li> they should be educational

<li> they should be light 

<li> they should not be long

<li> they should show some nice Perl 6 code

<li> they should be based on what's specified

<li> if possible, they should be cool

</ul>

The goals:

<ul>
<li> make people know more about Perl 6

<li> allow them to do that in an entertaining fashion

<li> entice the curiosity

<li> estimulate the need for Perl 6

<li> spread the word

</ul>

<p>
The choice to approach Perl 6 via operators
was an artefact. Every single piece of
Perl 6 code would present a bunch
of features, hopefully good enough
to demonstrate the look and feel of the language.
And operators cross over the entire
realm of the language (even more than with Perl 5).
The pretention would be to compose a picture
of the language in small doses like 
<i>Marvin Minsky</i>
did in <i>Society of Mind</i> with every chapter in
a single page, striving to get a comprehensible
whole from the component pieces. It's kind of
prententious, but hubris is a quality around here
and I hope not to be alone in this endeavour.

<p>
Any help will be much appreciated: suggestions,
corrections, grammar and typo fixes,
rephrasing, etc. As drafts got ready,
I will announce them in Perl channels
(#perl6 at freenode, use.perl, PerlMonks,
perl6-language mailing list) to have a chance
to improve the articles to be published at
ONLamp site.

<p>
Join me. The drafts of the introduction and
the first article are here:
