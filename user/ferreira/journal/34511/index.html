<p><p>
This week has seen the publishing of the
three first micro-articles on Perl 6 
operators, following the plan of
<a href="http://use.perl.org/user/jesse/journal/34451">this grant proposal</a>.

<p>
The links are:

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/onlamp/blog/2007/09/yet_another_perl_6_operator_th_1.html">Introduction</a>
<li><a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/onlamp/blog/2007/09/yet_another_perl_6_operator_zi.html">The zip operator</a>
<li><a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/onlamp/blog/2007/09/yap6_operator_stitching.html">The ~ operator</a>
<li><a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/onlamp/blog/2007/09/yap6_operator_repeat_operators_1.html">Repeat operators</a>
</ul>

<p>
These articles have been published
at Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday.
Probably next week we'll settle in a
more regular schedule like Monday, Wednesday,
and Friday. That means people can read their
<a href="http://xkcd.com">xkcd strip</a>
and have a small dose of Perl&nbsp;6
in the morning ;-)

<p>
I gladly watched the article on the
string concatenation operator hit the 
12th position in The Hot 25 of 
O'Reilly blogs by yesterday. This list
appears to the right of 
<a href="http://weblogs.oreilly.com/">the main weblog page</a>.
I am not so sure of how it ended there,
but that's ok, I think.

<p>
The project also had, in my opinion, a very
good reception from the Perl community.
And I found help in all channels I announced it:
the #perl6 IRC channel at freenode,
the perl6-language@perl.org mailing list,
use.perl itself and PerlMonks.
Special thanks to 
<a href="http://use.perl.org/user/autarch">autarch</a>
who generously offered to do grammar editing
improving the English of the texts &mdash;
no need to say I hastily and gladly accepted it.
All remaining mistakes in these articles are
mine.

<p>
It is not all roses however, because I have been
strugling with MovableType, the blog
software of O'Reilly site, and I am losing
by now. Sometimes it raises some pretty database
errors after an update (hum, probable entry
point for SQL injection attacks), but it
gets better after some senseless tweaking.
And more to the point, I have proposed to
maintain an index of all articles in the 
introduction, but I encountered the issue
that sometimes MT changes the URL after an
update. This gets very annoying as all articles
refer to the introduction and then need to be updated (while I pray they keep their URLs when I
do this). Also it defeats bookmarking
as a commenter already complained.
If you are well versed in MovableType and have
some clues, I am listening.

<p>
Juerd kindly granted me an account at
feather to work/experiment with pugs.
I am also maintaning the article sources
there at a SVK repository which should be
moved into Perl 6 docs later.
I am writing the articles in POD6
and it looks like it is going to be fun.
I squashed a tiny bug on the conversion
to XHTML and I am playing to get nice
looking customizations of the generated HTML.
The articles would be available (POD6 and HTML)
in the URL:

<blockquote>
<a href="http://feather.perl6.nl/user/ferreira/perl6-operators">http://feather.perl6.nl/user/ferreira/perl6-operators</a>
</blockquote>

<p>
The patch and patched Perl6::Perldoc is also
available at <a href="http://feather.perl6.nl/user/ferreira/patches">http://feather.perl6.nl/user/ferreira/patches</a>
but I filed an RT ticket as well, so it has a chance to be permanently fixed.
