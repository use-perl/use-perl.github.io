Some days before, Reuben Thomas (a known contributor to <a href="http://www.lua.org/">Lua</a> community) <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.lua.general/46135">announced</a> the release of <a href="http://rrt.sc3d.org/Software/Nancy/">Nancy</a>, "a simple web site builder" at the <a href="http://www.lua.org/lua-l.html">Lua mailing list</a>.
</a>

<p>
For the dismay of Lua afficcionados, this release was not written in Lua.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>
Oh, and it's written in Perl. I thought it might be interesting to say why. 
The problem was not libraries (I used my pure-Lua stdlib and LuaFileSystem), 
but deployment on Windows (I use Linux). I had previously built an 
all-in-one binary for Windows using a cross-compiler. That worked fine but 
made it hard to debug on Windows as I couldn't just edit-run, and also broke 
nastily when the cross-compiler was upgraded. So, I switched to LuaBinaries. 
That enabled me in the end to deploy only pre-built binaries, but at the 
cost of having to install 2 binary packages, and then do manual fiddling to 
get .lua files run as commands by the Windows shell.
</em></p>

<p><em>
ActivePerl does all this for me, and I was already using some Perl scripts 
in the same system, so by rewriting Nancy in Perl I got down to "run the 
Perl installer" as being the prerequisites for running Nancy.
</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Nancy begun its life as Lua code (and that's the reason Reuben announced this at Lua mailing list for the last time &mdash; unless it be written in Lua again in the future).
</p>

<p>
Perl still has an edge ahead before some of the popular dynamical languages out there, which (I hope) is not going away anytime soon in the future.
