<div class="span8">
<p>I failed miserably when trying to write 
a simple sub <tt>&strip</tt> to trim 
leading and trailing spaces, modifying 
its argument in-place. 
<a href="http://use.perl.org/comments.pl?sid=36848&cid=57535">My attempt</a> was:

<pre>
# in-place version
sub strip { s/^\s+//; s/\s+$//; }
# which would be used as
strip($msg);
</pre>

<p>
promptly 
<a href="http://use.perl.org/comments.pl?sid=36848&cid=57538">corrected</a> 
by Aristotle in, not one, but two flavors:

<pre>
sub strip { $_[0] =~ s/^\s+//; $_[0] =~ s/\s+$//; }

# or maybe

sub strip { s/^\s+//, s/\s+$// for $_[0] }
</pre>

<p>
When I first thought about it, I believed my
sin was failing to find 
<a href="http://www.perl.com/lpt/a/685">the topic</a>.
I mistakenly assumed the sub parameter
was already the topic, while one of the variants by
Aristotle did not use <tt>$_</tt> and the other
used a proper mechanism &mdash; the modifier "<tt>for $_[0]</tt>" &mdash;
to set it right. To tell the truth, my version
works if used just as <tt>strip()</tt>, acting on
whatever is in <tt>$_</tt>. (More on this on
a later blog entry.)

<p>
My mistake was like saying

<quote>
stripping the string is eating the leading and
trailing spaces from <b>something</b>
</quote>

where that <b>something</b> was left hanging
like a dangling pointer. The phrase below
would be more correct:

<quote>
stripping the string is eating the leading and
trailing spaces from <b>it</b> (the string)
</quote>

<p>
My programming error (in Perl language) was like an ordinary error in a phrase in casual conversation (in natural language).
And the major culprit was not <i>proof-reading</i>
what I wrote.

<p>
(Of course, it is also an issue of proficiency. 
More practice would often imply a smaller defect ratio
that could have set me free of that shame.
But this proficiency only sets higher the threshold
where mistakes are more likely. They will happen
anyway &mdash; the issue is whether they have discovered
out there or while in the domestic environment.)

<p>
So while writing prose calls for proof-reading,
programming calls for documentation and testing
to be complete. With documentation, we make clear
what is the purpose of the code (even though
<tt>$_ = "this "; strip()</tt> works, it was not
what <tt>&strip</tt> was supposed to do). The
tests would establish a certain level of confidence
on the operation of the code, at least as long
as the usage was captured by the test cases.
Extrapolation is always an enterprise with
unknown consequences.

<p>
I was guilty of being a light commenter, typing
faster than my brain takes to write a
<i>correct</i> piece of code of 34 touches. 
But it will never be easy. Fortunately, after 
Aristotle, some careful documented design and testing, many pieces of code will be as robust as most applications
need.

<p>
Ok. The entry title was provocative. It
only means: Programming is hard. And you already knew that.</p>

<p>Although you're modifying it in place, at some point you'll probably accidentally do <code>$msg = strip($msg);</code> - and $msg will get the return value of the last substitution - which is the number of substitutions performed.</p>

<p>I'd much prefer the subroutine instead returned $_[0] (although I rarely write modify-in-place routines, so maybe it just doesn't match my style, YMMV)</p>
