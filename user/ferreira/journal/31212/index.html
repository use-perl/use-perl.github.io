<p><p>I hope this day ends soon and ends well. I won't miss it. It has begun with a car crash with no consequences but a rear door which does not close anymore. And then my family was victim of an attempt  of extortion. My wife got a phone call where someone said that an accident has happened and one of our family was involved. At that instant, our daughter was not home and we thought it could be her. And then the conversation changed the tone: it was a lightning kidnappping and if we want to see her alive again, we should pay. I followed with the conversation while we desperately tried to contact her by another phone. I said how much money I could raise instantly and was instructed to convert it to prepaid cell phone cards. At last, we got the confirmation that she was well and unaware of this mess. I hung up. All this unpleasant experience followed the modus operandi of some prisoners in penitentiaries that got access to cell phones and try to get more resources to proceed with the criminal activies from behind bars. It is just too sad this state of things -- no one deserves such <i>surprises</i>.</p>

<h2>Thankfully, it turned out OK.</h2>

I'm really sorry to hear about that. That's way too much to happen in one day. I'm glad you and your family made it through the day safe and OK.
