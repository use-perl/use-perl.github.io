<div class="span8">
<p>Think about it. You have an application which holds addresses in various parts of the world and want to make a minimum sanity check for post codes. Then you write:
<pre>
  use Business::PostCode;
  # get adresses
  for (@addresses) {
     if (postcode_ok($_->country, $_->postcode)) {
       # ok, go on
     } else {
       # not ok, reject
     }
  }
</pre>
and that's it!

<p><tt>Business::PostCode</tt> would integrate national modules like <tt>Business::BR::PostCode</tt>, <tt>Business::PT::PostCode</tt>, etc. to provide a worldly great benefit. That was a suggestion raised by _brian_d_foy after cog triggered a discussion on <tt>modules@perl.org</tt> about modules for validation. Was something like this attempted before? It seems to me <tt>Business::PostCode</tt> would be trivial provided <tt>Business::&lt;Country&gt;::PostCode</tt> modules with a common protocol.

<p>What about other ideas for border-crossing Perl modules? Passport checking?</p>

Would it be better if they were Business::PostCode::BR, Business::PostCode::PT?

Yep, from an international point of view. But from a country-wise perspective, Business::&lt;Country&gt;:: would be the easy way to find out the available validation modules of a certain country. International modules (like Business::PostCode) would cross borders by requiring Business::BR::PostCode, Business::PT::PostCode as needed. My guess is that using a bunch of modules within a certain country will be more common than multi-national modules. That's the rationale for making it obvious within the Business::&lt;Country&gt; namespace and possible across nations.

Huh, never thought there would be a need for multiple postcodes in a single country; or just that we're talking all validators, not just post code. Makes perfect sense now.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)
