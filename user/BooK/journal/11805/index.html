<p><p>
Bonjour,
</p><p>
This is a short note about the YAPC::Europe web site.
</p><p>
It looks like the pre-registration process is a nice success, since
we've had about 100 registrations (98 at the time I write this)
since the site opened. Well, please continue <tt>:-)</tt>
</p><p>
We hope things will be as quick when the payment part will be online. <tt>;-)</tt>
</p><p>
Since the web site opened, we've added a few enhancements:
</p><ul>
<li>there is a small icon on the <a href="http://yapc.mongueurs.net/yapc/search/">search page</a>
   to indicate the users who
   have posted a photo,</li>
<li>you can now add your perlmonks id (if you have one),</li>
<li>there's a favicon.ico file as well (the cash register, how appropriate),</li>
<li>and for the number freaks, there's also a <a href="http://yapc.mongueurs.net/yapc/stats/">statistics page</a>. That should encourage you
   to input your monger group and your country and city.</a></li>
<li>if you feel that we've forgotten things that should be in the who's
   who, please let us know at yapc-help(at)mongueurs.net</li>
</ul>
<p>
If you already registered or have a mind to come, please take some time
to browse the whole website. It holds as much relevant information as
we could think about, information that could make the difference during
your stay in Paris. We would particularly like to point you towards
<a href="http://yapc.mongueurs.net/yapc/static/accommodations.html">this page 
regarding (group) accomodation</a>.
</p><p>
Please note that if your T-shirt size is not 'L', you should
make sure <a href="http://yapc.mongueurs.net/yapc/private/change/">you've updated your personal data with the correct size</a>
. The default used to be 'L',
but from now on it's empty by default (so we can find out who didn't
fill that part of the form, and ask for an answer).
</p><p>
Another comment: funny photos are fun indeed, but since we plan to
add a printed who's who in the proceedings (maybe), you should make
sure people will recognize you (I'm talking to the kangaroo and the
"hostage" here, but not only...) after the conference.
</p><p>
Next week, we should have something ready for the talks, and maybe also
for online payment. Speaking of talks, we've 29 talks by 18 authors in
our database at the moment. That's not enough, so keep them coming!
</p></p>
