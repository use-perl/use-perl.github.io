<p><p>I feel kind of bad about this, but...</p>
<p>Before the auction, I went to <a href="/user/cog/">cog</a> and <a href="/user/ambs/">ambs</a>
and told them they could (if they wanted) do something as stupid as I did in 2002, when I auctionned the organiser's T-shirt colour for YAPC::Europe in Paris. As you may recall, <a href="http://conferences.mongueurs.net/ye2003/"><i>pink</i> won</a>.</p>
<p>So, at the end of the auction, they actually did auction the orga's T-shirt colour. I first bid on "pink", but then I thought "<a href="http://www.axis-of-aevil.net/photos/yapc2003/IMG_1656.html">pink</a>
<a href="http://www.axis-of-aevil.net/photos/yapc2003/IMG_1696.html">is</a> <i><a href="http://www.axis-of-aevil.net/photos/yapc2003/IMG_1689.html">us</a></i>", so I needed to change to something else, quickly.
I went for the first stupid thing that came to mind (after asking <a href="/user/mir/">mirod</a> what was the English word for it)... fishnet.</p>
<p>The madman known as <a href="/user/kane/">kane</a> went totally for it and assembled a real team for fishnet. So the world was once again divided in two, with <i>orange</i> as the fishnet nemesis (even though at some point the possibility of an orange fishnet T-shirt was mentioned).
</p><p>In the end,
both teams had so much trouble counting their total bid money
that Marty went for a closed auction. The results were (these figures may not be accurate) 525 GBP for orange and 548 GBP for fishnet.</p>
<p>Right now, I feel a little sorry that I didn't bid for something saner like fluorescent green or blue hair dye (as suggested by <a href="/user/Maddingue/">Maddingue</a>).</p>
<p><i>I wonder what kind of crazy thing will happen at next year's auction...</i> (And I'm scared that body modification may be the winner in 2009.)</p></p>

<h2>fluorescent green....</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ambs/">ambs</a> on 2004-09-20T14:52:10</h3>
that was my proposal to COG before the auction. I would prefer it.



<h2>Next Year's Bid</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/barbie/">barbie</a> on 2004-09-20T16:19:42</h3>
Well if Birmingham.pm win the bid, you'll be auctioning the attendees attire. The organisers have already ensured they are not risking anything that resembles Barbie<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)



<h2>Yes, it is your fault, but...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/cog/">cog</a> on 2004-09-21T09:05:30</h3>
Don't go taking all the blame for yourself!! Oh, no, you're not going to be the only one to be punished, next year O:-) We have pictures of all of you, remember?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)<br> <br>muahahahahahahahah &gt;:-)
