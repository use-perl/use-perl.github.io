<p><p>(This is an entry I've wanted to write for a while, but never took the time to.)</p>
<p>In the last few years, my wife and me have had
the pleasure to be invited for dinner/lunch by
several Perl mongers, when we were visiting
their countries. It's always been a pleasure to meet
them (and their families), when we were half lost in a foreign country.
This added a very personal and friendly touch to several of our holiday trips (in Ireland, Italy and Denmark so far).</p>
<p>This Saturday, we had a French mongueur passing by with his wife and kids for dinner (they were on their way back from holidays). Such evenings are always nice, and I realised that if I want more, I have to let the world know.</p>
<p>Therefore, if you are a Perl monger passing by Lyon someday, drop me an email to let me know. I'd love to meet you up for a beer or dinner (in a local restaurant or at my place).</p></p>

<h2>Good idea</h2>

What a nice thought!  I've proposed to my <a href="http://www.madmongers.org/" title="madmongers.org">local monger group</a madmongers.org> that we make a similar invitation collectively.<br>
