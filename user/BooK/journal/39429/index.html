<div class="span8">
<p><p>This year at OSCON, I received a <a href="http://www.perl.org/advocacy/white_camel/">White Camel</a> award. Since I didn't attend OSCON, my good friends Liz and Wendy arranged a little ceremony at the end of YAPC::Europe 2009 where David Adler gave me a big box containing a "SchrÃÂ¶dinger White Camel".
</p><p>
Even though I knew about the award and was warned about the ceremony, my little thank-you talk didn't come out so well: I was too moved to make sense.
</p><p>
Here's what I wanted to say:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>
I'm deeply honoured and extremely proud of receiving this award.
</i></p><p><i>
First I would like to thank the people who decided I was worthy of it.
</i></p><p><i>
And I would like to add that I'm actually driven by example: in this room I see plenty of people who organize Perl workshops and conferences all over the world, that run mongers groups and technical meetings...
All these people are setting the example I followed in my work with the French Perl Mongers and the YAPC Europe Foundation.
</i></p><p><i>
So, thank you very much to all of you, for setting such a good example to follow.
</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thanks to everyone involved, and thanks a lot to the Perl community for being what it is: a large group of friendly people achieving wonderful things, both technical and non-technical.</p></p>

<h2>I like that description of the Perl community</h2>
