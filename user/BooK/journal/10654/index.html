<h1>HTTP::Proxy now supports persistent connections!</h1>

<div class="span8">
<p><p>Yay! I finally managed to get some performance
out of <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/HTTP-Proxy/">this module</a> by allowing it to handle
persistent connections in HTTP/1.1.
This is all in version 0.07!</p>
<p><i>Sometimes there's no other way than cut'n'paste.</i></p>
<p>HTTP::Proxy is nothing more than a HTTP::Daemon and a LWP::UserAgent in close collaboration (as can be seen in <a href="/user/merlyn/">merlyn</a>'<a href="http://www.stonehenge.com/merlyn/WebTechniques/col11.html">s</a>,
<a href="/user/Abigail/">Abigail</a>'<a href="http://www.foad.org/user/abigail/Perl/proxy.pl">s</a> or
<a href="/user/rafael/">rafael</a>'<a href="http://rgarciasuarez.free.fr/perl/biscuit">s</a> code).</p>

<p>I did in fact paint myself in a corner by
doing only what was rational: using the callback
version of LWP::UserAgent simple_request()
method. This enables the proxy to begin sending a response while it's still busy
receiving it.</p>
<p>Well, HTTP::Daemon supports persistent connections,
but the code that does this is in send_response()
(which I didn't use at first...) works well
with persistent connections when used with either a full response (which I cannot have, since I use a callback with LWP::UA) or a... callback as the content() of the HTTP::Response to send.</p>
<p>So I simply cut the perfect code for the task out of HTTP::Daemon, and pasted it in the callback that HTTP::Proxy gives to LWP::UA.</p>
<p>By now, I begin to find my way both in RFC 2616 and libwww-perl's source code. <tt>:-)</tt></p>
<p><i>If only I could make this work under Windows...</i></p></p>

<h2>POE based proxy</h2>

Pity you didn't implement HTTP::Proxy using POE. No need to fork, better portability<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...

<p>Yeah, yeah, I've been told that several times.<nobr> <wbr></nobr><tt>:-)</tt> </p>
<p>I'd like to work on a POE::Component that would
do what HTTP::Proxy does. It's just that I was too lazy to learn POE. And I have so much to do
until HTTP::Proxy is actually usable for more
than simple HTTP requests to HTTP::Proxy
(the filtering system
is the most exciting part of HTTP::Proxy, and
it need some more work, and a decent API). So I guess this will
happen, but only later, someday.</p>
<p>I'll soon add the capability to answer CONNECT
requests (based on my experience with
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/connect-tunnel/" title="cpan.org">connect-tunnel</a cpan.org>). I bet that
using Crypt::SSLeay and HTTP::Proxy one could create a simple man-in-the-middle attack based
on the fact that nobody really cares about the
certificate they are sent. That is, assuming people would use such a proxy (for example, if they are lead to believe it is an <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=open+proxy" title="google.com">open proxy</a google.com>).</p>

Beware that POE is likely to require very different design of API (because it must be event based). If you decide at some point to port HTTP::Proxy to POE this port will not straight-forward.
