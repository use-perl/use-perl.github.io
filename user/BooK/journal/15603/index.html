<p><p>Is there any customary way to put scripts on
CPAN? I've already put <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/connect-tunnel/">connect-tunnel</a>
on CPAN, just like a module distribution, but I
wonder if that's the standard way to do it.</p>

The scripts section is deader than dead. Just be sure to document it right and, as far as I can tell, search does the right thing.

Wow, you mean people actually read the FAQ?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) I leave it in there as I keep hoping that it'll come back to life, but it's more likely that search will come to differentiate between a script and a module distribution and index them accordingly. For now, the FAQ is correct if a bit overly optimistic.

<p>Things do not work very well in <a href="http://www.cpan.org/scripts/index.html" title="cpan.org">the script section</a cpan.org>. Take the first script for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>the link to <a href="http://www.cpan.org/authors/id/D/DW/DWHEELER/activitymail/activitymail-1.04" title="cpan.org">activitymail-1.04</a cpan.org> points to a 404</li>
<li>but <a href="http://search.cpan.org/" title="cpan.org">search.cpan.org</a cpan.org> is quite able to find <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/activitymail/" title="cpan.org">activitymail</a cpan.org>, which is a complete distribution with a test suite, a META.yml, a MANIFEST and a bigger version number.</li>
</ul>
<p>It's nice to be able to package a script through <tt>make dist</tt>, rather than just sending a bare file to PAUSE. This gives room for tests and examples. How would search.cpan differentiate a script from a module? Via the META.yml file ? Thanks to a special section like today?</p>
<p>Mmm, this looks too much like a "wouldn't it be nice if..." post, so I'll stop here.</p>

 Yes, if you package it like a distribution as I suggested, search will index it like a module but it will only  show bits in the documentation section rather than in the modules section. There are plenty of distributions which contain scripts along with the modules.
<p>
This is the mostly right thing, but the metadata should provide more information for the indexing to make it more obvious and provide the end user with more information overall and not just for scripts v. modules. Yes, wouldn't it be nice...?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
</p><p>
That scripts sections hasn't been really touched for...well, 6 years or so....and the demands have changed quite a lot since then. It's quaint.</p>

<h2>It has to be a single file?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/BooK/">BooK</a> on 2003-11-06T10:22:35</h3>
<p>OK, it's a quite straightforward system.
That'll teach me to read the FAQ.<nobr> <wbr></nobr><tt>:-S</tt> </p>
<p>The scripts have to be in a single file.
So much for tests.</p>
