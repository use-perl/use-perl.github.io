<p><p>Bonjour,
</p><p>
The conference is now in less than two weeks time. We have a rough
estimate of how many of you are coming (about 190). We now need to count
more precisely; that's why you really should purchase your ticket now
if you plan to come. It will really help us, you know. <tt>:-)</tt>
</p><p>
T-shirts are being printed as I type this, the final count is 260.
We apologize in advance to the 261st attendee; you won't have a T-shirt.
</p><p>
All speakers should finalise their proceedings (in POD) as soon as possible
and send them to <tt>yapc-papers@mongueurs.net</tt>.
</p><p>
We have finally (and regretfully) decided not to provide printed
proceedings, due to time and especially budget constraints. We will of
course provide proceedings in PDF, at least a few days before the
conference, so that most of you will be able to download them. They'll
also be available in HTML from the web site. We wish it could have been
otherwise, but we simply don't have the money. And time is running
short.
</p><p>
Onto a happier note, net access. The wifi access is being worked on,
and the first tests are quite positive. Remember to pack your wireless
gear. We will also have old-fashioned access with wires and stuff, so
bring long RJ-45 cables if you need to be tethered to a switch.
</p></p>
