<div class="span8">
<p><p>Recently, I've taken the habit (not in my CPAN modules, though) to add the following snippet at the beginning of all my test scripts:</p>
<pre>
BEGIN {
    eval { require Test::More; }; # and other Test:: modules
    print "1..0 # Skip Test::More missing\n", exit if $@;
}
</pre>
<p>This is because I do not expect the people who install those modules/scripts to run the test suite, and I don't want the installation process to whine about Test::More missing (if it's in the <tt>Makefile.PL</tt>) and stop and sulk.</p>
<p>I think that the Test:: modules should not be
part of the prerequisites for <i>using</i> a module. Am I right?</p></p>

<h2>Test::More - don't leave home without it</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jplindstrom/">jplindstrom</a> on 2004-10-11T12:39:09</h3>
Isn't Test::More one of those modules that every Perl installation should have? So the sooner someone is "forced" to install it the better, IMHO.<br> <br>As dependencies go, isn't Test::More pure Perl, so it should install everywhere without problem?



<h2>module prerequisites</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/geoff/">geoff</a> on 2004-10-11T13:59:16</h3>
while I'm a guity as anyone for having done this in the past, I've not come to support the position that test modules should <i>not</i> be prerequisites a la <code>PREREQ_PM</code> despite the ubiquity of <code>Test::More</code> - there is a large difference between the test environment and the code itself, and making it impossible to <i>build and install</i> a module when <i>test environment</i> dependencies are missing just seems wrong.<br> <br><br/><br/>but another solution to using a <code>BEGIN</code> block in each test file is to override the <code>test</code> target in the <code>Makefile</code> by creating your own <code>MY::test</code> subroutine in <code>Makefile.PL</code>.  something similar to <a href="http://search.cpan.org/src/GEOFF/Apache-Clean-0.05/Makefile.PL" title="cpan.org">this</a cpan.org> (but for <code>Test::More</code>, of course).  while it doesn't protect against people running the test files by themselves, it give an appropriate response for people just following <code>perl Makefile.PL &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make test</code>...

<p>
If you can't run the tests, then how do you know that your users can actually use the module?</p>

Like he said, he doesn't do this for modules.  That's a different world with different expectations.

<p>In fact, the conclusion came to me after posting that entry:</p>
<blockquote><div>It would be nice to separate the <i>test prerequisites</i> and the <i>usage prerequisites</i>.</div></blockquote>
<p>I've just been told (hi <a href="/user/Maddingue/" title="perl.org">Maddingue</a perl.org>!) that <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Module-Build" title="cpan.org">Module::Build</a cpan.org>  allows this (well <tt>build_requires</tt> is not quite the same as a <tt>test_requires</tt>, but probably close enough).</p>

<h2>Test scripts prereqs</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Maddingue/">Maddingue</a> on 2004-10-11T20:54:42</h3>
In fact, I think what you want is something similar to the <code>build_requires</code> in Build.PL but for the tests only: <code>tests_requires</code>.<br/><br/>Maybe you could ask Ken Williams to add this for the next release of Module::Build?



<h2>I say make it a dependency</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/grantm/">grantm</a> on 2004-10-12T09:53:11</h3>
<p>I think Test::Simple should be marked as a dependency.  It really is needed to run the basic tests to confirm the module works.  If you need other more esoteric Test::* modules then test scripts which degrade gracefully may be a good idea.  Unfortunately, that would not allow you to take the fullest advantage of the the service provided by the wonderful CPAN-Testers team.</p>

<p>On a related note, many CPAN modules are also repackaged in RPM,<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.deb and related formats.  These files are easier for Joe Public to install and they generally don't list the Test modules as prerequisites if they're only required at build time.</p>

<p>Well, I take for granted the fact that all CPAN testers have at least all the Test::* modules installed.</p>

<p>Yes, but surely that's largely as a result of those modules being listed as prerequisites in the distributions being tested.</p>
