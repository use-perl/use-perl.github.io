It seems that some people 
<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/9f7yt/new_main_perl_6_website_perl6org/c0cjjil">don't</a>
<a href="/user/sigzero/journal/39552">like</a>
the new <a href="http://perl6.org/">Perl 6</a> logo
(<a href="http://svn.pugscode.org/pugs/misc/camelia.txt">Camelia</a>)
</p><p>
Do you remember the time when the worst thing people said about Perl
was "it's vaporware"? The people working on Perl 6 had a hard time
failing to convince them of the contrary, no matter how many commits happened,
how many tests were passing, how many implementations were in the works.
</p><p>
Today, it seems the worst thing people can say about Perl 6 matches 
<tt>/the logo is (gay|feminine|childish)/</tt>. To me, this looks like 
the easiest kind of critique to discard.
</p><p>
As for those who think that the camel is more manly than a colorful
butterly, maybe they should remember that
<a href="http://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=31583">the Camel is named Amelia</a>.
</p><p>
And by the way, it seems to have made people forget the "vaporware"
argument. Even if you don't like how the new logo looks, you can still love
it for that.

This was supposed to be my first post for the Ironman Perl blogging contest.
I resolved to post every Monday... Late before even starting! :-(

<h2>different interpretation</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/link/">link</a> on 2009-09-10T19:12:08</h3>
<p>To me it seemed more like people have moved from what and when to an all round encompassing negativity.</p>



<h2>Logo for the times we're in</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/sjn/">sjn</a> on 2009-09-11T14:47:50</h3>
<p>I think it's a great logo, but because of it's effect and not it's artisitc merit (I think it's as ugly as anything I've seen.) I'd guess the logo's purose is to motivate someone with talent to come up with something better (to which I really hope it succeeds.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>
