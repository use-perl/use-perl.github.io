Bonjour,
</p><p>
This time I'm going to talk about talks. And speak about speakers.
(I won't write about writers, though.) If you intend to give a talk
at YAPC::Europe, you should send an email with your proposal at
yapc-papers(at)mongueurs.net. All the details about talks subjects
and submission are at <a href="http://yapc.mongueurs.net/yapc/static/cft.html">http://yapc.mongueurs.net/yapc/static/cft.html</a>.
</p><p>
We have already received more than 40 great proposals. People giving
talks have asked whether their talk has been chosen. And the person here in
charge of proceedings needs some time to get things done. So we have
decided to advance the deadline for proposals to June 1st. Every
speaker will know by June 8th if their talk is accepted.
</p><p>
We would like to see more tutorials (we only have two for the moment),
and more stuff about Perl6 and Parrot (we'd like to schedule a parrot
track).
</p><p>
Some subjects are not much covered, like: GUI, multimedia (fun) stuffs,
Perl in the science fields...
</p><p>
But this is just for inspiration, feel free to submit your talks on
other subjects, as well.
</p><p>
Lightning talks are always welcome, and we will probably follow the trend
started in Munich and play the lightning talks without competition.
The lightning talks will be 5 minutes long
(each of them, not the whole session).

</p><p>
On the communication front, we have set up an irc channel on rhizomatic.net.
It's very aptly named #yapc::eu, and is guarded by slavorg (I hope.)
English and French will be spoken here.
</p><p>
</p><p>
There are also links on the statistics page to the search results.
So you'll know who's that <a href="http://yapc.mongueurs.net/yapc/search/?country=bo&name=">Bolivian</a> guy who lives in Philadelphia. :-)
It also looks like the conference will be very popular in <a href="http://yapc.mongueurs.net/yapc/search/?country=gh&name=">Ghana</a> and
<a href="http://yapc.mongueurs.net/yapc/search/?country=ng&name=">Nigeria</a>, but I have the feeling these people won't show up in Paris,
though...
</p></p>
