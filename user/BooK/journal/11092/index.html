<p><p><a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/connect-tunnel/">connect-tunnel</a>
is my first script on CPAN (latest version <a href="http://www.cpan.org/authors/id/B/BO/BOOK/">available here</a>).
I am studying HTTP and CONNECT tunnels at work
(to find a way to detect or defeat them),
so I first started by writing a tool to create
one of those two kinds of tunnels.
Naturally, this is not the first Perl program
to do this: I found several of them with Google
after I had the first version working. {grin}
</p><p>
So I went a little further, and looked into the
depths of libwww-perl. Did I say this is a
wonderful library? Did you know that LWP::UserAgent actually supports the CONNECT
method? It simply returns the opened socket
in <code>$response->{client_socket}</code>.
Ain't that neat?</p>
<pre>
my $request  = HTTP::Request->new(
    CONNECT => 'http://ssh.example.com:443/' );
my $response = $ua->request($request);

my $socket = $response->{client_socket};
</pre>
<p>The script supports tunnels to
multiple destinations, as well as
concurrent connections to the same destination.
You can also change the User-Agent string (ok, that bit is quite easy). But
most of all, since it's LWP::UserAgent that
handles the authentication, the script supports
Basic, Digest and NTLM authentication.
And I only had to subclass LWP::UserAgent like this:</p>
<pre>
package TunnelAgent;

use vars qw( @ISA );
@ISA = qw(LWP::UserAgent);

sub get_basic_credentials { return ( $user, $pass ) };
</pre>
<p>Couldn't be any simpler.</p>
<p>I had to dive in libwww-perl's source code,
which is not that easy to follow (lots of modules, lots of indirections), but it was well 
worth it. I built myself some experience with libwww-perl while writing <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/HTTP-Proxy/">HTTP::Proxy</a>,
and it helped a little.</p>
<p>Until I find a way to block myself from
tunneling outside, I'll use this tool rather
than any other when I need more than just HTTP.</p>
<p><i>I would have written the first version so much faster if I had known the difference between 
<code>read()</code> and <code>sysread()</code>...</i></p>
