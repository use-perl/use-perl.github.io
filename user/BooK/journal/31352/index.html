<p><p>I've just uploaded a new module on CPAN, which is called <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/SVN-Dump"><tt>SVN::Dump</tt></a>.
The goal is to be able to read one or several dumps produced by the command <tt>svnadmin dump</tt>, modify them and then writing them back to file or to  <tt>svnadmin load</tt> so as to perform useful tricks.
</p>
<p>The tricks I have in mind include:</p>
<ul>
<li>chronologically reorder revisions when the repository is the result of merging of several distinct repositories (I heard that when doing an <tt>svn update {DATE}</tt>, svn actually does a binary search on the revisions, assuming they are in chronological order)</li>
<li>do various filtering tricks (with the power of Perl and not just prefixes, as does <tt>svndumpfilter</tt>)
<li>directly merging several repository into one while keeping the chronological order of the revisions</li>
<li>etc.</li> 
</ul>
<p>Some of these things should be possible to do directly to the stream coming from <tt>svnadmin dump</tt> but others will require several dumps and probably several passes. So the <tt>SVN::Dump::Index</tt> and the <tt>SVN::Dump::TranslationTable</tt> modules may not be far away...</p>
<p>The module is very alpha at the moment: I hated myself for the interface when I wrote the two examples included in the distribution. <tt>;-)</tt></p>
<p>Everything is subject to change, and feedback is very welcome.</p></p>

<h2>What does it do?</h2>

Could you explain a bit more what this does in layman's terms? I use SVN, but I'm not familiar with svndump.

<h2>Re:What does it do?</h2>

<p> <tt>svnadmin dump</tt> is a tool that takes a SVN repository and produces a text file you can typically backup, pass around, and use to create an identical repository with the help of <tt>svnadmin load</tt>. You can also push the revisions of a repository into another existing one with <tt>svnadmin load</tt> and the appropriate dump. But the chronological order of revisions is then broken.</p>
<p>When I set off to create <tt>SVN::Dump</tt>, I actually wanted to be able to reorder a repository chronologically. To do that, you need to take a dump of your repository, mangle it, and then load it back into an empty repository. Which is why I needed to be able to parse a dump.</p>
<p>This first version can read a dump, and produce a byte-for-byte identical dump from it. Not very useful, but it's a start. Future versions will include tools to reorder revisions, filter them, etc. By this time, I should have a better API, so writing your own dump munging tools should be easier.</p>
