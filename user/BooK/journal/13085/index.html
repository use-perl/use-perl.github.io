<p><p>
Bonjour,
</p><p>
We first would like to thank the 96 people who have already purchased
their ticket to the conference. With the speakers, we attain a total of  145
committed users.
</p><p>
We would also like to thank all the authors of talk proposals and
apologize for the long acceptation delay.
We received 13 tutorials, 16 lightnings talks and 57 other talks.
</p><p>
Most talks will go in their shorter length if two durations where
proposed. All lightning talks will go because we allocate an hour
and a half for them. We can't accept lightning talks anymore.
Now for tutorials, the choice was difficult.
</p><p>
We have selected the talks. Most have been accepted. The exceptions
were tutorials where competition was fierce.
</p><p>
We have 7 tutorials, the first 6 of which happening on the first day (tutorial day)
of the conference:
</p><ul>
<li><i>Programing with iterators and generators</i>, by Mark Jason Dominus</li>
<li><i>Tricks of the wizards</i>, by Mark Jason Dominus</li>
<li><i>mod_perl 2.0 by Example</i>, by  Stas Bekman</li>
<li><i>Web Application Development using mod_perl and CPAN</i>, by Thomas Klausner</li>
<li><i>When perl is not quite fast enough</i>, by Nicholas Clark</li>
<li><i>SVG-based GUIs</i>, by Ronan Oger</li>
<li><i>Tieing and Overloading Objects in Perl</i>, by Dave cross</li>
</ul><p>
MJD will run by himself his own session of twelve lightning talks
that were very well received at YAPC::Israel.
</p><p>
You can have a look at the list of accepted talks, and their abstracts,
at the following address: <a href="http://yapc.mongueurs.net/yapc/talks/">http://yapc.mongueurs.net/yapc/talks/</a>.
</p><p>
Don't forget to purchase your ticket, and make sure you've given us
your correct T-shirt size.
</p><p>
See you in a month.
</p></p>
