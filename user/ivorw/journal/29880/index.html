<div class="span8">
<p><p>Inspired by a future need for the <a href="http://cogers.org">Cogers Society</a> to do online debating, I decided to have a go at writing an IRC bot. This was my first attempt.</p>

<p>I decided on Bot::BasicBot as a start point - I had heard good things about this module. I picked Time::Piece and Parse::RecDescent as two modules to use that I am already familiar with. </p>
<p>I found when developing this that lanching the bot gave two warnings about calls to <code>new()</code> being deprecated in POE::Component::IRC. I happened to be in correspondence with the module's author later, and prodded jerakeen (author of Bot::BasicBot) via RT. The outcome is that Bot::BasicBot has now been brought up to date and everyone's happy.</p>

<p>The idea is to give cronic fairly simple commands, such as:</p>
<code>
cronic: at 12:30 say It's lunch time<br />
cronic: after 5:00 say Your five minutes are up<br /><br />
</code>

<p>The bot will ignore any text on the channel for which it has not been directly addressed. The bot will also respond to PRIVMSG, allowing personal reminders.</p>

<p>There's still plenty of things for me to do:</p><ul>
<li><p>Implement time zones; migrate to DateTime. Work in progress. This has involved me grokking DateTime and associated modules.</p></li>
<li><p>Documentation. I need to put up a webpage somewhere with "how to use this bot".</p></li>
<li><p>Persistent events in a database. These could include perl monger meeting reminders and people's birthdays.</p></li>
<li><p>More commands than just "say". It would be useful for cronic to switch the topic, for example.</p></li></ul>

<p>The bot is up and running on #bots for those who want to have a play. I'll try and catch any scrollback, but if you want, you can email bug reports to cronic at xemaps.com.</p></p>

<h2>incomplete channel spec</h2>

<p> <i>"The bot is up and running on #bots"</i>
</p><p>That's an incomplete spec.  There are many IRC nets, and they don't talk to each other.  You need to include the network name when you mention a channel.
</p><p>Yeah, it's probably clear to <i>you</i> and to the three people you know that might most be interested, but it's completely opaque to the casual reader.</p>

irc.perl.org is kind of implied by this being use.perl.org and the bot being written in perl<br><br>Obviously if it was some obscure IRC Network that would be different.

Again, you may think that to be obvious, but there are far more people on EFnet #perl than on irc.perl.org, and Freenode #perl comes in fairly large as well.

Gotta get out every once in a while.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>
