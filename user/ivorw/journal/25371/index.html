<p><p>Flew in yesterday from LHR (London Heathrow). The first thing to notice is the temperature: >30&deg;C. Granted we have had hot weather in London recently, but it was not as hot, and unpredictably mixed up in a traditionally British way, with intermittent overcasting clouds and thunder storms.</p>
<p>The second thing to notice is that many buildings in Toronto are only half built. This includes the airport. International passengers were bussed from "Terminal Infield" (or perhaps this should be terminal outfield or perhaps terminal in field :), to the main terminal building where immigration and customs etc. are. Having done the necessary stuff here including retrieving my luggage, I find that there is no bar in the building. So I take a taxi to 89 Chestnut - the conference venue which is also where I'm staying.</p>
<p>There's no bar in this building either - it is a student residence, but the security man recommends Mr. Greenjeans which is inside a mall called the Eaton Centre. The idea of a pub inside a shopping mall does not appeal, as this combination in England is a recipe for disaster, but this bar seems OK.</p>
<p>Today I've been exploring and getting other matters sorted out like the right kind of adapter plug to use with my laptop, and internet access from my room (I'm using this to post this journal).</p>
<p>The feeling of Toronto is quite cosmopolitan - most of the shops here seem to be run by Asians: Chinese or Indians. It was an Indian shop that was able to help with getting me the right mains plug adaptor.</p>
<p>Looking forward to the conference. Will see how it pans out. May post more perlish journals if I get the urge.</p></p>
