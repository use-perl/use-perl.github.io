<p><p>Yesterday evening, I attended an evening social event. This was a follow up to the web frameworks talks in November, with presentations on Catalyst, Django (python) and Ruby on Rails.</p> 
<p>I was due to be at this venue in any case, as it was the AGM of the <a href="http://cogers.org">Cogers</a>. I had a smile seeing the sign on the staircase to the minstrel gallery, saying that this area was reserved for London 2.0 RC1, and was reminded of some newbie asking where you could download London.pm from and what it does :).</p>
<p>There were plenty of Python and Ruby geeks present, but only one Perl guy besides myself. A poor show, because I know that this event was posted and discussed on the London.pm list.</p>
<p>For once, I didn't find myself having to defend or make excuses for Perl. A Python guy asked me about Perl 6, expecting me to be embarrassed; I told him all about Pugs ant the effect it has had on the Perl community, which was news to him. I was also able to update him on Parrot, which he was under the impression was moribund. However, it's probably just pining for the fjords :).</p>
<p>Even if there hadn't been a Cogers meeting in the same venue, I may well have turned up. I will certainly go to the next one if another such meeting is organised. Come on Perl community. Come on London.pm. Where were you?</p>
