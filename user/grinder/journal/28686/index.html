<p>.. and wondered why I was getting such perplexing errors. Then I realised that I had omitted the name of the script, and was thus executing the word list file.</p>

<p>This reminds me of the time at school when I tried to compile a COBOL program with a Pascal compiler. I got a thick stack of fan-fold back from the computer room. Page after page of errors. It did nearly manage to parse one line correctly, when it got to</p>

<blockquote><tt>PROCEDURE DIVISION</tt></blockquote>

<p>... but apart from that it recorded several thousand syntax errors. I like it when programs march on stubbornly in the face of impossible odds. It makes me feel smarter than them.</p></p>

<i>I like it when programs march on stubbornly in the face of impossible odds. It makes me feel smarter than them.</i> <p>
There is historical justification for a compiler to do this.  Back in the days of punch cards and line printers, the time between submitting a job to compile a program and seeing the result was measured in minutes, hours, or days.  So, it was extremely important for the compiler to tell you about as many errors as possible in a single run so that you could fix as much as possible before sending the job back again.</p><p>
Nowadays, with interactive computers, the sumit/run/result cycle is measured in fractions of a second - so you just fix the first error and don't even try to figure out which of the following errors are cascaded consequences of the first and which are separate errors but just compile it again immediately.</p>

(replying several months late<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br><br>What is scary is that it got to line 56367 before it noticed that something was wrong...<br><br>

<p>Hey, better late than never, and it's a good point.</p>

<p>I took a closer look at the file. Line 56367 seems pretty boring, although line 56366 is much more interesting. It contains the word</p>

<blockquote> <div><tt>do</tt></div> </blockquote>

<p>To avoid this error in future, I think the addition of the keyword "aardvark" to the language would be of vital importance. There's just the small detail of figuring out what it would do.</p>
