<p><p>An item came up on the perl.org contact address the other day: someone was asking where to find Pex::Text since they couldn't install it.</p>

<p>My first stop was to try out a couple of things on search.cpan.org, but the results were a little too helpful, i.e., pages and pages of results or nothing at all.<p>

<p>So I fired up my second tool of choice, based on acme's most excellent Parse::CPAN::Packages and after a couple of regexp searches I was satisfied nothing remotely like it exists.</p>

<p>I then turned to a reputable search engine and ran a search on "Pex::Text" and the first page was what looked to be like sploit sites, written in various slavic and asian languages I have trouble identifying.</p>

<p>So I closed the ticket saying that the person was on their own. But for my own edification, I'd like to know if anyone has heard anything about it (what it does, what it's used for/in), just for the record (and the fact that reputable search engines will no doubt pick up on this journal in the future).</p></p>

The current version (3.0) is apparently written in Ruby, assembly and C but previous versions (e.g. 2.7) were written in Perl, Python, assembly and C.
