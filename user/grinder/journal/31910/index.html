<p><p>I just a spent considerable amount of time to get Crypt::SSLeay installed. Far too much time. At first I blamed myself, my host, my OpenSSL installation, perl, everything.</p>

<p>Finally I searched the web and found the following message:</p>

http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/httpd-test-dev/200301.mbox/%3c5.2.0.9.2.20030130000312.028ea1b8@pop3.rowe-clan.net%3e

<p>Turns out that there's a bug in the code, and a one-liner patch to SSLeay.xs fixes it. There's even an RT ticket on the matter. Grrr!</p>

<p>So, if you see the following warning in your build:</p>

<pre>SSLeay.xs:252: warning: passing arg 2 of `SSL_set_info_callback' from incompatible pointer type</pre>

<p>... and the test dumps core, then patch the source as follows:</p>

<h2>Please go all the way</h2>

Hi,<br><br>if you've already spent too much time tracking this down, then please go all the way and bug the author so he uploads a fixed release to CPAN. I do this all the time and I wholeheartedly think this is an important service to the community. I would guess Florian Ragwitz / rafl would be reasonably responsive. After all, he maintains much of the debian perl stuff if I am not mistaken.<br><br>If he doesn't respond, you can always ask modules@perl.org to make you co-maintainer so you can upload a quick fix. (Provided the module's licensed under a free license.)<br><br>Thanks!<br><br>Steffen

<p>Steffen,</p>

<p>It's <i>already</i> filed as a bug on RT. The patch was proposed <i>three</i> years ago. I posted this entry mainly for web searches as much as anything else. RT isn't crawled, so the usual search engines don't know abou it.</p>

<p>This is a crucial module for anyone doing https work. If I were to take it over, I would be doing everyone a disservice, since I know I could not devote the required tuits. I do other stuff. But if someone reading wants to volunteer for a good cause, module-authors is the place to go. See you there<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

I'll stop bugging you to do anything. But let me explain myself first:<br><br>Your logic has a bit of a flaw. Just because you do not have the time to adopt the module and make it one of your own, it may well be that you have the half-hour to apply the patch and make a<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.tar.gz. That would make the module *slightly* better without you becoming its new full-time maintainer.<br><br>That being said, I know and understand ENOTENOUGHTUITS, so I'll stop labouring the point.

<p>Nah, you have a point. I'll see if I can talk Joshua Chamas into making me co-maintainer. At least with that one line fix, the module would already be better than it is now.</p>
