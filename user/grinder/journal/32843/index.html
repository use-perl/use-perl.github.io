<p>
<p>Dear Lazyweb,</p>

<p>I've just spent the better part of an hour searching the web and coming up blank, and finally coding up my own SQL statement to solve the following problem: given a two dates, how many years apart are they? I didn't want to use Oracle's date minus date equals number of days, because I wanted to avoid the hassle of dealing with leap years.</p>

<pre>
select
    case
    when (to_char(sysdate, 'MM'  ) - to_char(to_date(:dt), 'MM')) > 0
        then (to_char(sysdate, 'YYYY') - to_char(to_date(:dt), 'YYYY'))
    when (to_char(sysdate, 'MM'  ) - to_char(to_date(:dt), 'MM')) < 0
        then (to_char(sysdate, 'YYYY') - to_char(to_date(:dt), 'YYYY')) - 1
    else
        case when (to_char(sysdate, 'DD'  ) - to_char(to_date(:dt), 'DD')) >= 0
        then
            (to_char(sysdate, 'YYYY') - to_char(to_date(:dt), 'YYYY'))
        else
            (to_char(sysdate, 'YYYY') - to_char(to_date(:dt), 'YYYY')) - 1
        end
    end as "y"    
    -- ,(to_char(sysdate, 'MM'  ) - to_char(to_date(:dt), 'MM'))   as "m",
    -- ,(to_char(sysdate, 'DD'  ) - to_char(to_date(:dt), 'DD'))   as "d"
from dual
</pre>

<p>I've tested a number of boundary conditions and it seems correct to me.</p>

<p>Now, after you stop sniggering, you may show me the function I overlooked that would have done this for me, or point out any obvious bugs.</p></p>

<h2>Depends on your dialect</h2>

<p>Date functions aren't really standard in SQL, so it's a question of what RDBMS you're using.  For Sybase and SQL server, you could use <code>datediff(yy, @date1, @date2)</code>.</p>
<p>Looks like you've got Oracle.  In which case I think if you used months, you wouldn't have to worry about leap years:</p><p><blockquote> <div><tt>months_between(date1, date2)/12</tt></div> </blockquote> But I haven't tested that.
<p>As usual, Ask Tom has a nice answer: <a href="http://asktom.oracle.com/tkyte/Misc/DateDiff.html" title="oracle.com">an implementation of DateDiff in PL/SQL</a oracle.com>.  Looks nice and tidy too.</p>

<p>The trouble with <tt>months_between</tt> is that it doesn't return nice sharp integers, it returns floats. This always makes me wonder about things like whether 11.6 months round up to a year.</p>

<p>One more damned thing to go wrong, and all that.</p>

<h2>Try this...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/bart/">bart</a> on 2007-03-31T15:48:24</h3>
I don't have access to an Oracle system right now, but this might just work.<p><blockquote> <div><tt>years<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:= trunc((to_number(to_char(date2, 'YYYYMMDD'))-to_number(to_char(date1, 'YYYYMMDD')))/10000)</tt></div> </blockquote> The idea is that you just want to subtract the years, but when the value for 'MMDD' for the lower date (date1), taken as a 4 digit number, is larger than that of the later (date2), then you'll have a "borrow" (AKA "carry" for subtraction) from the years. And then, you'll just throw the days/months value away, as it's incorrect anyway. It served its purpose.

ooh sweet, I like this. The yyyymmdd insight is very clever. According to some quick tests it checks out just fine.<br><br>Thanks!

<h2>TIMESTAMPs and INTERVALs</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jdavidb/">jdavidb</a> on 2007-03-31T15:54:56</h3>
<p>With most recent versions of Oracle, you can use the ANSI-SQL standard TIMESTAMP date types and associated functions, which will give you INTERVAL data types when you subtract, and those can be fairly intelligently converted to years.  I haven't gotten to use these as much as I like, but so far they have been very nice.</p>
