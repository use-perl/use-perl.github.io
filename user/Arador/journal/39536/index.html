<p><p><i>This is a reply to chromatic's post <a href="http://www.modernperlbooks.com/mt/2009/08/the-problem-with-prototypes.html">The Problem with Prototypes</a>, but his blog didn't allow me to post it there so I post it here.</i></p>

<p>Pretty much everyone agrees that there are good  (such as blocks and sometimes reference) prototypes and bad ones (scalar most of all). Few discuss the third class: the ugly glob prototype.</p>

<p>perlsub describes them as such:
<blockquote>A *  allows the subroutine to accept a bareword, constant, scalar expression, typeglob, or a reference to a typeglob in that slot. The value will be available to the subroutine either as a simple scalar, or (in the latter two cases) as a reference to the typeglob.</blockquote></p>

<p>In other words, they are the same as scalar prototypes, except that they also accept globs and barewords. This is mainly used to pass filehandles, like this:</p>

<p><blockquote><code>sub foo (*) {...}<br>
<br>
foo STDIN;</p>
</code></blockquote>
but in fact it can be used to pass any bareword to function, as it leaves the interpretation of it to the function.</p>

<p>It's tempting to call this bad, but it offers some API possibilities that would otherwise not be possible, hence I would call it ugly rather than bad <i>per se</i>.</p></p>

<p>I didn't mention the glob prototype because I want to discourage the use of barewords.</p>

<p>There is an omission in your list of good reasons to use prototypes.</p><p>A final good reason to use prototypes is in a comparison sub.  If you pass sort a subroutine with ($$) as a prototype then it passes the arguments in @_ rather than setting $a and $b in the package that sort was called from.  If you're setting up a sort in a different package than you're calling sort in, this can be a lifesaver.</p><p>This may seem like an obscure boundary case, but I've personally found it to be the most common reason why I've used prototypes at $work.</p>
