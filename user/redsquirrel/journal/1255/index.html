<div class="span8">
<p>An overwhelming feeling of restlessness has come over me. My intense hubris has returned, telling me that I need to find a "real programming job," that I'm wasting away here, surrounded by mediocrity. What a bunch of crap.
<p>Although my hubris is persistent, and let me tell you, it's intense, I can't figure out why I'm restless.  I'm in a place that is giving me a ton of freedom and training.  I learn new things almost daily (which isn't saying much, since I don't know much). I can pretty much chart my own course.
<p>
I guess I just feel like there is no one else around me who is as interested (OK, sometimes obsessed) with programming as I am.  The books I've read lately have been awesome, and there are a dozen more waiting in the wings. I get so excited about what I'm reading, but I don't feel like there's anyone who shares that excitement as I do.
<p>
I just finished <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1565926099/">Perl for System Administration</a> and I am currently in the midst of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0932633420/">The Psychology of Computer Programming</a>. I can't decide what to read next, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0385267746/">The Design of Everyday Things</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/020141970X/">Programming Applications for Netscape Servers</a>, or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1565921488/">Practical UNIX and Internet Security</a>.
<p>
I guess this restlessness stems from this undying desire inside me to catch up, to learn more, to make up for all the years I wasn't programming. I wonder if I'll ever feel like I've officially caught up. Probably not.</p>
