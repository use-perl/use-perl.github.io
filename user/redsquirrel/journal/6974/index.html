<p><a href="http://www.xpuniverse.com/">XP Universe 2002</a> has ended and it was amazing.  I learned a lot of stuff, but that goes without saying, since I know so little.  But what was even more valuable about my time there was the informal interactions I had with people.
<p>
I got to know 6 Chicago-based guys and this is really cool.  All of them attend <a href="http://wiki.cs.uiuc.edu/CHAD">ChAD</a> and the conversations we had were excellent.  It is so energizing to talk with people who get excited about the same things I do.
<p>
Tuesday had some big highlights for me:
<ul>
<li>Participated in a live XP mini-project developing a <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/index.html">Ruby</a> web application.  I am now very interested in Ruby.
<li>While I was coding with my pair, <a href="http://www.xprogramming.com/">Ron Jeffries</a> and <a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/">Martin Fowler</a> stood behind us for about 10 minutes, watching.
<li>At lunch there was an empty seat next to me for a while.  Then there wasn't.  <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?KentBeck">Kent Beck</a> sat next to me.  It was awesome to be able to talk to him about <a href="http://www.openspaceworld.org/english/openspace.html">OpenSpace</a> and his upcoming book <a href="http://btobshop.barnesandnoble.com/textbooks/booksearch/isbninquiry.asp?isbn=0321146530">Test-Driven Development</a>.
</ul>
I can't wait to start my new position at work now!</p>
