<div class="span8">
<p>Thanks to the helpful folks who clarified the status of CamelPack in my previous entry.<br/><br/>I *may/probably* will put installing GD.pm on my system on the back burner.
I went ahead and installed Dev-C++ but haven't messed with it yet.<br>
Interestingly enough, it looks like upgrading to 5.8 compounded my problem, <a href="http://www.perl.com/doc/FAQs/nt/perlwin32faq9.html">perlwin32faq9 </a> says <blockquote><i>Win32 Is there a GD module available for Perl<br>GD now works with Win32, and can be installed using PPM </blockquote>
But the <a href="http://ppm.activestate.com/BuildStatus/5.8-G.html">ActiveState  build status page</a> says <blockquote><i>GD  	2.35  	FAIL</i></blockquote> It seems to be borne out by this post by Xavi on <a href="http://www.codecomments.com/archive210-2004-7-232973.html">codecomments.com</a><blockquote><i>Finally I've achived to install GD uninstalling activestate 5.8 and
installing 5.6 without any problem.</i>
</blockquote>. 
I found directions and clarifications from Dave Roth <a href="http://www.foo.be/docs/tpj/issues/vol2_3/tpj0203-0003.html">here</a> That *may* be out of date though because the latest binary I found of GD.pll (dll) is <a href="http://backpan.cpan.org/authors/Dave_Roth/">Win32GD_v960611</a>
<br>
This is pretty much a sidetrack from what I'm *actually* working on but since it's a continual problem, I'm going to work on locally compiling modules as time allows. <br>Since I went ahead and downloaded what CamelPack couldn't find, I probably have most of what it was supposed to do. The exception being, I think, adding the requisite paths. I can probably take care of that. I'll start out with something thats supposed to be simple. ( I googled around a bit but didn't find a single example in my short search BTW )<br>Any pointers to something (relatively) simple to start with will be appreciated.<br><br>
Vanilla Perl sounds enticing but I get the distinct feeling everything I'm doing would come to a screeching halt while I tried to get back to what I have installed from ActiveState. Sucky as that is.<br><br><br/><br/>
<i>I guess the bottom line is: Stennie isn't going to <a href="http://www.protoworks.com/images/beer.jpg">give back the beer</a>, huh? ;-)</i></p>

<h2>Imager?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Alias/">Alias</a> on 2006-09-07T23:53:51</h3>
I know you need GD.pm, and this probably won't help you much, but I thought I'd just throw out the comment that Imager is much much easier to install on all platforms (I just installed it on Strawberry to confirm).<br><br>If at all possible, I'd highly recommend using Imager for graphics stuff, if it can do what you want.<br><br>But then GD is probably just a dependency for your real need, so odds are for you that comment doesn't help.



<h2>ActiveState is not the only PPM repository</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/SuperCruncher/">SuperCruncher</a> on 2006-09-08T07:48:43</h3>
<i>But the ActiveState build status page says</i> <p>
ActiveState isn't the only PPM repository. There are many of them, for example: <a href="http://theoryx5.uwinnipeg.ca/ppms/" title="uwinnipeg.ca">University of Winnipeg</a uwinnipeg.ca> and <a href="http://www.bribes.org/perl/ppm/" title="bribes.org">Bribes</a bribes.org>, as well as smaller repositories with <a href="http://www.gigi.co.uk/wxperl/" title="gigi.co.uk">PPMs for wxPerl</a gigi.co.uk>. There's a module on CPAN, <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/podmaster/PPM-Repositories-0.11/Repositories.pm" title="cpan.org">PPM::Repositories</a cpan.org> to provide a full list. FWIW, I just installed GD from the Winnipeg repository without any problems.</p><p>

I don't really like the idea of massive Perl distributions including a compiler - I think binary packaging is a better solution, even for *nix operating systems. There's still a long way to go though.</p>

Thanks. I already found that module a while back. Works very well too, I added everything I found.<br>
It's very interesting that you were able to install GD, my ppm should have found it too!<br>
