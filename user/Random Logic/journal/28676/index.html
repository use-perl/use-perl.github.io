<p><p>It's been a while since the last post. But I had to fiddle a little with java around and complete a software project for my studies, which was based on Catalyst.</p>

<p>Catalyst is an elegant, simple, thought through framework for building web applictions following the MVC paradigm. And did I mention it's great?
</p>

After diving in into the concept, using the bundled tool (catalyst.pl) to generate a stub webapp, I had a basic but working webapp by just starting script/myapp_server.pl. <br>
A little more love was required on the model side, by using DBIx::Class (or lets say the Catalyst Helper for DBIC) to create some more stubs, fill in the fields and primary keys and the relation of the tables. Well, and that's it. Added some more functionality to the controller, of which most is already available as a plugin to catalyst. Now I had some basic actions (every request url is mapped to an action, which actually builds your controller), added the session and authentication plugins and had my first login to my new webapp.</p>

<p>Only a little more polished was required to the template toolkit templates to actually have a visibile appealing interface. So the rest of the project we spent our time to add tests, some more actions to the controller and some more model classes. All step by step, simple and fun.</p>

<p>If you haven't heard of Catalyst yet, be sure to check it out at <a href="http://catalyst.perl.org">catalyst.perl.org</a> or join IRC on irc://irc.perl.org/Catalyst.</p></p>
