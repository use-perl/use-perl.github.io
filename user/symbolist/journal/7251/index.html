<p>Every now and then I have too much time on my hands.<P><br/><br/>Yesterday, I thought I'd fire up a search tool and see how many mentions of Perl could be found on news source sites (newswires, etc)<SUP>(1)</SUP>.<P><br/><br/>Here are some of them. I limited the results to those that seemed to have a 2002 publication date. Certainly this can't be all, so I must have missed some. However, I did expect to find more than this.<P><br/><br/>Some are interesting, others are trivial, and a few felt a little insulting in their Perl mentions.<P><br/><br/>I wonder if anyone has any use for this kind of summary. Likewise, I wonder if Perl 6 will catapult Perl back into a larger spotlight.<P><br/><br/>
