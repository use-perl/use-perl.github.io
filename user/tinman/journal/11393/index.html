<p><p>Surprising how many ppl were born in the month of March.. I counted Casey West and Matt Sergeant.. Many happy returns..Hope I didnt miss anyone..
<p>XUL is awesome, neat and lots of other adjectives.. but it can also be rather complicated to get into (probably because I've not been doing anything with CSS or Javascript for a while).. Wading through the Calendar source (which I want to first understand before I try to fix any bugs), there are huge sections that seem like greek to me :D.. Does anyone with any experience contributing code to an OSS project have any advice ? did you try to  understand the entire codebase, or just fasten on a section that you think you can try hacking on and work from there ?
<p>OReilly has a great section on PL/SQL collections <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/network/2003/04/01/feuerstein.html?page=1">here</a>.
Being a programmer who severely underused collections until an year or two back, I think this is a great intro into how collections can be effectively used. Using the hash in Perl and using collections in PL/SQL are so similar that I can use a lot of concepts between languages (which saves figuring out what to do :D) Now if ONLY Oracle forms catches up with all these advances and allows passing collections from database to server *sigh*
<p>We had a fake fire alarm yesterday.. (April Fools, what else).. Fortunately, I remembered which day it was, so I had the chance to look smug and point and laugh at the people who ran out into the street..only to get completely and totally nailed into a fake meeting which never took place (and left me in a boardroom for the best part of half an hour)

<h2>Fake fire alarms?</h2>

Great.  Maybe next April 1 you can all make prank calls to 911, or remove some stop signs.

<p>*grin* maybe it WAS over the top, but I found out later (this is a client site) that they've done this every year for the past 7 years that they've been in operation.. which is why only the new guys get caught each time.</p>
