<p><p>Got a USB pen drive this week.. what a relief to not have to lug around floppies all the while, (yes, I was doing that until very recently).. Now I can finally think about upgrading my home installation to 5.8 and sundry other upgrades that I've been intending to do (but havent had the patience to connect via dialup and download)
<p>I'm fiddling around trying to analyze the source of quite a few PL/SQL packages and stored procedures these days.. Trying to automate an audit of which packages/procs access which tables and so on.. After a few ambitious (and unsuccessful) attempts to write a parser for PL/SQL, I finally settled on the dirty and probably less than accurate regex and index based word matching technique to extract table names..
So far, it seems to catch most of the tricky SQL references.. One thing Oracle wont do is catch any dependencies inside dynamic SQL.. This script, being a string matcher, doesnt care if its dynamic SQL or not..
<p>Started playing War3 again, to prepare for the Frozen Throne expansion pack.. I've had a strange reaction to this game.. At first, I hated it (too slow, somehow not quite right), but the more I play it, the more it seems to have depth that I didnt notice before.. (of course, some of the units are just plain fun to use)
<p>My 7 year old niece is visiting so I've pretty much run through my junk food quota for the entire year, it seems like :) you never miss the McD french fries until you try them after a long hiatus.. :) then you wonder how you managed without them for so long...
<p>Lots of holidays this week, so I re-re-re-read Data Munging (for the parsing job) and also waded through some supermarket bookstore fiction :D not bad.. (junk food for the eyes ;)</p>

I couldn't find anything Doxygen-like capable of SQL, so I've recently done the exact same thing to document one of our Sybase databases. I think the Oracle dialect is similar, and the class for parsing (simple regexes like your approach) TransactSql is easy to use as a starting point for PL/SQL if you want to do some beta testing/extension.<br> <br>(The generated docs are really nice and useful BTW)<br>
