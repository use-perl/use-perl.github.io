<p><p>Yep, I always upgrade to the latest and greatest Fire$ANIMAL when I read the release announcement.
<p>Now the complaints. I <em>hate</em> the installer for Windows XP. Yes, I realize that some people need the installer, but I prefer the plain old download-and-unzip method. Worse still, for some weird reason, the old profile refused to work, so I had to manually sling the bookmarks and form history and signon thingies into the new profile directory. S'all good.
<p>Onto extensions. Open my bookmarks, go to the developer pages and install.Then, the browser refuses to start, but throws a weird XBL error instead. WTF ? Turns out that Tabbrowser extensions are borked. I have anything from 3-5 extensions, all of which I installed within the first few minutes of getting the new version. I didn't know <em>which</em> extension had caused the crash. yikes! Uninstall (bah, stupid installer), reinstall, try them one extension at a time. Figure out it was TBE, uninstall the whole shebang again and install everything else.
<p>Now my whine is that the browser has changed (I have gotten so used to TBE that the context menus and things had been customized). Do the action that I am used to (right click on tab - left click to close the tab) now results in a "new tab" instead :) gah!</p>

<h2>Scrollbars</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/bart/">bart</a> on 2004-02-10T00:59:23</h3>
The major complaint I have after only a few hours of playing, is that half of the time, the scrollbars don't show up, even though the content is too big is too big to fit into the window.
<p>I'm thinking of going back to FireBird 0.70.</p>



<h2>Extensions</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Dom2/">Dom2</a> on 2004-02-10T07:55:17</h3>
To be fair, the <a href="http://mozilla.org/products/firefox/releases/#issues" title="mozilla.org">release notes</a mozilla.org> did warn that extensions might well cause problems.

<p>And whilst you dislike the installer, if it lets people use the flash plugin more easily, I'm all for it...

<p>err..ugh<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) actually, one of my can't-do-without extensions is the click-to-see-flash plugin<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) Most of the flash stuff I see is flashy, irritating advertising. This plugin replaces it with a hyperlink that you have to click.
</p><p>I'd prefer NOT to install flash if I could possibly get away from it<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

In general, I'd agree, but I like to read the <a href="http://b3ta.com/newsletter/" title="b3ta.com">b3ta newsletter</a b3ta.com> each week, which usually has some very good flash stuff in it.

<h2>Not a happy FireBunny!</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ajt/">ajt</a> on 2004-02-10T10:12:52</h3>
<p>I must admit I'm not impressed either.</p>

<p>First off it messed my Mozilla 1.6 profile up, though it did leave my FireBird/Phoenix profiles intact....</p>

<p>I've not been able to download the Linux version at all, the server seems overloaded.</p>

<p>Flash is EVIL! anything that enables it is also EVIL. Actually flash is a fine technology, it's just all the advertisers use it, and I find animation very distracting. I use a ZAP plug-in <a href="http://www.squarefree.com/bookmarklets/zap.html" title="squarefree.com">bookmarklet</a squarefree.com> to control things, and I use the "block images" option with great vigour.</p>

<p>Phoenix/FireBird/FireFox is a fine browser, but I don't think it's significantly smaller or faster than the full Mozilla Browser Suite, and it's missing too many functions. It is getting there, and I have no doubt that it will be a great Mozilla 2.0.</p>
