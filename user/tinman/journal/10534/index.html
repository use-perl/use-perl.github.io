<p><p>fine grained access control works..!! yay. its simply too cool for words.. I can dynamically alter any query, regardless of the application, and do basically anything I want (deny access to all data, show a subset etc) and its all table driven..
<p>Finished Crossroads, I am NOT recommending that book to anyone, even ardent Robert Jordan fans are going to be sickened by it..

<h2>Crossroads</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/dreadpiratepeter/">dreadpiratepeter</a> on 2003-02-13T04:48:53</h3>
* Very Minor Spoler Warning *<br/><br/>
As an "ardent Jordan Fan" I have to say that I was not sickened. Crossroads was well written. It unfortunately lived up to it's name. Jordan needes to move a lot of people across the continent so that they can be where they need to be. He needs to get Mat and Perrin and their respective armies together an marching north.<br/><br/>He needs to set things up for events to come in the towers and camelyn.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, that makes for a book without a huge amount of action. But it was a good read, and I think the next book may be spectacular.<br/><br/>Anyway, it's a lot better than Path of Daggers.<br/><br/>Just my opinion.<br/><br/>Pete<br/><br/>P.S. If you haven't read them yet. George R.R. Martin's series (beginning with The Game OF Thrones) is unbelievable. It's as good as Jordan in it's own way.

<p>Hmm, You're not the first to recommend George R.R. Martin, btw.. just hasnt hit local bookstores yet, and I maxed out the plastic on Amazon last month, need to recover a bit<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:D Any opinion on Terry Goodkind ? (I've read that series, somewhat similar to RJ)
</p><p>The main reason that it annoyed me (Crossroads), was that it was there were NO major events. Path of Daggers, IIRC, was similar, in that sense... things just sorta drifted..
</p><p>Of course, having said all that, I will wait for the next one and buy it *sigh*. I REALLY want to see how it all ends..</p>
