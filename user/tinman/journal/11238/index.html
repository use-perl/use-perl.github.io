<p><p>The neat thing about Oracle forms is that, although its got a clunky and sometimes irritating interface, the things you can do with it are almost without limit (once you figure out how to read the API docs). I know a friend in another company who wrote a couple of forms that render almost exactly like HTML (hyperlinks, linked images).. 
<p>What I did the past few days was convert all the roles and privileges in our schema to be completely table driven. Just add/delete/update a line in a table and any form in the system will automatically enable/disable or hide menu items, hide buttons that the user has no privileges to click.. I knew this was possible, but amount of time it took to complete was really surprising..
<p>So the US has finally launched its offensive, and I spend most of the time at home watching CNN and BBC.. I'm not completely sure I agree with the practice of "embedding" journalists with troops, but I guess that's the kind of war this is going to be.. soundbytes, carefully formatted for TV, to keep the viewership happy and hopefully win over support from the holdouts.. 
<p>Trying to figure out XUL.. Made some headway in it, now I need to figure out an application to write in it (maybe a custom sidebar ?) Unfortunately, I doubt its going to take off until Mozilla is a lot more dominant in the marketplace than it is right now.. which is a real pity.
