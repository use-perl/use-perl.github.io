<p><p>A friend, who works in the same company (but for a different team) has an abusive team lead.. She's been constantly pressured about the amount of work she's doing, even though she pulled 12+ hours a day for the past week or so.. With the commute, that makes it 16 hours or more per work day..
<p>One day, she sounded really upset about things, so I told her to finish up what she can, go home and sleep a normal 8 hours and then come back the next day.. Unfortunately, on her way home, she gets this call from the team lead saying "I thought you were only going out for a while, get back into office, we got a deadline, yadda yadda yadda"..
<p>When I heard, my first instinct would have been to tell the team lead to stuff it (were I her).. :) She didnt react much better, I think.. but is there anything else that could have been done ? I wonder...Unsurprisingly, when she went back the next day, not only was she able to work better (or so I was told), but she actually got less flak too (which sorta confirms that the team lead was simply on a power trip, IMO). Unfortunately, there is no oversight and she and an intern are the only ppl on the team..
<p>Trying to get myself into the morass of standards and confusing jargon that make up web services.. not a happy task. 3-4 solid hours of reading sundry specs from W3C last night left me more confused than when I started.. I am suffering from a bad case of "buzzword-itis" :D 
<p>Interesting story at <a href="http://www.salon.com/tech/feature/2003/03/13/tech_workers/index.html?x">Salon</a> about over-the-top job descriptions..</p>

If after sitting on this you decide to intervene, consider looking up the management chain for a manager who has a clue. Lacking someone with a clue, look for someone greedy and hit them with a "this kind of behavior is costing us money" argument. Greedy people understand money, and if you can catch their attention by suggesting a risk of losing money, you might get a chance to make an argument linking overwork to underperformance, or to the risk of having to replace a performing employee. If they get that link, the smack will come down on the project leader pretty.
<p>
Were I in your position, I wouldn't go after the project leader directly.
