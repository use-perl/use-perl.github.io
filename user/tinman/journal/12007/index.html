<p><p>Obrandom thought: I simply cant get a proper subject for any of these journal entries.. There are too many (unrelated) things in each one..
<p>One favour for your friend, playing IT guy, and the next thing you know, the word spreads :( some lawyer types want "advice" on what to get, what sort of stuff is out there to "computerize" their operations.. its a non-profit, so I decided to help out. The next thing I know, the boss of that place has "referred" me to another place.. and I get a phone call telling me to expect a phone call.. wondering if I should take it or not.. I'll probably get paid (hopefully *grin*), but have I been in the industry long enough to tell people like that what to do ? I myself dont really think so..
<p>W00t!! Got me a mess of Alistair Macleans.. *grins happily* My mealtime + boredom + spare time reading for the next few days has been sorted out.. YAY! Also got a couple of George RR Martin, I think someone recommended him in a comment to one of my journal entries..
<p>One of the top indicators when working conditions at a company are going downhill, they start referring to people as "resources".. and all of a sudden, you start hearing that word thrown about all over the place.. Happened once before, I think I read it a couple of times.. and its started at the place I work in now.. sign of things to come ? Gotta hope York University replies to my application ASAP :)
<p>Is it summer yet ? :) The PostgreSQL crowd promise a native Win32 port in summer.. I've visiting the site frequently, waiting to snap it up when its released..Nothing so far :D</p>
