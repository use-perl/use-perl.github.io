<p><p>Came back from the trip, had the nasty experience of finding out my trusty, ancient P200 had died.. obviously, since there are no components available for machines that old (ok, not strictly true, but...) and since I was tired of not being able to play the latest and greatest games at home, I went out and got myself a P4.. albeit a low end one.. some extra SDRAM, which is available for very low prices, and I was in business..
<p>Of course, its been a week since I got the machine, and I have used it, maybe an hour at most.. *sob*.. at least I can use it to do stuff besides Civ3 (yeah, I wish).. so, when I didnt have a computer at home, all I did was keep wishing for one... now I got it, I'm doing other stuff more than using it.. a walking Aesops fable, that's me..
<p>Oh, and <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/phoenix/releases.html">Phoenix</a> rocks.. installed it for some web testing and was sold, near instantly..I installed a nightly build, at that.. hasnt crashed on me yet.</p>
