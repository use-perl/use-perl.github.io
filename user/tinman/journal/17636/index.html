<p><p>"Be careful what you wish for", my mom said. "you just might get it". Never more true than today..
<p>My first experience with MacOS X (via a Powerbook G4 thingy) was ok. Nice eyecandy, some interesting features on the UI.. but lord have mercy, installing (or trying to install) Apache 2.0 and mod_php for a friend was pure pure torture.
<p>The command line functioned well enough (hey, it's BSD and that doesn't hold any terrors for me), but the slightly strange (to me) directory structure threw me for a loop. (Like: what is Apache2 doing in /Library and /lib both ? do they mean the same thing ? different versions? So which one is the service manager thingy controlling then ? )
<p>After the binary installer for PHP failed (and refused to give any meaningful reason either), I sort of figured that it was going to be a long long installing and fiddle session.So it turned out. Attempts to run the thing as a CGI binary seemed to fail too. Has anyone encountered a problem where the GUI control manager for Apache randomly refuses to start up or shut down? It seemed to happen on a regular basis on this machine.
<p>Oh, well. After a monumental hack-o-rama where I tried lots of different ways to get the whole thing running without resorting to recompiles (and failing), I will rub out Apache and compile everything from scratch tomorrow. What a wasted couple of hours :(</p>
