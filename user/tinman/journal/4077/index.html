<p><p>Yow... decided recently that I needed to get out of the cargo cult coder mentality that I think I'm dropping into.. (had an absolutely hilarious review where I thought I sorta sucked at keeping my Swing frontend bug free, and management turned out to be pretty happy with it.... well, pretty nice for the ego to be told that you're doing a good job when you thought you weren't, heh heh heh)
<p>So, took a corporate copy of "Code complete" home, and borrowed "Rapid development" by the same author from my old uni. library..and read it cover to cover (and am re-re-reading it ;o) Now, I guess I realize lots of stuff I didn't even know I was doing wrong, so that's a good thing... time to try out some of the things in it.. (I LOVE the idea of a daily build/smoke test, for instance)
<p>In other news: a few ppl I know (and yours truly) like the Mozilla feature of tabbed browsing, so I decided to try out the new Mozilla (0.9 ?).. I already use a <a href="http://www.netcaptor.com">tabbed browser</a>, but that's just IE windows with a tabbed interface (think NeoPlanet)..so, I installed and tried it out (P3 700-ish with 256mb of RAM)... flame on, but it was a bit disappointing... it took quite a bit of hard disk churn to switch to Mozilla from another app, the tabbed browsing feature wasn't as intuitive as I'd have wanted (new hotkey, aaargh :o).. so, back to Netcaptor :o)</p>

<h2>One browser to rule them all</h2>

I know I'll have eggs thrown at me for saying this, but I have yet to find a browser that was better than Microsoft's IE.  Yes, they're a monopoly, yes their OS sucks, but their *software* is top notch.
<p><ul>
<li>Netscape (Mozilla) - Slow to load pages, buggy and a memory pig.  At least offer us a version without the mail/news client to save on memory.</li>
<li>Netscape (old) - Horrible font rendering, occasionally crashes (on Solaris anyway).</li>
<li>Opera - Not bad.  Only used on BeOS so I haven't seen latest version.</li>
<li>Galeon - A better version of Mozilla.  Not as slow or buggy, but still a bit slow and buggy.  Mediocre font rendering.  For lack of anything better, this is what I'm using in Linux.</li>
<li>IE - In my own experience it's both the fastest and most stable of all the browsers.  I use it in Solaris as well as Windows.  Has all the bells and whistles, skins, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Undoubtedly I'll get a slew of "IE sucks!" replies, but I find that most people say that because they hate MS, not because there's anything wrong with the browser.</p>

While you're on this roll, you might find Hunt and Thomas's, "The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master" to be to your liking. Lots of small chunks that can be digested individually.<br>
