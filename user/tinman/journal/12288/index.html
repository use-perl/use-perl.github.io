<p><p>and trying hard to keep my temper stable as requirements pour in and no one seems interested in feature triage.. (the general idea is "you can do this, it only takes 2-3 minutes, right ?".. The fact that the team lead and the project manager both seem to be looking the other way is what pisses me off the most.. Aah, well.. this too, shall pass.. but now, I relate to the "disgruntled" employees who trash something before they leave.. I really, really itch to punch something..
<p>Hmm, onto more cheerful stuff.. downloaded Mozilla Firebird (ooh, politically correct I am.. giving the complete name :) downloaded the extensions I use, and just finished tweaking it to match the nightly build I was using earlier.. It rocks, nuff said :) Its also much needed stress relief.. :)
<p>Game of Thrones had a shocking ending :o Yowza.. the scene with Dany was err.. weird, to say the least..</p>

<h2>Impact assessment</h2>

How about sitting down for an hour and do an initial estimate on all new features?<br> <br>"A will take n hours/days, B will take this long. Now, please prioritize these, and the old features, by business value and I'll let you know what the impact on the project and the schedule will be."<br> <br>If the project manager doesn't listen to that, he's simply not doing his job.<br> <br>Put the estimates in writing to make them more tangible and less easy to ignore.<br> <br>This is one of my favourite posts here BTW<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br> <br> <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/petdance/journal/7575" title="perl.org">"Can't you just..." -or- there are no simple obvious answers  </a perl.org>

<p>One sentence, he's not doing his job<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) in his own words, "<i>my module</i> is too hard to understand, so I'm letting the team lead take care of it..". The team lead is swamped with work, because in their wisdom, management hasnt told him to manage the team full time, so he has a lot of development work to do as well..
</p><p>Anyway, I have an email trail doing precisely what you suggest, but then, it still doesnt stop anyone from saying "ok, so if it takes you 1 day, that means if you work extra extra hard, you can finish it in 2 hours ? " and implicitly, the other work can all wait<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) *shrugs*
</p><p>I'm over the mood now.. just doing the work, waiting for an escape<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>
