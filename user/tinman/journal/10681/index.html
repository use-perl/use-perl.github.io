<p><p>I now know why all of the tutorials and articles on Oracle FGAC (or row level security or VPD, whatever you wanna call it) are curiously sketchy on updates and deletes.. As it turns out, there is no way to reliably inform the user that he CAN'T do a certain update (no nice dialog box to popup and say "sorry, no access".. the update just silently fails.. which of course, isnt very nice (or informative) for the user..
<p>Want to try a page which mysteriously crashes every browser I've tried so far ? try visiting www.service-oriented.com (didnt make it a HREF for obvious reasons). Tried it with IE 6, Opera 7 and Pheonix 0.5, similar results on all. The browser simply crashes.. I can only assume its some sort of silly vbscript or javascript or activex abomination on the page. The sad part is, this URL was given to me by a prospective supervisor, as a reference.. Err, now what do I do ? :p (Google cache crashed the browser too, which is REALLY strange, that rules out the javascript theory)
<p>Neat piece of software that I revisited after a while, <a href="http://miranda-icq.sourceforge.net/">Miranda</a>, an ICQ clone that also allows connections to other protocols. The only reason I cant try it out for long is because most of my contacts are on Yahoo and the Yahoo plugin sucks.. (no proxy support, for one).. but the other plugins are marvellous, I really want the Alice plugin *evil grin*.. The win32 port of <a href="http://gaim.sourceforge.net/">Gaim</a> is coming along pretty well too.. </p>

it worked for me (Mozilla 1.3b, win2k).<br> <br>On the other hand, it destroyed the browser for any further use (any other pages, not on that site, came up blank).<br> <br>Weird Java tricks.<br> <br>Doubt it'll crash w3m or lynx though =)

<p>I'd already tried them, and links, before I read your comment. My copy of galleon is also quite happy having viewed the page. But among other things, it has JavaScript turned off, precisely because web browsers (currently) can't sandbox untrusted JavaScript code.</p>
