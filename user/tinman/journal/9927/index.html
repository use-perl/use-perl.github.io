<p><p>Hmm, I've noticed that I seem to be forgetting very trivial everyday things quite often.. ie: a friends phone number, although I have reason to use it frequently, where I left my PDA, stuff like that.. so much so, its starting to get me a bit worried...
<p>C# is neat.. its not neat in the sense of a knock-your-socks-off kinda way, but its got some nice touches.. one Perlish idiom: foreach is in the language.. I was doing some work in office parsing bills for comparison with the database(project for a mobile phone company), I LOVED the look on the face of a hardcore C++ programmer when I explained the idea behind foreach to him :D
<p>Oooh, while I was doing that parsing project, I found a bug (I think), in Perl.. noticed that others in mailing lists had reported it.. but essentially, Storable segfaults with 5.8.0 when a hash with 200k+ keys is written out to disk..(bus error something.. scared the hell out of me when I first got that message.. heh heh).. no, this isnt an error report, was wondering if I should fire up perlbug (was on a Solaris machine), then found other complaints on the same topic..
<p>Am I the only person who is very unhappy with how buggy Winamp 3 is ? I sent a mail to a mailing list that has been setup with some friends and got some surprising results.. MOST of the people who responded had apparently either started using WM9 or gone back to 2.81.. sad state for software which was pretty much a defacto standard for playing mp3s (at least on Win32)</p>
