<p><p>Lots of random snippets and grouses.. quite cathartic, this... :o)
<p><a href="http://www.improvisation.ws/mb/showthread.php?s=&threadid=4475">True stories of a pr0n clerk</a>.. Beware, its probably not work safe (no images, but there is language that won't pass muster with obscenity filters)..Its scary at times, a bit depressing too..
<p>Thinking about Ovid's AI::Prolog module, it reminded me of a language that I tried out on my home machine last week.. Called <a href="http://www.cs.arizona.edu/icon/">Icon</a>, it seems quite C like, but with one *IMHO* crucial difference, you can do goal directed searching, because there is a concept called "failure" for any method call.. Looks neat, and if it means anything, (no, it doesn't, really ;) WinIcon is in v. 9.xx. Why did I try it out ? because its supposed to be quite good for text processing.. 
<p>In the quest for a suitable masters thesis (I want to start next year), I googled my way over to <a href="http://theses.mit.edu/Dienst/UI/2.0/ListYears/1998-2002?authority=">the MIT thesis list</a>..Several hours of reading later, still no closer to finding an idea for a freaking topic (aaargh...).. Hmm, maybe that explains why I haven't kicked off the application process yet.. (*smacks myself on the forehead for putting it off yet again*).. oh, wait; here's why.. Around this time of year, I guess EVERY person who is silly enough to get suckered into lecturing a class of 200+ students wishes there was something that could magically help him mark all the finals answer scripts.. Well, if you know of any such toy, don't hold back, I implore you :o) My spare time for the next fortnight depends on it :)) :))
<p>Stray thought: why do I put so many brackets on the stuff in my journal entries ? I have no idea.. disorganized mind, says my coworker ;o)</p>
