<p><p>I was at the wedding of one of my close friend's brother last evening, and I met a lot of people that I hadn't seen since graduation (wow, almost two years ago)...
<p>There seemed to be a couple of things in common with a lot of us: people were unhappy with the places that they were working in and they had no other place to go..Considering that nearly 90% of our batch got absorbed into the local software outsourcing giant, its not really surprising, I guess... Those folk had their pay cut by 20%, and now, even though the fortunes of the company have turned around dramatically in the last few months, their pay is pretty much static with no chances for a revision any time soon...
<p>Add to that a whole host of new graduates who are sans job at the moment (the campuses are churning out CS graduates at a fair rate these days), and you have a market which has overwhelming supply but no demand...Fortunately, the bigger guys are still surviving, and I moved to one such about 6 months ago... but its depressing, we had just graduated when the dot-com bubble burst and I spent the first year working at a dying dot-com.. (not an experience I recommend to anyone).. We *definitely* missed the dot-com gravy train... (waaaah ;)
<p>Hmmm, well, after that rant about the job situation (which is hardly going to be a surprise to anyone, I know), I found a few awesome tools last week...
<li><a href="http://jdictionary.sourceforge.net/">JDictionary</a>, an excellent dictionary tool with pluggable dictionaries (currently has German with English, which is good for keeping my rusty German upto date)
<li><a href="http://jedit.org>JEdit</a>, a general editor with awesome potential (they do it all with plugins ;o), still not as user friendly as Intellij, but closing in fast, I'd say (and the license cost sure beats the pricey IntelliJ hollow)
<li><a href="http://pws.prserv.net/Fellner/Software/eTR.htm">Toms' eTextReader</a>, a great eText reading software (and I've tried quite a few, ranging from the humble Wordpad to MetaPad and a few other contenders)..Woohoo, now I finally get on with reading "the decline and fall of the roman empire" without falling asleep midway.... (well, maybe ;)

<p>And from the Perl-beginners mailing list, a wonderful link...<a href="http://pleac.sourceforge.net/">PLEAC</a>, a cookbook for lots of languages...</p>
