<p><p>Advantages of being in a university: near unlimited reading material, that you couldnt get your hands on elsewhere... case in point, I saw a copy of Ed Yourdon's <a href="http://www.book.nu/0130146595">Death March</a> book. Its been out of print for a while, so I was pretty glad to read it. About three chapters into it now.
<p>Oooh, the Badger book is out. Next demonstration paycheck is going to be spent at Amazon ;)
</p>

<h2>Demonstration paycheck?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jordan/">jordan</a> on 2004-01-10T18:40:00</h3>
Excuse my ignorance, but what's a "demonstration paycheck"?<br> <p>I guess I don't feel bad for not knowing, really, as of 1839 UTC 1/10/24 <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;q=%22demonstration+paycheck%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search" title="google.com">Google turned up no hits whatsoever for it</a google.com>, although I expect the spider will be around to pick up a few here soon...<br> </p><p>I would have thought that some web page would have had some odd reference to it... like "I get a paycheck for each new product I demonstrate, each demonstration paycheck is accompanied by a note which explains the current withholding policy." or something... but no hits at all, weird...</p>

<p> <i>grins widely...</i>It's my contorted english, sorry.
</p><p>I demonstrate various subjects in university here (basically hang around the labs for a few hours a week and help undergraduates out if they get stuck).. its one way for a research student to pick up some extra cash for goodies. Each session that you demonstrate yields a bit of cash, which I put into things I might not have gotten otherwise.. like books I always wanted to read or a treat of some sort<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...
</p><p> <i>rant mode on</i> Bah, I would have spent most of it at the <a href="http://www.apple.com/uk/" title="apple.com">Apple Store</a apple.com>, but the price of an iPod mini is a bit too rich for my blood. Yes, I am still whining about it, ignore me. <i>rant mode off</i></p>

Are you sure it's out of print? I bought Death March from Amazon UK (I think it was) a couple of weeks ago.

<p>Darn, you're right.. *shocked* Where did I remember seeing it out of print ? (oh, yeah.. last year, when I was looking to buy it)
</p><p>Curiously, Google pointed me to an Amazon page (http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/tg/stores/detail/-/books/013143635X/review<nobr>s<wbr></nobr> <nobr> <wbr></nobr>/026-6460583-7315630) that promises a paperback edition end of this month.. nice. (the version I'm wading through didnt have XP or Agile stuff).</p>
