<p><p>Hot air from the management *cynical grin* and gale force (almost) winds last night.. Went home at around midnight, that has to be one of the dumbest things I've done todate.. because the drive is through lots of roads with old old trees lining both sides..
<p>Places I passed last night/this morning had subsequently had trees topple onto the road.. Went home, there was a power outage, but shockingly, power was restored by the time I woke up..So had time for a quick game of Warcraft before I came back to work..
<p>Hmm, needed to install Data::Random on my Win32 machine to rerun a program I wrote ages ago.. only, PPM informed me that Data::Random is not available for Win32 (only avalable for Solaris now, WHY ? ).. (this is 5.6).. Fortunately, hacking together a series of 12 digit random numbers isnt that hard..<br> 
<i>Memo to self: either upgrade to 5.8 or dont rely on a module being available in the 5.6 archives anymore..</i>
<p>Of course, its a pure perl module, so just copying would have worked too (I was near panic, and didnt stop to figure that one out)
<p>Started reading George R.R. Martin's Game of Thrones: its quite interesting. Thanks to whoever suggested I should read it, he's probably not an author I would have discovered on my own.. (now, if I could only get an electronic copy for my PDA.. :) The Alistair MacLeans, as usual, were fantastic.. only, I've remembered what I thought the first time I read them, he only has about 5-6 basic stories, its how he tells them thats unique :) He has,
<ul>
<li>sea stories with the first mate or someone similar taking charge (<i>South by Java Head, Golden Rendezvous, Black Shrike</i>)
<li>The unlikely bunch of commandos on an impossible mission (<i>Where Eagles dare, Guns of Navarone, Force 10 from Navarone </i>)
<li>The superman agent (<i>The road to dusty death, Puppet on a chain, Athabasca</i>)
<li>The double agent (<i>The Satan bug</i>)
