<p><p>Yep, another refugee from Internet Explorer has finally found THE browser :D
<p>Didnt really think that Phoenix was completely ready to supplant IE (seemed to take a bit more memory, seemed a bit slower to render pages etc etc), but having downloaded 0.5, it works like a charm..Several hours of tweaks later, I have radial context menus, advanced preferences and advanced tab browsing.. some sites seem to render their fonts weirdly, yes, even use.perl at first... a few adjustments to preferences, a change of the proxy URL to my local Privoxy, and I am all set.. whee..
<p>This week is weird, for working. Wednesday was a holiday, and Friday will be one as well. Not really wanting to blow my annual leave in January, I actually showed up for work today; unfortunately, this was after playing Warcraft until about 0300 or so the night before..with fairly predictable productivity this morning..
<p>Experimenting with the Activestate plugin for .NET these days.. not really sure if I want to have Perl produce MSIL bytecode, really.. but it seemed a nice thing to try out :D
<p>Finished reading <a href="http://www.fpp.co.uk/books/index.html">The rise and fall of the Luftwaffe</a> yesterday... coincides nicely with my getting a copy of Battlefield 1942 ;)
<p>Oh, and a friend pointed me to some interesting research topics at the university of Kent..*sigh* I suppose I cant put off applying any longer..</p>
