<p><p>Two separate notes, for the price of one.
<p>I decided to try the Perl testing frameworks with  one of my scripts which badly needed refactoring. I wanted to move the messy textfile configuration into a SQLite database and make some general cleanups and speedups.
<p>Read Test::More, it seemed like overkill, so went into Test::Simple. What the ?! It wants you to test a module ? the hell you say. This isn't a module, this is a <i>script</i>.I want to test the different subroutines, to make sure they're passing tests. Err.. you can't do that ? How strange. Is testing only for module authors or am I missing something ? What's Mr. Hack-A-Lot, who's never done test driven development using Perl, and doesn't want to write a module to replace his script, supposed to do ?
<p>The other note: if I didn't know about not designing and coding before inspecting the data, I do now. Tried to make a mapping table, used a HashMap. Then I look at the actual data and discover that some fonts actually represent the <i>same</i> character in different ways, depending on how it's used. So, one unicode character can be two separate character values in a custom font. That pretty much puts my HashMap idea into the dustbin, where it belongs. I can't keep track of the context without using a different structure.</p>

<h2>Testing Scripts</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/chromatic/">chromatic</a> on 2004-04-13T15:44:59</h3>
<p>You have several options.  I usually prefer to turn scripts into modules, because that's just me -- I find it leads me to better designs.</p>

<p>Another option is to put a <code>caller()</code> block at the top of your script, so you'll execute the main subroutine only if called directly.  That'll let you <code>require</code> the script from a test script.</p>

<p>You could put the test code in the script and run it based on the presence of a command-line or environment variable.</p>

<p>You could treat the whole script as a black box, opening it in a separate process, giving it known input, and checking the output.</p>

<p>Those are in order of my preference.</p>



<h2>Testing Scripts</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/cbrandtbuffalo/">cbrandtbuffalo</a> on 2004-04-13T16:15:48</h3>
When I run into this, I usually pull the subs out of the main script and put them in a separate library file. Then you can require the library in the script and write a test script that can require it as well. Plus, as a bonus, you can now use the subs from other scripts. This is hard to do if your subs are using global variables, though.
