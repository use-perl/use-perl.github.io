<p><p>Call it reliving my childhood or whatever, but for the past couple of months, I've been busy setting up a small freshwater fish tank in my bedroom.. Its not very large, as tanks go, just large enough to fit in a shelf of my bookcase..
<p>The first colonization of the tank was an unmitigated disaster..having more money than sense, I went out and bought more fish than would fit into the tank (I think), or maybe it was something that is mysteriously called "new tank syndrome", but whatever the reason, my fishie population was decimated within a month.. I still don't know why..
<p>Ok, so for about a month and a half afterwards, a lone Siamese fighter (<i>Betta splendens</i>) inhabited the tank... then last week, I plucked up enough courage to try again, and went off to the pet shop.. this time around, MORE goldfish (yes, the tank is small, but goldfish look very cheerful and happy all the time), and some female fighters to keep the lone male company.. (a regular harem ;)
<p>Now; I want a larger tank (yes, for more fish, of course), but I don't have the space for it..
<p>Incidentally, I know lots of ppl say that you should have a tank with fish swimming around as a stress reliever, but frankly, I think seeing them floating belly-up in the morning (you know what I mean, don't make me say it ;o) is worse than any possible gains.. so I still don't know why I'm doing it, but its fun, all the same</p>
