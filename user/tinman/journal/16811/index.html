<p><p>I am ashamed to admit it in this day and age, but I have not "driven" a Mac machine. Not once. never. Yes, I've known people who loved them, used nothing but MacOS, swore by it.. but I have never even been remotely interested in seeing for myself what makes it so special ... until now.
<p>Maybe its all Pudge's fault for demonstrating cute AppleScript tricks (VBScript and its cousins seem somehow scriptkiddish ? dont flame me for my prejudices :), maybe its how many people seem to be using it as a development platform these days.. I just dont know.
<p>But I cornered the only Prof in the department who uses Mac (and has a dual G5) and asked for a test drive. Now, if this were a review (or a nice bedtime story), I would be enthralled with its power and usability and I would become an instant convert, right ?
<p>Wrong. He told me he uses the department x86 machine here and uses the G5 at home! Rats!! Thwarted again! :) but he did promise that he would probably be bringing it over to the department sometime in the summer :) which just goes to show, out of the 100+ people in CS, only 1 person that I know of owns a Mac. I actually thought there would be more ... disappointed.</p>

When I was in college, I got a job supporting the university computer labs.  They were all PowerMac 7200's.  They struck me as being nice because they were simple to support.  They were adequate.  I didn't want one because I wanted bash, gcc, and other things that were a hassle to use on MacOS 7.<br> <br>At a later job, doing tech support and repairs for walk-in customers, I came to see how much more intuitive users really found MacOS.  It was also easier to repair in a pinch, because the number of possible problems seemed smaller, because it didn't lend itself to being mucked about in so much.  (Mostly that was a perception issue.)  I still didn't want one.  MacOS 8 had added some bells and whistles, but it wasn't Linux, and I PPC-GNU/Linux wasn't x86-GNU/Linux.<br> <br>I forgot about Macs, kept running Slackware at home, got a job coding for OS/2 and Win32 machines, and every once in a while thought, "That MacOS X thing sounds like it'll be neat."  Then I played with it, and thought, "Wow."<br> <br>Then I played with 10.2, and thought, "I need this."  So I bought a PowerBook.  It is the best computer I've ever owned, without a single doubt in my mind.  With 10.3, it's a beautiful interface to a unixy system, complete with Perl, Vim, all manner of little admin widgets, slick end-user apps, and is equally impressive to wizards and muggles alike.<br> <br>Yes, I'm a zealot.  Don't let that guy forget to bring the G5 in.  It may change the way you work.
