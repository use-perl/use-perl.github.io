<p><p>The upside: faster internet link, not so many ports blocked (IRC, for example)
the downside, the proxy cant retain a connection for more than a few minutes so I get logged in and out of IM services, which pisses off everyone who has me in their contact list..
<p>Was bored yesterday, so fired up my Visual Studio .Net copy and tried to make a RTF file reader. The basic parts of it were pretty simple, took less than 20 minutes (most of it was point and click stuff anyway), then I sorta jumped into implementing Mozilla's ultra cool typeahead find for this viewer. Figuring out timers took a while though, and I still dont know why it randomly fails to capture all the characters.. (although MSDN warns that timers arent as reliable as they could be..)
<p>Postgres for Win32 works ok.. I have a couple of multi million tuple databases running and with some complex queries, the database still performs quite well. Not as fast as MySQL, but for a beta, its all that I could ask for.. now, when the final is released, hopefully all I need to do is a pg_dump and pg_restore.. *crosses fingers* pgPL/SQL looks sorta strange to a diehard PL/SQL programmer, though.. (just looked at the docs so far)
<p>finished the RR Martins, started on Lustbader, a friend lent me Google hacks, which I want to start reading tonight, and still playing/practicing Warcraft 3.. :)</p>
