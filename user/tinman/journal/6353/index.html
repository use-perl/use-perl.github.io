<p><p>The summary of the intervening days/weeks/months (yikes!) since my last journal entry...
<p>Alternately busy doing Oracle forms stuff and jobless (when a component is released, you get a few days to cleanup and potter around office doing nothing much in particular), discovered ancient (I mean pre-1998) games, became totally enthralled with Civilization (yeah, the first one), and have spent countless hours sucking really really bad at it, finished up my lectures at the local university for the semester, and finally (!!) got 4 project students off my hands (they submitted their projects and had vivas)
<p>But more about Civ (yup, as usual with me, I have ALL the enthusiasm of a new convert), I'm scouring the local software places for a copy of Civ 2 (I want to play them in order, call me obsessive), but no one seems to be interested in old games!! All the junk they had on offer seemed to be variations of shoot em ups, with INSANE graphics and CPU requirements.. (Yeah, I REALLY need to play Unreal clone XXX again, no thanks :p).. Lotsa interest in the <a href="http://www.freeciv.org>FreeCiv</a> project, but I'd probably have a minor (or not so minor) revolt at home if I got rid of Windows and Office 2k and installed Linux..
<p>Now what do I do ?</p>

<p>Freeciv <a href="http://www.freeciv.org/windows/" title="freeciv.org">works on Windows</a freeciv.org>.  Aren't you happy, now?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<p>I've had a couple of great Freeciv cross platform LAN parties involving Debian, RedHat, and multiple versions of Windows.  Make a universal install CD you can give to people when they arrive, including the Windows version (don't forget an unzip utility in case they don't have one, and don't screw up like me and include an unzip that doesn't handle long filenames), the source code, and maybe the GTK/Glib sources in case somebody actually doesn't have them installed.  And plan on having people at your house until a very late hour, because Freeciv games are LONG.</p>

<p>Oh, and despite what people say about the isometric tiles, I still think the trident tileset is better.  You can start it with <code>civclient --tiles=trident</code>.  You can even kill your client in the middle of the game and start a new one to switch, because the server will handle clients that disappear and return.</p>

<p>Wheee...<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:o) late hour, no problem, we used to play Quake from 1800 to about 0700 in the morning (with plenty of breaks in between for food<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:o)
</p><p>I thought I saw the link, but I probably downloaded the wrong client (the one that requires an X server).. At least I know its possible now<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:o) yay!!<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:o) (yes, I'm happy now, thank you<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:D)
</p><p>Aah, on the subject of LAN parties, there was one time when a friend brought a laptop over, we were bored, didn't have serial links.. so this guy, being an ingenious bloke, actually took a network cable off the cable modem, took a kitchen knife, and *converted* the darn thing to work as a serial cable... YOW! (why didn't we go and buy something, you ask.. well, it was past midnight when we started<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;o) and he had a plane to catch the following morning)..
</p><p>In the meantime, I found <a href="http://c-evo.org/" title="c-evo.org">Civ Evolution</a c-evo.org> yesterday, which seems to be pretty close..</p>

<p>Just to clarify, there is in fact another Windows client that does not require X.</p>
