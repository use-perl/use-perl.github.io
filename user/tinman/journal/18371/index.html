<p><p>I didn't reply to the comments I got to my earlier journal entry, but thank you <b>cbrandtbuffalo</b> and <b>chromatic</b>. I eventually ripped out the subs as suggested, simply because I badly wanted the speed increase the refactoring would have given me. I hope to try out <i>caller</i> (hadn't heard of it before) and eventually make it a module. It's habit, I guess. It's second nature to run JUnit tests for me now, but I still hesitate (or rather, put off) running unit tests for Perl code. As an aside, I also went *<b>whoa, <i>the</i> chromatic replied my post</b> *goggle eyed*
<p>I'm an idjit, my copy of Data Munging is back home and I never thought to bring it with me. It's got a nifty chapter on Parse::RecDescent and I think I am finally ready to really grok what davorg is trying to say. Spent much of the last week trying to wrap my brain around Antlr and JavaCC to solve a lingustics problem. I didn't succeed, but I experimented enough to understand <i>why</i> I didn't; which is good enough for me.</p>

<p>Actually, just <em>a</em> chromatic.  I come in <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?DouglasAdamsQuotes" title="c2.com">six-packs</a c2.com> now!</p>

It's funny how all of us turn out to be just plain ol' people.  I think of all the Perl luminaries who I've met and realize that they're just the same as me.  I'm still kind of weirded out at being vaguely luminary, like when I'm described as being

<p>Yes, I think I'm still getting used to the idea. My initial foray into a public Perl forum was lurking on comp.lang.perl.misc, you see..
</p><p>I didn't post much (maybe not at all), but some of the people there in those days certainly displayed a slight<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... attitude, if you like. Justified or not, I don't know. But to me, it was quite intimidating, and I've never really gotten over my "oh,wow.." when someone who is noted in the Perl community replies.</p>
