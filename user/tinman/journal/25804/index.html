<p><p>It's probably old news by now.. but Greasemonkey has serious, potentially fatal security flaws. The dev blog entry is <a href="http://greaseblog.blogspot.com/2005/07/mandatory-greasemonkey-update.html">here</a>.
</p>

<p>Having said that though, it's still possible (although not recommended, certainly) to use the old Greasemonkey safely. If a script isn't injected into a page, it can't be exploited. So, making sure scripts <b>only</b> execute on explicitly added pages (instead of using wildcarded includes) is one option.</p>

<p>Another, more obvious option is to install the update. And live without the fancy gm_ namespaced functions for a while.</p>

<p>Unless the specific sites that I use Greasemonkey for are compromised, I think I'm fairly safe. Famous last words? Maybe</p></p>

<h2>NoScript</h2>

The <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/extensions/moreinfo.php?id=722&amp;application=firefox" title="mozilla.org">NoScript</a mozilla.org> extension disables Javascript, unless you specifically allow it, per domain. That does include Greasemonkey scripts.<br><br>I'm not entirely sure whether that's a good or a bad thing, though.

<p>I use it, and it's a good thing, except for the infrequent times when NoScript crashes Firefox.  I hope those will go away in a future update.</p>

<p>NoScript is actually pretty nifty<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) I installed it once the fuss about GM security broke. The whitelisting was a bit tedious, but it seems to work.</p>

<p>I think the problem that was raised on the GM list was that it just allows (or disallows) Javascript. Malicious Javascript could be inserted into a page via some hackery and it would be allowed. This, at least, was the theory and so people were recommended not to use Noscript to cover up GM security flaws<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>
