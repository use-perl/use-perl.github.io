<p><p>So I switched from departmental sponsored CVS versioning to my own Subversion repository. It's not bad.
<p>I've given it a moderate workout so far. Created repositories with the command-line (for some reason, the otherwise excellent <a href="http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/">Tortoise SVN</a> was a bit unintuitive), added some source trees. So far, so good. I haven't used any features that make it wonderfully better than CVS, but my requirements from a versioning system are pretty modest anyway, so I don't expect a radical change in how I manage things
<p>Also added my documents directory, and took a leap of faith by checking in the half done thesis proposal into it. No mishaps so far :) Although I use CVS/Subversion on binaries just to keep track of the revision count. AFAIK binaries don't get accurate diff. Now, if I only figure out a good WSIWYG Tex Editor, I can abandon MS-Word/RTF forever :)</p>

<h2>Deleting: weird</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jplindstrom/">jplindstrom</a> on 2004-04-09T21:48:45</h3>
I'm also trying out Subversion.<br> <br>One thing that bit me was deleting a file.<br> <br>It seems like you need to first Delete the file, then Commit the changes on that file.<br> <br>I guess it seemed weird to me to commit a deleted file since it was removed already at the first stage.<br> <br>Or maybe if it's just me.

<p>I didn't mind that, because from how I understood it, deleting is also an action, just like updating. If you don't like that change, you just rollback. It seemed more natural to me(more database like)
</p><p>Kind of like "send to recycle bin" and "shift-delete" if you like.
</p><p>I generally have fun trying to organize my repositories. Wondering if I should have a separate one for documents together with one for my source trees. Something like WinCVS would be handy too<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) but that's wishing for a lot</p>

Given the right mindset, it's logical, yes.<br> <br>I'm probably damaged by SourceSafe, wherein you can't delete a file twice, unless you destroy the file first, which you can't because you don't have the access rights...<br> <br>*sigh*

<p>Neat.. I hadn't actually. I was trying out <a href="http://www.tex-tools.de/main.html" title="tex-tools.de">WinTex</a tex-tools.de>.Will give it a shot, thanks.</p>
