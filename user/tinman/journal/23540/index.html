<p><p>I've discovered a few things (quirks, if you will) about Ubuntu and laptops. I've just taken the plunge and added the Debian unstable repositories. So now my distro is a weird hybrid of Ubuntu and Debian/SID.

<p>The newer ACPI tools and acpid fix some of the problems with monitoring, but on the whole, acpi is pretty much a dead beastie. For a laptop, that's not particularly good news, since I don't get any battery alerts and have to count the hours/minutes since I booted (or have the laptop suddenly shut down with no warning). 

<p>For some inexplicable reason, wireless refuses to work in Linux. Well, no. Let me qualify that. Wireless works, just that put in a WEP key of <i>any</i> size and it won't work. I've tried most of the standard fiddling with iwconfig and cousins, even edited the network interfaces, but nope. Encrypted wlan is a no-no.

<p>Hmm. What else. The new XFCE 4.2 is tasty. But it won't run properly on the standard Ubuntu. Cardbus services seem to be a on again off again proposition. if I auto eth0, it takes nearly a minute to figure out a DHCP address, so I've resorted to leaving it off and explicitly turning on networking when I need it. Not very convenient, but considering how many times I boot to and fro, it's a timesaver. Upgrading to kernel 2.6.10 borked my soundcard and I haven't figured out why yet.

<p>Remind me why I'm going through all this instead of running a perfectly reasonable Windows XP ? Because even with all of the hassle, I'm still ... somehow ... more productive on the Linux bootup than I am on Windows. I suspect that upgrading my command shell to something like <a href="http://www.jpsoft.com">4NT</a> might solve a few of the Windows woes, though. Am I just <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0672326140/qid=1110230398/sr=8-1/ref=pd_csp_1/102-2909144-2528126?v=glance&s=books&n=507846">an apologist</a> ? Someone who applauds the dancing bear routine? Maybe.</p>
