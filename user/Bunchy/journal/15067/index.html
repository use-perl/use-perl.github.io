i hate him
i hate him so much
what else is there to say
no other feelings are really relevent, you kno, just the fact that  he kissed another girl
not even a pretty girl, just some random girl
IN FRONT OF SMEEJ
he tried so hard to hurt me, yet he claims he cares sooo much blah blah blah blah blah yea thats bullshit you dont do that to people you care about
and how random is this? i am just worried youll hookup with some senior at those parties and what not? who is this bastard? tellin me he doesnt trust ME?yet only hours later guess whos got their arms around MOLE WOMAN  yes my boyfriend, and you as angry as i am, i will never tell him that i hate him and desparately wish to shove his head in a blender and you wanna kno why??<br/><br/>cuz i feel GUILTY
like somehow,inadvertenly, by Me being TOO stressed out and needing a break from the only thing i figured was safe enough and strong enough to handle break...well boo frickin hoo for me cuz i shouldve known that wouldnt work out...so me, the one who is soooo worried about hurting HIM, is sitting in my crying all night and thinking im the worst person in the world next to hitler, and boujie, there he goes kisses some other girl cuz he feels that im not in ENOUGH PAIN...pshhh, <br/><br/>i cant handle it, cuz there he is, all "i dont want what we had to end on such a bad note" yada yada yada, i didnt say i wanted it to end dipshit, and yet after apologizing more times than OJ i thought got the general idea that i regretted asking to "take a break" (that phrase...kill that phrase...what does it mean anyway...stupid stupid) so wouldnt that mean that i no longer wanted to "take a break" but nooooo HE doesnt quite "gettit" and the fact of the matter is, despite me saying I WOULD FORGIVE HIM for the sake of saving him from any more pain (see i try not to hurt him, while hes trying to do the opposite to me, drat) i, the stupid girl that i am<br/><br/>WILL NOT FORGIVE HIM<br/><br/>IF ONLY THE WORLD LIVED BY SMEEJS RULES...THEN THIS WOULD NOT BOTHER ME</p>
