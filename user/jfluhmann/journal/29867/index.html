<p><p>I finally got the OK from my department to register for YAPC!  I'm registered and staying on the IIT campus (MSV).  The final detail is to have the person in our department who handles flight booking to book my flight.  It was either done today, or will be done Monday.  I worked the numbers to get them as low as possible for approval.  It still came out to $700.  The flight alone was over $300, but that was due to booking so late (it was $200 just a week ago).  I proposed attending the conference back in May, but the powers that be told me to wait.  I'm just happy that I'm getting to go.</p>

<p>If you're reading this, I hope you're going so we can meet.  Maybe I'll buy you a beer (or get you to buy me a beer!).</p>

<p>I just wanted to share my good news.  See you in Chicago!!</p></p>

Glad to see that you are getting to come to Chicago!  Locating beer for giving or consuming is not a problem here<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)  We just had an article in the paper about people having too many opportunities to drink.   Too many?  WTF?

<p>Too many opportunities to drink?  Once they start selling beer in taxis, then maybe, just maybe that will constitute "too many opportunities" (but probably not even then).</p>

<p>Yep, I just found out that my flight has been booked and the rental car to get to the airport (and to get back home) is being booked.  I just need to get some sort of luggage now.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)</p>
