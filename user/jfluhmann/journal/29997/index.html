<p>With YAPC::NA being only 4d 20h 34m 33s away, I'm getting pretty anxious (and excited).  I have everything set for travel minus needing to purchase a CTA visitor pass at O'Hare.  Now I have to start getting my things ready to go.<br/><br/>I need to buy luggage for the trip (1 piece should be fine).  Since I'll be sampling in the BeersOfTheWorldBOF, I need to see about packing some beer.  I'm a little curious as to how this will play out at the airport.  Will I be asked to step out of line?  Maybe, maybe not.  I just hope the pilot doesn't drink all my beer!  And speaking of beer, it appears that IIT has beer in their cafeteria!  Breakfast just got a little better! ;-)<br/><br/>I'm arriving on Sunday and attending one of the dinners as well as doing some post arrival activities.  Did I mention I'm excited?<br/><br/>I'm supposed to be getting some information from the Chicago Transit Authority in the mail.  Let's hope it comes in the next few days.  Riding the 'el' will be a new experience for me.  I hope I don't get confused and end up who knows where.<br/><br/>I'm trying to work out my schedule for attending talks.  I have a few spots where I need to make a decision, but I figure I can get a copy of the presentations that I miss after YAPC.  I'm also trying to organize everything that I'll be taking with me.  I'm having to leave my wife and daughter behind for the 4-days I'll be gone.  It's going to be tough, but I think my wife is getting the worse end of the deal.  I'll try to make it up to her, though.  I hope my cell phone plan has out-of-state minutes!<br/><br/>We have company coming on Saturday and my plane leaves mid-day Sunday, so that only gives me 2 1/2 days left to get the house ready for Saturday and myself ready for Sunday.  <br/><br/>So much to do, so little time!</p>
