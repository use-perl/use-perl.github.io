<p><p>Sponsorship hasn't come in like I had anticipated for the <a href="http://www.texasoss.org/">Open Source Symposium</a>.  If something doesn't happen soon, it looks like I'll be sponsoring the conference out of my own pocket.  It's not too bad, only a couple thousand $$, but that's not how I'd like to spend that money.</p>
<p>I took a gamble on making the cost free for attendees with the expectation of getting enough sponsorship money to cover the costs.  So far it's a bad move.  I'll likely mark the 'free' price as early bird, and change it to $10 to recover at least some of the costs.  I have a $100 'Advocate' sponsorship level that attendees (or anyone for that matter) can buy.  It was suggested that I put some wording up next to the 'Cost: FREE', encouraging people to donate to the conference in lieu of a registration fee.  Hopefully that will generate a little more sponsorship, as well</p>
<p>I wanted to make the attendee cost free since San Angelo is a somewhat remote, small 100,000 population town in West Texas.  I thought making it free would get a larger crowd.  That part has paid off somewhat like expected.  Now if I can just find a few thousand dollars burning holes in sponsors pockets :-)</p></p>
