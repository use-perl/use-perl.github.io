<p><p>Now that I'm done with this year's YAPC::NA, I finally have some free time again!  Of course, I can't NOT stay busy.  During the post-yapc hackathon, I spoke with a particular person about a possible hackathon or Perl workshop in the near future.  It would either be in Dallas or Austin.  I'm not sure of the level of involvement that I'll get to have with helping organize, but I'm hoping it's at least some.</p>
<p>Now that I have some free time, I'm able to re-focus efforts on getting the PM group going here in San Angelo.  I have things setup, I just need to get a meeting together and start generating more interest.  I'm also trying to get back into some hobby web development.  My current job role doesn't involve much Perl, other than tools I may write to help do my job, so I'm looking for something that I can work on to keep me writing Perl.  I keep going back to jobs.perl.org to peruse the part-time jobs, but I'm not really looking for the extra money.  I don't know if I would want that kind of commitment.  Before bidding to host YAPC::NA, I was trying to volunteer to help Robert and Ask with some of their stuff, but after winning the bid, all of my energy and time focused on organizing yapc.  Since starting my new job in January, I've decided that I miss doing web development.  I had hoped that I would have more time at yapc to talk with people and get ideas for (or get involved with) a project, but my time was spread thin.  I had more time during the hackathon, but several people had already headed back home.  Hopefully, I'll come across a need or find a project with which to get involved.  Until then, I'll keep doing what I'm doing. :-)</p>
