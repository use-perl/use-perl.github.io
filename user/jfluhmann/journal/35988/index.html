<div class="span8">
<p><p>Welcome, once again, to the Yet Another Perl Conference, North America Call For Venue!  The 2009 <span class="caps">YAPC</span>::NA marks the 10th anniversary for <span class="caps">YAPC. </span> Wow, 10 years of <span class="caps">YAPC</span>!  This year we've decided to try something a little different.  After some discussion and feedback, we've decided to take an approach similar to <span class="caps">YAPC</span>::EU.  We're putting out the request for bids now, with a June 1 deadline.  This gives the Conferences Committee time to review the bids and make a decision to be announced at this year's <span class="caps">YAPC</span>::NA in Chicago.</p>

<p>Some of the main reasons for making the change include:</p>


<ul>
<li>giving the organizers more time</li>
<li>they can gain some exposure and experience with the current year's group</li>
<li>easier to publicize and start spreading the word with everyone in the same room</li>
</ul>



<p>How do you get started?  Please review the <a href="http://yapc.org/yapcna.html">bidding details</a> at yapc.org.  While there, you'll also find links to the <a href="http://tpf.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/yapc/Bidding.pm">venue requirements</a> and the <a href="http://yapc.org/yapc-crit.txt">review criteria</a>.  Previous bids and announcements can be found with the <a href="http://news.perlfoundation.org/mt/mt-search.cgi?tag=yapc">'yapc' tag</a> at <a href="http://news.perlfoundation.org/">The Perl Foundation blog</a>.</p>

<p>When making your proposal, in addition to venue information and possible dates, please make sure to include details on airport locations, local public transit (as well as transit to the venue from the airport!), local cultural attractions, and accommodation information. The more information you provide, within reason, the better.  Also, please include contact information for the members of your team.</p>

<p>With a June 1st deadline, you have 10 weeks to get your bid completed and submitted to the Conferences Committee.  It's a good idea to get your bid submitted early so that we can provide some feedback and allow you to make changes if needed.</p>

<p>Hosting <span class="caps">YAPC </span>is a rewarding experience and provides a great opportunity to give back to the Perl community.  Good luck and we look forward to receiving your bid!</p>

<p>Send any questions and completed bids to the <span class="caps">TPF </span>conferences group: tpf-conferences (at) perl (dot) org</p>
