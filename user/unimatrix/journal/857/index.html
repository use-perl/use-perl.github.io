Aspect-oriented Programming comes to Perl.

</p><p>

I've uploaded an alpha distribution to CPAN, and it's also available
from <a
href="http://codewerk.unixbeard.net/aspects/Aspect-0.04.tar.gz">http://codewerk.unixbeard.net/aspects/Aspect-0.04.tar.gz</a>.
There is a "perl-aspects" mailing list at <a
href="http://www.astray.com/mailman/listinfo/perl-aspects">http://www.astray.com/mailman/listinfo/perl-aspects</a>.

</p><p>

What is Aspect-oriented Programming?

</p><p>

Aspect-oriented Programming (AOP) is a programming methodology
developed by Xerox PARC. The basic idea is that in complex class
systems there are certain aspects or behaviors that cannot normally
be expressed in a coherent, concise and precise way. One example
of such aspects are design patterns, which combine various kinds
of classes to produce a common type of behavior.

</p><p>

Another such aspect concerns debugging or tracing the flow of
execution. Maybe every time one of a set of subroutines is entered
or exited, you want to want to print a line telling you so. Normally
you would you the good old 'print' statement debugger, or maybe
you would actually use a custom Perl debugger or a C<Devel::*>
module.  But what if the profile produces too much output you're
not actually interested in? And a custom debugger usually does not
make for reusable, easily customizable code.

</p><p>

You might change the source of all those subroutines you're interested
in to print the desired information. When you are done debugging,
you remove the print statements again. That's a lot of effort and
can lead to bugs and oversights of its own. Furthermore, your code
is littered with unsightly print statements. If you want to change
the output, you have to change every print statement. If you add
a class, remember to add the print statements. It's a mess. Wouldn't
it be easier if you could influence the behavior of those subroutines
from the outside, like a switch you could flip to make them print
a statement when they're entered (in a consistent way, without
chance of forgetting to create or remove a print statement), then
flip the switch again to turn that behavior off?

</p><p>

That's what aspect-oriented programming is about. Aspects usually
concern many classes right across the class hierarchy. One says
that they "crosscut the program structure" and refers to them as
"crosscutting concerns".

</p><p>

Just like object-oriented programming (OOP) encapsulates the concepts
and functionality of individual classes and arranges them in a
class hierarchy, so does AOP encapsulate the concerns of many
classes and make those aspects or behvaviors reusable. In this way
AOP is orthogonal to OOP.

</p><p>

Aspects allow you to change the interaction of objects without
breaking their encapsulation. You don't change the behaviors of
the objects per se, but rather the way they behave at the seams,
at well-defined points during execution. For example, you can
intercept method calls, override methods, influence operators, and
generally influence the flow of execution in a way that isn't
possible without AOP.

</p><p>

Certainly you can achieve all these things without AOP, but it
would be a lot harder, less (or, more likely, not at all) reusable
and more error-prone. Just as you can simulate any object-oriented
program using non-OO techniques, but OO makes things just so much
easier.

</p><p>

By modularizing such concerns into aspects you ensure consistent
behavior across your project and don't depend on individual
programmers to follow a convention, say, on how to write security
or error checking. Indeed, it may not be necessary to for individual
programmers to write code for such concerns at all, if they're
centrally managed, from the outside, as it is, by aspects.
