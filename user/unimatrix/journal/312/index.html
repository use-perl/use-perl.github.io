<p><P><br/><br/>YAPC::NA 2001 has finished. The time went by too fast, but it was
fun. Lots of ideas and inspirations. And I've met many people whom
so far I've only known from IRC or mail or newsgroups.<br/><br/></P><P><br/><br/>After the auction (where I actually bought a Ruby book and learned about its literal objects; nice) a bunch of us went for dinner in a lovely
French restaurant. We split up into several groups as we didn't
want to run the by-now-familiar risk of being turned away due to
large numbers, and Abigail, Leon, Isabel (of NY.pm) and freeside
had dinner, and we did something else afterwards, but I just can't
seem to remember what. Drinking, probably. Someone mentioned to
Abigail that he thought Klingon sounded like angry Dutch.<br/><br/></P><P><br/><br/>Saturday lunch we had the CPAN BOF, where we had to book a hotel
room as there were about 30 people. Brian, who apparently hadn't
slept all night, tried to convey his napc-idea (think CPAN + Napster
for binary builds... watch this space) and there were other intense
discussions. CPAN is great, and other languages would kill to have
something like it, but there's still lots to do.<br/><br/></P><P><br/><br/>Then dha, Skud, Leon, Brian and many more went down into the old
town to have a few drinks. A card game called "Chez Geek", the
blame protocol and a long-expected rain (with impressive impromptu
rivers down the sloped streets of Montreal) come to mind, in no
particular order.<br/><br/></P><P><br/><br/>Sunday I just walked around lots; dinner at Mr Yan's again; now
it's Monday and I'm writing this in a cafe just before going to
the airport. Will be able to upload it only in Vienna, though.<br/><br/></P><P><br/><br/>NB: At the airport now. Complete rip-off: on top of an expensive
flight, you have to pay CAD 10 when going through customs. "Oh, we
just thought we'd rip you off some more before upholding our end
of the deal."<br/><br/></P>
