<p>Setting up registration in the afternoon was pretty painless . Went to a restaurant a few blocks away from the conference in the evening. Which turned out to be somewhat of an uncoordinated effort as poor Mr Yan couldn't cope with 40 hungry hackers, so about half had to be turned away as he "didn't want to give them bad service". Which is a nice attitude.<br/><br/>Met up with acme, Brian Ingerson, dha, Gurusamy Sarathy and had some more crazy ideas which this time I'm *not* going to add to my long list of projects as the list is already, well, long.<br/><br/>Now it's early morning (though the jetlag still caused me to wake up at 5.30am, so no change there) and they're just setting up breakfast and registration behind us as acme, gnat and me are updating our journals.<br/><br/>Some minor and not so minor glitches: Michel Rodriguez can't make it, so something else has to be arranged presto - for a 1.5 hours talk that's supposed to start at 10am. Fun!<br/><br/>gnat brought a wireless network base station - but no power cable. Thankfully there's an abundance of hubs to compensate. Nothing wireless, though.<br/><br/>Ah, lenzo has just turned up. Which means we'll have airport   again soon.<br/><br/>Later.</p>
