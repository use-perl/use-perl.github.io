<p>We had some problems with wireless this morning, so this entry is a bit late. We don't do steenkin' wires.<br/><br/>Yesterday afternoon saw Damian's amazing "Life, The Universe and Everything" talk - where he mixes Conway's (no relation) Life, Klingon, Perl 6, Maxwell's Demonsa and more in a talk that you just had to be there - Damian at his best.<br/><br/>This morning mjd gave his talk on the dirty innards of the regex engine and the identity function. Next was Leon's talk about creating compilers for little languages using Parse::RecDescent or Parse::Yapp and abstract syntax trees; a concept with huge potential. Very exciting stuff.<br/><br/>And finally I had my debut as a Perl conference speaker: A lightning talk on Aspect-Oriented Perl. I was a bit nervous just beforehand, but up on stage, it quickly passed. Even Abigail liked the idea. Bodes well for my first full-fledged talk on "Handling Attributes" at YAPC::Europe.<br/><br/>Speaking of stages, for the last lightning talk, Damian and Brian took the stage to present Inline::Files in a Shakespeare-style play, in which, amongst other things, Damian (or rather, his character) called Brian('s character) the "puppet of an active state". It was an incredible talk and there were standing ovations at the end.<br/><br/>A Perl conference without Damian is no Perl conference.<br/><br/>Now I'm looking forward to the Perl 6 status meeting after lunch. Speaking of which...
