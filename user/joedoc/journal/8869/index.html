<p><p>I suppose folks in the north would call this weather we're having "indian summer." I look at it as a break from the heat we have to deal with from May through September.
<p>The weather was nice enough for working in the yard on Saturady, so I began the monster lawn repair project by laying in some sod on the right-of-way in front of my house. Two pallets of St. Augustine Floritam in 1 square yard pieces. Watching it go onto the ground, one long row at a time is pretty amazing. Instant lawn. Where I grew up, on Long Island, you threw seed down in the spring and hoped it would take root and get green by the summer. This is very different. I've lived down here for 18 years, and this is the first time I've ever laid in my own lawn. I've done little patches and some sprigging, but this is a trip.
<p>Oh, yeah, it's a lot of work, too. Only half way done. Thank goodness Monday's a holiday.
<p>The job would be done, but we had a Jaguars' home game today, and that usually kills the greater part of my entire Sunday. They've been on a skid lately, so it was nice to see them rally and beat Washington.</p>

<h2>Doesn't St. Augustine spread?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ajtaylor/">ajtaylor</a> on 2002-11-12T18:23:46</h3>
IIRC St. Augustine is one of the southern grasses that spreads as it grows, as opposed to fescue which only grows where the seed was planted. Why not just put sprigs every few feet and wait a couple months for it fill in everywhere else? I do realize that it goes dormant in the winter, so perhaps that was a factor?
<p>
I know my parents did this with Centipede long, long ago in Alabama. I do miss the warm weather grasses - there is nothing softer and more comforting that a lawn of one of those grasses. FYI, here's a very interesting page on <a href="http://aggie-horticulture.tamu.edu/plantanswers/turf/publications/staug.html" title="tamu.edu">St. Augustine</a tamu.edu> grass.</p>

<p>St. Augustine will spread, but you've got to lay in a <i>lot</i> of plugs to cover the area I just did (about 1000 sq. ft). This late in the season, it seemed like a better idea to get in some established turf then to lay in a few hunderd plugs and hope they take.

</p><p>Besides, it just looks so go to have the whole thing green again.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)

</p><p>The extenuating factor was the weather. It's been very warm (though it's supposed to chill down today). We don't get hard freezes until much later, and I really wanted to cover up what was a totally bare chunk of my yard. So did my wife...</p>
