<p><p>Thanks goodness for Date::Calc. I'm working on a log roll procedure that needs to run after midnight, while saving the log file with yesterday's date. No need to reinvent the wheel again. 

<p>If you've never laid 1000 square feet of St. Augustine Floritam sod, one square at a time, it isn't easy. Crap, I'm only 47, but Mr. Body sure feels old today.

<p>I don't know if anyone here went to the University of Florida, but if so, I need not tell you of the religious ferver Gator fans hold for their football team and the Ol' Ball Coach, Steve Spurrier (or Mohamar Spurrier, as Jim Rome calls him). Football is a religion here, and Spurrier is a god, despite his exit to the NFL this year.

<P>He brought his Washington Redskins to town Sunday, and there were a lot of soap operas associated with his visit. The gator faithful believe he should be coaching the Jaguars and that Jaguars owner Wayne Weaver should have sacked current coach Tom Coughlin in the off-season and hired Spurrier when he had the chance. Coughlin settled that argument by working his team a little harder this week (they lost 4 straight going into Sunday's game after starting 3-1). Then, they proceeded to pound the Redskins, winning 26-7 and sending the Spurrier faithful home, drunk and tails between legs. Funny how those things work.</p>
