<p><p>Or is it Test::MockObject? Or UNIVERSAL::can that's broken?</p>

<p>This is something that has been exercising my mind recently, and I've decided that it's Object::InsideOut. (Yeah, go on flame me!).</p>

<p>If you use both Test::MockObject and Object::InsideOut in your project, you'll find you get lots of 'UNIVERSAL::can called as function not as method' warnings.</p>

<p>These warnings are generated by UNIVERSAL::can, which is pulled in by Test::MockObject.</p>

<p>Object::InsideOut grabs a code ref to UNIVERSAL::can:</p>

<code>$GBL{'can'} = \&UNIVERSAL::can</code>

<p>and then calls it:</p>

<code>$code = $$GBL{'can'}->($thing, $method);</code>

<p>Naturally, a warning ensues. I've managed to suppress the warning using the modules in this order at the head of the script:</p>

<pre><code>use Object::InsideOut ();
use UNIVERSAL::isa;</code></pre>

<p>I just wish these two modules would play together nicely.</p></p>

<h2>Object::InsideOut is Broken</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/chromatic/">chromatic</a> on 2008-09-30T23:21:47</h3>
<p> <code>UNIVERSAL::can()</code> is a method.  Calling methods as if they were functions does not work reliably.  O::IO's use of the function reference is a bug.</p>



<h2>Yow!</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/educated_foo/">educated_foo</a> on 2008-09-30T23:30:33</h3>
<p>If you're using Object::InsideOut, Test::MockObject, and UNIVERSAL::isa, you've just stepped into the middle of several vicious pedant wars (Google should turn up some goodies).  I would suggest not using one or more of these modules.</p>

<p>Well, that's an easy decision. I'd stop using Object::InsideOut on the basis that inside-out objects are a fad.</p><p>The thing is to file a a bug report on OIO, but I can't straight away see how to fix the problem.</p>

<h2>Re:Yow!</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/chromatic/">chromatic</a> on 2008-10-01T17:48:06</h3>
<p>After skimming the code, I wonder if OIO could stop monkeysquatting UNIVERSAL::isa and UNIVERSAL::can, perhaps by installing its own methods as methods in OIO-created classes (unless they already exist).</p>

<p>Despite being better than it was, UNIVERSAL::isa/can still aren't suitably complete.</p><p>Last time I checked, I think they still didn't support re-entrancy.</p><p>That is, if you have a custom -&gt;isa that itself calls another -&gt;isa, the second one doesn't work properly.</p>

<blockquote><div><p> <em>Last time I checked, I think they still didn't support re-entrancy.</em></p></div> </blockquote><p>I fixed those bugs per your test cases last year sometime.  I'm sure I asked if you could reproduce any problems in the ticket.</p>

<h2>OIO 3.47 reimplements its -can() and -isa()</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jdhedden/">jdhedden</a> on 2008-10-06T19:06:58</h3>
With thanks to TheNomad's for his prodding me on this issue, I have "fixed" OIO to have "proper" implementations for -&gt;can() and -&gt;isa() that do not rely on cached references to UNIVERSAL::can() and UNIVERSAL::isa().
<p>
With this reimplementation, OIO should now play well with Test::MockObject and the chromatic's CPAN versions of UNIVERSAL::can and UNIVERSAL::isa, and, hopefully, should eliminate the possibility of further conflicts of this nature.</p>

<p>I agree; the revised approach should never again conflict with T::MO.  Good work.</p>
