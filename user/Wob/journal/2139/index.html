<p>Health and Safety people will love our office. It's becoming more like a Dilbert cartoon everyday. 
<p>
We were all happily working away yesterday when one of the supports holding a TV just opposite where I sit snapped, dropping a TV almost onto the head of the person beneath it. Naturally she is a more than a little distressed to see it swinging by the mains power cord next to her. I've still not seen anyone check any of the other TVs and their stands to make sure they are safe.
<p>
When I got back from having my lunch an hour or two after this, I was told the building was being evacutated and all non essential staff had to leave. I was informed I couldn't go home early as I was essential. It's nice to be loved and wanted like this, but I can't help but think that the building was being evacuated for a good reason. It turns out that the mains water supply had burst and was pooring onto the electrical equipment in the basement. For obvious reasons the water had to be cut off, so those of us remaining were treated to bottled water for drinking and a trip to McDonalds if our bladders were full. I couldn't help but notice that it was the sales and marketing people who all vanished really quickly while the design, technical and editorial people were all deemed essential. I wonder why they are making me redundant at the end of the month if I am so essential? Maybe it's an attempt to get out of paying redundancy money by killing me?
<p>
I wonder what the rest of the week will bring???</p>
