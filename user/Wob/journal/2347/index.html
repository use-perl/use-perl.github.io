<p>I breathe a sigh of relief as I have found out that I am no longer being made redundant. 
<p>
All our websites are currently being redeveloped into Java, but there is still room for a budding Perl programmer to do all the little things that spring up from time to time. For example we do a lot of microsites for sponsors, and these are generally very specific. It would take quite a while to build these in Java, but as they are only running for a short period of time, our old friend Perl comes into its element. As it's so quick and easy to build a custom site using Perl, so it makes it the ideal language for these small little projects.
<p>
CPAN also helps a great deal. I've tried to rewrite some of the "in house" Perl modules I have written and use into Java. These can depend quite heavily on modules donated to CPAN by the Perl community. Now try finding a decent Java resource like CPAN... It's impossible. There are so many little libraries out there. Many of them are binary only or charge a fee for their use. Coming from a Perl background I find this incredibly frustrating. CPAN must be one of the greatest assets that Perl possesses. Never forget how lucky we are to have it!</p>
