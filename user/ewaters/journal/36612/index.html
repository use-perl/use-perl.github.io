<p>It looks like a Google search for ewaters yields my use.perl.org profile first.  Which is odd, but okay.<br/><br/>I doubt anyone will read this, but can I ask: am I an asshole?<br/><br/>I found a module via search.cpan.org (my most frequently used website) and found it failed to build on one machine.  I looked for rt.cpan.org bugs, found none, and so made a report of the build failure to the author via rt.cpan.org (I reported a bug).  They got super pissy at me for not reading their POD, and not noticing that they hate rt.cpan.org and refuse to use it.  They also got real snippy saying that there is no bug in their test suite, that it's a bug elsewhere (this build failed on an old machine so I wouldn't be surprised).  But rather than resolving the bug and spending two sentences saying why it's not their problem, and where the problem is (to save future people who may do what I did), they called me an asshole.<br/><br/>Where did I go wrong?</p>

<h2>authors == people</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/link/">link</a> on 2008-06-07T22:17:18</h3>
Authors are just a subset of people , some are awesome beyond belief but some a seriously sub par. Most are just average joes. Writing perl modules even good ones doesn't stop you being a prick.



<h2>You didn't</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/petdance/">petdance</a> on 2008-06-08T04:26:09</h3>
You didn't do anything wrong.  Sometimes people aren't very responsive.  And as the other comment said, they're just people, and some are jerks.



<h2>You're not an asshole</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jdavidb/">jdavidb</a> on 2008-06-09T12:36:42</h3>
<p>Rather than bearing the cost of trying to persuade you to do things their way, many people will try to bring some sort of moral or psychological pressure to bear, for example, by implying that you have some moral failing for not doing things their way.</p>

<p>If you want to report by RT, report by RT.  If they don't want to look at it, they don't have to.  Obviously they are looking at it, or they wouldn't have known to have bawled you out.  So now that you know they aren't going to respond positively to RT, then your question is how badly do you want this fixed.  If you think you can get some progress by politely reporting in another way, give it a shot.  If you think the person is likely to continue to be a jerk, don't waste your breath.</p>

<p>Don't lose sleep over what some idiot on the internet thinks of you.</p>
