<p>Greetings.<br/><br/>I've taken over Test::Distribution from Marcel. The things i wanted to do first of all to it were:<br/><br/>a) Get my style on it (Module::Built it etc. )
b) Sort out the  check for version before loading module "bug"
c) Look at maybe adding Pod::Coverage support.<br/><br/>Of course then i get the mails/patches that other people have sent Marcel over the past few months!<br/><br/>Its nice to know there are other ppl that are thinking along the same lines as me. But it did feel a teeny weeny bit overwhelming at first.<br/><br/>Just wanted to let ppl know that i am planning to go through all of them (inc. rt) in the coming weeks/months. <br/><br/>If I'm lucky I'll be able to push something out later today [altho i don't know what that something is yet ;-) ... but hey.. release early, release often]<br/><br/><br/><br/>This probably means that the initial release of Pod::DocBookXML will be delayed a bit... its almost there... [he says for the nth time]. It can't go out yet cos there's one bug that might end up renderin it useless in many cases which i want to fix first. (screw release early, release often ;-))<br/><br/><br><br/><br/>/me goes off to sing a song</p>

<h2>Test::Disttribution and CPANTS</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/domm/">domm</a> on 2003-11-09T20:24:30</h3>
I talked to Marcel some time ago (before decided to drop all his CPAN-modules) about somehow co-operating with Test::Distribution and CPANTS.
<p>
It would be interesting to see if we can somehow join our efforts. E.g. Test::Distribution is or could be the propsed 'linting tool' for dists...
</p><p>
But maybe we should discuss this per email, I'd suggest either private mail or perl-qa</p>

ok, for reasons i won't go into, it took me a little longer to get around to doing my first release of T::D.<br/><br/>But sure, it's never a bad idea to talk about co-operation
