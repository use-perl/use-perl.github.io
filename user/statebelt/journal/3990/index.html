<p>At PerlWhirl '02 I sat in on one of Dominus' lectures on using functional programming techniques in Perl. I asked where I could learn more about this and was recommended the book <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html"><em>Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</em></a>.
<p>
The examples are in Scheme, which is line-noise to me, so I've been using the scm2perl translator to help me understand the examples in my native perl. It does a decent job of translation, although it doesn't understand lambda functions (anon subs). scm2perl is part of the Gimp CPAN package and handles Gimp's script-fu dialect of Scheme.
<p>
Example:
<pre>
[localhost:~] thomas% less sum.scm
(define (sum term a next b)
  (if (> a b)
      0
      (+ (term a)
         (sum term (next a) next b))))

[localhost:~] thomas% scm2perl sum.scm
creating parser...done
header...reading(sum.scm)...translating...trailer...wrote(sum.pl)
[localhost:~] thomas% less sum.pl
#!/usr/bin/perl

use Gimp qw(:auto);
use Gimp::Fu;

sub sum {
   my ($term, $a, $next, $b) = @_;
   if ($a > $b) {
      0;
   } else {
      (term ($a) + sum ($term, next ($a), $next, $b));
   }
}


exit main;
</pre></p>

<h2>Line noise?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/pdcawley/">pdcawley</a> on 2002-04-05T20:06:28</h3>
Um... if you follow the book through from the beginning you'll get introduced to scheme as you go. It's worth the effort too, seriously head stretching. <br> <br> <i>The Little Schemer</i> and <i>The Seasoned Schemer</i> are also worth a go, the stuff in 'seasoned' dealing with continuations, co routines and all that jazz is definitely deep voodoo.



<h2>ugh</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jhi/">jhi</a> on 2002-04-05T22:01:26</h3>
<p>I seriously suggest trying to wean yourself out of the translator.  Grok Scheme.  Then move on and grok Smalltalk.  Prolog.  Forth.  (*) That's called "learning", I believe.</p>

<p>(*) No, that's not a progression of "guruness",  or recommendations, just a selection of mind-expanding experiences.</p>

It's a very good book, but I was really happy once I was able to recognize that it has some serious problems and unexamined prejudices.  Among other things, it has a definite air of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0631205101" title="amazon.com">"the perfect language"</a amazon.com> about it.  I wish the authors had gone thru had had a co-author hang "rebuttal" footnotes off of their wackier unexamined statements which they always manage to phrase in totally absolutist terms.
