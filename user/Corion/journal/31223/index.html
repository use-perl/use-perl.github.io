<p><p>I got some spam by a German company (Online Microsystems) seeking a freelancer today. I gave them a call and educated them about <a href="http://jobs.perl.org">jobs.perl.org</a>, which they actually were really happy to learn about.</p>
<p>I didn't find the page with the rules what's fit for posting on jobs.perl.org and what's not though. Still, if it's not fit for posting on jobs.perl.org, I don't want to hear about it via my CPAN mail address either.</p></p>

I assume they just sent it to every CPAN email address.

Yep, me too. The wording in the mail also sounds like it.

They also spammed a large number of perl.org lists but were fortunately moderated out

Yeah, I asked on module-authors@ and it looks like they did.  I sent a spam report to spamcop about it.  Hopefully they'll get the idea and won't do it again.  Thanks for calling them and educating them.  You're a bit nicer than I am about spam<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br/><br/>(BTW, 01mailrc.txt.gz contains some of the mailing lists.  I bet these guys just wrote a quick script to spam everyone there.  Easy to do with a few lines of perl<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
