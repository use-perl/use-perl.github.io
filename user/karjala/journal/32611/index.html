<p>I've been wanting to have an RSS feed for my modules, to announce new versions together with the changelog for those versions.<br/><br/>I've sent my suggestion to the people who operate CPAN but got no answer from there.<br/><br/>So I'm thinking of making a website for module users (or module authors) where they could have such RSS feeds for their favorite modules created. I'm wondering whether you think it would be a good idea and whether anyone would use it.<br/><br/>The best of course would be for CPAN to implement this on their site, but since they're not responding, I wonder whether making such a site might give them a hint (that per-module feeds are needed).<br/><br/>For me it would be useful, but do you think such a site would attract a significant number of people (i.e. more than 20?) to make it worth the effort?</p>

<h2>Sounds great</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/clscott/">clscott</a> on 2007-03-08T02:06:05</h3>
That would be great.<br><br>I could see subscribing for each module that is a dependency in each of my projects so I would know when there is new functionality that I might take advantage of or fixes for bugs that I did not know about.



<h2>JFDI</h2>

You don't need anyone's permission. Just do it<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br><br>It would be really nice if people could have custom sets of modules to watch, too<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)



<h2>Sounds like a pretty good idea</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Yanick/">Yanick</a> on 2007-03-09T02:57:16</h3>
I agree that could be quite handy. And by doing some magic munging of the Changelogs, I think the whole process could turn out to be almost transparent to the module maintainers. In any case, if you need help, don't hesitate to poke this way.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)



<h2>just filter search.cpan.org's feed!</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/merlyn/">merlyn</a> on 2007-03-09T07:33:27</h3>
You can do this today.  Go to pipes.yahoo.com, create search.cpan.org's new module rss as your source, then use the "grep" filter to look for what you want.<br/><br/>No code to write.  It's already done.
