<h1>SanDiego.pm June Meeting</h1>
<h2><a href="/user/cgrau/">cgrau</a> on 2007-06-07T00:05:44</h2>
</div> <!-- /span4 -->


<div class="span8">
<p><p>It's that time of the month again.  Time for the regular gathering of the slightly irregular Perl Mongers in San Diego.</p>

<p>People will begin descending on Panera Bread in Mira Mesa on Monday, 11 June 2007 at 7:00pm (and generally stay until they've had enough, or 9:00pm, whichever comes first).  We've had a great turnout all year, so feel free to join us.  You're guaranteed to have a great time.  And, if you don't, you'll receive a full refund of your membership dues[0].  Directions and such can be found on our web site, <a href="http://sandiego.pm.org/">SanDiego.pm.org</a>.</p>

<p>Sadly, I won't be able to attend this month's meeting.  My day job is sending me to Toronto for training.  I'll be in our #SanDiego.pm channel on Freenode, attending the meeting remotely.  Hopefully a few of my camel compatriots will keep me up to date on all the happenings.</p>

<p>[0] Membership dues for the San Diego chapter of the Perl Mongers is $0.00 per annum.</p>
</p>

<p>Thank you for the welcome.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>

<p>I'm hoping to squeeze out enough time to see more of the city; maybe visit a few pubs downtown.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I'm only in Toronto until Friday the 15th.  Next time I'll try to get my company to schedule my trip around the Toronto Perl Mongers meeting.</p>

<h2>Meeting Log</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/cgrau/">cgrau</a> on 2007-06-12T12:04:33</h3>
<p>As promised, I didn't make it to the meeting.  However, my one loyal friend and fellow Perl Monger, Dan, did attend and dutifully logged into our IRC channel, #SanDiego.pm on Freenode.</p> <p><blockquote><div>18:54:58  * sirhc hopes someone logs in from the meeting<br>
19:52:44 -!- drisse [n=dan@64.241.37.140] has joined #SanDiego.pm<br>
19:52:51 &lt;@sirhc&gt; hey!<br>
19:52:57 &lt; drisse&gt; howdy!<br>
19:53:04 &lt;@sirhc&gt; i didn't think anyone was going to log on<br>
19:53:28 &lt; drisse&gt; hehe, I was a bit late is all, and waited until I finished eating<br>
19:53:56 &lt;@sirhc&gt; probably a good call<br>
19:54:01 &lt;@sirhc&gt; greasy keyboards suck<br>
19:54:19 &lt;@sirhc&gt; so how's the meeting?<br>
19:54:56 &lt; drisse&gt; it's pretty interesting<br>
19:55:05 &lt;@sirhc&gt; cool<br>
19:55:11 &lt; drisse&gt; There are 6 of us here, 3 of which I've never seen before<br>
19:55:16 &lt;@sirhc&gt; nice<br>
19:56:30 &lt;@sirhc&gt; what's being discussed?<br>
19:57:03 &lt;@sirhc&gt; apparently every bar in canada has hoegaarden on tap<br>
19:57:07 &lt;@sirhc&gt; i'm very happy here<br>
19:57:31 &lt; drisse&gt; a few strange issues with sending messages not using the from address but using the userid of the current process<br>
19:57:55 &lt;@sirhc&gt; that's typical when using sendmail or what-not<br>
19:58:04 &lt;@sirhc&gt; need to pass a flag to read the headers from stdin<br>
19:58:06 &lt; drisse&gt; Bar Camp, which is some sort of open conference that happened last week<br>
19:58:26 &lt; drisse&gt; no, it was using SMTP via some standard CPAN module<br>
19:58:37 &lt;@sirhc&gt; ah<br>
20:01:22 &lt; drisse&gt; I found a bug with Readonly today<br>
20:01:40 &lt;@sirhc&gt; what's the bug?<br>
20:01:51 &lt; drisse&gt; This doesn't make the variable Readonly correctly:<br>
20:03:23 &lt; drisse&gt; Readonly my $foo_rh =&gt; { a =&gt; 1 };<br>
20:04:52 &lt;@sirhc&gt; tricky<br>
20:05:01 &lt;@sirhc&gt; i bet you couldn't assign a new reference to $foo_rh<br>
20:05:46 &lt; drisse&gt; yeah, that was my guess too<br>
20:05:59 &lt; drisse&gt; that it wasn't a deep readonly, just a single level one<br>
20:06:11 &lt;@sirhc&gt; but it breaks entirely?<br>
20:06:38 &lt; drisse&gt; Not breaks, as much as doesn't break<br>
20:06:52 &lt; drisse&gt; This runs without throwing errors:<br>
20:07:03 &lt; drisse&gt; Readonly my $foo_rh =&gt; { a =&gt; 1 };<br>
20:07:12 &lt; drisse&gt; $foo_rh-&gt;{a} = 2;<br>
20:08:55 &lt;@sirhc&gt; i'd expect as much. does 2 get assigned?<br>
20:09:07 &lt; drisse&gt; I actually figured out how to patch it and correct it already and sent a patch of the<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.pm file and the<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.t file, so with luck it will be fixed shortly<br>
20:09:20 &lt;@sirhc&gt; nice<br>
20:14:07 &lt; drisse&gt; Now we're talking about ways to resize images<br>
20:14:26 &lt;@sirhc&gt; ImageMagick is great for that<br>
20:14:28 &lt; drisse&gt; Image::Magick doesn't seem to work efficiently.<br>
20:14:38 &lt;@sirhc&gt; in what way?<br>
20:14:53 &lt; drisse&gt; Someone thought it would be worth exploring using PDL instead<br>
20:14:53 &lt;@sirhc&gt; i've had some success with Imager, but haven't used it much<br>
20:37:55 &lt;@sirhc&gt; well, it's late here and i have another late morning, so i'm going to crash<br>
20:38:05 &lt;@sirhc&gt; enjoy the rest of the meeting. say hi for me<br>
20:38:07 &lt; drisse&gt; alright<br>
20:38:14 &lt; drisse&gt; talk to you later<br>
20:38:17 &lt;@sirhc&gt; see ya<br>
20:43:21 &lt; drisse&gt; you are being mocked mercilessly for going to bed early<br>
20:48:07 -!- drisse [n=dan@64.241.37.140] has quit []<br></div>
