<div class="span8">
<p><p>I'm currently on a brief leave from <tt>$work</tt> after the birth of my daughter last Tuesday.  Since she hasn't required that much attention, I wanted to take advantage of the time off and be productive.  I'm always talking about how I want to write more code to release, so I've finally put my money where my mouth is.  I released <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Export-Lexical/">Export::Lexical</a> last night.</p>

<p>It came from an aside made during a Perl 5.10 class taught by Damian Conway last week.  He was demonstrating the lexically scoped module feature (see <a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/perlpragma.html">perlpragma</a>) with a simple debugging module with lexical scope.  When asked if it was available on the CPAN, he said it wasn't, because he would rather see a module available that generalized the technique.  When he suggested that someone in the audience might be the one to write it, I jumped.</p>

<p>It's a fairly simple and straight-forward module, providing a single subroutine attribute: <tt>:ExportLexical</tt>.  When marked with this attribute, the subroutine is then exported only to the lexical scope in which the module is used.  The <tt>no</tt> keyword also works, in the same way as <tt>no strict</tt> and <tt>no warnings</tt>.  Additionally, individual subroutines can be specified in the same way as <tt>use strict 'refs'</tt> or <tt>no warnings 'redefine'</tt> are used.</p>

<p>The module makes all of this easy, without the need to fully understand <tt>perlpragma</tt> or the need to code up all the boilerplate infrastructure.  We like easy, right?</p>

<pre>
package Foo;

use strict;
use warnings;
use Export::Lexical;

sub foo :ExportLexical {
    # do something
}

sub bar :ExportLexical {
    # do something else
}

1;
</pre>

<p>No, really.  That's it.  It's rather simple to use the resulting module as well.</p>

<pre>
#!perl

use strict;
use warnings;

{
    use Foo;

    foo();    # calls foo()
    bar();    # calls bar()

    {
        no Foo 'bar';

        foo();    # calls foo()
        bar();    # bar() is a no-op
    }
}
</pre>

<p>I'm pretty excited that I've finally taken the time to contribute.  Hopefully this will get me on a roll and will be the first of many.  I actually have several I've developed at <tt>$work</tt> to simplify programs written to work with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Load_Sharing_Facility">LSF</a>, but I'm still waiting for legal to allow me to publish them under an Open Source license.</p>

<h2>cool!</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/rjbs/">rjbs</a> on 2008-10-09T19:45:18</h3>
<p>I'd much prefer to be able to make "bar" after "no X 'bar'" be an exception rather than a no-op.</p><p>I'd also love to see a Sub::Exporter extension (this could be a kind of 'installer').</p>

<p><div class="quote"><p>I'd much prefer to be able to make "bar" after "no X 'bar'" be an exception rather than a no-op.</p></div><p>That had crossed my mind as well.  In this initial release, I went ahead and let the module quietly ignore the call.  I intend to make exceptions an option (or the default behavior - I'm not sure yet).</p><p><div class="quote"><p>I'd also love to see a Sub::Exporter extension (this could be a kind of 'installer').</p></div><p>I'll look at that.  Thanks for the suggestion.</p>

<h2>will not work</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/chorny/">chorny</a> on 2009-08-19T07:53:30</h3>
<p>Will not work due to the same problem with sub attributes as in Exporter::Simple.<br>Reported it here: <a href="https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=48824" title="cpan.org">https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=48824</a cpan.org></p>
