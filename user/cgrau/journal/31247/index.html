<p><p>The company I work for just had Damian Conway come in to present three days of training.  In addition, he made a special appearance at our local <a href="http://sandiego.pm.org/">San Diego Perl Mongers</a>.</p>

<p>So, with a complete and utter disregard for my mental health, I attended Monday night's Perl Mongers presentation of <i>Sufficiently Advanced Technology</i>.  That was fun.  Shame my wife couldn't make it; she wanted to meet this crazy Aussie I kept talking about after OSCON.  Anyway, after a day to recover, I made it to Wednesday's lecture on <i>Perl Best Practices</i>, Thursday's on <i>More Perl Best Practices</i> and <i>Advanced Regular Expressions</i>, and finally Friday's on <i>Advanced Interface Design</i> (otherwise known, to anyone who attended OSCON 2006, as the <i>7 Principles of Better API Design</i>).  I thought I was losing sanity before, but now I'm quite positive.  I'd like to share an important safety tip: thinking in Perl is unhealthy.  Sometimes I feel like that boy from <i>The Sixth Sense</i>: "I see Perl code."</p>

<p>I didn't get a chance to meet Dr. Conway at OSCON, so this was a nice opportunity for me; both to meet him and to see longer versions of his courses.  He's very personable and extremely knowledgable.  Even being quite a good programmer myself (he said modestly... hey, even Damian said I was, though he may have just been saying that... either way, I can die happy), I still learned quite a bit.  In fact, I think these courses are great even for people who do know the material inside and out.  It's much easier to pick up on the <i>really</i> scary stuff that Damian throws into his ad-hoc demonstrations.  I hope we can get him back next year.  I'd love to see his course on Vim.</p>

<p>Oh, and Damian even picked up on the fact that I tend to be a workaholic, asking me if I ever went home (my wife often wonders the same thing).  Hey, so what if I was the first person there, sitting right in front?  I'm a geek, I can admit that.  I hear there are <a href="http://www.pm.org/">meetings</a> I can attend.  "Hi.  My name is Chris.  I've been using Perl for 10 years."</p>
