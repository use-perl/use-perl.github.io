<p><p>Well I didn't get a chance to read some of PP like I had hoped over the weekend.  I usually read right before going to bed, but I've found out that if I read non-fiction I can't sleep as I lie there and ponder what I've just read.  I'll have to make some time earlier in the night to get through the book.  Probably right after I get home from work, because that's a good time to pause for the day.</p>
<p>I did complete most of the other tasks I had set for myself over the weekend.  Subversion, Bugzilla and a "coming soon" web page are all in place.  I setup the repository and even checked in a skeleton of the project code.  Soon, I'll be able to flesh out the code and the project will be underway.</p>
<p>This morning at the office I found one small problem with Subversion.  I'm able to use the repository from my home network, but I keep getting a password prompt when I try from my work system.  I have a couple ideas of what the problem might be, which are:</p>
<ul>
<li>I have SSH working from work to hollyking.org  and use it to read my email throughout the day.  One problem might be that at work the user account is 'bleber' while at home it's 'brendan.'  With SSH I just specify brendan@hollyking.org and it works, but with svn using the --username switch didn't help.  I'll have to experiment a bit to see if the username is the problem.</li>
<li>The other, more likely, possibility is that the port that 'svn checkout svn+ssh...' is blocked at the corporate firewall.</li>
</ul>
<p>I wish that I was receiving some kind of error message from Subversion.  Just asking for a password doesn't give me any idea where things might be breaking down.  I guess that's where mailing list archives, IRC and turning up the verbosity settings help.</p>
<p>There is some Perl related content coming, I promise.  I just have to get the pre-requisites out of the way.  ;)</p></p>

It is not possible to block one but not the other.  As far as the firewall is concerned, they're both the same.  The whole point of SSH tunneling is that to determine what the actual underlying traffic is you'd have to decrypt it.<br> <br>Try svn+ssh://username@server.com/...<br>

<p>Thanks!  That worked like a charm!</p>
