<p><I>I heard the news today, oh boy...</I> <a href="http://mp3.com">mp3.com</a> has been sold, and will cease to exist as it is now, in 2 weeks time &mdash; on the 2nd of December, to be precise.
<P>I must admit, in the last year, I've grown to be an mp3.com addict. It has changed the way I listen to music. Everyday, I get my daily dose of 20 "daily recommendations", and I'm loving it. I've gotten to know more good music in the last months through mp3.com, than through radio or television put together. Granted, most of the artists are unknown, but there's enough good stuff to outdo the average radio or TV show any time. I've listened to (a few minutes of) thousands of songs,  and I've collected a list of about 600 songs I feel worthwhile, some more than 100 favourites, which I would by in a blink of an eye if they were available in the shops.
<P>I somehow feel comforted through the fact that <a href="http://cnet.com">CNET</a> is the one who bought it, because this is, though the years, one of the very few domains that have always have brought us the better stuff on the web. Still, I feel this could well be the end of an era.</p>

See <a href="http://irate.sf.net/" title="sf.net">iRate</a sf.net>, internet radio that learns your likes and dislikes, and leaves you with a directory of legal MP3s as well.
<p>
I wrote an article about moving iRate data into iTunes for an upcoming <a href="http://www.tpj.com/" title="tpj.com">Perl Journal</a tpj.com> issue.</p>
