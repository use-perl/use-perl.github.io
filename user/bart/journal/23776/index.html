<h1>The end of comp.lang.perl.misc?</h1>

<div class="span8">
<p>This morning, I took a look at the newgroups. I thought there weren't very many posts in comp.lang.perl.misc, so I did a little test: I marked everything younger than 72 hours as unread. I found that there were only about 90 posts in those 3 whole days, roughly 30 per day...
<P>That is very little. Only a few years ago, I seem to recall that there were, on average, 300 posts per day. That's 10 times as much as this past weekend.
<P>What's going on? Is my news server missing that many posts? I don't think so, it's behaving pretty well lately.
<P>Some people suggested that this might have been a "special weekend". Perhaps. Since this morning, roughly 50 new posts have arrived, over about 12 hours. That's clearly a higher rate than in the last few days, but still a lot less than in the olden days.
<P>It's not spam that killed it, there's barely any spam in comp.lang.perl.misc. A traditional complaint is that the regulars are too harsh on newbies. Perhaps they are &mdash; heck, I've complained about it myself, in the past &mdash; while being a regular myself, so it wasn't harshness against me :). But in any case, that's nothing new. It didn't stop the newsgroup from thriving before. Still other people feel that newsgroup trolls are responsible for its decline. But I can't see much troll activity, lately.
<P>I don't know. I feel it's still some other cause, something I've overlooked here.

<h2>End of Usenet predicted - film at 11!</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/merlyn/">merlyn</a> on 2005-03-22T00:26:31</h3>
The end of Usenet has been predicted many times.  Of course, if Usenet goes, CLPM goes with it.



<h2>Signal to noise ratio?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/schwern/">schwern</a> on 2005-03-22T02:00:29</h3>
Maybe the worst trolls (*ahem* perlgurl) have gone away.  Check the signal-to-noise ratio on those messages.  Are they mostly content?<br> <br>Other possible explainations:<br>* I believe AOL shut down their usenet feed.<br>* learn.perl.org, its beginners mailing list and perlmonks might be taking mindshare from clpm.<br>



<h2>Other possibilities</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/djberg96/">djberg96</a> on 2005-03-22T03:46:32</h3>
I think other contributing factors are a loss of mindshare to other languages, and a growth in the popularity of IRC.
<p>
I have absolutely no evidence to back this up.  It's just a gut feeling.</p>
