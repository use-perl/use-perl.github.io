<p>Now here's a little recipe I threw together for the first time some months ago, and my family is loving it. It's an instant classic. <br/><br/>When I say "simple recipe", I mean it: the name alone describes about half of the recipe. It takes about the cooking time of the pasta to make.<br/><br/>In case you never tried it: smoked salmon and mozzarella (the fresh kind, that comes in plastic bags filled with water) go very well together, just try it on a bun, a slice of smoked salmon, some slices of the mozarella, and some lettuce, it's extremely nice. The soft taste of the mozzarella softens the somewhat strong taste of the salmon.<br/><br/>So, here's the recipe, for 2 1/2 people (my son of 6 counts for half): boil enough salted water, and put 300g of dried pasta in it. You can use tagliatelli, or any other shape you choose, as long as it's rather small.<br/><br/>In the meantime, open 2 packets (2 x 200g) of smoked salmon, and 2 bags of fresh mozarella (about 2x125g, but you can add an extra bag if you think it's not enough), and cut both into little pieces; the salmon into strips of about 1 cm wide and 3 cm long, the mozarella into little blocks of about 1 cm cubed. <br/><br/>When the pasta is cooked, drain the water, and add the salmon, together with about 2 tablespoons of oil (I genral use corn oil, but you can use any kind you like, including olive oil) to it, against sticking. Mix them well together, the salmon should not stick together at all. Wait a while, the heat of the pasta will half cook the salmon. Then, add the mozzarella. Again, stir well, make sure the cubes don't stick together because they'll melt, and you'd end up with large blobs, which isn't that nice.<br/><br/>Serve warm, not hot. Serve with a few slices of (raw) tomato and cucumber on the side. That's all you need, no need to add sauce or spices or anything else.<br/><br/>Bon appetit!
