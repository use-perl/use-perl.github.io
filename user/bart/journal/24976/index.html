<p>All children's afternoon programmes on TV have been dropped because of live coverage of tennis matches. It's been like this already all week. Nice for the kids.
<P>Sometimes, I <em>really</em>   hate the stereotypical adult male. Who else to blame?</p>

<h2>Yeah</h2>

Whose to blame for not showing more wholesome tennis for the kids, ALL the time?<br> <br>My dad plays tennis every day and coaches the boys and girls at the local high school, and last weekend bought my three-year old daughter her first tennis racket, so don't mind me.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br>



<h2>Sports</h2>

<p>I never really liked sports.  Probably too closely associated in my mind with all the mistreatment I received in elementary school during physical education.</p>

<p>While we're on the subject, it's bothered me that as we shop for clothes for our newborn son, 90% of what's out there is sports related.  Somehow seeing "Daddy's little slugger" on my son just doesn't have the emotional resonance with me that the manufacturers want it to.</p>

<p>Some stores seem to have their entire baby boys' inventory composed almost entirely of sports-related items.  And much of the rest is dog-related.  Apparently boys are supposed to like dogs, and girls are supposed to like cats.  Personally, I don't like dogs, either.</p>

<p>We did manage to find a lot of good non-sports, non-dog related clothing at Sears.</p>

You can get geek clothes at ThinkGeek (plug, plug).

<p>Yes.  I found a perl onesie in my stocking.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<p>He can't quite fit in it, yet, but we're getting there quickly.</p>
