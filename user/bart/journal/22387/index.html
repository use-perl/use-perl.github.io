<p>I finally installed SP2 on my XP laptop yesterday. One thing that's new is that you can now let the system install updates before turning off the computer. Brilliant! If there's one time you don't need the computer, is when you decide to turn it off; it's also the one time you don't mind rebooting. If only it did work.
<P>It said it was installing the first of two updates, it'd turn off the computer afterwards... After two whole hours, I was tired of it and forcibly turned off the computer. I immediately started it up again, expecting to see the computer complain loudly. Nothing. It didn't even mention an interrupted install. I then manually started up the updates, and after two minutes, it was all done.
<P>Damn I hate it when things go like this.<br/><br/></p>

<h2>Try it from behind a MS Proxy...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Lunchy/">Lunchy</a> on 2004-12-21T01:58:05</h3>
We're regrettably an MS shop at work so we use MS ISA Server for a proxy.  We have major problems on some XP boxes with windows update.  It seems one of the *updates* actually BORKS windows update if you're behind an MS proxy.  I've seen it work correctly, but I've seen it go horribly wrong to the point where it's unfixable by any means we've tried.  MS has a patch out for it, but more times than not, that doesn't work either.  So basically, you get to reinstall the machine only to bork it again and again.  *sigh*
