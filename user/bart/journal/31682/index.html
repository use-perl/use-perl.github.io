<p>I can't believe this trolling ad here on use.perl.org: <a href="http://m.2mdn.net/876092/SUN-628-728x90.swf">"Java technology is now the world's most important community property"</a>. WTF.

<h2>Annoying too</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/runrig/">runrig</a> on 2006-11-21T21:43:28</h3>
I have the NoScript plug-in for FireFox, and sometime ago put perl.org on the "allow" list. Up until now I wondered where these ads were that everyone was talking about. Then I noticed in NoScript an option to allow doubleclick. So that's where they were hiding...in the JavaScript. What an annoying flashy ad too...I usually Adblock those. Now I'm conflicted, 'cuz I'd like to support use.perl...<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)



<h2>Because...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/sigzero/">sigzero</a> on 2006-11-22T17:28:07</h3>
<p>The web ain't free?</p>

<p>About the "Omnipotent" bunny ad. That ad isn't really correct. "Omnipotent" has to do with how "powerful" something is. "Omniscience" has to do with how "knowledgable" something is.
</p>

<p>So the ad should really read:<br> <br>

"This Omniscient Rabbit is Smarter Than You"<br> <br>

Or<br> <br>

"This Omnipotent Rabbit is More Powerful Than You"
</p>



<h2>Ad/Editorial wall</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/DAxelrod/">DAxelrod</a> on 2006-11-22T21:38:00</h3>
If it makes you feel any better, I'm sure the ads are not selected specifically for use.perl, but are instead from some category like "technology".<br><br>Besides, wouldn't you rather have a wall between commercial interests and editorial interests? (Or has the web killed that idea?)



<h2>I'm Happy about it</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Shlomi Fish/">Shlomi Fish</a> on 2006-11-24T21:03:58</h3>
<p>
I noticed this ad, but I'm personally happy that <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/onjava/blog/2006/11/java_gpled_1.html" title="oreillynet.com">Sun GPLed Java</a oreillynet.com>. While I'm not too big a fan of Java as a programming language, it is an important technology, and it's a good thing to have it under a usable open-source licence. Every contribution for open-source is a good thing, because the issue at hand is not Perl vs. Java/Python/Ruby/PHP/LISP/Intercal but rather free vs. non-free software. So Sun deserve some credit for their move.
</p>

<p>
I did find the ad a bit funny in the context of use.perl.org, but I've seen worse ads in my lifetime, and was not particularly moved by it.
