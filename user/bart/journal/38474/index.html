<p><p><em>(Note: a first draft of this post has been lying on my shelf for over a year. Now, I finally got around to finishing it.)</em></p>

<p>Now and then in Perl forums, the discussion comes up about how bad it is
to use grep in boolean context.
And now it's even been poured into a <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Perl::Critic::Policy::BuiltinFunctions::ProhibitBooleanGrep">Perl::Critic rule</a>, based on Damian Conway's PBP book, and the
argument they bring up is always the same (see the POD for the module):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Using <code>grep</code> in boolean context is a common idiom for checking if any
  elements in a list match a condition.  This works because boolean context is a
  subset of scalar context, and grep returns the number of matches in scalar
  context.  A non-zero number of matches means a match.</p>
  
  <p>But consider the case of a long array where the first element is a match.
  Boolean <code>grep</code> still checks all of the rest of the elements needlessly.
  Instead, a better solution is to use the <code>any</code> function from
  <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?List::MoreUtils">List::MoreUtils</a>,
  which short-circuits after the first successful match to save time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, <em>why</em> would you expect the item you're looking for to be the first one in the array? I see no reason for such an assumption, at all. On average, you still have to look through about half of the array items, <em>if</em> the item is even in the array. If it isn't, you still have to look through all items, anyway.</p>

<p>So, depending on the likelihood that an item is in the array, you might save between 0% and 50% of execution time by leaving the loop early. Personally, I don't find that overly impressive... As O(n) is still O(n).</p>

<p>The implied assumption is that the overhead of <code>grep</code> and <code>any</code> is ignorable, or at least, that it is the same for both, somebody that nobody actually bothered to verify. Well, I bothered. I decided to benchmark <code>grep</code> vs. <code>any</code>.</p>

<p>The kind of code that I benchmarked is the simple common problem of testing for the presence of a string in an array, just like <code>IN</code> in (some dialects of) SQL, and <code>in_array</code> of PHP.
Here are the prerequisites and the functions I tested:</p>

<pre>my @letters = 'A' .. 'Z';
my %letter; $letter{$_} = 1 foreach @letters;

# List::MoreUtils' any
any =&gt; sub { my $x = any { $_ eq $search } @letters },
# grep with expression
grepE =&gt; sub { my $x = grep $_ eq $search, @letters },
# grep with block
grepB =&gt; sub { my $x = grep { $_ eq $search } @letters },
# explicitly written code with foreach and last
foreach =&gt; sub { my $x=0; $_ eq $search and $x=1, last foreach @letters; },
# the expected overall winner: prefilled hash
hash =&gt; sub { my $x = exists $letter{$search} },
# hash on the fly, rebuilt on every test
temphash =&gt; sub { my %h; @h{@letters}=(); my $x = exists $h{$search} },
</pre>

<p>I searched for 'Z' (last item), 'M' (center item), 'C' (pretty up front), 'A' (first item), and 'banana' (not in the list). And here are the results (ActivePerl 5.8.8, Windows XP, 2.4GHz):</p>

<p>Well, that is looking bad for <code>any</code>: it is the worst performer in all cases. In the average case ('M'), it is almost 3 times slower than <code>grep</code> (grep with expression is, as I expected, a bit better than grep with a block, as the latter has an overhead of entering/exiting a lexical block). Even <em>in its best case</em>, <code>any</code> is <em>still</em> almost twice as slow as <code>grep</code>. So much for saving. The manually written loop is, in the average case, about a third faster than <code>grep</code>. But, if the item isn't found, it is actually slower.</p>

<p>No surprise that, if you <em>really</em> want a high speed test, and you need to test against the same array often, it is best to prepare a hash and simply test if the item is in the hash.</p>

<p>What I found rather surprising, is that populating a hash and using it once ('temphash'), isn't such a bad performer.</p>

<p>For completeness' sake, here's the same benchmark on Strawberry Perl 5.10.</p>

<p>As an aside: I've got the distinct impression that overall, Strawberry Perl 5.10 is slower than ActivePerl 5.10, by about 5-10%. The biggest surprise to me, however, is that <code>grep BLOCK</code> is no longer <em>faster</em> than <code>grep EXPRESSION</code>. So weird.</p>

<p>Now, the thing you would test for must not always be that simple. If it is very slow or otherwise expensive, you might still, and rightfully so, want to leave the testing loop early. But, although elegant as a solution, you should not blindly assume that <code>any</code> is the best solution for every such problem... Though I wish that <code>grep</code> would be made smarter, and that it either <em>knows</em> to leave the test loop early, or that you could manually do so, for example, with <code>last</code>.</p>

<p>p.s. The code to convert Rate to Time was kindly supplied by GrandFather on Perlmonks.</p>

<p>p.p.s. I'm sorry about the formatting problem, that "&amp;#181;" should look like "ÃÂµ", but even though it is a "ÃÂµ" character in the text I posted, the journaling system shows it as "&amp;#181;". It's a bug, I'm sure.</p>

<p>They are all damn fast, and using <code>any</code> <em>reads</em> much better.</p>



<h2>Your reasoning is flawed</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Arador/">Arador</a> on 2009-02-14T01:26:42</h3>
<p>Your reasoning is flawed. You are assuming that there is one positive match in the set, and that the set is small. On such a small set you're right any isn't any faster, but superior algorithms rarely show up on small datasets.</p><p>If you would test this with a larger dataset, any would come out much better. On my computer, using the list <code>1..1000</code> and a needle of 500, it is in fact faster. The advantage only gets bigger when the haystack gets bigger.</p><p>You're right it's not always better, but it is when it matters the most.</p>

<p>I agree.  With such a small set no method is going to take an irritatingly long time.  Since you have the program handy could you give it a quick tweak to use a bigger array and re-post the results?</p><p>I also agree with autarch that <code>any</code> reads better, as a way of signalling programmer intent.  I'd probably use the <code>any</code> from <code>Perl6::Junction</code> rather than <code>List::MoreUtils</code>; any chance you could add that to your testing as well?  Thanks!</p>

In this <a href="http://srezic.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/*checkout*/srezic/perl-bench/grep-vs-first.pl" title="sourceforge.net">benchmark </a sourceforge.net> grep and first were searching for the middle element in the array.</p>
