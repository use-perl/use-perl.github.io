<p>This afternoon I went to see the movie Spiderman 3 in the theater, with my son and a neighbor's kid. I wasn't expecting too much, as <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/spiderman_3/?sortby=date&critic=columns">many critiques</a> say the movie's too much of a hodgepodge to be actually good.<br/><br/>Well, I disagree. I actually think this is the best of the 3 spiderman movies. So there's a confusing mixture of storylines, but they all have one thing in common: this is about spiderman's life. All these things happen to him all at the same time. Do you think villains would nicely wait their turn and attack him one at a time? No. Villains attack when it suits <em>them</em>, and yes, it makes life really confusing for the person in the center of the story. It may seem like a lot of balls to juggle, but it's Peter Parker who has to do the juggling. And he's having just a bit of trouble to cope.<br/><br/>Nowhere in the movie did I loose track of the story, or did I think they did something totally out of character. I think it works.<br/><br/></p>
