<p>Eek. I hate this. It's one of the reasons why I dispise working with C.<br/><br/>The DLLs built with PXPerl+MinGW are just too big. I tried this code:
<pre>
use Inline C => <<'END_OF_C_CODE';<br/><br/>END_OF_C_CODE
</pre>
That's right, an empty library, and the resulting DLL was a whopping 249k!<br/><br/>Urgh, not that nightmare again... <br/><br/>So I checked more DLLs includes with the distribution, and those built by MinGW, and the latter are all huge. For example, the DLL for HTML::Parser that comes in the distro, version 3.45, is 60kB... the one built with MinGW, using
<pre>
test GAAS/HTML-Parser-3.45.tar.gz
</pre>
in the CPAN shell, is 347kB!!!<br/><br/>WTF is all this junk, and is it possible to make this much smaller? </p>

<h2>Strip</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/bart/">bart</a> on 2006-02-19T10:44:27</h3>
Scanning the web a little, plus my previous (bad) experiences with C compilers, made me look up a "strip" option, to "remove (debugging) symbols from the executables". I found that for MinGW, I need the <a href="http://www.spacejack.org/games/mingw/" title="spacejack.org">-s</a spacejack.org> flag.<br><br>So I edited the "linker flags for DLLs", from <blockquote> <div><tt>-mdll</tt></div> </blockquote> to<blockquote> <div><tt>-mdll -s</tt></div> </blockquote>(For this, you have to run <tt>configure_pxperl</tt>.)<br><br>Now, the HTML::Parser DLL is reduced to 40k (yay! I never expected it to work so well!), and the empty Inline DLL is 7k. Great.<br><br>This should be a standard enabled option in PXPerl's configuration.

<p>I just checked, and <a href="http://camelpack.sourceforge.net/index.php/VanillaPerl" title="sourceforge.net">VanillaPerl</a sourceforge.net>, which is built with mingw using perl5.8.8's win32/Makefile, has this option on by default.</p>
<p>I downloaded and built HTML-Parser v3.45; the dll is 38.5kB.</p>

Thanks for pointing me to VanillaPerl, I hadn't heard of it before. Well, seen it has had only 7 downloads until today, I think I'm not the only one. But it looks promising. A MinGW compiled perl that includes the compiler it was built with, is always very interesting.<br><br>So CamelPack is a SourceForge project now, is it? Nice. And VanillaPerl is part of the grand project. Also nice.<br><br>I am still planning on pushing forward with this PXPerl+MinGW combination. If I don't, it looks like nobody will. And that would be a shame.<br><br>

PXPerl definitely has a different target 'audience' than VanillaPerl, which was just put together for Adam Kennedy's recent beer challenge; it's just the core modules; so it won't meet everyone's requirements.<br><br>I'm currently just sending as many rt.cpan bug reports as I can, with the hope of getting as many modules as possible working on windows with cpan.pm, rather than start maintaining yet-another perl distro.

Ah, so <em> <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/Alias/journal/28462" title="perl.org">that</a perl.org> </em> is where I heard the name before. It all clicks together, now.

Off topic I know but: Any ideas on how to use MinGW and dmake to compile Apache under Windows?<br><br>ron@savage.net.au
