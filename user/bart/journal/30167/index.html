<h2>Anomaly</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/pudge/">pudge</a> on 2006-07-04T16:18:05</h3>
This is clearly an anomaly.  The guy will not have to pay a fine, will not go to jail.  He will, easily, win in court, since he violated no law.  What a surprise that police officers are sometimes either overzealous or ignorant of the law (if they were really smart, they'd be lawyers, after all).<br><br>Same thing goes for your other links.  Yes, it's terrible that people are asking for info on the NY Times editors' children.  And it was also terrible when leftwingers similarly went after Rush Limbaugh.  Your voting facts page is incredibly uninteresting, a bunch of cherry-picked facts that amount to nothing.<br><br>Jimmy Carter, who undermined Bill Clinton's talks with North Korea in the 90s (doing what many Democrats at the time thought was treason), has no business telling anyone about national security.<br><br>Bush has been more often upheld than not by the Supreme Court; it seems odd to claim that one decision against him proves he is way over the line (and saying he is a war criminal because the Supreme Court  found his policy violated the Geneva Conventions shows about as much understanding of law as the cop who arrested the guy with the t-shirt; that's not actually how law works).<br><br>I have a ton of things to say about the freedom of the press, but I'll just note authoritatively that the Media Matters piece is completely full of crap.  It is lying about what people are actually calling for (this is only about classified information, not any other information about government), and ignoring the facts of what actually happens (reporters have *always* had the legal obligation to reveal sources, and it's always been enforced in cases like this, when necessary to find the source).<br><br>And thanks for the link that said, "That the United States, once touted as the 'world's greatest democracy,' is now ruled by a presidential dictatorship is a fact beyond any serious dispute."  The only part that's correct there is that there is no serious dispute, because anyone who calls it a dictatorship clearly is not a serious person.<br><br>Also, that "piece of paper" has nothing to do with the government.  That is a private decision by the person renting the gun.  Similarly, he is taking on all responsibility for whatever you do with the gun he is renting to you, so if he doesn't want to check your ID, he's taking a pretty big risk, but it is his to take.<br><br>But the best part of all this is that you and others claim that Bush is a dictator who cannot be trusted, and yet you<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... want him to have control of our guns.  That's entirely backwards.  It is because of the possibility of tyranny of the government that our right to bear arms, free from government intervention, is so important.<br>

<p>You don&#8217;t think that the fact that a police officer thought they should arrest someone with such a t-shirt, or the fact that the only thing the gun vendor wanted to cover his ass about is whether a machine gun will be used for propaganda, is indicative of a certain political climate? If these outliers are really meaningless, how come noone would even think of doing something like that in another country, or for that matter why did these things not used to happen in the US 10 years ago?</p>

<p>(Note that I&#8217;m making no assertion about whether they imply anything about actual politics.)</p>

It is far more likely he simply does not want to be involved in such a movie.<br><br>As to the former, no, I don't think it is the political climate, but it is the social climate.  But so what?  We live in a new world now, and we all need to adjust, including the cops.  They need to be better educated (and perhaps getting smacked down in court is one way to do that).<br><br><em>how come noone would even think of doing something like that in another country</em><br><br>You're joking, right?<br><br><em>or for that matter why did these things not used to happen in the US 10 years ago?</em><br><br>No matter what you point to, we have far fewer and less egregious incidents of this now than we did the last time the U.S. was at war.  Take a look into the DNC convention in '68, Kent State, and so on.  If you just step back and take a little bit of perspective, you'll quite clearly see that things are not nearly as bad as they were the last time.<br>

Or maybe it has too many qualifiers, like "noone."<br><br>We see far worse abridgments of freedom all over the world.  Saying someone cannot wear a t-shirt -- which, again, was a clear violation of the law by the apparently ignorant police officer, but still -- is nothing compared to what is done every day in most Islamic countries, nothing compared to Cuba or China, and does not even approach what happens every day in North Korea, which is without a doubt the most oppressive regime on the face of the planet.<br><br>So too is this IMO not as bad as what happens in the UK, where libel laws are extremely liberal (in favor of the supposedly defamed), or much of the rest of Western Europe and Canada (esp. Germany), with their insane hate speech laws (and while I understand the reasons for them [WWII], that doesn't make them OK).<br><br>This is one guy who was arrested and will easily have the charge thrown out by any court, and you're implying that's worse than the abridgments of free speech in all these other countries that actually <em>are</em> sanctioned and enforced by their respective governments, with people -- yes, even in Western Europe -- thrown in jail for months for saying something unpopular (such as the anti-gay preacher in Sweden; thankfully, his conviction was overturned, but it had to go all the way to the Supreme Court for that to happen, unlike this case, where it won't get past the trial court).<br>

<p>We have a climate of idiocy about the law and freedom, but I don't consider that "political" (as in showing anything in particular about the Bush administration, for example).  Here in Texas we've had near absolute rights regarding homeschooling for nearly two decades (the law even grants a parent to pull a child out of a single class if they disagree with their child receiving the instruction) and there are still officials who harrass and intimidate those who use the right.  It's not right-wingers alone that have caused this.  Nor is it a climate of complete (or even majority) idiocy: the vast majority of officials have some vague idea that we are entitled to freedom.</p>

<p>Honestly I blame the public schools for it a lot more than I blame the Bush administration.</p>

<p><blockquote><div>He will, easily, win in court, since he violated no law.</div></blockquote>Interesting.  When did you become a judge?
<p><blockquote><div>police officers are sometimes either overzealous or ignorant of the law</div></blockquote>Yes, that's why we have courts.  Except when the administration decides it's higher than them.
<p><blockquote><div>And it was also terrible when leftwingers similarly went after Rush Limbaugh.</div></blockquote> Terrible?  Really? How so?  Care to back that up with facts instead of innuendo, like typical sleazy right-winger writing?
<p><blockquote><div>that's not actually how law works</div></blockquote>Again, your court?
<p><blockquote><div>anyone who calls it a dictatorship clearly is not a serious person</div></blockquote>Thank you for the <i>ad homimem</i> attack.  No, it's not a dictatorship.  It's a tyranny.  An administration that has grabbed power way above and beyond what the constitution has approved.  It's one who's claimed private rights to privacy don't exist, regardless of what's on those silly law books.  But don't let law and rights stop you.  You're on a roll.  Sadly, you're typical.
<p><blockquote><div>We're conservatives, we're in power, we make the laws.  There is no loyal opposition: if you're against us, you're a traitor.</div></blockquote>That's how it goes, correct?

<em>Interesting. When did you become a judge?</em><br><br>I don't understand this apparent non sequitur.  What does being a judge have to do with understanding this simple and widely understood aspect of U.S. law?<br><br><em>Yes, that's why we have courts. Except when the administration decides it's higher than them.</em><br><br>Um<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... huh?  When did that ever happen?  (Hint: it hasn't.  At least, not by any President in your lifetime.)<br><br><em>Terrible? Really? How so?

Do you really not know of the smear campaign against Limbaugh when he got addicted to painkillers?<br><br><em>Again, your court?</em><br><br>Again: non sequitur.<br><br><em>Thank you for the ad homimem attack.</em><br><br>It was a statement of fact.  Calling what the U.S. has a dictatorship is like saying that North Korea has a liberal democracy.  It's not remotely accurate.<br><br><em>No, it's not a dictatorship. It's a tyranny.</em><br><br>That's also obviously false.  The U.S. does not nearly approach absolute power vested in a single individual.  You clearly have no idea what you're talking about.<br><br><em>An administration that has grabbed power way above and beyond what the constitution has approved.</em><br><br>That's your opinion; unfortunately for that opinion, the Supreme Court has ruled in the President's favor on the majority of Presidential power cases it's heard so far.<br><br><em>It's one who's claimed private rights to privacy don't exist</em><br><br>Really? How so? Care to back that up with facts instead of innuendo, like typical sleazy left-winger writing?<br><br><em>We're conservatives, we're in power, we make the laws.

<p>The significance of that whole incident was, to me, the outing of a hypocrite. Perhaps (probably) he was selectively targeted, but the charges were dismissed and he didn't go to jail, so the justice system works...sometimes...if you've got enough money (and a good lawyer)<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>
