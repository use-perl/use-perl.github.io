<p>Today, when browsing through the popular sites of the day, I found several sites where the author found it necessary to sneer at Perl, where it wasn't even the subject of the post. And I wasn't even searching for it. Is this the new custom?

<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.vector-seven.com/2008/01/23/gtk-hello-world-in-six-different-languages/">
GTK Hello World in Six Different Languages</a> 
<p>This is actually the least worrisome of the lot:
<blockquote>Although I find writing Perl to be painful for everything but processing text files in a terminal, I found the Perl GTK bindings to be relatively straightforward.</blockquote>

<li><a href="http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2007/06/rich-programmer-food.html">
"If you don't know how compilers work, then you don't know how computers work"</a><p> Steve Yegge writes:
<blockquote>You discover that jsdoc is a miserable sod of a Perl script that seg faults on about 50% of your code base, and &mdash; bear with me here &mdash; you've vowed never to write another line of Perl, because, well, it's Perl. Pick your favorite reason.</blockquote>
<li><a href="http://blogs.tedneward.com/2008/01/24/Can+Dynamic+Languages+Scale.aspx">
Can Dynamic Languages Scale?</a>
<p>This is by far the worst of the lot, gratuitous Perl bashing:
<blockquote>It's as Marx said, lo these many years ago: "From each language, according to its abilities, to each project, according to its needs."
<p>Oh, except Perl. Perl just sucks, period. :-)
</blockquote>
</ol>
These people don't appear to even know Perl, or at least, don't appear to know it well enough.

<p>Just stop it, please. It's not funny.

<h2>One correction</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/btilly/">btilly</a> on 2008-01-25T02:52:40</h3>
Steve Yegge actually does know Perl fairly well.  He just hates the language.  However he's favorably impressed with Perl programmers.



<h2>and how does that make you feel?</h2>

<p>What exactly about their badmouthing bothers you?
Do you feel you should be compensated for loss of income?</p> <p><div class="quote"> <b>libel</b> 1) <i>n.</i> to publish in print (including pictures), writing or broadcast through radio, television or film, an untruth about another which will do harm to that person or his/her reputation, by tending to bring the target into ridicule, hatred, scorn or contempt of others. Libel is the written or broadcast form of defamation, distinguished from slander which is oral defamation. It is a tort (civil wrong) making the person or entity (like a newspaper, magazine or political organization) open to a lawsuit for damages by the person who can prove the statement about him/her was a lie.</div>  <p>
Or are you trying to enforce honesty and integrity in blogs? Or maybe participating in a mission of an elite Perl counter-troll special forces team? In denial since Perl obviously does suck and you have been brainwashed for all these years?

His point is that it makes the authors look stupid, for absolutely no reason.
<p>
I tried bashing another language on my blog once.  It made me look like a moronic childish idiot.  I learned my lesson and now only talk about things I'm qualified to talk about.  Amazingly my blog is actually useful reading now.  (Yeah yeah, pipe down there you in the back.)  Instead of hype, lies, and FUD, I write about facts and things that I know about.  What a concept!</p>

Thanks for the vote of confidence, but the truth is actually not as noble or well thought of.<br><br>My first response was one of anger, next of sadness. It's just getting hopeless.<br><br>But indeed, I do have real trouble taking these authors seriously any more. You were right about that. I do indeed get the feeling as if they are clueless, and not just about Perl. They will need to bring in a lot more evidence to convince me of the opposite, than they would have otherwise.<br>

Good to be popular. Remember, ANY press is Good press.

Howdy,<br><br>I didn't mean to imply that there was anything *wrong* with Perl. Generally speaking, it *does* irk me but I've never assumed that to be anything but a personal preference. I've actually found Perl to be quite useful for a couple of tasks at work - but as I said in my post on GTK+, that has always been for text processing and manipulation. For everything else, I've found better languages for the task at hand.<br><br>Anyway, sorry to elicit such a reaction. I'll try to be a little more sensitive next time around<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:P
