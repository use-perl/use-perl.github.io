<h1>Installing Wx on ActivePerl 5.8.9</h1>

<div class="span8">
<p><p>Two days ago, after successfully installing <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Alien::wxWidgets">Alien::wxWidgets</a>, <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Wx">Wx</a> and <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Wx::Demo">Wx::Demo</a> on Strawberry Perl, with a bit of trouble and a lot oit f time, I was curious to see how <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Wx::Demo">Wx::Demo</a> works on ActivePerl, and if it shows the same screwed up result in the wxComboCtrl demo. (For the impatient: it does.)</p>

<p>ActivePerl has <code>PPM</code>, right? So this should be a piece of cake. Let me see... Uh, nothing. Ooh yes, I forgot to add repositories. I'll add my favorites: TCool, Bribes, Trouchelle, UWinnipeg.</p>

<p>Good, now both <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Alien::wxWidgets">Alien::wxWidgets</a> and <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Wx">Wx</a> appear. Smooth, in less than a few minutes, both are installed. Now to check, run</p>

<pre><code>perl -MWx -le "print Wx-&gt;VERSION"
</code></pre>

<p>Uh oh...  I get a Windows dialog box telling me some DLL (I forgot its exact name, something with "custom" in its name) can't be found, and the above command line just produces a syntax error, saying the module can't be loaded.</p>

<p>What next? Well, ActivePerl now supports the MinGW compiler, and I've got one installed as it came with the Strawberry distro... just add "<code>c:\strawberry\c\bin</code>" back to <code>PATH</code>, and I'm good to go.</p>

<p>So, uninstall Wx again, and try to install it with <code>CPAN</code>. Wait a minute, now it says I don't have a (usable) <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Alien::wxWidgets">Alien::wxWidgets</a>? But I installed 0.45 with PPM? Aargh! So if you install <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Alien::wxWidgets">Alien::wxWidgets</a> with PPM, you <em>can't use</em> it to install <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Wx">Wx</a> with <code>CPAN</code>, and that's the main purpose of that module! Right, uninstall that too, and install it with <code>CPAN</code>, too.</p>

<p>I was not expecting a smooth ride with <code>CPAN</code>, and that's exactly what I've got. Installing in one go didn't work, obviously, so I broke it down into smaller tasks installing troublesome dependencies first. That did go smoothly, apart from one module that failed tests: <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Module::Build">Module::Build</a>. I don't get why a module that is seen by many as the future of <code>CPAN</code>, can be so much trouble. I assumed it would work well enough, so I <code>force install</code>ed it.</p>

<p>Installing <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Alien::wxWidgets">Alien::wxWidgets</a> took... forever. I gave up waiting and went doing something else, even forgetting all about it. I was surprised to see, accidently stumbling back to this console window, that it was still actively chugging along. Anyway, it tested smoothly, and installed with no problems.</p>

<p>Installing <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Wx">Wx</a> next, went a lot faster. In a matter of minutes it was installed. Well, sortof... 

<p>I got some trouble trying to open <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Wx">Wx</a>. Even just "<code>look Wx</code>" tried to unpack the package, ending in the error message</p>

<pre>gzip: stdout: broken pipe
</pre>

<p><code>CPAN</code> barfing and refusing to open a shell.</p>

<p>I assume this implies that pipe between the external <code>gzip</code> and <code>tar</code> program are probably treated in text mode by mistake; maybe that my ports of these programs are broken. But replacing the <a href="http://unxutils.sourceforge.net/">UnxUtils</a> programs with those from <a href="http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/">GnuWin32</a> offers no improvement whatsoever.</p>

<p>Strawberry Perl didn't have that problem. Let me see what's in its "<code>o conf</code>" settings... a space?? In ActivePerl's <code>CPAN</code>, both are empty. How can you do that...</p>

<pre>o conf gzip ' '
o conf tar ' '
</pre>

<p>That works. I don't know what it means, I assume it now will try to use Perl modules instead of external programs, but at least, it no longer produces a broken pipe. That's what matters.</p>

<p>And now: no more broken pipe!</p>

<p>There was a problem with <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?ExtUtils::XSpp">ExtUtils::XSpp</a>, which refused to be installed as a dependency, it looks like it didn't even try (??), so I had to install that manually, and retry.</p>

<p>Argh, <code>CPAN</code>, I hate you! If in the <code>CPAN</code> shell, some step in the build process fails, and you retry, it'll happily assume that step worked and go to the next step, and then croak. Exiting <code>CPAN</code> and relaunching it is often enough to really make it start over, but sometimes you may have to manually delete the built files.</p>

<p>Anyway, installing <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Wx">Wx</a> finally worked. So did installing <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Wx::Demo">Wx::Demo</a>. Running the demos shows that it all worked.</p>

<p>Conclusion: <strong>yes</strong>, you <em>can</em> install Wx on ActivePerl and the MinGW C compiler, but it'll take a lot of time, and some kicking of the (<code>CPAN</code>) engine in strategic spots.</p>

<p><a name="wxcomboctrl"></a>Oh, and yes, the combo control shows the exact same weird behavior as it did in Strawberry Perl, here's a <a href="http://users.pandora.be/bartl/perl/WxPerl_demo_wxComboCtrl_oops.png">screenshot</a> to show what I mean). I'm curious to hear if it works better on other platforms than Windows it does. I'm trying to decide if it's a bug in <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Wx">Wx</a>, or in <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Wx::Demo">Wx::Demo</a>, and if it's tied to the platform. </p>

<p>p.s. Just earlier today I found there's a PPM repository on WxPerl's own site. Aargh! Well, it was an interesting experience anyway. And now I've got Wx version 0.93, which is a bit more recent than the version on that repository (0.89)... :)</p></p>
