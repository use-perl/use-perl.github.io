<h1>Why is CPAN.pm such a pig?</h1>

<div class="span8">
<p><p>Running the CPAN shell on ActivePerl 5.8.x on Windows XP, I can see in <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/default.aspx">Process Explorer</a> that the bare CPAN shell uses a whopping 195MB of RAM (size of working set: 120MB). I mean... wauw!!</p>

<p>That does not even include the programs, including perl, that are invoked from <code>make</code>, that actually test or install stuff. No, just the bare shell.</p>

<p>WTF is going on? Does the CPAN shell perhaps try to keep the whole module database in RAM? And if so: why? It's not as if looking up a distro by module name is <em>so</em> system critical, that it requires a sub-millisecond response time. So a slightly slower system, that greps through the data on file, would work just as well.</p>

<p>Fact is: memory consumption is 3 times lower before the metadata is first loaded. And it doesn't ever go down again... (As if it could.)</p>

<p>CPAN is now using several times more RAM than the average computer had, when CPAN.pm first came out. I doubt it used that much RAM, in those days.</p>

<p>p.s. For some bizarre reason, Strawberry Perl 5.10.x uses "only" 120MB. I have no idea why.</p></p>

Yes, that's how it does some of the query commands it implements. It has been so for a long time now. And yes, under-powered computers may have problems with that. (But it can be worse - CPANPLUS is much heavier or at least was, a long time ago when I tried it.)
</p><p>
CPAN.pm has an experimental support for the module database in a SQLite db, as implemented by CPAN::SQLite. It decreases the memory consumption. You can try that.

It's been also quite a long time since I've looked at how much RAM CPANPLUS takes, but the last time I did, it was raking an impressive 500M.  Which, of course, makes it almost impossible to use interactively on the 512M of RAM of my poor machine.  </p>

<p>CPANPLUS uses far less on my machine, but YMMV; for those strapped for ram, there's the option to use an SQLite backend.</p><p>To enable it, simply follow the following steps from the default shell:</p><p>### set SQLite as the backend<br>CPAN Terminal&gt; s conf source_engine CPANPLUS::Internals::Source::SQLite</p><p>### update any dependencies (will install sqlite drivers if you need them)<br>CPAN Terminal&gt; s selfupdate dependencies</p><p>### save configuration<br>CPAN Terminal&gt; s save</p>

<h2>What Strawberry does</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Alias/">Alias</a> on 2009-02-11T23:59:30</h3>
<p>Strawberry comes bundled with CPAN::SQLite on by default, which is why it uses less memory.</p><p>This still has problems though, because the process that fills up the SQLite database loads the entire database into memory ANYWAY, instead of processing streamwise.</p>

Ah, I already thought I saw a different behaviour pattern in memory usage for Strawberry Perl: the bulk of memory is not used by the CPAN shell script, but by a script launched from it, for loading the database. The latter script uses up to 120-150MB, which is already better, but yet better still because the script exits after half a minute or so. The CPAN shell itself uses less: 60MB virtual (35MB working set). It still is a lot, but at least, it's already 3 times less than the default in ActivePerl.

<h2>Small Device Issue</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/awwaiid/">awwaiid</a> on 2009-02-12T16:28:46</h3>
<p>I ran into this as a problem when using CPAN on my openmoko (Debian), which has only 128mb of ram. It only seemed to be a problem the first time I ran cpan, after that it seems better.</p><p>But for that first time I had to shut down everything (X-Windows, phone services, etc) to get it working.</p>
