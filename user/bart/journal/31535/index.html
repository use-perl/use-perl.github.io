<p>This one is straight from the top of the popular links on <a href="http://reddit.com">Reddit</a>, a Slashdot comment actually worth bookmarking: <a href="http://developers.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=204433&threshold=1&commentsort=0&mode=thread&cid=16701433">What I hate about PHP</a>. The guy knows PHP very well, because he uses it full time on his job, and he insists, and rightly so, that you must know the traits of your tools very intimately, both good and bad, in order to use them most effectively. <br/><br/>So this isn't just an uninformed rant. IT's so easy to make one of those.</p>

Practically everything he says here could apply to Perl, Ruby, Python, etc. as practiced by the average coder.  His complaint about the "works for me" approach is not language-specific.  He's really talking about the culture that has grown up around the language.

But as I read it, he's not talking about the average coder, but about the implementation. What you say is as if we'd judge Perl by the average beginning coder that still goes to use the old junk from Matt's Script Archive.<br><br>No, this is about the implementors. And Perl is better in that regard. We have people who care about stuff working right, such as sub attributes, even if only 10 people in the world are actually using it. Gee, I don't know how many people do use attributes, but I am guessing it's far less than 1 in 100.<br><br>That's a lot better than "buggy by design", which seems typical for PHP.

Indeed. What he's arguing for is, in essence, what Perl (mostly) gets right.<br><br>That even if there's a dozen ways to do something, there should be A way that is a robustly correct solution to general classes problems, that is available, recommended, and isn't cumbersome to use.<br><br>Think DBI and ? placeholders.<br><br>You don't have to use them, but they are simple to use, strongly recommended, and solve the entire class of SQL injection attacks.<br>
