<p>I've just got a new job. Starting next week, I'll be working for <a href="http://www.airstop.be">Airstop.be</a>, which is one of the most important ecommerce websites in Belgium, IMO, allowing you to search for, and buy, cheap airline tickets from many sources. They're looking to expand what they offer to the public.<br/><br/>The work (on the backend, behind the website) would mostly be in PL-SQL/Oracle, but I get the impression that anything that gets the job done, is OK.<br/><br/>And of the utmost importance to me, is the atmosphere in the office. The people I've met so far all seem to be very likable people, so I think I'm in paradise, there.</p>

Working with the right people can make all the difference in the world.<br><br>One of the best jobs I have ever had was working at a retail store for minimum wage ($4.25 USD/hr at the time) because of the people I worked with.<br><br>Again - grats!<br>L~R

Two of my best jobs were working for minimum wage at the Science Museum of Minnesota and for much more than that at a large data storage company. In both cases it was the people that made it an awesome place.

I never said it was minimum wage. It isn't. But the money is not what makes me want to take on a job offer.

It was LR that mentioned minimum wage.
