<p><a href="http://perlmonks.org?node=ysth">ysth</a> pointed me towards the Google Groups Stats for &lt;comp.lang.perl.misc&gt;. According to those, I'm the <a href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/comp.lang.perl.misc/about">7th most active poster of all time</a> in that group. Wow. 
<P>That's still my old email address (slightly mangled), BTW, I've switched provider several years ago. If you actually <a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?as_ugroup=comp.lang.perl.misc&amp;as_uauthors=Bart%20Lateur">do an advanced search for my name</a>,
Google Groups finds about 7300 posts by me &mdash; which is actually even higher than the number of posts by their
listed top poster! 
<P>But as I'm not the only one changing email address
now and then, the other people's count may be quite a bit higher than listed, too.
So I'll not jump to conclusions.
<P>Other names in that list I think I recognize are Larry Rosler (1), Tom Phoenix (3), Anno Siegel (4), gellyfish(5), Tom Christiansen (6), nobull (8), Benjamin Goldberg (9), Tad MacLellan (10). I have no idea on number 2.
<P>So where is <a href="http://groups-beta.google.com/groups?q=group%3Acomp.lang.perl.misc+author%3ARandal+author%3ASchwartz">merlyn</a>?  He shows up with 3450 posts, which is just a bit too low for the top 10. He actually has about 1.1/2 times that many posts on <a href="http://perlmonks.org/?node=merlyn">Perlmonks</a>.
<p>According to the <a href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/comp.lang.perl.misc/about">same stats</a>, the frequency of posts in that group have indeed seriously declined since the highdays, which apparently were around 1999-2000. Anybody else remember the <a href="http://groups-beta.google.com/groups?as_q=fat+alaskan+electrician&as_ugroup=comp.lang.perl.misc">"Fat Alaskan Electrician"</a>, from back then? Ah, how the time flies...
<p><b>Update</b>: I <em>knew</em> I shouldn't jump to conclusions. A <a href="http://groups-beta.google.com/groups?q=group%3Acomp.lang.perl.misc+author%3AAbigail">search for Abigail</a> finds around 9100 posts! But he changes email addresses quite often, that's why he doesn't show up in these stats, that are grouped by email address, not by name, or (ideally) by person.</p>

<h2>Number 2...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ethan/">ethan</a> on 2005-04-15T06:07:49</h3>
...is Tad MacLellan, too. So if he's on the 10th spot as well, that would make him the all-time top poster with close to 10.000 postings.



<h2>Back in the day</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/brian_d_foy/">brian_d_foy</a> on 2005-04-16T17:03:59</h3>
Somehow I don't beleive those numbers<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br> <br>I have about 3,800 posts under my name and another 3,800 under "PerlFAQ server". I think those numbers are a bit low, though.  Back when DejaNews was around I graphed my activity and came up with more than that under my name.<br> <br>Back in the day, the entire Stonehenge crew (myself, Randal, Tom P. and Tad) used to be in the Top 10 posters list that Greg Bacon posted.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
