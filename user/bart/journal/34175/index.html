<div class="span8">
<p>As you may well know, in modern releases of ActivePerl 5.8.x, ActiveState has provided automatic support for (free) alternative C compilers to build XS modules in. I've been doing that for a while now... but I had no idea how hard it is these days, to install them both from scratch.<br/><br/>It's now the second time in about a month time, that I'm doing this. This time, I took extra care to carefully remove old installations, so I can safely say I'm doing a blank install. The only thing I already have, is MS nmake, and it's in PATH.<br/><br/>First I'm installing MinGW. Boy has that become easy! Just go to the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=2435">MinGW download page</a>, get the installer (MinGW-5.1.3.exe, the top link in the table), and run it. Choose what you want installed, and it'll just fetch the archives and install them. Wow. There's no longer a need for a "metre of beer" contest, this is just too simple.<br/><br/>The previous time I installed ActivePerl (build 820) I had a few problems &mdash; solvable, but problems nevertheless. This time, most (all?) of these glitches seem to have gone. That is good news.<br/><br/>I'm still using Win98 on my secondary computer, the primary being an XP laptop. Last time, I had problems running scripts (PPM, perldoc, CPAN) straight from the command line. It refused to run, the only error message I got was "syntax error", which doesn't sound like a Perl error message. I could still run it using<br/><br/><pre>
perl -S PPM
</pre><br/><br/>so I think it may have been related to something pl2bat did. I thought the resulting scripts were Unix text files, or mixed half Unix text files, half Windows text files. But that seems to have been fixed, it works now.<br/><br/>Next test: CPAN. The previous time building XS files didn't work out of the box, I got weird C compiler errors. After some hours of digging and finally fixing the problem, I found out on ActiveState's bug tracking system it <a href="http://bugs.activestate.com/show_bug.cgi?id=69343">had already been solved months earlier</a>. What the...? But, looking at the <a href="http://ftp.activestate.com/ActivePerl/src/5.8/AP822_diff.txt">patch list for this build</a>, it looks like Jan Dubois has  <a href="http://bugs.activestate.com/show_bug.cgi?id=69025">followed his own advice</a>, as all compiler related values have been disabled in configpm, the Perl script that in the source distribution is used to build Config.pm. That implies that now, at least, MinGW <em>should</em> be able to build XS modules out of the box. Excellent.<br/><br/>Except: the version of CPAN.pm that comes with it (1.9102), is broken. It complains about an unimplemented flock call. So I downgraded CPAN.pm by copying the previous version out of the older distribution (1.7602). Did I mention I use the AS distro, not the MSI file? I do. It's a plain ZIP file with a relocation script. Nice and transparent for cases like this. After undergoing a bit of panicking by CPAN.pm about the <code>.lock</code> file, and manually deleting it a few times, it finally ran.<br/><br/>I had to first manually add the bin directory for MinGW to my PATH, because ActivePerl didn't see my gcc. Perhaps that is better in XP &mdash; the mechanism to permanently set environment variables is different there. <br/><br/>But then, MinGW can indeed build XS modules out of the box. I tried Text::CSV_XS, HTML::Parser, DBI, and DBD::SQLite as test cases; only DBI had some tests fail but I suppose that is, again, because of the platform. There were some complaints about flock not being implemented.<br/><br/>All in all, things are looking good &mdash; except that the included CPAN version refuses to work on Win98. But you probably will not have that problem on XP.</p>

<h2>Good to see they are starting to catch up...</h2>

... but I still think it's faster and safer to just<br><br>1. Download Strawberry<br>2. Run Installer<br>3. Click Next once or twice and wait 10 seconds<br><br>That said, we don't officially support Win98, so I have no idea what sort of behaviour it would exhibit.<br>
