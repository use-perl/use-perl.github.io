<div class="span8">
<p>On one of my PCs, I have upgraded my Firefox browser to 2.0, a few weeks ago. I can't say that, apart from details, I notice much of a difference. Which is not necessarily a bad thing...<br/><br/>But the developers behind Firefox should learn the difference between a crash, and a system shutdown. Because every single time I first open the browser, an annoying dialog box pops up asking me if I want to restore the previous session. It won't go away without clicking on a button first, and it just blocks the working of the browser. Even when I click "new session" the browser forgot the argument (either an URL or the path to a html page) Firefox got opened with, and simply opens on the homepage. Argh!<br/><br/>And if they think restoring the last session is such a cool feature, why don't they just add it as a menu item, in the system menu? So that you can still restore a session even after they closed the browser normally?</p>

<p>Which OS are you using and how are you closing Firefox?</p>

<p>I'm on Ubuntu and find that it behaves itself if I close Firefox with File &gt; Quit, but not if I just log out of the OS leaving Firefox running.</p>

<p><div class="quote">Which OS are you using and how are you closing Firefox?</div> Whenever I say "PC", I mean it in the traditional sense: a Windows box. Sorry for the confusion. And by shutting down, I mean using ALt-F4 in Explorer, or by using the "shut down" button in the Start menu.<p><div class="quote">I'm on Ubuntu and find that it behaves itself if I close Firefox with File &gt; Quit, but not if I just log out of the OS leaving Firefox running.</div> Hmm, if I'm not mistaking, that sounds like the same problem...<br><br>On Windows, if I tell the OS to shut down, it sends a different message to the open windows, than when you just close a window. But anyway, a message gets sent, something that obviously doesn't happen in a crash. It <em>is</em> a normal way to terminate a program.<br><br>

You shut your computer down?

LOL. Yes, every day. Because, well, it saves on energy. Lots of it, some people claim. Several of those people switch off their TV because even the stand by mode takes up a lot of energy (= money), for nothing.<br><br>And second: I want to give the computer a rest. I've had a hard disk break down after a few months of being on for 24 hours a day, because it has been warm for too long.<br><br>I don't use my computer for more than 12-15 hours every day. And then, I shut it down. If I'm just gone for an hour or so, I leave it on.<br><br>
