<p>Earlier today, at 17:50 on August 23 2005 CEST, my son Lars was born. He's my second child. <br/><br/>Everything just went so fast... it all had only started less than 3 hours earlier. We've had to let an ambulance come, it was too late to get there by our own means. And most of the birth largely took place in the ambulance. It was almost like in the movies. A few more minutes in the emergency room, and it was all over.<br/><br/>Still, I was barely nervous. After all, I fekt like I do know the drill already. If this had been my first child, I would have been a wreck.<br/><br/>We didn't plan on having a second child. Neither of us isn't <em>that</em> young any more, but when it turned out that the Mrs. was pregnant, neither of us had any doubt: we were to keep the baby.<br/><br/>My first son, Ian, is 5.1/2 years old now. He's over the moon, he's been wanting to be the bigger brother for a long time already. When I asked him whether he found it strange to have a little brother now, he looked at me as if to ask "what are you asking me now?" No, of course it's not strange. It's just normal.<br/><br/>I wonder if he'll stay as happy with the situation as he is now, when he finds out a baby doesn't actually do anything he can consider exciting... like play with him. We'll see, eventually.<br/><br/>p.s. Ooh I forgot the oldfashioned measurements. He measured 49 cm and weighed 2900grams. Almost identical to his brother.</p>

Named after anyone in particular?  Are you a <a href="http://gnus.org/" title="gnus.org">Gnus</a gnus.org> user?

No, I didn't choose the name. The Mrs. just loved the name, and I agreed. He's not named after <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/073581080X/" title="amazon.com">the Little Polar Bear</a amazon.com> either. Because that's what my other son asked: "Why are you naming him after a polar bear?" We didn't. He's not named after anybody or anything. It's just Lars.

From what I understand (and I admit that child rearing has, for me, been solely a spectator sport), you might want to research colic.<p>
Can you hold a baby in one arm and code with the other?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p><p>

First - congrats to bart and mrs bart. As for the colic, wrapping papoose style worked wonders for our fussy infant (which being first time parents we thought was colic until we saw what *real* colic was). And I can atest, holding a tightly wrapped baby in one hand and coding with the other is possible but not fun!.
