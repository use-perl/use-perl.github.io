<p>In the last few weeks, I've seen Google drop a few stitches. 
<ol><li>In the customization for the searches, Google only allows me to choose between one language, or any language. Whenever you choose more than one language, like Dutch and English pages in my case, it remembers only one.
<li><URL:http://news.google.com> appears to be lobsided on which news sources it collects. Worse, their PR gives <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/12/08/bharat_turing_test/">less than satisfactory excuses</a>.
<li>People have been less than enthousiastic about the new interface of <URL:http://groups.google.com>. Personally I don't really spot much of a difference, yet. Well, some people also complained of messages that didn't appear, or if they did, with an enormous delay.
<li>But: since recently, <URL:http://groups.google.com> starts to <a href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/comp.lang.perl.misc/browse_thread/thread/b8c32dab9dba0162?safe=images&as_umsgid=1102538922.266321.214570@z14g2000cwz.googlegroups.com">mess up your formatting</a>. Argh, they do make it virtually impossible to link to a particular message, and no idea what the link should, in its canonical form, look like. And where are the threads, why is everything flat?
</ol>
<P>Is this a trend? I just hope they eventually clean up their act.
<p>p.s. On a sidenote, Amazon is making more than just a few blunders itself lately, too. <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/12/08/amazon_probs_continue/">No sales at all for a whole day?</a> *boggle*
<P>p.s. point (1) appears to be fixed. Good.

<h2>Code unification?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/schwern/">schwern</a> on 2004-12-09T10:28:02</h3>
I'm going to take a guess here and say what's likely going on behind the scenes is someone had the bright idea to unify the GMail and Groups code.  Since they both display threads of messages it doesn't seem like such a bad idea... maybe.<br> <br>No, I'm not happy with the new Groups either.



<h2>New Google groups...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/zatoichi/">zatoichi</a> on 2004-12-09T18:11:47</h3>
I happen to like the new format a lot. I really like that posts no longers take hours but minutes.
