<div class="span8">
<p>I don't like it how business find hidden ways to raise prices of goods, in a way that it doesn't look like a price rise at all. A realistic example is a bouquet of flowers, where suddenly you only get 9 flowers for the same price that you got 12 for, the week before. That's a price increase of 33%!<br/><br/>Likewise, <a href="http://proxis.be">proxis.be</a> is an online bookstore, like Amazon but on a small, Belgian scale. I last ordered a children's book there for &euro;12.50, two years ago, and handling and postage was free. I remember that that was the minimum amount: if you ordered for less, you had to pay some postage, 1 to 2 Euro, I think. I can understand it, in a way. Still, the threshold was low enough to be the exception, not the common case.<br/><br/>And now I'm looking at buying something, again. The threshold has risen: now the minimum amount is &euro;25, that's twice as much as before, or you have to pay &euro;2 extra for postage. That is, to have the package delivered in <em>their outlet</em>, not even at your home.<br/><br/>Now, for many of the goods they sell, the price range &euro;12.50 to &euro;25 is very common: the normal CD, DVD and even many novels, fall in that range. <br/><br/>Now you have a choice: buy more than  one product at once, buy elsewhere, or pay &euro;2 extra.<br/><br/>I would think that they're hoping that many people do the latter, and pay the postage. It means more money for them. But I think it stinks.</p>

<h2>Update</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/bart/">bart</a> on 2005-11-29T22:31:15</h3>
I finally made an order the other day (multiple items, what would you expect), and <em>only then</em> they would give me the details on with what means a customer can pay, and where they can send the package. Bad idea for an e-commerce site, if you ask me. Anyway, it turns out a few details have changed since my last order, two years ago.<br><br>First of all, they no longer solely depend on <a href="http://kiala.be/" title="kiala.be">their own (more or less) distribution points</a kiala.be> where you can pick up your package. In addition, you can now get your package mailed home at no extra cost, instead. In that case, I can understand that they demand a minimum order of &euro;25.<br><br>But I think that when they use their own distribution channels, bypassing mail, the threshold should be lower. Like I said, I strongly feel it should be possible to order a CD, a DVD or a book with no postage costs, for a price below &euro;25, provided you pick it up at the distribution point.<br><br>Now, there's hardly any benefit to make use of Kiala, the only advantage left is that you can pay cash or with an ATM card. So I think it's not really surprising that the number of outlets has dropped considerably since last time: there's only 5 in the whole wide area of Ghent, where there used to be that many in a radius of just a few km around my house, before.<br><br>
