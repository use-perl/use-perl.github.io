<p>I stepped into a job center that'll remain unnamed for the time being, asking if they handled jobs for programmers. They just stared at me as if I had just asked them to get me the leading role in the musical Evita (and I am male). Within minutes, without going into any of my qualifications, they tried to convince me I was in the wrong place.<br/><br/>I just found a few ads online, by the very same people, for several jobs in IT.<br/><br/>I don't need this shit, from a girl that looked like she had dropped out of the humaniora ("highschool" for you Americans). <br/><br/>Jeezes.

<h2>job centres are pointless if you finished school</h2>

I don't think I've ever benefitted from using a job centre, not once when I was unemployed have they managed to get me an interview, let alone anything more. When getting help for disability benefits they even manage to screw up basic entitlement rules.<br><br>Of course, this is the way the government and the big corporations who outsource the minimum wage cleaning or chicken processing jobs want it. A steady supply of unqualified and unmotivated proles who'll accept minimum wage and take pointless noddy courses that you would be embarresed to send a child let alone an adult to.<br><br>I guess Belgium and the UK have that in common - yeay europe!



<h2>From my own experience</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Beatnik/">Beatnik</a> on 2006-03-28T07:34:48</h3>
When I was looking for a job last year, I sent out about 3-4 emails every day for about a month (7-8 over the weekend). Most were a response to job ads I found on popular job sites (I regulary checked 3-4 and picked out the ones that lookedmost fun). I had 2 job interviews arranged for me by a recruitement agency. They were pretty good on matching my profile with the 'customer' demands but in the end, I went for a company that I 'found' myself. In total, I talked to about 8 companies before signing. I have learned a lot about the whole looking-for-a-job process. It forces you to do a reality check.<br> <br>I have no experience with job centers though. Some belgian newspapers have weekly sections with specific industry ads.
