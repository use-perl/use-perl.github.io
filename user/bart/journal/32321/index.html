<p>This is a warning that is printed in the user manual for my new Toshiba flatscreen TV, right under the information on how to change the aspect ratio and image size of the picture, in case the automatically chosen setting isn't what you would have chosen:
<blockquote>Using the special functions to change the size of the displayed image (i.e. changing the height/width ratio) for the purpose of public display or commercial gain may infringe on copyright laws.</blockquote>

It sounds a lot like the line that the NFL was giving churches (prior to their reversal).<br/><br/><a href="http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;tab=wn&amp;q=NFL+big-screen&amp;btnG=Search" title="google.com">NFL big-screen</a google.com>



<h2>_a_a_a_a_</h2>

It doesn't seem to be to far fetched to me. I wouldn't be surprised some artist out there has won a some law suit after someone decided to cut of part of a painting, or modified a sculpture, etc. Changing the aspect ratio of a picture does modify it. And the USA being a society where people always look for a way to make one else responsible for their actions, the company put in the notice to avoid being sued for not warning them.

<h2>The notice is ridiculous.</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/DAxelrod/">DAxelrod</a> on 2007-02-06T21:31:54</h3>
The ridiculous part is that the company felt they needed to notify the customer of this. They shouldn't have to worry that they'd be liable if somebody broke the law and happened to be using their product.
