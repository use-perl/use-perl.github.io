<h1>Corrupt headers in Hotmail's bounce mails</h1>

<div class="span8">
<p>Lately I've been working on a script to parse and classify mails that come in after a bulk mail has been sent, most of them in the form of bounces. Of the roughly 2000 mails, 2 had corrupt headers. Guess where they both originated from? Oh, yeah, I already told you in the post title: hotmail.com.<br/><br/>The problem with these two mails is that in the middle of the mail headers, there's a blank line, followed by a line starting with "<tt>&#239;&#187;&#191;From: </tt>", thus, apart from the 3 garbage characters, it's the <em>real</em> "From:" line.<br/><br/>You would expect that a huge company under the umbrella would be capable of getting their stuff right. I think it's quite typical that they don't. Can't. Won't.<br/><br/>Can anybody explain what the origin of this garbage could be? I have no idea. In Perl, you can match it with <code>/\357\273\277/</code>.

<h2>Origin of those bytes</h2>

<p>Rewriting in hex notation makes those bytes a little more familiar:</p> <p><blockquote> <div><tt>$ perl -we 'printf "%02x %02x %02x\n", 0357, 0273, 0277'<br>ef bb bf</tt></div> </blockquote>  <p>If that&#8217;s still not familiar, Encode might help:</p> <p><blockquote> <div><tt>$ perl -MEncode -we 'printf "U+%04X\n", ord decode_utf8("\xef\xbb\xbf")'<br>U+FEFF</tt></div> </blockquote>  <p>And what&#8217;s U+FEFF?</p> <p><blockquote> <div><tt>$ perl -MUnicode::UCD=charinfo -lwe 'print charinfo(0xFEFF)-&gt;{name}'<br>ZERO WIDTH NO-BREAK SPACE</tt></div> </blockquote>  <p>It&#8217;s a zero-width non-breaking space, also known as a &#8220;byte-order mark&#8221;.  At the start of a document, a zero-width non-breaking space has no visual effect, so it was originally intended to allow programmatic distinction of little-endian and big-endian 16-bit encodings of Unicode.  (There&#8217;s guaranteed to be no Unicode character with the codepoint U+FFFE, so it&#8217;s safe to use it in that way.)  Eventually the same technique got applied to UTF-8, despite the fact that it doesn&#8217;t typically provide any benefits under UTF-8, and is often actively harmful.</p>

<p>So it seems that Hotmail&#8217;s server sometimes generates bounces that both are inappropriately in a non-US-ASCII encoding, and also inappropriately begin with a byte-order mark.  This is what would be technically described as a bug.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_Order_Mark" title="wikipedia.org">Wikipedia article on byte-order marks</a wikipedia.org> may be helpful.</p>

Sheesh, a UTF8 BOM marker, I'd never have thought in that direction.<p><div class="quote">despite the fact that it doesn&#8217;t typically provide any benefits under UTF-8</div> Well, it's a marker that the following text is in UTF8. So it may be somewhat useful, though of limited use.<br><br>Of course, it is completely out of place in mail headers.<br><br>But I'm still wondering about the extra newline in front of the mangled <code>From/code&gt; header. Did Hotmail put it there, or did an intermediate SMTP server see the mangled header, and separated it from the rest of the other, properly formed, headers above it?<br></code>
