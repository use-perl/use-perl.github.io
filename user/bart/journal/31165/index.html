<p>I sometimes get one of those little ideas while banging away on the keyboard, in the realm of "wouldn't it be nice if...". Usually, I forgot about them the next day and I rarely, if ever, think of it again... Or at the least, not for a few months. I can't ever think of those little ideas when people ask me what kind of features I'd like... So now, I'll write it down. As a reminder to myself, or maybe a bit of inspiration to you, who knows.
<p>Today, I was trying to write down an SQL insert statement. It took a huge amount of time, mainly because how it needs to be typed is so different from what it is based upon &mdash; and yet it's so very strictly coupled syntaxwise. Let me give an example. The statement could be something in the form of:
<pre>
insert into bloob (a, b c) values (x, y, z);
</pre>
Simple, no? until the field names and values are not so simple any more.
<p>Usually, the source is a description of a database table. Suppose you can get it into a form of tab delimited rows separated by newlines. In short: a plain tab delimited file. For this file the structure would look like:
<pre>
bloob
a        x
b        y
c        z
</pre>
All pretty standard, and likely, it's quite easy to get the data from other sources into this shape, using standard tools.
<p>Now, what I'd like to be able to, is to <em>paste this data into the shape of the SQL statement</em>, plain and simple. That is: it should make use of a template like, for example
<pre>
insert into $table (@fields) values (@values)
</pre>
given that array items would be joined by a comma (can be parameterized) and that there's a way to link the variables to the source data fields. It would be nice if extra formatting could be applied to each array item (as if with <code>map</code>) before it gets inserted &mdash; such as wrapping quotes around them.
<p>How? I don't know. I haven't thought that through yet.
<p>And no, I don't want to write a dedicated little script to do each specific case for me.
<p>If, by any chance, you know of an editor that has this or a similar feature, I'd like to know about it.</p>

<h2>Alternative: replace text by templated text</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/bart/">bart</a> on 2006-09-30T15:24:22</h3>
One could also use this alternative: select a piece of text, and apply a template to it. That could, for example, be used to replace an URL by a html link, thus replacing<blockquote> <div><tt>http://use.perl/org/</tt></div> </blockquote>with<blockquote> <div><tt>&lt;a href="http://use.perl/org/"&gt;http://use.perl/org/&lt;/a&gt;</tt></div> </blockquote>with the default text (here the URL) selected, ready to be overtyped by a different text.
<p>Or, supposing you have the database table data, formatted as described in the root post, as part of the text document, and you can select it, and apply the SQL-ifying template to it. I think it would be easier to use when you have, say, 5 of those tables and you have to write such an SQL statement for each of them.
</p><p>Taking one step further still, it's be nice if the "template" could be based on something you just wrote. Thus: you'd paste the template over the selected text, applying the template to the data it replaces.</p>
