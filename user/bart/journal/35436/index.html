<div class="span8">
<p>To relax, I occasionally play a little video game like Teagame's <a href="http://www.teagames.com/games/tgmotocross3a/play.php">TG Motocross 3</a>. I currently don't have any trouble finishing the game until I start to do stunts to gain more points.<br/><br/>My son, who is 7, tried it out, and he doesn't succeed staying on the bike for longer than about 10 seconds. It's totally unplayable to him.<br/><br/>I tried my hand at <a href="http://www.fancypantsadventures.com/">Fancy Pants Adventures</a>, but this game is unplayable to me. I barely succeed to stay alive for more than 15 seconds. On the other hand, he has no trouble with that game at all, and within the first session (of a few hours, I admit), he succeeded in finishing the complete game more than once.<br/><br/>Different people can be more skilled in one game than in another, while it's the other way around for other people, even when they had never played these games before, and superficially, the games appear to require a similar a skillset. It just goes to show that being good at video games is not a simple one-dimensional skill, one that you could just get a single score at. Neither is the difficulty level of such a game. Am I better at video games than him, or is it the reverse? Actually it's neither. It just is not that cut and dried.<br/><br/>n.b. if you like Fancy Pants (and apparently a lot of peopel do), note that the second game is out: <a href="http://www.kongregate.com/games/DrNeroCF/fancy-pants-adventure-world-2">Fancy Pants Adventures World 2</a><br/><br/>Another game that we recently discovered, and which my son lately really is addicted to, is <a href="http://www.falling-sand-game.com/">Falling Sand Game</a> (requires Java). It has no aim at all but to enjoy the experience. There's no score, and it doesn't end.

<h2>Falling Sand...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ajt/">ajt</a> on 2008-01-21T21:56:19</h3>
<p>Other than the obvious evils of getting Java to work (Sun still think there is no such thing as 64-bit Linux[1]...) the falling sand is a fascinating game.</p>

<ol>
<li>Yes I know you can get Java 6 for 64-bit Linux, but Sun still refuse to provide the browser plug-in. Apparently it may see the light of day in the Java 1.7 time-frame...</li>
