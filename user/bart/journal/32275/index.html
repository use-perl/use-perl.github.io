<p>I've been looking at various versions of Acrobat Reader, and alternatives like Foxit Reader. On any forum discussing Acrobate Reader, you can find <a href="http://www.download.com/Adobe-Reader/3640-2378_4-10614498.html">a few comments</a> recommending Foxit Reader instead, because it's much smaller. So I decided to try it out.<br/><br/>Indeed, it is fast. It loads in a few seconds on an older computer. Its rendering looks very good, in a graphics intensive file.<br/><br/>But it succeeded in crashing once, and hanging once, bringing down the entire PC (an old Win98 system), but otherwise very stable platform, in under 15 minutes of testing. So it doesn't give me the impression of being a mature product.<br/><br/>So off it goes.

I've never have a problems on any of my XP machines. Maybe it's a Win98 issue.

I just <em>knew</em> somebody was going to blame it on my system. No, usually it is quite reliable. With very intensive use, I get about one crash per 3 days. Now I got 2 in 15 minutes. In this one program.<br><br>I can accept that the issue is <em>more visible</em> in Win98. The crashes seem to mostly happen while fiddling with the window, like when I'm about to close the program. It's possible that an NT based system, like XP, separates the programs better, so you don't notice as much if a program crashes while closing. That doesn't mean it doesn't happen.

Another way to take that statement is: maybe foxit reader does not like win98.  That's not win98's problem.  Perhaps the author does not have access to a win98 system to test with.<br><br>Personally, I have never had a problem with foxit on XP.

<p>Any crash on my XP system results in a &#x201c;Do you want to send a crash report?&#x201d; popup. I&#x2019;ve never gotten one for Foxit Reader.</p>
