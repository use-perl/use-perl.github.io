<p>I posed a question sort of related to this thought at <a href="http://perlmonks.org/index.pl?node=384317 ">Perlmonks</a>, but this space is my little soapbox, so I'm gonna step on it.

<p>I pledge to rate at least one module I use each day on <a href="http://cpanratings.perl.org/">CPAN Ratings</a>!  (Until I have rated all the modules I use.)  

<p>I challenge everyone else to do the same.

<p>I don't pledge that I will have anything insightful to say about the module, and I wouldn't have a review text at all except that it's a required field.  But I will rate the module 1 - 5 on a combination of how I 'feel' about it, how easy it was for me to use and how helpful I found it.  

<p>Why?  Because a statistically relevant sampling of the modules in use, and a comparison of which are more used, is just as important as insightful reviews of modules.  Seeing 5 stars with 2 ratings is less meaningful than 4 stars with 50 ratings.

<p>Whether you dismiss this as 'popularity', it doesn't make the measurement unimportant.  Things that are popular are popular for a reason.  Things that are widely used have larger support bases (an important consideration in the opensource arena.)  Companies and employers <em>like</em> statistics that back decisions.

<p>But for that kind of data to even exist, more people need to rate the modules they use, whether or not they have a useful review of the modules.  

<p>If we don't want to use cpanratings.perl.org this way, it should be called 'CPAN Reviews'.

<p><b>Update:</b> <a href="http://perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=194920">diotalevi</a> has requested comments on his <a href="http://perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=384652">submit-cpan-ratings</a> script that aims to facilitate more ratings and reviews.</p>

I've said I'd try to do something like this before, but I will really really try, now.... and don't think I won't check on your entries every day to check on you!<br> <br>Also, just because I just noticed it: holy crap! OmniWeb has a button on its textarea fields that pops the field open into a little text editor.  Woah!
