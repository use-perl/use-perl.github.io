<p><p>This is three thirds of a post. The three parts will simply have to combine into one big <a href='http://pbfcomics.com/?cid=PBF186-Guntron_Alliance_Force.jpg'>mechbot</a> in order to pass as a whole post.</p>

<p><b>I'm a GSoC 2010 student</b></p>

<p>I <a href='http://socghop.appspot.com/gsoc/student_project/show/google/gsoc2010/tpf/t127230763829'>sent in a proposal</a>, and it got accepted. Yay!</p>

<p><b>Use contextuals for "process data", not attributes</b></p>

<p>Sometimes you both want do subdivide methods into small manageable parts, all the while keeping some sort of data between them. Most people reach for the instance attributes to do this, since these shared between all the methods of one object.</p>

<p>But this can also be done with contextuals, as is now <a href='http://github.com/masak/yapsi/commit/5fa4545f571c883ba1c1058e50c478301a3aa462'>done in Yapsi</a>. This keeps the lifetime of the variables as short as possible, and keeps the objects light-weight. And it still works with inheritance.</p>

<p>I like how Perl 6 allows me to mix OO and contextuals this way. And I really like that it works in Rakudo already.</p>

<p><b>The mechanics of intolerance</b></p>

<p>I've blogged before about how #perl6 is <a
href='http://use.perl.org/user/masak/journal/38988'>a small, friendly community</a>
which turns even flame wars into <a
href='http://use.perl.org/user/masak/journal/39025'>interesting discussions</a>
and which works on being <a
href='http://use.perl.org/user/masak/journal/39090'>kind and open</a>. We've had a
bit of troll activity since I wrote those posts, as well as a few borderline
trolls.</p>

<p>The other day I treated someone with undue impatience. The whole episode ended
well, and I've apologised. In short, what looked like nagging questioning may
simply have been someone's slightly different means of communicating.</p>

<p>Mean and evil acts are often committed by people convinced that they're
actually doing good. mst++ writes about the <a
href='http://www.shadowcat.co.uk/blog/matt-s-trout/on-being-a-bastard/'>reasons
for being harsh</a>, and I thought this was one of those times when that was
called for. It wasn't.</p>

<p>It taught me to look out for situations when I might be mistaking variations
in personality and communication skills for truly annoying behaviour. In many
ways, that's a refreshing reminder: a really open community requires that we
recognize that everyone doesn't operate exactly the same as we do. That sounds
terribly clichÃÂ©d, I know; but forgetting it is also far too easy.</p>

<p>I don't mean to be a troll or anything like that and I haven't really looked at the how the Perl 6 syntax has evolved over the years.</p><p>So, out of curiosity I decided to take a look at the commit and I was bewildered by code such as:</p><p><code><br>%*pads{$*current-block} = {};<br>for $ -&gt; $statement {<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; self.find-vars($statement, 'statement');<br>}<br></code></p><p>I mean, I can see the point in Perl 5 sigils. They're not pretty, but they're acceptable and they didn't bother me in these almost 10 years I've been programming in Perl.</p><p>But (and I'll definitely be tagged as a troll for this) this almost looks like line noise to me.</p><p>I mean, assuming we use shorter variable names, the following code would be valid:<br><code><br>%*foo{$*bar} = {};<br></code></p><p>This means more sigils the alphabetic characters in an assignment.</p><p>Granted, I don't know what the "*" stands for, neither the "!" which it replaced (seems to be attribute declaration). But if this is something which would be used regularly throughout the code... Perl 6 programmers will likely require specialized keyboards. Thankfully I don't see any Unicode operator madness as was the case some years ago (are they still around?).</p><p>I guess this just reinforces my feeling that Perl6 should be renamed Perl++ or PerlNG.</p><p>(sorry if I seem trollish, that really isn't my intention)</p>

<p>Thank you for writing your comment. You're fears of being a troll are quite unfounded. You're quite frank, and your intention is clearly not to cause ire but to air your own distress. Let me try to help allay it.</p><p>It's nice to be the one putting some Perl 6 code in the way of a Perl 5 programmer with ten years of experience. I'm not surprised that your first reaction to twigils is one of slight... unease. Perl 6 syntax <em>is</em> different, and not just in minor details.</p><p>Things look like line noise when you don't know their semantics. I can assure you they look quite meaningful to me, and I say that as a normal guy, without unusual intelligence or memory. Just as the sigils, twigils indicate the <em>kind</em> of variable you're dealing with, in a way that quickly grows to become more informative than bothersome.</p><p>People not used to Perl 5 could use your very argument about line noise to code they don't understand. I'd venture to say that Perl 6 is less line-noisy than Perl 5 on average, because most 'special variables' have been removed, and some uncommon constructs have been de-huffmanized to have longer names. That being said, both Perl 5 and Perl 6 are heavy in operators and sigils compared to other languages.</p><p>I don't understand your comment about specialized keyboards. Maybe you're worried that there are hundreds of different twigils. In fact there are eight, by my count, and most of them are quite uncommon. What the twigils do is indicate 'unusual scoping', which is why they (as you correctly guessed) figure in dynamic lookup and OO. They form immediate visual cues to the programmer, shouting "I'm an attribute" or "I'm a contextual", just like sigils shout about being arrays or hashes.

</p><p>This is typical of changes from Perl 5 to Perl 6. The basic systems are still the same, but there are fully-formed subsystems for dealing with things like OO and contextuals, and the subsystems all mesh well. Most of the changes have been "inward", so to speak, in deepening the language while keeping the original Perl core fairly constant, or adding saner defaults where boilerplate tended to be the norm.</p><p>The Unicode madness has indeed abated a little. There used to be a 'Yen' operator; it's now a 'Z'. All Perl 6 is (and has always been, I believe) writeable with ASCII characters, but some constructs have Latin-1 synonyms.</p><p>A renaming of Perl 6 to something else is, and should be, completely up to Larry Wall. I don't see any merit in discussing it, except to note that many outsiders seem quite vocal in changing the name, while most insiders (who have studied the language and gotten to know the culture) don't. Of course, everyone's entitled to an opinion.</p><p>There, you rascal. You caught me by posting a comment which even predicts being tagged as trollish, as a response to a post partly about radical understanding and tolerance. I hope you feel you got what you deserve.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<p>I think I understand the motivation behind the twigils. In other programming languages you can't immediately tell if a variable name is a local variable or an object attribute, for instance.</p><p>And while I can't think of a better solution, twigils just don't seem to be the best solution to me. Maybe always requiring the object to be explicit is a better solution (e.g. $self.attribute). But then you'll hit me with a TIMTOWTDI hammer since that probably also works.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p><p>I don't agree that "line-noise appearance" comes from not knowing the semantics. There are some cases in Perl 5 land where I'm perfectly aware of the semantics but the end result still looks like line noise (e.g. manual symbol table manipulations).</p><p>But these are very specific situations and you can even argue that it's a feature - these constructs should only be used by those who know what they're doing.</p><p>Having all this everywhere is the issue I'm worried about.</p><p>I joked about "specialized keyboards" because I was thinking of something like second row of keys above the numbers, as the shift key would be used a lot.</p><p>Of course that it's possible to get used to it (specially considering I'm already a Perl 5 programmer). But I can assure that if Perl 5 people thinks the syntax is a little awkward... well, the rest of the world will find it, at least, *very* awkward.</p><p>I'm saying all this because I just didn't bother following up on Perl 6 anymore after the Unicode ops and the whole "periodic table of operators" thing.</p><p>All new developments in the Perl 5 world seem to try to "clean up" the syntax, i.e., less non-alphanumeric characters whenever possible. These initiative were supposedly influenced by Perl 6 features, so it came as a shock when I read some real Perl 6 code and it looks a lot "dirtier" than current Perl 5 code.</p><p>Anyway, I thank you for your very detailed reply to my comment.</p>

<h3><a href="/user/masak/">masak</a> on 2010-05-02T13:28:21</h3>
<p>In the interests of mutual understanding, I tried to look at the periodic table (which is <a href="http://www.ozonehouse.com/mark/periodic/" title="ozonehouse.com">here</a ozonehouse.com>, by the way), and tried to instill a measure of fear in myself. The closest I got was "huh, that's quite a lot of them, isn't it?".</p><p>I think one of the big dividing points between the Perl languages on the one hand and other programming languages on the other, is that Perl embraces complexity -- often quite fearlessly. Language designers are known to talk about minimalism and orthogonality. Perl, in contrast, seems to take as a starting point that the world, including the programming world, is complex and messy and non-orthogonal and full of redundancy and can be seen in different ways by different people.</p><p>Perl 5 has quite a lot of operators. I haven't counted them, and wouldn't really know where to start if I were to try. I'm sure Perl 6 has more, maybe even twice as many. (Again, by some half-defined measure.) I think I don't think "scary" when I look at the table because most of these operators are familiar to me now, and I see the rationale for them. (Yes, duh.) Also, many of them I don't normally consider operators, either because they're too infrastructural (like the comma or the different dotty method calls) or too abstract (like 'does' or most of the alphabetic list operators) to be real operators.</p><p>With the rest of them, they're either new (which one would expect from a new language or even an upgrade), or they're instances of one Perl 5 operator that has exploded into a couple of Perl 6 operators because Perl 6 often takes a more strict view to keeping different things distinct and relies less on value context than does Perl 5. The shift/and/or/negate operators prefixed by plus or tilde or question mark are an example of this; I briefly give the rationale for why I like this change in <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/masak/journal/40052" title="perl.org">blog post</a perl.org> from a while back. I should add that I don't use those particular operators on a day-to-day basis, because of their quite specific and close-to-the-metal nature. (That's also a dimension not visible in the Table; some operators are uncommon in practice.)</p><p>Much of the complexity is actually hidden and folded in by the presence of the metaoperators. Of course, the mere concept of a metaoperator and the sudden ability to create a fitting operator on the spot (along with the parser technology required to make that work) are, by rights, scary in an objective sense. But it's one of the things that grows on you. And I haven't seen people abuse it either; just because there are metaoperators available, people don't suddenly go crazy and produce unmaintainable code. Rather, it helps turn a <code>for</code> loop here and there into a one-liner.</p><p>I came in at around 2004, and I've seen many of these operators mature and take shape. So I guess I'm biased by having seen the rationale for most changes, from Perl 5 through the Apocalypses and Synopses up until today. I agree with most of them. I still don't quite understand how we ended up with <em>eight</em> flip-flop operators, but I haven't really used them yet, so I'll reserve judgment on that point. Maybe they'll be handy in a <code>perl6 -ne</code> context or something.</p><p>As for the "Perl 6 by dint of being called 'Perl 6' places itself as the ultimate successor of Perl 5" discussion, it's not an issue that only you are facing, but probably <em>the</em> sore point between the Perl 5 and Perl 6 communities. Patrick Michaud addresses the naming thing <a href="http://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=836626" title="perlmonks.org">here</a perlmonks.org>. I address the topic at length in <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/masak/journal/39912" title="perl.org">this blog post</a perl.org> (which goes together with <a href="http://www.shadowcat.co.uk/blog/matt-s-trout/f_ck-perl-6/" title="shadowcat.co.uk">this blog post</a shadowcat.co.uk> by mst++), and I don't feel I have to add much to what is said there. Relations are, by and large, much better since then, but still not ideal.</p><p>It's possible that <a href="http://webchat.freenode.net/" title="freenode.net">freenode's webchat</a freenode.net> still works from behind your firewall.

Masak and his homies won't acknowledge it, but having few and well-defined operators is a GOOD thing for a language. Operators are akin to prepositions and should be kept to a minimum, in my very humble opinion. I'm pretty sure chromatic/masak/lwall/etc don't think so, though.

Perhaps regex modifiers count.</p><p>As for the larger question, parsimony of primitives leads directly towards dialectization, in the case of Forth-like languages; top-down standardization of APIs, in the case of Java; or oscillating periods of expansion and contraction towards contentious compromises, in the case of CLOS or Scheme.

</i></p><p><i>You are missing the point entirely. Firstly, minimising the number of operators, especially in perl 6's case, would be positive.

Perl 5's default object system is simple.  You get method dispatch and <tt>bless</tt>.  You can build anything you want out of that.  The <tt>Class::</tt> namespace on the CPAN demonstrates that many people do (and I can only imagine the DarkPAN).  Now try integrating multiple object systems with different ideas about representation and access and initialization and encapsulation and lament the lack of coherence of the end product (especially if you have multiple applications of the Adapter pattern).

<p>Because the operators are not obvious. Not even for Perl 5 programmers. They should be as obvious as +, or -. I'm not against introducing a couple of operators, if they make sense. In this day and age, the engineering goal of a programming language should be to make multithreading and object plurality as easy as possible. I think it's right to make operators smarter so they can operate on arrays or sole elements, but it seems to have gone to a confusing extreme in perl 6.

</p><p>One small case, just looking at the periodic table of perl 6 operators. I see a whole bunch of string comparison operators (leg, lt, lg, eq, ge, gt, ne) and a whole bunch of numeric comparison operators (&lt;=&gt;, &gt;, &lt;, etc etc) plus cmp plus eqv.
Now, I haven't had time to look at perl 6 deeply in years, but at first glance, that's even worse than common lisp's 5 different notions of equality.

</p><p>And in the end, that's not really enough either, because for some concepts (is this playing card the same as this other? do I care if they are the same physical object?) even those are not enough. Not to mention that string comparison can get very nasty very quickly if you compare a byte[] to unicode string.
No, this calls for two separate concepts: referential equality as a basic comparison operation, and user-defined operations, with polymorphic behaviour. You will notice that this is similar to java, except that there's no operator overloading there.
If you think a bit further, all these modifications (defining how the comparison should be done, and defining what i'm comparing, so I know how to compare loose strings or lists of strings) are really just modifications of some basic behaviour - which are also generalities that can be directly applied to operators, to reduce their numbers.

</p><p>Pushing the complexity into a sensible set of open default classes is a good compromise imho - much better than having trouble trying to understand what's written in the page.

</p><p>I am not necessarily against more reseved keywords, because those tend to make the language clearer.

</p><p>As for this reply, it's more of a brain dump at the moment. I remember reading a paper about how many operators people find more comfortable with in the 1st edition of the Gruner/Jacobs parsing book - if someone knows it please post - trying to find it atm.</p>

<p>I'd rather discuss the Dick Grune research to which you alluded months ago.  Did you ever find it?  (I'm not Mr. Grune, nor Mr. Pierce, nor Mr. Carlyle, nor Mr. Romata either.  What bizarre assertions.)</p>

No, your name is Shane Warden, and you've published a couple of books as S. Christopher.
As for the rest - my Pierce books are laughing at you. I'm sure you want to be them, but it's obvious to everyone you fail (as for Romata, I think you should have said Tomita - he has nice parsers that are porbably the only ones that can parse your perl 6 monstrosity.)
Also, I'm tired of you editing my comments, so I am still cross-posting this to my blog <a href="http://fixingsoftware.blogspot.com/" title="blogspot.com">http://fixingsoftware.blogspot.com/</a blogspot.com>

<h2>Oh, and it becomes thread-safer</h2>

<p>Either I didn't think of it at the time of blogging, or I forgot about it, but another nice thing about using contextuals rather than instance attributes is that the class becomes thread-safe. In other words, you can suddenly use the same instance of Yapsi::Compiler to compile two different sources simultaneously. The contextuals will be local to each thread and not interact; instance attributes would have been shared and cause a bit of trouble.</p><p>Yapsi::Compiler currently only has one instance attribute: @.warnings -- this is so that one can query the object for warnings after compilation. Maybe we should factor this one out into a result object of some sort, returned from the<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.compile method. But, meh; YAGNI.</p>
