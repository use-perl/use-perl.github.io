<div class="span8">
<p><p>Here's an idea I had the other day.</p>

<p>We're in the process of upgrading how proto installs Perl 6 projects. mberends++ has taken the initiative by creating <a href="http://github.com/masak/proto/tree/installed-modules">a branch</a> and <a href="http://github.com/masak/proto/blob/242497e1b767362be39bb80d0c20cc2bea485fed/proto#L510">a TODO</a>. Today, the same mberends++ also landed <a href="http://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/e8b631cd86ffeaeae8cf930c72ffd4a449e5d521">a commit in Rakudo</a> such that all our PERL6LIB worries just vanish. It's looking good.</p>

<p>One thing I would like to fall out from this refactor is <b>a way to run all the tests in all Perl 6 projects</b>. Think of it as a kind of community-level introspection &#8212; proto's <a href="http://github.com/masak/proto/blob/adc11251ae1923c996b8ae8ed5b20bad90c1f9b5/lib/Ecosystem.pm">Ecosystem.pm</a> was my early attempt at this. And we can easily set up cron jobs and HTML serializers for a nightly run of these things on <a href="http://feather.perl6.nl/">feather</a>. This would have two benefits, I think:</p>

<ul>
  <li>We get an ecosystem equivalent of the <a href="http://svn.pugscode.org/pugs/t/spec/">spectest suite</a>, in the sense of "these things should all work, and if it doesn't, a human should check it out". Such testing helped us before &#8212; apps helping us <a href="http://www.perlworkshop.no/npw2009/talk/1734">find holes in the Rakudo cheese</a> &#8212; but by not running all the tests regularly, we're doing ourselves a disservice, because it might be days between the introduction and discovery of a Rakudobug. The sooner these things are flagged down, the better for everyone.</li>

  <li>We could make the community more positively aware of project tests, and make the community celebrate them. Which Perl 6 project out there has the most tests right now? I don't know. I have a guess, but I would like to know for sure. Which project passes the highest amount of tests? Which projects pass all of their tests (barring <code>:todo</code> and <code>:skip</code> tests)? Which project has had all its tests passing for the longest time? Which project has had all its tests passing for the longest time <em>while also adding more tests lately</em>? Which project has the best test coverage? And so on. It's not a contest, but if some authors choose to think of it that way, what we'll end up with is better-tested code.</li>
</ul>

<p>Testing all of the Perl 6 ecosystem sure is simpler than testing all of CPAN. But if it can help improve Rakudo and the Perl 6 community, I think it can be very worthwhile.</p></p>
