<p><p>It is with undue sprightliness that I want to announce, on behalf of the Yapsi
development team, the May 2010 release of Yapsi, a Perl 6 compiler written in
Perl 6.</p>

<p>You can get it <a href='http://github.com/downloads/masak/yapsi/yapsi-2010.05.tar.gz'>here</a>.</p>

<p>Yapsi is implemented in Perl 6. It thus requires a Perl 6 implementation to
build and run. We recommend the 'alpha' branch of Rakudo for this purpose.</p>

<p>Yapsi is an 'official and complete' Perl 6 release. It's official because we
have little labels with the word 'official' on them that we glue to each
download that takes off from github. (That much gluing takes a lot of work,
but we think of it as a community service.) It's complete in the sense that
all of the things it implements, it does. With gusto.</p>

<p>Instructions for getting Yapsi up and running:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Make sure you have a built Rakudo alpha in your $PATH as 'alpha'.</li>
  <li>Download Yapsi from <a href='http://github.com/masak/yapsi/downloads'>here</a>.</li>
  <li>...</li>
  <li>Profit!</li>
</ol>

<p>The third (optional) step consists of running 'make' in the Yapsi directory.
This will precompile Yapsi, making startup times much more bearable.</p>

<p>The big change since last month is that Yapsi now does immediate blocks.</p>

<p><code>
$ export PERL6LIB=`pwd`/lib<br>
<br>
$ ./yapsi -e 'my $a = 42; { my $a = 7; say $a }; say $a'<br>
7<br>
42
</code></p>

<p>For other changes, see the doc/ChangeLog file.</p>

<p>This release, as opposed to the last one, contains hidden bugs. We encourage
you to help us find them; if not for the fame and glory, than at least for the
Schadenfreude.</p>

<p>Yapsi consists of a compiler and a runtime. The program is compiled down into
an instruction code, which can be stored and executed weeks, years or even
days [<em>sic</em>] later. If you want, you can execute the same piece of SIC several
times over. All SIC listings start with a versioning line saying e.g. "This
is SIC v2010.05". At this point during Yapsi development, we provide no
guarantees about backwards compatibility whatsoever. Expect breakage between
monthly releases.</p>

<p>An overarching goal for making a Perl 6 compiler-and-runtime is to use it as
a server for various other projects, which will hook in at different steps:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A time-traveling debugger (tardis), which will hook into the runtime.</li>
  <li>A coverage tool (lid), which will also hook into the runtime.</li>
  <li>A syntax checker (sigmund), which will use output from the parser.</li>
</ul>

<p>Another overarching goal is to optimize for fun while learning about parsers,
compilers, and runtimes. We wish you the appropriate amount of fun!</p>
