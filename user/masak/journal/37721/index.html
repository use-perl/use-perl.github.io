<div class="span8">
<p><p>This summer when we started the November project, we chose <a href="http://git.or.cz/">git</a> as our revision control system. During the past week, seeing how we have been effortlessly throwing around commits and branches &#8212; we're up to five right now &#8212; and generally being very productive in our environment, I think I'm not just learning to live with git, but actually starting to like it.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software)">Wikipedia</a> has this to say: "Git supports rapid branching and merging, and includes specific tools for visualizing and navigating a non-linear development history."</p>

<p>One such tool is <a href="http://github.com/blog/39-say-hello-to-the-network-graph-visualizer">the network graph</a> at github. <a href="http://masak.org/carl/nonlinear-history.png">Here's a snapshot</a> of the last few days of development in November. Four of our five active branches are visible.</p>

<p>I've gotten into the habit of checking that graph regularly. Partly to see if anyone's committed anything new, but partly because seeing that graph is like getting a message from git, saying "here's all the complexity I'm handling for you automatically". Because, the thing is, doing branching and merging doesn't <i>feel</i> complicated. Branching and merging is rapid and painless, and has that <i>It Just Works</i> feeling to it.</p>

<p>As John Wiegley says in <a href="http://www.newartisans.com/blog_files/git.from.bottom.up.php">Git from the bottom up</a>, "Most other systems have led me to believe they've reached their conceptual plateau &#8212; that all 
else from now will be only a slow refinement of what IÃ¢â¬â¢ve seen before. Git gives me the opposite impression, however. I feel weÃ¢â¬â¢ve only begun to see the potential its deceptively simple design 
promises."</p>

<p>Thanks, git.</p></p>

<p>In fact, I have found that as I understand git better, what happens is I understand its simplicity ever better &#8211; not its complexity. It is difficult to learn because its command line interface obscures the underlying simplicity of its repository format. Understanding that format and relating what a command does to that format is the key to understanding git, which is actually much easier than it initially seems. I have actually toyed with the idea of reimplementing the format in pure Perl &#8211; it wouldn&#8217;t take more than a few days, that&#8217;s how simple git is.</p>

<p>Aye. I should perhaps add that I was referring to the complexity of managing distributed changes to a common file tree, not the complexity of git (which I agree has a very simple design).</p>
