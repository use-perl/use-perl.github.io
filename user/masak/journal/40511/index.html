<p><p><i>(This post isn't very punny. For those of you who need puns to survive, try to figure out why jnthn++ named the IRC logs "the hottest footwear" recently. The answer, as with all good puns, is highly unsatisfying.)</i></p>

<p>My quest for a Perl 6 implementation takes me ever deeper into the esoterics of lexpads, runtimes, and a far-more-than-everything-you-needed-to-know mindset. Today some random firings in my brain turned into the following conversation on #perl6.</p>

<p>During the conversation, I proposed two theories, both of which turned out to be wrong. (pmichaud++ shone the necessary light both times.) Being wrong felt less important than getting my mental model fixed.</p>

<p>I first thought of presenting the results of the below conversation as a simple tutorial ("How <code>our</code> declarations work. The complete guide."), but now I think that the conversation, minimally edited, manages to be such a tutorial on its own.</p>

<p>Besides, blogging things in their raw and undigested form is a sign of the times. Enjoy!</p>

<p><code>
&lt;masak&gt; I have a question. is there a need for a special "package lexpad" containing 'our'-declared variables, or can the package lexpad simply be equated to the topmost lexpad in the package?<br>
<br>
&lt;masak&gt; my suspicion is the latter, but I might be missing something.<br>
<br>
&lt;pmichaud&gt; the package lexpad can't be the same as the top most lexical<br>
<br>
&lt;pmichaud&gt; <b>module XYZ { my sub abc() { ... } };   # abc should not appear in the package</b><br>
<br>
&lt;masak&gt; oh!<br>
<br>
&lt;masak&gt; right.<br>
<br>
&lt;masak&gt; so, separate one, then.<br>
<br>
&lt;jnthn&gt; Additionally, lexpads are meant to be static by the time we hit runtime, and you're allowed to shove stuff into the package dynamically. Not quite sure how those two hold together.<br>
<br>
&lt;pmichaud&gt; well,  <b>module XYZ { ... }</b>   creates a lexical XYZ entry that holds the package entries<br>
<br>
&lt;jnthn&gt; Aha!<br>
<br>
&lt;pmichaud&gt; and it's just a hash, really.<br>
<br>
&lt;masak&gt; does inserting the package lexpad below the outside lexpad (and above the topmost lexpad) make sense? that way, Yapsi wouldn't need any special opcodes for doing 'our'-variable lookups.<br>
<br>
&lt;pmichaud&gt; the package lexpad is an entry in the outside lexpad, yes.<br>
<br>
&lt;pmichaud&gt; I'm not sure it encapsulates the nested lexpad, though.<br>
<br>
&lt;masak&gt; hm.<br>
<br>
&lt;masak&gt; if it doesn't, I don't really see how it's visible from inside the package.<br>
<br>
&lt;masak&gt; I've more or less convinced myself that sandwiching it between outer and topmost is what I want to do for Yapsi.<br>
<br>
&lt;pmichaud&gt; <b>our &xyz</b>  can make an entry in both the package and in the lexical.<br>
<br>
&lt;pmichaud&gt; this is what rakudo does now.<br>
<br>
&lt;pmichaud&gt; we have to do similar things for methods already, too.<br>
<br>
&lt;masak&gt; sure. it makes entries in both.<br>
<br>
&lt;pmichaud&gt; by having entries in both, that's how it's visible inside the package<br>
<br>
&lt;masak&gt; hm, indeed.<br>
<br>
&lt;masak&gt; no need to have the package lexpad visible from inside.<br>
<br>
&lt;pmichaud&gt; anyway, sandwiching might work too.  haven't quite gotten to that point in Rakudo thinking yet.  And it can get a bit tricky with multis.<br>
<br>
&lt;masak&gt; no need to sandwich it in, either. it can sit in limbo outside the tree of scopes.<br>
<br>
&lt;pmichaud&gt; oh, I know why it perhaps shouldn't (or should) be visible:<br>
<br>
&lt;pmichaud&gt; <b>my $x = 'lexical';   module XYZ { say $x;  { our $x = 'package'; } }</b><br>
<br>
&lt;masak&gt; ...yes?<br>
<br>
&lt;pmichaud&gt; I'm pretty sure "say $x" needs to grab the 'lexical' $x, not the one that might be "sandwiched" in a package.<br>
<br>
&lt;masak&gt; of course.<br>
<br>
&lt;masak&gt; that falls out from ordinary scope nesting and shadowing.<br>
<br>
&lt;masak&gt; innermost block binds its lexical to the container in the package lexpad.<br>
<br>
&lt;masak&gt; so, that speaks out against sandwiching.<br>
<br>
&lt;masak&gt; pmichaud++
</code></p>

<p>So there you go. There's a separate package scope, and it isn't sandwiched.</p>
