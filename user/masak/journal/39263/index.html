<h1>Reading up on MVC, part 2: Catalyst</h1>

<div class="span8">
<p><p>I was pleasantly surprised by the relatively large number of comments to <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/masak/journal/39182">my first MVC post</a>. Either people are very interested in MVC in general, and have things to say about it, or there's some reverse psychology going on in starting a post with "don't mind me".</p>

<p>Just in case it's the latter... <strong>don't mind me</strong> this time either. In fact, if anything, I seem to have gotten even more ignorant and directionless since last time. MVC frameworks are hard, let's go shopping!</p>

<p>Reviewing Catalyst. I found <a href="http://wiki.dandascalescu.com/howtos/catalyst/introduction_to_catalyst">this screencast</a> a couple of weeks ago. Here are my impressions while watching it:</p>

<ul>
<li>It's nice to have a skeleton of the application generated for you. Can be taken to extremes, of course, but the general idea is sound.</li>
<li>Compared to the Rails screencast, this one cheats a bit on details. It skips parts of the installation process. It says "there's really no excuse not to document your code any more" but then doesn't fill in the blanks.</li>
<li>It also (unconsciously) presupposes a lot of prior knowledge. Example: "The index method does the actual handling of requests for the root path. It has two attributes: :Path and :Args. We specify that it handles all paths (because there is nothign like '/foo' after :Path), and it takes no arguments off of the stash." I see. What's the stash?</li>
<li>The debug screen is nice. It makes good use of the terminal.</li>
<li>Suddenly, the screencast is over. It refers to a Part 2, but there's no Part 2 yet.</li>
<li>Overall impression: Catalyst is an application that lets me dispatch on URLs. I'm sure there must be more to it than that.</li>
</ul>

<p>I also stepped through the slides about <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/jshirley/catalyst-and-chained">chained</a>, since I've gotten good vibes about those, but don't really grok them yet. I'll have to come back to it, because I didn't understand everything in it yet.</p>

<p>After both of these, I still feel very much in the dark about what makes Catalyst great. I almost feel as if I'm starting at the wrong end. I had a chat with the good people over at #catalyst, and they advised me to buy <a href="http://www.apress.com/book/view/1430223650">the book</a>, which I did. Hopefully it will quench my thirst for knowledge.</p>

<p>Next up: Django.</p></p>

Sometimes you stare at a library - and it is so imperfect - but somehow there is so much happening around it. And I am far from idealizing that - I don't like how the community chooses not the optimal solutions - but you need to accept that. It has to do a lot with the fact that programmers like learning - so when they manage a complex framework it gives them a boost and they don't try to evaluate how really useful it is.

<p>Wow, that's a bit more dystopian than I intended my post to be. I'm certainly not saying that I think Catalyst is imperfect. I'm saying that they have worse PR than RoR. Much worse. Maybe it was a mistake to look at RoR before Catalyst -- maybe I'd have been more impressed by Catalyst if I hadn't seen the slick RoR video first.</p><p>Also, one goal of Web.pm -- remains to be seen how well it works -- is to dispassionately investigate other web libraries, looking for sweet spots, and stealing them, thereby setting the quality bar so high in Perl 6 that people will simply <i>expect awesome</i>, and build their own solutions accordingly.</p>
