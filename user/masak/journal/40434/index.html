<div class="span8">
<p><p>Working with pls (a next-gen project installer for the Perl 6 ecosystem), I had a few classes with code like this:</p>

<pre>
class POC::Tester does App::Pls::Tester {
    method test($project --> Result) {
        my $target-dir = "cache/$project<name>";
        if "$target-dir/Makefile" !~~ :e {
            return failure;
        }
        unless run-logged( relative-to($target-dir, "make test"),
                           :step('test'), :$project ) {
            return failure;
        }

        return success;
    }
}
</pre>

<p>(<code>success</code> and <code>failure</code> are <code>Result</code> enum values defined elsewhere. They felt like pleasant documentation, and when return type checking works, they'll even help catch errors!)</p>

<p>Now, I wanted to add super-simple progress diagnostics to this method. I wanted an <code>announce-start-of('test', $project<name>);</code> at the start of the module, and either an <code>announce-end-of('test', success);</code> or an <code>announce-end-of('test', failure);</code>, depending on the success or failure of the method.</p>

<p>I have a low threshold for boilerplate. After realizing that I'd have to manually add those calls in the beginning of the method, and before each <code>return</code> &#8212; and not only in this method, but in several others &#8212; I thought "man, I shouldn't have to tolerate this. This is Perl 6, it should be able to do better!"</p>

<p>So I thought about what I really wanted to do. I wanted some sort of... method wrapper. Didn't really want a subclass, and a regular role wouldn't cut it (because class methods override same-named role methods).</p>

<p>Then it struck me: <em>mixins</em>. Did those already work in Rakudo? Oh well, try it and see. So I created this role:</p>

<pre>
role POC::TestAnnouncer {
    method test($project --> Result) {
        announce-start-of('test', $project&lt;name&gt;);
        my $result = callsame;
        announce-end-of('test', $result);
        return $result;
    }
}
</pre>

<p>And then, later:</p>

<pre>
POC::Tester.new() does POC::TestAnnouncer
</pre>

<p>And it worked! On the first attempt! jnthn++!</p>

<p>(If you're wondering what in the above method that does the wrapping &#8212; it's the <code>callsame</code> call in the middle. It delegates back to the overridden method. Note that with this tactic, I get to write my <code>announce-start-of</code> and <code>announce-end-of</code> calls <em>exactly once</em>. I don't have to go hunting for all the various places in the original code where a <code>return</code> is made.)</p>

<p>I guess this counts as using mixins to do Aspect-Oriented Programming. This way of working certainly makes the code less <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspect-oriented_programming#Motivation_and_basic_concepts'>scattered and tangled</a>.</p>

<p>So, in <a href='http://github.com/masak/proto/blob/4396d9b6c6eca4c9a0d1e9da7ac90903c4ea528c/proof-of-concept'>this file</a>, I currently have a veritable curry of dependency injection, behavior-adding roles, lexical subs inside methods, AOP-esque mixins, and a <code>MAIN</code> sub. They mix together to create something really tasty. And it all runs, today, under Rakudo HEAD.</p>

<p>As jnthn said earlier today, it's pretty cool that a script of 400 LoC, together with a 230-LoC module, make up a whole working installer. With so little code, it almost doesn't feel like coding.</p></p>

<h2>And with Moose in Perl 5</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/frew/">frew</a> on 2010-07-04T17:15:14</h3>
<tt>With Perl 5 that would look like either:<br><br>package POC::TestAnnouncer;<br><br>use Moose::Role;<br><br>before test =&gt; sub {<br>&nbsp; my $project = $_[1];<br>&nbsp; announce-start-of('test', $project{name});<br>};<br><br>after test =&gt; sub {<br>&nbsp; my $project = $_[1];<br>&nbsp; announce-end-of('test', $project{name});<br>};<br><br>And then there's the more powerful around:<br><br>package POC::TestAnnouncer;<br><br>use Moose::Role;<br><br>around test =&gt; sub {<br>&nbsp; my $fn = shift;<br>&nbsp; my $self = shift;<br>&nbsp; my $project = $_[0];<br>&nbsp; announce-start-of('test', $project{name});<br>&nbsp; my $ret = $self-&gt;$fn(@_);<br>&nbsp; announce-end-of('test', $project{name});<br>&nbsp; return $ret<br>};<br><br>The former is probably preferred because you don't have to worry about calling the original method; of course you can't munge arguments with the former, but that's a feature.</tt>

<h3><a href="/user/masak/">masak</a> on 2010-07-05T05:05:28</h3>
<p>Thanks. I was only aware of how Moose did it to the extent that people come into the #perl6 channel sometimes and ask "what's the equivalent to Moose's before/after/around in Perl 6?" and we answer "[call|next][same|with]".</p><p>(The "call-" methods are returning calls, and the "next-" methods are tailcalls. "-same" sends along the original arguments, and "-with" allows you to send new ones.)</p><p>What's really neat, and what I still haven't quite gotten my head wrapped around, is that these four routines are used in three quite different situations:</p><ul>
  <li>Walking along the candidate list in of matching multi subs or methods.</li><li>Walking up the inheritance tree in a class hierarchy.</li><li>Unwrapping the candy wrapping of wrapped routines.</li></ul><p>That's a way cool generalization, but the interactions between these three (or at least the first two) are still not very well-understood. It is thought that a class-hierarchy dispatcher will constitute the "outer loop", and a multi candidate dispatcher will form the "inner loop". We're still trying that model out for size.</p>

<p>Oh, huh, and I should probably add that mixins may <em>look</em> like they do a variant of wrapping in Perl 6, but they really work by creating an anonymous subclass to the class of the object, and re-blessing the object to that subclass. So, they work by inheritance, not wrapping.</p><p>The fact that both of these use "callsame;" to delegate to the original routine means that I can use mixins and think they are wrappers, and they'll still behave as I expect. That's why I like the above unification.</p>

<p>The Moose version Frew posted uses Roles. So applying this "mixin" at Runtime to an instance will also derive an anonymous subclass with the Role applied and re-bless an instance into that subclass.</p>



<h2>Re:And with Moose in Perl 5</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/perigrin/">perigrin</a> on 2010-07-08T03:03:36</h3>
<p>Also playing about some I came up with something nearly identical using MooseX::Declare's syntax.</p><p><code><br>role POC::TestAnnouncer {<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; use mro;</code></p><p><code>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; method test ($project) {<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; announce-start-of('test', $project{name});<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; my $result = $self-&gt;maybe::next::method($project); # callsame<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; announce-end-of('test', $result);<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; return $ret;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; }<br>}<br></code></p><p>I'm however unsure if callsame is implicitly a method dispatch or not. masak's example makes it seem like it is but the documentation is spares and semantically it seems like it should at *least* be<nobr> <wbr></nobr><code>.callsame</code> if it's got an invocant.</p>

<p>I mean <code>$.callsame</code> rather than<nobr> <wbr></nobr><code>.callsame</code>. Thanks to TimToady and TiMBuS for clarifying things at least enough that I understand that much.</p>

<p>Yes, it's <code>$.callsame</code>. See <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/masak/journal/39709" title="perl.org">this post</a perl.org> for a slightly deeper "why" answer.</p>
