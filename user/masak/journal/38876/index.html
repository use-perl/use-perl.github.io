<div class="span8">
<p><p>In my <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/masak/journal/38602">confetti post</a>, I sort of promised to present <a href="https://github.com/masak/proto">proto</a> in a post on its own, but I haven't got around to it yet... unfortunately, the world doesn't wait. Even more unfortunately, the world doesn't discriminate between fact and rumour either, as you will see.</p>

<p>It was OK as long as the questions came from interested friends and strangers, and I could correct the misunderstandings one by one: "No, it's not a complete packaging solution for Perl 6", "No, it doesn't do versions and authorities", "No, it doesn't work on Windows".</p>

<p>Actually, I should have put down the two guiding principles into writing long ago, so that people will have an easy way to know what to expect. So here we go:</p>

<p><b>The two guiding principles of proto</b></p>

<ol>
  <li>Make it <i>super easy</i> to install stuff.</li>
  <li>Don't get in the way by assuming or dictating anything about the user's setup.</li>
</ol>

<p>The fact that I <em>didn't</em> write those down in time must have contributed to the massive misinformation when the larger newspapers started doing their reviews. How anyone could describe proto as "the most successful Perl 6 installer of the decade", "[o]ur guiding light in these times of economic hardship" or even "the most blatantly great thing since Michael Dorn", is beyond me.</p>

<p>All that was endurable, I guess. But when proto was awarded the Nobel Peace prize, I just had to call people up and set things right.</p>

<p>"It's just an installer!" I said, perhaps a bit too frantically, into the receiver.</p>

<p>"Oh yes," they answered at the Nobel Prize Q&A Hotline, "but what an installer! So sleek! So easy to use! We heard there's now a keyword in Perl 6 called <code>proto</code>, to maximize the ease of use."</p>

<p>"No, you got it all wrong!" I shouted. "It's the other way around. And proto is just a throwaway solution to reduce the immediate pain of installing Perl 6 projects with dependencies. It's just a prototype. <a href="http://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6/2009-02-05#i_887531">Hence the name</a>."</p>

<p>"You shouldn't be so humble," they replied. "Anyway, proto really deserves the Peace Prize, with its amazing one-command-install functionality. By our calculations, that was the number one factor that prevented the uprising in Austria last year."</p>

<p>"What on earth are you talking about?" I exclaimed. "There was no uprising in Austria last year."</p>

<p>"Exactly," they said.</p></p>

I like your work on Web.pm

I like proto being awarded the peace prize
</p><p>
I like Perl6 being awarded the <b>next</b> peace prize.</p>

<p>Thank you, sir.</p><p>It might please you to know that the confusion about the Nobel Peace Prize has since been cleared up. Turns out a much bigger contribution to the absence of an uprising in Austria last year was the last line of the bridge in the Beatles song "She Loves You":</p><dl> <dd> <i>And you know you should be glad. Ooh!</i> </dd></dl><p>

The Nobel Committee will award the prize to this line, if they can only figure out to make it show up in a tux at the yearly festivities.</p>

<h2>Well-deserved praise!</h2>

May I humbly point out that it is, in fact, 'the most successful Perl 6 installer of the decade'.  <p>
Well, and the only. (To date, at least).</p>

Anyway, I thought it was a two-pronged strategic manoeuvre from Sweden and Bratislava that stemmed the prospects of Viennese unrest.
