<p><p>SF took <a href='http://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6/2010-02-03#i_1954377'>my challenge</a> to heart and started producing a "modern Perl 6" version of the example code in <a href='http://dev.perl.org/perl6/doc/design/exe/E02.html'>E02</a>. His thought process can be seen <a href='http://lastofthecarelessmen.blogspot.com/2010/02/binary-tree.html'>here</a>, and <a href='http://lastofthecarelessmen.blogspot.com/2010/02/binary-tree-almost-complete-script.html'>here</a>.</p>

<p>After being a bystander for a few hours, I coulndn't restrain myself anymore: I produced <a href='http://gist.github.com/294621'>my own version</a>. I should say at once that it's quite different from SF's: while he keeps close to the original <a href='http://dev.perl.org/perl6/doc/design/exe/E02.html'>E02</a> (which, in turn, sets out to prove that Perl 6 is/was not very different from Perl 5), my version is a bit more liberal in its interpretation. I do mix in some of my personal preferences into it. Some examples:</p>

<ul>
  <li>We don't do <code>$ARGS prompts("Search? ")</code> anymore, but there's a nice <code>&prompt</code> function which I used instead, together with a <code>while</code> loop.</li>
  <li>The <code>&show</code> function now uses <code>gather/take</code>, rather than printing directly.</li>
  <li>Also, I avoided the statement-modifying mess from the original E02 <code>&show</code> code.</li>
  <li>Also, E02's <code>&show</code> makes a point of using a slurpy <code>@_</code> rather than naming the paramters. I don't. (Neither does SF.)</li>
  <li>It just makes sense to use a <code>given/when</code> construct in the <code>&insert</code> function. To its credit, E02 tantalizingly hints of it, but then does a MIB mind-wipe. (You don't recall that bit? Oh well...)</li>
  <li>In the same function, E02 puts <code>undef</code> to initiate the child nodes to some empty value. Both SF and I independently realized that just any undefined value won't work if <code>&insert</code> is to have <code>%tree</code> in the signature, because <code>%tree</code> only binds to an <code>Associative</code> value. SF solved it by putting <code>Hash</code> (an undefined <code>Hash</code> type object) in the child nodes, and changed it to <code>Hash.new</code> in the later version. I used <code>{}</code>, which should be equivalent to <code>Hash.new</code>, but IMHO more idiomatic.</li>
  <li>The whole traits business hadn't solidified in 2002, but I believe that the end result is both more realiable, more useful, and prettier. You'll have to judge for yourself.</li>
</ul>

<p>I believe rewriting the exigeses in modern form is a very worthy activity. I hope we'll see more of that. Perl 6 suffers a bit from stale, outdated documentation, and having these in new versions would be valuable.</p>

<p>It's also a very interesting <em>historical</em> activity to read the old apocalypses and exigeses, as I increasingly find. Perl 6 has come a long, long way since 2001.</p>

<h2>refining the  &quot;show&quot; function</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/dpuu/">dpuu</a> on 2010-02-04T16:32:58</h3>
Nice work, but still something lacking in the "show" function: both your version and SF's have too much repetition. What we really want to to say that there's a list of three actions to perform in one of three orders, with only one of the blocks moving. something like:<br><br>sub show(%tree, Traversal $method) {<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; return unless %tree;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; my @actions = (<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; { show %tree&lt;RIGHT&gt;, $method },<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; { show %tree&lt;LEFT&gt;, $method },<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; );<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; @actions.=splice( $method.value, 0 ) &lt;== { take %tree&lt;VALUE&gt; };<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; @actions&gt;&gt;.();<br>}<br><br>Perhaps losing a bit of readability<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... but I think we can remove even the last bit of repetition here:<br><br>sub show(%tree, Traversal $method) {<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; return unless %tree;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; my @actions = &lt;RIGHT LEFT&gt;.map: -&gt; $way { show %tree&lt;$way&gt;, $method }.assuming( $^way );<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; @actions.=splice( $method.value, 0 ) &lt;== { take %tree&lt;VALUE&gt; };<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; @actions&gt;&gt;.();<br>}

<p>It's clearly a matter of taste of where you want to end up on the readability/non-repetitiousness scale.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) I simply chose to err on the side of readability this time around.</p>

And actually I made a horrible error in my code: the way I wrote it the traversal order is actually undefined, because the order of iteration of hyper operators is undefined. So, although I'd say that having a concurrent traversal ordering would be a nice addition, the last line of my sub should probably be something like: ".() for @actions;"

<p>
Am I the only one whose OCD goes on overdrive everytime he sees a fixed-function tree traversal sub?
</p><p>
I immediately want to refactor &amp;show into a general traversal sub:
</p><p>

<code>
sub traverse(%tree, Traversal $order, &amp;function) {<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...
    &amp;function(%tree&lt;VALUE&gt;);<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...
}
</code>

</p><p>
and a trivial driver:
</p><p>

<code>
sub show(%tree, Traversal $order) { traverse(%tree, $order, &amp;take) }
</code>

</p><p>
I guess that gets away from keeping the same overall form as the E02 code.  Of course, I had the same reaction the first time I read the original code in E02<nobr> <wbr></nobr>....

<p>Heh. The reaction I got on #perl6 was that I had changed the function too much by replacing <code>print</code> by <code>take</code>, essentially turning the <code>&amp;show</code> function into an iterator generator.</p>
