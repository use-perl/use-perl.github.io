<p><p>It is with a certain degree of amusement that I want to announce, on behalf of
the Yapsi development team, the April 2010 release of Yapsi, a Perl 6 compiler
written in Perl 6.</p>

<p>You can get it <a href='http://github.com/downloads/masak/yapsi/yapsi-2010.04.tar.gz'>here</a>.</p>

<p>How does one compile and run a Perl 6 compiler, you might ask? One way would
be to use it on itself, but this has been known to cause some immediate
dependency/bootstrapping issues. It's often a great deal easier to use an
existing compiler to get off the ground. Yapsi runs fine under the 'alpha'
branch of Rakudo.</p>

<p>This is an "official" release of Perl 6, to the extent that we, the Yapsi
development team, have authority to make official Perl 6 releases, which
admittedly isn't a very large extent. It's also a "complete" implementation,
in frankly not very many ways at all.</p>

<p>Here's an example of what Yapsi can do:</p>

<p><code>$ ./yapsi -e ''</code></p>

<p>...that's right, it runs the null program. And with correct semantics, and
all.</p>

<p>But that's not everything. We also do assignments:</p>

<p><code>$ ./yapsi -e 'my $a = 42'</code></p>

<p>Note that here, too, the semantics are completely on the spot. 42 gets
assigned to $a, and nothing is output.</p>

<p>For those of you who cry foul at this point, just watch:</p>

<p><code>$ ./yapsi -e 'my $a = my $b = my $c = 5; say $a'<br>
5</code></p>

<p>Ta-daa!</p>

<p>Yapsi consists of a compiler and a runtime. The program is compiled down into
a kind of instruction code called SIC [<em>sic</em>]. This code can then be executed
very quickly inside the provided runtime, where the definition of "very
quickly" depends on the runtime you're bootstrapping off, etc.</p>

<p>An overarching goal for making a Perl 6 compiler-and-runtime is to use it as
a server for various other projects, which will hook in at different steps:</p>

<ul>
 <li>A time-traveling debugger (tardis), which will hook into the runtime.</li>
 <li>A coverage tool (lid), which will also hook into the runtime.</li>
 <li>A syntax checker (sigmund), which will use output from the parser.</li>
</ul>

<p>Another overarching goal is to optimize for fun while learning about parsers,
compilers, and runtimes. We wish you the appropriate amount of fun!</p></p>
