<p><p>40 years ago today, a <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sesame_Street'>children's TV show</a>, which was to turn out to be very successful and educational to boot, debuted:</p>

<p><quote>In Sesame Street's first season, the Educational Testing Service (ETS) reported that the cognitive skills of its young viewers had increased by 62%. They found that children who viewed the show the most often did 62% better at correctly recognizing a rectangle than less frequent viewers.</quote></p>

<p>How long before we see a children's show teaching programming?</p>

<p>&#10086;</p>

<p>Since it's <a href='http://use.perl.org/user/masak/journal/39836'>Temporal Tuesday</a> today, I've been making commits on the <a href='http://github.com/masak/rakudo'>temporal Rakudo fork</a>. Things are moving forward, if a bit slowly.</p>

<p>The only challenging part today was <a href='http://github.com/masak/rakudo/commit/72fd37f7117461629a75807b447c0c0c5b707c4d'>converting day-of-year to month and day-of-month</a>. I'm not sure I got that 100% right (i.e. need to write more tests); also, I cheated a bit and disregarded leap years for now. I have a feeling this detail might undergo some change before the dust lands. Still, I like the feature (specifying year and day-of-year), and can see its use in some situations. It's valid ISO 8601, just as all the other datetime formats I'm implementing.</p>

<p>The reason I'm doing this work at all, is because I think the current way Rakudo handles dates and times is too bare-bones. I also think that adding a few convenience methods here and there to make it more useable out-of-the box &#8212; scratch that; I want to make it <i>super-simple</i> &#8212; is important, because most every semi-large application one writes will involve date and time. My argument boils down to not wanting to write</p>

<p><code>Temporal::DateTime.new(:date(Temporal::Date.new(:year(2010), :month(4), :day(1))), :time(Temporal::Time.new(:hour(0), :minute(0), :second(0))), :timezone(Temporal::Timezone::Observance.new(:offset(0), :isdst(False), :abbreviation(''))))</code></p>

<p>when I want to refer to April 1st, 2010. I'd prefer something like</p>

<p><code>DateTime.new('2010-04-01')</code></p>

<p>(You think the former syntax is a joke? Go look at the <a href='http://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/master/src/setting/Temporal.pm'>Rakudo source</a>!)</p>

<p><b>Update: </b> and in no way whatsoever do I wish to blame mberends++, the chief author of Rakudo's current Temporal.pm. He's basically implemented things to spec... which is why the spec needs <a href='http://github.com/masak/temporal-flux-perl6syn/blob/master/S32-setting-library/Temporal.pod'>changing</a>, too.</p></p>
