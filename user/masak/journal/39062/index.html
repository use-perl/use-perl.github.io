<p>Yet another week of distraction, it turns out. Also, it's late when I start putting this post together, so I'll be brief. For once.</p>

<ul>
  <li>I have made some insignificant work on the Druid web app. I believe that this one is low-hanging fruit, because we already have an SVG module (two, in fact), and putting it to work with drawing a board would be a nice use-case. I had a head-scratching half hour of trying to figure out why the SVG wouldn't show up in the browser. After explaining the problem to mberends++ and having him test it, though, everything just worked. Typical. :)</li>
  <li>Ilya unfortunately had to back out of the rest of his Web.pm grant work, due to pressing external circumstances. We'll miss him, but Tene++ and I will keep churning away on the Web.pm grant, mapping his remaining 9 weeks to fall after my 11. Stay tuned for weeks 12-20, with some heavy MVC framework action.</li>
  <li>Due to this, I'll need to read up on MVC frameworks a bit. Will probably post about that too in the next few weeks, parallel to the Web.pm updates.</li>
  <li>I finally sat down and wrote those <a href="http://github.com/masak/web/commit/6918b4ee73ac2ca57302cadedf88c541ef56ec3a">Hitomi tests</a> I'd been planning to write. That in itself raised a number of new questions, which I hope to address when I start implementation/porting next week.</li>
</ul>

<p>I wish to thank The Perl Foundation for sponsoring the Web.pm effort.</p></p>

<h2>MVC</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/pozer/">pozer</a> on 2009-06-02T10:48:51</h3>
I read up about what an MVC is at Perl Catalyst's site. It was a fairly good read but the code was not to impressive.
Basically you come up with a default home page, make a method or subroutine that runs codes before any header prints, then your 2nt method/subroutine determines what location to send the user. If any none die errors or no location is requested it defaults to the default home page.

just to be clear, I stated on the VC part of the MVC. the M is your backend/database.

<p>Oh, I'm familiar with the concept MVC. Basically, it's just a standardized subdivision of concerns within an application. It's a bit more general than web apps, and has its roots in Smalltalk and early GUIs.</p><p>What I need to read up on is the actual MVC frameworks out there: Catalyst, Rails, Jifty... I'll probably do this by downloading them and trying them out, writing the same application over and over in each of them. I think it'll be interesting.</p>

<h2>Some View thing</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/raumwal/">raumwal</a> on 2009-06-02T11:59:04</h3>
As for the template-like view of Web.pm, if I may suggest you to take a look at Embperl: <a href="http://perl.apache.org/embperl/pod/doc/Embperl.htm" title="apache.org">http://perl.apache.org/embperl/pod/doc/Embperl.htm</a apache.org>
Which is quite "end-programmer" friendly and goes beyond the scope of mere templating, allowing for quick small site devs without the full (and sometimes cumbersome) MVC requirements.

<p>Thanks for the tip. I'll look into it.</p>

<h2>A question</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ZuLuuuuuu/">ZuLuuuuuu</a> on 2009-06-04T20:14:45</h3>
Hi,<br/><br/>Coming from ASP/PHP background and being a CGI newbie, sorry if my question is a little silly: are Web.pm web applications designed to work as CGI scripts? I asked that because web frameworks like Catalyst, RoR or Django does not work or work unusably slow when run as CGI scripts (and also require a lot of configuration I guess) so most of the time you cannot use them on shared hosting solutions which is bad for amateur web programmers.<br/><br/>In short, who are the target audience of Web.pm?
