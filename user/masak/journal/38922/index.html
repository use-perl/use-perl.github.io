<p>Things are moving forward. I'm enjoying myself within the Web.pm project, thinking of new ideas to try, and discussing a lot with other people. When looking at the milestones, it still feels like we're on track &#8212; though sometimes the "weeks" are slightly longer than seven days, due to the, er, intricacies of time allocation.</p>

<p>Anyway, this week was about 7 days long, and I used my 10 allocated hours for the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Absorbed and toyed with suggested drafts for Hitomi, sent in by moritz++ and Tene++. (Reminder: "Hitomi" is an XML templater, tightly modeled after Python's Genshi.) Both these drafts uncovered new bugs in Rakudo, most of which subsequently were fixed.</li>

<li>I like the grammar/actions approach arrived at in the latest iteration, but the thing is that actions, being fired in a bottom-up manner, are inadequate for a templater working top-down. I believe the actions should constitute a first pass over the template, building an abstract syntax tree whose nodes correspond to expression evaluations, for loops, and if statements. This tree can then be processed top-down. I've yet to see someone do this latter part. I don't believe it's difficult, just as-yet undone and therefore not entirely obvious.</li>

<li>One thing I look forward to in Hitomi is writing it on top of the Parrot Compiler Toolkit &#8212; same platform as Rakudo is written on &#8212; because that'll mean that the PIR generated can be targetted especially for templates, and thus hopefully a bit faster. While <a href="http://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6/2009-04-29#i_1103781">discussing</a> this with moritz, however, it became evident that there are backsides to tying Hitomi into a particular back-end. The <a href="http://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6/2009-04-29#i_1103850">conclusion</a> was that Hitomi will he a two-headed beast, one pure Perl 6 implementation and one PCT implementation. Both will run against the same test suite to keep things honest.</li>

<li>Continued fixing deficiencies in November so that I can port it over to <code>Web::Request</code> and <code>Web::Response</code>. As <code>STD.pm</code> and Rakudo evolve, atrocities from the past keep haunting us. That is, we've written things like <code>Hash %properties</code> in parameter lists, thinking that meant "the hash <code>%properties</code>". Suddenly, when parameter checking gets a little stricter, it turns out that it really means "the hash of hashes <code>%properties</code>", and things fail. Live and learn.</li>

<li>Similarly, there was a type check in the test that used <code>.WHAT eq</code> and broke when the return values of <code>.WHAT</code> suddenly changed. The <code>.WHAT eq</code> isn't Best Practices Perl 6 to begin with; it was a workaround becuase smartmatching didn't work in that particular case. The blocking bug had since been fixed, so I changed to smartmatching.</li>

<li>All tests now pass in <code>master</code>, just as they should. I've set up a <a href="http://feather.perl6.nl/user/masak/november-smoke.html">nightly smoke</a>, and I plan to expand this to both the bleeding Rakudo and the latest monthly release. That will give us excellent data for keeping November's <code>master</code> passing in the future.</li>

<li>In a local branch, I finally started on the translation work of s/CGI/Web.pm/. It feels great, but also raises a number of questions that I'll have to discuss with Ilya when he gets back, since he wrote many of the underpinnings of November. I hope to have something substantial to show by the end of next week.</li>
</ul>

<p>I wish to thank The Perl Foundation for sponsoring the Web.pm effort.</p></p>
