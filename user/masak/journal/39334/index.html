<div class="span8">
<p><p>I keep repeating how great Perl 6 is, because it is. But there are things I wish were different, and that I feel are accidents of history. Maybe they will change before Christmas rolls around, maybe not. But at least to my mind, they stand out as <em>emergent mistakes</em>, good features that combine to make something pretty bad.</p>

<p>Here they are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Methods and Pod</li>
  <li>Form syntax and string interpolation</li>
  <li>Comments in the beginning of lines</li>
</ul>

<p>Below, I'll go through each problem in detail.</p>

<p><b>Methods and Pod</b></p>

<p>Perl 6 has two ways of declaring package-like entities such as classes, roles and modules. One way is familiar from Perl 5, and looks like a single statement:</p>

<pre>class Austria;

# code here
</pre>

<p>The other is familiar from some other languages, and looks like a block:</p>

<pre>class Austria {
   # code here
}
</pre>

<p>For the purposes of this blog post, let's call these the <em>statement form</em> and <em>block form</em>, respectively.</p>

<p>The block form is supposed to be the general one, and you can tell from the spec because that's the one that doesn't have any restrictions to it. The statement form is restricted so that it may only occur once in a file, preferably (one might assume) somewhere at the top. In practice, this means that if you have one file with several classes in it, you'll have to use the block form. That's OK, because people like the block form anyway; that's the one they tend to use when no-one tells them not to.</p>

<p>Now, enter <a href="http://perlcabal.org/syn/S26.html">Pod</a>. Just like in Perl 5, the Pod directives are written on the leftmost column of the file, no exceptions. This has to do with parsing and stuff; it should be really easy to tell what's a Pod comment and what isn't. But look what happens: people will tend to use the block form for their classes, they will want to document them with Pod, and the result &#8212; indented methods and non-indented Pod &#8212; will be too hideously ugly for the poor Perl 6 programmer to bear. So they will have to use the more restricted statement form. They will cry a little, because they like the block form. But in the end, they will switch back to the statement form, because the alternative will be too ugly to think about.</p>

<p>There hasn't been much of an uproar about this, because people haven't started Pod-documenting their methods in earnest yet. I did it with the Druid classes, and went through all the above stages: shocked realization, sadness, and then switching to the statement form on a massive scale, at least if they decide to keep their method Pod.</p>

<p>We never had this problem in Perl 5, because Perl 5 doesn't have the block form. We haven't started having the problem in Perl 6, because Pod is in <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/masak/journal/38644">a state of limbo</a>, and people don't really know how to use it to document their methods anyway. But Pod and the block form for declaring classes (and stuff) don't mix well.</p>

<p><b>Form syntax and string interpolation</b></p>

<p><a href="http://dev.perl.org/perl6/doc/design/exe/E07.html">E07</a> was written long ago, in Internet years. Some time after that, the string interpolation changed, and <code>{...}</code> was appropriated to mean "this part of the string isn't part of the string".</p>

<p>So people will be bitten every time they use an interpolating string with the <code>form</code> function. This error will be caught as a syntax error at compile time, so it's not a critical flaw, just bloody annoying.</p>

<p>Matt-W++ is still building <a href="http://github.com/mattw/form/">Form.pm</a> for Perl 6, so this also hasn't become a real annoyance for people yet. But there's a corresponding thing with <code>eval</code> and interpolating strings that bites people all the time.</p>

<p>It's kinda double-edged: we all like <code>{...}</code> in interpolated strings, but it keeps coming back and biting us too, because we forget it's special syntax.</p>

<p><b>Comments in the beginning of lines</b></p>

<p>There was a long bikeshedding discussion about this some years ago. Perl 6 introduces <em>embedded comments</em>, comments which start with a <code>#</code> and then a bracketing character, with all the Unicode smorgasboard to choose from.</p>

<p>However, it was soon realized that people who commented things out by putting <code>#</code>s at the absolute beginning of lines might accidentally create embedded comments by placing their <code>#</code> next to a curly brace or a parenthesis or a bracket. So anything that looks like an embedded comment at the beginning of a line is now treated as a syntax error.</p>

<p>At this point I would like to add that this does not bother me very much. I have come to terms with this particular oddity of the language. But it took me a while, and I can still feel a lingering sense of dissatisfaction with Perl 6 causing me to (*gasp*) <em>change a habit</em>, and one I don't think is a particularly bad one to begin with. Perl is supposed to accomodate a large range of common programming styles, and quickly commenting out some lines by prefixing them with <code>#</code>s is pretty common.</p>

<p>I've now learned to put <code>##</code> at the beginning of lines I want to comment out instead of just <code>#</code>. This takes care of any unintended embedded comments. So things are fine over here; I'm just worried that a lot of people will feel significant pain when they go through the same process of realization.</p>

<p>I'm not sure embedded comments are all that useful. I seem to find a use for them sometimes in one-liners, but very seldom in other circumstances. Are they really worth the special-casing of a common development technique?</p>

<p><b>In conclusion</b></p>

<p>Perl 6 (the spec) is lovely, except in spots. It also isn't finished yet. I like the fact that I can complain like this in a blog post, and smart people will pick my arguments apart, or mull over them and propose improvements for the synopses. All the above three misfeatures are hard to solve because they arise as consequences of features we want, and so fixing the emergent problems would mean going back and changing the features somehow. That's hard.</p>

<p>As usual, feel free to comment. I'm the only one I know who has been severely bitten by the first and the last things, but I'd love to hear if others have too, and how they felt about it.</p></p>

Frankly, I <em>don't</em> want my methods to be flush left because if I scan down the code, I like my indentation to instantly give me a hint of scope.  If the method is indented, that gives me information that left justification won't.  So let's say I have two classes in one package. The structure can look like this:</p><blockquote><div><p> <tt>class<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; method<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; method<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; method<br>end<br>class<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; method<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; method<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; method<br>end</tt></p></div> </blockquote><p>I can see at a glance we have a second class there.

<p>Thank you, Ovid. You put words to what was only an indistinct feeling for me. I agree fully, I also don't want to sacrifice indentation within classes.</p><p>But I also want my Pod. Maybe I'll end up putting the Pod at the end of each file, and then writing some tests to make sure the Pod doesn't drift away from the methods themselves.</p>

<p>I agree that indenting methods relative to classes does look better, and I even do that myself some times.</p><p>Mainly I find that the indenting works best when individual classes are fairly small in the amount of code department, and similarly in those cases I generally don't use the dividing lines I mention.</p><p>Where I don't find indenting necessary is when classes are large or there are a number of large methods (ones that fill a screen or more), so that say you've got hundreds to thousands or more of code lines in one class.  Generally speaking, indenting is more valuable within a local context than within a much wider context.</p><p>The main reason I have methods flush-left within larger classes is that horizontal screen real-estate is valuable and it seems a waste to not use a whole indent level for many thousands of code lines in order for exactly 2 lines to be further left than those.  Especially since I strictly limit my line lengths to 75 characters and I use 4 character indents.</p><p>My practice has nothing to do with pod.  In fact, I think mixing pod with code is a bad idea, and I put all my pod at the end of the file.  While I keep my docs for classes and methods in the same order as their corresponding code in general, I believe in writing documentation for the users, and it can be more natural if it is separate; similarly the code can be easier to read.</p><p>I write # comments in the few cases where code actually should be explained for code-readers beyond what the user pod says.</p><p>So if people want to indent methods, I have no objection save ineffectualness and wasted space.</p><p>I will say though, that regardless of whether I indent methods in a class, I always indent other class contents like attribute declarations.</p>

<h2>The root problem is interspersing code with POD</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/abw/">abw</a> on 2009-07-24T06:50:10</h3>
<p>
I have to say, I find the whole idea of POD interspersed with code quite loathsome.  It appreciate all the reasons why it's a Good Thing (which boils down to keeping the docs as close to the code as possible), but it has so many drawbacks.
</p><p>
Most notably, it makes it hard to skim through the code when there's big globs of POD getting in the way.  If I'm reading the source then it's code I want to concentrate on.  If it's the end-user documentation that I want then I'll use perldoc or look at an HTML version of the docs.
</p><p>
It reminds me of the Bad Old Days when CGI scripts were written as an impenetrable mix of Perl code and HTML markup.  We learned our lesson on this a long time ago - a separation of concerns is a good thing.
</p><p>
Another problem is that it forces you to write your POD to match the structure of your code or vice versa.  This is wrong.  The end-user documentation should be written from the perspective of someone wanting to <i>use</i> the module.  This is an entirely separate thing from the way that the module is implemented internally.  After all, that's what programming is about - creating "black box" abstractions that <i>hide</i> the details of the internal workings.
</p><p>
IMHO, code should be interspersed with <i>comments</i> to explain how the code works, and the end-user POD documentation should be placed at the end of the file.  That way you don't have any of the problems with Perl code getting mixed up with POD. Things are badly wrong when you have to change your coding/indenting styling to fit in with the embedded documentation.
</p><p>
But that's just my HO, of course.  Each to his/her own.
</p>

<h3><a href="/user/Hercynium/">Hercynium</a> on 2009-07-27T18:20:49</h3>
I think you've touched upon something that leads to the root of the issue - the fact that there are several different types of documentation that is produced, each with different display needs and different audiences, and possibly different authors.<br>
<br>
Like you said, comments are written by the programmer, for other programmers (including oneself) and are intended to communicate knowledge about the nearby code.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, POD's purpose is a little more loosely defined. POD is usually written by the programmer, usually for the end-user of the code, usually with the purpose of being displayed separately from the code.<br>
<br>
Notice I used the word "usually" a lot there.<br>
<br>
What this suggests to me is that POD's purpose is probably being stretched a little too far. POD seems to suffer from the problem of being a documentation jack-of-all-trades - and master of none.

<h2>Re:The root problem is interspersing code with POD</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/vrk/">vrk</a> on 2009-08-11T09:29:38</h3>
<p>
Exactly! POD is indeed used for multiple purposes; some people have even authored books written in POD.
</p><p>
However, I find the debate between "POD interspersers" and "POD separatists" boils down to only two usages of POD. The first is to document the API, which is a low-level documentation from one programmer to another. The second is to document the program, which is a high-level documentation from the programmer to the user. Incidentally these two use cases follow closely the preferences of "POD interspersers" and "POD separatists", respectly!
</p><p>
I tend to intersperse POD liberally with my code. For each method or function, I dedicate a third level heading and a description (a paragraph or two, maybe a list or two). These, in turn, are roughly grouped into categories under second level POD headings, if possible. Often it _is_ possible, since Perl is quite flexible in subroutine definition placement.
</p><p>
While many programmers find it hard to scan and read the code in this case, I find it both easier and liberating. Easier, because there is not only the code but also the intent of the programmer right in front of my eyes (assuming the documentation is up to date...); liberating, because I can start writing the API documentation before I have written a single line of code, and then just fill in the gaps between paragraphs. It also enforces a high-level structure that wraps the code module into a narrative one can read from start to end -- or jump into using the table of contents.
</p><p>
However, this is clearly low-level documentation. I often add user documentation at the top of the file in a separate DESCRIPTION or SYNOPSIS section, or just create a separate POD file for those.
</p><p>
Coming back to the raised issues, POD is a valuable tool for many purposes. I don't think it's stretched too far. Part of the reason why it can be used in so varied cases is its simplicity, and also because it is like a traditional comment on steroids: it can be easily extracted. With POD syntax, one can mark which comments communicate high-level information and which do not.
</p><p>
With that in mind, I agree with masak: it should be possible to indent POD blocks with arbitrary whitespace. They may not be as visually separated from the code as they are now, though. Doesn't this indicate a change in syntax is required?
