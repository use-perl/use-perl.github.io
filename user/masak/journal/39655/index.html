<p>Last time, I wrote "We'll see if <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/masak/journal/39513">Viper</a> survives in any form. I wouldn't be surprised if it's replaced quickly by something much better." That was what happened. mst++ recommended I check out <a href="http://sequel.rubyforge.org/">Sequel</a>, which I did. There's no question Sequel is a better starting point than ActiveRecord.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The port of Sequel received the name Squerl. I quickly threw together functionality to <a href="http://github.com/masak/web/blob/master/t/squerl/01-sqlite-write.t">mimic</a> what I had in Viper. That was two weeks ago.</li>
  <li>Since then, I've successively been porting over tests for the central class in Sequel: <code>Dataset</code>. If you're interested in the workings of this class, I recommend the <a href="http://github.com/jeremyevans/sequel/blob/master/README.rdoc">Sequel README.rdoc</a>. If that doesn't quench your thirst for knowledge, I recommend the beautifully-written <a href="http://github.com/jeremyevans/sequel/blob/master/lib/sequel/dataset.rb">dataset.rb</a> and <a href="http://github.com/jeremyevans/sequel/blob/master/lib/sequel/dataset/sql.rb">dataset/sql.rb</a>. One can tell that this code is written by people who know stuff.</li>
  <li>When porting, I'm using a quickly thrown-together version of <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/masak/journal/39639">tote</a>. A bastardisation of the idea, basically; once I had outlined the idea of tote, I just couldn't stand the thought of working without such a framework. The results are significant. Maybe it's the effect of just using some new framework, I don't know. But I look forward to writing the real tote.</li>
  <li>The increased programming activity has led to increased bug reporting activity. That makes me feel a bit relieved; for a while there I wasn't reporting as many bugs &#8212; I thought maybe we were running out of them. &#21704;&#21704;</li>
  <li>I've really been working two weeks' worth of grant work lately, but haven't gotten around to blogging. Therefore, I'll keep this post short, and get back to my TDD-on-crack coding, and then hopefully give another short update later in the week. In that post, I promise to tell you how to use this new database module in your own Perl 6 projects! Until then, you'll just have to use <a href="http://github.com/masak/web/tree/master/t/squerl/">the tests</a> as guidance.</li>
</ul>

<p>I wish to thank The Perl Foundation for sponsoring the Web.pm effort.</p></p>
