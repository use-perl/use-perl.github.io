<p><p>It is with a mien of amusement that I want to announce, on behalf of the whole
Yapsi development team, the June 2010 release of Yapsi, a Perl 6 compiler
written in Perl 6.</p>

<p>You can get it <a href='http://github.com/downloads/masak/yapsi/yapsi-2010.06.tar.gz'>here</a>.</p>

<p>Yapsi is implemented in Perl 6. It thus requires a Perl 6 implementation to
build and run. We recommend the 'alpha' branch of Rakudo for this purpose.</p>

<p>Yapsi releases are 'official and complete', shown here by a circular argument:
clearly an official thing like Yapsi must be complete, and Synopsis 1 states
that anything complete is official. QED. Yapsi passes 100% of its test suite.</p>

<p>Instructions for getting Yapsi up and running:</p>

<ol>
<li> Make sure you have a built Rakudo alpha in your $PATH as 'alpha'.</li>
<li> Download Yapsi from <a href='http://github.com/masak/yapsi/downloads'>github</a>.</li>
<li> ...</li>
<li>Profit!</li>
</ol>

<p>The third (optional) step consists of running 'make' in the Yapsi directory.
This will precompile Yapsi, making startup times much more bearable.</p>

<p>The big news since last month is that Yapsi now has a logotype. It's a
picture of a MÃÂ¶bius band, to symbolize self-loopiness, recursion and
twisted ideas.</p>

<p>Yapsi consists of a compiler and a runtime. The program is compiled down into
an instruction code called SIC, which doesn't stand for anything [sic]. All SIC
listings start with a versioning line saying e.g. "This is SIC v2010.06". At
this point during Yapsi development, we provide no guarantees about backwards
compatibility whatsoever. Expect breakage between monthly releases.</p>

<p>An overarching goal for making a Perl 6 compiler-and-runtime is to use it as
a server for various other projects, which will hook in at different steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>A time-traveling debugger (tardis), which will hook into the runtime.</li>
<li>A coverage tool (lid), which will also hook into the runtime.</li>
<li>A syntax checker (sigmund), which will use output from the parser.</li>
</ol>

<p>Another overarching goal is to optimize for fun while learning about parsers,
compilers, and runtimes. We wish you the appropriate amount of fun!</p>
