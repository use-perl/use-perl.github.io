<div class="span8">
<p><p>So <code>Str</code> and <code>Buf</code> aren't merely there in Perl 6 to separate out the two related concepts "sequence of characters" and "sequence of bytes", respectively. They're there to institute a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_relativity">whorfian discipline</a> where <strong>it won't even be possible to think the wrong thoughts,</strong> about strings and sequences of bytes.</p>

<p>This is the natural consequence of working Joel Spolsky's <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/Unicode.html">"There Ain't No Such Thing As Plain Text"</a> into the language design. By all means, treat real strings as <code>Str</code>, but make sure byte sequences can't cross that moat without being decoded somehow. Perl 5 totally blurs the distinction, as <a href="http://perlgeek.de/en/article/encodings-and-unicode">moritz++ explains</a>. It is not alone among programming languages in that respect. In fact, I'd be interested to hear about some language that makes the same <code>Str</code>/<code>Buf</code> distinction as Perl 6.</p>

<p>It took me a while to reach this point, but now it seems perfectly obvious. I remember, only a few weeks ago, being shook by TimToady's claim that <code>Str</code>s do not know their byte sequence in the general case. But I see it now. <strong>A Perl 6 string is not a sequence of bytes.</strong> It's a sequence of characters, at least by default. Likewise, a <code>Buf</code> is not a sequence of characters, not even metaphorically. It's a sequence of integer values. And the difference isn't some picky play with words, but the encoding/decoding step itself.</p>

<p>This is the act of building knowledge into the class hierarchy of the language itself, so that people's thoughts will be channeled in the right direction. "Arrgh, why can't I get the number of bytes on this <code>Str</code> object? Oh look, the manual says I have to convert to <code>Buf</code> to do that. Oh look, I have to supply an <code>$encoding</code> parameter to do that. I don't see why, but fair enough &#8212; if that's the price for using all the other cool stuff in Perl 6."</p>

<p>The battle of encoding-aware programs is won, not necessarily through making the programmers aware of encodings, but to make the language provide primitives that Do The Right Thing.</p></p>

<h2>Graphemes rather than characters</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/cowens/">cowens</a> on 2009-07-06T15:21:27</h3>
<p>Just a quibble, but I believe it is more correct to say a string in Perl 6 is made up of graphemes rather than characters.  The two Perl 5 strings "\x{F6}" (LATIN SMALL LETTER O WITH DIAERESIS) (and "\x{6F}\x{308}" (LATIN SMALL LETTER O and COMBINING DIAERESIS) should be the same string in Perl 6 (unless the codes pragma is turned on).</p>

<p>Yes, you are right. The Perl 6 spec is full of references to "characters", but in a few places it mentions that this term defaults to being the same as "graphemes".</p><p>I think my growing familiarity with Unicode is not yet at the stage where I immediately reach for the term "graphemes".<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) Maybe some day.</p>

<h2>Babel-17</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jmm/">jmm</a> on 2009-07-06T17:54:53</h3>
<tt>This "you can't think the wrong thoughts" target reminds me of the novel Babel-17 by Samuel Delaney which uses the same sort of concept but in a human language that causes the person who thinks in that language to automatically think the right thoughts in a very powerful way.</tt>

<h2>Re:Babel-17</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/masak/">masak</a> on 2009-09-12T11:48:33</h3>
<p>I think the idea is sufficiently old. Umberto Eco details various attempts made during the years in his book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Search-Perfect-Language-Making-Europe/dp/0631174656" title="amazon.com">The Search for a Perfect Language</a amazon.com>. Newspeak in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/1984-60th-Anniversary-Plume-George-Orwell/dp/0452262933" title="amazon.com">1984</a amazon.com> has words selectively pruned from it so that dangerous thought becomes difficult or impossible.</p>

<h2>What of binary manipulation?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Aristotle/">Aristotle</a> on 2009-07-06T19:26:09</h3>
<p>So if I want to find a &#8220;magic number&#8221; byte sequence in a binary file, how do I do that in Perl&#160;6?</p>



<blockquote>

<h2>Re:What of binary manipulation?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/masak/">masak</a> on 2009-07-06T20:18:53</h3>
<p>According to <a href="http://perlcabal.org/syn/S32/IO.html#IO%3A%3AFileNode" title="perlcabal.org">S32/IO</a perlcabal.org>, the return type of <code>slurp</code> (which reads a whole file at once) is <code>Str|Buf</code>. A <code>Buf</code> is returned when a parameter<nobr> <wbr></nobr><code>:bin</code> is passed to <code>slurp</code>. After that, you can treat the <code>Buf</code> you get as an array (because <code>Buf does Positional</code>, and do as advanced indexing operations as you need to find your byte sequence.</p><p>I wish I could show this with real, working code, but <code>Buf</code> isn't implemented just yet in Rakudo.</p>

<h2>Re:What of binary manipulation?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Aristotle/">Aristotle</a> on 2009-07-07T00:46:01</h3>
<p>What kind of pattern matching facilities does <code>Buf</code> support?</p>



<blockquote>

<h2>Re:What of binary manipulation?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/masak/">masak</a> on 2009-07-07T10:54:17</h3>
<p>The spec is a bit silent on that point, so I <a href="http://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6/2009-07-07#i_1294238" title="perlgeek.de">asked on #perl6</a perlgeek.de>. The conclusion seems to be "convert it to a string if you want to pattern match".</p><p>Then again, if smartmatching with list semantics is what you're after, that should work. Something like <code>$buf ~~ (*, 104, 101, 108, 108, 111, *)</code> to find "hello" in an ASCII-encoded Buf.</p>

<h2>Java does (almost) the same</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/dakkar/">dakkar</a> on 2009-07-07T08:34:04</h3>
In Java, a java.lang.String and a byte[] have nothing in common, and there are no (non-deprecated) ways of converting between them without specifying an encoding.<br/><br/>It's one of the very few features I like about Java&#226;&#8364;&#166;

<h3><a href="/user/Dom2/">Dom2</a> on 2009-07-09T18:47:03</h3>
There are (at least) two things wrong with Java's encoding support:<br/><br/><ol>
<li>No way to avoid UnsupportedEncodingException, even for UTF-8, which is guaranteed to be present.</li><li>The concept of a "system default encoding" is flawed and leads to bugs in portability.  You should be forced to always specify an encoding.</li></ol>

<li>true</li><li>I thought all methods that converted without specifying an enconding were deprecated&#226;&#8364;&#166; anyway, yes, implicit encondings are a very bad idea</li></ol><p>

and while we're at it,

</p><p>3. internal enconding is utf-16, and it's visible at the language level, so that the "length" method gives you completely useless information</p>

Very true about the 16 bit character.  Thankfully, it's less of a problem for me right now.
