<div class="span8">
<p><p>I thought I'd have an easy time today, just regurgitating what <a href='http://perlcabal.org/syn/S04.html'>S04</a> says about "Loop statements". Perl 5 already got this part pretty right already. Actually, even C got it pretty right. So what new does Perl 6 have to offer? That's what this post is about.</p>

<p>So, nothing much has changed about the <code>while</code> and <code>until</code> loops that we know and love.</p>

<p><code>
while EXPR { ... }<br>
until EXPR { ... }<br>
</code></p>

<p>Then there's the kind of loop when you want to test the condition *after* the block has run, rather than before. In Perl 5, that looks like this:</p>

<p><code>
do { ... } while EXPR;<br>
do { ... } until EXPR;<br>
</code></p>

<p>This construct tends to cause fresh Perl programmers a lot of grief, since <code>do</code> isn't really a loop construct. There's some wording about this in <a href='http://perldoc.perl.org/perlsyn.html'>perldoc perlsyn</a>:</p>

<p><quote>Note also that the loop control statements described later will NOT work in this construct, because modifiers donÃ¢â¬â¢t take loop labels.  Sorry.</quote></p>

<p>Perl 6 solves this by</p>

<ul>
  <li>recognizing and disallowing <code>while</code> and <code>until</code> after <code>do</code> blocks, and</li>
  <li>introducing the <code>repeat</code> block.</li>
</ul>

<p>So now you write it like this instead:</p>

<p><code>
repeat { ... } while EXPR;<br>
repeat { ... } until EXPR;<br>
</code></p>

<p>And you get two bonus features from this: first, since the <code>while</code> or <code>until</code> is mandatory, you can put it on its own line. Generally, closing line-ending curlies act like they have implicit semicolons after them in Perl 6, but here the parser is smart enough to expect a <code>while</code> or <code>until</code>, so it doesn't put one in.</p>

<p>Second, you're allowed to put the condition up front if you want:</p>

<p><code>
repeat while EXPR { ... }<br>
repeat until EXPR { ... }<br>
</code></p>

<p>Even though the condition is <em>before</em> the loop here, it'll still not be run until <em>after</em> each iteration, because it's a <code>repeat</code> loop, and they work like that.</p>

<p>Then there's the loop construct that loops forever, aptly named <code>loop</code>:</p>

<p><code>
loop { ... }
</code></p>

<p>In C, we'd have that as <code>for (;;) { ... }</code>. And, symmetrically, you can also write it like this in Perl 6:</p>

<p><code>
loop (;;) { ... }
</code></p>

<p>Or, more generally, you can do any C-style for loop, if you just spell it <code>loop</code>:</p>

<p><code>
loop (EXPR; EXPR; EXPR) { ... }
</code></p>

<p>And what was known alternately in Perl 5 as <code>for</code> and <code>foreach</code> becomes just <code>for</code> in Perl 6.</p>

<p>The syntax for <code>for</code> in Perl 6 is what you'd expect:</p>

<p><code>
for EXPR { ... }
</code></p>

<p>But it packs a lot more power underneath. Or rather, the whole <em>language</em> is geared towards packing <code>for</code> with a lot more power. Some examples:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If you want to name the item you're currently looping over, just prefix the block with <code>-&gt; $a</code>. (If you don't, you'll find the item in <code>$_</code>, as usual.)</li>
  <li>If you want to loop two items at a time, prefix the block with <code>-&gt; $a, $b</code>.</li>
  <li>Neither of the above are special syntaxes belonging to the <code>for</code> construct as such; rather, the <code>-&gt;</code> arrows belong to the block, making it, in the prevailing terminology,  a "pointy block". In fact, <em>all</em> of the loop constructs I've brought up (except the C-style loop) can be given pointy blocks; the expression will then be bound to the variable and usable from within the block. You can do it with <code>if</code> statements, too! It's quite useful.</li>
  <li>If you want to loop over two lists simultaneously, you can use the <code>infix:&lt;Z&gt;</code> operator to interleave the lists. Loop one item at a time, and you'll get alternating elements from the two lists. Loop two at a time, and <code>$a</code> (or whatever) will always be from the first list, and <code>$b</code> from the second. Gone are the days when you had to do manual trickery with indexes and stuff because the <code>for</code> loop wasn't powerful enough.</li>
  <li>You can even eliminate nested loops sometimes with the <code>infix:&lt;X&gt;</code> operator, which does a Cartesian product (known in SQL circles as a "cross join") of two lists. So if you planned to do <code>for @a { for @b { ... } }</code> anyway, you might as well do <code>for @a X @b { ... }</code> and save yourself one level of indentation.</li>
  <li>All of the above is lazy, so with a sensible Perl 6 implementation, there's no huge memory waste from building up all these big lists; it's all generated on-the-fly. (This, incidentally, means that we also read files with <code>for</code> loops in Perl 6, rather than with a magical <code>while</code> construct as in Perl 5.)</li>
</ul>

<p>That's it for today. I forgot to mention the looping construct that only loops over <em>one</em> item... but you can look that one up yourself. Oh, and Perl 5.10 also has it.</p>

<p>Actually, I got to thinking about all this, since I figured out the other day how to do the <code>FIRST</code> and <code>LAST</code> phasers in Yapsi. But this blog post felt like a natural precursor to the one I wanted to write. Hopefully soon. &#21704;&#21704;</p></p>

<p>I'll take that as a sign that posts about aspects of Perl 6 that I take for granted nowadays can be interesting to others.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-) Thanks for the feedback. I'll see if I can gear my output more towards these explanatory posts.</p>
