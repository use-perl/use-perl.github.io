<h1>A standard logging API</h1>
<h2><a href="/user/jonswar/">jonswar</a> on 2007-09-06T21:52:13</h2>
</div> <!-- /span4 -->


<div class="span8">
<p>It seems as if every CPAN module has its own way of logging debug information and error conditions. For example:<p>

<ul>
<li>LWP - activate by use'ing LWP::Debug; outputs to STDERR
<li>DBI - activate by calling DBI->trace(); outputs to STDERR or a file
<li>Rose::DB - activate by setting various $Debug package variables; outputs to STDERR
<li>Encode::* - activate by modifying various DEBUG subroutines to return 1; outputs using warn()
<li>Apache::* - activate by setting the Apache log level and restarting; outputs to the Apache logs
</ul>

In addition, there must be CPAN modules that have interesting things to say but choose not to log at all, because they don't want to invent another logging mechanism or become dependent on an existing one.<p><p>

This situation is pretty much the opposite of what I want when developing a large application. I want a single way to turn logging on and off, and to control where logs get sent, for all of the modules I'm using.<p><p>

This being Perl, there are many fine logging frameworks available: Log::Log4perl, Log::Dispatch, Log::Handler, Log::Agent, Log::Trivial, etc. So why do CPAN modules eschew the use of these and invent their own mechanisms that are almost guaranteed to be less powerful?<p>

<ul>
<li>The very existence of so many logging modules means that there is no one standard that a CPAN author would feel comfortable binding their users to. As usual, TMTOWTDI is a double-edged sword.<p>
<li>A logging framework can be a significant dependency for a module to have, easily dwarfing the size of the module itself. For small modules that want to minimize dependencies, depending on Log4perl (for example) is a non-starter.
</ul>

<b>A Common Log API</b><p><p>

One thing to notice is that while the logging frameworks all differ in their configuration and activation API, and the set of features they support, the API to log messages is generally quite simple. At its core it consists of<p>

<ul>
<li>A set of valid log levels, e.g. debug, info, warn, error, fatal
<li>Methods to log a message at a particular level, e.g. $log->debug()
<li>Methods to determine if a particular level is activated, e.g. $log->is_debug()
</ul>

I expect most CPAN modules would happily stick to this API, and let the application worry about configuring what's getting logged and where it's going. Therefore...<p><p>

<b>Proposed Module: Log::Any</b><p><p>

I propose a small module called Log::Any that provides this API, with no dependencies and no logging implementation of its own. Log::Any would be designed to be linked by the main application to an existing logging framework.<p><p>

A CPAN module would use it like this:<p>

<pre>
    package Foo;
    use Log::Any;
    my $log = Log::Any->get_logger(category => __PACKAGE__);

    $log->error("an error occurred");

    $log->debug("arguments are: " . Dumper(\@_))
        if $log->is_debug();
</pre>

By default, methods like $log->debug would be no-ops, and methods like $log->is_debug() would return false.<p><p>

As a convenient shorthand, you can use<p>

<pre>
    package Foo;
    use Log::Any qw($log);
</pre>

to create the logger, which is equivalent to the first example except that $log is (necessarily) a package-scoped rather than lexical variable.<p><p>

How does an application activate logging? The low-level way is to call Log::Any->set_logger_factory (better name pending) with a single argument: a subroutine that takes a log category and returns a logger object implementing the standard logging API above. The log category is typically the class doing the logging, and it may be ignored.<p><p>

For example, to link with Log::Log4perl:<p>

<pre>
    use Log::Any;
    use Log::Log4perl;

    Log::Log4perl->init("log.conf");
    Log::Any->set_logger_factory
       (sub { Log::Log4perl->get_logger(@_) });
</pre>

To link with Log::Dispatch, with all categories going to the screen:<p>

<pre>
    use Log::Any;
    use Log::Dispatch;

    my $dispatcher = Log::Dispatch::Screen->new(...);
    Log::Any->set_logger_factory(sub { $dispatcher });
</pre>

To link with Log::Dispatch, with different categories going to different dispatchers:<p>

<pre>
    use Log::Any;
    use Log::Dispatch;

    my $dispatcher_screen = Log::Dispatch::Screen->new(...);
    my $dispatcher_file   = Log::Dispatch::File->new(...);

    sub choose_dispatcher {
        my $category = shift;
        $category =~ /DBI|LWP/ ? $dispatcher_file : $dispatcher_screen;
    }
    Log::Any->set_logger_factory(\&choose_dispatcher);
</pre>

This API is a little awkward for the average user. One solution is for logging frameworks themselves to provide more convenient mixins, e.g.:<p><p>

<pre>
   use Log::Dispatch;   # this also defines Log::Any::use_log_dispatch
   my $d = Log::Dispatch::File->new(...);
   Log::Any->use_log_dispatch($d);  # calls set_logger_factory for you

   use Log::Log4perl;   # this also defines Log::Any::use_log4perl
   Log::Any->use_log4perl();        # calls set_logger_factory for you
</pre>

set_logger_factory would be implemented so as to take effect on all existing as well as future loggers. Any $log objects already created inside modules will automatically be switched when set_logger_factory is called. (i.e. $log will probably be a thin proxy object.) This means that Log::Any need not be initialized by the time it is used in CPAN modules, and it allows set_logger_factory to be called more than once per application.<p><p>

<b>Promoting Use</b><p>

For Log::Any to be useful, a substantial number of modules - especially major modules - would have to adopt its use. Fortunately, with its minimal footprint and standalone nature, authors should not find Log::Any a difficult dependency to add. Existing logging mechanisms, such as LWP::Debug and $DBI::tfh, could easily be converted to write *both* to their existing output streams and to Log::Any. This would preserve backward compatibility for existing applications, but allow new applications to benefit from more powerful logging. I would be willing to submit such patches to major module authors to get things going.<p><p>

Feedback welcome. Thanks!<p><p>

I'm not sure why, but I think the API lacks a certain elegance.<br><br>Personally I'd have done the name'ology differently (although tbh I'm not sure what I'd have used instead).<br>

Upon re-reading I think two things I'm not a fan of are the "Any" suffix, and the use of package-named class-level storage.<br><br>What if I want to make an logger for a single object...

As far as the package-named class-level storage: the "use Log::Any qw($log)" syntax is just a convenient shorthand that, imho, will be good enough for some modules. If you are uncomfortable with this, you can use the more standard syntax<br><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; my $log = Log::Any-&gt;get_logger(category =&gt; '...');<br><br>and you would use this to create a lexically scoped logger or a logger contained in an object.<br><br>As far as the "Any" name - I agree, it isn't ideal, but I haven't been able to think of a better alternative. The problem is that most log frameworks already have a generic sounding name - e.g. Log::Dispatch - so somehow I have to name this in a way that distinguishes it from yet another logging framework.<br>

I don't mean for $log, I mean for "category =&gt; '...'.<br><br>That implies you are keeping inside Log::Any a hash of some sort with the class as the key and an object or log class as the value. That's what I meant by the class-level storage.<br><br>As for<nobr> <wbr></nobr>::Any, I notice that Log::Abstract seems to be unused at the moment, if you do a CPAN search for "Abstract" and have a read through some of the modules there, there is a precent for this general type of thing.<br>

That is, given two calls<br><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; my $logger1 = Log::Abstract-&gt;get_logger("foo");<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; my $logger2 = Log::Abstract-&gt;get_logger("foo");<br><br>wouldn't these pretty much have to return the same logger, unless the routine passed to set_logger() was changing its behavior over time?<br><br>Remember that set_logger can be called more than once in an application to effectively change all existing abstract loggers.

I got the impression that all CPAN modules should use the logging interface, but not set any logger themselves.<br>So the only place the logger would be set would be in your 'top level' application, or framework (catalyst, jifty, etc).



<blockquote>

<h2>Re:Some nits to pick</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jonswar/">jonswar</a> on 2007-09-07T18:14:28</h3>
That's exactly right. Since the setting of Log::Abstract is (by design) global across the application, it would be considered bad behavior for an arbitrary CPAN module to muck with it, in the same way it would be bad behavior to unset $^W, or clear @ARGV, or read from STDIN - unless that was part of the proscribed behavior of the module.<br>

You're right, that was a poorly chosen example. Yes, $log-&gt;debug() won't do anything unless debugging was enabled. Here's a more appropriate use of the conditional:<br><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; $log-&gt;debug("current args: " . Dumper(\@_))<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; if $log-&gt;is_debug();<br><br>The idea is to use the conditional when you don't want to compute the arguments (in this case, Dumper()) unnecessarily.<br>

<h2>Great work, and can I have stealth loggers?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Perlmeister/">Perlmeister</a> on 2007-09-08T20:32:58</h3>
Hi Jonathan,

you're addressing something really important here.
<p>
 It is really
unfortunate that important CPAN modules like LWP or Rose::DB don't have
usable logging mechanisms in place. Once you're used to category-based
logging it's hard to go back to these home-grown and less convenient
solutions.
</p><p>
I think it's a great idea to promote standardized logging on CPAN and
letting the user choose the actual implementation will definitely help
to make strides towards that goal.
</p><p>
By the way, I don't agree that "For small modules that want to minimize
dependencies, depending on Log4perl (for example) is a non-starter." The
Log4perl core doesn't have dependencies other than perl's core modules.
</p><p>
One thing missing from your proposal is Log4perl's<nobr> <wbr></nobr><a href="http://log4perl.sourceforge.net/releases/Log-Log4perl/docs/html/Log/Log4perl.html#579d1" title="sourceforge.net">:easy mode</a sourceforge.net>. If you
think about it, getting a logger and calling its method is a lot of
typing, given that you just want to log something. That's why in
Log4perl you can use
</p><p>
    <tt>DEBUG "Log this!";</tt>
</p><p>
and you're done. No getting a logger, no method calling, no category
passing. It's all automatic. Behind the scenes, it gets a 'stealth
logger' with the category set to the current package and calls the
appropriate logging method on it. This feature is huge. I'm using it
almost exclusively in everything I write.
</p><p>
Any chance of adding that?
</p><p>
One thing to watch out for is performance. People don't want their applications to slow down just because a module has a logging capability. Ideally, it could just be de-compiled, Log4perl has an experimental feature called <a href="http://log4perl.sourceforge.net/releases/Log-Log4perl/docs/html/Log/Log4perl.html#f2bf4" title="sourceforge.net">resurrect</a sourceforge.net> which does something along these lines, although it's somewhat hacky.
</p><p>
Keep up the great work!
</p><p>
-- Mike Schilli</p>

So I proposed we export a live $log_is_debug variable that would change dynamically to reflect the current level.<br><br>I suppose one could combine the syntaxes:<br><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; DEBUG "Current arguments: " . Dumper(\@_) if $log_is_debug;<br><br>but at this point you are only saving 6 characters or so.<br><br>&gt;<br>&gt; One thing to watch out for is performance. People don't want<br>&gt; their applications to slow down just because a module has a<br>&gt; logging capability.<br><br>Exactly my point above.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br><br>Thanks for your positive feedback! I will definitely need to have the support of major logging frameworks such as log4perl for this module to be a success.<br>

&gt; So this creates a logger for you with the category set to the current<br>&gt; package, similar to easy mode. The syntax is pretty minimal.<br><br>Ah, gotcha. So you would call<br><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; $log-&gt;debug(...)<br><br>instead of<br><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; DEBUG "..."<br><br>which is probably acceptable in terms of additional key strokes<br>(although it might throw off novices).<br><br>&gt; The  problem I have with the DEBUG etc keywords is that they promote<br>&gt;inefficient behavior. e.g.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;      DEBUG "Current arguments: " . Dumper(\@_);<br>&gt;<br>&gt; will take the performance hit for Dumper() even when debug logging<br>&gt; isn't turned on.<br><br>Sure, although I don't see how<br><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; $log-&gt;debug("Current arguments: " . Dumper(\@_));<br><br>is any different. By the way, in Log4perl you can pass a subroutine ref<br>to the method, which eliminates the problem:<br><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; DEBUG sub { "Current arguments: " . Dumper(\@_) };<br><br>Efficient, but ugly<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:).<br><br>While you're at it, here's my pipe dream: I want something like Dtrace,<br>where the logging framework zeroes out the opcodes that are currently<br>inactive, and the interpreter rushes through them at light speed with<br>practically no overhead.<br>

<p>Assertions were going to make that possible in 5.10.</p>

<p>Unfortunately they were recently removed from bleadperl.<nobr> <wbr></nobr><tt>:-(</tt> </p>

I just stumbled across this thread, and I must admit - it's exactly what I was thinking about for the past few weeks... I need logging, but don't want to tie my users to un-wanted dependencies. Better yet, is that the users could *choose* their preferred logging deps.<br><br>Is there any code out in the wild yet? I may have a few CPAN-bound uses for it!
