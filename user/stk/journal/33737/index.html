<div class="span8">
<p><p>A little over a year ago, during YAPC::NA in Chicago (thanks <a href = "http://perlcast.com">Josh</a> and company!) , I created an account here as a place to put down my notes and any other Perl bits I needed to remember.  Like other YAPCs I'd attended, there was so much to absorb and to try at home and $work that I wanted to get it all down someplace.</p>

<p>Well, a year has passed, <a href = "http://conferences.mongueurs.net/yn2007/">YAPC::NA 2007</a> is over and I'm finally getting around to posting. I couldn't make it to Houston this year so the irony here is that I don't have anything to write. :-) </p>

<p>An e-mail to <a href = "http://use.perl.org/user/brian_d_foy/journal/">brian d foy</a> about <a href = "http://theperlreview.com">The Perl Review</a> triggered something in my memory that I had created this account but hadn't done anything. BTW, if you aren't a subscriber, I highly, highly recommend it. 

<p>Actually I do have something to write. Instead of the usual "who I am" type first posts (that'll be in another post), I'd like to thank you, the Perl community. You've given me a great tool, great resources (i.e. <a href = "http://www.cpan.org/">CPAN</a>, <a href = "http://www.yapc.org/">YAPCs</a>, etc...) and a lot of fun programming. Most of my coding is in Perl and I can't tell you how many times it really has made the easy things easy and the hard things possible. So in no particular order, my thanks to...  </p>

<ul>
<li>Larry Wall. That's obvious. 
<li>All CPAN contributors. You've spoiled me. 
<li>The Perl Foundation volunteers. 
<li><a href = "http://use.perl.org/user/nicholas/journal/">Nicholas Clark</a> and p5p. (He's the pumpkin right? Sorry if I'm wrong about that) 
<li>Everyone working on Perl 6.
<li>brian d foy. Did I mention that you should get The Perl Review? 
<li>Josh McAdams. I've yet to miss an episode of Perlcast. Its great! 
<li><a href = "http://use.perl.org/user/merlyn/journal">Randal Schwartz</a>. I learned Perl from his books. 
</ul>

<p>I apologize because this list is far from complete. Its a little odd thanking people whom, for the most part, I haven't met before or perhaps only in passing at a YAPC::NA. But I've been wanting to say "Thanks" for sometime and don't know where/when I'll have a chance to do it in person.</p>

<p>Hopefully, it won't be another year before I put anything here. :-) </p>
