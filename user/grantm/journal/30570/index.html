<p><p>It's winter in Wellington.  We don't get snow here but it is currently cold and wet.  This may help explain the lower than usual attendance at last night's <a href="http://wellington.pm.org">Wellington.pm</a> meeting.  The fact that one of our two speakers had to cancel about 6 hours before the meeting may have put people off too.</p>

<p>I had recently considered that it would be a good idea to have a 'spare' presentation ready in case of a last minute cancellation.  Unfortunately, I hadn't progressed that past the "thinking about it" stage.  So I had to work fast to come up with something before the meeting started.  In the end, I did a quick (and fairly superficial) demo of Ruby on Rails and then did an <a href="http://wellington.pm.org/archive/200608/ruby_for_perlers/">Introduction to Ruby for Perl Programmers</a>.</p>

<p>Our other speaker <a href="http://coffee.geek.nz/">Brenda</a> (also a work colleague) talked about a Perl script her team is using to manage database schema changes in their projects (sorry, no slides).  When she brought the code up on screen, I was amused to see that the comment block at the beginning included this line:</p>

<pre>
# This script was in no way inspired by Grant McLean.
</pre>

<p>At least they won't be coming to me for support :-)</p>

<p>On a releated note, I suggested to another colleague that he might like to look into using XML::LibXML and XPath for his HTML scraping needs.  After I'd referred him to my <a href="http://wellington.pm.org/archive/200503/grant__html-parsing/">lightning talk slides</a> on the subject, he had a play around and came back with this quote:</p>

<blockquote><i>so LibXML is pretty damned fast then ...</i></blockquote>

<p>Apparently it was 20 times quicker than whatever he was using.</p></p>
