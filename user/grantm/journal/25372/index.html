<p><p>What a fun-filled weekend.  My article on Perl.com seemed to strike a bit
of a chord and I've been getting tons of positive feedback, both on the 
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=126289">mailing list</a> and 
in private mail.  With a project like this it can be hard to answer the most 
simple question - <i>"But what is it for?"</i>.  Apparently some people are
starting to catch on.</p>

<p>The article link seems to be doing the blog rounds and a fair few people
have <a
href="http://del.icio.us/url/850eca8b432f4da0b2952fb5978282d1">del.icio.us</a>'d
it.  It even made the '<a href="http://del.icio.us/popular/">popular</a>'
page.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, I haven't had any complaints about missing Win32 support.  Not
sure if that means Windows users don't care or that people have read the notes
on the installation page and are waiting patiently - the latter seems
unlikely.</p>

<p>Anyway, to bring me back down to earth, I had to clear a blocked drain on
Saturday.  Apparently it's been blocked for some time and once I stirred things
up the smell was overpowering.  Things seem to be flowing freely now.</p>

<p>I managed to push out a <a href="http://sprog.sourceforge.net/">new
release</a> of Sprog last night.  A couple of bug fixes and a few new
features.</p>

<p>Now it's time to return to earning a living :-)</p></p>
