<p><p>This weekend, Emily (age 6) and I went for a short walk in a local area of native bush (aka 'forest' in other English dialects).  Emily took charge of the camera and got a few interesting shots.  This one was so good it motivated me to create a flickr account and upload it: <a href="http://static.flickr.com/50/130689775_0ebd272b38_b.jpg">fungus</a></p>

<p>On the same walk, we also found a sheep's skull.  Emily was so interested in it she completely forgot to photograph it.  I also was intrigued.  It's not until you pick one up, turn it round and see how small the cavity is that houses the brain, that you realise exactly why sheep are so stupid.</p></p>

<p>Yes I loved the colours too.  Given how many decidedly 'average' photos I've taken I was very jealous of my six year old's first attempt.  I'm putting it down to beginner's luck<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>

<blockquote> <div><i>Do you have Photoshop? Try playing with the LAB colour enhancing techniques that I use.</i></div> </blockquote>

<p>Do they have a Linux version?  I use the GIMP for image editing and compositing tasks but I simply don't know what I'm doing when it comes to colour adjustments.  My version of the GIMP can allegedly decompose an image into L, a and b layers and after adjustment recompose them to RGB, but I haven't been able to make that do anything useful<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-(</p>
