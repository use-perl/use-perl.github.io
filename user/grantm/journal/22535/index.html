<p><p>Last month, I briefly mentioned my pet project which at that time was using the working title 'pstax'.  That name turned out to be taken by a commercial product, so after a bit of head scratching, I've settled on the new name 'Sprog'.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://sprog.sourceforge.net/">project web site</a> has an intro page to describe what it's all about and the code is available via CVS or as a tarball.</p>

<p>The code itself hasn't moved on much, while I've been sorting out the web site etc and I'm about to head away for a week in the sun, so don't expect any progress for a while.  One of the top priorities is to implement file save and file open.</p></p>

I was a bit puzzled by this entry at first - I just could'nt fathom why someone would make a Perl module named 'Language' (in danish).<p>
I took a while (must be because of the low awareness level just after new year) that I undetstood that 'Sprog' is something to do with chains and sprockets and not just "Language" as it means in danish<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p><p>
Back to the morning tea....</p>

<p>Yes, I gathered from a bit of googling that 'sprog' was Danish for 'language'.  I'd chosen the name as a contraction of 'sprocket' and 'cog' and decided that the Danish meaning had no negative connotations.  'Sprog' is also an informal word for child in english (at least in New Zealand and England - probably not in the US) and this project has been my 'brain child' for some time.  It remains to be seen whether I can foster it to maturity<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>

<p>Off to bed<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...</p>

<p>I am *so* glad there is no user 'sprocket' around here...<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>
