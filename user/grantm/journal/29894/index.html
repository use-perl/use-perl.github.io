<p><p>We had around 20 people at last night's meeting - which is a healthy number.  Any more and we'll need a bigger room.</p>

<p>Peter Love talked first about how he makes a living as a freelancer <a href="http://wellington.pm.org/archive/200606/making_a_living_using_perl/">using Perl</a>.  Then it was my turn to talk about <a href="http://wellington.pm.org/archive/200606/tdd/">Test-Driven Development with Perl</a>.  That took longer than I'd intended but there were lots of questions and feedback along the way which is usually a good sign.  I had fun using Gimp to decorate the slides - this was <a href="http://wellington.pm.org/archive/200606/tdd/slide03.html">my favourite</a>.</p>

<p>Next meeting will be on July 11th.</p></p>

I really liked the example you used for the slides.
<p>
Did you have people in the audience telling you about bugs in the code before you reached the slide where you discover them with another test?</p>

<p>Bugs!?! What bugs?</p>

<p>But seriously, yes, it was a very 'interactive' session.</p>

<p>I didn't actually go through all the slides.  When I got to the interactive demo bit, I started with a complete<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.t file but with'__END__' after each test - so only the first one ran (and failed).  Then I interactively typed in the code to make the test pass; removed the next '__END__' and repeated.  That worked pretty well for a start but I probably should have switched back to the slides after people began to get the idea.</p>

<p>I'd have to say though the final code ended up a lot more complicated than I'd expected.  If you have a cleaner solution I'd love to see it.</p>

One of the harder things I found in such presentations is that the bugs^H^H^H^Hfeatures I introduce are too obvious and some of the people in the audience start fixing them instead of watching the tools and technique we are using...
