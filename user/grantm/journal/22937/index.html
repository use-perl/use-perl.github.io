<p><p>The Association for Computing Machinery (acm.org) regularly send me paper spam trying to encourage me to join (I suspect they got my mailing details from Linux Journal).  I always just bin it, but I've finally gotten round to emailing <a href="mailto:acmhelp@acm.org?subject=Postal%20tolerance%20%3d%20zero">acmhelp@acm.org</a> asking them to stop.</p>

<p>Is anyone here actually a member?  If so, what benefit do you consider justifies the $84 annual membership fee?</p></p>

I was a member way back when, when the "Communications" was a reputable, useful semi-scholarly journal of record. I don't know if it's gotten back to being useful or not. I quit when my inbox of unread magazines got too deep some time in the late 80's or early 90's. I've maintained loose contact with the local <a href="http://www.gbcacm.org/" title="gbcacm.org">Greater Boston chapter</a gbcacm.org>, with whose local <a href="http://www.gbcacm.org/website/seminars.php" title="gbcacm.org">Professional Development Seminar</a gbcacm.org> committee I was once very active, and remains one of the best bargains.

<p>Their new <a href="http://www.acm.org/membership/professional/" title="acm.org">member benefits</a acm.org> have caused me to consider re-joining after a very long lapse.
</p><ul>
<li>permanent professional email address</li>
<li> <a href="http://pd.acm.org/" title="acm.org">online professional development courses</a acm.org> &amp; certifications "free" with membership (inclusive)</li>
<li> <a href="http://pd.acm.org/books/books.cfm" title="acm.org">free books</a acm.org> online for members</li>

</ul>

If I decide to do so, I guess I should post a follow-up <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/n1vux/journal" title="perl.org">here</a perl.org>

I had a quick scan of the 'free' books but most are pretty old and the Open Source technologies I work with were not well represented.  O'Reilly's Safari, while significantly more expensive, has a lot more titles that I'd actually use (not that I subscribe to that either).

I also was a member long ago - through the 70's and into the 80's.  Communications, in those days, had a series of articles by Jon Bentley which have since been published as 2 books "Programming Pearls" and "More Programming Pearls", which were excellent.<p>
I stopped when my collection of not yet read magazines (I joined a large number of SIGs too) could be piled up to the ceiling.</p>
