<p><p>Wellington Perl Mongers had their monthly meeting last night.  There was a pretty good turn out despite the cold weather outside.  It probably helps that the bulk of the attendees don't actually have to go outside to get from work to the venue :-)</p>

<p>Andy gave us a talk on his foray into <a href="http://wellington.pm.org/archive/200804/learning_from_perl_golf/">Perl Golf</a>.  While he had fun and (re)learnt a few things along the way, he concluded not much of it was relevant to writing maintainable code for $work. It's hard to argue with that conclusion.</p>

<p>I was up next with a talk on the <a href="http://wellington.pm.org/archive/200804/exact_cover/">exact cover</a> algorithm.  This was inspired by an article Eric Maki wrote for the Perl Review a while back.  Eric was using it to solve/generate Sudoku while I was using it to solve a different puzzle.</p>

<p>Last but not least, Finlay gave us a brief intro to <a href="http://wellington.pm.org/archive/200804/prd_postal_addresses/">Parse::RecDescent</a> and a particular application of it for parsing postal addresses from $previous_job.  I've never actually used PRD in any non-trivial way so this was a good refresher.</p>

<p>Our next meeting will be May 13th, so if you're going to be visiting Wellington next month let me know :-)</p></p>
