<p><p>Our daughter turned four this weekend so our house was party central.  Here are two games that were very popular:</p>

<p><b>Birds Nest Game</b> (outdoor)</p>

<p>Props: 3 hoops (or chalk circles) for 'nests', 5 soft balls (juggling balls/bean bags) for 'eggs', prizes.</p>

<p>Play: One player stands in each nest.  The 5 eggs are placed centrally.  When you say "Go!", the players all race to bring eggs back to their nest.  They may only carry <b>one egg at a time</b>.  When the central supply is exhausted they may 'steal' eggs from other nests (still only one at a time).  First player to collect three eggs in their nest wins a prize.</p>

<p><b>Ballon Rush</b> (indoor)</p>

<p>Props: about 20 inflated ballons, loud music (we used Queen, 'We Will Rock You').</p>

<p>Play: Two teams of 1-3 players each.  Divide the room in half - you could use string or tape to make a line along the floor, we rearranged the furniture into one line :-).  Place the balloons along the line and start the music.  The aim is to push all the ballons into your opponents half.  When the music stops after say 1 minute, the team with the least ballons on their side wins.  To make things interesting you could introduce a 'no hands' rule.</p></p>
