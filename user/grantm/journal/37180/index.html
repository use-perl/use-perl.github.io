<p><p>We had the August meeting of Wellington.pm this week.  <a href="/user/mugwumpjism/">Sam</a> gave us his talk on the work he did converting the Perl source code history to git.  It turned out to be a rather larger undertaking than he originally imagined.  Sam was preparing this talk for YAPC::Eu but unfortunately the costs of getting there have proved prohibitive so he may just have to recast the talk as a chapter in his memoirs.</p>

<p>Next up, <a href="http://www.coffee.geek.nz/">Brenda</a> gave us a quick rundown on opportunities for networking with (open source) geeks in Wellington.  In a novel twist, her presentation slides were a flickr photo set.</p>

<p>After Brenda's talk we had a lively discussion on strategies for dealing with an inherited codebase; code formatting styles; Perl best practices; the evils of misused subroutine prototypes; and interesting home grown config file formats.</p>

<p>To round off the evening, I gave a 'behind the scenes' talk on last month's <a href="http://wellington.pm.org/articles/hackoff2008/">HackOff</a> competition.  The focus for people on the night (and after the event) has been on <i>decoding</i> the datafiles for each of the problems.  The focus of the talk was on how I went about <i>encoding</i> the data to produce the question files.  There is strong interest in doing it again next year which means more work for me - but at least I had fun.</p></p>
