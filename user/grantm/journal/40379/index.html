<p><p>My big news today is that Version 3.0 of bcvi is now available on CPAN.
If you have no idea what bcvi is then you'll be pleased to know I've written
<a href="http://sshmenu.sourceforge.net/articles/bcvi/">this article</a> to answer all
your questions - it even has pictures!</p>

<p>Way back in 2007 I knocked up a proof-of-concept implementation of a somewhat
crazy idea. I used it for a while and found it useful so I
<a href="http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=611462">shared it on PerlMonks</a> to
see if other people found it useful too. That was version 1.0.</p>

<p>Over time I fleshed out the core to make something more robust, more secure and
more useful. But I never released it publically because it always seemed like
the sort of tool that would be most useful to a person who hacked it into a
form that suited them. I really had no idea how to release and maintain a tool
that was meant to be hacked. So I kept it to myself and continued to find it
useful. That was version 2.0.</p>

<p>Eventually I realised that what I needed was a solid core of infrastructure
code and a plugin API that would allow people to hack the core without editing
the script itself. Quite why it took me so long to realise this, I couldn't
say. After all it's exactly what I did with <a href="http://sshmenu.sourceforge.net/">SSHMenu</a> and that has worked out very well.</p>

<p>The problem was that I didn't have a solid core of infrastructure code. What
I had was a proof-of-concept script that had some of the rough edges knocked
off and some new shiny bits bolted on. So earlier this year I set about
rewriting bcvi in a more extensible way. Then to prove the new plugin API,
I wrote a few simple plugins. Now it seems to be in a stable enough form for
me to call it version 3.0.</p>

<p>And so <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/App-BCVI/">it's released</a>. There's even some
documentation for the plugin API. It'll be interesting to what, if anything,
people make of it.</p>

<h2>Sounds great!</h2>

<p>Thanks for writing about bcvi. I'll give it a shot and it really sounds like something that'll be a great replacement for a whole bunch of crappy scripts I have accumulated over the years.</p><p>--Steffen</p>
