<div class="span8">
<p><p>I have a replication process which applies updates.  Usually the updates are incremental 'patches' sometimes they are full copies.  The incoming queue of updates might look like this:</p>

<pre>
my @files = qw(
    00000.diff
    00001.diff
    00002.diff
    00003.copy
    00004.diff
    00005.diff
    00006.copy
    00007.diff
);
</pre>

<p>If there are one or more full copies in the queue, there is no point processing any updates before the last full copy.  So what I needed was an algorithm to reduce the above example to just the last two files.</p>

<p>My first thought was that I ought to be able to do it with some form of grep using the flip-flop operator.  Alas, my initial attempts were not successful so I wrote a loop that popped things off one array and unshifted them onto another - breaking out of the loop if a full copy file was found.  It wasn't complicated code but it took more lines than I'd have liked and it needed a one-line comment explaining what the loop was doing (perhaps, in retrospect, I should have put it into a subroutine).</p>

<p>I later realised what I was doing wrong in my first attempts and came up with this version:</p>

<pre>
my $i = 0;
@files = reverse grep !$i++../\.copy$/, reverse @files;
</pre>

<p>Having to use $i was annoying but I couldn't think of another way to code an expression that was true the first time it was evaluated and false from then on.</p>

<p>Anyway, I ran this version past a couple of my colleagues and while they were intrigued, they felt it was basically unreadable and didn't want to be saddled with maintaining it.  So I 'committed' it here instead :-)</p></p>

<h2>My shot</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/bart/">bart</a> on 2006-03-20T14:10:57</h3>
The only assumption I make is that the files in the list are in sequential order.<blockquote> <div><tt>my @keep;<br>foreach (@files) {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; @keep = () if<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/\.copy$/;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; push @keep, $_;<br>}</tt></div> </blockquote>

Of all the suggestions, this one definitely gets my vote for clarity.  I did think along the lines of discarding accumulated filenames whenever a '.copy' was encountered but at the time I had grep blinkers on and it can't be done with grep.

Perhaps try the <tt>List::MoreUtils</tt> module?<blockquote> <div><tt>use List::MoreUtils qw/before_incl/;<br>my @keep =<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;reverse<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;before_incl {<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/\.copy\z/ }<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;reverse @files;</tt></div> </blockquote>

<h2>There's no fold in List::Util or List::MoreUtils</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/mary.poppins/">mary.poppins</a> on 2006-03-28T06:25:51</h3>
There's a "reduce" in List::Util, but its interface is fairly horribly broken.<br><br>Anyway, here's a fold-using implementation:<br><br><code><br>use strict;<br><br>sub fold {<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; my $accum = shift;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; my $code = shift;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; return $accum unless @_;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; return fold( $code-&gt;( $accum, shift ), $code, @_ );<br>}<br><br>my @files = qw(<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 00000.diff<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 00001.diff<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 00002.diff<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 00003.copy<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 00004.diff<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 00005.diff<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 00006.copy<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 00007.diff<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 00008.diff<br>);<br><br>use Data::Dumper;<br>sub foldee {<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; my ( $accum, $item ) = @_;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; return [$item, []] if ( $item =~<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/\.copy$/ );<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; return $accum unless defined $accum-&gt;[ 0 ];<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; return [ $accum-&gt;[ 0 ], [@{$accum-&gt;[1]}, $item]];<br>}<br>print Dumper(fold( [undef, []], \&amp;foldee, @files));<br></code>
