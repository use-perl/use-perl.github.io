<p><p>I got home yesterday from a week in <a href="http://www.osdc.com.au/">Melbourne</a>.  Overall, I'd say "Well done!" to the organisers.  It was informative and it was fun - what more could I ask for.</p>

<p>Damian's keynotes were great and his lightning talks were in a class of their own - thank goodness I was immediately before him rather than immediately after :-)  Two of his three lightning talks involved him singing Gilbert and Sullivan tunes.  The first was unaccompanied, but for the second he was backed by a cheesy MIDI track which I understand made its way to Melbourne via <a href="/user/TorgoX/journal/">Alaska</a> where a <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/MIDI-Perl/">perl script</a> was used to adjust the tempo to something Damian could manage.</p>

<p>Of course there were tons of other speakers.  Anthony Baxter from the Python world was a revelation.  <a href="/user/pjf/journal/">Paul Fenwick's</a> Perl talks were thorough and well presented.  Becky Alcorn's talks on using JavaScript by writing Perl were also intriguing (and well delivered).  There were plenty others I enjoyed too, but unfortunately, I missed Scott Penrose on controlling hardware from Perl - it looked fun.<p>

<p>If you missed my lightning talk or want to try out the code I was talking about, I've put up (annotated) slides, code download and even a movie <a href="http://homepages.paradise.net.nz/gmclean1/pstax/">here</a>.</p>

<p>I'm looking forward to OSDC2005 and hoping to see a few more New Zealanders there.</p></p>
