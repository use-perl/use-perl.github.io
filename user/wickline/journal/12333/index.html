Hmmm....<br/><br/>How about a poll: How many editions of Perl 6 Essentials will be released before Perl 6.0?<br/><br/>a) zero: O'Reilly isn't really releasing this edition yet
b) just this one
c) N (because constants other than zero and one are icky)<br/><br/>-matt</p>

<h2>I've seen it!</h2>

It's nicely done.  I actually learned a few things about Perl6 from this book, although the detailed description of the Parrot assembler was great as bedside material to put me to sleep. {grin}



<h2>Apocalypses Now?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/yudel/">yudel</a> on 2003-05-20T23:41:32</h3>
How does the book handle the fact that only a fraction of the language spec is out yet?

<p>It's only a fraction of the size of the Camel, for one.  For another, about half of the book is devoted to Parrot, which <em>is</em> out.  (Not complete, but much closer than Perl 6.)</p>

<h2>Huh</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/pudge/">pudge</a> on 2003-05-21T00:25:55</h3>
How will people who have submitted book proposals that were rejected because the language or program to be documented isn't widely used, deal with this?  Seems pretty silly to me.

Perl 6 already has a target audience. I confess that I haven't yet been convinced to care about Parrot -- but I would prefer to read it as a book than online.

Publishing is about selling books.  Selling books is about meeting demand.  O'Reilly can't make a demand for books.  Allison's proposal came in just as Linda (the Perl editor at O'Reilly) figured there was a demand for a "keep yourself up to date" Perl 6 book.  If we reject books because the language or program isn't widely used (and we do--I've said "no" at least six times this week), it's because we don't think there's sufficient curiousity from people who <i>don't</i> use it to support a book.<p>

Still bitter about "System 9, Libertarianism, and the Boston Red Sox: the Eternal Tangled Braid" being politely declined?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p><p>
