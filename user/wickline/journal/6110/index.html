<p>(and so is this journal thing, or maybe it's just 'cause I'm a wee
bit punchy from lack of sleep... we'll find out in future days)<br/><br/>Highlights (Letterman style)<br/><br/>    #10 the weather could have been substantially worse (really!)
     #9 being paid to have nothing but fun for three days
     #8 finding little ways to pitch in with assistance
     #7 seeing more women (I think) than at YAPC::NA 2001
     #6 laughing my ass off (especially allison's & gnat's l.Talks)
     #5 being local so I didn't have to miss Laura for a week
     #4 seeing some interesting ideas in code (YAML, abigail's OO)
     #3 seeing the perl community *qua* community
     #2 catching up with folks from far places
     #1 meeting neat new people (Riley would have to be the most new) 
     #0 great company every day and evening, Wed though Sat!<br/><br/>Lolights<br/><br/>    #4 gnat's 'something something' eleventh-hour slot-filler
       turned out to be something else at the last minute. I
       have yet to see him speak, and was looking forward to
       whatever 'something something' might have been. Next time.
       Silver lining: even though I still didn't get to see him
       speak for his l.Talk, the movie was fucking hillarious.<br/><br/>    #3 MJD wasn't quite his usual animated and focused self
       when giving his red flags talk on Friday morning.
       Silver lining: in reading the slides (half of the YAPC
       proceedings!) I found a flag I need to watch myself.
       I can think of a few scripts where I do the icky
           if (...) {
               if (...) {
                   if (...) {
                       # ...
                   } else { ... } # tertiary error
               } else { ... }    # secondary error
           } else { ... }       # my initial error
       insted of using breaks or carting it all off into a
       sub where I can use 'condition or return' statements.<br/><br/>    #2 I'd hoped for more perl code in T::S::C
       but it's all hidden to avoid spoiling the effect.
       Silver lining: maybe I'll start playing with source
       filtering to figure it out myself.<br/><br/>    #1 I could only be in one room at a time. Silver lining:
       I'm looking forward to seeing more recorded sessions
       show up on the web as folks get settled in and have
       time to process their recordings.<br/><br/>Of course not every cloud has a silver lining...<br/><br/>    #0 YAPC was over far too quickly :(<br/><br/>Biggest Bummer of them all:
    I think I might have to miss YAPC next year. We'll be
    moving to Portland, OR around YAPC season, and so not
    only will the budget be leaner, but time will be more
    precious (and likely spent job-hunting). Sigh...<br/><br/>-matt</p>
