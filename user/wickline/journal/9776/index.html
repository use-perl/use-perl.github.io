<p>in response to an article in <a href="http://use.perl.org/article.pl?sid=03/01/05/002202&mode=flat&tid=1">The Perl Review</a>...<br/><br/>
I also got interested in Jotto a while back. A friend had showed me how to play and I wanted to show another friend, but I found it frustrating discussing strategies when I knew the word I wanted them to guess. So, I wrote a script to play against.<br/><br/><pre>
    <a href="http://wickline.org/j/">http://wickline.org/j/</a>
    Interface rather undocumented
</pre><br/><br/>The script allows you to track most of the things you normally want to track on paper when playing without a computer. If you want to play in a masochistic fashion, you can ignore all those interface elements.<br/><br/>
Here's my jott-counting code if you're interested<br/><br/><pre>
    sub get_jotts {
        my($probe, $target) = @_;
        my %letters;
        for ( split('',$target) )
            { $letters{$_}++ };
        my $jotts = 0;
        for ( split('',$probe)  )
            {$jotts++ if $letters{$_}-- > 0};
        return $jotts;
    }
</pre><br/><br/>Someone on a FWP list pointed out that you can optimize by generating a sub specific to the target word that in contexts where the sub will be called repeatedly with a single target word.<br/><br/>I've got a mammoth live-letter words list at<br/><br/><pre>
    <a href="http://wickline.org/fivers.tar.gz">http://wickline.org/fivers.tar.gz</a>
</pre><br/><br/>I use a subset of that for my jotto game<br/><br/><pre>
    <a href="http://wickline.org/j/index.cgi?show=dict">http://wickline.org/j/index.cgi?show=dict</a>
</pre><br/><br/>I heard of the "killer" strategy for winning Jotto on the FWP list, and found it too boring to play against, so didn't bother with a head-to-head play version. The basic notion is that every guess must be a possible win. Every time the computer guesses, it must make a guess that could be the target word in light of the scores of previous guesses.<br/><br/><pre>
    select a number N between 1..5
    Sort dictionary, first by rough order of word commonality
                     then by the Nth letter
                     This will ensure that guesses use more
                     common words before obscure ones, and
                     that guesses aren't always alphabetically
                     early... makes play a pinch more "real"
  PROBE:
    for each probe in dictionary
        next PROBE if we've already guessed this probe
        for each term in our history of guesses
            next PROBE unless score given to term was
                the same as it would get if probe were target
        if we get here, probe fits all term's scores
            so return probe as our next guess
    if we get here, no probe worked
            so we don't know the word (or user mis-scored us)
</pre><br/><br/>In practice, the above method gives very little chance for a human to win, and so I didn't find it very fun to play against.<br/><br/>Happy jotting. <tt>:)</tt><br/><br/>-matt

I tried contacting the author of the article by email, but my email bounced with (likely truncated) diagnostic code:<br> <br>

In response to your mail, no the Jotto module isn't available anywhere, yet, but I'd be happy to send it to you if you'd like. Your scoring algorithm seems much cleaner than mine, but I'd be interested to see what the speed differences are.
<br>
<br>
The code in my Jotto.pm hasn't been touched in a while. I've been thinking about doing a complete rewrite of the Jotto stuff, now that I have a little bit more of a clue about what I'm doing.
