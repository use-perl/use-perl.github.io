<div class="span8">
<p>Every several months or so, I type my name in a couple of variations
into google.<br/><br/>Why? Well, the first time I did it was after my natural father had found
me via the internet. I wanted to see just how easy it was to find me. I
wasn't trying to be hidden, or to be visible... I was just curious. So,
I typed in a handful of variations of my name in a few search engines.
This was in the pre-google days, and the altavista advanced search was
my favored search engine (back when altavista wasn't just another web
portal).<br/><br/>Every several months it occurs to me to repeat the excersize. I don't
really have any good reason for it. I'm not looking to see if I've been
keeping a low enough profile to be unobserved and I'm not looking to see
if I'm famous. I'm just wasting time basically. People do that at times,
ya know? I don't try all the search engines anymore, just google. ...but
I still try a few variations of my name. I've found that there are a few
folks with my first and last name who are somewhat famous. I'm not one
of them. There are also a few less famous folks with my name. I've had
email from three strangers asking if I was their long lost relative or
high school classmate. I'm not.<br/><br/>Today I googled for 'wickline'. It's my last name, and I'd expected to
see oodles of strangers and an occasional relative. I did *not* expect
to see something of mine in the #3 spot! ...but that's what I found!<br/><br/>As I type this,
    http://google.com/search?q=wickline
has as the third hit
    http://wickline.org/yapc/maps.html<br/><br/>Given the way google's page-rank system works, I'm interpreting that
result to indicate that this year's YAPC was more important than just
about anything wickline-related. YAPC beats out every wickline in the
world but two!<br/><br/>Bravo! Way to go YAPC! :)<br/><br/>On google images, there's a couple of nude women. I think you can
search for just about anything and find porn.<br/><br/>On google groups, strangers and relatives.<br/><br/>On google directory we find that use.perl.org is more important than
any wickline entry in dmoz.org (source data for google directory). My
name just happened to be on use.perl.org (because of that yapc post)
on the day it was last indexed by google, so as I type this, the u.p.o
page comes up on a search for wickline... and because u.p.o is better
ranked than any wickline-related page, it comes up first.<br/><br/>And if wasting time at google wasn't enough, I'm now wasting time here
talking about my waste of time.<br/><br/>What a waste of time. :) I think I need to get some sleep...<br/><br/>-matt
    </p>

In that case, please move out of the 80's, and into "real" text.  I like to be able to adjust the width of my screen to a comfortable wrap. Your text doesn't flow into that wrap.  And there are no constant-space fonts that look anywhere <i>near</i> as good as the rest of the text.
<p>
I'm actually pretty surprised at your response.  I did figure you as some a-hole that says "damn you for even trying to listen to me, but I'll be continuing to speak in a manner of my choosing".  Yes, I've known jerks like that.
</p><p>
If your intent is to communicate, then listen to the feedback you're getting, and adjust accordingly.  If your intent is merely to speak in the manner of your choosing, eventually no-one will be around to listen. {grin}</p>

It's not about "tweaking browser prefs" to get a readable font, it's about using the right font for the right purpose.

The "insertion" of the semicolons is not related directly to ECODE, but was a by-product of another bug (actually, it was incorrectly splitting on "&amp;nbsp;" so it became "&amp;nbsp<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;").  The post modes, including ECODE, are documented to some degree <a href="http://slashdot.org/faq/com-mod.shtml#cm2300" title="slashdot.org">in the Slashdot FAQ</a slashdot.org>.
