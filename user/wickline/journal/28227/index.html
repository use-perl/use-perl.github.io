<p>I've been a very inconstant journal writer here. I <em>think</em> that may be about to change. Our first daughter was born 4:21 in the afternoon of the last day of last year. I've been absolutely horrible about keeping up with my email. Now that Ellie is here, I'm sure I'll only get worse.<br/><br/>I'm going to start filling this space with the sort of baby tales I'd be copy/pasting into several emails if I were still on top of my inbox. When I advertise this journal to folks, they'll be able to tune in and comment at will.<br/><br/>I'm also going to be talking to myself. There's tons of stuff I'd like to remember the next time around, and sleep deprivation is murder on memory formation. Who knows... maybe someone else will find some handy nugget of info/experience/opinion in this stuff.<br/><br/>I am not going to worry much about typos and such. As I "type" this, it's 2:30am, I'm sitting in the dark living room in which my visiting mother in law is asleep. I'm in our nursing chair with an automan next to me on the left. Ellie in propped up on that automan in her boppy (ask google). My left hand is keeping her sleeping peacefully. My laptop is on my left knee, and one of our cats (Puck) is on my right knee. I'm hunting and pecking keystrokes with my right hand. In this sort of situation, I don't think that it's worth the time to worry about typos!<br/><br/>Anyhow, the content of this journal is likely to be strictly personal (or at least primarily so) from here on out. Please stay tuned if you want to read about Ellie. If you're looking for some text about symbol table slip-ups, or job postings, please avert your gaze.<br/><br/>OK, we are looking to fill five more new positions. Send me your resume so I can get the refferal bonus to help feed Ellie! What I've written about these positions in the past still applies, except that we're using svn more than cvs these days.
