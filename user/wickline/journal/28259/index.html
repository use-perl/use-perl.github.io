<p>The inital upload of <a href="http://media.wickline.org/2005_01_05_Ellies_First_Five_Days">Ellie's first five days</a> will be available for a little while longer. Snag any photos from there that you want. I'm currently uploading two new iPhoto exports and plan to maintain just two exports from now on.<br/><br/>One export will contain all photos with family and friends. I won't attempt to filter that feed, other than to remove photos after they're a few months old. That way you can download any photos with you that you want. The other export will be a montage of everything as of the upload date, but will be filtered to contain only a subset of the recent photos and a gradually diminishing quantity of the older photos. The half-life for older photos will depend primarily on how often I get around to updating these exports.<br/><br/>In both cases, the thumbnails are small but the actually images are very, very large. This is so that they'll print nicer. You may not want to click on the thumbnails if you're behind a slow connection.<br/><br/>Here's the two exports, last updated 2006 Jan 26: <a href="http://media.wickline.org/ellie/and_you/">You and Ellie</a> and also <a href="http://media.wickline.org/2006_01_26__Ellie_Montage/">Ellie's First 25 Days</a>.<br/><br/>UPDATE: <a href="http://media.wickline.org/ellie/montage">new montage 2006_07_09</a><br/><br/>Oh, and a new development... Some of the photos look like they'd make decent desktop images. On the mac, I prefer dark backgrounds on the right side of the screen, so that my icons have a stronger contrast with the desktop. On the pc, I prefer dark backgrounds on the left hand side for the same reason. I'm going to start collecting photos that look like good desktop images, and mirror them as needed to have them work on either platform. If you would like an Ellie desktop image on your PC, <a href="http://media.wickline.org/ellie/desktop/pc/">use these images</a>. If you would like an Ellie deskop image on your mac, <a href="http://media.wickline.org/ellie/desktop/mac/">use these ones</a>. If you want on one linux, then pick whichever fits the way you arrange your desktop.<br/><br/>The hospital has a service which took <a href="http://www.growingfamily.com/webnursery/babypage_view.asp?URLID=6N7V8E2L1N">a few photos of Ellie</a> too. The sweater, blanket, and hat were all hand-made by Laura. So was the baby <tt>;)</tt> You can save these links if you just want jpgs: (<a href="http://www.growingfamily.com/images/customers/5585/2006/01/6N7V8E2L1N_1lg.jpg">1</a>  <a href="http://www.growingfamily.com/images/customers/5585/2006/01/6N7V8E2L1N_2lg.jpg">2</a> <a href="http://www.growingfamily.com/images/customers/5585/2006/01/6N7V8E2L1N_3lg.jpg">3</a> <a href="http://www.growingfamily.com/images/customers/5585/2006/01/6N7V8E2L1N_4lg.jpg">4</a> ). They'll let you order prints of those photos to be mailed to you, if you'd like.<br/><br/>(<a href="http://ellie-info.wickline.org/">more Ellie info</a>)</p>
