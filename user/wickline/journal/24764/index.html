<p>OK, I'm not Ovid, but Curtis did keep the perl public at large apraised of Rentrak job opportunities while he was working here. Now that he's gone and we happen to have some openings, I figure I'll post the banners this time.<br/><br/>Curtis has some very honest comments scattered in his journalling if you wanted to research before jumping.<br/><br/>    <a href="http://use.perl.org/journal.pl?op=list&uid=2709">http://use.perl.org/journal.pl?op=list&uid=2709</a><br/><br/>I started working at Rentrak a couple of weeks before Curtis. He and I worked together for somewhere around a month before he moved over to a different area on the same floor. The positions I'm plugging are not in the same area he worked in for the majority of his stay with Rentrak. We're the "research and development" group. We get to create new systems and then when they start making tons of money we fork off a support staff to maintain them.<br/><br/>I'd say that our area practices pair programming much more consistently (and without any issues of folks falling asleep ;). We're more gung-ho about refactoring since we have multiple systems to develop and we don't want to repeat ourselves.<br/><br/>If you like test-driven development, pair programming, fun people, 40 hour work weeks, your choice of platform/editor for developing (although we have tons of cool tools hooked up for vim or emacs users), then send me your resume.<br/><br/>    m-s-w-rtk-resumes-2005 [at] wickline [dot] org<br/><br/>and I'll ensure that it gets in the right hands.<br/><br/>We've been continuing to grow since before I was hired about two years ago. These are new positions as we're about to fork off half of our RnD group to support a maturing product.<br/><br/>-matt</p>
