About a month ago I was looking for a good article which summarises the differences between the various Perl MVCs.  I asked a few people who'd know about such things better than I, and they told me with certainty that it doesn't exist.  I asked Google, and it didn't seem to know either.
</p>
<p>
So anyway, since I figured I had to find out this information anyway; I decided I'd learn both of them and put together a conference paper and talk on the topic as well.  Still I have my concerns about being able to to learn both of them well enough to do them justice before September 15th.  So I'm asking the experts as well...
</p>
<p>
If you are a regular user of either of these systems; have experience with both; or would just like to air your opinion regardless; please feel free to comment!  If you want to comment about CGI::App, Maypole, Gantry or any of the other similar options as well your opinions are also welcome.
</p>
<p>
Thanks.

There's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_web_application_frameworks" title="wikipedia.org">a comparison over at the wikipedia</a wikipedia.org>.

I looked at the link you provided, because I have been interested in an objective comparison of the two.  Unfortunately, the only thing it has to say about Jifty is that it is written in perl.
