This is inspired by <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/brian_d_foy/journal/32556">brian d foy's post</a> on "What do you hate most about your language?".  Of course I love Perl.  I program in it and teach it for a living.  Still I hate....
</p>
<ol>
<li><b>eval</b>.  Block eval should be spelled "try" and should have a "catch" instead of an ugly unreadable if statement following.  Block eval should not be called the same thing as string eval - which is very, very different.
</li>
<li><b>symbolic references</b>.  You should have to *turn on* this functionality if you want it, rather than having it on by default.  Trying to convince self-taught programmers who refuse to use strict because it breaks their code and don't want to know that hashes are a better solution, is a challenge in self-control every time.  In fact, although I hardly ever use strict in my command-line one-liners or my temporary stuff; it shits me that strict isn't on by default.
</li>
<li><b>bad legacy stuff</b>.  In particular things like "reset", which makes some sense in the context of lazy programming, but which just screams out to be abused in "job secure" code.
</li>
<li>
<b>inconsistent whitespace rules</b>.  <pre>print $foo->{blah};  print $foo -> {blah};  print "$foo -> {blah}";</pre>  I get why the last one fails, but why allow the second one to succeed if you can't be consistent?
</li>
<li>
<li>
<b>no way to take a slice through arrow-notation</b>.  If it wasn't for this, we could teach our students arrow notation exclusively and they'd never need to know about the uglier form of dereferencing.
</li>
