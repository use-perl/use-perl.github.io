I believe that I'm a pretty smart person.  I can certainly follow links and perform searches.  But I still can't figure out the meta moderation system on this site.
</p>
<p>
Every now and then I log in and get a message <i>Have you meta-moderated recently?</i>  I think "Nope, not ever" and follow the link.  I get a boring page.
</p>
<p>
This page is so boring I can write all of the relevant text here:
</p>
<blockquote><i>
<b>Meta Moderation</b>
<br><br>	
No comments available for meta moderation!
</i></blockquote>
<p>
What a shame, I was <b>hoping</b> to find some information on what I had to do to meta-moderate!
</p>
<p>
Today I posted a comment and got the following message:
</p>
<blockquote><i>
For use Perl's moderation system to function properly, we need as many users as possible to
<a  href="//use.perl.org/metamod.pl">Meta-Moderate</a>.
You are currently eligible... why not hop over and help?
</i></blockquote>
<p>
Yay!  Thought I, and hopped over to help.  Only to find, again, the content I provided above.
</p>
<p>
Am I supposed to keep reloading that page just in case something which hasn't been meta-moderated appears?  Sure, the quotes are amusing, but I've got better things to do with my day.
</p>
<p>
Am I missing something important?  This is certainly a case where some more documentation could help.  I'll even write it if someone tells me how it all works.  I've searched use Perl for information on meta-moderation and got nothing (of use).  Perhaps my user object is broken.

Replying to one of pudge's posts would likely get the quickest response, but I didn't bother since I am mostly a lurker.<br> <br>I vaguely remember something about the number of accounts that come after you has to reach a certain number before there something or other.  IOW - I have no idea and just gave up on it.

I don't think it's the number of accounts after you in this case -- at least, I'm #357 and I see the same message whenever I click the meta-mod link.<p>

The code that runs this site is the same code that is used for slashdot.  (Well, sometimes it's at a different version level - pudge is one of the developers of slashcode and I seem to recall him running new releases here before they got used for the slashdot site.)<br> <br>Moderation allows you to rate the discussion on news articles.  However, this site only gets a few news articles per month and there are few discussion comments posted to them - having more than 5 comments is rare, 0 is more common; in contrast, slashdot usually gets hundreds and sometimes over a thousand comments on a signle article, and they post on the order of 20 or 30 articles per day.<br> <br>Moderation is not applied to journal comments (such as the one I am writing here), which is where the bulk of the posting occurs on this site.<br> <br>Moderation is invited from users who: (1) are long time participants - not one of the most recent 10% registrants (I think the number os 10%, but I may be wrong); (2) has no also written comments to the same article; (3) has not been downgraded by enough bad feedback from the meta-moderation process.<br> <br>When there are no recent article comments, no moderation can be done, and no moderator cookies are handed out.<br> <br>Meta-moderation is a feedback mechanism to provide a check on moderation (just as moderation provides a check on commentary).  All users can offer to meta-moderate.  They are shown a number of recent moderation actions and asked to judge whether the moderation was fairly done or inappropriate.  Each moderation can be meta-moderated a few times.<br> <br>When all recent moderation has been meta-moderated a few times, there is nothing available to be meta-moderated.<br> <br>The whole moderation/meta-moderation process is designed for a high volume site with a number of people who misuse the site in their postings or their use of the moderation process.  In that venue, it provides a huge benefit.  On this site, it is essentially wasted.
