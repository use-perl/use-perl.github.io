To join ranks with at least 15 other Australians, whose names have been splashed across the papers in the last year or so, is another woman: <i>Barbara Kathleen Higgs</i>.  Higgs has been arrested with a small amount of marijuana at the resort beach of Sengiggi, Indonesia.  She faces a possible 10 year sentence.
</p>
<p>
Now Higgs' case is different than most of the ones we've been hearing about recently - who are mostly travellers and holiday-makers.  It would appear that Higgs part-owns a hotel in the area.  Thus regardless of whether the drugs were for personal use or otherwise, Higgs has even less excuse not to know the local laws.
</p>
<p>
What amazes me is the wide-eyed innocence that Australians seem to be showing regarding taking drugs through the Asian countries which declare and promote the <i>death penalty</i> for offenses relating to drugs.  The Australian government gives out a little booklet with every passport which has big warnings about taking/dealing/buying/using drugs overseas.  It states that some of these countries do use the death penalty and where to find out more information.  It warns you to get a note from your doctor for any prescribed medication you may need to take with you.
</p>
<p>
Despite the Australian government occasionally asking for clemency (ie not the death penalty), it has been made quite clear that they don't intend to bail offenders out of trouble with these other governments.  Frankly I don't blame them.  Asking for special consideration for Australian citizens may mean offering special consideration for their citizens.  And if the country should actually agree, then that country risks Australians drug running in force, understanding that the harsh laws to prevent it don't apply to them.
</p>
<p>
The message should be pretty clear by now.  Stay away from drugs while visiting Indonesia, Singapore and all other countries with the death penalty for trafficing.  It's probably safe to grow a small patch of hash in Australia, and share it with your friends.  You might be fined for it, you could have a minor sentence, but you won't face the death penalty.  It's probably okay to buy a couple of tablets of XTC or whatever does it for you at a nightclub in Australia, although don't get left with the whole bag if the cops raid the place.  These things are not necessarily okay everywhere else!
</p>
<p>
Yet it's probably not ignorance.  It's probably the belief that "it won't happen to me, I won't get caught".  Even so, a smart person ought to be doing all they can to "play it safe" right now.  Have a look at what's happened to the ones who were unlucky enough to get caught and remember that not all countries treat prisoners as well as Australia does.

<h2>Even a note isn't enough</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Alias/">Alias</a> on 2006-02-22T07:22:32</h3>
Forget just having a note from your doctor, if your medication is in any way a controlled substance (for example, Ritalin and all similar ADHD drugs are controlled narcotics) as well as your doctors note, you chould ALSO front up to the outbound customs desk at the airport and get customs to rubber stamp (literally) that they have checked you are carrying only what you are supposed to, and ONLY an amount that matches what you should need for your prescription (plus a certain percentage).<br><br>So forget about just taking the bottle, you need to only take what you need.<br><br>And of course you have to declare you are carrying a "controlled medication" when you get to customs at the other end. Failure to declare is illegal in most places. You'll be fine, they'll just check your paperwork and rubberstamp it.<br><br>And THEN in some countries in Asia (yes, I'm looking at you Singapore) you need all that, PLUS you have to apply in writing to the Department of Science at least a month before you travel to carry the medication, with paperwork, and they call up the State Controlled Substances register and check you are legal.<br><br>And then they will fax you a permission form to carry the medication while in the country, which you are required to carry on your person at all times while in possession of the medication.<br><br>So make damned sure you go read the embassy websites before you go places. The rules might be stronger and harsher than you think.<br>



<h2>Stay away from Draconian countries</h2>
