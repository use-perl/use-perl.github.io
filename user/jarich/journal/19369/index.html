<p>Years and years ago (1996) back when I was at university pjf introduced me to a LPMud called 3k.  It was pretty huge mud back then and it's still going very strong today.  (http://www.3k.org)
<p>
When I got to the end of my university degree my time available to mud dropped through the floor and I started to only come on monthly or even every two months to say hello, check my mail, flap and bit and idle out.
<p>
This started just before the guild I was in (Bards) got it's latest recode (end of 2000).  I played around with the new guild a bit but didn't have the time to learn to play it propery.  It was vastly different from the other incarnations I'd lived through and had too much to remember.
<p>
I got 73% of the way through to my next guild level and then went back to flapping every month or so.  I this time Paul and I were introducted to EverCrack and so we had even less incentive to play on 3k.
<p>
Well... time passed and the guild "adjusted" and in one of its adjustments all of our guild skills were reset to zero so we could correct them appropriately.  I left them at zero because I didn't have the time to work out what were good choices.
<p>
Two nights ago (Thursday night) I asked pjf for some advice on my skills.  He helped me out and then we went out partying together.  I got 10% of my way to guild level in a couple of hours.
<p>
Since then we've played rather more than we've had time for and I'm back to 69% to my <b>next</b> guild level.
<p>
I never would have thought that all I had to do to get pjf interested in playing again was to ask him to help me min-max my guild abilities.  I would have done it years sooner if I'd known that.  :)</p>
