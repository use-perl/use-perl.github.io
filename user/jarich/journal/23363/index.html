<p>The fox was back again last night.  It found the only weakness in the securing of the pen which we did in December.
<p>
It scared our oldest, and my favourite, chook (Phoenix) out of the coop and bit her.  Fortunately she made so much noise that we managed to wake up, run outside and rescue her before any more harm was done.
<p>
Today she is alive but a little fragile.  The wounds look like they've started healing (fortunately the fox got more features than flesh) and in a week or so she should be as right as rain.
<p>
I guess we'll be doing more work on securing the pen tonight and this weekend.
<p>
On a slightly different note, our rabbit seems to be very unhappy with the idea of Phoenix staying in the laundry.  He bolts passed the laundry and stomps on his way in and out.
<p>
This is strange because he usually quite enjoys playing with the chickens when they're out in the yard.  Maybe she still smells like fox?
