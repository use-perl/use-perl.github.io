Australian Federal elections always include a few crack-pot lunatic political parties.  This isn't surprising considering how many political parties <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Political_parties_in_Australia">we have</a>.  However, for those who vote for the Senate by numbering all the candidates from 1-68 below the line (those voting above the line just put a single "1" in any of the 10 or so boxes of their choice) it can be a challenge to remember what all the parties stand for.  
</p>
<p>
I think a lot of people vote based on their emotional reaction to the party's name.  For example non-custodial parents might give the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Custodial_Parents_Party">Non-Custodial Parents Party</a> a higher vote than custodial parents without knowing anything about that party's policies.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_Women_Want_%28Australia%29"> What Women Want</a> is another odd one.
</p>
<p>
I think, sometimes, that the biggest challenge can be in deciding who you put last.  When it comes to deciding between great parties like Family First, One Nation, Australian Shooters Party, Christian Democratic Party and the Citizens Electoral Council; how do I decide who I like least?
<p>
Fortunately, one of these has seen fit to spam me with information on their beliefs to help me decide to put them last.  Even putting the fact that they spammed me aside, I can't vote for a party who writes (in all seriousness):
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
... Make no mistake: the "climate change" swindle run by the British financial oligarchy and supported by our complicit mainstream media, will tax us to deathÃ¢â¬âno pun intended. This tax-and-trade scheme will shut down our farmers and manufacturers and ram up the price of petrol, gas and electricityÃ¢â¬âand itÃ¢â¬â¢s all based on one big scientific scam. The London-centred financial oligarchy intends mass genocide ...
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Yup, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens_Electoral_Council">Citizens Electoral Council</a> wins most-crazy crack-pot party from me for this election.
