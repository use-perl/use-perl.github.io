<a href="http://perlbuzz.com/2008/05/perl-decentralize-diversify-colonize.html">Andy Lester's latest article on Perl Buzz</a> lists a bunch of things one can do to help spread the good words about Perl.

But it didn't mention one of my favourites.  <b>Run a conference!</b>  Or at the very least attend a conference, give a talk and then blog about it.  Now I'm not that good about the whole blogging thing.  I come up with great ideas to write about when I'm in bed, or in the shower, or walking down the street; but by the time I get to my computer I've forgotten, or they don't seem that great anymore...
</p><p>
Still I do run and attend, and talk at conferences, and I'm convinced that this is good for both Perl and Open source in general.  Further, I want to go overseas.  I'd *love* to go to YAPC::EU and I'd consider going to YAPC::NA.  But I often hear about them much too late.  What I'd really like to see is a calendar of Perl events.  It'd be cool to have PM meetings on it, conferences etc.  If you could choose whether or to see some continents, or all.  It'd be even more cool if you could subscribe to ical-style feeds per continent.
</p><p>
Unfortunately I don't think I'll have time to do this myself in the very near future, but at least I've got a starting point.
