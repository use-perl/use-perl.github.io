Last November, I went to Canberra for a week.  That would be unremarkable, but it looks to start the busiest 3.5 months of travel so far in my life.  I think this will be the busiest 12 months too.
</p>
<p>
So week of training in Canberra, week home working on my <a href="http://www.osdc.com.au/">OSDC</a> talk.  Then first week of December in Sydney for OSDC.  Week home to recover.  Week in Perth for training.  2 weeks off for Christmas and New Years.  Another week in Perth for more training (different client).  Week home to prepare for <a href="http://linux.conf.au/">LCA</a>.  This week and half of next in Hobart for LCA.  Home for a week and a half (in time for my birthday).  Then off to New Zealand for a week and a half (Wellington, Rotorua, Auckland, Warkworth), home for a day, then to Newcastle/Maitland for a week and a day.  I think that gets me back to Melbourne by the 25th February.  That's 6.5 weeks home and just over 8 away.
</p>
<p>
If everything goes well, we'll be off to Sydney for the second week of March too, and so on for at least one week a month until June.  From mid-June to late August/early September I hope to be off overseas for more conferences, holiday etc.  In particular I hope to get to:
</p>
<ul>
<li>YAPC::NA</li>
<li>OSCON</li>
<li>YAPC::EU</li>
<li>Any European Perl mini-confs/workshops which are proximate to YAPC::EU</li>
</ul>
<p>
Wow.
</p>
<p>
If you will be running something in North America between mid-June and the end of July, and you might like Paul and/or I to speak at it; please contact us.  If you will be running something in Europe between early August to early September etc, please contact us.
</p>
<p>
If you want to host us any nights on our journey, that could be awesome too.
