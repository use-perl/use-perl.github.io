I never would have thought it that hard to implement.  One issue we've had with one of our vendors, is that it feels like we're always dealing with someone new.  And there's never any hand-over of our account between staff.
</p>
<p>
There were other issues, including a <b>really bad day</b> at their facilities once, followed by an extremely compelling offer from a competitor, so we switched.  The competitor is superb at customer service and gave us an account manager straight away.  She has been amazingly cool.
</p>
<p>
Still, the first place wants our custom again, and we're happy to have options, so we talked.  I tried to tell them what we didn't like, and after a few emails I think they might have understood some of it.  They promised us we'd have an account manager, who'd be our single point of contact.  I said that would be lovely.
</p>
<p>
When I spoke to this account manager for the first time, I discovered that she didn't have any record of the upcoming work we'd scheduled with them.  This lack of communication between staff was one of the big reasons we wanted that single point of contact.  I informed her of who I'd spoken to and what dates we'd agreed on.  Now she was up to speed I figured all would be well...
</p>
<p>
So <i>why</i> am I getting email about our selected dates from another staff member again?  And to a private address, which I've explicitly told them about 10 times not to use?  Grr!
</p>
<p>
If they can't implement something as simple as a single point of contact, and send stuff to the requested address, I think we'll just stay with the competitor.
