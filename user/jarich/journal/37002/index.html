Unfortunately, despite plans, I wasn't able to attend OSCON this year even though my husband, <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/pjf/">Paul Fenwick</a> has made it.  It would have been my first time out of Australia, but I'll have to wait for that.
</p>
<p>
Still, I asked him to bring me home a present, and last night he sent me:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
You asked me to bring you home a nice present.  I'm actually bringing home a present from the entire Perl community for you!
</p><p>
You're the recipient of one of the <a href="http://use.perl.org/article.pl?sid=08/07/23/0444225">three White Camel awards</a>!
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I struggled at first to take him seriously.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Really, Wow.</p>
<p> I didn't even know I was nominated.  
Thankyou to the unknown person or persons who nominated me.
</p>
<p>Someone asked me what a white camel award was; and I struggled to answer the question to my satisfaction.  So I searched and <a href="http://www.perl.com/pub/a/1999/06/whitecamel.html">found</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The White Camel reward recognises the Perl community's "unsung heroes"--those who have devoted extraordinary creativity, energy, and time to the non-technical work that supports Perl's active and loyal user community.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I think originally it was divided into three areas: Perl Advocacy, Perl User Groups, and the Perl Community with one award each; but I suspect that distinction has since been dropped.
</p>
<p>
I join a <a href="http://www.perl.org/advocacy/white_camel/">very short list</a> of very impressive people who've also earned one of these awards and share this year with <a href="http://www.szabgab.com/blog/2008/07/1216803339.html">Gabor  Szabo</a> and <a href="http://bulknews.vox.com/library/post/i-got-the-white-camel-award-at-oscon-2008.html">Tatsuhiko Miyagawa</a> who most certainly deserve their awards.
</p>
<p>
Thanks again to those who nominated me; to the judges who've honoured me; to Paul for <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/x180/2694575461/">accepting the award on my behalf</a> and to everyone else who's offered me such lovely and sincere congratulations!
</p></p>

<p>Congratulations! It couldn't have been awarded to a more deserved person.</p>

<h2>graciousness</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/petdance/">petdance</a> on 2008-07-24T15:24:42</h3>
Congratulations, and I admire your graciousness in accepting it.  I'm now ashamed that I didn't say something publicly thanking people.



<h2>Congratulations Jacinta !</h2>

I have rarely been more impressed by a company as the one run by you and pjf.<p>

The combination of </p><p>

quality product</p><p>

love for the product</p><p>

interest in sharing that love</p><p>

will do a lot for both Perl and the local IT community</p><p>

Perl Training Australia seems to embody some of the ideas that make Perl so helpful: that of helping real people (those who are not Linus, Eric, and who don't make a living from building software) to get some value from a computer by helping with the useful things that most people find difficult.</p>
