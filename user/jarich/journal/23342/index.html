I feel a quiet satisfaction every time I see a post on <a href="http://wellington.pm.org/">Wellington.pm</a> or <a href="http://sydney.pm.org/">Sydney.pm</a> these days (I'm subscribed to all the lists in <a href="http://www.pm.org/groups/oceania.html">Oceania</a>).  Wellington PM was deathly quiet 12 months ago and Sydney PM lost all it's members early last year when <a href="http://pm.org/">PM.org</a> changed to using Mailman.
</p>
<p>
Yet today they're both alive and active.  
</p>
<p>
Wellington PM revived when I sent out a "let's introduce ourselves" note to all my PM lists.  When the Wellinton PMers noticed how numerous they were, they decided to start meeting again.
</p>
<p>
Sydney PM revived more recently, when I emailed each person I'd ever seen post and invited them to resubscribe.  Surprisingly it appeared that the list-owner managed to get a copy of my invite as well even though pm.org's address for him was wrong.  The first meeting in a long, long time was a few weeks ago.
</p>
<p>
Encouraging activity in the local PM groups is good business sense for <a href="http://perltraining.com.au">Perl Training Australia</a> and, as a result, we encourage all of our attendees to join (or jump-start) their local PM group.  This has been much more successful for <a href="http://melbourne.pm.org/">Melbourne PM</a>, than others, generally.
</p>
<p>
It's more than that as well, though.  I've learned a lot from being a Melbourne PM member and I want to help other people have that opportunity too.
</p>
<p>
Of course, not all of my endeavours at resurrecting have been so successful.  I know that the <a href="http://brisbane.pm.org/">Brisbane</a> and <a href="http://canberra.pm.org/">Canberra</a> PMs are populated, but they're very, very quiet.  Perhaps we should offer tenders for running <a href="http://www.osdc.com.au/">OSDC</a>, maybe that'd wake them up.  :)
</p>

<p>
The reason that Canberra.PM is so quiet is that nobody is there is allowed to mention what they do for a job, or how they're using Perl &mdash; let alone ask for help or give a presentation.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)
