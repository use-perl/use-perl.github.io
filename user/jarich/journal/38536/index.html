<p><p>
9 months ago, brian_d_foy <a href="http://use.perl.org/articles/08/06/18/2047259.shtml">reported</a> that YAPC::NA 2009 was to be held in Pittsburgh.  Their <a href="http://news.perlfoundation.org/2008/06/yapcna2009_pittsburghpm_bid.html">bid</a> certainly sounded convincing.  So where's the hype for this conference that's supposed to be running 4 months from now?
</p>
<p>
A <a href="http://www.google.com.au/search?q=yapc%3A%3ANA%3A%3A2009+pittsburgh%2C+PA">search for YAPC::NA::2009 Pittsburgh PA</a> gives the <a href="http://www.google.com/calendar/event?eid=MDJkN2JoNDU0bmJ1Y2U1M2Z0b2VzczJqbDggbmdjdG1yZDFjYWMzNTA2MW1yanQzaHBnbmdAZw">Google calendar event</a> but it points at <a href="http://yapc10.com">http://yapc10.com</a>.  Oddly that seems to belong to the "Paris Perl Mongueu(r|se)s".  The <a href="http://www.yapc.org/">Perl Foundation YAPC page</a> is bare on details and just references the Google calendar event (as above).
</p>
<p>
Where can I find out more about this conference?  I want to go, and if I could find a CFP (and it was still open) I'd submit.  Any suggestions?  Perhaps YAPCs are run in a shorter timeframe than I'm used to?
</p>
<p><b>Update:</b></p>
<p>
Unless the list has changed its address since November, it appears that there hasn't been much chatter on the <a href="http://mail.pm.org/pipermail/yapc-na-organizers/">YAPC::NA Organisers list</a>.  
</p>
<p>On the other hand, going deeper into search results suggests that Casey West just yesterday (February 22nd) <a href="http://caseywest.com/2009/02/22/launching-yapc10/">promises the website launch tomorrow</a> (Tuesday 24th February 2009) with the CFP "mid-week" so presumably Wednesday.  His promised website <a href="http://yapc10.org/">http://yapc10.org/</a> is also in use by the Paris Perl folk, but perhaps that's just temporary.  I guess YAPC::NAs are run to a shorter time-frame than we do in Australia.

<h2>YAPC10 got its Act together</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/mir/">mir</a> on 2009-02-23T15:16:14</h3>
<p>I don't know about the conference itself, but I can at least explain one thing: the web site is probably hosted by the French Perl Mongueurs because it runs on <a href="http://act.mongueurs.net/conferences.html" title="mongueurs.net">Act</a mongueurs.net>, a system originally developped for YAPC::Europe in Paris, and that is now used by a lot of Perl conferences around the World.</p>



<h2>Nearly launched</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/cwest/">cwest</a> on 2009-02-24T21:16:02</h3>
Hi,<br/><br/>We're at the final stages for site launch. The DNS for <a href="http://yapc10.org/" title="yapc10.org">http://yapc10.org/</a yapc10.org> (and<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.com) have been directed to the ACT system - as mirod points out -  and we're waiting for  the powers that be to twiddle the right knobs.<br/><br/>Cheers,<br/><br/>--
Casey West

Can you spill some secrets?  When will your CFP close?  What will be your early bird rate and date?    Knowing this stuff (assuming the dates are not next to immediate) will help calm me down and assist with my planning.

Thanks.

April 24th, 2009 is the submission deadline. That's all I can spill right now.<br/><br/>We're launching a static website until the Act version is launched. Can't control everything.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br/><br/>Feel free to catch me on AIM and poke for more details.<br/><br/>Cheers,<br/><br/>--
