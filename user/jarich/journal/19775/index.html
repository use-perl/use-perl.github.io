<p>Apparently I'm employed again.  Apparently I'll get a regular wage again.  Apparently I'll even get my own personal account or some fun thing like that.
<p>
On paper.
<p>
There's a small issue with having a husband who loves book keeping.  I can say something like "but I haven't bought any xyz for _ages_" and he'll tell me when the last time I bought it was.
<p>
Unless I paid cash.
<p>
Then he just bemoans the amount of cash (unaccountable funds) that get spent.
<p>
So anyway, officially I've been unemployed since March.  Or maybe April.  Hasn't stopped me working and earning Perl Training Australia Pty Ltd money and all, but we figured it would be easier - accounting wise - to become employees in the new financial year.
<p>
Means I pay a mite less tax too.  :)
<p>
Yay.  A regular job.  With a regular income.  With regular hours!
<p>
Well... maybe not that a regular job - I still get to work from home and do the laundry in my break times.  And maybe not that a regular income - apparently I'm getting paid every 4 weeks, not the normal 2.  But it should be the same amount each month.  And certainly not that regular hours as far as the last 2 weeks have indicated....
<p>
Well... it'll make my tax return easier next year anyway.</p>
