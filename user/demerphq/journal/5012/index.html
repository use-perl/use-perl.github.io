<p>Well. Every time I think my new Dumper is finished I discover some new bug.  And often the bug aint mine, but rather a perl bug or a Data::Dumper bug.<p>
Anyway, Ive come to the conclusion that (and 'a data structure' means any arbitrary data structure)
<ul>
<li>
Its not possible to correctly dump a perl data structure with just one pass (which is what Data::Dumper tries to do).
</li>
<li>
Its not possible to dump a data structure correctly without using the tools in Array::RefElem
</li>
<li>
Its not possible to correctly dump a data structure using named vars only.
</li>
</ul>
Also in the course of developing Data::BFDump I have discovered bugs in 
<ul>
<li>
Data::Dumper
</li>
<li>
Perl
</li>
<li>
B::Deparse
</li>
<li>
Test::More
</li>
<li>
List::Utils
</li>
<li>
Data::Dump
</li>
</ul>
This accounts for some of the most well known and highly regarded authors in Perldom.  And you know what? Of the bugs I have reported <b>NONE</b> of the authors has responded.  Not so much of a peep. Even on the perl5porters list I got only one reply.  Frankly the impression I get of that place is that if you cant write C/C++ code in your sleep then they wont even speak to you.  A pretty disappointing reaction considering the kind of community that Ive come to love at places like Perlmonks.<p>
Dont get me wrong I appeciate that the perl porters work hard and do a good job.  I appreciate that many of the authors above are very busy people with lots on their plate.  But a lousy email saying 'ACK' to a bug report really doesnt seem like that much to ask.  Hell at least I went out of my way to find and inform them of the bug.<p>

Could it merely be that many of them are busy?  When did you notify them, and did you supply patches?  What were some of the bugs?



<h2>Not replying</h2>

I too was just thinking that it's very odd that of the people I've emailed about the Apache::MP3 localization project, many just didn't reply at all.  My messages weren't to great big lists of people, and clearly weren't spam.  But while I got lots of "OK, I'll do it!" email, I got almost nothing of the sort "Sorry, I can't" -- just silence instead.  If people had said "Sorry, I can't", at least then I'd know to go look for another prospective translator for that language.
