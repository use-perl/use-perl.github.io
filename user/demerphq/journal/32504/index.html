<p>Had a great time at the GPW. Met lots of interesting folks, saw some good talks (although probably didnt understand as much of them as I should given my crappy German skills), and had fun hanging out and meeting some of the people who I only know through the internet.<br/><br/>My talk went pretty well, it probably could be improved some, but considering it was the first time Ive presented to an audience of that size, (about 80-100 people I guess) I think it went just fine.<br/><br/>Annoyingly there are still some bugs in the Perl5 regex engine so a few things that should have worked didnt, but well thats life.<br/><br/>I probably shouldn't have drunk so much on the second day. I passed the point of being able to say no to more alcohol, and just might have made a fool out of myself blabbing on about my days as a courier in london...<br/><br/>Anyway, I'm really looking forward to the next perl gathering and hanging out with folks some more.<br/><br/>Cheers to the GPW organizers for doing a great job, and to eveyrbody that participated.</p>

<p>Not in my opinion. But then I might be not much of an gauge for foolishness, as I have agreed to wear an orange mohawk during YAPC::Europe...</p>

<p>Anyway, I enjoyed the evening, though getting up next day was kind of hard...</p>

Heh, merely<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/surviving/ the next day was kinda hard.<br/><br/>Im looking forward to seeing your mohawk, but I hope this doesnt mean you are going to lose your dreads?

<p>Oh yes, I'm going to loose my dreads (at least partly). I had them for 8+ years and they can get quite annoying (especially in summer, or after washing them).</p>

<p>My plan to cut of my dreads was one of the reasons we (Vienna.pm) offered the organisers hair-do as an auction item. BTW, we were expecting something like a mohawk, and the color wasn't a big surprise, either<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>

<p>I'm still not sure whether I cut em all off, or leave some in the middle (for the mohawk), or leave some at the base of my skull (for the mohawk and for later hair-dos). But there's some time left to decide on that<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...</p>
