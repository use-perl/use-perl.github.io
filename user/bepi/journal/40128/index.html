<div class="span8">
<p>Greetings, and welcome to the very first YAPC::EU::2010 newsletter: "The when, the where, the who and some thank you"!

<p><b>Summary</b></p>

In this issue:

<ul>
<li>Conference theme
<li>Conference dates
<li>Venue
<li>Tickets and availability
<li>Sponsors
<li>Contacts
</ul>

So let's get started

<p><b>Conference theme: The Renaissance of Perl</b></p>

The conference theme is the Renaissance of Perl. This topic pays homage to Italy's role as the cradle of the Renaissance, and acknowledges how Perl is far from a dead legacy language, but is constantly being reborn with, for example, the parallel initiatives of Perl 6, and the Modern Perl 5 movement.
<p>
(Note: we know that these days it's the Perl Enlightenment, and that Perl Renaissance was around 2001-2004, but we're in Italy, not in France :) )

<p><b>Conference dates</b></p>

We are now able to confirm the tentative dates published on Twitter some time ago:
<p>
YAPC::EU::2010 will be held from <b>4 to 6 August 2010</b>.
<p>
We expect sunny and warm Summer days, so don't forget to bring your solar protection!

<p><b>Conference venue</b></p>

Our primary venue turned out to be a no-go... but that's OK, because we had a Plan B! Our secondary venue turned out to be a no-go as well... but even this is OK, because we had a Plan C!
<p>
The conference will be held in:
<p>
<a href="http://www.myonehotel.it/eng/galilei/default.asp">My One Hotel Pisa Conference Centre</a> (<a href="http://bit.ly/8FN64F">Rough map</a>)
<p>
This venue also has 4-star hotel rooms at a reasonable price, many of which are reserved for the conference. It's therefore possible to sleep there, which - besides making the venue only an elevator ride away - is an ideal choice for after-conference BOF, hackatons, etc. On the other hand, the place is a bit outside downtown and uneasy to reach via public transport, so if your idea is visit Pisa and/or have some late-night fun you might want to choose a place to sleep closer to downtown.
<p>
Shuttles will be provided, running from downtown Pisa, for the conference. Hotel shuttles are available from the (nearby) airport.

<p><b>Tickets and availability</b></p>

This venue should be able to hold 400+ people, so there's no attendance limit at present time. Registration will be open on Act, as usual, as soon as we have a catchy website layout.
<p>
Ticket price will be announced in the next newsletter.

<p><b>Sponsors</b></p>

We have already had a great deal of fantastic initial support from some lovely people:

<ul>
<li>Shadowcat Systems UK, agreed to support us even before our bid was accepted!
<li>YEF themselves have offered a "kickstart donation" to help with early-stage costs
<li>And the almost unfeasibly lovely hosts of YAPC::EU::2009 in Lisbon have also given a kickstart donation!
</ul>
This really shows how organizations, both commercial and charitable, in the Perl world are dedicated to ploughing their time and money back into the community. YAPC::EU::2010 wouldn't be possible without help like this!
<p>
We'll be placing an official call for sponsors very soon, but if you can't wait for our next newsletter, please get in touch, and we'll be delighted to discuss!
