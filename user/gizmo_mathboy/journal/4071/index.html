<p>...that's how I feel at the moment.<br/><br/>I was doing great today until I found out that I won't get last week's paycheck until next Wednesday which is a payday as well.<br/><br/>I wouldn't be so upset if:<br/><br/>1) I was told about this in advance. I didn't know I wasn't going to get paid last week until I asked and that was like pulling teeth. I didn't find out about not getting last week's paycheck until next week until I asked about it today.<br/><br/>2) I was a partner. I'm currently just a regular employee. We are supposed to talk about how one becomes a partner Real Soon Now. I think this just caused me want to be more forceful when I talk about my relationship with the company. As a regular employee my level of risk shouldn't be about whether I get paid or not, it should be whether the company will be around or not. Salaries should be a cost like rent, insurance, utilities and our internet connection. Partners take the risk of not getting paid because that risk is compensated by the right to get a chunk of the profits.<br/><br/>I want to be nice about it since I don't think two of the partners will react well if I send my missive to them this week. I plan to do that next week after I get paid. Also, my buddy is the president and I really want this company to work. I know it can it's just a matter of getting past the initial survival phase.<br/><br/>Other than that the job is going great. I'm awaiting UI change requests that are being prioritized by boss. I'm looking through other people's code (Slash in particular) to see how they do the whole web/datbase thing.<br/><br/>Oddly enough they do the database wrapper thing like I want to do (if/when I rewrite my code). The only thing I really need to get the hang of will be TT2. I want to use a templating system so my presentation is separate from the code. TT2 looks to be a nice mix of flexibility and simplicity. I'm looking at HTML::Template and Mason. However, TT2 just seems more my mind set, assuming I play with it more to get a better feel.<br/><br/>Anyhow, time to wade through me snail mail and organize my bills.</p>
