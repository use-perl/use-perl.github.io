<p>The Greeks do have an aptly named phrase there.<br/><br/>If you've read my journal you'll know that I've applied to be a site specialist (sysadmin essentially) for the department I did my undergraduate work. I talk with my buddy, president of the company I currently work for, and he's ok with  me leaving but would like me to stay, too. <br/><br/>If I did leave I would still do maintenance type work for the web site and such. However, he envisions that if I stay we could create some nifty products and make my job something that could generate revenue for the company.<br/><br/>So...do I leave a job where I can telecommute about 99% of the time, have complete autonomy (well 99%), can do what I what when I want. Or do I go work in a job that I'll at the very least have "core" hours (be available in my office and such), have to come into work, have to have an office, get cheap tuition, have other perks associated with working for a university, have the head of the departmen (along with numerous professors) like me and I like them, and deal with students.<br/><br/>Of course I don't have the job yet, not even an interview. Maybe I'm just overing thinking things and just wait and see what happens.<br/><br/>Damn, I'm such a whiner.

<h2>Telecommute!!!!!</h2>

Boy, do I miss it!!!
<div>
I worked for a consulting firm doing Perl and Oracle work for 2.5 years (until they laid me off), and was able to telecommute 99% of the time also.
<div>
I have since found gainful employment, but due to the nature of the job, at present, telecommuting is not a possibility.<br/><br/>I really, really miss it....</div> </div>
