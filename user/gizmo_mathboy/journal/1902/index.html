<p>Well, since I'm soon to be starting a new job and it will entail a lot of Perl (if I have anything to say about it). The only downside is that it is a start up. Talking to the founders (one is a friend) they feel that there is a good chance this thing will last more than a year. They/we will know better within 3-6 months.<br/><br/>Kind of scary, but kind of exciting. My biggest task will be to  write a CRM/ticketing system. I probably should be looking at RT but most of the work will be done on Windows boxes so that sort of puts a damper on it. I hope to look at RT once I get some time but that might not be more 3 months. Oh well, at least I should be getting a pay check during those 3 months.<br/><br/>I do have the database portion fairly well mapped out (I think). The next big challenge is to get the web interface going. That shouldn't be too bad. The real challenge will be the automation portion. Stuff like notifying people that a problem has been logged and no one has picked it up. There is also hooks to notify customer contacts when an issue has been updated and such. Should be a wild and fun ride.</p>

I hope you keep up your diary to let us know how it goes.<p>

Good luck slipping a Unix box in there to run RT on<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p><p>

Don't you have some work to do on a PHP book, Nat?
<br>
<br>But seriously, thanks for the encouragement. I would really like to get a look at RT since it looks rather cool.
<br>
<br>I've got my eye on a couple of Dell Precision 610's. If I get them cheap of the auction site (currently winning at $100) I should be able to give one of my boxes to my girlfriend, use the 610 as my main box, and convert my AMD TBird box to linux. Then I could give pronto a try.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)
