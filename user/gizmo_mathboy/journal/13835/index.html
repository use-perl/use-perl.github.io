<p>Our wedding day, July 19, was absolutely perfect. Not too warm, not too humid.<br/><br/>We had it our house. The ceremony took place under a little arbor were a grape vine has been growing. Our processional was a clip from "The Princess Bride", where the bishop says "Marriage. Marriage is what brings us together today." followed by a clip from the "Marriage of Figaro" overture. We like to be silly and those that know "The Princess Bride" got a chuckle.<br/><br/>The reception afterwards was nice and relaxed. We had some food (meat, potatoes, and egg rolls) catered by the bar I used to work at just after I graduated. The menu was: prime rib, house potatoes (a wonderful amalgam of cheese, cream, and garlic), corn on the cob, southwestern chicken egg rolls, sour dough rolls, black bean salad, green salad, and fruit salad. I think was most everything.<br/><br/>It was a pleasant way to spend an afternoon and evening. I just wish I had got more sleep the night before but I wouldn't have changed a thing.<br/><br/>If people are really interested I could post the TODO lists we made for the days leading up to the wedding. :-)

<p>Go ahead and post; we here at use.marriages.org love that kind of thing.</p>

<p>Actually, I've been amazed at all the planning Sarah's done already.  She hadned me a TODO list Monday, I think.  We've been engaged less than one week, and I haven't even seen her since the day after I proposed, and already we've got the date, location, songs, singers, attendants, and I think Sarah's buying her dress even as we speak.  Sarah claims it's because little girls start planning their weddings in kindergarten.</p>

<p>(I'd counted on at least a month before she started asking why we hadn't set a date yet.  Just to tease her.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) )</p>

<p>We set the following goals for our ceremony:</p>

<ul>
<li>meaningful</li>
<li>low-stress</li>
<li>affordable</li>
</ul>

<p>and I think we're going to do whatever it takes to meet those.</p>
