<p>It's been like two weeks since I last wrote in this.<br/><br/>I guess it's because I've been wrangling with getting my linux box going, making sure the web server is doing what I think it should, getting the db together as well as populated, and wandering through my cgi scripts to make sure that they have a chance of working since they were written on win2k with IIS and SQL Server.<br/><br/>The biggest problem I was having was with the video card for my box. Still do, but I don't really need X up and running to code, it's just something I really like to have.<br/><br/>It seems that the switchover from @Home to InsightBB worked. They said it would start at midnight and internet access would be available at noon. It seems that 2 hours later everything is working ok.</p>

<h2>Video Card</h2>

Which distro of linux did you install?  Which video card is causing the grief?
