<p>Everytime I edit my fantasy baseball teams lineup I keep getting visions of how I can make a better statistical decision.<br/><br/>This mostly involves gleaning a *lot* of information from a vareity of web sites. I keeping piecing it together in the back of my head because I'm feeling lazy and don't want to code it up.<br/><br/>Then again it would be a fun exercise in the use of LWP and an HTML parser of my choice. I could get too ambitious and use it as an excuse to play with the various Test modules.<br/><br/>The weird thing about this is that I really don't like baseball that much. Well, I like the game I just hate the players and the owners. If I could get rid of the spoiled, rich players and the greedy, sleazy owners I would probably watch baseball.<br/><br/>I suppose I can hope that the players strike in August so I will write baseball off totally.</p>

I like music, just hate the industry that it became.
<p>
I never found baseball entertaining, though.  Hockey, yes...football, yes.  Very, very primal, those two.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

A very good simile. However, I do sort of dislike the players as well. They're just as greedy as the owners. Even thought not all of them get the huge multi-millions per year contracts.<br> <br>Maybe I just hate how some industries are.

Well, I'd like to think that there are baseball players (even in the Major Leagues) that just <em>like playing baseball</em>, and it's a nice side benefit that they can make a living doing it.
<p>
Maybe it's not true, but I'd like to think it.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)</p>
