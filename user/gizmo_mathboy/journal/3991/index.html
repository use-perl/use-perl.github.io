<p>I've had quite the busy week.<br/><br/>My friends and I throw a big party every year on the day after Easter. It's known as Dyngus Day. We even have a crappy little <a href="http://w3.one.net/user/jkline/dyngus/">website</a> (that's in serious need of an overhaul) that keeps track of the incriminating evidence. As part of that we have a big dinner get-together the Saturday night before it. We eat, drink, and have a good time (usually play poker).<br/><br/>As for the rest of the week I was mostly tweeking my web app for my company. Nothing major. I do however need to refactor the code base. Man is it getting crufty. I really need to get a more discplined approach to how I add features to the software. Eh, live and learn.<br/><br/>The big project for today was to whip up a logo. Once I get the front page of the site in a respectable state I'll unleash the URL to this journal.<br/><br/>Other than that I've been able to spend time with my girlfriend. It's her school's spring break so she came avisitin'. <br/><br/>Well, back to looking at stinky code and figuring out which feature I get to write next.</p>
