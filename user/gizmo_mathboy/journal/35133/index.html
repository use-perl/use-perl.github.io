<p>I just happened to look through my fans, foes and freaks and noticed I have a foe.<br/><br/>You go <a ref="http://use.perl.org/user/drhyde/">drhyde</a>.<br/><br/>I wonder if it a random foe-ing or intentional? If I truly cared I suppose I could ask or something.<br/><br/>I find it amusing that he's a friend of a friend, too. Not that unusual given Perl's community. I would bet the degree of separation in the Perl community is probably no more than 3 or 4.</p>

<h2>Friends &amp;amp; Foes, Math</h2>

My immediate instinct was to give you another Foe, if you were so thrilled, but with a <code>$nick  =~<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/mathboy/</code>, I have to make it Friend. Anyone who checks primality of $N is my kinda people. (I have marked one Foe, but since Uri never logs in here, it's harmless poking of fun.)

<p>For me, <code>$N</code> is not prime but not highly composite, <code>$N=$P**2</code> for prime <code>$P=$P[$j]</code>, and <code>$N=2**$M + 1</code>, having been recently <code>2**$M</code> which was cool. I won't be Prime until 4 more birthdays, but was prime at <code>$P[$j-1]==2**$M-1</code>.

</p><p>That's probably enough information to solve for <code>$N</code>, especially if one notes that per my blurb here, I've now been using Perl 4 + Perl 5 for 12 years, after resisting holding tight to AWK which I had used for 4 years before Perl was announced (which improves the natural lower bound to <code>$N</code>, which is also obviously bounded from above).  I hope that my having used Perl as many years as AWK before (12) it doesn't mean I have to switch to Ruby or *shudder* Python now<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...</p>

ah yes, the even prime is the oddest number of all.

Or accidental? My understanding of it is that you choose your friends and foes, i.e., you chose him as a foe. If he foed (I made that word up) you, then he would be on your "freak" list.
