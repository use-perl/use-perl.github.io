<p>Well, I did get a lot accomplished at the office. There are some bits of code I need to add but I think it's tweak mode at the moment. The real task I need to do is go over the code base and hack away the cruft.<br/><br/>It is amazing to me how bad code can get when you are trying to fix a problem quickly. Sometimes the design I laid out saves me from writing crappy stuff but other times I'm rushed and write some hideous stuff.<br/><br/>I think I'll try and do that in the next week or two. It should also give me the incentive I need to create a proper dev environment that is separate from production. Heck, maybe I'll be hyper-ambitious and get CVS up and running (anyone have a version control system that they think is better?). I might even make it a pseudo-content management system.<br/><br/>On top of everything else I just bought a new view. A big, bad 2002 Dodge Ram 1500 Quad Cab. Damn it is huge. Shiny, too :-) I probably wouldn't have bought if I didn't get a discount because my buddy works for DaimlerChrysler (1% off manufacturer's invoice if you must know).<br/><br/>It guess crappy mileage but I intend to be places where I need a truck and 4wd, too. Also, ain't I being patriotic buying big ticket items? ;-)<br/><br/>Well, off to do some more surfing and maybe some work.</p>

- Everyone knows how to use it<br>- It has Mac, Windows, &amp; Unix clients<br>- It's free software<br>- It works well enough for most things<br> <br>There _are_ better alternatives:<br> <br>BitKeeper - not free, don't know about the clients<br> <br>SubVersion - not done!<br> <br>arch - better? maybe.  It's a collection of shell scripts, which scares me.<br> <br>Perforce - not free
