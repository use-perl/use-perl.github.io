<p>I received yesterday what is the last of New Architect (aka Web Techniques). I really did think that the magazine went downhill precipitously when they Changed the name and the format. Lincoln's articles were about the only good thing on a regular basis and I really did miss merlyn's stuff.<br/><br/>I really shouldn't bitch though because I didn't pay for it. I would have paid for Web Techniques but not NA. Of course there are a lot of magazines I receive that I don't pay for: Software Developer, InfoWorld, eWeek, InternetWorld, ad nauseam. I only receive them because I don't pay for them. I could just as easily read the website instead.<br/><br/>Heck, I'm even dumping two magazines that I've paid for: Dr. Dobb's and SysAdmin. SysAdmin wasn't all that useful and Dr. Dobb's was good but I didn't want to continue to get it.<br/><br/>I think two of the best tech publications I read are TPJ and TPR. I really would like to receive dead tree versions of those but I'll be patient.</p>

I've been reading WT and NA also, and indeed, the new format was bound to failure<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... they skipped a lot of technical items in favour of managereal content. Anyway, I did pay for WT as I live in europe and free WT was only available for US subscriptions.<br>Other magazines I read are TPJ, TPR, scientific amercican, MIT technology review and IEEE spectrum<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...<br>I pay for all but one<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)

You could save some trees and get digital<br>subscriptions to many of those. An added<br>benefit of that is many magzines offer<br>access to their archives to digital<br>subscribers.

I have been buying DDJ at the newsagent for several years but it (along with oreillynet) seem to be only interested in<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.Net, Java and embedded tech.
<p>
Every issue now includes at least one of each of those topics. There are plenty of important technological ideas out there apart from these buzzwordy and over-hyped areas.
</p><p>
I haven't been able to buy the one issue I really wanted (typical) which covered databases in detail, but I will probably order the CD-ROM soon as there is a wealth of very useful information contained in the backlog of issues.
</p><p>
I used to buy Byte religiously before and during university but it became less focused on the hows of technology and more on the commercial side.
</p><p>
I think there is quite a gap in the magazine shelves that used to contain DDJ, Byte and WT. A decent magazine that covered modern computer science and related topics like directed graphs, database design, object orientation, etc would be well worth the money. I know I would pay real money per issue for something that could explain modern sorting, object persistence, etc without having to buy the latest software.
</p><p>
Most of DDJ's articles now cover commercial software products, rarely are these articles impartial and they certainly aren't applicable to other technology. Even the the journal of the ICM (or whatever it is called) has published very biased and uninformed articles.

Yeah, DDJ and Byte were good in there prime. I even followed Byte went it to Byte.com only. Of course, I haven't read Byte.com since they've started charging.<br> <br>I would concur with you about how DDJ has gone crazy pursuing only a few technologies.<br> <br>Maybe when the tech sector gets healthier something like WT can make a comeback.

I'm working on more general programming coverage for ONLamp.com and elsewhere on ORN.  It'll still be open sourcey, but will try to avoid overhyped buzzwords.

Hopefully, you noticed that I'm still writing monthly for <i>Linux Magazine</i>, and bi-monthly for <i>SysAdmin</i>.

I subscribe to LM and will let SysAdmin expire. There really isn't much to SysAdmin other than your stuff and a few other things. As much as I like your stuff it's not enough to carry a magazine unless you wrote like 4 articles or something.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br> <br>I usually scrounge around your archives when I need to.
