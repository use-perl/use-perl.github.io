<h2>Poor taste</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/bart/">bart</a> on 2003-01-27T14:22:59</h3>
We've watched a bit of the television emissions of Superbowl last night. It was on here, even though we do live in Europe (be).
<p>What struck us, was how good taste quickly goes down the drain as soon as a huge audience is expected. The pause music, the cheerleaders, the interjected computer animations... it was all so incredibly poor.
</p><p>"Art" and large audiences appear not to blend well. At least, that what the programme makers appear to be thinking.
</p><p>We're still amazed how good, beautiful movies can come out of Hollywood.</p>

Good, beautiful movies out of Hollywood? I suppose there are a couple. There's some much dross to wade throught that I don't go to the cinema much at all, especially now that I've started using Netflix.<br> <br>As for the game and it's associated mess...I would have to agree. Although I would never put art and the Superbowl togther except when antithetical is somehow involved.
