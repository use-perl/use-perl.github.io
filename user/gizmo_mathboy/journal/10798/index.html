<p>It looks like the ISP I've been using for years is stopping shell access. That's about the only reason I've kept it.<br/><br/>Since I'm switching I would prefer to run the webserver and such myself but I can't get any affordable broadband that is server friendly since I really would like to redo my site in Mason or at least use mod_perl.<br/><br/>So, does anyone have any recommendations for a webhosting service that has shell access and a decent shell?</p>

I've had an account with pair Networks (<a href="http://www.pair.com/" title="pair.com">www.pair.com</a pair.com>) for several years now. They aren't the cheapest, but they have tons of bandwidth and an excellent reputation. The cheapest account to run custom CGI is an Advanced ($18/mo) and the Webmaster ($30/mo) gives you more disk, bandwidth, &amp; 10 MySQL databases.

I'll second the Pair recommendation. I have a couple of domains there. They've been rock solid, responive in the few instances I've needed help, and their connectivity is very good.

and I'll third it.<br> <br> <a href="http://he.net/" title="he.net">he.net</a he.net> is cheaper, and if all you want is shell that might work for you, but their perl is old (at least it was when I was there). They give you enough space to install your own, but I'd rather let an ISP keep up with updates than do it myself.<br> <br>I'm sure there are places cheaper than that even, if all you need is shell, but I don't have experience with them.<br> <br>If you want great service, bandwidth, uptime, features, etc, then pair is a very good choice. The only problem I've had with pair is that they time out processes too fast. Sometimes I want to do something at the command line that takes a while to work. Their reaper is designed (I think) to kill rouge CGI scripts and irc bots, but it can cause colatteral damage. I only ran into that problem when doing some command-line graphics munging.<br> <br>-matt<br>

<p>
I go with <a href="http://www.dreamhost.com/rewards.cgi?cogent" title="dreamhost.com">Dreamhost</a dreamhost.com>, and I rather like 'em.  I've been with them on-and-off (as I've gone back and forth between hosting my sites from my apartment) since 1999.  Their support is great, and their features are awesome:  unlimited MySQL databases jump foremost to mind.  They provide enough disk space that I was able to install my own copy of Perl, but if you wanna use 5.6.1 and their modules, it's there.
</p>
<p>
One thing I particularly like about 'em is their <a href="http://www.dreamhost.com/panel/" title="dreamhost.com">control panel</a dreamhost.com>, which does a pretty damned good job of mixing ease with power.
</p>
<p>
When I recentlyish re-started up a plan (after having hosted my sites from my apartment for a while), they were offering a free domain registration for the lifetime of the account.  I dunno whether that's still going on.
</p>
<p>
Note that if you use the first link in this post, or otherwise tell 'em <a href="http://www.dreamhost.com/rewards.cgi?cogent" title="dreamhost.com">cogent sentcha</a dreamhost.com>, I get a bonus.  Which would be nice.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-D
