<p>I know I should be hacking away on the notificiation system for my ticketing system but I've been watching the deleted scenes and other fun stuff from "Dogma", "Clerks", and "Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back". I just bought them the other day. I've been a huge fan of Kevin Smith's works since the day I watched "Clerks". It was nice to see him make "Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back". How often does a director get to make a movie for the fans? If you didn't see all of the previous work then you missed out on a lot of inside jokes.<br/><br/>Then again I also just finished reading _If Chins Could Kill_ by Bruce Campbell. I think Bruce and his buddies (Sam Raimi especially) do make movies they would like to see and to me that is good movie making. I'm also reading _The Evil Dead Companion_, yeah I'm a glutton.<br/><br/>I really do enjoy directors like Sam Raimi, Kevin Smith, and Robert Rodriguez. They make films thay matter to them (for the most part, Rodriguez did some stuff that seemed way too corporate, "The Faculty"). If I ever decide to act on my ideas for movies (big task since I'm such a slacker) I can honestly say they inspired me to do it. That and the total crap that Hollywood shovels at us.<br/><br/>Well, that being said I'm off to get some Steak and Shake for lunch and probably go see "40 Days and 40 Nights". Yeah, yeah, I know it's Hollywood tripe but I love going to movies.</p>

<h2>Movies (and DVDs)</h2>

_JASBSB_ is probably the second best DVD I own, the first being the _Grail_.  I'm not sure if it's just that one specific edition of it, but it had assloads of things with it -- four different subtitle sets (including Henry IV!), three languages, sketch upon sketch from Gilliam's pads, etc.
<p>
Are most comedies like this?  Or is it just the quality of Python and Smith that made these DVDs that good?</p>

I don't have _Holy Grail_ but _JASBSB_ did have a lot of stuff on it, kind of like the special edition of _Dogma_. I don't know about most comedies but I think Kevin Smith is one of those directors that understands movies aren't about money. Heck, he jokes about not being able to gross more than $30 million.<br> <br>It is my opinion that Hollywood is all about money and has nothing to do with art. Hopefully directors like Smith, Gilliam, Rodriguez, and Raimi can keep making great movies there without getting infected.

I don't think Smith could ever have that kind of problem.  When he hosted the extra-stuff on _JASBSB_, he looked exactly like I pictured him:  Comfortable in some ways, and not at all sure that things would remain so.
<p>
Personally, I am of the opinion that he's remarkably talented and that the Askewniverse films are sort of private joke that happened to get passed around a lot.  I wouldn't mind seeing a Clerks 2, or a Catching Amy (well, not with that title, sure), but I want to see what other movies he can make.</p>

<h2>Overrated</h2>

I've seen <i>Clerks</i> twice now and, while amusing at times, I just didn't think it was *that* funny.  Now, for the shoestring budget on which it was made it was good, but I can't give it more than 2 1/2 stars out of 4.  Mostly, I think people like this movie for the same reason they like Letterman - it's cool to like it.
<p>
I've never seen JASBSB, but I did see <i>Dogma</i> and I have to say I didn't like it.  What killed this movie, and it has killed others IMO, is that it couldn't decide if it wanted to be serious or funny.</p>

I think Clerks is overrated, as you apparently do.  It was OK, and very good for its budget, but I thought the acting was weak and many of the jokes just weren't as funny as they were apparently meant to be.<br> <br>I think Dogma was a nice movie, but several parts of it just didn't work, and overall I think it was quite forgettable.  I think it tried too hard.<br> <br>Chasing Amy was fantastic.  A bit slow in some parts, but it was interesting and engaging and funny.<br> <br>I never saw Mallrats or JASBSB.<br>
