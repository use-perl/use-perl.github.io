<p>Since my girl friend is a teacher I was confronted with an interesting task.<br/><br/>Determine the readability a website.<br/><br/>There a few indices out there (Fog, Flesch, Kincaid, and Frye) that use things like: syllables in a word, words in a sentence, and such.<br/><br/>Fortunately there is a module that does this already:<br/><br/>Lingua::EN::Fathom which builds on Lingua::EN::Syllable. So I just need to add in Frye's readability index to the module (must give the author that patch when I get it working), construct the sub that fetches the page, the sub that tries to rip out some representative text, and then run it through the black box. I probably should make it a Tk (or other GUI app for that matter) so that it's easy for students and teachers to use.<br/><br/>Of course, I need to finish writing that db search routine for work before I do that...</p>

<i>Since my girl friend is a teacher I was confronted with an interesting task.</i> <br> <br><br/><br/>Your girlfriend presented me with an interesting task last night as well.  She taught all of us a
number of new things.<br> <br><br/><br/><i>Determine the readability a website.</i> <br> <br><br/><br/>Maybe you should determine the readability of your own posts before judging others.<br> <br><br/><br/><i>There a few indices out there (Fog, Flesch, Kincaid, and Frye) that use things like: syllables in a word, words in a sentence, and such.<br/><br/>Fortunately there is a module that does this already:</i> <br> <br><br/><br/>Yeah, let others do the work for you.  Slacker.  And I don't wanna hear about Perl modules, code
reuse and all that crap.  Hey, maybe  there's a module to do your job, yeah found it: Lazy::Slacker<br> <br><br/><br/><i> probably should make it a Tk (or other GUI app for that matter) so that it's easy for students and teachers to use.</i> <br> <br><br/><br/>Better make it easy for the other short bussers too.<br> <br><br/><br/><i>&gt; Of course, I need to finish writing that db search routine for work before I do that...</i>
<br> <br><br/><br/>We can all see how much effort you are putting into this "partner" thing at work.<br> <br><br/><br/>-Cliff
