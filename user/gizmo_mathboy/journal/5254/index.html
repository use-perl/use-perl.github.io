<p>In a fit I wrote a credo for my company. I mostly did it because I was reading _Built to Last_ and I was thinking that the company needed an ethical foundation. I also think it helps to have a guideline for expected behaviour.<br/><br/>Then again it was 2am and I may have just been too sleep deprived to think clearly. In any case I passed it along to the president of the company. He seems to like it. I guess I'll see how it turns out.</p>

This sounds suspiciously like Jerry Maguire, and you know what happened to him!

In this case the president of the company is one of my best friends. He actually liked it. So I don't think I have to worry about a Jerry Maguire moment.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

A... credo? Is that like a <a href="http://www.lonsteins.com/perl-stuff/management_speak.pl" title="lonsteins.com">mission statement</a lonsteins.com>?

Maybe. I see it as a guideline for behavior and an ethical foundation for the company. It is a mission statement in the simplest of definitions. I want to give the company a sense of purpose and a expectation of behaviour.<br> <br>I want the words to have meaning to everyone in the company and to our customers as well.<br> <br>Maybe it's drawing a line in the sand. What can I say it was induced by a lack of sleep and what I consider to be good management ideas.
