<p>I forgot to mention that I closed on my new house Tuesday. My girlfriend is excited and I'm just sort of blah about it. I should have more of a reaction now that I have a mortgage or something.<br/><br/>Just a place to live I guess. No different than the rest except I have to maintain it, pay the bills, and get to decide what to do to it.<br/><br/>Better catch some sleep I guess.</p>

<h2>Feh Upon Those Houses!</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/chaoticset/">chaoticset</a> on 2002-07-27T23:07:12</h3>
My mother/stepfather and mother-in-law have been trying to convince me that, after the marriage (whose date has been changed yet again -- YAMDC?), my best bet is to get a house.
<p>
I don't know.  Spend a shitload of time working on the place, mowing the lawn, installing siding, etc., and minor home repairs, vs. having a fairly snappy landlord who looks into these things more thoroughly than I ever would.  It sounds like an easy choice to me:  Rent.
</p><p>
They say it's the only investment you can ever make.  I fail to see why I need to give up large chunks of time to make huge payments on <em>my</em> investment; precious metals sound like a much better deal.
</p><p>
I wouldn't mind owning a house as long as I had enough money that paying to keep it up wasn't prohibitively expensive or hassling.  Otherwise, it sounds like a waste of time.</p>
