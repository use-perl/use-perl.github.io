<p>Well, my Precision is running (sorta) with Mandrake 8.2 beta2 (yeah, call me crazy). Some stuff seg faults (mozilla and konqueror on occasion) but for the most part it's no worse than win2k :-)<br/><br/>Watching/reading/hearing my buddy, el presidente of the company, talk about the negotiations he is into is rather interesting. We have a bunch of interesting contracts in the works. Should help get the rocket off the launch pad into a very decent orbit so to speak.<br/><br/>Of course, some of this revolves around the software I'm writing (or not is the case since I'm recovering from a cold/flu like thing, I really should be in bed healing). I don't mind the pressure, kinda of gives focus and urgency. Makes one feel needed :-)<br/><br/>The one downside is the need for a drug test from one of our potential clients. Not that I'm afraid them finding anything (I'm okay with other people using certain drugs it's just not something I would do or would like to see my friends do) but more from the intrusion into my personal life. I'll do it because of the need for filthy lucre but I wish I was in the position to protest it. Dems da breaks.<br/><br/>The one bad thing is that we didn't go with the VPN plan available from our DSL provider. From the original details they cahnged it to be lower per month but asked for a longer commitment. Even though installing VPN into systems is something we do, I think it's better to let someone else take care of it. It's my opinion that it is better for our guys to be out billing/working for our clients then to be fiddling with our network. After all the differnce is probably in the neighborhood of 5-10 billable hours at our rate. That works to less than 1 hour per month. I think we've done that much work already getting the VPN setup. Then again I'm a minion and not a partner.<br/><br/>Well, it's off to bed for me so I can code like a fiend this weekend.</p>
