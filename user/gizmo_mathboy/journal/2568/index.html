<p>Woohoo! It looks like the other folks in the company that know networking better than I seem to have VPN up and running. It's a temporary solution until we get DSL installed at our new office.<br/><br/>It looks like we are going with <a href="http://www.megapath.net/">MegaPath</a> for the new office. My buddy, the pres, has Speakeasy.net but they didn't have the management package (gateway/firewall/VPN) that MegaPath is offering. They are using their residential service as a test bed for their business class offering. In either case I'm just happy to get hooks into the network.<br/><br/>That means I get to do real work now. My work ethic couldn't be happier.<br/><br/>I was just playing with VNC on my multitude of win2k boxes. Very cool. I just need to get a VNC server installed on my linux box. Of course, this sort of makes my KVM switch useless and I just ordered two more cables for my other boxes. Oh well, I guess I can view it as redundant systems. Now I need to figure out how to get VNC to work through the gateway. Off to RTFM I go!</p>
