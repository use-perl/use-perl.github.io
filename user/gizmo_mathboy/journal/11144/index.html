<h2>Baseball is dead</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/djberg96/">djberg96</a> on 2003-03-21T03:44:25</h3>
Over half the players are jacked up on steroids, HGH or greenies.  I guess there will be steroid testing now, but it doesn't sound like it will be very pervasive.
<p>
Here's what I do if I'm elected comissioner tomorrow:
</p><ul>
<li>Random drug testing throughout the year.  You're guaranteed to be checked at least twice during the year.</li>
<li>Any player who tests positive for drugs is immediately suspended for 1 month without pay on the first offense.  The second time you're out for a year.  Third offense and you're out of the league and may never be elected to the Hall of Fame.</li>
<li>Any player who tests positive for performance enhancing drugs immediately has any ML records vacated.</li>
<li>All ML records set since 1990 are vacated.</li>
<li>Revenue sharing</li>
<li>Salary cap</li>
</ul>
I mean, really, aren't we tired of seeing the Yankees go to the series 3 or 4 times every decade while half the league hasn't made it to the playoffs in 20 years?



<h2>Salary cap and revenue sharing</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/gizmo_mathboy/">gizmo_mathboy</a> on 2003-03-21T13:34:57</h3>
Definitely needed. Anaheim is the first team in about 20 years that wasn't in the top 10 in terms of team salary. You could bet the games based on which team had the high salary. Heck when Arizona won the World Series they were number 2 and beat number 1, the Yanks, IIRC.<br> <br>MLB is a joke.
