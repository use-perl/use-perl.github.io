<p>Not much that you can say. There were some excellent ones and not so excellent ones.<br/><br/>gnat's movie definitely stole the show. I look forward to grabbing that once it's posted somewhere.<br/><br/>Then I went to the Perl6 BOF. Very interesting. It sort of descended into a "Lord of the Flies" setting.<br/><br/>There was a question about iterating over a list of list (sort of, I didn't understand the idea that was being expressed), then moved to talking about changing grammars within a program, and then a topic about matching specific sequences of base pairs in a really, really long sequence.<br/><br/>Well, each of the last two talks milled about for awhile. Lots of misunderstanding occurred, groups formed to discuss each idea, and then chaos sort of took over. I took it as a sign to go to the Jam BOF/|siv|'s BBQ.<br/><br/>The bbq was fun. I got to talk with folks, listen to pudge, jjohn, and others play, and eat some cooked cow.<br/><br/>I ended the even having a beer at the pub in The Cheshire. Once again it was a nice time chatting with fellow Perl folks.</p>
