<p>So, now that I've published the lists we used to organize the chaos of a wedding I can start whining about the damn RPC worm in Windows.<br/><br/>It made life a bit annoying. Mostly because to patch it we decided to go ahead and deploy SP4 for win2k. I decided to roll out some other patches as well which required a reboot as well. Didn't get the chance to package them up so this could be done relatively automatically so I was running around like a chicken with my head cut off.<br/><br/>Not to mention that a scheduled power outtage for Sunday night, some maintenance work, occurred Monday night without my site being notified. Joy. I was wondering why my servers were down at midnight. The real kicker was that the locks for the outside doors were re-keyed recently and I didn't remember until I was vainly trying to open then that I didn't have the new key.<br/><br/>So, things are going great, at least in my married life. My professional life could be better, but I think that is to be expected for a sysadmin.</p>
