<p>I finally scratched a minor itch of mine.<br/><br/>I really don't have sufficient access to a mail server to use fun things like Mail::Audit and Spam Assassin (or the time to figure out how to use them in my current situation).<br/><br/>However, I can take advantage of Mozilla's message filters. It ain't nuthin' fancy but it seems to be working.<br/><br/>Basically, I am reading my Spamfilter folder (for email that is probably spam and needs to be added to my rules file) and grabbing the From: line and ripping out that email address. I then add that into the rules.dat file for Mozilla.<br/><br/>Yeah, I know that is not the best way to do that. <br/><br/>I am currently moving spam that isn't caught into the  Spamfilter folder by hand. I really need to had a rule that dumps an email there if it doesn't meet any of the rules so far.<br/><br/>Of course, that means I need to create a white list of rules and I haven't written a script to grab the list of addresses from the address book. I can't find much info for the binary format that Mozilla uses in its addressbook. I suppose I could dump it to an ldiff ( LDAP format IIRC ) and then parse it to create my white list. Maybe that will be tonight's (well...my "around 6pm" project).<br/><br/>In any case, I wrote that and am most of the way through coding up an interface to grabbing billing data from the db and drop it into an email so that it can eventually make it to our accounting books so we can hopefully get bill folks.<br/><br/>I suppose I can hit the hay and get a few hours sleep before the sun gets up.</p>

SpamAssassin ships with both a POP3 and a SMTP proxy, so however you download your mail you should be able to pass it through spamassassin.
