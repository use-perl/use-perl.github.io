<p>I was reading Scientific American today and something occurred to me (I had read a snippet about how fingerprint scanners work).<br/><br/>If these scanners are used more I would think that more people would be stealing fingerprints. Once that level gets high enough then people might start wears gloves or such more and more.<br/><br/>Now if more and more wear gloves regularly wouldn't criminals be more likely to wear gloves because it's part mainstream culture. Wouldn't that lead to an increase in the number of unsolved crimes?<br/><br/>Of course, this is all idle conjecture about how culture might change by the introduction of new tech. I think the thesis that there would be a rise in unsolved crimes because of fingerprint scanners is rather weak. Criminals don't always wear gloves now. Also, I'm not sure how the public would react to fingerprint theft.<br/><br/>Well, I'll leave this thought somewhat incomplete and get on with my day.</p>
