<p>I'm sitting here contemplating my next pick in a fantasy baseball draft. I like baseball as a game. I can watch it, enjoy the pastoral nature of it, and generally am ok with it. <br/><br/>However, since the last strike I've had an intense hatred for the players and the owners. I was in the league last year as a lark. I actually won't it. Surprised the fuck out of me, too.<br/><br/>I hate the game now more than ever. The Major League Baseball is a weasel. They want to get rid of two teams. They won't even consider revenue sharing.<br/><br/>George Will and some other baseball fans of note were asked to be part of a commission to investigate how to make MLB more competitive. They made the conclusion that revenue sharing was needed. Their research showed that in playoff series the team with the higher payroll won. Excuse me will I find a link to the report or something....<br/><br/>Here's a <a href="http://www.sportslawnews.com/archive/Articles%202000/MLBreport.htm">link</a> to a story about the report.<br/><br/>So, I'm basically doing it because it's a bunch of guys I used to work with at the company I used to work for. It's kind of fun but it's mostly just hanging with the guys.<br/><br/>I even wrote a script to take last year's stats and to a very crude modeling based on our scoring system to rank players. Heck, it was like 30 minutes work with testing and jiggering with stuff.<br/><br/>I doubt it will help me but it felt better than drawing names out of hat. :-)<br/><br/>Well, back to coding.</p>
