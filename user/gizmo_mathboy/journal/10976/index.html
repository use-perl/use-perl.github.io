<p>I seemed to have spent most of my day slogging through my desk. I was going through the reams of documents my predecessor filed away. Today alone I probably recycled at least 3 reams of paper. The dude printed out man pages!<br/><br/>It is just kind of scary what people print instead of just leave in electronic form. I admit that I've printed out many an electronic document, but I printed them out so I could peruse them at my leisure and it locations not amenable to having a computer, even a laptop, around.</p>

<h2>Strange Theory</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jmm/">jmm</a> on 2003-03-11T19:17:45</h3>
A friend once told me of a strange theory, that seems to have some basis in fact, although I haven't tried to track down details.
<p>
He said that there is a left/right brain distinction between the processing of transmitted versus reflected light.  It was determined by comparing how well proofreaders did when converting from paper to CRT displays - they would find some errors on the display, but miss many that they would have seen on paper.
</p><p>
I know that I prefer to read things on paper instead of on a CRT screen.  However, I prefer paper to a LCD screen too, and that does use reflected light instead of transmitted light for its display.</p>
