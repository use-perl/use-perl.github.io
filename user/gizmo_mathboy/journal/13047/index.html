<p>I just watched England annihilate Australia (can't recall when the match was actually played). I just wish I could have seen the match England played against the All Blacks. I would think this makes England the favorite for this year's World Cup.<br/><br/>I did get to see the replay of the New Zealand v. Wales match. The Welsh team were just over matched. They played good but the All Blacks were just a wave of power. I couldn't believe how much the Kiwi Umaga would take the ball and crash the line. He's a winger for goodness sakes.<br/><br/>Well, enough ruby talk, this is a Perl site after all. Wait, I can sort of bring Perl into this. Gnat, what's up with your All Blacks? I didn't think England was that good, but I guess they are.<br/><br/>Well, off to bed.</p>

<h2>They've got something to prove</h2>

And they've certainly got a lot of naysayers to prove wrong. Too often England have choked come the crunch matches and that reputation must be really starting to piss them off. Winning the Grand Slam in the style they did this year must have helped enormously with the attitude issues.

Their forwards mauled unbelievably well in the match against the Wallabies. I love watching the forwards get to muck it up a bit. I loved playing the loose forward positions in college. Lock was ok but I wasn't much of a jumper.<br> <br>I'm just impressed by the play of some of the backs in all the matches I've seen. They took the ball and attacked the line like a forward. Crazy stuff.
