<p>Well, I'll blame jdavidb for triggering this entry. :-)<br/><br/>I have been busy planning a wedding, actually doing the wedding, and recovering from the wedding.<br/><br/>My wife Anne and I were married July 19 by our best friend. He wasn't a priest or anything, we just felt he was the reason we met and it made sense for him to officiate the thing. We had a deputy county clerk present to make things right by the state.<br/><br/>We had perfect weather, awesome food, and fantastic time celebrating with friends and family. The ceremony and party/reception were at our house.<br/><br/>The only real bummer was that I woke up at 1am the day of the wedding and couldn't fall back to sleep. I didn't sleep until midnight. Ugh.<br/><br/>I'll share more tomorrow 'cause I'm exhausted.</p>

I guess this is an amplification of the last paragraph of your previous entry:<p>
<i>Now on to the tasks that have languished for two days. Oi. </i></p>



<h2>My fault? ;)</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jdavidb/">jdavidb</a> on 2003-07-30T14:29:14</h3>
<p>Well, congratulations!</p>

<p>I think it's funny how lots of folks on this site do things at the same time.  In 2001, a bunch of us were all buying houses.</p>

Marriage is only the first step to (over-)filling the houses.  Getting your opening slide material may be next year's shared activity.
