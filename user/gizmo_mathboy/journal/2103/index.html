<p>Well, I think I have the foundation laid down for my ticketing/CRM app, at least the bare bones.<br/><br/>Users can login and be validated. A cookie id's the browser. I sort of used one of Randal's Web Technique columns as a guide. I'm using a db for it instead of File/Cache::Cache.<br/><br/>Logins time out.<br/><br/>Users are divided into groups. There is a parent child relationship between groups. This facilitates viewing tickets/issues so that parents can see their children's issues but not vice versa. I think I might also add a "view as" so that a child can have a view like that of another group.<br/><br/>Users can open a new issue, update it, and if they are in the correct group they can close it and assign an owner.<br/><br/>The next big set of steps:<br/><br/>- throw it to the wolves...I mean users to beat on
- throw in the real value: automation
  - let people know an issue as been opened
  - let people know if there is incomplete info
  - other fun stuff I can not think of off the top of my
    head but is in my design book
- look at RT for ideas. I might even use it
- think about how to rewrite it to make it better
- document what I have already done (I wanted it up and    
  running and skimped on the doco and comments (bad code 
  monkey)
- move over to Apache so I can more easily play with things
  like Mason/Embperl/Templating systems/mod_perl/etc
  I still will be using MS SQL Server as the db but maybe
  I'll give PostGres a go.<br/><br/>Well, I need to get some sleep so I'm off to do some reading (Lucifer's Hammer - been meaning to read it for quite some timenow).<br/><br/>It seems that VPN is working (I need to grab a client so I can really get some work done at home). If nothing else I'll be away from the Proliant server. That things generates some righteous decibels of white noise.<br/><br/>I am anxiously awating my Dell Precision 610. It should arrive Tuesday. Mmmm...dual Xeons....for the low, low price of $190 ($245 with shipping), my buddy got a 410 for $70 ($120 with shipping). It ONLY has regular PII's ;-)<br/><br/>Of course that means I have to get my old box (compaq deskpro ep) fixed up for my girlfriend so she can use the intel pc cam I gave her for xmas(nothing nice, just good enough for 640x480 pictures and netmeeting). I also need to find a good broadband service for her.<br/><br/>I'm also waiting for Bookpool te send my order of O'Reilly books.<br/><br/>- Mastering Perl/Tk
- Practical PostgreSQL
- Programming Jabber
- Programming Web Services with SOAP<br/><br/>Sorry gnat, but it's hard to pass up 40% savings.<br/><br/>What else can I ramble on about...<br/><br/>I getting some Go books. I've always been interested in learning how to play. I downloaded a go game for my Handspring. It whooped me quite soundly. So I figured I should try and learn the basics.<br/><br/>I am also waiting for "Rebuilding the Wall". Damn you gnat! ;-)<br/><br/>Ok, I'm really, really done writing now.</p>
