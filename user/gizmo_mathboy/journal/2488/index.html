<p>What I don't know about networking would fill many a library.<br/><br/>The unfortunate thing is that my lack of knowledge of networking, gateways/VPN in particular, is keeping me from getting even a simple gateway working. Very disturbing.<br/><br/>I guess I'll keeping banging me head against the wall and read all the docs I can find.</p>

...we could all call Miss Cleo, have her tell us all the things that
you're having problems with, and pre-emptively answer your questions.

I'll just ask her the next time she calls my house.

Well, I'm trying to use the Linux Router Project's gateway distro (Dachstein)
<br>
<br>As near as I can tell all the configurations are correct (IP address and such for eth0/eth1). I can ping the addresses from the gateway machine (imagine that) but I can't ping to an outside address nor can I ping the addresses from another box on the network.
<br>
<br>Like I wrote, networking isn't my forte. I'm getting ready to have at it again and start with one card at a time and build from there.
<br>
<br>I would be happy to just get it working as a gateway, VPN would be a side benefit to me at the moment.
