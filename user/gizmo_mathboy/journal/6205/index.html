<p>Well, it's been a long week since YAPC Day 3.<br/><br/>YAPC Day 3:<br/><br/>I mostly was in Schwern's talks. Learned mucho about Testing::* and 'Being Lazy. Very good time.<br/><br/>I bought two books at the auction, |siv|'s CGI book which I made him re-autograph since the first one mentioned Java. :-) The other was a book about 802.11b networking. Both good buys in support of the Perl Foundation.<br/><br/>Damian's talk was just plain fun.<br/><br/>The Town Hall was good as always. It gave me plenty to think about on the drive home.<br/><br/>The drive home started immediately after the conference ended. Six hours back to Indiana. Lots of caffeine and a Jack in the Box Ultimate Cheeseburger provided the fuel for consciousness.<br/><br/>The reason for the psycho drive back was to get things moving on buying a house. I needed to sign a bunch of papers (which I didn't bother reading because I trust my girlfriend :-)<br/><br/>My girlfriend and I then met the buyer and we went over the purchase agreement. We aren't using any agents just us and the sellers. They seem like good folk and we're getting a killer price on the house.<br/><br/>After we signed the purchase agreement we (my best friend, my girlfriend, and I) headed to St. Paul to pack up and move my girlfriend. The seller was ok with us moving her stuff into the house once we had signed the purchase agreement.<br/><br/>The next two days consisted of putting stuff into boxes. We then had to wait half a day to get the rental truck. We decided to load it up that afternoon and then decided to get some sleep and leave at 6am so we could beat most of Chicago and holiday traffic.<br/><br/>The trip home was ok. My best friend is a saint since he drove the rental truck the entire way back, Chicago traffic and all!<br/><br/>The unloading went ok and now I'm in recovery mode.<br/><br/>Like the subject says, "Long, long week."<br/><br/>
