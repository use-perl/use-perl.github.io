<p>My stay at my girlfriend's just flew by, at least her broadband is working. The interesting bit was talking with the techs that came out and checked the cable modem/line. These dudes from AT&T are of the impression that the broadband is great but the customer service sucks (I thought they did a good job, I think they were talking about the call center folks). They also hinted at an impending problem with email. Some chagne coming that will piss of several 100K if not 1M people. Should be interesting to see if it comes to pass.<br/><br/>In any case I did have a pleasant visit.</p>

<h2>The Change</h2>

I know that today they're supposed to change the domain of lots of people's email.  Mine is changing from "mn.mediaone.net" to "att.bb" or something like that.  Perhaps that was the change they were referring to.
<p>
I'll still take cable over DSL any day. For me, it's a 3 for 1 deal - TV, TV Tuner, Cable modem.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

Maybe that's it. My girlfriend's domain is attbi.com, kinda weird if you ask me but no weirder than mine: insightbb.com<br> <br>As far as cable vs. dsl, I'd had both and like both. I was a DSL bigot for a bit but then I realized that any kind of broadband is good. It's rare for folks have a choice of both.<br> <br>If I had a choice I would probably go for cable since I've basically abandoned the traditional phone system for cell. The only probably is that I currently live in the Bermuda Triangle of Cell Phones. I can't get a signal on the phone unless I drive about 2 miles. I've been thinking hard about a passive repeater antenna for the house.
