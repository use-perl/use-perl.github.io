<p>Working at a small shop, 6 people total, can be...difficult.<br/><br/>Maybe I should go into how the company is setup. It's kind of like a law firm. There are partners and then there's the rest. My buddy is the president, however all the partners have an equal voice. The president is the tie breaker.<br/><br/>My position is just as a normal worker. I'm working towards being a partner. The thing is that no one has run a company before and it's learn as you go. My buddy has a lot of ideas, as do I but I just talk with my buddy about them. Since they're winging it there is no clear path to becoming a partner.<br/><br/>I'm trying to develop a Machiavellian level of patience because I have faith in the company and my buddy.<br/><br/>So what's this got to do with Perl? Very little other than trying not to be too snooty a programmer when my nominal boss wants a feature and I disagree on the implementation. I suggested a different way to do it which would encapsulate what he wanted and provided for a situtation that I wanted. He stated how he wanted it again and I caved.<br/><br/>Oh well, at least I get to code in Perl everyday and telecommute.</p>
