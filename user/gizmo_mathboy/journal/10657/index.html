<p>I attended a forum today where the central IT department let us know what they are up to and such.<br/><br/>Why is a university department more corporate than any corporation I've worked for? Lot's of bad powerpoint presentations. Lots and lots of corporate buzzwords:<br/><br/>CRM, ERP, J2EE, Enterprise this, Enterprise that, and of course, customers.<br/><br/>Ummm...I thought this was a uni? What about students, faculty, and staff? They all have differents needs and such.<br/><br/>Why is everyone moving to Java if even Sun is allegedly <a href="http://www.itworld.com/AppDev/716/030211sunjavadoubts/">not using it</a>? There has got to be something better than J2EE. Don't even talk .NET or whatever MS is calling it now (XDocs -> InfoPath, please).<br/><br/>Even better, to paraphrase the speaker:<br/><br/>"Why would we try to create the integrations and software if companies like GM can't even do it?"<br/><br/>How about because they make cars better than they make ideas? How about we a research institution that is suppose to come up with innovative ideas?<br/><br/>Why give all of that money to IBM, Oracle, and BEA?<br/><br/>When exactly did academia become the place to "not innovate"?<br/><br/>I would agree that it makes sense to use big name databases, maybe. I think it makes better sense to  standardize on a database and API's.<br/><br/>Fuck.<br/><br/>I really need a boot to the head, or maybe I should break into my "Holy Shit Armageddon's Coming" Kit.<br/><br/>Is this what all sysadmins go through their first year?</p>
