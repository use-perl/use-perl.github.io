<p>...isn't as easy a task as I thought it would be. Especially if you're doing it across tables.<br/><br/>My initial attempt really didn't work so well. Looking through the <a href="http://dbi.perl.org/index.html">Cheetah</a> I was thinking subqueries might be the way. Unfortunately MySQL has no such <a href="http://www.mysql.com/doc/T/O/TODO_MySQL_4.1.html">thing</a> just yet, at least in the stable version, 3.x, I'm using.<br/><br/>So I settled on using two searches (if needed). If two searches were needed then I took the intersection of the two sets, otherwise I just took the results from whatever search was performed.<br/><br/>I also had to put in a filter so that the results found were appropiate to the person viewing them. This is for a ticketing type of system so only customers should only be to see results pertinent to them or their customers.<br/><br/>Well, that was the biggest bit of coding today, basically rewriting code I wrote yesterday. You gotta love how the better idea comes to your after a user finds defects in it and you figure out to fix it.<br/><br/>Well, tomorrow is sort of a thinking day. I need to read some manuals and do some planning for a couple of other projects. Woo. Hoo. Beats being unemployed I suppose.</p>

<h2>MySQL</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/koschei/">koschei</a> on 2002-05-01T16:27:23</h3>
Why MySQL? I had to evaluate it for some project I did a few years ago and found it severely lacking at the time (it has improved now that it has transactions [kindof]).

I'm more familiar with MySQL. I have been planning to give PostGreSql a try when I have the time.<br> <br>I'll probably need to move to PostGres or something else if the traffice really picks up, but  MySQL does what I need to do and what it can't do I'm finding solutions.

way to use the free software. Oracle's nice, but the cost is so prohibitive for the little guy. I might have some search scripts laying around if you wanna look at it.

I'm running Apache and RedHat 7.2,too.<br> <br>I'm currently looking at Tomcat to see if a java servlet can run on it. I might have to use win2k for that since the company that created the servlet (and assoicated apps) is windows only. I would like to stay on Linux/Apache but I may have to move to win2k/Apache. I hope I won't have to go win2k/IIS.<br> <br>I think the biggest problem with the search script is that I'm potentially querying 2 tables. With no subqueries I had to make 2 queries and then merge them. Not that big a deal other than I should have thought of intersecting two sets than trying an SQL query I wasn't sure would work like I need it to work.<br> <br>I would be interested to look at the script if for no other reason to see if any ideas will get sparked.

Here are different examples of how to do a psudeo-subquery with MySQL.<br> <br><br/><br/># max_salary table to get the names of the<br>
# employees with the highest salary.<br>
#<br>
   SELECT employee_name<br>
   FROM employee, salary, max_salary<br>
   WHERE employee.employee_id = salary.employee_id<br> <br>
AND salary = max_salary<br><br/><br/>---------------------------------------------------------------<br> <br><br/><br/>SELECT employee_name<br>
FROM employee, salary<br>
WHERE employee.employee_id = salary.employee_id<br>
AND salary = (SELECT MAX(salary.salary) FROM<br> salary);<br> <br><br/><br/>----------------------------------------------------------------<br> <br><br/><br/>SELECT @salary:=MAX(salary.salary) FROM salary;<br>
UPDATE salary SET salary = salary *<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.75 WHERE<br> salary = @salary;<br> <br><br/><br/>You have to work around the IN.<br> <br>
I'm not really great at perl yet. But hopefully<br>you will be able to make use of<br>
the SQL<br> <br><br/><br/>Good luck<br>JeffK

Cool. Perl runs strong in me but SQL is weak. Maybe I can trade Perl knowledge for SQL.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)<br> <br>Know of any good SQL books? I suppose I should poke around the usenet archives, but I'm lazy and like to get recommendations before I spend money on an area I'm not so knowledgeable.

Bit OTT surely? No need to call me a jerk. Hmm. Or were you referring to that idiot who posted previous comments to other journal entries?<br> <br>I was merely asking after his reasons in using MySQL. It was only due to the mention of having trouble trying to do something that MySQL doesn't support and, as you noted, have to kludge around.<br> <br>fwiw, as gizmo noted: Postgres is also nice, and as free as MySQL. Hmm. And has solid transaction support =)<br> <br>I tried Oracle - ate my machine. Helps to have more than 128Mb RAM. And you definitely want connection pooling.

I'm really sorry if you thought I meant you.<br>
I was talking about the other guy you mentionned.<br><br/><br/>I agree about Postgres.  Everyone has there own<br> reasons for everytihng they use.  I mean<br> do people really like to use Word or do<br>they have to?<br><br/><br/>Again I'm sorry for the confusion.  What does<br>

It's cool. I was halfway through writing  a much too nasty reply and suddenly thought "hang on! this is gizmo's journal. it's got that weird guy." Not to worry.<br> <br>I've always assumed that people use Word because they either have to or that they don't know any better - or that anything better is too much effort. I mean, I praise LaTeX and TeX to the heavens. Wouldn't live without them. But there's one hell of a learning curve. Now TechWriter, on the other hand, that's a wonderful program. GUI based (not quite available on Windows though) and it pays attention to the structure of your document. You don't just mark a line in heading style, you make a new section, or chapter or whatever. The text of the section is part of the section, rather than just happening to follow a section heading.<br> <br>It's very sweet, but only available for RISC OS (or Windows under emulation).<br> <br>Same with databases: I assume people use MySQL mostly because they don't know/care about the benefits of other systems (I love transactions - can't live without them; not happy with the MySQL ones yet). And there are the people who still use flat files and non-(relational/oo) databases.<br> <br>Mind you, I have MySQL installed so as to play with Slash. When I get around to it (October 2005, I think) I may even look at really getting slash working on PostgreSQL.<br> <br>Anyway. that's my rant, and it may well also be OTT =)<br> <br>[That's "Over The Top" =) ]

<h2>temp tables</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/gav/">gav</a> on 2002-05-02T05:24:16</h3>
Have you tried creating a temporary table that has the columns you are searching for it it, that you update every day/hour/etc. You can get pretty good mileage out of such a technique.

Didn't really think about it. I'll keep it mind for future growth though. I'm guessing my double search kludge will work for some time (and I could try the SQL queries that JeffK posted).<br> <br>I really need to sit down and read some db books. I have "Database Design for Mere Mortals" which seems rather good so far as it is an intro for design. I not so sure what else I'll need to know other than learning via the school of hard knocks.
