<p>As a joke some friends got me a cut resistant glove for my birthday (I nearly sliced off a good chunk of the knuckle of my left thumb). They also had purchased a silicone oven mitt for me for Christmas.<br/><br/>Well, while I was preparing our early supper (late lunch?) I had placed a small pot of water in the oven (to help develop the crust of the baking bread). I had taken it out and left it on the stove.<br/><br/>I set the bread to cool and was getting ready to prepare some steaks. In order to do that I needed to do something with the pan of hot water on the stovetop. Did I mention that it was in a 450 degree Fahrenheit oven just a few short minutes ago?<br/><br/>Needless to write I become quite aware how hot is was. Thank goodness the tap water was hand numbingly cold. I was worried that it would be a second degree burn. As it turns out, about 8 hours later, it should only be a very painful first degree burn.<br/><br/>The irony here is that I take a lot of pride in my cooking (and my technique) and in the span of about 6 months:<br/><br/>- put a deep cut in the knuckle of my left thumb<br/><br/>- did a good job of grating the knuckle of my right thumb (guess I needed a matched set)<br/><br/>- tried to burn the palm of my right hand<br/><br/>At least I'm not repeating my mistakes.</p>

...I once decided, for some reason I still do not quite understand, that cutting a large Tootsie Roll was best done with a nice sharp razor blade.  Tootsie Rolls are a bit greasy, so when I attempted a gentle tug to get the blade unstuck I slid right out of the Tootsie Roll and whacked a huge deep gash in 3 of my fingertips on my left hand.
<p>
This was years ago, but it was sufficiently deep that a thick, obvious scar lays across the middle fingerprint, and two less obvious ones match the arc if I curl my fingers properly.  It's really quite embarrassing, considering that I can't explain why I was cutting Tootsie Rolls with razors in the first place.</p>



<h2>A book you should read</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/VSarkiss/">VSarkiss</a> on 2004-02-09T15:17:12</h3>
<p>Is Anthony Bourdain's <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?isbn=0060934913" title="barnesandnoble.com">
Kitchen Confidential</a barnesandnoble.com>.  According to him, professional cooks take pride in all their "war wounds".</p>
<p>It's a pretty good book overall: pretty funny in places, although it may make you think twice about eating in restaurants.</p>



<h2>It's a bad week</h2>

if I don't get at least 5 cuts on my fingers doing kitchen work.<p>
I keep all my knives razorsharp, so the cuts are nice and clean and heal quickly. The worst was one day when my hand slipped while useing the 'mandolin': a nice row of gashes with 3.5 mm separation over back of 4 fingers, between 2nd and 3rd knucles - ouch.</p><p>
Just as only nonproductive programmers don't make mistakes, only non-chefs dont get cut or burnt - but it still hurts though.</p>

Ouch! I thought grating my thumb would hurt. I couldn't imagine what running my hand over a mandolin would do.<br> <br>I would hate to think how many cuts I would get if I was a line cook. Then again my technique and speed would improve or I would start losing fingers.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)
