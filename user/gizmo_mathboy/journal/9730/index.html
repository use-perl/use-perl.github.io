<p>Where did my vacation go? Time really does fly.<br/><br/>Have a fun but long New Year's Eve. Was up around 8am getting things ready, to be honest my girl friend was a gigantic help.<br/><br/>We had a fun time with friends watching our team win its bowl game. After that it was eatin, drinking, and having a New Year's smoke (good cigars and pipe tobacco) until 2am.<br/><br/>New Year's Day was just a big breakfast of french toast, bacon, and sausage. I then started watching whatever movies were on and eventually drifted off to a 3 hour afternoon nap.<br/><br/>Of course today was fun. Went into work and it was just overcast, by noon we had about 4 inches of snow (10 cm for the rest of the world). By the time I returned how we had around 6-8 inches (15-20 cm :-)<br/><br/>Not bad all in all since the house was warm and got the new issue of Linux Magazine to read.</p>
