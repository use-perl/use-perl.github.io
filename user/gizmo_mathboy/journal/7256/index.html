<p>I will have been at my job 5 weeks this Friday (the 23rd). I basically the sysadmin/front line (aka site specialist) help desk for a department at a university. If I need somethinge done (create an account, install some software, etc.) I have to send a request into our problem queue. I understand the need to have a policy to wait awhile to make sure I can use the power of root wisely.<br/><br/>I don't understand why they can't give me just a little power. I don't need full-on root, I just need enough to install software on the damned win2k boxes in my labs and faculty offices! Is that too much to ask for?<br/><br/>My coworkers (fellow site specialists) tell me to enjoy these days that I can push off work onto others. The only problem is that school started this week (Monday) and I need to get stuff done and the folks that can help me are busy doing stuff they need done yesterday.<br/><br/>Maybe it's just my sick work ethic that wants to get things done now.<br/><br/>Okay, enough ranting (for now). I just hate having to pick up the mess that my predecessor left, trying to figure out how to do my job, and get things done all at the same time.</p>
