<p>Well, my Wustof knife works too well. I tried taking a chunk of my left thumb knuckle off. It looked liked a deep cut so my fiancee drove me to the urgent care facility and I received 6 stitches and a tetanus shot.<br/><br/>It could have been a worse injury. I can still type and that's a good thing for a sysadmin. I may have to limit my lifting and carrying of monitors and cases for a few days though.<br/><br/>I was really looking forward to the jambalaya I was making before I interrupted the preparation with a laceration.<br/><br/>So, I guess the moral of the story is: focus on good knife skills when you have a knife capable of taking your fingers off.<br/><br/>PS: The knife went through me fast enough that it didn't get any blood on it. Cool. Scary, too.</p>

<h2>Same thing happened to my wife...</h2>

Except the knife went to the bone on her thumb. Partially severed a tendon &amp; completely cut a nerve. We thought she might have to have surgery to fix the tendon if it broke. It wasn't her fault (stupid culinary school classmates...), but she still ended up w/ about 12 stiches. Luckily it all healed nicely with no long-term severe effects, but she still can't feel a small part of her thumb.
<p>
Glad your's wasn't as bad.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>



<h2>Scars</h2>

I had a similar experience, only much more humiliating considering it was with a single-edged razor blade and I was cutting a Tootsie Roll.
<p>
When the blade slipped, it cut an arc through three finger pads.  I count myself very lucky that I didn't press harder, because I was very close to cutting to the bone.  Even though I was too stupid to get stitches, I was lucky enough again to have my cuts heal up with minor scarring.
</p><p>
I'm considering trying to get rid of the scars, though.</p>



<h2>Limes</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/mako132/">mako132</a> on 2003-06-13T15:15:52</h3>
Got real drunk at a party.  Need a lime for my tequila shot and since the guy tending the bar (dorm room party) wasn't paying attention, I reached over, grabbed a cheap steak knife and it slipped as it tried to cut the lime.  Spurted blood all over the table, but was so drunk that I was more embarrased than horrified.<br> <br>Ended up stumbling up the street to the infirmary a couple of miles away, feeling stupid.  Probably the worst part was that I making good progress with a particular lady<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...<br> <br>It would never have worked anyway...<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)
