<p>The latest Hollywood version really sucked. I have so far liked  the movies that Guy Pearce has down that I have seen (_L.A. Confidential_ and _Memento_). This however is an awful hollywood-ization. I would have to agree with Mr. Filthy's <a href="http://www.bigempire.com/filthy/countofmontecristo.html">review</a> of it. I tend to agree with his appraisal that Hollywood seems to be full of grass fuckers (a new bit of crassness added to my patois :-)<br/><br/>As a result I've started reading M. Dumas' work. Fortunately the Gutenberg Project has it. I'm barely into the first chapter and I like it much more than the movie.<br/><br/>What really bugs me is that without even having read the book I came to the conclusion it was a poor adaptation of the novel. I think Peter Jackson's work with LOTR has spoiled me. I know that movies are different from books but I also know that one could take a good novel and make it into a good film.<br/><br/>Well, enough ranting and procrastination. I have to get Apache and MySQL working properly on my win2k box and laptop so I can get some work done.</p>

<br>
<br>Yeah, his acting seems to have improved a tad from when he played 'Mike' in that Aussie SOAP 'Neighbours' back in the day<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)



<h2>Dumas is a favourite of mine</h2>

<p>The book rules and I couldn't bear to go see the movie after hearing the director also did Waterworld.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) grass fucker...hee</p>
