<div class="span8">
<p>After nearly 3 weeks of frenzied contacts with
recruiters, a phone interview, and a repeatedly
rescheduled phone interview, all my job prospects
in Colorado, Kansas, Missouri, and upstate New York
have vanished down the drain. I am guessing that
the process will begin again next week.<br/><br/>I really feel stupid for leaving my Kansas City job
in June 2001 to move back to Colorado. I should have
known the layoffs would start happening in Colorado
right as I arrived, and that my interviews would
end up being cancelled. I should probably never have
taken the KC job in the first place.</p>

I know how you feel. My last paid work day was Sep 20, which included my mandatory 2 weeks pay, so I was technically unemployed longer.
<p>
In all that time I've had 3 interviews. I would have gotten the first, but management restricted new hires. The second I didn't have experience in the right area. And the third was an academic position and I just couldn't live on the money it offered.
</p><p>
Keep your chin up. Never stop reading and learning. And don't give up. If you have lots of time, find a project (personal or open source) to contribute to. Keeping busy &amp; productive is essential (speaking from experience).</p>
