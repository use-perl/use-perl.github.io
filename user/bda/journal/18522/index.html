<h1>User admin modules</h1>

<div class="span8">
<p>Recently I've started getting more and more into automating tasks I do at work. Part of this is relates around some ideas I've had about shell use and ssh key generation, distribution, and keyhost networks.<br/><br/>I also recently started doing administration work for a free shell box service (metawire.org) and we need a nice way to distribute user accounts across some new machines we're getting in the next week or so.<br/><br/>So to implement the above, I need some way to easily manipulate user and group accounts on various flavors of UNIX. "Well," says I, I says, "I'll just check out CPAN. Surely, it being CPAN, which is for Perl, there will be many modules already written to deal with this stuff, since it much be such a common requirement."<br/><br/>My searching skills are either woefully pathetic, or there just isn't a nice generic module for dealing with user administration.<br/><br/>So I think, "Well, that's ok, I'll just start a nice generic module, write the OS-specific stuff I need, and other people can add stuff. Shouldn't be too hard."<br/><br/>So I look around some more, and discover and mdxi refers to as "one of the most spectacular abuses of CPAN and it's top-level namespace ever."<br/><br/>What the shizzy, yo: 
http://search.cpan.org/user/tbone/User-1.6/User.pm<br/><br/>That is 16 lines of code. I'm still pretty pissed about this.<br/><br/>So I suppose I'll just use "User::Accounts" or something along those lines. But really. What the hell?<br/><br/>rjbs pointed this out to me:
http://search.cpan.org/user/vidul/Linux-usermod-0.3/usermod.pm<br/><br/>Seems okay for what it does, but not what I need, really.<br/><br/>So, whinging aside: Am I totally missing something incredibly obvious? It astounds me that there isn't a generic user admin package written, so I'm pretty sure I must just be being completely blind here.</p>

I'm not sure what else you have in mind... but, I'd probably start with this:<br> <br>http://search.cpan.org/user/drolsky/Net-SSH-Perl-1.25/lib/Net/SSH/Perl.pm<br> <br>And try real hard to simply use the commands already available on each platform to do the rest.

<h2>poor top level name</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jmm/">jmm</a> on 2004-04-28T13:31:45</h3>
I'd say that "user" would not be a good top level name here, actually.  I'd suggest instead Admin::User, which would easily expand into supporting all sorts of other admin tasks under the same top level hierarchy.  (However, it looks like you're not going to have to create a new name after all, so this point is moot.)



<h2>Solaris</h2>

Don't forget about NIS/NIS+.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)

<i>My searching skills are either woefully pathetic, or there just isn't a nice generic module for dealing with user administration.</i>
<p>
As a related followup to my own message....
</p><p>
That's because there isn't a nice, generic API for *nix systems when it comes to adding, configuring and deleting users and groups.  It's a PITA.
</p><p>
Doable, though.</p>

I'm not a big fan of NIS[+] so I probably won't ever write that.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br/><br/>But I've gotten so far as to hack Unix::PasswdFile into Unix::ShadowFile. Unix::MasterPasswdFile (BSD) should be finished by tomorrow, and I can start working on the User::Account or Admin::User modules. Namespace issues need to be resolved, definitely.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br/><br/>Pretty simple stuff, but neat.<br/><br/>Eventually the goal is to use something like Stem for inter-system messaging to pass out the files, etc.

That's cool - I noticed the lack of shadow file handling in Unix::PasswdFile, so I was a little scared off and tempted to just use the Solaris specific one.
