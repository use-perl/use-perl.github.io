<p>I decided to start blogging again. And I'm starting a fresh new blog at <a href="http://ilyamart.blogspot.com/">http://ilyamart.blogspot.com</a>. See you there.</p>

<p>For me, the value of <i>use Perl</i> is that it has everyone in one place. I see everything that gets posted here (and read most of it); if you happen to write here, I&#8217;ll read you. In contrast, for me to specifically subscribe to any single-person weblog in particular, it has to meet a much higher interest bar than the <i>use Perl</i> community as a whole. So I very rarely follow people out of here, even if I used to read them while they were here.</p>

<p>I know this is true of others too. To walk away from here means to leave the fold of those who follow <i>use Perl</i> at large.</p>

<p>Part of the issue is that by the time people announce their departure, they have usually written too little in the new place for me to gauge my interest. Assuming this generalises to other people, that would mean you may want to post another remind a while from now, once there is a bit of content in your new space.</p>

<p>Anyway, best wishes and good luck in the future.<nobr> <wbr></nobr><tt>:-)</tt> Hope the new weblog works out better than this journal for you.</p>

<p>There is an advantage to a domain specific set of journals, I agree it's a shame to see people leave to their own unique spot. I know you can use an aggregator to join the RSS feeds together but it's more effort than a one stop shop like use.Perl.</p>

I understand what you mean. Majority of blogs I read regularly are probably on use.perl for the same reason: they are in the same place. I played with RSS in the past but gave up for some reason.
<p>
Yet frankly if I stay on use.perl.org I would just not write anything<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;) I'm lazy and with blogspot I have less excuses not to write. For example one thing I started doing is writing future blog post ideas as drafts. Sometimes I get some idea to write about and in the past I'd just forget about it because I don't have time to write it immediately. Now I just login to blogspot and create new draft post with brief outline of the topic.
</p><p>
And UI is just nicer. It is not like I want fancy formating often but still I like not be forced to use HTML every time I want more then one paragraph in the post. Not to mention they with my new found hobby, photography, I want to publish pictures on the blog.
</p><p>
One final thought: most of blogs I read this days is not something I read regularly but is something I can find on google or via web surfing. I do hope that I write enough interesting content to win occasional visitors.</p>

<p><div class="quote">And UI is just nicer.</div> There's at least two people that I know of, that post the same entries both here and on their own private blog. As I understand it, they write it for the other blog and then use a custom script to post the same content on use.perl.org.
<p>It's obvious you prefer the other interface by far &mdash; and if you feel that way, then you are obviously right.
</p><p>So my idea is: write (or port) a little Perl script that can be used to crosspost your blog entries both on your own site, and here? That actually sounds like a fun little project.
</p><p>p.s. how do people feel about posting non-Perl stuff here? I personally like that, but I can't shake the feeling that a fear for posting non-Perl (AKA "off-topic") stuff here is a reason for some people, to start up their own blog elsewhere &mdash; and lose their audience by doing so.</p>

Sorry mate, but I won't be seeing you there.<br><br>I only look at the Recent Posts thing on use.perl for posts, I tend to not see everyone else's posts.<br>
