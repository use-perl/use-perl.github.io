<p>I'm going to get an answer for this question very soon. Today my father called me and asked me if office software for Linux supports Russian and if I can help him install Linux on several computers in his office (he runs his own small bisness). Turned out he wants to stop using pirated Windows and MS Office, get a couple of licenses for them, install legal copies on a couple of computers and convert the rest into Linux as he just cannot afford getting legal Windows and MS Office for all computers in his office.
<p>
He has two guys who know computers a bit and who have very little Unix knoledge as his company web server runs on FreeBSD (built by me) but in reallity they need Linux distro with very simple installation and <i>decent</i> localization. I don't think they can support and use anything else. Sadly it rules out my favorite distro - Debian and any other non-Russian Linux distros. I'm going to give <a href="http://www.asplinux.ru/en/">ASPLinux</a> a try. Seems they have done a lot of work with getting nicely localized Russian distro. They do localizations for many popular software they bundle and in general they try to make desktop enviroment that doesn't suck for Russian speaking users.</p>
