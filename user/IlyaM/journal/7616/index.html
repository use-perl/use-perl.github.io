<p>How do you write your CV? When I decided to write mine I used google to find some examples and than I wrote it borring some ideas from these examples. But I didn't copied any bits from them as it is.
<p>
Today I reviewed all resumes our company have recieved for opened Perl developer vacancy and while reading one of them I got 'deja vu' filling. Than I relized that is looks like mine! It has similar format and some wording in it is precisely like in old version of mine <a href="http://martynov.org/cv/">CV</a>. He-he-he, I guess that guy have never thought that I will read his CV :)
<p>
On the other hand I don't think there is anything bad with it. Just funny.</p>

<b>2Ilya:</b> huh... you've got me, I'm the guy which used your CV<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) since your CV looked much prettier that mine<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) But I've never seen your old resume for sure, and compiled one of your current sentences to suit my needs as soon as I got no section 'some words about me' in my resume and needed to get it ready asap. I realized that I've used YOUR resume in the day of interview, darn it was too late, hope you don't mind, deja-vu as you've already said<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
<br> <br>
<b>2All</b>: hope you'll never get in such a stupid situation<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
