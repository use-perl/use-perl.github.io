<p>I've met one problem several time before but
I've been able to workaround it in
different ways. The problem is that
I want mail agent I use (i.e Gnus) to use different
identities when I talk via email with different
people. Today I faced this problem again.
This time I decided to find real solution.
<p>
First try was using gnus variable
gnus-posting-styles which description I have
found in Gnus manual. I played a bit with it
but I could not get it switch identity according
mail headers. So I've tried to find example
of it's usage with google. Instead of example
I found this elisp file:
<a href="http://www.comsecmilnavpac.net/elisp/">gnus-pers.el</a>.
It allows to define any number of identities and switch them
any time. Of course identity can be automatically
chosen according mail headers. Cool!
<p>
But google helped me one more time. Guy who wrote that elisp
file uses xemacs so his code uses some xemacs specific
functions (like replace-in-string). But thanks to google
I've found another elisp file which implements missing
functions for GNU emacs (which I use):
<a href="http://www.dotemacs.de/emacro/emacs/functions.html">functions.el</a>.</p>

True, but like anybody else, they're susceptible to certain forms of <a href="http://www.dailyrotten.com/articles/archive/290725.html" title="dailyrotten.com">abuse</a dailyrotten.com>.  A more cynical person might even infer that some sort of payment/pressure was applied, but I wouldn't go that far.  Scientology's got enough money to buy its way in, instead of buying someone inside.
