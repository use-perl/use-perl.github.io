<p><p><i>(I posted this on Perl Monks, but thought someone here might be able to point me in the right direction as well...)</i></p>

Hola Monkly Ones,

<p>I've been struggling with this all day and now I must ask for your help...</p>

<h3>The Victim:</h3>
Mac OS X 10.4.1
       <ul><li>Perl 5.8.6</li>
           <li>MCPAN which was working previously and had installed many modules quite happily, now seems to be fubar'ed and glares menacingly at me</li>
           <li>Can't install anything using MCPAN, fink or manually</li></ul>

<h3>Crime Scene:</h3>
<p> I thought I was only having trouble starting Catalyst so I tried to reinstall. MCPAN goes on a killing spree and tries to download half of CPAN. Many of the modules it says are missing I know for a fact are there (esp. since I already had Catalyst installed and running before).</p>

<p>After watching thousands of lines running by I found this sprinkled throughout:</p>

<p><code>
make: *** No rule to make target `/System/Library/Perl/5.8.6/darwin-thread-multi-2level/CORE/config.h', needed by `Makefile'.  Stop.
  /usr/bin/make  -- NOT OK
Running make test
  Can't test without successful make
Running make install
  make had returned bad status, install seems impossible
</code></p>

<p>(why it doesn't stop trying after the first failure is a mystery to me... )</p>

<p>
<code>cpan> o conf</code> returns <code>/usr/bin/make</code><br/>
but I tried <code>perl -MCPAN -e shell CPAN> o conf make /usr/bin/make</code> anyway, nothing changed.
</p>

<ul>
<li>Xcode installed (tried reinstalling twice today)</li>
<li>reinstalled gcc twice</li>
<li>Found a very similar problem in <a href="http://www.cpanforum.com/threads/502">this thread</a> and many others, but nothing they did has worked for me.</li>
</ul>

<p>If anyone could talk me off the ledge it would be greatly appreciated as I mostly try to make pretty pictures and avoid the sticky guts of the filesystem if at all possible. (blaaarrrrgghhhh!)</p>
