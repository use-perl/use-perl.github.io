<p><p>Speaking of the new job... For _whatever_ reason they seem to think I'm organized enough to handle scheduling and tracking the job orders so, starting tomorrow I'll be doing that in addition to production stuff.</p>
<p>Now this has caused my wife no shortage of giggling since one of her favorite sayings is that I "can't organize a piss-up in a brewery." I hope I don't prove her right.; )</p>
<p>Unfortunately for me, I haven't been there long enough to see a job go from initial request to delivery yet and the person I'm taking over from never quite found the time to actually train me for all of the hidden aspects of the position. It seems that quite a few of the projects have implied procedures that aren't necessarily spelled out on the work orders (for example, some client work is always bid out to different printers, others are always produced in-house with the digital printers, but if there is any kind of official company document that outlines all of this I've not seen hide nor hair...</p>
<p>Looks like I'm going to be winging it for a little while.</p></p>
