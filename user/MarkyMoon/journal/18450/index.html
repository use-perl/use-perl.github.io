<p><p>I think installing Fink has screwed my iMac royally. Recently I haven't been able to run Illustrator or Quark on my new computer. Since I do graphic design this is _NOT_ a trivial matter. The added complication of being unemployed means I can't afford to upgrade to newer (OS X) versions of either program. I can't figure out why they won't run, so I starting trying to work backwards to figure out what big system change I've made that might have caused the problem.</p><p>Lo and behold, from looking at my logs and file modification dates it seems that the last time either worked was immediately prior to installing Fink. Farging bastoid!</p><p>Shout it from the mountaintops... <b>F#@! Fink!!!!</b></p></p>

<h2>No problems with fink here!</h2>

Bychance, did you install it only in<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/sw, as recommended, or did you try to push things out in protected space (/usr/local, and elsewhere)?
<p>
But just as a datapoint, I've been using fink since within a week or so of upgrading to OSX 10.1, and have had no problems.</p>

<p>Nope... It's in<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/sw. I was actually hoping I'd done something to cause the problem but it's right where it should be.</p>
