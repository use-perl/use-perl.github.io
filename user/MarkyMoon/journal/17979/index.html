<p><p>Started rewriting a site that I originally created back in '98-99. It's not active anymore and is only archived on my portfolio site, but I figure I have the time (unfortunately) so why not clean it up. I don't know... maybe it's "cheating" to bring an old project up to today's coding standards. &lt;rationalize&gt;On the other hand a portfolio is also to show what you can do now.&lt;/rationalize&gt; But fsck it, I need a job!</p><p> I'm also worried that although the site looks good, it's full of the kind of crap that you had to do back in the 4.0 browser days to get things to look the way you wanted. Anyone viewing the source code now would probably be unimpressed. Invisible pixel tricks, evil javascript and yes... even frames I'm ashamed to say! But I know better now. XHTML, CSS and Perl for it's resurrection.</p>

<p> It had a big portfolio with lots of images and about 8 zillion pages which I'm now going recreate using CGI.pm. I knew nothing of this thing called Perl back then. It would have been so much easier to make/update. Thank you Larry and Lincoln <i>wherever</i> you are!</p>

<p>...Igor bring me that hammer... and a Rolling Rock!</p></p>

<h2>You have probably thought of this...</h2>

but, just in case you haven't.<br> <br>I would make sure to leave the previous version up and make a page that uses a frame with a menu to allow someone to switch between the old and new versions for comparison.<br> <br>Some people may be looking specifically for someone who can move a site with old code to the present. And this would show that skill.<br> <br>Of course... the frame part is just an example... I'm sure that you'll figure out a way to drop the frame part of the idea.<br> <br>;-)

<p>Actually, I hadn't thought of that. That's a good idea and I'll make sure to do that. I was so concerned about the things that bug me about it, all I wanted to do was fix it and get rid of the old one. Tunnel vision I guess.</p>

<p>Thanks for the suggestion.<br>MarkyMoon</p>
