<p><p>I started my new job yesterday and it seems like a nice place. Nobody's mad. No one is paranoid about losing their job and everybody is really friendly. A nice change from my last full time job. Of course I can't tell you about that job, because most of you don't know me well enough yet. You'd recoil in horror at the gory details and shun me in polite society. Those who know have been sworn to secrecy, so you'll just have to wait for the book.</p>
<p>Tuesday (the day before I started the new job) one of the other jobs I was really interested in called me back for an interview, which I'm going to investigate. It's funny, a week and a half ago I really didn't know _what_ I was going to do. I was even considering going back into machining and I cannot put into words just how much I HATE machining. More than Windows... more than Dubya... dare I say, more than the time I got Mr. Winkie caught in my zipper as a youngster! I'd even dug out my CNC programming books in desperation.</p><p> It's nice to have some options.</p></p>

<i>You'd recoil in horror at the gory details and shun me in polite society.</i> <br> <br>OK... before I read the second paragraph... I figured you got a job programming on Windows.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)<br> <br>About the only thing worse, in my book, is writing code for spammers... on Windows.<br> <br>I shudder just thinking about it.

My guess is SCO.

<p>Either of those admittidly vile careers would actually still be preferable to the evil job I used to have.</p>
<p>Although I do have to work on Windows (yeesh!), this new job/project is converting several technical manuals from Broadvision QuickSilver to Adobe FrameMaker. QuickSilver (which I had never even heard of before) is a really strange program that can't seem to decide if it's a publishing system or semi-operating system. Not very intuitive at all, but I'm starting to get my head around the weirdness.</p>
<p>The <b>selected parts</b> of the user manual that they gave me is about the same size as the Camel book... I'm glad they didn't give me the whole thing.</p>
