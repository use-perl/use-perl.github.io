<div class="span8">
<p><p>After months of throwing resumes into what was starting to resemble a black hole, I've finally landed a new job! Actually it's a contract gig that could possibly turn into a full time position, which is just fine with me.</p>

<p>The interview was 2 weeks ago but I hadn't heard anything back and was about to write it off. But I called them yesterday to find out if they had made a decision. The HR person said that they hadn't made up their minds but that I was still in the running. It turns out that about a 1/2 hour after I called they had a new project that they could definitely use me on. So I hope I can impress them enough to get in permanently.</p>

<p> The funny thing is, when I interviewed the HR that I was supposed to meet with had called off so they had me interview with the lead programmer and lead graphic designer on the project with the opening. I preferred this since I never graduated from college (I know... my bad!) and sometimes I think that HR interviews work against me not having a degree. The fact that I'm trying to tunnel my way out of print into web development/backend stuff doesn't help me either since very little of my prior (non-freelance) experience is in this area.</p>

<p>This time however, I had the chance to answer specific questions from the people I would be working for, which is much better than generic HR questions anyday -- " Why do you want to work here?" when the obvious answer is " I have a nasty food-beer-lodging habit to support" which is <b>almost never</b> the answer they're looking for.</p>

<p>The feeling of relief after all this time (14 months) is amazing!</p></p>
