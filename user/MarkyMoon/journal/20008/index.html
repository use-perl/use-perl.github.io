<p><p>Them: Here are about 350 PDFs from the customer that we want linked into one big PDF and change the version info.</p>

<p>(5 minutes later)</p>

<p>Me: There's a slight problem... These all have a security signature on them.</p>

<p>Them: (blank look)... So what's the problem?</p>

<p>Me: Well, it means I can open them and print them but I can't link them or edit them. Can we get the files without the  "security" on them or at least get the password to unlock them?</p>

<p>Them: This is proprietary information and they are very concerned about security over there, plus we don't want to bother them too much.</p>

<p>Me: Well, what do you want me to with them then?</p>

<p>Them: Print them all out, resize them all to the same dimensions, scan them in, edit them, turn them back into PDFs and then link them. Oh yeah, we don't have very much time in the quote for the actual production, so you'd better get cracking.</p>

<p>Me: So in the name of security you want me to take this "proprietary and very important info" make paper copies (which we don't shred), scans, and more digital versions, none of which they now have any control of and then make the big PDF?</p>

<p>Them: Yeah... what's the problem?</p>

<p>Me: You're kidding right?</p>

<p>Them: (Another blank stare)</p></p>

I wonder if a Mac's 'Print to PDF' function
turns off the security or passes it along?

A mac, or any other system w/ CUPS on it.<br> <br>Set up a CUPS postscript que... "print" the jobs, which will create a postscript file (with no locks) then use your favorite tool to <a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/user/ghost/doc/cvs/Ps2pdf.htm" title="wisc.edu">convert the ps file to pdf</a wisc.edu>.<br> <br>Hm... you can probably just set up a postscript printer in any OS and then "print to file" to get your postscript file. But, there may be some OS code to make Adobe happy that prevents that.<br> <br>But... I'm quite certain that CUPS will let you do it.

<p>That was one of the first things I tried (although at work I tragically have to use Winblows... and yes, I do feel... <b>unclean</b>... I'd sucessfully managed not to touch Win for about 5 years other than trying to remove spyware from my dad's computer) but the security settings in the document don't allow you to print to a file either.</p> <p>Our I.T. guy installed a bit of naughtiness that had it's way with a couple of the files but it corrupted some that is was able to unlock when we tested it, so I stashed that away for future experiments. Plus, since it was a "demo" it would open only the first page of the multi-page files and I was pretty sure they weren't going to cough up dough for an "anti-security" tool<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)</p>

<p>Fortunately, after a short conference call with the person in charge of Document Control for the custie, who proved to be more than reasonable and started sending the files as fast as he could gather them. The most sensible person I dealt with during this 2 1/2 day debacle.</p>

<p>I'll have to try out the suggested CUPS solution on my own, but for now I'm just glad it's over. I still can't believe the resistance to just talk to the customer though. Starting to think about updating my resume already after only 2 1/2 months. A very short honeymoon.</p>
