<p>The first yapc day is always a little bit tiring, I usually sit around talking to people and hacking a little bit of code here and there. This time I've been working on B::Deparse, and more specifically what I was on about in earlier journals.  Robin and I spent some time looking at what is coming out of the test.deparse and had a chat about saving the order of BEGINs, the conclusion being that it is confusing, and we don't know what to do about it.  Perhaps we need to tell perl to save the order.<br/><br/>Marty was good enough to lend me his power cable for his laptop so I restored power briefly while I made a couple of patches, but once again I am powerless (writing this from the computer lab). In general everybody seems to be having a pretty good time and talking freely, which is always nice to see.  <br/><br/>I wish I had a wireless LAN card and then I would write far more, but then again, I wish I had a laptop with a US KEYBOARD because I can't figure out these UK ones.<br/><br/>Tomorrow I'm doing my lightning talk, 12 slides in 4 minutes and 30 seconds, timed.  I'm trying to decide in my head whether or not I should use the projector or not, I figure I may annoy less people if I don't.  <br/><br/>Anyway, its the speakers dinner tonight, and I'm sure that will generate plenty to talk about.  More later...<br/><br/>Oh, if you're reading, Hi Katrien!<br/><br/></p>
