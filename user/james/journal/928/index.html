<p>I'm going to Bilboa on Friday to visit my Father.  On Friday of last week I used <A HREF="http://www.ebookers.com">ebookers</a> to book my flight, however something seemed to go wrong at the end and I didn't think I'd done anything.  Ebookers didn't send me any confirmation so I thought I'd try with another system (namely, <a href="http://www.gofly.com">Go</a>, who I have had great success with in the past).  I booked my flight with Go on Monday, all successful.  Today (tuesday) I got an email confirmation from ebookers confirming the booking that I thought I'd not made.  Woobah!<br/><br/>I called Go to change the booking, but because of the two flights going on my credit card, I don't have the cash on the card to pay the upgrade fee.  Needless to say all this is causing me a degree of agrivation.<br/><br/>What is this internet thing useful for anyway?<br/><br/>The really sad thing is that I wrote lots of the software that runs ebookers.<br/><br/>In addition to this hassle, I've got hassle of the other kind (Real Estate agents).  They are bothering me again to sign a bit of paper stating when I'm going to move out of my flat - I only just moved in! Jeesh.<br/><br/>However, good news is required, and that is that I've got the use cases all done.  They just need a little more polishing...</p>
