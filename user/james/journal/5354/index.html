<p>This week has been incredibly unproductive.  Monday was my birthday, and I took a day off, so I suppose I can give myself that one, but the rest of the week has been crazy.<br/><br/>Next week I'm going to Amsterdam to give a talk to the Canon W4 group, which is sort of Canon's European internet strategy group.  Its good to be going, representing Fotango, but at the same time I've been dashing around our office all week trying to drum up facts, figures and all that other stuff.<br/><br/>Friday was good.  I was working for home (a little bit of peace in the storm).  ADSL got switched on which is really cool because now I can carry my laptop into the kitchen and still have broadband internet access (broadband + wireless = very cool indeed).  The world cup started, and I watched France slump to a 0-1 defeat at the hands of their former colony Senagal.  It was a good match really, and the Senagalese impressed.<br/><br/>Ireland drew 1-1 this morning which is good news, because it proves they can do well without Roy Keane.  Now Denmark are at  the top of group A (well, tied with Senegal at least)<br/><br/>Ah well, just have to keep my fingers crossed for England vs. Sweeden tomorrow.<br/><br/>pdcawley <a href="/user/pdcawley/journal/">summed up</a> Pixie very well yesterday, and this is good.  Its near a releasable state AFA functionality.  Lots of documentation and tests to write, but thats okay.  Of course where I will find time to do this I do not know.<br/><br/>My todo is (in no particular order):
<li>Real (paying) work</li>
<li>OpenFrame 3</li>
<li>A beginners guide to Pixie</li>
<li>Tech review of <i>Programming Web Services with Perl</i></li>
<li>Pipeline 2</li><br/><br/>ENOTENOUGHTUITS</p>
