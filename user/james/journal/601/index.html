<p>Last night I ate dinner and then found myself far too tired to do anything, so I went home to bed.  I woke up this morning feeling like I'd been run over by one of the trams that rattle around this city.<br/><br/>I'm not sure why, but sooner or later I'm sure I'll wake up.<br/><br/>Greg's 'Stone Soup' talk was quite humorous, given the lack of preparation that was both evident and described :-)  He talked about using safe to generate heuristics for the mechanism, Pierre suggested using SOAP for the Heuristics, which would mean that the code would run on someone elses machine, and the worst they could do is bugger up the begger objects (this I suppose could be tested for).<br/><br/>I've put together a module to do run time type checking on methods : should be available pretty soon, Marty is going to be pulling it off the laptop later with wireless, provided we can get it configured and running (which should be no small task).<br/><br/>I think I'm going to hang around now doing nothing much until the afternoon.  Write some code really... although I think I've written more interesting code here than I have done in a long time, and I don't want to waste it :-)<br/><br/>Back to London tonight, I can't say I'm not looking forward to going home.  Not because the conference isn't fun: au contraire, just because I'd like to sleep in my own bed, rather than at the dodginess of the Princess Hotel.  From the frequency of which the planes roar over the conference location, I figure the airport isn't that far away.<br/><br/>More later... (maybe :-)</p>
