<p>Well, back from Belgium.  I am quite proud of myself, as I understood at least 15% of what was being said to me, and that is a significant improvement over last time.  Katrien's nephew is just starting to speak, and I think he figured me out, as he started teaching me words as he learnt them :-)<br/><br/>We went to Ypres, which was quite moving.  I figured it would be before hand, but I wasn't aware of <i>how much</i> I would be affected.  In the Tyne Cot cemetary alone there are 11,500 graves and it is quite something to see.<br/><br/>In more perl related updates I've got the start of a Perl to Parrot translation engine going.  It can only handle the most basic of constructs at the moment, but its a start.  Right now it is messy, but if people want to look its the 'ripple' module in the CVS repository located at:<br/><br/><i>:pserver:anonymous@openframe.fotango.com:/var/repository</i><br/><br/>It will handle assignment of constants to scalars,  but anything else is beyond my time allowence for now unfortunatly.  The Project (insert drumroll here) is creeking ever closer to its end, and panic stations will be setting in soon no doubt...<br/><br/>

We went to a lot of the battlefields &amp; cemetaries.  Going to the Menin Gate at night and hearing the 'Last Post' was quite moving as I recall.

<i> Going to the Menin Gate at night and hearing the 'Last Post' was quite moving as I recall.</i> <br> <br>Its a pity because we couldn't stay until 8pm.  We went to the Menin Gate and found my relatives, and that was hard enough.  In some ways I don't honestly know if I'd have been able to handle the Last Post.  A little too much history, if you know what I mean...<br>

<p>This is completely inappropriate, but I can't help thinking about Spinal Tap at Elvis' grave at Gracelands.</p>
<p> <i>Nigel: It really puts perspective on things, though, doesn't it?</i> </p>

Damn, here I am with moderator points, and I can't give that a (+1, Tasteless). Pudge! Sort it out would you?
