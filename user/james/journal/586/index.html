<p>...with the help of Ben Holzman, I've now got B::Deparse to provide access to INIT and BEGIN blocks as coderefs from the runtime.  I'm not entirely sure what this is helpful for, but I'm sure its helpful for something :-) I was in all sorts of confusion earlier, because the only time that the INIT blocks are available to be deparsed is inside a CHECK block.  So code that worked inside B::Deparse wasn't doing the right thing at runtime.  Once again, all knowledge of INIT, apart from things that get set up by them, is thrown away.  If I had wireless LAN, I'd submit a patch.  I suppose I'll have to wait until I can get it off the laptop on Monday now.  Anyway, thanks for the help Ben!<br/><br/>The conference is getting better, with some non-tutorial's today.  As <a href='~pdcawley'>pdcawley</a> mentioned Robin's Mutagenic Modules talk was excellent -- he has managed to do some truly horrific things to the language. However, I'm still the only person I remember being asked if I'm on drugs after a talk :-)  <br/><br/>Speaking of talks, its my lightning talk soon, I'm a little bit nervous about it, considering the contents (uh oh).  I'm thinking about revising it to make it a little less contraversial, but then again.....probably not :-)<br/><br/>Ingy is doing his talk on Inline now, which I missed in Montreal, but I really need to work on the talk, so I think I'll have to skip.  Also Leon mentioned something about getting to the lightning talks early.... hmmm.<br/><br/>And thanks to Marty, I have power to the laptop again (this time its persistant!)<br/><br/>More later...
 
Oh, and again, Hi Katrien!
