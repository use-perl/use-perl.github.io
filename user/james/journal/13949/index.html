<p>At 9:45 this morning the power to our office went out.  Only it wasn't just our office it was for the entire block around us.  It seems that everybody cranked up the aircon and something blew up somewhere.<br/><br/>I'm currently writing this on the last few drops of power in my laptop over some very expensive bandwidth - via GSM over bluetooth.<br/><br/>London Electricity say that they will turn the power back on at 1400, but I'm not holding my breath...<br/><br/><i>I really should go home...</i></p>

<h2>Us too..</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/barbie/">barbie</a> on 2003-08-06T11:34:41</h3>
It's been happening here for the past few weeks. It appears the building was badly configured for power. Everytime more than one person switches on an aircon unit the building blacks out. Due to the heat in the office we have been told we can work from home, but that only works if you can access what you're working on at home (even with a VPN).



<h2>what can you do?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/nicholas/">nicholas</a> on 2003-08-06T13:24:53</h3>
<p>I mentioned this predicament to a co-worker</p>
<p>Me: You can't get much work done without power</p>
<p>(pause)</p>
<p>Me: Mm, but you can have meetings</p>
<p>Him: As you said, you can't get much work done...</p>



<h2>There's air conditioning in London?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/nkuitse/">nkuitse</a> on 2003-08-06T14:37:55</h3>
Aha!  <b>That's</b> where I should have hung out in London 3 weeks ago--<b>server closets!!!</b> <br> <br>As it was, I felt lucky to get some coolth and rain near the end of my stay.<br> <br>Naturally, I love London in all other respects.<nobr> <wbr></nobr><code>:-)</code>
