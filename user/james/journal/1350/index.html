<p>Went for Dim Sum today with pdcawley and acme.  Mr Cawley came back to fotango and gave us the refactoring talk that I missed last night which was nice of him.  Some of the code is very clever, mostly all the things you shouldn't teach people to write.<br/><br/>I've been in a bubble today.  This morning I had to struggle with the NHS to try to get a doctor.  Only took 3 hours which must be some sort of record (low not high).  When I came out there was a lot of people in the waiting room scowling at me because they didn't have their chance.<br/><br/>Finally got to work around 12 (which I did feel a little bit guilty about) and went straight out to lunch.  This afternoon it was a little bit of work on the Vx class diagram, and a little bit of work on plain old fotango.  Shiny new release on Monday, so its last minute panic time for everybody.<br/><br/>Quiet day really, but I feel like I'm wearing a space suit, and have just noticed there's a crack in the face-mask. Oh, and I'm on the moon too.  Yup, that just about describes it.</p>
