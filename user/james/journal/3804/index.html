<div class="span8">
<p>So, on Friday night just past I packed my bags, got on the train, and went up to Nottingham to see <a href="http://www.nottinghamforest.co.uk">my team</a> <a href="http://www.nottinghamforest.co.uk/stats/view/postmatch_analysis/0,,10308~15743,00.html?POSTMATCHFLAG=FIXTUREON">lose</a> for the last time this season.  Of course, it won't be the last time they lose, but it will be the last time I see them lose.  I'm in Spain for my traditional last home game of the season trek to the City Ground.<br/><br/>The really sad news of the day is that time may well be up for Forest and other lower division clubs.  <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/business/newsid_1896000/1896732.stm">ITVDigital</a> have really stuffed a lot of the lower league clubs and I'll just have to cross my fingers and hope that Forest don't bite the big one.  Forest have been in dire financial trouble once already this year and I'd hate to see it happen again.<br/><br/>Of course, tonight London.pm has called an emergency meeting and this is clearly a very bad thing, because, if nothing else, it clashes with the England vs. Italy game.  I'm sorry, but if you ask me to choose between Perl or country then country is going to come first every time :-) There have been suggestions that I should watch the game in the pub at the social meeting, but I think that it might be a little unnerving for people if I stand up and swear and/or shout repeatedly and loudly for no obvious reason at random points through the night.<br/><br/>Work has been tremendously long today.  It feels like I've been sat at this desk for days on end since lunch time, and I suppose that this is a sign that I need Easter Weekend badly.  I'm in Belgium for Easter so one could suggest that I'm in practice for not understanding anything that is going on around me :-)<br/><br/>Not much perl-y goodness at the moment, we're getting closer to the end of <i>the project</i> at work and it seems to eat in to all my available hours.  Not to worry though, I suppose this is what its supposed to be like, right?  I've looked at rewriting OpenFrame hoever, to use the new Pipeline interface, and it should be fairly easy.  I've got to get my head 'round all the backwards compatibility stuff (either that or punt on it) and then it should all be a relatively quick hack.<br/><br/><i>...come on England, come on England...</i><br/><br/><br/><br/></p>

<h2>England vs Italy - bugger</h2>

Once again, being on the other side of the pond means I'll miss this game.  I'd better ring my Mum and ask her to tape it for me...

<p>England is a country now?  NEAT!</p>

&gt; England is a country now? NEAT! <br> <br>When it comes to football or cricket we are.  England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales all have their own national teams, and although we may sing Rule Brittania, God Save the Queen and other Brittish songs instead of English songs (which is a whole other question...) its definitly a country<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-).<br> <br>Jeremy Paxman wrote an intereresting book called <i>The English</i> where he tackles this particular issue.  England has very little national identity (or at least, when compared to the Scottish, Welsh, or Irish).  He basically sums it up as a throwback to the days of the empire when we used to be identified by the fact that we ruled everything else, and therefore didn't need anything to hold on to that would identify us as different.   Curiously if you examine the footage (and if you've ever lived in England you get this opportunity once every two weeks or so<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-) from the 1966 World Cup final you'll see that people are waving the Union Jack in the stands rather than St. Georges cross, so its even up to the mid-nineteen sixties we still felt no need to be identified as different. Of course those days are gone now and England does look to some degree for a national identity distinct from the other parts of the United Kingdom.  I'd say football is one of the ways (and this is not always in a positive manner...) in which we do that.<br> <br>
