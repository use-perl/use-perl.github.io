<div class="span8">
<p>I've got to write a reasonably large chunk of code for a server that talks to a client using a protocol I have no control over, and have little specification for. This protocol (like so many others) sits on top of HTTP and based on what I <i>do</i> know about it, the protocol is not very pretty.<br/><br/>My first thought was "write a proxy server" to get a good idea about what data the client is sending and what the server is responding with.  <br/><br/>I think however, that there is a Better Way.  I find myself doing this sort of thing all the time and I'm not sure its the right way to do it.  When Pierre wrote <a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?dist=WSDL-Generator">WSDL::Generator</a> he gave me the ideea.<br/><br/>WSDL::Generator works by examining data between your calling code, and your called code over a long period of time, and then using that knowledge to slowly learn what what the called code considers valid input.  <br/><br/>I think that I can probably write a proxy that learns what the protocol looks like (in both request and response form) and build me a reasonably complete framework of code to use in a tuned-by-hand version.<br/><br/><i>Of course I might just be smoking too much crack...</i></p>

<h2>possible cpan directory amusment</h2>

Pierre Denis' CPAN directory is called PDENIS. When I first saw it I was convinced that it was PENIS<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
<p>
I was wondering if the powers to be would grant such a name and if I need more or less coffee to survive the afternoon...
