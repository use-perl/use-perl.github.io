<p>Up, well, later lets say, this morning.  Last night was the London.pm meeting in Amsterdam so I'm a little weary today.  The speakers dinner was last night, so about 30-40 of us all crowded into a Leboneese [sp?] resturant and ate food which confused us, or at least the order of the courses confused us.  Still, it was good opportunity to have some weighty discussions.<br/><br/>Then it was off to a bar closer to the center of town where the real fun began.  Lots of people showed up, and I think it was the London.pm meeting with the biggest non-London turn out :-)<br/><br/>In general everything is going smoothly (on the surface, I don't pretend to have any idea what the organizers are going through), and lots of people have commented to me that they are having a really good time.<br/><br/>Of course I have to do my lightning talk today, and the subject matter is something that during the average working week really bothers me.  Conferences always make me feel like what I'm planning on saying isn't really correct.  Its being surrounded by lots of very smart people who really know their stuff, as opposed to being at work where people (myself included) have to cut corners to Just Get The Job Done.  However, I know that a week after being at the conference I will feel the same way again so the show must go on...<br/><br/>Right-o, must find power for the laptop, ho hum...<br/><br/>
