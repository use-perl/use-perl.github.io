<div class="span8">
<p>This weekend is incredibly depressing.<br/><br/>Early Friday evening I received a phonecall from my Dad, as it turned out they were about 10 minutes away from where I was, which is odd, considering that they live in Spain, and I am in the UK.<br/><br/>"Surprise" he said.  Them showing up of course was not the surprise.<br/><br/>The surprise was that after 24 years of marriage my parants are splitting up.  It seems that my Father has fallen in love with another woman and wants to leave my mother.  So now my mother is sat opposite me at the dining table, and my father is off doing God knows what.<br/><br/>I know it happens to lots and lots of people, but that doesn't take the shock, or the hurt away.<br/><br/><i>Maybe next weekend will be better,  it can't after all, get much worse...</i>

That's a messed-up situation and I hope your Dad comes to his senses.  Kinda reminds me of <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0243155" title="imdb.com">Bridget Jones' Diary</a imdb.com>.

It's gotta be an awkward time for you... hang in there and just try to do The Right Thing.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)
