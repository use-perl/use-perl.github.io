<p>YAPC::NA is over.  I am having a quiet day and relaxing around the hotel before I have to fly back tomorrow.  Yesterday I gave my my 93KLOC talk, and it all seemed to go very well, with lots of people getting involved, commenting, and seeming to be interested in what I had to say.  It's always nice to get some sort of feedback -- any feedback -- and this particular talk seemed to generate a lot, which was really good.<br/><br/><a href="http://use.perl.org/user/2shortplanks/journal/">2shortplanks</a> paid me a big compliment in his journal, and while I'm not sure I think that I'm a particularly good speaker, its nice that _someone_ thinks so -- thanks!<br/><br/>This whole conference has been really great, for which I have  to extend a huge thankyou to Kevin, Biz, and everyone who had a hand in organizing and looking out for the ~200 people that came.  The location was fantastic, the tracks interesting, and cars big!<br/><br/>Its nice to get back to a conference after a year.  Bumping into old friends and making new ones, and generally feeling revitalized with the fact that although the Perl community is very big, it can also be very small.  Regardless of size however, it is inspiring, and I feel priviledged to be a part of it, especially after such a great week.</p>

I thought it was a cracking talk. Though there was some bugger at the back who kept interrupting.
