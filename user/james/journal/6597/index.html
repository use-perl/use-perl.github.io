<p>TPC time is always rather depressing -- everybody seems to be having so much fun!.  I've not yet made it to San Diego for an OSCON and every year it seems to escape me, still, sooner or later I suppose I will get there.<br/><br/>Of course TPC going on has finally kicked me into gear and I've submitted the final collection of talk proposals to YAPC::Europe.  My proposals now number a grand total of 4, which is probably far too many to see anything else thats going on, but not to worry.
<ul>
<li>Pipeline Programming</li>
<li>OpenFrame</li>
<li>Pixie (The Magical Data Kind)</li>
<li>The one where I swear a bit, or <i>We're not Building a Fucking House!</i></li>
</ul>The nice thing is that while I've always had last minute madness to create slides for talks in the past, now giving talks fills part of my job description so most of the work and effort has been done if not refined.<br/><br/>It feels like conferences come around more and more quickly each year.  This can only be a Good Thing.<br/><br/>In other news I visited my hotmail account for the first time in about two months yesterday.  I discovered that it has been replaced with about 200 examples of spam.  It also reminded me that I was supposed to be doing the rolling tech review of the Web Services book, and I missed it completely.  Shit.<br/><br/><i>Ooo, I should get Final Cut Pro books today!</i></p>
