<p>Something was pointed out yesterday at the London.pm Random Social Lunch (at Belgos, mmmm, Belgian Beer and Mussles)  that I've never really considered that much before.
I don't have a nickname, and I never have.  Even through primary school, high school and up, I was never called by anything other than my first name.  In fact, I've never even been called by a shortened version of my first name.  How bizarre. <br/><br/>Anyway, the <a href="http://openframe.fotango.com">OpenFrame</a> website has been up for nearly 10 hours now, and its still working, which is a plus :-)
However, thats not why I mentioned it.  Something thats pretty clear in my head (and this is mirrored in OpenFrame) is that in any web-based application a page that is displayed to a browser is mostly something that sits in between two parts of an application.  Therefore it -- the page -- needs inputs (to fill in dynamically generated values) and outputs (which are things like form fields).  I tried explaining this to my <a href="http://www.fotango.com/cgi-bin/vpi.cgi?S_ID=101166&P_W=51340">girlfriend</a> who is generating a workflow for websites at the moment.  She is from a design background, and is having trouble grasping the concept.<br/><br/>I'm unsure whether this is because, as a designer,  she sees a web page as a final element, and I, as a developer, see a web page as an inbetweeny-thing (as explained above) or if I'm just unable to make myself clear.  Its frustrating, but I think I've made some headway now.<br/><br/></p>
