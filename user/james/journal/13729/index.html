<p>So,  Arthur, Katrien, and I all left Paris on Saturday evening on the 21:23 train to London.  It was slightly delayed on the way out of Paris, but it shouldn't have been any big deal.<br/><br/>About 30 minutes into the journey Arthur and I noticed we were going far too slowly around a corner.  We could feel that the train was leaning significantly, and it just didn't feel right.  About 10 minutes after that we came to a stop.<br/><br/><i>*crackle* *crackle* Ladies and Gentlemen we are currenly, blah blah blah blah blah</i><br/><br/>It turned out that there was signal failure somewhere on the line.  Despite having 3 other trains pass us while we were sat still.  After an hour we chugged very slowly to Lille.  Then we chugged very slowly through the tunnel, to Ashford, and then very slowly to Waterloo.<br/><br/>We got into waterloo at about 0330, and after an extremely long wait we got a taxi home (although to be fair to the eurostar company they did pay for it).  We arrived home at about 0500.<br/><br/>While the conference was a lot of fun, it certainly wasn't worth that journey home.  Next time, I'm flying.</p>

<p>With BA?</p>
<p>I had a very pleasant trip back on the Eurostar the next day. Sometimes shit happens. What would be useful to know is how often it happens by plane, and how often it happens by train.</p>

My BA flight back to Birmingham was delayed by just 5 mins and arrived on time<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) I was home in just over 90 mins from leaving Paris CDG.
