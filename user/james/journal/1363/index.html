<p>Another weekend done which means I have to go to work tomorrow.  Davorg's experience with Christmas shopping in London much mirrored my own.  Herds and herds of people on Oxford street, and all we were trying to get was a birthday present (which meant going into Hamleys, which was a nightmare.)<br/><br/>The birthday party was fun -- I'm always at a disadvantage when we visit my girlfriends friends -- they all speak flemish and I don't.  I suppose that is how she feels most of the time, but at least she is fluent in english, whereas I don't have the first idea what anything means in flemish.    More reason to learn I suppose.<br/><br/>Still, I did have a good evening.  I'm a little further ahead in my thinking AFA subrequests in OpenFrame - its a tricky one, and I've had use for similar things before, but I can't determine a really clean way of doing it.<br/><br/>There must be a mechanism in there somewhere.<br/><br/></p>

<p>You could be trying to learn Finnish<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) At least Flemish is in the same language family. </p>

I suppose you have a point<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)  Some things I understand I, it depends how fast people are speaking -- I may get a word or three if it is at a slow pace.
