<p>Another website I'm slowing becoming somewhat addicted to is <a href="http://www.scan.co.uk">scan</a>.  Scan has lots of cool hardware gizmos on it, and unlike other gizmo places it is very very cheap (by UK standards).<br/><br/>Their 'today only' page is fantastic.  Most days it doesn't have anything that I want in particular.  However, every now and again it has some gadget or gizmo which is incredibly cool in the geek sense of the word.<br/><br/>For example, today I took advantage of the full wack dolby surround sound speaker and amp combination thingy, and I have no doubt that by exercising the essentially male talent of wanting things bigger/better/faster/louder I will enjoy films more (ooooo, the house is rattling when Vadar breathes).  This talent of course, is what gets us in to trouble a lot of the time.  Katrien's only comment was that surely the current stereo was loud enough.  WRONG!<br/><br/>The other good thing about scan is that they do next day delivery.  I remember ordering something (I think it was a pen drive) from scan at about 5 pm and getting it at 9 am the next day by couriered delivery.  Now that's service.<br/><br/></p>
