<p>I saw an interesting talk on Aspects in Java using something other than AspectJ (which of course isn't Java, but something like Java).<br/><br/>JAC essentially acts as a wrapper and does runtime analysis of Java bytecode to weave various aspects in and out of the system.  Its fairly impressive, but its largely based on naming conventions, which isn't so useful.<br/><br/>The really neat thing is that they created a UI aspect.  Now, I might not be smoking enough crack here, but I have my doubts that you could make a UI aspect that is good for much beyond debugging.    I've not had time to look at it, but it goes on my list.<br/><br/>It seems to me that often when we find a new progmramming mindset, we seem to forget that others still have a place within that framework - we are just building layers right ?<br/><br/>Anyway, I'm going to take a look when I can at Marcel's Aspect module a little more closely, and see what can be done with it.<br/><br/>The bad news is that I missed Thursday at the conference because of a cold.  Who goes on holiday and gets sick?  Well, other than me...<br/><br/></p>

<h2>widgets example with aspects</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/marcel/">marcel</a> on 2002-07-13T17:38:34</h3>
hi james!<br> <br>some time ago i posted the following to the perl-aspects list (which is so quiet as to say it's defunct by now... not much interest in aspects, it seems). i just remembered it as you talked about aspects &amp; gui.<br> <br>#!/usr/bin/perl<br> <br>=pod<br> <br>Here's an idea. Aspects can be used to explicitly, in a declarative<br>way, specify relationships between objects. In a way, that's what<br>design patterns do.<br> <br>So we're looking at a fictitious set of user interface widgets;<br>there's a Widget class from which all widgets derive. We have a<br>Listbox class that can hold a list of options, one of which is<br>selected. We also have a Textbox class. And there's a Dialog class<br>that holds both a textbox and a listbox.<br> <br>So far so good. If you look at the implementation of all those<br>classes you'll notice that they don't know anything about each<br>other.<br> <br>How these classes interact with each other is specified explicitly<br>using an aspect. This particular aspect consists of three pieces<br>of advice:<br> <br>(a1) When a listbox or textbox is assigned to a dialog, said box<br>is told who its parent is.<br> <br>(a2) When an option on the listbox is selected, its dialog's<br>associated textbox is told about that text as well.<br> <br>(a3) When a textbox's text is set, it is told to redraw or update<br>itself, which in this simple example just prints a line to STDOUT.<br> <br>So the basic ideas here is that aspects can specify interrelationships<br>between objects in a declarative way.<br> <br>Ideas?
