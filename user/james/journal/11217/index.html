<p><a href="http://use.perl.org/user/acme">Acme</a> and I are looking at our costs for getting to both OSCON and YAPC::NA.  The problem is that at the moment it seems to be cheaper for us to fly to Miami, stay for a couple of weeks beyond the conference, and then fly on to portland before returning to London. Or at least for the airfares (significantly so, airfare for LHR/MIA is about 450 GBP, LHR/PDX is about 700 GBP, to do LHR/MIA/PDX/LHR is about 616 GBP)<br/><br/>The real problem there is that it is a month when we have to pay mortgages, accomodation, as well as taking a large amount of time of work.  We need to find a low cost way of staying in Boca Raton in between conferences and its proving to be quite difficult.<br/><br/>There are a couple of avenues we have still to explore, but its all getting very complicated and confusing.</p>

<h3><a href="/user/acme/">acme</a> on 2003-03-25T12:45:36</h3>
Or we could get a fast car and do a road trip, passing through Perl Monger cities, saving little children stuck down wells, rescuing Townsville from almost certain distruction, with much booze and debauchery in the mix too.
<p>
Then again, driving that far isn't very tempting.</p>

I'm not sure that driving back in time for a flight would be much fun either in the state that I'd imagine we'll be in<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

The return trip would be the killer, but at least it would allow you to sweep through a different part of the country on the way back Seriously, if you plan on hitting Perl Mongers cities on your route to and from Florida please announce your travel plans so groups can plan accordingly. It would be great to have you both visit Chicago for a tech/social meeting.

Oh my god I've just realised what a <a href="http://www.astray.com/tmp/long_drive.gif" title="astray.com">long drive</a astray.com> that'd be. Mapblast reckons 3354 miles and
49 hours, which is a lot of driving. Europe is really quite small in comparison. The furthest I've driven is London to Amsterdam (335 miles, 6 hours)...

Europeans think 100 miles is a long distance.
<p>
North Americans think 100 years is a long time.</p>

... be sure to look at <a href="http://hotwire.com/" title="hotwire.com">Hotwire</a hotwire.com> for great hotel rates.  I've gotten some sweet deals on hotels in major cities when it didn't matter exactly what hotel I was at (like I wasn't at a conference or something).
<p>
Also, if you really don't insist on all that sunshine, your stay in Portland will be significantly cheaper than your stay in Miami, so you might want to fly up earlier.</p>

Hmm, interesting idea.  It seems that staying in Portland will work out about $1000 cheaper (comparing hotel to hotel) which is much better.<br> <br>We may however, be able to get a villa in Boca Raton for the duration on the cheap, which would be very nice indeed (sunshine!)...
