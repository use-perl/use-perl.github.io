<p>So the other day we are trying to use subversion, and its taking a long time, and the server keeps crapping out on us with segfaults, and I'm thinking to myself, how hard can this version control stuff be?<br/><br/>So, I don't have merge detection in yet, but I'm starting to build a plan in my head for it. Munge is self-hosting after 8 hours work, which ain't too shabby when you consider how long it took subversion :-)  Done is commit, update, checkout, log and diff.  I don't have anything travelling over a network yet, and I need to add user ids and the executable bits somewhere, but none of this stuff seems that difficult.<br/><br/>The source is on <a href="http://www.ululate.co.uk/munge/">my munge website</a> and I'm going to be playing around with this as often as I can over the next little while.  Its kind of a fun project, and modifying the code should be much easier than, say, hacking on cvs.<br/><br/><i>I wonder what I can rewrite next week...</i></p>

if you can give us a reproducable test case, the subversion team would love to hear about those segfaults.  there isn't much we can do about that sort of thing if we don't hear about it.

I am pretty sure that Robert reported these. Aside from that, even if it works, it takes me roughly 1.5 hour to merge bleadparrot into ponies subversion repository. Checking out bleadperl takes over half an hour to checkout where a rsync against APC takes 3 minutes. I am still hoping to use Subversion for ponie but if it keeps on working like this we might have to change.

Yeah, Robert did report those mod_authz_svn problems, and I believe we got a fix (well, a temporary one anyway, while Sander figures out what the deal is).  As for the speed, yeah, it's a bit slow, we know, and we're working on it.  Sorry about that.

A bit slow<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:), 1 minute and 22 seconds to commit 2 new files is very very very slow.

I assume you're talking about your recent commit adding the Configure.pl and Makefile to the top of the ponie tree?  That's really odd, that kind of thing should not take a minute.  If you don't mind my asking, what was the exact command you used to do the commit, and what part took that long?<br/><br/>Feel free to take this conversation to email (rooneg@electricjellyfish.net) if you prefer.
