<p>While other London.pm'ers were out getting bladdered I was signing my life away to a bank.  Hmm, scary.<br/><br/>However, there was one shining gem in the event, firstly. No there were two shining gems in the event, firstly actually getting it done and over with. It takes so <i>long</i> to get to this point even moving (as in packing, shifting, unpacking) stuff seems appealing.  Secondly (and this is the best bit) was the map of the surrounds from the land registry.
I have a map fetish.  I love 'em.  So naturally when the solicitor got out the map I went all goggly-eyed. I don't know what it is about maps, they are such wonderful things.  One of the rooms in the new house is going to be the library for the multitude of books that we have.  But secretly I think, its going to be my map room.  At the moment I have all the maps I own (and its all completely random stuff, like an 1904 map of Virginia, for example) out of the tubes and plastic sheets, and framed and mounted and on the wall.  I've not decided between that or a trunk with all the maps rolled up in it -- part of the fascination is being able to touch them I guess.<br/><br/>Whoa! I revealed <i>far</i> too much about myself there.</p>

<h2>Maps</h2>

I guess it's part of the knowledge is power thing.  They let you know <i>precisely</i> what an area looks like.  I guess that to people without a map, it must be like the one eyed man in the land of the blind.

<p>Or something like that.  Christ, I need to calm down and not cycle into work so quickly.

<h2>Map</h2>

<p>I had the same feeling when I saw the map of my subdivision last year when I got my house.  It's just so neat!  I can even see what the lots look like.  I can even see what the 15' drainage easement across the back of my property looks like.</p>

<p>In related news: you have a <i>secret</i> plan to make it the map room, so you posted it on the Internet?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

Wood for trees and all that<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br> <br>But seriously, its secret because Katrien doesn't know the plan yet<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

<p>My mind did everything in its power to make that Perl-related.</p>
