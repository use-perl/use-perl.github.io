<p>...The difference this time is that I have code[0], and it mostly works.  Its all built around the Pipeline module, so segments that work in Pipelines that are not native to OpenFrame specific could easily work in those that are.  And of course vice versa.  Lots and lots of other changes, the majority of which have come about due to us using Openframe at <a href="http://opensource.fotango.com">work</a> a lot (the real world is always trying for things that get invented in theoretical situations :-).<br/><br/>However, I'm running into a naming problem.<br/><br/>In previous releases of OpenFrame everything was bundled in one big distribution, which was great for somethings, but not so great for others.  In 3.0 and beyond the idea is that everything should be as unbundled as possible.<br/><br/>Currently OpenFrame is split into the code OpenFrame distribution and the OpenFrame-AppKit distribution.  Closer to release I'll probably unbundle Apache related stuff from the main OpenFrame distribution as well...<br/><br/>OpenFrame-AppKit contains all the functionality required to start writing web-like applications, which is to say, a session loader/saver, a base Application class, and a TT2 segment.  However, I'd rather not use 'OpenFrame-AppKit' as a name for a couple of reasons: 1) very similar to AxKit and 2) Apple's [was NeXT's] Application object framework thingy is called AppKit.  Now maybe I've been spending too much time with my growing collection of Apple computers but I can't think of another way to describe it. Is there anything else that would do the job?  If anyone has any suggestions, comments here, on the openframe mailing list or the #openframe channel on rhizo would be very welcome indeed.<br/><br/>[0] Its true! Honest, you can checkout the openframe3 and AppKit modules from the <a href="http://openframe.fotango.com/cvs/">openframe cvs</a> server!
