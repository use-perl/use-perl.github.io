<p>Well, I've uploaded the first version of Pipeline to CPAN.  Its underdocumented, but working and passing tests.<br/><br/>We've been throwing around concepts for metaphors of pipeline development, and we''ve had all sorts of things - ducks, bunnies, pillows, turds, and foxes.  However,  I think finally there's something that makes sense:
a Meal machine.  Into the meal machine you place ingredients, and then various bits of the machine shape and form your ingredients into whatever you want (for example, a burger needs a pattee maker, but a meat loaf needs a loaf maker, from the same general ingredients).<br/><br/>In a slightly related theme, there was an interesting article in CACM the other day about reoccuring business themes, which is a fancy way of saying that not every kitchen has a refrigerator but they all have storage space.  It was interesting in as much as its claim was that while you may need to redevelop your business logic from time to time, your reoccuring business themes should be consisten not only from software version 1 and 2, but also from company a to company b.<br/><br/>Cute. Its probably an area where Open Source software could really capitalize.
