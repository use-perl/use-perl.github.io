<p>Last night was a London.pm Emergency Meeting, held because Mothra was in town and we all really needed to go to the pub.<br/><br/>We all met up at the Pillar(s?) of Hercules on Greek Street (just off of Soho Square).  It was a little too far west for me, but in general the pub was nice (if not a little small), the beer was foamy, and the conversation was good.<br/><br/>Katrien and I sat and chatted to <a href="/user/acme/journal">acme</a>, and <a href="/user/mothra/journal">mothra</a> most of the night.  Acme now has a new career path, apparantly, breeding chickoose's for the eggs.<br/><br/>Didn't talk about too much that was technical, but there was a lot of talk about football, what makes the UK different from Europe, what makes England different from the UK, and what makes it all different from Canada.<br/><br/>I think a  good time was had by all, and may well have led to one or two hangovers this morning...
