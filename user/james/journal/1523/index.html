<p>acme's stab of lauding various elements of the perl community in his use perl journal, I am going to give kudos to <i>use.perl.org</i> itself.<br/><br/>I've been writing nonsense in this thing almost non-stop for the past seven months now, and it has become a compulsion.  I constantly find myself writing stuff that is of no interest to anyone else in it, and then I wonder why.<br/><br/>Reading the journals is as much fun as writing them.  People seem to post all sorts of interesting things in them - new projects, old projects gone wrong, old projects gone right, and how much their boss sucks.  I find myself checking each morning to see what has been written the day before (in fact more regularly than slashdot).<br/><br/>The whole use perl journal thing has taken on some sort of continuity.  davorg posts something controversial, everyone attacks, davorg apologizes, repeat. <br/><br/>Although the use perl journals are supposed to contain perly bits and pieces the most interesting entries of all are those that have very little to do with perl - people bitching about their job, about shopping when its busy, about buying a flat or a house and the loads of other things that all people encounter.<br/><br/>So maybe I know why I spew in the use perl journal -- because they are like a big soap opera of perl programmers.  There are villains (usually bosses and estate agents) and protagonists (well, us) and that makes it fun.

LOL James, I too have found myself checking use.perl.org for new journal entries before visiting the other daily obligatory "must see" websites. (grin).
