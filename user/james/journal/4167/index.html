<p>ENOPERLCONTENT<br/><br/>I'm in Spain for my Father's 50th Birthday.  You may or may not remember how late they have a tendency to stay up.<br/><br/>Because of course, its my Fathers birthday lots of his side of the family is in town (which is Vitoria, Spain).  Last night we had a big family meal at an argentinian steak house which was really nice.  Everybody ate more than their fair share's worth and a good time was had by all.<br/><br/>Afterward it had all been tidied away the time was about 0200.  Of course Katrien and I were knackered.  So my parents took us back to their flat, and then they went out again.  <br/><br/>Its so strange wondering what time your parents are going to get in...<br/><br/>So, anyway, its roughly 1130 right now,  on the day of my Dad's birthday.  I would stick around to give him his present, but he's not woken up yet.  <i>Sigh...</i><br/><br/>We're going out in to the old town now, which will be quite nice, and I suppose we'll see them when we see them.
