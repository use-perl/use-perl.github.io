<p>Sucks.<br/><br/>Really, really sucks.<br/><br/>Of course, I'm moving from inside central London (no car) to outside of central London where a car is quite important.  I must have walked <i>miles</i> yesterday.<br/><br/>We saw a house first thing in the morning which was fantastic - filled all our requirements, all newly redone, nice garden (small enough not to be a huge amount of work, big enough that it wouldn't feel cramped) -- we went back to the estate agents office, put down an offer, and that was that.  Five minutes later, we got a phone call - another offer had been made <i>just</i> before us, and it had been accepted.<br/><br/>I get the feeling that to find a house in the London area you have to be just about willing to hand over cash there and then.<br/><br/>
We saw two other houses yesterday afternoon, and they, well, they needed a lot of work - probably about 10 years of weekend work.  To be fair they were bigger but I'm not sure I have the commitment to put in the effore required for that.<br/><br/>Ho hum.  More houses today.

<h2>homes and houses</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/TeeJay/">TeeJay</a> on 2002-07-29T12:06:30</h3>
We have a similar problem, just looking for somewhere to rent means paying overlapping rent because landlords won't wait the months notice required when leaving a property.<br> <br>On top of that is the ridiculous market in the area - most flats or houses for rent are gone in a couple of days, with agencies expecting decisions the next working day because turnaround is so fast.<br> <br>We can't even afford to buy a house within a reasonable distance of where either of us work. Last year house prices went up 23% in the region. The cheapest house in the area we work is about 100k and this is in cornwall where the average salary is 15k and we would struggle to get a mortgage for 80k.

For us the problem is less the mortgage but more the deposit. Rent is so high in London and that makes it  incredibly difficult to save enough to have a deposit on a house.  By the time you've saved what you initially thought you needed for a deposit the house prices have skyrocketed again and you're forever chasing the target. All the while house prices rise by ~20% a year -- unless you get a 20% pay increase year on year you are getting poorer until you buy that house.<br> <br>Remind me again, why am I looking at houses?<br>
