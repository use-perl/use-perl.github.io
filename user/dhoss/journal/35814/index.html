<p><p>It's finally done, <a href="http://storefront.buyorsell.it">the storefront</a>, which I wrote using CGI::Application and Template::Toolkit, among a cocktail of other modules for PayPal, and a few other things.</p>
<p>
It's pretty basic, and I actually have a few ends to tie up, but the part I took most pride in was the donation program.  In my 5ish years as a perl hacker I've never used map, and I got to with this, along with a small dispatch table, and even some AoH meddling without any headaches or ulcers.
</p>
<p>
I need to add a search option, and pagination, but I'm going to just port this whole thing over to Catalyst instead of doing little hacks at a time.  That way I can have a clean codebase to enter into an SVN repo and "start over on a clean slate" without actually having to rewrite much.
</p>
<p>
The CGI::App version can be released as a "Lite" version of this storefront when I decide to release it for use.
</p>
<p>
This is the largest non-Catalyst project I've done in a while, and I was rather surprised at how clean my code stayed and how, although I didn't have as much abstraction done as I would have liked, I put everything together in a way that was sensible and I have been able to expand fairly easily.
</p>
<p>
Well, off to do some DBIx::Class work on this storefront.
</p>
<p>
Peace.</p></p>

Whenever someone mentions a storefront with w cart, I have to ask.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br><br>Looked at Handel/Mango yet? If you are converting to Catalyst at some point, they could save you a lot of work. Even before that, no need to do Carts/Orders/Checkout from scratch any more.



<h2>Handel!</h2>

I've looked at Handel a while ago. I'll need to get back into it because I AM moving this over to Catalyst very very soon.  I used what I did for speed (to start, at least) and that turned out to be a load of crap because it took longer most likely than a Catalyst app.  I wasn't sure what resources I had a available for this client, but now that I know, I'm converting<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)
