<p>Good Lord.<br/><br/>I've been thrown into the shark tank that is freelance web development.  I love it for the most part, but it's been HELL trying to work with PayPal to get what probably should have been a super easy payment/donation solution done.<br/><br/>I've been fighting with their sandbox environment for the better part of 2 weeks, and my head's just about had it with all the mind fucking.<br/><br/>I'd settle for their prebuilt shopping cart if it allowed the functionality I needed.<br/><br/>2/3 of my projects are going just fine...but this one just seems to be a thorn in my side.  And the sad thing is, once I'm over this hump, it's absolutely clear sailing.<br/><br/>WHY IS THIS SO FUCKING HARD?<br/><br/>Maybe I'll get some wisdom or luck granted to me by the PayPal merchant staff, or someone who's already done this sort of thing.</p>

I'm looking for someone to take over Business::PayPal since I don't do anything with paypal anymore, I'm really not actively maintaining it.  Anyone...?  It would be nice to see the newer features supported by someone who uses them.

<p>I've been using Business::PayPal actively as of late.  I could take on maintainership duties if you so desire, I've managed to grok what it does and implement a fair amount of the functionality.</p>
