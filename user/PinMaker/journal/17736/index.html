<p>The joy from a monopolized country - South Africa.<br/><br/>Telkom SA is the only ADSL provider in south africa and they cannot under any cicumstances provide me with a static IP.<br/><br/>So, I Phoned a friend of a friend that said he would be able to help.<br/><br/>It just so happens that help will cost my around US$ 250.00 per month - extra over and above my connection fee with some 'clever' plan he can make. I just have to pay him every month for using his clever plan to make my billion DSL modem get a static IP address.....</p>

<h2>dynamic dns</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jmm/">jmm</a> on 2004-03-03T16:01:20</h3>
The site dyndns.com for a long time was providing free dynamic dns support, but looking at their web site it seems that they've been sold out to a commercial company dyndns.org.  That would still be far cheaper than $250.<p>
I used dyndns.com for a couple of years quite happily, but switched to easydns.com when I registered my domain through them and thei registration included dynamic dns as part of the deal.  They are $35/year for the domain reg including dynamic dns, and I've had no problems with them over the last few years.</p>



<h2>Dedicated server plus tunnel</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Juerd/">Juerd</a> on 2004-03-03T19:33:53</h3>
It's much cheaper to get a dedicated server and set up a simple tunnel/VPN if you need outgoing traffic to be from that static IP.



<h2>DynDNS.org</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/schwern/">schwern</a> on 2004-03-03T21:14:38</h3>
I use their CustomDNS service for schwern.org to point to my machine on a cable modem.  Works like a charm.  Just have a little daemon running on my server to inform DynDNS when there's an IP change.  <a href="http://www.dyndns.org/services/pricing/custom.html" title="dyndns.org">$25 per year per domain.</a dyndns.org>  Better than (does some math) $3000 per year with your friend's scheme.  And they <a href="http://www.dyndns.org/news/releases/archives/2003/07/165.html" title="dyndns.org">support Perl</a dyndns.org>
