<div class="span8">
<p>The weather here in San Diego is perfect, especially compared to the 90+ degree temperatures we've had nearly every day for weeks back in Philadelphia.  The highs are in the low 70's, the lows are in the mid 60's, and there are just a few puffy clouds in the sky.  One of the highlights of OSCON so far was hanging out on the balcony of Activestate's suite last night at their party, watching the full moon rise over downtown San Diego and the bridge to Coronado Island.  Which makes the weather report I saw on the local TV news last night all the more bizarre.<br/><br/>I've lived on the East Coast nearly all my life, and we need to pay attention to the weather because it can change radically from day to day.  I've often wondered what it must be like to be a weatherman someplace where the weather is nice nearly every single day.  Last night I found out.<br/><br/>They showed some satellite photos of two huge tropical storms off the west coast of Mexico, one of which had wind speeds up to 150 miles per hour.  In Philadelphia that would have been the top news story of the day.  Even if the storm was going to hit 1000 miles south of us, there would be constant updates with the storm track, wind speeds, etc.  Here there was no mention of potential damage to Mexico, but they did mention that there might be great surfing conditions in the next few days.<br/><br/>Then they started bitching about their own weather.  The high yesterday was only 75, but they went on and on about how hot and muggy it had been, and how nice it would be to get some relief over the weekend.<br/><br/>I wonder if it's just part of being human to complain about the weather no matter how nice it is...</p>

On my first trip to San Diego it actually <i>rained</i> one night.  It was the top story on the local news the next morning.
