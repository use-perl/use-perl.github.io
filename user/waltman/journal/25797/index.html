This afternoon my labmates asked me to settle an argument.  They handed me some headphones and asked me who was singing.  I put them on and heard what sounded like Aerosmith doing Dream On.  I listened for a bit to make sure it really was Aerosmith, then ventured "umm...Steve Tyler?"
</p><p>
"How did you <i>know</i> that?" asked the woman who just lost the bet.  "It doesn't sound anything like him!"
</p><p>
"Are you kidding?  It's one of the most popular rock songs in history.  I thought everyone knew that was Aerosmith."
</p><p>
"I didn't recognize it at all.  You mean you've really heard it before?"
</p><p>
"Only about 1000 times."  <i>All before you were born!</i>

Kids nowadays, with their hip hop and their iPods, I tell ya...</p>

In an interesting turn of events that accentuates your headshaking, your username is almost &#8220;walkman.&#8221;

I was talking to a colleague a while back about various alternative bands we were into in our younger days. I happen to mention that I got into The Cure thanks to John Peel back in 1978. Another colleague piped up<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... "I wasn't even born then!" That's when it hit me that it was over 25 years ago!
<p>
The Mission did a cover of Dream On some years ago, and I was horrified to discover friends didn't even know it was by Aerosmith. Their Run DMC collaboration caused confusion too. I had a similar experience when Heart hit the charts in the UK, to many they were a new band, I had to show them Dreamboat Annie, Little Queen and Dog &amp; Butterfly before they were convinced.</p>



<h2>Music</h2>

My wife had a similar experience.  She was on a family trip in Scandinavia when all of a sudden, <i>Take the Long Way Home</i> or something comes on the radio.  Lisa was in the car with her step-sister (~10 years her junior), who didn't recognize it.  The kid had never heard of Supertramp, Breakfast in America, or any of the songs on that album.  Funny.  It was only the #1 album in the US for about 500 consecutive weeks or so...(<i>before she was born!</i>)

It was The Logical Song.  It was depressing.  Breakfast in America was the first album I ever bought and she never even heard of the group.  I didn't think people my age were like that - we all knew groups from the 60s and such.  Maybe more variety was on the radio when I was a teen.

What makes it even more depressing is that I didn't get into music until I was about 12, but one of my first memories as a young padawan was that Breakfast in America was the #1 album for most of the 70s.

When I saw you had replied, I thought you were going to tell how we just heard this on the radio and I thought it was Led Zepplin.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

<h2>At Least</h2>

At least, when you said Steven Tyler, she didn't say, "no, it's Aerosmith!"<br><br>That's what vocal cords sound like before you massively abuse them.<br>
