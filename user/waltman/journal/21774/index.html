<div class="span8">
<p>There was a controversial play in Saturday's Penn-Princeton football game.  Here's how Princeton's student newspaper, <a href='http://www.dailyprincetonian.com'>The Daily Princetonian</a>, described it:

<blockquote><i>
  Determined not to roll over and give in to the heavily favored
  Quakers, the Tigers forced a fumble on Penn's first possession of
  the second half.</i>
</blockquote>

And here's how Penn's paper, <a href='http://www.dailypennsylvanian.com'>The Daily Pennsylvanian</a>, saw the same play:
<blockquote><i>
  Matthews moved the ball to the Princeton 42-yard line before the
  momentum of the game changed again.
<p>
  McDermott threw what appeared to be a forward pass to Matthews, who
  dropped it.  But the officials ruled it as a lateral, and Peter
  Kelly fell on it for the Tigers.
<p>
  "I thought that was a huge call," Bagnoli said.  "We had just had
  two or three first downs, the ball was right at midfield, we were
  starting to get a little bit of momentum...I didn't think it was
  close."</i>
</blockquote>
<p>
So who's right?  The Penn paper, of course.  The play was a screen pass to the running back.  The ball was thrown a little behind him and he couldn't catch it.  There was no one within 10 yards of Matthews when he dropped it.
