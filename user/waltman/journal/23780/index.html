<p>...the only thing that could save Terri Schiavo were medical marijuana?</p>


<hr/>



<h2>And?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/zatoichi/">zatoichi</a> on 2005-03-22T13:40:30</h3>
What do you think?



<h2>My guess</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/runrig/">runrig</a> on 2005-03-22T17:45:54</h3>
Unfortunately, Messrs. Bush would never percieve it as a life and death decision, because it generally doesn't save lives, it "merely" reduces suffering (and whether it reduces suffering or increases appetite enough to save a life is a non-issue). So I think the decision would be "screw it, let'er suffer." Which, I think, is the current decision anyway.



<h2>Political Ploys</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ziggy/">ziggy</a> on 2005-03-22T18:00:25</h3>
If the only thing that could save Terri Schiavo <i>were</i> medical marijuana,
she'd probably get lit.  And there'd be an act of Congress to help her
get lit, too.  And a Supreme Court review that would render that law
unconstitutional.  And so forth.
<p>
The problem here isn't that she's been in a vegetative state for 14
<b>years</b>.  The problem is that she's a pawn in the 2006 mid-term
elections.  If the only thing that could save her were a Democratic
majority in the House, Senate, and maybe Governor's mansions, then maybe
we'd have an ethical dilemma.  But now, it's just a publicity problem.</p>



<h2>Unanimity</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/pudge/">pudge</a> on 2005-03-30T17:56:06</h3>
There is no unanimity in the defenders of Schiavo over the issue of medical marijuana.  In my experience, half or better of the "real" conservatives (as in, small govt) are in favor of some form of drug legalization, and almost all of them are against most forms of abortion and some forms of euthanasia, including the current case.<br> <br>Of course, for those who are against all "drug" legalization it might be an interesting question, but for many -- for example, the editors of the National Review, the largest political opinion periodical in the nation, who are mostly in favor of marijuana legalization, but against the killing of Schiavo -- it would be a non-issue.<br>
