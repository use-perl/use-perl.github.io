<p><p>I'm leaving use.perl. This will be my final post here. use.perl has become less than useless, more like an embarrassment. For two weeks there were no frontpage news. This is not what those curious about Perl should find. The only real news were tucked away in a little side box and pointed to the journal entries. And the journal capabilities are a bit basic, to say the least. Technology has moved on.</p>

<p>I also encourage all use.perl journal authors to move to their own blogs. <a href="http://www.dagolden.com/">dagolden</a>++ has already done so. Diversity is good.</p>

<p>Now I'm not blogging regularly either, but I do have a separate <a href="http://hanekomu.at/blog">blog</a>. If and when I will blog again, it will be there, not here.</p>

<p>If I could delete my account here, I would. Sorry to sound so drastic, but this is what I think.</p>

<p>I really don't want to have to maintain my own blog... I'd rather someone made an actual blog.perl.org.</p><p>Someone like one of the many blog companies Perl runs?</p>

<p>I don't know what the procedure is to be added to Perlsphere or Planet Perl (is there an impending cage match?), but if it's easy, those plus one of the free blog services seem like the best option.</p>

For Perlsphere you just email perlsphere@downlode.org  Only took a couple of days before Earle (Hex) added my blog.
<br> <br>
IIRC Perlshpere was created by Earle because to get your blog added to planet.perl.org required two referrers (perhaps even recommendations from bloggers already on planet?).

Yeah, I think that would be a good idea. use.perl.org may be awful, but its centralization can be useful (after all, you do want readers when you write your blog entries).

<p>"Moveable Type" is Perl. Maybe they could install that and then migrate accounts from use.perl to it?</p><p>I would give free time to help make that happen.</p>

<p>Ah, now I read "dynamic content" with Smarty (ugh PHP). Is there Perl blogging software out there? I see bloxsom but that I don't think would have what we need.</p>

If you want free online blog that runs on Perl then try  <a href="http://vox.com./" title="vox.com.">http://vox.com./</a vox.com.>
<br> <br>
If you want to run your own then perhaps try <a href="http://www.angerwhale.org/" title="angerwhale.org">http://www.angerwhale.org/</a angerwhale.org>

<p>I would think that something using Perl would be preferable.</p>

I kinda of agree.   When I looked at getting a blog a few years ago it was a toss up between Vox &amp; Wordpress for me.   Would have loved to use Vox but was pragmatic and went for Wordpress.
<br> <br>
NB. When Vox introduces colour syntax code highlighting then I may relook again!

<h3><a href="/user/bart/">bart</a> on 2009-05-04T08:26:36</h3>
Agreed. And you know why? Because IMO you can't produce really good blogging software without users who really shake out every last wart. And if we, Perl addicts, won't do that, nobody will.

<p>Moveable Type does support PHP but it is completely optional.</p>
