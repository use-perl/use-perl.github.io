<p><a href="http://use.perl.org/user/gnat/journal/3574">This journal</a> made me think of typos in code, and then to reflect on werid variable names I've used.<br/><br/>Some are obvious, like <tt>$foo</tt>, <tt>$bar</tt>, <tt>$blah</tt>, <tt>$temp</tt>, <tt>$tmp</tt>.<br/><br/>Some of my favorites:
<tt>%HugeAssHash</tt> (later renamed to <tt>%hah</tt>)
<tt>&kludge()</tt>, <tt>&bugfix()</tt>, (the list could go on)<br/><br/>Anybody else have some to add to this list?<br/><br/><b>Updated:</b> Forgot to enable comments, I think that should be a prefernce somewhere to always have it on, unless I am missing it.</p>

But if I came across any variables/functions with names like that during a code review, the perpetrator would have it explained to him in no uncertain terms that a repetition would be considered a Career Limiting Move.<br> <br>What you do in your own, private programs is, of course, your own look out, but I strongly recommend staying disciplined.

<p>I never name anything with anything but a meaningful name, anymore.  Even a list index.  If I can't say what the thing is I'm writing code about, how can I write correct code for it?</p>

<p>That sounds silly, but it's the case.  If I spend ten minutes figuring out what to name the list index, I may save thirty minutes later when the code has grown more complex.</p>

<p>Of course, I rarely use an index in Perl; I use foreach.  But I apply the same principle everywhere I can.</p>

Oh, I understand all that now, and the <tt>&amp;kludge</tt> was when I was a beginer, and the <tt>%HugeAssHash</tt> was more of a joke with my co-workers, in a throw away script.<br> <br>Of course, there is the other end of this spectrum, where you have &amp;getPageAndParseItThenSaveIt(); function names, which do not really lend them selves to saving time. I've never been that verbose, but have seen it in other people's code.

@stuff and @junk are my standard temporary array and hash names.  $this, $that, $other are standard scalars.   and of course the file handles READ and WRITE...
