<p><p>Last year, while my boss made his annual trip back to the UK, we decided to 
leave him a decorate his office. A few thousand balloons later, his
<a href="http://www.mydumbfriends.com/gallery/view_album.php?set_albumName=tonysoffice">office was full</a>.
</p>
<p>
This year, we were bound and determined out do ourselves. I think we have <a href="http://www.exeunt.com/office">succeeded</a>.
Sure it may have cost more, but it was well worth it.</p></p>

I'm fairly certain that one of the guys helping you inflate baloons is a close, long-lost friend of mine from high school, Erik Beatty.
</p>
<p>
Am I right?  If I am, could you have him email me?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

Well, I went to high school with you too!<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:P Although, I barley remember you.<br> <br>Okay, I'll have him e-mail you. He is my roommate, and partner in crime (with this prank). He is a bit busy playing with his new toy of a 65 inch widescreen HDTV.

That is just one neat prank.<br>
I tip my toilet seat at you guys in humble admiration.



<h2>Very, very impressive</h2>

<p>I am in awe.  There is nothing more that I can say.  That was beautiful<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>
