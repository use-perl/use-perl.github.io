<p><p>As part of my current job as a Revision Control Specialist (my exact title!) 
in the Configuration Management/Deployment Services department, I get exposed to 
quite a few things. Some of them I hope never have to develop for, or learn. 
Such as <a href="http://www.compuware.com/products/uniface/">Uniface</a>.</p>

<p> One tool I've been put in charge of is maintaining their <a 
href="http://jakarta.apache.org/ant/">Ant</a> Build scripts. If you don't know 
what Ant is, I highly suggest you look it up. Even though it is all in Java, it 
has some merit. As their webpage says: <i>Apache Ant is a Java based build tool. 
In theory it is kind of like make without make's wrinkles.</i></p>

<p>So far I have been really impressed with Ant. It even has the ability to run 
<a 
href="http://jakarta.apache.org/ant/manual/OptionalTasks/script.html">scripts</a> written in other languages, supported in java by <a 
href="http://oss.software.ibm.com/developerworks/opensource/bsf/">BSF</a>. I 
have not had a chance to try this yet, but plan on doing it (and of course using 
perl, since perl is supported by BSF).

One idea I had as a project, since Ant Build Scripts are all XML based, is to 
write my own ant build script runner in Perl, since each "task" in Ant is 
written in Java, and is either a core task, optional task, or hand 
written/downloaded. Of course, make it more perlyish at the same time, with perl 
specific tasks. Of course, this will probably become one of my other half 
started, never finished projects.</p>

<h2>Ant custom tasks</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/lachoy/">lachoy</a> on 2002-01-11T13:14:30</h3>
I've written one custom Ant task and heavily modified another. It's pretty nifty. I think porting something like this to Perl would be interesting, but probably not used much unless it provided such a benefit over the existing tools (ExtUtils::MakeMaker and Module::Build, which Ken Williams has been working on for a while to replace E::MM). It seems that building/compiling tools tend toward a single standard just because it's an area most people never want to think about.



<h2>Revision Control Suggestionts</h2>

I'm about ready to look into a rcs for work (want to be more disciplined about this code base and maybe all of my code in general) and was thinking of going with CVS.<br> <br>Any suggestions for a better system than CVS or things to look out for?
