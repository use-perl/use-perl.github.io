<p>My company wants to put an install of a bug/issue tracking software where our customers can enter their own bugs, and this can get filtered by our support team. It will also allow our customers to see if another customer have entered a bug.<br/><br/>We had a box with FreeBSD 4.4 installed on it running Bugzilla, which our RND team upstairs was using, so the idea was to install bugzilla (or RT, since I am starting to push for that) on a box that will be outside the firewall, at first, it was going to be a windows box, which I successfully changed their minds. Then they were going to have me install it on our DNS box, running linux, which I also successfully stopped, due to security reasons.<br/><br/>So now, I've taken the box running bugzilla, and moved that install of bugzilla over to another box, running our cvs server and other things, and have started rebuilding this FreeBSD box to 4.6.2.<br/><br/>For fun, I've renamed it from jedi to brimstone. We don't have an official naming scheme, and I chose jedi originally since it was a temporary box to play with. Almost all our other boxes are named after rocks or stones (which most happen to be streets near by too). Such as Ruby, sapphire, crystal, coral, etc. I chose brimstone, due to the hell/devil/bsd theme, and bugs are hell anyway ;). I would have used amber, due to obvious reasons, but that was recently taken by our new e450 sun box.<br/><br/>Right now it is sitting there updating itself from the ports tree, after a quick cvsup of my current port tree.<br/><br/>Too bad RT is not a port on 4.6.2-RELEASE, same with perl 5.8. (Edit: just found /usr/ports/lang/perl5.8 after cvsup was done updating them)</p>
