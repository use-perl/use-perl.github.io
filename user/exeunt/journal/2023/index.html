I guess I should actually write something in here. I have no idea what, so a 
little about me...
</p><p>
How I found Perl...
</p><p>

  This is a funny story, and I hope I remember all the details. Around the end 
  of 1997 I had this sudden desire to learn perl (at the suggestion of the 
  system admin of my shell, and a friend). I quickly looked for a windows 
  version, since I was not able to install linux (at least without my parents 
  knowing it) on their computers. I did this so I could play around with it 
  while not connected to the internet, since I could run perl off my shell. I 
  found activestate's ActivePerl, and downloaded it, installed it, and ran 
  perl.exe expecting some whiz bang gui to pop up to help me. To my dismay it 
  did nothing, just sat there, after I waited a few minutes, I became 
  discouraged, and put the thought aside of learning perl till when I had more 
  time.
</p><p>
  A few months go by i keep looking perl here and there. As I pick up more unix 
  skills I figure out why just perl with out a script won't work, but don't have 
  the time study it properly. Went through a few non computer related jobs. Then 
  through a friend off IRC I started working remotely for him, doing data entry 
  type stuff. In there, I had to modify a little perl code to do some quick 
  calculations, if necessary (to do with price, and quantity ordered). It was 
  suggested I learn perl in case I needed to do some fancy work, and just for 
  general knowledge.
</p><p>
  I went out and committed a mortal sin in the perl world, I bought Perl for 
  Dummies. Before you judge me, it did help me get a quick start, and I quickly 
  repented of my sin and bought myself a copy of Programming Perl and the Perl 
  Cookbook. After the contract job for my friend ran out, I started playing with 
  perl more heavily, being unemployed, and having lots of free time. Being the 
  role-player I am, I decided to write a dice roller. With my new found skills, 
  I began to get fancy with my dice roller, and kept adding features, like color 
  (using Term::AnsiColor). After playing with a command line version of this 
  little dice roller, I decided to look into a GUI version. That is when I found 
  TK, more specifically, perl/tk. I then preceded to write a slick gui dice 
  roller. Looking back at the code it was ugly, but mine. I am too ashamed to 
  admit is mine, and if you look enough, you might find a copy, if you know 
  where to look. I keep telling myself I am going to go back and re-write it. 
  But have I? Not yet. Maybe next week.
</p><p>
  After having mastered most of the basics of perl, and being hounded by my 
  parents to find a job, I got one through a friend, doing what I found 
  exciting, writing perl code! Ever since then I have done most of my scripting 
  in perl. I'll admit, I've dabbled in python, java, and php, but always find 
  myself longing for the simplicity of perl.
</p><p>
  There are lots of more details I can add, but I'll save those for another day...
