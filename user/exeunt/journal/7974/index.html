<p>My Pismo has been working great for me ever since I bought it off a friend. The only problems I've ever had with it are the back flap covering the various ports broke off, it never fully closed anyway, and my covering for the IR lens fell out. I've also never successfully gotten the S-Video to work. These are just minor, to me at least, and it does it's job. Come to think of it, I've never heard the fan next to the processor on the left side ever turn on, unless it's really quiet, in that case, it's good. It never gets really hot, just slightly on bottom.<br/><br/>I've been thinking of upgrading the hard drive from 6 gigs to something more. I do have an external 80 gig firewire drive, but it's klunky, and requires a power cable. I could get a nice small firewire drive that pulls power from the firewire, and then no power cord needed. But for now, it's doing it's job.<br/><br/>It has 192 mb of ram, and it would be nice to max it to it's 512mb limit.<br/><br/>The only other thing I could do to upgrade is the processor. As a G3 400mhz, it does a decent job. Sometimes I wish it had just a bit more horsepower. Today I ran across a few links to <a href="http://www.powerlogix.com">powerlogix</a> and a <a href="http://www.powerlogix.com/products2/bcg4pismo/index.html">service</a> they offer for upgrading it to a G4 500mhz. <a href="http://www.macnn.com/">macnn.com</a> has a <a href="http://reviews.macnn.com/review.php?id=17">reader review</a> on this process, and a few benchmarks. Looks pretty impressive.<br/><br/>The only "drawback" is you send them your laptop, they preform the upgrade, and send it back. Which can be a blessing too, so I don't have to tear my laptop apart, and leave it to someone who has done this before.<br/><br/>Have anyone here had experience with this? Or should I just save my money, and buy a <a href="http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?threadid=11749">rumored</a> <a href="http://www.powerpage.org/story.lasso?newsID=9977">1.2ghz TiBook</a>. I would love to have that, but don't know if I want to spend the money, and save it for something else. Although my Pismo laptop has a pretty decent resell value, so Mac hardware does have a decent return on investment.<br/><br/>Of course, I would like a decent desktop, and keep my Pismo, and possibly upgrade it, and just get a nice Dual G4. :)<br/><br/></p>
