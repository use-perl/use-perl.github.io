<p>A few days ago everything seemed bad, and already it looks much brighter. I've been -of course- very actively chasing jobs the past three days, and it's going rather well. <br><br>
I'm after a position as Team Leader for an ISP-like company in Amsterdam, I'm in the picture as a developer for Tiscali in Utrecht and Arthur James just called me for a Development position in Almere. Some other leads are still pending, so I think it's going well. This is of course strange, because I keep hearing that it's difficult to find a job at the moment. In the US and UK this situation has been going on for a while now, and from what I heard from kudra, who has been looking for a job for a while now in NL, it's quite hard to find something here.<br><br>
Yesterday I signed the contract for the publishing of my book with Manning. I wanted to return the signed copy immediately, but due to jobhunt and painting of the new house for my wife I forgot....something for tomorrow I hope...<br/><br/></p>
