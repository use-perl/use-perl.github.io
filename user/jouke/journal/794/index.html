<p>Wow, it's been a while since I've updated my journal. A lot has happened in the mean time, not in the last place the disasterous attack on the USA. :(<br><br>
I was very happy today to find out that my <a href="http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2001/09/12/wxtutorial1.html">article on wxPerl</a> had been published on Perl.com. I got quite a lot positive responses.<br><br>
I quit my job. I was going nuts fooling myself that I liked the job. I didn't. It's a good company, nice people, but the assignments are boring and not challenging at all. So I quit last monday. I haven't got anything else at the moment. I'm considering several options:
<ul>
<li>Start freelancing again (but it's not a good market right now)</li>
<li>Just find another 9-5 job</li>
<li>Start a company where I can develop software and hardware for the disabled. But that takes time. I'm without work as of October 10, so I probably won't have the time to start it up before that.</li>
</ul>
I talked with <a href="http://www.lunatech.com">Luna Tech</a>. I liked it there, and I might take an offer from them if it's good enough.<br><br>
I've registered pvoice.org. No, it's not a link yet. Move on, there's nothing to see there. I thought it was better to register it before someone else does. When I find the time, I'll update the info on <a href="http://jouke.perlmonk.org">Perlmonk.org</a> and move the pVoice site to pvoice.org.<br><br>
So if you need someone for a Perl job, read my <a href="http://jouke.perlmonk.org/cv.html">CV</a> and give me a call/mail.</p>
