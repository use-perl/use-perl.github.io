<p>Not only a grant from TPF, but also a considerable amount of money from an anonymous donator! It looks like pVoice is getting more support. And that's great news for potential pVoice users!<br /><br />
However, the bad news is that the Dutch taxoffice doesn't like donations to private persons. That is, actually they <b>do</b> like it. They like it so much that they want <b><i>41%</i></b> of all donations. But that's not why the donators give their money, if you're asking me. They want me to use the money for pVoice, not to fund the Dutch government!<br /><br />
There only seems to be one way to avoid taxes on donations. Being a charity. Which means I have to start a foundation, that the taxoffice would recognize as a charity. It will happen too! It does take some effort, but currently I'm working hard to get the 'pVoice Foundation' or as the official name will be 'Stichting pVoice' started.<br />
I contacted potential members of the board, consulted a notary (who is willing to give me a 15% discount on his normal fee), because you need a notary in the Netherlands to start a Foundation, and plans are being made on the way the pVoice Foundation will going to operate.<br /><br />
So in the future donations are tax deductible for the donators and (as long as the donations are less than &euro; 4100) not taxed on the receiving end...
I should go back to coding I think....</p>

I am not sure how would it help you to receive the money in your own pocket if you setup such organization. I guess the Dutch tax authority will ask for its part even then.
<p>
Maybe this is the sign that the European version of TPF should be opened and then you don't need this other organization.
</p><p>
Then this might give you the money somehow on better terms.</p>

Unfortunately that doesn't make a difference. Whenever I receive the money as a private person, the taxoffice comes to take their percentages. If there is a foundation especially for pVoice, then the foundation could spend the money on what is needed without paying me anything. That makes the difference.
