<p>After <a href="http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=352519">fixing the bug </a>I've been working on for months, I continued to finish pVoice 2.1. Except for some non-coding work (like writing the Dutch helpfiles and things like that) it all works now.<br /><br />
I created a standalone executable of this with PAR on my Windows XP system, ran it there and everything worked fine. I then moved the file to my daughter's Win 98 SE machine, and the executable failed to start, giving me an access violation in 7049C8B1.DLL. Now I presume this DLL is somewhere in the PAR generated .exe, but I can't find it. And since it's not giving me any useable information on *what* is actually going wrong I don't know what to do next.<br /><br />
ActiveState's PerlApp isn't very helpful either, because it can't handle <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/jplindstrom/journal/18624">BOM</a> and (afaik) I need it in my preferences dialog (where you can select your language).<br /><br />
Suggestions welcome...</p>

<h2>Is wx compiled with MSLU=1?</h2>

<p>This might be a red herring, but is wxWidgets built to use unicows.dll?</p>

<p>What happens if you run pVoice on your win98 box without PAR?</p>

I intentionally used a non-unicode version of wxPerl to prevent possible problems, if that runs, I'll use a Unicode version, indeed using MSLU=1 and thus the unicows.dll.<br>The problem just became weirder...I set up a Windows 98 SE environment in VMWare (under my XP system), installed pVoice 2.1-to-be there and it works like a charm. Same amount of memory, same amount of harddisk space.<br>Now I must say that the system on which it failed runs Win98SE for 4 consecutive years now, so I'm beginning to think I'll need to do a complete re-install of that system to make sure it's not Windows itself that is having problems...<br>And I've removed the (old) Perl installation from the system because PAR doesn't like it if another Perl version is installed in the PATH...it tends to find the old perl5x.dll before the packaged one...<br> <br>but thanks for the suggestions...
