<p>Thursday morning I spent all my time fixing bugs in the AAC::Pvoice modules, which I needed later that day in my presentation about "pVoice - using your skills to help the disabled". In the beginning of the afternoon I sat in the room where the presentations were, but I hardly heard what anyone was talking about. I don't know what happened, but I've never really been nervous for a presentation. This time I was.<br /><br />
At 16:15 I started my presentation and it didn't go well. While I was doing the presentation I found that I actually tried to tell three stories in one, I rushed over my slides, and of the 20 minutes I had, I needed 35. This is not good. I need to rewrite all of this, and practise before I present it at OSCON. Now I'm even more nervous about that. Not good.<br /><br />
In the evening I had dinner with Autrijus, Chia-liam and friends. We had a lot of fun.<br /><br />
Other random stuff:
<ul>
<li>I had a terrible trip back home.</li>
<li>We had fantastic weather in Southern Germany during the workshop, but Friday morning it started to rain, and it kept raining during the entire trip home.</li>
<li>It's good to be back home again. I missed my girlfriend and children</li>
<li>Sunday I finished the 0.7 version of AAC::Pvoice. The screensizing is now handled correctly (finally), and the modules allow 'normal' mouse control (just click on the icons ma'am), along with one or two switch control. </li>
<li>Now it's time to modify pVoice to support these new input methods.</li>
<li>The pVoice plugin system has now entirely been thought out in my head, so I can build it now</li>
<li>I need to finish the article about the AAC::Pvoice modules (I was supposed to have finished them a week ago), but now that the modules have reached a new version, it won't be much of a problem anymore</li>
</ul>
<i>...and the daytime job is waiting...</i></p>
