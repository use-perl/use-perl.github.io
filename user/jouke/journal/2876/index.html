<p>I finished my slides and examples by 19:30. That's one big load off my mind. I went downstairs to see the first people coming back from the workshop to the hotel. We sat for a while and drank some beers. At 21:30 we wanted something to eat but since the hotel's kitchen closes at that time a few people gathered to find a place to eat in the town. We found a nice Italian restaurant which had good food. 
<br><br>
We just got back (it's 23:30 now) and I just checked my httpd accesslog. I had put the slides of my <a href="http://www.pvoice.org/GPW/index.html">wxPerl tutorial</a> online and mentioned it on #perlmonks to ask some people to have a look at it and give comments. I was happily surprised to see 44 different people had already accessed it. This shows there is a great demand for wxPerl explanation.
<br><br>
Let's hope tomorrow the talk isn't finished too soon. I don't have too many slides, but I expect it will take some time to discuss the examples. Besides I've reserved the last hour for the creation of an application together with the audience. </p>
