<p>In the past year a lot has happened. And regarless my eager to start programming on all kinds of projects (the CPANPLUS wxPerl shell, pVoice and other programs for my daughter), I couldn't force myself to really start working on them.<br><br><br/><br/>But that has finally changed. It has been a long time since I've felt this pleasure in programming. I think I haven't felt this since I left school (which is almost 10 years ago now). <br>
Last week I started working on a page-editor for pVoice. That was something that should have been built a long time ago. If you want to alter pages, images or whatever, you currently have to edit the index-files by hand, copy the images into the right directories and so on. The page-editor I'm building right now takes care of everything for you.<br><br>
And while I was at it, I have almost completely rebuilt pVoice in wxPerl, added the MS Agent for Text To Speech synthesis (sorry Kevin, this was the easiest Dutch TTS to implement), and all this in less than 500 lines of code and code-documentation.<br><br>
I have to admit that I spend <b>every single minute</b> I have working on this. Which means during my lunchbreak at work, when I'm home until I go to bed, and even this morning when I got out of bed I took my laptop and worked for almost an hour on it :)<br><br>
And I Like It!<br><br></p>
