<p>Yesterday I was at a meeting in the rehab-center where my daughter attends her therapies to discuss the way things are now, and the therapy-plans for the near future.<br /><br />
It turns out that my daugher herself is doing fine, but all kinds of things regarding assistive stuff like wheelchairs and such are not going well at all. Since she moved from Rotterdam to Groningen (city up north in NL) the people responsible for actually paying for the wheelchairs, her computer and stuff (the local governments of Rotterdam and Groningen) are arguing who is responsible for what and who should pay for what. Needless to say that there is only one person who is suffering from these 'fights'...<br /><br />
Since the divorce I didn't interfere with this at all, since my ex-wife was supposed to take care of it. But after this meeting I see that at the very least she needs a little help. I don't know if I can make a difference here, but I <i>am</i> going to try to arrange something so that while the municipalities of Rotterdam and Groningen keep arguing, my daughter doesn't suffer from it. Stupid governmental rules!<br /><br />
After the meeting I gave a demo of <a href="http://www.pvoice.org>pVoice</a> 2.0 to Krista's speech therapist. It wasn't finished yet (and still isn't), but apart from a few loose ends it was ready to be shown. The original intention was to show it to more people, but the meeting took too long and they had other things to attend already. But the speech therapist was the most important one to show it to. And she was enthousiastic. She liked what she saw and I'm certain that we'll keep in touch on further improvements.<br /><br />
And then the Sponsoring. I've been trying to get some sponsoring for the development of pVoice software for a few weeks now. I've been sending out emails to trustfunds, software and hardware companies, and although most of them refused, <a href="http://www.activestate.com">ActiveState</a><a href="http://www.pvoice.org/news.html"> said 'yes'</a> and gave me a free license of the Perl Development Kit. Needless to say I'm very happy with their sponsorship!<br />
Most of the organizations that had to decline my request didn't decline because they didn't want to, but because I'm doing all of this as a private person. They want to sponsor some foundation or something. I can understand that. Still I'm trying to figure out a way that I can spend more time on this. Every time I speak with therapists I see that they don't have a clue what kinds of technology is available for disabled children to make their life easier. That's a crying shame. Maybe I <b>should</b> commercialize some of my work to make a living out of it and promote all of the wonderful inventions other people and companies have done. I still think basic things like communication (read pVoice) should remain available for free. But maybe I can develop optional components and try to sell those, and maybe other soft- and hardware to institutions like special schools and rehab-centers...<br /><br />
Still...I don't know...<br /><br /></p>

<p>
  If your laws are anywhere like those of France, that's understandable. Couldn't you simply create a non-profit they could sponsor and that would in turn pay you to work on pVoice?
