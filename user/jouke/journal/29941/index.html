<p>It's pretty hard to make time to work on pVoice it seems. My daytime job has been extremely demanding the past year and it looks like it won't be less demanding any time soon. Besides that, the family life eats up a lot of time too. <br/><br/>Krista has been in the hospital the beginning of this month to have surgery that is meant to repair the shortening of the muscles in her legs, which also caused her back to curve. This has been a painful and stressful operation, and as you can imagine, when your child is in the hospital, you don't get much work done (being a project in your free time, or your regular job).<br/><br/>However, the YAPC::Europe programme committee has accepted all three of my talks, and the more technical of the three talks depends on the work I will be doing in the time remaining until Y::E. I really need to make time now, instead of hoping I will get the time automatically...<br/><br/>this will be hard...</p>

There are people who are inspired and awed by the example you set.  I don't know that I would be as "well adjusted" were I in your shoes.   If I could bend the universe a little bit in your favor I would, but since I can't, here's some karma. Keep up the good work and be well.<br>
