<p>I said to my wife I think I'm being punished or something. She immediately smacked me (I deserved it I guess ;-)  ). I was not being really serious because I don't really believe in immediate punishments by Higher Powers, but the past week I've been sick as hell, crawling over the ground with pain in my stomach, and yesterday I learned (by <i>email</i> of all means) that my boss gave me the sack.
<br><br>
I <b>know</b> I've not been productive. Not at all. But I told my boss I wouldn't be, and he said it'd be OK because he understood about my personal situation. Guess he didn't really understand it, because I was fired because I was not being productive enough.<br><br>
So as of today I am among the large amount of unemployed Perl people.<br><br>
My body is slowly recovering. <br><br>
<i>Will work anywhere for just about anything</i></p>
