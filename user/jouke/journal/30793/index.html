<p>This afternoon I arrived in Birmingham for YAPC::Europe. The flight on the KLM Cityhopper was pleasant and swift, and as it turns out, the weather here is no different than in Holland ;-)<br/><br/>I had thought that immediately after checking into my hotel (the MacDonald Burlington) I could start writing the slides of my talk tomorrow "Accessible Applications in Perl". However, I hadn't even landed yet and the office called to check if I had been able to work out the Unicode bugs in SAP::Rfc with Piers Harding. Last night I had left the office very late while knowing that SAP::Rfc crashes in certain situations (when the last character of a field is a multi-byte unicode character), and I didn't know yet if Piers was able to fix it yet.<br/><br/>So I checked into my hotel, unpacked, opened up the lid of my laptop to find an open wifi hotspot, logged on, mailed Piers, and within minutes we were chatting and testing. At 5:30 (CET, I'm not yet functioning in BST) everything worked, I called the office to tell them, and I could finally start writing slides ;-(<br/><br/>As I write this, I have just finished the last slide (it's 6:30 BST now), but I really need to test it out to see if I have enough to fill the 20 minutes, or maybe even too much...<br/><br/>First off to grab some dinner and then back to the hotel to finish everything.</p>
