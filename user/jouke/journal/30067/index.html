<p>I just sat down, looked at my screen and the only thing I thought was "wow"...<br/><br/>I hadn't thought that I could make such progress in so little time. The module set I'm working on is really getting there now. I can tell you a bit more now what it's supposed to do...<br/><br/>When I started working on pVoice more than 5 years ago, I had a specific problem for a specific person that had to be fixed. Therefore the AAC::Pvoice modules that came out of pVoice, were never really useable for any other type of application, which limited my possibilities quite a bit. Especially since Krista is getting older, and I want to write more 'grown up' applications for her.
The ideal situation would be to have any kind of GUI application accessible for people as limited in their physical abilities as my daughter. And then preferrably without any modifications to the original source code. I realize of course that that's not really possible. <br/><br/>The second best situation is that I could make it as easy as possible for a programmer to adjust their existing GUI applications, so that disabled people can use them. Therefore I'm writing an extension to wxPerl that will /really/ (and then I really mean really) make it easy for a programmer to take any wxPerl application, and make it accessible using only one switch. Or two switches, or four if you like. Or using a touch screen and get extra visible feedback. Or even if you have a visual impairment...then it would be handy if your application started talking to you.<br/><br/>If this subject interests you, and you know how to write wxPerl applications, watch this journal in the time to come. I'll be releasing code soon :)</p>
