<h1>Perl support for Appcelerator Titanium?</h1>

<div class="span8">
<p>I recently started playing with <a href="http://www.appcelerator.com">Appcelerator Titanium</a> or Titanium for short. It's an extremely cool tool that lets you build desktop or mobile apps using standard web technology like HTML, CSS and Javascript. The real coolness of it (to me) is that it also allows the developer to use Ruby, Python and C++ in &lt;script&gt; tags. The really uncool thing is that Perl is not on their radar.<br/><br/>But hey, Titanium is Open Source (Apache license), and the piece of code that makes those language bindings is called <a href="http://github.com/appcelerator/kroll/tree/master">kroll</a>. In this git tree you can see that they've created bindings for Javascript, Ruby, Python, and that they're working on support for PHP. If my C++ skills were better, and I'd know more of Perl's internals, I might have taken a shot at contributing, but I think there are people out there who are better at this...<br/><br/>So if anyone feels up to it, and would want to contribute to this potentially great product, I'd like to see it supporting Perl!</p>

<p>I couldn't even get their titanium installer to work<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:(</p><p>Interestingly, I know C++, a little perl guts, but I'm rather turned off by that apparently, their stuff seems to be in a very, very, early stage. From what I could find easily, the developer docs aren't exactly awesome, the default linux installer for their showcase won't do 64bits, etc. Too bad.</p>

<p>That's too bad. I'm on OSX, and it works like a charm there. I believe I read somewhere that 64bit linux is not yet supported, but I'm not sure about it.</p><p>It is in an early stage, but not very early. Indeed the docs aren't very complete, but hey, how much docs do you need if you can write plain HTML/CSS/Javascript with a little sugar?</p><p>I'm not yet using much of the Titanium-specific API, mostly because of lacking docs, but also because I don't have much need for that part yet...</p>

<p>I did manage to build my own copy of the backend library "kroll". But for me, that still lacks the connection to the actual product they're shipping. And that's what I didn't find much help on.</p><p>So I don't need documentation on how to write a web page. I need documentation on how I can go from "kroll" to $whatever it is they're shipping. Given that I could build the library without much fuss, it seems odd that they don't support 64bit Linux.</p><p>Alas, it's all I have and intend to use in the foreseeable  future, so I'm out. Sorry.</p>

<p>Looks kind of interesting. I have the know-how, but not the time.</p>
