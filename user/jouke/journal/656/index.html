<p>I said before I wanted to become a writer. I guess I'm pretty late to realize that. I'm 29 now, been in economics and computer science, had my own consultancy company and am currently Yet Another Employee at a large Dutch <a href="http://www.2organize.com/uk">webdesign bureau</a>. It's not that I don't like it there, nice cow-orkers, good bosses (2 in fact) who are pretty good in coaching, but there's something I'm missing. I miss the freedom I had when I ran my own business. I miss the challenge of exploring New Mysteries of Perl. I don't learn anything new and I can't decide for myself in which direction I should go.<br><br>
I don't have the illusion I can make a living writing articles and books. I think however that I can extend that feeling I get when I'm writing things by giving Perl training. I've hardly come across any Perl training in the Netherlands, so it might be an idea to become a freelance Perl trainer. Then again, maybe there is a reason why there are so few Perl trainings in the Netherlands. Maybe there's no market...<br><br>
Anyway, one of these days I'll get my definitive answer from Manning whether or not they want to publish my book about GUI Programming with Perl. I wish there was a way to speed up things and get an answer now, but there isn't.<br>
My first (non-technical) article is now finished and will be published on <a href="http://www.perl.com">Perl.com</a>. It's a review of YAPC::Europe and will be put online this week. I'm really excited about it! I immediately took my chance asking Simon Cozens if he would be interested in a series of articles about wxPerl and Win32::GUI that I'm writing anyway, because that's (I think) a good way to research the topics before writing the book. I was already busy writing my "wxPerl: first steps" when I asked Simon. He was enthousiastic! He didn't know about wxPerl, but had heard of wxWindows and wished he knew about it earlier. <br>
That really motivated me more to go on with the article. I have just finished three little sample scripts that show step by step how to create a wxPerl application. <br><br>
wxPerl is really different. It's not comparable with Tk or Gtk, because the way of writing an application is totally different. In Tk and Gtk you define a window, draw widgets on it and start the mainloop. Admitted: they have their own syntax, but Tk and Gtk are fairly similar.<br>
wxPerl on the contrary lets you create a new class that is inherited from Wx::App and lets you extend that. A more Java- or C++ like way of working. Do you want to add a button or a label? Again, create a new derivate from an existing Frame-class, and extend it with that button and label.<br>
It's different. But I'm getting used to it, and must say it feels good. It's more OO than Tk and Gtk.<br><br>
Well, if I continue at this speed you'll probably read about it on Perl.com shortly!</p>
