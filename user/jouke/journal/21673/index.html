<p>It seems like I did release beta 4 too soon. Shortly after the release I received a bugreport that it isn't possible to test the speechoutput from the editwindow anymore. That is just a minor thing and was easily corrected.<br/><br/>However, what bugs me more is that the plugin support wasn't by far what it was supposed to be. I was still developing the first plugins when I released beta 4, and I thought I had it all figured out. I was wrong. The first plugins are ready now and everything seems to work fine now. But I had to make some adjustments in the pVoice code itself, so I'll have to release another beta before people can start using those plugins.<br/><br/>I'll certainly take more time now to test it all and make sure it all works as it should...</p>
