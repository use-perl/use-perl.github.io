<p>Sometimes working alone on a project is good, because you don't have to discuss anything with anyone. I'm the designer, project manager, programmer and release manager, all in one. On the other hand, when I run into any issues, there's nobody who is just as dedicated as me to make it work.<br/><br/>Currently I'm having lots of trouble creating a working pVoice.exe. The issue is described in <a href="http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.par/1962">this posting to the PAR mailinglist</a>.<br/><br/>If anyone is able to shed a light on this issue, any help will be greatly appreciated...</p>

<h2>Pressure</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Beatnik/">Beatnik</a> on 2005-07-14T08:32:00</h3>
I know what you mean.. Switching from work projects to personal projects is totally different. A simple database dump with small tweakings took me about 2 months to do.. No pressure, no deliver data, no boss pushing the enveloppe,<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...<br> <br>I find it hard keeping motivated in a project that has been under development since uhm forever.



<h2>wxPerl = 0.23, PAR 0.89, AS 5.8.7 = bad</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/SuperCruncher/">SuperCruncher</a> on 2005-07-14T08:57:23</h3>
I have been trying to build a wxPerl-based app of mine with PAR 0.89, wxPerl 0.23 and ActivePerl 5.8.7 (most recent build). I have had nothing but crashes and GPFs, both when 'compiling' and trying to run the app.<p>

It has got so bad that I am considering downgrading to my previous set up, but there's just so much work involved in this. The other problem with this is that in order to use a <a href="http://par.perl.org/index.cgi?FAQ" title="perl.org">version of PAR compatible with WinXP</a perl.org>  I need an updated version of <tt>Compress::Zlib</tt>, and ActiveState's absolutely terrible PPM3 (just see the hoop jumping you need to do to install a local file!) can't upgrade this module as it uses it internally. Trying to download the archive and installing the module manually seemed to work, but PPM refused to recognise the new version. Sigh.</p><p>

I sympathise with your problems, but I think downgrading or possibly waiting for a new version of PAR is the only solution.</p>
