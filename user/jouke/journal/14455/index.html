<p>Last night I went to the monthly Amsterdam.pm meeting. Unfortunately my girlfriend was sick, so she couldn't join.<br />
I did a talk on pVoice there. I didn't prepare the talk too well. I used my lunchbreak yesterday to prepare very few slides, but the audience was interested, asked questions and gave useful suggestions, so all in all I think everything went well.<br /><br />
Liz also gave a talk (on iThreads) and (not too surprisingly) again we came to the conclusion that there are more reasons not to use Threads in Perl than there are reasons to do use it...<br /><br />
Mark Overmeer and Jan-Pieter Cornet came up with a useful idea for faster navigation inside pVoice, by using a binary tree and/or a Huffman algorithm. Since I never learned anything about those, they had to do a bit of explanation before I grasped the idea, but apart from some modifications to the basic idea, this looks like something I could implement in a future version of pVoice...<br /><br />
<i>first things first....finishing version 2.1</i></p>
