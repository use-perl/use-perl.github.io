<p>I'm getting tired of Paypal. I've had some issues with it in the past, and now it's annoyance all over again. Someone donated a rather large sum of money to my pVoice paypal account to let me buy a Mac (for a port of pVoice to Mac OS X), and for some vague reason it just didn't come through, and if I understood correctly, the donator only got a partial refund, and some of the money remains at Paypal. That sucks!<br/><br/>I've looked around for alternatives and found <a href="http://www.greenzap.com/join-greenzap.asp?zapid=jouke">Greenzap.com</a>.
It's a brand new service and at the very least it doesn't require you to register with a creditcard before you can fully use all of its services. I can only reccommend it for now (and if you click the link and sign up, you get a $25 bonus from them....which is nice enough by itself)</p>

HI,<br> <br>it appears there's a lot of talk on the web about this lot being a scam group. I'd suggest nochex instead who were setup before paypal was available in europe and are european based.

I'm beginning to think so.  I signed up about 6 hours ago and still have yet to receive my confirmation email.  Smells like email address resellers to me.

My confirmation email was trapped by spam assassin.  Apparently, the web host for the confirmation is in some blacklist used by SpamAssassin, which means they've been around for a while.
<p>
Oh well, the address I gave them is my infinite spam reciever (merlyn@stonehenge.com), but now I won't be giving them any additional things like checking accounts or card numbers.  Thanks for the headsup.</p>

I still haven't received the confirmation email and I even clicked the link to have them resend it last night.  It's funny because I did receive an email telling me to "Go Gold!"  No thanks.  They can unsubscribe me (if they even honor those requests).  Let's just say that I'm glad that I used my public email address.

i can recommend an alternative: www.daopay.com<br/><br/>it's fast, anonymous, no credit card transfers, but payments via phone! a cool philosophy for payments without paypal's risks.
give it a try

<h2>Scam? I don't think so</h2>

Of course it's hard to determine wether or not some site is a scam or not, but I don't think so.<br> <br>GreenZap has been offline for a little while yesterday after I did this journal writeup. That might be related to not sending confirmation mails. I've received confirmationmails of everything I did so far, so that all works well.<br> <br>I've seen the postings about 'GreenZap is a scam' too, mostly coming from the people at 'paypalsucks.com'. They are paranoia. I'm sending my $100 to upgrade to a gold account, and yes, that's a risk, but if every new service is being accused of being a scam, then Paypal will be the only option, and I know for sure they need some competitors...<br> <br>I can't tell you what to do, but for now I'm willing to take the risk.
