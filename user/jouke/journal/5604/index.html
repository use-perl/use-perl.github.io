<p>I've been walking around with this idea for a few years now and I've finally decided to start a new business. This new business will do Perl training in the Netherlands. Is there a market for it? I think so. And I hope so.<br><br>
I know, in other countries Perl seems to become impopular. As far as I've seen myself, in NL it's not as bad as in (for example) the UK or the US. In the past years I've been without a job for only 3 weeks. And I've only presented myself as a Perl programmer.<br><br>
And there are still quite a bit of ISP's, Webdevelopment agencies, but of course also 'normal' companies using Perl for 'normal' tasks. I think it's quite possible they all want some kind of training sooner or later. And looking around, I've only found a few companies giving Perl training. <br><br>
So I decided to give it a shot. Asked some good friends if they were willing to give trainings (and they were) when it all starts, made an estimate of the costs involved (not too much since I can most likely rent computerlabs at the Erasmus University), so if all goes well, the first trainings will start in September.<br><br>
<i>Hey Dutch people! Want a Perl training? ;-)</i></p>
