<p>The second day of tutorials for me consisted mainly of hallway converstations. For a while I was at Rocco's POE tutorial, but I couldn't really concentrate, so I decided to be better off leaving and thinking about my own presentation the next day.<br/><br/>I had short conversations with people like Tim O'Reilly, Damian, Ovid, "cLive;-)", kudra, (Josh)ua, petdance and many more. This is the great part of conferences: the social networking thing. <br/><br/>The evening was fun with Larry's State of the Onion, Paul Graham's talk on Hacking and Damian's 'Life, the Universe and Everything'. I had seen Damian's talk in Germany two years ago, but he has made quite a few changes in it, which make it sound as if it were almost a new talk. It was hilarious (or how you are supposed to spell that anyway).<br/><br/>I tried to get my talk for the third day rescheduled, only to find out that 'The Daily Source' had already gone into print, so there couldn't be any more changes. Instead I found Damian willing to introduce me for my talk, and I've arranged a short talk on pVoice during the 'Works in Progress' session, because I heard many people say "if your talk wouldn't be scheduled with the Lightning talks, I'd surely be there". Now there's a chance for them to go and listen to what I have to say :)<br/><br/>It was about 2am when I went to bed, and 8 when I got up, so I'm quite tired. Still, the talk has been finished on time, and I have enough adrenaline in my vains to stay awake...let's see how it goes...<br/><br/></p>
