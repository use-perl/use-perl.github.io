The waiting days for some of the money I was supposed to get are over. Yesterday I reached a settlement with Web-ICT, the company I worked for in December and January and they paid most of the money they owed me. Not everything, but that's the drawback when you have to settle things. At least I have more money now than I had last week, and quicker than when I was going to fight until the last penny in court.<br><br>
I received the Call for Papers for the German Perl Workshop for next year when I was at YAPC::Europe last week. I don't want to repeat the same talk or tutorial I did before, so now I have to come up quickly with an idea for a talk, because the papers have to be turned in before October 1st. I have some ideas, but they're all short talks and I'd like to do a 3 hour tutorial again....if only I can think of a subject to talk about...</p>
