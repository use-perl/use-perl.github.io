<p>OK, I just updated the photo's page again, adding photo's taken by Frank Ederveen. Wow, what a difference in quality compared to my little cam. But hey, what the heck.<br><br>
I know I've been uncareful logging into use Perl; knowing that my password hasn't been encrypted. However, I only use this password on this site and I have nothing to hide here. Hell, anyone may know this password if they want.<br><br>
We had to start a bit late because JohnPC was late and he was bringing a digital camera to record the keynote speech by Daniel Karrenberg. It will be published on a site somewhere later. This way anyone can hear what he had to say later on.<br><br>
Boy, am I tired. I got to bed after 01:30 and got up at 6. And my children woke me up 4 times in between... :( Children are fun, but not when you're trying to get a bit of sleep ;-).<br><br>
I'm going to talk to Kevin Lenzo later today. He's going to help me to generate syntesized voices for pVoice. I'm really looking forward to it. I've looked into Festival and FestVox before, but I didn't get any further than playing the example voices and doing the TTS (TextToSpeech) stuff. Kevin said something like "It would be fairly simple to implement". I'll see...<br><br>
While I was writing the previous paragraph I was called away and had to do some organizational stuff. Luckily Beatnik and Toadi (from Perlmonks) wanted to keep an eye on my laptop, because things are not safe here. A lot of stuff gets stolen and we're stressing everyone to watch out. But things took longer than I expected and the POE talk by Sky already started when I dropped in and I'm finishing this part during his talk :)<br><br>
I'm not so sophisticated as you may think: I don't have a wireless card in my laptop. So that means all of this is written offline ;-)<br><br>
Tonight we'll have the pubcrawl, so don't expect an update from me tonight. I'll try to keep things up to date during the day, but being part of the organization does not make that easy...</p>
