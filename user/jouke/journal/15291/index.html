<p>...and so little time...<br /><br /><br/><br/>Last week I received a couple of chapters of the second edition of the Panther book. Now I am supposed to review those within two weeks. Doing so is not difficult by itself, but having so many other things on my mind doesn't make it very easy.<br /><br />
I haven't spent much time on pVoice in the past two weeks. Mostly because I was waiting for translations to arrive. Unfortunately I probably over-asked a lot of translators by sending them the helpfiles to translate. On one hand, translators knew that helpfiles were going to have to be translated when they agreed to translate, on the other hand, I think they didn't expect his much...<br />
Now I will release pVoice 2.1 next weekend, with or without the complete translations. I still need to finish some stuff, but it's not that much anymore.<br /><br />
I have to write a few articles on wxPerl<br /><br />
I've been asked to promote pVoice at an exhibition organized by the Dutch knowledge center for ICT and disabilities. This exhibition will happen by the end of November, so there's some time to prepare.<br /><br />
I've also been asked to do a presentation on pVoice for speech pathologists in the North of the Netherlands (Groningen, Friesland and Drenthe) who come together 4 times a year.<br /><br />
Oh, and I need to do my daytime job too :-/<br /><br />
This is a nice try for a todo list....</p>
