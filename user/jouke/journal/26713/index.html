<div class="span8">
<p>Last weekend I received the first patch for pVoice from Mattia Barbon. Finally someone else than just me is actually doing something with the code. It's just a minor patch, but it's a start which makes me very happy.<br/><br/>Work and personal issues have been keeping me from working on pVoice in the past months. I hardly did anything, so I decided I had to make some changes in the plans for the 2.2 release. It's been over a year (even more than 1.5 years) since 2.1 was released, and until I finish 2.2 I can't really release any plugins. I have so many ideas and so many unfinished pieces of code on my harddrive that should really become plugins for pVoice, but until I manage to release 2.2 it's all pretty much worthless vapourware.<br/><br/>Next month I will be speaking about pVoice and other Open Source Assistive Technology at <a href="http://conferences.oreilly.com/eurooscon">Euro OSCON</a>, and I feel that I can't really show up there without at least a newer release of pVoice than what I presented at OSCON last year. The way it looks now, I have a whole weekend (woohoo) to work on pVoice related stuff, and my goal is to have a complete working 2.2 version of pVoice for windows by Sunday night (really, there's not that much to do anymore, I just need to have a quiet place and time to work on it)<br/><br/>After that, I can finally work on the plugin for homecontrol, and other plugins like pStory (formerly a seperate application to listen to books) and pMusic (a mediaplayer). I'm also thinking about ways to use Skype from pVoice, but the useability aspect may be a reason not to start working on it. After all, does the person on the other side of the connection really want to wait minutes until the pVoice user has built a sentence to reply to what he just said? I think not. On the other hand, does someone with a disability really want to be limited to email or instant messaging? We all would want to communicate by speech every now and then (even geeks like us). <br/><br/>If you have any ideas on how to implement some kind of telephony application for typical pVoice users, you're more than welcome to comment on this....<br/><br/></p>
