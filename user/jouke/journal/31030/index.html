<p>This morning I left home around 9am and after a very tiring trip I arrived at my hotel in Brussels around 4pm. I wasn't thinking about EuroOSCON too much yet (more about how to finish pStory), but I had planned to go to the early registration at 5pm.<br/><br/>That was a good thought. I ran into Aron and -o darn I can't remember your name!-. We agreed to see each other again at 6 in front of the Plaza hotel to find a place to eat. When I got back, a lot of people from the EuroFoo were sitting in the lobby so I had to walk in and say hi to at least barbie, kudra, pdcawley, Jesse Vincent, Piers Harding and a few others. Later Jesse, Aron, Karen Pauley and -yes I still can't remember your name- went to the Groote Markt to grab something to eat. We had a very good time talking about anything and everything.<br/><br/>These early meetups always get me in the right mood: there's another conference coming up with many nice talks and lots of interesting people! Let the fun begin :)

<p>(I only watched Highlander again the other day, so couldn't resist that title<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;))
</p><p>The guy you were thinking of was Murray Walker. I'm glad several people have turned up early, as I'll not be able to make the full conference. And it's always nice to hi to people you don't get to see very often.</p>
