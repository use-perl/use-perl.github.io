<p>I'll be attending three conferences this year: the German Perl Workshop, the O'Reilly Open Source Convention and Yet Another Perl Conference Europe.<br /><br />
I realised last week that the German Perl Workshop was less than a month away, and it was just 1.5 months until OSCON! And I hadn't arranged anything yet, so I had to do something. The most important thing was to book a flight to Portland.<br />
That's done. I'll be leaving for Portland the 17th of July from Amsterdam, and my return flight is the 31st. I've also found a hotel that is near the Convention, and a lot cheaper than the conference hotel: "La Quinta Portland Convention Center". I didn't make the reservation yet - Hotels.com will call me back tomorrow to make the reservation final.<br /><br />
I've also booked a hotel for the German Perl Workshop: the Holiday Inn in Winterbach. I'll arrive there the 28th of June and leave the 2nd of July. I will be travelling by train to Germany this year. It's way cheaper than any other form of transportation (from NL anyway). I'll book my train tomorrow.<br /><br />
Todo: 
<ul>
<li>prepare presentations
<li>book train for GPW and hotel for OSCON
<li>arrange talk at Oregon Health and Science University (as good as done)
<li>book flight and hotel for YAPC::Europe
</ul>
<i>...and keep this journal updated...</i></p>
