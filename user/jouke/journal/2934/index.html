<p>Friday was the last day of the German Perl Workshop. The whole workshop was great fun. Good atmosphere, nice people, good talks, what more could you wish for?<br><br>
I had my <a href="http://www.pvoice.org/GPW/index.html">slides for my wxPerl tutorial</a> ready just on time, and was a little worried if I could fill the whole three hours. It turned out that I had just enough time. Exactly three hours was what it took.<br>
The last hour or so I spent with the class creating an example application. I immediately made it clear I don't know everything about wxPerl. There were some things the class wanted to implement that I didn't know how to do. Which left me with some homework to do to find it out and put it online so everyone can find the results.<br>
Nevertheless people were interested and most of them were quite enthousiastic. Some things I should investigate further (because there were quite some questions about it that I couldn't answer) concern the wxValidator and wxLayoutConstraints. And for my own interest I should dive deeper into the Device Context and printing stuff.<br><br>
Tonight I'll be back behind my laptop to finish the first chapter of my book.</p>
