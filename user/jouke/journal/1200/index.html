<p>It's a weird thing. I don't know why I mentioned my divorce in my latest journal. Probably I had to just acknowledge that it is reality and write it down in public somewhere. And I did. I admit I was afraid that it would cause some people to avoid me for doing it. That was silly of course. <br><br>
Actually these times are times when you get to recognize your friends. Quite a lot of people have mailed me, /msg'd me on IRC or on <a href="http://www.perlmonks.org">PerlMonks</a> to express their support. It really helped me.<br><br>
So all of this means that I'm *not* moving :) Not in the forseeable future. Although I would have to, because living in such a large house all by myself is weird, especially when 90% of all the stuff my wife and I collected over the years will move with her. That will leave a very empty house. But don't pity me. We made the dicision together, and we're happy that we did.<br><br>
What am I doing? This is a Use Perl journal! I'm writing about my personal life again. Oh well...it's cheaper than therapy ;-).</p>
