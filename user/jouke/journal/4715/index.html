<p>Yesterday Pim Fortuyn got shot. It seems like it's news all over the world, so you probably heard about it. <br><br>
This man had a funny way of attracting voters. He shouted all kinds of things a LOT of people agreed with. The government had made a mess of the country in the past few years and he could tell just what was wrong. And everyone nodded. He said that the unsafe feeling people had when walking on the streets had to be dealt with. And everyone nodded. He said the way all politicans tried to find compromises for everything made the politics uncolourful. And everyone nodded. Then he said that the islam was an idiotic religion. And some people nodded, some people thought 'Hey he knows what he's saying all the other times, now he's probably right again', and others dispised him. Then he said the first amendment (the anti-discrimination amendment) should disappear. That cost him some votes, but carefully focussing the voters attention to other issues made most people almost forget that he said that.<br><br>
Probably some didn't forget. At least one. Yesterday he got shot in the head, the neck and the chest. <br><br>
You could almost think I think that that's ok. But I don't. Politicans should have the right to say what they think. Even if they are wrong. What I think is NOT ok though is that he's worldnews now. Every single news broadcast here in the Netherlands is devoted to him and his life. Every newspaper is full of what he had to say. I think the person who killed him reached the opposite effect of what he had in mind.<br><br>
Pim Fortuyn was a man with dangerous ideas, but no-one deserves it to be killed<br><br><br/><br/><i>It's a black day for democracy.</i></p>
