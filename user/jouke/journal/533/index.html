<p>It's almost YAPC time now. Tomorrow evening we'll have our last YAPC meeting, which will probably be a listing of "Oh, I forgot that..how are we going to tell people that?" or "Hey, I heard that speaker X is not coming....how do we fill that time?". We can't do much about it anymore. <br/><br/>Wednesday will be a busy day. Most of us are going to the HS Holland to do networking stuff, moving chairs, setting everything up, etc. From 16:00h people can pre-register. I will be there from around 14:00 I hope. I hope I can make it to the conference at all. Some nasty personal things have come up which could prevent me from going at all. I hope things will work out right.<br/><br/>I haven't done ANY perl this weekend :( And I was really looking forward to having some time to hack my way to a new version of pVoice. Don't know yet what pVoice is? Take a look at my homepage and you'll know. Basically it's a speechapplication for disabled children. I will probably mention it more in later journals.<br/><br/>Oh, yeah...I almost forgot. I got a moderately positive response from Manning about my proposal to write a book for them. The publisher is away for a few days, but he'll get in touch with me after August 3. I hope that he'll accept my idea...</p>
