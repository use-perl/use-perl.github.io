<p>By the end of this month my current contract ends. I'm quite annoyed by not having received the greater part of my money for it yet, but I hope all will be OK this week.<br><br>
February 1st I'll start an exciting new job at <a href="http://www.interapy.nl">Interapy</a>. This company develops a system that treats psychological deseases like burnouts and traumas. It's written in Perl of course. I have a hard time believing that this kind of treatment (by a computer) really works, but it's tested by the University of Amsterdam and some papers on it in important magazines confirm it, so it must be good.<br><br>
It's nice to do something completely different than building Yet Another Website Backend...<br><br>
Next month I'll be at the German Perl Workshop, speaking about pVoice and giving a tutorial on <a href="http://wxperl.sourceforge.net">wxPerl</a>, which means I really have to start preparing all this. I have to anyway, because my publisher expects the first chapter by that time too. I think I'll manage to prepare the talks on time, but it's going to be hard to write the first chapter of the book on time.<br><br>
Earlier this month I visited <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/briac">briac</a> in Paris, where we had a meeting of a small delegation of the <a href="http://www.mongueurs.fr">Paris Perl Mongers</a>. It was nice, but hard to follow, because they have a tendency to fall back to French and keep talking in French....oh well, we had a good time and nice food :)<br><br></p>
