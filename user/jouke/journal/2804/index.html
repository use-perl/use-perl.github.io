<p>This afternoon I will leave for the German Perl Workshop. I'm still at work right now, and I'm really looking forward to GPW. So much actually that I'm pretty much procrastinating now ;-) <br><br>
But I'm getting a bit nervous. Except for the fact that I have 2 useable paragraphs of my book-to-be-written, a Perl.com article, a near-finished second tutorial for Perl.com and an outline I sent in to the organization of GPW, I have nothing yet for my wxPerl tutorial. I have to write the slides real soon now.<br><br>
The pVoice talk I'm also giving there will be pretty much the same as the one I gave at YAPC::Europe last year. Not too much has changed since then, and since there weren't too many people attending my talk there, it will still be news to them probably. I still have those slides and I can give a demo of the application.<br><br>
But I have tonight in my hotel to prepare the talks, I have my pVoice talk late in the afternoon tomorrow, so I have the larger part of the day preparing that one, I have thursday to prepare the tutorial (all day and evening) and I have to give the tutorial no earlier than 9 AM on Friday. That leaves some time. But if it's enough? I hope so....<br><br>
I'll keep you updated...</p>
