<p>After spending a week at the La Quinta Convention Center, I've now arrived at the Marriott Downtown hotel. The room kind of scared me. We're actually supposed to sleep there with 4 people, but the room (and the individual beds) is smaller than the one I had at the La Quinta.<br/><br/>Wireless coverage is reasonable. I don't seem to be able to connect to anything at my hotelroom, but the lobby has numerous different networks I can connect to. However, I don't seem to be able to connect to an SMTP server (which is not that big of a problem since I can ssh to my server and send mail from there), nor can I connect to an irc server. 
It's at the very least <b>much</b> better than the La Quinta, which lacked all sorts of internet access. I don't <b>have</b> to go to the Pioneer Square to check my mail...<br/><br/>It's again extremely hot today. About 100F. Yesterday I didn't really have a problem with the heat (it was 102 yesterday), but today it seems like the first day has worn me out. I'm staying in today to modify some slides an work on some code...<br/><br/><i>more later...</i></p>
