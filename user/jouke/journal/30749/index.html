<p>Why is it always so that I start with my presentations on the last days before conferences? This time I think it's not too difficult to explain: I only sent in my proposals on the last day, and expected to present only my pVoice presentation. However, all three presentations were accepted, and I had to prepare my 'Accessible applications in Perl', 'pVoice' and 'Introduction to wxPerl' talks. <br/><br/>Since then, work was extremely demanding, and when my holiday started, I got caught up with doing stuff with my kids so much, that there wasn't any time left to do anything else. Although I must say that part of that was writing a new application for Krista, based upon my new OA module, which of course I can use for my first presentation.<br/><br/>This Sunday, my kids will return to their mother, Monday will be a day at the office in Amsterdam, and Tuesday I'll be leaving for Birmingham already. If I weren't going to work with Piers Harding tonight to make sure the new Unicode compatible SAP::Rfc works for Booking.com, and I wasn't going to visit my sister for her birthday on Saturday (with the whole family of course), who lives in the other side of the country, I could say I have enough time to work on my presentations. <br/><br/>I have to really, really get it done in the spare moments I have left or else....<br/><br/></p>

<p>Yeah. I know how you feel. Those bastards in birmingham.pm accepted all of my proposals too<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>

<p>I'm still only about halfway through writing my tutorial.</p>

I'll start writing my slides on the night of August 31st, for 2 talks on the final day. I'm pretty sure I could do that because that's what I do regularly in conferences<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)
