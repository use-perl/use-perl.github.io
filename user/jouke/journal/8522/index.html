<div class="span8">
<p>Today I finished <a href="http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node=pType%201.0c">pType 1.0c</a>. pType is a new application I wrote for my daughter -and in fact all severly disabled children who learn to write and can't speak. It's an on-screen keyboard with speech-synthesis.<br><br>
It unfortunately only runs on Win32. That's because it uses Win32::MSAgent (for speech-synthesis) and Win32::API for a DLL it uses to communicate with the Adremo electric wheelchair. I added multi-linguality and full configurability with this version, and made a compiled version available for download on my <a href="http://www.pvoice.org">website</a> with a nice installer around it so it installs very easy on all kinds of Win32 systems.<br><br>
The reason why I'm using Win32::MSAgent for speechsynthesis is simple: it's the only free Text To Speech system that offers so many different languages - and in fact the only one offering proper Dutch language support.<br><br>
The application shows how pVoice 2.0 is going to be: configurable, user-friendly and full-featured...<br><br>
<i>back to work on pVoice then...</i></p>

<h2>Congratulations - pType sounds great!</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/SuperCruncher/">SuperCruncher</a> on 2002-10-25T21:47:15</h3>
Jouke, pType sounds like a great program--it's really good (and I'm sure it must be satisfying as well) to be able to use your skills on such a worthwhile cause. It's even better that although your main reason for developing this program was for your daughter, you are distributing the application free of charge so others can benefit too.<p>As a nice side-effect, you are sharing a lot of your skills and knowledge on the wxPerl mailing list. Your talk at YAPC::Europe on wxPerl was great too.</p><p>
Could you make some screenshots of the program available? I'd like to see what it looks like--I don't think I will install it as I don't really have a need for the program.</p>
