<p>Wow, this has been some day. I just looked over the photo's I took and put <a href="http://jouke.perlmonk.org/YAPC/index.html">online</a> and thought several times: hey..this wasn't today...that was yesterday. But no, this day was feeling like two days. A lot has happened.<br><br>
The overall idea I'm getting is that everything goes well. Unfortunately they're very busy reconstructing the building we're having the conference in. In $room[2] there has been some noise during the talks today, but from what I've heard, other rooms didn't have any problems like that.<br><br>
The morning started with registration, and a lot of people came in too late to get a glimpse of Kevin Lenzo's hello-talk, where he talked some more about the cooperation between YAS, PerlMonks and Perl Mongers. He said that you probably won't notice the merge, but there might come some improvements along the way. <br><br>
At 9:30 the tuturialday started and I had to go to $room[2] where the GUI talks were being held. I was appointed as session chair to introduce speakers (which is hard since I didn't know the guys until 5 minutes before they were expected to start ;-)  ) and I had to keep an eye out for problems or other things that should be solved.<br><br>
The Tk talk by Mark Overmeer was interesting, but I expected to hear more about Tk itself. His talk was more about integration of Tk with your existing environments, so it also included things like XS, Inline::C, pack/unpack and so on. I was mainly interested in the advanced features of Tk, which were unfortunately only covered in the very last part of the tutorial, where we were creating composite widgets.<br><br>
After the lunchbreak -where I had a nice talk with some PerlMonks- we continued with a Gtk tutorial by Redvers Davies. It was a good tutorial, and in the second half of it he started to build an application along with the attendees of his talk to facilitate the action on Saturday. A very good idea (from Greg McCarroll in fact) that showed the things you come across when you're writing your own Gtk programs.<br><br>
Unfortunately this morning my camera "broke down". At least, that was what I thought. In fact I was under the impression that my (only recently bought) camera was recharging itself every time I attached the AC adaptor. Which it doesn't. It just contains an old-fashioned non-rechargable battery that was used up. So I rushed into the shop this afternoon and bought two new batteries. And I immediately started shooting more pictures.<br><br>
At 18:30 the speakers and crew left for the Speakers Dinner. That was big fun and good food at a Libanese restaurant in Amsterdam. I've taken quite a lot of pictures there (I know, I annoyed many of you, and will continue to do so these days ;-)  ), which you can find also on the <a href="http://195.38.233.125/YAPC/index.html">photo's page</a><br><br>
If you know any of the names I didn't fill in, please send me a mail or /msg me at PerlMonks, because I'd like to have the subscripts as complete as possible...<br><br>
Well, it's 01:07 now. I just prepared my welcome talk for tomorrow morning at 9, uploaded the photo's, updated this journal. I think it's about time I go to sleep. The alarmclock will go off at 06:00...AAAARRRGGHHH!!!</p>
