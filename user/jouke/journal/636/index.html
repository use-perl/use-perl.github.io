<p>Many people I've heard of are going to HAL this weekend. I'm beginning to feel like I'm going to miss something not being there. But then again, I've got other things on my mind. <br><br>
Yesterday evening we had an Amsterdam.pm meeting. Quite funny that only a few of the regular group showed up and quite a bit more people attended who were at the YAPC last weekend. Briac from Paris, Some Germans and a few London.pm-ers, among who the founder of Amsterdam.pm, Leon Brocard. We had an interesting talk about a problem Johan Vromans mentioned: how do you send a JaPH through SMS when you don't have lowercase letters? Abigail, H. Merijn Brandt and others tried to solve it and eventually posted the solution on the mailinglist. There was only one thing to be solved.

I got a very nice response from Manning about my bookproposal. The publisher decided to further investigate the possibilities and will let some reviewers take a look at it. <br>
However, I decided to write the book anyway. The working title I have in mind now is "GUI Programming with Perl". Oh, no, not Yet Another Tk Book, but a book covering Tk, Gtk, Win32::GUI and wxPerl. You might never have heard of wxPerl. It's a very nice development based upon wxWindows, which is a C++ library for GUI programming on Windows, X, and Mac. wxPerl looks very promising, but lacks proper documentation. <br><br>
Well, enough for today. I'll annoy you later....</p>
