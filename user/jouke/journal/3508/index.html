<p>That's the question...I was very happy for <a href="/user/davorg">davorg</a> that his tutorial has been accepted for TPC, but I'm sooooooo curious about the tutorial I submitted....will it be accepted or not....I can't wait!!<br><br>
I'm not a very patient guy...I know that. If there is something to know, I want to know it immediately and not wait for days or weeks. But in this case there's nothing I can do but wait :(.<br><br>
Another big change in my life: my son will be living with me for the next few weeks. The kids have been really naughty (I don't know if 'naughty' is the correct word...I think it's an understatement) since my wife and I divorced. And since they were experimenting with matches and candles a few nights ago and almost set the house on fire, my ex-wife and I decided it had to stop. So my son will be living with me, the youngest girl will be living with my in-laws and the eldest stays with my wife. It's quite hard to make such a decision. <br>The best thing you think there is for the children is to keep them together, and let them experience as much stability as possible under these circumstances. But we think we should keep safety in mind here and by letting them experiment with fire and maybe cause them to kill people is worse than seperating them now.<br><br>
<i>We'll see how it works out....</i></p>
