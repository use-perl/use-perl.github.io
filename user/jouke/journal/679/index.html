<p>Friday I got a prompt reply from Manning. They sent me the results of two of the four reviewers. The other two aren't in yet.<br><br>
The first was from Jasmine Merced (I believe I read her same in relation to the Perl Archive...), who was *very* enthousiastic about my proposal, the other one was from Mike Stok, who obviously didn't need a GUI book, but I he didn't really have objections. <br><br>
I'll send Manning another mail asking when the other two will be in. I just want to know where I'm standing. Currently I'm nowhere. Err...at the office maybe....but I still don't know where my book will be published.<br><br>
Friday was also my first day on IRC. OK, I might have tried IRC once or twice before. But I didn't really try then. Now I'm at #perl on Rhizomatic.net and Dal.net, and also on #perlmonks on slashnet.org. I like it. I think I'll stay this time...<br><br></p>
