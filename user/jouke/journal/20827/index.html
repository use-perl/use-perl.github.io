<p>At OSCON I someone who attended my pVoice talk offered to improve the online help of pVoice. She gave me her businesscard and said she'd be in touch. Unfortunately I lost the businesscard, and I can't remember her name. Since she hasn't contacted me yet, I think I'll have to get back to the 'old-fashioned' way of improving the online help: Do It Myself :-/<br/><br/>The online help that comes with pVoice was written for pVoice 2.1. The 2 betas that I released since then changed quite a few things, and also the screenshots have to be renewed.<br/><br/>This is the part I don't like about development. Writing userdocumentation. But I realise that it's an unavoidable evil. People can figure out how to use simple programs, but pVoice isn't that simple anymore. They need documentation. People are even asking for a manual! That will be even more work.<br/><br/>So, if you're the one soul on this planet who likes writing userdocumentation and you'd like to get involved in the pVoice project....send me an email...<br/><br/></p>
