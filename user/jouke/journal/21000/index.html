<p>Lately more and more 'professionals' like Speech Pathologists, Occupational Therapists and the like are interested in pVoice. A good example is what happened to me this week. Two people from a major organization that works with people suffering Mental Retardation came to visit me at home to get a demonstration of pVoice. They're working on a project where they are going to use more multimedia and assistive technology for these clients. They see pVoice as something that almost exactly meets their needs when it comes to Augmentative and Assistive Communication (AAC). If they are really going to decide to use pVoice as their preferred platform, that would be a major success-story of course!<br/><br/>In Holland I also see that people are starting to (at least) know about pVoice. I had a phone conversation with someone from <a href="http://www.kompagne">RDG Kompagne</a>, the largest Dutch distributor of Assistive Technology about the 'Mercury' (see my previous journal entry) to get a bit more information. The guy asked me if Krista would be using Symbol for Windows. I responded with "no, she uses pVoice", "ah" he said "that's possible too of course". A year ago nobody there had heard of pVoice...<br/><br/>All in all, pVoice is slowly gaining on reputation. Now, of course that feels good because I'm the author. I'm not going to lie about that. But it's also a good sign for the growing confidence in Open Source software...</p>
