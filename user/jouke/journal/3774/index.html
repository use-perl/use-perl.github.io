<h1>Job interview</h1>

<div class="span8">
<p>This morning I had an interview for a new assignment at the Technical University of Delft. If I get the job (which I will hear tomorrow) I'll be OK for at least 6 months, maybe for a year even!<br><br>
The question I get at every jobinterview the last few times is if I think the job is interesting enough for me. They all think I'm overqualified when they browse through my <a href="http://jouke.perlmonk.org/cv.html">resume</a>. I'm not such a great programmer. Sure, I have some experience and I know my Perl rather well, but it's beginning to become a disadvantage to have so much experience. They think I'll lose interest in the job, wanting more, or maybe they think I'm too expensive (that might be true, but why do they want to interview me in the first place....)<br><br>
Oh, well, I'll see. I came back here at Interapy and I was asked immediately when that new assignment would start. That would be the 15th of April and I saw a face that was not too happy not being able to extend my current contract longer than that. Too bad for them then. They should just have indicated earlier that they would extend further than the 8th of April which is still the current end-date.<br><br>
<i>to have a week off or not to have a week off....that's the question</i></p>

<h2>A Book!</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/darobin/">darobin</a> on 2002-03-26T14:55:04</h3>
<p>
  Great! I had no idea that that book was in preparation, please keep us posted as a growing number of people are interested in Perl GUIs.
</p>

<p>
  Good luck with the job interview, I know how you feel<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)
