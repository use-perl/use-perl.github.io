<div class="span8">
<p>Last week I sent an email to my editor saying that I again could not meet the deadlines they had given me. And they have been very, very kind to me so far, but looking at my life, my commuting hours, my eagerness to write a new version of pVoice for my daughter and the little time that leaves me for writing I thought it would be only fair to let them decide whether or not <a href="http://www.manning.com">they</a> still want me to write the book or not.<br><br>
I expected no less than to be thanked for the idea of the book and another author to take over the writing. But I got a very kind email saying that they want me to write it and that they won't be looking for other authors instead of or in cooperation with me.<br><br>
This was a very pleasant surprise to me. <br><br>
If the interview I'll have tomorrow afternoon goes well, I'll be working in Delft in two weeks from now, which largely decreases my commuting time from at least 2 hours a day to some 30 minutes a day. That leaves me more time to develop pVoice (which has my highest priority now) and to write the book.<br><br>
<i>keeping my fingers crossed...</i></p>

<h2>What's the latest on the book?</h2>

I'd be very interested in reading that book you've mentioned in your journal.  Is that still in the works?<br> <br>
