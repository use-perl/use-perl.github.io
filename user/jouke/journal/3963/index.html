<p>It would have taken me some 40 minutes to get to the interview from the office I'm working currently. I left 60 minutes before I had to be there. And then an accident happened some 100 meters before me and the complete A4 was blocked for more than one hour.<br><br>
So I arrived almost an hour late. Luckily I had my cellphone with me so I was able to call the people on time to explain that I wasn't able to be there on time. They understood the situation and made a new appointment for this Monday.<br><br>
Needless to say that it still ruined my day because I'm still not sure whether or not I have the job. I am told however that the reason for the second interview was to figure out if there was the 'right chemistry' between the boss and me. If that's the only issue I think I'm OK.<br><br>
Oh, and I've stopped wearing ties to interviews a long time ago. I make sure I have a decent haircut, I'm shaved and that I don't smell. I won't wear a tie on the job, so I won't let people get the impression I'm a tie-wearing guy. Neither will I wear a suit. I have plenty of ties and suits. That's not the problem. I just don't wear them to work and refuse to wear them to interviews. They have to take me as I am. If that's not good enough, then it's a pity for them.<br><br>
OK, I admit it also depends on the job. Were I applying for a project- or peoplemanagement job or as a consultant, I would wear a suit, but that's because I would wear that on those kinds of jobs. But as a programmer you don't need a tie or suit. That's my opinion at least.<br><br>
<i>now I have to get ready for the third time :(</i></p>

One of the things I'm most proud of is that I've never owned a suit<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
<p>
I wear jeans and a t-shirt to work. I sometimes shave. I sometimes get in before 9:30am too.</p>
