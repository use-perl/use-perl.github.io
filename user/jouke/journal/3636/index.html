<p>While I didn't really expect it, I certainly hoped to be chosen to speak at TPC. But since everyone has their confirmations and from this time on only 'condolances' will be sent out and I haven't heard a thing yet, I expect to receive a condolance email one of these days.<br><br>
But that does not mean I won't come to TPC. I'm now figuring out how much (much!) it will cost me to go there and make it into an extended vacation. I want to take my girlfriend with me so it'll cost me a bit (!) more...<br><br>

<p>The hotel in San Diego has you prisoner and doesn't let you forget it for a moment since nothing is really within a reasonable walking distance. Extortion comes to mind. I took a dirt cheap Southwest flight, split the cost of the room, didn't have to pay for the conference and didn't expense any meals and *still* expensed $1500.00 to the company. Be sure to get the West tower if you book your hotel room early. And bring your Visa card as these guys don't accept perl in payment.</p>
