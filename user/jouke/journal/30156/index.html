<p>This striked me as quite a surprise. A Wx::MenuItem and also a Wx::Menu is not a subclass of Wx::Window. This means you can't query a menu's position, nor its size. Since that's not possible, I can't draw a box around a selected menu item to indicate (for a switch user) that it's selected.<br/><br/>Quite a disappointment, and I have no clue whatsoever how to solve it. I've dug in the wxWidgets sources, and it uses the platform-specific calls to create window menus, so there's no easy way to get around this.<br/><br/>I'm afraid I'm left with only two choices: either code my own menus and replace the wxWidget's menus (which is not an appealing option), or I'll drop the accessibility of menus (not attractive either).<br/><br/>Suggestions welcome!

<h2>Can you do owner-drawn menus?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/bart/">bart</a> on 2006-07-04T09:18:28</h3>
I'm not a Wx user myself, and I find the docs on CPAN pretty sparse... but I wonder if it is possible to use owner-drawn menus. All I could find for docs about those is for <a href="http://www.wxpython.org/docs/api/wx.MenuItem-class.html" title="wxpython.org">wxPython</a wxpython.org>. That shows that Wx knows the concept  at least, on Windows.
<p>You don't really need the absolute position on the screen, all you need is a drawing area, AKA a canvas. That needn't have a known absolute position on the screen, as long as the underlying GUI library knows where to draw it.</p>

Owner drawn is probably (I've looked at it, but can't say I grasp all of it yet) still the same as drawing your own menus. Which automatically means sacrificing the native OS look of your menus.<br><br>What I need is a menu, and a menuitem that "owns" its position and size. The purpose of it all is to be able to draw a box around it on the screen to indicate what you're about to select (for the people who can't use a mouse, but use switches).<br>

<h2>the direct (but not necessarily fastest) route?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jhi/">jhi</a> on 2006-07-04T13:38:50</h3>
How about explaining the problem to WxWidgets people, in the form of an enhancement request?<br>

Of course that is an option. However, I don't expect much of that, since it's an "enhancement" that is only useful in my specific situation. Why else would you want to know where a menu item exists on the screen?<br><br>wxWidgets is of course a generic, platform independent GUI toolkit, being (in lots of cases) a wrapper around platform-specific calls. Menus are supported on all platforms, and therefore they call the platform-specific API to draw a menu somewhere. If the platform doesn't provide that information, the whole "menu handling" should be rewritten...I think it's too much hassle for an audience that's not large enough...<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...but still I'll consider asking<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)<br>
