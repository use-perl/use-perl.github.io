<p>Yesterday was fun. <br/><br/>In the morning I finished up my slides and added some new features to pVoice. It's now possible to use pVoice with only one switch. Of course, this had already mainly been covered in AAC::Pvoice, but pVoice itself didn't support it yet. I had to make some minor changes to AAC::Pvoice to be able to switch between one switch, two switch and touchscreen operation in one pVoice session. It turned out that when you change the setting from one switch to something else, the timer that invoked the automatic scanning kept running and couldn't be stopped, because AAC::Pvoice::Input thought that the <b>current</b> setting wasn't one-switch. It resulted in a segfault no less...and no errormessage. Well, it's been fixed now.<br/><br/>The presentation went well. It was located at the Child Development Rehabilitation Center (CDRC). There were only about 10 attendees, which was mildly disappointing. But I always think that one interested attendee is better than 100 sleeping ones. In this case, all 10 were very interested.
I think the simplicity of pVoice, and the support for multiple input devices along with the multi-linguality of it, and the fact that pVoice is free, impressed the audience. Hopefully they're going to try out pVoice in their professional situation.<br/><br/>One of the attendees turned out to be someone I vaguely knew. It's a Dutch scientist working on Speech technology, called Esther Klabbers. We once exchanged some emails about a Dutch implementation of Festival.
Anyway, she invited me to have a drink afterwards. We had a lot of fun, a little too many beers, and after we picked up her boyfriend, we had some yummy Japanese food.<br/><br/>She also invited me to come over to her faculty to do the presentation again tomorrow (Friday) for her colleagues. I'm really looking forward to it.<br/><br/>This afternoon I'll be trying to act like a real tourist and have a real good look around in the Portland area. I'll take my camera and try to shoot a bit more pictures than I did so far.<br/><br/>the latest changes to pVoice and AAC::Pvoice have been committed to cvs, so if you want to take a look, check it out. More info on the cvs repository can be found at http://opensource.pvoice.org.</p>
