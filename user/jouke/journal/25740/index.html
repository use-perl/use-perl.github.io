<p>Thanks to a generous donation I was able to buy an iBook (second hand) a little while ago. The reason for this was to develop a Mac OS X version of pVoice. However, from day two I got strange errors, the machine locked up, and I got the feeling something was wrong with it. Indeed, it turned out that the harddrive was broken.<br/><br/>Of course harddisks are replaceable. But it's not a trivial task to replace a harddrive for a notebook, and the iBook's harddrive is really hidden behind covers and lots, lots of screws. I ordered a Samsung 80GB 2.5" harddisk (5400rpm) to replace the standard 20GB (4200rpm) harddisk that comes with the G3 model of my iBook.<br/><br/>It took me all morning, lots of sweat and swearing, but I did it! I used the guides that <a href="http://gamoe.net/Notebook/index.php?itemid=44">this page refers to</a>. There were four screws that were really, really stuck and wouldn't come out, but after lots of force, they did. The rest was a breeze. <br/><br/>Now, I'm re-installing the machine (from scratch of course), and it's really much faster than it was before (of course, this harddrive is 5400rpm instead of 4200rpm, and has a 8mb cache instead of the 2mb the old drive had).<br/><br/>I'm look iooking forward to using the machine...without strange errors this time please...<br/><br/></p>
