<p>Now that the AAC::Pvoice modules are released on CPAN, I think some explanation is needed...<br /><br >
AAC does not indicate it has something to do with Apple's audio format, it stands for Augmentive and Assistive Computing. In other words: software (and hardware) that assists people with disabilities in their every day life. I thought a top-level namespace for this subject was appropiate.<br />
I chose 'AAC::Pvoice' because the modules are the heart of pVoice and similar applications. I just couldn't come up with a better name for the modules.<br /><br />
I recently wrote <a href="http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=348135">pMusic</a>. pMusic is an MP3 player based upon those AAC::Pvoice modules. It shows how easy it is to come up with some function and make it accessible for someone who is only able to operate two buttons (left and right mouseclick or a device that generates those). Apart from <a href="http://www.pvoice.org">pVoice</a> itself, this is the first application that uses those modules. Now you can write your own :)<br /><br />
I plan to speak at the German Perl Workshop, YAPC::Europe (hopefully, if they accept my talk) and OSCON on how you can create your own applications with these modules, or maybe even create a whole new framework yourself.<br /><br />
The modules run fine on Win32 platforms, but I have to do some tweaking to make it all work like it should on other platforms. I tried it myself, and although the module installs, the display isn't quite what I expected.<br />
If you want to make it work on Linux (or other platforms): patches welcome!</p>
