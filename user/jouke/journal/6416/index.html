<p>...getting better all the time...<br><br>
Last week I finally got paid for some work I did in April, and this week I expect the payment of the work I did in May. With some help from the people I worked with in February, March and the first week of April I might even get my money from March and April.<br><br>
People say money does not make you happy, but living without it can certainly make you unhappy.<br><br>
I'm still content with the work I'm doing right now for the <a href="http://www.library.tudelft.nl">Library of the Technical University in Delft</a>. I do regret however very much that I won't be able to attend OSCON and had to cancel my entire vacation in the States I had planned.<br><br>
Furthermore I'm starting up a Perl Training business in NL. I had this plan for a long time, and it finally reached the status of starting it up. I've found <a href="~davorg">Dave Cross</a>, <a href="~darobin">Robin Berjon</a> and some others willing to do some training for me, and I'll be giving some of the courses myself.<br><br>
<i>Now all I have to do is to find some clients...</i></p>
