<p><p>Last year in a sudden fit of madness, I went and started talking to a publisher in Japan, asking if I could write a book about Perl.</p>

<p>Well, there was a brief moment of no activity, some crazy time trying to move my company to a new office, and then a stormy winter where I kept writing and writing and writing...</p>

<p>and finally, my first book, "<a href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/4798119172">Introduction to Modern Perl</a>" is coming out this next week. I got the first printed version today. yey. </p>

<p>For this book, we decided to aim solely on the intermediate level perl programmer. So there's almost no talk about syntax. Lots of stuff about writing classes using Moose, job queues, profiling, debugging, performance tuning, etc. Basically we included pieces of material that we want our colleagues to have when working on a project together.</p>

<p>This is part of the material that we'd like to promote when Japan Perl Association comes alive. We want to teach people how to be efficient using perl. To that end, I think this book's going to be a pretty good intro, and I'm pretty proud I took the opportunity.</p>

<p>The only thing is... it's in Japanese. So... who's writing the English version?</p></p>

<h2>Nice!</h2>

<p>Sounds really good; I'll get a copy when I'm back in Japan. Perl in Japan truly is interesting...</p>



<h2>why not in English?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/systems/">systems</a> on 2009-02-03T11:46:56</h3>
I am sure it would have helped sell more copies!

<p> <i>(Oops, clicked the wrong "Reply" button before...)</i> </p><p>Maybe because this is for Japan and the Japanese Perl Association? English doesn't get you all that far in Japan.</p>
