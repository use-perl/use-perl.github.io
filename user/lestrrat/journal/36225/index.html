<p>So I'm a bit late to the party, and only now have noticed that there's something called Spread (http://www.spread.org) from Ask Bjorn Hansen's presentation slides.<br/><br/>The documentation for spread seems to be er, lacking. I can think of ways to use it but first of all? How widely is it being used? What do YOU use it for?<br/><br/>The other thing: Which perl binding do you use? Spread.pm and Spread::Session looks ok, but my immediate response was, oh, why don't I write Spread::libspread (much like Memcached::libmemcached) and make it pure OO to start with? Bad idea?<br/><br/>In any case, I'm interested in knowning what/how Spread is being used.... anybody?</p>

I've played with Spread over the years. In my experience, it will not do what you want it to do. mod_log_spread is about all you should use it for.<br/><br/>Leon

So what are some potential alternatives that does do what you want it to do?

<h2>I've been where it was used</h2>

They used it for several years at Rent.com to make sure that uploaded images were copied to all of the webservers.  I never had to work with it, but my impression was that it was somewhat finicky, but got the job done.<br><br>I don't know if they're still using it.<br><br>For most need to establish a shared state we used data in databases or caches using memcached.  We ran into one major bug, a buffer overflow if your keys were too long.  We handled that by taking an MD5 hash of the key we wanted to use, thereby guaranteeing that our key was always short.  Other than that bug, memcached rocked.
