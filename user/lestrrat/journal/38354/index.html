<h1>Japan Perl Association is coming</h1>

<div class="span8">
<p><p>While the enlightened folks (<URL:http://www.enlightenedperl.org>) are working steadily towards their goal in the Western world, us folks in the Far East have something of our own that's being cooked up by the community.... and so here I am, pre-announcing the <b>Japan Perl Association</b>.</p>

<p>We're essentially a bunch of folks that want to make sure people know Perl Is Good For Your Business. Like chromatic said (<URL:http://www.modernperlbooks.com/mt/2009/01/why-modern-perl.html>), we're in 2009, not 1999. But a lot of people, including some major businesses are branding Perl as un-manageable. Those of us who decided to follow the Good Practices know that this isn't true: We know that Perl can be an excellent tool to build large, complex systems and still be extremely easy to manage. But have we done enough to promote Good Perl?</p>

<p>JPA will focus on those issues in Japan. Of course, if EPO can do it for us, that's good too, but there's always the language barrier. So JPA will (in Japanese ;) give presentations and host seminars and training sessions. We will teach businesses how to harness Perl's true potential. We will host a portal where solutions can be found. We will promote more employment for Perl engineers. </p>

<p>Oh, and all this isn't just talk: JPA has already been incorporated. Yes, we have an identity already!
We've managed to gather officers from some major Japanese IT players. 
We're currently discussing funding, targeting the coming fiscal year (Japan's fiscal year traditionally starts on April), and planning some activities for April and May.</p>

<p>We haven't yet come up with a website. We'll be getting one pretty soon-ish.</p>

<p>Also, you should know that, among other things, we will be running YAPC::Asia Tokyo (<URL:http://yapc.asia>) from this year on. In 2008, we had a whopping 570 registered users. This year we want to extend this to somewhere around 700.</p>

<p>Also, we're planning to host YAPC::Asia Tokyo some where around September this year, mainly due to the transition of hands. Haven't been to Japan yet? We'll be waiting this autumn!</p>

<p>That's it for now. We'll have more details soon. Please contact me (lestrrat @ twitter, or dmaki on CPAN) if you have any questions.</p>

</p>

<h2>Interesting...</h2>

<p>That's cool; I hope to be able to attend. Hopefully it's going to be late September rather than early September because I heard that Tokyo is still pretty hot in early September.</p><p>Good luck with the JPA - is there an English web site somewhere? (I realize it's the <i>Japan</i> Perl Association, but connections to the outside world are important as well, I guess...</p>

<p>September is good timing. We (PerlChina) are planning to host another Perl Workshop this year again in Beijing. Maybe We can have it after Y::A and subsequently get more attendees/speakers.</p><p>BTW, here is the world wide perl events and looks like September or October is mostly event free so far.<br><a href="http://www.yapceurope.org/ical/conferences.ics" title="yapceurope.org">http://www.yapceurope.org/ical/conferences.ics</a yapceurope.org></p>

If they are organized around the same time, I will so try and make both. I've never visited Japan and would love to, and China was a great time and I'd love to visit again!<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

That works out perfectly. Let's try to coordinate on the timing<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)

Just out of curiosity/planning, I looked at the cost of flights between Tokyo and Beijing. And...ouch. Then I realized that it's possible (and cheaper) to do boat to South Korea, followed by boat from there to China. Then some trains to fill in the gaps I guess (I spent a month taking trains around China in 2007...it was SO awesome). And it'd probably be cheaper to do that and I get to see a bit of South Korea along the way. (Or they could have a workshop too.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)) Anyway, looking forward to hearing dates etc - will be my first time in Japan, and I've plenty more that I want to see in China, so it is quite an exciting idea!

FYI I've never traveled to/from China or Korea, so I don't know about the travel arrangements there, but if in case any of you plan to stay in Japan and travel a bit, you<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/definitely/ want to look at Japan Rail Pass (http://www.japanrailpass.net/). Travel costs are usually insane within Japan, but with this pass, you get a free ride on any JR operated transportation including bullet trains for a given amount of time.

Thanks, good to know! And I most certainly want to stay in Japan and travel a bit.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

<h2>Really hoping to get to YAPC::Asia this year...</h2>

<p>It's the last big conference I've never been to, so I hope to get there if at all possible...</p>
