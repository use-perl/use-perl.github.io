<div class="span8">
<p><p>For a long time, the only easy way to submit CPAN Testers reports was 
CPANPLUS.  The first automated smoke testers for CPAN were built upon it,
like <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/CPAN-YACSmoke/">CPAN::YACSmoke</a>
and <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/POE-Component-CPAN-YACSmoke/">
POE::Component::CPAN::YACSmoke</a>.</p>

<p>About a year and a half ago, I wrote <a
href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/CPAN-Reporter">CPAN::Reporter</a>, to bring
CPAN Testers reporting to good-old CPAN.pm.  Since then, some intrepid
individuals have built automated smoke testers upon CPAN::Reporter, all
writing their own programs to do so.</p>

<p>CPAN.pm itself added an experimental
<i>smoke</i> command to test recent uploads, but it requires XML::LibXML and
doesn't test distributions in isolation -- all tested distributions and their
dependencies keep getting added to PERL5LIB until things explode.</p>

<p>Yesterday, I released the first, alpha version of 
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/CPAN-Reporter-Smoker">
CPAN::Reporter::Smoker</a> to provide a better-behaved, more turn-key approach
to smoke testing with CPAN::Reporter.</p>

<pre>
(... configure CPAN and CPAN::Reporter as usual ... )

$ perl -MCPAN::Reporter::Smoker -e start
</pre>

<p>This initial version still has some limitations (e.g. no developer 
versions smoked), but I'm ready for anyone interested to try it out and start
sending feedback -- compliments, suggestions, or complaints all welcome.</p>

FYI -- 0.01_02 just uploaded to CPAN.  Adds developer release support -- but needs a different index file to support it.<br><br>Thanks for trying it out.<br><br>-- dagolden

Is there support for mailing through a server that needs a password yet?

<p>Not yet.  CPAN::Reporter relies entirely on Test::Reporter for the transport
mechanism and it has not yet been patched for it.</p>

<p>In various threads on cpan-testers-discuss, the consensus is that we want to
move to HTTP transport.  Ask (from the Perl NOC) is working on an API for us
and transport work has stalled a bit waiting on that.</p>

<p>Overall, there are plans coming together for a broader reengineering of CPAN
Testers to support multiple methods of transport.  You can see the placeholder for the new stack at <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?CPAN::Testers" title="cpan.org">
CPAN::Testers</a cpan.org>.</p>

Could you please make prominent note of any improvement to the transport mechanism, like a choice or using passwords?<br><br>I know I for one can not automatically test and submit because Verizon requires passwords.  I think that requirement is true for many other carriers, and I think CPAN loses a lot of testers that way.  I see a ton of testing on UNIX and its many variants, and little on Mac/Darwin or PeeCee.<br><br>I think this would really help with CPAN, and others seem to agree but it does not happen.<br><br>I know, I should do it myself.  Well, then we will really wait until hell freezes over.
