<p><p>If you haven't seen <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/rjbs/journal/36068">rjbs's journal</a>, he posted about some of what he, <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/jonasbn/">jonasbn</a> and I have been working on here in Oslo.</p>
<p>We came up with some good ideas for a general metabase for CPAN distributions, which we think can become the back-end not just for CPAN Testers 2.0 but for other tools as well that are all doing essentially the same thing in collecting distributed information about distributions.</p>
<p>However, we realized that it would probably be a lot of work, so we wanted to start with something tangible that could be successful quickly.  So we added 'HTTP' as a valid transport() option for Test::Reporter and RJBS created Test::Reporter::HTTPGateway to be a remote server that can gateway HTTP transport to cpan-testers@perl.org.  We've done some limited testing and it appears to be working well.  (More testing tomorrow.)</p>
<p>The documentation could still be improved -- but essentially, if you install the latest dev releases of Test::Reporter (1.38_01) and CPAN::Reporter (1.14_01), then you can use this config option in your .cpanreporter/config.ini:</p>

<pre>
    transport=HTTP http://some.example.com/gateway/
</pre>

<p>and assuming you're running T::R::HTTPGateway at that URL it should work.</p>
<p>In the process, I wound up using some code that I had started working on a couple months ago and never finished to support other transports like Net::SMTP::TLS, so while that hasn't been tested yet (maybe tomorrow), it's possible that Net::SMTP::TLS may actually be working as well, or could be made to work with little additional effort.</p>
<p>That's the news from Oslo.</p>
<p>As an additional note, I want to particularly thank TPF for sponsoring my travel and <a href="http://www.linpro.no/">Linpro</a> for providing excellent facilities for the hackathon and also some very friendly and very helpful hosts.  Also, I want to send a big thank you to <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/sjn/">Salve</a> for taking the lead in organizing the event in the first place!</p>
