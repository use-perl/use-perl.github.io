<h1>Oslo Hackathon 2008 -- wrap-up writeup</h1>

<div class="span8">
<p><p> First, I'd like to thank The Perl Foundation for sponsoring my trip to
the hackathon.  I'd also like to thank <a href = "www.linpro.no">Linpro</a>
for providing a wonderful venue as well as on-site food and refreshments
throughout the hackathon. This is my wrap-up summary so they have a sense
of what their contributions helped make possible.<\p>

<p><b>Project 1 -- Test::Reporter transport plugins</b><\p>

<p>I worked with rjbs on adding "transport" plugins to Test::Reporter to
provide better options for how reports are sent to CPAN Testres.  The
existing transports (Mail::Send and Net::SMTP) were extracted into separate
modules (Test::Reporter::Transport::Mail::Send, etc.).  Plus we created
three new transports:<\p>

<ul>

<li><p>Test::Reporter::Transport::HTTPGateway -- provides HTTP to email
transport via a the new Test::Reporter::HTTPGateway module<\p><\li>

<li><p>Test::Reporter::Transport::Net::SMTP::TLS -- provides TLS and
authenticated SMTP (a long-standing wishlist item)<\p><\li>

<li><p>Test::Reporter::Transport::File -- reports saved as files in a directory
for offline CPAN Testing and manual submission <\p><\li>

</ul>

<p>Unfortuately, the HTTPGateway transport is only a temporary step 
towards a better CPAN Testers as the gateway still just relays to email.
But people can set up their own gateways for now or perhaps a central
server will be deployed somewhere.<\p>

<p>Using transport plugins for all of these with a consistent API makes it
easy for clients like CPAN::Reporter to switch between them based on
configuration settings.  E.g., in .cpanreporter/config.ini<\p>

<pre>
transport=HTTPGateway http://gateway.example.com/http2email/
</pre>

<p><b>Project 2 -- CPAN Metabase for CPAN Testers 2.0</b><\p>

<p>The big issue with CPAN Testers "1.0" (what we currently have) is that
it uses email to cpan-testers@perl.org for submissions and the only archive
for reports is effectively the perl.cpan.testers newsgroup.  For a while, I
and others were talking about creating CPAN  Testers 2.0 to move to HTTP
submission and a centralized, indexed, searchable database.<\p>

<p>I'd hoped to interest people in Oslo in thinking through what it might
require or even working on some pieces of it. What I found was that there
are a <i>lot</i> of areas where people are looking to collect 'meta'
information about CPAN distributions, each with their own approach and APIs
for gathering, storing or publishing in a very application-specific
way.<\p>

<p>That got me and rjbs started designing a more general solution, which we've 
called a CPAN 'metabase'. This would work for CPAN Testers 2.0 or for
other projects that want to store/publish distribution-level
information.<\p>

<p>After a few days of work, we achieved:<\p>

<ul>

<li><p>General design of a system (class hierarchy, architecture, etc.) to
meet at least initial envisioned needs with the flexibility to expand over
time<\p><\li>

<li><p>A simple, working proof-of-concept -- with filesystem-based storage and
indexing and the ability to store and retrieve a simple "fact" (a text
string) via a web client.<\p><\li>

</ul>

<p>Next steps are to refine, standardize and document the classes and APIs; to
add additional capabilities to the proof-of-concept; and to get a 0.01
release to CPAN for community feedback.<\p>

<p><b>Other contributions</b><\p>

<ul>

<li><p>Moral support for Adam Kennedy's time-travelling efforts to build the April
Strawberry Perl</p></li>

<li><p>Feedback on TAP diagnostic semantics and the implication for
downstream consumers like CPAN::Reporter</p></li>

<li><p>Figured out a hack with the Berkeley DB libraries to help Tux build
DB_File on Strawberry Perl</p></li>

<li><p>Participated in a best practice discussion/argument on environment
variables, 'xt' directories, etc.<\p><\li>

</ul>

<p><b>Things that came up that I didn't get around to working on</b></p>

<ul>

<li><p>CPAN::Reporter::Smoker -- a couple people (Gabor and someone else?) said it
would be helpful if C::R::S could take a specific list for a work queue
instead of trying to smoke only the latest things on CPAN.  Now that
someone asked for it, that gets bumped up on my priority list<\p><\li>

<li><p>Salve brought up using boilerplating as a way of discussing and later
disseminating best practices so I showed him a boilerplate tool in my
repository (not yet released).  He and rjbs thought it had promise given
easy customization so I'm going to try to finish the documentation and get
a 0.01 release out soon<\p><\li>

<li><p>Schwern brought up the CPAN::PERL5INC taint bug in recent devel versions of
CPAN.pm<\p><\li>

<li><p>Various people were working on codifying and releasing modules for various
parts of the PAUSE/CPAN tools.  rjbs has a work project along these lines
and brian d foy's work to index BackPAN is driving similar efforts.  There
was some discussion of making it a YAPC::NA hackathon project<\p><\li>

</ul>

<p><b>Other things I learned (not necessarily Perl)</b><\p>

<ul>

<li><p>git is awesome.  I had been looking for a project to force me to live with
it and get over the learning curve.  Since Test::Reporter lives in git and
rjbs knew it already, I got my chance.  rjbs and I were routinely
developing simultaneously on the same code base, merging back and forth
several times a day and despite the huge flux in our early development
code, it "just worked"<\p>

<p>The best part was that during the flight home, we continued hacking, using
a git repository on a usb drive to exchange and merge our branches.  We'd
just walk it between our seats about every hour or so<\p><\li>

<li><p>Developing Perl on a Ubuntu virtual machine on Windows is a vastly better,
faster experience than native Perl on Windows.  (It would be interesting
for someone to figure out what's behind that)<\p><\li>

<li><p>rjbs showed me the wonders of screen (and screen + irssi).  I don't know
how I could have gone so long without learning how cool it is.<\p><\li>

<li><p>Norwegians are friendly.  The organizers, Linpro staff and people on
the streets were welcoming and helpful whenever we need it<\p><\li>

</ul>

<p><b>Other thanks</b><\p>

<ul>

<li><p>To <a href = "http://pobox.com/">Pobox</a> (via rjbs) for a
temporary mailbox for testing TSL and authenticated SMTP<\p><\li>

<li><p>To the BBC for <a
href="http://backstage.bbc.co.uk/">backstage.bbc.co.uk swag</a><\p><\li>

<li><p>To jonasbn for being a sounding board as rjbs and I drew crazy
metabase design diagrams</p></li>

<li><p>To rjbs for putting in a tremendous effort in a short period of
time on projects that he wasn't even focusing on before the
hackathon and for teaching me a lot of new tools</p></li>

</ul>

Hi David,<br><br>thanks for the write-up. You guys really did accomplish a lot of stuff in the short time.<br><br>Cheers,<br>Steffen<br><br>P.S.: Somewhen, I need to get off my arse (read: take some vacation and set aside the cash for travelling) and participate in some hackathon.
