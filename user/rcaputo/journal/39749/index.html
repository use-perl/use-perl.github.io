<p><p>
POE 1.280 has just been released, but it may take up to a day before
your favorite CPAN mirror catches wind of it.  You'll also need the
latest POE::Test::Loops, version 1.030.
</p>

<p>
Those following along may notice that the version numbers jumped a
little.  That's because POE has undergone a couple optimizations that
alter its behavior a little.
</p>

<p><b>I/O Dispatch is Faster</b></p>

<p>
I/O events jump the queue in POE 1.280.  Skipping an enqueue and
dequeue saves significant time.  The drawback is that I/O is
dispatched in a different order relative to other kinds of events.
Most people won't care, but it has affected one of
POE::Component::Client::HTTP's tests.  See below for contact
information if you think it's affected you.
</p>

<p><b>Session Cleanup is Faster</b></p>

<p>
In POE 1.280, session cleanup is done just before the event loop would
wait for new events.  Programs that aren't event bound should show
decreased latency because the cleanup will be scheduled during idle
times.  This optimization changes the timing of session cleanup and
their resulting _stop events.  While I don't think it affects many
people, it has already bitten Adam Kennedy.  Please let us know if you
suspect it's gnawing on you, too.
</p>

<p><b>Staying in Touch</b></p>

<p>
People who need realtime notice of POE changes may watch them at
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/poe/">SourceForge</a>,
<a href="http://www.ohloh.net/p/poe">Ohlo</a> and
<a href="http://cia.vc/stats/project/POE">CIA</a>.
</p>

<p>
POE's community may be found everywhere.  Several members tend to
accumulate in
<a href="mailto:poe-subscribe@perl.org">POE's mailing list</a>
and
<a href="irc://irc.perl.org/poe">IRC channel</a> at irc.perl.org #poe.
You're welcome to join us, even if you don't have problems to report.
</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>So, how MUCH faster?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<h2>I/O dispatch is about 130% faster, since you ask.</h2>

<p>
Sorry, no fancy graphs.
</p><p>
I wrote a deliberately simple program to count select_read() events per second.  I ran it five times for each version of POE, averaged the results, and calculated the improvement using (new_rate/old_rate-1).  Standard deviation for the sample sets were about 1%, if that matters.

I don't have a methodology to test the mark-and-sweep garbage collection in isolation.  Got any ideas?
