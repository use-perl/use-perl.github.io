<p><p>
Those of you who use POE for serious things should be aware of a
couple changes introduced after 1.269.
</p>

</p>

<p>
First, here's a public service annoucement from POE:  Developers who
want to keep up with POE's latest changes are encouraged to follow its
<a href="https://poe.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/poe/trunk/poe/">repository</a>.
You'll get instant notification of changes as often as you'd like, and
you'll have maximum lead time to
<a href="http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Dist/Display.html?Name=POE">report
new bugs</a>
or port production code to new features.  I've also released
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/POE/">Version 1.269_002</a>
to the CPAN for developers who are more comfortable with that.
Remember: CPAN shells don't install developer releases by default.
And now back to the changes!
</p>

<p><b>Synchronous I/O Dispatch</b></p>

<p>
POE::Kernel dispatches I/O events synchronously after 1.269.
Previously these events would be enqueued along with everything else,
only to be dequeued and dispatched as soon as possible.  Now they're
dispatched as they happen, saving the overhead of a round trip through
the event queue.  Developers should notice an improvement in I/O bound
programs.
</p>

<p>
This naturally changes the timing of I/O events.  Where in the past
they may have been enqueued behind other events, they now come first.
This could cause problems for users who depend on the relative timing
of I/O events compared to other kinds of events.  I expect most
developers won't notice the difference.
</p>

<p>
This optimization is most effective for code that uses POE::Kernel's
select_read() and select_write() watchers directly.  Additional layers
of abstraction, such as POE::Component::Server::TCP or AnyEvent add
overhead that has not been reduced by this optimization.
</p>

<p><b>Mark and Sweep Session Garbage Collection</b></p>

<p>
Session termination and memory reclamation have been combined and
delayed.  Combining them reduces the overhead of POE::Kernel's
dispatcher by eliminating a few method calls per event.  Delaying
garbage collection allows POE to do this work when it's likely to be
idle anyway.  While the latter optimization doesn't reduce CPU
consumption, it should reduce callback latency in the common case.
</p>

<p>
People who require _stop to be called immediately when a session
releases its last resource may be disappointed.  _stop events are
dispatched as a side effect of garbage collection, which as I've
mentioned has been delayed.  Adam Kennedy's Test::POE::Stopping has
been affected.  I hope his is a special case.
</p>

<p><b>More to Come</b></p>

<p>
There will be more improvements in the future, but that's all for now.
Stay tuned, and please report any problems you encounter early and
often.  Thanks!
</p>
</p>

<h2>Running downstream tests</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Alias/">Alias</a> on 2009-10-10T02:27:42</h3>
<p>It might be a nice idea to try installing a range of different downstream POE modules on top of this and see if it changes their own test suites.</p>
