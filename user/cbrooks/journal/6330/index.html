<h1>Automating the release of new functionality</h1>

<div class="span8">
<p>I would like to automate our company's process of releasing new web functionality into production.
<br><br>Here's a brief description of our architecture:
<ul>
<li>RH Linux</li>
<li>MySQL database on the back end.</li> 
<li>All HTML and Perl source code is stored in a CVS repository.  Images are not stored under CVS.</li>  
<li>Each developer has their own local source tree with an Apache server listening to a high-numbered port.</li>  
<li>We also have a staging server that we use for testing</li> 
<li>We have a separate production server visible to the outside world.</li>
<li>HTML pages are static files.</li>
<li>We write mod_perl handlers and cgi scripts that run under Apache::Registry.</li>  
</ul>
<br>
At its simplest, you could imagine a release process scheduled to run every night at 1:00 am that looked something like this:<br/><br/><br>cvs update
<br>/usr/local/apache/bin/apachectl stop
<br>/usr/local/apache/bin/apachectl start
<br><br><br/><br/>However, this approach is likely to prove unsatisfactory for several reasons:
<ul>
<li>Since images are not stored under CVS, new images might not get loaded when needed.</li>
<li>Some development involves creating new database tables, altering existing tables, or populating existing configuration tables with new data.</li>
<li>New modules should be tested before stopping the web server.  Should a module fail some of its tests during installation, the update should be rolled back so that the server can start successfully.</li>
<li>Some files get committed to the repository before they are stable and/or approved.  Only  stable, approved files should get released.</li>
<li>A related (but distinct) issue is that stable files should not necessarily be released as soon as they are stable.  A simple example of such a case is a (stable) HTML file which includes a link for another HTML file which is not yet ready to be launched.</li>
</ul><br/><br/>Given this description, it is possible to rough out a simple spec for The Release System (TRS):
<ul>
<li>TRS needs to interact with CVS.  This will allow releases to be customized by directory hierarchy, CVS module, and / or tag.  This will also ensure that master copies will be released, rather than local copies.</li>
<li>TRS needs to be able to execute simple scripts.  This will allow TRS to run tests, execute arbitrary SQL, log results, etc.</li>
<li>TRS needs to be able to perform a rollback should unit tests fail during release.  It should only stop and start the web server if all tests pass.</li>
<li>TRS needs to interact with some system that knows (1) whether a particular file is stable; and (2) whether a particular file is approved for release.</li>
<li>TRS should have logging facilities that keep a record of when all changes were made, error messages and warnings that were encountered, etc.</li>
<li>Although a fully automated and regularly scheduled system is nice, it is not necessary.  However, a release should be possible with very little interaction on the part of the system administrator.</li>
<li>TRS should be able to run the regression testing suite after release.</li>
</ul><br/><br/><br>
A few questions:
<ul>
<li>Who has cracked this nut before?</li>
<li>Can anyone recommend pointers to good articles that tackle part or all of this?</li>
<li>make is certainly a candidate for some of the logic -- would anyone recommend a different installation utility?</li>  
<li>Parts of this sound like a Content Management System -- does anyone care to comment on the applicability of Bricolage or a similar open source CMS product?</li>
<li>CVS does not seem to have as robust a system for tracking stability as I would like -- i.e. you can set tags on groups of files, as in "STABLE-06012002", but you can't flip a bit per file.  (Unless you set a tag per file -- which isn't necessarily good since a file might go through various iterations of stability / instability.)  Can anyone venture an opinion as to whether the per-file "stable" flag is a good idea or a cluster-f*ck?</li>
</ul><br/><br/><br>
Thanks for any and all help.</p>
