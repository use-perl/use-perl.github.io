<div class="span8">
<p>This was my first YAPC.  Quite an interesting time.  What I enjoyed most was putting faces / personalities to names.  Larry, Damian, Mark Jason Dominus, Simon, Nat, Schwern, Abigail.  The whole bunch.
<br><br>
What I don't quite understand, though, is how these people make a living.  Or, more to the point, what kind of living can you make it if you get into the high Perl Priesthood?
<br><br>
Here's my best guess as to where their income comes from:  (And hey, no offense to these folks -- maybe they don't want their incomes discussed.  I don't mean it personally, I'm just curious about what the income possibilities are for our most lauded wizards.)
<br><br>
Perl Foundation Grants:
<ul>
<li>Larry, Damian and Dan Sugalski are all on 2002 Perl Foundation grants.  Those pay a $60,000 stipend and a $20,000 travel allowance (but they are only 52% funded to date, and I believe Dan and Damian's expire at the end of July.)</li>  
</ul>
<br>
Book Royalties:
<ul>
<li>Larry, Damian and Nat presumably have ongoing royalties from their books.</li>  
<li>Simon has a book out next month (http://www.manning.com/jenness/).</li>
<li>Mark Jason Dominus seems to be perennially working on a book due out next year some time (http://perl.plover.com/book/).</li>   
</ul>
<br><br>
Day Jobs:
<ul>
<li>Schwern works as a contractor.</li>  
<li>Nat and mjd work as trainers for the Tom Christianson Perl Consultancy.</li>
</ul>
<br>
Presentation Fees:
<ul>
<li>Let's see, YAPC-NA offered free conference attendance to presenters.  There's a whopping $85 value.</li>
<li>mjd asks for $25 and a plane ticket to give a talk in any city.</li>
</ul>
<br><br>
And I can't seem to figure out what Abigail does.
<br><br>
So, is that it?  Is that what getting to the top of your profession looks like?  Book deals and Perl training?  Do you get a 401k with that?  </p>

<h2>Jobs</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/acme/">acme</a> on 2002-07-11T10:04:04</h3>
Well, most of the Perl gurus around Europe make their money off full-time jobs. Training and consultancy got very tricky to pull off since the dot-crash. Perl is just something we do in our free time (or if we have kind employers, part of our work time too). Perl gods are people too, you know &nbsp;;-)
