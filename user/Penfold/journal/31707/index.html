<p>So... last night, one of the job agencies I fed my CV to, who knows I've actually accepted a position elsewhere, scattershot a plea for a 6 month PHP contract to a large list of people. <br/><br/>I dropped back a mostly polite note pointing out that this wasn't perhaps very smart. The reply:<br/><br/>"Unfortunatly you are included in the same file as PHP, along with every other perl developer."<br/><br/>Houston, we have a perception problem.</p>

<p>Not sure if I agree totally that there's a perception problem here. You're quoting pond life here, and it may represent the filing system used in that particular pond.</p>
<p>I remember a former boss saying that a particular agency used to keep sending CVs speculatively, even after he asked them to stop. They always printed them on a particular sort of high grade paper, instantly recognisable. So it was easy to put them straight in the bin, and carry on doing so even once he was looking for staff again. Sadly, not enough firms seem to put this sort of natural selection pressure on the pond life.</p>
