<div class="span8">
<p>A couple of people on the <strong><a href=http://use.perl.org>use Perl;</a></strong> version of this blog picked up on my use of 'OO Perl' as a term, and were less than complimentary about the language's OO features. I'm not here to defend that: however, it set me thinking about why I used that term, and whether it was what I actually meant. 
<p>
It was, at least in part, prompted by my job search (more on that later, I promise). Look down <a href=http://jobs.perl.org/>jobs.perl.org</a>, and you'll find that most of the well-paying jobs mention, in some roundabout way, LAMP or a variant thereof, and stipulate 'OO Perl'. The fact that I had 'OO Perl' (and legitimately so) on my CV (resumÃÂ© for you transPondials) was welcomed with open arms by several recruiters who absolutely couldn't wait to get my details to their clients. 
<p>
I think, in the end, this goes back to some of the comments I made about the Swiss Army Chainsaw, specifically, the distinction between Perl scripters and Perl programmers. How do you tell if someone's the latter, if their CV just says 'Perl'? 
<p>
I don't think 'OO Perl' necessarily has to mean, literally, Perl in the Perl5 "<em>bless {};</em>" way. What the recruiters are trying to say, I'm pretty sure, is 'someone who treats Perl like a high-level programming language'. 'OO Perl' is, if you like, a <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org.uk/wiki/Shibboleth>shibboleth</a>, to find the programmers amid the scripters, since a scripter's response will be either 'huh?' or 'no, that's scary'. (Joking a little, but you get the point.) It isn't, by any means, a perfect test, but it seems to me that if someone both uses OO Perl, and <em>consciously</em> self-identifies as doing so, they fall on the 'programmer' side of the divide.
<p>
And of course the problem, both for the recruiters and for our definition of LAMP++, is that Perl the language doesn't mandate it. Any more, actually, than Java the language does. You can quite happily write little Java ten-liners to do some mundane task that mangles a file, and never consciously touch an OO feature of the language. You can write really bad Java just as much as you can really bad Perl.
<p>
But... and here's the kicker... The frameworks that most Java enterprise projects are written in pretty much <em>do</em> mandate an OO approach, and what my Uni lecturers would call 'good software engineering principles'. And that means that folks raised in that environment have it as a similar shibboleth to 'OO Perl' to prove their credentials in the Java world. Now sure, once you start using Class::DBI, Rose::DB or DBIx::Class for your DBI abstraction layer, or a goodly number of the popular CPAN modules, you're at least required to talk to them in an OO way. But there's nothing to stop your actual application code being a Big Ball Of Mud, a God Object, or any number of other anti-pattern horrors. 
<p>
Which reminds me. I should talk about Design Patterns.</p>

<h2>Single Paradigm Languages are dead to me!</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Stevan/">Stevan</a> on 2006-11-23T16:17:10</h3>
<p>
The idea that a language should only provide a single programming paradigm, be it OO, Functional, Logic, etc etc etc, is both outdated and just an overall bad idea. In fact, the idea that a programming language should even just focus on a single paradigm is loosing ground as well. Just ask your favorite formerly-Java-now-Ruby fanatic and they will likely tell you how nice it is to have first-class blocks.
</p>
<p>
I would argue that Perl is not only the sysadmins Swiss Army Chainsaw, but also the programming language researchers Swiss Army Chainsaw too. Having implemented early prototypes of the Perl 6 metamodel in <a href="http://svn.pugscode.org/pugs/misc/old_pugs_perl5_backend/Perl6-MetaModel/" title="pugscode.org">Perl 5</a pugscode.org>, <a href="http://svn.pugscode.org/pugs/misc/org.perl6.metamodel/" title="pugscode.org">Java (w/ help from other #perl6-ers)</a pugscode.org>, Common LISP and Javascript (the last two are not online), I have to say that Perl 5 was by far the malleable of the group (LISP came in a close second, followed by Javascript). In fact, the current Perl 6 metamodel now in Pugs is written in <a href="http://svn.pugscode.org/pugs/src/MO/" title="pugscode.org">Haskell</a pugscode.org>, but was initially prototyped in <a href="http://nothingmuch.woobling.org/MO/" title="woobling.org">Perl 5</a woobling.org>, which was written using <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/stevan/Moose-0.17/" title="cpan.org">Moose</a cpan.org> which itself is a Perl 5 port of the Perl 6 metamodel, bringing it back full circle. Try doing that in Java<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)
</p>
<p>
I guess what I am trying to say is that anyone who tells you there is no such thing as "Perl OO" is both wrong (they are trying to be a purist, but if they are not a Smalltalk developer, they have no ground to stand on), and not very smart. Anyone who doggedly sticks to a single paradigm is almost certainly wasting a *huge* amount of effort reinventing or reimplementing the other paradims within that singular paradigm. Which reminds me of a great quote about LISP:
</p>
<blockquote>
<div>Any sufficiently complicated C or Fortran program contains an ad hoc informally-specified bug-ridden slow implementation of half of Common Lisp. (Philip Greenspun)</div>
</blockquote>
<p>
Just remap the language names to programming paradigms and I think the same truth can be found.
