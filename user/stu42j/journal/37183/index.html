<p>All this talk about job <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/rjbs/journal/37173">application</a>/<a href="http://use.perl.org/user/Mr.+Muskrat/journal/37174">interview</a> tips has reminded me of my favorite personal interview horror story.<br/><br/>I was invited to a telephone interview for a job with Yahoo in California.  I wasn't really interested in moving to CA but I figured what the heck.  How could I say no to Yahoo, right?<br/><br/>The programming part of the job turned out to be mostly in PHP which I didn't realize at first.  I don't really have a good opinion of PHP but my experience with it has been limited and based on free internet code, not enterprise systems.<br/><br/>So, when prompted if I had any questions, I tried to say that I was curious about how Yahoo has used PHP in a positive, efficient way and what aspects of the language they feel makes it best suited for their environment.  I guess what I actually said sounded to the interviewer more like "PHP sux and you are stupid for using it."<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I didn't get much of a response and needless to say, I didn't get the job (or even a free trip to CA).</p>

<p>I was a junior network admin. I was invited to an interview at UUNET. I get there and go into a room with 5 senior level SA's who proceeded to tear me up. The Marines didn't make me sweat as much.</p>
