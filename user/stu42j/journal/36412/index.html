<div class="span8">
<p>Every beginner programmer (of C-style languages) has to learn to deal with '=' (assignment) vs. '==' (comparison). Using <code>=</code> in an <code>if</code> clause is probably one of the most common early mistakes.<br/><br/>I'd like to think that I'm past that stage of my programming experience.  However, about once a year I'll waste a couple of hours debugging to eventually notice the missing <code>=</code>.<br/><br/>I was working on some Javascript today and I had the feeling something was wrong with that <code>if</code> but my brain kept telling me to change the <code>=</code> to <code>eq</code>. Must be the jet lag from Ireland. Yeah, the jet lag.  That's it, that's the ticket.</p>

Is there a critic policy for that yet?

I was about to say yes, but then I checked and, no, we don't have a policy for that.  CodePro has one for Java and that's what I was thinking of.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br><br>As someone else said, I always write "10 == $x" instead of "$x == 10".  It takes just a little getting used to, but it's a MUCH safer style.  In autoboxed scalars, it works well too: in Java, "10".equals(str) is better than str.equals("10") because the former handles null gracefully and the latter does not.<br><br>For consistency, I try to put the constant first for every infix comparison operator.<br><br>I'll add a P::C todo entry right now.

<h2>A Tip</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/davorg/">davorg</a> on 2008-05-14T05:09:39</h3>
If you're comparing a constant to a variable, then put the constant first in the expression.<br><br>if (10 == $x)<br><br>If you forget the extra '=' then most C-style languages will throw a compile-time error.<br><br>Can't count the amount of time that's saved me over the last twenty years.
