<div class="span8">
<p><p>Over the past 48 hours I have finished the first batch of Mint docs 
(now awaiting feedback before proceeding with coding), fixed up my 
online diary, converted its <span class="caps">RSS</span> feed to 2.0 compliance, and written 
about half of the newsreader I described in my last post.</p>

<p>For the record, I am told that <span class="caps">NNW</span> will do what I desire. However, I 
don't have any machines running <span class="caps">OS X </span>(the old Pismo is much 
sprightlier running Linux and Ratpoison), and it's more fun to write 
one myself anyway.</p>

<p>I sat down just after midnight and just started working on a basicc 
2-pane interface, then I just sort of kept going. 4 hours later it has 
a story listing pane, story view pane, working story selector, status 
bar, and can fetch documents over the network and display them. All 
it's missing is the intelligence part -- everything its working with 
is hardcoded dummy data (hardcoded URIs in the case of fetching 
documents). Still, I am extremely impressed with myself, and I have 
strategies for all the unwritten logic. Plus it looks totally sweet.</p>

<p>It's not the lightweight you might be expecting from the "curses" 
keyword, though. Since it's using Perl's Curses::UI bindings and the 
<span class="caps">LWP,</span> it's currently using about 10-12M of memory (8-9M real), and the 
<span class="caps">RSS</span> parser (XML::RSS::Parser) hasn't been put in yet. <span class="caps">OTOH, I</span>'m 
betting that with all these heavyweight modules in place, the actual 
data generated during use won't amount to anything noticable.</p>

<p>Overall, Curses::UI is a joy. The biggest problem is that while the 
docs are pretty good, the included tutorial is <em>really</em> short and 
doesn't even begin to cover everything you can do. There's lots of 
example code included as well, which is a big help, but the problem 
I've found myself running into a lot is trying to figure out which 
widget to use for a task I need doing (hint: ListBox, 
usually). Luckily, it's Perl, so trial-and-error doesn't cost too 
much. Generating everything on the fly seems to come at a definite 
price though: on my workstation, which is a 1667MHz Athlon, everything 
is completely instantaneous, but over an ssh session to deneb (400MHz 
UltraSPARC IIe) things like drawing in the help popup feel like 
they're happening over a fast serial or laggy ethernet connection. You 
can <em>see</em> parts of the window draw in, not character-by-character, but 
in a series of quick pops.</p>
