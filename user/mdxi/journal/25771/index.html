<p><p>Friday night I finally overcame a week's inertia and started hacking 
on cranberry, my console mode mp3 player. I got a harness around 
Audio::Play::MPG123 (which works just fine with mpg321 (there is a 
Audio::Play::MPG321, but it has problems, somewhere -- its poll() 
method takes a significant fraction of a second to execute, which is 
wholly unacceptible for something in a core event loop)) and then 
hooked it up to my Acme::Curses::Marquee, and then added a tiny bit of 
control logic, <em>et viola</em> a simple randomizing mp3 player. This is 
just the barest beginning of what I'd eventually like it to be 
however. I'll write more about that when I have a more concrete idea 
on how things should work.</p>

<p>Did absolutely nothing else over the weekend except watch a couple 
more bad movies. We (and by "we" I mean "K") tried watching the recent 
King Arthur movie, but it was so bad that <em>we</em> actually gave up after 
about 10 minutes (which is so say, after the third line of dialogue).</p>

<p>We followed up with 1984's <em>Silent Night, Deadly Night</em>, which was a 
far superior movie. Full of nonsensical nudity, nonsensical baroque 
violence (kudos on the deer head idea), it is a shining example of the 
mid-1980s slashflick form. Two things really elevate it above the 
norm, though. First, the Mother Superior nun, who has the least 
sympathy of any human being ever: the lead character is traumatized by 
seeing his parents murdered by a petty thief in a Santa suit, so the 
nun beats him into sitting on another Santa's lap every year, causing 
him to become more and more violent; later, the children in her care 
witness a policeman shoot a blind priest dressed as Santa at close 
range (he nearly falls on top of them), and she simply hustles them 
back inside and makes them sing "Deck the Halls". Second, everytime 
the lead character is about to off someone he yells either 
"PUNISHMENT!", or my personal favorite, "NAUGHTY!". This is sheer genius.</p>
