<p>The iBook K ordered for her friend got here today, so we took it to him. Part of me can't help but think that it should have gone to me instead, but he does need it (whereas I just /want/ it), and is a good friend, and he's paying us back, and we're getting his PC is a trade-in (it will become the first incarnation of MediaBawx).<br/><br/>On the way to deliver it to him tonight, we had this conversation:<br/><br/>[K] Yeah, you wouldn't think that kinda voice could come out of a guy that small.
[M] Small? He was, like, 6'1". He's not exactly "small"...
[K] Yeah, but was always around such huge guys. At least he was taller than X-Pac.
[M] Heh. Everybody was. Trent Reznor was taller than X-Pac. Maybe they should wrestle. I'd pay to see that.
[K] Nah, X-Pac was small and he kinda sucked, but he'd kick Trent Reznor's ass in a heartbeat.
[M] Okay, Trent Reznor and Billy Corgan vs. X-Pac.
[K] Mmmm...he'd still kick their asses.
[M] It'll /look/ that way, but at the last minute, Kim Deal interferes from ringside. She's a big girl. Ain't nobody taking her.<br/><br/>Yeah, I could give you context for that, but why, really?<br/><br/>While we were gone, UPS, who has left literally hundreds of guitars on the doorstep of this house without so much as knocking over the past 4 years, DID NOT DELIVER the switch that I fought for the past month to get shipped from its ebay seller. They are horrible and no one should ever use them.</p>
