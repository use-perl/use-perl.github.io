<p><p>Had an interview today. If any of <em>you</em> are reading this (I'm sure you 
managed to find it while grabbing source code from me), thanks for the 
chance, thanks for the pizza, and just ignore those other people and 
hire me. You totally know I'm the dude for the job.</p>

<p>In Olive news, I've worked around the <span class="caps">RFC822</span> issue, and gotten rather 
a pile of (good!) feedback and requests lately. I'm sorting through 
things...well, triaging them, really. It's yet another new and 
interesting experience. Also, a Debian <span class="caps">ITP </span>(Intent To Package) has 
been filed for it, which is neat.</p>

<p>The guy who wants to package it asked me if it was okay, and I said 
that I would have already done it myself but (1) becoming a Debian 
developer is an exercise in pain and (2) Debian's perl package naming 
scheme makes me want to die inside, so I just install everything from 
the <span class="caps">CPAN.</span></p>

yeah, it was a lunch-time interview in their conference room. the alternative was to waste 3/4 of the interview time in downtown Atlanta traffic.

Certainly don't want to work there then.  Decent companies take you out for *curry* at the interview.
