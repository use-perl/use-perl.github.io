<p>First off, sorry if you thought I had some news about Mr Bush or something, I'm just making a Deathstalker III reference.<br/><br/>K got a job today, though she doesn't start until she graduates from university in May. It's a good job, with pay which is actually fairly high for the area it's in, and which includes rent-free accomodations as a perk. This, at a stroke, eliminates every problem which has been plaguing us since I lost my job last April.<br/><br/>Further, it means that I can stay home and play house-husband, giving my shell-shocked soul a chance to recover from the events of the past year. She's quite happy with this, as she won't mind having someone around to cook and clean, and she's only recently discovered just how dire things have been at times -- I tried to shield her from things so she could concentrate on her last year of studies (basically a solid year of translation).<br/><br/>We have very little debt compared to a lot of people, so that can be paid off very quickly, and then I can finally go ahead with my plan to go to tech school and get that AS in electronics engineering (I wanna make my OWN hardware, dammit!).<br/><br/>Also, we get our kitties back.<br/><br/>The only real problem is that while DSL is available where we're going, there's only one ISP: BellSouth. And they don't give you a /24 and wide-open upstream for $55 a month like my current ISP does. I don't yet know what the solution to this one is...<br/><br/>BUT I'M SO FREAKIN' HAPPY THAT I DON'T CARE!</p>
