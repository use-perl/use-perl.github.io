<p>About 2 weeks ago, K got an eMac and I inherited her Pismo 'Book, retiring my Thinkpad 701C (the butterfly!) to the collection.<br/><br/>I'm not a new Mac user. The first Mac I used heavilly was a LCIII running System 7, and the first one I owned was a Starmax 3180/MT running OS8. The point is that I'd used every version of Mac OS from 8.0 to 10.2, and I never found that I could use it as a "primary" OS, just as something on the side to fuck with media and play games. Sometime between me selling my iMac DV+ (to finance the purchase of the Netra X1) and getting my grubby little mitts on the Pismo, this changed.<br/><br/>The problem is that I didn't know it yet, and initially set it up as a dual-boot, with 14G each for OSX and Linux. Then I noticed that subversion compiled cleanly on OS X, someone had written a ssh-agent-alike called SSHKeyChain, and -- most importantly -- Emacs could be built as carbonized app from CVS. Suddenly I could do all the writing and lightweight development that I wanted to do on-the-go, completely under Mac OS. And now I wanted that other 14G back.<br/><br/>Eight hours ago I wiped the disk and started the reinstall. Emacs finished compiling about 5 minutes ago. I feel both very happy and immensely irritated<br/><br/>Also, I applied for a PAUSE account today.</p>

cue the sound of me chuckling deeply. Another of our old debian/redhat hands around irc.freenode.net has been going on about how much fun it is working with X apps and Aqua apps at the same time, and how well it all works together.<br> <br>Color me insanely jealous though, since I can't afford one at the moment, still not having enough steady work.
