<p><p>Started using Edgewall's Trac yesterday. It's a really nice tool. The 
only complaint I have about it is that it's designed to handle 
<strong>single</strong> projects, and I really want to be able to manage <strong>all</strong> my 
projects at once, and see <span class="caps">TOD</span>Os and milestones and tickets from all of 
them. Still, until I get around to writing that, it works very 
nicely. It's also about 4 times faster than Kwiki, with both of them 
running in pure, unaccelerated <span class="caps">CGI</span> mode.</p>

<p>What <em>happened</em> to kwiki between 0.18 and 0.3? My uneducated guess is 
that there exists a point of diminishing returns for "pure" software 
engineering and OO subclassing, and Kwiki crossed way over it during 
its redesign.</p>

<p>We watched a movie Friday night that made last weekend's batch seem 
like masterworks: <em>Satisfaction</em>. If you're unlucky, you may actually 
remember this 1988 stinkbomb which was meant to rocket Justine Bateman 
to superstardom, but didn't quite manage to do so. This Aaron 
Spelling-produced crapburger is mostly notable for being the first 
credited appearance of Julia Roberts (as "the trampy one"), and being 
the only movie that Britta Phillips (better known as the voice of Jem 
(as in Jem! and the Holograms), now in an actual band called <span class="caps">LUNA</span>) has 
ever appeared in.</p>

<p><em>Satisfaction</em> doesn't have a plot. It has a taped together string of 
set pieces lifted from after-school specials, with no real segues 
between. Now they're facing the prospect of being away from home for 
the first time. Now they're having creative differences. Now Julia 
Roberts is being a slut. Now they're experiencing the harsh realities 
of not fitting in with the posh kids. Now Jem is overdosing. Now 
Justine Bateman's teenage heart is being broken as she tries to cope 
with adult relationships. Oh yeah, adult relationships. This movie 
also features Liam Neeson in a performance I'm sure he's not happy 
about, as a club owner/beach bum/former musician who falls in "love" 
with Justine Bateman and is "inspired" by her to start "writing" 
"music" again until his ex, Debbie Harry, shows up and ruins the 
thoroughly creepy and unappealing summer "fantasy". </p>

<p>The douche commercial lookalike montage of Neeson and Bateman riding 
horses and bicycles on the beach is not to be missed.</p>

<p>Finally, last night, one of the #perl guys announced that he'd spent 
the day localizing Firefox into Bislama, which is a 
creole/pidgin/trade language from Vanatu and surrounding islands. Or, 
in Bislama:</p>

<blockquote><p>Pidgin toktok blong Saot Pacific</p></blockquote>

<p>Several humorous real and faked examples of Bislama were given, with 
most people focusing on "blong" (a corruption of "belong" and the 
all-purpose possessive modifier/"containing" preposition/"type of" 
adjective pointer) and "wittem" (a dialectish corruption of "with"). I 
tried my hand at a blinkenlights grade pastiche of the language, but 
ended up closer to home than I intended:</p>

<blockquote><p>&lt;me&gt; me blong schlong fapfap wittem piccies blong headred plumpytitties 
&lt;bislama_guy&gt; <span class="caps">FYI,</span> breasts actually <strong>are</strong> called 'titi' in Bislama. A 
bra is 'basket blong titi'...</p></blockquote>

<p>Bislama: 1, Me: 0</p>
