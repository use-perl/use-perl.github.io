<p>Last night I dreamt that the IRC channel I hang out in (not #perl, and not the other one, but the other other one) was a real-life commune, where all the regulars and their SOs hung out coding, building robotics projects, and watching horrible movies.<br/><br/>Partway through the dream, one of us (rjbs) received an invite to a Microsoft developers meeting. We all decided to bum-rush the party, but had to resort to some seriously commando-style shit because the Microsoft campus was defended by federal anti-terrorist agents (to prevent IP theft; no I am not making this up...I mean I <i>did</I> make it up subconciously last night but I'm not making it up as I write this), with checkpoints and drawn weapons everywhere.<br/><br/>Eventually we all made it into a gigantic lecture hall where the keynote was being given. All the girls in our group were given front-row seats, but the guys were forced to sit about 50 rows back. We had just settled in when Rik got a message on his pager, exclaimed "Fuck!" and started scrambling down the rows, trying to hide because the presentation had just begun.<br/><br/>I looked around at my channelmates but none of them seemed concerned. I was worried that the page had been from G and she was in trouble with MS thugs, so I took off after Rik. After a couple of minutes we reached the front row, undetected, and I learned that she had just found a REALLY funny website while browsing over the wireless.<br/><br/>Then we were all magically outside, and there were a lot more of us than before. Seems that at some point we'd become sort of a roving band of gypsies or something because while the original gang was in normal clothes, all the newcomers were in Romany-style peasant dress.<br/><br/>After that freakish detour, the usual gang of idiots was back in our squalid apartments, and four of our robots had become sentient in our ansence. Unfortunately, they were all real jackholes. Fortunately, I was able to use them as script-fodder for my comic strip, and it was *really* funny.<br/><br/>[EDIT]
