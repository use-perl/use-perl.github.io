<div class="span8">
<p><p>Thursday I started work at my new job. N was kind enough to drive me 
(we're planning to swap off the driving as much as possible while I'm 
crashing with her and J) and upon arrival I was dog-n-ponied around 
for introductions, then I started a clean install on my 
workstation. All the production stuff is Debian machines. Two of the 
guys I work directly with bring in their Powerbooks and work using 
them; the third prefers to have Windows on his workstation. I put 
Debian on mine, as I'm trying to maintain a measure of separation 
between me and work.</p>

<p>As the install was wrapping up (slooooow network at work), I was 
surprised by being taken out to lunch. We went to <em>Malaya</em>, a small 
restaurant with a menu which is half Malaysian and half Americanized 
Chinese (knowing nothing about Malaysian cuisine, I can't say how 
Americanized it is, but everything looked pretty homestyle).</p>

<p>I had a savory chicken soup whose name I can't remember -- it was 
basically shreds of chicken and lots of onion in a tangy-sweet broth 
which was based on soy sauce. My entree was described on the menu 
simply as "pot roast on rice noodles", and that's basically what it 
was. The beef was roughly cubed, with a good amount of fat still 
attached to some pieces (that's a good thing; think pho) and had been 
simmered in some sauce which had a really awesome procession of 
flavors: salty/spicy followed by tangy followed by sweet. They served 
it on your choice of egg noodles or rice noodles, but rice noodles are 
clearly the proper choice. On the side was a small mound of what 
looked like lightly stir-fried spinach, but the leaves were a bit 
larger than the fresh spinach I'm used to seeing. And then two little 
breaded and fried things, which I determined from the appetizers menu 
to be fried chicken dumplings. Take minced boiled chicken, blend with 
just enough binder (mostly flour, I assume) to let you roll it into 
thumb-sized cylinders, bread in a spicy coating, and deep fry. Awesome 
stuff all around.</p>

<p>On the way back from lunch I was given a tour of our server farm, 
which is hosted at Internap. Pretty standard stuff, but impressive for 
the amount of redundancy and backup capacity built into the design.</p>

<p>Once back at work proper I was handed my first actual assignment: add 
a slideshow viewer to the content management system. This is a really 
really simple thing, but it was (I think) chosen as a crash-course in 
seeing how things hook up to each other as well as the people side of 
the process. I got a list of requirements from the person who acts as 
the liason between us and the customers, then spent the rest of the 
afternoon asking my team what I should do. The problem wasn't that I 
couldn't figure out how to do it, but rather that I could see <em>many</em> 
ways to do it, and was trying to figure out the best, most House Style 
way to get it done.</p>

<p>This bit ended up being particularly interesting, as I've never really 
worked with a <em>group of competent people</em> before. Every job I've had 
in the past has basically had my acting alone, though I was nominally 
part of a group of people assigned to a task. I would be given 
something to do, and I would go and do it, then report back when 
done. Here, the dynamic seems much more open and everything seems to 
be discussed back and forth.</p>

<p>The afternoon was wrapped up with a group review of a new perl module 
that the lead developer was interested in for purposes of the upcoming 
overhaul of one of out projects. Everyone adjourned to the conference 
room and he toured through the <span class="caps">POD</span> and gave examples of how he 
envisioned it being used in-house, then asked for comments and 
questions.</p>

<p>Basically, it's the same give and take and flow and cross-pollination 
of ideas that I've become accustomed to via distributed development 
online, but happening in the real world. It's the damnedest thing.</p>

<h2>Friday</h2>

<p>Friday morning I drove myself, since I'd be heading back to Eatonton 
after work. I got to work fairly early and spent a while perusing our 
wiki, reading news, and doing some tweaks on my workstation. Then I 
sketched out my initial plan, UI thoughts, and db schema for the 
slideshow tool (focusing mostly on the editing portion; there's 
precious little to say about the actual output aside from "and then it 
dumps a stack of web pages").</p>

<p>I sat in with Vince and Linda's lunch, which was half work and half 
hanging-out. Then, at L's suggestion, I put my design work on the 
slideshow on the wiki so that everyone could look it over.</p>

<p>After doing that, I headed up to what the elevator provocatively 
describes as the "Roof Garden". It's not very garden-y, but it is 
pretty cool. The building I work in is one of a group of disused 
industrial buildings, across from the south side of Georgia Tech 
campus, which have been converted into ubertrendy office 
space. Whoever designed the conversion did a neat job of it though, 
leaving the massively thick exterior brick walls and huge (like 12&times;18 
inch huge) timbers exposed throughout, then putting in modern hardwood 
or carpeted floors and lighting. The overall effect is really neat, 
and is probably making them huge sums of money. Anyhow, the specific 
building I work in was a candy factory, built at the turn of the 
(20th) century. Our suite occupies roughly a third of the top (4th) 
floor. The elevator runs to the roof, however, where a large deck has 
been constructed. The views aren't pure art or anything, but it's a 
surprisingly quiet and breezy place. There's a 5-track railroad only 
meters from the south end of the building, and more low-rise aging 
industrial waste beyond that. North is gatech. East is the high-rise 
city center of Atlanta proper, about a mile away. I'll take pictures 
this week.</p>

<p>Later on, I had a discussion with Vince about the merits of various 
software engineering support tools (CVS, svn, svk, wikis, Trac, <span class="caps">RT,</span> 
and so on). He's just starting the task of pulling the development 
process out of the manually-versioned morass it's currently in, and 
into something more sane and modern, but he's been strapped with just 
keeping things running during their period of chronic understaffing, 
so he was receptive to the information I could provide.</p>

<p>Then Linda wanted to talk to me about Corporate stuff. Basically gave 
me the hello-orientation-welcome speech that she was too busy to do on 
Thursday. It was refreshingly bullshit-free, and it was neat to learn 
that it's actual written company policy to hire exceptional people and 
pay them what they're worth instead of hiring flocks of marginal hacks 
and paying them as little as possible.</p>

<p>I am cautiously optimistic.</p>
