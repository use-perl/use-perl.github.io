<p>current (week's) mood: supremely unmotivated and manic depressive<br/><br/>weekend was fantastic. mostly.<br/><br/>discovered that i have a lot more things/places to do, to get, to manage, and to go now that i'm unemployed than i ever did while working. dug the Visor out of storage and popped in new batteries; worked fine. had to re-learn graffiti tho.<br/><br/>skipped a PM meeting tonight in order to hang out with a friend who was suffering from terminal loneliness and set up the printer of another friend. one's mom broke her leg so bad metal pieces were needed to put it back, and so was quite understandably not around when i showed up at their apartment. another was just unreachable by phone, so i gave up. called a third friend who had bolted to savannah to visit a "friend". totally gave up and watched "You Got Served" with K and one of her friends. that movie is hilarious. if you can't MST this movie, you're just not cut out for it.<br/><br/>went looking for Front Mission 4 but couldn't find it. grabbed Pirates of the Caribbean instead. looks pretty awesome from the first 15 minutes.<br/><br/>one day i'll get some freakin' work done again. maybe.</p>
