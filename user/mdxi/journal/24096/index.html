<div class="span8">
<p><p>After a lengthy period of hard-to-rationalize aversion, I recently
began to envision ways in which an <span class="caps">RSS</span> reader thingy might actually

benefit me and be more convenient than a browser.</p>

<p>Unfortulately, a quick search for linux <span class="caps">RSS</span> apps revealed that they
all basically <em>are</em> browsers, just with lots of expandible bookmarks
or which generate their own, ever-changing home pages. This, to me, is
completely missing the point of <span class="caps">RSS</span> as a time-based service. What I

would like to see in an <span class="caps">RSS</span> reader, by default, is a chronologically
sorted list of all stories from all sources, perhaps presented
like:</p>

<pre>STORY                       | SOURCE |  AGE
New Pope Elected            | BBC    |    3m
Something wacky yet erudite | TorgoX |   15m
Repost                      | /.     | 2h43m
New comic                   | OG     | 4d 6h</pre>

<p>And as you read stories they sort to the bottom half of the list.</p>

<p>I spent about an hour perusing various project websites, and if any

existing reader does this, it doesn't bother to say so on its
site. Even the NetNewsWire, which is apparently the Gold Standard of
<span class="caps">RSS</span> aggregators, doesn't (appear to) do this.</p>

<p>This presentation also does away with the need for the 3-pane
interface, though if one were to keep it around, I'd recommend making
it a list of user-defined <em>categories</em> instead of a list of

<em>bookmarks</em> (NNW does appear to do this, but still presents stories
within categories by source instead of by age).</p>

<p>For my personal use, I think I'd best like just 2 categories: News and
Not. And I'd rather have a category popup instead of a persistant 3rd
pane slurping up valuable horizontal real estate. Also, in the best of
all possible worlds, it would be a curses app (or at least a
non-UI-specific engine with variable front ends).</p>

I'm using <a href="http://akregator.sourceforge.net/" title="sourceforge.net">akregator</a sourceforge.net> which is a wonderful KDE-based RSS/Atom aggregator.  What it does, is let you organize the feeds in the tree, and display how many unread articles there are in every feed. Very convenient, and you don't lose track of unread articles this way.
</p>
<p>
I highly recommend using RSS. It's so much more convenient than regularly visiting half-a-million sites just to check what's new.

<p> <a href="http://liferea.sf.net/" title="sf.net">Liferea</a sf.net> can sort of do this. Many others probably can too. How you get there is by way of the summary folder view, ie if you check the corresponding preference, upon selecting a folder, the aggregator will present a view of all the feeds' items as if it were a single feed. Then you also enable hiding read items, and that gets you overall very close to what you were looking for.</p>

<p>I agree it's not perfect. I've yet to find an aggregator that really makes it easy to keep up with a metric ton of feeds, mostly they all stick with the same tired 3-pane metaphor. It doesn't work too badly, I suppose, which is why noone's bothered to go one better.</p>

<p>I've been planning to write my own, with a very different UI from what's common, but I have no idea when that'll be, if ever. It'll definitely be a Gtk2-Perl UI tho, curses apps are kind of impractical seeing as feeds tend to contain HTML.</p>
