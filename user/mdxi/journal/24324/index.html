<p><p>Well. I successfully burnt myself out in last week's orgy of 
productivity, but I seem to be recovering okay. Didn't touch Olive 
until late last night, when I managed to make and handful of small and 
one or two not-so-small improvements, but the milestone for beta 4 
(the feed editing interface) is still just a stub.</p>

<p>Also, I promised Ash that I'd write her some docs (basically the same 
docs which have been promised to someone else for a ludicrous amount 
of time), so that needs doing. Being able to talk to her face-to-face 
about things finally gave me some good ideas for where I should start, 
so that's something. Of course, I'd like to do it in Mint, but Mint is 
still just a heap of potential and scraps of code, so I'll have to do 
it in plaintext. Editing <span class="caps">HTML</span> hurts too bad to even think about.</p>

<p>Tangential to that: should the Olive manual be a pretty <span class="caps">HTML</span> document 
with screenshots, or would it make more sense to structure it as a 
text document with ascii-art screens? My design-fag half says the 
former but the rest of me thinks that's stupid (graphical manual for a 
curses application).</p>

<h2>Burnout</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Aristotle/">Aristotle</a> on 2005-04-23T10:42:16</h3>
<p>I know that feeling all too well. I&#8217;ve amazed myself at times by materializing a few thousand lines of code out of thin air in a weekend, but I can never sustain that kind of productivity for any extended period of time, and it&#8217;s always followed by a long recovery period. Sometimes I don&#8217;t touch the code again for months on end.</p>

<p>As far as documentation is concerned, take a look at <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/" title="daringfireball.net">Markdown</a daringfireball.net>.</p>
