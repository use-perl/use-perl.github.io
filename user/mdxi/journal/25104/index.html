<div class="span8">
<p><p>I had originally planned for this space to be used for a thoughtful 
and eloquent look at Apple's recently-announced move from <span class="caps">PPC</span> to x86, 
including a historical perspective at their habit of abandoning 
promising things just before (or as) they get really good (OpenDoc, 
Newton) and a look at the risks and benefits of this latest sudden 
move. Instead, as I have just had the most frustrating Apple software 
moment of my life, I give you the following:</p>

<p>I hope Apple dies.</p>

<p>I've never used a Mac as my primary working environment, because you 
just can't wrap them around yourself and make it an extension of your 
mind the way you can with a "pure" Unix. At least I, as a developer 
and nerd, cannot. I know there are people with different slants (Dan) 
who <em>do</em> get that feeling from the Mac <span class="caps">UI. </span></p>

<p>But still, I've used Macs continuously since 1998, and have used every 
version of the OS since 7.6, and the <em>polish and elegance</em> of it made 
a huge impact on the way I think about how programs should work, even 
though I largely prefer not to even work in <span class="caps">GUI</span> space. I learned that 
anything reasonable, when tried, should work the way you'd think it 
would, and maybe some unreasonable things should to. I learned that 
you should try to trap as many problems as possible and handle them as 
gracefully as possible. I learned that its your (the software's) job 
to let the user get their work done, not to shove yourself in their 
face and dance about telling them how great you are.</p>

<p>I learned these things from the old-line Mac OSen, especially 8.1, 
which is still my favorite of them all. I learned them again from 
Newton <span class="caps">OS 2,</span> which is still, in my opinion, the most elegantly crafted 
piece of user-targetted software ever written. (Even though it had some 
<em>really</em> bad error messages..."-10061", "-16022", "-10582" anyone?)</p>

<p>The transition to <span class="caps">OS X</span> was rough, but all the failthful (myself 
included) felt sure that things would get better. The iApps were great 
(though one should remember that they are a product of the <span class="caps">OS9</span> era, 
and <em>not</em> <span class="caps">OS X</span>) and things did seem to steadily improve with each new 
point-release. I'm not sure that this trend is still continuing, 
however. For a while now I've had this niggling feeling that some of 
the polish is wearing off, that some of the rough edges are showing 
through where they didn't used to.</p>

<p>But it was nothing big enough to complain about, and no one else 
seemed to notice. Over the past 2 years I've gone from being something 
of an Apple apologist in my nerdier circles to being the one who's 
always spouting off cautionary tales and playing a wizened Devil's 
advocate to the newly converted Mac Faithful with their shiny laptops 
and lickable interfaces. I've even aquired a stock phrase for these 
situations: "Use Apple, Love Apple, but never Trust Apple".</p>

<p>And I don't just say that to be trendily anticorporate or 
iconiclastically anti-Apple. I say it because, though I count myself a 
newbie compared to true hardcore Apple users, I've been around long 
enough to see lots of Apple-screwing-its-users(and-developers) 
action. I personally got it in the Newton debacle -- that's where I 
learned exactly what the "mercurial" in "Steve Jobs, Apple's mercurial 
<span class="caps">CEO</span>" means, but that's a far cry from the only example. There were the 
clones. There was OpenDoc. There was the Performas which were promised 
to be upgradable but weren't. There was the 5&times;00 and 6&times;00 series 
PowerMacs. There were the G4s that shipped half a year late. There was 
shoving <span class="caps">OS X </span>(NeXTSTEP) down everyone's throats. And you know 
Searchlight, the brand new thing that no one really wanted in 10.4? 
Well no one really wanted it back in <span class="caps">OS8.5</span> either, when it <em>also</em> tied 
up your machine for hours on end and was generally useless. And last 
but not least, remember the <span class="caps">G5,</span> which was The Future and would totally 
trounce everything, ever?</p>

<p>The point is: don't unquestioningly buy into Apple's party line, no 
matter how strong the <span class="caps">RDF</span> may be. Once the gloss of the Stevenote 
wears off a bit, think hard about what's actually going on.</p>

<p>Anyhow, my recent crappy experience is as follows: I wanted to take a 
whole bunch of <span class="caps">JPEG</span> images and turn them into a little movie set to 
music, using iMovie. I figured that since iMovie now has that "Ken 
Burns" effect, that this would be really easy. Except that it turns 
out that iMovie can now only import images from iPhoto libraries. This 
made me grumble a bit, but I concede that it's easier than going 
File-&gt;Import several thousand times, so I started up iPhoto and told 
it to import <strong>one</strong> of the directories of images I wanted to use (about 
2500 files). It sat there "Importing..." for several minutes, and then 
started displaying a thumbnail of each image as it did whatever arcane 
magicks it needs to turn this stack of files into whatever it uses on 
the inside. I walked off to go do something else. Several minutes 
later, the progress bar was at around 50%, so I walked off 
again. Several more minutes later, there was a dialog telling me that 
one of the images was corrupt. Well, that's okay with me, really. I 
can stand to lose one out of about 30,000 images, so I clicked "OK", 
and the dialog went away.</p>

<p>And iPhoto sat there, doing nothing, a blank slate, no indication that 
I had ever asked it to do anything. I had assumed it would immediately 
pick up where it left off, rounting around this one bad image (not 
even a bad <em>file</em>, just bad <span class="caps">JPEG </span><em>data</em>), or at least ask me if I 
wanted it to keep going, save what it had done so far, or just 
quit. Nope, it just quit. I realized that, having assumed that this 
Apple app would behave like an Apple app, I had rather glossed over 
the dialog and didn't actually know the name of the offending file 
(except that it started with an 'f').</p>

<p>This is not how Apple software is supposed to behave. I submit to you, 
Dear Reader, that something fundamental has <em>changed</em> at One Infinite 
Loop.</p>

<p>So why is the Finder still single-threaded? Why does it still spod 
when one makes the vile error of causing a large-ish media file to 
appear in the preview pane of column view? Why does column view still 
not remember column widths and keep doing what the user has told it to 
do? Why can one not even depend on column view being <em>used</em> all the 
time, even after one has told Finder to do so? Why these small 
annoyances and dozens more like them? I used to think it was because 
Apple was busy bootstrapping a new OS and was more concerned with 
getting it right under the hood before turning their practiced eye to 
fairly minor UI quibbles. But now I think it's because the old Apple, 
which cared deeply about the craftmanship of software tools, and which 
taught me to do the same, is gone. Replaced by a fast-talking, 
fast-walking, high-chrome somewhat-slipshod company with an 
opportunistic worldview, targetting the Great Unwashed, who value a 
lack of value above all else. In other words, they are the Very Model 
of a Modern Multinational.</p>

<p>Knowing His Steveness, who has more moxie and business acumen in his 
middle finger than I'll ever have altogether, it'll probably work 
out. And being the mark for Apple that I am, unless things get 
<em>really</em> bad, I'll probably keep supporting them as the saner 
alternative for normal people, but I won't be cheering them on as I 
once did.</p>

<p>In other news, i got an Olive bug report from Poland today. Someone 
out there found a new way to be nonconformant with the <span class="caps">RFC822</span> date 
definition, and I wasn't catching it. I'm getting perilously close to 
having a complete workaround library for this sort of thing...RJBS 
says that <span class="caps">SIMON</span> has something like that, and as much as I hate to add 
another dep to Olive, it might be the right thing to do. One way or 
the other, that issue will be fixed in b7.</p>
