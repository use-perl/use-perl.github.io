<p>E3 starts tuesday. This is when we finally get some idea of how 
Episode III may shape up.</p>

<p>Microsoft has finally come clean with some actual detail about their 
system, and it looks pretty good. They've realized that the best way 
to make a gaming console actually <strong>isn't</strong> to pretend that it's a 
really cheap <span class="caps">PC </span>(though they persist with their "vision" of a unified 
"media center"). The hardware is impressive. The idea of everyone 
getting online access would be a world-beater, but they only mean 
everyone gets chatting and downloadables, etc. You still have to pay 
for multiplayer stuffs. Gameplay on the few titles they've shown 
looks...well, it looks like you'd expect. Better. Smoother. The big 
question in my mind is: will the <span class="caps">XBOX2</span> have any games worth playing? 
The original finally gained about 5 titles which weren't first-person 
shooters, fighters, or racing games; can this iteration do better? The 
controllers still look sucky though. Little tiny glossy buttons is 
<strong>still</strong> not the way to make a good controller, and making the gigantic 
logo in the middle light up doesn't change this.</p>

<p>Sony hasn't gone public with the <span class="caps">PS3</span> yet. There's been rumors and 
conference whitepapers on its processors (note the non-use of "CPU"), 
but no hard data on the actual configuration of the system. There are 
screenshots of games coming out now, and they look...they look like 
renders. I've read several people's statements that screenshots no 
longer do games justice, and I believe it. I'm gonna need to see this 
stuff in motion. I'm not worried about games for the <span class="caps">PS3 </span>-- it has all 
the Japanese developers behind it, and with the runaway success of 
Katamari Damacy, I am hoping that more of them will be willing to 
release more of their "quirky" games to the North American market. I'm 
also sure that the <span class="caps">PS3</span> will have built-in networking capabilities (any 
whitepaper on the Cell processor makes this clear) but no one knows 
what Sony is going to do with this. I'll also be pretty disappointed 
if there's no hard drive...memory cards suck balls, and you're gonna 
want to do <strong>something</strong> with that ethernet jack, right?</p>

<p>Nintendo isn't showing the Revolution at <span class="caps">E3,</span> and personally, I'm 
having a hard time caring. In recent years they've done nothing but 
take a "we know what you want better than you do" attitude and make 
promises which haven't even vaguely been kept. They're not showing the 
R because if they did "people wouls steal [their] ideas". You may 
remember that this is the reason Mario 128 didn't show at the <span class="caps">LAST</span> 
<span class="caps">E3. </span>Remember Mario 128? Remember how Mario Sunshine was a stopgap 
side-story and not the tru successor to Mario 64? Remember how Mario 
128 would be out real soon now? In 2002? This behavior sounds 
strangely familiar somehow...can't quite put my finger on it...hmm. 
Anyhow, I'm really thinking Nintendo needs to be reborn as a 
software-only company, like Sega has. Then I won't need to buy a whole 
freakin' console just to play the next Zelda game.</p>
