<div class="span8">
<p><p>Lorcan Dempsey recently wrote about a <a href="http://ddcresearch.oclc.org/ebooks/fileServer">DDS browser</a> which <span class="caps">OCLC</span> has 
implemented, and it reminded me that I <em>tried</em> to do basically the 
same thing a couple of years ago with the Library of Congress 
Classification Outline. His very literally drills down, starting with 
the top 100-level <span class="caps">DDS</span> categories and placing the next level under that 
as the user selects which segment to expand. My design, which never 
got past the static mockup stage, started with the user picking a 
top-level <span class="caps">LCCO</span> category, which it then exploded in vertical stacks 
progressing to the <em>right</em>.</p>

<p>This worked pretty nicely with <strong>A</strong> (General Works), but as soon as I 
started trying to mock up <strong>B</strong> (Philosophy, Psychology, Religion), the 
complexity spiralled and my abortive effort ended up looking like a 
microphotograph of a <span class="caps">CPU,</span> there were so many shadings and colors 
arrayed around each other.</p>

<p>Which brings me back to an old bitch: there are no good classification 
systems. The <span class="caps">LCCO</span> seems nice at first, but the intricacies of 
generating call letters for it are nigh-impenetrable (I know the 
Letter Digits Dot Digits Cutter OptionalYear part, but what's the 
<em>other</em> thing that looks like a secondary Cutter, which sometimes 
follows the year? And how to I <em>generate</em> Cutters anyway? And are they 
guaranteed unique or are collisions allowed? Why isn't this 
information public knowledge?). On top of this, the <span class="caps">LCCO</span> was last 
overhauled beginning around 1900 and finishing around 1960, resulting 
in huge swathes of modern works and fields of endeavor being shoved 
into sub-decimal categorization spaces, while American History gets 
two whole top-level letters. I'm sure this was fabulous for the actual 
Library of Congress, at the turn of the last century, but it's not so 
good for dealing with the modern world where we expect things to be 
designed for maximal flexibility and expansibility.</p>

<p>On the other hand we have the <span class="caps">DDC </span>(and <span class="caps">UDC,</span> which is <span class="caps">DDC</span> but not). The 
<span class="caps">DDC,</span> as most people are completely unaware, is owned by a corporation 
who charges license fees to use it and has a history of suing people 
who aren't aware of this. It should therefore be viewed as unsuitable 
for use in public/volunteer projects (like the one I'll get to in a 
second).</p>

<p>I have recently become aware of some <em>fringe</em> categorization schemes, 
such as Bliss, but I don't see them as any more of a win than anything 
else.</p>

<p>At this point you may think I'm a big fan of "folksonomies" and "tags" 
and that sort of thing, but I'm not. Very few people have the mindset 
which allows for things like data integrity, logical categorization, 
and stripping of spurious/redundant data. Flexibility and 
expansibility are always good but mob rule is never the answer, and 
that's all the folksonomy movement is. I'm down on pure democracy for 
the same reason the founders of the US government were: most people 
are so lazy can't even be trusted to make informed decisions which 
affect themselves.</p>

<p>I don't have an answer, only complaints. Moving on...</p>

<p>Much has been made (and made and made and made) of the recent 
interactions between Google and libraries. I'm very much of the 
opinion that libraries need to hurry the fuck up and actually get 
their collections online, as opposed to just data <em>about</em> their 
collections (yes, yes, whatever you're thinking, <em>I know</em>, but 
seriously people, wasn't the Internet supposed to be something a 
little better than porn and livejournal?), but I don't think Google is 
the right way to go about it.</p>

<p>For years I've been very slowly working on planning (and planning and 
planning) a framework for publishing text collections, but let's not 
talk about that now; let's talk about the idea which followed that 
one, which I call Black (all my project names are colors). In a 
nutshell: it's a combination of <span class="caps">RSS</span> and distributed source control.</p>

<p>Imagine that sites have created electronic collections -- not as web 
pages, but as collection data and content data (preferably with the 
text bits in small-ish chunks and transformable, diplay device neutral 
markup) in databases. Now imagine that you can flip a permissions bit 
on any document in the collection and your front-end collection server 
will inform an upstream meta-collection (Black) server of this. Now 
imagine networks of <em>these</em> servers, throwing collections data back 
and forth between each other. Now imagine that this network of "metaservers" is searchable, and that feeds of newly available 
documents are being served to other sites with their own collections 
engines in place.</p>

<p>Site B's admins or users see something interesting on the new docs 
feed (or turn it up in a search) and send a subscription request to their upstream Black server. A 
subscription to that document is set up, and a BitTorrent style copy 
operation begins, fetching the doc from Site A as well as any other 
sites which also have copies.</p>

<p>Three weeks later Site A makes changes to the doc. When it is 
republished on their internal system, messages are passed to the Black 
servers about the new version, and as messages filter through the 
network subscriber sites begin picking up the deltas (the changed 
and/or new and/or deleted bits).</p>

<p>Hey look, it's a worldwide, self-replicating, self-updating, 
fault-tolerant, on-demand library!</p>

<p>Things like allowing subscriber sites to keep full version histories 
or only newest versions, yadda yadda yadda are all fairly simple and 
eminently do-able. The only real problems are:</p>


<ol>
<li>Writing the Black server software</li>
<li>Codifying the messaging format (protocols)</li>
<li>Ensuring that database schema are compatible with each other (or 
that compatibility layers are available)</li>
</ol>

<p>(Note that here I am actually thinking of volunteers putting their own 
collections online, either completely on their own or in small 
collectives which would probably be focused around certain topics. The 
whole reason I started thinking about this stuff is because I want to 
share my old textbook, cookbook, and asian history collections.)</p>

<p>Some people probably think that things like "intellectual property 
rights" are another issue, but I honestly don't care. My concern is 
maintaining and communicating human knowledge and our shared body of 
cultural works, not making sure a multinational corporation is 
properly compensated for the work of a long-dead author. I am 
concerned with saving (and making avilable) the information in all the 
mouldering, brittle, and disintegrating books around the world, not in 
making it easier to pirate Harry Potter book 7. A trust metric of some 
sort might be a good tool to assist human Black server admins, but I 
really believe that policing the collections is a policy issue and not 
a technological one.</p>

<p>To all the real librarians who just sat through this, I'd like to 
apologize if my ignorance and hubris has insulted you.</p>

<h2>Institutional repositories</h2>

You might be interested in some of the work going on in academic libraries around "institutional repositories." It's early days yet, so I warn you that existing software frameworks are more than a little crude, but I think in time we'll get somewhere near where you're wanting to go.<br><br>The big names are DSpace, Fedora, and EPrints. Give 'em a look, and drop me a line if you have any questions.
