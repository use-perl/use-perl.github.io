<p><p>Did nothing for most of the day, then went for a walk around downtown 
which evolved into a drive out into the country and an exploration of 
an abandoned quarry. It turned out not to be a quarry in the classical 
movie depiction sense of a big deep square hole dug into a deposit of 
rock, but was instead where people had dynamited their way <em>into</em> a 
natural granite dome. I did a tiny bit of scrambling on the exposed 
face, which was an unexpectedly large amount of fun.</p>

<p>For dinner, on a whim I picked up a pack of Morningstar veggie burger 
things. They taste like a flavorful version of what we were served in 
the school cafeteria, and perusal of the nutrition facts shows that 
they're actually good for you (high in fiber, potassium, and 
protein). Weird.</p>

<p>Speaking of dinner, the other day on a whim I took some cubed pork 
steak, coated them in storebought chicken breading, panfried them, and 
then covered them in peppered milk gravy. Amazingly tasty. Next time 
I'm going to soak them in buttermilk overnight first, then dip them in 
an egg wash before breading. And if that goes well, I'm gonna start 
work on my own coating mixture (I'm thinking 2 parts white flour and 
one part yellow corn meal (for texture), salt, pepper, <span class="caps">MSG,</span> and some 
small amount of herbs).</p>
