<p><p>Early this afternoon we decided to go check out the trail which we 
didn't exactly find back in October. We found it this time. It's 
called Burgess Mountain trail, and it's just a short (1/4 mile, 
probably) uphill hike from a forestry road to the top of "Burgess 
Mountain", where you can see a geodetic benchmark and a lot of rocky 
outcropping.</p>

<p>The afternoon and hike (we had first gone a lot further in the 
opposite direction along a firebreak) were really nice, and the top of 
the hill was a great spot to just sit and listen to the nothing on a 
spring day. But that's just <strong>not</strong> a mountain. "Big hill", 
sure. "Higher than local mean elevation isolated upthrusting of 
granite", why not. "Mountain", no. According to geocaching.com the 
elevation there is 822 feet and I'm pretty sure it's no more than 
70-100 feet above the access road to it. Which leads to...</p>

<p>There had recently been a controlled burn in the area, so all the 
scrub was gone. In a way it kinda sucked, because the sky and the 
spring-greening trees were beautiful, but the carbon and dead things 
groundcover was pretty ugly. One of the upsides was that you could 
easilly see all the weird rock outcroppings which are indigenous to 
the area, including this one weird one near the survey marker, which 
looked like someone had <em>done</em> something to it. Turned out someone had 
stuck a 30mm ammo can into a crevice and stacked smaller rocks atop 
it. I'd found a geocache, completely bby accident! It was pretty 
cool. I didn't take anything or leave anythinig, but I did read the 
logbook inside and add a note myself. I think I'd like to do it some 
more, but without a <span class="caps">GPS</span> unit, I'm pretty sure most caches will be next 
to impossible to find. Tracking geodetic benchmarks might be better, 
as they all have old text descriptions.</p>

<p>Wrote zero lines of code today. Nice.</p>
