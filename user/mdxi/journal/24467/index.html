<div class="span8">
<p><p>I got nothing done this week because very nearly the whole thing was 
spent in protracted <span class="caps">IRC</span>-based job negotiations. It was a cool job, for 
which I was recommended by a friend, and the company seemed very 
interested in me, but eventually things fell apart over salary. The 
job would have had us moving from our current, very inexpensive, 
location to a new, integer multiples more expensive, location where 
only I would have had a job, and the offered salary was clearly 
tailored for single person or a couple in a dual income situation.</p>

<p>With the job market like it is, I was unwilling to make such a 
move. The person I was talking with seemed quite surprised and 
confused by my stance and insistence on more money before I'd say yes; 
I was shocked and angered by his seemingly harsh attitude and 
dismissal of my concerns. </p>

<p>The punchline is that he was willing to agree to hire me but give me a 
reasonable amount of leadtime for my wife to try to find a job before 
expecting me to move up there, but he only told me this as 
negotiations were in full-on implosion mode. Suddenly everyone's 
positions made sense to everyone, but it was far, far too late.</p>

<p>During the dark days of 2003 this would have been catastrophic instead 
of merely disappointing, but still it seems increasingly certain that 
my destiny is to be a walking, talking cautionary tale for the benefit 
of others.</p>
