<div class="span8">
<p><p>The <span class="caps">PS2</span> version, and not the C=64 or Apple ][ version, just for 
clarity.</p>

<p>Waltzed through it in about 12 hours thanks to turning on the 
invincibility cheat and the 100X damage cheat (not a typo) and just 
blasting my way through with the balletics of dual-wield (broadsword 
in one hand, dirk in the other). </p>

<p>It's an enjoyable game, is quite funny (K laughed out loud quite a 
bit), and the treble endings are a neat bit, though they're all <span class="caps">WAY</span> 
too short. How can you not like a game with dance-battling zombies and 
undead livestock? The humor is split between beating-you-in-the-head 
unsubtlety and never-explained-wry-touches (I didn't see the logic of 
undead sheep casting sleep spells until near the end of the 
game). Also, having a semitransparent undead puppy is the best thing 
ever.</p>

<p>The biggest problem is that despite being a light, Diablo-style, 
comedy-oriented, action <span class="caps">RPG, </span>Bard's Tale suffers badly from <span class="caps">FF6</span> 
syndrome (AKA <span class="caps">FF </span>Plot Death). For the uninitated, this is where a game 
has a very enjoyable and engrossing storyline until halfway through 
the game, where Some Bad Event transpires and suddenly it's just one 
dungeon crawl after another, with tiny bits of plot thrown in to keep 
you from breaking things. It <em>specifically</em> suffers from <span class="caps">FF6</span> syndrome 
in that there actually is a <span class="caps">WOR</span> type scenario, which closes off lots 
of things you may have been saving up for or wanting to come back to, 
with no warning.</p>

<p>There are some unlockable extras, but they're rather poorly 
implemented (the art galleries, for instance, in addition to not being 
zoom/pannable, are uncontrollable slideshows).</p>

<p>Final nitpick: it claims to be a naughty, bawdy game, and has the M 
rating to match, but there's nothing in here you wouldn't see or hear 
with far more frequency in a PG-13 movie. Since they rated themselves 
M, they should have gone all out and just streamlined actual cussing 
and nudity into the game as <em>God of War</em> did (have I mentioned how 
much fun <em>God of War</em> was?)</p>

<p>It's definitely fun and satisfying as a rental. I don't think I'd want 
to buy it though.</p>
