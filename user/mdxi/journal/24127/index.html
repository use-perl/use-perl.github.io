<div class="span8">
<p><p>Spent most of yesterday watching Japanese TV with <span class="caps">K. </span>Now that she's 
officially in grad school, she has cranked her media-immersion levels 
way up, which is okay with me. </p>

<p>Yesterday's series was "Ojiisan", which is about a grumpy old doctor 
with three grown kids, all of whom cause him problems by getting 
pregnant while unwed, not wanting to take over the family business 
(for which he sacrificed a promising career elsewhere on principle), 
and generally being worthless. Then he gets mad at them and they move 
out but everybody really loves each other deep down but just can't 
admit it so things spiral further and further out of control. This is, 
in fact, the <span class="caps">EXACT SAME PLOT</span> as the <span class="caps">LAST</span> drama we watched. In fact, 
the lead (grumpy old man) is the same actor. A complete list of 
differences looks pretty much like this:</p>


<ol>
<li>The mother somehow managed to survive in this one (Japan has a touch 
  of My Three Sons syndrome in the TV department)</li>
<li>Family business is a clinic instead of a soba restaurant</li>
<li>Male lead quit promising career out of anger at treatment of 
  patients at university hospital instead of love for dearly departed 
  wife</li>
<li>There's a son and two daughters, instead of three daughters</li>
</ol>

<p>and that's pretty much it. Still, it's not bad stuff. But I don't 
think I'd be interested in seeing another iteration of it.</p>

<p>The newsreader, which is named Olive, is still in-progress. Due to 
spending time with K yesterday I didn't get as much done as I might 
have otherwise. Biggest achievements were getting the configuration 
panel hooked up to some actual logic, ripping out all the dummy story 
logic which I used to test the UI design, and starting on implementing 
a way to get <em>actual</em> data into the thing. I hope that my bedtime 
tonight I'll have a working newsreader, even though it'll probably be 
lacking the intelligence that I want.</p>
