<p>Long ago I discovered the joy of Roget's thesaurus. I do not mean a thesaurus labelled "Roget's", I mean that method of organizing and listing words by shades of meaning which was devised by Peter Mark Roget. Very shortly after I started learning perl, I had the thought that an online version of Roget's would be a very nice thing to have. Last night I finally decided to do it.<br/><br/>First I took a look around and discovered that while other people have done the same thing, their presentation *sucks*. IMO, half the point of Roget's is browsing up and down the sections once you've been pointed somewhere by the index, and all the existing web versions I looked at give you a single section, without even "prev" and "next" links. Ick.<br/><br/>I'll spare you the gory details. It's living over <a href='http://dict.collapsar.net/'>here</a> and ready for use/playing with/testing.<br/><br/>BUGS: the flatfile import is very good but not perfect. A few subsections are missing; accented characters (rare) are garbage. The index is machine-generated and doesn't have the intelligence of the crafted indices found in a paper copy (I have some ideas for using the imported database to create a better index once it's perfectly complete). Some more formatting of metadata would be nice.<br/><br/>Also: long-standing bug in kdict's browse-all mode fixed.</p>

I particularly like the multi-entry display.  You may have just inspired me to do a command-line Roget's  interface.<nobr> <wbr></nobr><code>:-)</code>

Oy! What a lovely and embarassing mistake to have sitting out there all weekend. Fixed now, many thanks.<br> <br>And I'm glad you like it.

No doubt Roget's method of indexing has its uses, but I find an alphabetical thesaurus far more useful.  It lets me get at my words a lot quicker.
