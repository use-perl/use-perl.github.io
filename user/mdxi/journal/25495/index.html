<p><p>I've been very busy while accomplishing very little. The job thinger 
is still in limbo, first and foremost. Hmmmm. Moving on.</p>

<p>A week ago, on a whim, I thought I'd see if I could manage to make a 
<span class="caps">ASCII</span>-art scrolling track/artist/album type display for the mp3 player 
I plan to write. It started well and went very quickly, but then I got 
bogged down in the fiddly bits of making the display animate properly, 
and ended up staring at it for 4 days without doing anything 
worthwhile. But during that time I did realize some problems with my 
initial approach, which made things go rather swimmingly when I sat 
down on Friday to make it go. Go it did, so yesterday I cleaned it up 
and isolated the logic into a module, which was released on the <span class="caps">CPAN</span> 
as Acme::Curses::Marquee. With that out of the way, and use of 
mpg321's remote mode, implementation of a non-sucky console mode mp3 
player should be nearly trivial once I figure out how it should 
behave.</p>

<p>Olive's manual is nearly complete. Once it is, I want to try to hunt 
down the first-list-entry-link bug and fix it, then release b8.</p>

<p>Moving on...Literally years ago I wrote a little story in the mode of 
a childrens' picturebook, but the project fell by the wayside because 
I can't draw at all and I didn't know any people who could (much less 
<em>would</em>) do the illustrations for me. A few months ago a friend 
volunteered to help out, but her life has rather taken off on its own, 
so she hasn't had time, and I never bothered her about it. This week, 
taking a gamble on a somewhat renewed acquaintance, I asked someone 
else if they'd be willing to give it a shot. She was agreeable, but 
had some other things to finish up before she could get started. I was 
overjoyed; after about 5 years of languishing, what's another few 
months?</p>

<p>When I told <em>another</em> friend about this, she got all excited and asked 
if she could be in on the project as well. It turns out that she's 
been hiding her art-light under a bushel for quite a while and wanted 
a chance to get back into things. Long story short, now I have two 
illustrators and may actually do the original long version of the 
project, instead of just the one story. So awesome.</p>

<p>Next up: movies. In a nutshell, don't watch any of these unless you 
wish to induce vomiting -- <em>Prom Night II</em>, <em>Hot Water</em> (AKA 
<em>Junior</em>), or <em>Rape Squad</em>. At least <em>Hot Water</em> features the sizable 
naked breasts of Suzanne DeLaurentiis, who would go on to produce 
<em>Rocky V</em> and <em>Mannequin 2</em>.</p>

<p><em>U-541</em> is predictable. So predictable that it's nearly a pastiche of 
submarine movies, but it's really quite good if you watch it right 
after <em>Rape Squad</em>.</p>

<p><em>Tougher Than Leather</em> is laughably bad; if only the whole movie had 
been Jam-master Jay foolin' with the Beastie Boys and Run pretending 
not to like the receptionist chick. Rick Rubin should be killed for 
his role <em>in</em> the film as well as his roles in <em>producing</em> the 
film. Dave Mustaine sucks.</p>

<p><em>No Retreat, No Surrender</em> is the best movie I've ever seen where 
Jean-Claude Van Damme plays a Russian karate champ who is part of a 
faceless corporation's evil ploy to win amateur karate titles on the 
west coast of the <span class="caps">US,</span> but is foiled by a teenager in too-tight jeans 
who is trained by the ghost of Bruce Lee.</p>

<p>That is all for today.</p>
