<div class="span8">
<p><p>Woke up this morning and was surprised to see Amy on <span class="caps">AIM. </span>She told me 
she'd started working at the hospital on a 7-7 (1900-0700) shift, so 
she was exhausted and just about to go to bed. If we get to move back 
to Athens soon, I should go cook for her some weekend (or whenever 
she's off).</p>

<p>Olive b7 was released today. It didn't have the 2 big things I wanted 
it to have (OPML import, <span class="caps">ATOM</span> feed support), but so many little fixes 
and additions had piled up I just didn't want to sit on them 
anymore. Then the jerkholes at freshmeat decided to lop half of my 
"Changes" statement out of their release announcement, because 
apparently the other 100 or so bytes would have just been too much for 
their system to cope with. </p>

<p>Someone really needs to implement a non-sucky freshmeat. I know their 
(self-selected) task is a really cruddy one, but they've just gotten 
rather cruddy themselves in many ways (most notably their nebulous 
"non-trivial" requirement, which keeps a lot of <em>useful</em> but <em>small</em> 
software out of their listings but ensures a neverending stream of <span class="caps">PHP</span> 
image galleries and the like).</p>

<p>Finally pulling the diary2 code into a svn repo so I can set up a 
dev install on fornax and do some work on hit here and there. Nic 
wants comments first, so that's the major thing I'll work on, but I 
need to get prev/next in there (this can be stolen straight from <em>my</em> 
diary code) and bolt on <span class="caps">RSS</span> generation on publish (also very very 
simple).</p>

<p>Got into an interesting job-related email exchange involving <em>Scheme</em> 
today. More on that later.</p>
</p>

Coincidentally, Freshmeat have just published my Sprog release announcement after a lengthy delay while they 'edited' the text (and changed the meaning of a few key phrases).  Immediately before my announcement was one for a PHP image gallery<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)
