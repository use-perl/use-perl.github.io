<div class="span8">
<p><p>The Ninety-Ninety Rule has reared its ugly head on Olive 
development. After three days of whipping along at thoroughly 
unbelievable (for me) speeds, I hit a roadblock named <span class="caps">XML. </span>Or <span class="caps">RSS,</span> 
, or both, depending on exactly what time it was.</p>

<p>I started an attempt to actually slurp in and parse <span class="caps">RSS</span> feeds using 
<span class="caps">XML</span>::RSS::Parser because it was the first match on <span class="caps">CPAN</span> and it looked 
fairly promising. While reading its docs I discovered <span class="caps">XML</span>::RAI, which 
was like a magic bullet that did exactly what I wanted to do: read an 
<span class="caps">RSS</span> feed and turn it into a uniform, easilly accessible data 
structure.</p>

<p>This is harder than it sounds because there are so many varieties of 
<span class="caps">RSS,</span> including 2 mutually incompatible versions which are both named 
"RSS 2.0".</p>

<p><span class="caps">XML</span>::RAI seemed to work on initial tests, and I was very happy, but it 
fell down hard on all but the smallest datasets. When I first tried 
the <span class="caps">BBC</span>'s front page feed -- 15k, 30-40 entries, not a big file -- 
each item iteration was taking noticably longer. First a hint longer, 
then a second longer, then 3, then 5, then 15, then 30. top(1) 
revealed that <span class="caps">RAM</span> usage had shot to 135M (real!) and was climbing by 
another 20M every second. I killed it before the kernel had to do 
it. Apparently the root problem is that it's Very Clever and uses 
autoloading to create more or less <em>everything</em> on the 
fly. Structures, objects, creators, accessors, all of it generated at 
runtime by a fairly small, very dense wodge of code.</p>

<p>Elegance is good, but Clever kills.</p>

<p>I really wanted to make <span class="caps">SOMETHING</span> show up in the top pane before 
sleeping, so I started ransacking <span class="caps">CPAN</span> and Google for options. My 
problem at this phase can be seen first-hand by searching for "xml rss 
perl" and laughing heartily to yourself. I tried...I tried a lot of 
things. I can only remember <span class="caps">XML</span>::Twig, <span class="caps">XML</span>::Parser, but there was a 
frenzy of cpan installs late last night. Finally I discovered 
<span class="caps">XML</span>::Simple which did pretty much what I wanted, except that it knew 
nothing about <span class="caps">RSS,</span> so I'd have to write that part myself. I could deal 
with that. <span class="caps">RSS2</span> is well-specified and simple enough that I picked it 
and made fairly short work of things.</p>

<p><span class="caps">EXCEPT</span> for discovering that <span class="caps">RSS2</span> dates are themselves specified by 
<span class="caps">RFC</span>-822 (already knew this part), which was written in 1982, which was 
before the <span class="caps">Y2K</span> era. That's right, even tnough everyone uses 4-digit 
years, 2-digit dates are legal. And the <span class="caps">BBC,</span> who are part of my test 
suite, use 2 digit dates in their <span class="caps">RSS2</span> feeds. Great big special case 
hackery. Then I went to bed. At 0835h. And woke up 2 hours later.</p>

<p>Since then I've hooked up the whole Add -&gt; Fetch -&gt; Parse -&gt; 
(Re)Display chain, and it's working pretty well. Except that unicode 
fucks my spacing in the story selector pane. Double-width chars stomp 
at right, odd half-width spaces (Cyrillic) yank stuff to the 
left. Spent abuot 3 hours fooling with that, including a really 
audacious attempt at creating 3 separate listboxes linked by 
OnSelectChange callbacks. It actually <strong>worked</strong> except that only the 
<strong>focused</strong> listbox has the reverse-video indicator, and nonfocused ones 
don't scroll. Their selected item did change and become highlighted in 
sync with the focused list though. Neat, but a waste of an hour. For 
right now I have given up on unicode correctness.</p>

<p>So what's left? Pretty much everything dealing with auto-fetching 
feeds and folding in story updates. Hopefully that won't be too 
difficult, as it involves neither <span class="caps">XML</span> or Unicode.</p>
