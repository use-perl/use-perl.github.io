<p>The public side is almost done.<br/><br/>Lookup is much smarter than it was 4 days ago and presentation is improved as well. I think all the remaining rough spots are the kinds that will largely resolve themselves through actual use pointing the way to the answers.<br/><br/>Detail view now understands multiple selections from the lookup summary. and is getting better in the presentation department -- but is nowhere near the polish of lookup.<br/><br/>The db had a fairly major change requiring a large number of small changes to all existing scripts. The init script now grants proper permissions after recreating the db and has an improved "odometer" display for loading records.<br/><br/>The "About" blurb has been updated.<br/><br/>Advanced Search is finally being built and will be even more fearsomely boring to construct than I anticipated.<br/><br/>After that it's on to the New Entry and Editing bits, which will never even be exported to a world-accessible server, so it'll be functionally complete as far as gaijin are concerned.<br/><br/>There's still holes/problems/dupes in the data, but that's not my responsibility on this project :-)<br/><br/>I'm updating the public copy with new code and data as I write this, so if you'd like to play then kick it on over to dict.collapsar.net and get down with your bad self.</p>
