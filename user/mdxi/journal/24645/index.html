<p><p>23:56 &lt;@bda&gt; It's weird... 
23:56 &lt;@bda&gt; Going from Children of Dune to God Emperor was kind of like... 
23:56 &lt;@bda&gt; Going from Stormwind to Daranassas. 
23:56 &lt;@bda&gt; ... 
23:56  * bda sighs. 
23:57 &lt;@bda&gt; brb, punching self in groin. 
23:57 &lt;@ejp&gt; heh 
23:57 &lt; solios&gt; the Second Half of Dune is only for the hardcore. 
23:57 &lt; solios&gt; it's like the First Half of star wars. :P 
23:57 &lt; solios&gt; all the gay, but you read it anyway because you liked the first half. 
23:57 &lt;@bda&gt; According to to O'Donnell, Herbert wrote the first three books at once. 
23:57 &lt;@bda&gt; Which makes sense. 
23:57 &lt; solios&gt; they read like it. 
23:57 &lt; solios&gt; more or less. 
23:57 &lt;@bda&gt; Taken as a whole, they're Complete. 
23:58 &lt; solios&gt; I mean, there's a <span class="caps">HUGE</span> paradigm shift after Dune. 
23:58 &lt;@bda&gt; Paul bowing out from becoming The Mantrout. 
23:58 &lt; solios&gt; so it stands more to reason that he wrote Dune, <span class="caps">THEN</span> wrote Messiah and Children. 
23:58 &lt;@bda&gt; Yeah. 
23:58 &lt;@bda&gt; Well. 
23:58 &lt; solios&gt; but they're logical extrapolations of what's going on in Dune. 
23:58 &lt; solios&gt; I mean, you <span class="caps">KNOW</span> that's where it <span class="caps">GOES.</span> 
23:58 &lt;@bda&gt; Supposedly he had it all in his head and it was all written at once. 
23:58 &lt;@bda&gt; Yeah. 
23:58 &lt;@bda&gt; And then... 
23:58 &lt;@bda&gt; <span class="caps">THREE THOUSAND YEARS IN THE FUTAR</span> 
23:58 &lt;@bda&gt; <span class="caps">DUM DUM DUM</span> 
23:58 &lt;@bda&gt; I dunno. 
00:01 &lt; mdxi&gt; Duncan Idaho <span class="caps">MCMLXVII</span> strode with purpose into Leto's chamber, hand raised in the challenging gesture of a teacher to a familiar student. "Now look here," he said, "I'm getting pretty tired of living in 20 minute spurts. You've really got to..." His words were cut off as the transmogrified Leto, hearing Duncan's words through the spice haze and his degenerating humanity, bellowed with rage and rolled about the chamber, crushing his old mentor with his bulk. 
00:01 &lt; mdxi&gt; "Well fuck," said the Tlilaxau, "back to work..." 
00:02  * bda stares at mdxi. 
00:02 &lt;@bda&gt; &gt;_&lt; 
00:02 &lt; solios&gt; mdxi: dude, he'll be there in about six pages.  Don't spoil any more of it for him.</p>
