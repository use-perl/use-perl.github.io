<p>I'm a fiend for data presentation. I want as much as possible, organized as well as possible, and in a manner which is as flexible as possible. I like this aspect of UI design (as opposed to, say, the "adding useless chrome to make things k-rad" part of UI design), and I feel really irritated when I am in a situation where I do not have any control or poor control over data I am working with.<br/><br/>My situation at work is an example of this. I'll spare you the details; trust me, you don't want them.<br/><br/>Anyway, despite it not being my job to do anything remotely resembling coding, and not being paid anything even remotely resembling a decent salary, I find myself planning code. I have a couple of pieces of steno pad paper covered with design notes for an ordering/tracking system and a corporate messaging system (not IM, not BBS, some third thing -- which I may write on my own, anyway, because I think the concept that popped into my head is interesting).<br/><br/>I just can't not try to fix it when something is bugging me, especially when I know I can do it, well, with just a little time and effort. So far I've kept my damned mouth shut because I know nothing good will come of this. I just don't think the management team where I am is equipped to deal with a proposal of that nature, and I don't think the Corp IT lamers would like it either.<br/><br/>Also, I have more than enough personal stuff to keep me busy until after I'm dead.<br/><br/>Sigh.</p>
