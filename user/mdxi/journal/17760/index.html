<p>Finally managed to wring some (however small) amount of work from myself tonight, and on no less than TWO projects!<br/><br/>First I spent about an hour installing TeX and other pre-requisites for LyX, which now runs quite nicely on OS X (though huge points off for using the gnarly Qt/Winders file picker instead of the native one), then I forced myself to actually open HTBR up and <i>do something to it</i>. I wrote one new sentence and frobbed one old paragraph, but it's a start. I'm even considering making dead-tree copies available via cafepress publishing when it's ready.<br/><br/>On a HTBR-related note, Tuesday I happened to make the acquaintance of <a href="http://mdxi.collapsar.net/pm/dvc00013.jpg">this lovely lass</a> (NSFW and won't be there forever), and I be damned if she hadn't <i>read</i> HTBR in a previous edition! I was completely floored...I know from logs that around 7,000 people have downloaded it, but I've never met any of them (barring the ones I knew before writing it). Awesome feeling, that.<br/><br/>Anyway, after tonight's massive effort in that direction I turned back to mfutils. Fixed a niggling mfn output bug and then started to seriously overhaul mffix and beat it into its new image. Cheers to <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/jstowe/TermReadKey-2.21/ReadKey.pm">Term:ReadKey</a> (SFW), which has made one bit of the new functionality drop-dead easy.</p>

"Linkage?  Clickage.  I wonder what NSFW means..."

Sigh.  I'll know next time...</p>

LOL - yeah, glad I got in way early and there was no one else around.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)

I seriously thought "nsfw" was universal by now.

NBD -- I should UTFA, instead of BCA.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

Just who *was* the "lovely lass" anyway?  Girlfriend?  I miss the picture already.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)

She's a German girl I met through a fairly convoluted chain of events, who was home sick with the flu and brightening her day (and mine) by taking sexy/nekkid pics of herself.
