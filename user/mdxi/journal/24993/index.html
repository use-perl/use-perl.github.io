<div class="span8">
<p><p>Spent all day working on Olive, mostly indirectly. A lot of people 
(myself included) have been irritated by the feed polling timer 
hijacking their session. Desite being on a timer, and therefore not 
affected by anything you're doing, it has a knack for starting up just 
<strong>as</strong> or just <strong>after</strong> you press a key to do something for the first 
time in 15 minutes.</p>

<p>No longer. Today I delved into the guts of Curses::UI and added code 
to (optionally) make it track the time of last keypress and force a 
delay of some seconds afterwards before timer events are allowed to 
proceed. A patch and test script have been sent to the maintainer (but 
I ran the idea by him first, so it shouldn't be a big deal). It's 
already working in my svn repo of Olive, everyone else will have to 
wait a few days for b7 (and the new version of C::UI to hit the 
<span class="caps">CPAN</span>). </p>

<p>This will be my first contribution to an existing project of any 
sort. I've always been working over in a corner on my own stuff. I was 
fairly terrified of trying to modify the guts of C::UI because a few 
years ago when I tried to learn how to use Curses.pm, I failed pretty 
miserably, but today I was able to just <em>look</em> at the code and see 
what was going on. That was a good feeling.</p>

<p>Several other, smaller improvements to Olive today. b7 should be 
good. Sungo and obra (and eric!) want <span class="caps">OPML</span> support, and pointed me at 
usable docs instead of the horrible <em>thing</em> that Dave Winer claims is 
a spec on his website. I'm sorry, but "An <span class="caps">OPML</span> doc consists of some 
<em>stuff</em>, stuffed inside some <em>other</em> stuff, in whatever way you'd 
like", is not a <em>spec</em>.</p>

Olive looks ver nice - I think you might have actually invented a usable RSS reader!  Now I just have to find some feeds that aren't written by wankers<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

None of the &#8220;specs&#8221; associated with Dave Winer in any way ever seem to <em>specify</em> anything. Any chance you&#8217;d actually link to that OPML spec?

No, I mean the useful one.

oh, there is no useful spec. i was pointed at this though: <a href="http://www.dynamicobjects.com/d2r/archives/feedonfeeds.opml.html" title="dynamicobjects.com">http://www.dynamicobjects.com/d2r/archives/feedonfeeds.opml.html</a dynamicobjects.com><br/><br/>which is apparently a good *example* of what a working opml export file will look like.

Ah. Yeah, I just looked at my aggregator&#8217;s OPML output to see what it&#8217;s supposed to look like, in the end. Not surprisingly for such a useless spec, your example and my example look subtly different&#8230; I can throw up my blogroll OPML somewhere if you want to take a look at another example.
