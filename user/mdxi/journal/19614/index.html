<p>The oven has turned out to be great. The digital readout gives you actual oven temperature after you set the target, and it just sort of works nicely all around. The timer feature is nicely thought out as well, chiping every few seconds until you manually clear the timer cycle. I'm impressed (but maybe I just have very low expectations).<br/><br/>The trolley came from Target, got here early, and is very nice, so I went back to Target to begin my huntfor a new dinner table. The existing one is a huge, round 1970s-era monstrosity. Very heavy, physically large, with a very dark finish. The kitchen as a whole is a bit dark, so a big dark useless thing really doesn't help. Luckilly, they have a table made of the same wood as the top of the trolley, with <a href='http://images.amazon.com/images/P/B00006K023.16._SCLZZZZZZZ_.jpg'>nice simple styling</a>. I'll be ordering that ASAP.<br/><br/>The wood in question, btw, is "rubberwood", which I figured was some made-up marketspeak, but it turns out to be what you get when you harvest the trees which produce latex sap that have reached the end of their commercial lifespan -- and thus the end of their lifespan period -- and use them as lumber. How very eco.</p>
