<p><p>Well, it took nearly two months, but barring paperwork-related 
catastrophe, the job I first fired off an inquiry about on May 27 is 
mine. Got the offer this morning at about 1030 and was pretty happy 
about it. Called K and told her; I think "ecstatic" is too mild a word 
for her reaction.</p>

<p>Then, when she comes home for lunch she discovers that one of the 
major roadblocks to her getting financial aid for school has been 
taken care of. This makes her even happier, as she's been getting a 
major runaround for weeks.</p>

<p>A couple of Sundays ago K went to Athens to study and found a house 
for rent right next to where we used to live in family housing. This 
caused us both to start hoping really hard that I'd get the job so we 
could score that house while the summer housing glut was on. This 
evening we were back in the <span class="caps">AHN</span> to deposit her paycheck and scope out 
the house situation, now that fat sacks of cash (moneyhats!) were on 
the horizon. The house she'd notices was off the market, and she wa 
visibly depressed about it, but lo! only two blocks over was a <span class="caps">MUCH</span> 
<span class="caps">BETTER</span> house with a For Rent sign in front of it.</p>

<p>We stopped in the street and called the number on the sign. A nice 
lady answered and was surprised by my inquiry about the house; the 
sign had gone up only a couple of hours earlier. It's frighteningly 
perfect: 3br, 2ba, <span class="caps">LR,</span> usable but unfinished basement, attic 
storage. It's literally a thousand feet from campus in one direction 
and a thousand feet from Five Points in the other (that's the Athens 
Five Points, not either of the Atlanta Five Pointses). The 
neighborhood is beautiful, and the price is probably a little high but 
it's lower than what we were expecting and <span class="caps">WAY</span> lower than what Philly 
would have been (especially as a percentage of salary). I'm going to 
see it at 9AM tomorrow.</p>

<p>The only question is: is this all karmic refunds on the past 2-3 years 
of horror, or is it a layaway against somethiing horrible in the 
future?</p>

<p>Fuck it. Rock and roll, baby \m..m/</p>

3 Bed Rooms, which is any small-ish room, usually square, and usually devoid of any features except a closet<br><br>2 BAths, which is any room with a toilet, sink, and shower/bathtub in it (if there's only a toilet and sink, it goes by the euphemism "half-bath").<br><br>Living Room, which is any large room with no specific purpose. If there's one of these at the front and back of the house, the one in front will be the living room (which will never be used for anything) and the one in back will be the "den" (where people will actually live).<br><br>So, t2? My only guess is "2 tatami", but I don't remember *that* being one of the linguistic bits the Japanese stole from the Portugese<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

A T2 is an appartment with 2 bedrooms. Don't ask me where the T comes from, as I don't know either, nor do any of my cow-orkers O:-)<br><br>Common designations for appartments in Portugal range from T0 to T5, with the number meaning how many bedrooms it has.<br><br>If you're thinking "but where does one sleep, in a T0?" I can tell you that a T0 has only one division, which is a bedroom and a kitchen (basically, it doesn't have a wall separating the two).<br><br>They all have a bathroom.<br><br>You can also find things like a T2+1, or a T1+1. In these cases, the number following the plus sign stands for the number of smaller rooms... I really can't explain it properly, but think of it like "A T2+1 has two bedrooms you can sleep in, plus another one you can also fit a bed into, but you really don't want to do that because it's not very big and doesn't feel like a *real* bedroom, so you'll probably end up using that compartment for something else."<br><br>When you see advertisements, for instance, if the appartment has a living room or anything else, it's usually mentioned in writting. Example: "T3+1 with 2 bathrooms, living room and kitchen."
