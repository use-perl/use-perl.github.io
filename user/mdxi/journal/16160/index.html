<p>I now work at a university bookstore, in the "general books" department. That's the part which is like any other bookstore (not textbooks arranged by class).<br/><br/>I couldn't help but notice that the computer books section was in total disarray. It was, at best, semialphabetized, by title. Horrid. Yesterday I couldn't take it anymore; I asked for and received permission to remake it in my own image.<br/><br/>Now it's organized as follows: Languages; General CS and IT; Networking; Databases and Storage; ORA; Web Techs; GFX and Multimedia; Other (Read: Smegging Office Apps and Books For Total Losers).<br/><br/>My boss thinks it's great. 3 people have already thanked me for finally putting all the O'Reilly books in one place (duh). My co-workers are concerned, however, because the new organization is much easier for someone looking for something but harder for them -- because they don't even really understand some of the categories (their own words).<br/><br/>Selection is also weird. Our Perl section is pathetic, and there's ONE book on C. Meanwhile, there's about 40 on C++ and C# and an entire rack worth of Java. Ugh.<br/><br/>I need to get back to writing (perl and otherwise).<br/><br/>P.S. MS Access is under "Other", not "Databases", and I'm prepared to defend that decision :)</p>
