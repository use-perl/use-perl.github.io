<div class="span8">
<p><p>Started learning Haskell today. So far, it's neat and only minimally 
annoying (stupid types). Knowing Perl and Elisp make it not too 
brain-stretchy. Actually compiling code feels odd...it's been probably 
since my last C++ class in 1999 that I compiled something written by 
myself.</p>

<p>One of the early examples in the tutorial I'm working through (YAHT) 
involves -- surprise -- the Fibonacci series, implemented 
recursively. Out of curiosity I wrote an iterative version in Perl and 
started running them side-by-side. First the code:</p>

<pre>-- 
-- This is Haskell...
--
module Main
    where

import IO

main = do
       hSetBuffering stdin LineBuffering
       putStrLn "Find which Fibonacci number?"
       num <- getLine
       putStrLn ("F[" ++ num ++ "] is " ++ show(fibo(read num)))

fibo 1 = 1
fibo 2 = 1
fibo n = fibo (n - 2) + fibo (n - 1)

#
# ...and this is Perl
#
$num = <>; 
chomp $num; 
$t1 = 1;
$t2 = 1;

for (1..$num) {
    if ($_ == 1 || $_ == 2) {
        $f = 1;
    } else { 
        $f = $t1 + $t2; 
        $t1 = $t2; 
        $t2 = $f;
    }
}
print "F[$num] is $f\n";</pre>

<p>The Haskell code was compiled with no special options using ghc. The 
perl was run under Perl, twice the first time, so that perl(1) would 
be buffered. Things didn't get interesting until around the 30th 
number in the series:</p>

<pre>mdxi@fornax:~$ time ./haskell/fibo_hs
Find which Fibonacci number? 
30
F[30] is 832040

real    0m0.672s
user    0m0.432s
sys     0m0.004s
mdxi@fornax:~$ time perl fibo.pl 
30
F[30] is 832040

real    0m0.240s
user    0m0.002s
sys     0m0.002s</pre>

<p>This is where you can finally start to see a difference between 
recursive and iterative implementations. By 40 the difference was 
staggering:</p>

<pre>mdxi@fornax:~$ time ./haskell/fibo_hs
Find which Fibonacci number? 
40
F[40] is 102334155

real    0m52.804s
user    0m52.541s
sys     0m0.024s
mdxi@fornax:~$ time perl fibo.pl 
40
F[40] is 102334155

real    0m0.256s
user    0m0.002s
sys     0m0.003s</pre>

<p>It took the recursive implementation 1m26s (162% longer) to find 
number 41 and 2m17s (147% longer than 41; 240% longer than 40) to find 
number 42.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the iterative implementation took 0.43 seconds to find the 
100th number and the same amount of time to find the 500th. At this 
point I figured my typing lag was taking most of the time, so I 
rewrote the perl to use command-line arguments (I don't know how to 
handle that in Haskell). With this change, the iterative approach took 
0.005s to find the 1000th number of the sequence, and (0.014, 0.111)s 
to tell me that perl(1) considers the (10,000; 100,000)th numbers 
equivalent to infinity.</p>

<p>What does this tell us? Other than that I am easilly amused, pretty 
much just that: the flip side to <span class="caps">TMTOWTDI</span> is that not every way is the 
right way for the job at hand. But we all knew that already, right?</p>
</p>

I've had pretty much the same experience, which I put down to my lack of experience(!). One of the fun things to work with in Haskell is infinite lists: you can do some amazingly powerful things in a tiny piece of code. The "iterate" function is quite fun in this sort of setting: for example (Haskell newbie code alert...)<br> <br> <code>map head (iterate(\y-&gt;[x| x&lt;-y, (x `mod` head(y)<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/= 0)]) [2..])</code> <br> <br>You'll probably spot the nature of the output pretty quickly (in case it's not clear from the input), which leads to such niceties as<br> <br> <code>primen<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:: Int -&gt; Int<br>primen n = (map head (iterate(\y-&gt;[x| x&lt;-y, (x `mod` head(y)<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/= 0)]) [2..]))!!n</code> <br> <br>The whole things bogs rather severely once you get past about the three-thousandth prime (and the skyrocketing memory's not a lot of fun). Oh well, it was cute while it lasted! The fact that such constructions work as well as they do bog(gle)s my mind in any case...<br> <br>Cheers,<br>Paul<br> <br>
