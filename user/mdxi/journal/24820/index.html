<div class="span8">
<p><p>In one of those weird <em>synchronicity</em> things that happens now and 
again, several friends have recently complained at me that they'd like 
an online journal kind of thing, but don't want to use one of the big 
popular sites. Apparently livejournal's Whiney Emo Fucktard stigma is 
more widespread and mainstream than I thought.</p>

<p>Naturally all this planted the idea firmly in my head: I must help my 
friends by crafting a non-sucky, lightweight journalling platform. So 
that's what I'm doing this weekend, even though I hate web 
programming. Of course it's <em>really</em> simple (unlike the nightmare of 
forms processing that is kdict), so it doesn't hurt too badly so far.</p>

<p>In other news, K has decided that she wants an app similar to the One 
<span class="caps">PIM </span>To Rule Them All that I've been meaning to write for some yeard 
now, only she wants it as a Cocoa app, and while I find Xcode and 
Interface Builder to be completely awesome tools for <span class="caps">GUI</span> app building, 
I don't know ObjC and am fairly put-off by the brief glances I've 
taken at the docs for it. Maybe this Camelbones thing will hurry up 
and get done.</p>

<p>Why not just use MovableType or WordPress or TextPattern or&#8230;? There are also a variety of sites that use the LiveJournal codebase, plus Blogger, and its free hosted service, BlogSpot.</p>

<p>Of course, there&#8217;s good reason to want to roll your own anyway. Just saying that you should at least take a look at the options before you decide to spend more effort on a problem that&#8217;s been solved so many times before.</p>

Believe me, I know but:<br/><br/>1) Some people want some pretty specific things.<br/><br/>2) It'll probably be faster to write it all from scratch than rewrite someone else's<br/><br/>3) Most prefab solutions come with gobs and gobs of crap that none of the people i'm doing this for want or need.

Anti live journal would be "eviljournal", right?
