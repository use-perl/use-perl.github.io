<p>Robert and I went to see Die Hard tonight. Everyone else from the department said they were going too, but no one showed. I called Amy shortly before showtime and she started berating me(!) for letting her forget(!). <br/><br/>I've heard sarcasm, irritation, and petulance in her voice before but never anger or spite. Tonight I heard both, thinly veiled. It didn't help that when I gave up arguing and just apologized, she told me to go enjoy myself in the exact tone of voice I've heard from K so many times. <br/><br/>The "I Don't Want You To Do This And You Know I Don't Want You To Do It But I'm Not Going To Stop You And I Know You're Going To Do It Anyway" tone. <br/><br/>And I started laughing. <br/><br/>And she said, "What's so funny?" and I said, "Sorry, I'm just used to hearing that tone of voice from another woman in my life."<br/><br/>I could tell she was really upset, but I suddenly felt that maybe we were real friends after all, and not just aquaintances from work, because she was genuinely angry at herself for not being there with me (and Robert but who cares about him).<br/><br/>Anyway. If you haven't seen Die Hard since, say, to pick a date at random, September 11 2001, give it a look. There's odd things here and there that are creepy to the max, like the paper raining down after the roof of Nakatomi Plaza is blown.<br/><br/>Also, there's Alan Rickman as a German terrorist. I missed *that* last time around.</p>
