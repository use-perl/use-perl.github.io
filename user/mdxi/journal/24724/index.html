<p><p>Last night my eyes were watering a bit due to allergy type stuff. I 
absently dabbed at the corners with a bit of tissue, and suddenly my 
left eyelid fluttered open and closed, trapping part of the tissue 
against my eyeball.</p>

<p>Once I quit freaking out (just a few seconds, I swear) I went and 
examined the situation in the bathroom mirror, pinning my eye open 
Clockwork Orange style with two fingers. The tissue had become 
saturated with tears and was plastered on the leftmost part of my left 
eye, with the very edge of it just visible on my iris. It was 
disgusting. And painful. And irritating. I tried rinsing it off and 
plucking it off like a contact lens, but it wasn't having it. After a 
while the suck subsided ever so slightly and I went to sleep.</p>

<p>This morning my left eye cracked open and stared out through a haze of 
god knows what. Some rapid blinking cleared things up somewhat, and my 
eye seemed to be bothered a bit less, but there was still clearly a 
lump of tissue crud affixed to it. I figured I'd have to go humiliate 
myself at an opthamologist's office, but within an hour it was 
obviously starting to feel better. Apparently it had pretty much 
broken down and was being slowly flushed out the outside corner of my 
eye as a slow, thick stream of gunk and crust.</p>

<p>By mid-afternoon it was gone. Currently my eyes just feel a bit tired 
and look like I've smoked a couple kilos of marijuana.</p>

<p>Maybe you did, and simply imagined all this.

</p> <p>Anyway, I once asked a friend of mine who had had taken an injection in the eye:

</p> <p>- "How do they prevent you from moving the eye while they're giving you the shot?"

</p> <p>- "They give you an injection."

</p> <p>- "Yes, but how do they make sure you don't move the eye?"

</p> <p>- "They give you an injection."

</p> <p>- "Yes, but what I'm as-"

</p> <p>- "Dude, you don't understand... There's a *<b>needle</b>* in your eye! They don't have to do *anything* else! You are *<b>NOT</b>* - <b>GOING</b> - <b>TO MOVE</b> - <b>THE EYE</b>!"</p>
