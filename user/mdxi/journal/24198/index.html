<p><p>I think I'm in love with Olive. This isn't because I wrote it; in fact 
I was getting really nonplussed with it as the final pieces came 
together. I was really starting to wonder if an <span class="caps">RSS</span> reader was 
something I wanted at all, since I'd never used one before sitting 
down and writing this one. Even as the last bits of code (as it 
happened, the ones responsible for periodic feed polling) went in, I 
was kind distinctly blah: Whee. I've created an alternate way to have 
a big list of websites to look at every day.</p>

<p>Then I marked all the stories as read and walked off. Lo and behold! 
upon my return there was pure, sweet, fresh, new news from several 
sites, sorted by age and ready to read. It was like magic.</p>

<p>On a somewhat different (but very related) note, writing this was 
really important for me. I have sich a tendancy to come up with an 
idea and then just think about it forever, or partially implement it 
before deciding to think/redesign/research it some more. Eventually 
the ideas begin to approach nearly perfectly formed ultraflexable 
supremely generic solutions to an entire class of related problems, 
which renders me completely incapable of executing them.</p>

<p>So I started writing Olive on a whim, but soon I got really obsessive 
about it. I decided I was going to write a curses-based newsreader 
that worked the way I wanted, and that I was going to do it well, do 
it completely, and do it as fast as possible. </p>

<p>"As fast as possible" turned out to be the span of time from just 
after midnight on Sunday until about 1530h Thursday afternoon. That's 
not bad. And it's a little bit rough in places, but I believe it 
definitely also has a good amount of polish and elegance to it. It's 
not a barely-working hack. And it's not quite totally "complete" in 
the sense that I do still have a <span class="caps">TODO</span> list of small improvements and 
corrections, but it undeniably does everything neccessary to be 
classified as "a newsreader". So I am proud, and happy. It feels good.</p>

<p>One last tangent: I was worried about leaking memory. There is an 
absolute ton of stuff being shuttled around inside Olive to make it 
all work. Objects and references flying every which way...this is an 
inescapable fact of writing a Curses::UI app which is broken up into 
modules, all running with warnings and strict on. But to get some of 
the UI effects working the way I wanted, there are actually conditions 
created where widget callbacks trigger each other in loops. I just 
knew I'd not think something out well enough and end up losing a call 
somewhere in the stack. Miraculously, though, memory usage appears to 
stabilize once everything gets worked through (i.e. after all known 
feeds have been run through the <span class="caps">XML</span> parser and db populator once), 
even after hours of runtime and lots of purposeful banging about on 
the widgets with the tricksy callbacks.</p>
