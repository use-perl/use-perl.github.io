<p>As happens so often, I can't stay focused on one project for terribly long. As I get going I either come up with new things which could be applied to other projects, or realize I need to come up with new things for this project (creating dependancies), or start feeling like I'm devoting too much time to one thing, or just plain stop wanting to work on a thing.<br/><br/>Today it was the disorganization demon. That's the one where I start to feel like I will never be able to keep up with everything I need to do and all the random thoughts and data attached to them. I've been cooking up a solution to the problem for quite a while now, including one aborted attempt to tackle it some months ago. Today I decided to take another whack at it. The toolkit of choice: Curses::UI. Interesting stuff, with actual decent documentation (amazing!).<br/><br/>I'm also making an attempt to POD the crap out of everything I do. I can't bring myself to use POD in a C/WEB style though -- it's just too damned ugly and bulky (eats vertical real estate), and I don't like great swaths of green in my buffers (from the syntax highlighting). I shove it all in at the end, basically writing a manpage in POD after all the code, using regular comments within the program itself.<br/><br/>Luckily, the only deadline I have is Dec 3, for the LJ article. I should really get started on that and quit dicking around with my toys. If nothing else, I can work on it this weekend, when I'll be out of reach of my Subversion repository, and stuck in my Mom's house (AKA the Pit of Despair).</p>
