<p><p>We returned to the trail with the old quarry and hiked the full 2 
miles of it. It was a beautiful, sunny, warm spring day. The tail end 
of the trail had a uphill section that was a little too long for 
comfort, but if you're comfortable you're not getting anything out of 
it. I really must return in a day or two with camera.</p>

<p>An article I wrote is up on Groklaw today. Hello, world. Some people 
seem to like it fine, and a few seem to be fixating on the intro PJ 
prepended to what I actually wrote and are busilly taking issue with 
<strong>that</strong>. I don't think I'll be posting any comments in the discussion; 
I'll just watch from over here. It's rather tension-inducing, knowing 
that something you wrote will be read by hundreds of thousands of 
people in the coming days.</p>

<p>One person has already taken exception to my characterization of 
<span class="caps">FORTRAN</span> as a "less well-known" language. Welcome to the twenty-first 
century, my friend -- I know it's there and you know it's there, but 
believe me, not many of the new crop coming up do.</p>
