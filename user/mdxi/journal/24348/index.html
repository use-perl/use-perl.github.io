<p><p>I am enthralled by the AM radio in my inherited Catalina. At night, I 
can drive around and for short periods tune in stations from Tennessee 
and freakin' Kansas City. It's awesome in an odd way.</p>

<p>In related news, I got an invite to <span class="caps">GBS</span>-FM, the Something Awful 
internet radio doohickey. It's pretty great, actually. Nearly 
infinitely broad playlist, which is user selected, and on the weekends 
it's almost 100% actual DJ'd shows. Currently playing: Redbone, "The 
Witch of New Orleans", on Blackhole's Event Horizon show.</p>

<p>Shifting gears, I temporarily gave up on pushing out Olive b4 after 
spending all day yesterday doing nothing but staring at the open 
buffer. Instead, I have started on a long-promised project which is 
proving exceedingly difficult: writing an introductory Linux 
document(s). It's harder than I thought it would be because it turns 
out that some of the people I'm doing this for are so young that 
they've never used a <span class="caps">CLI</span> before, and were having Massive Understanding 
Failures early on. But they're bright, and wanting to do this of their 
own accord, so it'll work out.</p>

<p>Kate is gearing up for Maywrimo. Will I manage to finish last year's 
story idea before this year's Nanowrimo?</p>
