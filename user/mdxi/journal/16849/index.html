<div class="span8">
<p>After a FANTASTICALLY shitty day at work (if I didn't work with an assortment of completely adorable college girls, I'd have lost it by now), came home, had chinese takeaway, watched some wrestling(!), and finally started working on mfutils some more. Haven't touched it in 2 days and promised an entire IRC channel that I'd fellate them if it wasn't ready by monday. I don't want it and neither do they, so there's plenty of motivation all around.<br/><br/>Hoped to get mfarrg working with the new framework, but ended up spending most of my time so far tweaking mfn and its POD. As god is my witness and those are my portieres now, no one will accuse me of having crappy docs.<br/><br/>I guess maybe I should say what I'm actually doing, at least briefly. <br/><br/>mfn is an app which normalizes filenames based on a set of fairly intelligent rules. It's pretty mature at about 1.5 years old (first svn entry is stamped 2003-02-11 23:53:14, but it existed for some time before that), and has been used a lot in that time by myself and friends. It's turned out to be pretty handy.<br/><br/>mffix ("mfutils file fixer", not "meta final fantasy 9") is a little script to rename, delete, or list files (as in a xargs-compatible list, not a 'ls' style list) based on regexes. It's not as mature, or as useful (based on number of people who like it enough to use it) as mfn but *I* like it.<br/><br/>mfarrg is Yet Another Apache Logfile Analyzer, but this one only cares about referrers. Started out life as a script to detect asshats linking to images from remote documents, but has evolved into a general purpose referrer reporting tool. Shows about everything possible for referrers and referrents, including breakouts by static html, search engines, and non-search CGI (web bulletin boards and blogs, mostly). It's popular with my local users -- to my knowledge no one else is using it.<br/><br/>Later on I plan to add in mfegg (I still think egg has potential to be of actual use, but it needs reworking and more features) and mtn, which will be a automated-as-possible ID3 tagger/editor/thinger.<br/><br/>Finally, tomorrow I'm going over to the local tech school. They have this co-op program with the university that gets you a AS in electronics engineering in 6 quarters. The degree is nifty but what I really want is the electrics/electonics knowledge. There are things I wish to build...but more about that later, and probably elsewhere.</p>

Would that be a RPG that your Sims play?
<p>
Or is that a game where you control players playing FF9?</p>
