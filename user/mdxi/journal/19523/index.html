<p>They were right. CUPS *doesn't* suck as bad. In fact, in my first experience with it, CUPS doesn't suck at all.<br/><br/>I looked over linuxprinting's CUPS HOWTO, apt-got what appeared to be the relevant cupsys and foomatic packages, and guessed my way through the webby printer setup doohickey. Nothing happened when I tried to print the test page, however. A look at the logs showed me which process was aborting, but not why, but DID suggest turning logging up to "debug" level if I wanted to know. So I did, and learned that a util the RIP needed wasn't installed. Another minute with apt-get, another click of the "Test Page" button, and *BAMF*! Printing!<br/><br/>pwnage.<br/><br/>went out with robert for dinner. called amy, but she couldn't go (i miss her), and wes was home with her mom (miss her too), so it was a great big sausage party at the mexican joint, which was awfully full of college students considering it's summer. brett is spending the night and was chilling with K while i was in the ATH. looking forward to next weekend, rrowr.<br/><br/>got some work done on egg, after finally finding the right direction to come at it. hope springs eternal.</p>
