<p>First, it is a well-known fact that the world doesn't have enough in-jokey, dork-centric, IRC fueled webcomics, so I have participated in the creation of a new one. Ladies and gentlemen, I give you <a href='http://wang.tildedot.org/'>Wang Labs</a> (yeah, I know the links aren't actually links -- think of it as a testing release).<br/><br/>Second, there also aren't nearly enough sites dedicated to the premise that people should be able to add captions to the metric tons of horrible looking, horribly executed pornographic images available on the internet. To that end, I have created the Most Definitely Not Safe For Work  (Except On Fridays) <a href='http://iadp.collapsar.net/'>IADP</a>, now in its second week of operation.<br/><br/>I hope you enjoy one of both of them.</p>

<h2>Resume</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Ovid/">Ovid</a> on 2004-03-25T00:15:27</h3>
<p>Just wanted you to know that I forwarded your resume, but when I tried to send you an email confirming this, it bounced.</p> <blockquote><div> <tt>&lt;***@*********.net&gt;:<br>69.55.175.18 does not like recipient.<br>Remote host said: 553 sorry, that domain isn't in my list of allowed<br>rcpthosts (#5.7.1)<br>Giving up on 69.55.175.18.</tt> </div></blockquote> <p>Cheers.</p>

I'm guessing you replied to the address the mail came from instead of my normal address, because it turns out that I forgot to add the fqdn of the machine I mailed you from to qmail's rcpthosts file, and that would explain it neatly.<br> <br>If not then I don't know what the problem was off the top of my head...but thanks for your time.
