<p>Casetronic/Travia make a 1U case, the C147, which has 2 power supplies and mounting brackets for 2 mini-itx motherboards. I want one of these badly, but the only place I've successfully found them in the United States is Leadman Electronics.<br/><br/>Sadly, Leadman is a <i>distributor</i> like Ingram Micro. They don't sell to the public, only to people who have set up accounts with them (who then presumably turn around and resell the products, either as-is or integrated into a system). So I called and asked for an account. They seemed happy to give me one, but said they'd need to fax or email over some documents. Here's the documents:<br/><br/>[-- Attachment #2: NEW CUST.doc --]
[-- Type: application/msword, Encoding: base64, Size: 71K --]
[-- Attachment #3: credit.doc --]
[-- Type: application/msword, Encoding: base64, Size: 41K --]
[-- Attachment #4: Bank Release .doc --]
[-- Type: application/msword, Encoding: base64, Size: 33K --]<br/><br/>I guess I need to call them back and explain that I don't want a CREDIT account, I just want an account IN THEIR SYSTEM so I can give them MONEY in exchange for GOODS. Up front. Except I'm sure they'll say something like "our system's not set up to handle that kind of thing".<br/><br/>Which reminds me, does anyone else have a suspicion that the omnipresence and pervasive shittiness of Windows has led to customer service types blaming <i>everything</i> on "The System"? <br/><br/>If someone fucks something up, "it got mixed up somehow in The System". If you request something that might be bothersome, "The System doesn't allow that" or "I don't have access to that part of The System". And of course, the catch-all, "The System is down".<br/><br/>Maybe I'm just cynical and a bit paranoid, but I can't believe that so many companies have such unreliable and poorly thought-out information systems as would be neccessary to make everything I've heard be true.</p>

rjbs: but I think it's not just that win32 sucks<br> <br>rjbs: mdxi: I think that it predates that, and has become a common cultural scapegoat.<br> <br>mdxi: yeah, i meant to add a bit about how most people viewing computers as incomprehensible makes it safe to blame anything on them<br> <br>mdxi: NEVER DID TRUST THEM DANG OLD ELECTIC BRAINS
