<p>Today i just found the most annoying ticket on rt.cpan.org after i filed a new bug yesterday:
http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=26344<br/><br/>If i take this bug as what it is - a bug - can someone fix and close it please?
It's even a critical one and i'm all for closing it as soon as possible!</p>

I feel it's kind of annoying when you are used to report bugs in CPAN modules via rt.cpan.org. But the author is entitled to choose the tools he prefers, so he's right about letting people know that he prefers bug reports via a channel he's more comfortable with.

<p>A good compromise would be if it was possible to redirect automatically the bug queue of <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Test-Reporter" title="cpan.org">Test::Reporter</a cpan.org> into the author's favourite bug tracker, as well as redirecting the e-mails to <tt>bug-Test-Reporter@rt.cpan.org</tt>. But it probably won't happen: rt.cpan.org is far from responsive at my experience.</p>

I would have even filed the bug at google if no extra registration would be required - an automatism  would be very nice indeed.

The extra registration is so that we don't get all the noise from spammers.  Look at the Test::Harness some time for an example.

How is it annoying?  Sounds like the author can ask for whatever he wants if you want to use his software.  No rules that people who release on CPAN must use a given tracker.

My only rule is that i want to file bugs without prior registration.<br>And in the meantime the authors replied already and they are keeping track of RT, too... so my fear was actually for nothing.<br>But my rule/claim still remains the same.

The META.yml spec is picking up keys for authors to refer to resources, like version control, bug reporting etc.<br><br>I imagine that once the toolchain has had a chance to catch up, you'll be able to add a key of some sort to your Makefile.PL and then Test::Reporter and search.cpan.org etc will know where to send people.

Toolchain is already caught up, adding key resources/bugtracker works right now.
