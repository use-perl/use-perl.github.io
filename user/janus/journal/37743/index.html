<p>Short story: i fixed DBD::SQLite's annoying warning, diff at
http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=40383<br/><br/>Long story: today a friend proposed a patch to silence those warnings in
another module and i was finally annoyed enough to investigate.
First i've read the various reports about this, their analysis and
workarounds, then i glanced at the sqlite documentation and found
something promising.<br/><br/>I tried adding a fix in a quick and dirty style until i noticed sqlite
required an update first, as the used function was only available since
sqlite version 3.6.0.<br/><br/>After updating sqlite the fix still didn't work and i saw ``assignment
makes pointer from integer without a cast'' when compiling.
It took a few minutes until i realized that DBD::SQLite picks up the
header files of the bundled sqlite instead of the system-wide installed
one and thus the compiler had no idea about the new function i was using.<br/><br/>The first step to a solution was to zap the local sqlite headers and
then i had it working.
But that was still not very nice as it only helps me but i wanted to get
a result i could push upstream.
So the next logical thing was updating the bundled sqlite before i had a
sufficient patch to send to the DBD::SQLite authors.<br/><br/>A happy end to the story of this bug should be possible with the creation
of a proper ticket on RT.<br/><br/>Now we ``only'' have to wait for a new release of DBD::SQLite.<br/><br/>At least i did more than just moaning :-)</p>

The self-contained <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/DBD-SQLite-Amalgamation/" title="cpan.org">DBD::SQLite::Amalgamation</a cpan.org> (currently at SQLite 3.6.1) is under (more) active development and it might be easier to push your patches into it.

<p>Thanks for the pointer, the same patch applies and i've added a ticket[0] with it.</p><p>[0] <a href="http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=40395" title="cpan.org">http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=40395</a cpan.org></p>

<h2>So just take over DBD::SQLite</h2>

<p>I believe there's already permission from MSERGEANT for it to happen, at least to Matt Trout... I imagine we could get you in on the act.</p>
