<p>So, I'm starting to look at writing and extension that would be much like "top", but without the "rolling display" parts.  This is going to be a much bigger pain than I initially thought.
<P>
My original idea was to wrap the "top" program by William LeFebvre.  Then, I thought I'd just yank out the bits I needed.  The problem is I'm having a hard time deciphering some of his code - it's definitely a bit above my head.  I may just start from scratch, using his code to get me started and give me ideas as I go.
<P>
One funny thing I saw was this bit of code within the boolean.h file:
<P>
#define  No     0<BR>
#define  Yes    1<BR>
#define  Maybe  2<BR></p>

What is the purpose of the module?<br>
You say it won't have the rolling display... Will it have any display?  I think that would be better left to client code / other modules.  Rather, I think this module should simply return a current snapshot.  In fact, I'm wondering why/how this module will be different from <a href="http://theoryx5.uwinnipeg.ca/mod_perl/cpan-search?distinfo=3150" title="uwinnipeg.ca">Proc::ProcessTable</a uwinnipeg.ca>.
The only thing a single <i>top</i> snapshot gives that <i>ps</i> doesn't is sorting.
<p>
OTOH, if this module is really about displaying, then perhaps you should consider using Proc::ProcessTable to do the grungy <i>ps</i> work.</p>

The purpose is to monitor things like load average, process summaries, and overall memory usage - not necessarily the memory usage of individual processes. To the best of my knowledge, <i>Proc::ProcessTable</i> doesn't do that; at least, not without a lot of manual calculations.
<p>
It won't have any display - it's meant for things like remote health monitoring via, say, a distributed server.  I searched CPAN but didn't see anything really designed for that.  If there is something (that works on Solaris), I'd love to know about it - preferably something that's a bit more in depth than parsing "ps | sort".
</p><p>
It needs to be cross platform as well (mainly targeting Linux and Solaris).  That means that I can simply parse text files out of<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/proc on Linux, but have to resort to kstat.h, etc on Solaris.  So, I have little choice but to make it an extension.</p>

I see.  You want the info that is at the top of <i>top</i>'s display, not the itemized-by-process listing.
<p>
What about <i>vmstat</i>?  I'm sure you also know about <i>uptime</i>...
</p><p>
Would it really take a lot of manual calculations to use the info coughed up by Proc::ProcessTable?  I would think a series of adds would do it...</p>

<p>
Exactly.
</p><p>
<i>What about vmstat? I'm sure you also know about uptime.</i>
</p><p>
I've been futzing around with vmstat, trying to figure out how it works internally.  I actually have an <i>uptime</i> interface, but I left load averages out because, well, they really don't have much to do with system uptime, per se.
</p><p>
<i>Would it really take a lot of manual calculations to use the info coughed up by Proc::ProcessTable? I would think a series of adds would do it...</i>
</p><p>
See my latest entry - my new conundrum is whether or not <i>top</i> is returning correct values (or rather, why it returns the values that it does), because adding up the values results in different values than what <i>top</i> reports.</p>
