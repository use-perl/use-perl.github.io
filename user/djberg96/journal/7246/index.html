<p>I think I've finished porting the first of the <I>Spreadsheet::WriteExcel</I> modules, called <I>OLEWriter</I>.
<P>
I say<I> I think</I>, because I'm not sure how to test it.  At first I thought I could just steal John's own tests and slap them into Ruby's <I>Test::Unit</I> module or something.
<P>
But then I realized....there *aren't any tests*!  I'm not upset or anything (that would make me a blithering hypocrite, if nothing else), but I *am* surprised.
<P>
I'm surprised because it seems like for a module of this complexity there would be a lot of room for little errors, especially with all of the specific hex values you have to use.  There must have been quite a bit of trial and error, then.</p>

<h2>Spreadsheet::WriteExcel test</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jmcnamara/">jmcnamara</a> on 2002-08-23T08:43:22</h3>
In the CPAN distribution of Spreadsheet::WriteExcel there is only has one real test and that is to determine if the hardware supports a 64 bit IEEE float.<br> <br>The reason that there aren't more tests is that there isn't any way to test the module apart from creating a file, opening it in Excel, checking if the required features are okay and then closing it again. This isn't something that can be automated on a cross-platform basis.<br> <br>It would be possible to generate an Excel file, MD5 the results and check it against a known value. However, this would be artificial.<br> <br>This is not to say that the module hasn't been tested. I spent over 3 months on the development and testing of OLEwriter.pm alone. This involved creating binary files of various N, N-1, N+1 sizes, storing them with OLEwriter and then reading them with 3 versions of Excel on Windows, MS Works on Windows and OpenOffice, Gnumeric and Xess on Linux.<br> <br>For each feature that is added to Spreadsheet::WriteExcel I have to go through a similar process. This, and the documentation, is what makes progress so slow. But again, it would be difficult to include these type of tests in the CPAN distribution.<br> <br>In a way the 40+ example files are the tests. They serve as unit tests and as regression tests. And Excel is the arbiter of whether the module works or not.<br> <br>The best way to test your ported version is to compare the binary output with the output of Spreadsheet::WriteExcel and ensure that there is byte-for-byte equivalence. In that way you will inherit my bugs but also my testing.<nobr> <wbr></nobr><tt>:-)</tt> <br> <br>John.<br>-- <br> <br>

Heh - caught me.
<p>
I guess what I expected to see were tests where you write particular strings and numbers to a cell or group of cells, then check to see if the values written to the file are what you expect (like an "od" check or something).  I realize that this is somewhat artificial, but it would at least let you know if you had made any *obvious* errors.
</p><p>
I realize the acid test is to just open the file in Excel and see if it worked.  I was just hoping there would be some intermediate testing I could do.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

I will tell you something that is true:  that sounds like a dare.  (I do have plenty of tasks already.)
