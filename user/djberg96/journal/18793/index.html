<p>For reasons that I cannot determine, the insert triggers no longer work.  Oh, they compile fine, they LOOK like they should work but they just....don't.  I get errors along the lines of, "attempting to insert a null value...", even though that's what the triggers are supposed to handle.
<P>
If I have to manually call sequence.nextval and insert it on my own, there's not much point to having the triggers.  Besides, it'll improve performance.</p>

<p>I may be asking the obvious, but have you dropped and then recompiled ? On some heavily used/replicated/just plain weird databases, I've found that Oracle will assure you that the triggers/stored procedures/packages have compiled correctly when they haven't. I am sure there is a scientific reason for all this, but my cargo-cult means of dealing with it is embedding a couple of unmissable logging statements (in an autonomous transaction) and if that doesn't register on the log, just drop/recompile. In general, autonomous transactions are your friend in places like this..it can give you the "before" and "after" states without compromising the transaction.
</p><p>Perhaps sequence.nextval is the better choice for you. I am personally not comfortable with insert triggers myself (performance, mutation and tuning issues), but I haven't failed to get it to work yet.. Had difficulty, yes.. failed: no.</p>

<p>
Yep, tried that first, but it still didn't seem to work, so I gave up.  I just don't have time to futz with it.  I think it's been a good work experience, though - avoid insert triggers.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>
