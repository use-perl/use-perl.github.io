<div class="span8">
<p>Last year I installed FreeBSD 4.9 on my laptop as part of a dual-boot setup (with Windows XP Home on the other half).  Here are some thoughts, keeping in mind that I haven't played with it too heavily:
<P>
<B>The Good</B>
<UL>
<LI>Fast - I've run various I/O benchmarks of my own on Solaris, FreeBSD, Linux, HP-UX and Windows.  FreeBSD always seems to get the best performance, and the filesystem just *feels* fast in general.
<LI>Secure - more so than Windows and even Linux (based on <a href="http://securityfocus.com/">Security Focus</a> and user comments in general)
</UL>
<B>The Bad</B>
<UL>
<LI>Installation - Ugh.  If a FreeBSD expert hadn't been sitting *right next to me* the whole time, I never would have gotten this thing installed.
<LI>Unable to write to NTFS - Yep, it's read only.  Pain in the arse.
<LI>Despite RTFM, I can't get my (definitely supported) wireless card to work.
</UL>
<B>The Strange</B>
<UL>
<LI>Ports - Feels like a weird halfway point between building from source and, say, Solaris packages.  There do appear to be packages, too, and I've used those when I can.  Maybe I just need to get used to it.
</UL></p>

<h2>Installation bad?</h2>

I'm surprised you found the installation so bad.  It's not graphical or anything, but frankly, I found it to be very simple and straightforward (you want a bad installer try NetBSD!).  Did you do a standard install or jump to expert?  Not that I'm a freebsd guru or anything, but standard installs have always worked well for me.<br> <br>Keep playing with the ports system.  I was a skeptic at first, and they are a strong reason that I stay with FreeBSD now.  They make life SO easy for me.<br> <br>Good luck!<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br>

<p>
To tell you the truth, I don't remember.  All I remember is a lot of manual tweaking, and the FreeBSD expert going "hmmm..." a lot.  It took a long time to get it going (a couple hours iirc).</p>

What sucks about the NetBSD installer?<br>I've run into the occasional bug, but they were usually<br>just polish issues.<br>

<h2>I &amp;lt;heart&amp;gt; ports</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/kag/">kag</a> on 2004-06-29T22:50:22</h3>
Maybe it's just the way my brain works, but I like the ports system much more than Debian's apt and friends (never could find an intuitive way to navigate) or Redhat's rats-nest of RPMs.  I'm especially fond of having pkg-descr and pkg-plist as text files sitting on my file system.<br> <br>There are drawbacks, of course.  Every few months there's a new case of "you must upgrade these ports in exactly the right order, or everything goes boom."  Gnome, mostly.  And I was less fond of ports a few CPU generations back.  (Rebuild X on a 300Mhz machine: pain.  Rebuild X on a dual 2.8Ghz machine: over before you notice.)<br>

One thing I love about pkgsrc is control over configure<br>args.<br>
