<p>I guess Aw-node (that's "Arnold" if you remove the German accent) is going to run for Governor of California.  Heh.

<B>Arnold:</B> To crush Gray Davis, see him driven before me, and to hear the lamentations of the Democrats.</p>

<h2>Arnold has no german accent...</h2>

... that is an austrian accent. And a fake one for that.<br>
<br>
He spoke perfect (accent-free) english, yet had to relearn the fake accent because it became one of his trademarks.<br>
<br>
Btw. I met a few austrians at the TPC in Portland and we talked about Arnold... and how neither the germans nor the austrians understand him when he uses the fake accent.<br>
<br>
&lt;evil joke&gt;Co-worker: It would be so cool if we would have an austrian governor!<br>
Me: That's what the germans thought, too!&lt;/evil joke&gt;.<br>

Well, I wasn't sure if I should say "Austrian" or "German", because the language of Austria is, well, German.  I wasn't aware that he was faking his accent, though.  Interesting.

I've never heard that he fakes it and I don't believe that he does.

The more I thought about it, the more unlikely it seemed that he would fake his accent.  I'd say his accent has lessened slightly since the first Conan movie, though.
<p>
That reminds me.  There's a FOX morning show called "Fox and Friends".  I was watching and they *thought* they had Arnold on the phone.  Afterwards Edie, one of the hosts, thought something wasn't quite right.  It turned out that the producers got over-excited and hadn't done the usual callback to verify the caller.  Even Arriana Huffington, who happened to be on standby but heard the call, thought it was fake.

One of the other hosts piped up, "I think we just got Punk'd!".  Too funny.</p>
