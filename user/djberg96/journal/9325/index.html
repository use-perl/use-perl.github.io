<p>I've just now realized that if you save an MS PowerPoint presentation in html format, it will only be readable by IE.  Or, I should say, I can't read it with Mozilla.
<P>
So, what are my options now?  I'm hoping someone out there has a conversion program or something.  Anyone?</p>


<hr/>



<h2>Try OpenOffice.org</h2>

Try opening the presentation with the OpenOffice.org presentation component and save as HTML there.  I have no idea if this will work, but it's worth a try.

That worked!  I never used OpenOffice before.  I think I'm a convert.
<p>
Thanks!</p>

<h2>PowerPoint Versions</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ziggy/">ziggy</a> on 2002-12-07T18:46:51</h3>
What version of PowerPoint?  What options do you have set in Mozilla?
<p>
I've created HTML versions of PowerPoint presentations before, up to PP2000 I believe.  They change the HTML output every so often; the original conversion (PP95?  PP97?) rendered a set of JPEGs with just enough HTML to link the images together.  A newer version of PowerPoint used the same kind of CSS hackery that Word uses to generate more native HTML in a frameset to mimic the outline/slide/notes view.
</p><p>
I wouldn't be surprised if PP XP hacked the HTML output further, but I hesitate to believe that Microsoft made it viewable only with IE.  PP XP was developed during the monopoly suit, released after the findings of fact and way before the slap-on-the-wrist ruling.  I doubt they would have been that brazen given the circumstances.</p>

PP 2000.  While porting to OpenOffice and back worked, it's not as nice looking.  If there's an option I can set within Mozilla that'll let me view the original HTML, please let me know!  I messed around in preferences, but didn't see anything that stood out.  However, IANAME (I Am Not A Mozilla Expert).

Ctrl+U shows source in Mozilla for X-Windows.  Probably the same key combination in Windows.

Oops.  I meant, "view the html originally created by PowerPoint within the browser, correctly", not "view the source".  Sorry for the confusion.

<h2>HTML cleanup tools</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/bart/">bart</a> on 2002-12-08T21:44:25</h3>
Well, you appear to have found a solution in case where you do have the original Office file. But in cases where you don't:
<p>There are some HTML cleanup tools floating around. Some of them are specifically intended to clean up the "HTML" as produced by MS-Word, or at least are reported to work well for these; but it might work well with the output of any MS-Office program.

</ul>



<h2>Try PDF</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Odud/">Odud</a> on 2002-12-09T11:50:31</h3>
If you have access to Acrobat you could try converting it to PDF. The output looks fine and should be viewable by most people.
