<p>According to the "BrainBench" (www.brainbench.com), I'm the #1 Perl Programmer in Minnesota.  Bwa, ha, ha!!!! Wealth! Power! Women!

Oh, alright.  It's a lame-o test that our company wanted us to take.  I mean, there were *three* questions that involved "here" documents for crying out loud.
<P>
Anyway, my score was 4.71 (out of 5) for anyone who wants to take the "challenge".</p>

Nor have I, though I would hardly expect to top someone who uses Perl for a living. Besides, it's too nice outside to take a test like this right now.

For a while brainbench considered me to be the best perl programmer in the UK, which is of course arrant nonsense. I did it for a laugh back when it was free. <br> <br>Occasionally I'd wind pimps (recruitment conslutants) up by giving them the url...



<h2>Brainbench, oh yes...</h2>

...where else can you pay $50 out of your own pocket for a "qualification" that is completely meaningless<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

C'mon folks.  I didn't pay for this.  My company made some kinda deal.  It's free to us employees.
<p>
Gimme a little credit.  Jeeesh!</p>

<i>Gimme a little credit. Jeeesh!</i> <br> <br>Sorry mate, I didn't mean any offense.  I was poking fun at Brainbench not at you.  I gathered from your post that your company paid for it.

I dimly remember consulting for Brainbench on some of their tests, possibly including an edition of the one you took.
<p>The whole process is a mess that <em>ideally</em> produces no test that's embarassingly inaccurate, but at the cost of almost never producing a really good test.  But I had no particularly better process to suggest, so I refrained from unhelpfully saying "if you write a Perl test to this outline, it probably won't be bad, but it will never be good."</p>
