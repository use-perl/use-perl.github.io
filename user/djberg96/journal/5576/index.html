<p>Note to $self:  either include a complete test script or don't include one at all.
<P>
I see that my latest release of <I>Net::SCP::Expect</I> is failing tests left and right, including Solaris.  That's interesting, since it's Solaris that it was developed on.
<P>
I can only guess this is because my test script isn't really complete.  I wanted to get this version out the door, though, because of that major bug that Ruban Phukan found (and jdavidb fixed).
<P>
Anyway, ignore the cpan test results until you see an actual bug report.</p>

<h2>Works for me</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jdavidb/">jdavidb</a> on 2002-06-11T18:15:23</h3>
<p>I upgraded Net::SCP::Expect today and it passed all tests and seemed to copy large files fine.  However, I just checked and realized CPAN.pm didn't install it because it failed the tests.  I didn't notice because I upgraded a bunch of modules at once and didn't watch while they built.</p>

<p>Looks like the test is looking for something called Term::ReadPassword.  You could add that into the PREREQ_PM of the Makefile.PL and it would show up automatically (for me, at least).<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)  Of course, since it's only a prereq for the tests, you might not want to do that.  (I'd vote yes so CPAN.pm can handle it.  Besides, people can always use a few extra modules; it helps us learn about new things on CPAN we never knew about.)</p>

<p>Time passes...</p>

<p>Never heard of Term::ReadPassword before, but I've needed such functionality in a module in the past, and it sounds like a good idea.  Skipped the tests since I didn't want to involve any of the other machines here.  The module seems to work fine on my really big file, so I'd say it passes.</p>

<p>Thanks for putting me in the credits.  It's nice to think I was able to help someone (and help expand Expect.pm's user base.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) )</p>

<p>
Oh, drat, I should have put a warning about that in the Makefile.PL file.  Next release.  Thanks for the report.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>
