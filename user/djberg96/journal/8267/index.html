<p>I'm settled in here in Lakewood, Colorado.  The drive was easy, and the move went smoothly.  I have a pretty good view of the mountains from my new apartment.
<P>
I've actually been back at work for 3 days, but I still don't have access to the local network - I'm logged in remotely to a machine in Minnesota right now.  Hopefully, I won't get booted like I did yesterday.
<P>
I've met a couple of my neighbors so far.  Ken and Tom have lived in their first floor apartment for 17 years!  Ken must have had an interesting life.  He was married for 17 years prior to his current relationship.  He's definitely the nosy neighbor.
<P>
I've also met the cute Californian woman next door by the name of Melanie.  She's too young and has too many boyfriends for my taste, however.  In fact, the nosy neighbor seems to think that more than one of them stay over at her apartment at the same time and I'm somewhat inclined to agree, though I have no proof.  I guess they're even more liberal in California than I thought.  It gives special meaning to the "Welcome" mat in front of her door. ;)
<P>
Still no long distance service or internet at home yet - totally lame.  I got a message from Airborne Express yesterday saying that they didn't have my complete address and couldn't deliver - I'm guessing that's my DSL modem on hold.  My old calling card no longer works either so my only option at the moment is the workphone.  Maybe I should use 10-10-220.
<P>
Work is an easy 10-15 minute drive.  It only takes about 20-25 minutes to bike there because it's mostly downhill.  However, this also means that it takes about 45 minutes to get *back*.  The weather is good for it right now, so I'm going to make a point to bike here twice a week as long as the weather holds out.</p>
