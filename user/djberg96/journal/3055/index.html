<p>Don't you hate it when you write some program you think is really clever and then realize it's probably been done better, faster and cleaner already?  And it's on CPAN?
<P>
Such is the case with the PlRPC bundle.  Now, I'm not *totally* sure it can do what my program can do, but I suspect it can.  Mainly I'm not sure if the server will get confused by dependencies of the module (constructor) being called by the client.  I don't think so, but we only learn by doing.
<P>
Even if it *can* do what I want, at worst I re-invented the wheel a bit and added a bit more maintenance but nothing serious.  Ah, well.  I didn't really know what RPC even *was* when I started the thing.  It was still a great learning experience and if nothing else I'll have a better understanding of what's going on behind the scenes with PlRPC than I would have before.
<P>
Interestingly, the FAQ server spit this out about a month ago:
<P>
<I>
A DCE::RPC module is being developed (but is not yet available) and will
    be released as part of the DCE-Perl package (available from CPAN). The
    rpcgen suite, available from CPAN/authors/id/JAKE/, is an RPC stub
    generator and includes an RPC::ONC module.
</I>
<P>
So, should is there a problem with PlRPC?  Should I wait before mucking with it?
