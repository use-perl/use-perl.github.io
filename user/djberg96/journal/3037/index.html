<p>I can't seem to get to the download site.  There must be too much traffic.

I really wish that BeOS had made it.  Friggin' JLG - yeah, there's a great CEO for ya.  A lesson in what *not* to do when running a company.  I read once that they were losing $10 million per month.  How do you lose $10 million per month when you have *one* product with *no* manufacturing costs (excluding packaging)?  Total incompetence (or corruption), that's how.
<P>
Anyway, maybe I'll install OpenBeos (instead of BeOS) on my new 40 gb drive once I put it in my machine.  Perl never did work quite right on it, though.  Sockets didn't work, eval didn't work right, and Errno didn't work right either.
<P>
I used to work with a guy call "Mak" on a project called "Orchid" (the successor to "Orchard"), which was a SWIG interface to the BeOS API for Perl (and eventually Python and Ruby).  It had some serious design flaws IMO (which would have been glaringly obvious if Mak had been using 'strict' to begin with - I couldn't get him to use it, though), but it was still pretty cool.  I gave up on it though when the "focus shift" happened.</p>
