<p>Not long after reading Ranguard's journal about how good it is to get a nice email regarding a module he wrote, I got a nice one for my spreadsheet port.  It gave me a nice, warm, fuzzy feeling. :)
<P>
I read in someone else's journal (can't find it now) where they said, "when it doubt, return <B>self</B>".  I think it's time to advertise Want.pm again.  When in doubt, use Want.pm:
<ECODE>
use Want;
if(want("OBJECT")){
   return $self;
}
else{
   return $whatever;
}
</ECODE>
Speaking of Want.pm, has anyone heard from Robin Houston (robin) lately?  He hasn't posted here in a very, very long time.
<P>
Back to the spreadsheet port.  I got an email from someone saying that had started work on porting both <I>Spreadsheet::WriteExcel</I> and <I>Spreadsheet::ParseExcel</I>.  He needs formulas.  I suggested adding him to my sourceforge project, but I think he's determined to port the latest versions of each from the get-go.  I'll try to convince him otherwise, but we'll see.  I sort of get this vibe that he doesn't want to use my code but wants to do it *his way*.  That's all fine and good, but it seems like a waste of effort.  We'll see if I can convince him to join my project as a developer or not.</p>
