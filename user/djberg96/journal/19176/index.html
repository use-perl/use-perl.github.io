<p>Every once in a while a reasonably intelligent person does something totally stupid.  Tonight, it was my turn.
<P>
Using my rental car, I drove off to go to the gym.  When I got back, I realized that I had forgotten my house key, because those were attached to my regular set of car keys.  Rather than call for a locksmith I decided that, with a little help from my neighbor, I would scale the rock siding up to my balcony and go in through the patio door which I was fairly certain was open.
<P>
STUPID FUCKING MOVE, DAN!
<P>
I got up about 2/3 of the way when (you guessed it), I fell fairly hard, scraping an air conditioner on the way down and landing on my side, while managing to jam my right thumb slightly on the way down.  I now have a nice big scrape on my left hip.  Drew some blood, too.  Ugh.
<P>
My neighbor was nice enough to nurse me a little while I called the locksmith, who took forever to get here.  Finally, at 12:30am, I got back into my condo, now $65 poorer.
<P>
The patio door was locked.</p>

<h2>No keys...</h2>

This is why we always hide a key outside the house, and we also have a few friends that have keys to our place. (We watch each others houses when we go on vacation, etc...)<br>
(If someone were to comb the backyard thoroughly enough, they might find the key, but then they have to deal with the dogs when they get inside.)

Yes, this debacle has inspired me to give a spare set of keys to the neighbor.  Living in a condo, I don't really have a place to hide a spare key.

Use <a href="http://www.sportys.com/acb/showdetl.cfm?&amp;St2=40721270&amp;St3=-65870856&amp;DS_ID=6&amp;Product_ID=959&amp;DID=22" title="sportys.com">this</a sportys.com> instead.<br> <br>I had one for my condo, and every house (3) after that. It works great and is built like a tank (in case someone actually succedes in removing it from the wall).<br> <br>You can pick your own combo, and it is easy to set.<br> <br>I like to go out for walks &amp; runs without having to worry about keys. This works great. Also nice if someone drops by or needs access to your house... just give them the combo. Change as desired. (think girlfriend<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-))<br> <br>Simply can't say enough about the thing.
