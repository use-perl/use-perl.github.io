<p>I watched two new shows tonight: <I>Firefly</I> and <I>John Doe</I>.  Firefly was ok, but nothing special.  I give it 3 seasons, max, before the novelty wears off.
<P>
I thought John Doe was excellent.  It's a rip off to some degree of <I>The Pretender</I>, but the difference is that the main character has a personality.  The actor playing the main character did a good job, especially when it came to displaying nervous energy.  We'll see how it does.</p>

<h2>Me too</h2>

<p>I watched these two, which is fairly rare for me. I watch tv but usually not new stuff because I can't remember when it is, etc.

</p><p>I was fairly impressed with them both. In particular the chemistry between the characters in Firefly was fairly relaxed, much more than I would have expected for a first show. Normally this takes a whole season to get going, which is why it's a shame that promising shows are canned so early these days. (Compare the first 10 episodes of Seinfeld with the fourth or fifth 10.)

</p><p>I had more annoyances with John Doe -- the voiceover monologues were a little repetitive and they belabored a few points too long -- but I did like how they just plopped you in the middle of a situation with no background rather than the normal TV practice of trying to explain the flavor out of everything.

</p><p>We'll see how they progress...</p>
