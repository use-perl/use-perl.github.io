<p>I learned about a new code-flood website today.  Maybe this is common knowledge, but I didn't know about it until today.  If you want folks to look at your code, but don't want to flood your IRC channel, consider the <a href="http://codedbliss.com/clipboard/">codebliss paste site</a>.  Even comes with syntax highlighting.</p>

Syntax colouring requires some knowledge of syntax, but Codebliss doesn't seem to have that. For example, in "s/&#180;/'/", it renders "180;/'/" as a comment. Its engine tries to render ""-delimited strings, but seems to be completely unaware of Perl's other quoting features.<br> <br>It's okay to try and fail, but does Codebliss try? I think it has *keyword colouring*, not *syntax colouring*.<br> <br>Some dictionary lookup tool (vandale.pl) looks like this in Codebliss:<br> <br>http://codedbliss.com/clipboard/copy/perl/1<br> <br>While with the use of Syntax::Highligh::Perl, Scribble (another paste service) renders it as:<br> <br>http://tnx.nl/scribble/788XRTR<br> <br>It clearly shows which parts are strings (or syntactically stringish things like regexes) and which are not.<br> <br>Besides that, its URLs are shorter (which is nice on IRC, imho) and hard to predict (the number is sequential, but the letters are random).

 "s/&#194;&#180;/'/" should have been "s/&amp;#180;/'/".<br>

It's highlighting strings as well, so it's not just keywords.  But, yeah, that's a bug.
<p>
Folks who know more than I do say the owner is using GNU's source highlighter which has problems with regex highlighting.  I'll send an email.

BTW, scribble looks nice, but it only does HTML and Perl.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:(</p>

Most "syntax" colourers simply recognize some keywords and colour simple strings, like this Codebliss thing. I'd rather have no syntax colouring at all.<br> <br>S::H::P has some bugs as of course only perl can parse Perl, but it's great for most code.

Have you tried Perl::Tidy?
