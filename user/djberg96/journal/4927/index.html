<p>Today was a nice day in Minneapolis, so I decided to take out the bike.  A co-worker of mine and I have been talking about biking to work every once and a while.  Tonight I decided to give it a test run to learn the path and see how I handled it.
<P>
My drive to work is about 11 miles, but by staying on bike-friendly roads & trails another 2 miles or so was added.  So, about 13 miles there and back.
<P>
It was harsh.  First, I made the mistake of making this trek without having eaten a real dinner.  I also couldn't find my usual water bottle so I settled for a .5 liter.  Second, I need a gel seat, because the one I've got was killing me by the time I got home.  The whole trip was about 2:45 btw.
<P>
By the time I got home I was tired, thirsty, a little dizzy and I'll probably have a sore butt through tomorrow.
<P>
Nah - I don't think I'll be doing the bike to work thing again.  There's also the nastier traffic, plus a few unsavory blocks where I don't exactly feel safe.</p>
