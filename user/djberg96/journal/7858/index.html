<p>It's Friday Trivia Time.  It's time to go back to Star Trek.  Well, sort of.
<P>
For 50 Trivia Points, what late 80's one-hit-wonder released a song that started with this line: <I>It's worked so far, but we're not out yet</I>
<P>
No google.  Good luck!
<P>
More info: I'm looking for the band name, not the song.  And in case you didn't get the clue from my entry or read jjohn's clue, that quote is from the original Star Trek series.
<P>
<B>Update: </B>Herkemer got it.  50 Trivia Points for Herkemer!</p>

<h2>I peaked</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jjohn/">jjohn</a> on 2002-09-20T14:02:46</h3>
This hint may help people: The song features many ST:OS samples. If you don't remember the lyrics, I certainly can't blame you. There was a song feature on the Dr. Demento show called "Star Trekking," which also feature ST:OS samples, but that's not the song in question. This one was a <b>real</b> top 40 hit.
<p> <a href="http://www.billboard.com/" title="billboard.com">Billboard</a billboard.com> apparently doesn't have data past 1992, much later than the time when the song in question came out. However, if you want to feel old, here are some of the albums that charted then:

</p><ul>
   <li> <b>1.</b> <em>Some Gave All</em>, Billy Ray Cyrus</li>
   <li> <b>2.</b> <em>Unplugged</em>, Eric Clapton</li>
   <li> <b>3.</b> <em>Ten</em>, Pearl Jam</li>
   <li> <b>8.</b> <em>Totally Krossed Out</em>, Kris Kross</li>
   <li> <b>9.</b> <em>Funky Divas</em>, En Vogue</li>
   <li> <b>16.</b> <em>Blood, Sugar, Sex Magik</em>, Red Hot Chill Peppers</li>
   <li> <b>15.</b> <em>Adrenalize</em>, Def Leppard</li>
   <li> <b>17.</b> <em>Metallica</em>, Metallica</li>
   <li> <b>22.</b> <em>Countdown to Extinction</em>, Megadeth (aptly named too)</li>
   <li> <b>25.</b> <em>Use Your Illusion</em>, Guns N Roses</li>
   <li> <b>31.</b> <em>Amused to Death</em>, Roger Waters</li>
   <li> <b>35.</b> <em>Pocket Full of Kryptonite</em>, Spin Doctors</li>
   <li> <b>41.</b> <em>Nevermind</em>, Nirvana</li>
</ul>

"Pure Energy" is the song, I'm not sure about the band...

I recall the song, and the lyric was familiar, but I couldn't put them together.  I loved the song, but didn't realize it had ST samples.  Maybe that is why I liked the song in the first place?<br> <br>Pudge Trivia: I found a cassette single of the song on the side of the road while riding my bike, back in high school.
