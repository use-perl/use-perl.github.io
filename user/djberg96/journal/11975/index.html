<p>Here I am again, swearing at my Solaris box because of yet another obscure ld error.  This time it relates to the FOX gui library, FXRuby, FXScintilla and FreeRIDE.
<P>
In some ways, however, I'm inclined to blame OSS developers, who are clearly targeting Linux (and thus relying on GNU's ld) and leaving other *nix users to deal with obscure problems (like mine) on their own.  Then again, maybe Sun's ld is just crappy.
<P>
Another problem, though, is that about 90% of configure scripts seem to utterly ignore the '--with-gnu-ld' option for some reason, and /usr/ccs/bin/ld gets used anyway.  Often I have to do this 3 step process:
<P>
cd /usr/ccs/bin<BR>
mv ld ld.orig<BR>
ln -s /usr/local/bin/ld ld
<P>
Then I have to remember to put everything back when I'm done.
<P>
GAH!</p>

Things like this really make you wish that you could have a filesystem based local(), so that you could run a command and at the end, everything would just be put back as it was...

It's nothing new.  When I started out on Linux ('93), all the free software assumed that you were running SunOS 4, pretty much.  Before that, it was vaxen.  Unfortunately, portability is a difficult thing to do right.

Yeah, it is not intentional.  It is an accident of circumstance.  Most developers -- myself included -- don't have the knowledge, experience, time, etc. to make sure it works on every platform.  That is what users and patch are for.
