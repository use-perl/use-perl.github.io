<p>I decided to order a bunch o' books today.  They are:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Writing Apache Modules With Perl and C (ORA)
<LI>Professional Apache (Wrox)
<LI>Programming Web Services with XML-RPC (ORA)
<LI>Apache Pocket Reference (ORA)
</UL>
<P>
A while ago while tinkering with Apache, I didn't much like the ORA book on Apache, so that's why I went with the Wrox book, which looked good.
<P>
Most of these purchases are to help me dive headlong into mod_perl. :)</p>

<h2>Thanks!</h2>

<p>I hope you like the XML-RPC book. I'd appreciate any feedback you have on it. Send your mail to jjohn@cs.umb.edu.</p>

That's you?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-O
<p>
It should be interesting.  In addition to getting a better grip on web services, I also plan on shamelessly plagiarizing whatever parts I need for a revamped version of Penguin.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

I've liked what I've read so far. I've only read 2 or 3 chapters but I think I have the feel for XML-RPC.<br> <br>Of course I'm trying to read about a dozen technical books at the moment. I've also been trying to inhale as much RPC/SOAP/Web Services info as possible. I'm even rolling through the "Programming Jabber" book.<br> <br>So far all have been great and the XML-RPC book was a great start for O'Reilly in that arena.

<h2>mod_perl stuff</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/geoff/">geoff</a> on 2002-03-15T20:10:52</h3>
depending on where you hang out, you may either be tired of hearing about it or entirely unaware, but there's another book on the mod_perl front that might be able to help you get on your way: <a href="http://www.modperlcookbook.org/" title="modperlcookbook.org">http://www.modperlcookbook.org/</a modperlcookbook.org>.  people have been telling us it complements the Eagle book nicely, which was the idea.

Oh, hey - thanks!  I'd heard of it but forgot about it.  I'll probably order it, too.

I've had the Eagle for awhile now but only recently started doing some serious mod_perl work.<br> <br>It took me some time to get into the groove on its layout but I'm starting to like it.<br> <br>As for the mod_perl cook book (recently purchased) I've only read a few chapters and skimmed the rest. So far I would say that it lives up to the billing of being a complement to the Eagle.

I too found the Eagle book unaccessable until I *had* to do mod_perl stuff and THEN the book made a whole lot more sense. The problem, I think, is that mod_perl is really just perl hooks into Apache. This means that mod_perl is just another way of programming Apache, so you need to understand Apache before using mod_perl to its fullest. That's the part that I got hung up on anyway.

That's the reason I ordered an Apache book at the same time, as I pretty much knew that going in.  The thought of learning Apache doesn't thrill me; it's usually something that I'd rather leave to sys-admins (and often *must* be left to the sys-admins).
<p>
At the end of the day, though, it's a good skill to have, especially in lieu of the fact that so many prospective employers want to see mod_perl experience on a resume'.</p>
