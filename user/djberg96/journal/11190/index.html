<p>I watched SciFi's rendition of <I>Riverworld</I> last night.  I kinda liked it, but then I never read the books.  I thought it was going to be a miniseries, but apparently it was a pilot for a regular series.
<P>
The reviews of it from people who have read the books regularly put it into the "sucked" or "awful" category.  At the very least, it has inspired me to go out and by the first book, which I imagine will be quite a bit better.</p>

Riverworld was one of the first series of books that seriously disappointed me. I loved the first two, liked the third, but midway into the 4th got a nagging feeling that Farmer wasn't going to pull it off. He didn't.

&lt;aol&gt;I second that completely&lt;/aol. The last books completely destroy to good plot premises of the first ones (notably with that invention of articial souls.)<p>There's another book of P.J.Farmer that uses artificial souls, but that isn't part of the riverworld series -- it takes place in a kind of hell. I don't know the english title and I don't remember the french one.</p>
