<p>I learned a new word this evening: pommie.
<P>
Can someone over in GB tell me if this is a naughty word or not?  I won't say who taught me this word, but I'll tell you it was a Kiwi. :)
<P>
And no, it wasn't gnat.</p>

<h2>Naughty?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Odud/">Odud</a> on 2003-01-03T10:30:59</h3>
Not really, it's akin to Americans calling us Limeys. My dictionary says it is <i>Austral &amp; NZ slang offensive</i> however.

Well, by "naughty" I meant "offensive".  I guess what I'm asking is how Brits take it.  Is it the sort of word that would make you want to punch someone who said it?  Is it in the "mildly offensive" category?  Or is it in the "good natured ribbing" category?
<p>
Of course, I thought "limey" was offensive - I never use it, but maybe it's not such a big deal to Brits?</p>

<i>I guess I'm asking how Brits take it.</i> <br> <br>Well I'm sure most couldn't really care less - I know I don't.  The term 'limey' certainly isn't offensive as it's really not a word that is ever used in conversation over there.  I'm sure the vast majority of people will have (a) never even heard the term before or (b) heard the term but have no clue what it means.  It's really just an American thing as far as I can tell.<br> <br>Calling a Brit a 'limey' is probably comparable to Brits calling Americans 'yanks'.  I have called a couple of my friends &amp; co-workers 'yanks' and the reaction I get is "huh?" - in short, they don't 'get it'.  You'd probably get the same reaction over there with 'limey'<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

I understand "yanks", though perhaps that's from watching old war movies where the British army always refers to the U.S. troops as "the yanks".
<p>
Of course, calling someone a yank in the deep south might just be offensive to someone.  The South is gonna do it again, ya know.</p>

I doubt that you'd get punched but YMMV. I often get into trouble by confusing Australians and New Zealanders - for some reason they are very touchy about this.

<i>Pommie</i> isn't a naughty word but a derogatory term refer to English people mainly used by Antipodeans and is generally shortened to a simple <i>Pom</i>.

And the offense is given by the word that always follows "pommie": "bastard".<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<p>
