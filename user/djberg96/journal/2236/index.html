<p>Ok - I've narrowed down the "Bad file number" error.  Looks like you'll get that when there's a problem performing a 'close()' on a Filehandle glob.  Not that I'm any further now than I was before for knowing that, since I don't know why the close is failing in the first place.
<P>
I would really like it if we had a normal network setup.  But then, does anyone?  I am now fighting with what should have been a simple process - emailing/paging in the event of program failure.  For some reason, emails never reach me, and I suspect it's because our Sendmail configuration is stupid, the firewall is causing issues, or the mailhost is fucked up.
<P>
Debugging this code leads me to believe I'm not connecting to the mailhost at all (looks like CONNREFUSED is what I'm hitting, with $! being set to "I/O Error"), but then it *does* make it to me if I run the program in a debugger.  Very weird.
<P>
I tried both Mail::Sender and Net::SMTP.  Maybe they're floating around out there and will show up 4 hours from now....
<P>
I'm probably going to come in tomorrow to make up for all the lost time I've had this week on these freaky errors.  Fuck.</p>
