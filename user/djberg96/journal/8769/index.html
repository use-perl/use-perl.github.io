<p>Last night I started working on the Linux version of <I>Sys::Top</I>.  It's going to be Linux first, 'cuz Linux will be the easiest - all those plain text files under /proc, ya know.
<P>
I lost some quality coding time because, well, the Packers were playing last night and I had to watch the game.  Our defense is much improved over the last few weeks and I now think we have a legitimate shot at the SuperBowl.  This, of course, depends largely on Favre's health.  Anyway, we dominated most of the game and won 24-10.
<P>
One thing that always makes me cringe is when a quarterback goes back to throw a pass, and the ball just goes backwards instead of forward.  That happened to the Miami quarterback, Lucas, last night.  I've been watching football over 20 years now and I know what that means 90 percent of the time - back injury.  They should have pulled him right there and then.</p>

Please, if you only need to rely on Favre's health, you're fine.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)  About 10 straight seasons without missing a game, I wouldn't worry.  I've been saying for a few weeks the Packers are the team to beat.  The Patriots could be up in the top tier again soon, look out<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... if the Patriots hadn't had all those turnovers and penalties, they could have beat Green Bay (man, what a fugly game that was!).

Well, his left acl was sprained a couple weeks back when a DL landed on him, and those can be nasty.  He played with a brace on Sunday, which seemed to hobble him a bit - good thing we have a solid running game.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
<p>
I wasn't convinced they would get anywhere in the playoffs initially because their defense was so shoddy in the first few weeks.  Lately, though, it has started to gel and it's certainly much improved.</p>
