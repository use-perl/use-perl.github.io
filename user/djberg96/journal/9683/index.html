<p>Just got back last night from a nice week in Florida visiting the relatives.  I stayed most of the time at my sister's new mansion.  Her husband is involved with capital investment, or general monetary investment, or something that deals a lot with money.  Anyway, they're very rich.  The guest room I stayed in is as big as my apartment.  Sickening really.  I took lots of pictures.
<P>
I also went to <I>Islands of Adventure</I> in Orlando with my other sister and her husband for the day.  That was fun, even though it was very crowded.  The <I>Spider Man</I> ride was worth it  by itself.
<P>
I also spent a couple days with the folks, and I played golf with my dad for the first time in forever.  It was fun.  We golfed like crap, but it was only a par three course so we never got too off track, and we had fun.
<P>
I received some nice gifts, but my favorite so far has been the <I>Conjure One</I> CD that my sister got me.  It's a mix of music from different artists (I think) and could probably best be described as "trance", although it's hard to categorize.  Anyway, I plan on buying a lot more music from the internet.  The radio just plain sucks these days.
<P>
That's all for now, I guess.  I should have a question ready for this Friday, in case you're having trivia withdrawal. :)</p>
