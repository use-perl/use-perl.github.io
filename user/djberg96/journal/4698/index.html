<p>One of the things I really like about Perl, especially when doing Tk programming, is named arguments.
<P>
Until recently, I didn't think this was possible in Ruby short of using an anonymous hash and parsing the hash in the 'initialize' method.  However, Guy Decoux recently provided this idiom:
<ECODE>
module SomeMod
   def initialize(attributes)
      attributes.each do |k, v|
         type.send(:attr_accessor, k)
         send("#{k}=", v)
      end
   end 
end<br/><br/>sm = SomeMod.new(name=>'Dan',rank=>'SrA')
puts sm.rank #=> 'SrA'
sm.rank = 'General'
puts sm.rank #=> 'General'<br/><br/></ECODE>
Not only does this let you do named arguments with Ruby, it automatically provides <I>get/set</I> ability.  Will Perl 6 be able to do this, hmmm?
<P>
The only downside is that you'll have to manually parse out any bogus attributes a programmer might try and create.

Still no parameter checking though. It's a shame, as this is one area where Python still kicks both Perl and Ruby's ass.

I'll probably get slapped for this but, "so what?".  I have never, ever missed this "feature" in either Perl or Ruby.  I think Dave Thomas pretty well summed up my feelings about it <a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?hl=en&amp;threadm=m2itql7aq7.fsf%40zip.local.thomases.com&amp;rnum=1&amp;prev=/groups%3Fhl%3Den%26q%3Dparameter%2Bchecking%2Bpython%26meta%3Dgroup%253Dcomp.lang.ruby" title="google.com">here</a google.com>
<p>
I'm genuinely curious as to what advantage you think this would bring to Ruby, or whether or not you think this is a real selling point for Python.</p>

Sorry, I realised later the subject of my post wasn't what I meant.<br> <br>I meant simply that this sort of thing (named params) should be built in, with checking done on the actual names passed in, performed at the parser level. I don't mean to imply checking of the type of a variable.<br> <br>This covers 90% of the times you need to pass named parameters (the other 10% being where you might not know the names you need to pass ahead of time - in which case you construct your API so you can pass a hash instead), and would certainly help catch a large number of hash-related typos.

Ah, I see.  Myself and others have suggested that as a feature for Ruby 2.0. Whether or not it's adopted remains to be seen.  Given that Ruby 2.0 is vaporware at the moment, it's not much of an issue.
<p>
Will Perl 6 handle this any differently?</p>
