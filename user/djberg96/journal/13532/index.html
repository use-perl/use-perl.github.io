<p>Sanity prevailed at work this week when a clunky looking VB timesheet application was finally replaced with a slick web interface.  I think we were the last company on the planet not to use a web interface for timesheets.
<P>
Between OpenOffice and the new time reporting interface, I have even less reason to use my Windows box. :)</p>

<p>
I guess we are only company who use CSV + CVS as a storage format for timesheets and a couple of Perl modules to query them and publish on TWiki<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<p>We used to be a big user of the timing app you got with quickbooks and now we've got an in-house c# desktop app to act as big brother.</p>

<p>[Because of this change] <cite>I have even less reason to use my Windows box.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) </cite> </p>

<p>My work is (trying) to replace its current timesheeting systems with a single web-based timesheeting system. Niggle is that it's based on Oracle forms and is a bit clunky. Big problem (to me) is that although it's web based, it uses sufficient JavaScript that it doesn't work on anything other than recent IE. So not only can't I use it on my Linux desktop, but the very old work Windows 95 box that I also have fails to grok it correctly. And I thought that people realised <a href="http://boo.com/" title="boo.com">the consequences of using non-inclusive JavaScript</a boo.com> </p>
