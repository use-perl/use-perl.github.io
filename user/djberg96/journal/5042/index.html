<p>I finally finished my C# training course.  Rather than go into a lengthy diatribe on the language, I'll have my friends Stan and Cartman from <I>South Park</I> fame sum it up for me:
<P>
Stan: "Gay"
<BR>
Cartman: "Totally Gay"
<P>
Ok - so my real feeling is that it's the bastard child of C & Java, and MS is the father who plans to raise his son to the throne.
<P>
This language is a convoluted morass of syntax and structure borrowed from other languages and in almost every case those other languages do it better.  The few good features that is has is not enough to warrant ever programming in it.</p>

C#: So they looked at good features in other languages and left them there or implemented them worse.<br> <br>Perl: so they looked at good features in other languages and took them and/or improved them.<br> <br>C#: They looked at the bad features, and kept them.<br> <br>Perl: Well, nobody's perfect.

What, exactly, does the sexual orientation of a programming language have to do with the price of cod? Come to that, how does a programming language come to have a sexual orientation in the first place?<br> <br>Or is it just happy?

South Park is comedy. Rude, obscene, offensive and disgusting. But still comedy.

And your point here would be?<br> <br>Yes, I know South Park is a comedy. And a bloody funny one at that. But I was brought up to believe that using terms like 'gay' as a perjorative is terminological inexactitude of a particularly abhorrent sort. It's marginally okay in a comedy where we're expected to laugh at the idiocy of the characters presented, but using it in real life, even with the 'trick' of distancing yourself by sticking it in quotation marks is offensive.<br> <br>If (as I assume) dj thought C# was crap then why didn't he just say that?

Pray tell, pdcawley, is this your post?  Or is the *other* Piers David Cawley (who lives in the UK and happens to be a computer enthusiast)?

Yup, that was me, and I stand by it. What's your point?
