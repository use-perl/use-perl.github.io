<p>I've been working on a win32-service module for Ruby, using both the Perl and Python source for code that I can shamelessly plagiarize.  Well, mostly just API ideas, since I'm writing everything in C, rather than using the Win32 module that comes with Ruby.
<P>
From there I want to run Ruby programs as a service.  However, I've quickly learned that just slapping in "c:\ruby\bin\ruby myfile.rb" as the service binary argument doesn't work.  Oh, sure, it will *create* the service, but it won't actually *run*.
<P>
This lead me back to Perl and Python.  Unfortunately, I don't think the PerlSvc source is open (it's from ActiveState) and I can't find the source for the executable that Mark Hammond wrote to turn Python programs into Windows services.  It may be closed source as well.  I'm not sure.
<P>
Trying to find a tutorial on creating windows services has proved to be a bigger pain than I thought.  The few that I've found I didn't like.  Mainly, I just want something that says, "you must do X, Y and Z to setup your executable as a Windows service."
<P>
In the meantime, I've come across something called <a href="http://www.firedaemon.com">FireDaemon</a> which may solve our problems for now.  I'll have to play and see.</p>
