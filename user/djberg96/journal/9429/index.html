<p>Do you want to know the real reason IE beat Netscape 4.x?  Do you *really* want to know?  I'll tell you.
<P>
Netscape 4.x SUCKS!
<P>
The font rendering is a joke.  I can't even read some sites because the type is too small.  And, no, adjusting the font scaling properties under preferences doesn't help (usually).
<P>
Downloads.  Don't even get me started on downloads.  I don't know how many times it *thinks* it's finished, only to discover that it hasn't downloaded the entire file.  I've had to download several files two or three times to finally *get it all*.
<P>
Crashing.  You know, for all the whining, IE is a helluva lot more stable than Netscape 4.x, *period*.  I can count the number of times IE has crashed on me on one hand (ok, maybe two).  Netscape 4.x would require hands, toes, and maybe a few other appendages.
<P>
Look and feel.  IE is better.  End of discussion.  Most of the "I don't like the UI for IE" stems from the "I hate everything MS makes" crowd.  Netscape 4.x is ugly.
<P>
Anyway, I'm going to try the Netscape 7 package again, which I actually downloaded via <I>links</I> on our Linux box and I'm now copying over because I couldn't get my own Netscape to download the whole file.
<P>
Miserable piece of crap.</p>

<h2>Netscape on Linux</h2>

My biggest problem with Netscape was its stability on Linux. It drove me crazy. That might apply to other Unix variations, I don'te know for sure. I didn't have nearly as much trouble on Windows.



<h2>Why were you using it?</h2>

My god man, put down the browser, and back away slowly.<br> <br>I haven't seriously used NS4 in a long, long time. The only time is here at work because they stuck with it for some god awful reason. Thankfully we're moving to Netscape 7 (couldn't persuade them to just run straight Mozilla,  gotta love the lizard).<br> <br>Just say no is my opinion.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)



<h2>What?!?</h2>

<p>
  You mean you were still using NS4? Bargh. How could you survive this long? On windows, I switched to IE with version <em>3.02</em>, and I can't be accused of being very pro-MS. Netscape was qiute simply a mistake, a poor excuse for "browser", all the way since version 2. I don't think I ever had it installed on my Linux box.
</p>

<p>
  A graphical browser needs to do a few things, amongst which: read HTML, read text, read images, support HTTP, understand CSS and perhaps a few other things. NS4 fails to do any of the above, so I'm not even sure it qualifies as a browser.
</p>

<p>
  Do yourself a favour, you know where your rm is.

I was actually using Opera for quite a while, even though it was a little buggy.  Sometimes downloads wouldn't start at all, and once in a while it would post form data twice, but it looked nice and generally worked well enough.
<p>
When I moved to Denver I had to change my http proxy.  That's when I discovered a fatal bug in Opera - it strips out "/" characters in the path for some reason, so it gets confused, e.g.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/my/proxy/cgi.bin gets interpreted as<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/myproxycgi.bin.  I've submitted a bug report.
</p><p>
I tried the 1.2b Solaris tarball on the mozilla site (provided by Sun).  Guess what?  That tar ball is busted - it's not complete.  I double checked the file sizes - it's just not all there.  Good job Sun.
</p><p>
I'll probably just try and build Mozilla from source.</p>
