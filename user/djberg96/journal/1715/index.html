<p>Spent some time chatting with Ben Trott regarding interaction of his Net::SSH::Perl module and the $SIG{__DIE__} and $SIG{__WARN__} handlers.
<P>
As it stands now (i.e. version 1.23), your script will bite the dust if you try to use both his module and the signal handlers because of "eval".
<P>
I got around this by modifying 3 of his modules (RSA.pm, Cipher.pm and Auth.pm), and making 'local' copies of the signal handlers within the appropriate subroutines (making them undef).  I probably just should have done it once, in the constructor, but I was led around by the debugger and once I got it working I didn't feel like going back.
<P>
Of course, after tinkering with this nonsense for a couple of hours I thought to myself, "$self, do you think that there might be a module out there that deals with this?".  Naturally, I found one (only just recently written) called Sig::PackageScoped that deals with just this situation.
<P>
As it stands it could probably be handled better than just sending ssh errors to the ether (i.e. ignoring them), since I might actually want to trap those someday as well.  I've suggested this idea to Ben, and he seems to like it.<br/><br/></p>

Not a very helpful comment.  Why is it considered harmful?  Is it because of its interaction with 'eval'?<br/><br/>perlvar lists this as a bug, and not one anyone seems to be too concerned with fixing.  Given that more than one author uses this paradigm, I need a little more detail.

Ok - did you update this post?  I don't remember it being a link to anything (hence my first post).
<p>
What are your feelings on doing something like:</p><blockquote><div> <tt>*CORE::GLOBAL::die = sub{<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...handler<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... }</tt> </div></blockquote>

I had this conversation once with Stas Bekman... Personally I think that overriding CORE::GLOBAL::die is even worse, because it probably breaks the case where some other module actually *does* use objectified exceptions. And overriding core functions should probably be done with utmost caution.<br> <br>I talked a bit about a possible solution <a href="http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=160198" title="perlmonks.org">here on perlmonks</a perlmonks.org>. But it still doesn't protect you against the stupidity of others.
