<p>I went to visit a friend of mine in Colorado Springs yesterday.  Beatiful view - better than Denver IMHO.  He was there visiting his (German) girlfriend Claudia, who seems very nice.  I even tortured her a bit with my bad german.
<P>
He's visiting because he's been recalled into the Army...after being out for over 5 years.  At least he gets bumped up to major and his old job is guaranteed for a few years.  There's also no guarantee that he's being sent to the desert.  He'll likely be replacing someone else who *will* get sent to the desert.
<P>
Checking my military ID, I see that I'm still on Inactive Reserve until August 22 of this year.  Not that I think they'll need programmer's for a war with Iraq, but I could end up getting shoved into gate guard duty or something.  I received a letter from the AF yesterday, but breathed easier when it turned out it was only an ad to join the reserves.
<P>
I think I'll pass.</p>
