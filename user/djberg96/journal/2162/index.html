<p>So, I decide to screw around with another problem today that's been giving me grief.  First, I had to deal with "unable to allocate address", which screwed me up until I realized that I had forgotten to modify my code when the host name and ip address of our (ex) production box had changed.
<P>
That should fix everything, right?  Wrong.  I'm using the Net::SSH::Perl module, trying to connect to a series of machines and do a couple of commands.  Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't and I get "permission denied".  After stepping through the debugger, banging my head on the table for a while and chugging an extra Coke for good luck, I finally narrow it down to the fact that one machine seems to be griping about the cipher that I'm using.  I decide to use the default.
<P>
That should fix everything, right?  Wrong again.  I notice some strange errors stored in $!.  The errors "bad file descriptor" and "illegal seek" start showing up.  I think to myself, "$self, this is eerily familiar to the other problem I was having in that other program where I use sockets."  So I bang my head on the table some more, drink another Coke and tinker around a bit more...
<P>
What do I discover?  Something is seriously wrong, and it ain't my code.  Whenever I create a single object, and connect to a single host, everything is fine.  However (comma), when I make connections within a "foreach" loop odd things start to happen.  This is bad.  This is very bad.  I play with $| - no luck.  I am now virtually certain that there is an IO bug somewhere in Perl.  IO::Socket?  IO::Select?  I've already got the evidence for Net::SSH::Perl set up for a post.  I'm going to put together a similar test for IO::Socket tomorrow and see if I get similar results.  I'm about 99% certain I will.  I don't completely understand why those errors are fucking up my programs, but there's no other explanation.  They work by themselves and fail inside of loops.
<P>
This is just fucking great.  A bug in IO::Socket will grind my work to a screeching halt if that turns out to be the case.  So, what do I do?  Go back to system calls as much as possible?  Wrap huge chunks of code inside eval statements?  I'll probably lose my cool tomorrow if it turns out to be a bug in Perl, unless it's easily fixed.
<P>
There's always Ruby or Python.  Java is even starting to look good now.  Maybe I've had too much liquor.<br/><br/></p>

You need something with higher octane, so to speak.  Coke is heresy; Mountain Dew and coffee are the only true beverages.  Everything else is nourishment (milk and water) or escapism (beer).<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)
