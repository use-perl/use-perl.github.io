<p>Baseball is just digging itself in deeper, isn't it?  By now most people on this side of the pond know that the latest All-Star game ended in a tie.  For anyone not familiar with baseball, you never end in a tie.  You keep playing until someone wins.
<P>
The whole situation was handled terribly from what I heard.  They went to 11 innings and, after one out had already occurred, called the game.  Fans were not happy.
<P>
This morning on the radio I heard Bud Selig (The MLB Commissioner) say that two teams are in serious financial trouble (he wouldn't say which ones).  A strike is looming.
<P>
Personally, I hope a strike happens.  The league will collapse and perhaps a new league will form with public ownership as an option, revenue sharing, and salary caps.</p>

<h2>Teams in trouble</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ziggy/">ziggy</a> on 2002-07-11T13:56:46</h3>
One of the two teams in serious financial trouble is Montreal.  Over the last few years, it's been a struggle for the Expos to get non-negative attendance figures.  The resolution the MLB has been batting around is to contract the National League by two teams, or just selling the franchises to a city that really [thinks it] wants a baseball team (like Washington, DC).
<p>
I forget who the other team is.  Florida comes to mind, but I think that the Marlins were the 3rd out of 4 troubled teams.</p>

I don't think Montreal is in any danger of running out of money - being owned and run by the other 29 owners.<br> <br>The "surprise" team is supposedly Arizona is terms of the team not being able to meet payroll and the team in huge amounts of debt is supposedly Tampa Bay.

<h2>All-Star Media Event</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/modred/">modred</a> on 2002-07-11T15:02:28</h3>
I don't have a problem with the All-Star game ending in a tie, it was the correct decision. How would you like to be the manager who asks a pitcher on another team to go out and pitch some more and that pitcher ends up hurt? Given that it now takes an hour of pre-game cermonies to get to the game, it really seems that it is more of a media event than an athletic contest.<br> <br>It seems that the All-Star is getting to be more and more like the NFL prob bowl with star players declining out of injury or fear of injury. <br> <br>The owners have dug themselves a large portion of the current hole in which they find themselves. The existing owners were so intent on getting the expansion fees that they neglected a simple matter of economics. The pool of baseball players with major league talent is finite. Adding 4 extra teams who want players from that pool is can't help but increase the amount of money it takes to get a player. The supply stays the same and the demand is increased.<br> <br>

I actually wouldn't have had a problem with it if it had been fleshed out before hand.  The fact that they waited two innings (and one out) made it worse.
<p>
I think a cool solution would be a home-run derby by batters 1-3 on each team if both teams are tied after 9.  With players like Bonds, I think it would have been a big hit (no pun intended).</p>
