<p>I've decided to give porting Matija Grabnar's <I>File::Tail</I> module over to Ruby a shot.  I actually already have a basic implementation working, though I had to install 1.7.2 to do it.  Seems there's no sysseek in 1.6.7.  I see there are quite a few configurable options in Matija's module, though I'm betting 99% of us use the defaults 100% of the time.  I have to decide if I want to try to duplicate that flexibility or simply add it on a user request only basis.
<P>
In gaming news, I've been playing <I>Disciples II</I> a lot lately.  I'd describe it as a cross between <I>Heroes of Might and Magic</I> and <I>Final Fantasy</I>.  It's good, but not great.  Good time killer, though, and for only $30 I'm not complaining.</p>

 <p> To be honest, I cut and paste File::Tail options out of a two year old program a co-op developed. I have little (retained) knowledge of what they do.  I do know that the module doesn't work exactly the way I expect if I don't use those options, and I do seem to recall that the options that make it do what I want are not the options I would expect. </p>

 <p> By the way, while you're thinking about writing your own, I have a File::Tail::Seekable subclass I created for one application.  That might be a common  desire in any language. </p>

Thanks for the info.  While looking at the source, I was befuddled by some of the things he does, but perhaps it will make more sense to me later.  Perhaps it's because I settled on a line based approach to reading data over a character based one. <p> Here's a brief example of usage in case you're interested: </p><blockquote><div> <tt>t = Tail.new("somefile.txt") <br>  <br> # To imitate 'tail -f', use a block <br> t.tail do |line| <br> &nbsp; &nbsp;puts line <br> end <br>  <br> # To simply grab the last X lines, don't use a block <br> a = t.tail(20) <br> puts a</tt> </div></blockquote>
