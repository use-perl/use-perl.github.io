<div class="span8">
<p>A <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/djberg96/journal/10807">while back</a> I moaned about the state of #solaris on freenode.  Everyone once in a great while I get desperate and go back there for help with something.
<P>
I think it's been months since I was there last, but today I went to visit #solaris because I'm having trouble with the openssl package from blastwave.  That was a mistake.
<P>
The channel has deteriorated severely.  It is now nothing but an insult-fest, led by two of the channel ops - insomnia (Katherine Loux I believe) and neominder (unknown).  It's ridiculous.  This is not a case of someone having a bad day and going off once in a while - this is SOP.  The folks in #freenode weren't too helpful either, unfortunately.
<P>
So, my goal now is to have channel ops removed from these two clowns.  I'm also going to contact Sun Microsystems and see if I can find a manager willing to hang out on #solaris for a few days and perhaps consider if they want to continue Katherine's employment.</p>

Maybe you just have no sense of humor man.  We help a ton of people everyday, and a lot of people who come into the channel stay around after we help them just to hang out.
