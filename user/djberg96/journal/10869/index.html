<p>My next project (which I'm working on right now) is to port Aryeh Goldsmith's <I>Net::AIM</I>.  Believe it or not, this is for a work project.
<P>
We're going to use an AIM bot as an interface for a distributed server.  In other words, let's say you have a XMLRPC server with the method "diskspace" which simply spits out the results of a 'df' command.  Using our handy AIM bot, you'll be able type "diskspace hostname" in your AIM window, and you'll get the df results of that host immediately sent to your AIM window.
<P>
This is mostly just a whiz-bang thing to impress the PHB's.  It's also PRIOR ART, for any smart ass companies who think they're going to patent this technique. :)
<P>
Meanwhile, Aryeh's code could use some serious polish.  I'm finding a fair amount of dead and redundant code.  I'm especially curious why he didn't make AIM.pm a subclass of Connection.pm, instead of redefining all the methods and delegating them all to a Connection object.  Seems a lot of extra work to me but, hey, it works. :)</p>

I'm glad you're doing this.  I was looking at Net::AIM in the past to notify me of hourly regression test failures, instead of email, but I could never get it to work right.
<p>
Let me know if you need help.</p>

So far, I haven't been able to get send_im() to work, although handlers seem to work ok, which is all we really need here.  This module could really use some more documentation, especially when it comes to excactly what the event handler names are and what I should expect for Event data.
<p>
There is some code at <a href="http://www.wiredbots.com/" title="wiredbots.com">wiredbots</a wiredbots.com> that includes some comments that have helped.</p>
