<p>One of my colleagues is in the dog-house today.  Seems he went to a movie last night, put his pager in silent mode, and forgot to turn it back on.  He wasn't wearing it, either.  It just so happened that one of the major production servers went down today, and no one could get in touch with him until 9am.  Oops.
<P>
In Ruby news, James Hranicky and Curt Sampson have provided some good ideas for the Ruby tail module.  Curt is the guy who added the "-F" option to the BSD tail command.  I've incorporated their ideas into what I already had.  It's shaping up nicely.
<P>
The Solaris binary from the Mozilla home page crashes on Solaris 9.  So, today I made an aborted attempt to build Mozilla from the source.   Too many dependencies and failed 'make' calls which I don't feel like debugging.  Screw it.  I'll stick with Opera.</p>

Been there, done that, got the stern lecture<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br> <br>I didn't turn mine off though, the bloody battery ran out instead.  It <b>did</b> run out - honest<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br> <br>Other notable excuses from my workplace that I've heard over the years include:<br> <br>&bull; I flushed my pager down the toilet.<br>&bull; My pager was in vibrate mode and it vibrated off the kitchen counter into the trash.<br>&bull; Dog ate it.<br>&bull; Fell out of car window and someone ran it over (I kid you not).

Because I was going on vacation out of range, I left my pager home, but turned it off so as not to freak out the people house-sitting.  Of course I put it back on my belt once I came home and forgot about it.<br> <br>I heard of someone going swimming with it on.  I myself waded way off shore during low tide, knowing full well if I slipped and fell I was screwed.<br> <br>Even right now the battery is low and I'll need to remember to put a new one it.  I'll get to it<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-/<br>
