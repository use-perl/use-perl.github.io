<p>After bothering Ben Trott more about the POSIX::setsid() problem I was having with Net::SSH::Perl, he finally pointed out to me that it appeared to be *normal* behavior for the program to hang because it's waiting for an EOF that it never receives.
<P>
I should have known that, right?  Wrong.  I went out to deja and into comp.security.ssh where I find exactly *one* post about the subject.  It turns out that the behavior changed after 1.2.27 (according to Mr. Silverman).  It *used* to terminate the connection without waiting for a return value, but they decided to change it.  They also appear to have *not* documented it.  More than one person was surprised by this.
<P>
Personally (and others seem to agree) I find this effing annoying.  I mean, at least give us the *option* to terminate the connection when calling a process that backgrounds itself instead of *guessing* what it is we want.  I mean, when you call a process you will *know* if it returns a value (and if you care about it).
<P>
A workaround was provided, though.  Just send stdout of the program you call to /dev/null.  I originally had stdout sent to the trash bin but commented that out because it was too handy for debugging purposes.  Oops.
<P>
I'll play with this on Monday.  Oh, and my apologies to Ben Trott for stating that there was a bug in Net::SSH::Perl - there isn't.  There's a bug, er, feature in ssh.</p>
