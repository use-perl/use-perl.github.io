<h2>Burglary is strange</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/brian_d_foy/">brian_d_foy</a> on 2002-11-07T03:10:53</h3>
Although legal definitions vary from place to place, in my part of the world ( <a href="http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/ucmj2.htm#929.%20ART.%20129.%20BURGLARY" title="af.mil">Uniform Code of Military Justice, Article 129</a af.mil> ) a burglary has to happen at night in someone's home.  During the day time it is called housebreaking.  Why that matters I do not know.  The only time it mattered to me I ended up charging the guy with <a href="http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/ucmj2.htm#908.%20ART.%20108.%20MILITARY%20PROPERTY%20OF%20UNITED%20STATES-LOSS,%20DAMAGE,%20DESTRUCTION,%20OR%20WRONGFUL%20DISPOSITION" title="af.mil">Damage to Government Property, Article 108</a af.mil> anyway.  Maybe I should look it up in the Oxford English Dictionary someday.  I bet burglary was something that kept happening to Old Man Burglar, like Cow Tipping is named after cows, and that's  how it got its name.<br> <br>It also has nothing to do with theft.  It is the act of breaking and entering that constitutes the crime, which Winona clearly did not do, but which <a href="http://www.pardonliddy.org/LiddyFrameRMD.html" title="pardonliddy.org">G. Gordon "Rat Eater" Liddy</a pardonliddy.org> did do.<br> <br>That doesn't mean I don't think she shouldn't fry.  Not!<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

The AP news article implied that burglarly had to do with intent (to some degree), and that must have been the 5 1/2 hour sticking point the jury deliberated.  I guess the fact that she had a pair of scissors on her when she walked into the store wasn't enough.
<p>
I was hoping for the death penalty, but I guess she's just gonna get community service.  These damned liberal judges...</p>

Yes, burglary must have criminal intent, but it also  has to be breaking and entering.  The link to the UCMJ from my previous comment stipulates both.
