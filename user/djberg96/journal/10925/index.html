<p>That's it.  I'm tired of hitting IO limits with Oracle SQL (both the stuff I write and the stuff others have written that I end up maintaining).  So, today during lunch I'm going to buy the <I>Oracle SQL Tuning Pocket Reference</I>
<P>
That's just to tide me over until I either buy <I>Mastering Oracle SQL</I> or <I>Oracle SQL - High Performance Tuning</I>.  I'll take a look at each one and decide which one I think is better.
<P>
Anyone out there have both that could comment?</p>

<h2>Mastering Oracle SQL</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jdavidb/">jdavidb</a> on 2003-03-06T19:41:19</h3>
<p>I just got Mastering Oracle SQL.  It's a nice book, but I don't think it really focuses on tuning.  It seems to be more concerned with features.  I haven't really looked at it much, though, so there may be tuning advice throughout.</p>

<p>Oracle Performance Tuning from O'Reilly has a section on tuning SQL.  I got it for <a href="http://www.75offbookstores.com/" title="75offbookstores.com">five bucks</a 75offbookstores.com>!<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>



<h2>Interesting SQL article</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/runrig/">runrig</a> on 2003-03-06T22:03:16</h3>
<a href="http://www.ddj.com/" title="ddj.com">DDJ</a ddj.com> had an <a href="http://www.ddj.com/documents/s=7119/ddj0205e/0205e.htm" title="ddj.com">interesting article</a ddj.com> a while back on external SQL rewriters, which to me amounted to saying that when it comes to SQL, sometimes you just gotta try different things until it comes out better. I'm usually pretty good at SQL tuning, but there's no way I could manually brute force a better solution than a rewriter (at least not on a complex query like they have in the example).



<h2>Got one, have read the other</h2>

<p>Get Oracle Performance Tuning, if you really need to know some tricks on tuning.. Pity though, the last edition was published in 1996, quite a bit has changed since then (especially with the optimizers).. Some of their advice is still valid, (minimizing joins, exists, avoiding INs).. Mastering SQL is more about the neat features of Oracle SQL rather than tuning specifically,as jdavidb noted.. (a former co-worker had it, so I went through it a while back)
