<p>I started to feel crappy yesterday, and it got worse today.  I woke up from nap and had to use the bathroom.  Just as I finished I blacked out, fell forward and smacked my head into the towel rack, then fell backwards into the wall and landed on the floor.
<P>
I'm lucky I didn't break my neck (or spray the bathroom - ick).  I layed back down for a while and got up feeling somewhat better.  I'm probably going to call in sick tomorrow.  I feel good enough to vegetate in front of the tv or computer, but that's about it.  Physical activity is out of the question.
<P>
<B>UPDATE:</B> I think I know why I feel like shit.  I took a leftover Doxyzosin pill, thinking it was an antibiotic.  It's not; it's an alpha-blocker that I only took once or twice before and quit because it made me feel faint and nauseous.  I'm such a dumbass.  I still have a cough (and had a sore throat), so I succeeded in making matters worse.  The doxazosin is going in the trash.</p>
