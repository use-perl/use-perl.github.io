<p>Looks like we're going to be doing performance reviews again.  Like most, this one will have a ranking system from "outstanding" to "poor".
<P>
The problem with all performance review systems, as I saw in the military, is that they quickly become inflated.  By that I mean "outstanding" becomes average, "average" becomes poor, and "poor" means you're about to be fired.
<P>
In the military it was worse, as your performance rating gave you points towards promotion and getting anything less than the max could screw you out of a stripe (and thus a pay grade).  Fortunately, that never happened to me, but I knew one or two guys who *did* have that happen.
<P>
I think one-on-one meetings your immediate boss are generally sufficient.  Of course, I've never been a manager, so what do I know?</p>

<h2>Key is to get your name out there</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Herkemer/">Herkemer</a> on 2002-12-09T16:48:35</h3>
It's a little different in a small company, but when I worked for a large company, my day-to-day goal was to get my boss to mention me to her boss at least once a week.  That way, when it came to review time it was much easier for my boss to recommend a raise, because her boss knew who I was.  I also tried to keep a nice little log of what I did.  This helped at review time because you had to put down your 5 biggest accomplishments in the "self evaluation" and I did so much stuff I could never remember.
