A model of IBM typewriter from that era that could do Time New Roman in proportional has already been identified, and various folks have noted that when Microsoft did Times New Roman, they wanted to stick as closely as they could to the 1931 original. There are, of couse, counter, counter claims.

It's almost certainly a forgery.  In any case, I think both candidates should drop the military service attacks.  It isn't doing either of them any good, it isn't convincing anyone, and it probably only irritates the current and ex-military folks (myself included).
<p>
Now, can we move on to a more immediate topic?  Global trade?  Health care?  Iraq?  Environment?</p>

dws, but that's not really the problem with the memo.  It's not that the font did not exist, it is that it did not exist in a typewriter that could do that exact spacing, regarding ABC dimensions ("pseudo-kerning"), and all the rest.<br> <br>Also, the typewriter found was not a typewriter at all, but a typesetter.  No one would use a typesetter for this memo.<br> <br>The most generous thing I can say is that it is extremely unlikely that the memos are authentic, and none of the counterclaims by CBS have put a serious dent in the claims against them, and that the burden of proof lies entirely with CBS.
