<p>More auto-reports generated this week, which I put directly into MS Excel format, thanks to John McNamara's module.  I swear, I spend twice as much time getting the spreadsheet to look nicey-nice than I do actually writing the guts of these reports.
<P>
I took a look at Spreadsheet::WriteExcel::FromDB, but it doesn't appear very flexible.  I think I'll pass.
<P>
I need to use DBD::Proxy at some point just to see how it works (and to say that I used it).  I doubt I really need it with Oracle.
<P>
While writing reports isn't very exciting, the client-server app my co-worker and I are working on is lots o' fun.  Keeps me sane.  That, and playing with Visual Perl has been fun (collapse...expand...collapse...expand...that's sooo cool). I thought about installing it at home but that's <B>2 gig</B> of my measley 8 GB partition.
<P>
Tried to build Math-GMP on both my home machine and at work, using both cygwin and mingw32.  No luck.  I can get the gmp library to build, but I can't get the module itself to 'make'.  I'm just trying to get Net::SSH::Perl support at home for ssh1.  From what I've read, no one else can get it to install either.
<P>
I've asked Ben about just using Math-BigInt for MSWin32 machines.  We'll see what he has to say.</p>

<h2>Spreadsheet::WriteExcel</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/vek/">vek</a> on 2002-02-02T13:37:52</h3>
is a <b>very</b> nice module indeed.  I used it heavily for report generation in a project 6 or so month's ago.  There are always going to be users who <b>must</b> have that damn spreadsheet in their hands - this module makes that very easy to do from Perl...
