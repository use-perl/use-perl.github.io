<p>Last night I decided I felt like having a cup of chai tea and futzing around on my laptop with my new and shiny wireless card.  So, I grabbed the laptop and headed down to the local coffee shop which I had visited once before.
<P>
However, I made the mistake of coming on "music night", which meant the place was filled with folks in their late teens and early twenties.  Undaunted, I got myself a big cup o' chai, fired up the laptop and listened to the music (which wasn't bad).
<P>
The only bad thing was that it was clear I was being gawked at, like some kind of zoo animal, because I wasn't in the "young, hip, pseudo-intellectual" crowd.  There was one rather large and tattoo'ed individual who looked like he wanted to kick my ass just for being over 30.  It wasn't very comfortable.
<P>
I finished my chai right about the time my battery died.  It was a perfect excuse to bug out.  Anyway, I felt pretty damned old after that.</p>
