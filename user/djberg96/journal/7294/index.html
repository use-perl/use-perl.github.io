<p>While playing on the laptop today, I decided to try a radio station called "Liquid Lounge".  It's a sort of trance/jazz mix I think, and I really liked what I heard.  Most of what I'm hearing has a nice, but relaxing rhythm that doesn't distract me while I'm trying to code, for example.
<P>
However, since I was using the Windows Media Player, I couldn't tell what specific song was playing, but it had an ad for the "RadioFreeVirgin" media player which *does* tell you the song, group and album.  So I figured what the heck, and installed it.
<P>
The folks who wrote this thing clearly have a sense of humor.  During the install process it asks where you would like an icon installed.  One of the options is "surface of the moon".  Also, when it's initially starting up, it has some diagnostic messages to let you know what's its doing, combined with some humorous lines, such as, "buffering output....picking crumbs out of my teeth....downloading exception handlers....do I look fat?....", etc.
<P>
Well, *I* thought it was humorous anyway.</p>

<h2>Winamp</h2>

<p>Sounds like the readme file for <a href="http://www.winamp.com/" title="winamp.com">Winamp</a winamp.com>, which includes these instructions:</p>

<blockquote><div> <p> <i>Start Winamp3 via whatever method you prefer. That would mean either clicking
the quickstart icon, the desktop icon, or by projecting your awesome mutant
powers onto a nearby human and exploding their brain in such a way as to cause
variations in the sunspot cycle which causes in turn a freakish burst of
neutrinos to blast forth from the sun's molten innards (the advanced student can
use a nearby star and a buttload of patience) flipping a bit in your computers
Instruction Pointer (usually referred to as IP except on the SPARC platform
which uses the notation PC, for Program Counter) causing it to jump to the
part of Windows that is secretly programmed in at the last second that causes
it to feel remorse for sucking so damned bad and always crashing and deleting
all your work right when you were JUST ABOUT to hit Save, no really you were,
and while wallowing in this black pit of despair and self-loathing it hits it,
hey, I know what would make the world a better place, if I was running
Winamp 3.0, and it does.
