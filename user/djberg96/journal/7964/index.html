<p>I was just reading over at <A href="http://www.wilwheaton.net">Wil Wheaton's website</A> (you know, Wesley Crusher from Star Trek: The Next Generation) about his tale of "the one that got away" and it reminded me of my own sordid tale.
<P>
I was in my final summer of graduate school, studying for my comprehensive exams while having a casual fling with one of the other grad students.  Gorgeous, too, by the way.  Anyway, it came out one day that she was "curious" and willing to entertain what is generally considered every straight man's fantasy.
<P>
But no, STUPID FUCKING ME decided that he didn't have time to futz around at the nightclub looking for a willing third partner (which wouldn't have been that difficult given some one or two of the nightclubs in the area) and that it was more important to study for my exams so that I could get a Masters Degree.  So now, rather than the experience of a lifetime, I have a worthless piece of paper that I don't even use.
<P>
Pah!</p>
