<p>I've been watching some of the Sci-Fi channel's <I>Tuesday Declassified</I> and it's been very interesting. However, I think some of the footage they're showing is fairly obviously a hoax.  Here's my measure for when a film has been faked:
<UL>
<LI>Shaky camera.  Anyone with a home video camera knows how easy it is to hold a camera still.  What are you trying to cover up?
<LI>Lack of witnesses.  So, there was a bright, flying object over the middle of the city and you're the only one who saw it?  Riiiiggghhht.
<LI>Blurry film.  It's amazing how well auto-focus works on camcorders, yet all you managed to get was this blurry, light colored object?  Riiiiggghhht.
<LI>Bizzare and/or wobbly flight patterns.  Perhaps they're teenage aliens, hopped up on Romulan ale, who have come to buzz the funny humans for kicks.  Or perhaps they haven't figured out how to balance their spacecraft.  Or perhaps you bumped your camera and you're full of shit.
<LI>The craft always hovers near a tall object, like a tree or a tower, or is always close to the ground in your picture.
</UL>
That being said, there are plenty of sitings which are pretty damn hard to explain away, including some very interesting film footage from the space missions and testimony from astronauts and pilots.  Either they're all lying or there's something out there.
<P>
Overall, I'm a believer.</p>

<h2>Overall, you're a believer...</h2>

In which?<br>
That they are all a bunch of liars, or that there is something out there?<br>
I think I might just believe in both.  There really is something out there (but <b>WAY</b> out there), which means that they are all a bunch of liars...<br>
