<p>While going through <I>Proc::ProcessTable</I> I noticed these comments by Dan Urist regarding clock tick rates.  I just used sysconf for one of my own modules that needed that info, but Mr. Urist has come up with a rather interesting alternative.
<P>
While interesting, I find this serious overkill for a module.  I don't know about you, but I'm not going to use a pre-compiled version of a module on my system.  Doesn't *everyone* just build from scratch?*  Anyway, here are his comments.  If you really want to look at the code solution, just download his module.
<P>
Thoughts anyone?
<ECODE>
/***********************************************************************
 * Some values in /proc are expressed in units of 1/HZ seconds, where HZ
 * is the kernel clock tick rate. One of these units is called a jiffy.
 * The HZ value used in the kernel may vary according to hacker desire.
 * According to Linus Torvalds, this is not true. He considers the values
 * in /proc as being in architecture-dependant units that have no relation
 * to the kernel clock tick rate. Examination of the kernel source code
 * reveals that opinion as wishful thinking.
 *
 * In any case, we need the HZ constant as used in /proc. (the real HZ value
 * may differ, but we don't care) There are several ways we could get HZ:
 *
 * 1. Include the kernel header file. If it changes, recompile this library.
 * 2. Use the sysconf() function. When HZ changes, recompile the C library!
 * 3. Ask the kernel. This is obviously correct...
 *
 * Linus Torvalds won't let us ask the kernel, because he thinks we should
 * not know the HZ value. Oh well, we don't have to listen to him.
 * Someone smuggled out the HZ value. :-)
 *
 * This code should work fine, even if Linus fixes the kernel to match his
 * stated behavior. The code only fails in case of a partial conversion.
***************************************************************************/
</ECODE>
*Hmmm...I suppose it's possible that you could recompile a kernel that ends up having a new clock tick rate, and all of your current modules that used sysconf would break (right?)
