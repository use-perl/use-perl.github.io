<p>I'm reading about XML::RPC (ok, I was reading about the *Ruby* implementation - sue me), and while I understand what it does, I'm confused by the philosophy of the whole thing.
<P>
Mainly, I don't understand the need to lump everything into one huge server that does *everything*, with predefined data classes to boot.  Seems awfully inefficient and clunky.  Reminds me of a macro-kernel approach.  Not to mention the bureaucracy that will inevitably follow to actually get a method *added* to the precious server.
<P>
My plans for an RPC module will take the micro-kernel approach;  keep the kernel (i.e. server) small and let the clients do the work.  Let the clients define the methods/objects/code references they want to use and let the server handle them as the client wishes.
<P>
I suppose security is a big issue.  But then, I've never designed a system where someone from the outside could ever get in without some other layer of security having been breached first (at which point, it would be too late anyway).
<P>
I'm really kinda excited about this.  I think my idea is *better* than SOAP in some ways.  Maybe I just don't fully comprehend SOAP.  Maybe I'm delusional.  Now, I just need some time and a flavor of *nix installed at home sometime soon.</p>

<h2>REST</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Matts/">Matts</a> on 2002-03-04T07:23:10</h3>
What you're talking about sounds a bit like the <a href="http://internet.conveyor.com/RESTwiki/moin.cgi/RestArchitecturalStyle" title="conveyor.com">REST Architectural Style</a conveyor.com>. I personally think it's a much better model for computer to computer communication than SOAP/XML-RPC, in fact I've been talking about it since way before it was even called REST (my 2001 OSCon talk about "Why SOAP Sucks", which I hope to be expanding on this year).



<h2>Interesting</h2>

Thanks for the link.  What I'm planning will be even *more* flexible than simple interface genericity (at least as I understand it).  There won't necessarily need to be an interface - the server will simply do what the client tells it to do (danger - "rm *" - danger).  You won't have to know the methods - you can *make* the methods on the fly.
<p>
I should say, there will at least be an *option* to set up the server that way.  In a secure intranet (i.e. no outside access), I don't see this as a problem.  I realize this could be a loaded gun in the hands of a child programmer, so I'll have to plan out how I want to approach the security aspect.
</p><p>
I just need some *time* to actually get started on all this, including time to play with <i>Net::Server</i> which looks like it will be a great base class.  Maybe I'll call it <i>Net::Server::RPC</i> if he'll let me.</p>
