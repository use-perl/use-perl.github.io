<h1>Win32 support</h1>

<p>I've really gotten on this Win32 kick lately.  Initially, this was brought on because I needed to make sure one of our apps would work on Win32 systems.  However, it has started to bleed into a desire to make programming as seemless as possible between *nix and Win32.
<P>
Now, ActiveState took a pretty big step when they made <B>fork()</B> available in their Perl for Win32 product (I'm not sure if they did the same for Python).  But, there's more to life than fork - etc, process info, native threads - the list goes on.
<P>
I have noticed that there's a decent selection of Win32 modules on CPAN, but I'm learning that anything that doesn't explicitly fall under the Win32:: namespace either does a poor job of supporting Win32 or doesn't support it at all.  And, of course, anything that *does* fall under the Win32:: namespace (*horror*) only works on Win32 systems.
<P>
I've been working to rectify this somewhat in Ruby, which is lacking compared to Perl and Python when it comes to Win32 support, IMHO.  However, I think all three languages (which can, naturally, more or less share source code) could use improvement in this area.  Here are some ideas I've been tossing around:
<UL>
<LI>fork() - Perl has it, but Ruby doesn't.  Not sure about Python.
<LI>setsid() - Run the program as a Service, the closest thing to a background process that Win32 has.  Not sure about privilege issues.
<LI>syslog - Win32 has the Event Log.  Is the API similar enough to make this seemless?  Again, I'm not sure about privilege problems.
<LI>etc - I've managed to get the get* side of the familiy for Ruby (hopefully it will be adopted into the core).  I imagine that Perl and Python programmers might like it added as well.
<LI>Native Thread Support - I'm not qualified to do this, or even if it's worth worrying about.  But I thought I would at least mention it.
</UL>
Well, that's all I can think of at the moment.  Oh, I should also mention that I would entirely focus on NT/2000/XP.  Win95 and Win98 users can get stuffed - they're dead and no one uses them in any sort of serious production environment anyway.  I don't want source code sullied by a bunch of #ifdef's just to make something work on Windows 95, for example.  Too much cruft to support for no gain.  Of course, the same could be said for BeOS, but hey, I actually *like* BeOS. ;)</p>

<p>I'm not quite sure what you mean by this and one of the reasons I use Perl is that my experience has been exactly the opposite - most things work well across platforms.  Certainly the big-name modules like LWP, DBI, XML::* have not given me any trouble due to Win32 issues.</p>

<p>The biggest problem I've encountered on Win32 is that I don't have a compiler so I rely on the generosity of Activestate, Randy Kobes et al to provide pre-compiled packages for modules with XS components.  I imagine they do suffer some pain getting things to compile, but the hard work has been done for the modules I use.</p>

<p>What sort of problems are you seeing?</p>

Actually, I was only referring to C extensions, not pure Perl code.  In that regard Perl, Python and Ruby are all more or less *nix-centric.
<p>
Part of the problem I think is that a lot of the hard-core C programmers won't, don't or can't program on the Win32 environment and so it ends up an afterthought.</p>
