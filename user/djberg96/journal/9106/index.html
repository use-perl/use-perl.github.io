<p>I decided to do a straight Perl to Ruby conversion of Spreadsheet::WriteExcel version .20 yesterday.  I jammed for a couple of hours, no tests, worked out the syntax errors and ..... no love.
<P> 
I did something wrong somewhere.  The file size is way off.  In other words, I threw a bomb on 1st and 10 but ended up tossing an incomplete pass.
<P> 
For my 2nd down play I decided to go with a more conservative slant right and port version .26 instead.  I can handle formats.  Formulas (formulae?) are another story.  For extra blocking power I'm pulling the left guard and doing unit tests to keep me out of trouble.
<P> 
I figured I could do unit tests by running a simple Perl script, checking the output and/or file size and then compare that against my Ruby code.  I can get away with this approach because *I know* John's code works (thanks John!).  That has also meant running lots of class methods independently that you normally wouldn't run independently (or at all).  Sometimes a lack of 'private' is a good thing.  None of those pesky errors to prevent me from doing what I want to do. :)
<P> 
So far that strategy has paid off, even if it has been slow going.  I've caught a few subtle, but significant bugs that could account for the earlier disaster.  So far the BIFFWriter and OLEWriter classes look good.  The only design change I decided on was to make OLEWriter a subclass of File, rather than store a separate filehandle within the class.</p>
