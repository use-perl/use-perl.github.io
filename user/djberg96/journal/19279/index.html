<p>Tired of certain individuals from France bemoaning  US foreign policy in the Middle East and Iraq (especially the notion that it was the US who armed Iraq), I think it's time to bemoan French policy in the Middle East (and elsewhere) for good measure.
<P>
Synopsis: France became heavily involved with Iraq in the mid 1970's (note: pre-Reagan) as a result of a meeting between Chirac and Hussein.  French oil companies received benefits and a significant share of Iraqi oil.  France sold over 20 million dollars worth of military equipment to Iraq, including Mirage fighter jets.  France had a huge trade investment in Iraq, and had billions of dollars worth of contracts.
<P>
I know Europeans love to point to US policy in South America during the Cold War, so let's not forget the French arms sales to the military regime of Argentina.  Arms that were later used to sink two British destroyers in the Falklands War (specifically, it was the Super Etendard armed with Exocet missles).
<P>
Oh, and should we even get started on the food-for-oil fiasco?
<P>
Various links.  Or, just do some research on your own and learn something.  Next week, Russia, Germany and China.

You'd love the section on international arms sales in <cite> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0679748199" title="amazon.com">Voltaire's Bastards</a amazon.com> </cite>.



<h2>Exports to Argentina</h2>

<p>Hey! Don't forget that <a href="http://www.hazegray.org/worldnav/americas/argent.htm" title="hazegray.org">Britain flogged destroyers to Argentina.</a hazegray.org>. "HMS Sheffield class/Type 42". During the Falklands conflict the Argentinians didn't sail them into the war zone, but did use them for air force training missions. Clearly this training paid off, as the first hit was HMS Sheffield. Oh, the irony. I believe that after the Falklands conflict the UK bought excocets, having seen how effective they were. The conflict also acted as a sucessful sales pitch for sea harriers.</p>

And don't forget who started Vietnam!  And the War of 1812!  And the Undeclared War in 1798 and the rest of Napoleon's wars!  And the French and Indian War!  And<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...<br> <br>Sorry, I thought I was going somewhere with this, but apparently not.
