<p>Since I've been getting into encryption lately, a buddy of mine at work and I were going to add the blowfish encryption plugin for GAIM.  Upon going to freshmeat.net I saw this:

well if your looking for blaim.. AOL has finally pressured sourceforge into terminating my account.. and since im currently without a place to live.. i cant host it here... so if theres anyone that can mirror it please email me at pharpsyde@yahoo.com</I>
<P>
AOL, you miserable swine!  That really has to make me wonder.  In fact, it makes me want to install it even more now.
<P>
<B>UPDATE:</B> This <A href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=01/06/25/2115200&mode=thread">link</A> indicates that it was pulled because of the name, not because it had anything to do with encryption.  How dumb.</p>

A Google search for "blaim.so" led me to a tarball of a slightly old-ish release. I haven't tried to play with it, but I could grab it.<p>This certainly shouldn't be considered the solution to blaim's hosting problems. I'm not sure the site owner even realizes he is sharing it...</p><p>It amazes me that both freshmeat and sourceforge made this vanish, but not without a trace thanks to Google cache. I wonder what excuse AOL used to torque these people.</p><p>

We found a slightly older version as well.  While I realize that it's a case of "our servers, our rules", one can't help but wonder *why* they would get in such a tizzy over it.
