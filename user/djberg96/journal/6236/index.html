<p>I've gotten a few more emails about <I>Net::SCP::Expect</I>.  A couple of bug reports.  One is a simple parsing error (which most people will probably never hit), the other is password-less ssh/scp.
<P>
Since I never expected people to use the module who had password-less ssh set up (I mean, the *whole point* of the module is to send a password via Expect), I never accounted for that possibility.  However, someone has pointed out that he's in a loop and some machines require passwords and some don't.  Since that's probably going to be a fairly common scenario, I'll need to deal with it now.
<P>
Ben Trott, save me!!!</p>

<p>No you don't, just learn from history: "No patch? Oh, well. Take care." &nbsp;:)</p>

<p>Seriously, if you decide you want to tackle it, I don't think it will be too hard.  Expect with undef timeout, if you get eof, the command completed without asking for a password, if you get a password prompt, send the password and then expect for eof.  Don't forget to omit any steps you might previously have taken to insist that the programmer specified a password, as it will no longer be required for all cases.</p>

<p>Or, best yet, take the person who requested the feature, point them at this journal entry, and encourage them to try their hand at writing the patch!</p>
