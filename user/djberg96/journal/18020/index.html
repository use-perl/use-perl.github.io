<p>So, out of boredom one night, I accepted an invite to join Orkut.  I finally got around to doing most of my profile, and started futzing around.
<P>
Am I missing something?  Seems pretty boring to me so far really.  I spend most of my time just clicking on the pics of the pretty women.
<P>
One interesting thing, though.  There seem to be more computer geek types in "open" relationships/marriages than I ever thought, including someone I used to hang out with here from time to time.  I never really understood that - seems odd to me.  Well, ok, when I was *in college* I understood it just fine because, hey, I wanted a girlfriend *and* I wanted to nail the girl next door without feeling guilty.  But, that's something quite different I think. :)</p>

I was bored quite fast with it too--I think the fun would have lasted a bit longer if (1) they would have simplified the interface instead of complexifying it (2) they would have provided APIs for people to use and abuse.



<h2>Not quite the right conclusion...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Elian/">Elian</a> on 2004-03-23T17:37:39</h3>
It's not that more geeks are in open relationships than you think, it's that more <i>people</i> are in open or "non-traditional" relationships than you think. You can't tell just by looking if someone's gay or bi, nor what sort of relationship they're in. Even if you meet their SO you've no idea--besides just not being a topic of general conversation (You're not likely talking about your sex life either<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) folks who're not in standard het relationships are usually more circumspect about things.<br> <br>Whether this is ultimately a good thing or bad thing is a separate question, of course.

While I agree with the general sentiment -- that relationship-style is rarely tattooed on someone's forehead -- <a href="http://www.salon.com/tech/feature/2000/05/26/free_love/index.html" title="salon.com">there are those that disagree about the first part</a salon.com>.
