<p>I actually watched the 4th quarter and overtime - one of the more exciting and interesting MNF games ever.
<P>
I can't say I agree with the leaping call at the end that allowed a second FG attempt.  While technically correct, I have to agree with Madden: the spirit of this rule is to prevent *assisted leaping*, not "run and jumps".  I predict a rules change for next season.  I also think the Colts were getting away with some blatant holds on the last drive.
<P>
Anyway, I'm glad the Sucanners lost - now my team (Green Bay) is in 2nd place, behind a surprisingly good Viking team.</p>

I turned it off when the Bucs intercepted with about 5 minutes left.  I figured that was it.:-(

I turned it on after the Sox beat the A's, what a great ending.  I hate the Colts and the Bucs, but still great.  The leaping call was correct<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... I can't say what the intent of the rule is, and I don't really care.  It's on the books, it should be called.  The only problem I have with calling the rules on the books is when they are not called consistently; as to that, I can't say.<br> <br>Speaking of the Bucs and Sox<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... Johnny Damon's first-ever concussion came in high school, when a defensive lineman named Warren Sapp knocked him senseless coming over the middle.  His second was Monday night against the A's, when his own second baseman, Damian Jackson, hit him.<br>
