<p>So, New England won the SuperBowl again, thanks in part to a dumbshit decision by Carolina to go for 2 when they didn't need to (and then not getting the points).
<P>
Coaching 101 Coach Fox: you *NEVER* go for 2 points *EXCEPT* to tie the game.  PERIOD.
<P>
In addition, whoever is responsible for the field maintenance should be shot.  That was quite possibly the worst field I have ever seen a SuperBowl played on and directly affected the course of the game.
<P>
Still, it was a good game and Vinatieri is once again a hero (sort of).</p>

Why aren't you critical of Bellichick's decision to go for 2 late in the game to gain a seven point as opposed to a six point lead?<br> <p>It didn't tie the game, it just anticipated the opponent tying the game.  Seems like a good decision to me.</p>

I should have added, "when you're down".<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)  I've seen this burn coaches *so* many times, it's not even funny.
<p>
Mind you, Carolina could have made up for the 2nd time they went for 2, but no, they blew it again.</p>

Yes, it was dumb, but so was Vinatieri missing two FGs and Tom Brady throwing an INT.  Both teams made mistakes, and even if Carolina had gone for 1 both times, NE still would have won!

<i>Yes, it was dumb, but so was Vinatieri missing two FGs</i>
<p>
I now wonder if field conditions had more to do with it than I originally thought, especially in  light of Kasay's shanked kickoff at the end.  I haven't heard any comments about it, though.
</p><p><nobr> <wbr></nobr><i>...and Tom Brady throwing an INT</i>
</p><p>
I must be a conspiracy nut, because my first thought when Tom Brady threw that pass was, "what's the line on this game again?".  It seemed a very strange pass for the likes of Tom Brady and it looked like we were headed towards a blowout.
</p><p>
<i>Both teams made mistakes, and even if Carolina had gone for 1 both times, NE still would have won!</i>
</p><p>
Maybe, but at least it would have forced an overtime.  Consider:
</p><p>
Pats --- Panthers<br>
21          10<br>
21          17*<br>
21          24*<br>
28          24<br>
28          31<br>
31          31<br>
</p><p>
* Assuming they go for 1 here and at the next TD.</p>
