<p>It's Friday Trivia Time!
<P>
There's been a bit of talk about "willing modules" here on use.perl, so I'll combine that theme with a bit of historical trivia.
<P>
For 10 Trivia Points, according to at least one historical source, to whom did Alexander the Great leave his kingdom?
<P>
No Google!  Good luck!
<P>
Update: jdavidb got it!  10 Trivia Points for jdavidb!
<P>
Answer: The Strongest</p>

<p>
Part of me wants to say "his horse", but whether that's just an awful joke, or residual bad rumors about Catherine the Great, I can't say.  (I do remember that the empire was split into four pieces, one going to each general.)

I believe you're thinking of Caligula.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

<p>To the strongest.  I believe that was in a Smallville episode (the two part season finale/opener).  I'm not sure I have the quote exactly right; it seems like it was more brazen than that.</p>

<p>And for supplementary information, the people wanted him to name a successor among his four sons.  He did not, and they later fought each other into oblivion until the empire was so weak it was a snap for the Romans to come in and mop up.  <a href="http://www.goreadthebible.com/web/daniel/8.html" title="goreadthebible.com">Prophesied ahead of time by a Jew.</a goreadthebible.com> </p>

Correct!  Although, Smallville wasn't exactly my source.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
