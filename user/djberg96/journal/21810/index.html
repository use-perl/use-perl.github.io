<p>In the past, including the very recent past, I have always used brackets for my C "if-else" conditions, even if there was only a single line within the if clause.
<ECODE>
if(some_condition){
   printf("Whatever\n");
}
</ECODE>
I guess it was just a combination of paranoia, preference, and anticipation of adding additional code within the if condition that led me to code this way.
<P>
I've had a change of heart.  This morning.  At 10:12 am to be precise.  Suddenly, it just started to annoy the crap out of me.  I realize I have to pay a little extra attention to detail by omitting the brackets, but I suddenly like the 'no-bracket' style better.
<ECODE>
if(some_condition)
   printf("Whatever\n");
</ECODE>

Don't bring that code my way!

Heh.  Well, the functions where I'm doing this are generally short.  For larger functions I'd probably be more inclined to keep the brackets.
<p>
The main problem I have with people using this style is that they don't indent or space worth a darn.  That can get real confusing, real quick.  That's probably another reason I've avoided it in the past.</p>

Just because a feature can be misused - doesn't mean it should be misused (we Perl hackers know it best of all...). The "no bracket" single statement "if" is in C for a reason - and AFAIK it is considered good style to use it. With proper indentation, the problems you may run into become blazingly obvious. In 6 years of C experience, I've never had a bug resulting from this feature.

<p>
Some day you'll be skimming code that's passed through the fingers of someone who had their tabs set to an unusual number of spaces, and something like</p><blockquote><div> <tt>&nbsp; &nbsp; if (somecondition)<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; printf("Whatever\n");<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; dosomethingelse();</tt> </div></blockquote>will go flying by. Are you sure you'll read it correctly?

I have learned to always set the "tabs to spaces" option in whatever editor I'm using.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
