<p>Since we can never rely on sys-admins for anything around here, it becomes a pain to get them to install anything.  I wouldn't even bother trying to get them to install the Oracle client software, so I decided to give DBI::Proxy a try.
<P>
After a couple minor glitches with the tnsnames.ora and sqlnet.ora file, I got it running.  Pick a port number, start the proxy server.  Then, connect from the client machine using that port as a connection, and perform queries at will.  No Oracle client software required!
<P>
That is so damned cool!  I feel like Calvin after he's been given an allowance...

I gave up asking my sysadmin to install perl modules so I install them myself in a "non-standard" dir and just do a <i>use lib</i> at the beginning of my progs.  Not that there is anything wrong with my sysadmin, it's just the whole performance you have to go through to get anything done (i.e create a trouble ticket etc...) is such a pain.
<br>
<br>I like <b>instant</b> gratification<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

Yeah, for <a href="http://dev.macperl.org/" title="macperl.org">dev.perl.org</a macperl.org> I took to installing all my opwn perl modules for the web services, and access them also via shell services (using PERL5LIB or whatever), and set up CPAN::Config to install things in the right directories, etc.  It makes it much easier.

We did manage to get a separate, generic user account on most of the machines we needed (in some cases direct login, in some cases sudo).
<p>
Given that, we decided to take it a step further and install our own local version of Perl, not just the modules, on each of the machines.  This saved us the hassle of begging for an upgrade if we wanted it, and we don't have to deal with any of the 'use lib' business - it's all under our generic user's home directory.
</p><p>
It's a little more work on our end to make sure all the machines have all the same modules, but at least *it get's done*.  Besides, I'm almost done writing a script that will automate the entire install process for each machine in a single command line statement.  I'm talking home-grown stuff as well, not just modules.</p>
