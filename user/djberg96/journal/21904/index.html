<p>While intelligent music is great, sometimes I just want to listen to something that gets the blood flowing in the morning.  Here are some (of many) that do it for me:
<UL>
<LI>Shoot to Thrill - AC/DC
<LI>Kickstart Your Heart - Motley Crue
<LI>Back in the Saddle - Aerosmith
<LI>Fight for Your Right to Party - Beastie Boys
<LI>Lit Up - Buckcherry
</UL>
Got any favorites?</p>

<h2>Adrenaline Rush</h2>

Du Hast and Kuss Mich from Rammstein are also good morning blood-pumpers.  I don't understand much of what those Germans are singing about, but the music is enough to get me going<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)

The latest Rammstein album is pretty full of tunes to wake you up. Although my personal favourites from the band are Adios and Wollt ihr das Bett in Flammen sehen?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

I'm glad you didn't mention <a href="http://herzeleid.com/en/lyrics/sehnsucht#bueck_dich" title="herzeleid.com">B&#252;ck dich</a herzeleid.com> then<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)
</p><p>
All their lyrics are <a href="http://herzeleid.com/en/lyrics" title="herzeleid.com">online</a herzeleid.com>, but I suspect that might spoil the songs if you discover what they're really about.</p>

<h2>The Hawk</h2>

I don't know how long you've been in Colorado (you are in CO aren't you?), but there used to be a radio station called "The Hawk" that played "classic rock". I think they were an independent station. This meant they could play good music, instead of the crap that you have to pay stations to play.<br> <br>Unfortunately, playing good music doesn't seem to be a viable economic model for a radio station.<br> <br>Pretty much anything they played was good for me. The music you listed was all on the play list...<br> <br>(I lived in CO for almost 20 years. 12 in the Denver metro area, 8 on the west slope.)



<h2>A Career Of It</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/chaoticset/">chaoticset</a> on 2004-11-18T16:14:17</h3>
Pretty much anything Rob Zombie writes falls into the same category, as far as I can tell.
<p>
Generally, my playlists for FPS-ing are made up of nothing but techno and hard Zombie.  Big thumbs-up for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00002DDPD/103-8255327-0816655?v=glance" title="amazon.com">American-Made Music To Strip By</a amazon.com>, which consists of remixes of Zombie tunes.</p>



<h2>My Current Four</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/vek/">vek</a> on 2004-11-18T16:32:28</h3>
I have many such songs.  My current four are:<br> <br>Nitzer Ebb - Getting Closer<br>Wumpscut - Flangegod<br>Apoptygma Bezerk - Kathy's Song (Victoria Mix)<br>Sisters Of Mercy - Lucretia My Reflection



<h2>Today's faves</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/runrig/">runrig</a> on 2004-11-19T03:41:54</h3>
I was listening to <a href="http://www.indie1031.fm/main.html" title="indie1031.fm">103.1</a indie1031.fm> again (I'm starting to feel like a shill for that station) and <a href="http://www.cookandjones.co.uk/News_latest.htm" title="cookandjones.co.uk">Steve Jones</a cookandjones.co.uk> (or even the other DJ's) always plays something that you don't hear much or never heard before that is just awesome. Today it was "Hey Grandma" by Moby Grape. And I had just missed "Shake Some Action" by the Flamin' Groovies by a few songs (though I really like their version of Louie, Louie also).
