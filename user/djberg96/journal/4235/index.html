<p>Acid trip + lesbians = <I>Mulholland Drive</I>.
<P>
<B>Warning - significant parts of movie discussed</B>
<P>
I've seen David Lynch flicks before and, while the characters are often strange, the storyline has generally managed to hold together well enough to make a coherent storyline and interesting plot.
<P>
Not so with <I>Mulholland Drive</I>.  This movie holds my interest well enough (with some effort), right up to the point where the two main characters hook up (ok, so that *really* held my interest).
<P>
However, it's immediately after that scene (about the 90 minute mark) that the movie starts to come unglued.  I had been exercising a lot of patience up to that point, and I couldn't take any more so I hit the fast forward button.  As far as I can tell, almost the entire movie up to this point has been one giant lesbian-female-masturbation fantasy, and very little of what we've seen has anything to do with reality.  I occasionally stop fast forwarding when something interesting happens (which ain't very often).
<P>
I still don't know what the blue key is for, and guess what?  I don't effing care!  This movie SUCKED!  Avoid it like the plague.</p>
