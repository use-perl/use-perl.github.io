<p>The good news is that someone provided me with *BSD support for one of my Ruby modules.  Hooray!
<P>
The bad news is that someone found a bug in my <I>Set::Array</I> module.  Boo!
<P>
The good news is that there's another person using the <I>Set::Array</I> module!  Hooray!
<P>
The bad news is that he originally posted his problem to c.l.p.modules and I didn't see it.  Boo!
<P>
The good news is that I know how to fix it.  Hooray!
<P>
The bad news is that the <I>Want</I> module *still* doesn't play nice with <I>overload</I>.  Boo!
<P>
Perhaps if *cough* I could get *cough* robin to *cough* fix that bug....</p>

I know, because I didn't report the bug and I was using the set functions(sadly not the pretty syntactic sugar) in a systems administrative script that had to do a manipulation on oodles of usernames. Set::Array was much cleaner than the idioms presented in the cookbook.

I don't know if I should be happy or afraid.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) FYI, the intersection() method is *broke*.  I made a really dumbass mistake.  Hopefully, you're not using it.
<p>
There's going to be a new release by this weekend. There are some context issues with the overloaded methods as well, but there's a good chance you never noticed them.</p>

<p>Thanks for the warning -- it is using intersection(). I guess my tests aren't good enough.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-/</p>

It may very well work, but I know how to break the algorithm, so that's why I'm warning you.
<p>
I really need to work on unit testing.</p>
