<p>I bought HOMM 4 (that's <I>Heroes of Might and Magic 4</I>) on a whim recently and gave it a whirl.  I really liked 2 and 3, so I figured I couldn't go wrong.
<P>
I was wrong about not going wrong.
<P>
Oh, sure, the graphics are very nice.  All the little animations are very sharp.  They also stress out my poor 16mb video card.  A couple of nice minor features have been added, such as a "recruit all" button, caravans, and progressive creature mustering (instead of everything once a week).  Now for the really bad news:
<P>
Sieges are a complete disaster.  I'd like to slap the programmer(s) in charge of designing this portion of the game.  You can now attack <I>through walls</I>!  Some other things are screwed up to.  In order for flying creatures to fly over the wall, they have to spend a turn adjacent to the wall (where, of course, they can now be attacked).  So far as I can tell, a human player's creatures can't fly over the wall *at all* until the gate has been destroyed, which makes no damn sense whatsoever.
<P>
Allowing heroes in combat is interesting.  I kinda like it, but in the early going they are often a liability, while in the later going they are perhaps too tough.
<P>
The siege issues didn't bug me too badly until it totally screwed me in a campaign game.  After that, I removed it from my hard drive.
<P>
Thumbs Down!</p>
