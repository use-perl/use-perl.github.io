<p>I thought I would add a nice little enhancement to my Sys-ProcTable module for the Linux version.  My plan was to add the information in /proc/xxx/environ as a hash to the ProcStat structure.  The stuff in the environ file consists of environment variables and their settings in the form of "PWD=/home/blah", etc.  Thus, if you wanted the PWD of pid 2345, you could simply do "print p.environ['PWD']".
<P>
However, parsing the environ file is proving to be a royal pain in the arse.  I got over the first hurdle of dealing with a bunch of NUL terminated strings.  I've also been able to split the string on the '=' sign and turn them into key/value pairs.  I've hit two snags (so far), however.
<P>
The first is that sometimes this file can be empty.  Right now that causes a segfault.  You can't simply stat the file either - environ files  are always size 0.  The read and fread functions can't be relied on either.  I'm going to play with lseek to see if that will work.
<P>
The second is that not all the environ files contain data in "KEY=/some/val" format.  I found one that simply contained the string "--suicide", which I thought was appropriate, since it succeeded in killing my program.  This could actually be a bigger problem.  What should I do for a case like this?  I'm thinking of just making the whole string the key, and assigning '1' as the value.
<P>
Of course, I could just be a bum and return everything as a big, ugly string for YOU to parse. :)</p>
