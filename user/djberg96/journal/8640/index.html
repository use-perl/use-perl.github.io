<p>In the last few months my right shoulder and lat muscle have become more and more sore.  I *think* it's from having my right arm extended most of the time to hold onto the mouse.<br/><br/><P><br/><br/>This started when I quit weightlifting a few months ago.  I just got lazy, but I've started going back to the gym again, hoping that working out will help strengthen that muscle enough to get rid of the soreness.<br/><br/><P><br/><br/>In the meantime, I'm trying my best to keep my arm in a comfortable position, and my hand on the keyboard more often than the mouse.</p>

<h2>Wrist cushions</h2>

  Do you use those? Three years ago I was starting to have constant pains in my right arm due to computer-induced RSI (and a very uncomfortable chair). One day I bought myself one of those cushions and have been using them almost ever since. Once in a while the pain comes back feebly, but nothing that a cigarette break won't take care of.

I was under the impression that those were for carpal tunnel.  Maybe I'll try one.  My chair is comfortable, and I've even arranged myself so that I can keep my elbow on the chair-arm when holding the mouse.
<p>
Thanks for the suggestion.</p>

  Yes, they're mostly for CTS, but the thing is that sometimes carpal hurts around the upper arm and shoulder too, sometimes up to the neck. That was the case for me: my neckside and shoulder hurt far more often than my wrist and fingers.

<h2>Whiplash injury?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jordan/">jordan</a> on 2002-10-28T16:40:31</h3>
What you are describing could be a whiplash injury.  Probably not, but worthing considering.<br> <p>Have you been involved in any auto accidents, even little fender-bender class things?<br> </p><p>Some years go, someone rear ended us at like 5 mph.  Didn't even cause any fender damage, so we didn't exchange any information with those who hit us, but my wife started experiencing shooting pains in her neck, shoulder and back.  Doctor told her it was probably a minor whiplash injury.<br> </p><p>

I was rear-ended about 4 years ago at about 15mph.  I didn't feel any unusual pain from that, so I don't think that's it.  Also, it's not really what I would call shooting pain - just general soreness.
<p>
Thanks for the tip, though.  I'm pretty sure it's just general muscle fatigue.  I can literally feel the knots in my back.  I've actually been going to a massage therapist (we have one for hire at work) to help with that, too.</p>

You wouldn't necessarily feel any pain at the time of injury.<br> <p>I'm not a Doctor, but I suspect that 4 years is a long time to start to feel symptoms.  I think my wife describes them as shooting pains alternating with an ache.  Her's finally went away after about 5 years, off and on.<br> </p><p>
