<p>In my continued attempt to avoid caffeine, I decided I needed something other than water.  I especially needed it after I accidentally swallowed some toothepaste.  Blech.
<P>
So, I bought a drink called "Sobe" (the "Wisdom" flavor, in case you're interested).  No caffeine (at least, I hope not) but a whopping 30g of carbs.  That's roughly the equivalent of 2 candy bars.  Ouch.  I guess it's back to water tomorrow. :(

<p>Gatorade and/or fruit juice.</p>

  I wouldn't go for fruit juice over a litre a day. I did that (I was never a true caffeine addict) and unless you have a <em>very</em> solid digestive system it'll play unpleasant tricks on you.

  Nothing's good as a primary drinking source apart from water. Even using a single mineral water brand over a certain dose will have side effects. The best thing imho is to change frequently between drinks that have different compositions. As far as I'm concerned I got quite used to drinking tap water after a week or two, and only go for something else when I need the sugar (that's excluding alcohol of course).

<p>Definitely not!  My suggestions were given as suggested complements to water.</p>
