<p>I left work a bit early to go see the final chapter in the trilogy.  My final verdict is "good, but won't stand up to repeated viewing".  I doubt I'll go see this movie a second time.  I can only get so much enjoyment out of watching battle scenes.</p>

I actually quite enjoyed it, much better than the other two movies.  It was scary, it was sad, it was triumphant, and it didn't just leave a lot of crap hanging with no story completion.  There was a lot of issues around honor, allegiance, destiny, and so on as well.
<p>
Recall that I've not read the books, so this is based strictly on having seen (and been bored and confused by) the first two movies.  Finally, a movie that was exciting!</p>

<em>it didn't just leave a lot of crap hanging with no story completion</em> <br> <br>Well, it was written as a single book; the publisher forced Tolkien to split it into three.  They are really not meant to be viewed/read/etc. separately.  Lack of resolution from FotR to tTT, and tTT to RotK, is a given, regardless of whether it's good or bad.<br> <br>But yeah, it would be a lot harder to deal with, not knowing the stories already.
