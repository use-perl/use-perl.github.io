<p>Ok, got a host that consistantly times out on me.  No problem.  I mean, it should just log the fact that a timeout occurred and move along, right?
<P>
Bzzt.  Thanks for playing.  Try again.
<P>
What's happening sometimes is that I'm getting a hung process somewhere.  A "netstat | grep host" reveals that several file descriptors are being used and not released, with the connection status revealed as "ESTABLISHED".  Even if it was "established" (which it wasn't), I shouldn't be seeing these.  At worst, I should get a bunch of "TIME_WAIT" that drop out after a minute or two.
<P>
I can't duplicate this in testing for some reason either.  It only seems to happen after the program has been running for a while and it only happens with this one host in particular.
<P>
Oh, and I'm pretty sure I found a bug in Perl's "getservbyname" function (at least when checking for 'ssh').  When I run it on Linux, I get 22 (as expected).  On Solaris 8, I get nothing, which forced me to manually specify the port with Net::SSH::Perl.
<P>
I've reported it via perlbug, but have no way of knowing what's happened since.  Oh, and YES, I know I have ssh and sshd running.
<P>
God, I love Unix - NOT!

Thanks for the info.  Not the friendliest interface, though.  I couldn't find my bug report so either it didn't make it or I just wasn't savvy enough to find it.
<p>
What struck me as odd was all of the obvious spam that had been sent to them.  You'd think they'd have a good spam filter set up.</p>
