<p>A couple of my co-workers are in town this week for training.  Mike brought his family with him so we all went to dinner at Red Fish (yummy Cajun) and then went to see <I>Finding Nemo</I>.
<P>
This movie is really good.  I laughed a lot, and so did most of the other people in the theatre, both kids and adults.  The star of the movie is really Dory, voiced by Ellen DeGeneres.  Unfortunately, it was a little too intense/scary for a 2 and 3 year old, so Mike and his family had to leave.  Heck, it even made *me* jump at one point.
<P>
Thumbs up, with the caveat that the minimum age for this movie is probably about 6.</p>

<h2>To scary for my 2.75 yr old as well</h2>

But he was doing okay, until the scary dentist scene. My wife figured that building an early terror of dentists was not a good idea, so we walked out.

Yeah, my wife and I went to <a href="http://vek.perlmonk.org/archives/000297.html" title="perlmonk.org">see it</a perlmonk.org> last weekend.  I thought it was really quite good.  You are <b>so</b> right about Ellen DeGeneres.

...much as I've grown a distaste for animated things in general (it would be different if I liked anime, but I don't), I keep wanting to see Pixar stuff because I want to see what kind of tech they've wheeled out this time.
<p>
_Nemo_ looks pretty sharp, considering that fish are so hard to produce realistically to begin with.
</p><p>
I'll probably get the DVD instead of seeing it in the theater, because then I can rationalize that I've got lots of behind-the-scenes stuff to play with, and I'm not just buying a kid's movie.  *grumble grumble*</p>
