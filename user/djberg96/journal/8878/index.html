<p>I spent about two hours attempting to track down a ghost last night.  I happened to notice that the priority level returned by my extension wasn't returning what 'top' was showing (or the stat file itself, for that matter), even approximately.  Top was showing a priority level of about 14-19 for mpg123, while my extension was showing 9-14.
<P>
I was like, WTF?  Am I parsing the stat file wrong?  No - a pure-C version (literally copied and pasted) works fine and I'm getting all the other data correctly.  Could it be a datatype issue?  No, I tried several just in case.
<P>
Irritated and frustrated, I went to bed and came to the conclusion, in my half-unconscious state, that the mere act of starting up the interpreter was causing the priority level to drop, as the interpreter itself now got a higher priority.  I couldn't see that with top since the program started and finished before top refreshed.
<P>
I hate it when stuff like that happens...</p>

<blockquote><div>I hate it when stuff like that happens... </div></blockquote>

<p>One of the problems of doing science - measuring something actually changes its value. Trying to minimise that change is part of the "fun".</p>
