<p>I believe it was gnat (I can't find the quote now) who said something along the lines of, "Strong typing prevents you from making mistakes you just never make".
<P>
As a followup to that, I'm posting a nice quote from Dave Thomas (of Pragmatic Programmer fame) in response to James Britt (also a nice guy) regarding strong typing.  Although Dave is talking about Ruby here, I think it applies to Perl and Python as well.

No one requires you to do this. Instead, you do this if you feel 
uncomfortable with your code. After a while, you stop feeling 
uncomfortable, and realize that all this type discussion is simply a 
red herring, and get back to writing proper code and the tests to test 
it. A few months after that, you're surprised when you realize that you 
haven't had a single type-related error.
<P>
This is simple a question of experience. When you first start out, you 
feel exposed because Ruby doesn't let you add type annotations to 
variables (I know I did). Knowing that it worked OK in Smalltalk, I 
made the conscious decision not to fight this, but instead to see how 
it worked just doing it the Ruby way. It was hard at first, and I kept 
fighting some inner demon who wanted me to add "kind_of?" calls 
everywhere. But after a while, I realized that my code was no less 
accurate than it was in Java, and that I didn't really need the type 
information. Once I overcame that fear, I suddenly realized that I 
could also get a lot of benefit from the flexibility: the realization 
that type != class, but rather that type equals capabilities was a 
revelation, and it has fundamentally changed the way I code.

<p>If only there were some way the compiler could check that for you.</p>



<h2>static typing</h2>

While I largely agree with you, I want to raise a couple<br>points:<br> <br>I find that I *do* make type errors when I use libraries<br>written by other people.<br> <br>Also, static type information helps the compiler produce<br>programs that require less RAM and run faster.<br> <br>Also also, the existence of undef in Perl (or null in Java)<br>complicates things greatly.  The ocaml option type is much<br>less error prone, in my opinion.<br> <br>Also also also, if you're interested in nice OO typing,<br>ocaml's object system subtypes according to method<br>signatures, rather than by inheritance the way C++ and Java<br>do it.<br> <br>Also also also also, ML-ish languages with type inference<br>remove most of the burden of static typing from the<br>programmer.<br>
