<p><I>Han:</I> What the?  We come outta a failed install into a missing mbr, some sort of logical  partition collision.  It's not on any of the charts.
<P>
<I>Luke:</I> What's going on?
<P>
<I>Han:</I> We followed the instructions except...no FreeBSD.
<P>
<I>Luke:</I> Whaddya mean?  Where is it?
<P>
<I>Han:</I> That's what I'm trying to tell you kid.  All the non-Windows partitions have been totally blown away.
<P>
<I>Luke:</I> What?! How?
<P>
<I>Obi Wan:</I> Destroyed...by FreeBSD.
<P>
<I>Han:</I> The entire Microsoft corporation couldn't destroy all the partitions.  It'd take more 1.44" floppies than you'd need to store Windows XP than I've...
<P>
There's another OS coming in.
<P>
<I>Luke:</I> Maybe it can tell us what happened.
<P>
<I>Obi Wan:</I> It's Windows 98.
<P>
<I>Luke:</I> It must have planned this!
<P>
<I>Obi Wan:</I> No, Windows 98 isn't smart enough for that.
<P>
<I>Han:</I> There isn't any mbr.  Where'd it come from?
<P>
<I>Luke:</I> It sure is booting in a big hurry.  If it get's to the music, we're in big trouble.
<P>
<I>Han:</I> Not if I can help it.  Chewie, load the BeOS disk and hit the reset button.
<P>
<I>Obi Wan:</I> You may as well let it boot.  It's too far gone now.
<P>
<I>Han:</I> Not for long!
<P>
<I>Luke:</I> It must have gotten lost, but should still exist on the disk.
<P>
<I>Han:</I> I don't see the partition with the BeOS install program.
<P>
<I>Luke:</I> I got a bad feeling about this...
<P>
Too sum up, somehow when the FreeBSD install locked up last night, it wiped out the two logical partitions.  That's about all I can take of FreeBSD for one lifetime.  What a miserable piece of fucking shit.  *PLONK!*</p>

I've never thought it wise to try multibooting without being prepared to fry your drives.  Whether Windows/Linux/FreeBSD whatever, it is so easy to lose everything.  Once in a while you find a lucky person who installed Linux or FreeBSD on top of Windows (or vice versa) and didn't lose data.<br> <br>I think more people get it to work by wiping the disk clean, trying the install in one direction (OS A then B, failing, than OS B then A).<br> <br>I've got FreeBSD and Windows98 running on my laptop.

Yeah, well, maybe I got greedy.  I definitely didn't get Linux and BeOS right the first time, either, though they didn't wipe out Windows at least.
<p>
As it is, there's a guy who's going to give me a login and some space on a BSD machine so I can do development there.  That's all I really need anyway, I suppose.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>
