<p>It's Friday Trivia Time!  Here's a music question for you.  I just happened to be listening to it...
<P>
For 50 Trivia Points, what song are you listening to if you hear a song that starts with these lyrics?
<P>
<I>
Standing in the middle of nowhere<BR>
Wondering how to begin<BR>
Lost between tomorrow and yesterday<BR>
Between now and then<BR>
</I>
<P>
No google.  Good luck!
<P>
<B>Answer: </B> Do It Again (The Kinks, <I>Word of Mouth</I>, 1984).  No one wins.</p>

<p>The song appears to be from 1993. The web site claims:
</p><blockquote><div>
Yeah and it [their demo] was that good idea. It took only a few months to sell the first edition. And more FISH from Marillion then ( nine months later?) decided to have some gigs in Germany with them.
</div></blockquote>
<p>Marillion? *shudder*</p>

Hey!  No google!  Besides, that's not right.
<p>
I actually just double-checked to make sure no more than one band used it.  Nope - not as far as I can tell.
</p><p>
If you've got a web reference that says otherwise, please post it.</p>

Of course I used google. I didn't want to spoil it. What's not right? <a href="http://www.teafortwo.de/t42/dreamorreality_lyrics.htm" title="teafortwo.de">Here's the source</a teafortwo.de>.

Interesting.  Actually, the song in question is prior to 1993, which would make that plagiarism if you ask me, unless they gave the band a writing credit.
