<p>Ok, I normally try to stick to Perl in my journal, but this one had to be said...
<P>
Don't worry - no spoilers.
<P>
Me and a few co-workers went to see the French film "Brotherhood of the Wolf" last night.  What an utter and total piece of self-indulgent crap.  The cinematography was pretty good, but the "slow down, speed up, slow down" trick got old after the 47th time.  The Italian prostitute is effing gorgeous, however.
<P>
But other than *that*, the movie is rife with plot holes, which is impressive considering the plot doesn't make much sense to begin with.  It's also about 30 minutes too long, with plenty of scenes that do absolutely nothing to move the movie along.  Some of the fight scenes are cool, but there are too many.  On top of that, some of the scenes start to become downright ridiculous by the movie's end, and people in the theatre actually started laughing out loud.
<P>
The four of us represent a pretty diverse group and we ALL thought it SUCKED.  Save your money.</p>

This review reminded me of <a href="http://www.penny-arcade.com/13ghosts.php3" title="penny-arcade.com">the review of 13 Ghosts</a penny-arcade.com> at Penny Arcade.

<p>Sadly, we went to see it tonight and it's the best French B-movie I've seen in a while. When we were leaving some guy yelled "I've just <i>got</i> to get that on DVD!". It shall be known as the "Brotherhood of the Cliche" henceforth. The Indian guy was hot though<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) I'll be giggling for a week.</p>

Heh - yeah, there's definitely eye candy for both men and women in this movie.
<p>
The actor who plays the Iroquois looks to me like the only guy from this movie who has a future in film.</p>
