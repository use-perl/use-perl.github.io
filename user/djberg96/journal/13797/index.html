<p>Dear Abby,
<P>
Matz is going to release 1.8 within the next few days and, quite frankly, I don't think it's ready.
<P>
Maybe some Ruby programmers will read this and be mad at me for saying so, but I gotta call it like I see it.  Tonight I was able to cause the latest preview to segfault with a relatively simple operation.  Who knows how many lurk?  I was also *SHOCKED* at how many warnings there were when it was compiled with -Wall (and no, that's not a "Larry" joke).  I wasn't expecting a release until  Christmas or so, but Matz wants to get a release out in time for Panther it seems.
<P>
I know you're always supposed to compile with -Wall, but I often didn't for a long time (except for my own pure C progs) because I was either installing software via pkgadd (which are precompiled) or I assumed that developers of major projects always built with -Wall (if not -Wall -W) so I never really worried about it too much.
<P>
My naivete' in that regard is gone.  I have entered "CC='gcc -Wall'" permanately in my .bashrc file and I always check the Makefile to make sure that it was picked up.  I've also been relentless lately not only in going back over my own C extensions and eliminating as many warnings as I can (some you can't get rid of), but also in letting other people know about warnings in *their* code (in a polite manner, I hope).
<P>
Anyway, I'll just keep submitting bug reports in the meantime.
<P>
Yours truly,
<P>
Frustrated</p>

<h2>Oh my!</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/RobertX/">RobertX</a> on 2003-07-31T13:12:19</h3>
<p>I agree with you. As much as I would <b>want</b> it released now, I would rather it be released <i>when</i> it is ready and not to make a OSX release.</p>

<p>I do wish <b>speed</b> would be a focus as well.</p>

I suspect a few others feel the same way.  Note the delay announcement from Matz.
<p>
"<i>I do wish speed would be a focus as well.</i>"
</p><p>
I agree.  I've already brought it up on the ML in the past, with benchmarks so there's not much else I can do.  There are a couple places where 1.8 is faster (especially on Windows) but overall it's slower.
</p><p>
We need to get some hardcore C hackers to come in and go over the code (especially io.c) with a fine-toothed comb.</p>

<h2>The -Wall Saga</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/schwern/">schwern</a> on 2003-08-02T02:27:45</h3>
<p>Its only been two years since we turned -Wall on in Perl.  It took a lot of work (something like 50 patches between 5.6 and 5.8) to clean it up, a few months before we knocked out most of them.  There was some bitching because a lot of the warnings weren't "real" (ie. they didn't reveal a problem) and a bit of hell to walk through WRT <a href="http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2001-05/msg01870.html" title="mpe.mpg.de">unused variables and all the #ifdefs</a mpe.mpg.de>, but in the end it was worth it for a clean build and finding a bunch of little nigling bugs.

</p><p>Its interesting to look at what building Perl <a href="http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2001-05/msg01723.html" title="mpe.mpg.de">used to look like</a mpe.mpg.de>.  All the warning squashing that went on through May and June 2001 (I'm still shocked that I was capable of that much C programming).  Also to read the discussion of <a href="http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2001-06/msg00025.html" title="mpe.mpg.de">whether or not we were ready to turn on -Wall by default.</a mpe.mpg.de>

</p><p>I think what I learned out of that was that building a C program is so noisy, most people never notice compiler warnings.  That and retrofitting -Wall onto a large, hairy C program is daunting but possible.</p>
