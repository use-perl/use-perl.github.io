<p>I recently ordered the book + PDF bundle of <a href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/ruby/index.html"</a>Programming Ruby, 2nd ed</a>.  This is a great tutorial and reference.
<P>
But, what I really want to talk about is the PDF file.  It has proved to be a great reference.  The page numbers in the index are hyperlinked, so I usually just skip to the index and click the page number and it takes me right where I need to go.
<P>
I'd like to encourage all book authors to provide this.  It's not only very convenient from a user's perspective, I think it's a good marketing tool.  Some folks may not want to shell out $50 for a new book, so you offer them a PDF at half the price.</p>

that the PDF file will make it to the internet, negating the need for anyone to buy it...

It's not impossible, but I think the authors would have legal recourse if such an event were to occur.  I suspect that social pressure from the programming community itself, rather than the threat of legal action, is what would prevent this from becoming a serious issue.
<p>
Besides, there's nothing to prevent someone from scanning the Camel into their computer, generating a PDF from that, and then slapping it on the internet.  Yet, it simply doesn't happen.</p>

You can't be that naive, can't you?<br> <br>Search for "Perl Bookshelf" on the eDonkey or Fasttrack network. You will find all versions (1.0-4.0, each of them includes the camel book). You can find _every_ o'reilly book on the net, sometimes even before amazon delivers your pre-order.<br> <br>You can find an old version (1.0) online here: http://iis1.cps.unizar.es/Oreilly/perl/<br>Its actually the first match in google if you search for "perl bookshelf".<br> <br>A newer version is here:<br>http://www.hn.edu.cn/book/Perl/Perl%20Bookshelf%20%5B3rd%20Ed%5D/Perl%20<nobr>B<wbr></nobr> ookshel f%20%5B3rd%20Ed%5D.html<br>Including "Programming Perl, 3rd Edition".<br> <br>Everything is online nowadays, there are whole communities scanning and trading every new computer book!<br>

Sad.  And, unless O'Reilly has put these in the public domain, illegal.

Actually, the PDF is custom generated for you, and has your name on every page.  If you spread it around at least they can track down where it came from.

Oh, that's right - I totally forgot.  Yeah, that's another safeguard.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
