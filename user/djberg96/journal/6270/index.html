<h1>My cat as a backup alarm clock</h1>

<div class="span8">
<p>After the ex moved out a few months back, I decided to rescue a couple of cats to keep me company.  One is an orange tabby (i.e. a Morris cat) and the other is a Russian Blue / Longhair mix of some kind.  Both are about 2.
<P>
Anyway, Charlie (the orange cat) has proven himself to be a rather effective backup alarm clock.  He has a three-stage system for when he decides that it's time for me to wake up and feed him:
<P>
<I>STAGE 1: Poke 'im in the eye</I> - Yep, he just kinda pokes my face until I open up my eyes.
<P>
<I>STAGE 2: Lick his face</I> - If the eye poke doesn't get me up, he'll lick my face.  Sometimes  he'll lick my lips or nostrils, but usually it's the eyelids.  Sometimes stage 1 and stage 2 are reversed.
<P>
<I>STAGE 3: Havoc</I> - If neither the eye-poke or face-lick strategies work, he jumps on the bookshelf and knocks stuff off one item at a time until I get up to stop him.  If I try and go back to bed, repeat.
<P>
This would be funny, except that he has a bad habit of starting this *before* my alarm clock has gone off. :-P</p>

<h2>Other strategies</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/lachoy/">lachoy</a> on 2002-07-11T04:13:50</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Whisker up the nose</li>
  <li>Biting (tiny, but still) ear and/or nose</li>
  <li>Jumping off a high furniture item to the bed (jello effect)</li>
  <li>Butt in the face</li>
</ul>

<p>A friend used to get the first quite often. He'd collect the whiskers you find around the house and every once in a while stick a whisker up the cat's nose while she was sleeping.</p>



<h2>Repeat after me...</h2>

<h2>Lucky you</h2>

Our cats are more than happy to sleep in, and often two or three of them will conspire to keep us in bed as long as they can manage. We're warm, the bed's comfy, and they're fed free-choice, so there's no reason at all for them to make us get up, and some incentive for them to keep us asleep...



<h2>They work for food</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/delegatrix/">delegatrix</a> on 2002-07-11T17:46:41</h3>
It's a cat's job to make sure his person is up for work.  Cats like routine and they want you to follow yours, too.
<p> My cat generally tries putting his nose in my face, jumping over me, standing next to the bed while purring annoyingly.
</p><p>
I generally don't mind this but I need to get him to understand the concept of 'weekend'.</p>
