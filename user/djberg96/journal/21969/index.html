<p>The furnace died last night - the blower won't kick in or something.  There might be a thermostat issue as well.  Good thing I had an extra blanket.
<P>
In addition, the gas fireplace is currently unusable.  It seems the builders put batteries in.  You're not supposed to do that unless you absolutely need to (i.e. your power goes out in the dead of winter and you need a way to start the igniter in your fireplace).  The result is that one of the batteries exploded (well, leaked) and now there's some battery acid that needs to be cleaned up.  Since they didn't tell me that they had put batteries in, it's going to be them that cleans the damn thing up.
<P>
I also have a security interview today (on behalf of someone else).  Hope she dresses warmly.
<P>
/me uses the oven as a furnace for the day.
<P>
<B>Update: </b>The igniter went bad.  Fixed.</p>
