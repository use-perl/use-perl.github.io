<p>I, like Dilbert, have an irrational desire to have the latest version of any software I own.  So, at work a while back I upgraded from TOAD 6.x to TOAD 7.4 on my WinXP Pro box.  Mistake!
<P>
This thing is really a piece of poo.  If I have a long running query and try to do *anything* else within TOAD, it hangs and crashes.  Also, the SQL parser leaves a lot to be desired and some DDL statements I've written just seem to silently fail for no apparent reason, yet they work fine in sqlplus.  It also screws up placeholders sometimes.
<P>
Oh, sure, I could select the option to thread the queries to try to avoid some of the problems, but I'm too paranoid about the "runaway query" and a call from an angry DBA.  Besides, I shouldn't have to do that.
<P>
However, I like the schema browser way too much to give it up, and that's pretty much all I'm using it for at the moment.  I shoulda stuck with 6.x.</p>

I may have once possessed that, but Microsoft beat it out of me.  I'm pretty much happy with any version of software that does something I need.

Yeah.  There's very little software that I'll update "just because."  Vim, for example, get patched daily, and rather than keep up, I just compile from CVS now and then.  Anything from OmniGroup gets fairly blindly updated.   Any kind of server or GNU utility or Win32 program, though?  Not unless it prevents me from getting pwned or sued, basically.<br> <br>Same thing works for hardware.  My workstation at work (running WinXP) is a dual P3 Xeon 933.  My boss is occasionally amazed when I pass up offers for a new dual 2GHz or whatever the new model is.  I mean... I'm running Vim and perl!

<h2>7.5 ?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/tinman/">tinman</a> on 2004-05-22T11:55:50</h3>
<p>Admittedly, I've not done much with Oracle (or TOAD) for nearly 6 months, but before I left, the old corporate was rolling out 7.5, which seemed to be the best yet of all the 7.x series thus far.
</p><p>If you do more PL/SQL development than database administration (which was the case for me), you might also like to try out AllroundAutomation's <a href="http://www.allroundautomations.nl/bodyplsqldev.html" title="allroundautomations.nl">PL/SQL developer</a allroundautomations.nl> (I begged and begged and finally got a license for it<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)
</p><p>I happen to be the counter example, obsessive checks for updates on most software I use regularly<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) Of course, it doesn't hurt to keep an older version lying around either.</p>

Hmm...either I'm blocked or the link is dead.  Oh, and it turns out I have 7.5.2, not 7.4.

<p>link worked for me.. perhaps <a href="http://www.allroundautomations.nl/plsqldev.html" title="allroundautomations.nl">this link</a allroundautomations.nl> might work ? The earlier url redirects here.
</p><p>Hmm, I just visited <a href="http://www.toadsoft.com/" title="toadsoft.com">Toadsoft</a toadsoft.com> and notice that they're upto 7.6<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) That's in line with their "new version every 6 months or so" policy. Some friends swear by <a href="http://www.quest.com/sql_navigator-portal/" title="quest.com">SQL navigator</a quest.com> too, although I think it's a bit overkill<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>
