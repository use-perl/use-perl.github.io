<p>Maybe the reason the Wachowski brothers didn't do so well with Matrix 2 and 3 is that they didn't have the script to any <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118929/">Dark City</a> sequels in front of them.

I really liked Matrix 3.  Matrix 2 was OK, but a bit muddled.  Matrix 3 was excellent.  I think people wanted The Matrix all over again and were annoyed to get something else.  That would be like wanting FotR all over again for RotK.

Actually, I had fun with both 2 and 3, but then I had zero expectations.  I think the main problem with the sequels was the W. brothers mistakenly assumed that the fight/action scenes were what people liked most about Matrix 1, when in reality it was frosting, but not cake.

Then what DID people like about Matrix 1?  I didn't see anything worth liking apart from the style and action.  I thought the story was pretty lame.
