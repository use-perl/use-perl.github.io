<p>I've been looking for a copy of "Hearts of Iron" lately and haven't had much luck.  So, today during lunch I drove into Denver looking for a CompUSA using some crappy directions from mapquest, got lost, and eventually found a store called "Supr Software" or some such thing.
<P>
Fortunately they had a copy which I promptly snatched into my hands and started loudly yelling, "my precioussss" in an attempt to get the store clerk to just let me out without paying.  No such luck, but I now have a copy in my clutches.
<P>
For those that don't know, this is a territory based (as opposed to hexagon based) WW2 grand strategy game.  It actually starts in 1936, and politics can play a large part in the way things shape up.  It's gotten rave reviews and a friend of mine has it and loves it.
<P>
One interesting thing about this game is that it uses CSV files for various configuration options, so it's easy to change and/or "fix" things as you see fit.
<P>
Time for a <I>Games::HoI</I> module. :)</p>
