<p>Ok, I was going to add OpenIDE to the list of editors for Perl.  I figured I should double-check the web site, when I discoverd that I can no longer find it.  Not only that, but it seems any and all links to it have been de-listed.
<P>
The only thing I can find are some references that I made to it in c.l.p.m.  I'm about 95% sure that I gave out the web site at some point (on more than one occasion), yet the only posts of mine that remain on the subject are the ones that <B>don't</B> contain a URL.  And since it was *someone else* who pointed it out to *me* originally, I have to wonder where that post is, too.
<P>
Now, the first result I get back is some Netbeans page, which <B>definitely</B> was not the case before.  Netbeans appears to be some sort of Java GUI, but I'm pretty sure OpenIDE was <B>not</B> Java.
<P>
So, anyone out there know what happened?
<P>
<B>UPDATE</B> - Ok, so I found it again <A href="http://open-perl-ide.sourceforge.net/">here</A>.  Still, I'm curious why a Google search revealed nothing and still wondering where the newsgroup links went.</p>

<h2>Netbeans</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/lachoy/">lachoy</a> on 2002-04-26T12:19:21</h3>
Netbeans is more of a 100% Java IDE toolkit, with most of the work to now being in the Java programming tools. But I doubt that it's what you were thinking of, since AFAIK there are no Perl plugins to the IDE.
