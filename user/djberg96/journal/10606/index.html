<p>I debated for a while about whether or not to submit a proposal to OSCON.  Dave Thomas, co-author of <I>Programming Ruby</I>, even emailed me personally to try to get me to submit my <I>Perl Idioms in Ruby</I> presentation, which I had presented at RubyConf 2002.
<P>
I decided against it, however, mainly because of money.  I already have three trips planned this year - Wisconsin, Florida and Thailand.  I also have two loans and a nearly maxed out credit card.  I'm trying to save for a house this year, so I'm saving money where I can.
<P>
My biggest disappointment is the fact that I won't be able to meet some of the fine folks here on use.perl.  Given some of my political views, perhaps I'll at least avoid a pelting by rotten vegetables. :)</p>

Don't let the strong opinions expressed on use.perl put you off. Most of the loudest use.perlers are quite polite in meatspace. And when you're in California, how can any discussion get too heavy?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)

Heh - I was just kidding.  When I go to a conference, the last thing on my mind is politics.  I think I would simply refuse to get into any sort of political debate, assuming it even came up (which I doubt).

<p>I think Joe and I even stood next to each other without fighting at YAPC, although that might have been before he knew my political views were so similar to pudge's.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)  (More than once I introduced myself there as the <i>other</i> conservative on use Perl;<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.)</p>
