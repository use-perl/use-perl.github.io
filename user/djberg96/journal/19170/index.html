<p>I've seen hail before, but it's never been larger than pebble-sized and it's never come down very hard.  Until today, that is.
<P>
Holy hell, I have never seen hail like I saw today.  It was coming down in <B>sheets</B>!  In case you're wondering what I mean by that, try to imagine a really hard rain storm.  Now imagine each raindrop replaced with little balls of ice.  Now imagine those little balls of ice range anywhere in size from pebbles to golf balls.  It almost looks like it's a hard snowstorm, but much louder and more damaging.  They were later using snowplows (!) to clear the ice off the road.
<P>
In fact, the storm did damage to the tune of about $5000 to my car.  When I left work, I discovered the rear window was smashed.  I drove almost immediately to the body shop, where we realized that the front window was cracked, and the hood, most of the left side and part of the trunk panel were dented badly.
<P>
So now I have a rental car while my car is in the shop for a couple weeks.  Ugh.
