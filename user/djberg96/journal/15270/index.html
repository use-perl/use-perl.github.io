<p>I finally got fed up with the javascript errors that I saw on some pages with IE 6 so I downloaded Firebird 0.7, and I'm using it now.
<P>
It's nice, and for the most part, I'll probably use it as my default browser.  I noticed one horrible bug, however.  When I tried to print some map directions from mapquest.com it actually caused Windows 2000 to *spontaneously reboot*.  Ack.
<P>
So, it's IE if I need to print anything, but Firebird otherwise.</p>

<h2>Worked for me</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ajt/">ajt</a> on 2003-10-18T16:19:40</h3>
<p>I found that Firebird worked fine for me with Win2K, printing worked okay too. It's a very nice browser isn't it? It looks like it eats more RAM on my system than Mozilla, but it does seem to run faster, and like you I think it's starting to get good enough to use as a default browser.</p>



<h2>Of course...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jordan/">jordan</a> on 2003-10-18T16:37:37</h3>
You realize that that's a W2K bug or perhaps a bug with the printer driver and NOT a Firebird bug, right?

If it consitently works fine with IE and other programs and consistently causes a spontaneous reboot in Firebird, can you be so sure?

<p>For practical purposes, yes, I think you're right to view it this way. But in absolute terms, if I understand you correctly, Windows spontaneously reboots when a non-priviledged program does something, which has to be an OS bug. (Where I include third party printer drivers in "OS")</p>

Agreed.  A non-priv'd program should NEVER be able to crash an OS.  We've become so used to a situation where just any program can clobber anything with Windows that this is sometimes forgotten.<br>
