<p>If there's one thing that drives me FUCKING INSANE, it's bad code examples in programming books.  It's especially bad when it's the FIRST example.
<P>
I swear I was put off C++ for life because of a bug in the first example of a C++ book, <B>by Grady Booch in its 2nd edition!</B>.
<P>
Today we can chalk up <I>Writing CGI Applications with Perl</I> into the same category.  Note to fuckheads - you forgot the &lt;html&gt; tag.
<P>
Yeah, there's probably errata online somewhere, but by the time I think to look for it, I'm already pissed off and steaming mad, thinking that *I'm* the one who's doing something wrong.</p>

<h2>Try Beginner Books</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/chromatic/">chromatic</a> on 2004-06-30T22:44:21</h3>
<p>I sometimes regret working for a publisher only because it would be ethically wrong for me to review potentially competing books.  However, last night I read a book which not only used <tt>#</tt> characters to delimit comments in a C program (with a<nobr> <wbr></nobr><tt>.cpp</tt> extension, no less), but it claimed that that's the proper comment marker for C programs.</p>

<p>No lie.</p>



<h2>Shit happens</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/petdance/">petdance</a> on 2004-07-01T13:08:52</h3>
Sometimes things slip by editors.  I sure wouldn't tag my friends and esteemed members of the community
<a href="http://www.perlguy.com/" title="perlguy.com">Meltzer</a perlguy.com> and
<a href="http://www.perl.com/pub/au/Michalski_Brent" title="perl.com">Michalski</a perl.com> as
<a href="http://petdance.com/perl/geek-culture/" title="petdance.com">"fuckheads"</a petdance.com>.



<h2>Calm down</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/KM/">KM</a> on 2004-07-01T14:00:29</h3>
First of all, being called a "fuckhead" is pretty offensive, and uncalled for. Publishers don't always seem to publish what's given to them, and it isn't the fault of the author... especially for code I have found. Missing ; here, missing tag there. The erratta for WCAwP *is* online, and the motivated reader could find it in less time it takes them to call the authors "fuckheads".<br> <br>What chromatic found in the other book is a real error, what you are whining about is an editorial mistake. Learn the difference and watch who you call names.

<p>It happens enough times in the other book (not yours!) that I'm willing to call releasing that book (not yours!) an editorial mistake.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<h2>Fuckhead #2</h2>

Haahaa.  Wow, I'd hate to have made a grammatical mistake!<br> <br>Next time I promise to be perfect, I mean, what more would anyone expect.<br> <br>Brent<br>
