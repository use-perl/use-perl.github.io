<p>Well, that POS that I bought is going back to the store this morning.  The problems began almost immediately when certain applications would run in a very jerky fashion (especially games).  Between the kruft in XP, the kruft provided by HP and Norton AV kruft, there was just too much kruft.  I tried removing Norton (a cure worse than the disease IMO), but to no avail.
<P>
So I said, "fuck it" and thought I would be smart and install Win2k on it instead.  There was something I hadn't considered though - integrated ethernet.  Win2k wouldn't even see the ethernet port.  Checking the HP site (with my laptop) I could see that there was NO driver for anything other than Windows XP.  I also tried Suse Linux 8.0 as well - no luck.
<P>
To top it all off they didn't even bother to include a Windows XP restore CD.  So, they're getting back their hardware with Suse Linux 8.0 installed.
<P>
That'll teach me to ever buy a prefabbed system again.</p>

Didn't understand what you were speaking of at first, as I took <b>POS</b> to mean "Point Of Sale". <br> Then I realized it meant "Piece of<nobr> <wbr></nobr>....", and it all became clear!



<h2>POS indeed</h2>

Most people I know who bought an HP desktop have taken them back due to major failures of some sort.  You'd think they'd learn a thing or two about building a PC from Compaq.
