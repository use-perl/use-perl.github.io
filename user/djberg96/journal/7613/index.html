<p>I have had quite a busy weekend, so here's the scoop:
<P>
I flew to Denver Friday morning to do some apartment hunting.  I found a good deal for a nice, big one bedroom apartment in southwest Lakewood.  I also spent a hefty chunk of time exploring Lakewood as well as Wheat Ridge (yuck), a bit of Arvada and a day in Golden (nice).
<P>
My original plan consisted of some online research that I did, and I had a bunch of printouts from rent.com that I planned to visit.  A few I drove by without stopping at once I actually saw them.  Some I stopped and explored when I happend to seem them from the car.  As I was driving around, it suddenly started to become more important to me to actually get a apartment *with a view*.  The one I got has a view of the mountains. :)
<P>
The rest of the time I spent walking around parks, checking out some shops and sampling the local cuisine.  I stopped and ate at a restaurant in Golden called <I>Ol' Time Bar & Grill</I>, or something like that.  I mention this not because the food was great (though it was good), but because the hostess was a total knockout.
<P>
Anway, the move-in date is set for September 28th.  I'm psyched!</p>
