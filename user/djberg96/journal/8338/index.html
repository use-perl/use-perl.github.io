<p>I normally don't remember my dreams.  At most a day or two before it starts to fade.  However, about a week ago I had one that stood out in my mind.
<P>
I was sitting on the pavement after some sort of accident.  I'm ok, so I get up and start walking nowhere in particular.  Soon, I'm jogging along a paved street, then a gravel or dirt road as the trees get more and more dense.
<P>
Soon a man I don't recognize slowly but surely begins to jog past me.  For whatever reason, I feel compelled to follow him.  He eventually leads me into a dense forest and into some sort of underground maze.  It's not long before I realize that I'm hopelessly lost.  Feeling apprehensive, I decide that my best bet is to keep following him.
<P>
"Where do this path lead?", I ask.
<P>
The man slows, turns and says, "Mercy Street".
<P>
Now, what do you think *that* means?<br/><br/></p>

Hmmm... Interesting.  I mentioned this song here in a <a href="http://use.perl.org/comments.pl?sid=8942" title="perl.org">journal comment recently</a perl.org>.  I thought maybe this <i>might</i> be where you got the reference, but actually, I got the name wrong in that reference, calling it just "Mercy", instead of the full correct title, "Mercy Street".

The thought crossed my mind that maybe I had heard the song on the radio recently but, to my knowledge, I haven't.
<p>
Maybe I should attend a London.pm meeting or something.</p>
