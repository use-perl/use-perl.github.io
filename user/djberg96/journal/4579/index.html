<p>Last night I discovered that Suse 8.0 Personal edition does not come with a C compiler!  A "which cc" followed by a root-level find revealed nothing.  I check the 3 CD's to see if there's a package somewhere - nope.
<P>
So, uh, anyone know where I can get a copy of cc for Suse Linux 8.0?</p>

<p>... did you try <tt>which gcc</tt>?  And maybe even egcs?  This may be a little akin to asking if the machine is plugged in.  But sometimes you check and you find out it isn't.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

Yeah, I tried a 'which gcc'.  I didn't try 'egcs', though I'll admit I've never heard of it.  Assuming that it's not there, what do I do then?

<p>Look around on the net for a binary gcc that'll work with SUSE.  (Maybe one for another distro will work, if you can extract it from the package and get the right libraries.)  Once you get one, get the gcc source and bootstrap compile your own so you know for sure it'll work with your setup.</p>

<p>A good place to look for a binary might be the official gcc site, but your mileage will vary.</p>

<p>You can use any gcc that'll run for bootstrapping, but the source tarball you want to compile will probably be 2.95.  2.96 is a RedHat'ism (they went out on their own and made that version number; it's not official).  3.0.x is probably all right if you don't do any C++, but I'm still letting it soak.  (You probably don't want an older gcc, but if you do, compile 2.7.x.  2.8.x has weird problems.  I was trying to install Perl and PDL on a Solaris machine with this gcc just last night and never could get it to work.)</p>

Sorry this is a bit late, but I've been moving to a new apartment closer to work, and been busy. Checking suse's website, under package lists for personal edition, I found <a href="http://www.suse.de/en/products/suse_linux/i386/packages_personal/gcc.html" title="www.suse.de">this</a www.suse.de>. It seems weird it was not installed by default.

Odd, I don't seem to recall ever being given an option to install it during the initial installation, nor was there an option to add it as a package after the fact.
<p>
Perhaps I was dozing.  Ah, well.  I'm using Mandrake 8.2 until it irrates me enough.  I've still got Suse laying around if I ever want it.</p>

Did they take out YaST? That seems odd. Yet another reason I love the ports system of BSD (Not to start a religious/flame war)<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;o)<br> <br>
