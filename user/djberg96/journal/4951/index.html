<p>I think I've mentioned this before, but I'm a World War 2 buff.  A friend of mine pointed me to <A href="http://www.battlefront.com">Battlefront.com</A> and I ordered <I>Combat Mission</I> (only available online).  It's a third person tactical sim set on the Western Front in '44 and '45.  If you are a fan of <I>Squad Leader</I> you will love this game.
<P>
The game is very realistic, and the sound effects are excellent, especially with some of the mods out there.  You can hear soldiers barking orders, sharpshooters taking shots, .50 cal machine guns, tank shells bouncing off of too-thick armor and that familiar *plonk* sound can mean only one thing - armor penetration.
<P>
Today, my friend pointed out that they're preparing to release <I>Strategic Command</I> which is a World War II grand strategy game (ok - European theatre).  I've played some grand strategy games before and none of them have panned out.  Either the naval system sucked (among other things) or the AI was so terrible there was no point in playing.  We'll see how this one does.</p>

Wow, there's a game I haven't heard of in a long, long time (about 15 years I think). I lost a lot of hours playing that game.

I don't know if it's an area you're still interested in, but if you are you won't be disappointed with <i>Combat Mission</i>.  Try it.  I'll play you online even.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

Well, hey, I didn't really focus on their economic system.  The Mannerheim Line, Molotov Cocktail's and a war where the little guy held out much, much longer than expected against the big guy thanks to favorable weather and good tactics are what I focused on.
<p>
Once upon a time I could have listed each side's manifest at the drop of a hat, but it's been a while.  Using memory only, I think the Finn's had about 150,000 infantry, maybe 2 tank divisions and about 200 aircraft (most donated from other countries) against about 500,000 infantry, 10 tank divisions and 1000 or so aircraft.  But that's a guess.
</p><p>
Both GMT and the makers of the Europa series made games on that theatre, if you're interested.</p>

<h2>what happened to....</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/tinman/">tinman</a> on 2002-05-20T08:04:22</h3>
<p>Panzer command and the MS adaptation of "A bridge too far" ? Both of those were pretty playable too (although Panzer command AI was a bit broken, IIRC)
</p><p>For a different genre of the same era, I get my thrills from the Wolfenstein series ("the return to castle Wolfenstein" was a bit overhyped and overrated though, IMHO)</p>
