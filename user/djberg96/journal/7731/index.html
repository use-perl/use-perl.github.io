<p>Because Gnome was a color pig, I decided to switch back to CDE.  Unfortunately, it looks like Gnome has permanately barfed some color settings, because even in CDE, most of the reds now look black.  Several other apps (including those with syntax highlighting) are also messed up.
<P>
As long as the colors are barfed anyway, I'm back in Gnome. :)</p>

<p>I thought the CDE colors were crap.  For that matter, I hated most of the CDE interface, too.  I installed Ximian Gnome, and the colors were still crap until I changed the color depth on my monitor.  Had to do some googling to figure that out, but things finally looked a lot better.</p>

I don't think that's it.  I mean, *when* I have color, it looks fine.  More likely it's Sun crappy video architecture and/or video cards.  I mean, name another system that bleeds all the color out of an app because you're running Netscape for crying out loud?
<p>
Sun? Hello? How long will this ridiculous behavior persist?</p>

<p>You might look into getting the XFree86 binary distribution for Solaris.  Never tried it myself.  (Please let me know, if you do.)</p>
