<p>I stopped by at the local comic shop, which is just half a block from where I live.  I haven't bought a comic in quite a long time because most of them are childish crap.  However, Neil Gaiman's <I>The Sandman</I> was definitely a standout.  It should really be considered an illustrated story, rather than a comic book - it's definitely for adults and very well written.
<P>
So, I bought Volume 1 (<I>Preludes & Nocturnes</I>), which is a collection of #1-10.  It also comes with a nifty little cdrom.  I never actually finished reading the series - I think I quit somewhere around #20, so this will be a good refresher as well as new territory for me once I get into some of the later ones.
<P>
I actually had a chance to buy #1 when it came out way back when.  Silly me.  Oh, well.  I just want it for the story anyway. :)</p>

Damnit. There was no cdrom when I bought it a few years ago. Anything interesting on it?

I haven't actually looked at it yet, but the guy at the store said it's just DC Comics promotional stuff, a catalogue, etc.

Is on my "to read" list, alongside Alan Moore's "League of Extraordinary Gentlemen".  Hopefully Jenine has bought one or t'other of those for me for Christmas<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<p>
