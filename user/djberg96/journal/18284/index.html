<div class="span8">
<p>I'm at a point in my life where I'd like to do one of two things - either start my own magazine or start my own consulting company.
<P>
Regarding the former, I thought about starting a "Ruby User's Guide", ala TPJ.  However, I don't know that Ruby by itself could survive so well.  TPJ had problems and is only quarterly.  My idea is to create a "Scripting Language Solutions" type of magazine, which would be Perl, Python, Ruby and PHP all rolled into one.  Too diverse?  I don't know, but at least I could keep it monthly that way.  Should I try to join forces with TPJ?  That's another thought.
<P>
Regarding the latter, my initial idea was a consulting company that specialized in Ruby solutions.  I figured I would focus on Solaris and /or Windows, since I've become fairly familiar with both of them over the years.  I also thought of broadening it to folks who are experts at the big scripting languages (again PPRP).
<P>
My *main* issue with both is this - I don't have a clue where to begin.  How do I get sponsors for a magazine?  How do I setup contacts for a consulting company?  How do I *sell* my idea?
<P>
Thoughts welcome. </p>

<h2>TPJ quarterly?</h2>

TPJ is now monthly... has been since being revived.  Either that, or I'm writing 3 times as many columns as necessary. {grin}

Great men think alike !
I think a magazine for scripting languages is a great idea !! Go for it<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...
