<div class="span8">
<p>The first time I really looked at the Win32 API is when I first started porting the Win32 modules from Perl and Python to Ruby.  So, I did they what they did - I wrote C extensions based on the C code I found in the Perl and Python libraries.  And it worked.
<P>
One of the things I quickly noticed, and have <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/djberg96/journal/15525">mentioned before</a>, is that there are often many ways to accomplish the same task.  Often these different approaches offer slightly different information and you run into a situation where you like approach X, but there is some tiny bit of information you would like from approach Y.  But you don't want to use approach Y.
<P>
Not too long ago I came across WMI, but I must admit that I had not looked too deeply into it.  I wish I had.  In fact, I wish I had known about WMI before I ever touched a C extension for Win32.
<P>
The fact of the matter is that any informational needs you may have about a Win32 system (remote or local) can be accomplished via WMI.  Not only that, you sometimes get much more information using WMI than the equivalent C functions, eliminating the need to pick between approach X or approach Y that I mentioned above.
<P>
To be fair to the Perl and Python folks, I think most of the Win32 interfaces were written before WMI arrived (in Windows NT SP 4 I think), and so there's not much incentive to go back and write them now.
<P>
However, I <B>am</B> going to revamp all of my ports to use WMI + OLE instead because it's easier to maintain AND it doesn't require that users download and install all the compiler stuff.  That means scrapping a lot of hard work I put into the C extensions, but I think it will be worth it in the end.  That is, until MS scraps WMI in Longhorn or something. ;)</p>
