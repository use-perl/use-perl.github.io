<p>I think I mentioned my kernel panic problems in a previous entry.  I *think* I have discovered a very strange quirk:
<P>
If I try to boot into Linux first, it hits kernel panic at the point where it tries to initialize the firewire port on my video card.  But, if I boot into *Windows* first, then restart and boot into Linux, it works.  Oh, and it has to be Windows first from a cold boot.  If I try to boot into Linux (and fail), then Windows, and back to Linux again it doesn't work.
<P>
I love computers....</p>

<h2>Sounds familiar</h2>

I have similar symptoms on my machine, just the other way round: I can't cold-boot into Windows. If I try, it takes about ten minutes (literally) and behaves very sluggishly afterwards. First I need to start Linux and stay there for a while, like starting X, the browser...till, I suspect, the machine reaches a certain temperature. I have no other explanation why I need to spend at least 30 min before I can boot Windows.<br> <br>I know the reason though: my first harddrive (the one for Win) is damaged. Under Linux I have to turn off DMA and 32bit I/O for this device, otherwise Linux will hang very soon and I need SysReq key-sequences to re-live it.<br> <br>Anyway, it'd be far more annoying if I first had to boot Windows to get Linux running so I don't care that much.

<br>
<br>
Isn't this a standard feature?

Hmm.  Your hardware knows the punishment it's about to receive, and need to be stroked before venturing into the abyss...<br> <br>
Sorry, couldn't resist<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)
