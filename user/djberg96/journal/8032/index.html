<p>I'll be offline for a few days.  Tomorrow morning the movers come and take most of my stuff.  Then it'll be clean, clean, clean the rest of the day.  They're supposed to drop it off on Monday, so only three nights on an inflatable bed.
<P>
Saturday is when I actually hit the road to Colorado.  I'm not entirely sure how long it will take me from here, but I'm guessing I'll have one long day and one short day.
<P>
I've got two major projects to work on when I get situated - my presentation for the Ruby Conference and bug fixes for <I>Net::SCP::Expect</I>, for which I got more bug reports today.  Crud.</p>

<h2>cross country drives</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ajtaylor/">ajtaylor</a> on 2002-09-27T20:34:44</h3>
I'm not sure where you're leaving from, but I drove from NC to UT in only two days. Those 14 hour days were not very fun (I was alone with the radio and a totally stuffed Plymouth Sundance), but it was worth it to get there so fast.
<p>
Also, I saw the most gorgeous sunset while headed west in eastern Colorado. I could see the rockies looming in the distance over the flat plains and EVERYTHING was a beautiful shade of purple. Best sunset EVER!
</p><p>
Unfortunately on that trip I went through the Continental Divide at night, but on the return trip - what a view! I do envy you living in CO.</p>
