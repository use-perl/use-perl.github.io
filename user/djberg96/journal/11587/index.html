<div class="span8">
<p>Some folks have been posting an article in The Guardian about an alleged massacre of some Afghan fighters by US troops.   The Guardian's source appears to be from the
<A href="http://www.wsws.org">World Socialist Web Site</A>.  In addition, you can read the <A href="http://www.wsws.org/articles/2002/jun2002/dora-j17.shtml">interview </A> with Jamie Doran, the man who created the documentary from which the story is derived.  There are plenty of other related links at the bottom of these articles.
<P>
One thing that immediately stuck out to me is that Jamie Doran admits that his sources consist soley of two ordinary Afghan soldiers and one Afghan general.  Now do you think that </I>it just might be possible</I> that this general is lying to cover his own ass?
<P>
I'm not saying it's impossible some of our troops  did this, though I certainly hope not and I certainly hope they're brought to justice if they did.  However, what seems more likely to you?  That the US troops massacred thousands of Taliban fighters or that the Northern Alliance did?  Given how the Northern Alliance and Taliban treated each other prior to our arrival, I'm betting the latter.  As Doran himself says, "I have absolutely no evidence that American troops were involved in the shooting that took place in the desert."
<P>
In the meantime, I'm going to try to find and view Doran's documentary.</p>
