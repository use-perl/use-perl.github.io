<p>That's right boys and girls, it's Trivia Time!  Since we had a Star Wars question last week, it's only fair that we have a Star Trek question this week.
<P>
In <I>Star Trek: First Contact</I>, the Borg Queen attempts to seduce Commander Data to the Borg cause.  Data later admits to Captain Picard that, for a time, he was tempted by the Borg Queen's offer.
<P>
For 75 trivia points, for *how long* does Data say that he was tempted?  Be specific.
<P>
You know the rules by now.  Answer posted Monday morning if no one gets it by then.
<P>
<B>UPDATE: Sunday, June 9, 2002</B> - We have a winner: garth* wins 75 trivia points!
<P>
*is it just garth or "Lord garth"?  - ok, so you won't get that unless you're a trekkie. :)
</p>

<p>People say First Contact was the best of the Next Generation movies.  Wouldn't you know it's the only one I've never seen?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<p>I saw the Voyager series finale for the first time this week.  It's the first time I ever saw the Borg queen.  Must say I always thought such a position was kind of foreign to the Borg concept.  Then again, I'm the guy always advocating a decentralized P2P DNS and such.  It must be ingrained into me.</p>
