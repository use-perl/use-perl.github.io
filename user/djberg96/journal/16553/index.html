<p>I just got back to work today after a nice, long vacation.  I went through the loads of emails that I got while I was away and discovered something curious.
<P>
You see, I had my Out of Office auto-reply on while I was away (normal).  I received a few pieces of spam (also normal).  What I have *never* had happen before is what I discovered in my inbox today - a spammer actually replied to my OOO assistant!  It merely said, "So what? -Alex".
<P>
Or is this some sort of automated auto-reply from the spammer?  Anyway, I thought it was odd.</p>

Did your auto-reply agent reply again, or does it notice the references and<br>in-reply-to headers?<br>



<h2>Hmm</h2>

More likely the person replying was not the spammer but an innocent third party whose address was used by the spammer.  He was probably puzzled by your autoreply, since he'd never sent you anything.

Ah, yes, I thought about that after I wrote my entry.  That's probably it.
