<p>I ended up re-installing Solaris 9 yesterday.  It was my own fault - I accidentally installed libraries that were already installed, so I ended up with two copies of the same library in two different locations.  That was ugly, so I just started over.
<P>
Mostly it's been good news.  Installing apps has been *much* easier.  Nary a warning in sight.  Even gaim installed without a hitch.  The -h option for ls, df and du is nice. I chose a different locale (iso-8859-1, btw) so I don't get those annoying text boxes at the bottom of all my windows any more.  I've only had one install fail (FXRuby), and I had the same problem under Solaris 8.  So far, it's definitely been worth it.
<P>
Definitely install the stuff on the software companion cd.  Here are a few tips I recommend to simplify  your life if you're going to upgrade:
<P>
1) Immediately modify your path to include the following directories:
<UL>
<LI>/opt/sfw/bin & lib
<LI>/usr/sfw/bin & lib
<LI>/usr/ccs/bin & lib
</UL>
2) cd /usr/ucb; mv cc cc.orig; ln -s /opt/sfw/bin/gcc cc
<P>
3) Add the 'lib' directories to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH (yeah, yeah - it's just easier this way).
<P>
4) If you're going to install the Oracle 9i software, be aware of a minor bug in the installer.  First, launch it from the command line (not a gui file manager).  When it asks you to insert CD 2, you'll need to go back to the same terminal you started the installer from, hit return a couple of times, and cd to a different directory.  Otherwise, you'll always get "device busy".
<P>
5) Don't expect Netscape 6.2.1 beta to work if you're using a proxy.  I didn't bother installing it the second time.  Besides, Sun has 6.2.3 available for download now.
<P>
Well, I guess that's it for now.  Hope it helps someone out there. :-)
