<p>What if your dreams became reality?
<P>
I saw the original version of this movie when I was a little kid.  I was very intrigued by it, but I haven't seen it in ages.  I was at the video store yesterday and I noticed that there was a remake from 2002, with James Caan and Lisa Bonet.  So, I rented it. :)
<P>
I thought this version was interesting, but not quite as gripping as the original version.  Whether or not that is due only to age difference, I'm not sure.
<P>
Anyway, I think I need to buy the book. :)</p>

<h2>The Lathe of Heaven</h2>

The author of "The Lathe of Heaven" is Ursula LeGuin.  It was originally produced for television by PBS in the '70s, starring Bruce Davison as George Orr, Margaret Avery (she would later play Shrug in "The Color Purple") as his lover, Heather, and Kevin Conway as his psychiatrist.  It was an extraordinary production for its time.  I've refused to see the Caan-Bonehead version.
