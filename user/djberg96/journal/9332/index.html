<p>I'm thinking of re-reading <I>The Peloponnesion War</I> again.  I don't know why, I just feel like it for some reason.  Maybe it has to do with Iraq.
<P>
I have a very sweet edition of the work called <I>The Landmark Thucydides</I>, which is a hardcover edition that includes lots of nice maps (so you can find those obscure cities that he mentions) and some other information not normally included in a softcover.  Solid translation, too.  If you're ever going to buy an edition of his work, this is the one you want.
<P>
Here are two quotes that I have in my "favorite quotes" file:
<P>
"Men's indignation, it seems, is more excited by legal wrong than by violent wrong; the first looks like being cheated by an equal, the second like being compelled by a superior."<BR>
- Book 1
<P>
"I know that the spirit which inspires men while they are being persuaded to make war is not always retained in action, that as circumstances change, resolutions change".<BR>
- Book 1 (from Pericles' speech)</p>
