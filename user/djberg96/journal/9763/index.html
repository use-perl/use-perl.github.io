<div class="span8">
<p>From the Department of Redundancy Department:
<P>
<I>Slurp - Slurp entire files into variables</I>
<P>
Apparently the author never bothered to even search on the word "slurp" on cpan.  If he had, he would have found <I>File::Slurp</I> which has been around for quite some time, iirc.  I don't see anything in the docs to indicate it does anything different.
<P>
Is CPAN getting to the point where we need a "redundancy avoidance committee"?</p>

It's a bit different from File::Slurp but it's got a bit of a funky interface and it's not in the File:: namespace which would be the obvious place to find it.<br> <br>I've thought of a different interface to CPAN where only certain modules are listed. The problem is that for beginners, searching for something returns a scary amount of results.<br> <br>Search results for a variety of common terms:<br> <br>CGI - 1770<br>DBI - 1431<br>MySQL - 626<br>Apache - 1682<br>XML - 1914<br>HTML - 3291<br>Template - 1091<br>Class - 5684<br>File - 8695<br> <br>This is a bit overwhelming. Wouldn't it be nice if say only 10 or of the more important modules were listed, with the rest available if you wanted?

I agree that search.cpan returns way too many results for searches.  It hasn't been a problem for me personally, so I haven't complained, but it's not very useful beyond the first page of results, really.
<p>
Anyway, I only mentioned it because some there have been some grumblings from others lately, so I thought I'd chime in.</p>

<p>It would be interesting if CPAN supported voting/recommending modules, with an option to view search results in recommendation rank order.  Or attaching comments to a module's page...</p>

<p>Or returning search results ranked in order of various automatically determined metrics, such as:</p>
<ul> <li>Number of CPAN testers failures</li>
<li>Number of regression tests. (Hell, determining if a modules has regression tests, and has more than the 1 test <code>h2xs</code> gives you for free would be a better ordering criterion than currently)</li>

<li> <a href="http://search.cpan.org/author/RCLAMP/Pod-Coverage-0.11/lib/Pod/Coverage.pm" title="cpan.org">Documentation coverage</a cpan.org> </li> </ul>

<p>This is ordering search results based on <a href="http://archive.develooper.com/cpan-workers@perl.org/msg00046.html" title="develooper.com">CPANTS</a develooper.com>, isn't it? Whatever happened to that?</p>

The folks at modules@cpan.org take care of this for The Modules List, but anyone can still upload anything they like.<br> <br>

Do end users actually use The Modules List? In particular, those most likely to need it: new(ish) users. Most people seem to just head over to search.cpan.org and search.

As a resident PerlMonk pimp I feel obliged to point to the recent <a href="http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=223106" title="perlmonks.org">module review</a perlmonks.org> of the module in question.

Ouch - tell it like it is, baby!  Naturally I checked to make sure no one bad mouthed any of <b>my</b> modules.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
<p>
Thanks for the link.  I need to visit perlmonks more often.

I think those reviews should be updated periodically.  Consider the review for <i>Spreadsheet::WriteExcel</i> which is now two years old and the primary complaint has long since been addressed.</p>
