<p>This one is for all the Bush haters out there. :)<br/><br/><blockquote>When a candidate for public office faces the voters he does not face men of sense; he faces a mob of men whose chief distinguishing mark is that they are quite incapable of weighing ideas, or even of comprehending any save the most elemental---men whose whole thinking is done in terms of emotion, and whose dominant emotion is dread of what they cannot understand. So confronted, the candidate must either bark with the pack, or count himself lost. His one aim is to disarm suspicion, to arouse confidence in his orthodoxy, to avoid challenge. If he is a man of convictions, of enthusiasm, or self-respect, it is cruelly hard...
<P>
The larger the mob, the harder the test. In small areas, before small electorates, a first rate man occasionally fights his way through, carrying even a mob with him by the force of his personality. But when the field is nationwide, and the fight must be waged chiefly at second or third hand, and the force of personality cannot so readily make itself felt, then all the odds are on the man who is, intrinsically the most devious and mediocre -- the man who can most adeptly disperse the notion that his mind is a virtual vacuum.<br/><br/>The Presidency tends, year by year, to go to such men. As democracy is perfected, the office represents, more and more closely, the inner soul of the people. We move toward a lofty ideal. On some great and glorious day the plain folks of the land will reach their hearts desire at last, and the White House will be adorned by a downright moron.

    --H.L. Mencken, The Baltimore Evening Sun, July 26, 1920 </p>

<h2>The Problem</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/pudge/">pudge</a> on 2004-11-12T00:36:04</h3>
The problem is that it is demonstrable that Bush voters, on the whole, are no dumber than Kerry voters.  According to the exit polls, you are more likely to vote Democrat if you have less than a high school education, or more than a bachelor's degree.  Everyone in between is more likely to vote Republican.<br> <br>Everyone is <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/pudge/#You_re_Clueless" title="mac.com">clueless</a mac.com>.  The attribute is evenly distributed, not just among arbitrary groups of people, but usually individuals, too.  Anyone who thinks Bush voters are dumber is evidence of this.<br> <br>But Mencken is correct, people are, on the whole, not very well-educated.  This is one of the greatest reasons we have the electoral college.  And why the Senate was not directly elected (the primary means of checks and balances in the government is supposed to be between the popularly elected House and the appointed Senate, not between the three branches checking each other, according to Madison).  But we moved to direct election 100 years ago, and states have largely binding selection of electors (meaning the electors have to vote for the candidate of the party they represent), which destroys the whole system.<br> <br>And so in the end, all the candidates talk down to the people.  Kerry lies and says Bush underfunds No Child Left Behind (the fact is that all its mandates were fully funded), to try to express the larger "truth" about Bush not being strong enough on education.  Bush lies and says Kerry voted for "higher taxes" 350 times, to try to express the larger "truth" that Kerry is for higher taxation.<br> <br>And around and around we go.<br>
