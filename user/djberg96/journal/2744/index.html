<p>In my quest to learn Perl one thing I wish I would have done sooner is learn how to use the debugger.  No, not that command-line crap that unix fanatics use.  I'm talking about ptkdb.
<P>
These past couple of days, I've been working with a colleague who is more of a sys-admin than a Perl guy, but we're collaborating on a project and he needed to continue the portion of code that I had completed.  The problem was that I was returning a complex data structure and he was having a hard time visualizing it.  The result was that he was getting very confused with hash references.
<P>
That's where ptkdb came to the rescue.  By putting a watch on the hash structure, he was able to see just how things were laid out.  If he was still unsure, he could try to put a watch on a specific variable in the already-populated hash to make sure he was dereferencing correctly, rather than floundering about with print statements and constant restarts.
<P>
The only advantage to the command line debugger that I've seen is in dealing with any program that forks, where you can send the output of each child to a different terminal.  The ptkdb app seems to flake out with fork calls.
<P>
In events completely unrelated to Perl, we had to put down the girlfriend's 19 year-old cat on Thursday.  She hadn't been eating well for weeks, slowly but surely losing weight, despite our trying many different kinds of food, and a couple different medicines.  We came home Thursday to find that the cat had seemingly lost control of her bowels a little bit, yet was too tired to even do much about it.
<P>
It was very quick - an overdose of an anesthetic, the vet said.  The girlfriend was crushed - losing the cat she had loved since she was 8 was very, very hard on her.  Heck, it was hard on me, too.  I stayed with her for the whole thing, and reassured her that it was definitely the right thing to do.
<P>
It's been a little weird since then.  Not having a cat to greet us when we get home is strange.  It's too quiet.
