<p>My cats came home today after being declawed (front only).  I didn't want to do it, but the furniture was starting to take a beating (even with a scratching post) and I just couldn't put up with it any more.  They're quite tender today.
<P>
I didn't want to do it, really.  Charlie, the male, really should be an outdoor cat and when (if?) I buy a house someday I'll let him run around to his heart's content.  I would have liked to have let him keep his claws for the outdoors, but it's going to be another year or so before I can buy a house.  Ah, well.  We had three declawed females who ran around outside for years and it didn't seem to deter them much I suppose.</p>

The cats already think you're a monster for neutering them.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)
