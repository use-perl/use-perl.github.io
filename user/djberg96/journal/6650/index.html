<p>I got an email late last night that said my mom had broken her wrist.  She did a real number on it, as a cast wasn't good enough.  She now has to wear a fixator for eight weeks.  For those that don't know, that means she has screws drilled into her wrist that extend outside her skin and are held in place by an exoskeleton of sorts.
<P>
The worst part of all this, however, is that she's going to miss her 40 year high school reunion which she has been *so* looking forward to.  I knew she'd be very upset about that.  Fortunately, one of her old classmates passed through town and stopped by, so she got that at least.
<P>
I called her as soon as I got home today.  She was better than last night and quite clearly drugged up on painkillers.
