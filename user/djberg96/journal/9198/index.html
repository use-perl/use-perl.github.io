<p>With all the entries I've read about people having hardware problems with their iBook, I'm now convinced more than ever that I won't be buying one.  Seems like every week I read a journal entry about someone sending in their iBook for repairs of one sort or another.  One can only imagine how many others there are.
<P>
In other news, Phoenix for BeOS is nice.  I heard they're changing the name due to some trademark issue.  How lame.</p>

<h2>Bad iBooks?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ziggy/">ziggy</a> on 2002-11-28T18:58:36</h3>
How many people have been having trouble with iBooks here on useperl?  The only two I know of are me and Matts.  Pudge had some problems this summer with his PowerBook.  brian's G3 powerbook is getting rather long in the tooth, and after about 3 years, I'd expect any computer to start having some kind of hardware failure.
<p>
Seems to me that there are a lot more people here (and elsewhere) that are also quite happy with their iBooks and have nothing bad to say about them.  No repairs necessary or anything.
</p><p>
Even with all of the trouble I've had, it's been a pleasure to own.  I'd buy another in a heartbeat.</p>

<p>My ibook was on the brink earlier this year, but it must be remembered that it is a refurbished machine.</p>

<p>Oh, wait, it was on the brink again last week, but I think that was from static electric shock, and fsck got it fixed.</p>

<h2>iBook, TiBook</h2>

It's nice hardware, and OS X does a lot of things well.  (I'm visiting my parents this week.  My brother and sister-in-law are also here.)  Internet connection sharing was as easy as clicking two buttons in System Preferences.  Granted, I know how to share a connection from Linux, but having never done it in OS X, it was tremendously easy.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, I'm a little disappointed that Linux and XFree86 don't yet support the ATI Radeon Mobility 9000 video card in this beast, and that the nifty metal exterior reduces the wireless range.  Still, I'm pleased.

<h2>Others</h2>

In addition to you and Matts, I've seen journal entries from gav, jdavidb and garth about their ibooks being at the repair shop.
<p>
But, it's probable that reading your journal entries (and Matts') has led to that (mis?)conception.</p>



<h2>nope</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/gav/">gav</a> on 2002-11-30T16:33:25</h3>
Mine isn't in the repair shop it's on my lap as I'm watching tv and enjoying wireless internet access<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
<p>
The only real problems I've had are a couple of niggly software issues which reminds me that I should probably update my journal...</p>
