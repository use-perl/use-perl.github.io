<p>Microsquish is <a href="http://lists.wxwindows.org/cgi-bin/ezmlm-cgi?5:mss:42943:200402:ennjfiogkccphebpmcfc">at it again</a>, this time forcing wxWindows to change its name to something else.
<P>
I looked at the list of possible alternatives, but none of them stand out.  I was thinking of "wxCandle" (pronounced wicks-candle).  Of those listed, I think I'm partial to wxTools.</p>

This makes me so angry! It's not as if wxWindows is even competition to Microsoft, as it's a toolkit to run on top of, yes, even Windows. Who's next, X-Windows?
<p>Anyway, as for a name... I'd go for just "WX".</p>

Fortunately, there is no such thing as X-Windows. You may be thinking of what is properly called the X Window System, sometimes X11, and sometimes just X.

They should fight it. MS was just handed a ruling that "Windows" is generic. wxWindows has been around long enough that MS cannot win the case.

<p>Easy to say. Takes money to do. They have been discussing this since last year, and are resigned to changing the name.</p>
<p>I wonder what I'll have to start calling those clear glass things on the side of my house<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<p>That's been thought of, but they want something googleable (is that a word?), and 'WX' by itself is too weather related, so a software toolkit might be lost in the results.</p>
<p>My feeling (and so far it's just a feeling, not a serious opinion) is that we ought to stop calling those rectangular areas on the screen 'windows' and start calling them something else, maybe frames or panels or panes, and then call it wxOurNewWordForThoseThings. Also take out all options in all apps to create a "New Window" and create a "New --Whatever--" instead.</p>
