<p>Yet <a href="http://msn.foxsports.com/story/3211080">more evidence</a> baseball is dead.  What a joke.  MLB is a fucking disgrace, and so are its players.
<P>
<B>Update:</B> It looks like John McCain is <a href="http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2004/baseball/mlb/12/04/bc.bbo.mccain.steroids.ap/index.html?cnn=yes">getting involved</a>.  Man, if only McCain would have won the 2000 primary.  Him and Feingold are my two favorite senators.</p>

<h2>Disgrace</h2>

That puts baseball right up there with the NBA now.  I'm pretty thoroughly disgusted with both right now, and since the hockey lockout began, I'm pretty fed up with them too.<br> <br>Thank goodness we still have college and semi-professional sports.  While they still have their problems, they are enjoyable to watch and don't suffer from quite the same level of corruption as professional sports (well, the BCS rankings aside).  And what problems there are haven't been too much of a distraction from the enjoyment of them.

It's not the players, it is SOME of the players, and the union.<br> <br>Most of the players do not use steroids, and most of them want to have much tougher rules about it, because they know this makes them look bad.<br> <br>And McCain has no business in this, though I don't mind him putting a little pressure on the union in this way.<br>

<i>Most of the players do not use steroids...</i>
<p>
Every article I've read, be it based on insiders, players or coaches, puts the estimate at about 50% for steroids, and over 75% for stimulants (amphetamines, etc).  As for HGH, I couldn't say but any use is too much, and probably dangerous.

I'll bet the pitchers are all for it.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
</p><p><nobr> <wbr></nobr><i>...because they know this makes them look bad.</i>
</p><p>
If that were true, why has the Player's Union opposed this kind of drug testing for so long? (haven't they?)
</p><p>
<i>And McCain has no business in this, though I don't mind him putting a little pressure on the union in this way.</i>
</p><p>
I think he's doing it merely as a form of public pressure.  I don't think he actually believes he could get legislation through.  Mostly I think he's annoyed with the trickle down effect it seems to be having in college and high school sports.</p>

<em>Every article I've read, be it based on insiders, players or coaches, puts the estimate at about 50% for steroids, and over 75% for stimulants (amphetamines, etc).</em> <br> <br>I've seen estimates vary from well below 10% to well above 75%, for any drug use.  In baseball, I suspect the lower figures are most accurate.<br> <br> <em>If that were true, why has the Player's Union opposed this kind of drug testing for so long?</em> <br> <br>Because they oppose anything that takes away from players.  There is a lot of disunion on this issue in the membership of the union.<br> <br>
