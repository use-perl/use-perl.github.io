<p>I've already gotten another email about Net::SCP::Expect (seems I've hit a nerve with this module).  I knew that I needed to add better error checking.  I was just hoping I would get to it before someone gave me grief about it.  Oops -too late.
<P>
Ah, well.  My own fault.  I've figured out how to do the error checking easily enough.  However, a possible bug was reported with regards to OpenSSH.  I don't have it at work, so I installed it at home (I already had it but sshd was mysteriously missing).  Unfortunately, I don't have a test machine to connect to and I can't seem to connect back to my own machine, which is odd.  Is sshd running? Check.  IP in hosts.allow file? Check.  Password correct?  Check.  Hmmm....
<P>
Well, anyway, I suspect it might have something to do with PAM, but we'll see.  He mentioned that it worked in the debugger, but not when run at the command line - something that has happened to   me as well.  Curious.
<P>
Look for .03 real soon now. :)</p>
