<div class="span8">
<p>I was just reading through Phil Crow's <A href="http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2003/06/13/design1.html">Perl Design Patterns</a>, but I had a question about one of the topics he discusses - iterators.
<P>
He first shows a (clunky) example of a Java iterator, then goes on to compare that against a foreach loop, iterating over the keys of a hash.  However, then he goes on to say:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
In Perl 6 it will even be possible to return a list that expands lazily, so the above [code] will be more efficient than it is now.  In Perl 5, the keys list is built completely when I call <i>keys</i>.  In the future, the keys list will be built on demand, saving memory in most cases, and time in cases where the loop ends early.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
But doesn't Perl 5 violate the "one at a time" definition?  I mean, you're not iterating over one element at a time.  You're slurping a list, and THEN iterating over that list.  This distinction can be important if, for example, you're retrieving a million rows out of a database.  That million-element array is now in memory, instead of being fed to you one element at a time.
<P>
I also think he's railing on OO a bit by using Java (and statically typed languages in general), and its overly verbose syntax, as his whipping boy.  Consider an equivalent Ruby example...
<P>
<ECODE>
hash.each{ |k,v|
   puts "#{k}\t#{v}"
}
</ECODE>
...and suddenly iterators within OO don't seem so stupid</p>

<h2>keys is not the iterator</h2>

<p>In this example, <code>keys</code> is not the iterator; <code>foreach</code> is.  <code>each</code> is a hash's iterator.</p>

<h3><a href="/user/djberg96/">djberg96</a> on 2003-06-20T23:14:49</h3>
Right, I understand that.  What I mean is that the keys operation happens first and THEN foreach iterates over ALL the values returned by keys, rather than one at a time.

<h3><a href="/user/malte/">malte</a> on 2003-06-21T11:00:07</h3>
<p>I think you are right. Perl 5 really lacks a good syntax for iterating over data structures (that are not lists, arrays). Perhabs the best way is to overload the diamond operator to work on any data structure.</p>

<p>Iteration with <code>while</code> in Perl can be nice, but it really only works for data structures that can't include values which Perl considers false. As soon as you get to <code>while(defined(...))</code> Perl is clunky, too.</p>

<p>Perl 6 will probably get it right, but if we're fair the next version of Java (1.5) will also introduce a foreach loop that does the right thing for collections.</p>

<h2>Arrays are special</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Juerd/">Juerd</a> on 2003-06-21T00:43:51</h3>
<p>Arrays are special with foreach. They're not slurped, but iterated one by one. You could tie an array to each and iterate over the hash keys without slurping. But then, a simple while loop would be easier<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<p>To get a lazy list in Perl 5, simply tie. You can have an infinite list and iterate over it using foreach, as long as you implement the list as an array.</p> <blockquote><div> <tt>package OneToInf;<br># Assumes sequential contiguous access<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br>sub TIEARRAY { bless \(my $foo = 0) }<br>sub FETCHSIZE { ${+shift} + 1 }<br>sub FETCH { ${+shift}++ }<br> <br>package main;<br>tie my @array, 'OneToInf';<br>foreach (@array) {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; print "$_\n";<br>}</tt> </div></blockquote>
