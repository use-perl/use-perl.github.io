<div class="span8">
<p>I woke up at 3am to discover that I had some moderate abdominal pain.  I figured, "well, maybe the Italian food is getting revenge.".  After I do my business, I think everything will be better.
<P>
It isn't.
<P>
I try laying down again and it doesn't take long for me to start feeling the pain again, only now I'm realizing that it's more in the kidney area than my stomach - both sides.  That can't be good.
<P>
So, I go sit in the bathroom again, thinking maybe I'm just suffering through some bad food.  I sit there for a while, drink some Pepto, and finally go back to bed after I started to nod off while sitting on the toilet.  I finally get to sleep, laying like a board on the bed.
<P>
I'm writing all this in case I keel over tomorrow.  At least there will be a record.
<P>
Seriously, I felt a little better this morning, but I still have pain in the kidney area and still generally feel like poo.  I decided that perhaps I had been overdoing the soda-pop as of late (which is generally high in sodium, by the way), so I stuck to strictly water and had a small lunch.  I felt cold most of the day, though perhaps that was caffeine withdrawal.
<P>
My worst fear is that this is somehow related to my surgery last October (I had a testicular biopsy done - turned out to be a cyst, not cancer).  For anyone out there who has had a hernia operation, I had a similar surgery.  I'm feeling little aches and pains down in the groin area in general that I suspect are surgery related.
<P>
Now I have this paranoid fear that my body is going to go into some kind of septic shock.  I heard several people, who had minor stuff done like knee surgery, died from septic shock in the last couple of years.
<P>
I'm hoping it'll be gone by tomorrow.  If not, on Wednesday morning I'll be making a trip to the emergency room. :(</p>

Mate, I was following along feeling bad for you and then you <b>had</b> to throw in the testicular biopsy.  That's scarily close to being more information than we needed to know<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

Sorry - the whole entry probably falls under "Too much information".  I wasn't trying to be gross or anything.
<p>
Actually, I'm going to leave work early today and go to the urgent care clinic.  I felt better at first, but now I'm starting to feel like crud again.
</p><p>
Of course, maybe I just have the flu.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:|</p>
