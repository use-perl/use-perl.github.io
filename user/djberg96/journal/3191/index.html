<p>Isn't it funny how you progress as a programmer?  I often look at code I wrote a year ago, or even six months ago, and say to myself, "What was I thinking here?" or, "Why didn't I do it *this* way?".  I guess that's a good thing - it means I'm getting better as I go (I hope).
<P>
Today I learned how to dup a filehandle (specifically STDOUT, STDIN, STDERR).  Laugh all you want, I just never needed or wanted to do it until now.  I mean, I've open'ed up STDOUT to /dev/null plenty of times, but today I finally got fed up with debug output going to the log file instead of the screen and decided to do something about it.  Worked like a charm.  Easy, too.  I suspect there are lots of *easy* things that I've just never had the need or desire to test or try.
<P>
Last night I woke up again in the middle of the night and decided to kill some time by reading a bit of "C++ Primer Plus", published by The Waite Groupe.  Now, it's been a long time since I looked at C++, but as I read over it I realized a few things:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Without ever really writing a true C++ program, I could still follow the code easily.
<LI>I don't like C++ syntax
<LI>I don't know that I could ever go back to a strongly typed language unless my livelihood absolutely depended on it.
</UL></p>

<h2>Thoughts, Progressions</h2>

I get the same feeling.  It's an ugly thing in a way, looking at something you were (possibly) proud of such a short time ago and thinking of how hideous it is.
<p>
In another way, of course, it's a good sign.  Means you're picking up on things naturally that you hadn't noticed before.
</p><p>
As for the typing thing...it bothers me that German has gender-specific pronouns.  Does it bother me so much I can't understand German?  Nope.  Am I still going to learn it, even though it feels vastly inferior to English?  Sure.  It's got its good points.  (Anybody want to tell me them, please, go right ahead...<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)  )
</p><p>
Could be worse.  Had you never written that code, you probably wouldn't be at the point where you can realize it's not great code.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>
