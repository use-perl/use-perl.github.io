<div class="span8">
<p>Well, it took 7 years, but I finally found a use for "goto" outside of BASIC.  In my particular case, it was within a Ruby C extension.  I wanted to create 'tail -f' functionality for monitoring the Windows event log.  It makes sense when you take blocks into consideration.  To wit:
<pre>
e = EventLog.open("Application")<br/><br/>e.tail{ |rec|
   puts "Record added to log"
   p rec
}
</pre>
The tail method sits in an infinite loop (which is accomplished with the 'goto'), yielding a (custom) struct every time a record is written to the event log.
<P>
On a stranger note, the Windows function NotifyChangeEventLog() can only detect a maximum of one change every five seconds.  That means, even if 20 records were written to the event log in under 5 seconds, that block would only pick up the first one.  No, there's no way around it.</p>

You aren't showing the code where you felt it necessary to use a goto, so I cannot judge its validity.  I suspect that it isn't needed though.<p>

For the record, I know of exactly two necessary uses of goto in Perl.</p>

First of all that is written in C, not Ruby.  There are a number of situations where you need a goto in C that you wouldn't in Perl or Ruby because of the availability of named loop control.<br> <br>Secondly I don't see why you aren't using while to get the infinite loop rather than goto.<br> <br>Thirdly you can save some lines by not always using braces.  For instance:<blockquote><div> <tt>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; if(rb_block_given_p())<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;rbBlock = rb_block_proc();<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; else<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;rb_raise(cEventLogError,"block missing for notify_change()");</tt> </div></blockquote>

<i>First of all that is written in C, not Ruby.</i>
<p>
I said is was a C extension for Ruby.  I showed you the frontend.  The C code above is the backend.
</p><p>

</p><p>
I suppose I could have done while(1) or something.  It just didn't feel right.

I hate that, sorry.</p>

1, 3.  Fair points.<p>

About the second.  I'd suggest re-reading <a href="http://www.acm.org/classics/oct95/" title="acm.org">Go To Statement Considered Harmful</a acm.org>.  The fact that your indentation and control structures are in conflict makes your program's flow of control harder to understand upon first reading.  Even if you aesthetically prefer a goto to an infinite while loop, I'd suggest that you indent from the label to the goto so that that section jumps out at the maintainer.</p>
