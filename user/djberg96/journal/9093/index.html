<p>It's Friday Trivia Time!  I've have this M.A. in Classical History, see, and I need to put it to good use, so here it goes.
<P>
For 25 Trivia Points, what was the name of Alexander the Great's horse?
<P>
No google.  Good luck!
<P>
<B>UPDATE:</B> Points awarded as follows:<P>
jmcnamara: 20 points (-5 for bad spelling)<BR>
jhi: 15 points (probably knew it, but only confirmed after answer posted)<BR>
ajtaylor: -5 points (unsportsmanlike conduct)
<P>
Regarding the veracity that Alexander's horse was indeed named <I>Bucephalus</I>, see Arrian, <I>The Campaigns of Alexander</I>, book 5, or Plutarch's <I>Life of Alexander</I>.  I had never heard it doubted before.<br/><br/></p>

According to the <a href="http://www.akhalteke.net/web/domat.nsf/5abe13a9c284b300c1256b960051a825/dc34aebe6c2b739b412564ea0061fc8e!OpenDocument" title="akhalteke.net">Akhal-Teke Network</a akhalteke.net> Alexander the Great defeated the Parthians in the 4th century BC on an Akhal-Teke named Bucephalus. But, according to this poster this name is <a href="http://www.greenspun.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg.tcl?msg_id=007ohI" title="greenspun.com">a  myth</a greenspun.com>.
<p>
But my favorite quote is "Alexander was a great conqueror. He killed many people because he was stubborn and greedy. He led Greece through many wars." from what appears to be an <a href="http://www.fcps.k12.va.us/DeerParkES/kids/ancientgrks/Alexgreat/" title="k12.va.us">Elementary School</a k12.va.us></p>

A more detailed history on Alexander's horse is on the <a href="http://faq.macedonia.org/history/buke.html" title="macedonia.org">macedonia.org</a macedonia.org> site.

Not very sportsmanlike to post the reply here publicly for everybody to see.  I knew the answer anyway, and I counterquiz by asking from what country did Alexander's wife come from?<br>

Wasn't she Persian? If she is, wasn't she some how connected to Darius? Off to google to check I guess.

My hint is that her name was Roxanne.<br>Hey, maybe I should start having my own quiz...<br>

Well, I suppose that case could be made. So please accept my apologies. I swear that others have done what I did, but I will refrain in the future.
<p>
But, if you are submitting your answer you would only see my answer AFTER posting. I assumed that a valid guess would be made before looking at the replies if you were interested. Therefore my answer would not be a spoiler for the true contestant.</p>

The only way to reply is with a comment.  People will probably read the comments first to see if someone has already used their guess, in which case they wouldn't bother.
<p>
To answer you question, others have posted links to the answers, but not the answers themselves.  In any case, it's all it good fun.  Hope you didn't take your "penalty" too seriously.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-P</p>

A phonetic spelling of a half remembered name: Busopholes.
