<p>I'm sorry to see that pudge deleted his journal entry.  I don't think I saw all of the responses, but it was already starting to take a nasty turn for the worse so I can only imagine where it went.
<P>
Probably for the best, though, because we all know that cats rule anyway. :)
<P>
<B>Update from djberg96</B>: <P><I>Dang it Charlie, how did you get ahold of my use.perl password?  Oh, and don't even *try* and blame Squeaker.  She's way too mello to pull a stunt like this!  And where did you learn to type anyway?
<P>
Sorry about that last line there, folks.  While the programmer's away...</I></p>

And I only just woke up, which means I missed the whole thing. *And* I deleted the emails my automated fetcher sent, so I didn't even have my email copies =(<br> <br>Ah well. That's use.perl =)<br>



<h2>Cats</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/pudge/">pudge</a> on 2002-08-20T23:01:39</h3>
I love cats.  I have two of them, and had five different cats growing up (that I remember; we had more when I was younger), to one dog (well, plus one more dog that I don't remember).  But while dog has a master-servant relationship with man (or master-companion?  I think Frodo-Sam is a good way to describe it<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-), cat and man are more like peers<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:D

<p>Unlike most Americans, I know the face of my enemy. I've been living with <a href="http://www.taskboy.com/img/jjohn_xmas.gif" title="taskboy.com">him for 11 years</a taskboy.com>. The
torn furniture, the fuzzed clothing and the soiled carpets have become so commonplace to me that I'm numb to ever new atrocity. I've tried arming myself with water pistols, but he destroyed my munitions. Besides, the violence only escalated. In this war, there is no capituational -- only domination. WHY CAN'T I BRING MY CAT TO THE NEGOTIATING TABLE?</p>
