<p>For the next minor release of my spreadsheet port, I've decided to add in the write_row and write_col methods, even though those methods weren't added until later in John's original code.
<P>
I work regularly with fetching rows out of a database and slapping the results into a spreadsheet.  I imagine a hefty chunk of <I>Spreadsheet::WriteExcel</I> users do the same - witness <I>Spreadsheet::WriteExcel::FromDB</I>.  The ability to simply insert a fetch'ed row is just too handy (versus writing your own code to iterate over a fetch'ed record).  Based on John's comments in his CHANGES file, I'm guessing people will appreciate it.</p>

<i>For the next minor release of my spreadsheet port, I've decided to add in the write_row and write_col methods, even though those methods weren't added until later in John's original code.
</i>
<p>
The reason that I omitted write_row() and write_col() methods from <a href="http://freshmeat.net/projects/writeexcel/" title="freshmeat.net">Spreadsheet::WriteExcel</a freshmeat.net> for so long was because I thought that it was a relatively simple matter to create these functions externally.
</p><p>
Any time that I spend implementing, testing and  documenting a feature like this means less time spent implementing a feature that the end user can't implement themselves.
</p><p>
However, after a lot of very similar emails I relented and implemented them and I have to admit that I actually find them very useful. For instance here is a very short idomatic program to convert a text file to an Excel file:</p><blockquote><div> <tt>&nbsp; &nbsp; #!/usr/bin/perl -w<br> <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; use strict;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; use Spreadsheet::WriteExcel;<br> <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; my $workbook&nbsp; = Spreadsheet::WriteExcel-&gt;new('file.xls');<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; my $worksheet = $workbook-&gt;addworksheet();<br> <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; open TXT, "file.txt" or die "Couldn't open file: $!";<br> <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; $worksheet-&gt;write($.-1, 0, [split]) while &lt;TXT&gt;;</tt> </div></blockquote> <p>
There are some other features, such as support for "A1" notation, that I should have put in earlier. I think that I would have if I was still using Spreadsheet::WriteExcel or Excel on a daily basis. However, I'm not, despite the fact that I write the module on a daily basis.
</p><p>
In the end there is a lot to be said for <a href="http://www.tuxedo.org/user/esr/jargon/html/entry/dogfood.html" title="tuxedo.org">eating your own dog food</a tuxedo.org>.
<br></p>

<p>
I thought about working on that sooner, but I never use it and never had a desire to.  Frankly, I don't understand why anyone on the programmer's side of things would want to use that notation, unless it's some sort of conceptualization issue.  Maybe I'm missing something.
</p><p>
In any case, I'll resist adding that feature until I receive a few requests, at least.</p>
