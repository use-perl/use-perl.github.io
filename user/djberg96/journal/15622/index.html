<div class="span8">
<p>I tried to build a 64-bit Perl (5.8.2) today, but had no luck.  I read through the README.solaris doc, tried futzing with the Makefile, double checked my PATH, ld, etc.
<P>
It chokes with an ELFCLASS error at some point during make, so it must be linking against a 32 bit lib somewhere, but I'm not sure where.  Also, I rebuilt bdb as 64 bit, as Perl seemed to be a bit overzealous when it came to buiding against it.  However, that didn't solve my problem, so that wasn't it.
<P>
Anyway, I've submitted an RT ticket (4317) if anyone's interested in investigating.
<P>
<B>Update:</B>
Resubmitted to perlbug as ticket #24439.</p>

<p>I am interested in the problem being fixed. However the fact that there is a CPAN RT queue is an accident, and about to get fixed. RT ticket (4317) will be closed, and is likely to be inaccessible soon - <b>please re-report this bug to perlbug@perl.org</b> (This is partly me saying "To retain my sanity I must dictate the rules", and partly because the CPAN and perl RT systems are separate, so it's not practical to punt tickets across to the correct queue on the perl.org RT system) I am <b>not</b> going to do this for you.</p>

Oh, so there's a bug in RT.  I should submit bug reports to RT, *except* for core Perl.  Funny, that's not in the FM, so here's an <b>FU</b> right back at you.

You don't understand what is going on.  You shouldn't be so rash when you don't understand something.
<p>
The fact that the perl distribution has an RT queue in CPAN's RT system is an accident.  It makes things confusing, as demonstrated by you.
</p><p>
perl development has its own RT queue over at perl.org.  You should use it.  Using it is easy, and is detailed very simply in the INSTALL file.

The fact that perlbug@perl.org is a gateway for RT, and that a user doesn't need to know that, is a Good Thing, a feature.  The FM doesn't need to say that.
<p>

Finally, two things.  Thanks for the kind words about my new kid, and please, please don't yell at Nicholas.  He's been working hard to get 5.8.2 out, he's done nothing wrong.

Who's yelling?  I knew about RT.  I thought reporting bugs to RT was an acceptable alternative to perlbug.  There was no reason for me, or anyone, to think otherwise.
<p>
It's not an acceptable alternative apparently (though why not, I'm not sure) and there's a bug.  How does that deserve an RTFM?   I get real hot real quick when people swear at me, especially when the real issue is a bug in the software and not what I would consider a mistake.
</p><p>
Nicholas has ruined my morning.  I am now pissed off and will probably be pissed off for the rest of the day all because I foolishly dared to try to build a 64 bit Perl, just for the heck of it.

You can call it somebody else's problem if you like, but you have to consider something important.  We don't owe you anything.  The Perl 5 Porters is not some company trying to please all its customers in every way.  We're just trying to help you get what you want because the one thing we have in common is a desire to get things right.<br> <br>Interestingly, p5p has nothing to do with CPAN, perl.org has nothing to do with cpan.org.  But whatever.  I'm just sad that you can't see we're trying to help you get what you want.<br> <br>Relax and learn to work with the system, and read the documentation, it's there to help.<br>

Now you're putting words in my mouth Casey.  I never demanded anything.  You don't see me demanding that the RT bug be fixed - I'm just pointing out that it's not something I can solve, nor could I have known about it in advance.  You don't see me demanding that someone solve my 64 bit dilemma.  It was just a bug report for something I was toying with.  Nothing more, nothing less. In response, I've basically been called stupid and sworn at.</p>

Refresh my memory pudge - what does the "F" stand for again?  I take the acronym literally.  The "nice" way of saying this is just "RTM".

But, as I said, most people don't consider "RTFM" to be swearing.  Fine, you do, and it is unfortunate that it was said, and that you took it badly.  But you can't assume Nicholas meant it as you took it: to do so is to put thoughts into his head, just as you chastised Casey for putting words into your mouth.

Even if you had went to rt.perl.org instead of rt.cpan.org, there is still a very good reason why  perlbug is still the preferred method : perlbug is not only a mailto script, it also includes informations about your environment, OS, compiler version, Configure arguments etc. Some of these informations are then processed by RT's mail gateway so keywords are automatically attached to the tickets. Then, bugs can be sorted by severity, perl version number, type (core/module), etc. And the guys who fix the bugs and apply the patches in their free time are more likely to pick up good and complete tickets than to try to figure out what's missing in half-empty reports.
