<p>The latest "security update" from Microsquish has broken Morpheus under Win2k pro.  It's possible the WS2_32.dll file was corrupted, so I'll try and replace it, but I'm not holding out much hope.
<P>
The latest ATI driver has broken my TV app.  I can get picture, but no sound.  Under 98, I get sound, but everyone sounds like they're on helium.
<P>
I went out and bought a 7200 rpm, 40 GB drive today.  I'm sick of not having enough space with my 12 GB drive.  This will also let me have the four different operating systems I want - Windows 2000, Windows 98, Linux and BeOS.  Maybe I'll even make a small partition for Atheos and see how I like that OS.  Plus, it'll be a little faster, with the better access time.
<P>
I finally rented <I>Memento</I> today.  I really liked it.  Creative and original.</p>

I think I might be one of the few people on the planet that didn't actually like it.  I finally watched it after some peer pressure - "oh you <b>must</b> watch Memento, it's really good".  It certainly <b>was</b> original <b>and</b> creative and Guy Pearce was good although he usually is.

So what didn't you like? Only the hype? =)

Yep, probably the hype actually.  On second thoughts I think I jumped the gun by saying I didn't like it.  It was ok, but just ok, nothing more, nothing less...
