<p><p>I need to write a book/doctrine/policy/manifesto called "<b>90% Savings
Through Open Source</b>" subtitled "Systematically Giving 10% of 
what We save 
by using open source software is Good for The Company" or something like
that. For years we've been using open source software instead of Microsoft
products (for example) on dozens of servers, and that saves us money. 
A lot of money.
It saves us money
thanks to the hard work of thousands of developers world wide who have
<b>given</b> the fruits of the labor to the world to use, gratis. It is in
our best interest, as a company, to support these efforts so we continue 
to save money. Therefore, systematically giving (errr... paying) 10% 
of what we've saved every time we 
choose an open source solution over a commercial one is in our best
interest.
</p><p>
Turning that notion into corporate policy strikes me as a tough sell.
One immediate
problem: companies don't <b>give</b> resources to anyone, ever*. 
They <b>pay</b> for goods
and services. As a strict rule,
if organization X doesn't demand payment Y under direct threat of denial of
services then they're not getting it.
Further the arguments [1] if we don't give 10% we'll probably still get
everything for free and [2] to whom would the money go? are quite 
understandable, especially from executives who don't know or care how 
open source functions in the universe, but who do clearly understand that free
means they don't have to pay money.
</p><p>
* Yes, companies do engage in charity, but what I'm striving for
here is a corporate policy that will support open source on a per-project
ongoing basis, not some impossible to retroactively justify annual "tithing."
</p><p>
Solutions to the problems above? [1] If our choices were MS-Windows ($300)
or Linux Distro X ($30), The Company would gladly send $30 to Linux Distro
X any day. The problem in the real world is that a Linux Distro X organization
needs to invoice us for $30 or we won't pay. That's quite a dilemma since
that's not how the universe currently operates. And even when it does operate
like that (RedHat, SuSE) it only does so for OSs, not for smaller things
like ODBC drivers for $30/seat vs Perl/DBI for $3/seat. [2] We need some
sort of "savings grid"?:
</p>

                          We would have paid         90% savings

   Operating system       MS  $300  ?                SuSE    $30
                                                     or GNU  $30  ?
   Database               IBM Informix $40000/yr     mySQL   $4000/yr
   Application framework  IBM Websphere $20000       Apache  $500
                                                     Perl Foundation $1500

So, dear executive, I can implement that project for you for $X or $Y. Oh,
you prefer $Y? OK, I'll have those companies invoice us... Uhh...
How do I do that? On I micro scale how do I get $5/seat 
to Simon for 
<a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/user/sgtatham/putty/">PuTTY</a>
if Simon doesn't demand $5 through a shareware license? How do we keep open
source free to try, but still encourage The Company to support Simon's
development of PuTTY if Simon doesn't demand that we do so? There should
be some sort of "invoice us" switch we can throw when we are saving 90%
thanks to open source project X. (... Then the question is what, exactly, are
they invoicing us for?)
</p><p>
How can I institutionalize the support of open source software? <b>Seeking your comments!</b>

Find or create a company that will invoice on behalf of a large number of Open Source authors / foundations if they have registered. Encourage people such as yourself to buy your products from them at the price you specify.<br><br>You'd have to have a lot of Open Source community involvement to pull it off to avoid people taking credit (and money) for the work of others.



<h2>use.perl store?</h2>

John Macdonald wrote to me:<br/><br/>What comes to my mind in response is having a "use.perl store"
run by TPF.  Select items would be available for sale at the 10%
of comparable commercial product cost price.  In exchange,
TPF would arrange to have a site that managed support
issues - bug tracking, feature request status, assistance.
This would require that they have the involvement of the auther
or someone of suitable capability.  The support would not be
free, more like a consulting job, but it would be easily found
and available.  (In our local perl monger meeting last night,
one person was looking to develop commercial support for a
particular project that has lots of commercial use already.
I've suggested that he get in contact with you, and also he
is getting in tough with TPF.

Hi John. Perhaps you're right. Maybe some sort of sourceforge-esque billing system would help.
<p>
The more I think about this it occurs to me that while I love the "free software" mentality and ethics I think shareware for commercial use is the actual way to go. Leave the software unpolluted: allow full download and full functionality for free, but have a shareware statement that demands $30 or $3 or $300 or whatever for commercial use of the software. That way I'd still be free to install product X to see if I like it or not, but then if I decide I do like it and we're going to use it in production then I can justify sending money to the author: "for us to use this legally I HAVE TO send $30 to X". Problem solved?
</p><p>
I'm sad to think I'm an advocate of shareware as opposed to "free software"...??</p>
