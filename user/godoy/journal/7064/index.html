<p>It annoys me a lot.<br/><br/>I'm trying to edit the URL field and can't do that. There's this $#$@#"!@# bug in something basic at Mozilla's (Netscape's) code that makes the program gets lost.<br/><br/>Some tricks were minimizing the windows, changing tabs, double clicking the title bar, etc. but none of them worked. <br/><br/>The solution? Close the program and start it again.<br/><br/>

<h2>you might want to try the nightly builds</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/wickline/">wickline</a> on 2002-08-13T02:16:00</h3>
I've been using the mozilla nightly build since around M17 and I too saw that bug. It annoyed me quite a bit.<br> <br>I haven't seen it in recent months, but I couldn't tell you if it was a problem with my profile (which I've re-constructed a few times in the course of checking on bugs) or just a bug which has since been fixed.<br> <br>There are a number of "mozilla bugs" which are actually artifacts of old long-fixed bugs. The old bug caused some irregularity in an rdf or other profile file, and then the old bug gets fixed, but the browser is still reading in the garbage profile after you update your browser. So, you get buggy behavior.<br> <br>If using the nightly builds is an option for you, I'd grab one and re-build your profile. The problem should vanish. It's a major pain to re-build a profile, so you'd have to decide whether it's worth the effort for you. If you don't like nightly builds, you might want to wait for 1.1 which is supposed to be out in the next couple of weeks.<br> <br>Another alternative would be to back up your profile, find a set of circumstances which always shows the bug, then relauch mozilla with a file missing from your profile each time. See which file you can remove to get the bug to go away. Then start figuring out which part of that file is foobar. Then if you're feeling *real* ambitious (and looking to kill some serious time), start figuring out how to get mozilla to gracefully work around (and fix) profiles with that sort of glitch.<br> <br>-matt



<h2>Another solution...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/godoy/">godoy</a> on 2002-08-20T11:46:04</h3>
Another solution I've just found out is clicking into an xterm (probably any other application) and then typing something (and deleting it, if you want) then coming back to Mozilla/Galeon/etc.<br> <br>It's much better than closing everything.
