<p><p>I was a little ill on Thursday night... I was feeling cold, even though we had a <b>very</b> hot day. I couldn't sleep nor do anything at the computer. I moved to the other room, thinking that there might be some air current in here, but it didn't help. 

<p>I got to sleep, finally, but on Friday night I went to my grandparents house. There I slept fine. I just came back today, at 2h50 pm (it's 20h50pm now). I slept at the sofa :o))

<p>The first thing I did when I got here was phone Ãâ°rica (Kika ;o)) and tell her how much I am missing her. We were going to meet on Jan 19th, but it won't be possible anymore... :-( I'll see her only on Jan 24th, when she'll arrive for the holiday and the weekend. 

<p>I can't wait 'til February, when we'll travel in the Carnival to FlorianÃÂ³polis. She'll be on vacations and will spend 15 days here, I'll be on vacation from work, but I'll be having classes at University. Fortunately, my classes are concentrated in the afternoon, so I'll be able to spend the whole morning with her (and will lunch together). 

<p>I am completely in love with this girl... I call her "my little girl" (she's 1.79m tall :o) but I'm somewhat bigger ;o)). 

<p>Well, it's time to go back and catch up with the world... I was in a wonderful land this weekend: no computers, no stress, no nothing. Just me, my grandparents, my book, cable TV. :o))</p>
