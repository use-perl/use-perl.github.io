<p>I'm discussing with some lawyers on a mailing list and they are saying that the way it is now, GPL is not legal here. It goes against our consumer protection code, in the very least.<br/><br/>One of these lawyers was seeking for example of GPL programs that are sold out there. Do you know any? I don't know an example of a program where the author has released it under a free license (not only GPL &mdash; and free as defined at the <a href='http://www.opensource.org/docs/definition.php'>Open Source Initiative</a>) and sells the program (even though other might distribute it for free).  <br/><br/>One of the problems with GPL is that if you sell GPLed software here, you won't be exempt of liabilities in case of problems or damages. Another problem is that if another people sells your software without collecting the legal tributes, you might be legally obligated to pay them... <br/><br/>It won't affect foreign developers, of course, but it affects brazilian developers. <br/><br/>There are IP (intelectual property) problems too, but we haven't got into all those details...<br/><br/>One thing that interest me is: where is the GPL license valid and where it is legally invalid? Have you ever stopped and asked yourself if you are really protected with your software license?<br/><br/>Weird, isn't it? <br/><br/>I have a meeting with our company's future lawyer on Friday and this is something I need finding out specially for some new software I'm writing &mdash; I want it to be free.
