<p>I'm creating several RPM packages for Conectiva Linux that contains Perl modules. While doing that, I was thinking that we could have something like binary builds of every module for every platform. <br/><br/>It would require a lot of storage space, but as a 'cluster', each CPAN contributor could store packages for it's own platform. The biggest could store for the most common platforms.<br/><br/>The point is: users don't know how to compile things. Giving them packages (hence binary files) is much better than modules (i.e. source files). <br/><br/>It would make Perl more accessible to people that today uses PHP (that has a lot of functions in its core, while even for DB access Perl has to load modules). <br/><br/>bcm, on #modperl again, said that having means to make mod_perl configurable on a per user basis would also make it more accessible to ISPs.<br/><br/>While it doesn't happens, I'll keep on making packages for Conectiva Linux... I hope they also get built on Alpha, PPC and S/390, besides x86.</p>

<h2>The problem with mod_perl...</h2>

...is that it does more, but less, than PHP.
<br>
<br>This is a good thing, but it does mean that configuration and preparation is more complicated.
<br>
<br>PHP is a content handler. mod_perl plugs in <b>everywhere</b>.
<br>
<br>Heck, there's not really a comparison to be made between the two, since you have to have Mason, Template or Embperl configured in mod_perl before you get PHP-style code/HTML integration.
<br>
<br>mod_perl just does so much more it's not feasible to have it compete with PHP. They're too dissimilar.
<br> <br>The 'completeness' of the PHP core (for lack of a better word) is a problem in the event of it being updated. The sysadmin has to go and recompile/install PHP. With mod_perl, if you've got a PHP-like Mason/embperl/template system set up, the user can just use an autohandler to add their own lib directory with newer DBI, or whatever, libraries.
<br>
<br>The sysadmin would only need to get involved were mod_perl itself require upgrading. The users could probably live without using their own mod_perl handlers.
<br>
<br>And they'd have a consistent name space =)

Since I've written much less PHP than mod_perl, I'm not able to talk about both on the same level...
<br>
<br>I don't disagree with you on the mod_perl more generic approach. In fact, it is both one of its strengths and failures.
<br>
<br>The whole point is to make things easier to be accessed. If mod_perl is so much better than PHP, why we have difficulties finding out ISPs that support it?
<br>
<br>The main problem, IMHO, is still the way modules are disposed. If the admin of a mod_perl site could upgrade mod_perl and all modules that depended on it simultaneously, it would be much easier! Now, imagine if I use some module in a specific version that works with mod_perl 1.25 and stops with 1.26 and my admin updates mod_perl? My application stops until I upgrade the module by myself.
<br>
<br>OTOH, I can write light applications with mod_perl, since it's clean and not bloated in features. I have only what I need, no more no less.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:o)

I'd say ISPs don't support it because it's too damn difficult for them to set up effectively.
<br>
<br>For raw mod_perl use, developers have to modify the httpd.conf. And get it right.
<br>
<br>It should be possible for them to set up a Mason/Embperl option though.
<br>
<br>And for the average shmoe, badly writing a PHP page is just as good as badly writing a Mason/Embperl page.
<br>
<br>To the admin, the PHP is easier and faster to setup.
