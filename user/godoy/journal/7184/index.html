<p>Being a business man and the techie is not easy. You have to handle some situations with lots of patience (even though you'd like to say to your customer to go to hell). <br/><br/>Today I went to a customer just to mount a floppy and copy a file. The guy told me he had done that and that it failed. <br/><br/>The problem was that it happened with the firewall configuration, and he had no firewall nor internet connection (no masquerading for his intranet). Due to some default rules, I couldn't SSH into the machine to see how things were. <br/><br/>
I hate when things like that happens. People have no good will and they don't try helping you to help them.<br/><br/>
If I wasn't the owner of the company, I'd send him to hell right at the moment when I looked at the rulesets and saw that this was not the file I've sent him.</p>
