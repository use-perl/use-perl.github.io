<p>Crisis everywhere.<br/><br/>War, bombs, economical problems, lay offs. Again, I think that some of these things are so far away from my reality that I don't even know how I would react to them.<br/><br/>I'm worried with gnat's situation... He's desperate now as I was a while ago. In fact, there's still the risk. We already know that next month there will be more lay offs here. We are all mute about that. Waiting. Hearing. Willing that it ends as soon as possible. <br/><br/>And we've known that for two months now. <br/><br/>I hope I 'survive'. We have jokes here... the Highlander kind of joke: there will be only one.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Argentina is fighting its crisis. Though we brazilians and argentinians aren't friends, I hope they get over it fast. Brazil is helping them with medical aid and also political aid.<br/><br/>And, in the other side of the world -- both to the North and to the East -- there's the war in Afeganistan. I've read on my mobile messages that U.S. has more than 4K men there...<br/><br/>And there was a plane from India(?) that was shot down today. Two countries with nuke bombs and both say they'd use that if needed.<br/><br/>
Please, could someone stop the world? I want to step down. I'll take the next one that passes by.<br/><br/>
Thank you.</p>
