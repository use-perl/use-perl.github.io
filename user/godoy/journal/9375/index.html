<p>I had an interview with a head hunter today. (You should see how nice I'm looking with this suit :-))<br/><br/>It's interesting but expensive. I think I'll pay to see what are the companies that had selected my resume. They work only with big companies and the salaries are interesting. </p>

A headhunter that wants money from you? Run away. Don't walk. This is <em>so</em> unethical.

Isn't it usual for them to bill both sides: the company who is hiring and the executive who's being hired? I thought so.

Maybe it's different in the US, but in the UK it's considered unethical for recruitment consultants to take money from the person they're placing. After all, they're going to take some huge fraction of your first year's salary from whoever employs you. And there's the ethical issue of 'if they're getting income from prospective employees, where's their incentive to actually place them in a job? Salesmen cost money after all...'<br> <br>But, the US is not the UK, so I could be talking out of my hat. Have you checked ask the headhunter or whatever it's called?

I'm in Brazil, not the US.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br> <br>I've asked her and she told me that's the way they do with all their candidates.<br> <br>They are billing me a fraction from my 2 first months of salary too (20% from each).<br> <br>In the end, I've declined the offer. I can't dispose of the money now and the guarantees were minimum.<br> <br>Thanks for your advice<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)
