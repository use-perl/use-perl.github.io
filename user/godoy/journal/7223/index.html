<em>13 years old boy has putten a knife in another boy's chest (how to say that in English? "put a knife in somebody's body").</em>
<p>
"put a knife in" is the right way to say it.  The word for it is <em>stabbed</em>, though, in case you were actually looking for the specific action word.
</p><p>
And as for where it ends...it might never end.  Human history is full of horrors, and the present is just as full.</p>

Yes! Stab is the action I was lookinf for. I couldn't get any translator to do the translation from pt to en. The reverse works fine on all of them. <br> <br>Thanks!<br> <br>And, with regards to human history, I agree with you, but it seems that we're becoming what we were centuries ago: savages.
