 <li>Bordeaux --- Very nice city. Friendly people. Living there might be nice. Or not. It depends on what you're going to do...</li>
 <li>Paris --- Very fast visit. I didn't like the people... Sorry for who lives there, but you have to agree with me that people are not all that friendly.</li>
 <li>Wilhelmshaven --- VERY beautiful city. Very small. In the North Sea, in Germany. I want to live there --- if there are jobs with computers (fortunately Internet helps a lot here) :-)</li>
 <li>Toulouse --- Nice city in France, again. I could live there too. :-)</li>
 <li>Sergovia --- In Spain. Interesting old city. Small. Friendly people. Very beautiful girls.</li>
 <li>Madrid --- Very good. VERY hot. I could live there with air conditioning. Everywhere. It was 40 celsius degrees on Friday. I love cold places...</li>
</ul><br/><br/>These are the cities I've been at, in those two weeks in Europe. France, Spain and Germany. I need to go back soon, since there are lots of other countries and cities to visit.<br/><br/>Germany was exactly how I imagined. France was messier. Spain hotter.</p>

<h2>Good looking Spanish people</h2>

<p>
I was in Jerez de la Frontera for a week (commuting back and forth to Rota) and I noticed that Spanish women (and the men, for that matter) were almost all attractive.  Everyone dressed nicely - slacks and a collared shirt were normal.  I was probably the only guy wearing jeans in the city.  Almost all the men wore sunglasses.
</p><p>
I don't think I saw an ugly person under 50.  It was really sort of...eerie.  I mean, how can *everyone* be good looking?!
</p><p>
Anyway, after that visit, I would definitely consider Spain as a place to live.</p>

Comments from my friend: "Where are the ugly people?" --- in both, Wilhelmshaven (Germany) and Spain. <br> <br>If it wasn't too hot, living in Madrid --- or Sergovia, which is 1h far from Madrid, by car --- is something that should definitively be considered. <br> <br>With regards to clothes, I was like the other people there: wearing bermudas.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br> <br>It's incredible. But, I think that girls here where I live in Brazil still are prettier<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-) (come on, I have to have something good here!)<br> <br>
