<p>I'm pissed off with one developer.<br/><br/>I've explained him five times the problem. I've sent information required to repeat the bug exactly as it happens. I've sent command lines, configuration files, etc. in the bug report.<br/><br/>And the #$@##!@# guy keeps insisting that nothing happens. I've sent, again, the output of the program running WITH the problem happening (it's a console application). <br/><br/>I hope he now sees it and stop saying there's no problem at all...<br/><br/>This is the second or third from a series of bugs that I've reported this weekend for him.<br/><br/>
I've sent other bug reports to another developer. The testing team replied that there was no problem and this was the program expected behaviour. The developer answered that he'd like to have means to repeat my configuration and see the bug. So, I conclude that this was NOT the expected behaviour.<br/><br/>Man! How hard is to get things working the way they should be (or the way the docs say it should be)!<br/><br/>
Please, if you are a developer, when you receive a bug report, cut & paste what the reporter sent you. Do not try adapting it or changing things to make them happen in your system. <br/><br/>If you can't repeat the exact conditions, maybe the reporter is kind enough to give you an account so you can see it there where the problem happens --- of course, your account will be removed ASAP and you won't abuse the system. <br/><br/>
This is one of the biggest problems on *nix systems: getting the user to send all the information, being able to repeat the exact conditions the user has, being friendly to the bug reporter.<br/><br/>You developed the system and you know more than anyone else what is happening and why. No one wants to question that. Please, be friend and don't be stupid. People doing bug reports are trying to help.</p>
