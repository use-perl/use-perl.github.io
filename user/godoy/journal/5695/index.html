<p>It was Valentine's Day here in .br on June 12th. Since Ãâ°rica is still living in SÃÂ£o Paulo, we're going to meet only on my birthday, at my mother's house, on June 22nd. It gave us some time to buy gifts. <br/><br/>She bought me some shirts and I went yesterday and today after something for her. The key question is: why the @$%#@!#$""&% do the shopping centers and malls only have clothes? All other gifts were house gifts. I don't know how her apartment will look like, yet, to buy something for her. <br/><br/>Yesterday we --- my brother also had to buy something for his girl --- walked 5 hours after something interesting. He was willing to buy some clothes to her. I told him that buying clothes for a woman when she's not near is a big mistake. Fortunately, he heard me.<br/><br/>This morning we went to a hippie fair. It happens every sunday here and there are always interesting things. We decided to make our own gifts. We bought boxes, wood boxes. Then, I bought some flowers --- artificial, made of silk ---, and put tuem inside the box. Later, I bought a little doll. A porcelain doll. And then, I bought some cloth to put between the box and the other gifts.  Of course, there's also the beautiful card, where I'm going to write something and the poem I'll write. <br/><br/>I hope she likes it. It was fun buying all this. It was fun walking 7 hours and thinking how much easier it would be if she was with me... :-)
