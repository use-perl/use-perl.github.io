<p>It's very interesting seeing the way software communities behave. The BR FreeBSD community is "a little" too aggressive. The international community is more receptive. <br/><br/>It may be &mdash; and in fact I believe it is &mdash; related to their maturity and acceptation in the market.<br/><br/>Here both Linux and FreeBSD users are always fighting for more visibility. There are lots of lazy users/admins that always want recipes for their jobs but that find it an abuse of my part if I send them the correct man pages to solve <b>their</b> problem.<br/><br/>In the international community I suppose these people are a little more ashamed &mdash; they know what they are doing is laziness, but they don't want other people to say how lazy they are &mdash; and avoid asking such questions.<br/><br/>Of course it happens from time to time, but I really see it in a more restrict way.<br/><br/>It also happens in programming language groups. More frequently when comparing two languages such as Perl and PHP or Python. :-)<br/><br/>In another post (I'm sorry, I don't remember which one, I read it last night and I was really tired) someone said (darobin?) the we should share ideas with such communities, specially the Python one. I agree. But we should preserve our identity. <br/><br/>A programming language is almost a personal taste these days. They solve the same problem with different idioms. Anyway, this is subject for a different post.
