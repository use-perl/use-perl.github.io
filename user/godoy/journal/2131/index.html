<p>There used to be a time when all we had to have to work was at one place: the office. <br/><br/>Time passed and now, all we have to work is still in one place: the Net.<br/><br/>I'm confortable at home, after working in the morning and going to university in the afternoon. Now I'm working, again. I have to accomplish that 40h/week schedule.<br/><br/>You see... 40h at work + 36h studying = 76h/week completely occupied. If you take a week as 7days * 24h = so you have 168h. I have already used 76 of these, so there's 92 left. I use 14h to eat (all meals!) every week, so I have 78 left. I have to take at least one shower every day... Let's say that's another 1h, I have 77h left. Do you drive to get from one place to the other? I do. I'm lucky they're near... Let's say I spend 2h a week to go from home->work->university->home. I have 75h left. Do you sleep? I do (at least I used to...). So, there's 7days*8h (56h) less. There are 19h a week... I need to buy food. 2h a week at the market (includes driving to it too). There are, then, 17h. I'll stop here... I've already gotten to the point: a day has 24h. I don't even have all the Sunday free to rest!!! And, of course, I need to study, so forget about these 17h free a week. <br/><br/>
Now, back to work... :-(<br/><br/></p>

<h2>Sunday is still available</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jmm/">jmm</a> on 2002-01-29T15:05:16</h3>
Unless your definition of keeping Sunday as a day of rest precludes sleeping (you can't sleep on a day of rest???) then the 17 hours is sufficient to cover all of the waking hours on Sunday and leave you an hour to use somewhere else in the week.  If you assign some of your eating and shower time to Sunday too, then there's even more free time to be absorbed by not-yet-itemized activities.
