<p>Having finally configured my VooDoo, I'm <b>very</b> happy playing Quake 3 here.<br/><br/>It is forbidden in .br since a guy killed some people with a machine gun at the theater, back in the 90's (I don't remember exactly when, but I think in 99...). You can't find it in stores anymore, but I had an old copy here, and I installed it.<br/><br/>It definitely rox.<br/><br/>I just wished I lived in the US to exchange my VooDoo for something newer. What a pity 3dFX went out of business. What a pity they aren't exchanging Voodoos outside the US. :-\<br/><br/>This is the second time I have problems with hardware. The first one was when my Visor broke and Handspring didn't accept international orders. It's still broken, since "S&H tax + new LCD = new Visor". :-\\<br/><br/>What use can I give to an international credit card, then? </p>

<h2>Waaaaaiit a second...</h2>

...spam is *legal*, but Doom is NOT?
<p>
Someone's got their priorities messed up here.</p>



<h2>I've told you...</h2>

That judge should have asked some consultancy when she was judging the spam case.
<br>
<br>And Doom (and Quake) should be forbidden only to people under 'x' years (do not confuse this X with the one from X-Rated<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)). People who can buy beer could buy Quake. Why not? I'd say 'x = 18;' is a good value.

Then there should be a similar age limit on spam.
<p>
Legal System:  "You cannot mail any spam out unless you're certain the recipient is over 18!"
</p><p>
Spammers:  "But that'll be nearly IMPOSSIBLE!  Spam won't be cost effective!"
</p><p>
Legal System:  *faint, slow smile*</p>
