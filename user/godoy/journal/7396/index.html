<p>I think that I need to reinstall my system. It's layouted as I used to think a long time ago, and it's not using any of those new and better filesystems ou there (I use ext3, but I could benefit a lot from Reiser in some partitions). <br/><br/>It still has fewer partitions than it could have, in case I want to upgrade or use a different distribution. I'm also thinking about installing FreeBSD. <br/><br/>The biggest problem is that it is running very nice with regards to functionality. I just can't have speed and functionality the way things are.<br/><br/>I'm also against this reinstall thing, but it is really poorly configured when one thinks about partitioning. <br/><br/>I've also been thinking about using LVM. With LVM, I can simply plug a new disk in and resize partitions and everything would be fine. <br/><br/>XFS is out of the game: it can't be reduced. So I have ReiserFS and Ext3 (plus JFS, which I have never used before). <br/><br/>
I'll spend a few days thinking on what I'm going to do. I also need to install this FreeBSD... I'm needing it for a few things. One thing that I already thought was having no Linux on this machine... but then I have the company and I need to have some reference (that is also true for FreeBSD).<br/><br/>
I dunno... I'll think about it. <br/><br/>
Oh, by the way, hdparm is already set. More RAM would also help... but I don't have the money <b>now</b>.</p>
