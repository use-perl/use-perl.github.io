<p>It is unlikely that anyone reading this doesn't know what Pugs is since it is all the rage, but just in case - <a href="http://pugscode.org">http://pugscode.org</a><br/><br/>Pugs is the brain child of Autrijus Tang.  He decided to take a 6 month sabbatical from paying work to see what resulted.  He did not pursue funding because he wanted the freedom to take the project in any direction that felt right.<br/><br/>The result has been amazing and it has also added much needed fuel to other people on other projects.  Unfortunately, the 6 month self-allotted window of time ended 2005-08-01.  So what does that mean for Autrijus and Pugs and the rest of us?  I had a chance to talk to him yesterday to find out.  While I have changed the wording of the conversation for brevity, I believe the intent of what was being said remains in tact.  <br/><br/>Q: What are your immediate plans now that your sabbatical is over?<br/><br/>A: I will split consulting gigs and Pugs development 50/50 for the next 2 months.  After that I will likely focus more time on paying work so I can take another sabbatical in early 2006.  While the next one may be shorter, my intention is to spend some time in Europe with leo and/or other lambdas/camels.<br/><br/>
Q: If I recall correctly, you have indicated that you are no longer opposed to funding.  Given the number of major direction changes in Pugs over the last 6 months, would you accept funding if it meant giving up the freedom to take the project in any direction you felt was right?<br/><br/>A: I am open to funding but the way TPF grants currently work, namely having fixed delivery goals and timelines, isn't in alignment of how I want this project to operate.  I can shift priorities and journal my efforts but that's about it.<br/><br/>Q: If TPF or someone else were interested in funding you for Pugs development, how much would it cost?<br/><br/>A: I have been able to focus completely on Pugs as well as travel to various conventions and hackathons for $3000 USD per month.<br/><br/>Q: How much capital would you need before you get started?<br/><br/>A: I haven't stopped Pugs development and I don't intend to.  Funding, in any amount, means not having to devote a propotional amount of time to paying work.  In other words, I am completely flexible.<br/><br/>Q: If someone is interested in helping support Pugs development financially, what should they do?<br/><br/>A: For now email - things may change but if they do I will post about that myself.</p>
