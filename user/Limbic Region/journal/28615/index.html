<p>She's beautiful.</p>
<p>You're looking pretty good in the picture too.  Give it a week or so and that will no longer be the case.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)</p>

<p>I whole heartedly concur with all of that<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

After a week you'll be happy, proud and absolutely shattered<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... both of you. And you'll enjoy every single minute<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

Conratulations!  I'm certain you'll have fun while kissing your sleep goodbye for a while.  Best piece of advice I got is to <b>*run*</b> home and make up as much of the great freezing, easily re-heatable food that you can.  You're be lucky if you can think about eating over the next few weeks, much less actually cook.

I have had a boy's name picked out since before I even knew my wife so I told her if we have a girl you have complete control.  She broke long standing tradition which would have been to use her maiden name as the baby's middle name.  The Philippines is known as the Pearl of the orient and she wanted her name to reflect some part of her heritage.

<h2>you and me both!</h2>

Congratulations!  It's good to see fellow perl people reproduce even if there's only a 50% chance of another perl person out of the deal.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br><br>Oh, and what everyone said about sleep is likely true. I became a dad to twins on Jan 10 and I get about 4 constantly interrupted hours of sleep a night (and that's with the wife "letting me sleep")  It shouldn't be so bad with just one child but it might be.  (I have 2 other children already but they were atypical in that they each slept through the night at about 2-3 weeks)



<h2>Dude!</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/bart/">bart</a> on 2006-02-08T08:08:22</h3>
Congratualtions! I remember your wife was first pregnant when my Mrs was, and then she had that miscarriage... Well my son is almost 6 months old now, so you didn't really take long to take a second chance... Amazing you kept it quiet for so long. I had no idea until now.



<h2>Many congratulations!</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jdavidb/">jdavidb</a> on 2006-02-08T19:15:26</h3>
<p>And what a beautiful name!</p>



<h2>Congratulations</h2>
