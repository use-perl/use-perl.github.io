<p>For more than 2 years, I have been collecting research material for a book I wanted to write.<br/><br/>In fact, it was 2 years ago when I pitched the idea to O'Reilly and very nearly reached a deal.  I withdrew when the reality of having our first child hit me.<br/><br/>Our second child is due in December and another reality just hit me.  It is extremely unlikely that any book will result from this work while it is still relavent.<br/><br/>I have been feeling extremely uncreative lately and this just makes it that much worse.<br/><br/>*shrug*</p>

You're on a road to a serious burnout, one you won't get out of in a very long time. You should do something that you really want to do, at least in a limited amount, to prevent that. For example, take 15 minutes a day to work on that book &mdash; even though the chance to have it published is minute. It'll restore your pleasure in doing things. Any thing.

As a former author, I agree.  The 9 months or so between the time I submitted my book propsal to the time I submitted my final revisions was a living hell.  To meet deadlines (for varying values of "meet") I spent anywhere between one and four hours per day working on the book, in addition to the day job.  I can't imagine the situation if I had kids at the time.  Now, it wasn't all bad, but it was a serious commitment, and you should know what you're getting into before you take the plunge.
<p>
So think long and hard about this.  And remember that you can always self-publish if you're just looking for a creative outlet and don't want to submit to deadlines and other publisher demands.</p>
