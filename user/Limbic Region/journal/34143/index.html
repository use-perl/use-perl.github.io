<p>At work, I am seldom a pleasant person to be around.  I often take on an elitist superior attitude and speak condescendingly.  When folks ask me for help, I don't fail to remind them if they had followed my suggestion from earlier, they wouldn't need my help now.<br/><br/>I also spend a fair amount of my time in self-introspection thinking about the days events - what I said, what I did, but more importantly - why.<br/><br/>I find it very easy to call myself a Christian but I don't find it very easy to be a Christian.<br/><br/>As a result, I decided to have 1 day a month complaint free.  No matter how large my frustration, no matter how painfully obvious a situation is - I will try not to complain.  I will try not to raise my voice.  I will try not to ridicule.  I will try not to offend.<br/><br/>This really is something that I want to do everyday but I am starting with baby steps.</p>

...you'll need it!<p><blockquote><div>"Elwood," my mother used to say to me -- she always called me Elwood.  "Elwood, in this life you must be oh-so-smart or oh-so-pleasant.  For a long time, I was smart.  I recommend pleasant."<br></div></blockquote>

I find that just watching <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvey_(film)" title="wikipedia.org">Harvey</a wikipedia.org> with James Stewart makes me want to be the most pleasant person I know. (That is where quote comes from, right?) It's sort of a tutorial for being a nice person to be around.

That's the quote, indeed.  I find that being pleasant is, almost always, very easy once you get used to it.  It's also very enjoyable.  I do my best to get along with everyone, and every year that seems to get a little easier.
