<p>We had over 100 "confirmed" guests, but only about 70 who showed. I wonder what would've happened if everyone did show, because all the food (buffet style) was eaten anyway.</p>

...because in Portugal, in a wedding where 150 people are expected, you're most likely to have 5 people not showing up...<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-\
