<p>Ok - so I didn't do much with my free time while my wife was away visiting her new in-laws and I haven't done much since she was back.<br/><br/>I don't really consider myself in a slump - just not being terribly productive.<br/><br/>Yesterday, a seasoned professional (probably with 30+ years in IT) comes to my desk because he has heard that I know a fair bit about Access and he can't get it to import a 150MB text file as it is giving him some weird un-diagnosable error.  I repeat the same steps he has and sure enough - the error message is nothing but gibberish.<br/><br/>I offer to verify that every record has the proper number of fields and also to truncate a particular field he suspects, but has no proof is the culprit.  I indicate that I have *nix tools on my  machine and he is interested in knowing how since they are "locked" down and chuckles saying he could do it if he had sed.<br/><br/>I reply with - why do it in sed when you have Perl.<br/><br/>You should have seen the look in his eyes when I began writing the program.  You see - this was a get it done as quickly as possible so you can take your wife to the Social Security Administration Office type problem.  I used every shortcut and then some.  He looked at the resulting gibberish - mentioned a few programming lanugages I had never heard of and said - "that" is going to fix my problem?<br/><br/>It did ;-) </p>

<h2>first exposure</h2>

So how many rads of exposure would that be?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

<p>RAD: Radiation Accumulated Dose</p>

<p>So perhaps more appropriate here would be:</p>

<p>REM: Roentgen Equivalent for Man</p>
