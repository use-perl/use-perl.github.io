<p>So two loose goals I have set for myself are:<br/><br/>1.  Expand my ability/knowledge WRT Perl by looking at the source/guts/internals.
2.  Contribute to Parrot in a meaningful way<br/><br/>Both of these tasks require C.  Now having never matriculated into college (to be read nearly flunking out of high school), I have no formal training in software design/programming.  I am self taught in what I do know and Perl was the first language that I ever got "good" at.  I don't code for a living so I don't get the benefit of peers or learning that my solution to a problem was terribly inefficient - fix it or risk the consequences.<br/><br/>So learning C is H-A-R-D.  I have taken too many things for granted in Perl and BASIC.  My first program may be a bit ambitious but I feel I should be able to do this:<br/><br/>http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=195991<br/><br/>As you can see, my Perl wasn't that great after 2 months but I got the job done.  I shouldn't be so hard on myself since I have only about 8 hours of learning C from TFM but still - this doesn't seem that hard.<br/><br/>read lines from a file into a bunch of arrays, program flow, modify array, write arrays back out to file - this isn't rocket science afterall<br/><br/>GRRRRRR</p>
