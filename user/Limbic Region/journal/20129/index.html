<p>I finally made a break through in my learning C and I am actually able to write entire subs before I have to go compile and check to see if it worked right.  I also finished my first project - a port of one of my very first Perl programs to C.  You can read all about that if you want<br/><br/>http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=378392<br/><br/>The trouble is that I have a wife now.  I have been very careful to only code seriously while I am at work.  I get so completely engrossed in what I am doing that I tune everything/everyone else out.  I forget to eat, what time it is, etc.  My mind gets spinning so fast that it can not calm down enough to get a decent night's rest.  This was the case last night - after finishing a movie at 10PM I tried just "finishing" up the C code I was working on.<br/><br/>20 minutes later I realized this was unfair to Jean and went to bed - and tossed and turned all night.<br/><br/>Lesson to self:  You can't code after 6PM if you want to sleep.</p>

Whereas I am driven to install compilers and interpreters but cannot seem to make myself write useful code again.  Sigh.
<p>
Although I'm also not married, so I might have fewer compunctions about using my time for myself.</p>
