<p>So some time back I decided to take some time off keeping up with what everyone else was doing and try to accomplish 1 of 2 things I considered to be difficult.  So far I am batting 0.<br/><br/>The first one was a personal task - learn Tagalog (the primary language of the Philippines).  I learned a few more phrases but nothing resembling fluency.<br/><br/>The second related to the Perl community - write a book.  I actually made significant progress on this one.  My idea pitched to O'Reilly was well received.  I produced an outline along with mounds of research.  Unfortunately, life happens and I just could not in fairness devote the time necessary to writing a book when my family deserved it more.  Oddly enough, another publisher contacted me unsolicited to see if I would be interested in writing a book on Perl for them.  I realized that it would have been in direct competition with O'Reilly's Cookbook series and declined.<br/><br/>I am not sure what I should do with the book.  I have thought about using the outline to write perl.com articles instead.  Maybe I should just turn over my ideas and research to brian (<a href="http://use.perl.org/user/brian_d_foy/journal/28208>)<br">http://use.perl.org/user/brian_d_foy/journal/28208>)<br</a><br/>In personal news - Jean and I just returned from a 3 week vacation in the Philippines.  I did something pretty serious to my knee and need to go to the doctor soon.<br/><br/>There are other things that I want to write about but wisdom tells me that opening my mouth will remove all doubt.<br/><br/>Cheers,
Limbic~Region</p>
