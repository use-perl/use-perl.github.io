<p>That's absolutely wonderful news!  Your child will learn Perl 6 and wonder how you every struggled with Perl 5<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<p>Maybe somebody should start a Perl parents' list or site or something; there are getting to be so many of us.</p>

<p>Is your wife the kind that will let you teach your child programming, or will she shoot you if you attempt to outnumber her with geeks in the household?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)</p>

"getting to be"? The running joke on the p5p list used to be that anyone on for more than a year had a kid on the way, whether they knew it or not. The number of kids amongst the perl regulars at OSCON is always pretty impressive. (Scary, but impressive...<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)



<h2>Renaissance Kid</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Limbic Region/">Limbic Region</a> on 2005-01-17T20:43:31</h3>
We just want to expose our children to as much as we can and hope and pray that they find something that makes them happy.

My wife is due to have our first (a boy) in ~5 weeks. I'm so excited for the addition to the family! Be patient though, sometimes you'll wonder why a grumpy, sleep deprived, emotional wreck of a woman has hijacked your wife's body.*<br> <br><br/><br/>*...that's been my experience anyway

Thank you for your well wishes.  Jean miscarried.  In retrospect, it would have been wise to wait but we were both caught up in the joy.  We are both doing quite well and are optimistic for the future but would rather not discuss it.  So for anyone else who might be reading this, please do not even write to say that you are sorry.<br> <br>
