<p>When I think of a spontaneous or impulsive person - I think of someone who is always doing something different.<br/><br/>By that definition - I am not spontaneous or impulsive.  I like things a certain way and while I don't fight change (ok, maybe a little) I certainly don't welcome it.<br/><br/>And yet - I have momentary bouts of insanity where bizarre things enter into my head and I execute them blindly.  Today it was bicycling into work.  You see, I am at least 40 pounds overweight and haven't exercised (let alone been on a bike) in about 3 years.<br/><br/>Do you think any rational thinking could have prevented me from making the 10 mile trek into work this morning?<br/><br/>
In other personal news - Jasmine is doing great and will be turning 3 months old this Sunday.  I have a pretty poor website up at <a href="http://www.gatcomb.org> if you are interested.  The 3 of us are driving up to Maine in June for my neice's graduation - she is first in her class.<br">http://www.gatcomb.org> if you are interested.  The 3 of us are driving up to Maine in June for my neice's graduation - she is first in her class.<br</a><br/>In tech news, I have pretty much just become an observer on #perl6.  I do have 2 projects that I am working on - one in perl5 and the other in C.  I have been taking a 3 week cycle approach to them.  (1 week on Perl, 1 week on C, 1 week off).  It has helped avoid even further burn out.<br/><br/>I am turning 30 this year.  I never really appreciated how much dedication it takes to be married, raise a child, take care of a house you own, and maintain a decent paying job.  Don't get me wrong - I wouldn't trade it for anything in the world but I am truly amazed by those that do that plus find time to have a social life and work on fun projects in their personal free time (ok - stop laughing).<br/><br/>I guess with time comes experience and hopefully with experience comes a bit of wisdom.<br/><br/>Cheers,
L~R</p>
