<p>I have just come to the realization that I have been taking a break from programming without really realizing it.<br/><br/>Subconciously, I knew I was burnout and was trying to bring the spice back by getting involved with Parrot, teaching myself C, reading everyone's journals looking for insight into something cool, etc.  Judging from the number of unfinished projects I have right now - it didn't work.<br/><br/>I picked up The Rule of Four and read it over the course of a work week and immediately moved on to Alphabet Versus The Goddess.  I haven't read books back to back in ages.  I guess I have just realized that my body has rejected anything more than just casual coding for now.<br/><br/>This is a good thing to realize since I have a lot of unread books I have purchased.<br/><br/>I will still hang out on #parrot, the Monastery CB, read the use.perl journals, etc - just not really coding anything.<br/><br/></p>
