<div class="span8">
<p>One day Pugs stopped building on my home machine (Win32).  It blew up during the build process when it got to Prelude.hs<br/><br/>It happened to coincide with a known problem with Prelude.hs and another patch that pretty much broke everything else.<br/><br/>After those issues resolved - it continued to be b0rk.  I tried EVERYTHING - no avail.<br/><br/>Just as I was about to give up, I remembered having deleted the perl.exe in the root directory of GHC.<br/><br/>You see, I have everything Pugs related under a single umbrella.  GHC shipped with a perl56.dll and perl.exe which was interfering with my 5.8.7 perl since . takes precedence over anything in %PATH on Win32.  I tried a few things after deleting it and everything appeared to work normally - to include GHC.<br/><br/>So since I hadn't just renamed the files and I didn't want to re-install GHC to test if that was the problem.  I just copied the 5.8.7 dll and exe to the GHC root directory and what do you know - it worked.<br/><br/>Why is GHC hard coded to look for a perl in its root directory?  Why would the error message not be more descriptive 0x01 or some such thing?  I don't know, but problem SOLVED!</p>
