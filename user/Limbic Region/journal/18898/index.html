<p>Ok - I joined the Perl community July 11th, 2002<br/><br/>I am an active member at the Monastery, have contributed a module to CPAN, and have been lurking on the p6 lists for a while.<br/><br/>My life is quite busy these days - getting married on June 12th and decided to teach myself C so I could hack parrot.  Not sure how much I will write in this journal, but I will be sure to mark all Perl related entries as such since not all of them will be.<br/><br/>Jean and I went to see Shrek 2 yesterday.  There is a lot of adult humor in the movie but fortunately it is worded so that it will fly over young children's heads like a 747.<br/><br/>Cicadas make a really nice white noise when you are trying to sleep.<br/><br/>ICU and Parrot both build and *mostly* work on Windows ME via Cygwin.<br/><br/>I've recently discontinued my journal on LJ because my on-line identity was tied to my real identity and given to cow orkers.  My own fault, but deletion was the appropriate course of action.<br/><br/>I've recently discontinued my account on Orkut.  When I did remember to login it was just to see if any female geeks were hot.<br/><br/>I guess that's about it.</p>

<h2>Hi there</h2>

So which module did you write, or is that secret too?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

Tie::Hash::Sorted - though I have an idea for another one.

<h2>Weird...</h2>

I was just pokin' around at perlmonks the other day and I noticed your nick on there somewhere and thought how creative it was.  And here you are!  hehe<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)



<h2>LJ, Orkut</h2>

I wondered where your LJ went -- checked for it a little while ago, all gone.  Good to see you here.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
