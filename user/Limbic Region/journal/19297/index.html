<p>So the wedding was Saturday, 2004-06-12.  It was extremely beautiful and I am not into that sorta thing if that tells you anything.  We came back to Maryland the following day and I took Monday and Tuesday off from work so we could um uh - spend time together.<br/><br/>Not exactly sure how I want to proceed.  Most of the intellectually stimulating things I want to do are individual processes.  I had my neice "acquire" a first and second year Spanish book from her high school so that I can teach Jean.  The theory is that I create a lesson one night and she translates it to Tagalog the next night and then to Illocano the following night.  This way at the end we will both speak at least 4 languages.<br/><br/>Parrot and C for now are just things that I would like to spend more time on but can't.<br/><br/>I am thinking about taking up some form of martial arts - something the two of us can do together where we are starting out as equals.<br/><br/>I guess that's about it - I am back to work today and have already been scheduled for a dozen or so meetings - *shrug* - it pays the bills.<br/><br/></p>

and welcome to the club of married Perl-users. It seems to be growing in membership constantly - maybe a sign of Perls age?



<h2>Congratulations Again</h2>

I never know what to say to people when they get married, but you seem effervescently happy about it, so congrats.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
<p>
Re: the martial arts thing -- interesting.  It had never occurred to me to do something like that with someone I'm in a relationship with.  (Probably because my interests are so narrow.)</p>
