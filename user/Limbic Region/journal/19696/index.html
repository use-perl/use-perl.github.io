<p>Ok - so I am back from a trip that I can't talk much about.  A major problem was uncovered elsewhere and while the people were brainstorming what to do about it - someone who probably wanted to sound hip, cool, and "in the know" mentioned Perl.<br/><br/>The next thing I know my boss is asking me if I can go tomorrow morning.  Now my boss is a nice guy and would not have pressured me if I had declined because my wife who has been in the country since April 19th doesn't have a SSN, driver's license, access to cash or public transportation etc would have to be home alone.  I did however learn that this was being very politically motivated so I agreed.<br/><br/>It turns out that the problem involved getting the intersection of two tables - SQL is NOT on of my areas of expertise.  To top it off, they have resident experts that also know the environment.  I learned a lot in the experience but it amazes me the lengths people will go to make other people happy instead of doing the right thing.<br/><br/>I am once again home again with Jean and am very happy to stay here ;-)<br/><br/></p>
