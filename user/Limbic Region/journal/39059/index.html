<p><b>Perl Saves The Day</b>
I am a lazy bastard.  This is one of three known virtues for a programmer.  Oddly enough, I am not a programmer - at least not professionally.  Anyway, this post is about perl so I have posted it here but it is also about my other blog.<br/><br/>Yes, this is my perl blog but I have a personal blog over at <a href="http://www.gatcomb.org/joshua">http://www.gatcomb.org/joshua</a><br/><br/>Actually, it is our family website and since my two girls are under the age of 4, I end up updating the content for 3 different people.  Even with a CMS, this can be a PITA.  I wrote some code using WWW::Selenium and Image::ExifTool to automate updating the photos.  I am using winblows - so in Explore, I just right-click on a photo and add some meta data to the summary (Author, Title and Caption).  Once I am done, I simply run the program which goes through every photo looking for the meta data, logs on to the website for the appropriate person (author), posts the picture using the title and caption and sets the date and time to when the picture was actually taken.<br/><br/>This has reduced the time to update the website enormously.  Perl saved the day since I had nearly 6 months worth of photos that needed to be updated for each of my daughters.<br/><br/><b>Plea For Help</b>
Ok, everyone is abandoning ship and leaving use.perl  I understand their reasons and agree with most of them.  I too have considered using my personal blog for perl blogging as well (not that I do too much of that) and just tagging posts appropriately.<br/><br/>The problem is there are still a number of folks here and elsewhere that I still want to follow.  So here is my plea for help.<br/><br/>Does anyone have a list of perl and/or programming related blogs that are not one of
- planet perl
- planet parrot
- use.perl
- perlbuzz<br/><br/>Did I mention I am a lazy bastard?  I have never bothered to setup an RSS feed.  I don't really know where people have wandered off to.  Can you please reply with who you feel is worth listening to and where to go listen?<br/><br/>Cheers</p>
