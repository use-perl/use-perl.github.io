<p>Typically, I don't make New Year's resolutions.  This is primarily because I have never been one to need a special day to remind me of things that I need to do or what I should be thankful for or how grateful I should be...<br/><br/>This year my wife asked me what my New Year's resolution was and I replied without thought or hesitation to try and be a better husband.  We have only been married since June but the person you intend to spend the rest of your life with is someone you should try to be a better person for.<br/><br/>
I have made a secondary and unofficial resolution as well.  Every Spring, I begin a strict excersise and diet routine - dramatically lose weight, coast through the summer - start packing on the pounds in fall, and become lethargic in the winter.  This year I am going to try and find a weight that is acceptable and stop fluctuating.<br/><br/>
Oh - you thought this might be about programming.  Like I said - I don't need a special day to remind me of what I should be doing - this list is pretty long and for starters I should stop doing the things listed here<br/><br/><URL:http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=417114></p>
