<p>I live in Maryland.  My family is in Maine and my wife's family is in the Philippines.  We have two young daughters which makes watching them grow up difficult.  To help, I have a family website<br/><br/><a href="http://gatcomb.org><br">http://gatcomb.org><br</a><br/>Recently, updating the website was a major challenge for a number of reasons (it had been two months since I did it, we had a family vacation to Maine with more photos than usual, and I had 4 cameras to deal with).  On top of that, I wanted to add streaming video to the site.<br/><br/>Perl to the rescue<br/><br/>One of the first tasks was fixing the EXIF meta data in hundreds of JPEGs.  My sister's camera had the wrong date.<br/><br/><a href="http://perlmonks.org/?node_id=700009><br">http://perlmonks.org/?node_id=700009><br</a><br/>The next task I had was organizing the photos.  I store my photos in the following structure:<br/><br/><pre>
<daughter's name>
   <year photo was taken>
       <month photo was taken>
           <day photo was taken>
</pre><br/><br/>I have written a little utility that once I bin the photos by daughter's name, it will then further file them into the appropriate directory - creating them as necessary.<br/><br/>Finally, after two years of taking short video clips with the digital camera, I decided to figure out how to do streaming video.  The good news is I figured it out, the bad news is I had 2 year's worth of videos to convert to streaming format 1 at a time.<br/><br/><a href="http://perlmonks.org/?node_id=700695><br">http://perlmonks.org/?node_id=700695><br</a><br/>I have no idea how many hours perl saved me.  I know there are other tools and sites that make this sort of thing easier but this is my site, and I want to do it my way - and perl let's me be me.</p>
