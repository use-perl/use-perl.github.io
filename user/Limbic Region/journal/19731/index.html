<div class="span8">
<p>In 4 days I will reach my 2 year anniversary with Perl and with PerlMonks.  I am spending some time reflecting on that and have discovered that I am an addict.  I am addicted to PerlMonks.  I would care to wager I log in 340+ days a year.<br/><br/>Each day I check the birthday page and send a personal bday greeting as long as the monk has logged in within the last few months.  It is my way of getting to know my fellow monks I may not interface with on a regular basis.<br/><br/>Though I am not obsessed with XP I have been an XP whore in the past.  I am quite proud of the fact that I am in the top 50 monks ranked by XP.  I went nearly a year and a half before I had a single node with negative reputation.  I have written code to determine how many monks that started after me have exceeded me in XP (a total of 7).<br/><br/>I am often in the top 10 of CB chatters:
http://mojotoad.perlmonk.org/cbs/
I have met quite a few monks in person outside of conventions - a complete list is maintained on my homenode.  I feel as though I "know" the regulars in the CB and remember personal information about them.  When I am having a problem I know who happens to be an expert at that particular problem.  Heck, I have even set up a couple of monks with members of the opposite sex before.<br/><br/>I contribute to the Offering Plate, I advocate the Monastery to anyone and everyone who will listen to me.  When people ask questions in #perl or #perlhelp I refer them to threads at the Monastery.<br/><br/>Plain and simple I am an addict.  I wrote a tutorial the other day
http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=371938
simply because the idea popped into my head since I had answered the question so many times.<br/><br/>
I don't feel that I need help - I don't see this as an unhealthy addiction - please do not plan an intervention for me - I can stop anytime I like - really - honestly :-)<br/><br/>Cheers
Limbic~Region</p>

<h2>I've been there</h2>

The difference being that I now know that I can stop.  And only do perlmonks when I don't have more important things going on in my life...
