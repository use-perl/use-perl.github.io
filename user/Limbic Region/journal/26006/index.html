<p>I decided a couple of weeks ago (<a href="http://use.perl.org/user/Limbic%20Region/journal/25807>) that I wasn't accomplishing anything of any significance because I was too busy keeping up with what everyone else is doing.<br">http://use.perl.org/user/Limbic%20Region/journal/25807>) that I wasn't accomplishing anything of any significance because I was too busy keeping up with what everyone else is doing.<br</a><br/>I also admitted to myself that perhaps the reason I was doing that was because in such a league of extrodinary gentlemen (and ladies), I would find myself sorely lacking.<br/><br/>Having realized there was a possibility of fear and being tired of thinking about all my unfinished projects, I decided to go about doing 1 of 2 very difficult things that I have wanted to do my whole life.  The first is related to the Perl community and the second is a personal goal.<br/><br/>So what does this have to do about a dream concerning Larry?<br/><br/>While I have been waiting to hear about the first idea (requires support and funding) I haven't started the second as I believe either will be an all consuming process.  So I am at work (a previous job) and Larry is coming on site to consult.  We are sitting down to get started and Larry is trying to turn on this two light lamp.  I keep trying to tell him he isn't doing it right as it requires two switches to be in the right place at the right time and he finally gets it.<br/><br/>Now I have never met Larry.  I don't think there is anyway that he would have required that much instruction to turn on a light - but maybe subconciously I was telling myself I still have something to offer even if I am not on par with the league of extrodinary gentlemen (and ladies).<br/><br/>In any case - if I haven't heard about the first idea this week, I will be off the grid even further as the secondary project is completely non-programming.<br/><br/>Cheers,
L~R</p>
