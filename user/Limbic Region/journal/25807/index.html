<p>I am officially assuming role of lurker in all the usual haunts until further notice.<br/><br/>It commonly accepted that the breadth of information in almost any field is too much for anyone to gain a level of mastery over.  One must resign themselves to a narrow area if they are going to be any good at what they do.<br/><br/>I have found that I do not accomplish much of anything with any significance because I spend the majority of my time keeping up with what everyone else is up to.<br/><br/>This isn't a bad thing.  I am able to help people find resources that meet their needs without being able to give them specific help myself.  I am not under any illusions that I am missing out on doing something great by not focusing my efforts on a personal project.<br/><br/>It is time for me to see what it is I am capable of accomplishing.  There are 2 projects that I have in mind.  One of them is non-technical and would result in a personal achievement that no one but a handful of people would appreciate.  The other is something technical that the community would benefit from but requires someone else agreeing that it is a profitable idea and willingness to fund it.<br/><br/>I will still be lurking, but TTFN<br/><br/>Cheers,
L~R
 <br/><br/></p>

Good for you.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)  I hope I have the necessary discipline to do this for myself soon, when it will be very helpful.
