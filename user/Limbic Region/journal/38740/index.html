<p>In case you weren't aware, the US and Europe have extremely different perspectives on giving employees time off.  I am very fortunate that I get 42.5 paid days off a year (19.5 vacation, 13 sick and 10 federal holidays).  It would be great if I could re-arrange that time off.<br/><br/>How many hours of work do I actually work to get my salary?<br/><br/>52 weeks a year x 40 hours a week = 2080 hours
42.5 days paid off x 8 hours = 340 hours
2080 - 340 = 1740 actual work hours<br/><br/>Ok, now let's say I only wanted to work 3 days a week.  That sounds sweet.  I would have to work 12 hour days to get close to the 40 but still - I wouldn't mind working 12 hour days if it meant having 4 days off for 3 days worked.  How many weeks a year would I have to work in order to account for the 1740?<br/><br/>1740 / 36 = 48 weeks and 1 day<br/><br/>Wow - let's knock that 1 day off as unpaid leave cause really - who wants to get paid for 1 day if the alternative is 11 days off in a row?<br/><br/>So if I could convince my employer to agree, I could work 3 days a week - still have 4 weeks of vacation and make effectively the same salary.  Now that is my idea of an ideal work week.<br/><br/>Yes, some might point out that if a holiday happens to fall on the Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday (those are the days I would work) then I would either have to take unpaid leave or work.  Really - who cares with a deal like that.

<h2>It's hard</h2>

<p>I did 4 x 10hr days for a couple of years.  At the beginning it was great because I got a couple extra distraction-free hours in the morning before others arrived at the office.</p><p>But after the first year, I found it draining.  In winter, I never saw daylight except from my office window.  It always seemed that my day off corresponded to an important meeting or a client emergency.  Bad days *really* dragged on.  When I switched back to 5 x 8hr days it was a relief.</p><p>I think plans like yours always sound good on paper, but they're hell in real life.</p>

<p>Agreed - I worked four day weeks for a while last year to "use or lose" some paid leave time. This isn't quite the same as your situation - in theory they were four 8hr days.

</p><p>But in practice what happened was that I had to squeeze five days' work into those four days because of meetings, colleague expectations, etc. I was glad to go back to a five day week!

</p><p>My tip would be to take the day off in the middle of the week, even though it seems counter-intuitive. Three day weekends seem to be very hard to manage, and not useful. But it's easier to plan to do errands on a Wednesday, leaving the weekend free for fun stuff.

</p><p>I expect the situation is probably different, and more manageable, if you're officially a part-time worker.</p>

<h2>productivity after 6-8 hours</h2>

<p>As mentioned above, it can be a drag in the long term.</p><p>Also, who productive can you really be for periods longer than 6-8 hours?</p><p>Some days I'm a zombie after only 6 hours, but there are days I can go 10-12 and feel ok.</p><p>I'm a sysadmin though so my tasks aren't typically the same thing all day every day.</p>

<blockquote><div><p> <i>Also, who productive can you really be for periods longer than 6-8 hours?</i></p></div> </blockquote><p>I agree completely.  I know many developers/engineers/admins can be productive for 12+ hours at a time on a single project, but those who can do that <b>every</b> workday are vanishingly rare.</p>



<h2>Unworkable in the .eu</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/castaway/">castaway</a> on 2009-04-05T09:07:24</h3>
<p>Luckily, IMO at least, this isn't possible in the EU, at least when working for an employer. If an employee were to work more than a week of days &gt;10 hours, the employer would probably end up paying a fine. (Exceptions can be made for the occasional day, if the employer has deadlines to keep.)</p><p>
Also whats this odd practice of counting the number of paid sick days as "time off"? No wonder you guys don't get much holiday..
