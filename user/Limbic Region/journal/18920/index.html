<p>The other day, a monk asked what IMC was in the Monastery CB as "apparently Parrot can compile it now".  Since I found the comment rather odd given what IMC is and how long it has been around, I went to point them to the FAQ on http://www.parrotcode.org to find that it was b0rk.<br/><br/>I have been fighting to figure out what is wrong with several JIT tests failing on Cygwin.  I have been able to reduce it too:
set N0, 1
set N1, 1
cosh N3, 1
print N3
end<br/><br/>I am sure I have given Leo and the list enough info to track it down and eradicate it<br/><br/>I still don't know why I can't fully debug all JIT either though I think I have it narrowed down to macros in the pasm<br/><br/>
Oh - I found that several tests were being skipped that don't need to be - threads, timer, and extend 12 - I provided patches but I am not sure if they will be applied as it was my first time an all<br/><br/>
Oh - on a personal note - I won a 3 week battle with the bank and they finally deposited money into my account<br/><br/></p>
