<p>Last night, I woke up out of a sound sleep after my wife yelled "sweetheart".  The thing is, she was sound asleep.  I went back to sleep.<br/><br/>A few hours later, I woke up again to the telephone ringing.  After rushing to the phone and checking the call history, I discovered it hadn't rang at all.<br/><br/>On my walk back to bed the possible symbolism hit me - am I missing my calling?<br/><br/>This is something I am going to ponder.<br/><br/>In perl related news, I worked on a google calendar parser for TPF.  It seems to have gone well.</p>

<h2>speculation</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/slanning/">slanning</a> on 2007-07-12T13:52:07</h3>
<p>You can speculate a million ways, I guess. Maybe you think you missed your calling because of your wife. Maybe you think she's cheating on you. Maybe you're having a mid-life crisis because your wife is getting old and you want to fuck a younger woman. Or you're afraid she's going to die and the bell is a church bell at her funeral.</p>
<p>Or maybe in the opposite direction. Your wife is everything, and she makes bells ring. You want to remarry her!</p>
<p>Or maybe your brain was just randomly firing those parts of your memory; and you realize that, in fact, but you're not happy and want to use these coincidental events as an excuse to change your life. Why not?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>
