<p>I was in the military.  You learn an important rule - never volunteer.  In fact, when someone asks for volunteers, step backwards to leave some poor schmuck who stands still a volunteer.<br/><br/>While I believe that philosophy has its place, it is usually not in the open source community.  A few days ago I started a thread in the p6.internals list, after being prompted by an ICU developer, to reconsider our use of it, in its current state, for our unicode support.<br/><br/>It is the thread that will not die.  Everyone seems to have an opinion.  But Dan's position is very clear - we will provide unicode support with parrot.  What wasn't originally clear though is that the user doesn't need to use it if they don't want.<br/><br/>So I started a new thread today.  Basically people need to stop talking about what we should do and volunteer to do something about it.  There is nothing saying we are locked into ICU - heck, even Dan would like to see it gone, but we need an alternative.  I am not volunteering for that - even if I had the skills.... well maybe if I had the skills.<br/><br/>Fearing inaction, I suggested that a representative from each platform that Parrot is building on checkout the latest stable release, build it, and report anything "special" required to get it to work.  This should make things a lot easier if we stay with ICU or even if we continue to support it in addition to another library.<br/><br/>I volunteered for the Cygwin platform since I appear the only person on the planet using Cygwin and Parrot.</p>

Which branch and for how long?  And may I ask what your final rank was?  Just curious.</p>
