<p>jwz said "Some people, when confronted with a problem, think 'I know, I'll use regular expressions.' Now they have two problems."<br/><br/>I say that the same applies to XML and all its bastard offspring like XSLT and XFOTM.</p>

I think it's often easier to say what you don't like, rather than what you like.

I like pie.  And puppies.  Mmmmm, puppy pie, with all those cute little tails sticking out through the pastry and wagging temptingly at me.

Yes, I agree.  See how easy it is to find bad reviews of your favourite $thing.  However, that doesn't change that fact that I really dislike XML and all its retarded relations.<br/><br/>More accurately, I dislike what XML has become.

<h2>It's not that bad...!</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ajt/">ajt</a> on 2003-10-13T20:15:42</h3>
<p>XML is great at some things, but like many things that become trendy it's been picked up my too many people who don't know what they are doing, and pushed into places it's not sane to push it.</p>

<p>I don't hate XML, but I do hate to see it abused. Like any technology if you use it inappropriately, it gets a bad reputation. You could say that Perl has lost a lot of credibility because of all the people who rushed to use it when CGI became trendy and Perl was the dominant language of choice for CGI.</p>

<p>Clueless masses jumping on a bandwagon, driving the hype along, only damage things in the end. Many intelligent programmers deride Perl as insecure CGI or unreadable line noise, just because of their experience with early CGI bandwagoners. Don't let hoards of clueless morons spoil your view of XML!</p>
