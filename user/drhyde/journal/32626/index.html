<p>Gosh, you do come across some fascinating people in the perl world.  For example, the guy who, when I reported that his module didn't work on 5.6.2, said that he didn't care about such ancient versions of perl which is, I suppose, fair enough.  My follow-up suggestion that it might be helpful if he at least tell people that instead of spitting random XS-ish errors was apparently illogical, inexperienced and "making things up".  Lovely.</p>

It could be the guy who had a crypto module that was a deep dependency of OpenPGP, that didn't work on Windows. On asking if the bug could be fixed, he responded he "...couldn't give a shit about Winblows, and no I'm not fixing it. Go and get a real operating system".<br>

<p>To be <em>somewhat</em> fair, it's not as if there are ready armies of willing Windows hackers submitting patches left and right.  I've had a handful of Windows users report bugs, but when it comes time to write code, very few do.</p>

<p>There's little excuse for dropping such a patch though.</p>

I wonder if I was that Perl 5.6 hater.<br><br>I accept Perl 5.6 patches, but I think it's fair that people who actually use Perl 5.6 support it  themselves by creating and sending the patches.<br><br>drhyde has been very helpful to me lately by testing and submitting back testing reports.<br><br>Thanks!<br>
