<p>The amusingly spelt "Szab? Bal?zs", which I believe is pronounced "Scabby Bollocks" writes, in response to my report that his module Class::Date has no tests, "Ez egy automatikusan gener?lt ?zenet, amelyet a c?mzett az?rt k?ld, hogy cs?kkentse a k?retlen levelek (SPAM) mennyis?g?t", which I believe is Eskimo for "I'm bouncing this back to you either because your address was faked by a spammer, or because you're a non-spammer who tried to contact me.  Either way, I'm going out of my way to annoy you when I know you've done nothing to annoy me.  Aren't I a fabulous person".</p>

This seems reasonable given that (1) this is a stupid reason to report a "bug" and (2) the modules *does* have tests...

It's time for use.perl to switch from ISO-8859-1 to Unicode!

Why would someone want to listen to you when you refer to others as <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/drhyde/journal/34389" title="perl.org">"annoying" and "stupid"</a perl.org> and mock someone's name as "Scabby Bollocks"?

<p>I refer to people as annoying and stupid when they do annoying and stupid things.  Anything wrong with that?  No, didn't think so.

</p><p>I suppose that taking the piss out of his name might have been a bit off, and I apologise to anyone who was offended.  It was intended to be part of the same joke where I claimed he was talking in Eskimo and deliberately rendered all the non-ASCII characters as question marks like they appeared in his email.

</p><p>And I don't particularly expect anyone to listen when I'm venting my spleen.  Spleens don't generally make nice noises.</p>
