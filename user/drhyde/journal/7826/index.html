<p>Greg has made a terrible mistake.  He was the one who chose the hotel for london.pm.  And it's dry.  The minibars contain water! and apple juice! and no bloody spirits or beer!<br/><br/><P>On Tuesday night, I met up with <A HREF=http://www.jstriedl.de>Josef Striedl</A>, who is an <A HREF=http://www.lbw2002.draiocht.net/>LBW</A>er I met in Ireland.  He took myself, gellyfish and Greg on a debauched tour of Munich.  We met in a pub next to the hotel, then went on to a beer garden, then to a pub which seemed to serve no food apart from venison, then on to the brewery tap of the Augustiner brewery.  The beer was splendid.  And, errm, now that I think about it, I believe we drank about two gallons.  No wonder I felt so delicate yesterday morning and decided to have a dry day.  Of course, it didn't last, so in the evening I did the time-shifting trick that I invented for this month's London Perl Mongers social meet.<br/><br/><P>I was horribly productive yesterday evening (before timeshifting and going to the pub).  I have bugfixed Data::Hexdumper (new upload to CPAN coming soon).  I was intending to work on the next version of Tie::Hash::Transactional too, but then I realised that the latest version of the code is on my laptop at home, which is turned off.  Oops.<br/><br/><P>So instead, I decided to write another Acme::* module, so that <A HREF=http://use.perl.org/user/acme/>acme</A> would have to namecheck me again.  Got it all working last night, just needed to get online to download some text to embed in it, which I have done in the past few minutes during <A HREF=http://www.gellyfish.com>gellyfish</A>'s talk.  And now it's uploaded.  Yay, licencing your code will now be so much easier, as you can apply the <EM>awesome power</EM> of Acme::Licence.<br/><br/><P>About half the people have walked out of gellyfish's talk.  He's just noticed that the rest of us are only here because there's really good wireless connectivity.  Heh.</p>
