<p>So, to those of you who are leaving use.perl for shinier (if not greener) pastures - where are you all going?  Having everyone in one place with one user interface was ever so convenient, even if the user interface doesn't have rounded corners.</p>

Or twitter, or facebook, or all of the above.<br/><br/>Someone should create Planet Perl to aggregate them all.

<h2>Blogger</h2>

It's simple (read: somewhat limited), but it has import/export, lets me use my own DNS entry and styling, and generally just works.

<p>Rounded corners wasn't the big reason.</p><p>The "feature" that keeps logging me out on (what appears to be) random page refreshes, the fact that logging me out caused comments to collapse into a unreadable mess, and finally the text area being a tiny little hole to try to type a long-form blog post or comment into sent me running back to the Movable Type install I had on my own website. That way at least I know that the person behind the installation is motivated to fix the issues I encounter, or at the least I know I'm responsible for my own mess.</p>



<h2>I'm Mostly Blogging on my LiveJournal Tech Blog</h2>

<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/me/blogs/#shlomif_tech" title="shlomifish.org">I've been mostly blogging on my tech blog</a shlomifish.org>, which is technically a LiveJournal community. I tag all Perl-related entries with the "perl" tag. On the link I have some aggregated blogs - one of them for all Perl-related stuff. The LiveJournal solution works for me, but is not ideal. For example Technorati refuses to index this blog because it's an LJ community.
