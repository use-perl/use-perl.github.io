<div class="span8">
<p><p>At the recent QA Hackathon in Birmingham (which was great - many thanks to Birmingham.pm for organising it, and to the hotel for having a rubbish network so I actually worked instead of dicking around on IRC) I worked on my idea for the Comprehensive Perl $version Archive Network, or CPXXXAN for short, mostly so I can make jokes about hot module-on-module action.

<p>It is intended to be a set of CPAN "mirrors" which only contain distributions which pass their tests on a particular version of perl, with their 02packages index files set up correctly so that if, eg, you go to the mirror for perl 5.6.2, you'll get DBI 1.604, <a href=http://bbbike.radzeit.de/user/slaven/cpantestersmatrix.cgi?dist=DBI;maxver=1>which works</a>, instead of DBI 1.607, <a href=http://cpansearch.perl.org/src/TIMB/DBI-1.607/Makefile.PL>which doesn't</a>.

<p>While you might think that this is pointless - the argument is that "people who don't upgrade perl won't want to upgrade modules" - consider that recent releases of some distributions now require perl 5.10, even though that's only just over a year old.  5.6.2 just makes a convenient test case.

<p>In Birmingham, I tested it and got it all working on my laptop, using a subset of the data (specifically, distributions beginning with DBI or DBD).  Now I'm building the 5.6.2 index for the whole of the CPAN.  It's taking a very long time, but I'm not that concerned, as I'm unlikely to update the indices more than once a month.  Even so, any Clues about how to make my SQL more efficient would be most welcome.  See <a href=http://www.cantrell.org.uk/cgit/cgit.cgi/cpxxxan/tree/schema.sql>the schema</a> and <a href=http://www.cantrell.org.uk/cgit/cgit.cgi/cpxxxan/tree/build02packages.pl>the query</a> that figures out what the most recent passing distribution is and what modules are in it.

<p>All the code if in my git repo, email me if you want access.</p>

<p>From 'importtestresults.pl' I see that only dists with 'PASS' are imported in. This means that dists with external prereqs (for ex. XML::Parser - it requires expat with header files), dists with problems of prerers (for ex. current version of prereq does not work on this version of perl) are not included.</p>

<p>The whole point is that we know all the modules listed work.  It would be silly to import all the failure reports as well, only to ignore them!

</p><p>As it happens, various incarnations of the XML-Parser distribution have passed their tests on 23 different versions of perl.  As one of them is perl 5.6.2, then XML::Parser will be in the list.  Sure, you need an external C library.  Not only can we not detect that, but it would be silly to exclude everything that has a non-perl dependency.  If we were to do that we'd have to exclude WIn32::* because they depend on Windows, which lots of people don't have!

</p><p>The issue with pre-reqs is a problem, but one that a perl version-specific mirror can over time, help with.  Let's assume that DBIx::Garbleflux is released today, requires DBI, but isn't fussy about what version.  Normally, it would never even get tested on 5.6.2, because the testers' CPAN.pm can't automatically retrieve a working version of DBI.  But if the tester's perl is pointing at my 5.6.2-specific mirror, then it can!  The shiny new untested DBIx::Garbleflux is available to test, as A/AU/AUTHORID/DBI-Garbleflux-1.0.tar.gz, from my mirror (which is simply a BackPAN with an index layered on top) so testers' machines will attempt to install it.  CPAN.pm will see that there's a dependency on DBI - the module called DBI, not any particular distribution of DBI - and look it up in the index.  The index will tell it to download and install T/TI/TIMB/DBI-1.604.tar.gz (the last version of DBI to pass its tests of 5.6.2) and so the shiny new DBI::Garbleflux will magically get tested with the right rusty old versions of its pre-requisites, and (provided that the author got everything right) a test PASS will be reported, which will eventually get back to the CPXXXAN and thus the module will be available to normal users of obsolete perl.</p>

<p>Hi</p><p>Perhaps it would be faster to import the data into Postgres, and then use a trivial script to copy the data to SQLite.</p><p>Cheers<br>Ron</p>

Importing the data isn't the problem, it's the query in build02packages.pl.
