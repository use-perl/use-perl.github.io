<p><p>The database of the UK Specified Numbering Scheme, which I previously stored in some very large hashes,  now lurks in a DBM::Deep database.  Because neither ExtUtils::MakeMaker nor Module::Build really make it obvious to a simpleton like me how to bundle data files with modules, I decided to be Evil and bung the database in the __DATA__ segment of a module.  Bwahahaha.  This required a minor change to DBM::Deep, which Joseph Huckaby, the author, did very quickly.  What a nice man!  It also requires some minor gymnastics with IO::Scalar, but even with me slurping the entire database into a scalar in memory, the memory footprint is still much less than it was before.</p>

<p>Number::Phone 1.5 also has a new method, location(), which is intended to give the approximate latitude and longitude of a fixed line.  I should probably go and register softwareforstalkers.com.  So I can get it working for UK numbers, I need data on the locations of all BT's exchanges and which number ranges are served by each exchange.  I know this data exists, cos ISPs use it to determine whether you can get DSL.  But can I find it anywhere on BT's web shite?  Can I hell.  Free beer for anyone who can help with that.</p></p>

I don't know about U.K., but in North America there is a growing trend toward phone number mobility, where you can take an existing phone number and move it physically to a different home, or move it logically to a different service provider.  That means that the exchange number will become increasingly inaccurate for determining physical location, and will require a dynamic database search rather than a static table lookup to resolve correctly.  (This is especially and obviously true when you try to give longtitude/latitude coordinates for a cell phone.)

There is only very limited number portability right now, so it doesn't matter much.  As for mobiles - obviously it is completely impossible to know where they are without having access to the nyetwork operators' voodoo systems, so I'm not even going to bother.
