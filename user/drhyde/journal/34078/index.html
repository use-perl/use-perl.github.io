<p><p>Hurrah!  I finally managed to build perl on NetBSD/Alpha!  So I've added that machine to my regular testing, and while I was at it I also added an OS X/x86 box.

<p>I've also started working through the CPAN back-catalogue, testing the most recent version of every distribution on the CPAN.  Today I sent well over a thousand test reports.  <a href=http://perl.grango.org/mtesters.html>BingoS</a> is gonna have to work hard to stay at the top of the leaderboard :-)</p>

<h2>And I got a mail flood...</h2>

or well over a dozen failure emails.<br><br>THANKS!<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)



<h2>what kinds of problems did you have?</h2>

If you had to make any particular changes to hints/netbsd.sh, or if you had to use Configure arguments that were not obvious, or even more so if you had to make some actual code changes, I'm certain perl5-porters@perl.org would love to hear what you did.<br>

5.9.5 builds with -de straight out of the box.

Ahh, so by this:<br><br>&gt; Hurrah! I finally managed to build perl on NetBSD/Alpha!<br><br>you meant that you hadn't done it so far, instead of you having problems with it.  Okay, good, good to hear that NetBSD stll builds out of the box, and on alpha, too!<br><br>

I've had problems with it before, so it seems that someone fixed it.  Probably by accident, so I'll try to dig out the my mails to p5p back when it was broken so that someone can see what changed.

<h2>latest release or latest release for an author</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/tonyc/">tonyc</a> on 2007-08-13T00:40:13</h3>
<p>It looks like you're doing the latest release of distributions for an author.  So Imager is tested both for release 0.43 (ADDI) and 0.59 (TONYC).</p>

<p>Not that it matters much.</p>
