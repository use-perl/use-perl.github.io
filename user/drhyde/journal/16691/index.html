<div class="span8">
<p>Last night I released Data::Compare 0.06.  It's functionally the same as the previous release, but the special-case support for comparing Scalar::Properties objects has been moved into a plugin.<br/><br/><P>Supporting plugins was Jim Cromie's idea.  He was even good enough to send a nice big patch.  I ended up not using his patch and writing my own version, for various reasons, but he deserves a great deal of credit for the idea.<br/><br/><P>The way I've done plugins is, I think, really nifty.  We use File::Find::Rule to find any Data::Compare::Plugins::* module on the system, and <CODE>require</CODE> it.  Because <CODE>require</CODE> returns the value from evaluating the code, we make use of that, and instead of just evaluating to <CODE>1</CODE> like most modules do, plugins must evaluate to a data structure which describes what the plugin can compare and how.  That is squirreled away in a hash for easy access later.<br/><br/><P>Then, whenever we come to compare two structures, we first check to see if there is a hash entry for that pair of data types and if there is, do whatever the plugin says.  If there isn't, we try to compare the underlying data structures.<br/><br/><P>Plugins are useful in two circumstances that I can see:<br/><br/><OL><LI>when your data type has overloaded operators like stringify, numify, and comparison - you can now provide code so that Data::Compare can delve into their guts and *really* compare them;
<LI>you want non-equal structures to compare equal.  The plugin for Scalar::Properties is an excellent example.  I decided that a true scalar and a Scalar::Properties should be treated as being the same if they stringify/numify the same, but that comparing two S::Ps should only succeed if both their values and all their properties match.
</OL><br/><br/><P>And then this morning, the first thing I did was spot a documentation bug in the new version.  Oops.<br/><br/><P><STRONG>[Update]</STRONG> I spotted another oopsie too, where it might try to load the same plugin twice, and hence spit out errors about redefined subroutines and stuff.  Both fixed in 0.07 :-)</p>
