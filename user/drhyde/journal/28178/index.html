<div class="span8">
<p>There are, apparently, lots of good webby applications.  Many of them do things that I want to do.  So why do I not use them?

<p>Simple.  They all insist on their own particular brand of weirdness embedded in Apache.  Whether it be loading a humungous module like mod_perl or mom_php; twiddling all kinds of security settings; or even just setting up a few virtual directories - all these fail because I am lazy.  I prefer simple self-contained applications like <a href=http://www-uxsup.csx.cam.ac.uk/user/dpc22/prayer/>the Prayer webmail system</a>.  I like it because it doesn't require any effort to get running.  It just works.  And it is independent of my Apache installation.  That it happens to be written in C and so is bastard fast and consumes half of fuck-all memory is also nice, but I could live with something similar in less efficient languages like perl, python or even java.

<p>However you do it, either having one ginormous Apache instance for everything, or lots of different instances with different configurations, there are <strong>big</strong> downsides - either you run out of memory immediately, or you have administrative headaches.

<p>It seems to me that web applications written in perl are particularly bad offenders in this respect - almost all either require mod_perl or are horribly crippled when run as CGIs with virtually no documentation for this configuration.  It can't be hard for application writers to fix this.

<ul><li>Write better documentation;
<li>Make most of your application into a long-lived daemon which a tiny CGI talks to;
<li>and make using HTTP::Server::Simple an option so that neither you nor I need to care about what web sewer I use.
</ul></p>

<h2>FastCGI</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Dom2/">Dom2</a> on 2005-12-30T22:54:10</h3>
This is one reason why the Rails people have been so keen on FastCGI as far as I can see...

<h2>The tricky bit...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Alias/">Alias</a> on 2005-12-31T04:45:54</h3>
... is that Engine abstraction is SUCH an enormous bitch to make work.<br><br>Catalyst is damn close to doing this right now. Isotope should democratise the concept if it doesn't get screwed up.<br><br>I think 2006 is the year that Perl web apps are going to finally get flexibly deployable.<br><br>It feels like we are _this_ close...
