<p>So I'm finding myself at the <a href='perlworkshop.de'>GPW</a> near Stuttgart. I've decided to fly in rather than drive or take the train to save some time. <p>

I arrived here on monday evening, just too late to have dinner with jouke, autrijus, clkao and 'that lot' :) but in time to take a quick shower and be abducted to the early arrivals dinner, which
we had at a quaint little place in schorndorf, and i managed to try something called flaedle (or so), and it was very tasty.<p>

It was also good timing to see a few people again, that I'd not seen since the last german perl workshop, including marcus and joerg.<p>

So yesterday was the actual first day of the conference, and since I'm sharing my room with autrijus, and he had a 9 o'clock tutorial, needless to say there was not much time for sleep.<p>

His tutorial (on <a href='par.perl.org'>PAR</a>) went quite well, and all I can say is 'Par is very very nifty'. I inmediately imagined parring up the whole cpan and making napc work.<br>
But more on that later :)<p>

A few more dutchies turned out to be here (Abigail and Jouke) and the three of us made our way into town for lunch. After some wandering in the sun we found a german/greek restaurant (actually, just about every restaurant here seems to be german/greek -- suspicous!) that offered a 'spicy bifteki'. I ordered it, added 3 tablespoons of crushed peppers and enjoyed quite a nice lunch.<p>

The rest of the afternoon held more talks, of varying quality. Some were stating the obvious (or to me anyway -- for people who were new to the subject, these may have been great talks), and some were sadly just boring. Luckily, there's always a few unexepted good talks in the lot, and so again today.<p>

Then this morning, it was 8 o'clock, lights on again. Managed to have a quick breakfast and get a ride with Abigail to the conference. Gem-talk of the day is definately <a href='http://wagner.elixus.org/user/clkao/svk-intro/'>clkao's svk talk</a>, which is basically an open source version of bitkeeper, based on svn, implemented in perl.<br>
The project is a bit young, which makes me hesitant to move our production vcs to it, but other than that it looks awesome. Maybe in a year or so, we'll be brave enough to move.<p>

After that talk, another lunch, and again very tasty. Friendly waitresses and good food. More than I expected if I'm honest ;)<p>

In our copious free time, Autrijus and I managed to hack quite a bit at <a href='cpanplus.sf.net>CPANPLUS</a> and I think we might be able to release an 0.050 beta release this week.<p>

All in all this trip has been quite worth it so far, even if I'm terribly low on sleep ;)<p>

More later...</p>
