<p>I've just uploaded CPANPLUS 0.072 to pause.<br/><br/>The biggest change for this release was to make
configuring CPANPLUS a lot easier. Basically, you
dont have to do it any more :) Furthermore, RAM
usage and startup times have been lowered by
moving some of those operations to runtime.
Overall, performance should increase quite a
bit from this.<br/><br/>These were two of the major gripes reported to me
and I hope this release will make life easier for
those people.<br/><br/>Anyway, it should be available shortly at:<br/><br/>    http://search.cpan.org/user/kane/CPANPLUS/<br/><br/>Below are the changes for this release.<br/><br/>Changes for 0.072       Fri Jun 23 18:17:00 CEST 2006
=====================================================<br/><br/>*   This is a major release of CPANPLUS. It includes
    all the changes from release 0.070_01, including
    the following changes made after the beta was
    released:
*   The POD text of CPANPLUS.pm has been revamped to
    be more of a guide than a technical reference.
*   $module->status is now lazily initialized, lowering
    overall RAM usage and startup time at the cost of
    a runtime penalty. Overall, this improves performance
    significantly.
*   Address #20005: CPANPLUS does not check size of 
    downloaded module this adds code that checks if 
    the downloaded size is equal to the size specified 
    by the checksums file
*   Fix file fetching testing issue on Win32 (#18702)<br/><br/>Changes for 0.070_01    Mon Jun 19 17:23:38 CEST 2006
=====================================================
*   This is a major beta release of CPANPLUS, revamping 
    the configuration mechanism. From now on, CPANPLUS 
    no longer requires a setup to be run at installation
    time and should work 'out of the box' on most 
    systems using a pre-built configuration file.
*   CPANPLUS now supports stacked configuration files:
    *   CPANPLUS::Config is the heuristic config file
        which will always be installed sytemwide.
    *   CPANPLUS::Config::System is the systemwide
        config file which can be installed by an admin
        in your perl installation path. This file will
        be available for everyone and override settings
        from CPANPLUS::Config
    *   CPANPLUS::Config::User is the per-user config
        which can be installed by any user in their
        $HOME/.cpanplus directory. This file will be
        available for the user only and override settings 
        from CPANPLUS::Config and CPANPLUS::Config::System
    *   $HOME/.cpanplus/lib gets added automatically to your
        config search path.
    *   All configuration types can be created and saved
        via the interactive Setup. You can invoke it from
        the default shell as follows:
        
        CPAN Terminal> s conf user      # per user config
        CPAN Terminal> s conf system    # system wide config
        
        or during installation time like this:
        
        $ perl Makefile.PL --setup  
*   Makefile.PL has been stripped from all it's magic    
*   Setup is now menu based for a better user experience.    
*   make loading plugin configs work, with priority 
    for system & user configs before the rest
*   address #19438: Key 'file' is of invalid type
    Turns out it's a bug in Module::Build, reported as 
    #19741, which creates a 'Build' file when running
    'perl Makefile.PL' on a M::B generated Makefile.PL
    Add a patch that detects this situation and informs 
    the user
*   Demand Test::Harness 2.62 to be installed due to 
    bug #19505 in earlier versions
*   IPC::Run is now required for Win32 & Cygwin
*   use $Config{path_ext} instead of hardcoded ':' to 
    seperate $PATH in cpanp-boxed
*   Small test changes in 20.t to make sure no test output
    counter mismatches occur.
*   remove all 'clever' code from CPANPLUS::inc, as the
    new config methodology makes it obsolete. Basic 
    functionality is retained only for backwards compat.
*   remove CPANPLUS config version checks back and forth 
    -- should work without from now on
*   make cpanp-boxed work from others dirs than just bin/..
*   make use of package::constants
*   Make sure Bundle-Foo.tgz also gets recognized as bundle
*   Data::Dumper indenting style set to '1' in default shell
*   make constants for libdir etc accept a list, not just 
    a single param
*   address #19738: bogus entry in @INC
*   address: #18270: cpan2dist --archive breaks with 
    relative path    
*   address #18121: invalid value for 'checksum_value'
    which showed that old .stored files can mess up CPANPLUS
    untill they are rebuilt. From now on, Makefile.PL will
    delete old .stored files when installing a new version
*   mark all the versions of inc/ modules as -1, so we
    are always 'not uptodate' when asked to install them
*   remove old api that lets you set values in configure 
    object via backend->new or configure->new, which was
    impractical and unused.
*   updated our bugreporting address to point at the
    rt.cpan.org queue.
*   Clean up source tree from obsolete files
*   Have 'make clean' clean up all the generated files</p>
