<p>Hi,<br/><br/>I'm pleased to announce we've just released CPANPLUS 0.052. Below is a
list of changes for this release. You can get it from<br/><br/>	http://cpanplus.xs4all.nl/user/kane/CPANPLUS-0.052.tar.gz<br/><br/>or soon from a CPAN near you.<br/><br/>Changes for 0.052       Wed Feb  9 18:44:13 CET 2005
====================================================<br/><br/>*   Make auto-installation work (with some guess work) if
    $ENV{PERL_MM_USE_DEFAULT} is set.
*   Setup decent defaults for the callbacks, so scripts
    don't have to set them unless they want actual callback
    behaviour (This helps ExtUtils::AutoInstall greatly).
*   chmod() extracted files to 755 so we do not get permission
    denied errors when trying to remove them or copy over them
    if they were not +w for the user.
*   Don't use sudo, even if it's configured, if the user is
    root already.
*   Default to 'prefer binary programs' if Compress::Zlib is
    not installed.
*   Make 'parse_module' deal better with paths that have sub
    directories in them.
*   Make 'parse_module' deal better with version numbers
    that have letters in them.
*   Don't shell out to get the perl version if the perl we
    looking for is $^X;
*   Improve finding a proper homedir for cpanplus on VMS
*   Accept the perl version as an optional argument to
    'module_is_supplied_with_perl_core'
*   Require Test::Reporter 1.27 for test reporting; it fixes
    many bugs.
*   Only load Module::Build when we really needed it, not on
    any installation.
*   Fix a bug that made 's reconfigure' not use the defaults
    from your current config.
*   RedHat 9.0's stock perl has a few serious bugs in it
    (they applied custom patches) and will break CPANPLUS
    badly. Add a note to the makefile.pl that redhat users
    should upgrade their perl.
*   CPANPLUS::inc was encountering 'use' calls that had windows
    paths rather than unix paths (???). Patch to compensate
    for this.
*   Module::Load::Conditional cache is being flushed in standard
    flush runs now, allowing use of LWP (and similar) when it
    becomes available, even if it previously wasn't.
*   Don't copy 'Config.pm-orig' to 'Config.pm' during Makefile.PL
    stage -- if the user has a custom config and forgets to set
    the environment var, CPANPLUS' tests will use the wrong config.
*   Some tarballs have '.' as directory, rather than project sub
    directory. Guess first for extraction dir and verify, only
    then try the actual extract path.
*   Improve documentation in the Default shell
*   Improve test reporting texts as supplied by Barbie
*   Add a callback to munge test reports before they are sent
*   Add versions of loaded dependencies to the test reports.
*   Make limited tests on skipped configuration work properly.
*   Don't use sudo to install into our own sandbox for
    Module::Build tests
*   Skip module::build tests if we're under PERL_CORE and
    M::B is not available (not yet integrated)
*   Skip install tests if run under PERL_CORE
*   Adjust include paths and paths to perl when tests are
    run under PERL_CORE
*   Update bundled IPC::Run to version 0.80
*   Update bundled Module::Build to version 0.26081
*   Improve tests<br/><br/></p>
