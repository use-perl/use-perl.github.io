<p>So progress on <a href='http://cpanplus.sf.net'>CPANPLUS</a> has been slow lately.<p>

Of course, I have plenty of places to point my finger.<p>
Mostly to <a href='http://search.cpan.org/author/KANE/Archive-Tar-0.23/'>Archive::Tar</a>, which was so broken (and had been for <b><a href="http://search.cpan.org/author/SRZ/Archive-Tar-0.22/"a>three</a></b> years), that CPANPLUS was having trouble extracting some newer releases with it.<p>

So I stupidly volunteered to take over maintainership, since the last author was MIA for well, 3 years. It's only then you realise exactly what can of worms you precisely opened;<p>

For example, it had no idea what '././@LongLink' files were [0], plus it had interesting code in it like:<p>
<code>
    system( ... ) or die "error: $!";
</code><p>

I hear you thinking, "but sureley the test suite would have caught that".. but if you're smart you don't bring that up to my face ;)<p>

I'll try and refrain myself from rants on the tar-format but trust me, it's really quite screwy.<br>It feels much like a '512 bytes should be enough for everyone'-quote<p>

In the end I decided a complete rewrite was probably best, since every bug fix on the old code made me find two more bugs.<p>

So right now, there's a totally rewritten version on the <a href="http://search.cpan.org/author/KANE/Archive-Tar-0.99_06/">CPAN</a> which should be fixing all these nasty things.<p>

I invite everyone to bash it some, so we can hopefully take out all the bugs, and <a href='http://search.cpan.org/src/KANE/Archive-Tar-0.99_06/README'>enjoy the new features</a><p>

[0] I hope you don't either, but if you <a href='http://www.geocrawler.com/archives/3/379/2000/6/0/3944573/'>must know</a></p>

<h2>Bravery</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Ovid/">Ovid</a> on 2003-05-13T21:23:42</h3>
<p>You're a braver man than I.  I have spotted more than one unmaintained module on the CPAN that I've thought about volunteering to fix, but I chickened out.  Nice job!</p>

<p>And in the unlikely event that you're ever in this neck of the woods again, give me a shout.  I don't think I bought you any beer last time<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:( (and I just realizedy how many of my posts seem to mention beer<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...)</p>

Bravery or stupidity? I keep being undecided<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<p>

Although, I have received quite a few thank-you mails, so it's somewhat rewarding.</p><p>

I suggest, in the interest of timely beer drinking, we move this event to this coming <a href="http://yapc.org/Europe" title="yapc.org">Yapc::EU</a yapc.org>, if you can at all make it<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)</p>

<h2>Win32</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/bart/">bart</a> on 2003-05-13T23:03:46</h3>
Will it work on Win32?
<p>The reason I ask, is because the old Archive::Tar used fcntl(), to duplicate a filehandle for example, which works on Unix etc., but not on Win32. That's why Win32 users were stuck with version 0.072.
</p><p>I hope life will get better, for these poor marginalised programmers, as well.</p>

The short answer would be 'yes, it will work on win32 now'.<p>
You don't want the long answer<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)</p>

<h2>Re:Win32</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/bart/">bart</a> on 2003-05-14T10:03:09</h3>
But I do! I often wondered: why are these file handles duped, in the first place?
<p>Oh, and one more thing... I often find people (on Perlmonks, for example) wish to use a tied handle, or another non-standard handle, with this module, and this module rejects that, for the same reason, really. Will that work, now, too?</p>

<h2>Re:Win32</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/kane/">kane</a> on 2003-05-14T12:46:28</h3>
It's not supported as a filehandle as such, but there's other ways to do it ($tar-&gt;add_data is probably your friend).<p>

The reason for this is simple -- to keep everything managable,  I use IO::File and IO::Zlib under the hood, which saves a lot of overhead and keeps for a standard interface. <br>
So if those modules don't supported tied filehandles, neither will Archive::Tar.</p>
