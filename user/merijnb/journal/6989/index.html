<p>Battled somewhat with my new wireless setup. DSL at home since three weeks, which is just great. Missing part was the wireless connection, a 5 meter cat5 is no substitute. <br/><br/>Enter the Belkin wireless PC card. Plug it in the linux laptop and it just works. Amazing. Ok, when I compiled the kernel I compiled the modules for the most likely card, but still, it just worked. Things are not supposed to be like that under Linux. I always have a list of 10 things to straighten out, and after working on it the list has grown. <br/><br/>The router from Belkin is a different story. Turned out I probably could have done better with the simple access point instead of the router, but it was the same price, so what else is one to do?. Can't however get the thing to be a simple bridge, it insists on doing NAT or other routing. Managed to get myself locked out twice, to the point that the thing did not react to any connection.<br/><br/>It only is configurable via a web interface, no console port and the rest button only resets, though the FAQ on the website says it returns to the factory settings. Flip. Turns out that holding down the reset button for 7 (> 5 and < 10) seconds  does so. Grrr. Thanks Belkin for making me think I had a nice paperweight. <br/><br/>So now I let it do its thang, and my laptop is a 192.168 ip. Mmmmm, shame of my lovely static ips. <br/><br/>Also found out the laptop support for a thinkpad under Linux is too good. Unplug the power, sit down on the couch, the whole machine is sluggish. 
WTF? Turns out the processor powers down to 66Mhz.
