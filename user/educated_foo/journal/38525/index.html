<p>In response to chromatic's latest maunderings, there's a reason that the Perl core heeds "the DarkPAN" -- it's the same reason that "the DarkPAN" is still written in Perl.  Language implementors have no obligation to maintain backward compatibility, just like language users have no obligation to keep using a language.  It's "insane" to think that a script written for Perl 5.6 will work with Perl 5.10, just like it was "insane" to think that a script written to run on HPUX would run on AIX, Solaris, BSD, etc.  Perl is great because of its stability, and breaking that because... whatever it is you want... is insane.</p>

There was a long thread on p5p about regular releases for perl. I think this message is a good point to start reading (if I remember correctly):

It would be great if companies would give some money to TPF. If you look at the <a href="https://donate.perlfoundation.org/index.pl?node=Fund%20Drive%20Status" title="perlfoundation.org">donations page</a perlfoundation.org> of the perlfoundation site, you'll see that there are not that many big donations (I know that <a href="http://www.hsyndicate.org/news/4039070.html" title="hsyndicate.org">booking.com gave $50,000 to TPF last year</a hsyndicate.org> - thanks!

Nevertheless TPF gave a <a href="http://news.perlfoundation.org/2008/11/tpf_announces_grant_to_david_m.html" title="perlfoundation.org">grant to Dave Mitchell for releasing Perl 5.10.1</a perlfoundation.org>.</p>

And it is a major reason that I no longer follow Parrot or Perl 6.  It's too much trouble to keep up with the constant API and language changes.

<p>...and that "full Perl 6" keeps changing, and that Parrot internals (PBC, PMCs, IMCC, etc.) do as well.  If Perl 5 had regular bug-fixing and feature-adding releases, but kept its current level of stability and backward compatibility, that would be great.  Regular Parrot-style "break-stuff" releases... not so much.</p><p>Parrot/Rakudo/Perl6 is pre-alpha software.  There's nothing wrong with that -- everything was pre-alpha at some point, and indeed pre-alpha projects can be fun -- but Parrot's being in that state places certain demands on developers, and makes it hard to build upon.  The stability of things like libc, POSIX, and Perl 5 makes them easy to build upon, and making them unstable in the name of "modernity" undermines that value.</p>

<p>I've been watching how some other projects manage this kind of stuff, and I have a few thoughts.</p><p>First, you were doing maint releases, and backporting from dev into maint. I dont think that many projects have high frequency maint releases, in most projects maint releases are instead "just enough for the release to not be a problem" and only made as absolutely necessary.  If a project has high frequency releases its at the bleading edge not in maint.</p><p>Second, IMO backporting from dev to maint AT ALL only makes sense if dev and maint are relatively in sync. The further ahead dev gets, the more likely that you have to major work to back port a patch.</p><p>Now it seems to me that doing regular dev releases is MUCH less of a burden that doing regular maint releases.  I would hypothesize as well that regular dev releases would make it eaiser for maint to stay synced themselves. As smaller dev releases would mean more major versions, and more major versions would mean that the bleading edge would tend to be closer in terms of code to its predecessors, which in turn should reduce the back port burden of important fixes.</p><p>So I guess while I am not going to argue with you about the burden of our current processes, its not clear to me that it isn't a self fulfilling prophecy.  There would be no reason to do heavy work in a maint track if the dev track was moving faster.</p><p>Personally Im inclined to think we could accelerate our dev releases a LOT. In fact I think one is long overdue already. Although I know perfectly well how busy Rafael is and that rolling a release right now is probably not something he really wants to do I am somewhat of the opinion that we should make sure that we have all the major platforms passing test for a few days and announce 5.11.1 as soon as we can. And then do our best to announce 5.11.2 soon after. Who cares if that means that we do a LOT of minor releases in the 5.11 line. At some point or another well decide its good enought to go out the door, and we wont be talking about maintaining 5.10 well be talking about maintaining 5.12.</p><p>Anyway, I guess my point is that making the caboose more efficient isnt going to make a train faster. Making the engine go faster will. And we<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/can/ make the engine go much faster in dev if we choose. Pretty much as simply as saying "today is 5.11.1 day". Its a blead release, who cares if it breaks here and there. Thats what they are for.</p><p>Would I be correct in thinking that leaving the quality of the latest blead aside that to release 5.11.1 is a matter of creating a tag, rolling and uploading a CPAN bundle and sending out an email?</p><p>Yves</p>

<p>One problem with this approach as being a "viable" upgrade cycle for deprecations is that you and I might upgrade regularly, incrementally and pay lots of attention to point releases, but businesses generally don't.  They stay at 5.6.1 for many years and then gird themselves for a jump to 5.8.8.  Thus, your nifty "four releases a year" means nothing to them.  They don't <em>dare</em> upgrade their perl in parallel with those four releases (that would be very foolish of them), but they wait too long between releases (for the same reason they delay some developers paying back technical debt).</p><p>I'm not arguing for or against this behavior on the part of many businesses (but it's not as insane as people think), but it's pretty common behavior in most businesses I've either worked at or consulted at.  "18 months from now" means nothing to them.</p>

<p>But those people will have the same problems with regular releases as they have now. Jumping from 5.6.1 to 5.8.8 (or 5.10.0) is a big deal with the current release system. If there were time-based releases, jumping across a huge number of releases will _still_ be a big deal.</p><p>In both cases, you'll have to test all your code very carefully. You may also just give up and not upgrade.</p><p>I've heard about Morgan Stanley's environment where the basically have apps deployed on every single version of Perl, and each app has its own set of modules.</p><p>That sounds crazy in some respects, but it's not all bad.

I have no idea.  How many of my programs are easier to use because it

Mostly because the Perl VM is complicated.  I have used both XS and
