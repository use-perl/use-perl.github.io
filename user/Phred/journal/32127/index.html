<p><p>Dear Lazyweb,</p>
<p>Recently my trusty old linux book died so I started coding on a macbook pro.  I've found iTerm to be a great addition to my toolkit, but I haven't been able to get the sweet Perl development environment I had in Linux.</p>
<p>When I was using Linux I had Vim hacked up to do everything I needed.  I started to get symptoms of RSI from the repetitive key banging so I took up Emacs again and tricked it out with perlnow and other extensions.  I used both editors, and like cross training in sports, I got a better workout.</p>
<p>But when I switched to developing on the Mac, I didn't have the full functionality of both my tricked out editors under iTerm, or even the mac Terminal.  I tried Aquamacs but the standard tricks I had for invoking the debugger, etc. didn't work off the shelf (although I'm still really impressed by it and use it often).  I tried TextMate, but it doesn't have the power of Vim or Emacs.  Am I being too demanding here?</p>
<p>What are you using to do Perl development on OS X?  Have you found the 'perfect setup'?</p></p>

Hi,<br><br>after I switched five years ago, i also had a tough time with vim and mac os x. I ended up compiling vim from source (at the time with 10.1 it was a mess...), but I got it to work.<br><br>Now, I switched to textmate, because I had a hard time making vim6 understand unicode in mac os x. I've grown accustomed to textmate snippets (I think there is a vim package now for something similar), and I'm happy.<br><br>it took a while to drop vim key sequences from the brain, being there for more than 10 years now, but I'm happy with textmate.<br><br>regarding the rest of the environment, I use the stock perl because is good enough for what I do, and unless you really need more recent features, I would suggest you do the same, less hassle.<br><br>I do have a recent perl stashed somewhere in<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/opt to test somethings, though.<br><br>Best regards,

<p>Just so you know...there is already a Vim7 package for OSX:</p>

<a href="http://macvim.org/OSX/index.php" title="macvim.org">http://macvim.org/OSX/index.php</a macvim.org>

<p>There are also suggestions for tweaks there as well. That probably wasn't the case 5 years ago though.</p>

<h2>Editor setup</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/educated_foo/">educated_foo</a> on 2007-01-12T13:05:58</h3>
I use GNU Emacs from CVS (the "carbon emacs package" on the Apple site is similar) with Sepia and about a decade's worth of<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.emacs hackery, and it was a narly-painless transition from Linux.  I tried Aquamacs and found, while the font handling is better, most of the other changes are painful and break my customizations.  I can't help you on the Vim side.



<h2>BBEdit, currently.</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/DAxelrod/">DAxelrod</a> on 2007-02-06T21:46:29</h3>
<p>I currently use and am very cozy in <a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/" title="barebones.com">BBEdit</a barebones.com> (extended quite a bit with scripts I've written), and have heard nice things about <a href="http://macromates.com/" title="macromates.com">TextMate</a macromates.com>, but haven't had a chance to check out TextMate yet.</p>

<p>If you're looking for more of an IDE, consider <a href="http://www.latenightsw.com/affrus/index.html" title="latenightsw.com">Affrus</a latenightsw.com> (<a href="http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2004/05/14/affrus.html" title="perl.com">review</a perl.com>), which I also have not personally used.</p>

Also, fontwise, use Monaco. 9 point aliased is pure bliss, but bigger is good too depending on your screen size.

Responding to a month old journal entry. You've probably already found a set up that you like, but I thought I'd respond anyway.<br/><br/>There are lots of versions of Emacs for OS X out there. I tried several, but I wasn't really happy with any of them. So I used Darwinports to compile a recent, not-yet-released version of Emacs from the GNU CVS repository. Because I was coming from Linux, I configured it to use X11 for windowing. The result was an Emacs that works and looks exactly like Emacs on Linux. I definitely recommend checking out Darwinports, or fink another popular open source packaging system on OS X. I prefer Darwinports personally, but fink is more popular.<br/><br/>You could also use either Darwinports or fink to install a recent version of vim as well.<br/><br/>Hope this helps!
