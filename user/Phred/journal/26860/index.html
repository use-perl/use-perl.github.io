<p><p>I host my own mail, and mail for several of my friends, as well as some small clients.  Lots of these people like to put their email addresses up o the web unprotected (like me).  I've been using <a href="http://smtpd.develooper.com">Qpsmtpd</a> to manage smtp services, and along with Spamassassin it has been doing an excellent job of keeping the spam volume down.  I initially gave myself a point for that.</p>
<p>However over the past couple of months the volume has steadily been increasing and getting to the point where Spamassassin wasn't stopping everything, and I would get at least a dozen spams a day.  So I gave up a point to the spammers.</p>
<p>Now Qpsmtpd has a greylist plugin written by Gavin Carr, but I haven't been able to implement it because I have users who can't deal with the fact that this would mean their mail would be delayed by at least 300 seconds.  I, however, can't deal with the spam.  So I needed domain specific greylisting.  This is where perl comes in.</p>
<p>In less than 30 minutes, I was able to add domain specific greylists functionality to the existing greylist plugin.  My config/plugins directory now contains the line:</p>
<pre>denysoft_greylist domains redhotpenguin.com|taperfriendlymusic.org</pre>
<p>And in the greylist plugin:</p>
<pre>
my $domains = $config->{domains};
my $host = $rcpt->host;
unless ( $host =~ m/$domains/ ) {
  return DECLINED;
}
# continue with greylist plugin
</pre>
<p>Simple eh?  This has cut the existing spam volume down by 90% at least, while allowing my other hosted domains to receive mail normally.  One point for me, thanks to Perl.</p></p>

Hi There,<br/><br/>I was looking for this (your greylist domain trick) but it seems that this doesn't work over here..<br/><br/>I am not a perl programmer!<br/><br/>Eval Global symbol "$config" requires explicit package name at<nobr> <wbr></nobr>./plugins/greylisting<br/><br/>Do you know what is happening !
