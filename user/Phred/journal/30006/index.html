<p><p>Back in San Francisco and on PST again after a week on the road for the <a href="http://www.perlworkshop.no/npw2006/">2006 Nordic Perl Workshop</a>.  What an adventure.  I spent 24 hours going from SF to Boston to Reykjavik to Oslo.  Took the FlyTog (express train) from Oslo International to Oslo, found the accomodations, grabbed lunch and a beer, and slept off the jet lag for 6 hours.  Took the subway to the workshop the next day and Trond Michelsen was kind enough to loan me a 240/110 volt transformer to power my laptops.</p>
<p>I spent the next day Thursday at the conference listening to the <a href="http://www.perlworkshop.no/npw2006/talks">talks</a> and finishing up my presentations for Friday.  There was a barbeque the first night and I stayed there til 11 pm in the northern night light hanging out with some folks from various .pms.  The next day I gave <a href="http://www.perlworkshop.no/npw2006/user/798">my first conference talks</a>.  My laptop couldn't power the projector, so Kai Dressen was kind enough to loan me his laptop for the presentations.  The talks went well, I got some good feedback on the work I've been doing with Qpsmtpd and Apache::Dispatch.  It's amazing how much work it takes to get one presentation together, let alone two, and then get up there in front of an audience and talk about it, everyone I've seen always made it look so easy.</p>
<p>Had dinner Friday night with the rest of the speakers, and the organizers.  Got to meet Schwern and brian d foy at the dinner.  Saturday and Sunday I had time off and visited parts of the city, and ended up at the beach Saturday afternoon.  Left Sunday night, spent the night in a hotel in Reykjavik on an 18 hour layover in Iceland.  I got to see a bit of the city and go for a swim in the thermal pools.  Also a city that should be on your list to visit for more than a day.  Got back 48 hours ago, straight to bed to catch up with the time difference and recover from traveling, and back to work yesterday morning.  Still a bit tired, and it was a lot of work, but the guys from Oslo.pm put on a great conference.  It was very professional, there was a lot of attention to detail, and everyone had a good time.    Hope I can do it again next year!</p></p>
