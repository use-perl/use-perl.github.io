<p><p>I'm running on about 4 hours sleep in the past 36 hours coming out here to Atlanta, Georgia from San Francisco for ApacheCon.  I got to the hotel today and made my way to the hackathon.  I managed to find Gozer, and discussed with him some issues I was running into separating Apache::Reload from the mod_perl core codebase.  The issue at hand was how to factor out the test code which causes the same mod_perl interpreter to be used for sequential requests.  The existing code that does this (TestCommon::SameInterp) uses an http header and then repeatedly sends requests to the Apache::Test server until it receives the same interpreter.  Not ideal, and we brainstormed ways to get around that with something more elegant.</p>
<p>Paul Querna was sitting at the table next to ours, so we went over and Gozer picked his brain about the best way to do that.  He said that keep-alives turned on should do the trick, since that will force the same interpreter to be used for a given connection.  I initially tried that for this stuff, but I was still getting my feet wet with Apache::Test.  Gozer worked on getting keep-alives turned on for lwp requests, but somewhere in the Apache::Test guts the keep-alive settings were being overridden.</p>
<p>Right about that time Geoff Young showed up, and we told him what we were up to.  He told us how to issue the magic incantation (<pre>Apache::TestRequest::user_agent(keep_alive => 1);</pre>) to Apache::Test to make this work, and a few minutes later we (well mostly Gozer) had ported the cookie unit test to use keep-alives instead of the SameInterp code.  The resulting code was 2 lines shorter and makes testing a lot cleaner.  I managed to find one more line of code that wasn't needed, so the end result is net 3 lines negative.  Couldn't have accomplished this so fast without help from everyone, looking forward to tomorrow.</p></p>

Sorry I wasn't able to come out to ApacheCon this year. I went last year and you didn't make it, now I'm returning the favor<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br><br>Maybe next year we can rectify that...
