<p><p>I've been doing more mod_perl hacking of late, and have been running into the issue of diagnosing problems on different operating systems.</p>
<p>Parallels has basically failed me at this point.  I paid $99 for it initially, then they released 3.0 a few months later and wanted to charge me another $99 to upgrade.  Shortly after, my 2.x version started acting wonky, taking upwards of 10 minutes to start virtual machines, eating up all cpu in the process.</p>
<p>I called up VMWare a week ago and asked them if they had any discounts for open source developers using VMWare to do open source development.  The person I talked to didn't really understand what I was asking for, so it didn't pan out.  I've download a trial version of Fusion, and it has been working great.</p>
<p>So does anyone know of deals with virtualization environments for open source developers?  I can't promise that I would use the virtual machine code _only_ for open source development, but that is really what is driving my needs right now.</p></p>

I'm fond of VirtualBox from Sun (formerly Innotek). It works well for running debian and XP if you need it. It's free.

<p>I second the vote for VirtualBox. I use it for a bunch of WinXP images that let me test my web apps with Internet Explod^Hrer, and it&#8217;s been a nice no-nonsense experience so far.</p>

It sounds like qemu is ideal for your needs.<br><br>Because it's an emulator, it can run all sorts of different operating systems, sometimes of multiple types of emulated architectures.<br><br>It's by no means fast, you wouldn't want to do production environments with it, but it's still plenty fast enough that doing compatibility testing is quite reasonable.
