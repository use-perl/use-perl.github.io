<p><p>My accidental success, <a href="http://www.taperfriendlymusic.org">TaperFriendlyMusic.org</a>, came to an end today.  We provided legally tradeable music freely to anyone who wanted it through ftp and http interfaces.  We were fortunate to have the assistance of a few kind network adminstrators who provided us with a generous helping of bandwidth on a university campus.</p>
<p>For over 7 years, we provided a source of fast downloads for legal music traders.  Yesterday however we popped up on the campus NOC's radar, and they promptly paid a visit to our host and disconnected us.  I'm thankful for the time we had.</p>
<p>I got to exercise some great Perl muscles in the form of Slash, mod_perl, mogilefs, and Perlbal.  I spent countless hours reconfiguring the server and adding drives (at peak we were over 1 TB storage), and hacking Perl to support it.  The kind letters from the users motivated me (well hacking Perl was fun too).</p>
<p>All good things must come to an end though.  Who knows, maybe a music fan with a spare 100MB line will show up at my doorstep.  Dare to dream :)</p></p>

<h2>&quot;taper friendly music&quot;?</h2>

The previous blog entry on that site says "We've been going strong for over 7 years, have been the number one site on Google for taper friendly music". Duh? Who uses the phrase "taper friendly music" anyway? I had never heard of it before. So of course it is easy to be #1 on Google that way.<br><br>Use a more popular term, and you'll find it much harder to be #1.



<h2>Bittorrent?</h2>

Why not switch to Bittorrent?

<p>We had a fast connection, and most of the users weren't very technical, so http and ftp downloads ended up being the most popular.  But maybe it's time to change it up a bit and try the torrent approach.</p>
