<p><p>Today I was asked about scaling mod_perl to handle really big loads.  They mentioned the possible direction of a J2EE solution.</p>
<p>Now I didn't have any statistics handy to back why mod_perl can scale, but I after mentioning that mod_perl runs Slashdot.org, and TicketMaster.com, I made a bold statment:</p>
<p>"I'd wager my career that mod_perl can scale as well as any other technology."</p>
<p>The response?</p>
<p>[laughter]"Would you put that in writing?"[/laughter]</p>
<p>In this journal entry I hereby make good on my answer of yes to that question :)</p></p>

<h2>we've had no problems scaling perl</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/TeeJay/">TeeJay</a> on 2005-09-28T09:30:46</h3>
..in fact there is no reason you should - the hard part is designing a scalable system rather than the language you choose.<br><br>the only times that the choice of language or platform has been a problem as been with some ASP applications I have had the ill luck to work on (not design, or develop I hasten to add)



<h2>A talk you really really want to find</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Alias/">Alias</a> on 2005-09-28T12:36:11</h3>
Someone from Yahoo was at OSCON, giving a talk called "How to serve a billion pages a day with Perl" or something similar to that.<br><br>He gave a great overview of all the different methods you can use to scale the application. Which ones work, which ones don't. And which order to persue them in.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... pause...<br><br>actually, I managed to find the overview<br><br>When: 7:30 PM, Wednesday, July 20th, 2005<br><br>Where: ActiveState/Sophos, 580 Granville Street, Vancouver, BC<br><br>Speaker: Kevin Scaldeferri<br><br>Topic: How to Serve a Billion Requests a Day with Perl<br><br>This presentation discusses the challenges of building complex services<br>that can handle very high query rates with low latency and high<br>availability. Overture, the sponsored search division of Yahoo!, has<br>developed a number of systems that have successfully scaled over several<br>orders of magnitude in both data volume and query rate, and Scaldeferri<br>will discuss the ideas behind some of these. General topics covered will<br>include:<br><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * Caching using local and distributed caches<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * When and how to distribute your application across multiple<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; machines<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * Use of asynchronous communication techniques to increase<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; throughput and ensure acceptable response times<br><br>Scaldeferri also discusses the interplay between different levels of<br>abstraction, from high-level business logic, to practical Perl<br>programming, to low-level OS and hardware behavior, and how all of these<br>affect the design and architecture of such systems.<br><br>Bio: Kevin Scaldeferri is a lead developer at Yahoo!'s sponsored search<br>division, Overture, where he has spent the last three years taming an<br>ever-growing Perl code base that currently serves over one billion web<br>requests a day. His professional interests include programming languages<br>and software development practices. Outside work, he enjoys cooking,<br>reading, modern art, and "challenging" music.<br>

I was unable to attend OSCON this year but when I looked at the speaker summaries, this was one of the talks that jumped out at me.  I'd really like to attend it at some point, or peruse a written copy.  Thanks for the tip on that.

<h2>agree</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Qiang/">Qiang</a> on 2005-09-28T16:56:32</h3>
i agree with TeeJay. it's the part designing a scalable system more important than what language you choose.<br><br>Brad Fitzpatrick from livejournal gave a good talk on how they run a successful website. It's not only  about mysql but perl too.<br><a href="http://www.mysqluc.com/cs/mysqluc2005/view/e_sess/6257" title="mysqluc.com">http://www.mysqluc.com/cs/mysqluc2005/view/e_sess/6257</a mysqluc.com><br>talk available to download at the end of that page.<br><br>also, mod_perl website contains some nice doc on how to setup a scalable system with mod_perl.

<h3><a href="/user/Phred/">Phred</a> on 2005-09-28T23:51:34</h3>
I've implemented some of the open source LiveJournal tools such as MogileFS and Perlbal, and they've been working great at my current project.  That combined with parts of the Practical mod_perl book, the mod_perl website, and many other sources have given me the knowledge to scale it, and I've implemented those methodologies in a couple of places.

<h2>uh... Amazon?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/perrin/">perrin</a> on 2005-09-28T18:38:45</h3>
It's FastCGI, not mod_perl, but it's a huge site that most people have heard of and they use Perl (Mason specifically).

<p>/me smacks forehead in one of those "Why didn't I remember that at the time?" moments.</p>
<p>I dug into the mod_perl site docs last night and found <a href="http://perl.apache.org/outstanding/sites.html" title="apache.org">this link</a apache.org> of sites running mod_perl.  The question was more in the context of using Perl as the technology of choice though, so FastCGI, Mason, etc. are all relevant here.  I found <a href="http://www.masonhq.com/?MasonPoweredSites" title="masonhq.com">this link also about HTML::Mason powered sites</a masonhq.com>.</p>
<p>TicketMaster and Slashdot jumped to the front of my mind when the question was asked, but next time the question comes up I'll point them to this journal entry.</p>

I wrote a whole talk on this subject, mentioning Amazon and others, which I gave at OSCON and ApacheCon a couple of years ago.  I even have an article form of it written.  The only reason I haven't given it to perl.com yet is that the section on queue systems is kind of weak.  I was hoping to rewrite it when I put my queue system on CPAN, and since I haven't done that yet...
