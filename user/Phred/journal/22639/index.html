<p>Almost a year ago I attended the <a href="http://bignerdranch.com/about/postgres0105pr.shtml">PostgreSQL Boot Camp</a> at the <a href="http://bignerdranch.com">Big Nerd Ranch</a>.  There's another class coming up scheduled for January 17-21.<p>
At the time I attended, I had been using PostgreSQL for a little over four years.  Still, the depth of the curriculum and hands on training allowed me to take my expertise to the next level.  The class takes place at the historic Banning Mills lodge, which is about an hour south of Atlanta.  Five days of intense teaching and workshops span installing and configuring PostgreSQL, to tuning production installations and developing PostgreSQL based applications.  The pace is intense, but whether you are a newbie or have been using it for years, you are guaranteed to come away having learned quite a bit.<p>
The accomodations are first rate.  Single occupancy cabins are set along the bank of a mellow creek which offers exercise terrain for early risers.  The cuisine is also top notch - if you've never had sweet tea before you're missing out!<p>
Chris Campbell and Aaron Hillegass are seasoned PostgreSQL users and contributors to the project, and provide a collegiate level learning experience.  The curriculum has been developed over several years, and course materials, slides, and documentation are distributed on a CD as well as well as in hardcopy version.<p>
If your company is using PostgreSQL, I highly recommend attending.  It's a worthwhile experience regardless of your skill level, and a few days in the Georgia backcountry is something everyone should experience.</p>
