<p><p>Comcast decided to start blocking my smtp connections last week.  I had an amusing talk with the technical service rep.  I told him what had happened, and that they were firewalling port 25.  He responded that I needed to send all email through comcast's smtp server (and into their archive I'm sure), but they hadn't implemented any recent changes.  He suggested that I contact the Thunderbird corporation to ask for support.  I was really polite and explained to him that thunderbird was an open source email client - I think it worked partially, but trying to get my smtp access restored seems like a losing battle.  Back to pine on my server I guess, hopefully they won't firewall off 22 anytime soon :)</p></p>

<h2>Port 587</h2>

Have you tried 587?

<p>I have not - I was pretty unhappy yesterday about this, but I will probably compromise today and try it out<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)  I understand the spam concerns, but I pay for the line and should be able to use it as I see fit.</p>

Yeah, <i>you</i> should be able to use it as you see fit.  Unfortunately, for 97% of America out there running windows on home Comcast lines, they're running Windows and are running zombies, and I for one, am <i>very happy</i> that Comcast is blocking port 25 outbound, and wonder why they didn't start sooner.

<p>Ok 587 is working great now with a change to my qpsmtpd configuration<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)  I wonder how long before the spammers start flooding that port...</p>

<h2>Clarification</h2>

They blocked port 25 served off of your cable modem, or they blocked your <i>outgoing</i> requests to port 25 on some server on the interwebs?<br>
<br>
Both are retarded and obnoxious, though #1 is a well known policy, blocking #2 though.... sigh.

#2 is also very common.

<h2>ssh can rescue smtp</h2>

Since you mention pine and 22<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.... If you have a colo or other server not on Comtastic, as long as 22 is open, ssh port tunnelling should allow you to hang thunderbird off that host unbeknownst to comtastic. My Zaurus uses this to download/upload email securely via insecure wifi, connecting to my public isp shell acount; would probably work with my gmail now too.<p><blockquote> <div><tt>ssh -L2110:pop.hostname.com -L2025:smtp.hostname.com:25 -l myid shell.hostname.com &amp;</tt></div> </blockquote> Add -2 for safety if neither end prevents proto v1.
OpenSSH may need -n and -N, but busybox version doesn't.
