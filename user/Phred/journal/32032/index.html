<p><p>I was getting ready to go see some music last night in preparation for the New Year when I got the call from work.  "Hey Fred, there's a problem with the mission critical application that keeps our business running."  Ugh.</p>
<p>Logged in, checked out the issue.  Class::DBI was failing on a retrieve with id -2147483547.  Huh?  A negative object id?  I'm pretty good with numbers, and that number looked damn close to 2**32/2, probably comes from my days writing Assembler and C.  I got a sinking feeling in my gut that there was a serious problem in our codebase that I wouldn't be able to fix easily.  Was this a y2.007k-1 bug?</p>
<p>I dug through the call stack and after some furious debugging found that the object id was being changed from 2147483749 to -2147483547 between two components.  Oh great, a 32 bit int bug in our application framework.  Fun.</p>
<p>After a few more minutes of hacking, I was at a loss.  Then I looked at the way the component was being called:<p>
<pre>
<% 'foo.cmp', obj_id => sprintf("OBJ_%d", $obj_id) %>
</pre>
<p>Hrm.  I'm not that familiar with the guts of perl, but... could it possibly be that sprintf was using a signed int?</p>
<pre>
phred@pooky ~ $ perl -e 'print sprintf("foo %d", 2147483749);'
foo -2147483547
</pre>
<p>Phew!!  I gave ops the good news and replaced the sprintf with a more sane quoting operator.  I guess whoever wrote that sprintf didn't figure we'd ever process over 2 billion objects!</p>
<p>My quest was not done yet.  I went into my copy of 5.8.8 source, hunted around a bit, and then found:</p>
<pre>
int PerlIO_sprintf(char *s, int n, const char *fmt, ...)

/* quick definition of c int type added for the lazy rusty C reader */
int    4      32   -2,147,483,648 -> +2,147,483,647   ( 2Gb)
</pre>
There it is.  Is it a bug?  Depends on your point of view I guess.  I would have to say no - we are using a 32 bit platform, so something like sprintf should be expected to behave that way.  All in all, things ended a lot better than I expected.  Looks like I'll be able to go see music tonight :)</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Happy New Year!</p></p>

Doubling the number of items in a database is not a farfetched thought, so you should reconsider: what happens when you will get to the magic value of 4 billion (4*1024**3)? What will the database do? Class::DBI? And if it's a big issue, how will you fix it?
<p>The problem might be far more serious then, than the easily fixed issue now. Now might be a good time to test that, now that the problem is still fresh in your mind.
</p><p>I am guessing it'll take roughly the same amount of time to get to that point, as the app has been in use already. So, you have a reasonable estimate how much time you have left to fix it.</p>
