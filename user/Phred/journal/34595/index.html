<p><p>I was out for a quick walk to take a break from coding tonight when I saw the 1-800-GOOG-411 billboard.  I couldn't resist trying it out, so I dialed the number and said 'San Francisco, California' when it asked for my location.  When it asked what I was looking for I said 'beer'.</p>
<p>There was about five seconds of computing noise (you know, like in the movies), and it said 'Piercing - is that what you were looking for?'.  I chuckled briefly and said 'go back', and repeated my query.  'Pier - is that what you were looking for?'.  On the third query I got 'Theatre'.</p>
<p>Judging from the responses to my query, it's obvious that this service was tested by someone other than the engineers :)</p></p>

<p>But if that were the case, wouldn't a 404 or 403 response be more appropriate?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>
