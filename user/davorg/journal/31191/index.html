<p><p>Here's a link to <a href="http://del.icio.us/tag/perl">all URLs on del.icio.us tagged "perl"</a>. It's a sobering experience to watch it for a few days. It gives you an idea of the information about Perl that people are finding out there on the web. A lot of it is out of date and contains information that was, at best, dubious when it was first published.</p>

<p>For example, today I saw that someone had bookmarked the homepage for cgi-lib.pl - which hasn't been updated since 1998.</p>

<p>Is there anything that we can do to help people find current and useful links to Perl information - rather than the dodgy old links that they seem to be finding?</p></p>

<h2>Weekly links on Perl.it</h2>

It's not directly intended to improve the quality of Perl-related links on delicious, but I use it to collect the links I post every week on Perl.it's blog. Each of these links is tagged both with <tt>perl</tt> and <tt>perlit</tt> tags.



<h2>del.icio.us use</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jordan/">jordan</a> on 2006-10-03T00:02:15</h3>
I use del.icio.us heavily and I want to point out that bookmarking something there is not necessarily an indication of approval or value, sometimes, I bookmark things for reference.<br><br>That being said, if you want to improve overall quality of perl-tagged links on del.icio.us, I have a few suggestions:<br><br>- Bookmark good Perl links.<br>- Recommend those you know to bookmark them.<br>- Follow those people who find and post good Perl links (make them part of your network) and copy their better links.<br>- Bookmark the BAD Perl links, but add a tag 'bad-perl-practices' or something.  Let's come up with a good common tag for this and use it consistently.  Conversely, some links are very good (not just references) and could get a tag 'best-perl-practices'.

The first three suggestions are natural, the last one (bookmark bad links and tag them with bad_perl_pratice ou decrepated_perl_practice) is not. So may be the last one is the one we should pay more attention to.

Keep it simple: use the tags "badperl" and "goodperl".
