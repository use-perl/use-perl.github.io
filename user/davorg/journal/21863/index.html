This is a really old (albeit rather good) Perl tutorial written in Russian. I remember reading it in 1997 or so. It is available in many places on the Net and was even published on paper several years ago.



<h2>perl knowledge base</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/TeeJay/">TeeJay</a> on 2004-11-16T11:20:54</h3>
is there an appropriate place that links to perl tutorials, slides, documentation?
<p>
I know there are pages that link to each of training, perl.com, etc but no central site where I can search for any information on say using worldpay with perl or sending email.
</p><p>
I'd be interested in setting something like this up but don't have the capacity to host it, I contacted ask about organising a cabal to overhaul and manage the websites but got no reply. The TPF site still doesn't mention the LPW or any events in 2005 even tho we only have a couple of months left of 2004.
</p><p>
my vision for a perl knowledge base would include both a directory of courses (not just the usual suspects), tutorials, articles, books, talks, etc. There is a lot of information out there scattered in places people don't often look - DDJ for instance, or the defunct perlmonth, as well as the mailing lists, faqs, pods YAPC or tech talks, etc. There are also courses at Further and Higher Ed as well as corporate training by people like GBdirect.
</p><p>
There is also a huge overlap with perl and other technology like apache, linux, databases that would mean including relevent documentation on those subjects, as somebody familiar with perl or programming may not know where to find out about what they are interacting with using perl.
</p><p>
I would be prepared to put in a couple of hours a week to keep it running, I already try and keep the london.pm tech talks page up to date.

I've always found the <a href="http://perlmonks.org/?node=Tutorials" title="perlmonks.org">Perlmonks tutorial page</a perlmonks.org> an excellent resource, and I regularly give our students a whirlwind tour of Perlmonks after class.  Perlmonks links to some external content, but it's by no means a comprehensive list.
</p> <p>
One way of making resources more visible (even if it doesn't form a comprehensive site) is to add them to <a href="http://dmoz.org/" title="dmoz.org">The Open Directory Project</a dmoz.org>, which forms the basis of categorized directories for Google and many other search engines.

That is better than nothing, but it misses so much like courses, tech talks, lists, etc.
<p>
Some kind of knowledge base that people can add courses, talks, etc would be good.
