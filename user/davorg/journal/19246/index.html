<div class="span8">
<p>I got an email telling me about <a href="http://sitememory.com/">sitememory.com</a>. It's a centralised bookmark service. I can store my bookmarks there and access them from any computer that I use. This is a pretty good idea. So good, in fact, that I recently implemented something similar of my own.<br/><br/>But, hey, if someone else wants to maintain and enhance the system I'm happy to use that instead of my own code. So I registered and started looking at it.<br/><br/>The registration process takes you thru a set-up wizard. As part of the process it offers to import your already existing bookmarks. Without thinking too hard about it, I tried it out. I wasn't too surprised to see that nothing got imported. "Oh well", I thought, "another site that forgets that some people don't use IE" and I fired off an email to the owners suggesting that they look at making their bookmark import code compatible with other browsers.<br/><br/>Half an hour later I go to use one of my bookmarks. To find that it isn't there. In fact, none of my bookmarks are there. The sitememory code that failed to import my bookmarks into their database has successfully deleted them all.<br/><br/>So I sent another (slightly more strongly worded) email to the owners. But I'm posting this as a warning. If you're trying out sitememory.com on a non-IE browser then <i>don't</i> try to import your bookmarks.</p>

<h2>del.icio.us</h2>

<p>I prefer <a href="http://del.icio.us/" title="del.icio.us">del.icio.us</a del.icio.us> for all of my bookmarking needs.  Even if you don't consider the social aspects of it, it's a very useful service.  It also has an API so that you can automatically import existing bookmarks and such.</p>

I like the idea of del.icio.us, but I'd prefer to run my own internal version for our company.  Is it open source?  I couldn't find the link...

I don't believe del.icio.us is open source, but I'm sure <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=3645" title="sourceforge.net">Unalog</a sourceforge.net> is.  The <a href="http://unalog.mine.nu/" title="unalog.mine.nu">original Unalog</a unalog.mine.nu> site is available.  Unfortunately, it's in Python, not our beloved Perl.

<h2>SiteMemory problems</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/sitememory/">sitememory</a> on 2004-06-16T00:27:26</h3>
Hi Dave,<br/><br/>I work for SiteMemory support and found your journal entry whilst aimlessly googling<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.. anyway, that's irrelevant.<br/><br/>I just thought i'd let you know that I did actually reply to your messages shortly after they arrived, but I got a bounceback from your e-mail address. I've sent them again.<br/><br/>No idea so far why your browser lost its favourites<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-( We are still trying to work out why/how this could have happened.<br/><br/>Sorry for the inconvenience.
