<div class="span8">
<p>No Perl content, but I hope that someone here can help me.<br/><br/>In June my stepdaughter went to see the Red Hot Chili Peppers play in Hyde Park. A live album from these gigs was released a couple a weeks ago. She hasn't yet bought a copy of the album.<br/><br/>Then today she gets a call from the friend who went to the gig with her. Apparently someone else (a friend of a friend - so it all gets a bit dubious) has got a copy of the Italian version of CD and on the cover there is a photo of them at the gig.<br/><br/>Now the UK version of the CD has a picture of the lead singers tattoos on the front cover, so I don't know if this photo is on the inside of the packaging or if it's actually a different cover in Italy.<br/><br/>I've tried searching for scans of the cover on the web but can't find anything other than the front cover that I've seen before. So what I was wondering was perhaps some of you have got copies of the CD and you could perhaps take a photo or scan it so that I can have a look to see how the various countries' covers differ.<br/><br/>And if someone in Italy could post a link to an Italian online record shop that sells this CD, that would be great too.<br/><br/>Thanks for your help.</p>

<p>I am not in Italy in August, but if you want me to bring the CD to YAPC::EU in September, just let me know.</p>
