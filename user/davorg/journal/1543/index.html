<p><p>Yesterday I finished the last set of training courses
that I'll do at Acxiom. For the last four weeks I've been
training four afternoons a week. It's been hard work, but
enjoyable.</p>
<p>Today I got copies of the assessment sheets back from
the students. The Acxiom assessment sheet asks people to
assess the course in a number of areas and score them from
1 (crap) to 5 (great). In the past I've always got lots
of 4s and 5s, with the occasional 3. This time the pattern
was repeated with one exception. For the question "Were
you able to relate the information presented to your own
job?" someone has given me a score of 1. I guess that's 
the VB programmer that I mentioned a couple of weeks 
ago.</p>

<p>Still no news on the job front. I've started applying
for permie jobs :(</p>

<p>Oh, and to prove that I'm not a complete Scrooge about
xmas (and to briefly tie in with Piers' <a href="http://use.perl.org/journal.pl?op=display&uid=485&id=1534">discussion</a> of folk music), can I just point out that one of my favourite xmas songs is Steeleye Span's version of of "Gaudete". For those of you who don't know it, it's a very old Latin christmas carol which they sing acapella. The chorus goes:</p>
<blockquote><i>Gaudete, gaudete<br>
Christus est natus<br>
Ex Maria virginea<br>
Gaudete</i></blockquote>
<p>The translation is left as an exercise for the 
reader :)</p></p>

<h2>Translation</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Odud/">Odud</a> on 2001-12-07T12:49:02</h3>
Rejoice, rejoice
<br>Christ is born
<br>of the Virgin Mary
<br>Rejoice

Ooh look, Dave's celebrating the birth of the Lickle Baby Jesus after all.

<h2>Oops</h2>

And then I go back and reread the original journal article and start looking embarrassed.<br/><br/>Pudge! Where's the withdraw button on this thing?

<h2>VB</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/chaoticset/">chaoticset</a> on 2001-12-07T15:57:22</h3>
If a VB junkie implied he couldn't relate something I taught him to his job, I would take that as a compliment.  (But, that's me.)
