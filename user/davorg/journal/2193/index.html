<p><p>Well hardly. But I <i>have</i> been swimming.</p>

<p>I went on Monday and it was torture. If I ever wanted to prove to myself that I'm not as fit as I used to be, then swimming would be a great way to do it. I used to swim regularly. I used to be good at it. But for some reason I stopped over five years ago.</p>

<p>And it really showed. I really struggled to do 20 lengths. And it hurt. The next day I was in pain all over. Which, I guess, means it's doing some good. Right?</p>

<p>But I persevered and went back again today. And it seemed easier. Which is a demonstration of either my body's ability to rebuilt itself of my mind's ability to delude itself.</p>

<p>I know which one my money's on.</p></p>

I love swimming, but the word, to me, means "floating on your back and watching the ceiling move past you".  I never understood why my mother recommended it for exercise.
<p>
Well, my SOTF was a swimmer in HS competition, and when she got in the water, naturally, goaded me into attempting lengths.  I could always beat her on one length's worth of speed, but I couldn't do another one for fifteen minutes or so.

I have the cardiovascular efficiency of a dead racoon.</p>
