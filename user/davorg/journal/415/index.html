<p><p>Been a while since I wrote anything here, doesn't time
fly? So what's been happening...</p>

<p>We had another london.pm social meeting. It all got a
bit out of hand. I think this wasn't helped by the people
who'd been to Linux Expo in the afternoon. Apparently the
Expo was very small and it only took them ten minutes to
see everything there. They then spent the rest of the 
afternoon in the pub.</p>

<p>Had an Iterative meeting this week. The main result was
that Iterative are now sponsoring YAPC::Europe - so at
least we'll get our name around a bit more.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk">Guardian</a>
have said they'll be happy to look at any article that I
send them about OSCON. I'll probably try to write something
based around the Craig Mundie talk.</p>

<p>I (finally) bought myself a laptop to take to the 
conferences. No I've got about a week to install all the
software I want on it.</p>

<p>Finished reading <i>CGI Programming 101</i>. It's not a 
bad book, but there are some pretty nasty errors in there.
I need to get a report back to the author soon. Maybe I'll
write that on the flight to San Diego.</p>

<p>DMP went to a second printing. I'd probably be very
excited if I knew how big the first printing was.</p>

<p>I seem to have everything organised for TPC and
YAPC::E. Looking forward to them both immensely.</p>
