<div class="span8">
<p><p>It appears that none of my proposals made the cut for this year's OSCON. This morning I got four rejections emails from "Vee" (closely followed by four emails from <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/gnat/journal/11081">gnat</a> apologising for turning my middle initial in to a hash!)</p>
<p>So I need to seriously consider how much I want to be at OSCON. In 2000 I paid for it all myself and that cost me a <i>lot</i> of money. In 2001 I reduced the costs by speaking, which meant I didn't have to pay to get into the conference. By giving a tutorial last year I managed to cut the costs even more and that was really what I was hoping for again this year.</p>
<p>I'm making a lot less money than I was in 2000, so it's going to be hard to justify paying for it myself. At times like this I wish I wasn't self-employed so that I could get my company to pay for it.</p>
<p>I think it's almost certain that I won't be in Portland. I may try to get to YAPC::Europe in Paris instead.</p></p>

Wow, that's just sick.

<h2>Just being there</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/darobin/">darobin</a> on 2003-03-18T12:34:13</h3>
<p>
  I didn't get neither a rejection letter nor an acceptance one which tends to seriously confirm my fear that my submissions didn't make it through to ORA (it looked like a strange heisenbug back then, now I know it's very likely a stupid firewall issue on my side).
</p>

<p>
  I don't have the money to pay for entrance to the conference, but based on my experience from past years I'm starting to think I might just go there and not attend talks. I've noticed that I might have gotten stuff out from some talks, but generally the stuff that I learnt that was truly interesting was on the Bar Track. So I'm thinking of just hanging out at the bar(s) but not attending (an idea which is helped by the fact that I'll likely be in Vancouver not far from those dates). If there are several of us, we could have a side-conference<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

That is just pure genius, but it looks like my university may pay my way so I may not be able to attend to many of the bar sessions.<br> <br>Great idea though.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

<h2>Cheaper than the hotel</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/schwern/">schwern</a> on 2003-03-21T06:15:05</h3>
<p>For what its worth, I can recommend <a href="http://www.portlandhostel.org/" title="portlandhostel.org">a great hostel</a portlandhostel.org> about 2 miles away, but only 5 blocks from my place.  And FREE WIRELESS!  It really is as nice as it looks in the pictures, should save you about $100 x 5 days on hotel costs and its in the part of town where all the interesting bars are.

</p><p>There's <a href="http://www.2oregonhostels.com/cch.html" title="2oregonhostels.com">another slightly closer</a 2oregonhostels.com>, but in the other direction.  Has Internet access, not sure about wireless.  Never been there.</p>
