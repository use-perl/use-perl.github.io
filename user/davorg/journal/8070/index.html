<p><p>The owner of <a href="http://www.thinkofthechildren.co.uk/">Think of the Children</a> has decided to put it back online. The site was <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/6/27281.html">removed</a> earlier in the week when the ISP decided to comply with an informal request from the Metropolitan Police rather than asking them to go through the proper channels.</p>
<p>This time the site is also offering a <a href="http://www.thinkofthechildren.co.uk/totc.zip">zipped version of the site</a> to make it easier for people to mirror it.</p></p>

<h2>Thank goodness</h2>

I really like this site--it's great that people are still prepared to put forward views like this.<p>
I have been dismayed by the attacks and general mob-like behaviour at the recent court appearances of those <i>suspected</i> of involvement in the killing of Holly and Jessica. I can understand the anger and frustration of those people behaving in this way, but it is sad they apparently do not believe in "innocent until proven guilty". I wonder how they would react if they were given such a hard time if they were on trial for an offence. </p><p>
Thanks for making me aware of that site, it's very interesting. It's also interesting to note the worrying trend of ISPs and web hosts shutting down a site with the slighest request from the authorities. I fear this will only get even worse, with terrorism now being used as the excuse to shut down any site (even if it has nothing to do with terrorism). Even DeCSS has been described as "terrorware"...<nobr> <wbr></nobr>::sigh::</p>



<h2>Just between the two of us...</h2>

<p>I found that sight hilarious.  I particularly liked the description of the Portsmouth mob:</p>

<blockquote><div>A spate of random acts of violence against local paediatricians and that man who hangs around in the park, you know, the one with the coat.</div></blockquote>

<p>I suspect that 'paediatricians' was a reference to <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/child/story/0,7369,361031,00.html" title="guardian.co.uk">idiots who vandalized a paediatrician's home</a guardian.co.uk> because they apparently didn't know the difference between 'paediatrician' and 'paedophile'.  I wonder if they were ever caught.</p>

<p>Of course, it's actually 'pediatrician' and 'pedophile', but who am I to quibble with my British Brethren?  And don't <em>even</em> get me started about the number of 'i's in aluminum.  I give my brother (who's British) hell about that all the time<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>
