<p>Details about <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/eurooscon/">EuroOSCON</a> are now online. And that's the first confirmation I've had that my <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/davorg/journal/24849">tutorial proposals</a> weren't accepted (of course, I'm blaming that on my recent <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/davorg/journal/25721">email problems</a> and not on O'Reilly).<br/><br/>So that means that I'll have to finance myself to go there - which all gets a bit expensive. I'm still determined to go tho'. It'll be the first time for years that I've been to a conference where I'm not speaking.</p>

I'm just curious what you actually want to see.  As far as I can work out there's Damian's "Perl Best Practices" talk, which could be interesting and Autrijus' "Perl and I18n" talk which I'm slightly interested (but not if it's just going to teach me how to use utf8, as, well, I've given talks on that myself.)
<p>
I plan to catch Abigail's talk at YAPC::Europe (I missed it in YAPC::NA), and I've seen Jos' before and listened to Damian talk about Perl 6.  I don't need to hear Leon talk about debugging (I've hacked on that codebase myself) or learn the basics of DBI.  Which leaves the Lightning talks and FIFFS.
</p><p>
Is there some other good stuff worth the entry fee in the other tracks?</p>

Just to clarify: you won't have heard the particular Perl 6 talk I'm giving (with Larry) at EuroOSCON.

<p>We'll be talking about 60 features of Perl 6 that were only designed in the last 12 months, including strictures and warnings; yadae yadae yadae; string interpolation
blocks; string adverbs; the new heredoc syntax; the<nobr> <wbr></nobr><tt>.subst</tt>,<nobr> <wbr></nobr><tt>.match</tt>, and<nobr> <wbr></nobr><tt>.trans</tt> methods; new range operators and adverbs; the new string list
syntax; key lists; the operator formerly known as "diamond";
autochomping; operator precedence; reductions; the "monkey but";
introspection facilities; the new POD semantics; hierarchical regex
captures; module version control; importing and exporting in Perl 6;
subtyping; and enums.

</p><p>In fact, there's so much new stuff to talk about, I promise I won't have time to even <em>mention</em> all the Perl 6 stuff I've talked about previously.<nobr> <wbr></nobr><tt>;-)</tt></p>

It does look a bit wan....the american price but without the american array of talks and such. The lineup is way too fluffy for where I work to get them to pony up the wad of cash....pity there isn't the 'pub track' ticket as with apachecon where you can get in to see the keynotes and the exhibits.

Well you see, one of the joys of going to an Open Source conference rather than a Perl conference is that you don't need to stick to the Perl track<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br><br>For example, I'll probably be in the tutorials on <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/eurooscon/view/e_sess/7445" title="oreillynet.com">Ruby on Rails</a oreillynet.com> and <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/eurooscon/view/e_sess/7233" title="oreillynet.com">AJAX</a oreillynet.com>.<br><br>Over the last couple of years I've deliberately gone to fewer Perl conferences and more general Open Source conferences. I know pretty much everyone who I'm going to meet at a Perl conference. It's much more fun going to a conference where you'll meet new people and find out about different technologies.
