<p><p>Been a while since I posted a journal. I was going to
post something early last week about the hectic socialising
with <a href="http://london.pm.org">london.pm</a> over the 
previous weekend, but I forgot on Monday and then on
Tuesday the World Ended and since then it's seemed
inappropriate to post on such trivial matters.</p>
<p>I'm not going to talk about the attacks or the
(potential) responses as a) you've read it all elsewhere
and b) my views tend to get me in a lot of trouble. I'll
just say that it's been ten years since I went on an
anti-war demo and I've already got an email telling me 
about one in London on Saturday.</p>
<p>In other news, I've returned to working on 
<a href="http://www.dave.org.uk/scripts/nms/">NMS</a>. I
released a first draft of FormMail the other day and now
I've turned my attention to WWWBoard. This is by far Matt's
most ambitious script and I think that perhaps it was a 
little beyond his capabilities[1]. The whole thing is 
hugely overengineered  - it's one of those scripts that's
so complex that it's impossible to hold all the details
in your head at the same time. Huge amounts of of
simplification are in order, but luckily I've just bought
a copy of Martin Fowler's <i>Refactoring</i> so I'm
putting his ideas to good use. Expect a first release some
time next week.</p>
<p>There's been <a href="http://perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=113073">some discussion</a> of names for NMS on
<a href="http://perlmonks.org">PerlMonks</a>. I like the
idea of calling the target audience <i>Net Muggles</i> 
:)</p>
<p>There's a london.pm technical meeting tonight. Lots of
interesting talks planned. I'll report back tomorrow.</p>

<p>[1] Yeah! Like the others weren't :)</p>
