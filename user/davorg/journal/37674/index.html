<div class="span8">
<p><p>At YAPC::Europe this year I gave a talk called <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/davorg/proud-to-use-perl-presentation">Proud to Use Perl</a> where I talked about some of the achievements of the Perl community and suggested that we should shout about these achievements a little more than we do.</p>
<p>And as an example of this shouting, I set up a new <a href="http://proudtouseperl.org/">Proud to Use Perl</a> web site where I was going to write about all of the  amazing things that Perl has to be proud of.</p>
<p>Which I did for about a week.</p>
<p>It's always the same. I go to a Perl conference, get too enthused about stuff and end up volunteering to get involved in too many projects and having to spread myself too thin.</p>
<p>So the Proud to Use Perl site effectively died.</p>
<p>But even though I don't have the time to put into it, I still think it's a good idea. And I wondered if anyone else would be interested in getting involved.</p>
<p>So I'm looking for a few people who would like to write for the site. It would be great if we could get new an interesting things published on the site every couple of days. Surely there's no shortage of things for the Perl community to be proud of. It might be a good place, for example, to share success stories.</p>
<p>Anyone interested in getting involved? Leave a comment here or drop me an email.</p>
<p>And that's not the only Perl web site project I've been neglecting. Earlier this year, I registered the domain <a href="http://culturedperl.org/">culturedperl.org</a>. The idea with that was that I'd set up a blog talking about Perl culture (in some vague, undefined way). But that site was abandoned even sooner. I didn't even get as far as installing Movable Type.</p>
<p>So I'm interested in getting a few authors to help me out there too. Maybe a few Perl Monger group leaders could write things there? Or people involved in organising YAPCs. Or people involved in other parts of the culture - Perl Monks, perhaps, or Perl Golf.</p>
<p>I'll get MT installed on the server this evening. Same thing applies, if you're interested then leave a comment or drop me an email.</p>
<p>More Perl blogs has got to be good, right?</p></p>
