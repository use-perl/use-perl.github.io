I saw this crap last night. I don't think that a module was ever forcibly removed from the CPAN but this here should be. It's not so much a Perl module but a political manifest of stupidity and hatred.



<h2>T&amp;amp;Cs</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/barbie/">barbie</a> on 2007-02-08T12:50:11</h3>
<p>Perhaps a set of clear Terms and Conditions for CPAN Authors is needed to ensure that anyone who uploads this kind of hatred fully expects it to be removed and not even hit BackPAN. His LICENSE agreement pretty much means no-one can use it, not that I can imagine anyone even wanting to.
</p><p>Plus, last time I looked a cube has 6 sides not 4. Flamebait or just ignorant? I suspect both.</p>

<p>The CPAN is a service provided for free where you are not entitled to expect anything, anyway. No policy is required to justify an unceremonious canning of that piece of trash. How many times has this sort of thing happened that we&#8217;d need to make mandates about it? If they&#8217;re made, is anyone going to invest the ongoing effort required to enforce them? If so, is that a good use of their time?</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t think we need any kind of explicit policy at this time.</p>

You're right, we're not entitled to anything. But I expect a certain amount of professional community ethics on CPAN and it's administration. So far I've always been very happy with their decisions. And if someone decides that there are cases where things are deleted off CPAN, I would expect a policy of what is acceptable and what is not. And having stated this, I indeed think there should be a policy needed to remove any kind of "trash."<br> <br><br/><br/>(Especially if emotional reactions and calls for removal seem to go hand in hand.)

<h3><a href="/user/Aristotle/">Aristotle</a> on 2007-02-08T18:11:58</h3>
<p>Well OK then, here&#8217;s a simple policy that merely codifies existing community expectation and would suffice to catch this one case: any upload must be under a Free licence.</p>

<p>Now who is going to comb through everything ever uploaded and every new upload to ensure it complies with this policy?</p>

<p>Because if you don&#8217;t enforce the policy consistently, then all it is is pretence. Removals can be justified by pointing to the policy, but whether you exercise it is every bit as arbitrary as before. All you have created are the trappings of ethics, without an effective difference.</p>

Sure it's hard work, but that's not what I was talking about. Also, this doesn't seem to have to do something with the actual problem. Would you accept the module if it was under GPL2/Artistic?

<p>No, I wouldn&#8217;t, but I don&#8217;t care about hypothetical situations. We have exactly one problem to deal with right now; there is no flood of hate speech modules to rein in. Until and when that happens, I do not see the value of making policies to deal with hate speech modules, just because we had one black sheep. It is, to put it in Bruce Schneier&#8217;s terms, a bad security tradeoff. It will cost a lot of effort to actually implement, and it&#8217;s more likely than not that the policy itself will be flawed in some minor non-obvious way, leading to problems in the future.</p>

<p>I find it annoying that people today have a tendency to want legislative fixes for everything when judicial precedent is a much more appropriate tool for dealing with many situations. But of course that requires that someone make a judgement; scary&#8230;</p>

Well, then we just simply disagree.<br><br>And who in hell's name is talking about "legislative fixes"? Please try not to exaggerate what I am saying, even if it fuels your annoyance. If people have complaints, I find it rather logical to phrase those and state what the actual problem is.<br><br>I find it rather scary, that the only policy you could think of seems to be "No non-free licenses." IMO that is not the large problem causing complaints in this case.<br><br>If one wants to make and execute a judgment about someone else, shouldn't he be _at least_ able to phrase it? You won't be able to find 100% matching rules anyway, so someone _will_ have to judge.<br><br>So what's so bad about stating "CPAN will not tolerate hate speech. Please refer to the Acme:: namespace for controversial humor."? Sure, "hate speech" and "controversial humor" are relative, so someone will have to decide if a module falls into those categories or not. But then, that's the same right now too, just without any phrased words or policies, which will lead the discussions to a morale point. And I'd much rather have discussions in the community about a module bein acceptable according to the policies or not, than discussing the morale issues of the module.

<p>Ah. I think we agree more than we disagree; I just disagree on the last point that not having policy will necessarily mire us in a pointless debate over morale.</p>

<p>Oh, and I did not say the module should be removed due to licence because the licence is the real problem. It is not, and I am very well capable of articulating my real problem with the module, but that wasn&#8217;t what I was going for. You said you expected there to be policy to back up a decision, so I was looking at the issue pragmatically: how to get rid of this one piece of trash by invoking policy, where the policy is a minimal change to established practice. We already have a guideline for licences which could easily be turned into clear policy, so that is what I latched onto.</p>

<p>Personally, I simply trust the admins to excercise their power responsibly and make good judgements without policies regulating them. As long as problems remain rare, fairness and consistency in such matters are easily defined.</p>

I feel that we partly are already in such a morale, emotional debate. 80% of comments about this module contain the words "crap", "trash", "shit" and other such terms. Not that I want to say it isn't (personally though, I just think it's strange humor), but saying "it's just crap, delete it" is not so far for me from full morale discussions.<p><blockquote> <div><i>Oh, and I did not say the module should be removed due to licence because the licence is the real problem.

I just find it a bit pointless to try to use a policy-workaround instead of nailing the actual problem.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

<p>If you can't lampoon the loony, batty, anti-semites, who can you lampoon?  Although I agree CPAN probably isn't the place for such a joke, unless maybe you want to put it in Acme::.</p>

Had it been put in Acme then maybe I'd believe it was joke but since he didn't, I tend to think that he's trying to push his nutty beliefs on others.  After all, there are tons of kooks out there that believe crazier things than this.

<p>I also can't help but wonder if this is the same Joseph Evers who was banned from Digg.</p>

Of course it's a joke!  Good grief.  Did you read the license?  Also, notice the number of links to Encyclopedia Dramatica, catalog of internet memes and jokes -- Joseph Evers runs it.

No, I hadn't read the license until now because I was distracted by all of the racist/anti-semetic crap.  Now that I have I can see that it is the same Joseph Evers that Digg has banned multiple times (under different logins).  These types of "jokes" don't belong in a Perl repository.

<p> <i>I tend to think that he's trying to push his nutty beliefs on others.</i> </p>

<p>This may be a little late, but I think the point was that those who knew about Gene Ray and "Time Cube" would know immediately it was a joke (unless they had reason to believe it was Gene Ray himself).  The fact that the person who uploaded the "joke" was as ignorant of Acme:: as he was tasteless in his humor doesn't alter his intent.</p>

It's not attention they are after, but a certain sort of attention.
