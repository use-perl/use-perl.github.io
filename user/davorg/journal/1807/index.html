<p><p>Well, almost. I guess there's still New Year's Eve to go. Sounds like we're going to a friend of a friend's party somewhere just north of London.</p>

<p>Spent Christmas in Brighton with some of Gill's family. The plan was to return sometime on Boxing Day which would allow me to come to work on the 27th. This didn't work out as planned tho' as there were no trains between Brighton and London on Boxing Day. I know the Americans have been moaning about having to work on Boxing Day, but I hate the way that the UK goes to the opposite extreme. This year it seems that the whole country closed down for two weeks. Many people left work on Friday 22nd December and won't be returning until Monday 7th January. The tube was almost empty this morning.</p>

<p>I was planning to have a whinge about my Christmas, but then I read <a href="http://use.perl.org/journal.pl?op=display&uid=189&id=1787">acme's journal</a> and realised that actually I had nothing to complain about.</p>

<p>Had a huge pile of DVDs as presents. Many of my favourite films - <i>Casablanca</i>, <i>The African Queen</i>, <i>It's A Wonderful Life</i>. If I wasn't at work today, I'd be I'd be having my own private Bogart film festival :)</p>

<h2>the US pretty much shut down for the week too</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/hfb/">hfb</a> on 2001-12-28T18:19:07</h3>
<p>There are a lot of companies who closed operations for the week. I went by the office to feed the fish and there were only ~30 cars in the parking lot. Lots of people take the week since schools are closed and somone has to be home with the kids and I'd wager that most of the people who didn't take the week off are having a fun time playing solitaire<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>
