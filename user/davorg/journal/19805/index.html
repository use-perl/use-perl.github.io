<p><p>The BBC are running a story <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/3886861.stm">about a report</a> which claims that use of IE has fallen 1% over the last four weeks.</p>

<p>A Microsoft spokesperson is quoted as saying:</p>
<blockquote><i>[We] do not feel that switching to an alternative browser and giving up the functionality and compatibility of IE is warranted</i></blockquote>

<p>Functionality? Compatibility? Hah!</p></p>

IE is the one browser which is most compatible with IE. You know?

<p> <strong>Mozilla takes bite out of IE...</strong> </p>

<p>The Register has a <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/07/12/ie_bugs_benefit_mozilla/" title="theregister.co.uk">similar story</a theregister.co.uk>. They are probably reporting the same statistics, showing Mozilla/Netscape at 4.05% up from 3.21% over the last few months. It's not a huge rise, but it's the right direction.</p>

<p>At every oppertunity I try and scare Windows/IE users, and suggest they use <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/" title="mozilla.org">Firefox</a mozilla.org> or <a href="http://www.opera.com/" title="opera.com">Opera</a opera.com>. I usually point out that they block pop-up ads by default, you get tabbed browsing, built in Google search, along with better security, and a faster browsing. The security doesn't seem to bother most people, but they do like the lack of ads, only if they do online banking does the security bother them...</p>

But then you can bet that their bank is one of the stupid ones that has not foresworn renounced and abjured the vile heresy that all the world's IE/Win32.

<p>So far, no one I've converted from the dark side, has hit that problem yet. I know both Smile and Barclays seem to work perfectly fine with Firefox on Linux. I gather that the banks are in quite a fit now, they bought into the lies that "all the world is IE/Win" and "IE is secure".  They are quietly advising staff to stay clear of IE, but can't say anything public, because their own sites are so wedded to IE/Win...</p>

<p>What is it they say...</p>
