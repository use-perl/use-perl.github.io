<h1>Perl on Upcoming</h1>
<h2><a href="/user/davorg/">davorg</a> on 2008-10-09T08:52:47</h2>
</div> <!-- /span4 -->


<div class="span8">
<p><p>I've banged on before about how Perl is seen as less popular than it really is because the Perl community can be a bit insular. I believe that we need to get out there and tell people that a) we're still here and b) we're still wonderful.</p>
<p>As an example of that, we've started to ensure that all of London.pm's events are listed on <a href="http://upcoming.yahoo.com/">Upcoming</a> and we encourage people to register their attendance so that we can demonstrate how popular our meetings are. Recently, I also created a <a href="http://upcoming.yahoo.com/group/12343/">London.pm group</a> to make it easier to track down our events. When adding events to our group, I also add them to a couple of other local geeky groups - which gives us a bit of free publicity. Maybe other local groups could consider doing the same (I see that <a href="http://upcoming.yahoo.com/group/?scope=all&q=perl&Search=Search+Groups">some already do</a>).</p>
<p>Today I also created a global <a href="http://upcoming.yahoo.com/group/12635">Perl group</a> with the intention of collecting all worldwide Perl events. If you create any kind of Perl-related event on Upcoming then please add it to the group.</p></p>

<h2>Perl-Calendar</h2>

There is <a href="http://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=ngctmrd1cac35061mrjt3hpgng%40group.calendar.google.com" title="google.com">http://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=ngctmrd1cac35061mrjt3hpgng%40group.cal<nobr>e<wbr></nobr> ndar.google.com</a google.com> . Would it be possible to post the events on this calendar to Upcoming automatically?

<p>It seems not (or, at least, not on an initial glance).</p><p>However, Upcoming does produce an ics feed which can then be read in Google Calendar or other ics readers.</p><p>I'm not sure how things get added to the Perl Review calendar - do you just mail stuff to brian? This might be an easier approach, but I definitely don't want to step on brian's toes here<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p><p>Or, hey, diversification is good. Right?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>

<p>To get stuff added, I or Jim Brandt add people to the list of people who can post events.</p><p>I'd like to see the Perl events all over the place, so if we can figure out the data exchange stuff, that would be nice. I know that you can get the calendar feed data (that's how yapc.org makes its list), so now the trick is inserting it into upcoming automatically.</p>

<p>Looks like my initial "it seems not" was overstating the case and that I should probably spend an hour or two reading the <a href="http://upcoming.yahoo.com/services/api/" title="yahoo.com">Upcoming API docs</a yahoo.com>.</p><p>Oh, there's even a <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/WebService-Upcoming/" title="cpan.org">CPAN module</a cpan.org>.</p>

Who do we submit them to, and how do we tell them apart?

<p>I just gave you two names.</p><p>Tell whom apart for what? The people who post to the calendar are the people who organize events. You don't really need that list of people, or you can guess who that is based on what you see in the calendar.</p><p>If anyone has an event, they can send them to me. If I see a post or an announcement, I usually add it myself.</p>

<p>The "tell them apart" snippet was a joke about your video, remember?</p>
