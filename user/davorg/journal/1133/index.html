<p><p>For the first time for months I've done something with
Perl that was both fun <i>and</i> useful.</p>
<p>I'm a freelancer (or "contractor" or "consultant" call
it what you will). This means that periodically I need to
record the time that I've put in on a client's site and
send them (or, more usually an agent that I'm working thru) an invoice. When I first started doing this (six and a 
half years ago) I had never heard of Perl and still used
Windows more than I'd like to admit. I therefore wrote
myself a simple time recording and billing system in
(gasp!) Access. I've been using this system ever since.</p>
<p>Now, I don't visit Windows much any more. I <i>do</i>
still have PCs with Windows installed, but I spend the
vast majority of my time in Linux. One of the last things
that I was still doing in Windows was my invoicing. But
no more. Over the last few evenings, I've thrown together
a system that allows me to do all that the old system
did (and more) from Linux.</p>
<p>The data is stored in a MySQL database and is both
entered and extracted with a Perl script (of course). This
is all obvious stuff. The interesting stuff is creating
the actual invoice. I'm using the Template Toolkit to 
create a LaTeX input file containing the data. The Template
Toolkit then has a nice LaTeX filter which will convert
that stuff into in a PDF file. It's all very lovely and 
I've learned far more LaTeX than I've had to know 
before.</p>
<p>It makes me very happy (but I'm easily pleased :)</p>
<p>I see that hfb has been discussing English idioms and
one of the examples she uses is "there's method in his
madness". This reminds me that in a former life (late
1980s) I worked for the methods house LBMS. At once point
they had staff t-shirts with the slogan "there's madness
in our methods".</p>
<p>Which was nice.</p>
