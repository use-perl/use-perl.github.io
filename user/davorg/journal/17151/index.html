<p>Today I have been mainly playing with the <a href="http://sqlfairy.sourceforge.net/">SQL Fairy</a> (aka <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/kclark/SQL-Translator/">SQL::Translator</a>).<br/><br/>After watching it install about half of CPAN are prerequisites and finally being galvanised into going thru the pain of installing libgd and GD.pm I finally got to try it out. And it seems like a pretty useful piece of code. It translates SQL DDL between various storage formats. That might be actual DDL code (in various dialects) or perhaps XML or YAML. It'll even have a good stab at drawing a picture of your database (that's what it needs GD for).<br/><br/>I'll be adding it to my standard toolbox.</p>

Wow.  That's <em>exactly</em> what I was thinking.<br/><br/>I'm frightened.<br/><br/>[cowers in corner]

<cite>about half of CPAN are prerequisites</cite>

<p>Well, we've tried hard not to recreate any
wheels unless we <em>really</em> have to.
Would you rather we wrote our own bitmap output
library?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)</p>

&gt; Well, we've tried hard not to recreate any wheels unless we really have to<br> <br>But if you end up pulling in the annual combined output of Goodyear and Michelin?<br> <br>What I would like to see is better composability (and therefore decomposability) of modules, so that one pulls in only the parts one is really using.<br>

I manage to only require a handful of modules in Autodia and acheive much the same result.
<p>
Of course I still need to munge the Makefile some more to make it interactively ask if it should install $module if the user wants / needs it for something.
</p><p>
Autodia has been doing Database Diagrams (from DDL/SQL or DBI and even Druid XML) for yonks. Hopefully I can add the new pureperl directed graph module as an alternative to GraphViz.
</p><p>
If you have databases in Dia you might want to check out tedia2sql which handles multiple databases rather nicely (in a handful of modules)
</p><p>
Schemamania is quite cool too.
</p><p>
I can't remember the links off hand but you can find them on the <a href="http://droogs.org/autodia/" title="droogs.org">autodia</a droogs.org> site in the links page.
</p><p>
Not to knock SQL Fairy - it looks damned useful, and I hope to nick some ideas^W^W^Wfind some inspiration from it<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
