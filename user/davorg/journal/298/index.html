<p><p>Maybe I should just call this "The Book Column" as that's
all I ever seem to write about :)</p>

<p>A few unrelated snippets...</p>

<ul>

<li>Genie has raised his ugly head again.<br>
For those that don't know, Genie thinks it's really clever
to distribute pirate copies technical books to anyone who
wants them. He's got a list of them on his website and
there are a <b>huge</b> number of books there. I first
heard of him when I found a complete PDF of DMP on his
site (thank you Google for indexing PDFs). Manning asked
him to take it down, which he did, but a couple of weeks
later he was happy to email me a copy to me when I asked
for it. Now he's just advertised his "service" on the
Perl beginners mailing list. Something needs to be done
about him.</li>

<li>Perl books website.<br>
I'd been toying with the idea of setting up a Perl books
website, where people can review and rate Perl books. I 
hear from reports of YAPC::NA that Uri Guttman is thinking
along the same lines. I should probably contact him and
offer my help.</li>

<li>Better Perl Books.<br>
I've been thinking more about yesterday's journal entry - 
the bit where I suggested that we should contact the 
authors of bad Perl books and offer our help in making them
better. I really think this idea is a goer. Perhaps it's
something that we could coordinate from the Perl books
page. As I see it we would start by making a list of books 
that need our help. We would then write a detailed review 
of the problems in the books which we would pass on to the
authors and publishers. We would then offer our services
as advisors and technical reviewers to help get the 
problems ironed out for the next edition. I say "we", but
I don't know who else would be interested in helping.
Anyone fancy joining me?</li>
</ul>

<p>YAPC::Europe are thinking of dropping one of my talks
to make a room for a talk on POE. I'd love to hear a talk
on POE, but I don't know which talk I'd prefer to lose.</p>

<p>I wish I was in Montreal.</p>
