<p>This week it was the turn of the MS advocates to get <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/online/story/0,3605,1229654,00.html">a letter</a> printed in the Guardian's ongoing debate about browsers.<br/><br/>It contains two of the common fallacies perpetuated by IE fans.<br/><br/>1) Supporting other (inferior!) browsers involves somehow "dumbing down" your site.<br/><br/>2) IE usage is still on the increase.<br/><br/>On one hand I think I've lost the will to get involved in this any more, but on the other I'm tempted to write an article explaining the issues in words of one syllable[1] so everyone can understand.<br/><br/>[1] Which could be tricky as "browser" has two syllables and "internet" has three :)</p>

<i>There once was a book store where the man who ran the store put in an extra top shelf so that he was able to buy books to sell that did not fit on the small low shelves.  "Tall peeps come here!" he would say.  "I have new big maps I can sell you!".  The tall peeps all told him that this now was the best store that they had ever been too.  So glad was he tore down the old sign and put up a new one that had the new name "Tall Books".
</i><p><i>
One day a short man came into his store with steps.  As he stood on the steps the man who ran the store saw what he was up to and said "No No No! This is a store for the Tall."  "But I have cash and I want a book".  "No no no!" said the man who ran the store "It's my way or not at all!".  Short peeps did not come to the store any more.
</i></p><p><i>
The man who ran the store did not buy any more books for the low shelves.  Why would he?  He had all the nice big books for the top odd size shelves.
</i></p><p><i>
Late that week he saw that he had sold not one book.  None of the peeps had come to visit his store!  He saw a tall man in the street and he went out to ask why his store was bare.
</i></p><p><i>
"It might be best if you let peeps get at your stuff any way they want", he said, "my wife is short so I can do not come in your store when I am with her.  And even though I like your big books I miss the small books that I bought all the time.  I have to go to the other store to get what I want now

<p>Oops:</p>

<p> <i>did not buy <b>any</b> more books</i> </p>

<p>But you could take that word out and it would still work.  I see at least one more use of "any," though.</p>

<h2>MS advocate?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jmm/">jmm</a> on 2004-06-03T18:35:20</h3>
If you read that letter, you might reconsider your opinion that it was written by an MS advocate.  It is dripping with sarcasm - unfortunately, it is only geeks who know what is being talked about who will recognize it for what it is, many people will read the letter and accept it at face value.
