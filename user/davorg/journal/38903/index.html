<div class="span8">
<p><p>The CFP for this year's <a href="http://yapceurope2009.org/">YAPC::Europe</a> closed yesterday. Usually this means I have a frantic couple of hours rushing around proposing (semi-)random talks. This year I've been a bit more organised and have been proposing talks as they have occured to me. The upside of this is that I have confidence that they will all be interesting talks. The downside is that I've proposed more talks than ever before. I hope the organisers don't select all of them (I'd like to see <i>some</i> of the conference) but I've given them lots of choice :-)</p>

<p>There are a couple of talks based on the conference's theme of "Corporate Perl".</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Why Corporates Hate Perl</b><br />This will be loosely based on my <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/onlamp/blog/2008/08/why_corporates_hate_perl.html">blog post</a> from lst year - but I've got lots of other things to add based on the feedback I received. This is, at least partly, a sequel to <a href="http://mag-sol.com/talks/yapc/2006/lang/">Programming Languages and Perl</a> and <a href="http://mag-sol.com/talks/yapc/2008/proud/">Proud to Use Perl</a>.</li>
<li><b>Why do so many companies re-invent well-known CPAN modules badly and end up writing far too much code?</b><br />I was going to give this talk at a recent London.pm technical meeting, but was ill and was unable to present it. The title pretty much describes what I'll cover.</li>
</ul>
<p>There's a talk following up on something I spoke about last year in Copenhagen.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Perl in RPM-Land (The Return)</b><br />Last year I talked about <a href="http://mag-sol.com/talks/yapc/2008/rpm/">building RPMs</a> of CPAN modules and suggested that we could do this automatically for a large percentage of modules. This is conference-driven development. If this talk is chosen then I'll have to make a start on the project.</li>
</ul>
<p>And there's a talk about a project that I'm currently pretty enthused about.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>The Planetarium</b><br />This is about using Perl to aggregate web feeds. In particular I'm trying to build sites that are useful tools for building local communities. It's not really on-topic for the conference, but I think it's interesting.</li>
</ul>

<p>So now it's just a case of seeing which ones the conference organisers choose. Does anyone know when that will be announced?</p>

<p><b>Update:</b> They chose <a href="http://yapceurope2009.org/ye2009/talk/1939">Why do so many companies re-invent well-known CPAN modules badly and end up writing far too much code?</a> and <a href="http://yapceurope2009.org/ye2009/talk/2069">The Planetarium</a>.</p>

<p>I'll see you in Lisbon.</p></p>

<p>But you seem to have managed to notify us all in less than a day. I'm really impressed. Thank you.</p>
