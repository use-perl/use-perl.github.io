<p><p>Been a busy few days. Lots of geekish stuff going on.</p>
<p>Tim O'Reilly has been in the UK. Last Thursday, O'Reilly UK organised a boat trip on the Thames to celebrate the company's 25th birthday. We set off 90 minutes late as Tim was travelling from Bath and the railway network collapsed. Although truncated, the trip was fun and I met a lot of interesting people.</p>
<p>On Monday, Tim gave a talk at the City University. This was a bit of a trip down memory lane for me as I studied at City twenty years ago and haven't been back since. The lecture theatre we were sitting in brought back a number of memories - particularly as I used to run the film club there. Tim's talk was how LAMP is changing the rules for application development. I see it's now listed as a <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/os2003/view/e_sess/4389">keynote</a> at OSCON. If you're going there then I recommend that you go to hear it.</p>
<p>Then yesterday, I was at the Genome Campus in Hinxton, Cambridgeshire to give a half-day course to a group of Bioinfomaticists. Many of them had seen no Perl before the previous day's introduction course and on the morning of their second day I was introducing them to references. I <i>think</i> that most of them got most of the concepts, but we'll wait for the feedback forms before getting too cocky :). Coolest part of that day for me was a guided tour of the <a href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/">Sanger Institute</a>'s Sequencing Centre. I'll admit that a lot of the science went over my head, but they have a <i>lot</i> of very serious <a http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Info/IT/">computer hardware</i>.</p>
<p>And, on top of all that, we've been working on incorporating the tech review changes to the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0596004761">Template Toolkit book</a>. Should be finished over the weekend.</p>
<p>Then I'm going to relax.</p></p>

<p>I'm very interested to see if Amazon recommends my own book to me.  So far, they haven't.  I wonder if that's a failure of their software, or if I just haven't bought enough books from them?  Hm...<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)</p>

<p>I've just looked at the listing on <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?userid=2XGM6Y5XYB&amp;isbn=0596004761&amp;itm=2" title="barnesandnoble.com">B&amp;N</a barnesandnoble.com> and I'm sorry to say that they've written you out of history<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<p>Mind you, they've done the same thing to Tom Christiansen with the Camel!</p>
