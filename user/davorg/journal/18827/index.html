<p>If you're building web applications and you haven't investigated <a href="http://maypole.simon-cozens.org/">Maypole</a> yet then I strongly recommend that you do so. It will save you a lot of time.<br/><br/>Currently I've got a web front end to an application that lets you define the entities for other web applications. A bit of TT magic then goes off and defines the Maypole classes needed to implement these other apps.<br/><br/>It's all rather fun.</p>

<h2>Maypole bootstrap?</h2>

Did you say you've got a web app that generates Maypole applcations??? Please, tell all.

Well, I'm on the way to having that. It's certainly what I'm aiming for.<br> <br>Once it's finished I'll be very happy to share as much of it as a) is generally useful and b) the Powers That Be here allow me to share.<br> <br>But it's actually not that complex. You have an application where the objects in the database are applications, entities (that belong to an application), attributes (that belong to entities) and relationships (between entities).<br> <br>You then write a script that queries this database and finds all of the entities, attributes and relationships for a given application. You can then use this data to create database tables and Maypole classes that support the app. Of course, that's where all the magic is and that's what I'm currently trying to get working. It's tantalisingly close right now.<br> <br>It's all a bit of a trip back in time for me. My first job when I got my degree was working on a CASE tool (anyone else old enough to remember case tools?) I was working on the data modelling part of the system so we had a database that modelled entity-relationship diagrams and a program that used that data to generate SQL DDL. I'm dredging out all of that old knowledge for this project.

<h2>Yeah, dave, do tell</h2>

Even better, throw a post to the maypole list, this sounds pretty facinating.
