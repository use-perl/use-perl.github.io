<p><p>I got this in the post from <a href="http://www.billybragg.co.uk">Billy Bragg</a> yesterday.</p>

<blockquote><i>Do you feel like you are the only person in the country who is dreading the festival of fawning and flag waving that will accompany the golden jubilee celebrations this summer? Fear not. You are not alone.</i></blockquote>
<blockquote><i>Billy Bragg proposes knavish trickery for this years golden jubilee.</i></blockquote>
<blockquote><i>Billy is attempting to get - against all the odds - the UK's number one single during the golden jubliee week at the start of June. His song, <b>Take Down The Union Jack</b> is the music industry's only dissenting contribution to the royal event, which will otherwise see Sir Paul McCartney and Sir Elton John, together with Pop Idol Will young and S Club 7, performing a pop concert at Buckingham Palace.</i></blockquote>
<blockquote><i>Do you want to take part in this michevious knavery? Well this is your chance.</i></blockquote>
<blockquote><i>Register your protest and buy <b>Take Down The Union Jack</b>.</i></blockquote>
<p>The single is released on Monday 20th May and they reckon they need to sell 20,000 copies to make it to number one. I'll be off to my local record store first thing on Monday and I invite everyone in the UK to join me :)</p>

<h2>Temporal conspiracy</h2>

I am always amazed with how the long arm of coincidence so unrelentingly ensures that what happens in the US one year (tiresome feckless flagwaving) happens in other countries the next.  It's a strange phenomenon, but it is useful to give one advance warning of things.  (It's definitely the case here in New Mexico, which patterns trend-wise more with Mexico than with, say, white middle-class California.)
<p>Advance warning in this case: Look for little UK flag pullouts in the newspaper (for you to tape on the inside of your windows) often with an ad for your local real estate salesmen; UK flag pinwheels; UK flag t-shirts with menacing slogans.</p>

The first US flag pullouts I saw in a newspaper were in a London tabloid (the <i>Evening Mail</i>, I think) the week of September 11, while I was wondering how and when I'd be able to get back to Washington, so they are already geared up for it.
