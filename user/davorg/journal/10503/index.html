<p><p>[ My desire to keep politics out my journal here has, on this occasion, been overtaken by my desire to advertise this as widely as possible ]</p>

<p>If you don't know that there's an <a href="http://www.stopwar.org.uk/">Anti-War Demo</a> on Saturday then you must be living on another planet.</p>

<p>From what I'm seeing the number of people who are planning to go on this demo is huge. When I was a student, I was surrounded by people who thought like me and we'd all go off on demos together. Since then I seem to know less and less people who would see spending an afternoon marching through London as a useful way to spend their time. I've become used to people looking at me slightly strangely when I say I'm going on a demo.</p>

<p>But this this time it's different. Everyone that I talk to is planning to go along. Even people who have never been on a demo in their life are considering going along. This march isn't just going to be people selling <i>Socialist Worker</i> or career lefties. It will be people from all sections of British society. I really think that the government is going to be taken aback by the breadth of support that the anti-war movement has. Blair is wrong to support Bush. Only a very small number of people can't see this.</p>

<p>I strongly suspect that this could be the largest demo that London has ever seen.</p>

<p>Please come along and help prove me right.</p></p>

The US has a different view of the UK position on the upcoming second gulf war.  For the past few months now, the US press has portrayed the UK as generally supportive of the US POV.  Most of this news coverage has taken the form of Tony Blair speaking on behalf of Parliment, and Parliment speaking on behalf of the British people.
<p>
Even today, the US press generally paints the UK as still somewhat supportive of the US plan of action.
</p><p>
On what grounds are the British people not supporting war in the gulf?</p>

<p>
I can assure you that the anti-war lobby is not representative of 'the British people' as a whole. I for one am fully behind whatever action Mr Bush and Mr Blair decide is necessary (and as a lifelong Tory voter, I never thought I'd hear myself say that I support a Labour PM<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)
</p><p>
I'm sure that the protest that Dave mentions will attract a large attendance, but so what? This will not in itself prove that there it not an equal or greater level of support for a possible war. We just don't have marches in support of government policy - it will always be easier to stir up people with a strong negative opinion than to engage the silent majority.
</p><p>
As for <i>The Guardian</i>, non-UK readers should be aware that this newspaper sits on one extreme with it's own views and agenda. It does not present a balanced or representative viewpoint that represents the UK as a whole. Again, just my opinion, but I would consider the views of <i>The Guardian</i> to epitomise all that is wrong with our country.
</p><p>
Dave - I don't want to start an argument about this, I respect your views and I hope that you will respect mine. Of course, I've fuelled the debate by adding my point of view, but I really don't think that <b>use Perl;</b> is an appropriate forum for such matters. The Perl community has a very good reputation for being welcoming and inclusive, but there's nothing more certain to cause divisions than arguments about politics (except maybe religion). Please consider making political posts somewhere more suitable.</p>

<p>I enjoy the political posts because it helps me have perspective.  Perl people are just smart in general!  Even the ones who have wacked out politics usually have points of view that are worth my time to consider.</p>

<p>I particularly enjoyed seeing your post, because I hear very little support for the war coming from Europe.  Knowing there are folks who feel as you do is quite revealing, and I would have never seen that if this journal entry were not here to draw it out of you.</p>

<p>Any attempts to deduce my standing on the war issue from this post will probably be wrong.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<li>There have always been political posts here on use.perl. Personally I've kept them to a minimum since starting my <a href="http://dave.org.uk/blog/" title="dave.org.uk">other blog</a dave.org.uk> but I don't think you'll ever stop them completely. We've even discussed religion here at times. The vast majority of these discussions have been extremely civilised. I don't think I've ever been disrespectful of anyone's politics (tho' I will confess to occasionally being less than completely respectful about some people's religion)</li>
<li>Of course <i>The Guardian</i> is biased. However I don't believe that it's any more biased than any other national British newspaper (just in a different direction to most of them). I posted that link because the Guardian web site is the one I am most familiar with, but I'm sure that other papers have carried similar stories</li>
<li>I don't claim to speak for the British public as a whole. All I can say is that I have heard much more talk about this demonstration than I have ever heard about any previous anti-war demonstration. And it's coming from a far wider range of people too.</li>
<li>If we get 500,000 people along to the demo, then I realise that this will only represent about 1% of the adult population of the country. But that will still be a significant number. That would be much bigger than any demo London has seen for a long time.</li>

<p>Tony Blair is deliberately misrepresenting British public opinion. The opinion polls are mostly showing the majority of the British population don't support the war (at least, not without another UN resolution).</p>

<blockquote><div> <i>On what grounds are the British people not supporting war in the gulf?</i> </div></blockquote>
<p>It's not just in the UK. Much of Europe seems to have the same doubts. There are a number of different reasons. The major one seems to be that the US seems to be trying to circumvent proper UN procedures to start the war as soon as possible. Others I've heard include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Too many Iraqis will die</li>
<li>It's clearly just about the oil in the region</li>
<li>A war will destabilise the region</li>
<li>The US has no right to remove the leader of another sovereign nation</li>

Saddam Hussein is an atheist (or an autotheist, "someone who thinks he is God"). He's the leader of a socialist party (the Ba'as party). He's also a megalomaniac. I don't imagine him funding islamic terrorists, unless he has complete control over them (obviously not the case with Al Quaeda).
Al Qaeda zealots are against democracy, against separation of churches and state, and as well against Saddam Hussein who guarantees religious freedom in Iraq as long as he's worshipped first.
Moreover there is currently no evidence that Iraq actually owns smallpox and other biological weapons.<p>
I'd say it again : the main problem is the arrogance of the US' foreign policy. The message of Bush is clear : no negotation, we have evidences, we want a war now, we're right, God bless America. Argh. This is <i>not</i> a good thing for American diplomacy. With this attitude, the USA is loosing its credibility and its power. It's now easy for the current arab allies of the USA to depict themselves as the next target, in a few decades. They'll be less likely helping the USA then. Other countries, looking at the way USA manages this crisis, see that they completely fail to act on a diplomatic plan, and that's is nearly impossible to discuss with them, as Bush repeats that those that don't want war in Iraq are the USA's enemies.
</p><p>Gee, I don't even see why I complain about USA. Let them mess up their own diplomacy and alliances, that's a good thing for Europe by contrast.</p>

<h2>Saddam and the terrorist myth</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/TeeJay/">TeeJay</a> on 2003-02-12T22:29:15</h3>
The Terrorist organisations have called saddam an atheist and an infidel. In the tape which supposedly links iraq and al qaida bin laden refers to the iraq rulers as solialist infidels.
<p>
Although iraq is on the whole a muslim nation, with a muslim majority it has a wide range of races and religions - this is because it was created artificially, like isreal, but european empire builders as they carved up the lands the middle east.
</p><p>
Calling Saddam a muslim is like calling hitler or david koresh a christian. More importantly jews and christians in muslim countries are treated a lot better than in christian, jewish and hindu countries.
</p><p>
Islamic law protects those of all religions. To be a muslim you have believe and be obient but all beliefs are respected by islam as long as you don't try and slaughter muslims ( part of the reason there is so much misunderstanding of islam and its apparent militarism is that it has spent most of its history being attacked by Judaism and christianity as well as more recently hindu extremists and jewish extremists ).
</p><p>
Bin laden said nothing about working with Saddam - he said all muslims should stand up for the people of iraq. At no point does he support or encourage support for saddam. Was the american broadcast of the tape edited by the same people who 'edited' the dodgy dossier or something.
He told iraqi's how to protect themselves against US invasion. He told muslims to stand up for iraq and defend its people - not its leader!
</p><p>
There is *no* evidence that Iraq has smallpox or anthrax - it has mustard gas, a ww1 weapon probably provided by the US and other NATO countries - its longest range rockets struggle to reach into isreal, and isreal would be its only target - attacking kuwait would only bring reprisals from arab nations possibly leading to saddams downfall. If there was any evidence the UN would have come down like a ton of bricks - there is not so it hasn't.
</p><p>
Neither blix nor any inspectors have claimed he is breach - only US and UK ministers and generals. The US has made it clear it would take unilateral action. This is unacceptable.
</p><p>
Europe is, with good reason, waiting for any evidence of a material breach. Playing fast and loose with the rules (as opposed to breaking, and then jumping up and down on the rules like China, russia or isreal) is not a material breach.
</p><p>
It is impossible to discuss anything with the United States - it doesn't pay its dues, it walks out of talks on the environment, the middle east, GM crops, anything at all that might not go in the US favour is simply ignored.
</p><p>
The whole point of having the UN is that nations like the US don't create a situation like that in Iraq (you *do* remember who put saddam into power and gave him all those weapons) again.

<h2>doing nothing..</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/TeeJay/">TeeJay</a> on 2003-02-12T22:09:58</h3>
depends if you mean doing nothing about iraq or doing nothing about the middle east.
<p>
Terrorists do not support saddam, saddam does not support terrorists - there is no link, at all.
if the US and Isreali intelligence were any good they would have more useful information than :
</p><ul>
<li> Saddam has a small penis</li>
<li> Saddam has weapons of mass destruction (that we sold to him to use on muslim neighbours in iran but not isreal or other US allies) that have already been desteroyed by the UN.</li>
<li> Saddams grip on power is held through a military junta disguised a political party, based on student essays of 12 years ago - making it different from say Pakistan which has nuclear weapons, supports terrorist organisations, is actually waging war in kashmir and is a military junta.</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are many things to do in the middle east - for example bringing UN peace keepers to stop isreal commiting further genocide and war crimes.
</p><p>
Providing real aid to syria and palestine without tying it to unfeasable political plans.
</p><p>
If we really wanted the UN to be taken seriously then the issues of Cyprus and Palestine should be addressed long before iraq. That would also bring peace to the middle east quicker than bombing iraq.
</p><p>
The supposedly liberal northern alliance in afghanisation has turned out to be almost as extremist as the taliban but less organised.The only difference between the new afghan regime and the old is the tribe in control and the flags the same warlords and gangsters are flying while they re-invest in drugs and the mad mullahs lay down the same laws as under the taliban
</p><p>
oh and we still don't have any actual evidence of Iraq commiting a serious breach of UN resolutions  - unlike isreal which makes sure it breaks a UN resolution every day.
</p><p>
The dossier that Colin Powell went on about was a mixture of cribbing from Janes Defence and rewriting a 12 year old californian graduate student essay.
</p><p>
The reason 80% of the UK (looking at the polls), don't want war is because it will do nothing for the people of iraq (even the kurds don't want a war now that they have autonomy), for world peace or the middle east - we know that war will move the world away from peace rather than closer. The people of iraq certainly don't want a war.
</p><p>
The biggest concern, again based on recent polls, is that war will destabilise the middle east and give isreal a chance to finish off palestine and occupy its neighbours while the UN is distracted and in doing so start a major war through the whole of the middle east - pulling in Pakistan and India and possibly turkey and even the problematic areas in the baltics and the russian dissedent republics.

<em>we still don't have any actual evidence of Iraq commiting a serious breach of UN resolutions</em> <br> <br>This is plainly false.  Not even the leaders of France or Germany could say this with a straight face.  After Powell's presentation, France did not say Iraq was not in breach; it accepted that Iraq was in breach, and said we should give them more time.<br> <br>You're simply making things up out of thin air.  No serious person familiar with the facts believes that Iraq is not in serious breach.  Both El Baradei and Blix have been very clear that Iraq has not been fully cooperating, that they have in fact been stonewalling UNSCOM and the IAEA.  This is a serious breach, as noted in many resolutions, including the original 687 from March 1991 and the most recent 1441 from November 2002, which stated in no uncertain terms that Iraq must cooperate fully, without condition.  No one contends Iraq has done this.<br> <br>It is true that since Powell's presentation, Iraq has been more cooperative.  And they still have further to go.  But to say there is no evidence they have committed a serious breach is just utter nonsense.<br> <br> <em>unlike isreal which makes sure it breaks a UN resolution every day.</em> <br> <br>It amazes me that anyone thinks this is a valid comparison.  Iraq lost a war with the UN and agreed to disarm rather than be destroyed.  Israel never fought a war with the UN, let alone lost one, and never agreed to the resolutions in question.  The situations are not comparable.<br> <br> <em>even the kurds don't want a war now that they have autonomy</em> <br> <br>Autonomy which only exists as long as US forces enforce the no-fly zone.  You want to see real genocide?  Let the US pull out of Northern Iraq.<br>

I think the US government, rather than starting more wars, should just leave well enough alone, and stop the counterproductive stuff.  Once we get to that point, *then* we can talk about trying to encourage good things to happen.  The US exports a tremendous amount of military machinery.  Take Mexico or Columbia, for example.  Or US government backing of Egypt's dictator (those are *not* elections).  Or talk about the Kurds -- the US government ships death machines to the Turkish military, which then uses them to attack the Kurds.  The US government was perfectly happy with the Iraqi government in the 1980s gassing Kurds and Iranian soldiers.  Like the whole holy war business, the current mess in the middle east has been greatly inflamed over the years by US government intervention.  For instance, would there have been an Islamic Revolution in Iran if the US hadn't <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=Iran+shah+coup" title="google.com">imposed</a google.com> the Shah on the country for so many years?<br> <br>As to the question of the "opposition" -- you say that will choose a leader of some sort.  Who are these opposition people?  I recall the US government giving the INC a bunch of money over the last few years.  Why are they a good group of people to appoint a leader of millions of people?  This reminds me of the Afghanistan thing, where the press was all talking about the "traditional Loya Jirga(sp??)" where the US government got a bunch of warlord types together to decide what would happen.  Missing was all that "freedom" and "democracy" stuff that the US government likes to talk about.  (Side comment on press -- mainstream US press (e.g. nytimes) is *not* some sort of stalinist or anarchist conspiracy; it <a href="http://www.fair.org/activism/genoa-update.html" title="fair.org">reflects</a fair.org> mainstream US business).

Again: not addressing the issue of disarmament.

It's not just the US, though; apparently, Chalabi also has the blessing of Iran and is working to gain support from the other main opposition groups (last I heard, a couple of weeks ago, a summit was planned for today in Northern Iraq).<br>

<p>Sure, if they were marching for the right to take away my rights to protest in the future, then that would be a problem. But they're not. They are marching for the same reason as me.

As to it being "clearly just about the oil," what do you mean by that?  Do you mean the US is trying to steal the oil; if so, why didn't Bush 41 and Cheney march into Baghdad when they had the chance?  If not, what do you mean?<br> <br>As to stability, the whole point -- one which the UN Security Council has agreed with on many occasions -- is that Iraq is a threat to the stability of the region until it is disarmed.  And all of us know that Iraq has not, for a decade now, been cooperating with disarmament.<br> <br>As to rights: the US, and the UN, fought a war with Iraq.  We won.  They lost.  We had a choice at that time: we could forcibly remove Hussein and his regime and do what was necessary to disarm them, or we could allow them to disarm themselves.  As a condition of the cessation of hostilities, we allowed them to disarm themselves.  They have  -- again, as everyone knows -- failed to cooperate with the UN disarmament process.  That Iraq has continually violated the terms for the cessation of hostilities precisely means that the US has a right to go in and fix the problem, removing Hussein if necessary.<br> <br>Think of it as Iraq being on parole, and violating the terms of its parole.  We revoke parole, sending them back to jail.  Plan B (parole, self-disarmament) failed, so we go back to Plan A (jail, forced disarmament).<br> <br>I suppose you might claim the UN, not the US, was at war, but that isn't how we see it.<br>

<p>This is what I mean. There are many countries around the world with human rights violations on their records, or who have weapons of mass destruction, or who have repeatedly ignored UN resolutions. So the obvious question is why pick on Iraq? And the answer that most easily comes to mind is because Iraq has a large amount of oil and a large number of people in the US who have a lot to say in the choice of targets also have a lot of personal wealth tied up in the oil industry.</p>

You are not actually saying anything there, you are insinuating, and I do not know what you are insinuating.  Is America going to take Iraq's oil fields, something the Bush administration has said in no uncertain terms it will not do?  Is it trying to get lower oil prices, despite that war will increase oil prices for the forseeable future?  What exactly are you insinuating?<br> <br>Further, that the answer comes most easily to your mind isn't exactly compelling.  More to the point, you have completely disregarded many things that make Iraq unique, including the fact that of all the other rogue nations you could mention, it is currently the only one that lost a war with the UN and is defying the terms of disarmament under the cease-fire that ended that war.<br> <br>Again, this is not a new thing.  We are now coming up on 12 years since <a href="gopher://gopher.undp.org/00/undocs/scd/scouncil/s91/4%09+Text/plain" title="undp.org">Resolution 687</a undp.org> was adopted by the Security Council, which mandated the disarmament that everyone agrees Iraq has never fully and unconditionally cooperated with, as required.  Read Part C.  Iraq has never submitted to this, then or now.  Also read measure 34:<br> <br> <blockquote><div>[The Security Council]<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... Decides to remain seized of the matter and to take such further steps as may be required for the implementation of the present resolution and to secure peace and security in the area.</div></blockquote> <br> <br>It is not insignificant that Iraq has lost a war with the UN and that it has certain obligations which must be met, and that the UN Security Council stated 12 years ago that if Iraq does not cooperate, that the Council will take further steps to implement the policies of the resolution.  This difference between Iraq and other states is not insignificant, it is the point.<br>If you like, you can continue to think Iraq is no different than any other rogue state but for its oil.  But it's not true.  I don't mind if you think we shouldn't go to war because you just think war is wrong, or because you think that the threat doesn't warrant it, etc.  I'll disagree, but I won't mind.

  I've noticed while travelling or living abroad that demos tend to vary greatly in size depending on local culture. In Paris 100-200k happens on a regular basis, same thing in Brussels (proportionately). 500k happens once every 5 years, and we've been over a million five times in the past fifty years or so (though two of those were the Lib&#233;ration and the World Cup). On the other hand US and Australian demos tend to be really small (say, 25 people on the curb count as a demo). So how big are your typical London demos? Are the cops often violent?
