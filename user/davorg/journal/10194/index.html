<p><p>As other have pointed out, there are a <i>lot</i> of conferences on this year. There's no way that anyone could attend all of then - well except <a href="/user/acme/">acme</a> I guess.</p>
<p>There were two that I wanted to go to. <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/os2003/">OSCON</a> and <a href="http://www.yapc.org/Europe/">YAPC::Europe</a>, but I've just seen the dates for YAPC::Europe and it's only a couple of weeks after OSCON. We're already planning to make OSCON a long holiday where we can catch up with a few friends in various parts of the US, so adding on the extra time off to go to Paris as well will probably will be unworkable. Our finances are still reeling from all the time I was out of work last year so I really can't afford to take six weeks off this summer.</p>
<p>So it looks like, for the second year running, I won't be able to get to YAPC::Europe. That's a real shame.</p></p>

It's been a while since I did all the Perl conferences in a year. It's gotten way too tough, all the conferences are generally around the same time and in different places around the world. And this year there are so many of them!
<p>
I almost decided to cut down on my conferences this year. Anyway, I'm skipping <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/os2003/" title="oreillynet.com">OSCON</a oreillynet.com> due to it being too expensive even if I didn't have to pay flights or entrance. I'm also skipping YAPC::NA and YAPC::Israel. However, I'm going to the <a href="http://www.perlworkshop.de/" title="perlworkshop.de">German Perl Workshop</a perlworkshop.de> in March as I found an 80 quid return flight from Heathrow to Bonn. I'm going to try and make it to <a href="http://yapc.org/America/" title="yapc.org">YAPC::NA</a yapc.org> in June, although the flights I've found so far are a little expensive. And of course, I'll be at <a href="http://yapc.org/Europe/" title="yapc.org">YAPC::Europe</a yapc.org> in July during my sister's birthday.

If you don't pay registration or flights, all that leaves is hotel and food.  This year we're in the middle of downtown Portland, with zillions of cheaper hotels in the area.  The expensive isolation of San Diego is also gone--there are, I am assured, a veritable cornucopia of discount dining establishments within a pebble's fling.<p>

Amen on the bunching up of conferences, though.  I wanted to go to <a href="http://http//www.iscb.org/ismb2003/index.shtml" title="http">ISMB</a http> but it's right before OSCON.  Ptui!</p><p>
