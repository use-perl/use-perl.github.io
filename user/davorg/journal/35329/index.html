<div class="span8">
<p><p>Whilst looking for something completely different over the christmas break I found a drawer full of money in small notes and change. After scratching my head for a minute or so, I remembered where it came from.</p>

<p>In August 2002 Damian Conway spoke in London and at the meeting we had a collection for The Perl Foundation. <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/davorg/journal/7444">We raised ÃÂ£412</a> and I took the money home and was going to pass it on to TPF. It seems I put it in the drawer for safe-keeping and forgot about it.</p>

<p>So, I'm just about to make a donation to TPF to cover this collection. Yahoo Finance tells me that the money is now worth over $800 (rather than the $640 that I calculated at the time) so hopefully that will mitigate some of the effect of inflation. But I'll also bump the amount up a bit in an attempt to cover my embarrassment.</p>

<p>I'm really sorry about this. I'm not usually in the habit of squirrelling away other people's money.</p></p>

<cite>I'm not usually in the habit of squirrelling away other people's money.</cite>

<p>In light of the fact that you didn't squander it, I'm afraid a career in government may not be for you. Good luck in your future endeavors.</p>



<h2>a nice change</h2>

At least this time, we know where our donations are going<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) So often, we have no idea what happens to tpf donations. Thanks for the update.



<h2>Good investment!</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ask/">ask</a> on 2008-01-18T00:21:02</h3>
The way I see it then you did a good investment for TPF by holding on to the money and keeping them in GBP for a while!
