<p><p>Well that's the <a href="http://london.pm.org/lpw/">LPW</a> finished for another year. I hope everyone else who was there enjoyed it as much as I did.</p>

<p>Highlights for me were:</p>

<ul>
<li>Greg talking about how he had recently rediscovered the joy of hacking by writing a couple of small programs that made his life better</li>
<li>Leo and Leon talking about how they wrote <a href="http://www.mightyv.com/">MighTyV</a> in four week's of evenings and weekends</li>
<li>Mark Dominus whose presentations are, of course, always a pleasure to watch</li>
</ul>

<p>If anyone is interested, the slides for my talk on <a href="http://mag-sol.com/talks/db/">Databases and Perl</a> are now online.</p>

<p>Many thanks to everyone involved in organising it (how's that JIT organisational strategy working out?) I'm really looking forward to next year.</p></p>

Nice presentation deck you've got <a href="http://mag-sol.com/talks/db/" title="mag-sol.com">http://mag-sol.com/talks/db/</a mag-sol.com>.  Nice to a tutorial something go from naive SQL to Class::DBI.

<p>Is the logo supposed to be an Onion <b>and</b> a Lightbulb?

</p><p>If I read the source right, this was an S5 presentation?  There seems to be a built in delay between page transition and next strip-tease bullet shown, no matter how fast I click.
The styles that are actually used are in external CSS files, so what's with the "perltidy style" definitions, I don't see them used?

</p><p> <b>Comments</b></p>
<dl> <dt>Slide 2</dt>
<dd>Someone at LPWS probably already mentioned that the   SQL parenthesis <code>")</code> needs to be inside the perl parenthesis like this: <code>)"</code>.</dd>

<dt>Slide 20 (Sample Code)</dt>
<dd>Presumably you mentioned that real code would have to check return values and throw useful errors on at least prepare?</dd>


<dt>Slide 27 (Music::Artist code) (repeated Slide 30)</dt>
<dd>Someone at LPW probably already mentioned that last two lines should begin with <code>Music::Song</code> not <code>Music::Artist</code> -- cut-and-pasteo.</dd>


</dl>

<p>Cheers!</p>

<p>Thanks. Glad you liked it. It was quite a rush getting all that into thirty minutes. Quite a lot of it had to be "here are some interesting things that you should go away and look at later".</p>

<blockquote> <div><i>Is the logo supposed to be an Onion and a Lightbulb?</i></div> </blockquote>

<p>It's the <a href="http://foundation.perl.org/" title="perl.org">Perl Foundation</a perl.org> onion logo.</p>

<blockquote> <div><i>If I read the source right, this was an S5 presentation? There seems to be a built in delay between page transition and next strip-tease bullet shown, no matter how fast I click.

<p>You're right that it's an S5 presentation. But it was created from a POD file using <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/spod5/script/spod5" title="cpan.org">spod5</a cpan.org>. I guess that the extra definitions were added by that.</p>

<p>And thanks for the specific comments on the slides. I'll put them right tonight. Perhaps it's because of the speed I was going, but no-one else spotted them.</p>

<p>Oh, and regarding errors. I stated clearly that detailed discussions of error processing were one of the things that were cut due to time constraints. When I got to the slide you mention (slide 20) I said something like "this is just an example, please don't use it verbatim, it has no error checking and if you use it like that your bosses will all come after me with very big sticks!"</p>
