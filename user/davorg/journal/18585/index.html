<p>I've done a bit of public speaking over the last couple of weeks. Firstly I spoke to the British Computer Society's <a href="http://www.nlondon.bcs.org/review04.html">North London Branch</a>. They were having a meeting about Linux and Open Source in general. I think I was invited along as the token radical open source evangelist so I gave a talk about how so many large companies (Amazon, Yahoo!, etc.) were running a lot of their business using Open Source software. It was nice that the chap from IBM who spoke after me backed up a lot of my points. There was some interesting discussion afterwards and I hope we made a few converts.<br/><br/>Then last Thursday, <a href="http://www.lonix.org.uk/cgi-bin/Lonix?CODE=showMain">Lonix</a> invited <a href="http://london.pm.org/">London.pm</a> to present an <a href="http://www.lonix.org.uk/?searchMeeting&MEETINGID=64">evening of talks on Perl</a>. Somehow I ended up doing a basic introduction to Perl and then speaking about Perl 6 when Simon Cozens had to drop out. Again I think that the audience was interested in what we said and there were some interesting discussions in the pub afterwards.<br/><br/>The slides from all of these talks are on my <a href="http://dave.org.uk/talks/">web site</a>.</p>

Use axpoint -p to get a version without all the transitions for web display.
