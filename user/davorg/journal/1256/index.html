<p><p>This beginners training course is proving to be very
interesting. Here are a couple of scenes from yesterday's
class. Our protaganists are <b>davorg</b>. (the trainer,
our hero) and <b>Visual Basic Programmer</b>[1].

<p><b>Scene One</b>: <i>[davorg is standing at the front of
the class and is explaining a slide that introduces the
comparison operators (<tt>==</tt>, <tt>!=</tt>, 
etc.)]</i></p>

<p><i>VBP:</i> Excuse me, but why do you use two equals
signs to test for equality?</p>
<p><i>d:</i> Because Perl needs to differentiate between
assignment (<tt>=</tt>) and comparision (<tt>==</tt>).
Many other languages (C, Pascal and Java for example) do
the same thing. How does VB do it?</p>
<p><i>VBP:</i> VB just uses the single equals for both.</p>
<p><i>d:</i> OK. So how does it know if you're doing an
assignment or a comparison?</p>
<p><i>VBP:</i> Well, if you're in an <tt>if</tt> statement
then it must be comparision.</p>
<p><i>d:</i> But that stops you from doing an assignment
within a conditional expression.</p>
<p><i>VBP:</i> True, but why would you want to do that?</p>
<p><i>[At this point other members of the class with 
experience in C and Java chime in with examples of why it's
useful to have an assignment in a conditional expression, 
but VBP remains unconvinced.]</i></p>

<p><b>Scene 2:</b> <i>[After the course has finished.
davorg is talking to VBP in order to get more understanding
of his programming experience.]</i></p>

<p><i>VBP:</i> Have you looked at C# at all?</p>
<p><i>d:</i> No, I haven't, but I know people who have and
say it's quite a nice looking language. Not sure that I'd
use it though, as I don't like the idea of paying for a
programming language.</p>
<p><i>VBP:</i> Oh, I see. Personally, I'm far happier using
a language with proper support.</p>

<p><i>[Exit davorg, stage right, stifling major 
giggles.]</i></p>

<p><b>Note to self:</b> Take another look at VB's syntax
before the next class on Monday.</p>

<p>[1] I didn't mention it before, but after the first day
this person told me that Perl looked like a pretty good 
language but that he was used to something more powerful
like VB.</p></p>

<h2>C#</h2>

Actually assignment not being an expression was the one thing I couldn't stand about C#. It's really quite frustrating to have to live in languages without that feature.

I like languages enforcing style on me.  It's easier to get to the point where I can be an expert in that language, because I don't have to worry about thinking for myself or coming up with a style that works for me.  When the language can tell me what is best, I feel safer and smarter and thus happier.

Whooaaa... dude, <em>what</em> are you doing using Perl then!<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)

Perl: It's for sarcastic programmers.

That's all I can say.  Proper support?  I guess if you like paying $100/hr over the phone, waiting on hold and what-not.  Open source rules in that book, hands down and always will rule.  It's nearly impossible to have a closed-book be supported well by a limited few people who have the "keys".

But ya know<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... 20 Million VBP can't be wrong! *laugh*
