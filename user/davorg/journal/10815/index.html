<p><p>Well, we've finally got confirmation of all the recent rumours. In an <a href="http://www.ew.com/ew/report/0,6115,426799~10~0~gellarexplainswhybuffy,00.html">interview</a> in the new <i>Entertainment Weekly</i>, Sarah Michelle Gellar has confirmed that she will be leaving <i>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</i> at the end of the current season.</p>
<p>Still no firm news on the future of the show, but the recent rumours of Faith taking over the main role seem less likely as Eliza Dushka has apparently signed up for a major role in a new series.</p>
<p>As always, keep up with the latest on <a href="http://www.whedonesque.com/">Whedonesque</a>.</p>

<p>Oh, and that interview contains spoilers for the end of season 7.</p></p>

<p>Not having the Buffster there will force the writers into a whole new space, which is a beautiful thing. True fans of the show will still there if the writers produce something of value. Heck, I might even start watching again. When a series doesn't kill off major characters, it becomes Star Trek. I hope SMG finds steady work outside the series, but somehow I think she's nearing the end of her action-hero days.

</p><p>One thing I noticed on BtVS is that Slayers don't live very long. It might have been a fun twist to have Buffy retire to become a Watcher and train the next Slayer. Of course, Giles would have to <b>die, die, die</b>. And maybe Willow too. &gt;-)</p>

<p>True. But Joss Whedon has just <a href="http://www.reuters.com/newsArticle.jhtml?type=televisionNews&amp;storyID=2296208" title="reuters.com">confirmed that the show will end as well</a reuters.com>. Tho' there may be a new spinoff.</p>

Mind you, if you bring "Fray" into the, um, fray, then continuity would have it that Buffy is the last Slayer before Fray.

Well i think thats good news. Buffy was good at first but it has been poor for a few seasons now. I've hardly watched it sice the end of the Mayor and the then departure of all the good characters such as Angel, Cordela and Oz.<br> <br>The Willow, becoming a lesbian, stroyline was very stupid and was another reason which put me of watching it. Also Bufy rising from the dead was stupid. They should have stopped it there and then.
