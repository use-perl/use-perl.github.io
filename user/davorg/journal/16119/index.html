<p>I was just poking around on the <a href="http://www.sra.gov.uk/">Strategic Rail Authority</a> web site in order to gather information for my <a href="http://dave.org.uk/blog/archives/000274.html">railway rant</a> when I noticed that all of their web pages had a .tt2 extension. Which is nice :)</p>

<h2>The wrong kind of air</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ajt/">ajt</a> on 2003-12-02T14:18:36</h3>
<p>While I accept that there are many problems with the UK's rail system that a lick of paint (one of the few good things to come out of privatisation) can't fix, the system is in dire need of a few billion quid...</p>

<p>Yesterday my other half checked with the dynamic live train running system to check if her train was on time, the system interestingly had the train running on time, except that the details page showed that it had arrived on time at stations in the future. When she got to the station, it was of course delayed, even though the live details said it wasn't. Naturally there was no explanation or useful eta of the service.</p>

<p>On our way home (an 8 minute train ride) our train was 40 minutes late - with no explanation. Another train going to London was delayed indefinitely until they could find a driver.....</p>

<p>Our village has station has bomb warnings every 15 minutes in English, French and German, even though it's unmanned most of the day and there isn't anyone to remove suspicious packages!</p>

<p>We have had the wrong kind of snow, leaves on the line, incomprehensible pricing systems, obtuse rules, and more chaos than I thought it was possible to have. I am now waiting for the wrong kind of air slowing the trains down....</p>

<p>Come back BR all is forgiven.........</p>

They even have Dublin Core metadata! I have to admit, I'm impressed, which is really rare when it comes to travel-related websites.



<h2>Just wondering...</h2>

Just wondering, are you interested in hearing about websites using TT? Do you have an estimate about how many sites are using the toolkit?

I really have no idea how many people are using TT, but it might make an interesting section of the TT web site.<br> <br>I think I'll suggest it on the TT mailing list.<br>

We do this for MasonHQ.com, and it's useful for me as a consultant to be able to point to a list that includes Amazon, Salon, &amp; AvantGo.  If there's people trying to push TT2 as an "acceptable" technology, a list of users is a good thing.

<ul> <li><em>
just as important as trying to raise the profile of TT2 is the demonstration of what it can do. more importantly how.</em></li> </ul>
<p>it wasn't until I downloaded stas bekmans (<a href="http://www.stason.org/works/modules.html#docset" title="stason.org">stason.org</a stason.org> and perl.apache.org - both tt powered) <a href="http://cpan.org/authors/id/S/ST/STAS/" title="cpan.org">docset</a cpan.org> <a href="http://cpan.org/authors/id/S/ST/STAS/DocSet-0.15.readme" title="cpan.org">until I realised TT powered the site</a cpan.org>. Looking at the code allowed me to see how the to build a html-&gt;pdf, html-&gt;print site.</p>
<p>there is great power in the demonstration of working sites<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... especially with source.</p>
