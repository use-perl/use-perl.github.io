<p><p>I don't for a second think that pudge's views are
invalid. I disagree with them, but that doesn't invalidate 
them. Besides, I'm not naive enough to believe that most
(or even many) people agree with me. From what I'm seeing,
pudge represents mainstream opinion here.</p>

<p>What should we do? Well the US government can start by
taking a long hard look at its policies over that last
fifty years and work out just what it is they are doing
that makes them so disliked in certain parts of the world.
They can consider whether those policies are worth the
risk that someone will react in the way that Bin Laden
has. Pudge refuses to accept that withdrawing from the
Middle East is a option. I think it should be seriously
considered.</p>

<p>If it was a nation that was attacking you, then you
might (only <i>might</i>) be justified in attacking them.
But it's not. Destroying Afganistan won't help. Al-Quaida
will still exist. Even if you capture or kill all the
leaders, the beliefs will still be there. Others will
take their place. Other organisations will spring up with
the same agenda. Have you listened to these people talk?
They have their own warped logic. The believe completely
that they will win because they have God on their side.
You can kill all of them, and the people that take their
places will not have learned anything from seeing it
happen. You'll only strengthen their resolve to carry out
more atrocities. These attacks will achieve nothing other
than enabling our leaders to say that they did 
something.</p>

<p>I didn't say that 6000 people had been killed in 
Afganistan. I only commented that there is no information
in the Western press about how many might have died. Pudge
believes that it will be a very small number of civilians.
He obviously has far more faith in US and UK military
intelligence and technology than I do. I don't believe
half of the propaganda that we're fed about a) our ability
to identify appropriate targets or b) our ability to hit 
only those targets once identified.</p>

<p>I can see that people's patriotism is very important to 
them, but I really can't understand it. I've never 
understood how people can get so attached to an artificial
construct like a nation. And I can't see any positive
effects of being patriotic.</p>

<p>Yes pudge, I did read to the end of your piece. And I
do understand your arguments. I just can't agree with them.
I'd just like to add that no matter what our differences
are on politics, I have great respect for the work you do
for Perl and appreciate the fact that we can have this 
debate in such a civilised manner. If we're all still here,
I'll buy you a beer at the next Perl Conference.</p></p>
