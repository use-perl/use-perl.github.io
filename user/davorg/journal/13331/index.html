<p><p>Not being at OSCON makes me feel a bit out of the loop. For example, I found this intriguing comment in <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/3443">chromatic's weblog</a>.</p>
<blockquote><i>"[Gloria Wall and I] briefly talked about Larry's impending State of the Onion talk. London.pm will be happy."</i></blockquote>
<p>I have no idea what that could possibly mean.</p></p>

<p>I know the feeling!  Apparently, Larry's going to make a major announcement regarding Perl5 and/or 6 tonight.  Everyone's dropping hints, but that's about it.  I'll be at the State of Onion speech and I must confess to being on tenterhooks about it.</p>

The State of the Onion doesn't start until 3am my time and I'm not <i>that</i> intrigued that I'm staying up until then.<br> <br>There had bloody well better be some interesting use.perl journals to read by the time I get up tomorrow morning!

<p>There doesn't seem to be very much said about it at all. Then again, like you I'm not as OSCON so have no idea what the buzz there is like, and I've already had discussions with sky about it last week, so I've exhausted my thinking out loud. I'm sure we at london.pm will all do our best to hinder sky, by repeatedly dragging him to <a href="http://london.pm.org/meetings/" title="pm.org">drinking establishments</a pm.org> when he should be locked at home coding. For starters, in the next two weeks we have the techmeet and an emergency social meeting (Elaine &amp; Jarkko in town), but it looks like things settle down in August. Quick - everyone come visit London. Spend lots of money, boost our economy, create social emergencies.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, roll on <a href="http://perl.plover.com/lt/osc2003/perl.html" title="plover.com"> <i>The State of Onion</i> to see what that brings.</a plover.com> </p>

<p>I reckon that it's a project to re-write all of CPAN in parrot assembler. Starting on 2004/04/01 at <b>A</b>, so as to <b>c</b>onvert all the i<b>m</b>portant modules over <b>e</b>arly.</p>

<p>Well, considering the London.pm only talks about Buffy, ponies, orange or beer and, given that Larry likely isn't as fond of beer, orange and ponies as the London.pm, I would take a stab at the idea that Buffy is on the menu<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<p>Uh...I knew what was going on....but was tempted to say what with everyone hinting at it though decided against it.</p>
