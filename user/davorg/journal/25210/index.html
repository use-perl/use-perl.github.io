<p>Either I don't know as much Perl as I think I do or <a href="http://hiddenperl.com">this quiz</a> is pretty broken.<br/><br/>As far as I can see, at least one of the questions has no right answer.</p>

<h3><a href="/user/rjbs/">rjbs</a> on 2005-06-15T13:06:33</h3>
The questions are not all entirely asinine, although the "correct" answers indicate some confusion on the part of the testers.  More horrible, though, is that flash intro...

Which of the following expression gives the value cat ?<br>

This doesn't compile, but of course, they didn't use " in a bunch of the other questions either.

Reminded me of the brainbench test - mostly using obscure perl4-isms, which is only relevant today if you get the unenviable task of maintaining some nasty code.</p>

<p>And even if you put quotes on <tt>print @x{'C', 'C++'}</tt> it prints "RitchieStroustrup", not "Ritchie Stroustrup".</p>

<p>But neither of those were the problem I was thinking of.</p>

Maybe hiring someone to maintain some nasty code is exactly what they're going after. Of course, that doesn't jive with their claim of looking for the best Perl hackers. And why on earth would anyone put up a test like this claiming to be looking for the best-of-the-best? I know a few places I could go where I couldn't throw a rock without hitting one. And that Flash intro was just horrid. It must have been written by the winner of their test to find the world's best Flash composer.

I don't think so.  I've been in touch with them, and even corrected 10 of their questions with various levels of LART application.  They fully believed (a) their questions were satisfactory, albeit hard and (b) they weren't trying to trick anyone with impossible questions.
<p>
I presume they've updated the quiz by now, but I haven't had time to go back to check.</p>

<h2>Very broken</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ChrisDolan/">ChrisDolan</a> on 2005-06-15T13:38:57</h3>
The quiz is dumb.  Most of them can be answered with perl -e.  The broken questions:<br> <br>1) None of the above.  The answer is "\n", unless strict is on.<br> <br>6) None of the above.  The answer is $p-&gt;[3] or $$p[3].<br> <br>11) Both b and c are right answers<br> <br>14) None of the above.  The answer is "\n" because "perl\n" is not equal to "perl"<br> <br>15) Syntax error: Can't modify constant item in postincrement (++) at -e line 1, near "C++"<br>

Those questions numbers don't help. I think the questions some out in random order each time.<br>



<h2>Re:Very broken</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Ovid/">Ovid</a> on 2005-06-15T14:30:59</h3>
<p>They randomize the question order every time you take it.</p>

But not in the allotted time!

<h2>Consider the source</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/wickline/">wickline</a> on 2005-06-16T01:32:55</h3>
<dl> <dt> <strong>The chosen ones can expect:</strong> </dt> <dd>
   <ul> <li>An offer letter from the worldwide leader
            in marketing automation technologies
   </li> <li>A surprising (make that stunning) pay packet,
            benefits and possible stock options
   </li> <li>A superlative work environment</li>
</ul> </dd> <dt> <strong>Translation:</strong> </dt> <dd>
   <ul> <li>An offer letter from the worldwide leader
            <em>in spamming</em>
   </li> <li> <em>make millions selling our list of email addresses</em>
   </li> <li> <em>while working in your spare time from home</em> </li> </ul>
</dd> </dl>
<p>The quiz sucks because the author sucks because only somone sucky would work for a spammer.</p>



<h2>Camel alert</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/runrig/">runrig</a> on 2005-06-16T04:49:43</h3>
I wonder if they got permission from O'Reilly to use the camel (the bouncing camel on the "Perl Trivia" tab).



<h2>job offer!</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/lbr/">lbr</a> on 2005-06-17T11:30:35</h3>
Hah, got a mail from them now - because of my "excellent performance in the quiz", they want to offer me a "Hot Perl Job in Bangalore".  Of course this offer was sent with 11 visible adresses in the To-field.

It's an interesting way to hire people, but maybe saying upfront that the job's in India would be smart<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)
