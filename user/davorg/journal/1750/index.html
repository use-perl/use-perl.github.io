How could you tell?  All I found on that supposed review page were a series of advertisements and links to "comment on this page".  Was there really a review in there, or are you just citing random links with no content?

<p>In amongst all the ads there's a bunch of stuff about all wizards are evil and how showing them in a good light will warp the minds of our children.</p>
<p>And at the bottom of the page there's a list of every incident that they dislike.</p>
<p>Oh, and the thermometers mean something too.</p>

But wizards <b>are</b> evil.  That's why they all have little thunderbolt scars on their foreheads.  And have pet owls.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

<p> <i>"The bottom line is that God clearly commands that witchcraft, sorcery and wizardry are evil. He gives no situations under which these evils are not evil: no conditions under which these evils may be tolerated. There is no such thing as a "good" witch. Not even Wendy."</i> </p>

<p>Holy shit batman, the fucking Salem witch burners are back! Oh well, just be happy they aren't your parents and never visit Salem<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

"The witch burners" never left, nor did the actual witches.  We just hid them in a corner for a century or so, until the web came along.

<p>Anything sufficiently beyond our technological understanding is usually uderstood as magic. So, if the future is yesterdays magic and a story of fantasy involving magic from the past is magic and the future is clearly magic...that must not leave much that isn't magic. Pity they must not have much left to enjoy in this lifetime. I think the big dig is magical but....</p>

Ah, the amusements of ludicrous organized religion.
<p>
It would be funnier if organized religions didn't kill people so regularly, though.</p>

<h3><a href="/user/pudge/">pudge</a> on 2001-12-21T18:16:23</h3>
Oh, please.  Blaming this, or "killing people", on "organized religion" is like blaming bad programming on the language, instead of on the programmers themselves.



<blockquote>

<h2>Re:got bigotry?</h2>

I didn't blame anything.  People get killed for any number of reasons.
<p>
I find organized religions funny; I would find them more humorous if they had not, in history, had a tendency to get humans killed.
</p><p>
I apologize for bringing the point up, since it's so utterly non-perl.

<br>
<br>I would find Perl more humorous if it had not, in history, had a tendency to make people write bad code.

{Perl} is not equivalent to {organized religions}. {organized religions} covers an enormous set of sets; {Perl} covers a set. Perhaps
<p><blockquote><div>
I would find *organized programming groups* more funny if they had not, in history, had a tendency to make people write bad code.
</div></blockquote>
<p>
would be a more analogous statement?
</p><p>
You're right, though.  'organized religions' was too much of a generalization.  I have a tendency to view any 'organized' things as 'intolerant' things, from religions to corporations to governments.
</p><p>
I apologize, both to the individuals within them and the groups themselves; my experience with organized anything has been pretty limited.  (Bad, but limited.)
</p><p>
I should know better by now, having had some chance to examine organizations that are both tolerant and beneficial to humanity.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>
