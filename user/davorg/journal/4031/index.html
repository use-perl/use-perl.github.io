<p><p>I deleted the "censorship" entry[1]. One man's censorship is another man's (or woman's) protection of their livelihood. I don't have the energy to argue my case any further and only seem to annoy all the wrong people. I really don't want that on my permanent record.</p>

<p>I hope that <a href="/user/2shortplanks">2shortplanks</a>' and <a href="/user/Simon">Simon</a>'s reviews of Liz's book appear soon. I'm going to refrain from commenting on her book in public from now on.</p>

Unless you're planning on running for a political office, I firmly believe in leaving journal entries alone.  Even if you've changed your mind, you'll at least remember how you felt at the time.  It would have to be particularly heinous and vulgar for me to delete one of mine.  You know, that entry you thought was funny at 4am while drunk off your ass, sorta thing.
<p>
You can always edit a post with an "update" instead.  I find it somewhat disturbing that people are deleting their own entries.  If I say something offensive, I *may* issue an apology (then again, I may not) but I *won't* delete the post.  I guess it's the historian in me.</p>

<p>I find it a disturbing trend as well but the path of least resistance is the way of silence. A world of people saying nothing to offend is far more offensive than a world that says what it means. </p>

testify!<br> <br>I've said many offensive things and am willing to take the heat for it.<br> <br>It's one thing for a site to censor offending posts and quite a disturbing trend when one censors oneself.<br> <br>Any vitriol I spew is mine. I'll own up to it but I expect to have the chance to rebut and clarify. Of course, people will tend to quote things out of context to make their point or at least show another in a bad light if it servers their purpose.<br> <br>I'm glad you posted your article. It made me check out her site, her book, and made me think. I remeber flipping through her book. I don't recall thinking it was anything special. However, from the excerpts on Amazon it seems to be directed at folks with zero programming knowledge.<br> <br>I'll give her the benefit of the doubt that it does a decent job introducing Perl and CGI. However, I would hope that it would teach good programming practices.<br> <br>I guess I'll have to hit a bookstore and give a more thorough skimming (is that an oxymoron or what?) to decide for myself if it is a decent beginners book.

<i>I don't have the energy to argue my case any further and only seem to annoy all the wrong people.</i> <br> <br>Why do you feel you <b>have</b> to argue your case?  It's your journal mate, submit your post and don't worry about bloody offending anyone[1].  If you want to argue your case then more power to ya.  If you don't want to argue it - <b>don't</b>, stay silent and move on.<br> <br>[1] I don't remember you being shy about submitting posts in the past Dave - I recall a few pudge-davorg classics last year<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)
