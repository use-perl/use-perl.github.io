<div class="span8">
<p><p>I've taught beginners before. I know that beginners
often get confused by the use of <tt>$</tt> to denote
single array elements (e.g. <tt>$array[0]</tt>). I know
<i>why</i> they get confused but I think I'm pretty good
at getting them to understand it - this is, at least, partly because I think that the rule makes sense.</p>
<p>Yesterday I gave my first beginners course for a while. More importantly it was the the first beginners course I'd given since we've known a lot about the shape of Perl 6.</p>
<p>As always, there was someone who didn't like array (and hash) elements using <tt>$</tt>. "Oh, I understand exactly why it's there", he said, "but I just don't think it's the most logical way to do it." Of course I disagreed with him and tried to bring him round to my way of thinking. I found this was harder than usual because I now know that in Perl 6 array elements will be accessed using <tt>@</tt>. It's a lot harder trying to explain away something as logical when you know that it's going to change in the near future.</p>
<p>Have any other trainers come across this problem?</p></p>

<h2>Technology apologists</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ziggy/">ziggy</a> on 2001-11-13T15:17:33</h3>
I haven't taught Perl to beginners, but I've taught various bits of XML to beginners and intermediate programmers alike.
<p>
I've found it to be rather common to need to apologize for the state of the technology being presented.  This could be something as simple as using <tt>$array[0]</tt> vs. <tt>@array[0]</tt> in Perl, or much more unfortunate like the state of XML.  Most recently, I had to teach DTD syntax and usage to a bunch of programmers who were going to be using XML Schema, and had to defend DTDs, only to illustrate the failings of DTDs now that XML Schema exists -- and then to backpedal on XML Schema because it's not widely liked or implemented out in the field yet (and the syntax is kinda backwards as well).
</p><p>
I've heard Python trainers talk about similar issues, like meaningful whitespace.  XP presenters also plea to suspend disbelief about pair programming, or spend a lot of time defending pair programming (or test-first programming, or other facets of XP).  Thinking back to when I learned C &lt;mumble&gt; years ago, I remember the professor took a stand on learning how CPUs work, as if to apologize for the incredibly low-level nature of the C language.</p>

Solution: Teach schematron for validating XML instead. Actually, I'd kill for a decent RELAX implementation any day over a Schemas implementation!

<h2>You make no apologies and just deal</h2>

I find the best thing to do is just lay it out straight. "It seemed to make sense at the time, but it turned out not to be a good idea. Cope. We're fixing this." I can pretty much guarantee it's not the first thing like this your students will have come across...<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

You can make that statement today with a straight face.  How about 2 years ago?

<h2>Why is $array[0] such a bad thing?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Purdy/">Purdy</a> on 2001-11-14T14:00:14</h3>
As I understand it, the <i>funny character</i> demarks the context of the variable.  I haven't played around with this (yet), but what if the array was a list of refs to other arrays?  Would that be @array[0] or @$array[0]?  If the former, then all the more reason the funny character helps, as it denotes the context.

Unfortunately it's worse than you think.
<br>
<br>@$array[0] binds the @ more tightly than the [0], so it expects $array to be an array ref, which you're de-referencing, rather than $array[0] being the array ref. Except it doesn't work, because as you know, you don't say @x[0], you say $x[0], so when you say @$array[0], it thinks you're dereferencing $array, not @array, and $array doesn't exist (well it might, but it's not what you meant).
<br>
<br>Now @{$x[0]} will give you the de-referenced array in the first entry in the @x array. Because here we're being explicit about the precedence using curlies to bind it. But it can get a bit more confusing, because say you wanted the second entry in the first array? i.e. given:
<br> <tt>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; my @x = ([1,2], [3,4]);
<br> </tt>
<br>So you want the "2" above. Now that's:
<br> <tt>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; my $two = @{$x[0]}[1];
<br> </tt>
<br>But we got a scalar! Now what happened to that "symbol means context" thing here? Screwey, huh?
<br>
<br>Fixing this is a Good Thing (tm).

<h2>Perl to beginners</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/clintp/">clintp</a> on 2001-11-16T14:32:42</h3>
I never have a problem with the $/@ distinction in my beginner's classes.  I simply grind it into their heads that "$ always means 'one' of something".  One element of an array, one item from a hash, and in the case of scalars it's self evident.  Keeping the rules simple (at least to begin with), having a "catchphrase" that embodies the rule, and repeating it often works well.
<br>
<br>And as for Perl 6... I don't like scaring the novices with evil that hasn't yet come to pass.
