<div class="span8">
<p>Some first impressions of <a href="http://fedora.redhat.com/">Fedora Core 1</a>.
<ul>
<li>On the laptop: Upgrading a system which has Ximian Desktop installed doesn't work well. It breaks bigtime. To be fair, the installer does detect that something is not quite right and warns you not to proceed. Heed that advice. I didn't. I had to do a complete re-installation of the OS. So I have a pristine new Fedora installation.</li>
<li>On the desktop: If, like me, your computer has a wireless card which relies on the wlan-ng drivers then you're on your own. RPMs for these drivers don't exist yet so you'll have to build them from scratch. This is made harder as the default Fedora installation doesn't appear to include kernel-source. I decided to wimp out and wait for prebuilt RPMs. Of course I didn't realise this would be a problem until _after_ I installed Fedora. I now have a nice new re-installation of RedHat 9 on that machine.</li>
<li>These errors were all my fault. Fedora itself seems very nice. It's just RedHat 10 - or rather what RedHat 10 would have been. If you liked RedHat 8 and 9 (and I did) then you'll like Fedora even more.</li>
</ul></p>
