<p>This follows on from what <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/ajt/journal/16013">ajt</a> said yesterday.<br/><br/>A friend called me and asked for some help uploading a web site that she had made to her web host's computer. She had built the site using Publisher and was uploading it using something called the Microsoft Web Publishing Wizard (or something like that).<br/><br/>Once we'd worked out how to upload it I was able to look at the <a href="http://www.say-aah.co.uk/">site</a>. Look at the HTML source. It's horrible. All that pointless Javascript near the top. Loads of unnecessary spacer gifs in unnecessary table cells. I estimate that the page is three or four times the size that it needs to be.<br/><br/>My friend is an intelligent and computer literate person. She just has no real knowledge of (or interest in) HTML so she used the first tool that came to hand which claimed to enable her to build a web site. And that tool then proceeded to dump this monstrous HML code all over her web site.<br/><br/>I know that Publisher isn't really a web page editor, but it claims to be able to create sites. Which, to my mind, should mean that it produces something that at least approaches reasonable HTML. It's no wonder that the web is so full of crap HTML if the entry-level tools are producing stuff like this.<br/><br/>Of course, Publisher can't be blamed for her use of Comic Sans throughout the site :)</p>

<h2>&quot;website&quot;?!?</h2>

You even dare to call that a website?
<p>I personally don't think it looks half bad, but virtually everything is turned into an image! The only thing that is text, is the intro at the top, "A unique event...", and the footer.
</p><p>Yup, all MS Publisher's work.</p>
