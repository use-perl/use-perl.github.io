<p><p>This evening I got an email from someone threatening DOS and other attacks on my web server. What would be the best (legal) way to respond to that?</p></p>

<h2>ipchains at the ready</h2>

I would assume that you'd want to have your ipchains/iptables/whatever inbound IP filters ready to be modified.

Well, the threats were a reaction to something on my site that this person objected to. I've removed that content so I'm pretty sure that the attacks won't happen. But I was just thinking that I've got this email, so I should probably do something with that - forward it to their ISP or something.

Depending on the ISP, it's not likely to do a lot, though that's probably still your best bet - just the threat might not be enough to get them nuked, though if they actually carried out the attack they'd certainly be in violation of their ToS.  And if the cops there are like the FBI is here, unless you've got tens of thousands of dollars of damage to report, there's zilcho they'll do for you.

Pass along the email to the cops.<br> <br>They might do something, they might not.
