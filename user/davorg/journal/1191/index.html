<p><p><a href="~2shortplanks">2shortplanks</a> mentions the
"new heretics" in his latest journal. I thought it might
be worthwhile explaining exactly what all this nonsense is
about.</p>
<p>When we started london.pm, social meetings were always
on the first Thursday of the month. We <i>did</i> make
occasional exceptions (IIRC, the first time David Adler
visited us he was in town the week after the meeting should
have been - so we postponed it) but generally we kept to
this rule.</p>
<p>At some point in the next year (and looking at
<tt>cal 1999</tt> I'm guessing it was July) the meeting was
on the first of the month and unusually Greg McCarroll 
wasn't there. The following Wednesday Greg sent an email to 
the list saying "which pub are we all meeting in tomorrow?".
We pointed out to him that the meeting had been the 
previous week and he complained loudly that having a 
meeting on the first of the month didn't give him time to
realise that a new month had started. He proposed a new
system whereby a meeting that would fall on the first of
the month, would be moved to the eighth[1]. This system
became known as the McCarroll Heresy and Greg's followers
became known as The Heretics.</p>
<p>Obviously, in most months the Heretics were happy to
have a meeting on the same date of the rest of us, but
in any given year, there is at least one month where 
the first is a Thursday. I'm not sure what happened in
2000 (there was only one problematic month - June), but
in 2001 Greg started to promote Heretics Meetings that
were held on the eighth. 2001 was blessed with three such
months (February, March and November) so it was pretty
much seen as an excuse for extra meetings.</p>
<p>Then Greg raised the stakes. He runs the auction that
traditionally ends YAPC::Europe and this summer he asked
me if he minded if he auctioned the right to decide the
date of our meetings. Not being particularly attached to
any particular date, I agreed.</p>
<p>There are plenty of descriptions of the auction in
journals from YAPC::Europe (I even think there is a video)
but in the end we let Greg win - it cost him a lot of money
tho'. As a result, London.pm now follows the McCarroll
Heresy when determining the dates of its official 
meetings. November 8th will be the first such meeting.</p>
<p>It didn't stop there tho'. A number of people were
still attached to the "old ways" and wanted to continue
holding meetings on the dates that their forebears did.
So we now have a group of "New Heretics" who will always
hold a meeting on the first Thurday of the month. Their
first meeting was on November 1st.</p>
<p>Where will it end? Who knows. Hopefully we can avoid
an out and out schism and continue to live in peace and
harmony with people of such different beliefs.</p>

<p>[1]This was later described as <i>"london.pm meetings 
take place on the Thursday following the first Wednesday of 
the month."</i></p></p>
