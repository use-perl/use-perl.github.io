  As you might know, I have political opinions that <em>could</em> be considered close to those of the Le Monde Diplomatique. But as it is, I'm not at all surprised at the fact that they would be so moronic.
</p>

<p>
  Le Monde Diplo (as we call it here) is indeed a leftist paper, and when they have guests (such as Susan George) the articles can be quite good. But all the regular writers there are antiquated ultra-leftists that don't understand anything about politics, not to mention the Internet which a few see as an embodiment of capitalism (in its 19th century version) in all the evil that that implies. They also tend to be extremely alarmist on pretty much anything without degrees or nuances whether they're talking about a potential nuclear disaster or two people in unfair yet mild trouble with justice.
</p>

<p>
  Don't bother being polite with them, they're not worth it.

<h2>Le Monde Duplo</h2>

As Madame de Pompadour said when Canada fell, "All Canada is good for, is for getting me furs."
<p>And similarly, Le Monde Diplo's attitude is that all that the world outside France (in fact, outside Paris) is good for, is for giving them something to be indignant about.  I mean, there you go, EXISTING... and yet not in FRANCE!  You see how this makes you a bad man, oui?</p>
