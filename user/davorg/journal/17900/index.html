<p>Today I am mostly hating spidernet.co.ro.<br/><br/>Since about 10pm last night, they have been sending me an email every two minutes informing me that they have stopped an email addressed to me as it contains "potentially malicious code". The reference numbers would imply that it's a _different_ email they are blocking each time.<br/><br/>Apparently the emails in question come from MAILER-DAEMON@spiderwall.spidernet.co.ro.<br/><br/>A curse on over-helpful and badly configured virus protection software.</p>

<h2>Drop them...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Matts/">Matts</a> on 2004-03-16T00:09:30</h3>
For about 6 months now I've had qpsmtpd drop on the floor any mail from MAILER-DAEMON or postmaster or the null sender. I don't even SMTP reject. I actually OK the message and then dump it.<br> <br>Yes I *know* this is bad. But when you get one legitimate bounce per month and THOUSANDS of illegitimate ones then bounce messages lose their value utterly and completely. It's a very sad state of affairs, but I'm thinking of ways that this can be fixed.

I don't really want to drop all bounce notifications just yet, but I'd happily drop all mail from this domain.<br> <br>But unfortunately it's not as simple as that. The mail is actually being sent to the admin address for one of the nms mailing lists. So by the time it's been thru the sourceforge mailman setup and been redirected to me the envelope from header is a sourceforge address.<br> <br>But if anyone knows how to get get qmail to reject email based on an internal header rather than the envelope from header then I'd be very interested.<br> <br>Maybe I can do something by tweaking the mailman settings...<br>

<p>Sounds like a job for qpsmtpd.</p>
