<div class="span8">
<p><p>We're a bunch of healthy outdoor geeks in London. Every so often a group of us like to go off for a nice long walk. We did one on Sunday to visit five of the London churches designed by Nicholas Hawksmoor.</p>

<p>Hawksmoor is a very interesting person. <a href="http://www.barbelith.com/cgi-bin/articles/00000054.shtml">Some people</a> see his churches as "centres of malevolent energies" and even suggest connections with the Jack the Ripper murders. The five churches that we visited are certainly amongst the most impressive religious buildings in London and whne you're looking up at them you can't help feel that there's something <i>slightly strange</i> about them.</p>
<p>If you'd like to see for yourself, I've put <a href="http://www.dave.org.uk/cgi-bin/pics/hawksmoor">my photos of the walk</a> online.</p>
<p>If you'd like to know more about the churches, thne I thoroughly recommend Peter Ackroyd's novel <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0140171134"><i>Hawksmoor</i></a>. In fact, if you're at all interested in the weirder side of London history then any of Ackroyd's books are recommended.</p></p>

Nice photographs.<br> <br>I once went to see Saint Mary Woolnoth because it is mentioned in The Waste Land.<br> <br> <blockquote><div>To where Saint Mary Woolnoth kept the hours<br>With a dead sound on the final stroke of nine.</div></blockquote> <br>Some years later I passed it several times coming from Lloyds Register.<br> <br>

<blockquote><div> <i>Saint Mary Woolnoth [...] is mentioned in The Waste Land</i> </div></blockquote>
<p>THANK YOU! I was <i>sure</i> that it was mentioned in a poem I knew, but I couldn't remember which one. I was convinced it was Tennyson so I was looking for it there.</p>
<p>I'd never have thought of looking in Eliot.</p>

But next time you do that walk loaded with black and white film, take along a deep red filter to help darken the skys and bring out some cloud detail. Only catch is it'll knock about two stops of your exposure times, so take a tripod too. (And if you're going to be walking it'd probably be a good idea to borrow a carbon fibre 'pod).<br> <br>I particularly liked the 'reflection' one. If only I still had my Wista I'd be tempted to go and get a 5x4 version of that image...

<i>several months later...</i> <p>
As my wife is reading Alan Moore and Eddie Campbell comic book <i>From Hell</i>, (I plan to read it too), I made a google search on "hawksmoor churches london ripper" and guess what ?? it points me to your journal. No matter what I try to find on the web, I always seem to go back to Perl those days.</p>

<p>And bizarrely enough, I've also just read <i>From Hell</i> (and seen the film). I wrote about it recently in my <a href="http://ician.co.uk/archives/000017.html" title="ician.co.uk">other blog</a ician.co.uk>.</p>
