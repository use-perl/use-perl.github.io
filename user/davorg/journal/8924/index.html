<p><p>Two years ago must have been about the time that  my domain-buying was at its height. I've been getting a lot of emails from my web hosts asking if I want them to renew domains for me.</p>

<p>I've let the lampmagic.(com|org|net) domains go. I had planned to use them to set up some kind of LAMP systems support resource, but I never got enough enthusiasm (or tuits) for it.</p>

<p>Another domain I've let go is a little more galling. Just over two years ago I was sitting in a restaurant with my wife and a friend and we came up with a good idea for a site. We thought that it would be a lot of fun if there was a web site where you could go and try to find old school friends and get in contact with them. I registered the domain i-remember-you.com but (of course) didn't have the time to do anything with it. A few months later <a href="http://www.friendsreunited.co.uk/">Friends Reunited</a> appeared and was very successful.</p>
<p>Note to self: start acting on your ideas :-/</p></p>

<h2>A familiar story</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/SuperCruncher/">SuperCruncher</a> on 2002-11-13T14:51:09</h3>
I was considering setting up a site to let people practice for the UK theory driving test. I was also considering setting up a guide to Northern Ireland. But I never got round to that either. And I was going to set up lots of other things too... but well...<p>
Interestingly, I recently saw an ad for <a href="http://www.accenture.com/" title="accenture.com">Accenture</a accenture.com>. While I don't really like this company (despite doing some good work, I just can't help but think of them as a bit wishy-washy). The ad depicted some writing on a beach about to get washed off when the tide came in. Anyway, the gist of it was simply: it's not how many ideas you <b>have</b>, it's how many you <b>put into practice</b>. So hopefully I'll take this to heart.</p>
