<p><p>I've just got an email from Vee at O'Reilly saying that my <i>Idiomatic Perl</i> tutorial proposal has been accepted for this year's <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/os2002/">Open Source Convention</a>. This is excellent news because, as it's a three hour tutorial, it means they'll pay for my flight and one night in the hotel. They'll even give me some money which will offset the cost of the other nights in the hotel.</p>
<p>For the last two years I've paid my own flights and hotel bills and it all gets very expensive. Last year I saved a lot of money by speaking and therefore not paying to get into the conference, but it still cost me far too much. I'd told myself that the only way I was going this year was if I could give a tutorial.</p>
<p>So this is excellent news. I get to be in the london.pm quiz team that beats pudge's team yet again :) Thanks to everyone on the program committee who voted for my tutorial.</p>

<p>And in other news - the UK magazine <a href="http://www.linuxformat.co.uk">Linux Format</a> have asked me to write short series of articles on CGI programming. If it goes well I'll be able to use the articles as the basis for the potential book that I mentioned <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/davorg/journal/2953">earlier</a>.</p></p>
