<p><p>When I posted my <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/davorg/journal/8768">journal entry</a> yesterday, it was because I thought that <tt>$employer</tt> was having financial problems.</p>
<p>Today they confirm the suspicion by making me redundant.</p></p>

I was under the impression that this last job was meant to be a permanent position?  It seems like you've been there less long tham the average contractor though...

<p>It was a permanent job. I've been there for less than five months.</p>

<p>The upside is that I <i>will</i> be paid for last month's work (which was in doubt until yesterday).</p>

<p>IMHO there's no longer a big difference as far as job longevity is concerned (at least in the US).  I've done contract work at my previous location for about a dozen years (off and on), so I'm more familiar with their systems than their average employee because I've been there longer.  But I choose to stay on the contract side because I like being able to leave and return.</p>
<p>Really, other than taxation, I no longer see any significant differences between contractors and "permanent" employees.  The term is a misnomer.</p>
