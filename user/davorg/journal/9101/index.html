<div class="span8">
<p><p>A few months ago, I <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/davorg/journal/5486">wrote</a> about how I'd been very annoyed by the Friends of Le Monde Diplomatique when they'd added me to a mailing list without my permission and then got quite rude when I asked them to explain their actions. My retaliation to this was to write an article about it on my web sit in the hope that it would get enough Google karma to be reasonably high in a <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=friends+le+monde+diplomatique">search</a> for the organisation.</p>
<p>It seems I was successful. My page is currently fourth in that list. This seems to have also come to the attention of "the Friends" as this evening I got an email from the same chap that I'd enjoyed corresponding with previously. The subject of the email is "Apology" and it does finally attempt to explain where they got my address from (or rather, it explains that they have no idea where it came from) and goes on to promise that in the future they will ask people before signing them up to their mailing lists.</p>
<p>It finishes by saying that if I "feel the childish need" to add this email to my web page then they will "take appropriate action".</p>
<p>I guess I need to update the <a href="http://dave.org.uk/diplo.shtml">article</a> now.</p></p>

<h2>Gosh, I love irony</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Ovid/">Ovid</a> on 2002-11-23T00:47:45</h3>
<p>First off, I certainly hope you do update the page.  They certainly deserve that for the churlish behavior they have exhibited.</p>

<p>Second, I truly appreciate the irony of representatives of "Le Monde Diplomatique" being such an undiplomatic group of twits.  No, not just undiplomatic, but racist, too.  Accusing you of being "very English"?  Sheesh.  I also can't help but wonder if they noticed the irony of their asking you not to email them again?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>



<h2>Aim higher</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/darobin/">darobin</a> on 2002-11-27T14:20:07</h3>
<p>
  You might want to aim directly above them and try to contact <em>Le Monde Diplomatique</em> directly. They may not be smarter but it could be worth a try. I'd be happy to provide the French translation if need be.
