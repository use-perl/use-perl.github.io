<div class="span8">
<p><p>I've made a (small) donation to the Perl Development
Fund. It's nowhere near as large as I'd like but, like
Piers, my situation is somewhat different to last year and,
like Matt, I have a very large tax bill to pay over the
next couple of months.</p>
<p>I think that many people will be in the same boat this
year. Many of us have aren't earning what we were this time
last year and the target is far larger this year.</p>
<p>In fact, when I first saw that target I thought that
it was unattainable. There was <i>no way</i> we'd raise
that money. But now I think I was wrong. We can do it. If
only 2,000 Perl users could each spare $100 then we'd be
way over target. There must be 2,000 of us with a spare
$100... or 4,000 with a spare $50.</p>
<p>In fact it doesn't need to be even that hard. Let's
get as much as we can from our employers. Every company
that uses Perl saves money. It's time for them to say
"thank you" for that. It would only take 35 companies to
make a donation of $5,000 each to meet the target. Or 70
companies making donations of $2,500.</p>
<p>One thing is for sure. We'll need a <i>much</i> larger
number of sponsors that we had last year. But I certainly
don't think that it'll be impossible to reach that number.
There are huge numbers of companies out there using Perl.
It's just a case of making sure that the right people know
that the fund-raising is happening. The CFOs of your
companies don't read <i>use Perl;</i> or <i>Slashdot</i>
so it's up to us to make sure that they get the information. I've passed the details up the management 
chain at Acxiom and I intend to chase it up to ensure I 
get a decision. Why don't you do the same?</p></p>

<h2>everybody already did</h2>

I sent mail to higher ups here, and when I pushed the issue it turned out that <a href="/user/acme" title="perl.org">acme</a perl.org> and pierre had as well.  Fingers crossed we may get something for our trouble.
