<p><p>I generally avoid Usenet. The signal to noise ratio has dropped so much that's is almost impossible to find anything of value. However, since I've been out of work I've found myself drawn back to it more and more. I do try to impose three rules on myself:</p>
<ol>
<li>Stay out of alt.*</li>
<li>Don't get in flame wars</li>
<li>Ignore Godzilla</li>
</ol>

<p>Unfortunately I find myself breaking at least the first and third in <a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?hl=en&threadm=pan.2002.04.15.07.43.05.132813.29061%40dave.org.uk&rnum=1&prev=/groups%3Fq%3Dnms%2Bcgi%26hl%3Den%26scoring%3Dd%26selm%3Dpan.2002.04.15.07.43.05.132813.29061%2540dave.org.uk%26rnum%3D1">this</a> little debate. I just can't sit back and watch Godzilla attack <a href="http://nms-cgi.sourceforge.net">nms</a> without defending it.</p>
<p>The sad thing is, she <i>does</i> seem to have found some issues with running the guestbook on some unspecified Win32 platform. We'd love to address her concerns, but getting any kind of reasonable bug report out her is impossible.</p></p>

<p>Godzilla is not a woman.</p>

<p>Ooh. I didn't know that. "It" always claims to be woman and there are photos of a woman on "its" website that is supposed to be her. If you have evidence to the contrary, I'd love to see it.</p>

<p>No evidence per se but I had the same reaction the first time I noticed Abigail. This person is male, known to most of it's victims and is trying to make a point in this little backwater. Considering how few women there are around these parts you have to ask yourself why one would choose to troll clpm for kicks...and for so long. No, it's a man, baby! Yeah!<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) You also have to consider that the gender has played a very large role in its trolling success and what that means in the bigger picture. Someone is having fun in this community with their unenlightened sense of self, ego and gender issues. I'm certain this person is a man.</p>

<p>If it is a hoax, it's a very elaborate one. Have you seen "its" web site?</p>
<p> <a href="http://la.znet.com/user/callgirl/" title="znet.com">http://la.znet.com/user/callgirl/</a znet.com> </p>
<p>There's an awful lot of stuff there.</p>
<p>IMO, the jury is still out. I'll jsut resort to using "it"<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<p>Well, or that you guys are easily duped. I'll start putting a picture of my male St. Bernard on my personal web page and see how many of you literalist fskheads believe it<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) How do guys 'get' Monty Python jokes anyway? "It" is a man, really<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) </p>

You know, Godzilla once bit my sister.</p>

<h2>Ignore</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/djberg96/">djberg96</a> on 2002-04-15T15:03:09</h3>
I learned to ignore Godzilla long ago.  He/she/it usually posts nothing of value whatsoever.  Mostly, it's just strange ramblings.
<p>
Wait a minute - maybe Matt Wright *is* Godzilla!</p>

<p>Well that's certainly true. But if "it" is posting "information" saying that nms is worthless in a newsgroup where people might not know that she should be ignored, then I feel I have to post a correction.</p>
