<p>Every year the <a href="http://www.bcs.org.uk/">British Computer Society</a> holds a programming competition[1] and this year they've been persuaded to include Perl on the list of allowed languages. I know this, as I've been asked to be a judge.<br/><br/>The web page says that this is the 20th year of the competition. This means that I took part in the first one in 1985. I remember it distinctly as it was the same day as Live Aid.<br/><br/>[1] It's a nasty frames-based web site, so I can't give a link to the relevant pages, but it's under "awards and events".</p>

<h2>There is no mention of perl on the page.</h2>

I also note that it seems very windows oriented ( previous competitions have required you to build a<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.dll ), and 2 of the languages it requires are Microsoft windows only ones.
<p>
And no mention of perl..

I know. The letter I have states that Perl will be supported "on a trial basis". It's a bit difficult to see how that will work if Perl isn't listed as an option. I'll email them and find out what's going on. It may be that they were just waiting for responses from the Perl judges before adding it to the list.<br>

<p>
Sounds like you to find out about Mozilla's "This Frame" item on the context menu--if you then select "View Frame Info" you can access the URL of the frame there. The "This Frame" menu also lets you open the frame in a new window or tab, or show only the selected frame.</p><p>
The page that deals with the competition is at <a href="http://www1.bcs.org.uk/homepages/932/" title="bcs.org.uk">http://www1.bcs.org.uk/homepages/932/</a bcs.org.uk>.</p>

Thanks, but I use Mozilla all the time and I'm well aware of its frame handling faciities.<br> <br>I didn't show the URL that you've given as that page is only one part of the Programming Competition site. There are a number of other pages with more information about it and the menu that lists them is in another frame. Your link only gives a small part of the big picture and no way to access the rest of it.<br> <br>Which is why I described it as a "nasty frames-based web site".
