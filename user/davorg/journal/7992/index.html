<p><p>One of the things that always bugged me about the list of Perl Mongers groups was that <a href="http://norwich.pm.org/">Norwich.pm</a> was listed as being in "Great Britain" whereas the rest of the British groups were listed under "United Kingdom". Now whilst there is a difference betweem GB and the UK[1] and Norwich <i>is</i> in Great Britain - I've always thought it made more sense to list them all together.</p>

<p>So last night I moved Norwich. Fear my awesome geographical reclassification powers :)</p>

<p>Then this morning I got email from someone who assumed that I don't know British geography and explaining the relationship between the UK and GB and suggesting that I make exactly the change that I'd just made.</p>

<p>[1] The UK's full name is "The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland"</p></p>

<p>Please don't move me!  I can't speak the language!  (You should have seen me the other day trying to find and install Acme::Licence<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...)</p>

<p>Thanks for clearing up the UK/GB thing for me.  I have honestly never had it clearly explained.  Hazards of being an ignorant Yankee.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

For real confusion, consider that the official ISO two-letter code for "The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland" (note: not "Island" as davorg typoed) is GB, but people ignored that for Internet host names and used UK instead.

<h2>CPAN had a similar problem</h2>

<p>I forget how I had classified them a while back but, as I recall, I had listed the mirrors as people submitted them, e.g. England, Ireland, etc....until someone got fussy about it so that now they are listed under the UK with the exception of Ireland.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) The <a href="http://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabulary/tgn/index.html" title="getty.edu">Getty geographic thesaurus</a getty.edu> is very handy for such information<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>



<h2>A word to Americans</h2>

Don't suggest that it should be renamed the Formerly Great Britain.  They don't like that.  Nor do they appreciate you pointing out the dislocation between reality and the "United" part of UK<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...<p>

<p>Of course I'd be far too polite to comment on the idiocy of calling a country "New" when people have been living there since the 15th century<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>
