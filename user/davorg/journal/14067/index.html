Check <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/insaneart/" title="cpan.org">insaneart</a cpan.org> in a few hours (whenever pause and cpan and search.cpan sync).<br> <br>Or see the upload messages: <a href="http://nntp.x.perl.org/group/perl.cpan.testers/98099" title="perl.org">here</a perl.org> and <a href="http://nntp.x.perl.org/group/perl.cpan.testers/98097" title="perl.org">here</a perl.org>.<br> <br>This is getting ridiculous.

Someone told me that Randal's new book is instructing people to upload their "homework" from the book to CPAN.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-/<br> <br>

<p>Yep. That seems to be true. The "homework" for chapter 15 says:</p>

<blockquote><div> <i>Write a module to solve the halting problem. Release the code to CPAN. Be sure to include the tests. (Hint: how long will the tests take to run on modern hardware?)</i> </div></blockquote>

<p>I'm sure it's a joke - but it's not a very good idea.</p>

<p>Maybe he's redefined the halting problem to mean <em>get a bunch of experienced Perl hackers to sit around, holding their heads, saying "Please, stop!"</em> </p>

I hope the book doesn't tell its readers to write a module that determines the current year, month and day.

It says to "solve the halting problem".  That's impossible.  That's the point of the exercise... you obviously can't do it!

It's obvious for someone who knows what's the halting problem and its theoretical importance. Is it obvious for the average guy who wants to learn Perl ? There are still people who try to patent perpetual movement devices.

Within the context of the book, it's painfully obvious, yes.
<p>
Go get the book.  Read it all the way up to the indicated chapter.  By then it is clearly established that the book is written with a light tone, and that this exercise is meant as a joke.
</p><p>
The only complaint I've gotten about that exercise from anybody who has actually <i>read</i> the book is from a person who has an agenda about me personally, or people easily influenced by her.
</p><p>
These personal attacks are being disguised as professional attacks.  I'm familiar with this, as it has happened in the past with another of Perl's senior members.  The best I can do is to keep trying to inject truth into the picture. {sigh}</p>

Sorry, I haven't read the book. Is it a reason to get paranoid ? I don't know, I have myself some tendency to paranoia. Are you really calling me a "senior" or do you have a real senior in mind ?

<p>If that's a reference to the people who I think it's a reference to, then it's worth pointing out that those people have put a lot of work into getting CPAN working as well as it does. Any objection they have to your exercise is probably driven by a desire to keep CPAN useful far more than by any personal feelings they may have towards you.</p>

<p>Personally, I don't think this BRUMLEVE character has read your book as his distributions follow none of your suggestions.</p>
