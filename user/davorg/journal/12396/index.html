<p><p>My house is too big. I think I need to get a smaller one.</p>

<p>My new Powerbook has built-in wireless support and I already had an Airport. The Airport is in the study which is at the back of the house on the first floor[1]. When the Powerbook is in the study then it picks up the Airport connection just fine. When it's in the kitchen (which is below the study) then the connection works fine. But when you move it into the living room at the front of the house then the connection dies.</p>

<p>So I need a smaller house so that the Airport signal covers it all. Or alternatively I guess I could think about moving the Airport closer to the centre of the house.</p>

<p>[1] That's upstairs for people in countries that don't count floors from zero :)</p></p>

<h2>Yes!</h2>

Maybe you have too much metal in your walls, so they hinder the transmission of radiowaves. Separation between floors is (as far as I have found) normally lighter than the walls - as the walls have to carry all the weight of the floors above.<p>You might get a better result by finding the structurally significant walls (the thickest and heavyest) and placing the transmitter on the 'right' side of them.</p><p>Of course you might end up needing several more transmitters -or a smaller house<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-}</p>



<h2>Antenna</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/2shortplanks/">2shortplanks</a> on 2003-05-23T10:42:01</h3>
<p>
The Airport unit itself is just a standard Orinico card inside it.  If you remove the case you can get at the external antenna slot.
</p>
<p>
I've got a omnidirectional 'lightsabre' antenna plugged into this via a pigtail adaptor.  This works fine and is the only way that the airport, which is under our stairs will strech to the end of our garden.
</p>
<p>
Maybe you should consider one of these.  About 25ukp for the pigtail adaptor and ~100ukp for the antenna - probably less these days
