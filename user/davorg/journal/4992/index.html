<p><p>Here's a tip. Don't start doing large-scale software updates on a computer a few hours before you want to use the computer to give a presentation.</p>
<p>Last night I was giving a cut-down version of my <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/os2002/view/e_sess/2360">Idiomatic Perl</a> tutorial to those lucky people at <a href="http://london.pm.org">london.pm</a>. This was going to involve me using a laptop that I hadn't used for some months. There was some pretty out of date software on there so I decided to update some of it. I was particularly interested in updated Galeon (and therefore Mozilla).</p>
<p>I fired up Red Hat's <tt>up2date</tt> program and asked it to update Galeon. It told me that it would need to update Mozilla as well. This made perfect sense so I just started the update.</p>
<p>Some time later the update "completed". I started Galeon, only to see it crash. Further investigation showed me that everything had been updated <i>except</i> the core Mozilla rpm. Now that shouldn't happen. <tt>up2date</tt> should ensure that all rpms are installed with the correct dependencies. I was left with a machine with no (decent) working browser and no time to install the correct rpms.</p>
<p>Luckily <a href="/user/acme">acme</a> stepped in to help. He copied my slides onto his iBook and I did the presentation using that.</p>
<p>The tutorial seemed to go pretty well. I only did the first hour of so. It's weird doing a presentation like that to london.pm because so many of them already know everything in the tutorial. It's really aimed at people who have done a bit of Perl, but haven't yet got to grips with all of the clever stuff like references or modules. Still, I got some good feedback and suggestions and that can only make the tutorial better when I give it in San Diego.</p>
<p>And this morning, it only took half an hour to get the correct rpm and fix my laptop.</p></p>
