<div class="span8">
<p><p>So we had a london.pm meeting last night and much fun
was had by all. Many thanks to Reading Room for giving us
a room to hold it in.</p>
<p>We started with Paul Mison giving a short talk on how
easy it is to integrate RSS data feeds into infobots. Then
Michael Stevens gave a brief introduction to his 
Mail::ListDetector module which works in conjunction with 
Mail::Audit to filter mail into the relevant mailboxes.
This was of particular interest as most of london.pm seem 
to be on too many mailing lists. Michael was then joined by 
Richard Clamp and they talked about their Pod::Coverage 
module, which parses your POD and ensures that you've 
documented all the functions in the code. The first half 
closed with Richard and Mark Fowler giving a reprise of 
their Wax::On Wax::Off talk that went down so well at 
YAPC::Europe. For those who don't know, this talk is about 
methods of teaching Perl that draw on metaphors from Kung 
Fu movies.</p>
<p>We then had a short break and waited for Simon Cozens to
arrive. He was supposed to be talking about Parrot, but
when he turned up he told me that he also had something
else to tell us about.</p>
<p>The second half opened with Simon's Parrot talk. This
certainly grabbed many people's attention and I guess it's
why why had twice as many people at the meeting than we 
usually do. After Simon, Leon Brocard gave a short talk on
how he's working on mapping the Java Virtual Machine onto
the Parrot Virtual Machine (or Parrot Virtual Computer as
we must now call it because of the abbreviation!)</p>
<p>Then Simon gave his second talk of the evening. As
editor of <a href="http://www.perl.com">perl.com</a> he'd
just received Larry's third Apocalyspe which will be 
published next week. This Apocalypse covered operators and
Simon went through as much of it as he could in 20 
minutes. There was stuff we already expected and stuff
that we certainly didn't expect ('_' is the concaternation
operator). I think my favourite is the '//' operator which is like '||' but checks definedness rather than truth. I can already see uses for '//=' instead of <tt>$x = defined $x ? $x : $y</tt>. Oh, and that reminds me, the ternay operator becomes <tt>COND ?? EXPR :: EXPR</tt>. There's loads more, but you'll be able to read it all next week. See - you should have come to the meeting.</p>
<p>And then off to Won Kei's with various Perl 5 Porters for and incredibly cheap meal and intelligent discussion about the <i>other</i> forthcoming apocalyse.</p></p>
