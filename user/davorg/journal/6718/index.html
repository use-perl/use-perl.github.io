<p><p>You know you're getting used to a new time zone when you start oversleeping. Or maybe it was just Thursday night's excess of alcohol.</p>
<p>The opening keynote on Friday was a bit dull and the speakers came in for some abuse on various IRC channels. Most people seemed quite relieved when they finished. The second keynote more than made up for it tho'. "Challenges of Open Source in Visual Effects" was really just an excuse to show lots of clips from "The Fellowship of the Ring". We even got to see the long version of the "Two Towers" trailer.</p>

<p>After that I sat in Schwern's session on Test::Builder. Test::Builder is a module that you can use to build test modules. Most of Perl's standard test modules (Test::Simple, Test::More, etc) have been rewritten to use it.</p>

<p>Next, I went to Dominus' repeat of his popular YAPC presentations, "Mailing List Judo" and "Conference Presentation Judo". These were two of the most entertaining talks I saw all week.</p>

<p>After lunch I saw Matt Sergeant talk about SpamAssassin and DJ Adams talk about Jabber. After these I went off to find a network connection to find out who had won Big Brother, but the connectivity had been dismantled. In the end I found acme who still had access to the wireless network.</p>

<p>As Elian has pointed out, the questions at the Town Hall meeting were (in the main) predictable, but there were still some interesting questions raised.</p>

<p>And suddenly it was over or another year. To prevent ourselves fro feeling at a loose end we decamped to the bar from where we made a plan to eat Mexican food, see the new Austin Powers film and (later) return to the hotel to drink the beer that was left over from gnat's party. This plan was then executed almost to perfection by a large group of Perl hackers.</p>

<p>Many thanks to everyone who organised the conference - particularly to gnat for arranging such a great program of talks and to Vee for looking after the speakers so well (as always).</p></p>
