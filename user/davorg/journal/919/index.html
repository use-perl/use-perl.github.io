<p><p>Pudge is wrong of course.</p>
<p>It isn't "only in America" that people don't see the
need for the attacks on Afganisatan[1]. All over the world
there are sane people who are disgusted by what they are 
seeing on their TV sets. We're are watching our so-called leaders trying to justify bombing an already devastated country back into the middle ages. It's difficult to see it as anything other than the overreaction of a bully who got tripped up in the playground.</p>
<p>If bombing terrorists is such a good idea, then why have we never fired cruise missiles at Belfast? Is it because <i>those</i> terrorists are white and (supposedly) Christian.</p>
<p>6000 innocent people died in the USA. How many have died in Afganistan in the last 48 hours? That's a figure that I'm finding hard to track down in from any western news source.</p>
