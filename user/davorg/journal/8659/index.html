<p><p>Long time readers may recall that I was <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/davorg/journal/6662">waxing lyrical</a> about Cafepress's customer service back in July. I now wish to withdraw that statement.</p>
<p>Here's a recap of the story.</p>
<p>I set up a <a href="http://www.cafeshops.com/nms">Cafepress store</a> to sell <a href="http://nms-cgi.sf.net/">nms</a> goodies. I ordered some myself and arranged for them to be delivered to me at OSCON in San Diego (as their postage costs to the UK are prohibitive). In the middle of the OSCON week it became obvious that they weren't going to deliver the goods on time so I contacted them to find out what they would do about it. They said they would deliver the goods to me in the UK at no extra cost to me. This was the point at which I was saying what fine people they all were.</p>
<p>Soon after I returned from OSCON (on July 29th actually), I got an email from them saying that my order had been dispatched and I sat back and waited for it to arrive.</p>
<p>I'm still waiting three months later.</p>
<p>I contacted them after three weeks and they told me that it could well take four weeks to deliver international orders, so I waited a while longer.</p>
<p>I contacted them six weeks after the package had been dispatched asking them if they could tell me where my order was. They replied that they had no way of tracking international deliveries and said that I'd have to track it down myself.</p>
<p>I waited a couple more weeks and sent them a very angry email asking what was going on and explaining that I thought it was their responsibility to track down the order. I also asked them to confirm the address that they sent it to. They didn't reply.</p>
<p>To be honest, at that point it slipped from my mind and I was only reminded of it again when they send me an email about changing the terms and conditions for Cafepress shops. I've just sent them another email asking them to tell me where they sent the order to.</p>
<p>I'll let you know if they reply.</p></p>

your goodies are probably basking in the warm San Diego weather<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

<p>My feelings exactly. But it would be nice if they replied to me to confirm this.</p>
