<div class="span8">
<p><p>Like, I guess, a large number of <a href="http://perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=134415">people</a>, my New Years Resolution was to lose weight and get fit. Actually, that's been my News Years Resolution for as long as I remember.</p>

<p>But this year is different (yeah, right!) Why? Because this September I shall be 40[1]. Now I'm not really one for age-angst, but it seems like a convenient psychological target to set myself - "by your 40th birthday you'll be slim and fit otherwise you're doomed to be a fat bastard forever".</p>

<p>I couple of years ago I found <a href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/www/hackdiet.html">The Hackers Diet</a>. The author John Walker has a typical hacker's mindset and his approach to losing weight (seeing it as a problem to be hacked at) really appealed to me. He'd also developed a load of really nifty spreadsheets to help you keep track of your achievements (he calls this "the Eat Watch"). So I went back to his site last week to refresh my knowledge of his methods and download the spreadsheets.  I was really happy to see that together with the spreadsheets, you can now get a Palm version of <a href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/palm/">the Eat Watch</a>.</p>

<p>So now I carry my Eat Watch with me anywhere. I may not be losing weight at quite the rate I want, but I know that over the last week I've been eating an average of 96 calories too many each day. Makes it sound so much easier when you can qunatify it like that :)</p>

<p>So when you fail to recognise me at in San Diego this July because I've lost so much weight, I'll have the Eat Watch to thank for my anonymity.</p>

<p>[1] By the way, if you're in London on September 7th you're all invited to a huge party at my house.</p></p>

<p>How funny that we share the same birthday. What is the world coming to when a bran muffin has more calories than an apple filled donut?! Just eat less fast and pre-prepared food and walk an hour a day. Beer is a food group but...<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) jjohn rides his bicycle and the last time I saw him he looked terrific. </p>

I'll second the less pre-prepared food.  Learning to cook helps; you're less inclined to eat a McDonald's "hamburger" if you know you can make a real one.  My digestive system is much kinder to you, too.
<p>
As for the walking...it's probably a good idea, but I can't second it.  I don't do it (yet).</p>

Mine's the 8th.  Can I still join your secret club?
