<p><p>I'm not moving!</p>

<p>Finally back in London after what seems like an absolute
age but was, in fact, only two weeks. I got very little
work done during the holiday (I guess that's how it's
supposed to be) but on the train back from Edinburgh I
finally managed to finish the article on Tie:::StdHash
that I'd been promising Simon Cozens for months.</p>

<p>The imminent publication of the article meant that I
had to release to CPAN the three modules that I use as 
examples - Tie::Hash::FixedKeys, Tie::Hash::Regex and
Tie::Hash::Cannabinol. Unfortunately I rather rushed this
release last night (had to get it done in time to watch 
<i>The Sopranos</i>!) and as a result the <tt>test.pl</tt>
scripts are all wrong. In one case it was a test script
from an experimental version of the module and it just 
doesn't work at all. Of course this was all spotted within
seconds of the upload by Schwern and I woke up this morning
to an email from him pointing out my errors. I'll fix them
tonight :(</p>

<p>Whilst we were on holiday we went to my brother's
wedding in Gretna Green (they weren't eloping they just
thought it would be fun). Whilst we were there my mother
mentioned in passing that she'd been looking at my web site.
Now I don't think there's anything there that I don't want
her to see, but I'd never before considered the possibility
that my family would be looking at it. I'll think a bit more
before putting new pages up in future.</p>

<p>dha is coming to London over the weekend.
We're having an emergency london.pm meeting to see him on
Friday. Unfortunately that's my birthday and having spent
last Sept 7th with the mongers, Gill has arranged dinner
at a nice restaurant with some (non-Perlish) friends. 
hopefully I'll catch up with him later in the week.</p></p>
