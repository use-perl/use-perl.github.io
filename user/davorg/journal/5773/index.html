<p><p>What's worse than getting spam? Getting spam that's meant for someone else.</p>
<p>When I started this job, I was asked what username I wanted on the system. I was told that 'dave' was free, but it had been used before. I decided to go for it anyway.</p>
<p>The first time I connected to the company POP server to download mail, there were 55 messages waiting for me. I'm used to getting a couple of "welcome" messages the first time I log on to a mail server, but this was all external stuff. None of it was <i>actually</i> spam as it seems the the previous owner of this email address was a big fan of "industry insider" mailing lists and was subscribed to all the ones he could find.</p>
<p>So now, each day I get a torrent of information that I have no interest in. The first task of the day is to unsubscribe from any new lists that have turned up during the night.</p>
<p>This isn't an onerous task. As they all seem to be legit mailing lists, they are happy to accept unsubscribe requests. What I am surprised by, however, is the number of them that allow you to unsubscribe simply by typing your email address into a web form. In most cases there is no confirmation email or password verification needed.</p>
<p>So, maybe the previous 'dave' didn't really love being on mailing lists. Perhaps he was subscribed to them by people who didn't like him :)</p></p>

maybe he set you up, thinking: <i>'If there's ever another 'dave' that follows me, I'll show him!'</i>
<p>
Maybe it's just the paranoia in me, tho<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)
