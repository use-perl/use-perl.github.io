<p><p>A couple of weeks ago I went for an interview for a permanent job. Seems that it all went ok as I've been asked back for a second interview.</p>
<p>As a contractor, I'm only really used to having one interview. They find out if you've got the technical skills that they need and if so (and your rate is right) you get the job.</p>
<p>This second interview sounds like it's all going to be a good deal more "fluffy". I've already persuaded the techies that I can do the job, but now I need to talk to management types and persuade them that I'll fit in with the company.</p>
<p>It'll be a challenge, but interesting. I'm due there at 3pm this afternoon.</p>
<p>Wish me luck.</p></p>

<tt>...and remember to at least smile at their jokes<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br> <br>My nightmare about those sorts of interviews is the<br>following:<br> <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Potential PHB demonstrates some missunderstanding<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; of a technology/protocol/standard/RFC/whatever<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; which is directly relevant to the project. Their<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; missunderstanding isn't something that would at<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; all affect your ability to get the project done.<br> <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; This is an interview situation with a few folks<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; in the room.<br> <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Do you play "nice" and not correct the PHB who<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; might take offense at being corrected in front<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; of others? You don't yet know him well, and he<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; could be readily offended by that sort of thing.<br> <br>&nbsp; &nbsp;<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...or do you correct him to CYA just in case his<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; "slip" was a test?<br> <br>Fortunately, it's never happened to me<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br> <br>-matt<br> </tt>

Hope it went well for you; I've got a similar thing on Tuesday. It'll be nice to be employed again -- finally be able to afford some of the nice books out at the moment =)
