<p><p>Last night I saw the film <a href="http://www.partypeoplemovie.com/">24 Hour Party People</a>. It's the story of <a href="http://listen.to/factory">Factory Records</a>, a Manchester based record label who between 1978 and 1992 released some incredibly influencial records.</p>
<p>Largely the film concentrated on Tony Wilson (the founder of Factory) and two of their biggest bands, <i>Joy Division</i> (who became <i>New Order</i> in 1980 following the suidide of their lead singer Ian Curtis) and <i>The Happy Mondays</i>. Other bands like <i>A Certain Ratio</i> and <i>Durutti Column</i> only got the most cursory of mentions and the film completely ignored the fact that Factory discovered other great bands like <i>Orchestral Manoeuvres In The Dark</i> and <i>James</i>.</p>
<p>It was a great film tho'. It really brought back memories of those times. The first time I heard <i>Joy Division</i>'s "Atmosphere" I was completely blown away.</p>
<p>It's certainly ensured that I'll be digging out a lot of my old Factory records and they'll be on heavy rotation round here for the next few weeks.</p>
<p>If you've any interest in the Manchester music scene of the 1980s then you need to see this film.</p></p>

<i>If you've any interest in the Manchester music scene of the 1980s then you need to see this film.</i> <br> <br>Mate, this is <b>totally</b> my cup of tea.  Thanks for mentioning it as I hadn't heard anything about it.  Nice one.



<h2>Cool music</h2>

I remember listening to my roommate's <i>Joy Division</i> album back in college.  It was pretty good, as I recall.  I still have New Order's <i>Substance</i>.  I think I've outgrown it, though.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:(
<p>
Can't say I was ever a big fan of the name "Joy Division", given its origin.</p>

New Order's <i>Substance</i> is a classic.  Joy Division's <i>Substance</i> is also one of my all time faves.

<h2>Joy Division &amp;amp; New Order</h2>

It will be interesting to see if the Joy Division/New Order portions of this film differ from those in 'The New Order Story'.
