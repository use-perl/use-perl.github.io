<div class="span8">
<p><p>I've just received in the post the second edition of
Liz Castro's book "Perl and CGI for the World Wide Web".
In the list of acknowledgements there's an entry "Dave
Cross, who not only pointed outthe problems but also
helped me fix them". It might be interesting to explain
my involvement with this book particularly in the light of
the debate going on here about the Perl community's
attitude to beginners.</p>
<p>This book first came to my attention via a 
<a href="http://perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=21576">review</a>
of it on Perlmonks. As you'll see, the review is pretty
scathing - poining out that the book doesn't use 
<tt>strict</tt>, <tt>-w</tt> or <tt>CGI.pm</tt> and also
that it has a rather cavalier attitude to security. These
criticisms are, of course, pretty common amongst the kind 
of Perl/CGI book that is aimed at absolute beginners.</p>
<p>A few days later however, someone on the london.pm list
mentioned the book again, listing similar problems with it
and pointing out that it was Amazon's top selling Perl/CGI
book. At this point I decided to investigate further. I
bought a copy of the book and read it. On the strength of
this reading, I wrote a very critical review of the book
on Amazon - advising people to avoid the book at all costs
and saying various unpleasant things about the author's
ability to write Perl.</p>
<p>I thought it would end there, but I got an email from
the author. She felt that I was very unfair to her book in
my review and was quite prepared to argue her case. She 
asked my to get back to her with specific examples of the 
problems with her book.</p>
<p>I agreed to do this and took another, altogether much
closer, look at the book. I found that whilst I had pages
and pages of technical suggestions, the actual writing was
very good and that Castro was addressing a completely
different audience to the one that I was used to dealing
with. I realised that rather than just criticising this
book, it would be good if we build on the success of the
book and correct the technical errors in the second 
edition.</p>
<p>As luck would have it, the second edition was in
preparation as I first exchanged emails with Castro. Once
I'd apologised for my original review (and had it removed
from Amazon) Castro was more than happy to use my
suggestions in the new edition.</p>
<p>The result of this is that there is now a beginners
Perl/CGI in the shops that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Uses <tt>/usr/bin/perl -Tw</tt> in every example</li>
<li>Uses <tt>strict</tt> and therefore predeclares all of
the variables with <tt>my</tt></li>
<li>Uses CGI.pm to parse CGI parameters instead of the
broken homegrown CGI parser in the previous edition</li>
</ul>
<p>Ok, so a lot of the Perl still isn't great, but I think
you'll see the book is a vast improvement on the first 
edition. And if it means that more beginners will be using
-w/strict/CGI.pm, then I see that as a good thing.</p></p>
