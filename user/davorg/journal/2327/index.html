<p><p>I got a response from one of the authors of <i>Core Java</i>. I'd written to them to ask why their book implied that Perl wasn't a "real language" and what constituted a "real language" to them.</p>

<p>His reply hinged on two points:</p>
<ul>
<li>It was obvious from the tone that the offending phrase was "editorial comment" and not fact. Removing colour like that from the book make it very dull.</li>
<li>He then quoted from an <a href="http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2000/06/rosler.html">interview with Larry Rosler</a> where Larry outs forward the case for Perl getting some kind of official (i.e. ANSI) standardisation.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, as suspected, there was no logical argument. Just more FUD.</p>
<p>Oh, and if anyone's interested, I'm finding Java to be <i>really</i> frustrating.</p></p>

Where?  How?  What's the most frustrating part?
<p>
The last time I looked at Java code, I was both amazed and frustrated at how much code it took to do so little.  It's like the nature language <b>demands</b> that you create a class hierarchy at least three to four levels deep to do anything slightly more trivial than Hello, World.
</p><p>
Unfortunately, I haven't read much Java code, but given the size of the java-based projects I've seen, I'd say that it's more indicative of the language than the implementor's lack of skill...</p>

<p>That's exactly it. If I wanted my code to be as verbose as that I'd write it in COBOL<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>
