<p><p>I have a hotmail account that I sometimes use in places where I don't want to expose my real email address to too many spam opportunities. I only check this address every few months.</p>
<p>I tried to check it just now, but it seems I've forgotten the password. No problem, I think, here's a handy "forgotten your password" link, I'll just click that and all will be well.</p>
<p>Bear in mind that I'm running Galeon 1.2.5 (which is Mozilla 1.0 in disguise) and you'll be as disappointed as I was when you see what that link lead to...</p>
<blockquote><i>Microsoft&reg; .NET Passport no longer supports the Web browser version you are using. Please upgrade to a current Web browser, such as Microsoft Internet Explorer version 4.0 or later, or Netscape Navigator version 4.08 or later.</i></blockquote>
<p>I thought that "no longer" was a nice touch :)</p></p>

 <p> They throw out Opera and even Netcaptor (which is IE, but with a tabbed interface).. throwing out their own browser is quite silly, I think<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:o) and anyone surfing behind junkbuster is going to have a problem anyway (because I believe they check for user agent headers, which I fake, not sure about this, tho) </p><p> However, there IS a button that you can click at the end of that browser warning message, which allows you to continue using Hotmail regardless (they warn you that they won't be responsible, heh heh heh).. </p><p> On a related note, even Yahoo mail won't let you try out their beta version with the above browsers.. since I use Yahoo quite a bit, this is going to be a pain in the near future.. Perhaps some mail telling them that ppl who use other browsers exist ?</p>

I wanted to look at Verizon's cell phone web access, and to sign up for it online, you need a Passport account.  So I won't be signing up for it, I guess.
