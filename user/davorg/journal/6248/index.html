<p><p>I mentioned that I'd finished my slides for the <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/os2002/view/e_sess/2360">Idiomatic Perl</a> tutorial. Over the weekend I remembered that O'Reilly would probably like to have copies of them to print for attendees. Yesterday I emailed them to find out what I was supposed to be doing. It seems that I was supposed to get my slides to them by June 10th, but somehow I didn't get the messages. Oops.</p>
<p>So I had to have them ready last night. What I already had was an XML file and a combination of Perl and XSLT that converted it to HTML pages. To make it as easy as possible to print the slides I decided that I wanted to convert the HTML pages to one PDF file.</p>
<p>I found <a href="http://www.tdb.uu.se/user/jan/html2ps.html"><tt>html2ps</tt></a> which seemed to do a good job of creating one postscript file from the HTML. And I already had <tt>ps2pdf</tt> installed. Then I realised that it would be even more helpful if I could get two landscape slides on one portrait page. I remembered that there was a postscript utility for doing this, but it took me a few minutes to remember that it was called <tt>psnup</tt>.</p>
<p>There then followed a rather frustrating half hour whilst I tried to work out why <tt>psnup</tt> wasn't changing my files at all. Eventually I found the answer in the <a href="http://www.tdb.uu.se/user/jan/html2ps-FAQ.html"><tt>psnup</tt> FAQ</a> and got that stage working.</p>
<p>After that, <tt>ps2pdf</tt> worked first time and I ended up with a PDF file that I was very happy with.</p>
<p>Yes, of course I should have been using <a href="http://axpoint.axkit.org/">AxPoint</a>. But it's been an enjoyable learning experience :)</p>

<p>Oh, and apparently there are already 59 people signed up to my tutorial. If you're going to be at  <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/os2002/">OSCON</a> and your Perl could use a little workout, then please come along.</p></p>

I didn't get the message either. Wouldn't it have been an idea to remind us about this deadline? Where should I send the slides to, anyway?

<p>Well, I think it's only a big deal for the tutorials - as they need to print copies of the slides for the attendees.</p>
<p>But if you have'nt had any of those messages then you might not have registered as a speaker yet. Better get in touch with Vee pronto &nbsp;:)</p>

<h2>attendee count?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/geoff/">geoff</a> on 2002-07-10T11:49:32</h3>
nifty figure to have already, the number of people signed up for your tutorial.  I wonder if we can all get that (without bugging Vee too much &nbsp;:)

<p>I just asked her nicely in an email. Let's not all do it at once tho' - she's probably a bit busy right now &nbsp;:)</p>

She's insanely busy with last-minute changes to the OSCON schedule and the Mac OS Con registration about to start.  Send me mail and I'll tell you how many are in your tutorial.<p>
