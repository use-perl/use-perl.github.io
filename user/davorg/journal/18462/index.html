<p>I wrote a <a href="http://dave.org.uk/reviews/medic.html">review</a> of Peter Scott's book <i>Perl Medic</i>. Executive summary - it's very good, buy it.</p>

Thanks for the informative review, good sir - it reinforced my impression-gleaned-elsewhere that <a href="http://www.perlmedic.com/" title="perlmedic.com">Perl Medic</a perlmedic.com> belongs in my library (and brain).
</p>
That 'elsewhere' also mentioned <a href="http://www.perldebugged.com/" title="perldebugged.com">Perl Debugged</a perldebugged.com> as a somewhat similar/related good book to have. &nbsp; Your thoughts? &nbsp; Possibilities of your reviewing it in the foreseeable future?<br>
 &nbsp; cheers,<br>

Yep, <i>Perl Debugged</i> is also a very good book. It's starting to look like Peter Scott's name should be seen as an indicator of a book that is well worth reading.<br> <br>It's a real shame that <i>Perl Debugged</i> seemed to go largely unnoticed when it was published. I think that's at least partly to do with the (mistaken) idea that only O'Reilly publish decent Perl books (of course I'm a bit biased!)<br> <br>I'm unlikely to get round to reviewing it tho' as I have so many recent(ish) books in my "books for review" pile that I won't ever get round to any older stuff.

Indeed, as much as I pushed and pushed and pushed Perl Debugged, noone seemed to take any notice of it and it's now out of print so there seems little point in writing a review of it.

I didn't know it had gone out of print. That's terrible news. Amazon still have <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0201700549" title="amazon.com">a few copies</a amazon.com> so if you want one, you'd better buy it quickly.

Well, I suggested to Peter that he encourage AW to make it available as a PDF online much like they have done with similar TeX books that they no longer have in print. Hopefully, they'll do it since it's an equally terrific book that few noticed a couple of years ago but now that PM is finally catching on, it's certain to generate interest in PD.

<p>Yes, I thought it was rather nice too.</p>

<p>One possible reason why it may have been overlooked - I've come across a few people who confused it with the similarly titled but (IMHO) really rather bad "Debugging Perl" by Martin Brown (basically just a rehash of Perl's POD).</p>

<p>I didn't realise Perl Debugged was out of print.  Sad.</p>

<p>/me admits to doing that.</p>
<p>It's the only Martin Brown book I own<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:(</p>

You can read my review of Perl Debugged <a href="http://birmingham.pm.org/docs/reviews/debugged.html" title="pm.org">here</a pm.org>. I would highly recommend it as a worthwhile companion to Perl Medic.
