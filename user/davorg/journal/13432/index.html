<p><p>It's been about six weeks since I got the Powerbook, so I think I've given it a good chance, but I have to confess it's not growing on me.</p>
<p>Oh, I <i>lurve</i> the form-factor. I'd be very happy if I could get a "real" laptop of that size and shape. It's the OS that I can't get on with. I can't put my finger on it, but I just can't feel at home with it. Other people seem to make the switch from Linux to OS X very easily but I still feel much happier when I get back to Linux.</p>
<p>But, on the other hand, my wife likes it. So it looks like it will become her main computer and I'll get back the Samsung laptop that she's been using for the last couple of years. So everyone is happy.</p>
<p>Oh, and the Powerbook has the usual Apple hardware glitches that I've read about in other journals. The power lead has broken and I'm going to have to get another one. <i>At a cost of ÃâÃÂ£65!</i></p></p>

<p>It makes me very happy to see this. I use FreeBSD, not because I'm a super Unix god, but I really like it, and my Powerbook drives me crazy. And not just because of the single-button trackpad, though that certainly helps.</p>

<p>I always feel really guilty whenever I hear that one or another Real Programmer uses OS X, because I think, "If he's using it, what kind of snob am I to pretend that I need something else?" So I like seeing that others feel the same way.</p>

<p>And I leave the Powerbook at home for the wife to use, and schlep my FreeBSD-running ThinkPad back and forth all the time.</p><p>
