<p><p>I've been running (for certain values of "running")
london.pm for over three years. It's been a lot of fun and
some of it even made some kind of sense.</p>
<p>But I've realised that I need to reorder my priorities
if I want to complete some of the <i>other</i> projects
that are going on. I've therefore decided that it's time
for someone else to herd the cats. I told the group a 
couple of days ago that they'll need to find a new leader
by the end of the year.</p>
<p>It's almost frightening to see what london.pm has
become in such a small time. At the first meeting, a 
dozen people turned up. We just wanted to socialise with
other geeks. Now, we have over two hundred people on the
mailing list and regularly get over thirty people at
meetings. We've organised a conference, sponsored a 
camel and (most importantly) we've contributed a great
deal to Perl itself. As an example of that last point, there
was at least one day at this year's TPC where it was 
possible to sit in talks given by london.pm members all
day.</p>
<p>You've not heard the last of me tho'. Most of my other
projects are somehow related to the Perl world. I'll still
be around.</p></p>
