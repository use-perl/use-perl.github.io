<div class="span8">
<p><p>One of the problems with considering a return to permanent employment after seven years as a freelancer is the amount of holiday time you get (or rather, the <i>lack</i> of holiday time you get).</p>
<p>For the last seven year I've been taking holidays whenever I want. I estimate that I've had about six weeks off a year on average. I haven't really had to think about it. I just take the time off and the client doesn't pay me for those days.</p>
<p>Now I have to consider dealing with the UK standard holiday entitlement of four weeks[1]. I've already got five weeks planned for the second half of this year, so it seems like a lot of that will need to be curtailed :(</p>

<p>[1] I realise, of course, that this seems like heaven to people in other parts of the world.</p></p>

<h2>four days?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/robin/">robin</a> on 2002-06-09T15:14:09</h3>
<i>five weeks</i> is more usual, in my experience.

<p>Oops. I meant for <i>weeks</i>. I've corrected it now.</p>

<h3><a href="/user/gav/">gav</a> on 2002-06-09T18:16:28</h3>
It's pretty hard when you move from the uk to the us. I get 0.83 days off a month (10 a year) in the first year, building to 15 next year.
<p>
This seems quite depressing when people get 20-25 off back home. Though I can always take time off unpaid I guess.
</p><p>
This is kinda a moot point because I've only taken 1 day off in the 8 months I have been here and that was the 26th of Dec as it isn't a holiday here<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
</p><p>

<h2>Only 10 days!!!!</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/htoug/">htoug</a> on 2002-06-11T08:01:35</h3>
.. and we have felt that 6 weeks was too little and have gotten an ekstra week this year...<br>
But then we do deserve it with our harsh schedule of 34 hours/week<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)<p>
Vacancies? Yes, we do have some, but it's in Denmark.</p>

<h2>unpaid leave</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/drhyde/">drhyde</a> on 2002-06-10T15:45:45</h3>
so take some unpaid leave on top of your paid leave.

<h2>Re:unpaid leave</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/davorg/">davorg</a> on 2002-06-10T16:27:44</h3>
<p>It's a possibility. But given that I'm already taking a 50% cut in income to go permie, I'm not sure I can afford to do that<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

I work in the City (London) and I went Permie late last year after 7 years of contracting. While the money decrease is a pain, IR35 was such a nightmare that I'm happier out of it. Maybe I'm just lucky but I have 30 days annual leave<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-) But I don't think that's unusual in the financial sector.
Whereas contractors have had to take pay cuts of between 10-20% in a lot of the bigger banks. The way I feel at the moment is that I just got out in time.

<h2>Heh, Four weeks.</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ct/">ct</a> on 2002-06-11T15:13:33</h3>
My current job is the first I've ever had where I got more than two. I have three. I'm treating it like I've gotten a precious commodity, don't want to spend it rashly.<p>

My father has six weeks, but he's worked for the same company for 35 years to get it.</p><p>

A friend of mine decided a while ago that he needed four weeks minimum. He negotiated with his employer when he was hired for a higher salary than he needed, then said, "I'll make you a deal. I'll trade cash for vacation." And traded a few thousand dollars a year for four weeks. He also saves money out of each check specifically into a savings account until he has two weeks pay. He then takes two three week vacations a year. Three weeks in hawaii in the beginning of the year, three in a mountain cabin in colorado in the fall.</p><p>
