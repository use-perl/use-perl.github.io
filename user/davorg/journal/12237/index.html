<p><p>I had a rather strange experience this morning. There's been some talk of publishing <i>Data Munging with Python</i> which would contain my words but with the Perl code replaced with Python. Currently we have a Python programmer who is producing some sample chapters and this morning he sent me a draft of one of the chapters.</p>
<p>It was very weird reading my own words but seeing someone else's code in a language that I don't really understand.</p>
<p>Maybe I'll pick up a bit of Python from this project and, hey, if I can say I'm co-author on a book about Python then that can't hurt the CV :)</p></p>

<h2>Data munging with ...</h2>

C, please!  No, really.  I'd find that dead useful.

<p>(Caveat - I have not read Dave's book, so I don't know exactly what is in it.) "core" C (c.f. "core" perl) would be hard, as I think that to do it properly you'd have to re-implement Perl's data structures in C. However, I don't know if any freely available C libraries give you enough to avoid that step, and hence make writing data munging with <i>foo</i>lib viable.</p>
<p>However, rather than pure "Data munging with Python" what I'd really like to see is "Data munging with Perl/Python/Ruby/TCL" (say) where there are equivalent code examples in all 4 (or 3? too many?) languages, so that you can directly see how they map to each other. For that matter, "Data munging in Perl6" could also be quite informative.</p>

<p>Amen!</p>
<p>I've been waiting for a while to see a book
that intelligently presents (and possibly
compares) the same technique in several
languages, and since text munging is such a
common task, this would be a good example.</p>
<p>It would also, incidentally, highlight how
optimized Perl is for the task, compared to
other languages.</p>

<h2>How would this work ?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/tinman/">tinman</a> on 2003-05-16T12:01:46</h3>
<p>There are equivalent command structures in both languages, but would just translating code segments cut it, really ? Some of the most useful things I learnt from the book are specific to Perl.. (fiddling with the record separator variable, for example)
</p><p>Then again, (this is because I dont know any better<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) ), does Python have an equivalent to Parse::RecDescent ? (there is one chapter worth of material on that module alone)</p>

<blockquote><div>does Python have an equivalent to Parse::RecDescent ?</div></blockquote>
<p>Not as such.  There are several parser
building libraries available, but none of them
have the breadth and scope of Parse::RecDescent.</p>
<p>This is, I think, because the Python community
doesn't have a specifically-retained Mad Scientist.
The language can definitely natively support a Parse::RecDescent-type module (as opposed to C, like Nicholas points out), though.</p>

Here's an awful thought -- the same person could convert Parse::RecDescent to Python.  Tell them it's extra credit.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:D

<h2>Python is a decent language</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/dlc/">dlc</a> on 2003-05-16T13:06:14</h3>
<p>You could do a lot worse than pick up some
Python -- it's a nice language, with a lot going
for it.  And, for as much as we in Perl community
like to complain about it, it's a lot more similar
to Perl than many other languages that we don't
complain about (it's just an easier target that
many other languages).</p>



<h2>Text Processing in Python</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/dlc/">dlc</a> on 2003-05-28T14:54:26</h3>
<p>I meant to mention this earlier.  David Mertz is writing a similar book, called <a href="http://gnosis.cx/TPiP/" title="gnosis.cx">Text Processing In Python</a gnosis.cx>, which looks like it will be pretty good.</p>
<p>&lt;heckle&gt;The full contents of the book are available on his site.&lt;/heckle&gt;</p>
