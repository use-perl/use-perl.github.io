<div class="span8">
<p><p>Xtians <i>do</i> interpret the commandment as "Thou
shall not commit murder" instead of "Thou shall not kill".
I've seen this argument from them many times. Of course,
they're a little reticent to explain exactly how they know
when a killing isn't murder as it gives them a convenient
get-out clause when they go after someone they don't
like.</p>
<p>But let's not let the facts stand in the way of a good 
joke and contine to enjoy <a href="http://www.theonion.com/onion3734/god_clarifies_dont_kill.html"><i>God Angrily Clarifies "Don't
Kill" Rule</i></a>.</p>
<p>Have to say that I also agree with pudge that using 
these journals for political debate isn't really making 
the best use of them and I think we should stop.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this self-imposed censorship, means that
I really shouldn't point out to perlguy that he 
fundamentally misunderstands the British. The kind of
Brits that object to the bombings are exactly the same
group who would have a party if Buckingham Palace was
destroyed - particularly if it was full of the Windsor
parasites at the time.</p>

Well, I can't say I'd be dancing in the streets, there's some really nice, irreplaceable art and stuff in there (along with huge piles of tat). But I wouldn't be calling for massive retaliatory strikes. The tabloids would be though.



<h2>killing</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/pudge/">pudge</a> on 2001-10-15T12:54:25</h3>
I don't see how this problem is a "Christian" thing.  Almost everyone I know draws distinctions between killing and murder.  The law certainly does, at least in our country, and in most countries I know of.  *shrug*

<p>You're right (again!) of course, but the point
is that most countries have well defined legal
systems that decide whether a particular incident
is murder or not. I don't see anything similar
in the Bible.</p>
<p>Or do you mean that when the Bible says
"murder", it means "any action that would be
considered murder under the legal code of the
country in which you perpetrate said act". Seems
strange to me that God would delegate such
important decisions to "local" government.
Particularly in countries like the US where
there's no official link between Church and
State.</p>

Well, the Bible -- the New Testament, anyway -- has no well-defined legal system at all.  It does, however, have different words with more-or-less clear meanings.  See Matthew 5:21-22, where Christ quotes the Commandment (but in Greek).  The word used there is phonos, which has a history in contemporary literature (Homer, Diodorus, Simonedes, Aelius Aristedes).  It sometimes means "killing with anger as a cause" or "bloody deeds", but the emphasis is always on the fact that this kind of killing was morally wrong.
<br>
<br>This is to be contrasted with the much more common word, apokteino (see, e.g., Matt. 10:28), which is used to describe generally depriving someone of life.  I think if it were meant that generally depriving someone of life were always wrong, they would not draw a distinction.  That's the general consensus, anyway.
<br>
<br>I did not mean to say at all that God delegates moral authority to the government (although that is another whole discussion, and according to the NT, God does delegate authority in many cases to the government), but only that you seemed to be presenting the notion of a distinction between "kill" and "murder" as a Christian invention or peculiarity, and while it may or may not be descended from Judeo-Christian ethics, it is a common view amongst many peoples.

I think your overlooking the biggest benefit of having the queen. In the event of The Smiling Git deciding to enter into nuclear war or someother act that would destroy our country because someone called his wife ugly or some other issue he took offence at the Queen has the power to step in and revoke his posistion. She is our safeguard against a dictatorship.
