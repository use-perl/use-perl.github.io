<p><p>Sometimes it's easy to forget that non-geeks don't understand all of our little customs. I think that my .sig has just confused someone on the nms support list.</p>
<p>When replying to his question, my random sig generator came up with the line "We are far too young and clever" which some of you may recognise as a line from "Come on Eileen" by Dexy's Midnight Runners.</p>
<p>It seems that he didn't recognise the quote or understand the concept of a .sig. After thanking me for helping him, his reply goes on to say.</p>
<blockquote><i>I respect your own knowledge, really Dave, being young does not mean that you are not clever and experienced, So I wish you and your colleagues every success in your careers.</i></blockquote>
<p>Which is nice. If a little misplaced :)</p></p>

<h2>Sigs</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Simon/">Simon</a> on 2004-08-03T13:56:32</h3>
<p>
I take hardly any notice of what my sig generator spits out. This led to fun when it turned up a pseudo-2001 quote "You're not Dave. Who are you?" - in reply to someone who really was called Dave. They were upset. Oops.
</p>

<p>
Although not as oops as when I was asked to talk at LL1, and I sent back a reply to a couple of computer science postgrads with the following quote:
</p>
<blockquote><div>
If computer science was a science, computer "scientists" would study what
computer systems do and draw well-reasoned conclusions from it, instead of
being rabid clueless wankers who've never even seen a real world system before,
let alone used one. These are the kind of people that brought us pascal, folks.
 - Charles J Radder, asr.

Yeah, but that was actually relevant to the discussion at hand, as I recall...
