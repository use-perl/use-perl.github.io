<p><p>Been a bad couple of months for the British Royal family. First Princess Margaret went early in February and then yesterday the Queen Mother finally gave up the ghost.</p>
<p>As expected the press has gone over the top with praise for someone who basically did nothing for the country for all of her life. She was 101 and everyone comments on how healthy she looked until very recently. Well surely you'd look pretty good too if you'd been as privileged as she was for your entire life.</p>
<p>One good thing tho'. It's been common knowledge for years that the BBC had plans for a complete change of schedule when she died. All standard programmes would be pulled and replaced with documentaries and tributes. A similar thing happened when Diana died, but the the BBC had a lot of criticism over that so they <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/queenmother/article/0,2763,563056,00.html">revise their plans</a>. Last night we had a couple of hours of special programming, but it was basically business as usual.</p>
<p>And interestingly I heard a Royal commentator being interviewed last night. He said that the UK was pretty much split on the Monarchy at the moment. One third were very pro, one third were ambivalent and one third were very anti. As a staunch republican[1] that last third seemed a little high to me, but I was very glad to hear it.</p>

<p>[1] That's, obviously, the UK meaning of "republican" :)</p></p>
