<p><a href="http://www.google.com/googleblog/2004/07/warning-we-brake-for-number-theory.html">See here</a>.<br/><br/>Google have registered a domain, <tt>$foo</tt>.com, where <tt>$foo</tt> is the first ten digit prime number made from consecutive digits of <i>e</i>. The next puzzle is at that URL.<br/><br/>Of course all that prime number computation is terribly tedious, so on #london.pm we came up with a solution that didn't involve calculating any prime numbers.<br/><br/>Can anyone work out what we did?

I solved that in twenty seconds.
<p>
I googled for it.</p>

<p>Which works for stage 2 of the problem as well.</p>
<p>Isn't google wonderful..."</p>

I must be using a different google... O:-)

Dammit, and I solved it the old fashioned way.  Figuring it out while bored at work.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)

<h2>my guess was wrong</h2>

<p>The digits of <i>e</i> go on forever and don't repeat, so I guessed that any consecutive sequence of 10 digits is found in <i>e</i>. Then just google for a list of prime numbers and find the first one in <a href="http://www.prime-numbers.org/prime-number-1000000000-1000005000.htm" title="prime-numbers.org">this list</a prime-numbers.org>. However, I didn't find that URL. Now I realize that what they really meant was to find the first 10-digit sequence in <i>e</i> (like by dragging a 10-digit window from left to right along the number) which happens to be a prime number, not the first prime number that happens to be in <i>e</i>.</p> <p>Next I'd try to find an alphabetical list of hostnames and look through the 10-digit numbers<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.com. I don't know where to find such a list, though.</p>

You went to <a href="http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/htmltest/gifcity/e.1mil" title="nasa.gov">a list of digits</a nasa.gov> and then did a URL lookup on each one until you found the one that Google registered?<p>

Of course you can just use [cpan://Math::Pari] to do the calculation for you.  I did it using factorint and looking for a ; in the complete factorization.  Who cares how much computer effort that wastes when it takes under a tenth of a second to run?</p>

Yep. That's the one. Easy innit. Now solve the puzzle you find at that URL.

<h2>Got it!</h2>

And solved the second puzzle as well.  Unfortunately, that's the end of the road for the puzzles.  Shame, as it was a great way to pass the time!

Perhaps Google plan to waste hours of their competitors' employees time with silly quizzes.  I'm currently out of work, so I waste my time with far more trivial things.
