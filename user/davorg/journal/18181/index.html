<p>The good news - a completely unexpected cheque in the post this morning. As the <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/perltt/">Badger book</a> was released in the last week of 2003 we get royalties for the last quarter of the year. And as they include all of the pre-orders, sales were pretty good for a book that was only on sale for a week :)<br/><br/>The bad news - the cheque is in USD. And dollars aren't particularly valuable right now :(<br/><br/>Oh, and in other news, there's a very positive (although not very grammatical) review of the Badger in the new issue of <a href="http://www.linux-magazine.com/issue/42"><i>Linux Magazine</a>.</p>

If I were you, I'd hold on to the check for awhile.  The dollar is climbing; it's slow, but it is steady (was 1.2503 againust the Euro on Feb. 25, now is at lowest point in months, 1.2089).  I am not being pro-America here<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... I even put money into European funds recently because I realized how good they were doing.  But the USD really does appear to be making a bit of a comeback, and with the great job news recently, and the GDP climbing pretty well, it's a decent bet to hold on to it for a couple of months.  Then again, you lose interest, if you were planning on investing it.  Whatever you do, good luck.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)
