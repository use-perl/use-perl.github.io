<p><p>So this is my last day in this contract. From Monday I'll have Copious Free Time.</p>

<p>Actually I may not. Here's a list of things that I want to get done next week.</p>

<ul>
<li>Finish writing my talks for the <a href="http://www.perlworkshop.de">German Perl Workshop</a></li>
<li>Finish an article on the <a href="http://www.tt2.org">Template Toolkit</a> that I promised to one of the UK Linux mags two months ago</li>
<li>Write an article on <a href="http://nms-cgi.sourceforge.net">nms</a> <i>without</i> being rude about Matt Wright</li>
<li>Write up a book proposal</li>
<li>Start work on a paper for TPC</li>
<li>Start work on my new <tt>Data::Distributor</tt> module idea</li>
</ul>
<p>I've probably forgotten stuff. I'll probably find I just hang out on <tt>#perl</tt> and <tt>#london.pm</tt> instead :-/</p>
<p>Oh, I guess I should add "find a job" to that list.</p>

<h2>Got CFT?</h2>

If you(*) are trying to bite the CFT bug, you could always do something useful, like learning Java(**).<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)
<p>
Actually, I'm only <i>half</i> joking (and the idea is originally gnat's).  There are preciously few people in the Perl world who grok Java, what it's doing, what it has, and where it's going.  Learning just enough Java to make sense of it all is a worthwhile endeavor.  Especially with J2EE, JavaBeans and the up-and-coming P5EE/POE/AxKit B2B efforts.
</p><p>
(But writing an article about nms without disparaging Mr. Wright is certainly a more challenging project).
</p><p>
*: you as in <i>someone with CFT</i>.
<br>
**: Java, as in <i>some language that isn't Perl</i>.  I'm wading through Scheme in fits and starts at the moment...</p>

I dunno, it wouldn't be too hard to write a good article that doesn't slam Matt too hard.  It just takes effort and care.  Something along the lines of:<br/><br/><blockquote><div>Many web sites use scripts from Matt's Scripts Archive, run by Matt Wright.  These are programs written when Matt was much younger and still learning Perl, and he hasn't kept them updated over the years, and they are filled with numerous bugs and security flaws.  Until now, however, there's been a lack of alternatives, and those alternatives in existence weren't well-known, well-documented, or well-supported.</div></blockquote><br/><br/>If he thinks that's rude, well, he can stuff it.  (Now, *that's* rude.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)
