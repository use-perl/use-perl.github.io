<div class="span8">
<p><p>Last year my <a href="http://www.powerhost.co.uk/">web hosts</a> were taken over. Immediately service quality fell so I started looking for alternatives. I found one that was cheaper and better (root access rather than a shared box) and have been in the process of moving my domains.</p>
<p>Recently the old hosts introduced a new charge. As well as the fixed amount I've paid for the year, they want to charge me ÃÂ£20 for each domain I host with them. This charge comes due on the anniversary of the registration of the domain. I know it's only ÃÂ£20, but this is a matter of principle :) I've been using the arrival of these invoices as a timetable of when to move the domains.</p>
<p>Except it seems that I missed one. One of the domains vanished in the middle of last week as the registration had lapsed. I found the invoice for ÃÂ£20 which I had somehow missed a few weeks ago. I reregistered the domain and set about moving it to my new hosts. Over the weekend I set up everything that was needed on the new server and yesterday I requested the domain transfer.</p>
<p>Today my old hosts replied that they won't transfer the domain until the invoice is settled. So, effectively, I have to pay for the next year's hosting before I can move the domain and not use the hosting I've paid for.</p>
<p>I expect I'll have to pay the invoice (like I said, it <i>is</i> only ÃÂ£20) but it's really annoying and it will just galvanise me into moving the rest of my domains far quicker than I was planning to.</p>
<p>So, in case anyone has missed the point of this entry - PowerHost (now know as Tollon or UKUHost) are a bunch of cowboys. You really don't want to deal with them.</p></p>

<h2>Domain Owner?</h2>

I thought the owner of the domain had complete control;  Why can't you just tell the domain registrar to change the domain itself?

Yeah, thinking about it I probably could do that.<br> <br>Too late now tho'. I've paid the invoice.
