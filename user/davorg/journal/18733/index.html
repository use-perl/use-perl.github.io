<p>Having finished the silly hours I was putting in on my <a href="http://www.karmadownload.com/">last project</a> and started a "proper" 9-5 (ish) job, I now find myself with time to do some of the little projects that I have been too busy to do.<br/><br/>The first of these was to move my CVS repository onto my colo box. I'd been putting it off because I had a vague impression that it was all going to be horribly complicated. But actually it only took an hour or so. I've even put a <a href="http://cvs.dave.org.uk/">web front end</a>[1] on it so anyone can see what I've been doing.<br/><br/>It's a bit depressing seeing all of the files that haven't been updated for about two years. I need to do something about that over the weekend.<br/><br/>And yes, I'm well aware that all the cool kids have switched to Subversion. I'm very comfortable knowing that I'm not cool.<br/><br/>[1] Of course, <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/projects/cvsweb.html">cvsweb</a> (which is what I'm using) doesn't quite do things how I'd like so it's very tempting to write something myself using TT and VCS.pm.</p>

Not to stop you from writing something in TT, but if you're looking for something that works <a href="http://viewcvs.sourceforge.net/" title="sourceforge.net">ViewCVS</a sourceforge.net> is excellent. Installation is a snap and everything works like you'd expect -- well, like I expect. The project is also actively maintained.

<p>Yeah I looked at ViewCVS and whilst I usually don't choose software based on what language it's written in, I found this in a list of features:</p>
<blockquote><div> <i> Last but not least: it doesn't suffer from the "unmaintainable code effect" that hits most Perl projects sooner or later</i> </div></blockquote>
<p>I shall overcome my prejudices and take another look<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

IIRC this was written in anger from trying to extend cvsweb, which I understand is a poor example of maintainable perl code. But I don't mind that Python people can be snobs as long as they write useful tools<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)
