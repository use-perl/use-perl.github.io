<p>There are already a lot of Perl conferences and workshops planned this year and we're planning on adding another (small) one in London. To try and keep track of them all, I've created <a href="http://dave.org.uk/perl_conf/">this page</a>. If you have any corrections or additions then I'd love to hear them.

<h2>Conferences are good</h2>

The only concern I have is that if we have too many the quality may get diluted.

<p>Of course, TPC and YAPC::NA and YAPC::Europe should stay, and the German workshop also has a good track record.  But adding those others - I can't help but feel that the people who have the most interesting things to talk about will be all conferenced out.  Worse is that the "stars" could spread themselves thinly around instead of concentrating on the main ones, so they all become mediocre instead of havinga few great conferences.

</p><p>You can tentatively add an Italian Perl Workshop to your list - I saw some discussion of it on the Italian mongers' list - althuogh there's nothign confirmed and no dates yet.</p>

As far as I know quite a lot of the smaller Workshops are held in the native language of the respective country, thus giving not-so-good speakers of English an oppertunity to talk (Not that my far-from-perfect English kept me from talking at YAPCs)

<p>Spreading the stars around isn't that bad. </p>
<p>
It gives other people the opportunity to become stars by not feeling intimidated about the volume of  genius that they  must compete against when submiting a paper for presentation.
</p>
<p>
That kind of feeling keeps many people with new and iteresting things to say from even proposing talks.
