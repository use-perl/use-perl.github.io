<p><p><a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?dist=HTML-Tree">HTML::TreeBuilder</a> rocks.</p>

<p>Twice in the last week, I've wanted to create a table of contents for an HTML document. In both cases they've been documents that I've written, so the structure has been pretty well defined and I started to wonder whether I could automate the process.</p>

<p>I decided that HTML::TreeBuilder would be the right tool and started to take a closer look at the module. It's the first time I've every really used it for anything useful.</p>

<p>The result (after about an hour of hacking) is <a href="http://www.dave.org.uk/scripts/toc.pl.txt">toc.pl</a>. Currently it's pretty closely tied to the structure of my documents (it relies on the existance of <code>&lt;div></code> sections called "front" and "body") but it can very easily be used as a basis for other similar scripts.</p>

<p>Share and enjoy :)</p></p>

I did not know that module, but I have been really impressed as I was reading about it in Sean's (excellent) "Perl &amp; LWP".<br>So impressed in fact that I stole a couple of its methods and added them to XML::Twig<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;--)<br> <br>

<p>TreeBuilder is great, as it's close relative <a href="http://seach.cpan.org/search?dist=XML-TreeBuilder" title="cpan.org">XML::TreeBuilder</a cpan.org>. However they use both use HTML::Entities as found in <a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?dist=HTML-Parser" title="cpan.org">HTML::Parser</a cpan.org>, and can't deal with some valid utf-8 HTML entites because of underlying problems with Perl (or so I'm told). When 5.8 goes final, I for one will upgrade just to get the maximum out of these great modules.</p>

<p>Both make good efforts at dealing with dirty HTML and XML, where faster tools die...</p>

<p>Neither tool is perfect, but both are pretty good, and Sean answers his email</p>
