<p>The <a href="http://www.dracos.co.uk/odeon/">Accessible Odeon</a> site has been closed down following legal threats from Odeon.<br/><br/>Score a point for IE-only web sites.</p>

<h2>No matter how much you try to please them...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/cog/">cog</a> on 2004-07-12T11:41:37</h3>
...they never seem happy, do they?<br> <br>They could be taking advantage from the situation, but instead they treat the guy like that? Man...<br> <br>I just wish there was an Odeon in Portugal, so I could *NOT* go there!!!



<h2>sounds like he made a stick for his own back</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/TeeJay/">TeeJay</a> on 2004-07-12T12:11:23</h3>
He made the site <b>too</b> usable!
<p>
If he had not made all the functionality of their site work on his site he wouldn't be in this mess.
</p><p>
He should have just provided listing information, rather than allowing registration, etc. That way people would have complained to ODEON about their site rather than his if he put notices explaining that these features where unavailable.
</p><p>
ODEON obviously have an idiot for a marketing director. He hasn't thought this through at all. If he was any good at his job this site wouldn't be required in the first place. I am inclined to believe he doesn't have any facts to back him up otherise the letter would be from lawyers rather than him.
</p><p>
I hope the national papers see this and take ODEON to task about it. I certainly won't go to any ODEON cinema for the next few years
</p><p>



<h2>Bad publicity</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ajt/">ajt</a> on 2004-07-14T21:22:21</h3>
<p>It's finally made it onto the <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/07/14/odeon_disabled_website/" title="theregister.co.uk">The Register</a theregister.co.uk>, perhaps some bad publicity may encourage the PHB at Odeon to change his mind. If that doesn't work, I'm told an official letter from the <a href="http://www.rnib.org.uk/" title="rnib.org.uk">RNIB</a rnib.org.uk> and the magic words "Disability Discrimination Act" can perform wonders (in the UK, that is).</p>
