<p>I just found <a href="http://use.perl.org/comments.pl?sid=22560&cid=35716">this</a>. Is there a lot of comment spam on use.perl? I haven't noticed any before.</p>

<p>Have an admin delete the account and all associated comments? Probably the best when it's so blatant.</p>

I think that KLB is "Known Lazy Bastard" which is the use.perl equivalent of Anonymous Coward. So you probably don't want to be deleting all of those comments.<br>

<p>Ooh. Didn't know that. So we're even more helpless than wikis regarding spam?</p>

Due to a misconfiguration, anonymous comments were allowed on the site for several weeks.  I deleted that comment (something I only very rarely if ever do<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... I can't recall doing it before) because it was so blatant, and I banned the IP address from using the site.  Thanks for the heads-up.

I've seen this sort of thing several times in the past week now -- comment spam containing long lists of URLs. Someone on <code>use Perl;</code> even linked to an example in CPAN ratings, but I can't find it at the moment.<br> <br>I don't see what the spammers hope to gain by it, since the URLs aren't turned into links and thus don't affect page rank.

<blockquote><div> <tt>I don't see what the spammers hope to gain by it, since the URLs aren't turned into links and thus don't affect page rank.</tt> </div></blockquote>Probably hoping they'll be automagically turned into links.  Spammers go for volume and average case.

I guess, but is the posting for these places really so generic that the spamming scripts don't have to be customized at all? If so, maybe the solution is to make posting a little less standardized.<br> <br>Or is it that most Slash sites do linkify URLs, but this one doesn't? But then CPAN ratings isn't Slash.
