<p><p>On Saturday I spoke at the first <a href="http://conferences.mongueurs.net/bpw2007/">Belgian Perl Workshop</a>. I extracted the section on OO Perl from the <a href="http://mag-sol.com/train/teachin/">teach-in</a>. I've put the <a href="http://mag-sol.com/talks/bpw/2007/teachin-oop/">slides online</a>.</p>
<p>I had a great time. It was good to meet up with a few European Perl Mongers. Thanks to Gilles and his crew for organising it. I hope to be invited back next year (did I mention that I love Brussels?)</p>
<p>I'm sorry that I had to leave at about lunchtime. I had brought the whole family to Brussels with me and we had an appointment with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mini-Europe">Mini-Europe</a> :-)</p></p>

<h2>Dangerous inside-out examples</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/dagolden/">dagolden</a> on 2007-10-29T12:08:16</h3>
<p>First, let me say that's a great presentation -- I really like the focus on
design issues, rather than the usual construction issues.  I also like how you avoided the "religious" wars on getter/setter styles and just advised "pick a method and stick with it".</p>

<p>However, while I know you were intentionally using simplified examples, the
inside-out examples have a subtle, but potentially dangerous flaw:</p> <p><blockquote> <div><tt>$name{$self} = shift;</tt></div> </blockquote>  <p>This will silently "break" if <tt>$self</tt> is overloaded to stringify as something
other than the memory address of the object.  As that could happen in a
subclass, it's always a bad idea to use raw <tt>$self</tt> as the index into the
attribute. ("<tt>0 + $self</tt>" has the same problem if numification is overloaded.)</p>

<p>I always teach people to use "<tt>refaddr $self</tt>" -- it's the only safe
way to do memory-based indices.</p>

<p>You also didn't note thread-safety issues, but that might be too obscure a
point to be making in an introductory lesson.</p>

<p>You're absolutely right about the problems (of course). But, in my defence, I didn't have the time to go into that level of detail. All I was trying to do was to give people a high-level overview of the concepts.</p>
<p>I think that in future, I'll end that section with something along the lines of "that's basically how it works, but don't try to build classes like these yourself - instead use one of these modules as a base as they solve a number of problems that I haven't had the time to explain here."</p>

<p>You don&#8217;t have to explain the issues in any detail. Something like the following should suffice: &#8220;That <code>refaddr</code> there gives us the memory address of the reference, much like if you stringify it &#8211; but it guards against some issues I don&#8217;t have the time to expound on. Note that this isn&#8217;t thread-safe due to the use of addresses, but can be made so &#8211; again, I don&#8217;t have time to explain how. In practice, just use the Foo module and that&#8217;ll take care of these things for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>That&#8217;s under half a minute.</p>
