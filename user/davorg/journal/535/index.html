<p><p>OK, so I was really crap at keeping my journal up to
date whilst I was in San Diego :( Here are the details for
the second half of the week.</p>

<p><b>Wednesday</b> was london.pm day at the conference. It
was possible to spend the whole day watching london.pm
people giving talks! This included my "Perl for the People" talk which seemed to go pretty well. Other highlights 
included Simon's Perl::Flash talk and Leon co-presenting a talk on compilers with Damian Conway. In the evening I had
a book signing in the exhibition hall, but as there was
free drinks elsewhere, only two people came along.</p>

<p><b>Thursday</b> started with the keynote talk by
Craig Mundie of Microsoft and a reply from Michael Tiemann
of Red Hat. The rest of the day was spent in various
interesting talks. In the evening I went to the ActiveState
party where I somehow ended up in the Perl team for a 
drinking game.</p>

<p><b>Friday</b> was another "Damian Day". He talked about a
number of the modules that he'd written during his year
working for Perl and later took apart his SelfGOL program
(in a talk that really earned its title of "Extreme
Perl"). Later in the afternoon we had the Lightning Talks.
I gave my view on "Why Perl Advocacy is a Bad Idea". I've
never been so nervous before giving a talk - but it seemed
to go down OK in the end. Once the conference was over a
number of us went off to Ocean Beach where we ate Mexican
food and wandered along the beach for a while.</p>

<p>On Saturday I flew home, bringing with me Brian
Ingerson who is stopping off in London for a couple of
days on his way to YAPC::Europe. He'll be speaking to
london.pm on Tuesday.</p>

<p>All in all a great conference on many different levels.
My thanks to everyone involved in organising it.</p>
