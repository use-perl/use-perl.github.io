<p><p><b>Warning: No Perl Content!</b></p>
<p>It was our fifth wedding anniversary on Saturday. We were
going to have a really nice weekend. Gill's daughter, Jordan, came to visit as well as another couple of friends. 
It didn't really work out like that.</p>
<p>As I met Jordan at Euston she complained of a sore eye. Apparently it was filling up with gunge every two minutes. Gill said that they'd go to the chemist for some eyedrops once we'd had lunch.</p>
<p>So our other friends arrive and we eat. Then it starts
raining. Then it starts <i>really</i> raining. Then it
starts raining <i>indoors</i>. We all rush round with
bowls and towels and try to do what we can, but it's too
late, it's now raining <i>downstairs</i> as well. Water
is pouring down the kitchen walls and out of the kitchen
light fittings. Oh, and all over the new kitchen floor -
which hasn't been sealed yet.</p>
<p>Eventually the rain stops and we mop up all the water.
Gill takes Jordan off to buy some eyedrops whilst me and
a friend go up into the roof to investigate the problem.
We find a drainage bowl that is full of leaves and other
assorted rubbish. Emptying that, we're pretty sure that 
this will solve the problem.</p>
<p>Gill returns, eyedrops are applied, chinese takeaway is
ordered and we all sit down to eat it whilst watching
<i>Magnolia</i>. Jordan complains about her eye again and
we notice it's become so swollen that she can barely open
it. One of our friends suggests the 24-hour NHS advice
phoneline, which we call. The nurse there is worried and
thinks that we should probably take her to A&E (that's the
ER for our American readers).</p>
<p>By the time that a taxi is called and arrives, it's 
quarter to midnight when we arrive at the hospital. A sign
says that minor injuries are generally seen in six hours.
An A&E on a Saturday night, just after the pubs close is
not the most pleasant place to be. All human life is here -
well actually it isn't, but the scummier half is.</p>
<p>To cut a long story short, we get lucky and it's
"only" four hours before we're seen. A doctor gives us some
antiseptic eyedrops and tells her not to rub it. We call
another taxi and get home at 4:30am. Jordan is tired and
understandably upset so she sleeps with Gill and I sleep
on the sofa.</p>
<p>When we all wake up later on Sunday, our friends (who
had stayed the night) point out that they had had to move
some stuff around in the bathroom as our leak was now much
smaller, but had reappeared running down the bathroom walls.
That day it pretty much rained all day and there was 
nothing we could do but try to limit the damage.</p>
<p>Today we're in touch with builders and insurance 
companies, so hopefully things are looking up.</p>
<p>Sometimes I think we should just sell this house and
buy a newer one.</p></p>
