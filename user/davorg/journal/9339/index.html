<p><p>Have you been reading the tutorials on <a http://www.perladvent.org/2002/">The Perl Advent Calendar</a>? They're really useful and very well written.</p>
<p>If I was a publisher I'd be approaching <a href="/user/2shortplanks">2shortplanks</a> to see if he's interested in writing a book.</p></p>

<h2>Thanks</h2>

But, to be honest they're actually a bit rushed.
<p>
I love the idea that some people think that I'd written twenty five tutorials in advance.  No chance!  They're written the night before, with a few spare that I can use on nights where I'm busy having a life.
</p><p>
I guess each tutorial takes about three hours or so to write.  It does help that I have some excellent modules to work with - the very nature of the calendar means I don't have to deal with things I don't want to.</p>

Don't forget that you have a previous fifty modules to work with.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

Ahh, now you know a bit of what it's like
to have written <a href="http://www.stonehenge.com/merlyn/columns.html" title="stonehenge.com">over <i>160</i> magazine articles</a stonehenge.com>.
<p>
I figure I averaged between 2 and 6 hours on each of those, just writing, not counting the "grok" time for the underlying modules.</p>

  The odd typo may give away the fact that they've been rushed a bit but to be honest the quality is so good that I wouldn't have guessed they were written the night before. Many kudos on these!
</p>

<p>
  Two feature requests: 1) email reminders because I hate forgetting it one day and reading two the day after. Opening yesterday's box make it feel a little less "special" (ok, I use my agenda software instead, but I prefer mail<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;); and 2) comments. There have been a number of times when I have wanted to say "hey, and you can also use that to [insert some code]".
</p>

<p>
  Again thanks!
</p>

Both of these features were slated for this year's realase.  And both of them are 80% written too.
<p>
Then I ran out of time.  But hey, that's life.  Now I'm too busy doing JIT advent calendar writing, and I'm really worried about mucking with a live site.
</p><p>
However a) I will have these next year b) If plans pan out you won't have to wait that long for something similar to return.</p>

<p>They may be Last Minute tutorials, but they are still very enjoyable and well written! I don't know how many it's possible to write, but I agree that a "Cooking with CPAN/Perl" is possible<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)</p>

<p>There is even a <a href="http://www.perladvent.org/rss/" title="perladvent.org">syndication feed</a perladvent.org>, so us RSS junkies are happy too!</p>
