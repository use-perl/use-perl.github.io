<p><p>Flew from Gatwick to San Diego on Saturday on a plane that also contained at least four or five other Perl hackers (including all of the london.pm quiz team.)</p>
<p>Tried to catch a couple of hours sleep when I got to the hotel, but failed and went to the bar instead, where I spent the rest of the day eating and drinking with various people until crashing out at 9:15.</p>
<p>This meant, of course, that I was awake at 4:30 the next morning. I killed time working on my slides until 6 and then I went for a walk. Got back before 7 and ate breakfast. Later in the morning a few of us went to SeaWorld which was enjoyable, if a little tacky in places.</p>
<p>Got back to the hotel to find much larger crowds of Perl geeks hanging around the bar. Again, stayed there all evening - leaving only to register as a speaker. If you sit in the bar at a Perl conference, eventually all the Perl world will pass by.</p>
<p>Managed to stay awake until 10:15, but still woke at 4:30 this morning. Came over to the conference rooms just before 7 and spent some unsuccessful time trying to get my wireless connection working. Currently I'm using the terminal room to type this, but I need to get the wireless working as the terminal room is all Apple this year and Macs just confuse me - there just aren't enough buttons on the mouse :-/</p>
<p>Three hours until my tutorial starts. Wish me luck...</p></p>
