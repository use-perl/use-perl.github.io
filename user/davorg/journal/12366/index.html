<p><p>So I did it. I'm now the proud owner of a Powerbook G4 of some description. More importantly I also have a copy of <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/macosxmm2/"><i>Mac OS X: The Missing Manual, 2nd Edition</i></a> so I can learn how to use it. And this coming weekend is three days long as there's a public holiday on Monday which would be a perfect time to acquaint myself with my new toy.</p>
<p>But that's not what's going to happen. Oh no. We are all under dire threats from <a href="/user/gnat/">gnat</a> to get the Template Toolkit book finished by this time next week. So all Mac-ish thoughts will be banished this weekend as I get with the writin'. Honest!</p></p>

It's nice to see MacOS X growing stronger and stronger in the developer world.<br> <br>What model did you get?

Would it be terribly bad of me to admit that I don't know<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) That's why I said it was a "Powerbook G4 of some description". I think it's a 15" screen, but I'm sure things will become clearer once I've spent some time playing with it.

If it's <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/pdcawley/journal/9403" title="perl.org">pdcawley's old laptop</a perl.org>, then it's a <a href="http://www.lowendmac.com/pb2/pbg4.html" title="lowendmac.com">500MHz G4 PowerBook</a lowendmac.com>, which means it has the old, lower res (1152x768 iirc) screen, and no DVI out, and probably only a DVD not combo drive.<br> <br>Mind you, I'm basing this on a couple of assumptions, which may turn out to be broken somewhere.

It is, indeed, pdcawley's old machine and your description sounds pretty accurate from what I can see.

Definitely accurate.

Ooh, TT Book<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... I didn't know that it was in the works. Looking forward to it!

<p>No kidding!  I also didn't know about the book, but I'm pretty darned excited to hear about it.  I'm curious to know if it's going to be affected by any of the upcoming <a href="http://www.template-toolkit.org/v3/" title="template-toolkit.org">TT V3</a template-toolkit.org> material.</p>

<p>TT3 is still very much on the (far off) horizon
-- Andy doesn't even have recent code to show us -- so we're not letting it influence the book at all.  (I'm one of Dave's co-authors, thus the "we".)</p>
