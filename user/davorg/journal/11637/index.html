<p><p>It seems that some spammer bastard has decided that he will put invented addresses at dave.org.uk as the "Return-Path" and "From" headers in his spam. This means, of course, that I then get all of the undelivered email bounces. Which is a major pain.</p>
<p>So if you get spam that claims to be from dave.org.uk, it's not really me!</p></p>

<h2>Same Thing...</h2>

The same thing has happened to me.  I'm trying to figure out ways to have them stop.  One was to setup Mail::Audit to forward each bounce with a 2 MEG<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.bmp image with the text.<br/><br/>Another idea what to send a port scan with a nice note to please stop.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

Hmm, how does it help? Where are you going to forward these images?

<h2>AOL...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/mir/">mir</a> on 2003-04-14T13:43:16</h3>
<p>Not as in "AOL is reponsible for this", AOL as in "&lt;aol mode="on"&gt;me too!!!&lt;/aol&gt;.</p>
<p>It caused me to take a real long look at the headers, decide that it was definitely not me spamming (besides, I do not know any naughty farmgirl banned in over 51 states) and that it probably came from some compuserve host in Canada.</p>
<p>Come to think about it, isn't Compuserve part of AOL these days? Then I guess I can blame it on AOL after all.</p>

Bizarrely enough, spoofed emails with my domain have been hitting AOL and Compuserver at a rate of knots. Unfortunately their email systems are sending bouncebacks to me, which in my view makes them as bad as the spammers. As a consequence they have now been blacklisted.

<p>
I've been getting this for the past few days as well.
</p>
<p>
They appear to have taken CPAN user ids as well as the domain names to send farm girl spam. Somehow I doubt that (judging from some of the bounces) LDS, LBROCARD, etc, would have decided to root my mail server from their compuserve accounts, setup a mailbox and send this sort of email from it.

I could be wrong though<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)
