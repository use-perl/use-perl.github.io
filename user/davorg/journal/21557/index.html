<p>I was at a pub quiz last night. One of the questions was "which baseball team sold Babe Ruth to the New York Yankees?"<br/><br/>Now I know nothing about baseball. I know nothing about British sports, let alone weird rounders rip-offs that are played on the other side of the world.<br/><br/>But I <i>do</i> know the name of one other baseball team - because it was added to the use.perl header a couple of weeks ago (tho', come to think of it, I don't know how I knew it was a baseball team as opposed to basketball or American football - must have dragged that up from my memory somehow).<br/><br/>So we guessed at "Boston Red Sox" because it was the only answer we had. And it turns out to be the right answer.<br/><br/>So thanks for that pudge :)</p>

Perhaps you subconsciously remembered that the Sox logo has a baseball on it (under the socks).

That just looks like an unrecognisable dot to me.<br> <br>And I'm not sure I know what a baseball looks like anyway. Or at least, not in enough detail to distinguish it from half a dozen other sports balls.

The unrecognizable dot you speak of is actually
a copyright symbol, I think.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<p>

The baseball is behind the socks, although if you aren't familiar then it just looks like a circle with a few semicircles cutting through it.</p><p>
