<p><p>Well, I've been in San Diego for four days, so I guess it's about time I wrote a journal entry. If gnat can find time to write one then I've got no excuse :)</p>
<p>So here's a summary of what's happened so far...</p>
<p><b>Saturday</b> - arrived at the hotel at about 4pm
after a pretty uneventful flight. Tried to grab a couple
of hours sleep, but people kept phoning to arange to meet
me in the bar. Pretty quiet night in the bar with a number
of the early arrivals.</p>
<p><b>Sunday</b> - went to the san Diego zoo with a group
of people. The largest zoo in the world, they say - and I
can quite believe them! Got back to the hotel and 
registered as a speaker. Met up with lots of other
speakers. In the evening a <i>large</i> group of us took
a shuttle bus into the Old Town and ate Mexican food.</p>
<p><b>Monday</b> - first day of the tutorials. I sat in on
Damian Conway's "Data Munging with Perl" talk - just to
make sure he was getting it all right, you understand :)
In the evening I went to Casey West's p5p impressions
night and later met up with a number of people from
PerlMonks. Finally, I hovered on the outskirts of the p5p
meeting for half an hour or so, before going back to the 
bar for one last drink with Andy Wardley and Peter 
Haworth.</p>
<p><b>Tuesday</b> - more tutorials. Didn't go to a 
tutorial in the morning. I sat in the speakers registration
area chatting to people and hacking. I released version
2.0 of Symbol::Approx::Sub and worked on the slides for
my talk. After lunch I went to Mark Dominus' "Stolen
Secrets" talk. This is all about using Lisp programming
techniques in Perl. In the evening we all went to Larry's
"State of the Onion" talk and the Internet Quiz Show.
The london.pm team (The Presidents Dog) again came second,
but we weren't as cruelly robbed as last year. Inbetween
round of the quiz, <tt>brian d foy</tt> presented the
White Camel Awards. One of them went to the organisers of
last year's YAPC::Europe. As most of them weren't here,
Leon and I accepted the award and I'll represent it next
week in Amsterdam.</p>
<p>Today is the first day of the conference. It's possible
to be watching members of london.pm speaking all day. I'm
giving my talk straight after lunch, and this evening I'm
doing a book signing in the exhibition hall.</p>
<p>More details tomorrow...</p></p>
