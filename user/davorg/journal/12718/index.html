<p><p>Looks like I'll be going the whole year without speaking at a conference. My proposals for OSCON were all rejected some time ago, and now it seems that none of my proposals for YAPC::Europe were accepted either. Their <a href="http://yapc.mongueurs.net/yapc/static/cft.html">web site says</a> that all speakers will be contacted by June 8th and I've heard nothing.</p>
<p>I'll still be going to YAPC::Europe of course, but it will be slightly strange to go to a conference and not speak. The last time that happened was at OSCON in 2000.</p>
<p>I'm actually quite looking forward to it.</p> </p>

<h2>They're late</h2>

Actually, I think they're just late. I didn't hear anything either. If they did decide on what to reject and what to accept, they would've put a list on their site. Last rumours I heard was something about chances of being accepted being 99.999%, but that was just a rumour.



<h2>We. Are. Actually. Late.</h2>

<p>It looks like we've been late all year.</p>
