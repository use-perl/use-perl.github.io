<p><p>I love it when Perl makes my life easier.</p.

<p>I read my email in mutt on a remote server. This is fine, but can be a bit of a problem when I want to access a MIME attachment. Then I need to save the attachment to the filesystem and use scp to copy it to my local system.</p>

<p>But after watching Casey's talk on filtering email on the Perl Whirl, I spent 20 minutes knocking up this program which saves attachments to a directory in my web server's document tree. Now I can just go to a (password protected) page on my web site and read any attachment.</p>

<p>Email::MIME is a great module.</p>

<p><blockquote><div> <i>I spent 20 minutes knocking up this program</i> </div></blockquote>
I don't think any American writer would have used that phrase in quite that fashion.
<p>I remember reading in a Sherlock Holmes story, when Holmes wakes up Dr. Watson by knocking on his door early in the morning, he apologizes by saying:
</p><blockquote><div>Very sorry to knock you up, Watson, but it's the common lot this morning.  Someone knocked up Mrs. Hudson, she prevailed upon me, and I upon you.</div></blockquote>
(I may not have the quote 100%, but it's very close.)

Hmmm, it's not uncommon in British English either, as a term for being pregnant.  But using it in a phrase to mean "quickly built" is also not uncommon and it's normally fairly easy to distinguish by context!

<h2>Similar to what I have</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Aristotle/">Aristotle</a> on 2004-11-02T20:46:26</h3>
<p>Nine is quite a bit more elaborate though. Notable differences:</p> <blockquote><div> <tt>sysopen my $fh, $fn, O_WRONLY | O_EXCL | O_CREAT<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; or die "Couldn't open $fn for writing: $!\n";</tt> </div></blockquote> <p>so I don't get stuff inadvertantly overwritten. Also,</p> <blockquote><div> <tt>for( $msg-&gt;parts ) {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; my $fn = $_-&gt;filename;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; next if not defined $fn;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; #<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...<br>}</tt> </div></blockquote> <p>so I don't have to look at MIME types &mdash; that way only seemed to lead to madness. (What're you passing a parameter to <code>-&gt;filename()</code> for btw?)</p>

<p>Other reasons for its length include a folder processing mode, ability to read files passed to it on the command line, and more. I have it nearly PODded up and everything, too &mdash; should probably put it online somewhere. Not that it's a huge amount of work, but I like to make small but shiny tools.<nobr> <wbr></nobr><tt>:-)</tt> </p>

<p>I have noticed that Perl gets all flustered if you try to throw excessively large folders at it, though.<nobr> <wbr></nobr><tt>:-(</tt> It works very fine from my<nobr> <wbr></nobr><tt>.procmail</tt> though. <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Email-MIME/" title="cpan.org">Email::MIME</a cpan.org> is quite a fine module indeed, along with all the other nuggets the Perl Email Project turned out.</p>

<blockquote><div> <i>What're you passing a parameter to -&gt;filename() for btw?</i> </div></blockquote>
<p>The docs say 'Normally it will return the filename from the headers, but if filename is passed a true parameter, it will generate an appropriate "stable" filename if one is not found in the MIME headers.' So it's a safety feature. It invents a filename if one isn't already given.</p>

<h2>Same thing, but different</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/brian_d_foy/">brian_d_foy</a> on 2004-11-02T21:33:57</h3>
I wrote about this in The Perl Journal for one of the recent issues.  I do the same thing, although each email address gets their own directory, and I only run it from within PINE when I want to detach something.



<h2>Path Attacks?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/pjf/">pjf</a> on 2004-11-03T13:23:02</h3>
<p>
<i>Davorg</i> knocked up a script that contained:
</p> <blockquote><div> <tt>&nbsp; &nbsp; my $file = DUMP . $mime-&gt;filename(1);<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; open FILE, '&gt;', $file or die $!;</tt> </div></blockquote> <p>
What happens when I send you an attachment with a filename of<nobr> <wbr></nobr><tt>../../../../../home/davorg/.ssh/authorized_keys</tt>, or perhaps more innocently<nobr> <wbr></nobr><tt>.htaccess</tt>?
</p> <p>
This is an excellent use for <tt>File::Basename</tt>, and Aristotle's previous <tt>sysopen()</tt> involving <tt>O_EXCL|O_CREAT</tt>.
</p> <p>
No prizes for guessing <a href="http://perltraining.com.au/perlsec.html" title="perltraining.com.au">which  course</a perltraining.com.au> I've been recently reviewing.

I don't suppose you'd believe that this was a simplified copy of the program would you<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br> <br>It's also been pointed out that an attachment called<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.htaccess would have interesting results.<br> <br>
