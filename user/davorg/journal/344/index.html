<p><p>Hmm... so the small PC Bookshop at Bank didn't have <i>CGI Programming 101</i> in stock. Turns out this was a blessing in disguise as Jacqueline emailed again and offered to send me a copy. She also asked what sort of compensation I wanted for helping her. I replied that I didn't expect any compensation, but that if her or her publisher insisted on giving me some then I wouldn't complain :)</p>

<p>Of course, having gone into the PC Bookshop expecting to buy something it was impossible to leave empty handed. I picked up copies of the O'Reilly Pocket Refs to CSS and XML (2ed) and a new book in the Extreme Programming series. This one is called "XP In Practice". Looking at the list of books in the series, I see that there are now seven of them and I've only seen four. Looks like the XP guys have worked out that it doesn't really matter whether or not your methods work - just as long as you keep publishing books on the subject :)</p>

<p>Mini flame-fest on the london.pm mailing list yesterday.
Some people objected to the <a href="http://london.pm.org/about/general.html">FAQ about templating systems</a> on the <a href="http://london.pm.org">new website</a>. It seems that not everyone is convinced that the <a href="www.tt2.org">Template Toolkit</a> is the best templating system. The wording got changed, so everyone's happy now - but I still think that TT is the best choice for most things.</p>

<p>Still no response from Craig Patchett or Matt Wright.</p></p>
