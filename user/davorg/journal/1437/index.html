<p><p>It would be possible to build a good argument that a
Beatle's livespan is in inverse proportion to his 
talent.</p>
<p>Looks like Ringo be be around for a <i>looong</i> time
then.</p>
<p>Hmmm... I wonder how Stu Sutcliffe and George Martin
fit in to this theory...</p></p>

I'd argue that Paul was more talented than George, at least in terms of songwriting.  Stu was rumored to not know how to play or care about playing.  So I would rank 'em in talent like so:<br>
<ol>
<li>John Lennon</li>
<li>Paul McCartney</li>
<li>George Harrison</li>
<li>Ringo</li>
<li>Pete Best</li>
<li>Stu</li>
</ol>
Your theory could hold true if you skip every other and start with the last.  Guess that would make Pete Best next...

<p>Paul was certainly a more prolific songwriter and also a more popularist songwriter but, in my opinion, George wrote far better songs.</p>
<p>When I look at a list of my favourite Beatle's
songs, most of them are Lennon songs, but Harrison wrote some great stuff -  listen to "Within You, Without You", "If I Needed Someone" and (especially) "Piggies".</p>
<p>McCartney songs, on the other hand, I largely see as fillers.</p>
<p>Of course, this is all subjective and the Kinks were far better anyway<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

At the expense of seeming totally naive, I've never heard any Kinks music (at least not intentionally).  Must be b/c I'm married to a total Beatles fan...<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)  I'll go check out cdnow.

Regardless of the theory, I'm afraid you hit the nail on the head - we're in for a LOOOOOOONG time w/ Ringo.</p>

Unless something happened while I wasn't looking, Ms Dion isn't a beatle, so the rule doesn't apply.
<br>
<br>Please, please tell me something didn't happen while I wasn't looking. An immortal Celine Dion is just too much to contemplate.
