<p><p>Someone is <a href="http://jobs.perl.org/job/5540">looking for help</a> installing <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/WWW-Myspace/">WWW::MySpace</a>. And they're willing to pay $300 if you're successful.</p>

If wikipedia thinks he's an arsehole, that's a point in his favour.

<h2>The catch is ...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/drhyde/">drhyde</a> on 2007-03-29T12:05:40</h3>
... that you'll have to have something to do with the abomination that is Myspace.  Thanks, but no thanks.



<h2>I know more of the story</h2>

This is from memory (I don't keep IRC logs).<br><br>K comes into #perl and says he will pay $100 for someone to login to his server, get WWW::Myspace installed, and explain how to do it - easy money.<br><br>I reply that we are not here looking for jobs, that we are here mostly to help people learn for free, and that you couldn't afford us if you hired us.  I went on to mention that Randal (merlyn) charges $250/hr with a 4 hour minimum.<br><br>Insert a bunch of banter about how futile WWW::Myspace must be anyway - blah blah blah<br>K's offer goes up in increments of $100 claiming it shouldn't take any of us more than an hour.<br><br>I decide to see how hard it is to install (Cygwin) and am amazed that over 70 dependent modules need to be installed.  I have to hand hold a few but nothing too difficult.<br><br>I announce success in the channel.<br><br>K private messages me unsolicited - did you get the tests to pass?<br><br>I reply that it is never ok to private message someone that doesn't know you and hasn't told you it is acceptable.  I indicate I would rather spend my free time helping people who want to learn.<br><br>K indicates that someone got all the dependencies to install for him but couldn't get the test suite to run.<br><br>At this point, I RTFM and discover that the author of WWW::Myspace has a huge warning that using the module is likely going to get your account deleted.<br><br>I tell K that<br>1.  WWW::Myspace likely violates the EULA<br>2.  There are bug reports indicating test failures<br>3.  Older versions seem to work fine<br>4.  I installed all versions simultaneously<br><br>K's response was - I don't care and I will take that risk.<br><br>I told him I wouldn't, informed the channel about WWW::Myspace, and departed for the evening
