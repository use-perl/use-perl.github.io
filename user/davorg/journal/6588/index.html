<p><p>As I mentioned yesterday, Monday started for me at 4:30am - gotta love those time differences. Did a bit of last minute tuning on the slides for my tutorial, before heading to breakfast at about 7am.</p>

<p>After breakfast, I sat in Schwern and chromatic's tutorial on testing for a while, but was too keyed up about doing my tutorial and couldn't concentrate so I went and sat in the terminal room for a while (still can't get my wireless connection working properly).</p>

<p>As was leaving the terminal room area, <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/ziggy">Ziggy</a> called me over and I spent a fun hour or so being photographed by <a href="http://www.supersnail.com/">Supersnail</a> with a few other Perl geeks. It was the perfect way to avaoid getting too stressed about my impending tutorial.</p>

<p>But after lunch, it could be put off no longer. I headed towards Grande Ballroom C to teach my class. All in all, I was happy with the way it went. The vast majority of people came pack after the break and the audience asked a number of interesting questions. I guess I'll have to wait until the evaulations come back before I know for such what they thought of me.</p>

<p>Went to the bar after the tutorial finished and was just about to order a drnk when <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/acme">acme</a> whisked me off to interview me for a top sekrit project. Even I don't really know what it was about. I expect we'll find out more later this week.</p>

<p>Grabbed a quick meal and then went to a couple of BOF sessions. The Perl Trainers BOF was a lot of fun - swapping stories about Perl training courses with som of the best-known Perl trainers. Then it was <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/cwest">cwest</a>'s PDP BOF.</p>

<p>PDP the Perl Documentation Project. It's intended to produce a bigger and better body of Perl documentation aimed at the different levels of Perl users who might find some of the existing docs a bit indigestable. I seem to have volunteered both as a writer and also as a programmer on this project. Watch <a href="http://use.perl.org">use.perl</a> this week for more announcements on this.</p>

<p>Got back to the bar at about 10pm and sat round chatting to various interesting people for the next hour or so.</p>

<p>I think I'm adjusting to the timezone tho'. I slept until after 6:30 this morning.</p>

<p>p.s. Don't believe anything about london.pm that boojum writes in her <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/1733">weblog</a>. It's all lies.</p></p>
