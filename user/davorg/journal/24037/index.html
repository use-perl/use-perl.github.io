<p>I'm lucky enough that publishers occasionally send me free copies of books completely out of the blue. Last week I got possibly the most unexpected book I've ever recieved - a copy of the new edition of the <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/pythoncook2/"><i>Python Cookbook</i></a>.<br/><br/>After scratching my head a bit, I remembered getting an email several months ago from the editor asking for my permission to credit me for a tip that they were using in the book. I was confused as to how anything I'd said could be of any use to a Python programmer, but after a fair amount of Googling I found what I was looking for.<br/><br/>It seems that a couple of years ago I got (briefly) involved in a discussion on the ActiveState Python board. They were discussing sorting algorithms and someone said that Python's "Decorate-Sort-Undecorate" (or DSU) method was very close to Perl's Schwartzian Transform. My sole input to the discussion was to point out that it was, in fact, closer to the Guttman-Rosler Transform.<br/><br/>And that's the fact that someone picked up on and thought would be useful enough to mention in the <i>Python Cookbook</i>. So there I am credited in recipe 5.2 on "Sorting a List of Strings Case-Insensitively" (along with Guido!) And that's why I got a free copy of the book.</p>

Hi Davorg. In all humility, it was me who first noticed this error in the Python Cookbook, as proved by
<a href="http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.fwp/3281" title="perl.org">this post</a perl.org>.
After my fwp post, I was delighted to
see you post a correction
to the
<a href="http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Cookbook/Python/Recipe/52234" title="activestate.com">Python Cookbook web site</a activestate.com>
on 16 July 2003.
Maybe you forgot you did that.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

Well that, at least, explains how I heard about the discussion and found my way to the Python site. To be honest I _had_ completely forgotten about it until I got the email from the Python Cookbook team (which, it seems, was in October last year).<br> <br>Anyway I'm sorry if I beat you to it in replying to the Python discussion.

No need for apology. Hope you enjoy the book.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)
I'd long forgotten about that exchange also.
I don't mind missing out on a free book because I've lost interest in Python since then and am pouring all my energy into learning Perl 6 nowadays. ^.^
