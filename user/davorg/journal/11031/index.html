<p><p>The following email just appeared in my inbox. Given that it was addressed to my sourceforge email address I'm assuming that the sender's anger is really aimed at some site that is using one of the nms programs.</p>

<p>The bit about me sitting in America daily is a nice touch :)</p></p>

<h2>Anger Act Two</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/davorg/">davorg</a> on 2003-03-15T10:45:21</h3>
<p>I sent a complaint about the email off to the postmaster and this morning this appeared in my inbox.</p>
<blockquote><div> <i>Mr Cross I would like to appologise if I strongly offended you in my letter it was meant to only be mildly offensive. I felt  personally offended by the apalling memorandum calling for the impeachment of president Bush my commander in chief. I chose the strong words not meant as a threat but meant as the expressions of deep annoyance and frustration towards the ignorant left wing that I feel if ruining the world. If you feel wronged by recieving such email then prehaps you should distance yourself and email address from webpages and ideals that violate every AMERICAN FIBER that we have woven into our beings from birth. The thought of leading a charge to impeach my president because he feels a need to conquer evil and protect us makes naseau rise in the depths of my soul. I keenly niticed sir that there was no direct feedback link on the "IMPEACH BUSH" webpage however the creators of the page kindly left a link to you, therfore I suspect I willnot be the only pissed off American you get a letter from.</i> </div></blockquote>
<p>Which I'm happy to accept as an apology (if a slightly ungracious and ungrammatical one).</p>
<p>I wish I knew which site he was talking about tho'.</p>

<em>I wish I knew which site he was talking about tho'.</em> <br> <br>At least he cleared up "which side" he is on, even if you are unsure of the specifics.  From the initial message, I wasn't quite sure if he was for or against the President.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

The spelling of the end of "appologise" was a nice touch -- he's obviously trying to make you more comfortable by writing in your own language, despite your lack of AMERICAN FIBER (I think I'm going to have to start a breakfast cereal company now).<br> <br>I'm surprised you didn't get a real apology, since I'd expect the air force to take it seriously when someone misuses a military e-mail address for such a message. When a civilian insults a member of the military by e-mail, the <a href="http://www.sxu.edu/academ/artsci/history/pkirstein/nov7.html" title="sxu.edu">forced apology</a sxu.edu> is a bit more gracious. But then I suppose you're only a furriner.<br> <br>I'm sure you'll be distancing yourself from anti-Bush folks right away.
