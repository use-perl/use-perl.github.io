<p><p>Tonight the BBC <b>finally</b> got round to showing <i>Once More With Feeling</i> the musical episode of Buffy. But for some reason they decided to go back on <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/buffy/news/02010206.shtml">what they had previously said</a> and only showed the 45 minute version. Having previously seen the extended version on Sky, the cuts were very obvious to me.</p>
<p>Luckily for me I just happen to have a MPEG of the full version laying around on a hard disk so I decided to watch that as well to remind me of how good it originally was. As I tried to play it I discovered that somehow in the upgrade from Rehat 7.2 to 8.0 I'd lost my MPEG player app. A couple of minutes at <a href="http://rpmfind.net/">rpmfind</a> and it was reinstalled and I was happily watching the show.</p>

<p>I should have stopped there. But I didn't.</p>

<p>I decided to see if I could find any better MPEG player on the net. I came across <a href="http://videolan.org/">VLC</a> which sounded very shiny, so I started downloading RPMs. Of course all of the RPMs i downloaded needed other RPMs installed before I could install them, so it took me about half an hour to track down and install all of the dependencies.</p>

<p>Once I'd done that I found that VLC could play MPEGs, but I was only getting audio. The video was blank. I went back to my orignal MPEG player only to find that I'd infected that with the same disease.</p>

<p>So now I've got about half an hour's worth of RPM installations to back out. That's going to have to wait until tomorrow.</p>

<p>And I still didn't get to see all of <i>Once More With Feeling</i>.</p></p>

<h2>VHS</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/2shortplanks/">2shortplanks</a> on 2002-12-20T01:15:58</h3>
I've got it on VHS if you want to borrow it.
<p>
I've yet to have a codec problem with it, though I do find reconfiguring the TV takes too many button presses to get both the audio and visual to display at the same time - though again I think that's a quirk of my setup rather than a fault of the format.</p>



<h2>Once More With Cuts</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/osfameron/">osfameron</a> on 2003-01-03T14:18:00</h3>
I saw both the early evening screening
(cut) and the weekend late repeat (uncut), and,
oddly, I think I prefer the cut version... it
seemed to make the dialogue punchier.<p>
(Though it was a shame they cut the musical style
opening with the characters getting ready in the
morning).</p>

<p>Can't agree with that I'm afraid. The cut version removes a lot of stuff that I enjoyed - especially Buffy's song <i>What Can't We Face</i> which follows right after <i>I've Got A Theory</i>. It's great largely for the lines:</p>
<blockquote><div> We have to try<br>
We'll pay the price
It's do or die<br>
Hey, I&#8217;ve died twice</div></blockquote>
