<p><p>Finally I wake up at a civilised time in the money - just after 6:30am.</p>
<p>I started off in <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/Matts/">Matts'</a> tutorial on POE, but confess to cutting out before very long. Not, I hesitate to add, because it was a bad tutorial (it most certainly wasn't) but because there were some people that I needed to speak to about various things.</p>
<p>After lunch I sat in Schwern's talk "How to be lazy without trying - Redux". This is basically a talk on good software engineering techniques, with an emphasis on things that you can do to lift the quality of your work if you're not in control of the team that you work with. When I see talks like this, I'm constantly amazed by the number of people who haven't heard of basic software engineering ideas.</p>
<p>A quick dinner in the lobby (not that anything can be brought to you "quickly" in this hotel!) and we're all off to hear Larry's "State of the Onion" talk. Larry was as entertaining as he always is. This year he based his talk around the six feaure articles in the latest edition of <i>Scientific American</i>.</p>
<p>After Larry, Dick and Lori from ActiveState presented the ActiveState Programmers' Awards. The proceedings were slightly dampened by the fact that none of the recipients were present. It was really good to see <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/Matts/">Matts</a> win <i>two</i> awards (both Perl and XSLT).</p>
<p>Then came the Internet Quiz. I'm happy to report that london.pm broke its streak of always coming second in the competition. Unfortunately we achieved that by being knocked out in the first round. There's always next year, I guess.</p>
<p>I then spent a couple of hours socialising with various Perl Mongers in the lobby bar, but left soon after people (naming no names) started simulating oral sex on a ketchup bottle.</p></p>
