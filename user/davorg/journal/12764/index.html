<p><a href="http://www.badgers.org.uk/">Badgers</a> are great animals. We like badgers a lot.<br/><br/>A badger would be an excellent choice for the animal on an O'Reilly book. </p>


<hr/>



<h2>Badgers are wise</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ajt/">ajt</a> on 2003-06-12T08:03:45</h3>
<p>Badgers are often portrayed as wise animals in children's literature, so they had a good publishing track record already...</p>

<p>But what technology needs a Badger? It's got to be something tough and industrious in an understated sort of way.</p>

<p>Interesting all my computers are named after mammals, by desktop system is "Marmot", the notebook is "Loutre", the small Linux box is "Loir" and the Sun is "Badger"- I wanted to suggest compact power.</p>



<h2>Badgers?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/james/">james</a> on 2003-06-12T09:19:56</h3>
BADGERS? WE DON'T NEED NO STEENKIN' BADGERS!<br>&lt;/obUHFQuote&gt;<br> <br>Sorry, couldn't resist...<br> <br>



<h2>Wait for me!</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/djberg96/">djberg96</a> on 2003-06-12T15:23:46</h3>
As an alumnus of the University of Wisconsin - Madison (where our mascot is the Badger), I would like to request that O'Reilly only use the Badger if the author is from UW-Madison, or at the very least, Wisconsin (the Badger is the official state animal).
<p><nobr> <wbr></nobr>/me now sits back and waits for an offer from O'Reilly &amp; Associates.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:P</p>



<h2>Badgers. Pah.</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/2shortplanks/">2shortplanks</a> on 2003-06-12T23:31:04</h3>
Badgers are cool, but what we really need are <i>Invisible</i> animals on the cover of books.
<p>
That would really be cool.
</p><p>
Obviously, we'd have to have some way of showing that the animal is obviously there, since people wouldn't be able to see it per say.  For example, we could have a man hitting an invisible great dane
with a newspaper as it prods him in the stomach with
it's cold nose.
</p><p>
Now that would be something.</p>
