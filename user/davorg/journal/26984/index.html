<p><p>I'm getting very close to just walking away from the <a href="http://nms-cgi.sf.net/">nms project</a>. A lot of the time it's just more hassle than it's worth.</p>

<p>This morning I woke up to an email from another "satisfied customer". Apparently people have somehow compromised his site through the use of our formmail program and are using it to send porn spam. This is, of course all highly unlikely but it's impossible to explain why it's impossible as he doesn't include any details of the attack.</p>

<p>And has he contacted me to ask for our help investigating the problem? Well no. He says:</p>

<blockquote><i>I am now in the process of filing a complaint against you and your website hosting company for providing a tool that can be used in the generating and delivering of SPAM.</i></blockquote>

<p>I really hate the culture that encourages people to react like this. To attack people immediately without seeing if the problem can be resolved amicably first. And this is getting more and more common. I'm starting to wonder if there's any point in spending time on a project like nms if you just get grief for it.</p>

<p>It's not all bad tho'. Amusingingly, he goes on to say:</p>

<blockquote><i>I am also contacting Matt Wright to make him aware of your actions in dealing with his script.</i></blockquote>

<p>I'd be interested to read that email exchange. Matt is completely aware of our project. He's fully in <A href="http://scriptarchive.com/nms.html">support</a> of it. He even provides downloads of our programs from his site.</p>

<p>p.s. By the way, I should point out that I know I exaggerated in the title of this entry. As far as I know I'm not actually being sued.... yet.</p></p>

<p>Tell people what to do and they don't listen. Help them and they don't thank you. Give them something and they ask for more, or complain when they are unable to use it.</p>

<p>I always make a point of trying to email people to thank them for things I use. I know I can't thank everyone individually, but I try to add something a little positive to what I'm sure is an increasingly negative inbox...</p>

I was just about to suggest deleting the mail and giving the fact that most people are idiots no further thought, but this is even better.

<p>A liability notice should do for the legal threats at least. Perhaps you should have one up and point the guy at it (no warranty or suitability for any purpose, don't sue me if you can't lock down your own server etc etc)</p>
