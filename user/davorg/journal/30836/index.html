Hi Dave,<br><br>thanks for sharing your slides. It's great that I can at least track some of the talks from YAPC if I can't come.<br><br>Additionally, I think your thoughts on advocacy are pretty much dead on.<br><br>Steffen

I just read your ORM talk slides. Alzabo does much of that work already.

I used that to re-create an Oracle schema that I was moving from an Access db.<br><br>Any chance of putting those into PDF format?

<p>Good plan. I'll look at that next week.</p>

If you print it, it uses a different stylesheet and produces a nice PDF if your OS has print-to-pdf features.

<p> <i>Stop being fucking rude to newbies!</i> </p>

<p>Did you say that? That is the one thing I don't like about Perl and it has nothing to do with the language! I have been doing some Tcl work lately. Now Tcl is a cool language and it has some perception baggage as well. What I like about Tcl mostly? The community is the friendliest and helpful of any (including the Ruby one) that I have participated in bar none. That goes a looong way with someone trying to pick up a language.</p>

<p>I was going to. But when that point appeared on the slide, everyone laughed, so I didn't actually have to say it out loud.</p>
<p>I got the point across tho'<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>

I am sure they laughed...because they know it is true!  : )

<h2>ORM questions</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/sigzero/">sigzero</a> on 2006-09-01T23:54:19</h3>
<p>Q1: Since you have a definate opinion of what an ORM should do, is there one in the Perl community that you prefer?</p>

<p>Q2: I think you are probably too busy to create the <i>ultimate</i> ORM, are you helping one of the other ORM projects to realize the Perl ORM nirvana?</p>

<p>Nope. Not yet. However, in the 48 hours since I gave that talk, I've heard a _lot_ of opinions from other people. I'll definitely be looking closely at <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/DBIx-Class/lib/DBIx/Class.pm" title="cpan.org">DBIx::Class</a cpan.org> over the next few weeks.</p>

<blockquote> <div><i>Q2: I think you are probably too busy to create the ultimate ORM, are you helping one of the other ORM projects to realize the Perl ORM nirvana?</i></div> </blockquote>

<p>Nope. Although I rant a lot, it doesn't really annoy me enough to push into actually doing anything about it (well, except ranting). Feel free to adapt your opinion of my opinions accordingly<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>
