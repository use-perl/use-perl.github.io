<p><p>(or at least, I <i>think</i> that's what III stood for)</p>
<p>Who remembers III? It was a financial information web site and it was going to be one of the great successes of the UK dotcom boom. Except it never quite happened like that and 18 months ago it was sold to the Australian insurance company and was rebranded as <a href="http://www.ample.com/">Ample</a> (but notice what the URL redirects to). For 18 months, AMP have tried to make money out of the site.</p>
<p>And yesterday they seem to have admitted failure. Yesterday AMP <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/story/0,3604,947886,00.html">announced</a> that they were splitting off the UK part of the business to enable it to sink or swim on its own. As part of this announcement they also said that they wanted to sell off some part s of the business. This includes Ample.</p>
<p>III/Ample has at one time or another employed more members of London.pm than just about any other company. It would be a shame to see it go. I wonder whether London.pm should have a whip-round to buy it :)</p></p>

They gave out some nice fluid filled mouse mats at YAPC 19100 I seem to remember.....
