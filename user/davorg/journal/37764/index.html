<div class="span8">
<p><p>A few years ago I tried to register the domain perlhacks.com. It wasn't available at the time so I registered the domain perlhacks.org instead. As so often happens, I didn't have time for the project I planned to use it for so it did nothing useful until I made it a redirection to the O'Reilly catalogue page for <a href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596526740/">Perl Hacks</a>. At that point I largely forgot about the domain.</p>
<p>A couple of weeks ago I got an email from someone telling me that perlhacks.com was for sale. This was a domain reseller and they were targeting me because I already owned the .org. They were asking for $997 (but the web page also said 'make us an offer'). They must have been pretty desperate as over the next week or so I got three or four more emails from the same people. They never dropped their price though.</p>
<p>Today I got another mail from them. And this time when I visited the site the price had dropped to $99. I mentioned this in passing on the #london.pm IRC channel and someone else pointed out that actually the domain had lapsed and was available for anyone to buy. In which case, $99 was far more than you'd expect to pay.</p>
<p>I checked with my usual domain register and found that the domain was, indeed, available. So I ordered it. Actually three of us ordered it at about the same time and my registry obviously had the fastest systems in place as I got the registration. For less than ÃÂ£10. I then took great pleasure in replying to the people who were trying to sell me the domain telling them what I'd done. I didn't get a reply.</p>
<p>But now I have both perlhacks.org <i>and</i> perlhacks.com. And I still don't really have a plan for what I'm going to do with them.</p>
<p>Does anyone have any ideas?</p></p>

<h2>Why not keep it simple...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/sigzero/">sigzero</a> on 2008-10-29T20:39:26</h3>
<p>Make it a place where a user can post a "hack" and people can vote it up or down. You can then tagged the "hack" so if I go there and I want to see "Vim" hacks I can do a search.</p><p>I am not aware of something similar...though I don't know all the Perl sites out there.</p>



<h2>perl wiki hackes</h2>

install wiki, then everybody can contribute to write about perl tip and tricks, hacks, best practices, module rating , integrations and etc.
something like vim tips in wikia
<a href="http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page" title="wikia.com">http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page</a wikia.com>

<p>That would be good. That way it becomes "self maintaining" as much as possible.</p>
