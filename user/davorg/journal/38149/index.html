<p><p><a href="http://www.prweb.com/releases/2008/12/prweb1783874.htm">The Perl Foundation Migrates the Perl 5 Development Repository to the Git Version Control System</a></p>

<p>That's not news, of course. You all read that <a href="http://use.perl.org/article.pl?sid=08/12/22/0830205">story on the front page of use.perl</a> a couple of days ago.</p>

<p>What's new (I think) is where you can find the press release. It's on <a href="http://www.prweb.com/">PRWeb</a>. For those who don't know, PRWeb is the best-known press release distribution service. The TPF Git press release will now be arriving in the inbox of hundreds of editors and other interested parties who have subscribed to technology news. And that, of course, increases the chance that the story will be published in the tech press and that people outside of the echo chamber will read it.</p>

<p>When the Git news broke a couple of days ago, we were discussing it the london.pm IRC channel. <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/acme">acme</a> had published the press release in the usual Perl news channels, but someone suggested that as we had a press release, it would be nice to get it out through the standard press release channels.</p>

<p>It turned out that <a href="http://davehodg.blogspot.com/2008/12/perl-foundation-migrates-perl-5.html">Dave Hodgkinson</a> had a) a PRWeb login, b) half an hour to spare to register the press release and c) the $80 it costs to use the service.</p>

<p>I have no idea how successful this will be, but it seems to me that if the Perl community has interesting news like this, then it's worth spending the occasional $80 to get that news out on the wires.</p>

<p>It's got to be worth a try. Thanks to Dave for his efforts.</p>

<p>Thanks for this update and double thanks to Dave Hodgkinson!  Anything we can do for good PR is worth the effort.</p>

<p>I think that is money well spent.</p>

Absolutely, i think this kind of thing should be done somewhat frequently, and that the TPF should be using it when appropriate.
