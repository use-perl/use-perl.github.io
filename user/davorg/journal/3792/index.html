<p><p>It seems to me that all this <i>Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus</i> crap is used by people who want an excuse for being sexist in a "politically correct" manner.<p>
<p>I'm going to write a book called <i>Men are from Earth, Women are from Earth - Deal With It</i>.</p></p>

<h2>Yes indeed.</h2>

My favourite comment on the whole <i>Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus</i> is the almost kneejerk <i>And Pop-psychologists are from Uranus</i>



<h2>I thought that was...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/pne/">pne</a> on 2002-03-27T11:20:52</h3>
... <i>Man are from Macs, Women are from VMS</i>?



<h2>it simply reinforces stereotypes</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/hfb/">hfb</a> on 2002-03-27T15:48:20</h3>
<p>that are already there. Sometimes it is interesting to watch a group of children playing and how the adults interact with them when they ask the girls to pick-up the toys and the boys get to make more mess. I think people do this totally subconsciously and pass it to generation after generation.</p>

<p>The book is merely the summation of a life long process of stereotype reinforcement. Don't get pissed at the book, we adults are pretty much a lost cause, get pissed at people who perpetuate it through their children.</p>



<h2>Mixed Feelings</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/chromatic/">chromatic</a> on 2002-03-27T15:48:29</h3>
That's a <em>terrible</em> name for <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/davorg/journal/2953" title="perl.org">your next book</a perl.org>, at least from a descriptive standpoint.
<p>
It might sell, though...</p>



<h2>Confession... I liked it.</h2>

I am far from a fan of pop psychology books, but someone gave this book to us, so I read it on a slow book day. It had two pieces of advice that may not apply generally, but have certainly smoothed the communications in my (already pretty smooth) relationship:<p><ul> <li>Men tend to talk about problems in an attempt to find a solution; women often just want to talk about them. This leads to a disconnect in which the man keep proposing solutions, when the woman just wants a sympathetic ear.</li> <li>"Cave time". When a man is coping with stress by retreating to his den, watching a Dr Who marathon, curling up with a book or whatever, leave him be. He doesn't want to talk about the problem at this point, and  interrupting him will generally cause him to retreat further and longer.</li> </ul> <p> The book certainly overgeneralizes, and I make no claims that it is applicable for anyone else, but those two insights improved my marriage by 7.3%.</p><p>

Yup, I haven't read the Mars/Venus book but I knew the first point already.  It's really helped me understand why my wife would come to me with a problem and leave even more frustrated and upset.  She wanted to vent whereas I thought she wanted a solution.  Now I listen and nod and "oh, that must be awful" and only try once to help her with a solution (just in case the cosmos is in alignment and she actually wants help for once<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<p>

Deborah Tanner has a big line of pop psych books, but as far as I could tell she keeps saying the same thing again and again.  I couldn't finish the first I tried, and none of the others I've seen in the bookstore have looked any better.</p><p>
