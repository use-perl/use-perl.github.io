<div class="span8">
<p><p>I'm a bit of a Luddite. I don't have ADSL yet. I'm still using an ISDN dial-up that I've had for about five years. But we're moving the study to a different room so this is the ideal opportunity to drag my connectivity into the 21st century.</p>
<p>Now the problem with this is that BT can't convert an ISDN line to ADSL. It needs to be converted to an analogue line first (which, of course, you are charged for).</p>
<p>So I contact my ISP (Demon) and ask them about getting ADSL. They tell me that I need to contact BT first to get my line converted back to analogue. They also tell me that once I place my order with them, it will take 8-10 working days for the ADSL to be turned on.</p>
<p>I call BT and order the conversion. They say that they can come and do it on Friday.</p>
<p>Then I decide to get clever. After the ISDN is converted to analogue and before the ADSL is installed, I'll be back on a 56k modem link (assuming I can find an old modem somewhere). This painful experience could last as long as two weeks. I therefore decide to place my ADSL order with Demon today in order to minimise the time between the two conversions.</p>
<p>This afternoon I get an email back from Demon. They've tested my line and have found that it isn't an anologue line. They say that they cant' proceed with my order until I've had the line converted to analogue.</p>
<p>So it looks like I can't avoid up to two weeks on a 56k dial-up connection. I'm sure it'll all be lovely once it's finished, but I'm really not looking forward to time at 1997 connection speeds.</p></p>

Think of it as a pilgrimage.  You must suffer for a short while to experience great rewards afterwards!

Having used Demon ADSL for 2 or 3 years I am pretty sure that Zen is actually more reliable.
Demon seem not to understand that a few hours downtime for maintenance is not acceptable.

As an ex-demon employee I'm sure I couldn't possibly comment.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

serves you right for not switching to Zen.
