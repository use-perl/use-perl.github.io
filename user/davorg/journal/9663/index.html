<div class="span8">
<p><p>I've been dabbling with overload.pm over the last week or so. I've never really looked at it in much depth before, but I'm scheduled to give a talk on to <a href="http://london.pm.org/">london.pm</a> next month and that's always a good excuse to learn something new.</p>
<p>I was looking for a good (but slightly unusual) example for the constant overloading feature of overload.pm when I came up with the concept of Time::Period.</p>
<p>Basically, it allows you to do date calculations in a pretty easy to understand way. You can simply do something like this:</p>
<pre>
use Time::Period ':constants';

$one_month = '1m';
$now = time;
$then = $now + $one_month;
print scalar localtime $then;
</pre>
Of course you can make that simpler with code like:
<pre>
$wake = time + '1y + 1d'; # a year and a day
print "The princess will wake up at ",
  scalar localtime $wake;
</pre>
<p>It's on its way to CPAN, but in the meantime you can get it from <a href="http://dave.org.uk/modules/">http://dave.org.uk/modules/</a>.</p>
<p>Oh, and if <a href="/user/Trelane/">Trelane</a> is reading... that's the topic for my talk at the next tech meet.</p></p>

Check out Time::Piece, which ships with Time::Seconds. Also check out Date::ICal, which ships with Date::ICal::Duration.<br> <br>All achieve the same thing.

<h3><a href="/user/vek/">vek</a> on 2002-12-30T01:57:32</h3>
I seem to recall that both <code>Date::Calc</code> and <code>Date::Manip</code> might also do the same thing.  Could be wrong though as it's been a while since I've looked...



<h2>Re:Wheel, reinvented</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/davorg/">davorg</a> on 2002-12-30T06:46:19</h3>
<p>Oh, I know about Time::Seconds (I'm a big advocate of using Time::Piece). This isn't my attempt to replace it, just something that I was playing around with that I thought I'd share.</p>

<p>There are differences between the two module tho'. Time::Seconds uses exported symbolic constansts where Time::Period uses objects. Also adding one year or one month to a date using Time::Seconds will add a fixed number of seconds whereas Time::Period will really add one year or one month.</p>

<p>Didn't know about Date::ICal::Duration, I'll check it out.</p>

Yep, this is a rather fundamental flaw in Time::Seconds (though there will always be issues with adding real durations too - like what to do adding a month at March 31st). I have been thinking seriously about re-writing Time::Piece entirely in terms of Date::ICal to try and fix this flaw.

<h2>1m</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/bart/">bart</a> on 2002-12-29T23:33:31</h3>
Is that one month, or one minute?



<blockquote>

<h2>Re:1m</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/davorg/">davorg</a> on 2002-12-30T06:49:47</h3>
<p>Yeah, it's really unhelpful that "month" and "minute" both beign with "m"<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:(</p>

<p>To get round that I arbitrarily decided that lower case letters represent units of time that are a day or bigger and uppercase letters represent untis of time that are smaller than a day. Another way of putting it is that lower case letters represent dates and upper case letters represent times.</p>

<p>So '1m' is one month. '1M' is one minute.</p>

Cool, now I don't have to chase you about what you're talking about, only how long.
<p>
Niggles on the module:
</p><ul>
<li> <code>print Time::Period-&gt;new("1y") - Time::Period-&gt;new("1S")</code> returns <code>"1y, 1S"</code> which is obviously wrong.</li>
<li> <code>print Time::Duration-&gt;new("24H")*2</code> does not DWIM, it complains about <code>*</code>, but I see that's on your TODO</li>
<li>I can't understand what the codes doing very well, you've not written a single comment<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)</li>
</ul>

<p>Addition is the only operation that is currently documented. Therefore it's the only one you should expect to work as documented<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>
