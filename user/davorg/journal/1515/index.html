<div class="span8">
<p><p>Ever since I've had a mobile (er... "cellular") phone, I've been on the <a href="http://www.orange.co.uk">Orange</a> network. I know I had a bit of a <a href="http://use.perl.org/journal.pl?op=display&uid=18&id=1171">rant</a> about their customer service recently, but I'm hoping that's just a blip and I'm loathe to leave them because of the cool technologies that they give their customers.</p>
<p>A good example of this is <a href="http://www.wildfire.com">Wildfire</a> the <i>virtual personal assistant</i>. OK, so basically it's a voice activated voicemail system, but it's a lot of fun to play with. You can pick up messages and return calls all without using the phone keypad.</p>
<p>And there are easter eggs too. Try asking her (yes, of course it has a woman's voice) to "do me a favour" and she'll ask "what kind of favour?" in a very distracting tone of voice.</p>
<p>I've been using Wildfire for a couple of years, but yesterday I found out about Wildfire Fax. I get a fax number and any faxes that are sent to that number are stored by Wildfire and I'm send a message. When I want to pick up the fax, I call Wildfire and tell her the number of the fax machine that I want the fax delivered to. It's great if you never know where you'll be from one week to the next. It means that I can publish one fax number to contact me and pick up the faxes anywhere.</p>
<p>Currently on heavy rotation in my CD player is <a href="http://www.thecure.com">The Cure</a>'s new <a href="http://www.curehits.com">Greatest Hits</a> album. Sure I've already got most of them on the original albums, but it's nice to have them all together and besides, there's an extra CD in the early pressings that has new "unplugged" versions of many of the songs. So I'm happily bouncing around the living room listening to "Boys Don't Cry", "Let's Go To Bed" and "Inbetween Days" and making like it's the 80s all over again.</p>
<p>Ah... memories.</p></p>

Got to agree with you there davorg.  In fact my copy of 'The Cure In Orange' is almost worn out from all the play it has had over the years, I should really see if I can get a copy of that bad dog on DVD hmmm.  So what's (in your opinion) their best album then?  "The Head On The Door" is the one that always seems to make it onto my stereo - 'Push' and 'Sinking' are two of my personal fav's.

<p>Depends on my mood. One of "Seventeen Seconds", "Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me" or "Disintergration".</p>

Case you haven't guessed, The Cure are one of my all time favorite bands and I could talk about them all night - even in <b>perl</b> journals it seems (grin).  Actually had the pleasure of meeting Mr Gallop on the tube after a Nitzer Ebb concert of all things - again, back in the day.  Anyhoo, back to the original reason for posting - the <b>Wish</b> album:    <b>High</b> - fantastic song.  <b>Wendy Time</b> not quite as good as their live version (those of you who are Cure fans and are lucky enough to have a copy of their "the cure play out" video will understand what I mean) and speaking of "the cure play out" - why oh why is "The Big Hand" not on the bloody <b>wish</b> album - it's only one of their best songs -*sigh*

Hmm, 'Seventeen Seconds' - forgot about that one.  The version of 'Play For Today' from 'The Cure In Orange' tape is amazing.  I also always get a kick out of Simon's bass playing at the end of 'live' versions of 'A Forest', saw them at Wembley back in the day - sends a shiver down the ol' spine it does!
