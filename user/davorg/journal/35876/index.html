<div class="span8">
<p><p>A couple of years ago I started building feed aggregation sites (aka "planets"[1]) using <a href="http://plagger.org/">Plagger</a>. Once you've installed Plagger, it's pretty simple to configure new planets.</p>

<p>Notice I say "once you've installed Plagger". Plagger is one of those CPAN modules which installs about half of CPAN. The <a href="http://cpandeps.cantrell.org.uk/?module=Plagger;perl=latest">CPAN dependencies page</a> currently gives you a 26% chance of successfully installing Plagger.</p>

<p>The reason for that is clear. Plagger is an incredibly powerful tool. It is an all-purpose tool for slicing and dicing web feeds. It also includes special-case plugins for creating web feeds for many sources that don't currently publish them.</p>

<p>So the net result is that Plagger is large and often hard to install. And most people (or, at least, I) don't use a fraction of its power. I wish I didn't have to install all of Plagger's dependencies in order to just grab a few feeds and combine them into a planet site. Perhaps the Plagger team needs to look at breaking up the distribution into smaller parts that do less.</p>

<p>[<b>Update:</b> <a href="http://use.perl.org/comments.pl?sid=38907&cid=61588">Miyagawa  points out</a> that the vast majority of Plagger's dependencies are optional, so I'm overstating the case here. Sorry about that.]</p>

<p>Recently I moved a lot of my sites to a new server. And I really didn't want to go through the pain of installing Plagger. Therefore all of my planets have been dead for a couple of months. And that has been bothering me. But a couple of days ago (prompted by <a href="http://husk.org/blog/arch/feeding_the_daemons.html">something that Paul Mison wrote</a>) I decided to do something about it.</p>

<p>I a few hours of spare time I wrote <a href="http://svn.mag-sol.com/perlanet/">Perlanet</a>[2]. It doesn't do anything at all complex. It reads data from a YAML file, uses <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/XML-Feed/">XML::Feed</a> to parse the feeds and then the <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Template-Toolkit/">Template Toolkit</a> to generate the web page (oh, and XML::Feed again to generate the combined feed).</p>

<p>It's very simple. And it's new, so there may well be bugs. But it's there if you find it useful. It's already powering a revived <a href="http://davorg.theplanetarium.org/">planet davorg</a>. My other planets should come back to life over the next few days.</p>

<p>I'm sure I'll be adding more features over the coming weeks, but the main point is to keep it simple.</p>

<p>[1] After <a href="http://www.planetplanet.org/">Planet</a> the Python software that (as far as I know) first popularised this method of aggregating data.</p>
<p>[2] Yes, I know it's a terrible name. But it seemed obvious to me and now I can't shake it.</p></p>
