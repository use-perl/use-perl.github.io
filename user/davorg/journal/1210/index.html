<p><p>Another successful london.pm meeting last night. The
Three Cups seems to be a popular venue and having our own
private room is a great idea.</p>
<p>The big news last night was that the london.pm t-shirts
are ready. There are five to choose from, each in a strictly
limited run of 50. They all have a large "Programming
Republic of London" logo on the back and one of a series
of small "fictional" PM group logos on the front. I'm
currently wearing my Sunnydale.pm shirt, but we also have
Rivendell.pm, Tatooine.pm, ZZ9PluralZAlpha.pm[1] and Anhk-Morpork.pm (the last is for those strange people who can't see that Terry Pratchett is an unfunny, fifth-rate Douglas Adams wannabe).</p>
<p>As I said, they are limited edition. We'll be selling
them to london.pm members first and if there are any left
over, we'll let other people buy them. The profits will
go to funding our continued sponsorship of a
<a href="http://london.pm.org/about/camel.html">camel</a>
at London Zoo.</p>
<p>I heard this morning that NMS has been approved as a
SourceForge project. I'll upload the relevant pages over
the weekend and make an announcement on 
<a href="http://use.perl.org">use Perl</a> early next
week.</p>

<p>[1] Weird to think that when this was planned, Douglas
Adams was still alive :(</p>

..tshirts are blue.  And I like blue.
<p>
Davorg forgot to mention that all the shirts are different colours too.
</p><p>
And who says <a href="http://sunnydale.pm.org/" title="pm.org">Sunnydale.pm</a pm.org> is fictional.

<p>Save one of the Ankh-Morpork shirts for his Self-appointed OOK-ness<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) Pratchett's latest book, <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/057506885X/" title="amazon.co.uk"> <i>The Last Hero</i> </a amazon.co.uk> is absolutely brilliant.</p>
