<p><p>I didn't write anything whilst I was in Amsterdam for
<a href="http://www.yapc.org/Europe/">YAPC::Europe</a>,
but a huge number of people did. I'd only be repeating 
what they said. I'd just like to add my thanks to the
organisers for proving that it is possible to have a 
smooth-running Perl conference in Europe.</p>

<p>London.pm has gone a bit weird. I think we're a victim
of our own success. There are too many people on the
mailing list for it to work as the kind of chatty mailing
list that it was. As usual, 2shortplanks has
<a href="http://use.perl.org/journal.pl?op=display&uid=968&id=639">summed it up very well</a>. I'm
not sure what to do about it. As he points out, it's a 
people problem, not a technology problem. Have to confess
that my first instinct is just to remove myself from
london.pm completely and let them get on with it. Maybe
I'll unsubscribe during my forthcoming trip to Scotland
and see how much I miss it. I wonder how they'd go about
appointing a new leader if I went.</p>

<p>Randal's in town today and is coming along to a 
london.pm meeting tonight (after a trip to the real Stonehenge during the day). Which is nice.</p>
