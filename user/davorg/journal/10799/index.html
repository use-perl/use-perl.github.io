<p><p><a href="http://www.guardian.com/"><i>The Guardian</i></a> is running a front page story saying that David Blunkett will soon announce that he has dramatically cut the list of new organisations that are to gain access to RIPE data.</p>
<blockquote><i>David Blunkett, the home secretary, has bowed to intense public concern over the privacy of electronic communications and radically redrawn plans to give a host of state agencies and local authorities the power to access telephone, internet and email records.</i></blockquote>
<blockquote><i>A consultation paper to be released by the Home Office within the next fortnight - the details of which have been leaked to the Guardian - will limit the number of agencies to be handed automatic access to private communications data, alongside a series of new concessions designed to defuse fears that the government was attempting to undermine the right to privacy. </i></blockquote>

<h2>Total UK Information Awareness</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/inkdroid/">inkdroid</a> on 2003-02-26T14:20:52</h3>
It's interesting the UK and the US are both trampling on privacy rights in their <a href="http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?va=Sisyphian" title="m-w.com">Sisyphean</a m-w.com> effort to make the world safe from terrorists. In the US we have the <a href="http://www.darpa.mil/iao/TIASystems.htm" title="darpa.mil">Information Awareness Office</a darpa.mil> which is attempting to integrate data from commercial and government sources into a huge database for tracking people's behavior. Why can't DARPA continue to do interesting things like building the Internet? While the logistics of building such a database are fascinating to me, and I can definitely see that the information could be useful, I really think the potential for harm far outweighs the good it could do. We already know we've got corrupt FBI and CIA agents with <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/10/25/60minutes/main526954.shtml" title="cbsnews.com">problems </a cbsnews.com> of their own...what would they do with this information? Kudos to the UK for reigning in the access to this information...here in the US things seem to be getting <a href="http://www.eff.org/Censorship/Terrorism_militias/son-of-patriot.php" title="eff.org">worse</a eff.org>.
