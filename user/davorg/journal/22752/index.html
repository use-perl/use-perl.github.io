<div class="span8">
<p><p>Xah Lee has been known in the Perl community for some time for his <a href="http://xahlee.org/UnixResource_dir/perlr.html">irrational hatred of Perl</a>.</p>

<p>Last week he <a href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/comp.lang.perl.misc/browse_thread/thread/30a9aa7aacddb675">announced</a> his new Perl/Python mailing list. The idea is that each day he'd post a piece of Python code and the equilvalent piece of Perl code. He is posting them to his mailing list <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/perl-python/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Except, of course, the flaw in this plan is that as he dislikes Perl so much, the Perl he posts isn't particularly good. There's been <a href="http://groups-beta.google.com/groups?q=group:comp.lang.perl.misc+insubject:[perl-python]+author:%22xah+lee%22&scoring=d">some discussion</a> of this on comp.lang.perl.misc (where he is helpfully cross-posting his examples), but there's no evidence that he actually reads the replies to his messages.</p>

<p>So yesterday I spent half an hour pointing out some of the worst problems in his Perl in postings to his mailing list - they're still there in the <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/perl-python/messages">message archive</a>. But when I posted another message later in the day it was bounced back as the list options had been changed so that only the moderator could post.</p>

<p>I don't really mind people posting bad Perl on the internet (although, obviously, I'd really rather that they didn't) but it's pretty cowardly not to let anyone else comment on it.</p></p>

I don't remember much.<p>But I remember that Xah Lee is that dick from the <a href="http://bumppo.net/lists/macperl/1998/07/msg00304.html" title="bumppo.net">MacPerl list who wouldn't wrap his lines</a bumppo.net>.
</p><p>He's a low-grade kook.</p>

Yes, he wrote a long <a href="http://www.xahlee.org/UnixResource_dir/writ/truncate_line.html" title="xahlee.org">dissertation</a xahlee.org> about this, complaining about I and tchrist complaining about him.  Incredible.<br> <br>He also wrote a <a href="http://www.xahlee.org/UnixResource_dir/perlr.html" title="xahlee.org">rant about Perl</a xahlee.org>, in which he also invoked my name.  He's funny.

Oh, and I wrote very few emails to Xah, and <a href="http://bumppo.net/lists/macperl/1999/01/msg00307.html" title="bumppo.net">this</a bumppo.net> was most of the extent of it, where I asked him to stop insulting people who used Unix, and corrected him on some of his <a href="http://bumppo.net/lists/macperl/1999/01/msg00306.html" title="bumppo.net">errors</a bumppo.net>.<br> <br>I recommend, davorg, you remind him of his promise: "When one day Mac OS is unix-like, then I'll take an axe and chop my head in two."<br>

Noticed this entry a bit late, but I (without doubt with some others helping) had his hosting provider kick him out: <a href="http://xahlee.org/Periodic_dosage_dir/t2/harassment.html" title="xahlee.org">http://xahlee.org/Periodic_dosage_dir/t2/harassment.html</a xahlee.org>

He has a profile on Orkut.  You can leave a nasty scrap for him there.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)

XAH LEE is Chinese for "Coward who hates perl".



<h2>Lee's other problem</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/drhyde/">drhyde</a> on 2005-01-18T10:38:16</h3>
Never mind his shocking perl, what about his butchering of perhaps the most well known poetic form in the English language?

<p>I refer, of course, to the Limerick.  On his web site he has this:</p><blockquote><div> <tt>I know a monger named Wall<br>who always peddles his Perl<br>if he had any grasp<br>he would just LISP<br>Wall's nothing but a troll<br>&nbsp; --Xah Lee, 2000-02</tt> </div></blockquote> <p>There's lots of problems here.  First of all, Wall, Perl and troll don't rhyme.  Nor do grap and LISP.  And then there's the metre - there's one missing syllable in the first line, one in the second, one in the fourth, and one or two in the fifth.</p>

There's a more serious problem.
<p>
Years ago, at dinner with a bunch of mongers, the subject turned to Lisp.  Larry said something like (I paraphrase):
</p><blockquote><div> <i>
Common Lisp is a great language.  Except for the lack of syntax.
</i> </div></blockquote>
So much for Larry just using Lisp if only he were smart enough.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)
