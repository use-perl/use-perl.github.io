<p><p>[Warning: no religious content]</p>
<p>It looks to me as tho' 
<i><a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/nms-cgi/">nms</a></i> is going pretty well.
We've got half a dozen or so people registered as developers
on the project and the <a href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/nms-cgi-devel">developers mailing list</a> is pretty busy.</p>
<p>However the <a href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/mailman/listinfo/nms-cgi-support">support mail list</a> is very quiet. This means one of two things. Either a) our scripts are so easy to install and use that no-one needs support or b) no-one is using them yet. I suspect that option b is more likely.</p>
<p>So the problem seems to be that whilst we're doing all this great work, very few people actually know about it. Which means that we need better marketing. I'm therefore asking all of you wonderful people out there in use.perl-land to help us. If anyone knows of a way to promote the use of <i>nms</i> over MSA then please either a) just do it or b) tell <a href="mailto:dave@dave.org.uk">me</a> about it. For years the Perl community has been looking for a decent replacement for MSA, now that we have one it would be a shame if it remained a well-kept secret.</p>

<p>Emailed CMP recently to ask why I'd only received one copy of <i>SysAdmin</i>. It seems that my subscription ran out after that copy. This seems a little strange to me as I had an <a href="http://www.samag.com/documents/s=1131/sam05040011/">article</a> in TPJ #20 and one of the perks of getting an article in the magazine was supposed to be a two-year extension to my subscription. I'll chase them up on it and see if I can find out what happened.</p>
<p>I also suggested that they let Perl people subscribe to only the TPJ issues of <i>SysAdmin</i> (one a quarter) as from what I've seen the other content of the magazine is of limited interest to me. They didn't seem keen on the idea, but if other people suggested the same thing, they might reconsider.</p>
<p>And finally, the sandwich shop downstairs from the office has started to sell a brie and parma ham on ciabatta sandwich. Now my all-time favourite sandwich is bacon, brie and advocado on granary bread, but currently this comes a very close second.</p></p>

<h2>Google</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Matts/">Matts</a> on 2001-11-29T10:01:07</h3>
How about doing a google search for "Matt's Script Archive", and going through the list of sites one by one, emailing the administrator a polite form-ish letter talking about NMS, and why advertising MSA is bad?
<br>
<br>Oh, and I've email my ISP (clara.net) telling them to stop advertising MSA, but they've ignored me<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-(



<h2>TPJ</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/pudge/">pudge</a> on 2001-11-29T13:00:40</h3>
I had a column in at least 8 consecutive issues of TPJ before CMP bought it<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... which means *16 years* of subscriptions.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:D  Yet no subscription.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:( I e-mailed Amber, the editor, and it is apparently getting worked out.

<h2>Brie and parma ham on ciabatta</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ziggy/">ziggy</a> on 2001-11-29T14:12:59</h3>
Sounds yummy.  Not sure if that tops really excellent corned beef on rye (a reasonable sandwich, not the half-cow they serve at the Carnegie Deli), or a simple smoked salmon (or gravlax) on fresh pumpernickel.
<p>
(That's <b> <i>real</i> </b> smoked salmon.  Like they get in Alaska and British Columbia.)</p>

Is corned beef the same as salt beef? Served piping hot with plenty of mustard/horseradish? If so, Mmmm... must visit the Nosherie again soon.
<br>
<br>That Alaskan smoked salmon was good wasn't it? Back in the days before farmed salmon, when it still cost an arm and a leg, Scottish smoked salmon was up there with the best in the world. Probably still is if you can find someone who sources wild salmon...
<br>
<br>As for 'brie and parma ham', I'd have to go with fresh buffalo mozarella and parma ham on ciabatta with a light sprinkling of good fruity olive oil and some fresh basil and maybe a few slices of perfectly ripe tomato. Heaven.

I've been thinking about this most of the afternoon, and I'm pretty damn sure that the salmon on the boat was Atlantic Pink salmon (as in the "flown in from Maine" kind).  I remember asking the steward if they had any kind of wild salmon, and he was befuddled.  There *may* have been some sockeye salmon one night, in which case that was reasonably local (Sockeye is only found in Alaska/BC waters).
<p>
The salmon on the land, however, was quite tasty.  I'm still savoring the products from the <a href="http://www.takusmokeries.com/" title="takusmokeries.com">Taku Smokehouse</a takusmokeries.com>.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)  Some of the smokehouses are pretty hit or miss, though.  We got some salmon from the Cedar smokehouse in Ketchikan, and I was not too impressed.
My favorite remains <a href="http://www.granvilleislandsmokery.com/" title="granvillei...mokery.com">Granville Island Smokery</a granvillei...mokery.com>.</p>

I did a search on google for nms and came up with (among other things) the National Museum of Scotland.

Perhaps if nms isn't too well known, a less well-used acronym can be found?</p>
