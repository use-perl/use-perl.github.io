<p><p>It seems that my trusty Palm Vx has died. It's a massive coincidence because it was only this lunchtime that I was talking about getting a replacement and now it's given up the ghost completely. I can't even do a hard reset. It just gets to the "Palm Computing Platform" logo and just hangs there.</p>

<p>But in a few days time I shall be in Singapore. And I hear that electronics are cheap there. So I shall probably look at buying a replacement out there.</p>

<p>Does anyone have any recommendations? What do you use? What would you buy? What's going to sync best with a Linux desktop?</p></p>

<h2>I can imagine you're missing it already ...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/neophyte/">neophyte</a> on 2002-10-10T07:07:25</h3>
my Zaurus is in repair at the moment, I will get it back. But still I miss it (mainly for the data on the cf card, as I don't have a card reader yet).
<br> <br>
I never had a Palm, so I can't say much about both of them. The Zaurus has one advantage though: it runs Perl. As Sharp desingned the Zaurus for use with Win I can imagine that setting up synchronizing won't be as easy with Linux as it is with Win, but there are some progs and scripts that are supposed to do that. It is supposed to work.
<br>
Hey, there even is KOrganizer for embedded Linux.
<br> <br>But honestly, if it didn't have two slots (1 cf and 1 sd) I'd probably taken something else - I wanted the Handera before I knew the Zaurus would come.



<h2>Visor Edge</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/2shortplanks/">2shortplanks</a> on 2002-10-10T09:01:08</h3>
I've just bought a Visor Edge.  Yes, I know it's old tech...but that's the point.<br/><br/>The advantages of a Visor Edge are:<br/><br/><ul>
 <li>Cheap!  Yes, they're currently a hundred quid from Carphone Warehouse (end of line.)  This means when I break it/lose it/wash it etc I won't be overly heartbroken.</li>
 <li>Tiny! Fits in my pocket.  Unlike certain windows based platforms I might mention.  It <em>has</em> to fit in my pocket...I'm not going to carry it around with me in my bag...If I do that I might as well carry my ultra-light laptop.</li>
 <li>Stupid long battery life.  I mean, I've never got the thing down to 3/4 power yet, even after four days of not charging the thing and using it to read books in the dark.</li>
 <li>Palm compatible.  It's what you're used to.  It's what I was used to.  I knew it would do what I want and nothing more, and nothing less.  Does this make me a luddite?</li>
 <li>USB - transfer things to your desktop much much quicker than with a serial Palm.</li>
 <li>Linux compatible.  Support for the edge is mature.  It just works(tm) with coldsync (or pilot-xfer) or whatever.  I've even had the things syncing with gcalender before.</li>
</ul>
