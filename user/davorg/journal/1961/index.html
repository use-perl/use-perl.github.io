<p><p>I, of course, use Linux for most of my day-to-day 
computing, but Gill still likes to use Windows. This works
fine. She runs Windows on a laptop and connects to the 

internet via a Linux gateway box on the home network.</p>
<p>Currently Gill's studying for a PhD. This involves lots
or reading books and then condensing what she's read into
notes that she writes in Word files. She's three months into
the course and has about 2.5 Mb of data. Being more cautious
than me, she's been asking me for some time to sort out a
way to back up her data - she doesn't to have to retype all
of those notes if anything happens to the laptop.</p>
<p>So, over the weekend, I installed Samba on one of the 
Linux boxes and set up a shared directory that she can see
from the Windows box. Now, whenever she wants to backup her
data she can just drag and drop the latest files into the
backup directory.</p>
<p>Now, one of the things that I had to do was to switch on
"profiles" on the Windows box[1]. This means that you know
have to log on to Windows and every user that logs on gets
their own desktop to configure to their liking.</p>
<p>I explain this to Gill and she goes off to try it all 
out whilst I start cooking. Thirty seconds later, there's
a shout from upstairs, "Where have all my files gone?".
I run upstairs to find that the PhD folder she had on her
desktop is no longer there. I start to explore a few 
likely areas on the disk but to no avail. I start to panic
slightly - whichh doesn't improve my problem resolution
skills. I'm sure that I didn't delete anything, but maybe
I did it by accident. This looks nasty.</p>
<p>Eventually, I work it out. As Gill is now logged on as
herself, she sees <i>her</i> desktop, not the default user
one that she saw before. Her files are still there, but
on a <i>different</i> desktop. It's simply a case of
finding where Windows has hidden the old desktop files and
moving them to the new desktop directory. Everyone is
happy. And the backup facilty works.</p>
<p>But I thought I was in <i>serious</i> trouble for a
while there :-/</p>

<p>[1] Well, maybe I didn't <i>have</i> to do it, but it 
certainly seemed the simplest way to set up Samba.</p></p>
