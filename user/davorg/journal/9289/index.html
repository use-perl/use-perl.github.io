<p><p>It would seem that the employment market is picking up a little in the UK. This is based on purely ancedotal evidence. When I was out of work earlier this year it took me almost five months to find something and I was forced to give up freelancing and take a permanent job. This time it's take less than a month and I've found a six month contract.</p>
<p>I start working for <a href="http://www.iii.co.uk/">AMPLE</a> next week.</p>

<p>One small point. They all wear suits there. I can't remember the last time I wore a suit at work.</p></p>

<h2>Good News</h2>

Good News<br>
Hope that wearing that suit isn't too bad.  Can we have a photo to prove that it really happened?<br>
Cheers<br>

I wish the wave would reach Brum. There are currently 2 Oracle DBA (knowledge of Perl would be advantageous) positions that have been recycled for the last month and half. Then that's it<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:(
<p>
Went for an interview the other day, and even they are planning to move to Cold Fusion or Java. I get the impression that corporate culture is winning the day again.
</p><p>
I'll have to start wearing my <a href="http://www.kmfms.com/" title="kmfms.com">KMFMS</a kmfms.com> t-shirt a bit more<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)</p>

It has also been a while since I wore a suit at work.
<p>
I like Paul Smith and Romeo Gigli and if I were a bit thinner, Dolce&amp;Gabbana.
