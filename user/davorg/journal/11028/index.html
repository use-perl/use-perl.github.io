<p><p>Excellent london.pm tech meet last night. Lots (one might even say "too many") of really interesting talks.</p>
<p>I was particularly interested in the three talks about RDF and FOAF. This is an area that I really want to explore in more detail. I've just been looking for an interesting project to try it out on. Celia talked about how the BBC have used FOAF files to model data for the <i><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/">Eastenders</a></i> web site and I have this crazy idea that I should do something similar for <i>Buffy</i>.</p></p>

<h2>Too many talks</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/2shortplanks/">2shortplanks</a> on 2003-03-14T10:27:52</h3>
I agree.  There were too many.
<p>
Actually, we wouldn't have been so bad if I hadn't scheduled in Schwern to speak at the last minute.  Note to self:  In future leave an empty slot for last minute additions.
</p><p>
The big problem was that we had quite a few people practicing for that there XML conference and I wanted them to have a chance to talk, but I didn't want to have <em>all</em> the talks on XML.  Oh well, it all came out okay in the end.</p>



<h2>ST, not Buffy!</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Dom2/">Dom2</a> on 2003-03-14T10:30:02</h3>
Then you could call your talk "The Trouble With Triples".<nobr> <wbr></nobr><tt>:-)</tt>

<h2>Slides?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Odud/">Odud</a> on 2003-03-14T10:55:15</h3>
Are there slides? Are they being posted anywhere?

<h2>Re:Slides?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/davorg/">davorg</a> on 2003-03-14T11:28:52</h3>
<p>Links to the slides will no doubt appear <a href="http://london.pm.org/tech_talks/" title="pm.org">here</a pm.org> over the next few days.</p>

<h2>FOAF</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/inkdroid/">inkdroid</a> on 2003-03-14T13:56:00</h3>
This sounds interesting, and I'm looking forward to the slides. When I first heard of FOAF it seemed to me that there could be some application here at use.perl.org. Perhaps our FOAF files could be served up via a URL like:<br/><br/>http://use.perl.org/my/friends?uid=3294&amp;content_type=foaf<br/><br/>Not sure how useful this would be, but it would be interesting at least.
