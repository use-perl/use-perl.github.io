<div class="span8">
<p><p>Last night I went to a new Perl discussion group that has started up in London. It's organised by Nigel Wetters and and is based around the ideas on his <a href="http://www.patternsinperl.com/">Patterns in Perl</a> website.</p>
<p>The idea is that we can take the patterns from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0201633612">Design Patterns</a> (aka the "Gang of Four" book) and reimplement them in Perl.</p>
<p>About a dozen people turned up to a small pub in a very obscure part of London and there was a lot of interesting discussion. Some of it was even on design patterns :) A few general points were raised:</p>
<ul>
<li>Good programmers have probably invented the well-known patterns themselves, even if they don't know the names for them from the Gang of Four book.</li>
<li>It's useful to introduce people to the Gang of Four terminology as it aids communication.</li>
<li>Some of the patterns in the Gang of Four book solve problems that don't exist in Perl and therefore would either be trivial or unnecessary in a Perl application.</li>
<li>There are probably other patterns that are used in Perl programs that aren't in the Gang of Four book.</li>
</ul>
<p>We also took a closer look at the Factory pattern which the first one in the book and the first one that Nigel had written about on his web site.</p>
<p>All in all it was an interesting evening. Nigel's planning to hold them every week and I'll certainly get along to as many as I can.</p></p>

<h2>bad link</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jmm/">jmm</a> on 2002-01-10T14:57:58</h3>
The link www.patternsinperl doesn't work.  (Adding<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.com or<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.org doesn't fix it either.)
