<p>Looks like the <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/massagelondon/journal/">comment</a> <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/httpwww.massagelondo/journal/">spammers</a> have worked out how to automatically set up accounts on Slash sites.</p>

For somewhere like slashdot where they have a gazillion people accessing the site, most of which are belligerent fools.  All they need do is have a page on the site people who are feeling uppity can go visit that contains an iframe that's reloaded every few seconds by javascript that cycles through all the sites that have been comment spamming.  It'll slashdot the sites and then some, totally taking them off the net.



<h2>Thanks</h2>

I've banned those accounts and IP addresses, deleted the comments and journal entries, and -- though I don't think this was being done -- turned on captchas (images with letters to verify you're a human) for account creation to help prevent new account robo-creation.<br> <br>As always, thanks, and let me know if you see more of this.<br>

Unfortunately banning is getting harder. Some comment spammers are now using networks of compromised machines just like the e-mail spammers. Monday I had to deal with a comment spammer who had posted 64 comments from 58 different IP addresses all over the world, starting at 1 comment every 8 minutes and gradually accelerating until they were posting every 45 seconds.  Fortunately they went away within a few minutes after I deleted the comments and enabled moderation.
