<p><p><b>Things we tell ourselves aren't always true.</b></p>

<p>
    I fled <cite>Perlmonks.org</cite> towards the end of last year, as many
others have before me, and found myself trying out IRC for a time, specifically the
<cite>Freenode</cite> network and its <strong>#perl</strong> channel. What I
like about having an online chat open during long periods while I hack at some
project or other is the sense of life out there in the mental/spiritual sphere
that I am occupying. The sense that other symbolic analysts "out there" are
simultaneously engaged in similar pursuits, struggles and joys is an antidote
for me to tedium or fatigue, one that I have come to feel is beneficial. But
how far will one go to possess such a benefit? I recently had to ask myself
that question when reality came up in my face with the alarming force and
speed of a derailed train headed for a stone wall.

<p>
    <strong>#perl</strong> on <i>Freenode</i> typically has at least 500 users
listed as present in the channel. With that many users, there is bound to be a
large variety of people with different opinions to express, or so you'd think.
But the truth is that there are not so many different opinions being
expressed, and I think I know why. I don't have all the answers, but I have
some.

<p>
    Of late, at any given time, maybe 6 or so people might be actually
speaking. Most readers here will realize that having even 10% of 500 users
- 50 people - all talking at once is totally unmanagable in any sense. No
possible coherence can be made out of such a jumble of voices. So, it's a good
thing that so few people generally speak at any given time. And since there
are only so many <i>slices</i> of time - say 2 minute slices - in a 24 hour
period, in reality in any given day or week, only a fraction of the 500 users
are heard from. This poses a question I have never seen a (convincing) answer
for: <strong>what</strong> exactly are the 450-odd people that I never see
send anything to the channel, doing there? What are they getting out of it?
Finally I can only guess that they are getting a benefit similar to what I
described in my opening paragraph: briefly put, the chat keeps them company on
some level. Perhaps for some more than others, loneliness or a sense of being
disconnected from whatever people they have around them is a constant
condition.

<p>
    That's all been analyzed (probably to death) already in other places by
writers with more skill and insight than I possess. What I was enjoying about
<strong>#perl</strong> on <i>Freenode</i> was not merely the sensation of
having a conversation going on nearby, however, but also I enjoy being active
in the channel and discussing things with some of the participants. I don't
represent myself as a helpful guy. In fact, I've been very vocal about
<i>not</i> being there to help people with arbitrary requests for support of
some sort (I word it this way because it is clear that some people are there
with needs other than the supposed purpose of the channel - some want
hand-holding; some want an argument to participate in; some want scripts
written for them; etc) ... instead, I am vocally honest about the fact that I
am there to discuss things that I am interested in (and fortunately for me
that includes a lot of different areas); and if <strong>helping someone is a
by-product or side effect of my conversing with others</strong>, I am extra
happy.

<p><b>People like us</b></p>

<p>
    People who are "like us" (hackers, programmers, technologists) who blog or
do online journals have commented on a large number of occasions, that I have
seen, about how IRC (and related forms of online realtime conferencing) can
hurt their personal productivity, and how they had to make changes in their
habits about it. Some have had to give it up entirely, others have made
themselves allot only short spans in any given day to IRC. For myself, and I
am a very addictive type of personality, I felt that I had finally reached a
nice balance. I was doing IRC on <i>Freenode's</i> <strong>#perl</strong> with
a continual sense of awareness of how many minutes were being given to any one
conversation or topic or request for help from a user. That allowed me to feel
that the long-term prospects of being a positively contributing participant on
<strong>#perl</strong> were good. With that sense of balance, I offered to the
channel owner, my services as an IRC chanop. So for the last 3 months I've
been not only a regular participant but also someone charged with some
responsibility to provide for maintaining order and a modicum of peaceful
enjoyment for the users of the channel.

<p>
    A lot of past experience had prepared me, I felt, for this role. I had
been an active participant - sometimes a notoriously opinionated one - on
Perlmonk's <cite>chatterbox</cite> since joining the site shortly after its
beginning (since June 2000, to be precise). I'd spent plenty of time on IRC
before and during that time. My time using realtime online conferencing media
extends back to the days of CompuServe and its Forums.

<p>
    I am finally coming to the realization, however, that the negative aspects
of online chat "communities" extend beyond harm to personal productivity or
even to one's physical health (lack of sleep, neglect of healthy lifestyle
activities) or to one's family dynamics or social life. They seem to me to
foster a number of different kinds of passivity combined with a willingness to
submit to "groupthink" and a deadening of sensitivity to and even awareness of
the wider realms of human existence outside of a small subset of humanity that
programmer/computer geeks think of as "their type of people". And there is
another kind of damage that is being done as well.

<p>
    The <strong>#perl</strong> channel is perhaps one of the sicker
communities I have ever come across, and if the reader's experience is not
closely similar to mine, they may think I am either exaggerating or,
conversely, unaware of how bizarre some channel on <i>Network X</i> that
they have been in is. Rest assured that I am aware of <i>Network X</i>, and rest
assured that I am on the other hand, not exaggerating.

<p><b>Hypocrisy and self-delusion</b>

<p>
    A reader may well argue that online chat communities are simply a microcosm
of what is prevalent in the post-industrial civilization which we are part of.
And they would be right. What is strongly characteristic of
<strong>#perl</strong> and channels similar to it is, however, that active
participants rarely seem to achieve awareness of this. They clearly find it
most congenial to speak in world-weary tones of how stupid the larger
population is as a mass; of how idiotic the leaders of countries are, of what
a shame it is that the world is such a mess. They thereby apply a sheen of
superiority to themselves and each other as <i>special</i> ... a superior
breed, perhaps forced unfairly to exist in this world of doltish ignorant
cretins and liars with selfish motives. Trying to speak in positive, hopeful
terms about the world at large and what its destiny might be, is a surefire
way to make ones' self the immediate target of derision. That's pretty sick.
But the negativity does not stop there.

<p>
    I've written before in this Journal about groupthink and the fearsome
phenomenon of mob behavior, the selection of those "different" as scapegoats,
etc. The irony is that that people I meet online in such places as
<i>Perlmonks</i> or <strong>#perl</strong> on <i>Freenode</i> do not
understand to what degree they are part of a group and, over time, being
influenced in their attitudes and shaped in their outlook by that group. The
myth of staunch individualism and the sense that each is an entity unto
itself, with only a loose affiliation to the others that they spend (in some
cases) <i>hours</i> each day with, reigns over each participants'
understanding of themselves. This sense of solitary independence of thought
only disperses briefly when an <b>external threat</b> appears - typically
either an <cite>Internet/IRC troll</cite> or a person egregiously breaking the
rules of conduct of the channel in some unambiguous, unequivocal manner. At
those times, the hidden, latent herd instinct or pack dynamic or multicellular
organism reality becomes briefly revealed, and then goes back into hiding once
the "threat" or disturbance is removed. It boggles the mind to realize that
this collective delusion, this total disconnect between what people
<b>think</b> their conciousness is up to, in contrast to what is <b>really</b>
going on ... is repeated 10s of thousands of times over each and every day,
to one degree or another, on IRC networks and in other chatrooms across the
Internet. Day in, day out. 24/7/365, as we technogeeks like to say.

<p>
    But rather than rehash that topic, as pertinent as it might be to
<strong>#perl</strong> on <i>Freenode</i>, I am going to talk about how I
think that such online chat locations actually damage the future of Free
Software as a movement and an ideal, and how the hypocrisy of the typical
chatroom/channel participant is coming to be reflected in the continuing
narrow range of ethnicities and genders that comprise the "Open" Source
world as seen both online and at conferences and conventions. Next time.
