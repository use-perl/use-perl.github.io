<div class="span8">
<p><em>Watching the antics of stalkerazzi on VH1 TV recently, I came up
   with a fevered notion that seems nevertheless rather good to me.</em>

<p>The fan clubs for performers seem to be basically a mechanism by
   which people can get some kind of chance to feel like they are
   touching the lives of people they feel have touched them through
   their art. So why not give fans a way to make a real difference
   in the lives of the performers they are so madly fond of ...

<p>Fan clubs could set up a Net-based mechanism to accept anonymous
   donations. Maybe those would have to be handled through offshore
   bank accounts, etc. These donation -- $5, $15, $25 at a time --
   could be allowed to accumulate until a couple thousand dollars
   was available (more or less -- not having any contacts in the
   underworld, I have no idea really what people need for the kind
   of illegal services I'm proposing).

<p>The club then could arrange to contract (secretly) with a
   "security company" to stalk stalkerazzi. Wherever the celebrity
   performer goes, there are the stalkerazzi, and there are the
   operatives taking photos, recording sound, and noting license
   plates of these subhuman fungi. Then when background research
   has been done, the worst offending stalkerazzi is selected
   and made the target of a vicious, medically severe beating
   that puts them into the hospital for weeks and possibly costs
   them permanent loss of some manual dexterity, eyesight, or hearing.
   This encounter with the operatives executing the administration
   of corrective violence would of course take place outside the
   stalkerazzi's home, or a bar they frequent, or anywhere else
   and in any other circumstance where they can be confronted alone
   and the performer they've been stalking is miles and miles away.

<p>The professionalism of the "security company" is the weak link
   here, as far as I can see it. Unfortunately it seems that illegal
   drug addiction and other forms of mentally handicapping situation
   often go along with the professional vocation of being "muscle".
   But just one or two really professionalistic and careful outfits
   that could execute such a contract perfectly on several
   occasions might make a large part of the stalkerazzi problem
   "just go away".

<p>Sorry if you, the reader, experiences unpleasant nervous system
   reactions (shock) to reading this <b>purely conjectural</b>
   proposal. If you have, I'll ask you to remember that you'll be over
   it in about 5 minutes. Try now to imagine the shock of having
   strangers confront you, of having lenses thrust towards you, over
   and over again, day after day, week after week, month after month,
   at the most unexpected and private moments when your guard is down
   ... try to imagine what <b>that</b> might do to the general
   condition of your nervous system, and to your outlook on life.</p>
