<p><p><em>The scenario, in brief:</em>

<p>One has a removable media device (say, like a USB (thumb|key)drive); and one wants to
       carry a bunch of Perl modules around on it, mounting it to a workstation as
       needed, and including the path to the modules in <tt>@INC</tt> (via the
      <tt>$PERL5LIB</tt> mechanism). This could involve use on a UNIX workstation or
      an MS Windows one, for example; it does not matter.

<p>Installing modules to this (USB?) removable (thumb|key)drive in the normal manner
       involves setting a PREFIX= and possibly LIB= parameters for ExtUtils::MakeMaker
       -based module build-infrastructure supported modules, or the parallel means
      for a Module::Build -based one. Then you just go do the
                          <code>make ; make test ; make install</code>
      or Module::Build analog as you would for any module installation.  I guess
      for some readers this is going to sound like an exotic thing to envision,
      but for the author this is not. I've been doing things like this with the
      manual installation of modules for years. I understand all the mechanisms
      and gotchas involved, and IMHO the support for this in Perl is very good
      and the results I get are very satisfying.

<p><em>The Problem:</em>

<p>When the build host is UNIX (i.e. GNU/Linux) the make process will create man pages
       for all detected *.pm *.pl and *.pod files. This is "normal" for the architecture /  os type
      and I like and want the manpages to be installed to the file hierarchy on the removable
      media drive. However, the <em>filenames</em> of man files produced from the POD in modules are
      like <tt><b>Module::Kewl::Excelsior.pm3</b></tt> on a UNIX system. Note the double-colons
      (<b>::</b>).

<p>
      The filesystem of a USB
      (thumb|key)drive is (nearly ?) invariably FAT32 as shipped by the manufacturer (and for
      my purposes, for maximum portability, needs to be kept that way). A FAT-ish filesystem,
      having originated from MS DOS, <b>does not accept colons : as part of filenames</b>.
      They are (obviously) barred from the set of ascii characters allowed because of the
      special semantic meaning they have on an MS DOS-ish / Windows-ish system. The
      result is that the manpages cannot be written to the removable FAT/FAT32 media
      at  <tt>make install</tt> time, possibly generating error messages or possibly just
      failing silently (the error message will be the ubiquitous and vastly informative MS
      Windows error <tt>No such file or directory</tt>).

<p>I like manpages (or the moral equivalent like <tt>info</tt> pages). Manpages are goodness to me. They give me a feeling of reassurance
       that I have the proper up to date documentation (assuming the module dist maintainer
       is keeping the documentation in sync with the changes ;-) for the code I am
       using. Bare-bones Debian and Debian-based systems don't ship with a <i>perldoc</i>
       command (one is available as a separate Debian package), so that's an instance where having manpages built is
       substantially important to having the POD accessible to me as the user. This is about
       personal preference anyway.

<p><em>Possible solutions:</em>

<p>On Cygwin (<a href="http://www.cygwin.com">http://www.cygwin.com</a>), which is UNIX but lives within the special needs of the MS Win filesystem
       semantics WRT special characters and filenames (AUX, PRN, NUL, etc), the manpages
       are usable and are built. The EU::MM_Cygwin (<URL:http://cpan.uwinnipeg.ca/htdocs/ExtUtils-MakeMaker/ExtUtils/MM_Cygwin.pm.html>)  module overrides the default EU::MM method
       which generates <tt><b>make</b></tt> recipes to build manpages from module
       or script files; it provides a <b>.</b> (dot) in place of the <b>::</b> (double-colon)
       in creating the filenames for the man pages that will be copied into place when everything
       installed.

<p>A solution  like the one used by Cygwin(perl) is great and is what I think I want, but it
        requires one to make some change to the files included in the module distribution;
        either some hand-editing or some addition of files or both. Can anyone think of a way
        to achieve this manipulation of EU::MM (or M::B) operations that doesn't require
        that kind of a tedious manual operation for <b>each</b> module to be built/installed
        to the removable media drive? Or does anyone have a suggestion for a new method
        or parameter or functionality for EU::MM or M::B that would allow for changing the
        manpage filename namespace delimiter to be compatible with FAT filename semantics?

<p>I can envision for example a <code>$PERL_MM_USE_MANFILE_SEP=.</code> environ var
        that if present would trigger the desired overidding.

While not quite what you're talking about, 1 gig USB drives have come down in price enough that you could install minicpan on one and carry it around with you to install whatever module you want.  For activeperl, you can probably do the same for a ppm repository.
