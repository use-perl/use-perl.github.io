<p>There is a bug in perl that has been around for very long:<br/><br/><code><br/><br/>    sub f { $_[0] = 1; $_[0] = "a"; $_[0] = *FOO }
    my @a; f($a[0]);<br/><br/></code><br/><br/>It is consensus among the porters that fixing it in a proper way will require a new internal type: an lvalue-type that
is large enough to even hold a glob. Out of curiosity I tried to see whether I can possibly fix it. I now see an interesting
evolution in my attempts. <br/><br/>In the unfixed state, you get <code>Can't upgrade that kind of scalar...</code>. After the first stage, I was able to shift the error to <code>segmentation fault</code>. I have now improved it to <code>Out of memory!</code>. :-)<br/><br/></p>

Maybe you can getthe whole system to reboot?<br>(Yes, that has been known to be possible with few innocuous lines of Perl.)<br>

I haven't yet figured out how to do that. I guess that makes debugging a pleasure when - just before the usual backtrace would appear - your system reboots. Ah, what a bad luck.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br> <br>Meanwhile I was able to get rid of the out of memory thing (caused by a reidiculously high xlv_targlen value). After a while however you get to like such errors. Now I no longer get any errors but instead always get <code>undef</code> after assigning the glob. This is much harder to track down as I wont get any nice backtracks.<br> <br>Btw, Jarkko, you seem to have taken a break from the porters lately. Making holidays? How irresponsible that would be of you considering that others now have to do all the work!<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)

&gt; I haven't yet figured out how to do that.<br> <br>That reboot was very system specific, take a look at README.irix.<br> <br>&gt; Btw, Jarkko, you seem to have taken a break from the porters<br>&gt; lately. Making holidays?<br> <br>More like retirement.<br> <br>&gt; How irresponsible that would be of you considering that others now have to do all the work!<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)<br> <br>I have to let others to have fun, too.<br> <br>
