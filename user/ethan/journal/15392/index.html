<p>I am currently doing a lab at the <a href="http://www.sc.rwth-aachen.de/">Institute for Scientific Computing</a>. It was quite a coincidence that I ended up in this one. Essentially it was the only lab offered this term where I wouldn't have to do boring things such as UML or Java. Instead they promised that it could all be done in C which eventually outweighted my worries that I don't really have a clue about scientific computing (the labs deals with parallelizing numerical mathematics, such as calculating a matrix' eigenvalues).<br/><br/>It turns out that it's real fun. I now have access to an impressive SUN midframe with 96 CPUs. Furthermore, we are only six people overall. The best thing however is that I learnt about MPI. The message passing interface works equally well on a single-CPU machine.  Yesterday I compiled and installed <a href="http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/mpi/mpich/">MPICH</a> and played quite a bit with it. The amazing thing about it is that it can be used as a quick-n-dirty drop-in replacement for C<fork()>. Whenever I'd like to write a parallel link-checker, I could probably do it very easily this way. Whenever I want to increase the amount of parallelization, I can say C<mpirun -np 1000 program> and my program is distributed over a 1000 processes. MPICH takes care of creating and shutting down the processes properly. The only thing I can't do is changing the number of processes at runtime (unlike I can do with C<fork()>). But of course, I can still use C<fork()> in each of the processes if I want to.<br/><br/>The documentation of MPICH is quite good, maybe a little terse in its description of what the various functions do. But I found out that I can simply use the documentation of <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/ajgough/Parallel-MPI-Simple/">Parallel::MPI::Simple</a>. It covers the basic functions and explains what they do. From that I can derive all the rest that is needed. This is because the MPI specifications defined a beautiful and very consistent interface. Using it from C is a real pleasure.
