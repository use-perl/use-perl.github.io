<p>Ok, I'll admit: I am notoriously impatient. Sourceforge's support-staff is pissing me off by apparently doing nothing to fix their compile farm (just yesterday one more ticket for cf.sourceforge.net was filed by another poor soul). I will now take appropriate actions by passing along the CIP-pools of my computer science faculty and reactive my account on of the many SUNs and WinNT machines. Just hope it will be active before weekend starts.<br/><br/>Yesterday I let a friend of mine (remotely controlled by me via ICQ) compile and run the tests cases for <code>MP3::Mplib</code> again. It was rather a hazzle since <code>Test::Harness</code> and <code>Test::Simple</code> had to be installed locally before that which made me regret to use <code>Test::More</code> instead of just plain <code>Test</code>. After that, the default C-compiler couldn't be found instead he had to fiddle with the Makefiles. It'd be nice if something like <code>perl Makefile.PL CC=/path/to/cc</code> would work.<br/><br/>Running the tests produced the same eight failures as already reported by the cpan-testers. Only that this time tests were apparently run under warnings (something which would have been my duty before releasing!) so that a lot of 'Subroutine %s redefined' messages came. I need to rename a couple of the XSUBS.<br/><br/>Oh, and I have a new vague plan: Perl bindings for the <a href="http://aa-project.sourceforge.net/aalib">aalib</a>, an ASCII art gfx library. Might be fun, albeit a bit of work. Also I haven't ever used this lib before which would cost further time. But it seems to be a worthwhile project.
