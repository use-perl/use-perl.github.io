<p>I didn't have to wait that long for the compilation to finish at all. It took maybe an hour and installation went <i>relatively</i> smoothly even. After copying the bookmarks over from my parallel Mozilla installation, I feel quite at home. Java works (which means that basically all the plug-ins that used to work with Mozilla now also work with Firebird) and the thing is very lean and quick.<br/><br/>A major annoyance of Mozilla has been fixed: I used to get lots of <code>Page contains no data</code> pop-ups since I have a few entries in <code>/etc/hosts</code> that de-route requests to banner servers to <code>127.0.0.1</code> (and I don't have a webserver running). This pissed me off so much that I eventually wrote a little program that is got by inetd on incoming requests in order to serve a little bit of meaningless data so the pop-up disappears. But I don't need this thing for Firebird any longer as it seems.<br/><br/>Now I am quite curious to see whether I eventually manage to install a Flash plugin. Not that I would approve of it, but more and more pages serve essential information through these plugins.
