<p>month: <a href="http://search.cpan.org/author/ZOOLEIKA/Plot-0.01/">Plot</a>.<br/><br/>Initially I thought the author simply didn't write the PODs etc for the module. But no, he simply uploaded a bare stub as created by h2xs. I wonder whether this happened because he used some sort of upload-script for the PAUSE and hitted TAB a little too vigorously.

<h2>Plot of Shame</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/zool/">zool</a> on 2003-05-11T22:08:18</h3>
<p>to my chagrin i must admit to being the author of this module<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) </p>

<p>
extenuating circumstances; i was in a rush to catch the last train home after a hacksesh, and wanted to upload SVG::Plot to slot in with <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/kake/journal/" title="perl.org">kake's</a perl.org> dependencies (cf <a href="http://search.cpan.org/author/KAKE/CGI-Wiki/" title="cpan.org">CGI::Wiki</a cpan.org> and OpenGuides).
</p>
<p>
it being a while since the last (and first) time i put a module on CPAN, i'm not overfamiliar with h2xs or make dist and make tar-dist.
</p>
<p>
to my further chagrin this morning, i realised i'd not only put the module in the wrong namespace, but <em>hadn't actually included the code</em>. Kake showed me the way and the light, for which i am deeply grateful; there've been two more point releases since then.
</p>
<p>
An edge case quite this inane and dubious is pretty difficult to account for in any sensible automated module-checking, but perhaps my slightly intoxicated stupidity has provided some food for thought<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;) i've never met a CPAN packaging HOWTO;  a 'do you really want to do this' function might be useful on PAUSE<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... (perhaps with an option for "don't let me upload this if it's after N o'clock at night in my personal timezone...")
</p>
<p>
i hope this has caused more amusement than it has consternation and despair, anyway.

<i>i hope this has caused more amusement than it has consternation and despair, anyway.</i> <br> <br>It's not a big deal really. Since I am very much afraid of upload-mistakes myself I double- and triple-check the tarballs that leave my computer. And not even that can prevent some silly but unpleasant errors. My favourite one is forgetting to increase <code>$VERSION</code>.

<p>Mine too. But if you're using some sort of revision control system, you can simply do something like</p> <blockquote><div> <tt>$VERSION = substr q$Revision: 3.14 $, 10;</tt> </div></blockquote> <p>which it's done in a lot of modules or</p> <blockquote><div> <tt>($VERSION) = '$Revision: 3.14 $ ' =~<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/\$Revision:\s+([^\s]+)/;</tt> </div></blockquote> <p>as suggested by ExtUtils::MakeMaker.</p>
