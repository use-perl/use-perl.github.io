<p>Yesterday there was the birthday party of a friend of mine. It was nice with about 30 people overall and enough alcohol available. There were even some foreigners present, most notably two pleasant girls from Nice, France. I can't boast to speak an outstanding French, but last night (after a certain amount of alcoholic beverages) it was close to fluent.<br/><br/>Unfortunately I was so foolish to arrive very early at this party (at around 9pm). Subsequently I was drunk pretty soon so I decided to leave at about 1am. This turned out to be a wise decision later. I made quite a mess in my flat (no need to get into embarrassing details). In essence: I managed to undress properly but I am not so sure what happened after that. During the night (I might have been asleep in the meantime) I realized that I was chilled to the bone and being in an extremely uncomfortable spot, namely on the floor _before_ my bed without any blanket or whatsoever. I was able to realize that I was in fact at home (this surprised me in this moment) so I put on a pyjama and crawled into my bed.<br/><br/>At about 9.30am this morning I awoke but I wasn't really in a hurry to get up, partly because of headache but also because I saw that I would have to do quite some cleaning up. This part is now done (I also had to dispose of a book that was so unfortunate to be too close to where my Waterloo obviously happened this night) and I am currently trying to recover with coffee. Cigarettes don't yet taste as good as they usually do at this time of the day so I am obviously not yet done with recovering.<br/><br/>I wonder whether I'll be any wiser after these happenings. I think I do show some progress. The fact that I left just in time at least shows that I learnt my lesseons from previous parties where I stayed to the bitter end (with unpleasant consequences for the host).

I can't keep myself from noticing this -- I'm born in Nice and stayed there until the age of 18. From my personal experience, there are two kinds of <i>Ni&ccedil;ois</i> : the ones who love their town, and the ones who hate it. I belong to the second category, and usually avoid the average Ni&ccedil;ois like plague. (Xenophobia and hypocrisy seem to be in the air of the Riviera. Ni&ccedil;ois tend to be nicer when they're not in Nice.)
