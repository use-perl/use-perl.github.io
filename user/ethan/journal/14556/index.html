<p>Oh, I hate that:<br/><br/><code>
    I will be out of the office starting  09/01/2003 and will not return until
    09/08/2003.<br/><br/>    I will respond to your message when I return.
</code><br/><br/>The thing is, those autoresponders seem to take anything between one minute and one week to respond so I have no idea to which of my mails the above is referring to. Clearly it must be from some mailing-list (where I always cc my mail to the OP).<br/><br/>People using such autoresponders when being subscribed to mailing-lists should be unsubscribed (or preferably: shot or sent to the moon).

<a href="http://use.perl.org/user/merlyn/journal" title="perl.org">merlyn</a perl.org> does this, but not only when he is on vacation, but once every month you happen to reply to a thread he has been involved with.

Ah, good you warned me.<br> <br>Well, Randal, you heard it: no more CCs from me.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

I respond monthly with a FAQ-pointer to non-bulk email that has my name explicitly in the headers, and always reply from a distinct email address that's trivial to filter.
<p>
Note the four conditions.  Also note that it's not what was claimed.
</p><p>
I am still not clear about why having a FAQ-pointer response to mail addressed directly to me that appears only once a month is considered harmful.  It's not list mail.  It's only direct mail.  You don't want it?  Fine.  Remove my name from the header of the p5p email, or filter on the reply name (merlyn's-answering-machine@stonehenge.com).</p>

<i>Also note that it's not what was claimed.</i> <br> <br>Right, it isn't. Note that I was stupid: Since I never so far received any of these FAQ-pointers (and Arthur mentioned it in the context of vacation-autoresponders), I somehow deduced that you'd send out mails telling people about your vacational status.<br> <br>Glad to hear you don't.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

<h2>Autoresponders to list email is worse</h2>

I get these from time to time.  They aren't filtering on "bulk" like they should.  I always ensure that they get booted from the lists.
<p>
Interesting that there's a parallel thread here to my own properly-constructed autoreponder. {grin}</p>
