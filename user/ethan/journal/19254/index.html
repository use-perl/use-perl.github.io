<div class="span8">
<p>A few days ago I had the bright idea of writing an Inline module, just because I was curious how that would work. I chose a language that came to my mind quite spontaneously, partly because I remembered vaguely that it was a language meant to be embedded into other applications.<br/><br/>What I've seen so far of Lua is extremely impressive. The language is extremely clean and, despite offering only a handful of features and concept, very powerful. Some interesting things have been integrated into it quite well, such as coroutines and closures. The latter makes it feel a bit like a functional programming language with the very nice touch of an imperative syntax. It's even object-oriented.<br/><br/>Its C API is a bit confusing for me as of now. That is probably because I haven't yet written a single program in this language. But the Inline stuff already works quite well for some of the basic Lua/Perl types. The nice thing about Lua is that its types map quite well onto Perl. It knows about functions as a data type so a little bit of currying looks like this:<br/><br/><pre>
function foo (a)
    return function (b) return a * b end
end<br/><br/>io.write( foo(5)(3) )
</pre><br/><br/>Very neat! I have already some ideas how the inlined Lua functions can return Lua closures back to Perl as in<br/><br/><pre>
use Inline Lua;<br/><br/>print foo(5)->(3);
__END__
__Lua__
function foo (a)
    return function (b) return a * b end
end
</pre>

<h2>Lua on the Scriptometer</h2>

Just our of curiosity and never having heard of <a href="http://www.lua.org/" title="lua.org">Lua</a lua.org> before I checked it out on the <a href="http://merd.sourceforge.net/pixel/language-study/scripting-language/" title="sourceforge.net">scriptometer</a sourceforge.net>, <a href="http://use.perl.org/article.pl?sid=04/06/09/0753236&amp;mode=thread&amp;tid=13" title="perl.org">mentioned</a perl.org> by <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/gnat" title="perl.org">Gnat</a perl.org> on use.perl.<br> <br>It actually does quite well, with an overall score of 90 compared to Perl's 149

<i>It actually does quite well, with an overall score of 90 compared to Perl's 149 </i> <br> <br>Yes, I also noticed this on the scriptometer. And one has to keep in mind that Lua is not even meant as a standalone language. It is intended to be fleshed out with customly defined C functions to provide additional functionality.<br> <br> <a href="http://www.iolanguage.com/Comparisons/Performance.html" title="iolanguage.com">This comparison</a iolanguage.com> made me stick to Lua. I was on the edge of dropping <code>Inline::Lua</code> again when things didn't work at all in the beginning. But then I saw that Lua appears to be quite performant for some tasks and so I gave it another try, luckily so.

<h2>Lua in 2002</h2>

The first time I heard about Lua was when I participated in the redaction of <a href="http://www.vendian.org/language_year/" title="vendian.org">The Year In Scripting Languages 2002</a vendian.org>. Lots of links there. It looks like a not well-known language but with a small and dynamic community.

This is probably due to the niche it fills. There appears to be no Lua newsgroup, only one mailinglist to which I had to subscribe to get some help yesterday. The list is active and the replies I got were prompt and competent.<br> <br>I haven't yet grokked the 'social structure' of this list but it appears that Lua's developers are there, too. It's odd in that both the people using Lua as a  programming language and those more concerned with embedding Lua (and thus focussing on Lua's C API) can be found on the same mailinglist. From the tone and level of the list I conclude that its community might be one of Lua's strong points.
