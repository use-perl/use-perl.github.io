<p>So I really was serious with my previous journal entry.<br/><br/>Today I started digging through the extensive vim documentation to find out how to write vim scripts. It's actually quite simple but also has some strange scoping semantics. When running a vim script twice using <code>":so script.vim"</code> the values set in the first run are still present. You either have to re-start the vim session from which you are calling the script or include a lot of <br/><br/><code>
if exists("b:var")
   unlet b:var
endif
</code><br/><br/>in your scripts.<br/><br/>One great thing about vim is the option to include a Perl interpreter in it. I, for one, am not very inclined to learn any other regex package than the one from Perl, so I don't feel quite at home if I have to use the crippled regexes of grep or, for that matter, vim. Also, the Perl interpreter will make the blogger for use.perl.com a snap. It should even be possible to retrieve old entries from a journal and modify them. My initial concern was that perhaps vim scripting isn't quite as powerful as Emacs' Elisp language. This, fortunately, turned out to be wrong. <br/><br/>&lt;note_to_myself&gt;
<i>A Perl-enabled editor is always superior.</i>
&lt;/note_to_myself&gt;</p>

<h3><a href="/user/rafael/">rafael</a> on 2002-11-05T11:45:41</h3>
I enjoy vim scripting and find it quite <a href="/user/rafael/journal/8763" title="perl.org">powerful</a perl.org>. (Plus, it's okay
to program in baby-vim and we won't laugh;-)
Not all variables (or mappings, or functions) are global in vim, see
the documentation, for example at<nobr> <wbr></nobr><tt>:help script-variable</tt> and <tt>help script-local</tt>. (Assuming you're using vim 6.)
I never use the perl interpreter in vim (in fact I never compile my vims with
it), because I can always use ! or<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:! in case of emergency. But again, I feel
at home with vim's regexps, because I learned vi (and sed, awk,<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...) before
perl. (I have to admit that I still have to refer to the docs when doing
lookahead/lookbehind assertions -- see<nobr> <wbr></nobr><tt>:help<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/\@=</tt> for example --, but
I don't do this that much anyway.)

<i>I enjoy vim scripting and find it quite powerful [perl.org]. (Plus, it's okay to program in baby-vim and we won't laugh;-)</i> <br> <br>Ah, just reminds me that it was your webpage where I picked up this little hack to use vim as a perldoc pager (I need it to be able to paste the relevant parts of the Perl documentation into postings for comp.lang.perl.misc;-). Also, your Perl indenter is in regular use.<br> <br> <i>But again, I feel at home with vim's regexps, because I learned vi (and sed, awk,<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...) before perl. (I have to admit that I still have to refer to the docs when doing lookahead/lookbehind assertions</i> <br> <br>Amazing how much the background one is coming from will influence one's preferred way of using a computer. For me, almost everything started with Perl. I picked it up while I was still in my Windows days. But the migration to Linux was a logical step because it seemed so nicely integrated there. Unfortunately it made me sort of lazy to learn new things: Why should I do Bash scripts when a perl is sitting around? Why using vim's native features when I can just exploit a full-blown Perl interpreter stuffed into my favourite editor?<br> <br>Vim-scripting however has shown me once more that being polyglot is even better.
