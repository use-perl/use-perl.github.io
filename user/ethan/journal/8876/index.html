<p>Aren't I astonishing? I finally made it to make my first journal entry with vim.<br/><br/>It turned out to be a long fight. Initially, it did not work for a silly typo I made when using jjohn's code as a template. I should have used copy-and-paste instead.<br/><br/>I still need to do a couple of things though. Most notably, finally implement the delete action plus modifying entries. Also, before I make this thing public I <i>really</i> should clean it up a little. The vim-script part of the whole matter is so badly written it makes you cry. This mixture of vim-scripting and Perl is obviously something I don't have much experience with. It is not half as well and cleanly written as jjohn's emacs-equivalent. Want to get a taste of the mess? Here we go (also a good test what happens when I dump raw code into my vim buffer):<br/><br/>
<code>
function! Use_perl_submit()
    let g:success = 0
perl &lt;&lt;EOP
    require Use_Perl_from_vim;
    my @content = map { $_ . "\n" } $curbuf->Get(1 .. $curbuf->Count);
    my $subject = VIM::Eval("g:newentry_subject");
    my $res = Use_Perl_from_vim::add_entry($subject || "no subject", \@content);
    print $res, "\n";
    VIM::DoCommand("let g:success = \"$res\"");
EOP<br/><br/>    if g:success != 0
        1,%delete
        let g:newentry_subject = ""
        echohl Normal | echo "Submit ok. New ID is ".g:success | echohl None 
perl &lt;&lt;EOP
    $curwin->SetHeight(5);
    my $idxw = VIM::Windows(1);
    my $idxb = $idxw->Buffer;
    $idxw->SetHeight($idxb->Count &lt;= 7 ? $idxb->Count : 7);
    sleep(1);
EOP
    call Restore_title(1)
    else
        echohl ErrorMsg | echo "Submit failed!" | echohl None
        perl sleep 1;
    endif
    unlet g:success
    redraw!
endfunction
</code><br/><br/>Could be cleaner, couldn't it? Alas, rafaÃÂ«l told me that baby-vim is ok. Hope he remembers.
</p>

I'll give it a try -- if I figure out how to port it to a non-perl-enabled vim. (On the other hand, I compile from time to time vim with bleadperl, just to check it works.)

<i>I'll give it a try -- if I figure out how to port it to a non-perl-enabled vim.</i> <br> <br>Short ago I wanted to remove the Perl-interpreter dependency but abolished this idea temporarily. The script uses three windows inside vim and, oddly enough, I was only able to set their size and some other properties through the Perl extension. I know there are means to do it with vim-scripting but I wasn't able to find them.<br> <br>Other than that, it should not be that hard. The module can easily be made polymorphic in that it could also be used as a stand-alone script that gets its data through STDIN. Just as jjohn did it.<br> <br>I just added a README and packed it all up in a tarball so if anyone is interested it can be retrieved from <a href="http://buntspecht.kawo2.rwth-aachen.de/user/ethan/perl/" title="rwth-aachen.de">here</a rwth-aachen.de>. A little bit of polishing would do no harm, but basically it should be usable.
