<h2>Ensuring portable code</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/nicholas/">nicholas</a> on 2002-12-03T12:05:51</h3>
<blockquote><div>How do other people ensure interoperability for various OSs? Do they have accounts for different machines or is it programmer's experience that makes the thing work on most platforms?</div></blockquote>

<p>A bit of both. There's no substitute for testing on different machines (and with different compilers), but you'll have a lot less problems if the first place once you become experienced in what is and isn't portable</p>
<p>Part of the problem with portability is that the most common platform (x86) is one of the most forgiving (little or no alignment contraint on pointers, no structure padding), and the most common compiler (gcc) is similarly lax. Bondage and discipline is good for you, but sadly they are not even the implicit default.</p>
<p>For example, your module is also failing its tests on PPC linux, so I'd suspect that it's an endian-ness bug somewhere (your code, or the included library), as both sparc and PPC are big endian. (ie I'm guessing that your code and the library is mostly tested on x86). If it had passed on sparc, but failed on PPC (and ARM; usually little endian) then my guess would be that it woudl be a plain <code>char</code> issue (<code>char</code> is unsigned on PPC and ARM, signed just about everywhere else.)</p>

<p>The you start to get to more esoteric stuff, such as what happens when you ask for a logical shift larger than the integer (undefined behaviour in C, this might actually be your probkem here), or signed integer arithmetic overflows (undefined behaviour, but it turns out that it will do what you expect, if you think it should just do 2s complement, on most platforms except for 64 bit Irix and UTS), whether <code>sizeof(long)</code> isn't <code>sizeof(int)</code>, whether a pointer is larger than <code>int</code>, whether <code>sizeof(short)</code> isn't 2 (on Crays it is <b>8</b>), how bitfield ordering works, is <code>'\n'</code> actually 10, is <code>'A'</code> &gt; <code>'1'</code>, <i>etc</i> </p>



<h2>B&amp;amp;D</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/koschei/">koschei</a> on 2002-12-03T12:55:35</h3>
What options would you recommend to gcc to improve its B&amp;D on the code?



<h2>Endianness</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ethan/">ethan</a> on 2002-12-03T14:06:04</h3>
<i>For example, your module is also failing its tests on PPC linux, so I'd suspect that it's an endian-ness bug somewhere (your code, or the included library), as both sparc and PPC are big endian.</i> <br> <br>Seems more and more reasonable to me to suspect byte order. Just browsed through mplib and did in fact find a lot of bitshift operations in <code>mp_get_id3v2_tag</code> (the id3v2-reading was the stuff that failed in the tests) but not in the corresponding <code>mp_get_id3v1_tag</code>.<br> <br>If these are in fact the offending parts, a few preprocessor directives could already be enough to differentiate between big and little endianness.<br> <br>The mplib docs don't say much abou that. They only mention mplib being "cross-platform capable" which is probably a broad term. Fortunately the library comes with its own testsuite which is the first thing I will try when I finally have the access to the compile-farm.



<h2>B &amp;amp; D with gcc</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/nicholas/">nicholas</a> on 2002-12-03T14:06:08</h3>
<p>This is use.perl, so <b>-Wall</b>, obviously<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>
<p>parrot is compiled with <code>-Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -Wmissing-prototypes -Winline -Wshadow -Wpointer-arith -Wcast-qual -Wcast-align -Wwrite-strings -Waggregate-return -Winline -W -Wno-unused -Wsign-compare -Wformat-nonliteral -Wformat-security -Wpacked -Wpadded -Wdisabled-optimization</code> on gcc 3.2. Some of those are specific to various recent versions of gcc - take a look at parrot's <code>config/auto/gcc.pl</code> for how it chooses its bondage preferences based on gcc version. However, parrot is trying really hard from the start to build under maximum bondage. Even with recent effort, the perl5 core isn't much mor than <code>-Wall</code> clean.</p>
<p>Annoyingly as far as I'm aware all the gcc options can only warn you about problems based on the platform you're compiling for, so it can't tell you about portability-removing assumptions you've made (such as the pointer cast alignment warnings only warn about the target platform, so you won't get warned that maybe casting a <code>char *</code> to a <code>double *</code> might be a bad plan) and IIRC on some of the strict ANSI settings it still lets through some non ANSI C if it's flagged in a special way (so you can't verify that glibc's headers really are ANSI, unless you use a stricter compiler, such as lcc)</p>
