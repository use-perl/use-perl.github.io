<p>Four days ago the two little pigeons slipped from the two eggs on my ledge. So now I have two basball-sized furry yelloish things in the flower pot. It took them around two days to open their eyes and they've already grown considerably ever since. The first days there was always one of the parent birds sitting on them to keep them warm. Now they are apparently old enough so that they can be left alone for an hour or so in between.<br/><br/>They are actually quite cute. If you touch one slightly on the head, it apparently mistakes it as an attack from its brother (or sister, who knows) and they start to fight with each other for a few seconds. Another funny thing is their proportions. Their claws and peckers already have full size which gives them a rather comical look.

Cute tiny birds, and you post no pictures?  C'mon!

Yeah, sorry for that. I did intend to take a few with my webcam but the USB cable wasn't quite long enough. The next time they're on their own I'll just  temporarily move the flower pot closer to the computer and take a few photos.
