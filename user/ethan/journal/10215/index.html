<p>I had some remarkable progress with FreeBSD today, which included compiling my first kernel (after which I was eventually able to mount my linux partition) and making my DSL run. The latter was a particular pleasure since it only took two minutes and thus beats the same procedure on Linux (where I still don't quite know why my DSL works).<br/><br/>Automating the dialing-up however through <code>rc.conf</code> led into a fiasco. I was left in a sort of primitive single user mode with none of the two available text editors (ee and vim) working any longer. So you tell me how to reverse changes to a text file without an editor.<br/><br/>But of course, Perl was still working and I was able to repair <code>rc.conf</code> with a one-liner (typing it took me a while since I only had the American layout on my German keyboard...hard to find characters such as ', ! and /). <br/><br/>Btw, this journal entry here is my first contribution to the www backed by FreeBSD.</p>

<h2>Single User Mode</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Dom2/">Dom2</a> on 2003-01-27T16:23:01</h3>
You can usually get ee or vim working by doing<blockquote><div> <tt>mount -u<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/<br>mount<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/usr<br>mount<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/var</tt> </div></blockquote> <p>Alternatively, you could have used ed(1).  It's not pretty, but not impossible either.  It's saved my bacon a number of times...

I don't think this was actually single user mode (I wasn't able to find out really). It looked as though booting was incomplete: it tried to dial with the message <code>PPP started as root</code> and that was it then. No login, it simply dropped to a shell.<br> <br>I am not yet fully grokking FreeBSD, I am afraid. After my succesful compilation of the kernel I had to learn that it no longer asked for the password when logging in as root so I had to re-set the password using<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/stand/sysinstall. Very weird.<br> <br>But still, it appears to be an extremely solid and well laid-out operating system. Now that I have access to my Linux partition it should be possible to steal a bit of the configuration from their. And since I have a working internet-connection as well, google can assist me with resolving things. Before that I had to boot into Linux to look something up, reboot BSD to realize that it didn't quite work that way and so forth.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-/

<h2>Yes, /bin/ed</h2>

Every admin should take the 15 minutes that it takes to read <tt>ed(1)</tt>, and play with it for another 15 minutes, for those fateful days when nothing is working right and you need to edit a file.
