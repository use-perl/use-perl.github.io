<p>Just received this email:<br/><br/><code>
    Subject: Other platforms<br/><br/>    I'm trying to compile it on macos x 10.1.5. do you know about any
    problems
    that could occur?<br/><br/>    yours xxxx
</code><br/><br/>with 'xxxx' being the placeholder for the name of the author.<br/><br/>Two things worthy mention: What does he try to compile? He must be referring to one of my Perl modules...good, only three candidates that require C compilation left. Secondly, he seems to ask whether I can anticipate any problems I<that could occur>. Why doesn't he just try? Compilers tend to be faster than me responding to emails.<br/><br/>I wonder what people with really many CPAN distributions (like Simon for instance) have to suffer when all user-requests are like that. Poor chaps.

<h2>Mailing lists</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/autarch/">autarch</a> on 2003-08-30T22:16:55</h3>
Fortunately, the modules that get the most questions have mailing lists.  If I had to answer all the Mason questions personally, I'd go nuts.  Fortunately, a lot of other people answer things, which leaves me free for the weirder problems that only a few people (Jon Swartz, Ken Williams, and I mostly) can deal with.



<h2>My favourite emails</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/grantm/">grantm</a> on 2003-08-31T01:06:09</h3>
<p>The ones I really 'love' go something like this:</p>

<blockquote><div>I've heard great things about your module 'X' but Perl is a really complicated language that I don't grok.  Had you considered rewriting 'X' in 'V'?</div></blockquote>

One of my favourites was a guy who copied and pasted from the SYNOPSIS section and then asked why it didn't work...(umm, none of those variables in the argument lists are set to anything yet)...
