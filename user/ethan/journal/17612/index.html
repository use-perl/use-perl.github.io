<p>Amazing how French can make you not listen closely. <br/><br/>There's currently a commercial for Smart on German television which involves a pretty well known French song. After letting it pass my ears without much attention for the words, I tried to identify them.<br/><br/>My first guess was "Ne me laisse pas lumer", which doesn't make that much sense. Some searches on p2p networks revealed a song apparently sung by Brigitte Bardot with the name "Ne me laisse pas l'aimer". Don't let me love him? Hmmh.<br/><br/>But now France Gall comes into the game. It could also be "Si tu n'me laisses pas tomber". But was this voice I heard really that of France Gall? What we need is advanced searching capabilities: no stupid textboxes to type in characters. But instead a microphone which lets me hum in the tune.<br/><br/>It appears that this song now has haunted me. I wonder whether I'll be able to solve this little piece of maze.

<h2>theres a mobile service in the uk..</h2>

...that lets you play songs down the mobile and they text you back the artist, album, etc.
<p>
Don't know how good it would be off the telly for a french song

<h2>France Gall's</h2>

... voice slightly changed between the sixties and nowadays. -- I know none of the songs you quoted, so maybe it's not "pretty well known" (at least not in France). This probably doesn't mean anything, I don't usually listen to the lyrics of songs, and I don't listen to pop music that much.

It was indeed Brigitte Bardot. "Ne me laisse pas l'aimer" is to be found on her "Best of" album.<br> <br>Judging from how often it occurs in the various p2p networks (namely exactly zero times), it is apparently not so known.

Puzzle solved, it is indeed Bardot song. Real hacker can find out by using par exemple amazon.de, search for Bardot CD and listen to sound sample. E voila!

Smarter boys visit the smart website. They then tell you, that it is Brigitte Bardot.<br/><br/>Daniel<br/><br/>print chr--$g+ord for'KWVX%GUW]RP^-^Tb]2[UXa\j#'=~m$.$g;
