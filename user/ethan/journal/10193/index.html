<div class="span8">
<p>There is a special sort of design-pattern that I've come up during my attempts with XS that has so far proven its usefulness quite often. Consider the following setup in a C-header:<br/><br/><code><br/><br/>    struct dbx {
        ...
    } DBX;
    
    struct dbxemail {
        ...
    } DBXEMAIL;
    
    char * dbx_get_email_body(DBX *dbx, DBXEMAIL* email);<br/><br/></code><br/><br/>For an object-oriented approach, where a DBX- and a DBXEMAIL object exists, this is sub-optimal, since the DBXEMAIL object needs a reference to a DBX in order to be able to say <code>$dbxemail-&gt;get_body</code>.<br/><br/>So in my XS, I wrapped the DBXEMAIL struct thusly:<br/><br/><code>
    struct dbx_email {
        DBX         *dbx;
        DBXEMAIL    *email;
        char        *header;  /* just the header */
        char        *body;    /* just the body */
    } DBX_EMAIL;
</code><br/><br/>Typemaps take care of all the conversions, etc. Very convenient. get_body() then could look like this:<br/><br/><code>
    char *
    get_body(self)
            DBX_EMAIL *self;
        CODE:
            RETVAL = dbx_get_email_body(self-&gt;dbx, self-&gt;email);
        OUTPUT:
            RETVAL
</code><br/><br/>Yet, while going to bed last night I was thinking about this pattern, and more specifically about this piece of code:<br/><br/><code><br/><br/>    my $dbxemail;
    {
        my $dbx = Mail::Transport::Dbx-&gt;("file.dbx");
        $dbxemail-&gt;get(0); # first message
    }
    print $dbxemail-&gt;get_body;
    
</code><br/><br/>The destructor of Mail::Transport::Dbx objects would get invoked (and thus destroying my <code>DBX*</code> structure) while $dbxemail would still hold a pointer to this (now freed) DBX. First thing I did this morning was trying it and, yes, it indeed dumped core.<br/><br/>The fixes themselves were harmless. <code>DBX_EMAIL-&gt;dbx</code> is no longer a <code>DBX*</code> but now a <code>SV*</code> (namely the DBX* as a Perl object) so that I can increase and decrease the refcount where necessary. Of course, I have to do a few things manually that'd normally be taken care of by the typemaps, but that could probably be done by a macro if it gets too annoying.<br/><br/>Anyway, just wanted to inform the world out there that bugs can be discovered (and even fixed) while doing other things (like brushing your teeth, dining with your girl-friend etc.). Don't let your mind rest when you're away from the computer. Programming Perl can be carried out everywhere (even in mind, or possibly in your dreams). I still hope that some day I wake up in the morning, rush to my computer and simply type down the module I programmed during the night while dreaming. Mozart worked a little like that: He wrote down one piece of music composed previously in mind and at the same time his mind was already composing the next symphony. Sigh, I wish I was a genius!
