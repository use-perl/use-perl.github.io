<p>Being an enthusiast for the old and grand classic movies, it was tonight the first time that I watched "To kill a mockingbird". I somehow expected to see a movie similar to "12 angry men"...and was somehow irritated at first to see that it was not.<br/><br/>Alas, it's an awesome film and I regret that I haven't yet watched it at least ten times. Now I can finally understand how Atticus Finch could become such a legendary character. Needless to say, Gregory Peck is the only cast that would perfectly fit him. It's such a pleasure to see him act (not just in this movie, but here it becomes so striking).<br/><br/>It's a shame that so many of the great actors from these old days no longer live: Laurence Olivier, Henry Fonda, Grace Kelly, Audrey Hepburn, James Stewart, Walter Matthau, Gregory Peck, Charles Bronson (just like Peck he embodied a certain type of character in a way only he could do). All dead. The latter two just died this year. Sigh.

The film is, of course, excellent! Peck is one of my favourite actors. But Peck never matched my image of Finch from the book. Go read it again and see if that block with the dodgy eye maps onto Peck.<br> <br>Still a darn fine film tho'

Actually, I haven't yet read Harper Lee's novel. I've put it on my mental to-do list though. According to most comments on imdb.com the movie is actually one of the few good adaptations of a novel.<br> <br>I have a few blank spots anyway when it comes to American writers. I am more aquainted with the British ones, although from what I hear the stuff by Harper Lee and others (such as Truman Capote) would probably fit me quite well.<br> <br>As for Spencer Tracy, I am not so sure whether he'd have given a good Atticus Finch, honestly.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-) But you remind me that I finally need to get my hands on "Bad day at Black Rock", a movie I remember having only partly watched years ago.

"Bad Day at Black Rock" - fun movie (and one of the first american movies to have some kung-fu-fighting<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)
