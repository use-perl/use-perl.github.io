<p>Currently playing around with Andreas KÃÂ¶nig's <code>Perl::Repository::APC</code> which is extremely cool when one has arranged for a few things in beforehand.<br/><br/>So far my way of working with the Perl core has been rather cumbersome. I do have rsynced the blead- and maint-branch which is ok when preparing a patch. However, it is not enough when trying to track down what the effects of a particular patch are. So I tried it with <code>patchaperlup</code> first which - according to its documentation - should be able to create a Perl source-directory up to a given change from an existing source-tree and a directory of patches. However, that didn't work.<br/><br/>So I looked into <code>buildaperl</code>. To my dismay I read that I need to have a full rsync mirror of the APC so I rsynced one and now have almost 700 new megabyte in my home-directory. The good thing is that it works and it took me around two minutes to create <code>perl-p-5.8.0@21751</code> with it. Very nice.<br/><br/>And now I'll indulge with <code>perlbench</code> a little.

<h2>Repository</h2>

You may want to look at perlpatch2svn (if you have large enough disks). By importing all the APC into a subversion repository, you can use the svn facility commands to have the list of changes that affected a file, to revert some particular patch by number (merge in reverse), to generate diffs... (I don't use it very much anymore, becoming more and more familiar with p4.)

Sounds interesting but scary because I need to install subversion locally. You aren't probably aware of how silly I look when I sit before some revision control system trying to squeeze the desired information out of it. I am not very talented with those kind of things.<br> <br>Right now I am getting most of the stuff I want to know from the <a href="http://public.activestate.com/cgi-bin/perlbrowse" title="activestate.com">perlbrowse repository</a activestate.com>. After you improved some bits of it some while ago it's really useful and (most importantly in my case;-) easy to use.
