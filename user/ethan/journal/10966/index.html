<p>[ broken link corrected ]<br/><br/>This friday I returned from these three exciting and interesting days. Mark Overmeer (my room-mate for this time) arrived by folding-bike which I found rather amusing to see. He seems to know all the people so I quickly knem them as well.<br/><br/>After the workshop I was pretty exhausted over all the talks that were given (some very good, some others rather not for me). The best part is the people you meet on such occasions. Nicholas Clark was absolutely amazing. He is one of the few guys who appear to think more quickly than he can talk (and, gosh, he is a quick talker!). And apart from that he is just a very nice chap as well!<br/><br/>Same applies to Leon Brocard who suddenly showed up at the same table on the large evening dinner next to me. We briefly discussed the fact that we are both authors of an MP3-tag module.<br/><br/>Other highlights were the talks of Jos Boumans on CPANPLUS (his creation after all) and an extremely entertaining talk about POE. When you intend to have a drink in the evening, be sure to have him around. He has some sound and interesting ideas about Perl. Also, he can drink a reasonable amount of beer. ;-)<br/><br/>The Berlin-people were also present. Andreas KÃÂ¶nig (whose whole appearance is in interesting contrast to the rest of the crowd) and Slaven Rezic. He's a very polite and pleasant Perl hacker. His modesty strikes you: Even though being a perl5-porter (with a lot of contributed patches) he claims that he can barely read C-code. Haha. Then I'd like to see him do things he really masters (or would acknowldge to master).<br/><br/>Of course, I met much more people. Schwern was also on the workshop but didn't give a talk unfortunately. But at least he was productive: During some of the talks he was always hacking on <code>ExtUtils::MakeMaker</code>.<br/><br/>While I am at it: I urge everyone to take a closer look at <a href="http://search.cpan.org/author/MHX/Convert-Binary-C">Convert::Binary::C</a>. Its author gave a talk on it and explained the concept of the module to me the day beforei (it contains a complete yacc-grammar for C!). The module itself is ingenious and extremely useful (even though you wouldn't expect that). Even Nicholas seemed to be quite impressed. Finally we have a performant and easy replacement for the <code>pack()/unpack()</code> twins!

<h2>Link to Convert::Binary::C broken...</h2>

Recently I deleted a bunch of obsolete/buggy C::B::C revisions from the CPAN, including 0.11. It's usually a good idea not to include the version number in links to CPAN Search. <a href="http://search.cpan.org/author/MHX/Convert-Binary-C" title="cpan.org">This link</a cpan.org> should always point to the latest Convert::Binary::C release.

Yup, you are right. I have the bad habit of launching search.cpan.org, search for a distribution and copy that link into the journal. That way, they will include the version and not - as they should - link to the actual module regardless of the release.
