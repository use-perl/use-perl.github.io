I was thinking about the sentence <b>"You guys forget your being so far ahead 
of people that your examples are difficult to understand"</b>.<br/><br/>I think this chap has made a very justified complaint here. So what can CPAN 
authors assume about the Perl skills of their potential users? I am always 
tempted to include yet another example trying to foresee possible pitfalls 
for novices or semi-novices - and thus annoying the more advanced users 
who rather see the perldocs as a reference material.<br/><br/>And then, as this mail shows, there still seems to be need for even more 
examples. Should we really re-iterate all those things that are layed out 
in <a href="http://www.perldoc.com/perl5.8.0/pod/perlref.html">perlref</a>? Should we explain the difference between an instance and 
a class method?<br/><br/>I am not yet sure. I think from now on I'll always include a reference to 
some relevant perldocs in the "=head1 SEE ALSO" section. After all, 
it's always good to read the perldocs. :-)</p>

<h2>More Clarification</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/barbie/">barbie</a> on 2002-10-30T10:50:25</h3>
I can understand where the guy is coming from. There have been modules that I needed to use and understanding the docs can be hard work. There have also the modules where documentation has been rather sparse. It's not so much the idea of more examples that's necessarily needed, but more clarification of the problem that the module deals with and the solution(s) that it provides.
<p>
In some cases modules jump in at the deep end and just give examples of the syntax. When what is actually needed is a description of how the module's functions fit in the real world, and how to get the best out of it.
</p><p>
There are many modules that do this very nicely, Richard Clamp's <a href="http://search.cpan.org/author/RCLAMP/File-Find-Rule-0.07/" title="cpan.org">File::Find::Rule</a cpan.org> is a good example, it's long but does explain what it does very well. Others fail miserably, Ilya Sterin's XML::SAXDriver::Excel comes to mind. The documentation for <a href="http://search.cpan.org/author/ISTERIN/XML-SAXDriver-Excel-0.06/" title="cpan.org">XML::SAXDriver::Excel</a cpan.org> recently caused a big headache for a colleague of mine, simply because the documentation is both inaccurate:</p><blockquote><div> <tt>(If you don't have a c compiler, you can optionaly place the file Excel.pm in the XML/SAXDriver/CSV directory in the perl include directory)</tt> </div></blockquote>(when the correct directory is XML/SAXDriver under your perl modules directory) and very unhelpful as to how to use it. Thankfully my colleague is reading <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/perlxml/" title="oreilly.com">Perl and XML</a oreilly.com> to guide him, but without the book I personally wouldn't touch the module.
<p>
It's well known and accepted that programmers hate writing documentation, but if you want people to use your code you do need to have something that makes it clear why you should use it.
</p><p>
Whenever I write documentation or a review, I always get my partner to read it. She isn't a programmer and if she starts asking the wrong questions then I know I need to make the text clearer.</p>
