<div class="span8">
<p>Let's regard this little piece of imbecility as found in Solaris' <code>sys/cdio.h</code>:<br/><br/><code>
struct cdrom_tocentry {
	unsigned char	cdte_track;
	unsigned	cdte_adr	:4;
	unsigned	cdte_ctrl	:4;
	unsigned char	cdte_format;
	union {
		struct {
			unsigned char	minute;
			unsigned char	second;
			unsigned char	frame;
		} msf;
		int	lba;
	} cdte_addr;
	unsigned char	cdte_datamode;
};
</code><br/><br/>It can be seen that they <i>inlined</i> the <code>cdte_addr</code> slot. In Linux for instance there is a distinct type <code>union cdrom_addr</code>. Now suppose we have defined a type like this that works for Linux:<br/><br/><code>
typedef struct CDROM_ADDR {
    union cdrom_addr addr;
    int type;
} CDROM_ADDR;
</code><br/><br/>Naturally, for Solaris this has to become:<br/><br/><code>
typedef struct CDROM_ADDR {
    union {
	struct {
	    unsigned char   minute;
	    unsigned char   second;
	    unsigned char   frame;
	} msf;
	int lba;
    } addr;
    int type;
} CDROM_ADDR;
</code><br/><br/>What makes the Solaris approach so stupid is that I can no longer write:
<code>
    struct cdrom_tocentry entry;
    CDROM_ADDR		  addr;
    ...
    addr.addr = entry.cdte_addr;
</code><br/><br/>Any compiler will complain that there are incompatible types in the assignment although the two types match perfectly.<br/><br/>So why weren't the Solaris people able to define a distinct type for the address union? Instead they used the inlined type three times in their header which makes assigning the address impossible. For me as a programmer this means that I either need yet another <code>#if SOLARIS</code> branch or I always write:<br/><br/><code>
    addr.addr.lba = entry.cdte_addr.lba;
</code><br/><br/>Working with Solaris will at some point put tear in your eyes.<br/><br/>As a related note - and because I have no physical access to a Solaris machine - I yet need to find out whether Solaris stores LBA addresses in their native big-endian format or whether they rather use host-byteorder. BSDs use big-endian for some reason, Linux uses little-endian (regardless of the processor's native byteorder). I predict that there nowhere any information about that can be found.

Post this to comp.unix.solaris or send an email directly to Sun.  Solaris 10 final isn't out yet - maybe it can be fixed by then.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

FWIW, it hasn't changed as of the latest "solaris express" release of 10.

to Alan Burlison...he said he logged it as a bug.

Long live Alan!<br> <br>I didn't know that it is so easy to get something filed as a bug for Solaris. It's good to know that the Perl community has a genuine SUN chap in Alan Burliston.

Well...he is one of the lead kernel engineers for Solaris 10 afterall<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

That I didn't know. So maybe and after all Solaris can be trusted more than I would want to acknowledge.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

<tt>FYI, I've logged a bug - although no promises as to when it might be fixed.<br> <br>As far as LBA byte ordering goes, this from the CDROM driver:<br> <br>entry-&gt;cdte_addr.lba = ((uchar_t)buffer[8] &lt;&lt; 24) + ((uchar_t)buffer[9] &lt;&lt; 16) + ((uchar_t)buffer[10] &lt;&lt; 8) + ((uchar_t)buffer[11]);<br> </tt>

If it isn't obvious from the above, buffer is the SCSI reply buffer, and the code is common to both x86 &amp; sparc.

<i>If it isn't obvious from the above, buffer is the SCSI reply buffer, and the code is common to both x86 &amp; sparc. </i> <br> <br>That means I don't have to worry about byteorder. I just use the machine's native format which is good.<br> <br>I became suspicious when I learnt that the BSDs deliberately use network byteorder so on x86 I need to swap the bytes when reading the address or passing it as an ioctl parameter. It's a pleasant surprise that this time Solaris does not require any special treatment.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-) Thanks, Alan!

<i>FYI, I've logged a bug - although no promises as to when it might be fixed.</i> <br> <br>Almost forget to mention: I'm happy this has been put on the (undoubtedly voluminous) to-do list. Naturally, this wont immediately solve all my problems. It's the same with Solaris as it is with Perl: after a bug has been fixed in a new release, you have to wait a few years until you can start relying on the fixed behaviour. Propagation happens slowly (consider how many perl5.005_03s or even older are still used in production).
