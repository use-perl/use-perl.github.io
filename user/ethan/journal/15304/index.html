<p>Some vanity is just plain silly: Now we have another module author giving <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/XML-Smart/">his module</a> five stars without even mentioning it's his work he has rated. Gross. <br/><br/>My holy promise should therefore be recorded here that I'll never rate one of my own modules when I think it's good (mediocre ratings explicitely permitted).
</p>

<h2>I did not dare to rate mine...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/BooK/">BooK</a> on 2003-10-21T08:37:45</h3>
<p>I did not dare to rate my own modules,
because 1) I was sure the system did not allow
it, and 2) I didn't want to look like an egotical fool in front of the Perl community.</p>
<p>But I like my modules, and I like it even more when people tell me they like them too (which happened a few times recently).<nobr> <wbr></nobr><tt>;-)</tt> </p>



<h2>Counterbalance</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/schwern/">schwern</a> on 2003-10-21T13:28:52</h3>
I'm tempted to give that module a 0 star review to balance things out.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)



<h2>How it is</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/djberg96/">djberg96</a> on 2003-10-21T15:21:34</h3>
What, you mean my silly rating for DBI hasn't caused the cpanrating system to crumble?  SHOCKING!
<p>
This is, frankly, why I brushed off hfb and pudge's "the sky is falling" complaints - I knew it was harmless and that the real threat to the system was from stunts like the ones mentioned in this journal entry.
</p><p>
One solution would be to do what bebits.com does - you don't get a visible rating until at least 10 people have voted on your code.  I think I would reduce that to 3 for cpanratings, but it would work.</p>

<i>What, you mean my silly rating for DBI hasn't caused the cpanrating system to crumble? SHOCKING!</i> <br> <br>Right. Although it is somewhat an edge case in its wording.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)<br> <br>But at least those five stars you gave were a) justitfied and b) given by you and not Tim Bunce.<br> <br> <i>I knew it was harmless and that the real threat to the system was from stunts like the ones mentioned in this journal entry.</i> <br> <br>I think people overestimate these ratings. I am not going to use a module unless I need it. Even if it has a few hundred stars. I guess others handle things quite similarily.<br> <br>Likewise with the ratings: the not so frequently used modules probably don't get ratings at all. That's why I for instance gave high ratings to Convert::Binary::C and autobox. They are seldom used, but their authors should get some credit for   a very nice piece of work.<br> <br>But crediting oneself wont work. Only foreign credits make you feel lofty.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

I hardly said the sky is falling.  I just said that I believed the system would be abused, and I was skeptical that it would be useful.  Actually, so far, the system has been useless because it has not been used *enough*, in my opinion.<br> <br>And I will come clean and note that I rated one of my own modules, D'oh, but the module is a joke to begin with (and predates Acme:: by several years<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-).
