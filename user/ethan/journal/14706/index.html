<p>What a pity, why isn't every band in the world like <a href="http://www.lachicanatango.com/">this</a> one from Argentina?<br/><br/>Besides being a brilliant combo (with a pretty sexy lead-voice, for example <a href="http://www.lachicanatango.com/oro.mp3">here</a>), they put a lot of their songs online as MP3s (although they should check their links, a random selection of them always defunct).<br/><br/>And on the other side we have the big record companies, producing a painful lot of crap, pressing it onto crippled CDs that refuse to playback on a lot of devices and demanding a ludicrous amount of money for it.<br/><br/>Ironically, I'd love to buy these three albums of La Chicana, but I can't since it's not possible to get them anywhere in Germany (or probably even Europe). I suppose their music is just not crappy enough to be sold in stores.

<h2>mp3.com</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/bart/">bart</a> on 2003-09-15T09:52:28</h3>
The also have a <a href="http://artists.mp3s.com/artists/94/la_chicana_tango.html" title="mp3s.com">homepage</a mp3s.com> at mp3.com. You can even buy an album online. You'd still have to pay the postal fee, coming from the States, but it might still be worth checking out.
<p>I can't locate them on <a href="http://cdbaby.com/" title="cdbaby.com">CDBaby</a cdbaby.com> (probably the most interesting online record shop in the world) either, unfortunately.</p>



<h2>Cool!</h2>

Very nice! I didn't know about the ressources you cited. Oddly enough, there is no link from their webside to mp3.com.<br> <br>Will inspect both links more closely...thanks for mentioning them!
