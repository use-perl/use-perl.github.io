<p>I just did some necessary upgrades on my Debian that I haven't used for a while, including the upgrade from perl5.6.1 to perl5.8.0 (I am running testing). After that I immediately re-installed all the modules that I usually use. Unfortunately, and I can't yet say why, Term::ReadKey doesn't work any longer. More precisely: it compiles and tests fine. I can switch the read-modes with no problem but <code>ReadKey</code> doesn't detect any key-strokes anymore in raw read-mode. When I eventually kill the program all the keys I entered are dumped to the console so I suspect they end up in some buffer.<br/><br/>This is more than annoying since my mp3-player relies on Term::ReadKey and I can't use it right now. I've no idea yet what could be causing this. :-(

I run Debian unstable on my laptop and I just installed Term::ReadKey with the CPAN shell and it passed all its tests.

That might be because per default only the non-interactive tests are run. Those pass for me, too. But <code>perl -Mblib test.pl interactive</code> in the unpacked distribution directory wont.<br> <br>One other thing, though, is bugging me right now. Before the upgrade I had 5.5.3 and 5.8.0 compiled myself. Now, after the upgrade of the vendor perl to 5.8.0, I somehow can't seem to find my old 5.8.0. Obviously it got overwritten. Which is odd because I can't imagine that I installed any custom perl with the<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/usr prefix. But maybe I did and the old installation has still some files around that the threaded Debian-perl now uses.
