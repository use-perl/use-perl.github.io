<p>I seem to have survived the most furious outbreakes of my cold and so, I am now recovering early in the morning with hot cups of wonderfully refreshing Earl Grey (which the Britishers will know). This tea is one that could even rival a very good coffee (which the Britishers won't know).<br/><br/>Besides that, I grabbed the new mplib release, moved the old MP3/Mplib directory to a safe location and ran <code>h2x -O -b 5.5.3 -n MP3::Mplib mplib.h</code> once more. 0.02 will eventually have all the benefits of a second release: using <code>ExtUtils::Constants</code> and hopefully the absence of all the mistakes I made in the first release (many).

<p>What's wrong with our coffee?</p>

<p>I do know Earl Grey, but I don't like it (although I understand that <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/robrt/" title="perl.org">robrt</a perl.org> does). What I do remember about Germany was that it was hard to find a decent cup of tea, because there's almost only ever condensed milk or cream provided - great for coffee, but not for tea. Earl Grey is supposed to be drunk without milk - maybe there's a correlation here<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>

<p>And how I resolved this "no tea" problem? <code>use more 'coffee';</code> </p>

<i>What's wrong with our coffee?</i> <br> <br>Not so much, except that your coffee always tastes rather like tea.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-) Honestely, the anglosaxon world doesn't know how to fix a proper cup of coffee. A decent coffee is supposed to make your heart bump furiously and - if necessary - revitalize a dead body.<br> <br> <i>What I do remember about Germany was that it was hard to find a decent cup of tea, because there's almost only ever condensed milk or cream provided - great for coffee, but not for tea.</i> <br> <br>I agree on this one though. Tea only has some tradition in the north of Germany, but that differs from the British tea tradition: they drink it with a few rocks of candy and cream...but without stiring the cup.<br> <br> <i>Earl Grey is supposed to be drunk without milk - maybe there's a correlation here<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</i> <br> <br>No correlation as far as I am concerned.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-) I am drinking my Earl Grey with a little bit of lemon juice and sugar and nothing milkish in it. Actually I started that rather by accident: I had a cold with a seriously sore throat and I thought that tea is considered to be good then so I temporarily replaced coffee with tea. The first sip of Earl Grey made me go "Ahh....ohh, lovely!". It's addictive really.<br> <br> <i>And how I resolved this "no tea" problem? use more 'coffee';</i> <br> <br>By the way, is there any substantial knowledge (perhaps some scientific surveys) in which way tea will affect your coding?  Up to this moment, all of my CPAN contributions have been coffee-powered.  But perhaps it's time for the <b>tea-paradigm</b> entering the coffee-dominated world of programming.
