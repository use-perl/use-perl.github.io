<p>This is so great! My Iiyama monitor (that already got replaced a few months ago) is again showing signs of disease. It is once more the fish-eye syndrome wheret the viewable parts are compressed to around 60% of the monitor's width and shaped ovally on its sides. Interestingly enough (and this actually stops me from planning to blow up the German iiyama headquarters), these deformations only happen in pure text-mode (80x24). Since I am now using framebuffer for the console, I only have to see these ugly contortions during boot-time. Nonetheless, this is not exactly comforting news.<br/><br/>I am glad that only half of the warranty has expired yet so I phoned the iiyama chaps to get it replaced. They said that they wouldn't have this model on stock for an indefinite time and so they offered to take the monitor and have it repaired. I gladly refuses this offer since it would have left me without monitor for around two weeks. Instead they'll now call me when the monitors are available again. As long as the monitor is working perfectly alright under all modi save for pure-text, this is ok.<br/><br/>I just wonder: if their monitors keep breaking like this, I'll have had four to five new monitors within the three years of warranty. Since they bring the replacement monitor to my home, I don't care that much.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, I finally watched "And then there were none" (the one from 1945) which I managed to pull off eMule after waiting quite a while for it. The film is mostly a quite accurat adaptation of the Agatha Christie novel. It's maybe lacking a little of the dark atmosphere from the book and, of course, has the original ending replaced with a happy one. I don't have the book around right now, but as far as I remember the last person to be alive on the island did in fact hang herself so all ten people were dead eventually. In the movie the girl and the handsome guy Lambert - of course - survive and leave the island as a couple. But I can't be sure that I remember the ending of the novel correctly. In any way, the film was enjoyable with sometimes exaggerated but nonetheless good acting. And now it'll go on CD-R since I adore those old-fashioned movies with very old-fashioned Agatha Christie English a lot.

You're correct -- the novel's ending was the  death of all ten of the chosen folks.  If my memory serves, Agatha herself wrote the second ending when she adapted the novel to a stage play.

Thanks for the confirmation. This second ending by Christie is the one employed in the movie as some comments on imdb.com reveal. That makes it a little more legitimate but not better.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

My current monitor is a 2 year old Iiyama. I'm generally happy with it, but its colours recently became darker ; forcing me to push contrast and luminosity to the maximum. Weird. I guess I'll have to change it soon.

I think these gradual decays are worse because they aren't covered by the warranty (at least in the German warranty regulations iiyama explicitely excludes them).<br> <br>If you still have a year left in warranty, you can hope that a sudden real failure occurs...and maybe helping a little that this is going to happen.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-) My assumption with iiyama monitors (at least with mine) is that they don't really like excessive switching of modes as I do very frequently when I switch from X to the console and back. Or maybe it is because I also use this odd PAL-resolution with xawtv. It's a mode not natively supported by the monitor.

<p>I think that my current monitor celebrates its seventh birthday this month. It's an iiyama Vision Master Pro 17, still seems to be working very nicely, and I'm keeping it thank you<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>
