So yeah I managed to get to the Penderels Oak last night to meet up with dha and the bedraggled remains of the london perl mongers that had survived the previous nights debauchery.
</p>
<p>
It's always nice to see everyone and although there were a number of notable absences it certainly all seemed to be going swimmingly.
</P>
<p>
Penderel's Oak was very crowded with sundry pissed up Office Folk and there appeared to be some large private party going on downstairs - I did toy with gate crashing but a cursory examination indicated that it probably wasnt my scene.
</P>
<p>
I probably had noticed this before and forgotten about it but the Pub has a Cash Point Machine - which could be considered either very public spirited or very cynical depending on your point of view.  There is a pub near us in <a href="http://the-entertainer-online.co.uk/pubs/kings_head.htm">Hastings</a>
that has a cash dispenser but you get a voucher out of it that gives you fifty pence off your next drink too :)
</P>
