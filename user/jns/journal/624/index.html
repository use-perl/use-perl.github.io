<p>Hmm, saturday and sundays journals seem to have gone out of the window.

Well Saturday I did my talk - I had a hangover and gabbled the talk and got it down to about 20 Minutes but it had been the Pub Crawl the night before and so I'm hoping that
everyone else was too hungover to care.  Anyhow the slides of the talk are at http://www.gellyfish.com/yapc_talk/ if anyone should be foolish enough to be interested.

While I am on the subject of slides, I would just like to give a little plug for Magicpoint which is a wonderful Unix presentation tool and just converted the slides for the web without any problems.

Anyhow, the rest of the talks I saw that afternoon was mad stuff by fellow London.pm'ers.  Mark and Richard's "Wax::On, Wax::Off",  Dave's "Perl for the People" and Alex's Generative Music - all good, all entertaining and a kind of indication how well and eclectic the Perl thing is doing in the UK.

The conference was drawing to a close,  Kevin spoke and indicated that next years venue was likely to be between Munich and Paris - I am not sure whether he was entirely joking when he said that the casting vote might be down to London.pm deciding whether paris was more convenient because of the Eurostar or whether Munich was favoured because of the Beer ;} Whoever gets to do it is going to have a lot to live up to next year as the Amsterdam people put on a very well organized conference.

A big thank you really has to go to the Conference Organizers as they really did excel themselves.
 
Anyhow before the end was the auction, Hosted by one Grep McCarrol.   The auction was to turn the in-kind sponsorship from various publishers and individuals into cash that could be used to mop up any small shortfalls from this conference and to bootstrap the next, also apparently some is going to go to fund an advocacy project in the Netherlands which is a damn fine idea in my book.

The Auction was insane and loads of money was raised, but I am sure somebody elses journal has more detail.

Anyhow when the conference really was over, we all went back to the hotel and it settled down to a spot of drinking and hacking,  by this time my brane had really packed in so I tried to avoid the heavy duty hacking and brainstorming, and settled down to drinking .... however I recall having opined that if CPANTS is going to fly then h2xs is going to have to be upgradeable without upgrading Perl itself ...  Mr Schwern says he thought it was a good idea and so er, oh bugger, another thing to do :)

So it was drinking and insanity and drinking and then back to Grep's room for partying and mini-bar raiding and ohmigod I really did have a very bad hangover when I got the cab to the airport in the morning ....
