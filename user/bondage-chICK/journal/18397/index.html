<p>okay about last night ill explain. now i haven't cut myself in a week and one day but last night i almost did. i was so close. i was sitting on my bed with the music playing (atreyu-lipgloss and black) i had the blade pressed against my skin but not hard. it didnt cut nor damage my skin in anyway. i wanted so bad to cut. i just wanted to bleed and feel better. i threw the blade and cryed, i sobbed. i knew that by hurting myself i was hurting others. not alot of others maybe, but i knew my few friends would be mad at me. in perticular john. i promised him that i would try really really really really hard not to cut, i knew he'd be mad at me if i did. i think he's the only thing that kept me from cutting last night. if not the only then it was peyton,eric and john. you guys im trying really hard. i havent cut yet. so dont be mad. i was close but didnt. close but no cigar as some say. thats a stupid saying if you ask me. god its hot in this house. by the way sorry for not calling or answering my phone john i didnt get minutes yet but im getting them today hopefully for sure. i'll call you tonite if its not to late. im still panicing about the history test wendsday too. oh god. im finished with my homework cept hisory which im dreading. okay good bye all. love ya.

With regard to your earlier post saying, "What is autogenerated?" and so on, here's the thing:  this is a site about programming with Perl and people who program with Perl.  Your journal is wildly out of place.  I'd suggest looking at LiveJournal, http://www.livejournal.com/

<p>Bah; let her post!  Noone says you have to read it.  She might even get involved in the Perl community.  Four years from now she might be pulling in the big bucks tuning a DBI program or something, with all the depression of days gone by forgotten.</p>

<h2>you  need some perl in your life!</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Lunchy/">Lunchy</a> on 2004-04-20T13:12:07</h3>
Maybe she should *learn* perl (assuming she hasn't, although...one shouldn't ASSume).  I found perl pretty addictive in the first year or two when I was learning.  It really helped me through some harder times.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br/><br/>On another note, I have a friend who cuts.  I never understood it really, as I'm allergic to pain, but I encourage you to keep up your fight against it, you can beat it.

Hey, sure.  If she's willing to punctuate and capitalize more correctly, I'd even be happy to help her learn.  If not, though, it seems like this is noise.  I know, of course, that I don't speak for everyone...
