<p>today is boring and depressing, i dont even know why i bother writing in this journal. quite pointless if you ask me. because know one ever reads it. lets see today i went for a walk with olivia and i bought handcuffs which are wicked awesome. i got a hello kitty water bottle thingy too. its cooler then it sounds. (luke-warm)and we had lunch at mcdonalds, ew, then we went home well i went home and she went to her home. now im sitting here wishing i were doing something, anything. manda's mom is over protective, nikki i hate, well yeah pretty much. olivia and me already hung out today and it wasnt that fun. so that pretty much leaves me by myself. im over heating in these temperatures and afraid to go outside and get a tan. i like to stay pale. umm yeah im bored and depressed but thats usual right. sometiems i wish someone would find me, and help me, john is trying really hard to help me, and i thank him sooo much for it. havent cut in a week. arent ya proud of me? love you. bye   -andrea</p>
