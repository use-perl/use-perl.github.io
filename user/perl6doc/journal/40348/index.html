<p>After adding all meta ops and contextualizer with associated functions and adding the <a href="http://www.perlfoundation.org/perl6/index.cgi?perl_6_lookup_tablet#escape_sequences">escape sequences</a> too, I'm done so far. Not with Perl 6 but I have achieved for now what I wanted and will turn to <a href="http://kephra.sourceforge.net/site/en/home_news.shtml">Kephra</a> for a while. The next release just needs a hour or two and i got some fresh ideas too. With 568 entries in the <a href="http://www.perlfoundation.org/perl6/index.cgi?perl_6_lookup_tablet">Appendix A</a> and knowing that A-C are in good shape and almost completely n'cync with german version I can leave with good feeling.
<br><br>
Yesterday I also updated <a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl_%28Programmiersprache%29#Perl_5.12">wikipedia article</a> about Perl. A section about 5.12 was missing and the section about current versions needed to be rewritten. So this corner is also cleared.
<br><br>
I use for my dayly work almost only Kephra and I really need some features to ease my doings.
<br><br>
But that was not the odd thing I wanted announce.
<b>attention please</b>.
The thing I'm going to propose is odd because I want it but I'm not willing to do it myself.
<br><br>
My dream is that the TPF wiki is run by a wikisoftware that doesnt suck and is written in perl 6. There is an attempt called november but it stuck since masak does other exciting stuff. I think parsing and rehashing data is the  strength of Perl 5 and more so Perl 6. The second reason for a wiki software written in Perl 6 would be. Perl 6 needs a killer app (odd and unnecessary brutal marketing term). I have a feature set in my mind no other wiki today provides. a desirable software could be for many people the reason to install parrot/Perl 6 in the first place. 
<br><br>
Mediawiki is not bad but its wikisyntax has still some limitations which is compensated by a lot of extention. it gone a bit like C++ plus and has no tags and other modern achievements. Socialtext sucks completely. sorry but it has so many limitantions, its hardly usable as a wiki for coding documentation. also foswiki, thewikiformerlyknownasTwiki is often a pain in the ass. what I need is a wiki where
<ul>
<li> tables and pre areas that aren't inherently ugly</li>
<li> tables and pre areas should contain links and all sorts of text formating</li>
<li> user can change font family and size of different elements, so that there are actually readable</li>
<li> a wiki syntax allows easily to display any character, despite its normal meta meaning</li>
<li> editable article sections</li>
<li> easy spam redo / group redos</li>
<li> readable coloured diffs / no 10 pages display when all was changes are 10 char</li>
<li> searchable history</li>
<li> links with implicit anchors, so i can set in the index a link to the alias term</li>
<li> or  at least link anchors that doesn't do a implicit "\n"</li>
<li> source code highlighting</li>
<li> ... many more</li>
</ul>
Yes the third benefit would be that just my life would be easier. But i realized many of these features doesn't require much coding. Its just my dream may it will come true in this world.</p>

Please take a good look at ikiwiki before designing a new wiki. It has some very good ideas.

<h2>Why not overhaul Socialtext?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/daxim/">daxim</a> on 2010-05-10T12:20:32</h3>
Spending time to modernise ST pays off immediately and will also be overall more beneficial in the long term compared with designing and coding a  software from scratch.

not necessarily. there is a open source version, but its also lot of effort to understand a large system. and if you work your on your own when we want to tweak the wiki syntax and the overall rendering. maybe its worth a try. i look at <a href="http://github.com/socialtext" title="github.com">http://github.com/socialtext</a github.com>. but there is also the problem i cant find any admin.

One does not need to understand every detail of the whole system in order to change smaller parts.
<p>
The homepage of the open source version is <a href="http://www.socialtext.net/open/" title="socialtext.net">http://www.socialtext.net/open/</a socialtext.net>.
</p><p>
What do you need an admin for?</p>

currently i cant reach an admin of perlfoundation.org<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:(<br/><br/>it would have the advantage to use all the existing highter modules. there is even one for perl 6 that padre uses. but on other hand the changes i need would change the wiki markup syntax. i dont believe socialtext would allow that. so we maybe need a parser for wikimedia markup and extend it. i think it would touch a lot of subsystems such as the diff module, revamp search engine, add links to the history. i dont think you need that much code to implement it. but you have to understand much of the inner workings.

<h2>Socialtext 4.0 Hosted?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/audreyt/">audreyt</a> on 2010-05-15T01:10:26</h3>
<p>
Hi! I agree Socialtext 2.0 really is subpar.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)
</p><p>
However, I'm coincidentally working for Socialtext, and am one of the main hackers of its Wiki Syntax!
</p><p>
I wonder if we can set up a Free-50 hosted account for the @cpan.org domain, and import the existing Perl 6 Wiki content: See <a href="http://www.socialtext.com/products/free50.php" title="socialtext.com">http://www.socialtext.com/products/free50.php</a socialtext.com> for details.
</p><p>
The gist is that all writers (not readers) need to be a CPAN author, which may have the nice dual side-effect of encouraging CPAN authorship and reducing spam.
</p><p>
The Socialtext 4.0 version has considerably more markup, including proper table and spreadsheet support, as well as JavaScript-based per-page plugins, so if there's a JS-based highlighter we can easily use it.
</p><p>
If you'd be agreeable to such an arrangement, I can help importing the existing Wiki content to a hosted space just to see how it would look like, and work on lifting the 50-editor restriction if you think it makes sense.
</p><p>
Thoughts?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)
