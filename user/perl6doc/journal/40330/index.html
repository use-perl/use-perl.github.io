<p><a href="http://perl-zeitung.toad.at/ausgaben.html">Its a magazine</a> most of you here would not read, bacause it explaines most of the time basic perl stuff. But many of you, I suppose, care that there is a beginner friendly Perl publication, done by the passionate Gernot Havranek. So do I. Thatswhy i wrote 2 articles for this isssue. About Perl 5 references and one about Perl 6. Also Perl beginner have a right to have a broad overview what is perl 6 about and how it is going. I think I never summarized it in such simple terms before. Maybe that spark your interest? :) But its written in German, as the name suggest.</p>

<h2>Basics ...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/janus/">janus</a> on 2010-04-28T10:02:28</h3>
<p>... don't necessarily mean it's only for beginners<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)</p><p>On IRC for example, it's really interesting how different people explain Perl.</p><p>Spreading knowledge on basic topics common to the experienced programmer is fun because of a few reasons:<br>
&nbsp; - Training: Specialize in whatever area one is able to apply and answer the specific problem/question<br>
&nbsp; - Communication: Learning to speak in a language even people without any idea of programming can understand<br>
&nbsp; - Marketing: Presenting Perl, modules and projects coming with an answer for the question</p><p>Well, that's at least my view and experience. After some years helping in this conscious manner I haven't lost my interest - the opposite happened... now I only need the time to do more.</p>



<h2>yes,</h2>

basics != only for beginner,
thatswhy i whought to translate that too, but i think i will be molded into tablet 2.
<br> <br>
i fully agree to your post even if i would put more the joy foreward, silently hoping the rest will come as well<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
