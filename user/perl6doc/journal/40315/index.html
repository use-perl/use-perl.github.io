<p>All types(mutable immutable and undefined) are now included in the <a href="http://www.perlfoundation.org/perl6/index.cgi?perl_6_index_tablet">Appendix A</a>. whats the big deal copying some lines from the synopses? well beside the proper linking it takes me some time to read and understand all that: "What is the difference between Bit and Bool?", and so on. I also try to understand in which schemes these names are chosen. The match method produces a Match-object. Things like that are easy, but there are a lot of interlocking concepts in Perl 6. The more you do the roundtrip, the more you realize an complexity, that in my opinion is necessary.<br/><br/><br><br>
I remember the Perl 6 talk Allison held in Dresden some years ago, when I attended my first German Perl Workshop. There she mentioned the waterbed theory of complexity, where everything in the language has to cover the real complexity of the problem. If it is more complex, you added artificial complexity, if you make less complex you add artificial complexity elsewhere. Tracing the syntactical structure of Perl 6 I'm often reminded to that talk. Because i literally can see Larry sweating, trying hard to get this complexity issue right. After all the chapter of the Perl 6 tablets should reflect a deeper understanding of all that, which will come soon as tablet number 2. <br/><br/><br><br>.
Until then, the lists and tables of all operators, buildins and methods will grow and grow.
<br><br>.<br/><br/>The kind mbrends++ mentioned to me, that maybe I should do monthly summaries, about what happend in the TPF wiki. I'm much inclined to that idea.</p>
