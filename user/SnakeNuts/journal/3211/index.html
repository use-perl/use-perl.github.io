<p>Practise, practise, practise.
<p>
I've been out of it too long. I need practise. And working here on the user-interface is all well and good, but I still need something for the hours I'm not sleeping. So enter 'UserBoard' (okay, lame name, but it's exactly what it is.)
<p>
I've been a member of a couple of Play-By-Email games for some time now, and up to a couple of weeks ago all was peachy. But now rumors of our ListGroup server going commercial (I won't say names, but it starts with a 'Y' and ends in '!'...) and us having to pay for their services has made me decide to look at other angles.
<p>
And I'm a programmer, so what angle do I look at? Right: Making my own server. And not only that, but writing my own server from scratch.
<p>
Sure, I've looked at all the available ListServers out there, but they don't do it for me. That and the fact that I just need something to <i>make</i>.
<p>
So, I've begun UserBoard, and I've decided to take a marginally different approach to the other's I've found, and that is to concentrate on the web-interface from the start, and assume (as is the case right now for the groups I know) that nobody uses the e-mail commands to do their administration.
<p>
And version 1 will be just that: a first version, to be improved on (or totally rewritten) as needs be.
<p>
So, I've set up the SourceForge group (UserBoard) and am writing a first draft of the functional design as a guidebook how I think it should look at the end...
<p>
Wish me luck!</p>
