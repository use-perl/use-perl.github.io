<p>Well, two months have sped past and my tenure at <a href="http://www.interapy.nl">Interapy</a> is almost at an end. It's been... interesting. I had hoped for a more challenging time, but I was slowly pushed back to writing HTML pages. At first I used the Template Toolkit, but at the end it was decided to use the CGI module. (It's still used from within the TT-code, but I think it will be pulled back into the main perl code shortly after my departure)
<p>
Still, It was a new start and a very interesting place to work, especially the matter that they workied with. I have gotten a better look on what psychologists do.
<p>
On to the next job. But the question-mark in the title shows exactly what I currently know about that. Nothing has been said or (what I suspect) done about finding a new project. Luckily it won't affect my pay, so I will lie back and see what comes after easter.
<p>
So a happy easter to you all, and see you on the flipside.</p>
