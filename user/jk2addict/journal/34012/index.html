<p>Dead to me I say. Dead. Why do people use Apache any more, other than because "X doesn't run on lighttpd"?<br/><br/>In a week of tinkering rather than working on crap I should be working on, I decided to upgrade to MovableType4. I run 3.x as pure CGI. It's slow, but 4 was horrible slow as a cgi. So, I did the next logical thing, run it under FastCGI.<br/><br/>I already had it installed and working under Apache. For whatever reason, things didn't get much better and I was sicking of playing config games. So I installed Lighhttpd just for giggles.<br/><br/>I'm mostly done converting everything over to use it, and running MT4 under FCGI. Now the only thing running on Apache is Subversion access, and even then, I can just mod.proxy it through lighttpd.<br/><br/>So, why do people use Apache again? It seems like a brick doorstop if you're really not doing something like deep n dirty mod_perl or some such stuff.<br/><br/>Always late to the party.</p>

<h2>Restarting</h2>

(disclaimer #1: I'm a developer, not a sysadmin; disclaimer #2 this is <a href="http://use.perl.org/comments.pl?sid=36389&amp;cid=56720" title="perl.org">anecdote not data</a perl.org>)<br><br>I've never experienced an Apache crash - ever.  I helped admin a RoR/FastCGI app running under lighttpd on an Xserves and had to restart lighttpd at least weekly due to crashes.  Thank goodness that RoR app was for internal use only.<br>

Maybe RoR was the problem, not lighty.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)

Haha.  Rails bashing is oh so funny.<br><br>When my Catalyst app crashes, it never brings apache down with it in my experience.  If RoR can take down lighttpd over a FastCGI connection, then that's even worse news than lighty taking itself down.<br><br>The webserver should be agnostic to the technology at the other end of its FastCGI pipe.

I feel sorry for Rails bashers. It is just too easy. They should pick something harder to bash.

<h2>Troubleshooting?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/vek/">vek</a> on 2007-08-07T15:02:29</h3>
So you didn't take the time to troubleshoot it properly and don't like editing config files.  So therefore Apache must be dead and no one should use it?  Huh?

Chill. I'm sure I could've wasted all night looking for the problem. But why? I don't really need Apache. I'd surmise most people don't. My mod_perl/xml/xslt/AxKit days have long since past.
