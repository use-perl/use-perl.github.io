<p>I woke up happy to be an American. All politics, finger pointing, commercials and accusations aside, we made history last night. The first African-American president [elect].<br/><br/>It almost brings a tear to my every time I think about it. For the first time, I fell like there's a chance we can bring people in this country back together again and do great things.</p>

<p>I did not vote for Obama but he *is* now my President. I am more than willing to let him do his thing. Some of his policies scare the bejeebus out of me but let's see what happens. There are even ideas of his that I am totally vehemently against but let's see what happens.</p>

What happens if his scary ideas actually work?

<p>Does that really need an answer? If they work then I was wrong. I can accept that.</p>

That's cool. A lot of people can't accept that, myself included sometimes<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

<p>I'm living outside the US, and I feel similarly. Although a lot of the reaction seems like hype... it does suddenly seem less embarrassing to be American. The goodwill most of the world had for the US after the September 11th attacks was completely pissed away, but it seems to be back a bit.</p><p>Many non-Americans here stayed up till 2am watching the election stuff or going to election-night parties and are thrilled that Obama won. I'll admit that I don't completely understand how they can get so excited about another country's presidential elections, though. I wonder, actually, if I were alive during the 60s, say, would I have noticed how great a time it seems to've retrospectively been; is this a time like that? I don't know if Obama will keep his campaign promises, but I'm not sure if that's as important as the feeling of hope that many people have now, if it motivates them to make things better. Or something.</p>
