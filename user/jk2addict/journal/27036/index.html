<p>I really despise houework. Maybe it's just the crap I have to do specifically, or the history behind it.<br/><br/>About 2 years ago, we bought our current house. It's about 8 years old now. Every house has something that you just absolutely hate about it. For me, it's the damn windows that cause my blood pressure to rise 1000 points in the winter.<br/><br/>The house came with wonderful wood floors, solid oak doors, and oak framed Pella casement windows. Once winter hit, I had a problem I never thought I'd have in a house that new. The windows had bad condensation on the inside, so much so that it was freezing to the window, and to the wood frame between the frame and the seals.<br/><br/>I've watched it all happen twice, and everyone has theories about it, but no one has raw working answers. The last thing I want to think about doing is replaceing rotted windows at the 10 year mark.<br/><br/>So this week I've been cleaning around the windows when I took the screens out, getting rid of all the crap in there that may be blowing the airflow to the breathder holes. Saturday, I get to lightly sand all of their inner sills and slap a layer of UV rates polyeurothane. The builders used regular old poly, and now it's cracking and flaking.<br/><br/>One of the theories I've heard is that moisture is soaking into the wook that way, leading to the humidity issue between the inner and outer panes causing my problem.<br/><br/>The other theory is of course that the house has negative pressure (due to it being too well insulated), leading to cold air being sucked in past the seals and clashing with the inner air, causing the condensation and freezind. When they installed the furnace, they put the AC fan blower on HIGH, and the furnace on LOW. I moved the heater  to MEDIUM in the last month of winder last year. IT seems to help, but that could have been nothing.<br/><br/>So, to recap, I hate my windows, and I hate having to work on them when I could be programming. Sigh.<br/><br/>At least the old crib had vinyl clad aluminum. I didn't have to give sa shit about those. Sigh.</p>
