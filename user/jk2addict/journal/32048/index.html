<p>I love CPAN Testers. Someone has to do it.
I hate broken CPAN Tester libraries (Updated). They render false positives for no good reason.<br/><br/>For example...<a href="http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.cpan.testers/390076">this report</a>...<br/><br/>These events don't jive:<br/><br/><pre>[ERROR] [Fri Dec 22 08:47:44 2006] This distribution depends on Handel, but the latest version of Handel on CPAN (0.33) doesn't satisfy the specific version dependency (1.0).

Sigh. If the prereq is 1.0, and there is no 1.0, why in the fsck is it trying to use 0.33? Just bail damnit. Don't go on installing a version that is fails the prereq version check.<br/><br/>Same deal for this:<br/><br/><pre>
[ERROR] [Fri Dec 22 08:47:44 2006] This distribution depends on Rose::DB, but the latest version of Rose::DB on CPAN (0.731) doesn't satisfy the specific version dependency (0.732). You may have to resolve this dependency manually.
[MSG] [Fri Dec 22 08:47:44 2006] Module 'Handel::Storage::RDBO' requires 'Rose::DB' version '0.732' to be installed 
</pre><br/><br/>Yet, it continues to install a lesser version. Heavy sigh.<br/><br/>I wish there were a way to nuke these kinds of things from CPAN Testers all together.</p>

<h2>Not necesarily CPAN Testers</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Alias/">Alias</a> on 2007-01-02T20:54:00</h3>
To some degree this is problems with CPAN's recursion logic rather than CPAN Testers as such.<br><br>Of course, another problem is that you can't simply require every single tester to upgrade, because we miss testing cases.



<h2>I just wished it worked, period.</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jjore/">jjore</a> on 2007-01-02T21:35:14</h3>
I can't tell that CPAN testers works because I never get carbon copied on failures. It's spiffy that failures get sent to an email list and there's an RSS feed but those don't really work. I'd have to subscribe to the email list to get them in my inbox and I find my RSS reader in firefox resets its idea of what's new after I clear its cache.<br><br>So... as far as I can tell the thing plain old isn't useful. It's kind of annoying, I wish it worked but it never seems to get there.



<h2>Thanks for singling me out!</h2>

<p>I have no control over what CPANPLUS is doing!</p>
