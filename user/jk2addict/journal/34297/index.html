<p>No wonder this causes depression. I feel like an AA 12 stepper (no offense to them).<br/><br/>"Hi. My name is Chris. I'm 6'4", 346lbs, fat and addicted to food."<br/><br/>Maybe this insurance thing is the kick in the ass I need to change that. My problem is two fold: I eat too much (quantity) and I don't exercise (sit behind a computer 16 hours a day). Yes, I would say I'm addicted to food.<br/><br/>I don't smoke. I barely drink. I just like the taste of good food. The funny thing is, I don't really eat all the bad crap I used to eat. I hit burgers/fries about once every 1-2 months, and most lunches are some form of salad, soup, fish/chicken. We stopped buying cheese at home, because cheese is the devil.<br/><br/>Clearly, exercise is the answer. Now it's a matter of mustering up the will power.</p>

The "what" is a tough one. I mean, what's bad about: green beans, corn, rice, chicken, veggie soup, tuna, apples, pears, bananas, carrots, eggs, oatmeal?<br><br>That's what I eat most of the time. That's not nearly as bad as: pizza, burgers, fries, McDicks, Burger Schlong and the rest.<br><br>The how is still a mystery to me, but I've started eat less, more often. Breakfast, oatmeal usually, with a snack every 1-2 hours...usually raisins/dried bananas/hony oat bar or something with less lunch. Dinner is a free for all of salad/veggies with soup or rice sometimes.<br><br>Like I said, it's not so much what I eat but how much...but more over, the lack of exercise is probably the killer rather than what I'm eating.

But yeah, I'd say that exercise is probably the most important thing for you to integrate into your daily routine. I suggest (indoor) swimming or cycling.

Swimming means getting half naked...and the only good place is right down the road from work. There will be no half naked in front of work hotties.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br><br>This is what I have so far:<br><br>2-15 minute power walks on the indoor circle here at work...like two steps per second power walk.<br><br>about 15 minutes of bike time at home. That's about all I can muster for now without pissing off my back.<br><br>Actually, I'd love to hit the local center after work a couple nights a week, but I'm weak... I need an exercise partner...and the wife is never home from work on time. I need to find someone at work that can tolerate me slowing them down.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

If you have money...I recommend a bowflex. It has helped me a lot and I can integrate it into my schedule. It comes with a schedule and a menu plan. I lost 15lbs before the house (see below). It is good because it is a resistance work out.<br><br>The "what" is tough. I would look at something like the "abs diet" to see what they consider bad.<br><br>- sugars *mostly bad<br>- breads *mostly bad<br><br>I know those for sure...cheese isn't necessarily bad unless you go to excess with it.<br><br>We are fixing to start back up in a month. We are buying a new home and I am a stress eater so I dumped everything until after the closing.

That's about all I can muster for now without pissing off my back.</div> What I was taught is that you need to work out at least half an hour to really get your body to start burning fat (anything shorter will just burn sugars). That's why I suggested cardio exercises (swimming and cycling). The power walk you are doing seems fast, but to burn fat you don't need high intensity exercises, just longer duration ones. Maybe you can change your two 15-minute power walks to a single 45-minute moderate walk?

Ok, changing how you eat is a big deal.<br><br>I was diagnosed as a type 2 diabetic over a year ago. Six years ago I was 245-255, five years ago I was 210. That was mostly to me starting to eat less and getting lots of sleep.<br><br>After my diagnosis I followed the diet they recommened. It was mostly to limit the amount of carbohydrates and when I ate them.<br><br>I also started walking at least 20 minutes a day.<br><br>I got down to 175 and off the medication I was prescribed.<br><br>Food is food. I can still eat anything I want. I just can't eat a lot of certain foods.<br><br>For now I am keeping on top of things by following a diet and trying to walk 20 minutes every day.<br><br>Changing how you eat, how much you eat and exercising is a very difficult thing. Having a new kid helped with my motivation but it was ultimately a choice I had to make.<br><br>A friend of a friend is losing weight and what she said recently is probably a good way to look at weight loss, "it took me a life time to gain this weight and it will take a long time to lose it."<br><br>I've put some weight back on but I'm still in control of things (I think, we'll see at my next checkup) but I feel that I am still committed to this lifelong project.
