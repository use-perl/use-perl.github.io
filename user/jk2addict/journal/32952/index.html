<p>So here we are. Three months into development. Mango isn't done. I suck. I'll blame life, laziness, form frustrations and a general dislike for 'solutions' instead of 'frameworks'. A lot of good code was written, but not enough apparently. All is not lost though. I have no intention of abandoning ship, especially after receiving a grant from The Perl Foundation.<br/><br/>As part of moving forward, I need to take a fresh start of sorts, revamp the plan and be better about exposing progress in ways the community can at least see, if not use. To that effect, I've put up a blog on the new url @ http://mangoframework.com/blog/. It is there that I plan on posting more often about development issues, progress, update, etc until things are done and we can put a real site in place.<br/><br/>Next on the list, I'm going to branch, clean out trunk, and start recommitting things in phases/layers. It will be those phases which I plan to revisit, clean up code, write tests, write pod and generally complete as usable parts before moving onto the next. Those layers are:<br/><br/>  - Database Schema
  - Providers
  - Catalyst Base Classes
  - Catalyst Application (Base+generated app)
  - Design/Style
  - Web 2.0<br/><br/>Most of the code in the first 3 is mostly done and working. It just needs good docs, test, and glue. Making the app more framework like instead of an end solution will take some work. I have designers I'll need to bribe, and Web 2.0/AJAX bits still give me an angine just thinking about them.<br/><br/>Hopefully, installing some more regiment into the process will move things along again. Otherwise, I'll be pleading for mercy in another 3 months. :-)</p>

Completing a grant is never straight forward, and always tougher than you thought.<br><br>But if nothing else, the fact you have the grant does seem to keep pushing you (or at least me) forwards...
