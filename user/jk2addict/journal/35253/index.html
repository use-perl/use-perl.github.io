<p>I'm posting this so maybe someone else will learn from my pain. I just spent an hour trying to figure out why Directory::Scratch and File::Temp were creating temp directorys in $ENV{TMP} on one test script under Win32, and in the cwd() on another script.<br/><br/>Of course, the answer is that one test has -T, and one does not. With tainting on of course, there is no ENV (TMP/TEMP), so the cwd() is used. It makes sense, but in a way feels like a bug.<br/><br/>At the very least, maybe that should be a big fat warning on the File::Temp pod.</p>

If you do it soon enough, it will end up it 5.10.1!<br><br>



<h2>DWIM or RTFM?</h2>

It says pretty clearly that it creates a directory in tmpdir -- and references File::Spec.  And File::Spec clearly cites tainting.  What's so surprising?<br><br>I think you need to ask yourself why you're running tests in taint mode.  Are you testing something that specifically involves taint mode?  If so, great.  If not -- and you're doing it "just because", then you're setting yourself up to be surprised when the computer goes ahead and does exactly what you asked it to do.<br><br>I used to see this a lot on Windows where a test file uses taint mode and calls something that eventually invokes a fork -- which causes a segfault on 5.8.8.  (E.g. try "perl -Te fork" on 5.8.8 to see it.  It seems to be fixed on 5.10.0 thankfully.)  I just think that taint mode in tests files is a bad idea unless one really needs it.<br><br>-- dagolden

Well, RTFM is a funny thing...the farther away from the module you're using, the less he lack RTFMing is the users fault. As a user of Directory::Scratch, should I have to RTFM three to four levels deep to find one mention of tempdir producing two different results when in and out of taint mode?<br><br>As far as running tests under taint mode, I do it for one reason only: to sooner find our what doesn't work under taint mode. There is nothing more frustrating than trying to turn on Taint in Apache/ModPerl instance, just to find out that your module, or ever worse, that some core module not only acts differently under taint mode, but usually just plain dies.<br><br>Far more things that run under -T will run without -T, but I dare say the reverse isn't as true.
