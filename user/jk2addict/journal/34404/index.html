<p>Well, it's been a week and half into my two week time window of making the insurance company happy. Luckily for me, I hit 339.7 yesterday morning. I was at 346/7 when I started, and needed to hit 342.<br/><br/>Heavy sigh of relief. Next goal 330 on my way to 300. And I feel better. Most of that is probably attitude, but I'll take it.<br/><br/>What I did was this:<br/><br/>1. Changed my overeating from normal foods to mostly fruit/veggies. You can't get fat on those. Just can't happen for a non diabetic.<br/><br/>2. Half my bread/pasta intake. Don't avoid them completely, just eat less when I have it.<br/><br/>3. (2) 15 minute power walks during the work breaks (120 Steps Per Minute), which is hauling for a long legged 6'4" guy.<br/><br/>4. Nightly 10-15 minute bike time in the house, uptempo most week nights.<br/><br/>5. No non fruit sugars: candy bars, ice cream, shakes, coke, icing, etc.<br/><br/>That's about it. All in all, it's still a lazy lifestyle, but with some exercise in it.<br/><br/>I have designated the last day of each month as 'eat bad things' day. I hear pizza calling my name this month. :-)</p>

That is really good for 2 weeks. I think the monthly  treat is a great idea. Congrats and Good luck.

Sounds like you are doing great.<br><br>You can get fat on fruits and veggies if you don't balance the calories you eat with the calories you expend.<br><br>Keep up the good work.<br><br>Someday you will be carrying something heavy and think, "I used to carry this all the time."<br><br>I had that thought when I was carrying my 30 pound son upstairs. What was really scary is that to get  to the weight I was a few years ago I would have been carrying two of him.<br><br>It's kind of a good feeling and not a bad motivator.

<p>The problem with most weight loss motivators is you get to experience them only after the hardest part of the work is done.</p>

Unfortunately, that's why I think weight loss is mostly mental. Once you make the conscious decisions that produce the physical results you are most of the way there.<br><br>Because it is really a very long term project/discipline it doesn't suit our instincts. We are very good at assessing short time things (Will this lion eat me if I climb out of this tree?), but horrible about middle to long term (will eating a double cheeseburger everyday really hurt me that much?).
