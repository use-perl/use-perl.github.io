<p>So, I was sitting behind the laptop writing tests for the compat layer in Handel 1.0 and it happened:<br/><br/><pre>
   nmake test
   big list of test names.."line too long"
</pre><br/><br/>Well, I guess that's one problem to have, too many test files under Windows.<br/><br/>After googling, I came upon <a href="http://lists.open-bio.org/pipermail/bioperl-l/2004-December/017688.html">this post</a> about the issue, and decided to upgrade my EU::MM install. The upgrade didn't fix my problem until I removed this from my Makefile.PL:<br/><br/><pre>
    test  => { TESTS => join ' ', (glob("t/*.t t/*/*.t"))}
</pre><br/><br/>It's a good thing I decided not to use subdirectories for tests, or I would be screwed right now.<br/><br/>Now the real question is, what happens to the testers runs when I slap a "use ExtUtils::MakeMaker 6.25" at the top of my Makefile?</p>

When you slap a 'use' statement in your script,<br>running 'perl Makefile.PL' will just die with an error,<br>and that's the end of the install process<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:(<br><br>Safest bet is to bundle it in an inc/ directory. You<br>could look at Module::Install to see how to do this.<br><br>You *could* add to your Prereq_pm, but that doesn't<br>save you from writing a Makefile with the old EU::MM<br>that you had loaded when executing this, so you'd have<br>to do clever Makefile trickery with a preamble section<br>*shudder*

Since EU::MM 6.30 is from May of 2005, I'm terribly worried about the testers.<br/><br/>Bundling is a PITA, and frankly, the inc/ crap that M::I pulls is just another form of disaster with versioning.<br/><br/>Since most testers aren't win32, this shouldn't be an issue. I guess we'll find our here as soon as I chuck out another release.

<h2>How many tests... who cares?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/bart/">bart</a> on 2006-08-10T17:40:43</h3>
As people find ways to avoid typing the exact number  of tests they have (or at least, in your case, try), I don't quite understand why the Test modules insist on you counting them.

This <i>is</i> peculiar.  By my count you have only 98 tests under <i>t/</i>.  In ExtUtils::ModuleMaker, I have over 2000 tests arranged in the same two-tier structure you are using.  Yet I have never had a problem installing it on Windows, nor have I received any complaint about such a problem.  And I am using exactly the same line in my Makefile.PL that you were using.
