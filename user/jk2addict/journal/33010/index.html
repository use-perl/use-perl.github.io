<p><p>
As part of an effort to release early-release often and show public progress, I'm pleased to announce the first alpha release of Mango.
</p>
<p>
This is a developer preview release that contains core modules only [no web bits]. This includes the schema classes, the provider classes and the result/object classes. Test coverage is around 98% and the pod needs some more glossing over. Files should be available on a CPAN.
</p>
<p>
Mango relies on a versions of Handel and DBIx::Class that are not yet released. You will need DBIx::Class-current from the <a href="http://dev.catalystframework.org/repos/bast/branches/DBIx-Class-current/">current branch in the Bast repository</a> and the latest version of Handel from <a href="http://svn.handelframework.com/CPAN/Handel/branches/DBIC-1.0/">the DBIC-1.0 branch</a> in the Handel repository.
</p>
<p>
Once all of the kinks/feature/docs/tests are worked out of this set of files, I'll start releasing more layers of code. The next round will be the Catalyst Base classes used in Mango. See <a href="http://mangoframework.com/blog/announcements/tabula-rasa/">this post</a> for more information on the breakdown of releases and the Mulligan I've taken.
</p></p>

But you shouldn't really be putting code on the CPAN that can't be installed with deps from the CPAN.<br><br>CPAN is downstream from the various repositories, you shouldn't really be pointing back upstream to unstable (in the sense they are changing) versions of dependencies.<br><br>How about you get Handle and DBIx::Class to do dev releases too<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

"You see Bob, it's not that I'm lazy. It's that I just don't care".<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br><br>Handel 0.99_17 <b>is</b> 1.0, that is waiting on DBIx::Class 0.08. I could change the prereq to use 0.99_17, but there's no way to change Handel to say  'use current' until there's an 0.08 on CPAN. They're not unstable versions, just unreleased because the dep chain just can't be fulfilled right now.<br><br>Personally, I'm ok with prereq-ing versions that aren't yet on CPAN. That means that can't be automatically installed, and that's exactly what I want in this case.<br><br>The main goals are, release early, if for no other reason that people can use it (even people who can't grok using svn co to get sources) and get it out into world in case I die.<br><br>In any event, I'll poke around and see if Handel works with the DBIx::Class 0.07999_02 that's on CPAN rather than current. If it does, I'll upload a new version with real prereq version numbers.<br><br>And it's Handel, not Handle damnit.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br>Handel Handle Handel Handle Handel Handle. Of course I always type use FileHandel.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-(
