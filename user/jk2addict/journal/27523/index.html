<p>I've been running Ubuntu Linux solid for about a month now. I've also got FreeBSD servers about the house, and of course Windows XP was my game rig and where I did the bulk of my perl development. I figured it it worked on windows first, *nix would be easier than the other way around. But I digress...<br/><br/>I've always used Textpad in windows. It has what I like. Per-language highlighting and tab settings (spaces in perl, tabs in HTML, etc). Configurable encodings and line endings per language. UTF BOM support, per language.<br/><br/>When I first started using Ubuntu, there was the simple Text Editor in Gnome. It works, but line endings and tabs vs/ spaces get out of hand. Emacs and vi are out of the question. They make my ears bleed. Everything else I tried was either slow and too on-configurable.<br/><br/>Then along came SciTE. It's cross platform. It's configurable. It get's out of my way...And it doesn't make my ears bleed.<br/><br/>Now all I need to do is get my windows version and my *nix version to share the same properties files on my USB mem stick, and I'm golden.<br/><br/>Life is good.</p>

I use it on Windows all the time. I wish it was on OS X though. I like Textmate (and BBEdit) but to have it on all the systems I use would be nice.

Actually, there is an OSX port. <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/atl/tex/" title="mac.com">http://homepage.mac.com/atl/tex/</a mac.com><br/><br/>I think once OSX got X11 in 10.3, it just works. It's probably even in Fink by now.

I should have said as a "native" app. I do not run X11 on my iBook.
