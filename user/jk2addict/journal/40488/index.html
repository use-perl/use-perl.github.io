<div class="span8">
<p>I finally got around to installing perlbrew, 4 flavors of perl and updating some modules for recent perls. I've been sending a lot of email test reports lately.<br/><br/>Last night I got the email from bitbucket about CPAN Testers 2.0 and the death of sending reports via email with wiki links/instructions on how to setup .cpanreports/config.ini for a metabase id/transport via HTTP.<br/><br/>This is all well and good, but it feels wrong to me. I use CPAN::Mini. The point of which is partly to have CPAN when you're not online. The same reason I use git. With SMTP emails I could just queue up test reports in the local postifx and they would get delivered later when I'm online.<br/><br/>Now, that's is no more. I'm forced to be online to send HTTP reports. Seems like a bad idea. NOw, the only thing I can do is toggle off reporting when I'm offline, which really means I'll hate doing that and just turn off reporting all together.<br/><br/>Why did reports via email have to go away?</p>

<p>... we can add offline support for http without TOO much difficulty.</p>

<p>I guess that is progress. We have gone from supporting offline reports now to supporting offline reports in the future and all we have to do is wait from someone to write code.</p>

<p>Yes, that is progress. The servers running the mail load for CPAN Testers 1.0 could not keep up, and the machines are graciously donated and the system administration is a volunteer effort. They could not afford to continue providing services to Testers 1.0; the mail pipe had to be turned off. This is why Testers 2.0 was designed &#8211; not because some people got an itch to engage in architecture astronautics or arbitrarily decided that email was pass&#xe9;. Whatever you think of the new system, the old one is going to stop working, no ifs or buts.</p><p>If you ask me, a system that will continue operating clearly beats one that is about to stop.</p>

<p>Oh, and the people who built Testers 2.0 put in a <em>lot</em> of overtime to ship it in time before the Testers 1.0 kill date.</p>

<p>Sure, caching offline doesn't NEED email. But emails servers have been doing it since the dawn of time. So now we have to reinvent the wheel.</p>

<p>E-mail was too complex here - processing of e-mails requires much more resources than processing of CPAN reports. So requirement to drop e-mail was not invented by cpantesters - it came from cpantesters "hosting" - perl.org.</p>

<h2>E-Mail or not...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/janus/">janus</a> on 2010-08-10T07:42:48</h3>
<p>... but indeed there has to be a way to collect logs offline.<br>That's what we use in OpenBSD to gather reports automatically for the modules in the ports tree.</p><p>So basically the same argument, except from another perspective.</p>

&lt;sarcasm&gt; Hurray! More complexity! &lt;sarcasm&gt;<br><br>Thanks for the link!<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)
