<p>I think I should get this out of the way now rather than after the fact. :-)<br/><br/>As some of you may know, I've <a href="http://today.icantfocus.com/blog/mvc-marathon/">embarked on a little trip</a> to create a small app in the popular mvc frameworks. So far, it's been an interesting and eye opening experience for me as a current Catalyst/DBIC user. I get to experience what it's like to be a new user in those frameworks and compare that to what I know about my experience with Catalyst/DBIC.<br/><br/>Let me be clear about this. I love Perl. Catalyst and Chained() totally rocks, and DBIC is the best ORM I've used in terms of completely flexibility.<br/><br/>With that said, using blog posts, emails and prodding on IRC, there are going to be some points over the next few months where I plan on being completely brash about where I think Cat/DBIC lack compared to the new user experience or those other frameworks. I've already started a few times, and I'm sure I've already flipped a few peoples rant bit to 1.<br/><br/>Remember, it's not a personal attack on anyone. I know it's easy to take it that way when your one of the core or other devs who made it what it is today. It's also not my intention to point the finger and walk away. I sincerely hope that out of this comes some initiatives to fill in the gaps and round the edges and I very much hope to be involved in those things.<br/><br/>Now we return you to your regularly scheduled afternoon nap.</p>

<p>I don't use either Catalyst or DBIC, but I certainly look forward to a frank discussion of your experiences.</p><p>Well done in advance...</p>
