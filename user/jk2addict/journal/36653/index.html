<p>The plan was simple: spend a week in Minneapolis, meetup with autarch, spend a lot of time at the Bombay Bistro and stroll around town.<br/><br/>What really happened was:<br/><br/>Saturday:
Train from Cleveland to Chicago went great. Train from Chicago to St. Paul was 4 hours late because of the tornadoes, trees, storms and flash flooding.<br/><br/>Midway into that 4 hours in Wisconsin we find out from her sisters that her mom went into the hospital.<br/><br/>Sunday:
Wake up. Mom is moving to a normal room, should be fine. Relatively safe procedure mid week. We decide to stay. Sisters have things taken care of.<br/><br/>Eat some Bombay. Hit Mall of America and see Zohan. Get phone call that things got worse. No flights till 4pm next day. Driving is as long as train and rent a car opens later than train would leave. Call Amtrak and switch tickets from following Saturday to Monday.<br/><br/>Monday:
Heading home. Minneapolis to Chicago went just fine. Freight train derailment outside of Toledo, Ohio.<br/><br/>Tuesday:
6 hours later than scheduled, we're finally home. Mom is better, again. The wife headed to the hospital while I head to work. Saving my time for if things go really downhill. Turn on computer video card is dead.<br/><br/>
For the 1 day I spent out and about in Minneapolis, I liked it. I dig the lite rail. Any town with a decent metro is ok by me. I really was looking forward to that week of lunch buffet at the Bombay Bistro. :-(</p>
