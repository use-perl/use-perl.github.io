<div class="span8">
<p>I haven't decided if this is real human made spam, or just a smart spam to module authors on CPAN. What makes it questionable (other than its nature) is that it's sent to my cpan email address; which is not the address I use in Handel..although it is the one lists when you view my CPAN ID...<br/><br/><pre>
Christopher,<br/><br/>I just came across your recent Handel module on CPAN and would be interested
in speaking with you about it among other things. I would like to get to
know you better as a software engineer and understand better about your
background with Perl development. Is there a good time for us to talk in the
next couple days?<br/><br/>I work with Core Search Group. We are an extremely focused IT Search and
Recruit firm. We concentrate on very unique permanent development
situations. Our clients build cutting edge distributed and infrastructure
systems with Perl Java and C/C++ and are leaders in the Technology world. <br/><br/>How is Core Search Group superior to traditional IT staffing companies? <br/><br/>Tighter focus.  We network with and represent the top software development
talent in the US, the UK and other parts of the world, period. 
 
We only work with growing, expanding software development organizations that
are pushing the limits of available performance out of a particular
technology. 
 
You're not shooting your resume into a black hole.  We build and cultivate a
database of the best developers in the US, and other countries and give you
access to jobs that are not otherwise on the Internet or being worked by
other recruiters.  You will hear from us again. 
 
I am not necessarily currently trying to recruit you for any of our open
positions. However, there could definitely be a specific one that could be
of high interest to you. Basically what I propose is to begin a relationship
that we can keep going over the years. This would begin with a time that
both of us could set aside for a phone call. This would give us the chance
to get to know each other a bit. At that time I would take extensive notes
about you, the things you have done in the past, are doing now and would
like to do in the future. We would then be able to call each other when the
time is right. <br/><br/>This may be a time when you may find yourself looking for interesting
situations. It may also be a time when I come across an ideal situation that
I know you would like to hear about based on your background and career
goals.<br/><br/>This relationship would be similar to the type of relationship that Tiger
Woods, Arnold Palmer, Michael Jordan, Eddie Van Halen, or Rod Stewart might
have with their agents. This service costs nothing for you.<br/><br/>Is this something that you would be interested in?<br/><br/>Thanks,
...
</pre></p>

<p>Funny, when I read your post I had just finished goggling for 'core search group' to see if this was real or not (didn't seem to be much out there).</p>

<p>FWIW, the first paragraph of my note was slightly different, referencing some of my other CPAN modules, but the rest of it was identical. (I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing.) The testimonials on their website seem to be a little dated as well and it's unclear whether they only operate in North/South Carolina.</p>

<p>Maybe they just like CPAN authors named 'Chris'?</p>

Maybe they got a requirement from a client to get someone named Chris to take the blame on changelogs signed only as the previous "Chris"?

If someone wants to approach me about a business relationship, I require them to demonstrate that they've spent 15 minutes with google at least getting a sense of my voluminous body of work on the net.
<p>
If all they have is one keyword (like a recent recruiter spam said "significant CPAN contributor", to which I had to laugh heartily, having only five modules on the CPAN), then I'm merely a name on a list to them, and don't need to waste my time.
</p><p>
Seems to me like your email here is more of the latter, not the former.  Recruiters are dumb.</p>

I got a similar email a while back based on my "significant contributions to Lucene".  I had sent them one patch.

I got that exact same mail, except with "Dave" instead of "Christopher"
