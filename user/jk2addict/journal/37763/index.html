<p>So, it's week 7 (woohoo!) of going to the gym, now 4 times a week. When I started going with a co worker, I bought a generic-Master-like padlock and gave him one of the keys. We could share a locked locker, and he could leave earlier than I without playing where's the key madness.<br/><br/>Monday, he asks "what locker did you have?". an odd question since he usually just uses the locker with our padlock on it.<br/><br/>As it turns out, there were two lockers that evening with the same padlock brand. Even more fun, our key opened both locks.<br/><br/>Given that I purchased that lock at a drug store and not at a kmart/walmart/lowes, I think this was an odd coinkydink.<br/><br/>My mind wonders at how the probability changes of two people, bought two locks for two different uses at two different locations are instead purchasing two different locks to use for the same purpose and the same location.<br/><br/>How fun.<br/><br/>Of course, this is what I get for getting a cheap Made in China knockoff. Time to get a paired set of Masters.</p>

<p>They sell you a lock (if you want it) at my gym. I'm always a little uneasy about it, because I see the same numbers on the locks from time to time.</p><p>At work, I noticed there are a finite number of different keys for all the cabinets.</p><p>I think you're right. For these kind of cheap locks, they're not exactly made to keep valuable items safe, just a small deterrent to keep out the majority of people, who probably wouldn't bother your stuff anyway.</p>
