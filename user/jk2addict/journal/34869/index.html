<p>It's been almost 2 and a half months since I had to start losing weight. The diet is still sticking for the most part. I've had a few slips, but overall I've been good at resisting the urge to eat crap, and I'm still doing the aggressive walking at work.<br/><br/>I have two scales at home. One I bought that goes to 400, and the old one which stops at 330 (just displays Err if you're over that).<br/><br/>The newer scale made some noise when I stepped on it crooked a few days ago. It works, but mentally, I don't trust it as it kept registering between 330 and 335.<br/><br/>So, on a whim, I tried the old scale. Holy shit it worked. Listed me as 328-330 three times in a row.<br/><br/>I'm sure they're both not accurate to reality, but relatively speaking, that kicks ass.</p>

Keep kicking ass.  I got on the scale for the first time in a long time today and found that I'm another pound or two heavier.  I really need to get on the ball about eating better.  A few years ago I lost quite a bit of weight, and now I'm being lazy and stupid and getting it back slowly.<br><br>Maybe it's time to finally buy an elliptical machine for home...<br><br>good luck!



<h2>keep up the discipline</h2>

It's a long slog to lose weight let alone to keep it off.<br><br>I've slacked a little myself and gained about 5 kilos back.<br><br>I think I need to straighten up my diet a little more and walk just a little more often.<br><br>Congratulations.
