Wile I apprecaite you're concern for propper grammer, Me however don't not give a crappe. Thanks U 4 contributing no thing 2 the convers8tion.
</p>
<p>
I suggest that if you care more about bitching [anonymously] about the grammar than contributing to the topic at hand that you kindly find another profession or remove thy stick from thine ass...assuming you're a programmer already.

"It's in it's own directory" ???

The word "it's" means "it is" or "it has" ... nothing else, ever.

Using "it's" two different ways in a single sentence is especially
gross.

The sentence should start as "It's in its own directory."

Programmers seem to want to use "it's" as a pronoun indicating
possession because an apostrophe-s is added to proper names to indicate
possession (Bob's ball, etc.). But that usage conflicts with the other
use of apostrophe-s, which is to be an abbreviation of "is" or "has"
(Pete's gonna go outside; it's gonna rain). That's the rule that rules.

<p>You fell victim to one of the classic blunders! The most famous is never get involved in a land war in Asia, but only slightly less well-known is this: never use "it's" in the wrong context!<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>

You keep using that word. I do not think you know what "it's" means.

<p>What's all this long-winded "Programmers seem to<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... indicating possession<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... conflicts with<nobr> <wbr></nobr>..." explanation about?  The possessive pronoun "its" is just like all of the other possessive pronouns (except mine.)</p><p>The easy way to remember it is simply: "its" is like "his".  Using any more words than that to explain it indicates an inability to focus (as if an off-topic reply on the matter didn't already indicate that.)</p>
