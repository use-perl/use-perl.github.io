<p>Well, it's been a month since I decided (that my insurance company decided) was too fat for my own good and decided to fix that glitch.<br/><br/>I haven't lost a lot of weight, mostly because I don't really do the 2 hours a night I'm gonna be Rocky kind of exercise.<br/><br/>But, I have been power walking every day during the week, and I've stuck to soups, salads, meats, and stayed away from large portions of pasta/breads. I eat my oatmeal/fruits/veggies every day.<br/><br/>I'm still hovering around 338 (started at 346) with the usual +/-3 pounds of water/waste/dinner weight.<br/><br/>Friday was my end of the month eat what I want night. Thank god for pizza...oh blessed cheese how I miss thee. God, I miss ice cream. :-)<br/><br/>The important thing is, I'm still with it. I just need to keep reminding myself that it's about habit change, and that takes time. If I only loose 1-6 pounds a month, that's still better than gaining any.</p>

<h2>keep it up!</h2>

Good for you.  Keep going!  It will all be worth it.



<h2>you are correct</h2>

Just getting in the habit is the hardest part.<br><br>As you wrote, losing a little is better than gaining any.<br><br>It took you a long time to gain this weight and it will take you a long time to lose it.<br><br>Keep up the good work.
