<p>Ever solve a problem that was so painful you just blocked it out of your memory? :-)<br/><br/>I had one of those moments today. One of my co$workers was having problems with an XML file on win32 that he was getting from an HP system. Then the painful memories kicked in, and once I revisited the solution I had 2 years ago, I can't believe I ever figured it out [with the help of some Googlers as well].<br/><br/>The issue then was that the web took in latin encoded posts, and we were sending that buffer over the network to a main system that lived and breathed HPRoman8. Whilst in .NET 1.1, there was no native way to convert, so I worked together a character map of utf->hproman8 and an Encoding class for .NET so I could map data on the way out.<br/><br/>All because of some people with diacritic marks in their names. :-)<br/><br/>Now that I know WHY the XML file is broken, hopefully we can convince MSXML to do our bidding.<br/><br/>I've said it before, and I'll say it again. There are three things that O loathe in this world of programming: codepages/encodings, time/zone conversions, and USPS/ISO country code issues.</p>

I went through this when we were receiving a latin1 encoded XML file, and I needed to compare it to what got loaded into the database, which when fetched, was hp-roman8...so, you probably already know this...but I did something like:<p><blockquote> <div><tt>use Encode qw(decode);<br>...<br>&nbsp; open(my $from_db_h, "&gt;:encoding(latin1)", $file) or die "Err opening $file: $^E";<br>...<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; print $from_db_h decode( 'hp-roman8', join("|", @row{@columns})."\n");</tt></div> </blockquote>

Thank god for iconv. MSXML doesn't like hp roman8, so a quick iconv on the file before loading it as utf does the trick for our xml input file problem.
