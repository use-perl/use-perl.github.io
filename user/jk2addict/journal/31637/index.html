<p>What a night. So I come home to my shiny new BFG 7800GS vid card + Splinter Cell: Double Agent.<br/><br/>While tearing apart my rig to insert the new, longer vid card, I hear a crack. Much to my shock, it was the connector on my one SATA drive (the half of a RAID0 boot even) cracking off, leaving the bare pins without plastic. O M F G!<br/><br/>First of all, whoever thought that connector was more reliable than the IDE connector should be fucking shot. But I digress.<br/><br/>After assessing the situation and taking a deep breath, I was able to ease the bare pins on the drive back into the cable end, where the hd plastic has now lodged itself.  Boot... and voila! It works. So, that cable is now superglued to that hard drive. :-)<br/><br/>So, I started going through BIOS, re-tweaking my over clocking, getting ready to install my new game...<br/><br/>The wife comes in and we're off to the hospital. Her throat was swelling like an allergic reaction,  but this time there was some chest pain to go along with it. 5 hours later, we're home. Looks like she has to get her gall bladder removed. How fun.<br/><br/>At least she's ok. I have to be at work in 6 hours, but sure as shit, I'm installing my game right now, and I'm going to play it if it kills me. :-)</p>
