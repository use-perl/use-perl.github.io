<p>This is a plea. I'm begging someone, as one Perl programmer to another. Won't someone please adopt DBD::SQLite and make it happy again. 1.14 and 1.13 are riddled with issues. The unfreed refs. The segfaults. The memory leaks.<br/><br/>No offense to msergeant. I'm sure he's busy with his own things. I just with there was a 1.15 already that mad things sane again. It's rather frustrating to keep explaining to people after the fluck up a new perl install why they need to downgrade SQLite to 1.12.</p>

<p>I've tried to contact Matt about this and not gotten a response.</p><p>If anyone qualified to maintain DBD::SQLite was interesting in taking it over and willing to go through the usual author contacting attempts, and also can't get a response, I suspect the modules@ list would be happy to hand out co-maint, at the very least for well-contained releases that only target bug fixes and don't change functionality, similar to the recent Template.pm situation.</p>

<p>Audrey is helping me on getting it up to speed now.</p><p>If anyone else wants svn commit rights (I don't mind doing releases) let me know at matt@sergeant.org.</p>

<p>Woohoo! He's alive!!!!</p><p>Could you put the repo address in the dist docs too.<br>I couldn't figure out where it was to pull mentioned patches from. Seems like a few people on da groups have the same issue; even trying the old cvs link.</p>

<p>Hmm, I guess I never added details on that page. Oops.</p><p>Try:</p><p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; svn co svn://axkit.org/DBD-SQLite</p>
