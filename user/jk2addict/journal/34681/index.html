<p>So it's day 4 of life with my MBP. First of all, after toting it to the hotel this weekend, this 17" beast is a gazillion pounds lighter than my old 15" Sager. I finally got my paws on the trial key for Parallels [more on that later].<br/><br/>After getting it connected to the wireless G at home Friday, I did a quick Software Update. Compared to my Windows G wireless card/drivers, wireless on this thing total screams.<br/><br/>A few things still give me pause every now and then.<br/><br/>First, I totally have to use a two button mouse. The keyboard still gives me fits...my hands still want to keep hitting the CAPSLOCK intead of the A all the time after life with my Model Ms. It took me a while to stop looking for the menu on the windows and go up and to the left. I also have to keep reminding myself that closing a windows doesn't mean closing the entire app via Quit.<br/><br/>All in all, it's a smoking machine. Parallels gave me some troubles when installing Ubuntu 7.10, but that's not surprising since it's not released yet. I hear 7.04 goes smooth as silk. I can't get Kubuntu 7.10 installed at all. XP installed just fine once I stopped trying to use the "Express" install and went for the custom install instead. FreeBSD 6.2 is also running just dandy.<br/><br/>I still need to get all of them talking to my OSX copy of minicpan and get their perls installed and up to date with my development.<br/><br/>Fink/SVN/SVK is installed and I tried about 3 different torrent clients. I like Adium, but the lack of IRC support still bugs me, esp since I spend more time on irc.perl.org than chatting any more. I hear pidgin 2.2.0 does native compile on OSX now, but I haven't figured out how to tell it where the fink lib/includes are.<br/><br/>All in all it's been a great investment. I'm not sure I would go MBP if it weren't for doing perl development and testing multiple OSes via Parallels though.<br/><br/>I can't wait to hook up iTunes to my DLink NAS with it's iTunes server, and I'm looking forward to using the remote the next time I have to present at a PM meeting. :-)<br/><br/>After all of the tinkering, I may do a fresh OSX install just to get back to a sane starting point for long term working.</p>
