<p>Well, I went to the Apple store this evening with a couple of the guys from work. My 40lb laptop is 4 and a half years old and pooping out a keyboard again. It has spoiled me..15" 1600x1200 resolution.<br/><br/>The 17" MBP is nice and expensive. Fast, but the resolution does leave a bit to be desired for a 17" wide screen. For the price tag, they sure could stuff a 1920x1200 on there like other high end 17" laptops do.<br/><br/>I installed the optimized Firefox 2.0 on it. Seemed fast. I wish they'd stuff Parallels on their just to try out.<br/><br/>In the end, I couldn't get over the guilt of $3000 price tag after getting the wedding/credit card paid off. Plus, it would do nothing but distract me for a few weeks. I'm really close to getting Handel 1.0 done. Maybe I'll treat myself after it's complete.<br/><br/><strong>Update:</strong> The more I think about it, the more I realize it's the 17" LCD resolution that bugs me. For $3000, any other 17" I can buy on the market has a high resolution ~1920x1200 resolution. If the 17" MBP had that, I would've walked out with one.</p>
