<p>Earlier tonight I sat down with Beginning Perl (by Simon Cozens) and made my third attempt at learning some basic Perl stuff. Third time lucky me thinks!
Maybe I'm just not as dumb as I used to be or a tiny bit of what I learnt last time actually sunk in, but either way I'm really excited as it's making a lot of sense.
Of course, being halfway through chapter 2 is a bit soon to be talking big but at least this time it is fun, not stressful and dull.
I spent a little time looking at the concept of 'backwhacking' as I must have skipped that part before. My senses tell me I shall be a n00b for a little while yet :)</p>

I had similar sparks of excitement when I read through COBOL, Java, PHP and Ruby books... BUT Perl did stick and Simon knows his stuff. Glad to have you back. Going to Vienna??

I'm impressed -- you've made it to chapter 6. Hurry up and finish it, so I can use you to do some of my work...
