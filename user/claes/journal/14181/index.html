<p>A couple of weeks ago I spent some time in London after YAPC::Europe. At an emergency london.pm social meeting we had a few drinks and then <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/sky/">Sky</a> started handing out projects to us who had nothing to do.<br><br>
I got assigned the fun task of cross-referencing CPAN!<br><br>
Basiclly, it analyses source code - finding what other packages it uses or requires, what subroutines it declares, what functions and methods it calls and what packages it defines. From this information a database is built holding references.<br><br>
In the web-interface, you can browse the distribution and if a file is indexed you can have a look at the source. When it lists the source, each connection (like a use, call etc) are linked and if you click that link you'll end up in the symbol page. This is where it's getting interesting.<br/><br/>The symbol display page shows in what file(s) the symbol is define as a package, declared as a subroutine or called.<br><br><br/><br/>You can also search for symbols which is great if you know the name of a function but you don't know in what distribution/module it is declared in.<br><br><br/><br/>Anyway, doing source analysis of Perl-code is extremlly difficult, and it won't handle some of special things one can do. I wish I had a better way to do it than with regular expressions. <b>Only perl can parse Perl!</b><br><br><br/><br/>I plan to have a public demo site up today or later this week. The URL will be posted in my journal.<br><br><br/><br/>Hopefully, you guys will find this useful.<br><br>

Wow! Definitely post the URL when it is available.



<h2>I'm doing it</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/melopt/">melopt</a> on 2003-08-18T14:54:34</h3>
Hi,<br> <br>I was at YAPC::Europe last July, and I decided to try OODoc.<br> <br>OODoc requires a lot of documentation to be written out of the box, but beeing a lazy bastard, I subclassed it to generate documentation for me (basic stuff).<br> <br>I also do perl code parsing. If you like to compare code, or look at my code for it, email/jabber me at melo(at)isp.novis.pt.<br> <br>Looking forward to seeing this in action!

CPAN!
<p>
Adam Kennedy has written <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/ADAMK/PPI-0.7/" title="cpan.org">PPI</a cpan.org> which takes a good stab and parsing Perl with perl.</p>

The best parser/tokenizer would be perls. I haven't tried PPI yet, but I sure will.<p>

However, I'll release the code for the cross-referencer (and the rest of the project) to CPAN, so I might leave this to the community =)</p>

<h2>Module::Info</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/educated_foo/">educated_foo</a> on 2003-08-18T18:27:14</h3>
You might also look at using Module::Info, which (AFAIK) grovels around a bit in the op-tree to gather information.  On the downside, you probably have to install the modules to make full use of M::I.  However, you might be able to attach this as a "trojan" on CPANTS.

Module::Info can extract some information without loading the module, but to get what I need it has to load it so it's unfortunetly not an option.<p><nobr> <wbr></nobr>/me imagines a machine with all CPAN modules installed !</p>

<h2>Re:Module::Info</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/educated_foo/">educated_foo</a> on 2003-08-18T20:51:18</h3>
Hence the suggestion to piggyback this on top of CPANTS.  To test a module, you have to have enough of an installation to make it run and function.  So after running the tests (if they pass), CPANTS could automatically run a function to gather Module::Info data to send back with the results.  I'm not sure how bad the politics of such a move would be, but it seems like a natural way to distribute an otherwise expensive computation.

<h2>Module::ExtractUse</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/domm/">domm</a> on 2003-08-18T19:17:15</h3>
Hi!
<br> <br>
For some part of Module::CPANTS::Generator, I wrote a parser (using Parse::RecDescent) that can parse (sort of good, I hope) a small aspect of Perl, namely "use" statements.
<br> <br>
The module is called Module-ExtractUse, it's on <a href="http://search.cpan.org/author/DOMM/Module-ExtractUse-0.10/" title="cpan.org">CPAN</a cpan.org>
 and you can view the results in Module::CPANTS' "uses" field.
<br> <br>
You might find it interesting. I'm definitly interested in your results (and I assume they will flow into Module::CPANTS?)
<br> <br>
While we're at it, take a look at this:
