<p>I'm finally back in Stockholm after 10 days of conference/vacation. YAPC::Europe was great, huge amount of credits to the Paris Perl Mongers. I'm already looking forward to next years YAPC::Europe in Belfast.<p>

After Paris, I took the EuroStar up to London. It was supposed to take 2 1/2 hours, but ofcourse the train going to Paris broke down at Ashford International so they had to take our train back to Paris and we had to wait while they fixed their train to take us to London. Atleast I didn't have to wait 4 hours as some of the London Perl Mongers did.<p>

Once in London, a friend met me at Waterloo Station and we took a cab up to a swedish pub. Once there, we found it was occupied by a private party (Bummer), so off to McDonalds for some dinner. It is without doubt the most expensive BigMac & Co I've ever eaten. Later that night we went to a pub in Chelsea.<p>

On monday, I went to stay with sky in his apartment and do some sightseeing. Took the bus from Old Street down to Waterloo to catch Matrix Reloded on IMAX, but they only screen it in the evenings. So I walked over to Tate Modern, cross the millenium bridge and up in St. Paul's Cathedral. 600 stairs makes me really tired. After some random walking in London, I went to see sky again.<p>

On tuesday, more random tourist activities.<p>

On wednesday evening, there was a emergency London.pm social meeting because I and R. Geoffrey Avery were in town. Lots of beer and booze and sky managed to hand out homework for those who had little to do.<p>

Thursday and it was time to fly back home. Took the train from Paddington out to the airport and got lost in the terminals. Managed to find my way to the SAS check-in after a while. After going thru security check and not beeing searched I was kinda suprsised, because I thought they had tighten up security. But when entering the gate, they randomly (yeah right, eat my shorts) selected me for a security check. Two people who had checked-in didn't board the aircraft, so they had to unload all luggage and remove theirs so we were an hour late away from London.<p>

Well, that's about what I've been up to.. now it's time to do some programming (and play SimCity 4 ofcourse).<p>
