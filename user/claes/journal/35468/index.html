<p><p>So it's quite a while since I last wrote in my journal here. I moved temporarily to LJ but the Perl community really is where my heart is so I'll return here from now on.</p>

<p>Now? what's happened since my last entry on 29th sept. 2006?</p>

<p>1) Winter 2005 just after NPW2005 I got burnt out and that has had quite a few implications to my life. In late october 2006 I was diagnosed with anxiety disorder and social fobia. But thanks to drugs and therapy I feel a lot better now and I'm starting to rebuild my social life.</p>

<p>2) I quit my job at the Swedish Premium Pension Authority to start my own business in order to develop a software that's been on my mind for quite some time. More about that further down.</p>

<p>3) Altho I officialy started the company in early 2007 I didn't feel up to nor was a able to do any work until late 2007 when I started to feel better. Really a bummer since I had to live off my savings but taking almost a year off was not so bad after all. It sure has gotten me more eager to invest time and energy into building something like a business and continue to be active in the Perl community.</p>


<p>So what does the future hold?</p>

<p><b>Business - client projects</b><br>
Try to find more customers and especially those who want to open source what I do for them. One of my customers, <a href="http://www.linserv.se">Linserv AB</a>, suggested themselves to release it on CPAN (<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/M3-ServerView/">M3::ServerView</a>). Companies like that rock.
</p>

<p><b>Business - own projects</b><br>
The reason I decided to start my own was so I could transform my thoughts about software comprehension and visualisation into a product. Several years ago I wrote CPANXR, a cross-referencing tool which worked not quite so well. This new system which I call OpenGrasp will eventually be released as open source. Currently my focus lies on the core database which stores the software model which basically is a typed directed graph. This graph has to be searchable, traversable and transformable. I'll be posting more about OpenGrasp as it develops.</p>

<p><b>Nordic Perl Workshop 2008</b><br>
I went to NPW2007 in Copenhagen and it was excellent. Now as you may know YAPC::EU will be hosted by Copenhagen Perl Mongers this year so they weren't capable of organizing NPW. So I took it upon me and planning is starting really soon. We're aiming for late may, probably a friday + saturday. My hope is that I'll be able to arrange a free introduction course to Perl at the university here in stockholm a few days before NPW so we can get some fresh blood interested in the community. We'll also hopefully be able to get a well-known Perl author to do a one-day class just before NPW for those who are interested (this will not be free tho).</p>

<p><b>YAPC::Europe 2008</b><br>
I'm definitely going. Copenhagen is also really close to SkÃÂ¥ne where my family has a summer house so it's just a short trip over the bridge. mmm... bridge... gaaaaah.</p>

<p><b>Social life</b><br>
Big step.. due to reasons given earlier I haven't been able to go out for quite some time. I'm working on this by exposing me to situations I don't like. CBT++</p>

<p>Now if only a cute sweet girl who understands the life of a hacker would cross my path =)</p>

<br><br><br>
Happy 2008<br>
