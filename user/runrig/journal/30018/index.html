<div class="span8">
<p><p>First, I don't actually use <a href="http://www.openoffice.org">OpenOffice</a> (or any other word processor/spreadsheet) in any significant amount, but I still attempt to get my family to use it instead of the MS Works that's installed, and continually try to talk my wife out of buying MS Office or WordPerfect.</p>
<p>So when she says that all of a sudden the spreadsheet is capitalizing the first word of every cell, I figure (correctly) that it's some autocorrect feature and turn it off, and think that it's probably not as common to want that option in a spreadsheet as in a word processor. But I get an idea and open the word processor, find the same feature and turn that option on. When I go back to the spreadsheet, I find that it has been turned back on there also. The word processor and the spreadsheet share AutoCorrect options! Now that's just dumb IMHO.</p>
<p>But that's not all. Even after turning off the "capitalize the first word of every sentence" option, when you retype a cell and leave the cell, the first word gets re-capitalized! I suspected that some autocomplete feature was to blame, and sure enough the help docs on "AutoComplete" confirmed that was the problem (it said that if you entered "Red" in a cell, there is no way to change that cell to "red" until you turn off AutoComplete). I also found that you could select a bunch of cells and lowercase all of them...my SO said she tried that and it didn't work (maybe AutoComplete was interfering there? I didn't check).</p>
<p>All in all, the problems could be worked around with searches in the help docs, but when trying to get something done NOW, it's annoying for a user (and I don't count as a user :) to search through the docs for explanations of strange behaviors.</p>
<p>Update: In contrast, Excel seems to ignore the "Capitalize 1st word of every sentence" option AFAICT, and if you do enter, e.g., "Red" in a cell, it can be edited to "red" even with AutoComplete on.</p></p>
