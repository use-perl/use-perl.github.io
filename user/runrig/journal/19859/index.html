<p><p>I'm the sort of person that gets a wallet for Christmas, and takes two years before I get around to using it (and all the while, the wife asks "Don't you like it?"...sure, I like it just fine, I just don't want to, uh, wear it out too quickly :).</p><p>So I've finally gotten around to installing Firefox. I also don't notice change much, unless it's in your face obvious ("Don't you notice anything different about me?"...). I do notice the "right click open in a new tab" thing, I'm not sure what the window next to the  url window is (a google search window?), one little thing I do notice that I like is that I can double click on a word in the url and change just that word. It was annoying in IE to have to delete or backspace and all you could highlight was the whole URL (which who knows might be changed by now, I've never updated). I'm sure I'll probably be happy with the features I find out about, and it'd be nice to find out about the nicer features. And there is even a help page for former IE users :-)</p><p>Then there are those things that you don't notice, because it is the lack of them that makes it a nice feature (popups, getting hack-sword), and how do you notice better security? (though with <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/07/13/1247203&mode=thread&tid=126&tid=154&tid=172&tid=95">that recent problem</a>, even ditching IE is not a cureall). This computer was free, and came with XP, so it may take me awhile to get the tuits to install something else (then again I still have a couple spares in the garage). I'm not against change, I just take my time getting around to it...</p></p>

<h2>Google search engine</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jdavidboyd/">jdavidboyd</a> on 2004-07-15T14:12:42</h3>
If you click and pull down on G, you can get more search engines to install...



<h2>More differences</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/VSarkiss/">VSarkiss</a> on 2004-07-15T14:29:37</h3>
<p><blockquote><div>"right click open in a new tab"</div></blockquote>You can also middle-click on a link to open it in a new tab instead of opening it in the same window.  Seems like I hardly ever left-click anymore, except for submit buttons.
<p>And the google box is something you get used to <em>very</em> quickly.  I don't have search engine bookmarks any longer.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>

Cool! I've never had a reason to middle click until now, and I like it!
