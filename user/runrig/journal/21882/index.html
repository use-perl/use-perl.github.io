<p><p><a href="http://use.perl.org/user/djberg96/">djberg96's</a> <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/djberg96/journal/21880">latest entry</a> reminded me of what I did last week. I was on vacation, and the resort we stayed at had karaoke night. I'd never done it before, but after a few glasses of free (as in beer) liquid courage (but in the form of wine), I put in for my first selection, "All Star" by Smashmouth. It's one of my daughter's favorites, and I thought I might have had a chance to get her to come up and help out...but I did it...alone.  I was pretty sure I sucked, but I had fun, so later I put in for "Hey, Good Lookin" by Hank Williams, "Theme from The Monkees" (do I need to say by who?), and <a href="http://www.steveearle.net/lyrics/ly-coppe.php">"Copperhead Road"</a> by Steve Earle.</p>
<p>I was kind of unsure about the appropriateness of that last one in mixed company (the song being about moonshinin', running whiskey, growing weed, and Vietnam), but I felt somewhat compelled after someone else did "God Bless the USA" by Lee Greenwood, and everyone was rockin' and clappin' along to the first part, though a few got quiet during the last verse (moonshining and running whiskey being more socially acceptable than growing weed and being reminded of Vietnam), and some told me then and later how much they liked it. I was still pretty sure I sucked, but some said I didn't, so at least I can have the illusion that I don't :)</p>
<p>One couple later said I should've also done Alice's Restaurant, which they said was on the selection list, but I didn't see it....oh well. I wonder how long that song would've run :)</p></p>
