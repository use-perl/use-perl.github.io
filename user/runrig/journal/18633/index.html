<p><p>We always seemed to have our social meetings on Little League night at the old place, so we tried something new and went to <a href="http://www.oggis.com">Oggi's Pizza and Brewery</a>. Excellent food AND beer, and we might have even talked about perl some :)</p>
<p>We had a table full of people, but it's hard to get very many to show up to anything in OC because traffic is godawful if you're not nearby to begin with (public transport - what's that? :), though as with most PM groups, we do get more at the technical meetings. When someone has something to talk about, that is...sometimes I think PM ought to be like a sort of <a href="http://www.toastmasters.org/">Toastmasters Club</a> and everyone should talk about something sometime, but we couldn't do that, could we? ;-)</p>
<p>On another note, we've nearly completed moving (not far, just around the corner and up the street, but it's still moving). Maybe when we've settled in, I could get hold of a projector and we could have a Perl Tech Meet and BBQ...</p></p>
