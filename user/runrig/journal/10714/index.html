<p>Noticed this sort of thing several times over while editing a 4gl report:<pre>
if rpt.value/1000 < 0 then
  print 0
else
  print rpt.value/1000
end if
</pre>
On another note, I wonder how much demand there would be for 4gl-like text report module in perl, with things like page headers and trailers, group headers and trailers, among other things. Back when I was first looking at perl formats, these were the things I was missing, and now I finally might be ready to code such a thing. Or is there something on CPAN I'm just not seeing yet?
<p>Then again, a co-worker says I should just skip plain text reports and go straight to something more Crystal Reports-like, but I don't know where I'd start there (XML FO's? How to tell where to print page trailers w/variable fonts? etc).</p>

So rpt.value can't be negative? Maybe they wanted to report negative values as 0.

The useless part is in the boolean section of the 'if' statement. It's not a real big deal, but I haven't seen a number yet that flips its sign when you divide by a positive number. Unless you overload '/', but let's not get into that, and you can't do it in this 4gl anyway<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

Ya, I guess if they wanted to report a 0 if some number was negative, then they didn't need to do the division.
