<p>I moved my repository from my PC to the server, so that others in the office can start using it, and it's running svnserve as a Windows service with <a href="http://dark.clansoft.dk/user/mbn/svnservice/">svnservice</a>.
By default, svnserve gives you read-only access, so I edited the config and password files to allow name/password login and read-write access. It'd be nice if it could hook in to the Windows authentication, and from what I can google, someone is working on it, and other solutions include setting up an SSH server that Windows authenticates against, and tunneling that to the SVN server...but I don't want to get that fancy...yet.</p>

<h2>Apache?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Dom2/">Dom2</a> on 2006-01-03T07:46:28</h3>
Is it possible to install Apache to use as a subversion server?  I find this very easy to use, with the side benefit that your documentation can then contain proper links to the source code.  Apache/Subversion are both quite easy to install together on win32.

<p>Not only that, but the authentication problem is probably already solved inside Apache.  There's much more likely a module for Apache to authenticate against Active Directory or whatever.

I think I will look at that solution...eventually. It seemed like another step I just didn't want to go through at the time, but probably it is the way I'd want to go if this is deployed company wide. For now, svnserve will do, as we only have 4 programmers in the office.

Also, I think I will need to find the Apache for Subversion on Windows for Dummies FAQ<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

I think you'll be surprised as to how easy it is to get running.  Getting Apache up and running is the main hurdle, and it's a cinch using the installers from apache.org.  After that, you just have to install subversion and the installer should offer to insert mod_dav_svn into your apache installation for you.  After that, it's a small matter of editing the Apache config file as described in <a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.1/ch06s04.html" title="red-bean.com">the svn book</a red-bean.com>.  It's really not very difficult.
