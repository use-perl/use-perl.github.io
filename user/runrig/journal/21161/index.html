<p><p>Outlook Express is behaving differently on XP from how it behaved on the old Win95 box, and I don't like it. So it seemed like a good time to try out Thunderbird, and I'm just not totally sure about it yet.  It tried to import messages from OE, but failed, and there's even an 'Import' option in the menu, but it doesn't work either (It creates an 'Outlook Express' folder with an 'Inbox' and other sub-folders, but doesn't get any messages or the other sub-Inbox folders I had with their messages).</p>
<p>Other than that, I think it will do what I want, which is keep all the family's email separate, which is what the old OE did with it's 'Switch Identities' option, but the new OE doesn't want to do that. I'm not sure yet if I want to create entirely separate 'User Accounts' for this box, which may have solved that problem anyway...maybe I'll toy with that.</p>
<p>Update: Yeah, creating user accounts was the way to go...now I feel stupid...but I'll still keep trying Thunderbird, though not importing the old email is a bummer.</p></p>

can you do multiple imports and just keep moving the subfolders into your inbox?<br> <br>outlook express<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; inbox<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; subfolder a<br> <br>move the contents of subfolder a into inbox.<br> <br>firefox<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; create subfolder a<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; import from outlook express<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; move everything from inbox to subfolder a<br> <br>that might work...

Not even things in the Inbox folder get exported. And if I try to export from Outlook Express, I get "An error occured while trying to initialize MAPI"<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:(
