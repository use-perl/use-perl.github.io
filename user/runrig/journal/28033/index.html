<p><p>Adobe used to have this thing called PDFWriter which was a print driver that output to a pdf file instead of a printer (It's now "PDF Distiller" which is "far superior"). But if you use it from an application, you may want to skip the "Save File" dialog because you just want to control the file name from the program. It's not possible to skip the dialog in Acrobat version 3 (which is the version I am using), but it was possible in version 4.</p>
<p>So I copied the code which worked for version 4, but the tester was using version 6 (only because the person installing on the test system couldn't get version 7 working). Of course, it didn't work, the "Save File" dialog pops up. After research, I found every version has a different way to suppress this dialog. The version 7 method is (as of this writing) freely available in Adobe's online docs. For the version 6 method you have to pay Adobe $195 for the priviledge of finding out how to do it. Arrgh. Some words come to mind, like "extortion" or "highway robbery" (plus the insanity of having to update your app every time another customer uses your app with another version of Adobe).</p>
<p>If I had my way (and lots of time, which I don't), I'd dump this crap and use the PDF generation tools that are freely available (e.g. <code>XML->XML-FO->fop->PDF</code>). Oh well, back to work ... :-)</p></p>

Wouldn't PDFcreator be a good alternative? I think it just uses ghostscript<br><br><a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/pdfcreator/" title="sourceforge.net">http://sourceforge.net/projects/pdfcreator/</a sourceforge.net><br><br>

I'd looked at ghostscript for something a long time ago, but hadn't heard of PDFCreator. If this works (I'll try it Monday), I so owe you...
