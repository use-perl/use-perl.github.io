<h1>Vacation - New Job</h1>
<h2><a href="/user/runrig/">runrig</a> on 2005-02-27T19:18:36</h2>

<div class="span8">
<p><p>Took a break before the new job starts on Monday and drove the family up Highway 395 to Tahoe/Carson City. Driving across the Mojave Desert, stopped in <a href="http://www.randsburg.com/">Randsburg</a>, which I'd never seen before. Funny how that in the middle of nowhere, anyplace is someplace. There was a big sign that said there was a Wild West or Miners days or something sometime in September, but I can't find any reference to it on the website or elsewhere. Anyway, it's not far off the highway, and it's an interesting place to visit if you happen to be going that way :-)</p>
<p>And as far as the new job goes, I'm sure that I'll be working on the legacy 4gl apps, but not too sure what else. I worked there before, and wrote some perl to do flat file data munging and loading into a database. They're still using those scripts, but they are not written as I would have done them today (or even how I would have done it then if I could have used DBI/DBD at the time), and they could use a good refactoring. But everything new is being done in Java, so there's a chance that's what'll happen to those scripts, unless I find it worthwhile to convince them otherwise.</p></p>

<h2>Good luck</h2>

<p>Hope the new job works out OK.</p>
