<div class="span8">
<p><p>Well, actually it never rains in California...but I've been keeping busy. I don't maintain the most golly-gee-whiz-bang of modules, and I don't think about them for long stretches at a time, so when I get two RT tickets and an email about 3 of them within about a week, it's a veritable flurry of activity :-)</p>
<p>Of the RT tickets, one was a bug, and one was a wishlist, and I took them both as an opportunity to also raise my <a href="http://cpants.dev.zsi.at/kwalitee.html">kwalitee</a>.
And thoses two modules now have about as much kwalitee as they're likely to get, unless I cheat the is_prereq indicator by releasing "Use::All::My::Modules" and "Use::All::My::Modules:Some::More" (but I wouldn't stoop to that).</p>
<p>The email about the other module was yet another "this doesn't work can you help me" which was really an RTFM question and would have probably got just as good and quicker help from <a href="http://www.perlmonks.org">PerlMonks</a> or even comp.lang.perl.misc. And I almost ignored the email because the subject was "help requested" which I would normally assume was Nigerian spam, but the spam filter didn't catch it, so I took a look at it.</p>
<p>And on the bright side of things, even though my "contract" ended early (note to self: must get real contract next time), I am working again at my previous employers who were happy to have me back. No official perl development though, it seems like all the good perl dev positions are not worth the drive from where I'm at, and I'm not inclined to move.</p>
<p>And as <a href="http://use.perl.org/comments.pl?sid=26621&cid=40546">I've mentioned</a>, I got to try out Ruby on Rails, mostly just working through the <a href="http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/onlamp/2005/01/20/rails.html">example in the O'Reilly article</a>, but also adding a couple of other things to get used to Ruby. Like using "*" to expand arrays in argument lists, unlike perl, which automatically "expands" arrays in arg lists.  Now I just need to make something useful with it (or w/<a href="http://use.perl.org/user/draven/journal/24775">Catalyst</a> :-)</p>
<p>And last, though it wasn't directly copied from the book or anything, I wrote <a href="http://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=458851">my first iterator</a> after reading <a href="http://hop.perl.plover.com/">HOP</a>. (No, it's not the first iterator I ever wrote, just the first one after reading the book). I can't recommend that book enough...but then, I don't have to, because <a href="http://hop.perl.plover.com/reviews.html">others already have</a>.</p>
