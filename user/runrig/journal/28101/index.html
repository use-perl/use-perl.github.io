<p><p>I have been using <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a> to keep track of my own projects (along with <a href="http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/">TortoiseSVN</a>) and it is simply the <a href="http://www.thebeesknees.com/">Bee's knees</a>. I could easily convice the others in the local office to use it, but convincing those at HQ on the other side of the continent is another issue (I was there about a week ago but stuff happened and I didn't get around to pushing svn as I would have liked).</p>
<p>The revision graphs you get from TSVN are pretty, but not always correct (or "correct", but not neccessarily what you expected). I've been creating a branch off of the main trunk for every project, and then tagging each commit of a project with a project-revision#, and if you create the tag right after branching or committing, then all is well. But if you, e.g., branch, and then wait awhile to tag (as I did with my first project), while committing other things in between, then the graph doesn't come out "correct" (i.e., as I would like it to).</p>
<p>I think it would be useful to have an atomic branch-then-tag or commit-then-tag, but I think it would take some serious tuits for me to do that (then again, who knows, it might be easier than I think). And it still doesn't help me after the fact with my branch-wait-wait-tag glitch anyway. So SVN rocks, but TSVN needs to read my mind a little better :-)</p></p>

<h2>Doh! directories != branches</h2>

Of course, I now realize what I should have done...I should have tagged the revision at which I branched, not the HEAD revision of the "branch" (which was really just a directory) which I created. (In SVN, you're just making revisions of the entire directory tree, and the entire directory tree includes trunk, branches, tags and all).

After more testing, I find that even if I had branched from the correct revision, the graphs still come out screwy. sigh. I understand the reasons why the graphs can not come out right in all circumstances, but it seems that trying to handle the hard stuff breaks the simple stuff. I'm pretty sure I could handle the logic of building the graph in perl, but then there's the matter of making a nice pretty clickable diagram of it, etc. Maybe I left some tuits under the sofa...
