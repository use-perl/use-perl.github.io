<p><p>Me: Twinkle, twinkle, little star, how I wonder what you are...</p>
<p>(nearly 5 year old)Son: I know what stars are, they're big gas balls, like the sun.</p>
<p>Me (obviously baiting son): But why is the sun so big?</p>
<p>Son: Because the stars are nocturnal.</p>
<p>No, it doesn't make sense, except maybe to a 5 year old, but darn if that wasn't a good comeback :-)</p>
<p>And later, having a discussion with the wife over the electric bill, and what the units are that we actually pay for which went something like:<p>
<p>Me: You pay for kilowatt-hours, not kilowatts. watts & kilowatts are rates, like miles per hour, or miles per gallon.</p>
<p>SO: But <em>what</em> are you paying for per <em>what</em>?</p>
<p>Me: Well, there's no 'per' (like a boat going 40 knots (although that's actually nautical miles per hour)), but I guess you could call it kilowatt-hours per hour...(me sees that its not going well).</p>
<p>SO: So how long does it take for a 60 watt bulb to use up 1000 watts?</p>
<p>Around the 10th cycle of this conversation, my daughter comes in, with a calculator, and has the impression that it's a heated argument instead of a discussion (well, there <em>may</em> have been <em>some</em> frustration building).</p>
<p>D: I can't sleep. Maybe this will help. Do you divide the 1000 (watts) by 60? (divides)...it's 16.66666. Is that right?</p>
<p>Later, we find a note in the hallway and the living room with "60 watts is 16 2/3 hours" (and "$2.75" because we may have mentioned how much a kilowatt-hour costs), and then a similar one on the bed, and another on the nightstand, and another written in a paper airplane that I missed.</p>
<p>So there you have it. 60 watts takes 16 2/3 hours to make 1000 watts (or somethings). I'm not gonna argue it any more :)</p></p>
