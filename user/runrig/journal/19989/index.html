<div class="span8">
<p><p>After changing <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/dougw/Parse-FixedLength/">Parse::FixedLength</a> a couple versions ago, I recently noticed a couple of tests that should have been failing, but weren't (no, changes were not backward compatible, shame on me :). So I fixed the module, updated the tests and uploaded to CPAN. Though I'm still using archaic <code>print "not " unless $sometest; print "ok\n"</code>-type tests. It was the first thing I saw back when I wrote my first module, so that's what I emulated. I'll try something more modern for my next module, and maybe even write something more than a glorified pack/unpack :-)</p>
<p>I've been playing with Wx, trying to write a database app, but I get hung up on little things, like arguments to functions, and what functions to call in the first place, and what widget I want to use. I look at the <a href="http://www.wxwidgets.org/docs.htm">wxWidgets docs</a> to get the arg list for a method for a widget, but it doesn't seem to work, look at the samples that come with the <a href="http://wxperl.sourceforge.net/">wxPerl</a> distribution, but they don't always say what all the args being used are for (and they're often 0 or undef), or I try to create the desired thing in  <a href="http://wxglade.sourceforge.net/">wxGlade</a>, and generate the perl code and use that as a template/starting point (e.g. it took me an hour to get a couple of buttons on a toolbar -- maybe it wasn't an hour, but it seemed like it). Maybe I'm being too ambitious, but I can't/don't want to just use wxGlade because I want to dynamically create widgets, and wxGlade uses Sizers (which in Tk would be kind of like using pack instead of place), and I will probably need to manually place things by coordinates instead of using Sizers (though I may change down the road).</a></p>
