<p><p>Yes, I was one of the multitude spending the evening at a Barnes and Noble waiting for the latest HP book to come out. I got to leave early though, since my wife and I drove separately and my youngest was fading fast while the elder stuck it out at the bookstore with her friend. I really don't mind Harry Potter, but I was just disappointed that plans to go to the X/Plimsouls/Maria McKee show that evening fell apart :-(</p>
<p>Saw <a href="http://slashdot.org/articles/05/07/15/1617224.shtml?tid=214&tid=133">this article about "How Star Wars Should Have Ended"</a> on Slashdot, and thought it was about time that I installed BitTorrent. Found out that I needed to forward ports 6881-9 from my router, and when I went to the admin screen to set that up, I could enter a range, but there wasn't enough space to enter that many characters, so I had to make 9 separate entries for the forwarding. Grrr.</p>
<p>Sometime while searching the Mozilla site for BitTorrent plugins, I came across something called <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/extensions/moreinfo.php?application=firefox&category=Download%20Tools&id=753">Dijjeridoo </a>
which ran a downloading tool named <a href="http://dijjer.org/">Dijjer</a> which looks pretty cool at first glance (no port forwarding!)...wonder if it could catch on
as much as BitTorrent???</p>
<p>And tomorrow is Disneyland's 50th big time celebration, so we'll probably be braving the crowds
to go to that...</p></p>
