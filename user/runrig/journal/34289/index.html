<p><p>Tired of trying to educate the masses on what kind of language Perl is? I hereby dub Perl and any other language that wants to join the party as a SCSL, which stands for So-Called Scripting Language. If you want to wordify the acronym, I tentatively suggest "scuzzle".</p>
<p>Whenever the word "script" is used in reference to one of these languages, it is implied that what is really meant is "so-called script". It'll even be ok to say "I'm writing a scuzzle" (you don't have to say "I'm writing a scuzz", cuz that just doesn't sound right...though maybe "I'm writing some scuzz"...that sounds better).</p>
<p>You just wait, within 5 years, it'll be common usage. We'll just have to avoid association with the current (informal) definition of scuzzle...or maybe not... .oO( That's one hairy-ass language )...I'm liking this idea more and more :-)</p></p>

<h2>It's a program</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/petdance/">petdance</a> on 2007-08-30T21:56:03</h3>
When you write a "script", you're really writing a program.  Perl is a programming language.  If you want to distinguish between old languages like C and Java, say that it's a dynamic programming language.

<p>Your preaching to the choir, but I've decided it just doesn't have the same pizazz as "scuzzle". And if you acronymwordify Dynamic Programming Language, scuzzle is way cooler than dipple<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>

Besides, if I had to get up and comment every time someone within earshot says "perl script", I'd never get any work done. And if I had a nickel for every...

<p>It's cool-sounding in its own way.  I wouldn't mind telling people my job is a computer scuzzler.</p>



<h2>SCSL already taken</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jordan/">jordan</a> on 2007-08-31T16:34:59</h3>
Isn't that the Sun Community Source License?<br><br>I'm not sure and I don't care enough to check, but since Sun went GPL with Java, I'm not sure if SCSL is used by anyone anymore.<br><br>Be careful with equating Perl with SCSL, though.  With the recent <a href="http://use.perl.org/article.pl?sid=07/08/26/1541205" title="perl.org">questions surrounding the Artistic License</a perl.org>, unattentive people might get the impression that Perl has abandoned the Artistic License in favor of the Sun license.

I saw that turn up a few links down on a Google search. My opinion is that almost any short acronym already stands for something (e.g. the results above the Sun results), and that one is a License, and this one will be a Language, therefore there shouldn't be any confusion, and I'll appropriate the acronym for my own nefarious purposes. And besides, this thread already shows up at the top of a Google search for "SCSL" and "scuzzle"<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)
