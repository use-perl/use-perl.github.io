<p><p>We do use version control at work, but it totally sucks. E.g., I've been told that making more than a couple of branches for any project confuses it, it's been corrupted more than once, and it's near impossible to find out what changes are related to any particular project, especially if the changes required more than one check-in (i.e. checking in changes, then fixing your changes). So then I started saving diffs from my projects so I can at least tell what changes I've made, but this is beginning to get unmanagable.</p>
<p>So I'm experimenting with creating my own <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">SVN</a>   repository (w/<a href="http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/">TortoiseSVN</a>), and will start creating branches for all of my projects. But when I create the repository, and check out the files, the modification times of the files are the time that they were imported into the repository. But I need to keep my repository in synch with the remote directory that files get extracted to when you check files into the "official" repository. So my nifty <a href="http://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=506942">directory synching utility</a> won't quite work, because it'll want to update all the files.</p>
<p>But what I think might work is that, when I check out the files from SVN, I can immediately change the modification times to match those of (my local copy) of the remote directory (so I will still need my synching utility). In my not very rigorous test, SVN didn't seem to care that I updated the modification time of a file in a checked out directory as long as the contents didn't change. Hmm, is that clear? I hope it works :-)</p></p>

You can configure Subversion to use the time of the commit instead of the time of the checkout.  This may or may not be helpful, but it's what CVS does.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

<p>Have a look at <a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.1/ch07.html#svn-ch-7-sect-1.3.2" title="red-bean.com">The SVN book</a red-bean.com>, and search for "use-commit-times".

Thanks anyway, but I don't think I was clear, because that's just as not helpful<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-) If I was keeping "the" official repository, it wouldn't matter to me what it did. But since I have to periodically synch my local repository to a remote directory, what I really would want is to import/commit the files with their existing modification times, and check them out with those same times. I think I can accomplish the synching though, if I just keep a directory around dedicated to that.
