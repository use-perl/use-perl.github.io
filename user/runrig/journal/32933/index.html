<p><p>Keeping in mind that I actually like where I'm working and the work that I do...we've outsourced the building of perl on Unix and that of any modules that need to be compiled (it took several rounds w/our tech support to find this out...it used to be them that built it). I can't compile even a simple module that involves xs (which is why I installed ActiveState on the laptop and do as much as I can there especially if I want compiled modules). The package provider has two packages that I'm aware of. Our department is using the 5.6.1 package, it includes DBD::Oracle, but it was compiled against an 8.x version of Oracle client libraries. We have Oracle version 10.2 installed on the development systems, though on production, it's 8.x and so DBI/DBD::Oracle works fine there. The perl 5.8.x package was compiled against Oracle version 10, but we're not yet going to upgrade and run regression testing against all the current stuff.</p>
<p>Then I found through the magic of google that <code>chatr .../lib/perl/site_perl/..../auto/DBD/Oracle/Oracle.sl </code> shows (on HP-UX, don't know where else), among other things, the files that DBD::Oracle needs to dynamically link to. Someone watching the output of this command asked, "Why don't you just copy those files to the system?". Huh. Duh! Hmm, do I have write permission to the $ORACLE_HOME lib directory? Hell, yes! (Surprise to me!). Copied those files from the production system, and hey, it works! Now I can continue developing, and testing, and stuff! :-)</p></p>
