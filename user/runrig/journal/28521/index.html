<p><p>Keeping in mind that I do no admin'ing (system/network or otherwise) whatsoever, I haven't a clue what would make my <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Net-CIDR-Lite/">Net-CIDR-Lite</a>
more useful or correct to those that might want to use it for some practical purpose, and probably ought to give it away to someone who knows/cares more about such things. I read <a href="http://www.enterasys.com/support/manuals/RtrSvcsMgr2.1/docs/a_at_prefs.html">in one place</a> that the net mask should be a number from 8-32, and I see in my code I allow it to be 2-32 and I have no recollection why I started at 2. And then someone emailed me that I should allow '0.0.0.0/0' because its a catch-all address that is useful. Wikipedia says I should allow <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing">0-32</a>, so I guess it ought to be ok to change it. And just changing '2' to '0' in the code doesn't seem to introduce any horrible side effects :-)</p>
<p>Another issue in the same email was that the module dies on error from bad input, and that it ought to instead return undef and have some error code (from a package variable or method). At first I said that an option to do that would be ok, but now that I think about it, it really just introduces useless cruft, and if you really wanted to, you could write a wrapper module to do that. The requestor was under the misguided notion that 'eval' was bad, and didn't know that 'eval { BLOCK }' is idiomatic perl exception catching.</p></p>

<h2>Nowt wrong with eval{}</h2>

But you might want to try replacing confess() with croak() by default.  You can always turn a croak() into a confess() at runtime with <code>use Carp 'verbose';</code>.
