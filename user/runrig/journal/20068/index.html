<p><p>I was hacking some more on <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/djberg96/journal/19078">dgberg96's SQL thing</a> and added some entry fields for database name and a limit on the # of rows fetched. I still like using vim to do on-the-fly sql though because response time is quicker, I can easily search for something, and I can cut 'n paste. But it's still fun to play with Tk. I coded another little toy which just had 2 entry fields and 4 buttons and would display the result of adding or multiplying (i.e. 4 * 3 = 12, 4 + 3 = 7, etc.), and I got tired of always typing "->pack(-side => 'left')", and wondered how I could make this easier. This worked:<pre>
sub Tk::lpack { shift->pack(-side=>"left", @_) }
</pre>
Now I can just say <code>$widget->lpack</code>. I wonder if there was a better way...</p>
<p>This weekend, I was the designated "computer person" at my folks house when my dad needed to buy a printer. So we got a HP 1350xi, which seemed like a good fit space/feature/and price-wise. Since printers don't seem to come with parallel ports anymore, and this was an older system, we also got a 2-port USB card. Got home, plugged in the card, and Windows detects the card and asks for the Windows 98 CD. What CD? This was a second hand system and we don't have no stinkin' Win98 CDs. Oh well. It seems to install anyway from the CAB directory, but I'm not real sure. Then we go through the whole printer driver/software installation, and get to the part where it's supposed to detect the printer, and doesn't :(   So the problem is one of many things (card, card driver installation, cable, printer...), but no way to tell what exactly with what we have on hand. Maybe bring win cd's next time, an extra USB cable, an extra computer...</p>
<p>Also while we were at it, he renewed a Norton anti-virus subscription, and that Live-Update has got to be the worst thing for dialup users. The connection didn't drop, but the download would quit, and you would have to restart the whole live-update program to continue. There were 9 components to download totalling about 9MB, which over a 34kb connection took a while. Some of the components, when they finished downloading, want to reboot the system, which there's no way to get out of, and so you have to reconnect the dialup, and also restart the LiveUpdate. Plus every time you had to restart the LiveUpdate, the download numbers made it look like you were starting all over, though from the time it took it must've been resuming from where it left off (Me to dad: "They're just numbers, you can't believe 'em").</p></p>
