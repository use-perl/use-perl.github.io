<p>In other news, <a href="http://film.guardian.co.uk/apnews/story/0,1276,-3135844,00.html">Tommy Chong is in jail</a>. Do you feel safer now?</p>

<h2>arch criminals beware!</h2>

I'm glad that the authorities have time to crack down on arch criminals like Chong. The world is a far safer place now it's harder to buy bongs on the internet. Now I'd be forced to go to one of the stores on the high street and buy one. Of course they're sensible enough to point out they are only for smoking tobacco, what else would you need a water bong for?



<h2>Sorry for the old link</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/runrig/">runrig</a> on 2003-10-29T07:05:38</h3>
All of the links that I could find were a month old, and state that he was not yet in jail. I read an editorial in the <a href="http://www.ocregister.com/" title="ocregister.com">OC Register</a ocregister.com> today at lunch which indicated that he recently was sent to jail. I found that you can read the editorial online if you log in (it's free). An excerpt:<blockquote><div> <p><em>In fact, as the Los Angeles Times reported Oct. 10, Assistant U.S. Attorney Mary Houghton&#8217;s court pleadings sought Chong&#8217;s harsh punishment because he got rich "glamorizing the illegal distribution and use of marijuana" in films that "trivialize law enforcement efforts to combat drug trafficking and use."</em></p>
   <p>Chong must have wondered when such activities became criminal.</p>  </div></blockquote>
