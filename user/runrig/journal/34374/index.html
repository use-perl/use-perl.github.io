<p>I understand it's their (work's) computer and they can do anything they want to it, but I was using <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/TorgoX/journal/29369">TorgoX's homepage</a> on Firefox (I also copied his Unicode Sliderule locally, and use that in the homepage link), when an update was pushed to my computer from the company servers. After which I noticed that the homepage had changed to the company's intranet main page (which I have as a bookmark, but which I rarely want to see at all, let alone when I start up Firefox). Also, when I reset the home page through the normal Tools->Options, it didn't stick, and would revert when I restarted. I saw a suspicious entry in user.js, changed that, and now all is well. For now.</p>

<p>&#8220;The sterility of offices is supposed to suggest efficiency. But suggesting efficiency is a different thing from actually being efficient. The atmosphere of the average workplace is to productivity what flames painted on the side of a car are to speed.&#8221; &#8212;<cite>Paul Graham, <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/opensource.html" title="paulgraham.com">What Business Can Learn from Open Source</a paulgraham.com> </cite> </p>
