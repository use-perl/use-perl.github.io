<div class="span8">
<p><p>We implemented a new log table at a customer site which was supposed to log new orders and track changes to existing orders. Except changes to existing orders that weren't logged yet were logged as new orders. I thought this was going to be implemented before they went live, so it'd be okay. Of course it wasn't :)</p>
<p>So I wrote a script to correctly log all orders created before the log-implementation date, using alot of DBI selectall_* and selectrow_* methods (I hadn't used them for awhile, so I had to check the docs for arguments and found the Slice parameter to select rows of data as hashrefs).</p>
<p>So the boss says, "Before you run it, run it by so-and-so (who is on-site) to see if he thinks it's okay." After finishing the script, I ask so-and-so if he wants to see it, but after I tell him it's in perl, he says no-thanks. Just before running it, I seem to lose the VPN connection to the site, and can't run it. We decided to have the guys on-site install Perl. Just as I start writing up an email on how to install perl/DBI/DBD::ODBC from <a href="http://www.activestate.com>ActiveState</a> (and my own shortcut module to connect to our databases), I get the connection back and run it myself.</p>
<p>I had a minor glitch, but I logged all the changes I made, so I was able to undo them (via another perl script), fix the original script, and run it again.</p>
<p>Thank you Larry, Tim, Jeff, and everyone else! :-)
<br>(From a satisfied customer and still employed employee, though wishing he were at OSCON)</p></p>
