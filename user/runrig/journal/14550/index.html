<p><p>Oh boy. We have Cox cable, and they've started something called Retro-Saturday mornings. With Sid and Marty Kroft "classics" like Land of the Lost, Sigmund the Sea Monster, H.R. Puffnstuff, and some I barely remember like Wonderbug and Magic Mongo. For good or bad, now my kids can watch the same crap that I did on Saturday mornings (and watch it they did :-)</p>
<p>And now that I've dated myself, also, <a href="http://www.knx1070.com/">a local radio station (KNX 1070 in LA)</a> plays <a href="http://www.knx1070.com/program/drama.html">old time radio shows</a> nightly at 9pm, and we've often been turning the tv off and listening to that instead. The kids like The Lone Ranger, they've also been playing Gunsmoke, The Shadow, and Dragnet. Our favorite has been Box 13, about a guy who is kind of like the Equalizer, except he's a writer who receives letters (at Box 13, get it :) and solves your problem for free (well, his "payment" is that he gets to write about it later).</p></p>

Where are you physically located (roughly), and what frequency?
<p>
No place where I live is going to run such programs, and I'd be curious to hear a few of them.  I've toyed with the notion of buying, say, _The Shadow_ complete, but I'd like to ensure that it's something I'd like first.</p>

<p>I'm around the Los Angeles area, and the station is <a href="http://www.knx1070.com/" title="knx1070.com">KNX 1070</a knx1070.com> (main post updated w/links also). Looking at the web site, it looks like even if you're not in the area, you can listen to the broadcast online.</p>
