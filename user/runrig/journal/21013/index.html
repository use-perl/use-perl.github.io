<p><p>Well, <a href="http://www.farscape.com/">Farscape</a> isn't back until next month, but any guesses (no fair if you really know) on how they explain the end of the last show?</p>
<p>Next week, though, <a href="http://www.bbcamerica.com/genre/drama_mysteries/hamish_macbeth/hamish_macbeth.jsp">Hamish
MacBeth</a> is back (in reruns) on BBC America. If you haven't seen this show, you should (if you can). I could say it's sort of a cross between Columbo and Northern Exposure, but that would probably be a really bad comparison, so I won't say that. I will say that if it was on DVD, I'd buy it.</p>
<p>I first saw Hamish a few years ago around midnight, when they happened to be playing what was the final two episodes of the series. They were wrapping up alot of loose ends, but I couldn't really tell that they were loose ends until I saw the rest of the series. All I could tell was that it was a hoot.  My wife said she started to watch a previous broadcast of it, but that it "just seemed kind of weird", so she didn't see much of it. I forced her to watch it later, and now we're both hooked. We've even started buying the books that the show is based on. Some of the names and places are the same in the books and tv show, but the stories are completely different, and we enjoy them both :)</p></p>
