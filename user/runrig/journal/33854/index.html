<div class="span8">
<p><p>I've found a workaround for one of <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/runrig/journal/33842">yesterday's annoyances</a>, at least the one where a "folder compare" function (not really a file directory) in Informatica PowerCenter doesn't really compare everything in the folders. You can export folders as XML documents, so that's what I did, and then used <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/XML-Diff/">XML::Diff</a> to compare the documents.</p>
<p>Except that some of the elements in one document are not in the same order as the other document, and although I don't care, XML::Diff does. There are some commercial tools that will compare unordered XML elements, and I ran across one that I guess was free <a href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/user/yuanwang/xdiff.html">but is no longer.</a></p>
<p>So it was <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/XML-Filter-Sort/">XML::Filter::Sort</a> to the rescue (thank you <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/grantm/">grantm</a> - and all the other XML folks), and I just sorted all the elements
where I didn't care about the order, and then diffed the results. Several of the elements where
just sorted by the name attribute, so I
made a bunch of sorters in one go:(Updated code: Needed "./" prefix on NAME)</p><pre>
my @sorters = (
  map {
    XML::Filter::Sort->new(
      Record => $_,
      Keys => [ ['./@NAME'] ],
    )
  )  @list_of_elements
);
</pre>
<p>I also wrote my first actual XML::SAX parser
for the task of deleting some attributes
where I didn't care about differences in values.</p>
<p>And some of the attributes had encoded control
characters in them e.g. <code>&#10;&#13;</code>,
and those just came out as spaces, and for the
purposes of this, I didn't care, but in other
situations, I might care, so I'm wondering if there's
a way to preserve those. Though I hear from a
reliable secondhand source that there is no
reliable way to preserve them :-(</p></p>

<h2>Alternatively: XML::SemanticDiff</h2>

Could you have used <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/shlomif/XML-SemanticDiff-0.96/" title="cpan.org">XML::SemanticDiff</a cpan.org> instead? That seems to do what you want...

I looked at XML::SemanticDiff, and XML::Diff seems to suit my purposes better.  XML::SemanticDiff tells you that there's a difference and where the difference is, and XML::Diff tells you all that plus what the difference is, though the output is more verbose. And I would still have to sort and filter things to see the actual differences that I want to see.
