<p>Pledge breaks are annoying enough when <a href="http://www.pbs.org">PBS</a> is playing something that is actually worth watching, but the jokes really on me when I watch something as bad as <a href="http://www.pbs.org/search/search_programsaz.html#0-9">The 60's Experience</a>, which seemed to be just a 2 1/2 hour commercial for <a href="http://www.shoppbs.org/product/index.jsp?productId=1986749">the accompanying CD</a>. In the entire 2 1/2 hours, there was about 20 minutes of watchable television.  There was one bright spot, the only
performer who I'd still pay money to see perform his 60's hits is Eric Burdon (of The Animals). He's the only one who doesn't seem like he's just rehashing the
same old song for the zillionth time.</p>
<p>A close second was John Kay (of Steppenwolf), who at least had some energy and appeared to
actually enjoy playing the same songs for the
zillionth time.</p>
<p>As for the rest of them, I forgive'em (as if they care), because I know a musician has to make a living somehow, so I hope they at least made a small chunka'change off of this.</p>
<p>The evening was not a total loss though, because shortly afterward, switching to <a href="http://www.vh1.com/channels/vh1_classic/channel.jhtml">VH1 classics</a>, I caught <a href="http://www.ramones.com/">The Ramones</a> doing Rock N Roll High School, and <a href="http://www.warr.org/rodgers.html">Free</a> doing <a href="http://www.allrightnow.com/">All Right Now</a>, which is probably the all-time greatest two-chord (three if you count the chorus) song (and <a href="http://www.paulrodgers.com/">Paul Rodgers</a> has the second-greatest rock voice of all time, bar none :-)</p>
<p>Update: Correction. The alltime greatest two chord song is "Roadrunner". Today anyway. Depends on which way the planets are aligned.</p></p>
