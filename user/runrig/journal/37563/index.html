<p><p>Once upon a time <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_Corps_Air_Station_El_Toro">there was a marine base</a>.  And it was decommissioned. And there was some discussion over what to do with the space left by the decommissioned marine base. Some people wanted an airport, some people wanted a park. There was a vote. <a href="http://www.ocgp.org/gpb/default.asp">And the park people won.</a></p>
<p>And <a href="http://www.arlo.net/">Arlo Guthrie</a> <a href="http://www.ocgp.org/news/displaynews.asp?NewsID=116">played</a> while a big orange balloon went up and down. And everyone who "thought that guy was dead"[1] got to hear Alice's Restaurant (for free!), and lots of other songs and stories, and it was funny, and entertaining, and a wonderful time was had by all. But we didn't get there early enough to get passes for the Orange Balloon :-(</p>
<p>So a few weeks later, we went back earlier to get passes, rode the Orange Balloon, and listened to some more music (a <a href="http://www.petejacobsbands.com/">"Wartime Radio Revue"</a>, which was cool, but not Arlo Guthrie... :-), and a wonderful time was had by all (again) :-)</p>
<p>[1] I called my wife Friday morning when I heard on the radio about the show:</p><ul>
<li>Me: "Hey, Arlo Guthrie is playing tomorrow night"
<li>Her: "Isn't he dead?"
</ul>
<p>The first thing he said onstage was "I bet some of you heard about this and said "I thought that guy was dead..."</p></p>
