<p><p>I can't remember the last time I had any spam (the canned kind, not the e-spam variety). Since we had some leftover after a fake authentic Hawaiian themed party where I was told that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0935848495/">you just gotta have spam</a>...actually, we just put the cans out on the buffet table for decoration along with the cans of Vienna sausages...anyway, I fried it up and put together a breakfast sandwich. Mmmm, mmm.</p>
<p>And the kids have been getting their first taste of it too (by itself and in mac 'n' cheese). At least one of them likes it, and when one of them asked "What is spam?", I answered "Umm, ... it's canned ham!" Yeah, that's it...close enough, anyway :-)</p></p>

<h2>Canned++</h2>

I haven't had the canned spam in a while, but I'm also fond of the canned corned beef of the same canned shape. Sometimes you just need crappy food w/ cheese and bread.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)



<h2>I love Spam[tm]</h2>

<p>I really like Spam; my wife hates it.  To me, fried, it's like bacon.</p>

<p>Strangely enough, my wife likes Vienna Sausages, which I always thought were gross.  She's now got our little boy eating them.  I tried one and it no longer seemed gross, but tasteless.</p>

<p>Also try Treat, a Spam-alike.  It's quite different; I believe it has honey or brown sugar in it.  It's also usually cheaper, costing about one U.S. dollar or so.</p>

I don't care for Vienna sausages either.  Fried Spam is not too bad.  Fried Treat really is a treat to eat.

SPAM. Curry.<br><br>Yum.
