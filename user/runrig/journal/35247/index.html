<p><p>Today is the day I'm glad I never got rid of all my vinyl. Though I haven't heard any of it for about 12 years, I've managed to to hang on to most of it...and the irony is that although my wife is the one who has encouraged jettisoning the records, she's the one who gave me the turntable w/the USB connection (big thank you to you dear).</p>
<p>So, what to record first? A while back, I did sell my copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Generic-Flipper/dp/B000002LTK/">Generic Flipper</a>, and I'm still kicking myself for that, though I do still have <a href="http://www.geocities.com/flipper_still_rule/flipperltd.html">Public Flipper Limited</a>, but that's not exactly a family friendly album (I'll record that one some late night or when no one's home). I've also got some 78's of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Violin-Sonata-Kreutzer-Digital-Remaster/dp/B0011XHENG">Yehudi and Hephzibah Menuhin playing Beethoven's Sonata No. 9 in A (Op. 47 "Kreutzer Sonata")</a>, but I don't yet have a 78 needle, so I'll leave that one for now. And besides, Amazon seems to have it, though I'm not sure if their 6:48 version is what I have (what is the play time of 4 78 disks anyway?).</p>
<p>So first up on the platter is <a href="http://www.rockabillyeurope.com/artists/jon.htm">Jon and the Nightriders</a>, which seems to have been never released to CD, though it's the greatest surf album ever recorded...IMHO :-) Hmmm, if it says on the album "Unauthorized copying, hiring, lending, public performance, and broadcasting of this record would be appreciated", I wonder if that includes permission to post one or two tunes on YouTube? Well, until I figure that out, this disk join my other two new disks/presents in heavy rotation on my car stereo...<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=moby+grape">Moby Grape</a>(Listen My Friends) and <a href="http://www.myspace.com/cowboynationfans">Cowboy Nation</a>(Journey Out of Time).</p></p>
