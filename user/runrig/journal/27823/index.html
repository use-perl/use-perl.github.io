<p>Next week I'm going to try and push for ditching our current horribly bass ackwards and oft broken version control system and start using Subversion. Fingers crossed.</p>

I managed to get our company to switch from CVS to subversion.  It took a while, but mostly due to inertia.  The best bit is that when we'd switched, everybody said "What's the big deal?" which is a tribute to how well subversion matches CVS' feature set.

I've been showing it to co-workers in the office here, and they're convinced it's a good idea (I did have to explain more than once that creating another branch DOESN'T create another physical copy of your data). The people I have to convince are in our other office on the other side of the continent, which I'm visiting next week. And concurrent checkout and merge tools are scary to people who are used to locking a file on checkout, and manually making the same changes in multiple versions of code.

Some person at my work is still convinced that locking on checkout is a good idea, despite using CVS / subversion for 5 years.  Old habits die hard.  Even when I show off <a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/EdiffMode" title="emacswiki.org">ediff</a emacswiki.org>...

Ooooh, I want one. This may just be the incentive I needed to learn emacs. TortoiseMerge is ok, but it only has 2 way merging, and WinMerge costs money<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)
And I've played with Vim diff mode, but I haven't  looked into what merge functionality is available, so I'll have to look into that also (depending on what's there, it may put a crimp in my emacs education<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
