<p>The internet is a strange universe where we mostly know one another (or don't really know one another) through bits and bytes and blog entries and email. It was through <a href="http://www.perlmonks.org">PerlMonks</a> that I first knew of <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/VSarkiss">VSarkiss</a>, and found that he lived relatively nearby, and we met up once. It was about a year ago (more or less) that he came to be working at the same place I was through a different consulting agency (though it's a big company so I didn't see him much). Then he disappeared, I emailed him and never heard back,  and finally just recently I got around to asking someone about him, and was told that he passed away. So long Vahe... :'-(</p>

<h2>I'm sorry to hear this</h2>

<p>I always looked forward to his replies on Perlmonks.  He seemed like a decent guy.</p>



<h2>By the way</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Ovid/">Ovid</a> on 2008-06-30T14:55:31</h3>
<p>Could you crosspost this to Perlmonks?  I think some folks there would like to know.  I was going post it, but it seems right that you do so.</p>
