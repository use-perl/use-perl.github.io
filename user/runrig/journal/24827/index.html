<div class="span8">
<p><p>Hmm, I wonder how much spam I'm likely to get by registering on <a href="http://www.imdb.com/">IMDB</a>?  Probably not much more than I'm already getting...so I left a review for <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0338075/">Grand Theft Parsons</a>, which, though it is based on a true story and takes extreme liberties with the facts, I thought was a fun film, a good tale of friendship (one of the friends involved being dead), and funny to boot. Somehow I wasn't very aware of this film when it first came out, and it's now making the rounds on cable, so I recommend watching it if you can.</p>
<p>It's funny the reviews on IMDB that seem to be mostly divided into the "I'm a big fan of Gram's music and I hate this film" and the "I've never/barely heard of him and thought it was a good/great film" camps. So I must be odd because I love his music and I enjoyed the film, but I don't expect everyone else to. As far as the music goes, Gram Parsons is probably single handedly responsible for the Rolling Stones going country (e.g. Wild Horses), the Eagles, and country rock in general (which just goes to show that one person's reason to appreciate him may be another's reason to dismiss him). Me, I like his music, but then I also like banjo, bagpipes, and the desert...(and this film has some good desert scenes, though no bagpipes, and I don't think any banjos).</p>
<p>I would take the advice of someone else around here (cog?) that said that you should just go into a film knowing as little as possible about it. There are lots of parts of the film that I could ruin for others, so I'll try not to.  One of the best jokes was in the last 3 seconds of the film, but unless you know about it, you don't know it's funny until later, but if you know about it ahead of time, the joke is ruined. There, I don't think that's a spoiler :-)</p>
<p>What, another completely non-perl related post? Ok, if Gram were a programmer, what kind of programmer would he be? Ah, nevermind.</p>
<p>Update: I'd like to qualify this non-review by saying that I really like this movie <em>for a low-budget and high-quantity-of-bad-acting</em>  sort of movie. Viewer beware :-)</p></p>

<p>Even though I am now a strong believer of that principle, the original idea was <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/Alias/journal/23820" title="perl.org">not mine</a perl.org>.</p>
