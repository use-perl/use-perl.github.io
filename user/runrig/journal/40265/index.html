<p><p>I've been using <a href="http://"gearman.org">Gearman</a> a lot lately with <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Gearman-XS/">Gearman::XS</a>. In an effort to reduce boilerplate, I've released <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/GearmanX-Starter/">GearmanX::Starter</a> to launch Gearman workers.</p>
<p>Other features of the module are signal handling, where if a worker gets a SIGTERM, it'll finish any current task before terminating. To get this to work, I had to use <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Perl-Unsafe-Signals/>Perl::Unsafe::Signals</a>, otherwise you could not terminate the process while the worker was waiting for a job. It would only terminate after getting a new task from the server (causing the task to fail).</p>
<p>I had an interesting issue converting a worker script to using my GX::S module though...One line had <code>$job->send_complete(1);</code> which tells gearman to send the result "1" and a status of "complete" to the client. However, I was getting an error of "gearman_con_flush:write:14" when the worker was trying to wait for the next job. This didn't happen before I started using GX::S, but it was fixed when I changed the code to <code>$job->send_complete("1");</code> (with quotes). I can not come up with a simple test case, but just in case someone else has the same issue, here's the possible work around.</p>
<p>Update: This is with Gearman::XS 0.7. It doesn't seem to occur with 0.8, so perhaps it's time to upgrade :-)</p></p>
