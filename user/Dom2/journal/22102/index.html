<p><p>After seeing the article on <a href="http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/onlamp/2004/11/18/extending_ruby.html">Extending Ruby with C</a>, I thought "I wonder how easy that would be in Perl?"  The article is mostly about providing access to the <a href="http://tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2004/02/20/GenxStatus">Genx</a> library.  So, I spent a little while playing with it and came up <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/XML-Genx">XML::Genx</a>.  I don't know whether Perl <em>needed</em> another XML writing library; <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/XML-SAX-Writer">XML::SAX::Writer</a> is pretty good.  But Genx has some really useful features.</p>

<ul>
<li>Doesn't require SAX.  :-)</li>
<li>Will not output non-well-formed XML.</li>
<li>Always outputs UTF-8.</li>
<li>Ouputs <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xml-c14n">canonical XML</a>, which makes for much easier testing.</li>
</ul>

<p>Anyway, it's been an interesting exercise.  My C skills needed bringing out of storage, although I made few really daft mistakes.  XS is still an "interesting" tool to work with.  Coding at that level certainly makes you appreciate how high level Perl is.</p>

<p>On the whole though, the most useful surprise has been <a href="http://testers.cpan.org/show/XML-Genx.html#XML-Genx-0.05">CPAN Testers</a>.  That's a really good way to find out that the world isn't just as FreeBSD faced as it looks like to me.  Now all I need to do is figure out how to get a development environment working under <a href="http://testers.cpan.org/show/XML-Genx.html#XML-Genx-0.05">windows</a>.</p>

You know, when I saw that on the CPAN recent modules list I'd wondered if it had been prompted by the article.  Good to know people are reading my stuff<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)

Your assertions about XS in there were quite correct.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)

<p>The other thing I really admire about the ruby version is the block syntax.  Of course, it's <em>possible</em> in Perl, just ugly.  And no, I refuse to use a source filter.

</p><p>But yes, thanks for the inspiration!

Another thing that wasn't mentioned in the article, but which is present in the latest version is a builder mode, so you can do stuff like this:
<p><blockquote><div> <tt>require 'genx/builder'<br> <br>w = GenX::Writer.new(STDOUT)<br> <br>w.builder do |b|<br>&nbsp; b.foo do<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; b.bar('blah')<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; b.bar('zot')<br>&nbsp; end<br>end</tt> </div></blockquote> <p>
And get output like this:
</p><p><blockquote><div> <tt>&lt;foo&gt;<br>&nbsp; &lt;bar&gt;blah&lt;/bar&gt;<br>&nbsp; &lt;bar&gt;zot&lt;/bar&gt;<br>&lt;/foo&gt;</tt> </div></blockquote>This also caches elements and attributes so they don't get recreated each time through, and it adds pretty printing, so the output is easier to read.  I need to go through and make it more configurable though, and write docs, and tests, and actually find a use for it so I don't feel like I'm wasting my time<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)

I'm glad I'm not the only one implemented it "because it looks interesting".<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)

<p>That said, it's one of those things that I'm sure I'll find a use for before long, probably at work.

Looking closer at that, I implemented something <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/XML-SAX-Builder/" title="cpan.org">similiar</a cpan.org> before...  That was interesting; I wanted to see how closures and SAX would go together.
