<p>Recently I needed to find someone's mailing address, so I went to one of those "people finders" that promises to be free just so you will go to their site. <br/><br/>I found who I was looking for and then I went to pay for the full address. They asked me for my credit card (normal) but they also asked me for my daytime phone and different address (not normal). That's when I realized that the instant I give them this information, they are going to add me to their database! <br/><br/>Then I checked their FAQ and I found this one to be funny:<br/><br/>Q: How do I remove myself from these records?<br/><br/>A: We value your privacy and, upon request, can block your records from being shown in many, but not all, of our search results. To do so, you should contact us by writing a letter giving us your:<br/><br/>   1. Complete social security number
   2. First name
   3. Last name
   4. Middle initial
   5. Aliases and A.K.A.'s
   6. Complete current address
   7. Complete former addresses going back 20 years
   8. Date of Birth - including month, day, and year<br/><br/>It is also very helpful to include a print out of the records that you wish to have suppressed.<br/><br/>(This, of course, means that you would have to purchase the very records you want removed!)
