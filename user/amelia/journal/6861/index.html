<p>Hello again.<br/><br/>I've been quite quiet recently. Work has been busy. I'm slowly getting into more Perl stuff though.<br/><br/>Yesterday there was a London.pm Heretics meeting. No, wait, "New Heretics" meeting. It's all quite confusing - the official London.pm meetings are on the day after the first Wednesday of the month, and the New Heretics meet when... wait. I'm sure this was clear when dumrats explained this to me in the pub last night. Very confusing.<br/><br/>Anyway, the meeting last night was quit riotous. A lot of beer was involved. And port. And wine. It got quite silly, and I think someone had a camcorder too.<br/><br/>I've been worrying about the current London.pm leader recently. Organising the herd of cats that is Perl Mongers seems to be taking its toll on him. He's been doing a great job, but perhaps something needs to be done. Hmmm.</p>
