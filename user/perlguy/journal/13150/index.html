So, I downloaded Metallica's new CD over the weekend.  No, I didn't use a terrible, evil P2P program... I simply went to the NNTP newsgroups and got it like I always do...
</p>
<p>
Anyway, I am SOOOOOOOOOO glad that I didn't pay even a penny for this steaming pile of crap!  It sounds like they were TRYING so desperately to make music, but failed miserably...
</p>
<p>
I was so overjoyed that they were able to work the "F" word into a song also - that way they can get the "Parental Advisory" sticker on the CD and millions of grade-school kiddies will buy it!
</p>
<p>
Man, what a piece of crap.

That sentiment is pretty common.  Not about the new Metallica album in particular, but about the state of the entertainment industry in general.
<p>
The New York Times <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/06/29/arts/29RICH.html?ex=1057464000&amp;en=628bb9a64032eda2&amp;ei=5062&amp;partner=GOOGLE" title="nytimes.com">wrote about that</a nytimes.com> this weekend.  For all of the hew and cry that people are killing the music industry with p2p because no one wants to pay for "entertainment" anymore, the new Harry Potter book sells 5M copies in the US its first day on sale.
</p><p>
Why?  Because people are still willing to buy music (and books, and movie tickets and<nobr> <wbr></nobr>....) if it's <i>worth paying for</i>!
</p><p>
Case in point: I got to see <i>The Matrix Reloaded</i> at YAPC for a steep discount, and I still want my $8 back.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)</p>

$8 is a <i>steeply discounted price</i>?  I guess I haven't been to the movies in a <b>long</b> time...

No.  The steeply discounted price was <i>free</i>, but I still want my $8 back.  The movie was <i>that</i> bad.  The only redeeming feature were the other 99 perlfolk sniping at the film:

<p>
So true. If only record labels and movie makers in particular would wake up to that fact.
</p><p>
I actually bought the Metallica CD, mainly because of the limited edition DVD accompanyment. Anyone even thinking the same as I, please don't bother. You are setting yourself up for extreme disappointment. The Linkin Park CD&amp;DVD edition of Meteora on the hand is well worth the extra &#194;&#163;3 it cost me.
</p><p>
I find it extremely arrogant of Metallica to have so heavy handedly attacked the P2P networking apps, and claim they were losing money, when they produce such "6th-form" tosh such as their latest effort. I had seen several posts on the newsgroups, with follow-ups stating things like "not-metallica its a covers band" and other derrogatory statements. I gave them the benefit of the doubt and downloaded and came to the same conclusion. It wasn't metallica. Having bought the CD, I can confer it was indeed Metallica performing such embarrassing drivel.
</p><p>
I wonder how many fans they expect at the concerts? I sincerely hope the numbers drop off, once they hear the album.</p>

This is the classic justification.. usually sounds something like this -- "I download it, and if I like it then I go buy it."; let's face it, for the majority of downloaders this is a crock and not what happens. They download and keep on listening, never buying.

</p><p>The other lame justification I detest is, "Well I couldn't afford it -- so I never would have bought whether I could download it or not.  So my downloading it didn't cost them anything.".  It boggles my mind how this makes sense to anybody. Does your personally inability to afford something you want somehow grant you the right to thereby take it?  I want my 745i fully loaded -- can't afford it; does that mean I can just go take it?

metallica sold out its show in 22 minutes. what has linkin park done that?  Pry Not!
It just goes to show you that more and more people are buying into the pop propaganda that linkin park promotes.

Hell, I <em>re</em>bought _Black Celebration_ recently because I couldn't locate my long-ago legitimately purchased copy.  (I spent maybe half an hour trying to figure out if the whole album was downloadable, but I also remembered that my liner notes and case had been destroyed.  I actually felt like buying it again.)
<p>
I considered it a well-spent 12 and change, despite the fact that my original purchase of it was at a Marden's for 2 whole dollars.  (Which was, thank you, practically theft.  So worth it.)
</p><p>
I was happy to have the music again, got it home, and promptly ripped it so I'd have the music whenever I felt like.  The CD went back in the case, and I'm going to store it a little more carefully this time.</p>

<h2>Black Celebration</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/vek/">vek</a> on 2003-07-01T17:53:54</h3>
Damn good album.  Any album that has 'Fly On The Windscreen', 'Stripped' and 'New Dress' *has* to be good in my book.  Not quite the best album DM ever did as I think Violator is *slightly* better but Black Celebration is an extremely good album nonetheless<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

I was actually looking at _Violator_ just before I decided to pick up _Celebration_ again.  The decision hinged on something an old friend of mine told me years ago, that DM's style had varied significantly at times.
<p>
Or, I'm on crack, and that's not what they told me.  Any comparisons in terms of style/speed/etc. that would be pertinent in me deciding whether or not to buy _Violator_?

I don't have a problem supporting Depeche Mode.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:D</p>

Just get both of them<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br> <br>I suppose Black Celebration is a little 'darker' than Violator but at the end of the day you won't be disappointed with either.

Violator is hardly a "Poor" album, but it is the most commercial of all their albums.  It is not entirely that they changed their style to pander to a wider audience, at least some of the popularity can be attributed to the audience coming in-line for a brief period.<br> <br>"Black Celebration" is an album I feel is better, "Construction Time Again" is very good as well. ( all opinions my own ).<br> <br>A good purchase I have enjoyed was "Singles 81-85" for their original stuff.

The 'Singles 81-85' album was actually the first DM album I bought.  "Shake The Disease" and "It's Called A Heart" had recently been on the charts (in the UK anyway) so I bought the album because I liked those two songs.  From there I realized that I liked *all* the songs the album and then proceeded to buy everything DM ever did.  Blimey, can't believe that was 18 years ago - where does the time go?

<h2>Lame excuse to justify your crime</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Sifmole/">Sifmole</a> on 2003-08-06T13:07:22</h3>
Of course there were so many other ways to figure out the album was horrid.<br> <br>1) read the reviews<br>2) ask others who have purchased it<br> <br>Want the info first hand?<br> <br>1) listen to the songs on the radio -- there are at least two singles out, and guess what... they stink.<br> <br>2) Most large music chains allow you to listen to almost their entire catalog these days.  Go there dial-up the album -- spend 10 minutes, realize... it stinks.  Okay, you are Robin Hood and don't want to give money to the big evil companies.  Go there, use their stuff, and then go buy your albums at a Mom&amp;Pop.<br> <br>3) Don't want to leave your house?  Check out Amazon and listen to the previews -- good enough to figure out the album stinks.<br> <br>There are so many options to figuring out whether the album is good or not  -- you can hardly justify your piracy by pointing out that AFTER you already pirated it, you decided it was lousy.
