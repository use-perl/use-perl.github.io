<p><blockquote><i>The river is moving away from the city. The city is sinking because of its weight, because no upbuilding by new muck for many decades, because of being cut off from the fresh water, because it is sliding off a cliff (the Continental Shelf), and because the Oil and Gas Industry is extracting oil out from under it. It is a city that for all intents and purposes is now Sea domain.

Ignore the tree-hugger stuff.  The facts concur with other neutral authors, but the article summarizes things nicely.</p>

<p>We will spend billions to rebuild it for the next big hurricane to wipe it off the map again. We should rethink the whole damn thing.</p>



<h2>A damned shame</h2>

I remember standing on a street corner in New Orleans on New Year's Eve 2000, closing my eyes, and concentrating on my other senses.<p>
From different directions all around me, I could hear wildly different music, exotic (to my Ozarks ears) accents, and smell all sorts of delicious foods.  It was magic.</p><p>
And I had the best freshly-fried potato chip there too - yes, that's "chip" not "chips".  The place used a Craftsman drill to drive most of a whole potato through a food processor blade, resulting in a wispy thin single curl that seemed to be a yard long!  That went into the fryer, skin on the edge and all.</p><p>
When it was done, it got a little salt and was plopped in front of me.  Never has a potato tasted so good, or been eaten so fast!</p><p>

<p>It's a shame the people who have left New Orleans won't remember how to do those things in other cities.

</p><p>BTW, they do the same thing with the potato at the Wurst Wagon at the First Saturday computer sale in Dallas each month.  It's delicious, although I haven't had one in years, ever since I discovered I liked bratwurst.</p>
