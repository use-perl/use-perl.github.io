<p>At <URL:http://www.fema.gov/graphics/about/what.gif>, you'll find the graphic that Jon Stewart described as being on the site as recently as a few weeks ago.  It shows how FEMA's mission starts with a disaster, which leads to a response, recovery, mitigation, risk reduction, prevention, and preparedness, which leads (at their own admission), right back to <b>disaster</b>.  Wow.
<p>
They removed the link and text, but they haven't removed the image from the website yet.  Chuckle while you can.</p>

<i>which leads (at their own admission), right back to disaster.</i>
<p>Yeah, particularly with Brownie's sad performance this is funny out of context.

</p><p>However, I don't think anyone is saying the Gov't <b>shouldn't</b> use feedback from what worked and didn't work in the last disaster in preparation for the next disasters.  And given the wide variety and finite nature of the taxation power, I trust no one is claiming that an adequate government could prevent <b>all</b> disaster. We may be able to limit the impact... but prevent, no.
</p><p>Tornadoes, Hurricanes, and Earthquakes just aren't amenable to out-right prevention. We can prevent some of their impact by adequate zoning, planning, and the like, but as the bumper sticker says, <b>shit happens</b>.  And lovers of liberty are rightly incensed if the government refuses to let people do some of the stupid things we'd have to prevent to avoid ANY impact. Lots of folks are getting their shorts in a twist about preventing people moving back into they under-sea-level areas of NOLA, because they see it as a social engineering thing -- maybe to some, but to FEMA and COE, it's engineering. They're trying to prevent<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... and the liberals (race relations) and conservatives (property rights) and libertarians (freedom to be stupid) are against them.
</p><p>Cheers!</p>
