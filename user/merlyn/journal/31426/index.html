<h2>My votes don't get counted, anyway</h2>

<p>I want to vote "other" for every race, but in my state there's no way to do that.  So I intend to do it by voting for myself as a writein in every race.  However, I went to vote early last time, and the computers they used didn't allow for writein.  This time, I'll have to vote on the real day.</p>

<p>And even if I do get to make my vote, they will ignore it.</p>

<p>My goal is to get everyone to vote like this.  I want noone to win, and noone in office.</p>

<p>Yes, because that will make the country better off. ; )</p>

<p>Yes.  Anarcho-capitalists do believe that having empty or abolished political offices will make the country better off.</p>

My goal is to get everyone to learn how to spell "no one" correctly.  Somehow I think neither of us will see our goals achieved in our lifetimes...<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:(</p>

<p>I thought you'd caught me on a gross misunderstanding of the English language, for a minute.  But <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=noone&amp;x=0&amp;y=0" title="reference.com">noone is, in fact, a word</a reference.com>.  Unless this is yet another one of those British/American English things.  Where your browser stores biscuits instead of cookies, or whatever.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:P</p>

<p>I'm one of those people who goes nuts when I see "alot," so I can understand why you'd want this corrected, if it were wrong, but it's not.</p>

<p>On the other hand, <a href="http://wsu.edu/user/brians/errors/noone.html" title="wsu.edu">this page</a wsu.edu>, which I have always taken as an authority, disagrees with me.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:(</p>

<p>Actually, that dictionary page rather deceptively redirects me to "no one" instead of telling me that "noone" does not exist.</p>

<p>I concede.  Thank you for correcting me.</p>

The problem is, a majority voting for no one will not result in no one in office.<br><br>Even worse, if you convinced everybody to vote for no one, except for one person, that person would have the say of who would be elected.

Well, not strictly a nobody if the person votes for a somebody, but if the voting individal votes for themselves, and they are a nobody, a nobody gets in.<br><br>As Groucho Marx said to a club contemplating admitting him, I don't want to belong to any club that will accept me as a member.<br><br>Or, just vote and a politician gets in.

<p> <i>The problem is, a majority voting for no one will not result in no one in office.</i> </p>

<p>For an anarcho-capitalist, that's a goal, not a problem.</p>

<p> <i>Even worse, if you convinced everybody to vote for no one, except for one person, that person would have the say of who would be elected.</i> </p>

<p>In such an unlikely event, such a person would probably have a lot of trouble enacting his policies on the public.</p>

<p>I believe one of us is misunderstanding the other. This might be my fault, due to several neccessary double-negatives in my statement.</p>
<p>"Will not result in no one in office" was intended to mean "<b>will</b> result in someone in office".</p>
<p>Unless I misunderstand anarcho-capitalism, your goal is to have an <b>empty</b> office. My assertion was that each citizen voting for "no one" would not have this result, because such votes are usually simply discarded.</p>
<blockquote><div>In such an unlikely event, such a person would probably have a lot of trouble enacting his policies on the public.</div></blockquote>
<p>True, but this assumes that the more traditional mechanisms for challenging government power (voting and checks from other parts of government) would have already largely failed. I'm not sure the US government is designed to bootstrap itself out of existance quite so cleanly.</p>
