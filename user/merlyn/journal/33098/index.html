<p><p>I just finished recording the as-yet longest <a href="http://perlcast.com> "news" segment.  I'm sure Josh will have it up on the site within a day or two (update, at <URL:http://perlcast.com/2007/04/26/perl-news-2007-04-27">http://perlcast.com> "news" segment.  I'm sure Josh will have it up on the site within a day or two (update, at <URL:http://perlcast.com/2007/04/26/perl-news-2007-04-27</a>).
<p>Josh does a great job getting me a list of things to read.  The fun part is that I can do it as time permits, which usually means "late". :)  This time, I happened to be finishing up a 11-day stay in Rio De Janeiro, Brazil, so I pulled out the laptop and the plantronics folding headset, and got to it.
<p>Before my Macbook Pro, I had to record the audio pieces using Quicktime Player, then bring them in to Garageband to edit.  Now I can record directly in Garageband (without getting the dreaded "we ran out of CPU power"), saving me some time.  <p>Once I get the raw audio recorded, I go back and drop in the "stingers" between the segments.  One listener wrote in and said they sounded "kitchsy", to which I responded that this means I succeeded, because that was the sound I was going for.  In dropping in the stingers, I sometimes have to stretch or shrink the gap, but I usually hit the gap dead-on while I'm recording the news in one take, so the work is minimal.
<p>For this 10-minute news result, I think I spent about an hour on it, but it's an hour I'm happy to spend if it helps the Perl community keep more in touch.</p>

<h2>I Like It</h2>

I like it, it works well.  Sometimes I learn stuff I had not read on useperl (usually not because it wasn't there, but because I just never read it<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-).<br><br>Ask Pudge is usually about 10 minutes in length, and I can do the whole thing in less than a half hour, which is nice.  Although I still haven't done many lately.<br>
