<p>I was invited to present my <a href="http://ourmedia.org/node/15118">Free Software - A look back, A look ahead</a> at FISL 2005, in Porto Alegre in Brazil.  While there, I got to present my talks on CGI::Prototype to the first YAPC-Brazil.
<p>
FISL (the brazillian equivalent of OSCON) had 5000(!) attendees.  Yes, you read that right.  5000.  Makes OSCON look puny.
<p>
Not only that, but the opening ceremonies included the mayor of the city, the governor of the "state", and a high-level representative of the president's office.  Again, makes OSCON look puny by comparison.  Brazil has their act together when it comes to open source.
<p>
And, they're having a technical conference in November 2005, which I'm now also presenting at.  Again, they expect 5000 or so <i>developers</i> to attend the 3-day event.  Wow.
<p>
The most relevant Perl news is that the Perl folks created the Brazillian equivalent of The Perl Foundation, called the <a href="http://perl.org.br/">SPB (Sociedade Perl do BrasilÃ¢â¬âPerl Society of Brazil)</a>.  SPB will accept tax-deductable donations to fund local Perl development grants.  I'm an honorary member of the board, to be transferred to a founding board member when I get my brazillian tax ID (more on that later).
<p>
I also heard that the FSFLA was created... the "FSF Latin America".  Yes, Brazil is stepping out.

<p>I've always wanted to move back to Europe.  Maybe I should learn Portuguese instead.</p>

Let's just say that I ordered Portuguese Level 1 and 2 from <a href="http://rosettastone.com/" title="rosettastone.com">Rosetta Stone</a rosettastone.com> on Saturday.  And yes, I think I'll be spending a lot more time in Brazil soon.  Maybe even calling it home eventually.
<p>
Unfortunately, <a href="http://stonehenge.com.br/" title="stonehenge.com.br">stonehenge.com.br</a stonehenge.com.br> sells clothing!  I'll have to invent some other domain name.</p>

<p>Hey, and you'll have no criminal record in Brazil!  Good luck with this.</p>

Tell me about the fruit and the juices.

<p>Did you enjoy it?</p>
