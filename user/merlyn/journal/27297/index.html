Even with the 'computer guy's stance', Larry looks better on a Dance floor than I do.  (ref d4:034-042)<p>



<h2>Can't see videos</h2>

<p>Those videos make my modem lights blink, but they never show. It just says "connecting." I had to end the task to get the light to stop blinking.

Can you process an<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.AVI file?  That's how my camera saved it.  Maybe I should convert it to a quicktime?

I was able to see them the next day. The dance video showed in Windows Media Player. The singing video had the same problem--the light kept blinking and I wasn't able to view what was downloaded so far--so I tried opening it in Quicktime and was able to see it as it loaded. The girl sounded better than you, but you could both use some lessons.

I'll let <a href="http://www.staceytappan.com/" title="staceytappan.com">Stacey</a staceytappan.com> know that her opera career is in jeopardy, according to you.  You obviously have a very trained musical ear.

<p>Stacy's voice was impressive, but the problem was that it was <i>too</i> operatic in a couple of parts. I don't know the musical term for it. The tone or something needed to be more casual or something. It's a huge file and I didn't save it, so I won't try loading it again.</p>

<p>I once pinpointed what I didn't like about some famous opera singer. I think Pavarotti. He wasn't expressive enough. I don't think that was Stacy's problem though.</p>
