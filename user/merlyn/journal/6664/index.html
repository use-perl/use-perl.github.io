<p>And it continues...
<p>
Another day of managing the booth, although the traffic was lighter.  I kept the activity level low during the day, because I knew I had a busy afternoon and evening coming up.
<p>
Tom Phoenix and I presented our "Teaching 'learning perl'" 45-minute talk, and it was well received by the 75-ish people attending.  We finished precisely on-time, having started late because of audio problems.  It was the first time I had used my 800 Mhz TiPB in a presentation, having gotten it only a few days sooner.
<p>
Tom and I rushed downstairs to the O'Reilly booksigning event.  I think my name went on about 30 books and about 50 bookplates.  Sometimes I wish I hadn't selected "{signature} Just Another Perl Hacker {current date}" as my signing format, but I am at least totally consistent.
<p>
And then I wandered off to Quinn's bar for our big Quake LAN party, co-sponsored by Stonehenge, Aaronson, and DynDNS.  We were given a $5000 allocation of alcohol, which wasn't being spent fast enough with just beer, so we opened it up to everything up through the $18 single-malt scotches.  At the end of the night, we actually ran a bit over.  Hooray.  About $1000 was raised for the Perl foundation,
and Stonehenge gave away (by purchasing for a donation) about 250 PerlMonger and JAPH T-shirts.  Robrt led an auction of some limited-edition autographed london.pm T-shirts and $titch dolls.  Very cool.  A good time was had by all.
<p>
I got some very terrible news when I returned to my hotel room, but I'll leave that for another Journal entry, if at all.</p>
