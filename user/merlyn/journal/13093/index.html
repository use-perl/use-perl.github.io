<p>I'm taking off on my <a href="http://www.geekcruises.com/">17th Geek Cruise</a> today.  This is a repeat of a previous trip (how could they not be, at this point?), but a new topic (yeay!).
<P>
I'll be heading out from Vancouver up the Alaska "inside passage", ending up in Seward, then taking a scenic train from there to Anchorage, where I'll spend the day with the folks of the <a href="http://anchorage.pm.org/">Anchorage Perl Mongers</a> before boarding a red-eye to get me back home just in time for <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/os2003/">OSCON</a>.  Wheee!
<p>
The topic is "digital photography", so now I'll learn to take better 5-megapixel images of clouds and food!</p>

<h3><a href="/user/hfb/">hfb</a> on 2003-06-27T16:20:40</h3>
<p>I wonder if they'll cover the topic of 'What to do when someone asks repeatedly to have pictures containing themselves removed from your on-line digital archive'. </p>

Still taking pot-shots at me from the rafters, eh?
<p>
I've complied with every specific request you've made.
</p><p>
Please to be stopping spreading FUD.
</p><p>
{Sigh}
</p><p>
And grow up.  This is silly of you.</p>

<p>pot shots? no. I have asked many times for you to remove my pictures from your archive and you have never complied with the request other than to refuse. I have sought legal counsel and even begged Larry to intervene to no avail. I'll stop nagging when you remove them.</p>

And the part of the story that you're not telling is that I've told you to give me the specific URLs, and I would readily remove those pictures.  You don't tell that part of the story because it makes me look like a reasonable person then, and you don't ever want to accept that I might be a reasonable person.
<p>
Please Elaine, this "jilted ex-lover" game that you play is not becoming of you.  Get some therapy or something.  I should have taken that manila envelope of your hair that you presented to me at the Perl Conference as a clue that you might not be totally on the level.  I was hoping that now that you're married to Jarkko and getting sex regularly that you'd calm down, but apparently you haven't.
</p><p>
Sigh.</p>

Whatever Randal, just remove the pictures. You aren't a reasonable person, you aren't even a nice person. Just remove pictures containing my face from your archive and stop being a blithering asshole.

<p>Gee, Merlyn.  I wonder if your fanboys know what kind<br>of asshole you are in private.  Since we are getting<br>personal, let's get personal.</p> <br> <br> <p>I am familiar with the exchange you<br>and Elaine have had about the photos she wants removed,<br>and you are just outright fucking genuine purebred asshole<br>about it.  If you claim that you cannot remove the photos<br>that have Elaine in them without being told the exact<br>URLs, you are simply full of shit.  Hint: you have a Google<br>search button in your photos page.  I wonder who put<br>that link in there-- obviously not you since you obviously<br>don't know how to use it.</p> <br> <br> <p>Your comments about our sex life are just so outrageously impolite that I wish as many people as possible read them to see what kind of dirtbag you are.<br> </p> <br>

Not every picture with Elaine in it has a title or comment including her name.  Therefore, if she's concerned about her image, she has direct recourse to request specific images (including those not so annotated) and I'll comply.
<p>
This was the offer I made initially, and the offer I continue to make today.
</p><p>
Yes, I was over-the-top bringing in your private life.  I apologize for that.  But in return, a reasonable person would also apologize for the continued abuse that I suffer from Elaine.  That's not happened yet, and that's the part I'm still confused about.  Enough is enough. Move on <i>please</i>!</p>

&gt; Not every picture with Elaine in it has a title or comment including her name.<br> <br>If this doesn't prove that you know perfectly well which pictures contain Elaine, but still refuse to remove them, I don't know what does.<br> <br>&gt; Move on please!<br> <br>Just remove the fucking pictures, will you?<br> <br>

It took me two seconds to find this, and I've never even looked at Randal's site.

Am I expressing an opinion in this thread? No. Just pointing something out.</p>

As someone pointed out on IRC earlier, it might well be difficult for Randal to remove them all without knowing the exact URLs, but just removing the ones that can be identified easily would at least show willing.

<p>Well, so did my Father-in-Law a few years ago since he went looking on-line for a picture of me for the family photo album as he's an avid geneology buff. I don't have the heart to ask him to remove the photo and use something else as I don't want to seem vain but it bothers me. Perhaps it comforts Randal to think that I'm a 'jilted lover' instead of thinking that his actions are motivated by anything but self-interest but my request was prompted by my father-in-law finding and using this picture. I will continue to request he remove them and maybe at some point I'll have a legal leg to stand on to force him to remove them if he continues to refuse to do so.</p>

<p>I'd love to see someone else request the same just to see how he would respond.</p>
