<p>I just got my promotional comp copy of <a href="http://www.stonehenge.com/cgi/amazon?isbn=059600768X">Wil Wheaton's Just A Geek</a> direct from O'Reilly.  I had been told that my name was mentioned in the book.  That was an understatement.
<p>
In the first narrative of the book (abridged from a shorter version I've already read on <a href="http://www.wilwheaton.net">WWDN</a>), I see as the first paragraph:
<blockquote>
In July of 2003, I was invited to Portland, Oregon, by my friend and fellow O'Reilly Author, Randal Schwartz, to attend the release party for his newest book, <i>Learning Perl Objects, References &amp; Modules</i>. [footnote: This book is also called "The Alpaca", which is the animal on its cover.  Randal also co-wrote "The Llama" (<i>Learning Perl</i>).  I guess this book will be called "The Geek".] While I was there, I also attended O'Reilly's Open Source Convention and did a signing of my own, at Powell's Technical Books in downtown Portland.
</blockquote>
And the story ends with:
<blockquote>
I packed up my bag, and said good bye to Randal. He pointed at the little laminated "Meet Wil Wheaton, author of <i>Dancing Barefoot</i>" sign.
<p>
"You should take that, Wil.  It's from your first signing. You're going to want that someday," he said.
<p>
I picked it up off the table, and when I held it in my hands, I knew that he was right.  I didn't ever want to forget this very significant moment in my life.  Signing my first book, in a book store, and selling it out... it's better than the first time I got to sit at the helm of the <i>Enterprise</i>...
<p>
... because it was <i>real</i>.
</blockquote>
<p>
I'm honored to be mentioned in this book, and especially as a friend of Wil.  Thank you, Wil.</p>
