<p>I'm in Hawaii a few days early, before the start of the next <a href="http://www.geekcruises.com">Geek Cruise</a> (a combination Perl, Mac, and StarTrek cruise).
<p>
My host is my longtime friend Loredana (who had a part in the Perl community already by being the author of the bio I used for the first Camel).  She insisted that I try "surfing" because the easiest waves were down at Waikiki beach, and if I was going to learn anywhere, there'd be the place.
<p>
What she didn't realize is just how afraid I am of the water, having never learned to properly swim.  So, I do the shore instruction, and then start paddling out into the water.  Ugh, salt water in my eyes within about a minute, as soon as the first wave crested over the board.  This was the first time salt water had ever been in my eyes, and it stung.
<p>
But then, as I got a bit further out ("paddle! paddle!", the instructor screams), I started taking on (swallowing) water as the waves splashed over the board.  Ugh, one wave nearly knocks me off, and I start panicking, wondering how I'm supposed to dogpaddle with water of varying heights and slopes, and with a board leashed to the foot that needs to go down into the water.  Another splash hits my face, nearly knocks me off the board again, and that's it for me.  I get turned around, ride a tiny wave back toward shore, and call it done.
<p>
Surfing the web: good.  Surfing in real life: scary as hell.
<p>
But at least I tried.  I guess I'll need to prepare better by being in salt water and bumpy water before I go out again.  I'm not confident enough in my ability to avoid drowning to trust any additional complications (like handling a board or bigger waves).
<p>
As I left the beach, I saw MJD and his wife, amazingly coincidentally, although MJD is down here for the same reason.  He talked about a sunblock with "SPF 57".  I insisted that it probably was "Heinz 57 Steak Sauce" but relabeled.</p>
