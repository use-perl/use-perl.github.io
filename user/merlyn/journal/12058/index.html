<p>After having only a half a revenue week from July of last year to February of this year, and a lot of cancelled classes because of lack of attendance, I'm happy to report that in a six week span, I'm personally producing an off-the-shelf Llama class, a week of custom classes, and two weeks of system administration consulting, all three of our major products.
<p>
It feels good to have my direct production be what it was like three years ago.  It also feels good that some of the other training clients are starting to book classes again, some of the open enrollment classes are starting to fill again, and that I'm also getting consulting requests and scrambling to fill them the best I can.
<p>
And in the meanwhile, I've managed to refinance my home and the home I subsidize for my Mom, pulling out $80,000 which is enough to pay down most of the credit I rang up during the down cycle.  So as long as I get 3-4 classes per month for me and the

Things are still on the "down-low" for me here, but business has been picking up lately too, although not entirely in the field I'd prefer.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br> <br>I do have two web-projects in the works, and potentially a summer job (granting things work out in the interviews, and that they like my resume enough to grant me one) working for a local provider that should get me some good experience as well. Keeping my fingers crossed here too.<br> <br>So when is your "Interesting Perl tricks" book coming out? Oh, you don't have one? Well, get cracking on one! I'd love to see it!<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:D<br> <br>* Webdragon runs...<br> <br>Say, you know something I just noticed? You're like the ONLY reason I still read Linux Magazine. I've recently found a local newsstand that picks up LinuxFormat which I've found a whole lot more interesting. Linux Magazine is starting to seem mostly like dry white toast to me.<br> <br>(which is odd, considering I come from a 15-year Macingosh<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-) background, and only got into Linux in Jan of last year... isn't ALL of this supposed to be new and interesting to me, still? Am I jaded already? )<br> <br>Still, it's just gravy that LinuxFormat also comes with a CD of nifty new things. 90% of them I glance at and ignore anyway but it's nice to not have to download any of it should I decide I want it. The magazine itself still interests me more.<br> <br>I don't suppose we could talk you into writing for LinuxFormat too ?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)<br> <br>Okayokayokay, yeah TheDamian got in a nice Perl 6 article for the April issue. Which was cool cuz I hadn't expected it. (missed an issue) Still...<br> <br>Anyway enough rambling. Good luck, hope it continues for you !
