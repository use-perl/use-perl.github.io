<h2>Troll?</h2>

<p>One of the signs of trolling that I've learned to look for (when I have to ban someone from my journal or a community I moderate) is someone who only posts replies to other people and doesn't post anything in their own journal.  You're looking awfully suspicious on that account.</p>

<p>And how do we know you're not some imposter who just hacked Randal's account here?  Say something only Randal would know!<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

Personally, I find this post compelling (I'm one of the aforementioned folk from LJ).  Yes, it's possible that someone hacked the account, but I don't think it likely.  Unless I see compelling evidence to the contrary, I think that I'm going to believe that "livemerlyn" on LJ and Randal Schwartz, star of stage, screen, and<blockquote><div> <tt>for $ANIMAL ("llama","camel","alpaca","gecko \(the animal, not the rendering engine\)")<br>{<br>&nbsp; print "$ANIMAL ";<br>}</tt> </div></blockquote>books are one in (and?) the same.

And.  One and the same.

As long as you treat that heuristic as suggestive, rather than as conclusive, it has some merit I suppose.  It actually discriminates reactive from proactive; you use that to suggest anti-active and there is probably some amount of statistical correlation, but I don't think it is especially huge.
