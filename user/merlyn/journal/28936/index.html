So, I'm working for $client, and I needed to send a presentation to my $boss so that he can push it up on the webinar system for a brownbag I'm presenting today at lunchtime.  He wanted both the powerpoint (ugh) slides (converted from nice nifty Keynote), and a backup PDF in case things broke.
<p>
When I printed the PDF from powerpoint, it came out as a whopping 22 Megabytes.  Ouch.  However, I didn't notice this, and simply attached the message in Thunderbird (another ugh, but that's another story), and pressed "send".   My message was rejected during the send (and also took a while), so I found a way to reprint the PDF from the original Keynote, and it came out to 252K, so I happily sent that along instead.
<p>
But now for the "WTF" moment. I get a message about 20 seconds later from "the mail administrator" (not a human), advising me that "the attached message is too large to deliver".  Yes.  Follow the logic.  The attached message was too large to deliver, so it <i>delivered</i> it to me in its entirety.
<p>
Oh, joy.
<p>
If only I had faked the "from" on the original message, the bounce would have been "delivered" to the desired recipient instead!</p>

I would have tried to change the "from" just to see if it did work that way. (I have no reason to assume it wouldn't but hey why not.)
