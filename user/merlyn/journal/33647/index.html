<p>I had about 30 people in my 2-day "master class", where I presented "Perl Second Best Practices" (my take on PBP) and "Persistent Perl Data" (a survey of simple persistence, DBI, Class::DBI, and Rose::DB::Object).
<P>I'm beat, heading home, but no rest for the weary, as I'll be on the road for six of the next seven weeks.</p>

Oh, please put that talk up. I would dearly love to see it.

<p>I second that.  But it sounds like it was a full class, so I'd understand if you're wanting to retain it so as to keep its value up and turn it into profit or something.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

Yeah, I'm cool with making all the short talks Creative Commons, but the long talks have to be our bread and butter.  I put a week or so of time into it (on spec), so now I have to sell it a half-dozen times before I can get that money back to even break even.
<p>
I <i>am</i> thinking of doing one or two upcoming articles on "Where I respectfully disagree with Professor Conway", which would be the meat of my unique contribution to the material that is obviously based on PBP.  So, watch <a href="http://www.stonehenge.com/merlyn/columns.html" title="stonehenge.com">my columns</a stonehenge.com> for some updates.</p>

That is cool. I did not realize you did that or I would not have asked. I guess I will have to hope one of your talks takes you to the DC area.  : )
