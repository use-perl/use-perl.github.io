<div class="span8">
<p>So, having been fed up with spam and virus mail again, pushing my monthly bandwidth up and over my 30GB/month purchased limit (which is supposed to be for web, not email!), I reenabled my dynamic rolling block.
<p>
I block mail at various levels.  Postfix lets me block mail during the SMTP handshake for hosts that don't have an A or MX record, and for delivery to addresses that are known spamtraps within the @stonehenge.com mail domain.  Then, the mail goes to amavis, which uses SpamAssassin to block mail that looks very spammy (I have this set fairly high to avoid false positives).  Then, $user@stonehenge.com mail gets delivered to my procmailrc for sorting, and I do further checks for simple mydoom and sobig patterns, and finally I call clamscan looking for known virus payloads.  Altogether, I've got about 10 log files being written in two different formats (/var/log/maillog vs rfc822 headers).
<p>
But, POE to the rescue.  I set up tail watchers on all the various log files, extract the offending IPs of the hop prior to my box, and then issue simple <tt>pfctl</tt> commands to add and delete those from a block list in my OpenBSD pf firewall.  The address goes in, and 2 hours later, comes back out.
<p>
At the moment, I have nearly 2000 addresses in my list that have assaulted me within the last two hours, and get about 300 attempts a minute to reconnect.  Using <tt>tcpdump</tt> with openbsd's passive fingerprinting, I can see that most of the block reattempts are repeated hits from windows boxes on cable or DSL, very likely worm-infected machines that would be much better recycled than online.
<p>
The result is that my loadaverage has now returned to sensible values, and my total bandwidth due to mail is back down to a reasonable 5GB/month average.  Yeay!</p>

<h2>Bandwidth...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Purdy/">Purdy</a> on 2004-04-26T17:22:38</h3>
If your focus in on saving the bandwidth (man, that's a lotta e-mail!), then you need to do as much upfront testing as possible (before the client gets to the "data" section of their e-mail).  You may also not want to REJECT, which would double the bandwidth with bouncebacks (not sure if the original message is bounced back, too).<br> <br>I love Postfix -- they have some <a href="http://www.porcupine.org/postfix/doc/uce.html" title="porcupine.org">really great UCE</a porcupine.org> measures.  I had some problems with "A or MX record" thing (reject_unknown_client?) -- that would block things like stories that were e-mailed to our users off of a Web site (you know -- that "E-mail this Story" link), e-newsletters or from my friend's <a href="http://tennisladder.org/" title="tennisladder.org">Tennis Ladder</a tennisladder.org> site, who's hostname wasn't configured properly.  When you see those type of examples, you could hand-add them to<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/etc/hosts and then remember to cp that file into Postfix's chroot jail (/var/spool/postfix in my case).  I ended up just taking it out all together, it was so annoying.  But you prolly don't have the number or type of users I have to support.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br> <br>Peace,<br> <br>Jason

For Postfix, I reject during the SMTP handshake, not bouncing it with checks later.  Amavis doesn't bounce it either... we just swallow the spam.  And I don't bounce anything from my procmail tests or clamscan tests.  The only bounces I generate are $baduser@stonehenge.com (provided they aren't a spammed-to-death address).

If you want an rbl feed of this list, or a URL to a private text file containing the IPs (both updated once a minute), please let me know (merlyn@stonehenge.com).
<p>
The caveat is that there might be false positives.  It's useful as an outright smtp block, or at a place where you can return "try again later" to an incoming SMTP connection, but not at a point where you've already accepted the mail.  You want a legit mailer to retry, but the bad guys mailers will not.</p>
