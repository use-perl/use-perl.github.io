<p>I stumbled across <a href="http://learning-perl.the-xp.com/">a blog</a> described as:
<blockquote><i>
The ups and downs of a PHP/MySQL twinkler trying to climb the evolutionary ladder to become a fully fledged Perl hacker. 
N.B. This is most definately NOT a Perl Tutorial.
</i></blockquote>
<p>
I find it fascinating that someone would put their learning process on the net, so of course, I'm reading each new installment with keen interest, and commenting where appropriate.</p>

<h2>Theres another one right here</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/htoug/">htoug</a> on 2004-02-25T09:48:06</h3>
in use.perl.org: <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/zatoichi/journal/" title="perl.org">zatoichi's journal</a perl.org>.<br>Not quite as much ramling (yet), and only on chapter 3, but looking promising.



<h2>Learning Perl on the net</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/bluethundr/">bluethundr</a> on 2004-05-23T02:51:15</h3>
<em>I find it fascinating that someone would put their learning process on the net, so of course, I'm reading each new installment with keen interest, and commenting where appropriate.</em> <br> <br>I'm curious why someone would <em>not</em> wish to put their learning process on the net? If you're like Khalil Gibrain one realizes that "perplexity is the beginning of wisdom". Okay, maybe that's a little hokey. In that case I would ask, why would you invovle your personal ego in the ramblings of a complete stranger? Why would you care? You put it out there, see what the more experienced folk have to say, and do what you should do with EVERYTHING you read on the net: take it with a grain of salt. relax. it's not <em>you</em> they're criticizing! It's what you said. And nearly anyone can be st00pid. Even extremely bright people, from time to time. You don't, for instance, know whether I made a certain post under the glow of a psychotropic bliss one gets by ordering a pizza with....extra toppings. Or just missed a nights sleep and felt extremely grumpy. (Like now with me, FI).<br> <br>Or maybe that's just the age we live in: where people actually identify strongly with their 'net personna.<br> <br>I say...who cares? Just put your learning curve out there! Let your freak flag fly, baby! And take the good advice along with the bad.



<h2>&quot;How I Did It&quot; Blogs</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/davebaker/">davebaker</a> on 2004-06-25T16:02:31</h3>
I think you're onto something, merlyn<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... it would be super if there was a way for the net to enable people to efficiently capture online their experience at solving a particular problem.  Sorta the electronic equivalent of being able to get a bird's-eye view of where people are creating paths in the grass, so the engineers know where to build the sidewalks.<br> <br>Blogs seem like such a way, but I wonder if there is room for improvement.  One can find them by doing keyword searches on the search engines, but keywords seem like a clumsy way to try to focus on the particular problem/question being solved.
