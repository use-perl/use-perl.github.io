<p>I could swear I posted a comment here that mentioned that I had had 24 years of paid computer industry experience, in response to someone else's journal noting an interview with someone <i>else</i> having more experience.  And then there was a followup that said something like "isn't it crazy when someone has more experience than years you've been alive?"
<p>
Did I just imagine all that?
<p>
Or is there a way to delete entire threads from the journal?
<p>
Or is the indexing here messed up?
<p>
Did anyone else read that? Can anyone else find it for me?  I've tried looking historically through my comments, and a few well-chosen keywords in searches.  Weird.</p>

It appears that that entry was deleted.  If someone chooses to delete an entry, all associated comments are trashed.
<p>
I can't remember who posted the original entry now, but I just checked about 20 journals manually and couldn't find it.  The search engine is not very helpful.</p>

It was me, jdavidb reminded me that it was something that might bite me in the ass in the future<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

<p>I was also the one who made the smart-alek remark about someone having as many years of experience as I (and gav) have been alive.  You can smack me for that if we ever meet in person, merlyn, perhaps at a conference next year.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

The problem is that I thought it was a good funny remark, and wanted to reference it in the post someone recently made in having reached their 24th birthday.
<p>
Otherwise, I wouldn't have even looked for it!</p>
