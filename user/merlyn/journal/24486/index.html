<div class="span8">
<p>In <a href="/user/mr_bean/journal/24484">mr_bean's journal</a>, he writes:
<blockquote>
But if such is not the case, why not bring the YAS back into existence, and have it compete with the TPF in the form of a race to fund developers and reach milestones?
</blockquote>
I don't think he realizes that YAS <i>is</i> TPF.
<p>
I also wish he would have turned on comments, so I could have just commented in his journal instead.  Or at least provided some way to email him.
<p>
Why so much secrecy?  {sigh}</p>

I don't know whether you've been successfully trolled, or if this is a subtle attempt to boost donations, on the grounds that no news is bad news.
<p>The utter anonymity of "mr bean" is perplexing, but his YAPC::Taipai comments suggest that some folks might recognize his style. One does wonder if it's the same Mr.Bean immortalized in <a href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/comp.infosystems.www.authoring.cgi/msg/9bac77f8381c60de?hl=en" title="google.com">DejaNews</a google.com> from 1996, from nite.net.uk, probably not?</p>

Sorry, I forgot to turn comments on.<br> <br>I turned them on now, so you can comment at the<br>original post.<br>I should also say something about myself in the<br>header to my posts. Just let it be said here, I<br>am not the real Mr Bean, although the 1996 Yahoo<br>poster might be, meaning I am not that poster<br>(poseur?) either.

<p>Of course you aren't. Mr Bean is a fictional television character by <a href="http://www.rowanatkinson.org/mr_bean.htm" title="rowanatkinson.org">Rowan Atkinson</a rowanatkinson.org>.</p>

<h2>No comments</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/bart/">bart</a> on 2005-05-03T08:20:19</h3>
I wonder why "comments disabled" is the default. IMO you post to this journal to get feedback, or at least, get read.
<p> <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/TorgoX/journal/" title="perl.org">TorgoX</a perl.org> is another user here who systematically has user comments disabled &mdash; though I'd loved to have commented on some of his posts in the past.
</p> <p>I'd have loved to have had comments enabled by default, and you having to take action to disable them, instead.</p>

At least there's a setting in the preferences so that you can change the default.<br> <br>TorgoX used to enable comments all the time, but I think nowadays he disables them for political posts, and often forgets to reenable for nonpolitical ones.
