I had just seen <a href="http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0475276/"><i>United 93</i></a>, and after the movie, bumped in to <a href="http://us.imdb.com/name/nm0458662/">a friend of mine</a>, who is known more for her physical assets than her mental achievements. (Although she's not blonde, this week.)
<P>
I had stayed through the credits, and noticed a lot of "HIMSELF" and "HERSELF", which obviously added to the authenticity of this biopic feeling almost like a documentary.  So I commented to her "Hey, a lot of the people originally involved played themselves", because it had impressed me.
<p>
She replied, "The people on the airplane?"

{sigh}</p>

<h2>That reminds me.....</h2>

I remember a sun technician who was a practitioner of the "tall" tale.   One day he was on a repair when an administrative assistant asked him a question about printers and toners.<br><br>She asked why is it when you shake a toner, the next couple of pages will have some smudging?<br><br>He said:  Well if you look inside of a toner you will see these tiny rows that hold each letter.  Some letters are used more then others.  Take "e" for example.  When a row runs low that is why you get low toner warnings.   When you shake the toner all the letters get thrown around and some break like an "e" will become a "c."  The broken pieces are what create that smudge you see.<br><br>She asked is there anything we can do to make sure they are all used?   He told her she could purchase a letter refill kit.<br><br>She thought about it and said her boss probably wouldn't allow for the expenditure.<br><br>He then suggested that she use the toners from the graphics department since they tend to not use letters as much.<br><br>He left and the next day he got a call from his contact.   He told him she was separating toners into two piles.   Graphics and regular!<br><br>I asked him if she was a blond and he simply smiled and said she also had great assets.<br><br>
