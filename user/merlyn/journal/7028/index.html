<li>The men's urinals are nearly always a trough, even in the classiest places.  (The classiest places just have shinier troughs.)
This is odd for me, since in the US, the only place that would have a trough is a very old or very scuzzy place.  Nearly every other place has at least separate urinals for each participant, and almost always includes a tiny divider wall.
<li>I got to pet a Wombat yesterday!  TheDamian took me to a fauna park and I saw a huge number of native ozzie animals.  Cool.  Very cool.
<li>The service and food at Hungry Jack's is nothing like the service and food quality at a BK at home, in the negative direction.
<li>They don't have drive-through fast-food places here!

<h2>Drive through</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/koschei/">koschei</a> on 2002-08-11T03:05:10</h3>
As in drive through Maccas, BK, HJ, KFC? Sure we do. Even Melbourne should have them, somewhere. I've only seen drive through liquor places in Tasmania though. Mainlanders seem to go: eh? Drive through liquor!!?<br> <br>Never seen those partitions in toilets though.<br> <br>



<h2>You want to visit france then...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/TeeJay/">TeeJay</a> on 2002-08-12T08:46:42</h3>
France has a great repuation for its rural public toilets... don't even expect doors in cubicles in some village toilets.<br> <br>No drive thru's and not even Hooters bars. So you'd be forced to eat the local cuisine unless you were in a big city like paris which has plenty of MacD's and similar sewage works.



<h2>McDrive</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jdavidb/">jdavidb</a> on 2002-08-12T13:25:10</h3>
<p>In Ukraine, the McDonald's drive thru was a relatively new innovation known as "McDrive."  I can easily see new fast food joints in future years struggling to overcome the brand name and get their customers refer to their drive thru's as something other than McDrive.</p>
