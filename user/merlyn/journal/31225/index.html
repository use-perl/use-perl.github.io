<p>Not sure why it took this long, but <a href="http://www.digitalcitizen.info/2006/10/05/observations-on-the-ramifications-of-electronic-communication-media/">someone has finally posted audio</a> from my "Communication is free" talk at FISL7.0 in Brazil a few months ago.</p>

<h2>Could it be?</h2>

When the negotiation with iTunes finally broke down when they refused to sell it for more than 99 cents a download, you finally allowed it it be posted for free download?

If that was supposed to be funny, I missed it.

Yeah, it was supposed to be, but it was pretty stupid.



<h2>Irony Re:Could it be? [re Communications is free]</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/n1vux/">n1vux</a> on 2006-10-27T18:23:25</h3>
The danger of dry irony is that it isn't often obvious to others.  Often have I been hoist on that petard.<br><br>Given the title of the talk (and the O.P.), the comment suggesting it was posted free only because it didn't work on pay-per-view would have been funny, _if_ viewed with irony-sensitive glasses. ALas, most people don't own a pair (yet I'm cursed with viewing the whole world through a pair continually). (The headlines I read are much funnier than what the paper printed. It's not entirely a bad thing, but I have to be careful not to laugh at inappropriate times.)<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-) isn't just a clue to the clueless, it's also a sign that YES I THINK I'M FUNNY, IF YOU DIDN'T GET IT PLEASE RE-READ BEFORE FLAMING. It's context. Spoken, we'd likely have<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/heard/ a facetious lilt, which is missing in text.<br>(Dry, flat delivery in person can be toxic too, unless you cheat and cock a brow.)<br><br>Quoting the original &amp; talk subject "Communications is free" might have helped make the ironic connection more obvious, too. [I've restored it on this comment's subject:<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.]<br><br>I will have to download and listen later, thanks for the URL.<br><br>
