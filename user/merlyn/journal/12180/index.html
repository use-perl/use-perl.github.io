<p>I'm consulting for a large eastern-US university this week.  <a href="http://www.stonehenge.com/perltraining/">We've</a> been working with them for a year to get them off mod_cgi and into mod_perl.  The server is the core server that handles registrations, tuition payment, and grades, and is all done with CGI, and throwing more and more hardware at the problem.
<p>
The biggest problem is the saturday of registration each quarter.  It nearly melted down last quarter, but they think they can use the same hardware and move things to mod_perl for this quarter.
<p>As a test, they took a mod_perl server, and just with <tt>Apache::PerlRun</tt> (which recompiles the code on each hit, but doesn't fork), they were able to easily improve on a custom C program in CGI mode, talking to a database and executing a simple query.  A short Perl program replaced the much-more-clumsy C program.
<p>They're sold!  Just wait until they discover <tt>Apache::Registry</tt> and points beyond.
<p>Just today, I got a complicated version of their Apache server to compile in DSO mode (except for a weird mod_auth_dce module), and demonstrate a caching reverse-proxy server using their existing CGI base, so they have a migration path for mod_perl.  Joy.</p>

<h2>Advocacy?</h2>

Hey, it might be worth asking them if they are willing to write up a description of what changed and how it's working now, as an advocacy piece.<br> <br>Purely from a technical standpoint I'd like to know more details about this, 'cuz I'm still a little fuzzy on mod_perl. Something I really need to just grab a tuit and sit down with for a while, methinks.
