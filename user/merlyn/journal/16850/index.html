<p>What <i>two</i> and <i>only</i> two places in the US can you find a sequence of roughly adjacent streets named:

Bonus question: why do I know this list from memory?</p>

<h2>hmm</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/spur/">spur</a> on 2004-01-16T09:57:03</h3>
Because you live in one of these places ?<p>
Also, all the names start with the running sequence A,B,C...K , which makes it easier to remember.</p>



<h2>funny street names</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/rjbs/">rjbs</a> on 2004-01-16T13:24:05</h3>
Well, at least one is Portland, I suppose?  I seem to remember something cute like that going on with street names.<br> <br>Also, while walking around OSCON, someone laughed at my pronunciation of some important street name which, apparently, everyone who isn't from Portland mispronounced.  What is it?  (I really don't remember.)<br> <br>I was also mocked for mentioning the WILL-a-met river.

No, the Alphabetical sequence in Portland begins with Burnside (Couch, Davis, Everett, Flanders [doh!], Glisan, Hoyt, Irving, Johnson, Kearney, Lovejoy, Marshall, Northrup, Overton, Pettygrove, Quimby, Raleigh, Savier, Thurman, Upshur, Vaughn, Wilson).  Good guess though.
<p>
As for funny pronounciations, perhaps it was "couch", which is pronounced "Cooooch", apparently to honor the person it was named after.  Apparently, these names come from local historical figures.</p>

Couch!  Good spotting.  (Also, Quimby is another good Simpsons reference street.)

When I was living in Durango, Colorado, I lived on Florida Road, which is prounounced "Fluh-REED-uh".
<p>
Here in Chicago, there's also a Goethe street, pronounced "GO-thee" (soft th, not hard).</p>

The difference, being, of course, that "Flor-EE-da" is how the name "ought" to be pronounced, whereas "GO-thee" is Just Totally Wrong.  But sometimes I think maybe it's better to be entirely wrong than just a little wrong. Hearing it pronounced "Gerta" really rubs me the wrong way.

Boston.
<p>As to why you remember them I have no idea. A friend of mine was an au-pair there years ago, and she found it amusing that a many of the streets were named after British towns and cities<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<h3><a href="/user/merlyn/">merlyn</a> on 2004-01-16T16:05:53</h3>
Yes, Back Bay in Boston is one of them.  But where's the <i>other</i> one?

Looks like it's Gladstone, Oregon, but I cheated and used Google.<br/><br/>Living in Boston, they're committed to my memory because that makes it easier to stumble home drunk.

<h2>Re:It's...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/merlyn/">merlyn</a> on 2004-01-16T18:06:27</h3>
Yes!  It's Gladstone!  I grew up there for the first 13 years of my life.
<p>
The first time I set foot in Boston's back bay (for a web conference back in 98, I think it was), I was at a hotel on Dartmouth street, and when I started exploring, my jaw dropped.
</p><p>
"I know these street names!"
</p><p>
So I set up this quiz to record this unusual fact.
</p><p>
Thanks for cheating. {grin}  But I doubt it would have come out any other way.</p>

Could it be that travelling down it you pass these roads in alphabetical order?<br> <br>

Well, that's an au pair for ya.  Anybody with half a brain wouldn't find it amusing.  Hell, Boston itself was named after a British town.  It is "New England", after all.  Every geographic feature there is named after a place in England, or else it has an Indian name.  (To overgeneralize a little...)<br> <br>O.k., just for fun, here are the names of the 50 states, categorized by the origin of the name.<br> <br>Indian names (mostly names of tribes in the area):<br>Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Connecticut, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi,<br>Missouri, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Wisconsin, Wyoming<br> <br>Named after English persons:<br>Delaware, Georgia, Louisiana, Maryland, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia<br> <br>Named for places in England:<br>New Hampshire<br>New Jersey<br>New York<br> <br>Neo-classical:<br>California<br>Indiana<br> <br>Spanish:<br>Arizona<br>Colorado<br>Florida<br>Montana<br>Nevada<br> <br>French:<br>Maine<br>Vermont<br> <br>Seems like the Spanish and French preferred to assign names which were descriptive of the terrain/climate. In this regard, California ought to be lumped in with the Spanish names. (and maybe  Indiana could be lumped with the Indian names, even though it isn't one...)<br>

Ooh, I made one mistake when I typed this up.  (I had thought of it earlier, but forgot.) Namely:<br> <br>Louisiana is named for a French person, not an English person.<br>
