<p>In Jan 2000, Gerald Newton (the Alaska Electrician of some ill repute) <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.perl.misc/msg/2d00c4b273299db2?dmode=source&hl=en">writes</a>:
<blockquote><i>
After the recent attack and the ridicule received at this newsgroup, I think the electrical industry is well advised to stay away from perl and to use more secure packages even if they are much more expensive. Perl is not a viable practical secure solution.
</i></blockquote>
<p>
Flash forward to recently, on <a href="http://electrician-com.blogspot.com/2005/11/new-features-at-electriciancom-and.html">his new blogspot blog</a>, we see:
<blockquote><i>
This search utility searches a total of 36 files and uses two new PERL scripts. I started writing these programs in September, 2005 and finished on November 2, 2005.There still may be some minor bugs, but it seems to work fine so far.

Well, he can't spell Perl right (yet), but apparently he's all gung-ho about Perl again.

<h2>Stalker?</h2>

What, having you been stalking this guy for 5 years or something because he said something unkind about Perl?  How did you even come across this or remember the original post?
<p>
Wow.</p>

No, I remembered "the alaskan electrician" keyed only by that in my brain, because of the total craziness around it when he accused the members of the newsgroup of hacking his ill-protected MattScriptArchive message board.
<p>
Then, a few days ago, my <a href="feedster.com" title="perl.org">feedster.com</a perl.org> search for "Learning Perl" popped up the referenced article, and the URL of "electrician.com" led me to wonder "is this the <i>alaskan electrician</i>?".  A few keystrokes with dejagoogle later, and I had my confirmation.
</p><p>
Honestly, I generally don't recognize patterns like this.  Just consider it an accidental find.</p>

It was (for good or bad--mostly bad) a memorable thread.  <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.perl.misc/msg/0d94bbeabbf280b6" title="google.com">One of the posts</a google.com> in that thread even made <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/alt.humor.best-of-usenet/msg/84fe76f5546e60cf" title="google.com">best of usenet.</a google.com>

Just do a google search for the guy's name - he's been nominated for a usenet kook at least once, and seems to be a regular troll.  I'd take his newfound interest in perl as a negative.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)



<h2>Wow</h2>

Wow, I forgot all about that guy.  Now I'll have to go through Google News and re-read all that.<br><br>I suppose perlgurl (or whatever the other incarnations where) is still trolling around too?  And singing how Perl 4 is better?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br><br>

<p>What's the betting the perlgurl will see the light of Perl 5 around the time Perl 6 comes out?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>
