<p>My <a href="http://www.stonehenge.com/merlyn/Pictures/Trips/2003/03-07-TPC7/">OSCON 2003 Picture Gallery</a> is now up.  Notable pictures include Wil Wheaton's first encounter with Tim O'Reilly.</p>

After seeing the "Crystal and Amy" pic, I was wondering - are they employees of yours?  If so, where do I apply?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-P

Crystal works at a bar that I've been frequenting for about four years: she's been there since I started going there.  Amy worked there for about six months, but has gone on to do housecleaning (and I'm a client of hers).
<p>
I tried to invite every woman I knew in Portland as my "special guest" to try to balance out the dance floor, and partially succeeded.  Next year will be better, because now I know how often I have to remind women about free drinks at a bar. {grin}
</p><p>
Melissa (the other booth girl) also worked at a bar that I frequented, and I've known her for about two years.  They were both great at the booth, and I would use them again in a heartbeat.  Neither of them were confirmed more than a few days before the event, so they really stepped up to the task rather quickly.</p>
