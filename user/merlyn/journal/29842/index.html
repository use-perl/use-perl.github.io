In my work for $client, last week I spent a few hours making sure that Devel::Cover was mostly happy with my code, running through enough branches so that when I had to "go live" with minor revisions, I could push the change with a fair degree of confidence.
<p>
This week, I concluded that a fundamental data structure (an in-memory hash-of-hashes) that controlled the entire operation and was passed from one part to the next of this 2000-line set of modules, should be changed to be permanent.
<p>
So I pulled out Rose::DB, designed a simple main-row-plus-1-to-n-children database schema, and started refactoring.  Of course, after I got rid of the initial data structure, every test failed.  I would take each test, run it, and watch it fail, and then I would keep hacking the code and fixing it again until the test passed.  Then I'd move on to the next one.
<p>
Six hours later, my complex application was now completely running with Rose::DB-based persistence instead of an in-memory data structure.  And I was very happy that the client had insisted on complete tests before I started, because I was now confident to push this <i>new</i> version into production.
<p>
Tests. Not just for breakfast, any more.</p>
