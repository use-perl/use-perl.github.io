<h1>Rant about being invited to Thai or Indian... always!</h1>

<div class="span8">
<p>I'm being hosted by some New Friends for Yet Another Conference in Yet Another Odd City.  They offered to take me to dinner, and offered me... Thai.
<p>
Here's my response:
<blockquote><i>
&lt;rant type="tongue-in-cheek"&gt;
<p>
   Why always Thai?  Everyone that takes me out to dinner
   offers me either Thai or Indian, presuming that those are "exotic" and
   I'd never get to go them normally. But I always get offered one or
   the other when I'm visiting new friends in a strange town.
   Perhaps because they're looking for an excuse to not go to Wendy's
   or Sizzler or someplace else.
   <p>
   Nobody ever says "let's go to Black Angus" or something like that.
   <p>But at least you asked.  Often, I just get
   ambushed, winding up at a Thai or Indian place,
   with people all saying how cool and unique it is.  Except for me.  I'd been to three Thai places in the past two weeks, all in different cities.  It's like I'm on a Thai restaurant review tour, or something.
   <p>
   It's always either Thai, or Indian.
   <p>
&lt;/rant&gt;

There's food worth eating that <i>isn't</i> Thai or Indian? <p>My eating out restaraunt ratio sounds about the same as yours, but I couldn't be happier with it. </p><p>Maybe you should just stop going out to dinner with people like me (that is to say, I dunno, vegetarians maybe<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>



<h2>There's other good stuff</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/autarch/">autarch</a> on 2003-05-07T19:47:46</h3>
I'm vegan and I regularly eat Thai, Indian, but even more often Vietnamese and Chinese, as well as Nepalese, Kurdish, Lebanese, Malaysian, and even sometimes vegan versions of American food (like a Louisiana Po' Boy with soy cheese and vegan sausage, yum).



<h2>because :</h2>

Thai is tasty food, man. <i>Oh</i>, the things they do with mint. If I had your ratio of Thai-food-to-meals, I'd be a happy, happy person. As it is, I eat a lot of chinese out of culinary reflex. Chinese is good food. Thai is good food. It's almost like you're suggesting that you'd get tired of thai cuisine, and that's, like, crazy talk.

Yes, Thai food is good, as is Indian.  In my experience, that's the reason people go to those restaurants, not because  they're unique or exotic (or cool, for that matter).  But maybe Randal's been hanging out in the boonies a lot lately, where such places may be rare.<br> <br>As I remember, we did take Randal to a Thai restaurant when he came to DC.  But I certainly didn't hear anyone claiming it was exotic.<br> <br>And of course the reason people don't take him to Black Angus is that half the crowd wouldn't find much edible there.  Steak isn't so popular anymore, even among nonvegetarians.

<p>&quot;American cuisine&quot; <b>IS</b> an oxymoron after all... </p>

maybe so maybe so<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...  here in bmore there's plenty of
dingy dives where the waitresses are old and surly and tend
to call everyone 'hon' but the crab cakes are excellent It's
not haute cusine but on a warm night during a month that
doesn't end in 'r' you can't beat it. Add a good kaiser roll,
crisp lettuce, a nice red 'mato, some steak fries and a cold
draft<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... damn, I'm getting hungry just thinking about it and I've all ready had lunch.

<h2>American Food</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/pudge/">pudge</a> on 2003-05-13T20:44:24</h3>
I have never eaten Thai or Chinese or Japanese or Korean and or Indian and I have no plans to.  My nose tells me to stay away.  I love burgers and fries and steaks and mashed potatoes and corn on the cob and pork chops<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... I eat salami sandwiches for breakfast and buffalo-and-macaroni for lunch and top it off with ham-and-beans for dinner.  And I am enormously happy with it.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)
