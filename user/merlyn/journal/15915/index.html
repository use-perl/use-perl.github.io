<p>OK, maybe this'll go down as a "no big deal" to most people, but I just had an AIM conversation with <tt>brian d foy</tt> in Iraq.  That was cool.  Very cool.
<p>
I also realized how much I miss having him around, and how worried I get when I hear about casualties there.</p>

<p>brian's efforts have been sorely missed, and it's been wonderful to see him "come back to life" here recently.  It's also really strikes me how historic it is that people can talk instantly to troops in a warzone like this.  I'm glad to hear the two of you got to connect, and I hope he gets to hear from more of his Perl friends to pass the time till he gets home.</p>

<p>Please pardon me if I'm stupid for asking this.  I know brian insists on having his name all lowercase, but I don't know why.  Does he also want it to always be in a monospace font like that?  Can someone tell me why on either of these, or do I have to meet him in person some day to find out?  No matter; someone who's done as much for the community as he has is entitled to whatever name he wants, and I'm personally well familiar with the struggle to get people to recognize a non-standard name.</p>

<p>Lowercase names are for COOL KIDS.</p>

<p>Ah; okay.  That seems as good an explanation as any...</p>

His style guide is <a href="http://www.panix.com/user/comdog/style.html" title="panix.com">here</a panix.com>. As to why, you'll probably have to ask him personally. Though if it's anything like mine, the mystery is much better than the reality<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

I'm not really in a war zone at the moment. I don't even have any weapons, which is a new thing, but heck, that's 60 fewer pounds I have to carry around<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
