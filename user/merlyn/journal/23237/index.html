<p>It costs a lot of money, and a lot of work, to throw the biggest party at OSCON year after year.
<p>
In some ways, I feel it's my obligation.  I suspect I'm one of the top three companies in the world to be making money nearly directly from open source, so I should kick some of that back to the community.  I donate to TPF, and provide the biggest kick-tail party at OSCON as examples of that.
<p>
But, as my business partners suggest, I really need to justify the money and time spent in terms of new sales.  So, this year, we're looking at revenue, and at sales, and at new business, and the debate raged on for at least the past few weeks of "OSCON Party: Yes, or No?".
<p>
I'm happy to announce that as of this moment, with a few concessions from a vendor or two, we're now in the "yes" category, once again.
<p>
I can't promise balloons or live alpaca this year, but you can at least have three or four hours worth of your favorite adult beverages at a nearby drinking establishment for this year's OSCON, once again.  And wearing a limited edition "OSCON 2005" T-shirt you can pick up at our booth.  Once again.
<p>
Details forthcoming as always.</p>

Given how many folks at LinuxWorld said (regarding the parties in Boston) "But Randal throws the best party at OsCon", this is welcome news. Maybe I can get there this year<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...
