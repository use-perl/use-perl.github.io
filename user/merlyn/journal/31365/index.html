<h1>Perl KDE bindings, anyone?</h1>

<div class="span8">
<p><p>I'm at an open source conference in Venezula, and one of the other speakers is a big guy in the KDE world.  Apparently, KDE is going to emphasize being able to write tools in high level widgets, for which they have great Python and Ruby supported bindings and demonstrations.  But when I asked about Perl, he said that it wasn't being included, because nobody is maintaining any sort of KDE binding for Perl!
<p>
Those of you looking for a project, please contact me and I'll put you in touch with him.  I really think Perl should be represented in this space.</p>

<h2>There is a kde-perl list</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/markjugg/">markjugg</a> on 2006-10-20T16:31:52</h3>
While I don't follow this space closely, I found that there is a <a href="http://mail.kde.org/pipermail/kde-perl/2006-October/thread.html" title="kde.org">kde-perl</a kde.org> mailing list which has existed for some time, and has activity as recently as this week.
<p>
It looks like someone just succeeded at embedded Perl in QT (vs uses the Perl bindings).
</p><p>
There's definitely activity there, but it's not clear to me at first glance if there level of support activity is near what's happening with Python or Ruby.
</p><p>
It seems nearly all of the GUI apps that I've seen written in these languages have been in Python.
</p><p>
The exceptions to that I'm aware of are Frozen Bubble and the Mandriva suite of GUI system tools.
</p><p>
Although they are nice open source tools, for whatever reason they haven't been forked or modified to work on many other distributions that I'm aware of.</p>



<h2>Parrot!</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/chromatic/">chromatic</a> on 2006-10-21T07:55:37</h3>
<p>Parrot bindings would be nice too; it would be doubly nice to see how well Parrot's NCI works for a real and useful project such as this.</p>
