<p>I'm just thinking that my accomplishment of having taught a grad-school level course for credit (Intro to Perl 501 for cse.ogi.edu) without having <i>ever</i> been to college might be somewhat rare.  Are there other instances that you've seen of a grad-school professor who has never themselves been to anything beyond a high-school education?</p>

I've heard of cases in those three areas.<br><br>Programmy type people, business people that have made it independantly and lecture in MBS courses, and people throughout the fine arts that do the odd clase in painting or drama/acting etc.<br><br>But for things like engineering or med or law, hell no.<br>

<p>Yet another proof that <a href="http://www.hacknot.info/hacknot/action/showEntry?eid=77" title="hacknot.info">software development is merely an occupation, not a profession</a hacknot.info>.</p>

I'd think of it more as a trade, like carpentry or brick laying.

Indeed. Stonehenge doesn't really teach a grad school level course so much as a course in a continuing education department, which are often taught by people outside the faculty.<br><br>Our Learning Perl course doesn't require a graduate school level understanding of anything.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
