<p>My buddy of 20 years, <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=bill+site:stonehenge.com">Bill Harp</a>, is getting married to Michelle, a woman he met on a cruise ship nearly two years ago and has been dating exclusively ever since.
<p>
But, they decided to get married in August.  In Los Vegas.  When I landed here yesterday, it was over 100 degrees. Ouch.
<p>
This morning, I ate at the Burger King embedded inside the casino embedded inside this hotel.  (They believe that you shouldn't have to endure this heat either, apparently.) While I was waiting for my Double-Beef Whopper with Cheese (for breakfast), I overheard the assistant manager telling the crew that "Chili would be offered only seasonally, in the winter".  I interrupted, "and when would that be?  When it gets down to 80 here?"  She said "No, it can get as low as 60... in the middle of the night".  Wow.</p>

<h2>100 degrees???</h2>

Can you drink your water before it evaporate?

It's a dry heat! The first time I went to Vegas, I went for 2 weeks in the summer because I was accepted to UNLV. 2 weeks in Vegas, 2 hours on the campus. I walked from the Luxor to Glitter Gulch in 120 degree heat. The trick is to stop in the hotels, sit at a table, get a free drink, then move on.



<h2>Hot you say?</h2>

It was 112&deg; here in Phoenix yesterday<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)



<h2>Gettin' Hitched in the Heat</h2>

I went to a friend's wedding in Tucson in May.  It was held in a park, in the middle of the day.  It was sunny, and at least 100 degrees.  Ouch.  Yet somehow, we managed to have a pretty good time.
