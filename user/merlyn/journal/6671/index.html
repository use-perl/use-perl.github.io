<p>I woke up this morning, checked out of the hotel, dragged my bag down to the Speaker's lounge, and started my daily hour-long email/usenet/monks pass.
<p>
Bruce Perens walked into the room just as a discussion about his upcoming talk (and change of plans) was happening both in the room and on IRC.  In fact, a lot of room discussions are reflected on IRC, thanks to all the wireless around here.
<p>
I jumped into Dan's Parrot talks just as my name was being mentioned.  That's twice this week where I've walked in to a room when my name was in the air.  Wow.
<p>
I handed Dan my uber-powerful green laser pointer when he seemed to be trying to point out some parts of the parrot engine in prose rather than pointing.  He gave it back to me after he said he was having too much fun with it.
<p>
Parrot looks cool.  I was hoping to get a jump start, and I did.  I'll have to play with it now, especially since it can play Hunt the Wumpus.
<p>
Still another few hours to go.  I'm probably going to sit in on the Secure Perl Scripts talk, and then do some email before the town meeting.
