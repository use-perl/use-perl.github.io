<p><p>Often, when I warn of security concerns for newbie web programmers, they retort "but I don't have anything of value... it's just my blog, so I don't care".
<p>The point is, they have a server. It's a potential spamming location, or anonymous platform from which to launch more dangerous attacks. What they have is <b>net</b> and <b>CPU</b>. That's useful to someone.
<p>Maybe there should be some sort of license before you're allowed to expose a web server to the public net. {sigh}</p>

<h2>There was a time...</h2>

...when I would have disagreed with you<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:).  Spending the last few years as a syadmin have opened my eyes, however.  If I ran an ISP that provided webspace of any kind, I'd have a code review team that would have to approve the code before the users can upload something potentially dangerous.  Sounds kinda harsh and big brother like, but I see it as protecting my other users, and my investment in bandwidth &amp; hardware.  If you want to throw up your own code and don't care about what happens, get your own box on a cable line, or go to another ISP that doesn't care.
<p>
Then again, I would probably never get any customers<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:(

<p>I actually heard a firsthand account of this today.  Now that's web 2.0!</p>
