<div class="span8">
<p>I'm trying to figure out how best to write this.  I want a subroutine to call another subroutine, and if the return value from that subroutine is true, this subroutine should return that value, otherwise continue.  Here's some contenders:
<pre>
eval { return thatroutine() || die };<br/><br/>for (thatroutine()) { return $_ if $_ }<br/><br/>$_ and return $_ for thatroutine();
</pre>
And then there's a few others that create explicit vars.  Any better way to say that?</p>

<h2>Maybe returning</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/dws/">dws</a> on 2005-03-05T17:03:59</h3>
Are you willing to suffer a temporary variable other than <tt>$_</tt>? If so, I would think that<blockquote><div> <tt>return $v if my $v = thatroutine();</tt> </div></blockquote>expresses the notion reasonably clearly, and less verbosely than<blockquote><div> <tt>my $v = thatroutine();<br>if ( $v ) return $v;</tt> </div></blockquote>or<blockquote><div> <tt>my $v = thatroutine();<br>return $v if $v;</tt> </div></blockquote>While verbose, neigher of these latter two is liable to lead a reader astray.

<blockquote><div> <tt>return $v if my $v = thatroutine();</tt> </div></blockquote>That won't work.  The $v isn't declared early enough.  There's no way to declare my $v and use it in the same statement.

<p>But if you use <code>$_</code> instead it will work. Along the same lines,</p> <blockquote><div> <tt>$_ = thatroutine() and return $_;</tt> </div></blockquote> <p>which IMO has a better distribution of emphasis.</p>

<p>And a clever for the sake of clever solution:</p> <blockquote><div> <tt>return $_ for grep $_, thatroutine();</tt> </div></blockquote>

<blockquote><div> <tt>$_ = thatroutine() and return $_;</tt> </div></blockquote>is a very bad solution because it overwrites $_, which is a global variable shared across all packages which some caller far up the chain may be using.<br> <br>At the very least throw a local in there.

I thought of that, actually, but didn't look closely enough at Randall's solutions referring to <code>$_</code> to notice they merely alias &#8211; rather than overwrite &#8211; it. My bad.

<h2>last</h2>

I generally use the simple and clear, although verbose:
<p> <code>my $v = thatroutine();
return $v if $v;</code>

</p><p>But another interesting idiom could be this one:
</p><p> <code>{ return thatroutine() || last }</code></p>

<p>Hmmm, awkward &mdash; this is one of those things that sounds like it ought to be simple (and clean) to do in Perl, but turns out not do be.  I don't like the <code>eval</code> version, for some reason: perhaps it gives a misleading impression that you expect the called subrountine is likely to die?</p>

<p>How about:</p> <blockquote><div> <tt>return thatroutine() || do {<br>&nbsp; # rest of the sub goes here<br>};</tt> </div></blockquote> <p>That expresses the logic of what you're up to: return the result either of that function or of running the rest of the code.</p>

<p>I'd probably shunt out the rest of the code to another sub just for symmetry, so you could do:</p><p><blockquote><div> <tt>return thatroutine() || otherroutine($var, \%whatever);</tt> </div></blockquote> <div>Smylers</div>

Trouble is nesting.<br> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; sub foo {<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...some code...<br> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; return thatroutine() || do {<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...some more code...<br> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; return thisroutine() || do {<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...some more code...<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; };<br> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; };<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; }<br> <br>You're already nested once for the subroutine.  Then again for the return exception and then possibly again and again.<br> <br>Anyhow, I think that's often the wrong emphesis.  Often you're kinda aborting the routine, for example.<br> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; sub user_info {<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; my $uid = shift;<br> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; my %info = _info_cache($uid);<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; return %info if keys %info;<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...get the user info...<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; }<br> <br>However, as you mentioned above, that might be better expressed by splitting into three routines:<br> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; sub user_info {<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; my $uid = shift;<br> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; my %info = _info_cache($uid) || _get_user_info($uid);<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; return %info;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; }<br>

Ugg, something went wrong with the formatting on that first example.  Should be
newlines before all the "...some more code..."

Try HTML formatting and using <code>&lt;ecode&gt;&lt;/ecode&gt; </code> tags. Automatically indents the code block for you too (less whitespace on copypaste).

<p>No, nesting is not a problem.</p> <blockquote><div> <tt>sub foo {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; #<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; return<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; thatroutine()<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; || do {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; #<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; }<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; || do {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; #<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; }<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; || do {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; #<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; }<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; || do {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; #<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; }<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; || do {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; #<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; }<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; || do {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; #<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; };<br>}</tt> </div></blockquote> <p>PS.: before I added this PS, the site wouldn't let me submit this comment because there was &#8220;too much repetition.&#8221; WTF?</p>

That code does not do the same thing as I posted.  Also it seems like its just a really awful way to write an if/elsif/else.<br> <br>PS  use.perl's odd filters have tripped me before.  I think they're vestiges from Slashdot that Pudge hasn't turned off.



<blockquote>

<h2>Re:do?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Aristotle/">Aristotle</a> on 2005-03-07T22:07:38</h3>
<p>It does do the same thing &#8211; the <code>thisroutine()</code> call is just the last statement of the first <code>do {}</code> block.</p>

<p>The construct doesn't have much in common with an <code>if</code>/<code>elsif</code> chain though. You could write it as one, but it would be very awkward and stilted.</p>

<p>Not that I'm a big proponent of this style, mind you.</p>

<h2>eval correct?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/offerk/">offerk</a> on 2005-03-06T13:11:13</h3>
Hi,<br>
In your question you wrote: <br>
<blockquote><div>
if the return value from that subroutine is true, this subroutine should return that value, otherwise continue.
</div></blockquote>
I don't see that happening with just this line:<br> <blockquote><div> <tt>eval { return thatroutine() || die };</tt> </div></blockquote>The "return" will return the value of "thatroutine()" outside the "eval", but it won't cause the inclosing subroutine to return, if I read the docs correctly. What am I missing?<br>
<br>
Anyway, I usually prefer a simple, readable solution, one that doesn't depend on the short-circuit behaviour of "&amp;&amp;" and relatives (not everyone groks such code), even if it is a little more verbose. How about:<br> <blockquote><div> <tt># I also dislike single letter variable names<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)<br>if (my $significant_name = thatroutine()) {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;return $significant_name<br>}</tt> </div></blockquote>

<p>Sorry, but that's a very poor reason to avoid the short circuit behaviour of boolean ops. Programmers worth their salt must know about it, it such a basic tool, so helpful tool for improving legibility, and so widespread among languages. Without flinching I will go so far as to suggest that those who really cannot figure it out even after explanations, possibly repeated, shouldn't be touching code in the first place.</p>

<h2>Clarity  shrt</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/schwern/">schwern</a> on 2005-03-06T17:21:17</h3>
It would be nice if there was a clear, short idiom to do this but if one cannot be found favor clarity over size.<br> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; my $whatever = foo();<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; return $whatever if $whatever;<br> <br>I know its a lot of repeating $whatever but its at least clear(ish).  Contrast with the other ideas:<br> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; eval { return thatroutine() || die };<br> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for (thatroutine()) { return $_ if $_ }<br> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; $_ and return $_ for thatroutine();<br> <br>They all trip mental circut breakers.  eval.  Loops.  Uses of $_.  They all say "this line is doing something complicated" which will cause the reader skimming code to stop and have to study that line.  Mental speed bumps.<br> <br>Additionally the above obscures the critical component, return.  The most important points in a subroutine are how you can get into it and how you can get out of it.  That you're return()ing should be the emphesis of the line.<br>
