<p>So, I'm still at <a href="http://www.dragoncon.org">Dragon*Con</a> in Hot-lanta.
<p>
Yesterday, I gave another "Just another convicted Perl hacker" talk to a highly-receptive audience.  I'd say there were about 50 attendees initially, but when I finished, the room had filled to capacity, probably closer to 100 or so.
<p>
I was immediately followed by a panel of some webcam grrls including <a href="http://www.mystrys.com">Mystrys</a> and <a href="http://www.bardiva.com">BarDiva</a>.  The room was completely full of guys.  Imagine that.  Oddly enough, they have adult content on their totally free sites, with nothing but meta tags to keep the kiddies from looking.  I raised the issue that they might want to look into some sort of age verification system, given the famous Tennessee prosecution of the California BBS operator which messed up any idea of safe harbor under free speech provisions.
<p>
I guess I also found it amazing that these girls were just doing it to be online and famous, and not for any profit motive.  They've got thousands of pictures of themselves and their friends on their sites, and most of them run live web cams, and then they journal every day into logs and watch for responses in open logs and email.
<p>
Who in the world would be silly enough to do that for free?
