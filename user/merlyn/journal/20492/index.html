<p>My brother is the techy guy for a small business, and he was recently trying to modify Postfix to talk to spamc/spamd.  He got into a bind, and IM'ed me.  The conversation went something like:
<p>
Me: so what did you change?
<p>
Him: I put stuff in from {mumble web page}, but I took it back out.
<p>
Me: So, you're back to the original working configs?
<p>
Him: I think so.
<p>
Me: <b>think?</b> What does RCS say?
<p>
Him: that I'm an idiot for not using it?
<p>
Heh.</p>

I was in the same boat about a year ago or so.  When I hosed my Postfix install I was wishing that I had used RCS of some kind.  I did get Postfix working with spamc/spamd after much searching with Google.  I wish that I had documented the process that I took but I didn't.

Yeah, I'm the idiot brother.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:D<br>
A few changes to the Postfix config files and I was hosed. Had to evntually uninstall Postfix, delete all the config dirs and reinstall it to get back to square one. Took a quick lesson on how to use RCS and saved the working setup before adding Spamassassin to Postfix.<br>
I did the quick and dirty config located at <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/spamassassin/IntegratedSpamdInPostfix" title="apache.org">http://wiki.apache.org/spamassassin/IntegratedSpamdInPostfix</a apache.org> <br>
That config works providing spamd doesn't die on you, which will cause all the email to bounce.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:P

Where was that information a year ago when I needed it?  That is pretty much how I ended up doing it.
