<div class="span8">
<p>After much gnashing of teeth, and getting copyright permission, I've now added <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/CGI-Prototype/">CGI::Prototype</a> to my CPAN releases.
This is the module alluded to by my <a href="http://www.stonehenge.com/merlyn/LinuxMag/col56.html">column on using Class::Prototyped for "classless classes"</a>.
<p>This module provides a very generic, very flexible framework for web applications, encouraging a good MVC design by putting light or heavyweight classes in charge of the Controller, Template Toolkit in charge of the View, and your favorite swizzler (mine is Class::DBI) as the Model.  I'm using this package for a Very Large University on two separate projects, and I'm told they may be settling on this architecture for many future web apps.  I'm also using this for <a href="http://geekcruises.com">geekcruises.com</a> for their entire online booking and admin application.  I find that this architecture captures the essence of a web app in a nice way.
<p>
The examples are a bit scarce... I hope to get a new release out within a few weeks that has a completed app as an example.  Also, I'm looking for help to create other subclasses for common session management, and so on.
<p>
I'm hoping that this framework is generic enough that a Maypole-like structure can be built on top, thereby scaling and integrating nicely with other apps.
<p>
Feedback welcome.</p>

elaborate on why we need another CGI framework?  I use (and love) <a href="http://cpan.uwinnipeg.ca/htdocs/CGI-Application/CGI/Application.html" title="uwinnipeg.ca">CGI::Application</a uwinnipeg.ca>, which already has built-in support for HTML::Template and plugin support for Template, Session Management, Input Validation, etc.  There's also a lively community around those modules already and the module authors are happy to receive patches and/or other contributions for improvements.

<h2>Glad to have Merlyn's contribution</h2>

Even if the new module shares some features with CGI::Application, I am very glad to have more publicly released code from Merlyn to review and learn from.

Answer #1: Why not?

Answer #2: TMTOWTDI

Answer #3: If you haven't written a CGI framework or a Templating system in Perl this month, can you <i>really</i> call yourself a Perl programmer?

Choose any three.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)</p>

Randal's explication of the Why of this module is serialized in his <a href="http://www.stonehenge.com/merlyn/LinuxMag/col70.html" title="stonehenge.com">Linux Magazine May-July, 2005 column #70</a stonehenge.com> and <a href="http://www.stonehenge.com/merlyn/LinuxMag/col71.html" title="stonehenge.com">#71</a stonehenge.com> and <a href="http://www.stonehenge.com/merlyn/LinuxMag/col72.html" title="stonehenge.com">#72</a stonehenge.com> as motivated, worked example(s).

<p>My summary -
</p><p>
CGI::Prototype offers a <em>different</em> way of factoring out the "you always had to write this glue code" code.  Catalyst uses the Perl Attributes annotations to factor out glue-code, which is classy demonstration that attributes are a good idea.  CGI::Prototype uses prototypical (instance-based, or nonce-class, or "Frame-Slot") inheritance.

<p>I wonder about the same question as Purdy.</p>

<p>Also, a somewhat offtopic request: could you add RSS (or preferrably Atom) feeds to your columns pages?</p>
