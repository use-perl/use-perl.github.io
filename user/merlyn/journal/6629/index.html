<p>Day 3 was the first really busy day at TPC.
<p>
I woke up early enough for a quick breakfast grab in the tent, then headed to the speaker lounge to read email for an hour or so.
<p>
At 10am, the exhibit hall opened, and since <a href="http://perltraining.stonehenge.com/">we</a> have a table, I started the cycle of manning the table.  Luckily, the wireless reaches into the hall, so I was happily on the net.  There's only enough room for two people, so my trainer team took turns providing one or two faces to chat with about on-site and open-enrollment Perl training.
<p>
During the day, we've actually chatted with a lot more serious leads than I had predicted.  This is a Good Thing.  I think the industry is turning around, based on this reaction and on watching the <a href="http://jobs.perl.org">perl jobs list</a>.
<p>
At 10:45, I snuck in to the overly full presentation by Damian of "what's new in Perl 6", and as always, learned a few more things.  I'm getting more comfortable every time I see it, and eagerly anticipating what's next.
<p>But then it was back to the booth for an hour or two, until Damian's afternoon "how different is Perl 6 to program in?" talk, again in an over-full room.
<p>As the trade show wound down for the day, I snuck out to see Tom Phoenix and a cast of a dozen others at the Lightning Talks.  Yes, a few of those bad puns Tom gave were mine, but Tom deserves 98% of the credit (and 100% of the guts to do it).
<P>Following that was a Helix-sponsored evening banquet, including some live music.  From a marketing perspective, all I know is that Helix has a T-shirt design and enough money to pay for food for everyone, but I got no clue about who they are or why. There was no signage to even place them in a general category. Bad move.
<p>Then it was back inside to the "Who's code is it anyway?", which I managed to walk in just as they were using my name as a prop for a laugh.
<p>
And then on to the <a href="http://www.activestate.com/">ActiveState</a> party.  As usual, much beer to consume, and some cake, and the lopsided ratio of 72 guys to two cute ActiveState booth women.  The annual "boat races" found me selecting "other" as a language to help the "Perl" team win, except that the "PHP" team had two ozzies on it, and won hands down.  Never challenge an Ozzie to a drinking game.  I stayed until 1:30am, then headed back to the hotel.</p>
