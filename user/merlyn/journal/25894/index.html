<p>Seen at <a href="http://www.sltrib.com/nationworld/ci_2890666">The Salt Lake Tribune (via Fark.com)</a>:
<blockquote>
Leading economic indicators: In June, Co-President Stephen S. Crawford of the financial giant Morgan Stanley (who was installed in the job in order to ensure management ''stability'' during the company's currently shaky status with investors) signed a two-year contract at $16 million a year which
allowed him, if he changed his mind, to resign and promptly collect all $32 million. A few days later, he resigned. The ''stability'' was needed at faltering Morgan Stanley because longtime CEO Philip J. Purcell had just been eased out, but his contract called for $113 million in severance pay.

If you checked our agreement, you'll see that if I resign, you owe me $30, and that if you resign, I owe you $70. It's only a difference in several orders of magnitude from Morgan Stanley, but it's a start.

The business world is officially promoting the greedy and shortsighted to places where they can do the <em>most</em> damage!  YAY!
