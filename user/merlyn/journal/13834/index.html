<p>I've managed to sneak past the border guards in Australia for the third time in three years, once again speaking at the annual <a href="http://sage-au.org.au">SAGE-AU</a> conference.
<p>
This year, I was able to get an entry visa nearly two days before driving to the airport, rather than the two hours I had last year, by starting a week earlier to get the permit. It seems that Oz already has its quota of felons, so my <a href="http://www.lightlink.com/fors/">criminal record</a> gets in the way.
<p>
Apparently, I'm "beating the heat": my home area is experiencing record-breaking temperatures, and I'm here in a city that is unlikely to get above 60 (degrees F) today. Next week for the conference, the highs are expected to be in the low 50s.  Brrr.
<p>
I did get to experience a record of some sorts. Two days ago (or was it yesterday?  I can't tell), I was in LA on a day in which it got rain--the first recorded rain in weatherkeeping history on that day of the year.  Sorry guys... just call that the revenge of a native Oregonian, as payback for all those californicators you've shipped up to our state.</p>
