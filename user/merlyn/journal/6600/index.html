<p>Day 2 (tuesday)
<p>
I sat in on Matt Sergeant's <a href="http://poe.perl.org">POE</a> talk in the morning. I did this for two reasons: I wanted to see if there was anything cool that I could steal for a column idea (with attribution, of course), and I had a column for <a href="http://www.stonehenge.com/merlyn/LinuxMag/">Linux Magazine</a> that was long overdue.
<P>
As for the latter, I had written the code a few weeks earlier: a simple web spider to perform link checking, using 10 POE sessions to allow the page fetches and DNS lookups to proceed in parallel.  dngor had thankfully updated PoCo-ClientHTTP to use the PoCo-ClientDNS for non-blocking lookups, so my program ran lickity split.  dngor also vetted my code to ensure that I wasn't saying any lies.
<p>But the text had not been written, and the magazine editor was getting around to "if you don't get it in today, we run without it". So, there I sat, in Matt's presentation, writing a magazine column.  As the presentation was winding up, I submitted a review draft to the usual suspects, including dngor, who okayed the wording, and it was off to the publisher.  Yeah!  That submission paid for my conference hotel. {grin}
<P>
After an afternoon of kicking back and socializing, I headed into Larry's State of the Onion talk, sitting front-row-center as I had managed to do for nearly all the previous talks.  This year's Onion was based on the articles appearing in a recent Scientific American.  What'll Larry do to outdo himself next year, I always wonder.
<p>
Following the Onion was Jon's quiz show.  Always good for a few laughs, mostly from Jon's selection of materials and jokes, although some of the responses were quite humorous as well.
<p>
During the quiz show, <tt>brian d foy</tt> was presenting the White Camel awards.  The third award was to be given to <a href="http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=979">vroom</a> for his work on the Monastery, but time ran out before <tt>brian</tt> was able to get back to the stage.  Oh well.
<p>
Tom Phoenix and I worked on our presentation a bit more, and he also previewed his Lightning Talk for me.
