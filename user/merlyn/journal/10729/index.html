<p>Apparently, Simon Phipps had <a href="http://www.webmink.net/2003_02_16_oldblog.htm">an interesting comment in his weblog</a> about how fearful the Microsoftians are of open source.  Interesting followup to my <a href="/user/merlyn/journal/10639">earlier journal entry</a>.</p>

<h2>Innovation</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Ovid/">Ovid</a> on 2003-02-21T19:12:58</h3>
<p>Yes, yes, the best way to foster innovation is to stifle any discussion of ideas which counter Microsoft's innovation.</p>

<p>Sheesh.  If that Web log is even remotely accurate (and given Microsoft's behavior in the past, I'm inclined to believe it), then Microsoft is digging themselves even further into a hole.  They are failing to realize that they face a fundamentally different business model and traditional tactics against a non-traditional "enemy" are foolish.  It reminds me of the French defeat at the hands of British archers during the battle of Agincourt.  The French tremendously outnumbered the British, but because they fought a "traditional" battle against unconventional forces, they didn't respond appropriately and their defeat was assured.</p>

<p>In a capitalist society, for there to be innovation, you have to have competition (any economist would be happy to explain how monopolies <em>must</em> stifle innovation) and if a new, successful business model arrives (mass production, anyone?) then businesses using an old model must find a way to adapt.  While companies may fall, sound business models usually don't.  Microsoft would do better to figure out how they can work with this model, rather than work against it.</p>

Your comparison with the Azincourt battle is most accurate, (but nevertheless optimistic), but there is more : the French at Azincourt were simply incompetent, and it took only a few hours until they realize that all their attempts were doomed. In this case, the Microsoftians appear to simply and purely reject any challenging of their Weltanschauung, or even any allusion to an opinion different than theirs. In other words, they're victims of the propaganda of their own Boss. You know who they remind me ? the current American and English warmongers who can't explain and discuss reasonably why they think the war against Iraq would be a good thing, and who seem to be only able to ignore or attack <i>ad hominem</i>-ly the people that don't agree with them.

The worst rhetorical sin I'm guilty of here is guilt by association, claiming those who marched were supporting terrorist monsters.<br> </p><p>In fact, there's some irony in your claims, as you throw around the term "warmonger".  My own "guilt by association" crime is small by comparison to your broad brush dismissal of all arguments we've made here as being Ad Hominems.<br> </p><p>In previous discussions on this forum, you've thrown around such unsupportable accusations like Americans just want to "go to War as soon as possible".  When challenged on the facts that the US has worked through the UN for more than a decade, you change the subject or fail to respond.<br> </p><p>Consider for a moment that the reason we may be talking past each other is that you aren't listening and not that Americans are monsters.</p>

At the contrary, you should not take personal offense at this. Your comments, and other ones by pudge et alii, demonstrate that you understand the situation, that you can explain it, and discuss beyond ad hominem arguments. I do really appreciate them, and I'm happy to discuss with people that don't passively agree with me, as I can assure that you actually made my opinion on this war evolve, because I learnt. When I speak about warmongers, I'm not targetting the useperlers, or not even the goverments, who are supposed to be more informed than us (they have intelligence services!), but the insupportable media tabloids such as the english Sun or the like. (yes, I'm actually comparing Microsoft to the Sun<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-) Is this more clear ? Sorry again, I know that sometimes foreign languages are a difficult limitation.

I should apologize.  I should not assume ill will on the part of anyone here.<br> <p>I think I have a hard time accepting that people with whom I have a disagreement are of good will.  The funny thing is, that I still argue endlessly, which is funny since if they are not of good will then argumentation would be of no use.<br> </p><p>I think I get so upset exactly because I assume ill will toward me by others, when in fact, it may be ill will BY me toward others.  I've learned (and forgotten many times) that usually the things that make you the most upset are flaws in your own makeup that are difficult to accept.<br> </p><p>I apologize to everyone here who I may have offended in this discussion, or previous heated discussions.  An argument I had with pudge some time back comes to mind here.<br></p>

Please feel free to moderate this as 'offtopic'.  Any discussion of moderation in a discussion that's not about moderation really is offtopic, but...<br> <p>The above really isn't a Troll.  It's probably better classified as Flamebait.  See <a href="http://www.everything2.com/" title="everything2.com">Everything</a everything2.com> or <a href="http://jargon.watson-net.com/" title="watson-net.com">The Jargon File</a watson-net.com>, if you're interested in the distinction.</p>
