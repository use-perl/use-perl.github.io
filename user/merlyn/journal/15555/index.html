<div class="span8">
<p>I had been handing $random@stonehenge.com by letting postfix deliver to my procmailrc, which fired up a separate Perl invocation to sort and deliver the mail for each incoming. And test for spam.
<p>
The problem is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIRV">MIRVs</a>.  A lot of mail gets addressed to thereto@stonehenge, barney@stonehenge, merlyn@stonehenge, for about 10 addresses.  And this type of spam seems to have greatly increased in the past few months.  A burst would come in, and for the next two minutes, I was splitting and forking and SpamAssassin-ing, and loadav would hit 3 or so, and my sublease customers were complaining.
<P>
So yesterday, I bit the bullet, and learned about <a href="http://www.ijs.si/software/amavisd/">Amavisd</a>, a Perl daemon built around Net::Server, that could pull in SpamAssassin and some virus checkers.  I carefully read the "README.postfix" file included in the distro, and set up everything.
<p>
Wow, what a difference.  Now my postfix/amavisd MTA checks for spam once for the MIRVs, without forking, instead of 10 times with a lot of forking going on.  My loadav has never exceeded 0.9!  Hooray.  Success.
<p>
I'm getting about 1 MIRV a minute.  Ouch.
<p>
My only concern is that the amavisd is started and stopped outside the normal postfix engine, so I'm concerned about what happens when it goes down.  (Postfix will just stop, but I won't be around to notice.)  I'm thinking of a cronjob entry to just keep restarting it every half hour or so, just in case it fries.</p>

Just do your entire <a href="http://www.develooper.com/code/qpsmtpd/" title="develooper.com">smtpd in perl</a develooper.com>.<br> <br>There's two pieces left to the qpsmtpd puzzle - firstly to have a pure perl server (which I've just checked into CVS, but it's a little premature yet - help would be most welcome since this is an area you have lots of experience in), and secondly to have a pure perl delivery system (perhaps delivering to procmail, but also needs to support onward relaying).<br> <br>Sorry, I hate it when people like me suggest a <i>completely</i> different solution to the one you just found that works perfectly well<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-) I'll shut up now.

There are times when I want a stick shift, and times when I want an automatic.
<p>
For email delivered to $FOO@stonehenge.com, I want an automatic.  If it was just my own mail, I'd be happy to play with new tools, and take the risks (and rewards of such).
</p><p>
I think you can both relate, and agree.</p>

have you tried MailScanner (yet another Perl-wrapper for SpamAssassin)
I enjoy it very much and it has auto-recycling and multiple instance and multiple possible MTA.<br/><br/>-- dominix
