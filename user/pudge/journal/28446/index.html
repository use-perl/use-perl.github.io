<p>People talk about the Steelers being a sixth place team, but they did win 11 games, and two of their three losses, Big Ben didn't even play.<br/><br/>Ben's got only four career losses in his two seasons: his first loss was to the defending (and future) Super Bowl champion Patriots in the playoffs last year.  His second was to the Patriots this year.<br/><br/>Then he lost to the as-yet-undefeated Colts in week 12, and a close one to the Bengals the following week.  And then he beat them in back-to-back weeks in the playoffs.<br/><br/>Not that Seattle can't beat Pittsburgh, but it takes a lot to knock off the Steelers with Roethlisberger at the helm.<br/><br/>I don't really care who wins.  My family is all from Pittsburgh originally, but they are too much a rival of the Pats for me to like them.  I live in Washington, near Seattle, and my only reason for not wanting the Seahawks to win have nothing to do with the team itself: I don't want the fans who barely know the names of five Seahawks -- which covers most of the fans I've met -- to talk smack for the next year.

... Steelers fans are a lot like Yankee fans. They show up for lots of games here in Bmore (even when they're team isn't playing), just to harass the homers.

Yeah, Steelers fans get intense.  Also, what the heck is up with that Horrible Hanky?  Absolutely the worst mass-fan-participation activity I've ever seen, outside of all-out rioting.
