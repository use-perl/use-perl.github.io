<p>I finally got me Mac OS X 10.1, and while I am not a fan of Mac OS X, version 10.1 is significantly better than 10.0.  Lots of good stuff in it, much cleaner and more consistent.  I still hate the paned file dialogs.  It seems slightly easier to navigate overall.<br/><br/>I installed it, and the Dev Tools, on the new PowerBook on a 2GB partition, and on the old PowerBook on the single 12GB drive (so both Mac OS X 10.1 and Mac OS 9.2.1 are on the same partition).  I plan on this old PowerBook being my Mac OS X box.<br/><br/>So far, it seems reasonable.  I don't like iTunes; SoundJam MP is far better.  iTunes is too dumbed down (and dumb).  I did get xmms (along with gnome, XFree86, etc.) installed (using <A HREF="http://fink.sf.net/">fink</A>, a port of apt-get/dselect), but it doesn't work well yet.  I need an MP3 player on this box.  I spent an hour or so figuring out how to get lookupd and NetInfo configured so I could override DNS, which I would call a huge waste of time except for that now I understand NetInfo a bit better.<br/><br/>I can't do USB Printer Sharing with it, which is a royal pain.  Also, this computer has hardware DVD decoding, and the only Apple DVD player for Mac OS X is for software decoding.  Fooey!<br/><br/>So I can use it for development and for file serving and for MP3 playing and for general playing around ... but if I can't do USB Printer Sharing, that might stink.  We'll see.<br/><br/>It's still much too far away for me to use as a replacement for Mac OS 9.</p>
