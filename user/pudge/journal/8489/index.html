I was reading Doc Searls this morning and he was wanking off regarding some nonsense about how blogging is this new experiment, we're just learning how to do it, relating it to "big-J journalism," wank wank wank wank wank.  Blogging as is known here is nothing different than an old BBS.  Nothing different at all.  Someone posts their thoughts, others respond.  This is the same old stuff over and over again.  Blogging is not new.  Blogging is not interesting.  Blogging does not exist, because "blog" is one of the stupidest-sounding words ever invented and I am never going to use it again, because I feel like a moron just typing those four letters in succession.
&lt;/rant&gt;

<h2>Usenet</h2>

It's the new usenet, without the spam. And it's much easier to killfile.



<h2>Someone's journaling some rage...</h2>

<p>I recoil from the word "journal," as the latte-snortin', tattoo-wearin', self-absorbed slackers of yesteryear applied this perfectly acceptable word to the drivel spewed into their dogearred coffeehouse notebooks. Now one can successfully lobby me into disliking the term "blog" with the simple argument that the very same yahoos that used to <b>journal</b> now <b>blog</b>.

</p><p>However, "blog" is a funny, ugly word. It's kind of a lexical pumpkin - short, squat and bumpy. I've always had a soft spot in my heart for pumpkins.

</p><p>I will join my spleen to yours on the topic of journalist (as in professional media types) who somehow want to aggrandize "blogging" (*giggle*) with a "New Journalism". Doesn't this sound like the same kind of braying that we used to hear about the "New Economy?" What ill-conceived nonsense. Luckily, the noise will quiet soon.</p>
