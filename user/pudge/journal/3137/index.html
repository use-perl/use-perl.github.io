<p>I have a lot to do this week.  I need to release MP3::Info and MacPerl.  I need to do a lot of things for my wife, since she is resting as much as possible.  I need to do my real job.  I need to prepare more for our coming child.<br/><br/>We spent almost 6 hours in the hospital just so they could observe mother and child.  Ugh.  Nothing wrong, we didn't think we were in labor or anything, they just wanted to observe, in the off-chance that something might happen.  I am not angry with them, just tired and busy.  I want to say I have more important things to do than waiting for nothing to happen in a hospital for 6 hours, though that wouldn't really be true, but I do have other things to do, and since we didn't need to be in the hospital in the first place ... but at least we have now had somewhat of a dress rehearsal, so we really know what to expect when we get there for real.  I now know what all the buttons do on the various things in the room (including the UA Reference button which I guessed zeroed out the monitor for relative pressure, and was right, though my wife didn't want me to press buttons without knowing for sure what they did ... but I'm an engineer!  The plug says "UA" on it, and the monitor was recording 60 when she changed positions instead of 10, and the nurse had said something about setting the resting position on the monitor, so hey, it should work, right?)</p>
