<p>The Red Sox (which, as you know, will win the World Series this year) are on national TV for five of six straight games.  Last night they were on ESPN in the finale with the Tigers, and ESPN will have games on the mornings (Pacific time, anyway) of Friday and Monday, as well as Sunday night.  Fox has Saturday's matchup.  The only game not on TV is Friday night.<br/><br/>All of these games are against the Yankees, in Boston.  The Yankees lead the division by 1.5 games (assuming they can't come back from a 12-2 deficit here in the bottom of the 7th).<br/><br/>Go Sox!

Red Sox and Yankees.  Both will be in the playoffs again.  Gosh, isn't baseball fun....if your team happens to have one of the top 10 payrolls?
<p>
Pffffftttttttttttttttttttt.
</p><p>
Oh, there's another question for "Ask Pudge" - What is your opinion on implementing a salary cap and/or revenue sharing in MLB?</p>

<em>Red Sox and Yankees. Both will be in the playoffs again. Gosh, isn't baseball fun....if your team happens to have one of the top 10 payrolls?</em><br><br>Actually, chances are, one or the other will not be in the playoffs.  That's part of what makes this series so important.  The Chicago White Sox are in first place in the Wild Card chase, with records better than both the Sox and Yankees.  And the Twins are in second, ahead of the Sox.<br><br>

<i>Actually, chances are, one or the other will not be in the playoffs.</i>
<p>
With the expanded league and the expanded playoff system the Yankees have reached the playoffs <a href="http://mlb.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/mlb/history/postseason/mlb_ds.jsp" title="mlb.com">every year</a mlb.com> since the 94 strike season.  In that time, they have been to the World Series six times, winning four of them.
</p><p>
I'd say, with the current system, their obscene payroll (over 50% larger than the #2 payroll) is a guaranteed playoff spot, with a 50/50 chance of a World Series win.  DUMB.</p>
