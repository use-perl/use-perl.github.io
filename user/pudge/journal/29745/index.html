You wrote in your journal a while back about the film "Fever Pitch" and I wanted to ask the question then but didn't.<br><br>I watched the film on a plane and only intermittently but at one stage one of the die-hard Red Sox fans says that they will have play in the "The House of Pain". From the context I guess that they meant the Yankees stadium. Is that right?<br>

Yes, but I don't know why they would call it that.  The Red Sox, in the years leading up to and following that movie, have done quite well in Yankee Stadium.  Sure, there was the dramatic Game 7 loss in the 2003 ALCS, but one game does not make for such epithets: there was, after all, the more dramatic Game 6 loss in the 1986 World Series in Fenway Park.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br>
