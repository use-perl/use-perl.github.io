<p>I just turned on Sendmail on my Mac OS X box that I use as a server.  /var/spool/mqueue was empty, but I was getting hundreds of old cron emails.  cfedde on #perl pointed me to clientmqueue, where I found 99,798 files.  Oops.<br/><br/>killall sendmail and rm * ... argument list too long.  perl -le 'opendir $x, "." or die $!; for (readdir $x) { unlink; print }'.  There we go.

Yeah, you probably use sed too!<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

xargs is especially useful with find - it lets you run a command (like rm) on large numbers of files at a time, but breaking them up so it is not too many at a time.  (Using -exec from find runs a separate command for each file found, which can be very slow for a large/deep file tree.)

Yeah, I use xargs quite a bit, esp. with find<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... however, I didn't think about using echo *.  An ls took forever, I don't know how long echo * would take.  readdir was surprisingly, relatively, fast.

ls -1 is better than echo *,<br>because your shell still has<br>to do the globbing for the latter...<br>and you may lose

That's sorta what I figured<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... I don't know if the shell could have handled echo *.  And again, ls took forever.  Stoopid Unix!

Doh! I missed that the first time through.<br>ls shouldn't be slow though. Stoopid MacBSD?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-P<br>Of course it depends on the filesystem,<br>it's not advisable for many to have single<br>directories with so many files. It might have<br>been quicker to remove the directory and<br>recreate it afterwards<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)

ls -f has been around since version 7 days, back when men were men and computers were slow. The -f option tells ls to use the order that it finds entries in the directory - which means that there is no time required to sort the entries before displaying them.  With a really large number of entries in a directory, that sort could take a while (especially when Unix was running on a PDP-11).

<p>ls sorts the entries in the directory, while echo does not, which means ls will always be slower for large directories.  <code>echo * | xargs rm</code>
is simply the shell's glob operator, which is
most likely implemented using readdir.</p>

<p>My understanding is that only works for GNU xargs, though.</p>

<p>Of course, who would want to use a proprietary xargs?</p>
