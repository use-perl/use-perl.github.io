<p>I listened to the 5-7 innings on the radio en route to my hockey game.  I saw innings 8 and 9 on the TV there.  When they won, I let out some barbaric YAWP and fell to my knees.<br/><br/>My game started about 10 minutes later, so I was kindof in a daze, and I am still not convinced it happened.  I have to keep checking the web, radio, and TV to convince myself.  If I wake up tomorrow and it's still all there, then perhaps I will be convinced.

<p>It was reported on the main news on the Today Programme on Radio 4 today. (ie not in the sports news). I doubt that it's not true. (Either that, or the journalist in question, the director general and the chairman of the governers will resign after a protracted argument and an official whitewash, er "inquiry" (and then a year later it will be quietly admitted that actually the key allegations were true, while only minor details such as the victory margin had been wrong))</p>

Even then, it's not a sure thing.

A week or two ago, when Bush was out campaigning, there was an article
in the New York Times magazine that discussed some policy or other of
his, and didn't paint it in a flattering light.  Kerry jumped all over
it.  Bush's first response?  <i>Well, it was in the New York Times, so who
knows if a reporter just made that up!</i>

I say wait for the recount.  Boston threw more than a few strikes
outside the strike zone, but miraculously, St. Louis had some
pitches in the strike zone that were called as balls.  The outcome
of the series will be debated in the Supreme Court any day now.</p>

Yeah, in the back of my mind, I keep thinking, maybe they league will rule that WAS a foul tip and he gets another pitch<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...
