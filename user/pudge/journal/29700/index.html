<div class="span8">
<p>I have a bunch of old floppy disks with papers and other junk on them.  I don't need most of it, but I don't want to lose it either.<br/><br/>So I need a computer with a floppy drive and HD that can read both DD and HD disks.<br/><br/>(And, preferably, one that I can install my old software on, in case I need to <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/pudge/.Pictures/drecorder.png">export data</a> as I did with the MIDI programs from one of the songs I recorded a couple of years ago, but had originally programmed back in '92 on Deluxe Music Recorder.)<br/><br/>I had a Power Mac 7100/66.  I figure I can copy to it, then move over the network.  But alas, the clock battery leaked all over the motherboard.  $10 to drop it off at the dump.<br/><br/>Next up: an LCII.  I can copy to its internal HD, and then move to high-density disks, which my USB floppy drive will read, and I can then copy to my server for archival.  That would suck, but I could always connect my PowerBook G3/400 (which runs Mac OS X 10.3) to it as a SCSI drive (making sure I use the <a href="http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=24281">correct cable</a>), since it has a SCSI port.<br/><br/>Ah, but then, I remember I have a Syquest EZ135 SCSI drive.  So even better: copy data from floppies to EZ135 cart, then to PowerBook from there.  I forgot I also had archived stuff on those carts, so I first test it on the PowerBook, copying off all the carts (some of which are temperamental).  Then I go to the LCII.  And it works great ... until the LCII stops working.  Restart.  Death chime.<br/><br/>Ow.  But it still sorta works, for a few minutes, so last resort, I can try to use the LCII anyway.<br/><br/>Next up: a Quadra 610.  It works OK ... except no video.  Argh.  Video card just plain doesn't work.  $10 to the dump.<br/><br/>Not wanting to waste any more time, I find a IIsi on eBay for $20.50, shipping included.  It says it all works fine.  So, I get it, it arrives, and I plug it all in.  No video.  I forgot the IIsi video is a little wacky.  But I have some video adapters, and one of them actually works.<br/><br/>That obstacle hurdled, I pop in some floppies.  The first two work, then ... the next dozen don't.  The floppy drive doesn't work properly.  This was not mentioned on the eBay page, except for a little item about having to load the OS from an external hard drive.  Figures.<br/><br/>But I still have the LCII.  And a SuperDrive is a SuperDrive (at least, it was circa the early 90s).  So I switch them, and ... happiness.  (And the LCII will cost me another $10 at the dump.)<br/><br/>Among my floppy archives were tons of games.  And now I have a IIsi in great condition to play them on!  Mmmmm, Falcon.  I have only 9MB in it, maybe I should try to max it out to 65.  It also has over 100MB of HD space.<br/><br/>
