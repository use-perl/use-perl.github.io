<p>Josh McAdams <a href="http://perlcast.com/2006/01/05/interview-with-chris-nandor/">interviewed me for Perlcast</a>.  Josh does a really nice job with these interviews, I've enjoyed listening to them all.  We did it using Skype, which I'd never used before.  Not sure exactly how he recorded it, I forgot to ask (if it were me, I'd probably have used <a href="http://www.cycling74.com/products/soundflower.html">Soundflower</a>).  I supplied the bumper music with one of my amazing smash hits, <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/pudge/#You_re_Clueless">You're Clueless</a>.

<p>I'd be very interested to know how he did that. I asked the Skype support how to record conversations, and they told me you couldn't.</p>
<p>I've done a few face-to-face interviews of Perl people for a French print magazine, but being able to use Skype for them would make it possible to interview people anytime, and not just during conferences!</p>

What OS are you using?

<p>I'm currently using Skype on a Windows machine, but I have a Linux machine at hand (if it's easier with it).</p>

Josh replied to my other journal on Slashdot about <a href="http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=173139&amp;cid=14429221" title="slashdot.org">doing it from Windows</a slashdot.org>: he uses hardware.  On a Mac, as I mentioned, I could use Soundflower: I'd set Soundflower as the output channel for Skype, then set the Soundflower channels as inputs to my audio application.  If latency is an issue I can use a little app called Soundflowerbed to monitor the audio as I am sending it to the application.  Dunno if there is such a thing for Windows, but there should be.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br>
