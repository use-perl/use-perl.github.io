<p>As mentioned previously, I had wrist surgery this month.  The doctor removed a piece of damaged cartilage (TFCC) between my ulna and hand.  I am recovering very well.  It was two weeks ago yesterday, and I already have 95% motion or so.  It still hurts, but it hurts significantly less every day.  I have been typing all week with both hands, and yesterday played guitar (though not so much with the barre chords).<br/><br/>Speaking of guitars, since I've been unable to play much (even before the surgery, as I had a lot of pain), I've spent more time on preparing to play.  Our spare room is now a music room, with a Yamaha digital piano, an iMac, microphones, monitors, etc.  I cleaned up my old Epiphone strat-style guitar and have begun the process of making some changes to it (I put a Kahler tremolo on it some years ago, and am now putting in Fender electronics).  I ordered a Washburn X40 guitar yesterday.  I need to restring my Martin acoustic.  A friend of mine has an Ibanez Road Star II bass to round out my collection (I first played the cello, then moved to bass guitar, but have not had a bass in 10 years or more).  When my wrist is fully healed, I am gonna get back into playing and recording.
