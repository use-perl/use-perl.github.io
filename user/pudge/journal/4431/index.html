<p>Nat has 100 friends on use Perl.  A lot of people read his journal.  However, far fewer people read your journal.  Many more people read the front page than read your journal.  If something interesting happens that might be of general interest to the Perl community, consider hitting that "Submit Story" link and submit it for general consumption.<br/><br/>It seems like there's not much Perl news these days.  But that can't be the case.  So submit your news stories.  If you do, you'll get a cookie!  Sure, it'll be an HTTP cookie, but if I meet you at a Perl conference, I might make it a real cookie, like something from Keebler.<br/><br/>Oh, and FWIW, the SOAP interface <EM>is</EM> working; this entry is proof.  :-)

There seems to be a considerable amount of activity in the perl community, but if you were to look at us from the outside we'd seem like we were on our last breath.  I religiously read <a href="http://lwn.net/" title="lwn.net">Linux Weekly News</a lwn.net> and if you compare perl's part of the development page to just about anything else, we're nearly non-existant.  This has been bothering me for a while and I'm glad I'm not the only one.  If use.perl.org could start getting more stuff into news form (at least one real story per day), then we could go to people like LWN and say, this is what you need to be putting in for this week's perl headlines.

I submitted a story a few days ago highlighting the release of RCX modules for perl.  This seemed pretty cool and noteworthy.  My explanation of it might not have been the most lucid or interesting, but it seemed newsworthy.  Anyway, my story was rejected.  I'm not saying there weren't good reasons to do so, but knowing what was wrong with it or what the powers-that-be expect from submissions would be helpful.

Well, the RCX modules are old.  They've been around for a couple of years and have been reported before (including mention in The Perl Journal), and I didn't see anything in your submission that marked anything new of significance going on with them.  I am not at all against posting a blurb about a new module, but it should be something more than announcing a new release of an existing module; basically, I'd prefer to post blurbs about modules that have undergone extra-significant changes, or are entirely new.<br> <br>That said, I also don't want to turn the front page into a list of modules.  There is already a <a href="http://use.perl.org/index.pl?section=modulelist" title="perl.org">page for that</a perl.org>; if we got a significant number of worthwhile "new module" or "module change" submissions, I'd probably relegate them to a separate section.  Of course, right now, we don't have that problem.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

But so much of what happens with perl is about the modules!  (I've spent some time lately recompiling php almost daily for a client that keeps wanting to throw different things in or change the database backend version, so my appreciation for the perl module system is quite high at the moment.)  I don't want to turn the front page into a module list per se, but if 50% of what was there centered around interesting modules it would get us a lot closer to having at least daily stories.  Many people would benefit from highlighting these modules because the normal mechanisms for disseminating new module information don't have any editorial control at all.  Things like RCX, Alzabo, etc. haven't been covered very much and have a pretty low visibility.  Core modules obviously don't need to show up there.
<p>Alternatively, if you really are opposed to having more module-focused content as use.perl stories, what sort of stories would you want to expand coverage?  How much content is there that's of somewhat general interest, but isn't being covered already or isn't module-focused?</p>

Fifty percent wouldn't be bad.  Ninety percent would be bad.  There's a balance to be had.<br> <br>Plus, if it ever got to be that much, I could put a link on the home page to "Module News".<br> <br>But that's down the road, if it becomes overwhelming, which, again, is not currently a prooblem.  If someone wants to submit module news, please do; I just want it to be more interesting than "this module was released".  Maybe I could even give author status to someone who wanted to take over for posting stories about new/updated/interesting modules.  The main thing, though, is just that the stories are interesting; your post didn't amount to anything more than "a module that's already been reported on has been updated".  No offense intended, but I don't find that to be too interesting.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br> <br>I would like more module news, it just needs to be interesting, which mostly means it is something more than "this is new" or "this is updated," and is something more substantive than what has been previously reported.

<p>No offense taken.  I definitely recognize that it wasn't one of best efforts.  My quill petered out before I would have hoped.</p>

Yes.  But talk to me before submitting it, to make sure that your time spent on it isn't "wasted".  You have my email address.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)
