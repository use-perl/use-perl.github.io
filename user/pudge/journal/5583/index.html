<p>My TiBook has been crashing for no apparent reason.  I did everything to eliminate causes: removed RAM, ran hardware tests, ran CPU-intensive software overnight, tried different OSes, reinstalled OSes, ran surface scans of partitions, ran file and filesystem checks, etc.  The only thing I noticed for sure is that I was always doing something on the keyboard when it froze, and usually happened in my lap (only one freeze yesterday while at my desk, but several of them on my lap).<br/><br/>So after four Apple tech support guys, I thought some more and decided to run some more tests.  I hit the space bar repeatedly.  Freeze after a few seconds.  Try again, in Mac OS X.  Freeze.  Try again, no freeze.  Why no freeze?  Doh, it is on the desk this time.  Put it on my lap.  Freeze.<br/><br/>Apple is sending me a new keyboard; hopefully this does the trick.  If not, at least I can send it in to them with a repeatable test case.<br/><br/>And Yes, I sorta do wish I had an iBook 14" right now, instead of this thing.  Too fragile, horrible AirPort range.  Sigh.</p>

When I lived in the barracks, my mouse pointer would freeze *if* I was moving the mouse at the moment the air conditioning kicked in or turned off.  However, if the mouse pointer was motionless it didn't affect it.  And yes, I had a surge protector.  It took me a while to figure this out.
<p>
The only thing I can think of that would be causing your problem is some sort of static discharge caused by sitting in your lap.  Perhaps some "Bounce" with your laundry is in order.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

Sorry, I didn't mention that the lap thing is most likely related to the fact that the TiBook has a lot of "flex" in it.  It is clearly a flaw in my particular computer (whether the keyboard or something else), and not a flaw in the model itself (except that the decision to use Titanium is specious, in light (ha!) of all the problems with it), but the point is that when in my lap (or on my <a href="http://www.coolpad.com/" title="coolpad.com">CoolPad</a coolpad.com>), the body is allowed to flex, which contributes to the problem somehow.  At least, that seems the most logical explanation.  I hope it is a keyboard problem, and not something else, though, because if it is something else, I might not get the computer repaired in time for YAPC.<br> <br>Either way, I get to keep the extra keyboard, w00p!

Perhaps it gets too hot when it is on your lap, but gets a bit more airflow and heat sink ability from the desk.

No, it isn't heat.  I can pick it up from the desk, put it in my lap, and freeze it within a few seconds.

It's just really shy.
