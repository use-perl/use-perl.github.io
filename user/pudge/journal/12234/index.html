<p><A HREF="http://pudge.net/images/moon.jpg">Tonight's lunar eclipse</A>.  Taken from Massachusetts with a Nikon Coolpix 995 from 10:10 p.m. to 11:12 p.m.  Exposures at f/5.6 from 1/2000 sec. to 8 sec.  It got a little fuzzy at the end, as the clouds began to roll back in.

To help me track some stars and where the moon would be showing up, yeah.  I also recorded the moon some through the telescope with an electronic eyepiece to the DV camera, so I got the motor going on the telescope so it would track the moon as it moved, which meant aligning the telescope, which meant pointing it at certain stars, which is easier when you know which stars are which.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

Wow! That's awesome! Nice pic.  It was pretty cloudy in Boston last night, so I watch 3 hours of Farscape instead.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

Yeah, the cloud cover was very heavy at 8 p.m., I thought I wouldn't be able to get anything, but it cleared by 9.

Lucky you.  The cloud cover in Toronto hasn't cleared yet (noon the next day).  Just to add insult to injury, Wednesday night was perfectly clear.

Yeah, Wed. was very clear for us, too.  I was all ready to gripe about it, and then it cleared.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)
