<p>My house in Massachusetts is empty except for me, my dogs, and my computer.  And some salami.<br/><br/>The cats are in the car, beginning to be miserable.<br/><br/>I plan to get to Ohio today before finding a nice rest area to sleep in.<br/><br/>See you in Washington.

<h2>drive safely</h2>

<p>It's a weird feeling yet oddly liberating isn't it?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) I've done that drive before and it's easy all the way into Nebraska/the Dakotas...and then it gets dull for about 1200 miles. Twin falls Idaho makes for a scenic pitstop/lunch and western Washington is cool in spots. Wish I could ride shotgun as I'm dead bored and homesick these days....a roadtrip is always good for what ails ya. Take pictures!<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>



<h2>somewhat reversed on my end</h2>

Last week I helped my wife settle into our new house in Portland OR. She's there with our two cats and all our stuff minus a few of my clothes, my laptop, a rice cooker, and a few books.<br> <br>I'm still in St. Louis working my old job while looking for work in Portland. I'm subletting a room with a group of undergrads to save money. Our old rent wasn't worth it for me and a few boxes.<br> <br>I miss Laura and the cats. It's hard being apart when you're not sure when it will end<nobr> <wbr></nobr><tt>:/</tt> <br> <br>Laura and I drove out to PDX with our cats in the car. They'd previously only done short trips to the vet and freaked out the whole way to the vet and back. We were concerned that they might do the same all the way to PDX, but it wasn't too bad.<br> <br>Day 1:<br>Hanna immediately hid under a seat, stayed all day.<br>Puck meowed anxiously for an hour, then slept.<br> <br>Day 2:<br>Hanna hid again.<br>Puck meowed about 20min.<br> <br>Day 3:<br>Hanna hid again, but came out occasionally.<br>Puck was fine, but got bored by afternoon and wanted lots of attention until he decided to go back to sleep.<br> <br>Day 4:<br>Both cats fine, modulus a bit of afternoon boredom.<br> <br>Good luck with your drive... of course you might not read this until you get there, so maybe "good luck with having driven" (?)<br> <br>-matt
