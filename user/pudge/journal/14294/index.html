<p>Tomorrow morning's baseball game, the Seattle Mariners at the Boston Red Sox, will not be televised on Seattle television.  It is at Boston, so blackout rules don't apply; so why is it not televised?  They just, apparently, decided not to show it on television.  Maybe they thought they would not have enough viewers on a Monday morning to justify a broadcast, but in a real sports town, a fan would consider it an insult that the game was not on TV, even if said fan were unable to actually watch it.<br/><br/>What sort of sports wasteland did I move to?

Boston is a great baseball ciy. Seattle only recently got the religion in 1995. You'll find though, that actually going to games at Safeco field is a joy. Sports TV in Seattle is weird. I friend of mine was sent to Japan for a few months last year and they televised *more* games there than here. Another thing is that we love Dave Niehaus the sportscaster. He's a great radio voice so I don't miss the telecast. If you think Mariner's TV is bad, just wait until the Seahawk season starts. No sell out means no TV. Ugh. Husky football is fun and almost always on TV unless they're playing Chico state away. The Sonics are expensive. No NHL. My scorecard is this: Huskies and Mariners = A; Seahawks = C; No NHL = F; Sonics C+ or B-; Husky Women's softball = B+; Husky Men's and Women's Crew = A; Husky women's basketball = B; Washington State University Cougars Football = B-. So maybe we're a TV sports wasteland, but there's some good alternatives. It would be fun to get together with other Perl folks who like sports and catch a Mariner's game sometime.

Luckily, as part of my deal for moving out here, I acquired the rights to purchase subscriptions to NFL Sunday Ticket and NHL Center Ice, so I won't have to worry about local TV for such things.  I'll get every Patriots game, and upwards of 70 Bruins games.
