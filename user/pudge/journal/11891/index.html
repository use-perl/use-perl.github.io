<h2>Stress Testing</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ziggy/">ziggy</a> on 2003-04-28T20:34:06</h3>
Apple's done a reasonably good job in testing some of the major components of their online presence.  QuickTime movie previews are pretty well cached, the store is pretty responsive, and softwareupdate doesn't feel sluggish.
<p>
But there's a huge difference between selling a few hundred computers per day (each in the $1K-$3K range), and selling a few thousand tracks per day (for $1 each).  Doubly so when browsing to find a track requires <i>significantly</i> more mouse clicks to eval/purchase.
</p><p>
Somehow, I think Apple will have a very rough launch, but in a few weeks or months, it'll be one of the biggest storefronts on the web.  They might even run a success story on it.  (Look at how these shiny XServes handle the load...)</p>

I wasn't even buying anything (I know they still need to run the number and all).  I was just registering with the service with an existing account.  They already had my card number, I didn't even need to give it to them (as I had input it for other 1-click services for Apple).

The problem isn't only with registration.  There are massive problems even <i>browsing</i>.  In the browse window, I was able to see a handful of artists for a specific genre, but I never got a list of albums to come up.  Browsing the wizzy interface had some problems; most of the front pages per genre would come up, but anything more complicated (like scrolling through the CD covers) wouldn't return anything.
<p>
And it's not like it's transmitting a lot of data.  I'm running netmonitor, and there was virtually no traffic when I was trying to <i>browse</i> the damned service.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-S</p>

Yes, but that doesn't adequately explain 16 times connecting to my bank to verify my credit card number, or whatever they were doing.<br> <br>I think these problems are why Apple has taken iTunes 4 offline.  You can't download it anymore.

Yep, a rather extreme example of a "rough spot".<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)
<p>
Look on the bright side -- now you have a legitimate reason to complain and make a fuss until they give you the two dozen tracks you so rightly deserve.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>
