<p>Sometimes I just can't work.  It's like in that discussion on gnat journal where we discussed how to start writing.  The problem is not exclusive to writing for me, but to most things.  I have a lot I need to do, but can't get myself to do it.
As with writing, the key is to pick <I>something</I> and just do it.

The other weird motivation thing I've found is that often I freak out the most about the least difficult thing.  It'll blow up into a horrendous nightmare in my head and I'll be paralyzed every time I think about tackling it.  But when I do it, it turns out to be dead simple.<p>

Most recent case: calculating the royalty split for Programming PHP.  I thought I'd spend days comparing lines and finding files.  I wrote countless utilities and programs out of avoidance.  When it finally came to do-or-die time, I did it in 15 minutes by looking at the book and going "oh, I wrote that.  Oh, that chapter is all Rasmus." etc.  I checked a few times against the files, but it wasn't rocket science or giving birth.</p><p>
