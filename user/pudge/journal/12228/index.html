<p>I have a bunch of cassette tapes I'd like in my digital music collection; I need a way to streamline the process.  I'll need to record them to AIFF, chop them into smaller songs, then convert them to MP3 and tag them.  The slowest parts are chopping and tagging.  I may be able to use a script freeside wrote (in the MP3::Info distribution) to tag some of the albums using the CDDB database.  But I don't know what I am going to do about chopping the songs up.  I guess get a sound editor and do it by hand.

For my own stuff, yeah.  For everything else, not so much.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br> <br>I found some of my old recordings<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... I used to be a much better musician in college than I am now.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

<h2>Legal question</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/djberg96/">djberg96</a> on 2003-05-16T00:35:57</h3>
I realize that YANAL, but if I bought a cassette tape many years ago, can I then legally download those mp3/ogg files since I've already purchased the music once?

The only reasonable argument I see that could be made against it is that, in theory, CDs are better sound quality than cassettes.  But most people would download for the conveience, not the sound quality.  Either way, I don't think you're the kind of people (in doing such a thing) that the RIAA would bother coming after.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

Ugh, it only works with Griffin audio devices.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-(  I was hoping to just go line in to the PowerBook.  Then again, the iMic is just $35 and provides better audio input than the built-in line in.  Perhaps a small price to pay to get better recordings, plus the ease of use of the software.
