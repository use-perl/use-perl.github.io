<p>OK, I've <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/pudge/journal/29967">uploaded Mac-Carbon-0.75</a> to the CPAN.  Go play with it, if you have an Intel Mac.  Let me know if you find anything wrong, and let me know soon, since I have less than a week left with this Intel Mac.<br/><br/>A new Mac::Glue release is following.  It is currently broken on Intel, too.

My PicTransfer app [*] uses Mac::Glue, and it's working perfectly as a Rosetta app right now, but I wonder if it'll get a speedup as a Universal binary. It's probably entirely I/O bound, so I doubt it. Anyway if you post another blog entry (or let me know) when you're done I'll try it when Mac::Glue comes out.<br><br>[*] Used for transferring pics off removable media and launching an app (Capture One LE) when it's done. Let me know if you want a copy.

Rosetta?  How'd you get that to work?  I've never bothered trying, but when I run Mac::Carbon and Mac::Glue, they run in normal Mac space, not Rosetta space, and they don't work properly.<br><br>Anyway, Mac::Glue is now uploaded!  Let me know how it works for you.<br>

Maybe I'm not testing any of the corner cases and it's just running in normal "mac" space and just working. I'm running as part of a<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.app (camelbones) if that makes any difference...<br><br>Anyhow, I'll get around to testing the new Mac::Glue probably tomorrow.

In my experience, pretty much everything about Mac::Glue fails under Intel.  But maybe wrapping it in a CamelBones app makes a difference, I don't know.  Does CamelBones include the complete PPC perl interpreter and libraries and so on<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... ?<br>

Ah right!<br><br>We did something like this for MacPerl, to distrbute apps.  Called it<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... RuntimeBuilder.  You may want to <a href="http://www.macperl.com/depts/Code/Tools/RuntimeBuilder/RuntimeBuilder.pl" title="macperl.com">borrow some of the code</a macperl.com>, which can help you identify which files you need to copy (not that it's hard, but it can be tedious).  Most of the code there is actually saving the code inside the MacPerl droplet, so it may not be of much use.  Plus, the paths are the Mac, not POSIX paths.  So maybe it won't be of much use.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br>
