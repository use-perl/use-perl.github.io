It's just a design difference. useperl actually has no room on the lefthand side.  We'll be cleaning up the horizontal bar though, sometime soon.

OK, now explain "have to."<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br><br>The way it works is that if the comment is a reply and has the same subject line, then we just use "Re:" in "abbreviated"/"oneline" mode, to reduce clutter and take up less space.

I don't understand.  They are indented because they are children.  If they were immediately below instead of indented, they would look like children of a common parent, instead of children of each other.

<h2>More info on quote tag?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/DAxelrod/">DAxelrod</a> on 2006-11-22T21:32:26</h3>
<p>The quote button indeed rules. Quite a lot. Thank you!</p>

<p>I noticed quoting is done by by wrapping a <code>&lt;quote&gt;</code> tag around quoted text. Is this tag new? Is it documented somewhere?</p>

<p>HTML's <code>&lt;q&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code> have a <code>cite</code> attribute for indicating the source of a quotation. Is anything like that supported for <code>&lt;quote&gt;</code>? If so, is there any possibility of having the quote button automatically add attribution?</p>

<tt>quote</tt> is a new "tag" we made up, like <tt>ecode</tt>.  We are tossing around ideas for attribution; co-opting the <tt>cite</tt> attribute is a good idea, thanks.

<div class="quote">We are tossing around ideas for attribution</div> <p>An idea I just had is that you might use the cid (or whatever the post number is, the post I'm quoting is 51856) as the value of the cite attribute.</p>
<p>A common use-case for me on Slashdot is seeing a reply buried 5 levels down quoting something and responding to it, but none of its parents are displayed; so I have to use the "Parent" links to traverse up the thread until I find the quote. It would be stellar if I had some way of going directly to the quoted post. (Of course, this still doesn't handle the UI issue of how you display that info...)</p>

I was thinking of merging the user and CID, but<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... why CID knows UID.<br><br>The question is, though, how to catch that information and use it.  I have some ideas, and it's not hard, but then when we come back with nested quotes, it becomes kinda hard.  See here, I clicked Quote, and it took the &lt;div class="quote"&gt; around your quote of my comment, and turned it back into &lt;quote&gt;, because, we don't want to leave it as &lt;div class="quote"&gt; for two major reasons: it's ugly to look at when you are editing your reply, and we don't want to allow you to use the class attribute!<br><br>So that means we also need a way to turn &lt;div class="quote"&gt;, with attribution (however that is formed), back into &lt;quote cite="$cid"&gt;.  Not impossible or anything, of course.  Maybe co-opt some DIV attribute.  Maybe "title" or "id".  It might be hard to make ID reliably unique, so TITLE might be better: we just need to make sure the value also makes sense as an ACTUAL title.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)  Or it could be an HTML comment immediately following the DIV.<br><br>Anyway, you get the point, I think.  Needs some thought for how to make it work right.

Interesting. I had always assumed that Slash stored the original representation of whatever a user entered so that editing was possible, and rendered that as "output" HTML when dispaying a page (and possibly cached the rendered version).<br><br>I'm really impressed that you're able to roundtrip everything with the quote button, if my assumption was incorrect.

<p>That&#8217;s not how it works. The only valid values for the <code>cite</code> attribute are URIs.</p>

One other feature I'd really like to see here is for the Subject field to be pre-filled with "Re: ORIGINAL SUBJECT", like in e-mail clients.

<div class="quote">One other feature I'd really like to see here is for the Subject field to be pre-filled with "Re: ORIGINAL SUBJECT", like in e-mail clients.</div>It is.  It's only not prefilled if you are replying to the story/journal/etc., because then almost every comment would have the same subject as the story title.  We don't want that, so if you respond to the story itself, you have to add your own subject.  But if you reply to another comment (as I am doing here), then it is prefilled (as it was here).

Ok. That doesn't make sense to me.<br><br>Why wouldn't you want the same subject? That's the current context in which you write the reply. If the conversation changes to something else, then you change the subject.<br><br>But never mind, if you already think of it as a feature I doubt I'll change your mind.

<p>It makes more sense on Slashdot, where there are often hundreds of comments on a single story. On use.perl, I don&#8217;t see the point.</p>
