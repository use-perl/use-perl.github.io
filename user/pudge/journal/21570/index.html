<p>Some people think the Red Sox winning the World Series is a sign Kerry will become President.  Those people are on drugs.  It's not like we haven't had a Democratic President from MA in the last 86 years.<br/><br/>However, what we've never had is an incumbent win when the Redskins <a href="http://snopes.com/sports/football/election.asp">lose their last home game</a> before the election, which is scheduled for this Sunday at 1 p.m. ET, versus Green Bay.  If they win, Bush wins.  If they lose, Kerry wins.  Or so the story goes.<br/><br/>So, what are the chances the Redskins win?<br/><br/>The Redskins have not won consecutive games since September 2003, when they beat the New England Patriots.  The New England Patriots have not lost any games since, rattling off an NFL record 21 in a row.  The Redskins are the only team to not win consecutive games during that streak.  Talk about a curse.<br/><br/>If the Redskins win, does it mean the Pats lose to the Steelers at 4 p.m., thus making Bush the victor?  Or do the Pats have to lose first to enable the Redskins to win consecutive games, meaning the Redskins cannot possibly win on Sunday, since their game is earlier, meaning the election is already over and Kerry has won?
