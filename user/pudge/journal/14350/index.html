I usually agree with Raymond, both politically and philosophically. However, his desperation to remain in the limelight, combined with his jerking knee, have caused more damage to the free software community over the last 48 hours than any attack on SCO could have done.
<p>
No independent confirmation has been made that SCO's recent network outage was actually due to an attack, it is still merely "alleged". Based on comments posted to <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0120124/" title="weblogs.com">Groklaw</a weblogs.com>, the most likely explanation is that SCO temporarily took down their own site for a number of reasons, including further removal of any embarrassing content.
</p><p>
Raymond needs to go back to his individualist roots and stop pretending to speak for an imaginary collective, as well as go back to doing what he does best, i.e., <a href="http://www.opensource.org/halloween/halloween9.html" title="opensource.org">tearing holes in SCO's case</a opensource.org>. Finally, he needs to take a page from IBM and learn when to lose the attitude and STFU.</p>

But he's important, so he must be right. I mean, we all know he's important because he's famous, and he's famous because he said he was, and he'd not lie about something like that, would he?<br> <br>Maybe I'll bring an extra pie to next year's OSCON.
