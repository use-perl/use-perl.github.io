<p>A group is <A HREF="http://www.cnn.com/2003/LAW/08/27/ten.commandments/index.html">calling for a boycott</A> of any moving company that carts the Ten Commandments off from the Alabama court house.  Not even Pontius Pilate was treated so poorly.<br/><br/>It's not like the movers are carting off human fetuses to be cloned and eaten.  It's one thing to disagree with what is going on, to think the court decision is unwise or even unconstitutional, but I can't see how it is immoral.<br/><br/>However, I ain't gonna argue.  The Alabama "Ten Commandments judge", <A HREF="http://www.cnn.com/2003/US/South/08/25/moore.bio/index.html">Roy Moore</A>, "moved to Texas where he trained as a full-contact karate fighter. He later spent several months in the Australian outback, wrangling wild cattle."<br/><br/>Not just cattle, <i>wild</i> cattle.  I'll stay out of this one.

The best thing about being "from Alabama" is the implication that if that's where I'm from, then I must be somewhere else now. And indeed I am from there, and am happily elsewhere now<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

<p>The people praying at the Alabama Supreme Court are demonstrating <i>exactly</i> why church &amp; state don't make a healthy blend: if you were a non [baptist] christian going to a trial there, as the judge sits by the words "thou shalt have no god before me" and a throng of people prostrates themselves at the front door, wouldn't that make you think that the deck were ever so slightly stacked against you? Or maybe more than slightly stacked?

</p><p>But Moore doesn't care: whether the monument stayed or went, he got what he really wanted -- notoriety. The governor's office his for the taking in the next election, and I'm sure he'll let Jerry Falwell or one of those guys be his lieutenant if they want the seat.

</p><p>Being a liberal in Alabama was, I assume, about as much fun as it would be to be a coonserative in Boston<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>

Nah, Massachusetts is not as liberal as it seems.  We have had Republican govenors there for over 10 years straight.  Massachusetts is actually very conservative.  And also very liberal.  Massachusetts citizens voted for a seat belt law, and then voted to repeal it when they realized that it meant THEY had to wear seat belts, too.  It's a strange place.<br>

The political differences between Alabama and Boston are like night and day though. I personally think Massachusetts tends to have a much healthier spectrum of views: I have to date seen as many bumper stickers saying "Howard Dean for president" as "First Iraq, Then France!". In Alabama, I gather that it's almost all the latter...

<p>In any case, politics (sort of) aside, people are <i>far</i> more expressively religious down there, not caring a whit if you have a different opinion on the matter or *shock, horror* actually don't believe in all this religion nonsense. Hence, now that I think about it, I'm going to start thinking of it as Alabamistan (or Mississippissittan<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) from now on<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>
