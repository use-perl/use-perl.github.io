I have my train tickets and hotel reservations. Everything is going according to plan...

I would bring my guitar, except that I really don't want to check it in, and you can't carry those things on.  Same deal with the drumset<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:).

I check my guitar on the plane; though, I have a nice hard case for it.  Never had a problem with it.

Maybe I'll look into getting a better case for mine.  I don't trust the case I've got right now...

That's what Martin Carthy used to say.

Is it worth it to explain the reference to me?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

Carthy is a highly respected folk musician of long standing (he came up with the chord sequence that Paul Simon used for Scarboro Fair) and was the possessor of a very lovely and much played Martin guitar that, so the story goes, got lunched by an airport baggage handling system. Yes, it was in a flight case.

Mine is a Martin, but it is eminently replacable; if the airline screws up that badly, they will just buy me a new one.  If mine were irreplacable, I wouldn't risk it, probably.<br>

It's a tough call. When you're a professional musician you <em>have</em> to travel with your instruments. And when you're a folk musician you really can't afford to book a seat for the guitar.
