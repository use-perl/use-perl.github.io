<div class="span8">
<p>I moved all my <A HREF="http://use.perl.org/user/pudge/journal/4966">MP3 serving to my Mac OS X box</A> instead of the Linux box, set up Apache::MP3, etc.  One thing I had left to figure out was how to update <A HREF="http://pudge.net/">pudge.net</A> with whatever I was listening to at the time.  I wrote a subclass for Apache::MP3 called <A HREF="http://use.perl.org/user/pudge/journal/2726">Apache::MP3::Log</A> some time ago, which would catch the request, log it on my home page, and then handle the request as normal.  But since I have my MP3s local now, I don't bother with Apache::MP3, I just use the Library in iTunes (which, despite iTunes' UI problems, is very fast and easy to use, once you get the hang of it).<br/><br/>So I went back to my old method of using a cron job.  Write an AppleScript that spits out the info I need, write a Perl script that calls the AppleScript with osascript (command-line tool), parses it out, pushes it to the web server.  Easy.  Except that osascript -- as well as some other command-line tools -- doesn't like to talk to iTunes when called from something other than the current session.  So cron, or telnet/ssh sessions, etc. can't do it.<br/><br/>I figured I would try talking to iTunes via AppleScript over the network, then.  Instead of:<br/><br/><ECODE>tell application "iTunes"</ECODE><br/><br/>I have:<br/><br/><ECODE>tell application "iTunes" of machine "eppc://127.0.0.1"</ECODE><br/><br/>That should work, but it doesn't.  It works from Mac OS 9, but not from Mac OS X.  I try everything, to no avail.  Finally, I find a <A HREF="http://www.lukemelia.com/blog/archives/2002/02/17/">"blog" entry</A> through a Google search where someone had a similar problem.  He did the same thing as me, though, except that he used <TT>eppc://user:password@127.0.0.1</TT>; I had been relying on the Keychain.  This is where the light went on: I can't use this syntax directly, because my password has an <TT>@</TT> in it.  I try that syntax, using <TT>%40</TT> in place of the <TT>@</TT>; still no love.  So I change my password to something else.  Ka-ching!  It works.  Bah!  So now I can't have a certain password?<br/><br/>This is clearly a bug in Mac OS X somewhere (I suspect the AppleScript library, or somesuch, since it does work in Mac OS 9).  Anyway, so I created a new user, set a more simple password, used <TT>eppc://pudge2@127.0.0.1</TT>, and when prompted for the password, I typed it in, and told the Keychain to save it for future use.  Finally, it works.  The cron job might still fail if I am not logged in, so the Keychain is inaccessible, but I am always logged in on this machine sitting on my desk, so no worries.<br/><br/><B>Update</B> Darnit.  The password thing is <i>not</i> working.  There's something called <TT>AEServer</TT> which handles the requests, and it keeps dying and leaving zombie processes.  Then I can't authenticate.  I think that maybe the script is trying to connect to one of the zombie <TT>AEServer</TT> processes.  Anyway, so now I've reverted to having <i>two</i> processes running; one an AppleScript application from my login session that writes the data out to a temp file every 60 seconds or so, and another the perl script from a cron job that reads that data and deals with it, instead of calling the AppleScript directly.  Stupid Mac OS X AppleScript!

<h2>characters in passwords</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jdavidb/">jdavidb</a> on 2002-05-21T01:26:33</h3>
<p>When selecting a password, I tend to sit down with a random number generator and an ASCII table.  Really.  As a result, I've occasionally had problems with interesting characters in certain situations.  I remember problems with @ and &gt;, and one great time when I couldn't seem to log into a sun machine because my password contained ~ and it was in a different spot on the keyboard.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>
