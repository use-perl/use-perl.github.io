<p>I took a train from Providence to NYC, which was quite pleasant.  I should travel that way more often.  I think I will do so.<br/><br/><P>So it took me about a half hour to find the spaker's registration room, lugging around my, erm, luggage, because it was 11 a.m. and check-in wasn't until 3 p.m.  But I found it, then went over to the OSDN meeting room (free massages available) and checked email and talked to Messrs. Lenzo and DiBona and Bates.  All much fun.  I then saw Messrs. Adler and Hand and Starsinic, and was invited to a NYC Wireless meeting later that night.  I tucked that away, and went to check-in.<br/><br/><P>The room was quite nice.  I promptly hooked up my older PowerBook to the data port on the phone and to the audio in on the VCR/DVD unit, so it could play MP3s through the TV and provide wireless three feet away to my newer PowerBook.  Mmmmm, technology abuse, call the cops!<br/><br/><P>I returned to the conference and saw fellow Slash programmer Brian Aker while waiting for a cab, so we went over and brielfy toured the event before heading on over to the Penguin Bowl (hosted by DiBona, with Lenzo as a contestant, and Mr. Malda as a judge) and then left that to go to the Perl BOF.<br/><br/><P>The Perl BOF had about 20 people (maybe a few more, as some left and more came later) and most of the discussion centered around the futures of perl 5 and perl 6.  It's nice that there's a lot of interest in these topics, though unfortunate that this is almost all anyone wants to talk about.  :-)<br/><br/><P>Today I have no real plans.  I'll go to some sessions and wander around and take more <A HREF="http://pudge.net/gallery.pl?op=list&amp;group_id=15">pictures</A> (there are a few there, but nothing too interesting).<br/><br/><BLOCKQUOTE><EM>Good morning, son.<BR>
I am a bird<BR>
Wearing a brown polyester shirt<BR>
You want a coke?<BR>
Maybe some fries?<BR>
The roast beef combo's only $9.95<BR>
It's okay, you don't have to pay<BR>
I've got all the change<br/><br/><P>Everybody knows<BR>
It hurts to grow up<BR>
And everybody does<BR>
It's so weird to be back here<BR>
Let me tell you what<BR>
The years go on and<BR>
We're still fighting it, we're still fighting it<BR>
And you're so much like me<BR>
I'm sorry</EM><br/><br/><P>--Ben Folds, <EM>Still Fighting It</EM></BLOCKQUOTE></p>
