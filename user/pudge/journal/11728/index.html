<p>I just played a guy in Tic Tac Toe online (using the free Freeverse games being offered on <A HREF="http://www.mac.com/">mac.com</A>.<br/><br/>If I get center square as the first move, I win 50% of the time on the next move if the other user picks his first square at random: a side square means I win.  Then, if he picks corner, I win 66% of the time if he picks his next square at random (it must be one of the two corners, as I select the opposite corner).  So overall, for random picking of the first two moves, I win 83% of the time, and if he picks with some reason (meaning he would pick one of the two closest sides to his first corner on his second move), it is 75%.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, this bloke I played against picked a side square in the first game, then a corner and then a side in the second.  Losing two games in a row of Tic Tac Toe must have flustered him, because in the next game he picked a corner and then another corner, but then he didn't pick to block my only winning move and I won the third game.  He picked side again in the fourth, and then finally he picked two corners <i>and</i> blocked me in the fifth.<br/><br/>All this to say it must be really humiliating to lose four games in a row of Tic Tac Toe.<br/><br/>My first Perl program was a Tic Tac Toe CGI ...
