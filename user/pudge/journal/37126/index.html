<p>Spam e-mail: "Hi there, you got a greeting!"

I want to have an argument with the sender:

<blockquote>"Yes, that is self-evident, every e-mail is a greeting, by definition."
"No, I mean another greeting."
"Oh, then you're wrong, no, I got no such thing."
"Yes, it's in the mail."
"But I didn't open it, so I didn't get it."
"So open it."
"I have no reason to."
"So you will get your greeting!"
"But the e-mail WAS a greeting."</blockquote>
... and so on.

I should write really bad sitcoms.  It's a skill.

Which brings me to: "If you are the type of person who will take a huge cut in salary to do something you love, then you really need badly to see a therapist."

Which brings me to a short film I saw on iTunes called Cutlass, written by Kate Hudson, who has been filthy rich all her life, and is about a mom who helps her daughter spend too much money on something they don't need, because, you know, it's just money!

Just sayin'.
