<p>T-Mobile is my cell phone provider.  I "upgraded" my old Nokia 6600 (four years old now, at least) to a Nokia 6263 for free.  But when I got it, I found that -- with the exact same SIM card, same account, same network -- it would not run downloaded network apps like Google Maps.<br/><br/>This makes it subuseful.<br/><br/>So I call them up, and they would apparently rather have me return my phones and cancel my service altogether than give me a working phone.  Oh they say they can give me a Blackberry, but it will cost more, and I don't want a Blackberry.  And I would rather go phoneless than use a Windows phone.<br/><br/>So I need to either get this phone uncrippled, or find a new cell phone provider.  Suggestions welcome.

I thought blackberrys ran their own OS?

No, I meant Windows was another separate option.

Ah, did you edit the text because it reads more sensibly now<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br><br>But yeah, I know what you mean. North American mobile phone providers seem to have us by the balls. Coming from the UK the situation still shocks me. I wish I were back there then I could just buy any phone I wanted and jam my SIM card in.

Literally.  A few hundred for a decent phone.<br><br>
