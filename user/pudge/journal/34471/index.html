<p>I am thinking about learning Cocoa just so I can write a Mac e-mail client that doesn't suck.<br/><br/>Eudora sucks but it is the best of the bunch, but it is buggy on Intel for me.  My Inbox keeps losing memory of labels and what's been read (even what I have already filtered out).<br/><br/>Everything else is pretty bad in various ways.  Mail is not a serious mail app.  Thunderbird isn't a Mac app at ll.  Mailsmith doesn't do IMAP and is bloated.  Google Mail isn't local.<br/><br/>Sigh.<br/><br/>Maybe I'll just give up e-mail altogether!

I had a quick look at this recently, and if anything it looks like a better starting point (being a proper Cocoa app).<br><br>I'm having similar thoughts though. How about a CamelBones mail app?

Seriously, though: what are the features that you want that wouldn't be provided by mutt, possibly with the addition of Addex?

A Mac UI.

I've been messing with it on/off for over a year now. Camelbones a bit, too. It would be interesting to see how far you could use Camelbones to create such an app. It would be great publicity for Camelbones if you could do it.<br><br>You should checkout <a href="http://homepage2.nifty.com/hoshi-takanori/cocoa-browser/" title="nifty.com">Cocoa Browser</a nifty.com> if you haven't already, it's a very useful app when dealing with trying to find the right method to call.<br><br>Personally, I find Mail.app fine for my needs. To tell you the truth, after reading your post, I'm not exactly sure I understand why or what you think it's lacking.<br>

My biggest gripe with Apple Mail is that its IMAP support sucks.  I filter my mail into numerous mailboxes, on the server.  Because of that (apparently), Apple Mail usually doesn't notice new messages.  I got in the habit of clicking through all of my folders, so that it would update its notion of what's new.  That works sometimes.  Other times, I can "synchronize" and click through and refresh to my heart's content, and it still doesn't notice new messages.  There have been times that I have done all of the above, throughout the course of a few hours, only to have a piece of mail show up as "new" several hours later -- when it's actually been there all along.<br><br>I've actually switched to using GyazMail.  It's not as feature-laden as Apple Mail (its threading support, for example, isn't nearly as powerful).  On the other hand, it's a lot snappier, and its IMAP support is rock solid.  It's well worth the minimal shareware fee, IMHO.<br><br>I do like Apple Mail's interface and features, though, and hope that Leopard will "make it right", or that something else will come along that's got the features that Apple Mail has, yet has the stability that GyazMail has.<br>
