<p>We didn't renew our vehicle registration before it expired.  So we are waiting for it to come in the mail after renewing online, but then we get email reply that says we can drive the car before it comes in the mail, as long as we print out the email and carry it in the car.<br/><br/>We have no printer, and no fax machine.<br/><br/>My wife's mother is flying in tonight, so we sent the email to her to print and bring with her on the plane.<br/><br/>Technology is really weird.

I went 10 months without a valid registion before I was caught. Stick it to the Man, Pudge-daddy!



<h2>Inspection</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jdavidb/">jdavidb</a> on 2002-07-16T13:48:26</h3>
<p>In related news I had a car inspected yesterday that had an expired inspection sticker that hadn't been good since March.  Of course, it was my grandparents' car, and my grandmother hasn't been allowed to drive it since then.  So it's only been driven twice with the expired inspection.</p>

My car has never had a valid inspection in MA. Once I finally switched the plates from NC to MA (why can't I just keep my other valid plate?), I never got it inspected until I got a warning one day. When I took it in for the inspection, it failed and I've had the scarlet "R" on my windshield ever since.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)

I had my car in MA for 3 years, never transferred the registration, underwent inspection, or paid the taxes on it. Still have my CA license. Unfortunately the Dept. of Education relies upon the DMV (I don't care if they think it's called the RMV or not) records to determine residency. So despite having paid taxes for several years, and being registered to vote, they deny me financial aid<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-/<br>

I think the difference is that you are a student while I am a "permanent resident". But that does suck about financial aid. And just who the heck came up w/ RMV anyway? Everybody else is sane &amp; calls it the DMV.

And just who exactly said I wasn't a "permanent resident"?<br>RMV, HOV, DWI... they inisit on being different for no good reason.

<br>
Well, that's what I get for assuming.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

<h2>Kinkos</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jordan/">jordan</a> on 2002-07-16T15:33:09</h3>
A lot of places, like Kinkos, have printers you can use.  They typically have some Macs around, too.<br> <p>Now that you have a little one, you'll want a good color printer, trust me.  Printing up pretty pictures, photos and stuff for their rooms is a lot of fun.  If she likes a drawing or pretty picture on the screen, she'll really be excited by having a good copy for her wall.  Maybe not for a few months, but sooner than you think. <br> </p><p>Gets 'em interested in the computer, too.</p>

I would go to a Kinko's or somesuch if I needed to.  But I'll have the printup tonight, via airplane.<br> <br>I had an Epson color printer, but it died.  I am waiting to get a new one, because I hear rumors about USB printer sharing in Mac OS X 10.2, and I want to get one that will be compatible, so my daughter can print to it directly from her own iBook (old-style iBook, but she's too young to complain<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-).
