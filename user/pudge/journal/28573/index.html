<p>Last year I picked the exact score of the Super Bowl.<br/><br/>Stop your genuflecting.<br/><br/>I had the advantage of knowing the Patriots team extremely well.  This year, well, not so much.  I know the Steelers pretty well, though not nearly as well as I know the Pats, and despite living in the Seattle region, I don't know the Seahawks well at all.<br/><br/>But there are a few things I know.  I know the Steelers have a slightly better passing game.  I know the Seahawks have the decided edge in running.  I know I fear the Steelers defense more, but on the other hand, they tend to give up some big plays.<br/><br/>Big Ben is prone to some error, but on the other hand, he's only lost to three teams, and two of those he ended up coming back to beat in the playoffs, the Colts and Bengals.  (He remains 0-2 against the Pats.)<br/><br/>In the end, I think the Seahawks won't be able to contain the many Steelers weapons.  So I am picking the Steelers to win, 28 to 24.<br/><br/>

There was a Super Bowl last year?  Funny.  I don't remember any of the commercials.  Or nipples.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)

No silly, the nipples were the year before!

Right.  So what happened last year?  Did they even have a game?  More importantly, is there even a super bowl this year?  I heard it got cancelled because of poor ratings or something.

<h2>Super Bowl Predictions</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/kjones4/">kjones4</a> on 2006-02-04T08:17:29</h3>
My Super Bowl prediction is 28 - 17 Seahawks. I tend to give the Seattle offense an advantage in both passing and rushing, while giving the Steelers a little bit of advantage on defense. The Seahawks defense was much better at the end of the season than early on. Hasselbeck is in a nice zone of accuracy and finding any of his receivers. Any one receiver might not match up with Pittsburgh, but I'll take the Seattle's receiver combo + tight ends any day. It should be a good game.

I predict that even though they won't be allowed on the field, "Da Bears" will win forty-tree ta zip.
