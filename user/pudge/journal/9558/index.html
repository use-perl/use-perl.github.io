<p>He is back for a three-episode stint of a new show that finishes up tonight on Comedy Central, after The Daily Show.  It's the best part of his short-lived show from earlier this year on NBC: a diverse bunch of comics sitting around making fun of various religions, ethnicities, etc. ... you know, the stuff we are afraid to laugh at, but IMO (and theirs) should be laughing at a lot more.  Very good stuff.  I hope they pick it up for a regular show following TDS every night.

I've seen two eps of the show. It's painful in the extreme to watch. I find the humor simply hurtful instead of insightful. However, I do understand that the show is at least trying to address the damage done by politically correct movement of the eighties (which did more to exacerbate racism and sexism than the Klan), so I'll give Colin props for that.

<p>Woop. Woop.</p>

I didn't find it insightful.  I didn't see it as hurtful in any way.  The whole point is that if we can learn to laugh at ourselves and each other without being offended, then we won't hate each other so much, we will be comfortable around each other more, we will stop trying to kill and hurt people because of their ethnicity/religion/politics/etc.  It's not about being politically incorrect -- that's been done -- it's about bringing different people together.

I caught a little bit of the first show and my immediate take on it was, "a rougher Politically Incorrect".<br> <br>I didn't pay enough attention to get a feel for how it might do but I really do enjoy extremely non-PC humor. I agree with Pudge that if we can't laugh at ourselves and others then life is much more dreary.<br> <br>Then again what do I know? I'm just honkey, white devil hick from BFE Montana living in redneck Indiana.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

<p>Laughter requires something funny to laugh at. In the two episodes I saw, very uncomfortable racial jabs and forced laughter were in evidence, but very little love. This is akin to the recent Fryer's roast of Chevy Chase, in which Chevy was <em>clearly</em> not amused and the roasters clearly didn't care for him. Examples of a roasts done with love and respect are those of Jerry Stiller and Rob Reiner. Race is a far bigger issue in American life that it merits. I do think that skillful humor can build some much needed bridges. Colin Quinn's hasn't done that yet.
</p><p>On the other hand, it is just a freakin' talk show.</p>

<i>This is akin to the recent Fryer's roast of Chevy Chase, in which Chevy was clearly not amused and the roasters clearly didn't care for him.</i> <br> <br>Didn't catch Chevy's roast maybe I should, it would be like watching a car wreck.<br> <br> <i>Race is a far bigger issue in American life that it merits.</i> <br> <br>Testify, brother. The whole Trent Lott thing is testament to that, not to say he was right or wrong just that American's view of race, segregation, and entitlement are easily exploitable and woefully underdeveloped.<br> <br> <i>On the other hand, it is just a freakin' talk show. </i> <br> <br>Too bad more Americans don't see them that way...
