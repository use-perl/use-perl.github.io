<p>In the Lion King special edition DVD, in the audio set up menu, it has some text talking about "discreet 5.1 audio."<br/><br/>Maybe that's for systems in soundproof rooms?

Last week my son showed me a message to a mailing list that I'd made in 1991.  He'd found it in class when they were given an assignment to search for themselves on the Internet.  My<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.signature line at the time was a quote from him at age 2 1/2; and at that time I would have deemed it likely that someone would have archived the list, but as highly unlikely that Jordan would ever see on his own without my having shown it to him.</p>
