<p>Last night's problem was solved by adding "-lstdc++" to the linker flags.  Thanks, Matthias!<br/><br/>So today, I get it working, and I try a simple script:<br/><br/><ECODE>
use Mac::AppleEvents;
$evt = AEBuildAppleEvent(qw(misc actv sign MACS), -1, 0, "");
AESend($evt, kAENoReply);
</ECODE><br/><br/>And sure enough, it activates the Finder.  This is the equivalent of the AppleScript:<br/><br/><ECODE>
tell app "Finder" to activate
</ECODE><br/><br/>Sweet.  I've even tried some more complex things, opening a directory in the Finder, using the Mac::AppleEvents::Simple frontend:<br/><br/><ECODE>
use Mac::AppleEvents::Simple ':all';<br/><br/>$evt = build_event(qw(aevt odoc MACS), 
	q{'----':obj { want:type(cobj), from:null(), form:enum(name), seld:TEXT(@)}}
	"Orr:Users:pudge:"  # yes, AEGizmos requires HFS paths
);
$evt->send_event(kAENoReply);
</ECODE><br/><br/>Or, using aliases:<br/><br/><ECODE>
use Mac::AppleEvents::Simple ':all';
use Mac::Files;<br/><br/>$evt = build_event(qw(aevt odoc MACS), q{'----':alis(@@)}, NewAlias("/Users/pudge/")); $evt->send_event(kAENoReply)'
</ECODE><br/><br/>All looks good so far.  But, you may ask, why kAENoReply?  Sure, I don't need the reply, but why bother not waiting, as per the default?  There's the big remaining problem: I can't receive a reply.  I have an idle proc that appears to be working -- as is needed to receive a reply -- but it's not getting the event back.  I was afraid of this.  In Mac OS, you need to set a flag that says your application can receive high-level events (such as Apple events).  But how to do this for perl?  No idea.  Working on a solution, but in the meantime, polishing and playing.<br/><br/>I also still need to port the AESubDescs (for subdescriptors) and AEStreams (an OO interface to handling Apple event data) stuff, but they are rarely used, and are a lower priority than just getting this to work.  I'll be more than happy to add them back in later, if I can.

<h2>linking with -lstdc++</h2>

actually, you should probably be linking with g++, rather than gcc, if it's a program that has some c++ in it.  that way g++ can take care of linking with whatever 'extra' libs c++ requires, and you won't have to worry about it.

Why does it matter?  I am ignorant in such matters.  If there's nothing wrong with the approach I am using now, I am not too keen on trying something different.  If it ain't broke, and all that.<br>

it doesn't especially matter at the moment, but it insulates you from issues down the road if the gcc people decide to change the library you need for c++, or require an another lib or something.  a lot of programs used to work fine under older versions of gcc even though they were linking with gcc instead of g++, but with more current versions of the compiler they refuse to link.  if they had done the right thing (link a c++ program with the right tool for it, the c++ compiler/linker), then they wouldn't have had the problem.

Hm.  Well, then I would need to find out how to tell the Makefile to link using g++, in the Makefile.PL.
