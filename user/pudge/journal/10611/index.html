You neglected to mention that these particular missiles are in breach because they go <i>six miles</i> beyond the prescribed limit, and that's only because they don't have a guidance system.  Is a 6 mile discrepancy sufficient in your mind to start a war?

1. I don't know if you imply this or not, but their existence is a breach, with or without a guidance system.  Hans Blix was clear on this.<br> <br>2. You apparently did not read what I wrote.  Read the second paragraph again.  Here it is: "Again: inspections are for the purpose of disarmament. They are not working; they will not work. Disarmament of Iraq is a requirement, not an option. Because inspections are not working, and will not work, we need another way to disarm Iraq."<br> <br>I did not say anything about war there, and, in fact, said, "And I would love to hear ideas for disarmament that do not amount to war."<br>

Six miles?  Where did you get your information?<br>The estimate is currently 24 miles.  My source is <a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story2&amp;cid=68&amp;ncid=68&amp;e=17&amp;u=/nyt/20030213/ts_nyt/experts_confirm_new_iraq_missile_exceeds_u_n__limit" title="yahoo.com">Hans Blix</a yahoo.com>.  Here's the relevant extract from the article:<br> <blockquote><div>Mr. Blix has already told the Council that the missiles, with a range of about 180 kilometers, or 114 miles, appeared to be a "prima facie" case of a violation by Iraq of the range limit of 150 kilometers, or about 90 miles, established by the Council. The missiles have already been given to the Iraqi armed forces, he said. The panel did not reach a conclusion about a second missile, Al Fatah (news - web sites), but said it required further study. </div></blockquote> <br> <p>Note the Al Fatah missile requires further study, but is believed to have even greater range.<br> </p><p>This is no clerical error or simple mistake on the part of the Iraqis.  Iraq has developed, and intends to develop further, missiles that violate their previous commitments.<br> </p><p>This is exactly what inspections are there to prove, one way or the other.  They have proven it, as far as I'm concerned.  Also, Blix has repeatedly stated that Iraq is not cooperating as is required under Resolution 1441.<br> </p><p>What is your criteria for complying?  Why should we give Saddam Hussein any benefit of any doubt?</p>

<em>This is no clerical error or simple mistake on the part of the Iraqis. Iraq has developed, and intends to develop further, missiles that violate their previous commitments.<br> <br>This is exactly what inspections are there to prove, one way or the other.</em> <br> <br>No, no, no.  The inspections are not to prove anything.  They are there to disarm Iraq, to verify Iraq's statements, to destroy the weapons.  They are there to give Iraq the opportunity to prove they have disarmed, not to themselves prove Iraq has disarmed (or not).<br> <br>This is the problem most people have when they say they want inspections to continue.  We have found weapons, gotten rid of weapons; we can find more, get rid of more, right?  No.  If the inspections are not successful, after 12 years of trying, why do we think they ever could be successful?  A little success here or there is irrelevant.  If Iraq is holding back information -- which they indisputably are -- if Iraq is blocking the destruction of prohibited weapons -- which they indisputably are -- then inspections are not working, as defined in Resolution 687.<br> <br>There is no greay area.  Either Iraq is cooperating fully, or inspections are failing, and the UN must, by its own words, take further steps to effect disarmament.  And once again, I am not saying that next step must be war.  I am saying inspections have proven beyond reasonable doubt to be a failure, and that something else must be done to effect disarmament; I pray that something else is NOT war.<br> <br>I don't want to hear anything about the this stuff except for how to effect disarmament; if someone wants to say inspections can do that, I don't want to hear it unless there's some actual evidence they can do that, some evidence that Iraq is going to completely change their tactics over the last 12 years, something they have not yet done and something they show no signs of doing (as evidenced by the recent refusal to destroy clearly prohibited weapons).<br> <br>waltman appears to think I was using this latest incident as evidence we need to go to war with Iraq, that they are in breach.  No.  I was using it as evidence that Iraq continues to defy UN Resolutions 687 and 1441, that inspections have bneen a failure and that because Iraq is still not cooperating, they will inevitably continue to fail.  Only complete cooperation from Iraq can make inspections work.  This is the point.<br>

<blockquote><div> <i>Six miles? Where did you get your information?</i> </div></blockquote>
<p>
The second paragraph in the article pudge linked:
</p><p><blockquote><div> <i> Aziz said the missiles exceeded the range by less than six miles and only because they lacked guidance systems. He said they do not pose a threat that would warrant their destruction. </i> </div></blockquote>
<p>
A 6 mile discrepancy strikes me as more of a technicality than a cause for war.  Frankly, so does 24 miles.
</p><p>
There may well be good reasons we're on the brink of war with Iraq.  For instance, I'm as interested as the next guy in learning what happened to all those chemical and biological weapons we sold Saddam back in the 1980's.  But the discovery of these missiles is hardly a smoking gun.</p>

<h3><a href="/user/pudge/">pudge</a> on 2003-02-16T16:47:00</h3>
waltman, and I agree with you.  It is not a smoking gun.  It is not cause for war.  It is one thing: proof that Iraq continues -- after 12 years -- to not comply with Resolution 687.  That's all Resolution 1441 is for, to give Iraq one more chance to prove inspections can work to disarm Iraq.  They have proven that inspections are NOT working to disarm Iraq, and this is just the most recent evidence of that.<br> <br>Blix speaks again on February 28.  Unless he says "inspections are now working to disarm Iraq; Iraq is actively working to give us all the information we require, and is working to destroy all prohibited weapons," the UK and US will provide a new resolution to the Security Council declaring inspections a failure.<br> <br>Even Secy. General Kofi Annan has said a new resolution is probably necessary, because inspections are failing, and there is little chance they can succeed.<br> <br>There are now 34 nations that are saying inspections have failed.  The Portugese ambassador chastised the German Foreign Minister for grandstanding about "lack of evidence," and told him that he was not offering any alternatives to what they all recognize as failure (inspections) and the last resort (war).<br> <br>Two weeks.  That's how much time Iraq has to destroy its weapons, to provide all its information, to prove that inspections can work.<br> <br>It is not about these weapons being proof Iraq is a threat, it is about them being proof that inspections are not working to effect disarmament.<br>

<h2>Why not continue the inspections?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/mudchuck/">mudchuck</a> on 2003-02-16T06:15:08</h3>
<p>I have been repelled by Saddam Hussein and his regime for over twenty years, ever since he invaded Iran. I was appalled when the Reagan administration improved relations with Iraq and even began providing military aid in spite of knowledge that it was using chemical weapons. And I really think that the world would be a better place if Iraq were disarmed.

</p><p>But I have to say that the present Bush administration scares me much much more than Iraq does. Perhaps there is some justification to going to war against Iraq, but currently Iraq is very far down on the list of threats to world peace. Clearly the US government is using any piece of disinformation it can dream up to promote this war. For example, Powell raised the specter of Iraq's mobile biowarfare labs. Well, if Iraq can produce effective biological weapons in mobile laboratories, their technology has advanced far past anything even the US is known to be capable of.

</p><p>It's obvious that the inspections are a major irritant to Hussein. If the speech by Powell showed anything, it showed how effective the inspections are so far. Previous inspections went a long way to disarming Iraq, so I just can't see any justification for not continuing the inspections as long as possible to see how much can be accomplished. For Bush to say that he's "losing patience" or warning Hussein that "the game is up" is an awfully childish way to approach this problem.

</p><p>So why does the administration want to fight a war so much? It's clear that they hope to use their power to reshape the globe in any way they please. This may be seen in such documents as Building the Bridge to a More Peaceful Future, Rebuilding America's Defenses, and the National Security Strategy.

<a href="http://www.commondreams.org/views02/1211-05.htm" title="commondreams.org">A short summary of these documents is here.</a commondreams.org>

</p><p>So what would the benefits be of a quick, easy victory by the US in an all-out war against Iraq? We would have a place to permanently station troops to dominate the Persian Gulf region. We could dismantle the bases in Saudi Arabia, and thus deprive Islamic extremists of the excuse that we're occupying their holy land to justify terrorist attacks against the US. We could even apply more pressure against the monarchy in Saudi Arabia to become more democratic and become a true force for moderation in the Islamic world. Wouldn't it be lovely if all this went as planned?

</p><p>The only trouble with this is the chances of everything going right are very low. If the war doesn't go as smoothly as hoped, if the Iraqi people suffer enormous damage from the war, and if the US effort to rebuild the country is as lackluster as the current one to rebuild Afghanistan, Iraq may well turn into the most fertile ground for producing terrorists we have yet seen. Further, the more the US attempts to use its increasingly preeminent position in the world to suit its own ends, the more Russia and China will view the US as a threat, and the farther we will slide back into a new cold war. We may even find certain countries in Western Europe winding up on the other side.

</p><p>I just hope the US has a little more to offer the world than its tremendous capacity to destroy.</p>

<em> Aziz said destruction of the missiles "would be unacceptable" not that they would never be destroyed under any circumstances.

This was just offered as more evidence of this, not <em>the</em> evidence.  More to the point, Iraq must itself show evidence that inspections <em>can</em> work, and this situation is counterevidence of that.<br> <br>Second: saying it is unacceptable for those weapons to be destroyed, blocking their destruction, even if in the end they will be destroyed, is in itself a breach of Resolution 687.  Of course, their very existence is a breach under Resolution 687, but we are looking for current evidence that inspections can effect disarmament, and, again, they are providing counterevidence of that.<br>

Among the European countries, there is exactly one that has taken a more radical position: This is Germany (my country, sigh). All those others that currently seem to object (France, Russia perhaps) wont eventually keep up this standpoint. It is only tactical and doesn't have to do anything at all with a fundamental dislike of such a war.<br> <br> <i>I just hope the US has a little more to offer the world than its tremendous capacity to destroy. </i> <br> <br>I wish the rest of the world had a little more to offer than its tremendous capacity of talking.

Sometimes the only solution is hard to stand...but so are non-solutions.

<h3><a href="/user/malte/">malte</a> on 2003-02-16T16:54:48</h3>
<p>Stop the fear.</p>

<p>Turn off Fox News and chill. I'm not afraid of Iraq and I dont feel that the United States is entitled to judge any other country in terms of disarmament as long as it's "death through firearms" rate is over 100 times as high as in most other developed countries. If you took away the guns you could drop a nuke on a small city every year and still have more people living than with the current situation.</p>

<p>The whole notion of Preemptive War is wrong. Secretary Rumsfeld says "Who would have helped us if we had invaded Afganistan prior to 911 to prevent the terrorists attacks on New York...None". He uses this to make his point on attacking Iraq. But the logic is flawed. Bad things happen, but doing bad things to prevent other bad things, is not justified. Preemptive action lies in Gods hands (if there is one) but certainly not in Mr. Bush's. (Hint to Mr. Bush: god like rhetoric does not turn you into a god.)</p>

<p>
You want an option to war: Make an exit plan for Saddam. Take away his power but let him keep his title (It worked with the Queen of England). Whatever you do, don't let him look bad. Let him keep his honor and he will be your friend. Maybe he doesnt deserve such treatment, but if it saves some lifes, that price seems quite low.

The problem with this conversation is you state, as fact "weapons inspections aren't working."  That skews the entire conversation.  The weapons inspections are working according to Blix and El Baradei who are actually running the inspections.  They aren't working perfectly, but they are working, and they've made considerable progress in 11 weeks.  They've collected so much data haven't processed all of it yet.<br> <br>And according to Scott Ritter, who was the chief inspector for UNSCOM from 1991-1998 inspections were working then as well. He certainly complained  bitterly about lack of cooperation, but estimated that 90-95% of Iraq's weapons, and weapon making potential had been destoryed.<br> <br>So given considerable international support for the idea that weapons inspections are working, and given the support of the people doing the work, the burden, it would seen, is on those calling for a policy change to justify it.<br> <br>But I'll suggest an alternative anyway.  Not one I've spent a lot of time working on, but at least as well thought out as our current invasion plans.<br> <br>How about lifting the deadly sanctions the US has been keeping in place for the last 12 years, they haven't worked, and sanctions sure haven't worked with Cuba.<br> <br>And then flood the area with UN peacekeepers, and UN relief workers.  And make a big deal of the fact that none of those peacekeepers are US spies (which was one of Iraq's provable complaints during the first round of inspections), or US soliders.  And stop sending Saddam the message that we only want peace over his dead body (as Bush the First, and Clinton both did)<br> <br>Iraq was in many ways a nice, modern 1st world country in the 80s when they were our favorite Middle Eastern tool.  I think given the chance to regain that quality of life, and given some real hope, you would have a real, popular uprising (perhaps violent, perhaps not) of the Shiite majority, and the significant Kurd minority against the Sunni population who currently run the country.  Just a thought.

<em>The weapons inspections are working according to Blix and El Baradei who are actually running the inspections.</em> <br> <br>That is false.  Inspections require unconditional and complete cooperation.  This is absolutely clear from the UN resolutions.  Please read them.  If there is not complete cooperation, inspections are definitionally not working.  There is no grey area.  It is a delightful fancy, but it is not reality.<br> <br>Nation after nation recognizes that inspections are not working.  France and Germany are basically the only significant holdouts.<br> <br>Even Kofi Annan, just last week, said that the UN must take additional action to disarm Iraq, that a new resolution is probably going to be necessary.  He would not have said this if inspections were working.  The only reason we would need another resolution is if the current resolutions -- which define the nature of the inspections regime -- are not working.<br> <br>As to your alternative: it says nothing about disarmament.

Is that a serious statement and question?  It doesn't appear to be.<br> <br>It is not the US that is requiring Iraqi disarmament.  It is the UN Security Council, with about a dozen or more resolutions over the past 12 years, affirming over and again that Iraq is a threat that must be disarmed.  France has repeatedly agreed to this, as has Russia, as has Germany, as has Syria, as has every other nation that has been on the Security Council (except for the new ones which have not yet had the pleasure).<br> <br>Also, Iraq has agreed to this.  Resolution 687 of 1991, which ended the Gulf War, was a cease-fire resolution that Iraq agreed to unconditionally, which first defined the prohibitions for NBC weapons and missles that are capable of exceeding a 150km range.<br> <br>It is not about believing we are better.  It is about Iraq starting, and losing, a war with the United Nations forces; it is about Iraq, and everyone else, agreeing that Iraq must be disarmed of these weapons; it is about the UN Security Council working to fulfill its stated obligation to disarm Iraq through other means if inspections fail.<br> <br>Feel free to whine about "disarmament" of other countries and who feels superior over whom, but without addressing the actual issues, you just make your opinions appear quite immature and entirely irrelevant.

Let me make it clear that I don't agree with Bart in his comment. However I think that the way you are stressing the fact that the UN Security Council is saying things is not as simple as you make it sound.<br> <br>You are clearly forgetting that some powerful nations (USA *and* others) are using their influence on other countries to push certain decisions. That's common knowledge. Like 'Hey France, it looks like you're going to vote against this resolution, but don't you think it will be rather inconvenient if we would increase the import taxes on French wines as of tomorrow. Hmm? Riiight...So you were going to vote in favour of our proposal, weren't you?'.<br> <br>Of course, these kinds of things happen all the time, and they don't always work, but a resolution of the UN Security Council does not always represent 'the view of the World'. I think it's pretty clear that the USA and the UK are currently one of the very few who think the inspections are not working. Why else would the NATO and the UN be so devided on this isssue.<br> <br>My personal view on the whole thing is very simple: Father Bush should have finished the job when he had the chance during the Gulf War. For some strange reason he didn't have the guts to move to Bagdad and chase Saddam away once and for all. And this has resulted in the current situation. The Gulf War was the time to decide the matter, now is not the time. If the UN, NATO and whatever country is *so concerned* about the weapons in Iraq, why don't they threaten North Korea with the same as they do with Iraq? But Collin Powell clearly stated that there was absolutely no intent to start a war there...<br> <br>I know, I don't have a solution, I don't have an answer to your original question. Maybe some small and swift commando should go into Iraq and assasinate Saddam. Maybe that will do the job.<br> <br>Just my &#8364; 0.02<br>

I am not saying there are not a lot more to these things than meets the eye (in fact, I have been trying to let people know that far more is happening than any of us could possibly know).<br> <br>However, two things are clear: first, you own your vote.  If you vote a certain way, then you have in fact supported what you have voted for.<br> <br>Second, there have been many resolutions over the past 12 years reaffirming Resolution 687.  It wasn't a one-off deal.  France has, dozens of times, reaffirmed its original agreement to its terms.  There must be something to be said for repeated affirmation of something, even if you are not sure they meant it on a particular occasion or two.<br> <br>As to what George HW Bush should have done: I think most people would agree that the US should have taken out Hussein, but it was not his decision alone to make, any more than it his George W Bush's decision alone to make now.  The United Nations decided it didn't want such a breach of Iraq's sovereignty unless it were necessary, and they thought they could disarm Iraq without force.  They were wrong.<br> <br>And while YOU think that if we were going to forcibly disarm Iraq it had to happen 12 years ago, the UN Security Council has, again, repeatedly affirmed that this is not the case, that inspections are the chosen method of disarmament, but that further steps WILL be taken should inspections fail.  I think the worst thing you can say about this is that the UN has taken too long to admit inspections have failed and that they need to move on to something else.<br> <br>I don't think it is really possible to overstate the case for "What the UN says, the UN should do."  The world is becoming a much more dangerous place, and if the UN is not willing to follow through on its committments -- as it has committed to disarm Iraq -- it, in a real sense, becomes irrelevant.  The question was raised, "if it is the UN that agreed to this with Iraq, why should the US act outside of UN consensus?"  That can be answered, in part, by asking, "If the UN is unwilling to enforce its own resolutions, why should the US not come up with its own separate cease-fire agreement the next time it is militarily engaged on the UN's behalf?"  Apart from the obvious -- that countries like Iraq will not cooperate if they believe they can get away with it -- it is also true that the UN cannot be a place for countries like France, Russia, China, the UK, and the US to come together for agreement if the UN is unwilling to enforce those agreements.  The next time, the US will come to a separate cease-fire agreement, because what is the point of the UN's version?<br> <br>Quite frankly, I think your question about North Korea shows a lack of understanding; you say it seriously, but it isn't a serious statement.  First, it has taken us <b>twelve years</b> to get to this point with Iraq, and you think that an equivalent action for North Korea would be to threaten them with war after a few months?  That makes not a bit of sense.  Second, the UN Security Council <b>is</b> currently taking up the North Korea nuclear issue, for the first time.  The US is in very active talks with China, Japan, and South Korea.  It is a process, and the process is moving forward.  Maybe it will be a twelve-year process like in Iraq.  I doubt it, but to draw parallels in such terms of immediacy is just nonsense.<br> <br>While I am being frank<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-), more nonsense is that the US and UK are part of the few who think inspections are not working.  First, it is absolutely clear from the resolutions that inspections can only work with full Iraqi cooperation, and it is absolutely clear from the inspectors that Iraq has been significantly uncooperative in several areas.  It is simply beyond reasonable doubt that inspections are not working, if by "working" you mean "fulfilling their objective" (and I can't see how it could mean anything else).<br> <br>Second, more to the point, there are dozens of countries who have signed on to the US-UK coalition against Iraq.  Even a cursory glance at the news turns up two other Security Council nations, Spain and Bulgaria.  But more importantly even than that: the German ambassador to the UN has said, unequivocally, inspections <em>are not working</em>.  He said it just this morning on NBC.  The issue for Germany is not that they think inspections are working, but that they can be made to work.  Even Germany, who is opposing war, knows inspections are not working.  However, Germany is not willing, at this time, to follow the resolutions to the letter -- which requires nothing less than full and immediate cooperatrion -- that they can try a bit more to avert war.  I can't fault them for that.  I can, however, fault them for believing, against all evidence, that Iraq will ever fully comply with inspections (which is the <em>only way</em> inspections can work).<br> <br>As to commando units: there is simply no conceivable way the United States would risk going to war if they could solve the problem by assassinating Hussein.  Either they have been unable to do it, or they believe it won't solve the problem, or both.  Probably both.  A lot of people bring this up, and I would love to take this route if it were feasible.  None of us can know if it is, but I can't see how the US wouldn't do it if it could.<br>
