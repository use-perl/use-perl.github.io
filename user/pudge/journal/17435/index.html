<p>I wanted to work some with an old song I did in '92, using Electronic Arts Deluxe Recorder.  So I pulled out the old LCII, found the file on one of the hundreds of old floppies I had lying around (it's a good thing I was anal about labelling things), copied it from floppy to the hard drive, popped in the DRecorder floppy, <A HREF="http://homepage.mac.com/pudge/.Pictures/drecorder.png">opened the file</A> (man, that screen shot makes the software seem so ... old), and saved it as a Format 0 MIDI file.<br/><br/>So far, so good.  Now, how to get it to another computer?  One option would be to copy it to a floppy that the Linux box can read, since it's the only machine on my network with a floppy drive, but I don't have the software, that I know of, on this old LCII box.  I do have a LocalTalk (PhoneNet)-to-Ethernet adapter, but for some reason that just wasn't working.  The AppleTalk wasn't getting from one computer to another.<br/><br/>So I pulled out an old Power Mac 7100/66.  This computer was my main axe for years, but now it is in a bit of disrepair.  I couldn't get DRecorder working on it (the software was built for System 6, and it's running Mac OS 9), but I could copy the file via floppy, and then copy it to the Mac OS X Server box via AFP.  Of course, to get the floppy in, I had to pull the cover off the computer, because it doesn't quite line up with the case ... so now I have computer parts and cables strewn all ove the room, but all in the name of art, right?<br/><br/>This has convinced me I need a USB floppy drive.  You can get them for under $40, and I have a ton of floppies lying around, some of them with important old data from school etc.<br/><br/>And it worked; I got my MIDI file, and using <A HREF="http://homepage.mac.com/beryrinaldo/ddm/">Dent du Midi</A> I got all five tracks imported into GarageBand.  Now I've just got to clean it up in GB and play with it, which will take some time.  I just wanted to get the data now while I still have my wrist.<br/><br/>Oh yeah, I should mention my wrist ... next entry.</p>
