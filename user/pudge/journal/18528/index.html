<p>This is WAY too slow to stream over my AirPort network, even with AirPort Extreme (although I don't have a lot of signal strength, and the non-Extreme computer on the network slows it down further).<br/><br/>I had been thinking about maybe using it to rip all my CDs.  I still might, but it's just too big to use for streaming, and too new to rely on it for archives.

What if you attached your computer to the airport with a cable or something? The RJ-45 on my airport belongs to the TiVo, so that's a no go for me.<br> <br>I haven't tried the lossless encoding yet, but then, I think I have some significant hearing loss, so I'd just be optimizing (sound) in the wrong place.

<em>What if you attached your computer to the airport with a cable or something? The RJ-45 on my airport belongs to the TiVo, so that's a no go for me.</em> <br> <br>Not sure I follow.  If the data is going via AirPort, even if there is hardware in between, I think the problem is the air travel.  In my stereo closet, I have an AirPort Base Station connected to a switch, to which is connected a laptop (no wireless) and the PS2.  Someday I'll attach my TiVo to it (when I buy a new one that supports it, or hack mine).  That base station connects wirelessly, Extremely, to another base station, which connects to another switch, to which are connected other computers, including the MP3 server.

Sarcasm! Wireless is so much faster with gigabit switches and wires.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

Humor<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... I've heard of this thing before, but know not of it.

What's wrong with flac?<br>

I am trying to find out.  I am in contact with Apple about it, I'll report back at some point.

Any news on this?  I just came across the FLAC comparison page:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; http://flac.sourceforge.net/comparison.html<br> <br>Maybe not an unbiased source, but looks like the two formats<br>are roughly equivalent in function, though perhaps the Apple<br>encoder and decoder use more CPU.  Of course, there's also<br>the fact that FLAC is an open standard.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br> <br>I still don't get why some people like Apple so much.<br>

What does liking Apple have to do with anything?<br> <br>Anyway, I was in contact with Apple and the FLAC developer, and both claim better performance than the other.  I don't really care, as I think the real difference is that Apple did its own because DRM can be used with it.<br>
