<p>I have a Yamaha FG-230 12-string acoustic guitar.  It's got a red label in the sound hole that says "Nippon Gakki," which is what Yamaha used to be called.  I wanted to know more about it, and the Yamaha online guitar serial number finder had no info on it, so I e-mailed them (guitarguru at yamaha.com).  They told me it was made sometime in 1968-1972, and it has a spruce top, mahogany back/neck/sides, with a rosewood fretboard.<br/><br/>It's not worth much, apparently.  $200 tops, judging by eBay, but even then, mine's not in very good condition.  It's got some warping on the neck, I think.<br/><br/>This was my first acoustic guitar, and I had it strung as a 6-string, and I loved the booming sound.  I think I'll hold on to it and someday fix it up, bring it back to life.  Maybe I'll bring it in to my local music store (<a href="http://www.bigfootmusic.com/">Bigfoot Music</a>) and see what they have to say about it.<br/><br/>Speaking of Bigfoot, I need to buy a ukulele from them for Christmas, for the kids.  And maybe a book so I can learn to play it.
