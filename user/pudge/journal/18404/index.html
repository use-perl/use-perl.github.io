<div class="span8">
<p>I signed up, for $15, to listen to all the Major League Baseball games online, back on March 4.  Shortly after this, on March 24, <A HREF="http://www.streamingmedia.com/press/view.asp?id=2561">MLB.com announced a deal with Microsoft</A> where they would make most content available only through Windows Media Player.<br/><br/>The short of it is that after I signed up, MLB.com changed the deal, and made it so I could only listen to the archived games -- that I paid for -- if I used Windows Media Player, instead of Real Player, as I had been doing.<br/><br/>This is called "customer service," where the customer is, of course, Microsoft, and not me.  I am demanding my money back, of course.  I hope many more people do the same.

It's not like MLB is locking you out of enjoying the content<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... you just need to use the aforementioned (love that word!<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)) player instead.<br> <br>I'm sure that Microsoft paid a pretty penny for the exclusive rights in this situation, which in a way, you could be thankful for.  It helps to subsidize your membership fee, gives the service a renewed stability investment and Microsoft's coffers are ever-so-slightly more diminished.<br> <br>Just press play and minimize it in the background<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... I don't see what the big deal is.  It shouldn't interfere with your enjoyment of the content.  I'm trying to think of an analogy, but I'm not very creative at the moment.<br> <br>Peace,<br> <br>Jason

<em>It's not like MLB is locking you out of enjoying the content</em> <br> <br>That is a matter of opinion, and completely beside the point.  The agreement I signed up under said I could use Real Player.<br> <br>However, I'll note that Windows Media Player simply doesn't work properly.  Even if it did, I wouldn't want to use it, because of its horrifically bad EULA.<br> <br> <em>I don't see what the big deal is.</em> <br> <br>Why should you?  All that matters is they broke their agreement.<br> <br> <em>It shouldn't interfere with your enjoyment of the content.</em> <br> <br>If Microsoft were neutral, fine.  But it isn't.  It's evil.<br> <br> <em>I'm trying to think of an analogy, but I'm not very creative at the moment.</em> <br> <br>Hitler.
