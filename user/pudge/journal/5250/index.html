<p>A landscaper is fixing our front hill at our house, finally.  We are getting trees!  We have a ton of trees, as our house borders the forest, but the developer ripped out the ones in front of the house etc.  So we get a couple back.<br/><br/>We also had <A HREF="http://www.invisiblefence.com/">Invisible Fence</A> installed for our dogs; they're learning how to use it now.  Our oldest dog, Banjo, is having problems.  He hates it, and gets confused easily.  The middle dog is very smart and is getting it well.  The youngest dog is stupid, but it's amazing what those shocks can do to make you "get it."  :-)  This summer we'll have a much nicer yard to enjoy, with the dogs essentially free to roam, and a nice-looking hill.</p>

This looks really cool, but what happens when the power goes out?  Do you have to go around chasing after the dogs as well as cursing the sudden loss of internet connection?

Only if the dogs are both smart and devious.  First, they won't know when the power goes out, so by then they will be trained to stay away from the boundaries anyway, and won't think to go near them, unless they make a habit of testing the boundaries, or they happen to fall into the bounadry and either don't think about it not being active (not likely) or realize what happens and make a run for it.<br> <br>My dogs rarely run off the property anyway, and when they do they come back when we call them, and we still won't let them stay outside for extended periods without our supervision, so them trying to escape is not really an issue.  This is more so we can just let them outside and play for a short time when we don't want to go out, or so we don't have to care about them going to the front yard, outside our direct supervision, while we are gathered in the back yard.<br> <br>And yeah, I am more worried about the Internet connection.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

<h2>Manual labor</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/pudge/">pudge</a> on 2002-05-28T16:40:13</h3>
There's two guys outside now shoveling a huge truckload of mulch into wheelbarrows to put on the hill.  Man, I am sometimes glad I get to sit on my butt for a living.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

I oftentimes have the opposite thought of "man, I'd like to go back to more manual labor."  Usually this occurs after buying new pants or playing soccer with the kids.<br> <br>And sometimes when debugging...<br> <br>

Manual labor in small quantities is fine.  But these two guys manually moved 30 cubic yards of mulch around<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...
