<p>Something just hit me.<br/><br/>I realized the other day that the only Boston team to NOT beat St. Louis for a championship was the Red Sox.  Someone else noted that all three other teams broke major slumps against St. Louis: the Celtics won their first ever championship against them in 1957, the Bruins broke a 41-year slump in 1970, and the Patriots won their first in 2002.<br/><br/>And just now it hit me: all three teams lost the next year (58, 71, 03), but went on to win another championship the following year (59, 72, 04).<br/><br/>Could we be seeing the Sox again in 06?<br/><br/>Also, <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/pudge/journal/18562">never have two Boston teams won a championship in the same year.</a>  This would only be the second deacade two Boston teams have won, which makes up for the fact that the 90s was the first that none won.<br/><br/>Of course, the Sox actually have to win it.  And I, and millions of other fans, are probably jinxing it right now by talking so much about this stuff.<br/><br/>I am going to play hockey again tonight, perhaps missing the victory.  I almost hope they lose so I can watch the actual victory live.  Which means I am probably jinxing it further.</p>
