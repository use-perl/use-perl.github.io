<div class="span8">
<p>In my <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/pudge/journal/32145">previous entry about the Pats</a>, I should have factored in the Jets.<br/><br/>You see, the Pats three biggest rivals under Brady and Belichick have been who?  The Steelers, Colts, and Jets.  And every playoff game under B/B in years they went to the AFC Championship were won by three points except for games against their rivals, which were won by 7, 10, 14, 17, and 21.<br/><br/>So, Pats by 24.<br/><br/>I am probably the only one making that prediction.  But if I am right, I will have bragging rights for time immemorial.<br/><br/>Oh, and also, everyone is still picking the Colts.  For the same reason: they are "due."  Yeah, they were due in '04 too, and they lost by 17.  They might win, but it won't be because they are "due."

<h2>Sorry bout dat</h2>

I guess it was the Colts year (so far).



<h2>Colts</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/djberg96/">djberg96</a> on 2007-01-22T13:28:29</h3>
And I quit watching at halftime because I thought the Colts were doomed, although I saw the last few minutes.
<p>
I'm not sure what the Pats need for next year. Linebackers, maybe.</p>
