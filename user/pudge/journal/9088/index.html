<p>Massachusetts is second-to-worst in drunk driving, <A HREF="http://www3.madd.org/laws/grades.cfm">according to MADD</A>.  The only worse state is Montana, with an F.  Alaska is tied for worst at D-.<br/><br/>The scores are achieved by ranking many different parameters, including existing laws, support from political bodies, deaths, etc.  The governor's office got a D, while the nationwide average is a C.  I wonder if having a teetotaling Mormon -- the very antithesis of what it means to be a Masshole -- in the corner office will make a difference for next year's grade.  :)

Since we're only 1 away from the bottom of the list, I hardly see how it could get worse. Being a teetotaling Mormon myself, I've gotten along just fine w/o alcohol for many years now. I figure I've saved thousands not drinking, (of course only to blow it on other things). Not to mention I avoid embarrasing myself in public.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)
<p>
On a related note, I wonder if the police should be working harder at getting people to wear their seatbelts or keeping people from driving drunk?</p>

It seems you took me to be speaking negatively of either the Governor-elect or of teetotaling Mormons.  I was doing neither.  I just found it interesting that we had a "D" grade for Governor, and now we have a teetotaler as Governor.  I myself am a teetotaler, though not a Mormon.<br> <br>And they should work a lot harder on stopping drunk driving.  Difference between potentially harming yourself (no seatbelt) or others (drunk driving).<br>

No offense taken. I guess I should have made if more clear that my comments were tongue-in-cheek. However, I did have to lookup what "teetotaling" meant.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-) Religion aside, I have great hopes that our new governor can work to let me hold onto a little more of my paycheck. Only time will tell. Isn't it amazing that the people nearly voted down the state income tax? (Not that the legislature would have upheld it...)
<p>
And I agree 100% that drunk driving, excessive speeding, etc should be the focus of the cops policing our roads. The timing of the drunk driving results  is rather interesting considering last night's ER episode where a drunk driver kills a mother, child, and possibly a second child (pending a heart/lung transplant!) when he hits them while the family was building a snowman after a snowstorm.</p>

You mean not selling on Sunday doesn't<br>help us any? And whose bright idea was<br>it to make an exemption for that law<br>during the holidays? "Right so people<br>tend to be more depressed during the<br>holidays... I got it! Let's increase the<br>availability of alcohol!"

<p>the President was arrested for DUI I doubt that the overall message will be very strong for MADD, even with Romney. Besides, I can't really tell the difference between sober or drunk Massholes since the alcohol doesn't seem to impair their ability to drive poorly.</p>

Hm, it seems to me that the President's past foibles are good for MADD, since he hasn't had a drink in many, many years.  I think a lot more people care about the future, present, and recent past than they do about the distant past.<br> <br>Your point about the difference in driving is well-taken; perhaps this is why the police don't catch many of them, as they are too hard to spot?  In addition, the drunk ones get so much practice at driving drunk, they are probably more safe than drunks in other parts of the country, which makes it still harder to spot them.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br>

<b>Correction</b>: The President has <i>allegedly</i> been sober for many, many years.  His true state of sobriety is a matter of debate.</p>

I don't see how it could be a matter of debate since there is no evidence to the contrary.  But I suppose people like to debate for the sake of debating, whether there's good reason to or not.  Note that there is a lot more evidence that he is sober than there is that he had a drug problem, yet people seem quite willing to believe the latter<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...<br>

Being a Montanan, well I grew up in Montana, there really isn't that much to run into besided trees. Not that I'm condoning it, there just isn't much to do in that state, especially when winter hits.
