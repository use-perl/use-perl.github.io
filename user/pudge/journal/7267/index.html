<p>I'm going to the Jaguar party tonight at Cambridgeside's Apple store in MA.  I don't know why ... it must be my inner geek, but I feel strangely compelled.

I've been hearing good things about 10.2.  Any comments?  Are you noticing any speed improvements or other enhancements in general that you like?
<p>
I don't own a mac, but I tend to follow it because <i>someday</i> I'm going to get one.  At least, that's what I keep telling myself.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

My review:<br> <br>This is based on the latest ADC one, which I don't think is quite 'gold'...<br> <br>Yes, it's faster.<br> <br>Some things are fixed.<br> <br>The linker is still shite.<br> <br>The new apps aren't worth it.<br> <br>What you get for your money isn't worth it.<br> <br>That's about all. Feels and looks a lot like OS X 10.1.5, but a bit faster.

A few months ago I visited our local Apple store and gave an iMac a spin. I liked it a lot better than I expected. The GUI was very nice; better than anything I've used on Linux. However, it wasn't as snappy as I expected. Another thing was that for my normal web surfing and email activities, I couldn't find anything compelling. Last week I upgraded my home desktop to a very inexpensive Athlon XP 1600 and ATI Radeon 7500. Definitely not bleeding edge technology but much better than my Celeron 466. The most noticeable improvement was the speed of Mozilla and the KDE desktop. Give all of the glowing reviews of OS X 10.2, I had to visit the Apple store again for another test drive. Again, I was impressed with the nice GUI and desktop, but I definitely noticed that it seemed sluggish compared to my Athlon system at home. I'm beginning to think that Apple needs to get OS X ported to some subset of Intel/AMD compatible hardware ASAP. The big attraction of 10.2 to me is the ability to use mainstream apps as well as Unix tools. All in all I'd like to buy an iMac with 10.2, but I don't see it as a huge improvement over my current Linux with KDE (liquid theme) or Gnome system.

<em>I'm beginning to think that Apple needs to get OS X ported to some subset of Intel/AMD compatible hardware ASAP.</em> <br> <br>If you think hardware is the limiting factor of Mac OS X's UI speed, you're  mistaken.  Porting it to Intel would not make it faster.  The UI is slow(er) because it is doing a heck of a lot more than any theme you are running on Linux.  It's amazing it's as fast as it is!<br>

I kindly disagree. The UI speed of OS X was much better on the dual g4 machine than the iMac.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

That's not what I meant; I meant that it won't be significantly faster on Intel-based hardware than on comparable PPC hardware.

<p>Well, Jarkko and I are meeting up with Pudge and going too so... this is what happens when you get too old to go out clubbing until dawn on a Friday night<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) I just finished installing Jaguar on my iBook and so far it's terrific.</p>
