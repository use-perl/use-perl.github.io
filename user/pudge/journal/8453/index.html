<p>My current DVD player is dying.  I need a new one, but I am a bit ignorant about DVD players.  I'd prefer to get one now rather than later, though I could wait if something new is around the corner.  Some considerations:<br/><br/><UL>
<LI><B>Progressive scan.</B>  I want this, as I want to be able to use the player with a digital TV eventually, but can I use a progressive scan player with an analog TV, too?</LI><br/><br/><LI><B>Video DAC.</B>  Should I care about the specs of video digital-to-audio conversion, '10-bit 54mHz Video D/A Conversion with Super Anti-Alias Filter' and whatnot?  Anything else related to video (number of scan lines, etc.) I should care about?</LI><br/><br/><LI>CD-R, DVD-R, etc.</B>  <A HREF="http://www.vcdhelp.com/dvdplayers.php">This site</A> lists player compatibility with various writable media, which is helpful; I want it to play all the major media types (MP3 not really necessary, as I have a networked laptop hooked up to the same stereo that has access to my entire MP3 collection).</LI><br/><br/><LI><B>Coaxial digital out.</B>  My amp has two digital ins, one for optical (which is already in use by the DirecTiVo) and one for coaxial.</LI><br/><br/><LI><B>Multidisc.</B>  It would be nice, but is not necessary.  Hm, what about one of them 100 disc units?</LI><br/><br/><LI><B>Lasers.</B>  Should I care about the number of lasers?  Is this related to whether a multilayer disc will have a pause or not?</LI><br/><br/></UL><br/><br/>Thanks for any input you may have.  :)

Not too long ago I broke down and bought a cheapie Toshiba from Price Club.  It met my two main criteria: that it be a multi-disk changer (this one does 5), and that it can play MP3 disks.  So, fine.<br> <br>One thing I'm not happy about is how slow it is.  It takes several seconds to do <b>anything</b> --  boot up, read disk TOC, skip ahead to another song, go to next disk, open, close...  <i>Everything</i> is slow.  Significantly slower than the extremely cheap no-name 5-CD player that preceded it.<br> <br>So I recommend testing out the speed of these operations, to make sure you're comfortable with that aspect of the candidate.<br> <br>Now, here's the part where I say "If I had known then what I know now"...<br> <br>This stupid machine plays VCD's (mpeg-1), but not SVCD's (mpeg-2).  This has proven to be a real hassle, because (in my experience at least) people tend to distribute captured videos in mpeg-2 format.  Which means I'd have to convert them first, if I want to watch them on my T.V.  Which I have not been able successfully to do, yet.   So I am <i>not</i> a happy camper.<br> <br>So, if you can imagine this <b>ever</b> being important to you, check that the candidate is SVCD compatible.<br> <br>(I understand there's also mpeg-4, of which DivX is a dialect... but I don't know if any DVD players can handle that.  It's not something I've wanted to do (yet).)<br> <br>
