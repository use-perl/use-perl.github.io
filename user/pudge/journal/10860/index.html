<p>I've put up a new web page at <a href="http://projects.pudge.net">http://projects.pudge.net</a>.  Recently, I've been doing some project reorganization, and I wanted to use SF.net and the CPAN for file releases, SF.net for CVS, search.cpan.org for documentation/home page, and rt.cpan.org for bug reporting; although, in some cases, there are slight differences (Slash has its own CVS, and Slash and MacPerl are using SF.net for bugs and have their own home page).  So the new web page is the central place to get to all the various locations of these things, for each project I work on.<br/><br/>And now that I have brian d foy's release module working, I intend to do some more releases.  :-)  Mac::Carbon is next, a smallish release primarily for bugfixes and a few upgrades, and then I intend to get on with some Apple events/OSA stuff, and get Mac::Glue working.<br/><br/>As noted previously, MP3::Info 1.02 was just released; I'll come back to ID3v2 tag writing after the rest of this stuff, and it really needs better tests (though they were upgraded significantly for this release).  But then again, everything needs better tests.

"will be"?

Heh!<br> <p>Isn't saying "you'll be x in no time" just a long-winded way of saying "you are x"?<br> </p><p>After all, the assertion is that there will be "no time" between where you are now and becoming x.</p>

Sorry, I don't think I have ever known anyone to take "in no time" literally.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

An English woman once told me that "just now" refers to the immediate future in the UK, while in the US it refers to the immediate past.
<p>
Could there be the same sort of confusion for "in no time"?  Or are they just ruining the joke?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-P</p>

If he's not there yet (in a temporal sense), does Xeno's Paradox apply?  What's half of "no time"?

Uh, it would, but then someone had to come along and mess up all those wonderful Xeno's Parodoxes with calculus...
