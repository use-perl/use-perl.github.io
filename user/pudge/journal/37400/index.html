<p>My biggest gripes with iTunes and Front Row are that they don't work well with iTunes sharing.

And in fact, the last versions of both were a step <i>backward</i> in usability.  Front Row no longer shows album art for shared tunes, and iTunes no longer shows some of the info about a track (bitrate etc.) until the file is played.  And Party Shuffle feature has never worked at all.

In a networked world, it makes no sense.  Why punish users for keeping their music on a shared computer?

I was hoping the latest iTunes and Front Row updates would fix these problems.  Nope.  And the new Genius feature is also not sharing-capable, and therefore useless.

Oh, and in the list view, I always leave "genre" turned off, so instead of three panes at the top, it's only two.  Genre is completely and utterly useless to me.  I could not possibly care less about it, and it just takes up a ton of space, so I for years have left it turned off.

I can't turn it off anymore.

Apple continues to be extremely stupid.

<h2>iTunes is annoying</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Matts/">Matts</a> on 2008-09-10T22:22:16</h3>
<p>I guess they want you to use AirTunes and Remote (i.e. force you to buy an iPhone?)...</p>



<h2>switching off genre browsing</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jest/">jest</a> on 2008-09-11T14:01:26</h3>
<p>You can switch this off by firing up a terminal window and typing:</p><p>defaults write com.apple.itunes show-genre-when-browsing  -bool FALSE</p>

<p>Thanks jest!!</p><p>I thought there might be some hidden pref like that but I couldn't find it.</p><p>Now if only I can get it to remember my sort order for shared sources, like it used to.</p>
