<div class="span8">
<p>I was trying to figure out how to preload mod_perl scripts, and I was told by several people to use the PerlRequire directive.  The problem is, that's entirely wrong.<br/><br/>PerlRequire just does a require().  But what mod_perl does, via Apache::Registry, is load the text of the script, add some stuff to it, including a new package directive, eval it, and install it into its registry.  A require(), or PerlRequire, will not do anything to help here.<br/><br/>The correct answer is Apache::RegistryLoader.  I ended up using something like this.<br/><br/><ECODE>
PerlModule Apache::RegistryLoader
<Perl>
my @pls     = qw(names of scripts or something);
my $vhost   = 'hostname.example.com';
my $docroot = '/path/to/scripts';
my $r       = Apache::RegistryLoader->new;<br/><br/>for my $u (@pls) {
	my $f = "$docroot/$u.pl";
	$r->handler("/$u.pl", $f, $vhost) if -e $f;
}
</Perl>
</ECODE><br/><br/>I know this is in various FAQs, but 1. my DNS was acting up and I was having trouble getting anywhere, 2. I found plenty of people contradicting the FAQs, and 3. I had to add the virtual host parameter before it would work properly (else it would install the script in a different package than what it would be called as later), which wasn't in the FAQ.

<h2>There's still people using Apache::Registry?</h2>

Probably semantic confusion and people didn't understand you meant registry/CGI stuff rather than Apache API modules.  At least that's what I thought at first until I read the entire thing.  Then again I do most everything with <a href="http://masonhq.com/" title="masonhq.com">HTML::Mason</a masonhq.com>.

Well except for the one line inline <tt>PerlTransHandler</tt> the other day (to work around the fact that the neens that printed business cards for my wife helpfully prefixed a `www' on the URL for her site that she must have obviously forgotten because everyone knows that you have to have the www there for it to work).  Four lines in <tt>httpd.conf</tt> and a corresponding <tt>CNAME</tt> in the named config and all was well.
