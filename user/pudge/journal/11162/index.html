At least that's what I think the executives are trying to tell us. We, the executives, have all the power and you, the viewers, will like what we deign to give you.<br> <br>Oh no, they couldn't have chopped the last 30 seconds or so. No, they have to leave the damn thing in tact.<br> <br>Why do I continue to watch that network? Only about one show on it I watch and I could live with it. Of course, they want to give us "Scare Tactics", "The Dream Team" (is it still on?), and "Crossing Over". Bah, a pox on their offspring and everyone they claim to love.

I think the Farscape/Henson people made the decisions on he ending, not the SciFi/USA execs.  But I could be wrong.

It would be a little more acceptable but not much.

<h2>Awesome Ep</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jjohn/">jjohn</a> on 2003-03-22T17:22:58</h3>
I love the last show! What a wonderful ep. The ending is perfect, but I would have loved to have seen how the Farscape writers planned to get John and Aeryn out of that one! All Farscape's season enders have been just fabulous -- always leaving Crighton in an amazingly awkward position. I hope there will be some life for Farscape outside of a regular series. Four years of weirdness just isn't enough.

I don't mind that they died.  I just wonder what the "to be continued" was all about.  I would have thought it perfect if it just ended that way without it.

My general understanding is that the writers and producers still plan to continue the Season 5 story arc, even if they can't get the show produced.  Currently, the viable plans for this include novelization and possibly a few movies.
<p>
Admittedly, sentiment towards SciFi is poor at this point (check their boards if you don't believe that) but it wasn't their call.  SciFi really does not care about the show, so Henson could have added anything they wanted.
</p><p>
The fans have been desperate that the <em>story get out no matter what</em>, so I think it's a promise that the story will finish correctly even if the series didn't.</p>

In a sense, yes.  There's a tight bond between the fans who are vocal on SciFi's boards and chat rooms (and I realize there are plenty of fans who aren't) and the writers and executive producers.  This was something promised by those who love the show and consider it their child, not by the people who happened to finance the network.
<p>
In short, it's not a slap in the face -- it's a promise for one last shout.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>
