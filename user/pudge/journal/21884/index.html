<p>OK, so now journal RSS feeds should contain full text of journals with HTML.  Yay.  Of the form <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/pudge/journal/rss>.<br">http://use.perl.org/user/pudge/journal/rss>.<br</a><br/>And bonus, now you can get an RSS feed of your friends' journals (or anyone else's friends).  Of the form <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/pudge/journal/friends/rss>.<br">http://use.perl.org/user/pudge/journal/friends/rss>.<br</a><br/>The RSS links are in the &lt;HEAD&gt; of the journal pages (on my page you get the above links, on your page you get it with your links).<br/><br/>Lemme know if you have any problems.</p>

The friends RSS is great, but could we have the name of the poster somewhere else than in the link URL ? e.g. in the , that would be great.

Also, what would be cool is a (#) after the title to show the current number of responses.<br> <br>btw, i use Firefox's live bookmarks, which doesn't handle all that fancy dc:creator stuff.  I doubt they'll get around to letting us format live bookmark titles via format() strings (i.e. "%title (%dc.creator)").

You do.  It's where the name belongs: in the dc:creator field.

Oh, so I'll have to send a patch to the author of my RSS reader ? (I'm using <a href="http://kiza.kcore.de/software/snownews/" title="kcore.de">snownews</a kcore.de> currently, and it doesn't feel concerned with dc:creator.)<p>(BTW I meant &lt;title&gt; in my previous comment, slash ate my homework<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

Yes, whack him around!  (FWIW, NetNewsWire shows creator, but I think only for the pay version, not the Lite version.)

<h2>Excellent!</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Dom2/">Dom2</a> on 2004-11-17T10:38:15</h3>
These are really good; they're a big improvement over the previous set.

<p>Any chance that comments could get an RSS feed?  That's the only use case that keeps me in the browser right now.

</p><p>Thanks,<br>-Dom</p>



<h2>Problems with NetNewsWire</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/melo/">melo</a> on 2004-11-17T11:23:47</h3>
Hmms.. I get some use perl journals via Planet Perl, and they wont show up correctly. It seems Planet Perl problem, but just a heads up.<br> <br>By the way, do you plan to do this for the all-post feed?<br> <br>I'm using http://use.perl.org/journal.pl?op=top&amp;content_type=rss I got somewhere.<br> <br>Maybe I'm using the wrong URL.<br> <br>Thanks!

I would really, really love for this to work with the all-journals feed.  I would buy pudge some beers.

I would stop making fun of Pudge's choice of baseball teams if we could get an all-journals feed.  I don't have any friends because I read all the journal entries (even the ones by TorgoX).  Right now I have my own journal reader, but I'd sure like to get rid of it so everything shows up in NetNewsWire<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

<h2>All Journals Feed</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jbisbee/">jbisbee</a> on 2004-11-17T20:24:37</h3>
Yep a all-journals feed would be perfect (that links to to the individual journal entry
<blockquote><div>
<tt>http://use.perl.org/user/pudge/journal/21884</tt>
</div></blockquote>
rather than the just the user's journal
<blockquote><div>
<tt>http://use.perl.org/user/pudge/journal/</tt>
</div></blockquote>
There are three main reasons for this
<ol>
<li> The biggest complaint is that the URL isn't unique and the same URL could appear in the feed multiple times.</li>
<li> Another reason is that when you follow an older link/headline combination, you may be presented with a newer journal entry and then you have to scroll down and find the entry you want.</li>
<li> Finally, you don't instantly get to see the comments along with the journal entry when you visit the page.</li>
</ol>
<p>
This URL works best
</p><blockquote><div>
<tt>http://use.perl.org/search.pl?tid=&amp;query=&amp;author=&amp;op=journals&amp;content_type=r ss</tt>
</div></blockquote>
but because it lists all journals, it kinda sucks that you don't have the journal author's name in the headline.
<blockquote><div>
New Cool Journal RSS Feeds at use Perl; (Tuesday November 16, @06:32PM)
</div></blockquote>
Actually, while writing this comment, I whipped together XML::RSS::Headline::UsePerlJournals, that takes the search.pl rss output and removes the date and adds the id back in
<blockquote><div>
[pudge] New Cool Journal RSS Feeds at use Perl;
</div></blockquote>
and you get the actual URL to journal entry as well.
