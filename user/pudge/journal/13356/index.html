<p>Last night I joined a new inline hockey league in Seattle (ugh, I am still sore), and a nerw teammate says, "so, what do you do?"  "Computer programmer."  "For Microsoft?"  "No, Slashdot."  "I troll that site every night!"  He went on to explain how he posts goatse.cx links and page-widening posts, and asks if I work on the code to combat that.  It's lucky for him he is on my team.  :-)

No, he doesn't, and judging by his FSF t-shirt, probably doesn't use Microsoft much, either.

But what is his motivation?  Has he been trolling for long?  I can't imagine what sort of mind would find that entertaining night after night, but maybe I'm not exercising my imagination enough, since the trolls obviously do exist.<br> <br>Did he seem otherwise sane?  Could he have been doing a little F2F trolling by pretending to be a Slashdot troll?

Trolling people can be fun if you have nothing better to do.  See #perl for examples.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

True, but posting goatse.cx links and page-widening code isn't really trolling in that sense.  It's more like minor vandalism, and it seems like it would get old very quickly.

Oh, I imagine he does other trolling too.

<h2>Death Penalty!</h2>

<p>Surely you can find a new hockey player.</p>



<h2>Ban him!  :)</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/dlc/">dlc</a> on 2003-07-10T13:11:48</h3>
<p>Did you get his nick?  It might amuse him to
see a personal message from you when he posts...</p>

It took me a few reads before I stopped parsing that as an <tt>Inline::Hockey</tt> League.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)
