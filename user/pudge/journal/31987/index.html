<div class="span8">
<p>If you have the "I am willing to help test Slashdot's New Discussion System" checked, you get two cool new features today.<br/><br/>First is that you get a pair of neat CSS/JS sliders in place of the old box with arrows on it.  Drag them up and down and you see how many comments are available at each "threshold."  Let go and the page updates to match your selection.  (This widget is on the lefthand side of the page, covering up text.  A horizontal version is coming soon.  In the meantime, click the top right corner of the widget to make it go away, if it gets in your way.)<br/><br/>The other is that if a comment is hidden, it is not put into the page, to save on initial page load.  The comment is then loaded on demand via Ajax.  Slide the sliders to show greater-than-zero hidden comments, then reload to get a new version of the page, then drag the slider back down to reveal the hidden coments.  You'll see a "Loading ... please wait" text pop up under the box as the comments load in.  Same thing if you click "$n hidden comments" text to reveal the hidden comments: if they are not already loaded in, they are fetched.<br/><br/>Of course, none of this serves a big purpose for useperl, with its relatively tiny discussions, but on Slashdot, it should be a huge improvement.<br/><br/>

<h2>CSS buggy in safari?</h2>

I don't know if this is intentional, but the "thing" obscures the page. Can it be made to be part of the page? I know you can close it, but I hate having to do that EVERY time (perhaps log the fact that it has been closed in my cookie, and don't keep displaying it).

<p><div class="quote">I don't know if this is intentional, but the "thing" obscures the page. Can it be made to be part of the page?</div> Allow me to quote myself for context (with added emphasis):<br><blockquote><div>This widget is on the lefthand side of the page, covering up text. <b>A horizontal version is coming soon.</b></div> </blockquote><br>I don't know what you mean by "a part of the page" -- I assume you mean static and doesn't move? -- but that wouldn't help here, since where it is on the lefthand side would cover up something regardless.  Anyway, any change like that would require additional work, which we will instead put into the horizontal version (not sure if you're familiar with it, but it is much less intrusive given our page layout here).<br><br>So yes, it's a pain until we get that done.  Sorry.

I mean stop making it a floating widget over the page. Put it somewhere into the main part of the page. Does it need to float? I guess it *might* help on slashdot with hundreds of comments, but frankly it's just painful this way here.

<p><div class="quote">I mean stop making it a floating widget over the page. Put it somewhere into the main part of the page.</div> OK.<p><div class="quote">Does it need to float? I guess it *might* help on slashdot with hundreds of comments, but frankly it's just painful this way here.</div> Yes, but only because it is on the side of the page.  It's been horizontal and floating on useperl for months, and I cannot recall a complaint about it.  So when we get the horizontal version of this one working, I suspect you will find it unobtrusive.<br>

<p><div class="quote">It's been horizontal and floating on useperl for months, and I cannot recall a complaint about it.</div>  <p>I got irritated by the horizontal floating bar.</p>

<p>Firefox treats it as a separate page element, and a mouse's scroll wheel gets stuck on it: if scrolling down the page with a scroll wheel (or laptop trackpad equivalent), it stops once the floating bar is under the pointer, and I have to move the pointer down to a non-floaty part of the page before scrolling can continue.</p>

A better alternative might be a fixed border at the top, like I use in AxKit::App::Gallery. See <a href="http://home.sergeant.org/" title="sergeant.org">http://home.sergeant.org/</a sergeant.org> for an example.

<p><div class="quote">It's strong, but it doesn't mean much. What's wrong with it?</div> GEe, what a question. I don't want to use it, because I don't like it one bit, and now you want me to give a detailed critique.
<p>So, what's wrong with it. It gets in the way. It's big, it's about twice as high and twice as wide than it needs to be. It's not attached to the window, nor to the document, which are the only two acceptal modes, in my book. Instead, it's floating around, with a mind of its own. There's no way to get rid of it, it's always covering something. And you can't scroll the page from under it, because it insists on scrolling with it, to the same position it was before. Where it was in the way.
</p><p>You can't minimize it. You can't drag it away. The only way to get it out of the way is to close it. And then, there's no way to get it back, except by reloading the page.
</p><p>It's a good contender for the price of most annoying widget, if there was such a thing, almost on par with the silly "fetch" dog in Windows, and the paperclip in MS Office.</p>
