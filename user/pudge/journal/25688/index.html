<p>A month or so ago, my PowerBook sound card died.<br/><br/>Two weeks ago, I called Apple to get a repair done.<br/><br/>Monday, I sent them my PowerBook.<br/><br/>Tuesday, they received it.<br/><br/>Tuesday, they put it on hold because they didn't have the part.  It remains on hold.  I remain without my computer.<br/><br/>Because obviously two weeks was not long enough for them to get my part to the repair facility.

<p>Jenine had a totally buggered laptop, broken LCD.  Totally not Apple's fault.  They replaced the case, the hard drive, the LCD, the logic board, and send it back.  We had the laptop back 48 hours after sending it off.  We thought DHL had screwed up and returned the box we'd given them without sending it to Apple.</p>

Usually I do get it back in 48 hours.  I've sent in maybe a dozen repairs over the years.  They almost always come back quickly.<br><br>I need my PowerBook, fixed or not, for OSCON.  I am gonna call them next week to tell them to prepare to send it back in one week whether they have it fixed or not.

I got my computer back from Apple a couple of weeks ago - not only did they keep it for 2 weeks but they refused to fix any of the problems (wobbly base, LCD screen messed up).  I hate to say it but I've had better service from Dell.
