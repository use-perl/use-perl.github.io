<p>I've heard a lot of people say they disliked the new Matrix movie.  I thought it was great, better than Reloaded.  I enjoyed it almost as much as the original.  It had much better pacing than Reloaded, and much better action.<br/><br/>I cringed when they left Agent Smith (now as a human) alone with the doctor.  "Hm, we suspect he is insane and killed several of our crews, let's leave him alone with the doctor!"  Couldn't they have spared one or two guards?<br/><br/>I also hated the scene where Trinity died.  She should have died quicker, or Neo should have left her there.  People are dying in Zion, pal, get moving.  Here's how I would have rewritten the scene:<br/><br/><BLOCKQUOTE>TRINITY: Kiss me.<br/><br/><EM>They kiss.</EM><br/><br/>TRINITY: Now go.<br/><br/>NEO: I can't leave you.<br/><br/>TRINITY: I'm going to die, and you can't wait, now go!<br/><br/>NEO: I can't!<br/><br/>TRINITY: Urk!<br/><br/><EM>Trinity dies.</EM><br/><br/><EM>Neo holds her and yells.</EM><br/><br/>NEO: Nooooooooo!<br/><br/><EM>Neo suspects something, leans over and puts his ear to Trinity's chest.</EM><br/><br/>NEO: Hey, you're not dead!<br/><br/>TRINITY: Well, what the hell do you want me to do?  I can't just die, and you're too much of a wuss to go save everyone until I do.  Here, give me that shard of glass, I'll do myself!<br/><br/>NEO: Nooooooooo!<br/><br/><EM>Trinity reaches for glass, Neo tries to grab it from her, they struggle, she ends up with glass through heart, she dies.</EM><br/><br/>NEO: Nooooooooo!<br/><br/><EM>Everyone in Zion, having run into the temple, is overrun by the sentinels.  They die.</EM></BLOCKQUOTE><br/><br/>Speaking of death, did Neo die?  Did I miss something?</p>

<p>to add Jar Jar Binks saying "Neo, yousa gonna diiieee. Forget da gurl and go see da big man about da virus!"<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) It's just wishful thinking that he's really dead from those of us who thought Jar Jar would have been a welcome improvement to the entertainment. Maybe the next matrix movie will be a musical to liven it up a bit.</p>

<h2>Neo's death</h2>

To me it's pretty clear that Neo died. I mean, he gived his life to save the world -- that's a bit in the logic of the character, no ? But of course, in Matrix 4 (Matrix Resurrections) we'll learn that the Architect, as any good system administrator, made... <i>a backup copy!</i>

<h2>Neo</h2>

First, I also liked the movie. I keep hearing people gripe about it, but it was a good movie, answered enough questions, and left some to be thought about. Aside from the Trinity death scene, and the recreation (almost) of the great lobby scene from the first movie.. I thought it was pretty good.<br> <br>Anyways, I believe Neo is still alive. I only say that because the Oracle, at the end of the movie, said that one day they will probably see Neo again (or something similar). I also think it would be odd for the scene where he is being 'carted' off by the machines, if he was dead. Looked to me like they were taking him to rest. Remember, he has a "connection to the source". I doubt the little fight in the rain with Agent Smith would have killed him.. but becoming him and being the proxy for his deletion certainly could make him need some rest.<br> <br>I see in 3 years they will be handed another wad of cash for another installment. Maybe Neo will be a cyborg... or, maybe he always was!!

Well, there's two ways to look at his carting off.  If he were dead, why would they cart him off like that?  OTOH, if he were alive, wouldn't they be giving him medical attention, have him hooked up to tubes?<br> <br>Anyway, if I had to guess, I'd say he isn't dead, just because I expected them to clearly show he was dead, if he were dead.
