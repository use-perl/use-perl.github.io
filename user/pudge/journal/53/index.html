<p>OK, I figured out the problem with environ.  It had been (erroneously) defined before, and now was (properly) un-defined, plus it was not supposed to be accessed anymore.  So add in another #ifdef USE_ENVIRON_ARRAY arround the little code in util.c, and then we are set.<BR><BR>Although, I had to throw in a completely empty Perl_my_setenv function.  At some point, it should do something, but for now it won't.  I am pretty sure current MacPerl does not populate environ, either, so ... no biggie.<BR><BR>After a bunch of little things (and forgetting, then remembering, that xsubpp had not been patched and was therefore severely busted for my bleadperl build), I got a little MPW tool for perl.68K, v5.7.0.  What does this mean?  It means that we are close enough that v5.6.1 should be entirely doable (once the patches are integrated).<BR><BR>I am going to submit a few more patches for bleadperl, then I am going to return to the some other problems (InstallBLIB, maybe Config some more), and hopefully by then v5.6.1 will be ready for me to look at.<BR><BR>I might do some more work tonight (on the aforementioned patches), but not much work the rest of the week after that.  Tomorrow is Valentine's Day, and then my three-day MacPerl Work Week is done.</p>
