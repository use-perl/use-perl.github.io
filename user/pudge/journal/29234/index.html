<p>I hid a <a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/gadgets/electronic/79be/">Mind Molester</a> inside my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pudge/tags/aprilfools/">father-in-law's clock</a>.  He gave it to me a couple of weeks ago to fix.  So I fixed it, alright.<br/><br/>As you can see from the first URL, the battery and device are fairly long together, so -- as you can see from the second -- I snipped the battery connector off an old guitar tuner and soldered those leads to the device, and then I could put the battery in one place on the clock (there happened to be just enough room on one side) and the device in another.  Tolerances were very tight.<br/><br/>The trick then was to get the clock to him without him realizing what was going on.  I wasn't going to his house any time soon, but I happened to go trap shooting with him this weekend, and we went out to lunch afterward.  I "needed" to leave early, so I asked for his keys to give him back the clock, and put the clock in his trunk and returned the keys to him.<br/><br/>And thankfully, he didn't hear the beeping as he put the clock in his office at home.  It took him a couple of days to figure it out.  The only downside is that his hearing is not as good as my mother-in-law's, so she got more annoyed by it than he did.<br/><br/>Now he says he is going to get me.  Bring it, old man.
