<p>I updated <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/pudge/journal/29518">Discussion2</a> again just now.  The "Threshold" popup is replaced by a couple of buttons.<br/><br/>The main point of the More/Less and Worse/Better buttons is to help narrow a discussion based on the scores of the comments.  This is not very useful in most use Perl; discussions, but you can see it in action in <a href="http://use.perl.org/article.pl?sid=04/01/10/0055227">some big discussions</a>.<br/><br/>Also, one thing not mentioned previously, is if you have a long comment so you get the "Read the rest of this comment" link, that will now use AJAX-y goodness to fetch the rest of the comment and load it in-place.  Spiffy.

I was looking at <a href="http://use.perl.org/article.pl?sid=04/01/10/0055227" title="perl.org">the big thread</a perl.org> and decided to go at it as if I'd never had read it.<br><br>In doing that, I still found I'm wanting the same thing I've been wanting in the old system and in the in-progress discussions2 system: a [+] in the right-corner of a comment who's the parent of a thread within a discussion. I want to be able to toggle the class: hide at will, just like you can with the tags box.<br><br>I'd also love to see a down arrow or something that would jump me to the next thread. Sometimes a thread starts off good, but then the conversation turns to junk. So I find myself paging-down until the next thread starts.<br><br>A down arrow that jumps you and closes the current thread could be good.<br><br>Although the jumpdown/jumpdown-with-close might not be needed so much if a [+] closed either the entire thread or anything in the thread from that point, down.<br><br>Is any of the new code in ajax/comments.pl yet? I noticed some of the<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.js commits lately but haven't ventured to look further. I'm curious as to if you're using memcached or what - because I'd think w/ the constant ajax hits this thing will provide, for the larger sites something'd have to be done.<br><br>Will the by-pages-breakdown go away also? If it doesn't, can you atleast take a look making the paging on page/N/ start from the last cid that was shown on the prior page?<br><br>Also, someone had started what looked to be code stubs to show a discussion in more of a 'forumish' look. Is any of that included w/ discussions2? If not, are there plans for it? Even if the html/css isn't offered for it stock, if the code supports it I'm sure there's interest in this such that maybe there'd be others willing to help with that.<br><br>Now, get back to the code will ya?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)<br><br>

Click the title of the comment.<br><br><em>Is any of the new code in ajax/comments.pl yet?</em><br><br>It all is in CVS.  The one problem is that we have it in comments.js which is not properly copied into your live images dir if you do not use the default theme and do not put it in your THEME.<br><br><em>I noticed some of the<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.js commits lately but haven't ventured to look further.

It's only used to get the full text for a long comment, where we have the "Read the rest of this comment" links.<br>

Oops, didn't finish replying.<br><br><em>Will the by-pages-breakdown go away also?</em><br><br>It already has gone away.<br><br><em>Also, someone had started what looked to be code stubs to show a discussion in more of a 'forumish' look. Is any of that included w/ discussions2? If not, are there plans for it?</em><br><br>I do not know what code you are referring to, or what "it" is.<br>
