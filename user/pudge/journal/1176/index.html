<p>So awhile back we got a spare G3 Mac at work to play with Mac OS X on.  Well, that computer was wanted by someone else, and this FireWire PowerBook G3 was available, in good shape, so we traded.<br/><br/>I got ahold of it, and it had this weird problem where it wouldn't restart.  The hard drive wouldn't be recognized.  I had to shut down in order to boot.  Pretty soon, I couldn't even start up at all.  Fooey.<br/><br/>So it took forever for it to get repaired (not Apple's fault, per se, but the fact that we couldn't pay for the repairs right away), and I got it back and it is working fine, except that it won't wake from sleep.  It will wake from a sleep of maybe 30o seconds, but anything longer than that and the drive spins up, but no lights come on, no screen, no sound, etc.  I need to force-restart to get anything.  Other than that, the computer is working fine.  But without being able to sleep ... it could get old fast.<br/><br/>The good news is that it is just like my older laptop, but faster, has better battery life, and has internal AirPort.  The bad news is that it can't sleep.<br/><br/>Oh, and if I hit the down arrow followed quickly by the up arrow, THREE characters are produced: down, "\", and up.  Why "\"?  If I am holding down shift, then it is "|" instead.  What the heck?</p>
