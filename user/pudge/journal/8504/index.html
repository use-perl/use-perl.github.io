<p>use Perl may have some downtime coming up (ha!  down, up ... sigh).  The machine is being moved to a new colo facility across the country in about a week, and worst case is that it is down for as many as seven days.  Well, the worst case is that it is down for a lot longer, because something goes horribly wrong.  But it is likely that we will instead move the web server temporarily to another machine until the new box is up, and the downtime in that case should be only a few hours.  When I know more, I'll post it, and I'll post the final plans to the home page if it will mean significant downtime.</p>

Is this related to the <a href="http://slashdot.org/user/CmdrTaco/journal/14841" title="slashdot.org">imminent move</a slashdot.org> of Slashdot servers?  Where is the use.Perl server now?  Where is it going too?  What is the meaning of life?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...  Whoops, that's supposed to be, "What is the question to which the answer is 42, which was the original answer to 'What's the meaning of Life the Universe &amp; Everything?', when asked of the 'Big Computer'.  And is that related to <a href="http://everything2.com/" title="everything2.com">Everything</a everything2.com>?"

Yes, it is related to the Slashdot move.  use.perl.org sits on the same rack as and shares various resources with Slashdot, Slashcode, and other OSDN sites.  They are all moving to a new facility.<br>
