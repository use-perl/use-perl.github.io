<p>I <A HREF="http://use.perl.org/user/pudge/journal/13794">noted previously</A> that building perl on a dual G4/1.25 GHz / 1GB RAM was fast.  Well, doing it on a dual G5/2.0 GHz / 2GB RAM is a lot faster.  I set the processor peformance to "Highest" or whatever, from the default of automatic, because I am greedy.  Building perl 5.8.0.<br/><br/>Configure -des, G4: <ECODE>real    1m3.518s
user    0m19.540s
sys     0m38.910s

sys     0m36.290s
</ECODE><br/><br/>From beginning to end, the G4 did it all in 14:04.  The G5 did it in 9:41.  Taking away the tests, and it is more like 6:28 to 3:53.<br/><br/>Mmmmm, speedilicious.

<h2>-j2? -j4?</h2>

Just out of curiosity, it would be nice to know whether the traditional wisdom of overcommitting by one processor works (that is, is -j3 really faster than -j2), and also how much overovercommitting (-j4) trashes the systems?<br>

I was kinda wondering the same thing myself<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... but it takes so long to do each build, I don't want to spend the time doing the benchmarks!<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br> <br>make -j2, G5: <blockquote><div> <tt>real&nbsp; &nbsp; 2m11.921s<br>user&nbsp; &nbsp; 3m26.660s<br>sys&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0m45.240s</tt> </div></blockquote>make -j3, G5: <blockquote><div> <tt>real&nbsp; &nbsp; 2m13.723s<br>user&nbsp; &nbsp; 3m29.480s<br>sys&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0m49.440s</tt> </div></blockquote>make -j4, G5: <blockquote><div> <tt>real&nbsp; &nbsp; 2m25.240s<br>user&nbsp; &nbsp; 3m31.290s<br>sys&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0m50.420s</tt> </div></blockquote>make -j10, G5: <blockquote><div> <tt>real&nbsp; &nbsp; 2m24.177s<br>user&nbsp; &nbsp; 3m30.840s<br>sys&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0m50.500s</tt> </div></blockquote>So it actually looks like -j2 is slightly faster.  I did both -j2 and -j3 twice, with similar results: -j2 is faster by a good second or two.  And I also did -j4 more times, with similar results (slower than -j2 and -j3 by at least several seconds).<br> <br>One interesting note: Encode is always the last to finish.  I wonder if making Encode begin to compile first would speed up the results somewhat.  So with this run, I moved lib/auto/Encode/Encode.bundle to the beginning of dynamic_ext in the Makefile after Configure -des, and before make.<br> <br>make -j2, G5, putting Encode first: <blockquote><div> <tt>real&nbsp; &nbsp; 2m12.722s<br>user&nbsp; &nbsp; 3m26.750s<br>sys&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0m47.140s</tt> </div></blockquote>make -j3, G5, putting Encode first: <blockquote><div> <tt>real&nbsp; &nbsp; 2m13.575s<br>user&nbsp; &nbsp; 3m30.260s<br>sys&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0m48.490s</tt> </div></blockquote>Hm.  Never mind.  In the last test there, Encode STILL finished last, BTW.

Just for the heck of it, on a dual proc Xeon/2.4GHz, also with 2GB RAM:<br> <br>make -j3, Xeon:<blockquote><div> <tt>real&nbsp; &nbsp; 1m29.770s<br>user&nbsp; &nbsp; 3m57.040s<br>sys&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0m16.460s</tt> </div></blockquote>make -j5, Xeon:<blockquote><div> <tt>real&nbsp; &nbsp; 1m25.995s<br>user&nbsp; &nbsp; 4m59.250s<br>sys&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0m18.930s</tt> </div></blockquote>This machine does "hyper-threading", so it thinks it has four processors even though it has only two, hence the -j5 run.  Doesn't seem to make much difference.  Anyway, this Xeon compiles perl faster than the G5, by a lot.  I don't know if it means anything, though.
