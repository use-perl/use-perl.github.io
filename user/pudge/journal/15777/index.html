<p>With mod_gzip installed, my PerlAccessHandler handlers get called twice.  I dislike this.  Does anyone know what the heck is going on and how to fix it?

<h2>Replace ?</h2>

Replace mod_gzip by a perl-based solution ? there are several ones on CPAN.

Any recommendations?  Apache::Dynagzip looks promising, as do Apache::Compress and Apache::GzipChain.  I like Apache::Compress as I know Ken, and it looks simple, and handles files as well as dynamic content from mod_perl (does GzipChain do that?  not sure).  Dynagzip appears to send data in chunks, which is a nice thing, but I don't know the author and it looks more complicated to set up.

GzipChain is designed to be stackable, if your mod_perl supports it. In fact the bug you reported sounds like mod_gzip not correctly passing to the next handler, hence my proposal to use an alternative.

<h2>SubRequests?</h2>

I would hazard a guess that your PerlAccessHandler is being called as part of a subrequest the second time.  Try adding something like <tt>return unless $r-&gt;is_main</tt> to the top of your handler and see if it makes a difference.

<p>I've just been bitten by something similiar, but the other way around.  mod_ssl doesn't set up environment variables until the fixup phase.  Unfortunately, I needed them in the PerlAuthenHandler phase.  So I had to run a subrequest and look at the environment variables for that instead.  This is actually mentioned in the eagle book, but it's only one paragraph in 600+ pages.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

At one point some time ago we didn't, but it's been in there for some time now.
