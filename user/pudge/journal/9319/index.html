<div class="span8">
<p>So I am envisioning a superhero that has the power to do virtually anything, as long as it's really stupid.  For example, a guy is drowning in a pool, so he says, "I'll increase the temperature of the water until it turns to gas form!"  Or a large meteor is going to destroy the Earth, so he says, "I'll block its path with the Moon!"  Out-of-the-frying-pan-into-the-fire sort of stuff.<br/><br/>Call him Frying Pan Man?  The reference is both too obvious and not obvious enough, at the same time.  Some people will get it and think it it stupid, some will not understand it at all.  References don't make good superhero names, I think.

Not bad.  Someone suggested "Well-Intentioned Man", which I think is the better one thus far.
