<p>John Gruber <A HREF="http://daringfireball.net/2003/09/vaporoffice.html">writes about the benefits of writing open source software</A>, in the context of lack of participating in the porting of OpenOffice.org to the Mac.<br/><br/>I think John is overemphasizing the part about getting paid for work.  A lot of people put a lot of free time into open source software (including me :-).  But the problem is that people do NOT normally put a lot of free time into anything that does not give them direct benefit.<br/><br/>Whether it is serving in the Peace Corps, porting perl to the Mac, or working on Wall Street, people do things that satisfy some fairly direct desire or need.  I desire to have certain tools on the Mac, and I get a good feeling from helping others, so I write open source tools for the Mac.  Then there's Slash, which I use, and which helps others, but which doesn't help me or give me a good enough feeling that I would work on it much if I didn't get paid to.<br/><br/>But what benefit do I get from working on OO.org?  Maybe it does help others, but mostly people who are willing to pay for software anyway (i.e., businesses).  It's not something I will use myself much, if at all.  I simply have no incentive, and I am not alone.  The fact that few people are working on it is strong evidence that few developers feel they would benefit directly, significantly, from OO.org for the Mac.<br/><br/>Some might say there's a long-term incentive of saving the Mac platform from the closing of Office, which is going to kill off the Mac eventually.  Even if I believed that, so what?  If it's true, then the future of many companies are relying on it, and they will put out the money to get it done.<br/><br/>That's how this stuff works.  If things really are needed, they will get done.  If things aren't getting done, chances are they aren't really needed.<br/><br/>(BTW, the name of the program is not OpenOffice, it is <A HREF="http://www.openoffice.org/">OpenOffice.org</A>.  It's stupid, but there it is. )
