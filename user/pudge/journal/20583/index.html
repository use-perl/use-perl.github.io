<p>I went to get a new water filter for my several-months-old refrigerator yesterday, at Sears.  I put the model number on a piece of paper in my wallet and went forth.<br/><br/>I need a filter, and have the model number here, I said.  "Is it a Kenmore?," he asked.  Yes, it is, I replied.  "Is it a side-by-side?"  Yup.  "Is the filter in the grille on the bottom?," he asked, pointing at an example.  Yes.  "I don't need to look up the number, that's easy, this is the one you need."  I paid and left.<br/><br/>It was the wrong filter.

<p>I also have a Kenmore fridge.  The last time I needed a filter, I got the right one by typing in the model number at <a href="http://www3.sears.com/" title="sears.com">Sears online parts store</a sears.com>.</p>

Yes, I just happened to be in the area, and didn't want to wait for a filter by delivery.

<li>Go back.</li>
<li>Without explaining that you've been there before or showing them the wrong filter, ask for a fridge filter.  Try to make sure you get the same person as before, and hope he does not recognize you.</li>
<li>When they ask you those questions again, answer them the same way.</li>
<li>When they hand you the wrong filter again, hold up the wrong filter they previously sold you, and say "Oh, and I'd like to return this.  It's the wrong filter."</li>
</ol>
Sure, it won't win the goodwill of the Sears employees, but the look on that person's face when their logical short-circuit finally causes a cranial fire will be pretty entertaining, I'll bet.

Close.  The other thing to have is the *old* filter (since he's going back, he'll have the opportunity to pick it up now).  When the wrong filter is presented again, the tirade should go:<br/><br/>NO THAT'S WRONG!  YOU SOLD ME THE WRONG FILTER TWO DAYS AGO.  THIS IS THE *RIGHT* ONE, SMARTYPANTS.

I was shooting for a quieter, mocking form of contradiction, but that would certainly work as well.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
