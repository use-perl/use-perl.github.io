<p>It was either <A HREF="http://pudge.net/files/mp3s/turning_thirty.mp3">this</A>, or TMBG's "<A HREF="http://www.leoslyrics.com/listlyrics.php?id=107353">Older</A>".  The song, "<A HREF="http://www.delusionresistance.org/christian/stonehill/equator/equator08.html">Turning Thirty</A>" by Randy Stonehill, was recorded for the Equator album, and the lyrics fit my life 20 years later quite well, except the verse about being a musician who goes out on tour, which I skipped.  :-)<br/><br/>It's not that I feel especially introspective at this point ... that isn't how I function.  But I feel I <EM>should</EM> be introspective at <EM>some</EM> point, and this seems as arbitrarily good a point as any.  I've actually been planning for some years to be introspective at this point, just so I wouldn't forget.  It's not easy being me!

<p>Tell me about it.  I just got the beard right and then you moved across the country.  What's a guy to do?</p>

I've been wondering myself a little, from time to time, what 30 will be like when I get there.  How is it?  Anything important I should be informed of now, before I get there?

30 ain't like 15, and it's not like 25.  My back's a little stiff, and there's some lines around my eyes.

Eccch.  My knees are starting to give me trouble in the morning; I fear for my ability to walk without pain by then.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:\
<p>
As for the reason for the eye lines -- what do you attribute them to?</p>

Turning 33 was tougher for me.  Mozart, Jesus, and Alexander the Great all died at 33, so naturally, I compare my accomplishments to theirs.<br> <br>Them:<br>- Extraordinary musical genius<br>- Conquerer of known world<br>- Purported savior of universe<br> <br>Me:<br>- Not dead yet<br> <br>So from a certain perspective, I'm ahead.<br> <br> <p><nobr> <wbr></nobr><code>:)</code> </p>

<h2>Happy B-day, old man</h2>

<p>Now your cantankerous attitude will recognized as wisdom!  Witness 20-year-olds become stupider by the day!  Mysterious back pains and ear hair soon to follow!  Your three decades on this planet entitle you to more benefits than can be listed here, but you'll know them when they appear.
</p><p>Enjoy your birthday spankings.</p>



<h2>Woot!</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jamiemccarthy/">jamiemccarthy</a> on 2003-07-24T23:49:28</h3>
Happy one!



<h2>Turning 30 wasn't so bad</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jbodoni/">jbodoni</a> on 2003-07-25T18:48:31</h3>
<p>I had a lot tougher time turning 27 once I realized that 27 was 90% of 30.  "My God!  I might as well BE thirty!"</p>

<p>Thirty-three gave me pause (one-third of a century, after all), as did 35.  My dad was 35 when I was born, and my wife and I don't plan to have kids, so it was a generational milestone of sorts.</p>

<p>The 90% of 40 went by without a hitch, as did number 37.  I'm to the point where I don't celebrate birthdays any more, I endure them.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

John
