<p>Let's remember just how much the Yankees suck. The Red Sox are only a couple of games ahead of them, but ... they suck, and the we rule.<br/><br/>I made a <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/pudge/.Movies/sox-hits.mov">video</a> using footage from the 27-hit game the Sox put about a month ago at Yankee Stadium, as a reminder of these basic facts.

The Yankees suck, but that's because the MLB sucks.  Which, by extension, means that the Red Sox suck, to (just not as much as the Yankees).
<p>
Just remember, <i>if it's not on <a href="http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0364725/" title="imdb.com">ESPN 8</a imdb.com>, it's not a sport...</i>

No one who knows the Nats *exist* really hates baseball all that much.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

<h2>Nats might not suck</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jmm/">jmm</a> on 2005-07-11T19:12:15</h3>
The Nats - that's the team from O'Reilly, New Zealand, isn't it?



<h2>Re:Yankees, Sox, Nats...all suck</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ziggy/">ziggy</a> on 2005-07-11T20:00:56</h3>
Sorry, but some of us know that the Nats exist simply because (a) the local news media use it as a touchstone whenever there is no other news to report [1], and/or (b) it's important to know when to avoid peak crowds on the trains/highways.
<p>
The good news is that with the NHL strike, the Washington Bullets didn't play this year, which meant half as much crowding downtown in the restaurant district.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)
</p><p>
1: After the "Live Team Coverage of the Sandra Day O'Connor resignation"[2] petered out, the Nats were still there filling time between commercials.
</p><p>
2: No, I don't mean that facetiously.</p>

Heh, Washington DC is stupid.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)<br><br>Oh well, I guess that's in some ways better than the Rams and Raiders leaving L.A. and *nobody noticing.*

Yeah.  Noticing your team leaving under dark of night is <i>sooo</i> east coast, man.
<p>
The Left Coasters have got the right idea: wake up and watch the end of the Tour de France with your corn flakes, or go watch the Ironman or the Iditarod in person.  Baseball is really just a good excuse to pop into your kayak and pick up home runs and foul balls from Candlestick.  (And then sell the ball to some overpaid CEO down the road.)

It's not like any team from <tt>CA|OR|WA|ID|NV|AZ|UT|AK|HI</tt> ever won a Super Bowl, World Series or World Championship or anything.</p>

<p>Hey! The California, um, I mean Anaheim, um, I mean Los Angeles, no, wait, got it right the second time, uh, Anaheim Angels won the 2002 World thingy. But then, I don't pay attention to 'em much after the last name change.</p>

Aren't they an MLS franchise?  Didn't the MLS fold the next year?

<p>You're joking, right?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>
<p>BTW, when the "L.A." Rams left, we waved goodbye, because that meant that the Angels got their pseudo-football stadium turned back into a real baseball stadium.</p>
<p>Now we can only hope that the new owners of the Ducks (NHL) rename the team to something more sane...and less Disney...</p>

<h2>Only in perl...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/runrig/">runrig</a> on 2005-07-12T16:47:57</h3>
Only in perl does <code>"Los Angeles" == "Anaheim"</code>.

And just for fun, Some links on the <a href="http://kcal9.com/localsports/sportsla_story_021192636.html" title="kcal9.com">LA to </a kcal9.com> <a href="http://kcal9.com/localsports/sportsla_story_061204529.html" title="kcal9.com">Anaheim</a kcal9.com> name change (Readers may google themselves if they want to find out about the "California" or any previous incarnations of the Angels).



<blockquote>

<h2>Errr...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/runrig/">runrig</a> on 2005-07-12T17:01:05</h3>
That would be the "Anaheim to LA" name change...sorry for the confusion...

The NHL needs some marketing.  With no season this year - it just took me 10 minutes to remember the name of the team.
