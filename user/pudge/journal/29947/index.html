<p>If the U.S. wins on Thursday, and so does Italy, then the U.S. goes to the second round of the World Cup (the U.S. could also advance with some other situations, but this is the simplest; the one thing for sure is the U.S. needs a win).  If this happens, the U.S. will likely play on Tuesday at 10 a.m. Chicago time.<br/><br/>The question is, of course, do I skip YAPC to watch?  The sessions during that time are Learning Perl 6 (sorry brian and Randal), Intro to Catalyst (sorry jibsheet), Catalyst-based software, Solstice Framework, web testing, web testing with Selenium, Module::Compile (sorry Ingy), and maintaining CPAN modules.<br/><br/>Suggestions are welcome, as are solicitations for companionship in front of a TV at a nearby pub, hotel lobby, etc.<br/><br/>And, of course, it's all moot if the U.S. doesn't advance.

<a href="http://yapcchicago.org/wiki/index.cgi?TheWorldCup" title="yapcchicago.org">http://yapcchicago.org/wiki/index.cgi?TheWorldCup</a yapcchicago.org><br><br>It could be worse. Before I realised I'd stuffed up the time zones, for a minute there it appeared the Australia game was on during <b>my</b> talk! Now that was a hell of a thought... I thought my talk started with 20 minutes to go in the second half<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:/<br><br>Thank god it's only 10am to 12noon.<br><br>I can watch the talks I miss on the YAPC::NA DVD I figure<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)



<h2>USA versus Italy</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Ovid/">Ovid</a> on 2006-06-19T08:42:25</h3>
<p>I watched the USA versus Italy match and that was a hell of a match.  Three sendoffs!  There are going to be some very annoyed coaches.</p>

<p>I don't know much about football (my brother had to explain the offside rule to me), but I figured since I'm over here, I may as well watch and enjoy.  Now do I root for the USA or England?  Decisions, decisions<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...</p>

<p>(My father lives in Germany and is naturally cheering for them.  I don't think my supporting them is an option, though).</p>



<h2>if ascii is enough for you..</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/domm/">domm</a> on 2006-06-19T10:24:34</h3>
try this:
<p>
<code>telnet ascii-wm.net 2006</code>
</p><p>
(although I'm not sure it works outside of Austria.).
</p><p>
It's an aalib-powered telnet-stream of the live tv broadcast (enhanced with some text describing what's going on).
</p><p>
Great fun!

If I have to, I'll pause the talk periodicaly to check some sort of online scoring widget so people know whats happening.

There's so little scoring in soccer, it's kinda pointless to know what the score is<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... you have to actually <em>see</em> the game.<br><br>Maybe you'll luck out and the U.S. or Italy will lose on Thursday, meaning it is unlikely the U.S. will advance to the next round to play on Tuesday.<br>
