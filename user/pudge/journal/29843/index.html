<p>In the past few weeks, I've made a lot of room on my PowerBook's 60-but-really-55 GB hard drive.<br/><br/>First, I removed old fink stuff from /sw.  I kept bin, etc, include, lib, sbin, share, var.  But I removed the fink and src subdirectories, which was together about 1.1GB.  I also removed fink from my environment; I'll give it a month or two to make sure I don't need it, then delete the rest (and maybe move anything I do need to /usr/local first).  That will get me another 1.25GB.<br/><br/>Next, I added an external hard drive to my home studio, 160GB.  I pretty much will do my music and video production in that room, so I can move a lot of files to that drive.<br/><br/>First, I moved all my music files for Logic and GarageBand over there, about 4GB worth.<br/><br/>Then I moved my Apple Loops, over 6GB worth.  In the process, I discovered "Apple Loops for GarageBand" were installed in two different locations, in /Library/Application Support/GarageBand/ and /Library/Audio/, to the tune of 1GB.  I also had some loops in ~/Library/Audio/.  I consolidated all these loops into one folder in the external drive, deleted the loops index files, and then reimported them into GarageBand, where I was prompted to leave them there or copy them.  I left them there, it created my new index files, and all was well.<br/><br/>Then I did similar things with other GB and Logic files.  GB instruments take up 2.1 GB; Logic's samples (instruments, drums, and reverbs) take up 4.2GB.  I could not find a way to tell Logic and GB to look elsewhere, so I just made symlinks.  I also moved the GarageBand Demo Songs, 400MB.<br/><br/>Finally, I put the iDVD themes (also in /Library/Application Support/) to the drive, and told iDVD in its prefs to look there for my themes.  1.7GB.<br/><br/>Along the way, I also removed things like the iWork and iDVD tutorials, for another half-GB or so.<br/><br/>So we're talking about 20GB saved, off a 55GB drive.  Not too shabby.  Now time to fill it up again!<br/><br/>
