<p>I got <A HREF="http://www.robomower.com/">Robomower</A>.  I didn't get to install it this weekend, as the box did not include any of the necessary accessories (wire, stakes, box to run current through wire, directions, etc.).  Went back to dealer on Monday to pick those things up.  I'll do that the next day I am not bogged down at work, and it is not raining (maybe Friday, Saturday?).<br/><br/>I also am returning my <A HREF="http://www.harmonyremote.com/">Harmony Remote</A> SST-768 in favor of the more user-friendly SST-659.  The new one is shaped like a TiVo remote, it has dedicated directional pad (old one shared it with numeric keypad, which was my single biggest frustration with it), dedicated activity buttons, etc.  My only fear is that it apparently does not allow XML customizations of the configuration like the old one did.  I hope that won't be an issue (I did have a few customizations in the old one, mostly to add items to menus, but the new one has more buttons to play with, so it shouldn't be an issue).

<p>Now we can all wait for the entry title "Robomower ate my dog!"<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) I hope the invisible fence for the boys doesn't get confused and cross circuits with the robomower<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) Take pictures as I really must see this in action.</p>

Yeah, I was concerned about it -- as they use similar technology, and wires will both be there -- but they say they've tested it with "none or minimal" problems or something.<br> <br>They have QuickTime movies on the robomower web site, if you wanna see it in action.

As if marketing people never lie<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) I want pictures of you in a lawn chair with umbrella drinks on the lawn while the thing mows around you<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

The thing has "satisfaction guaranteed" and I will test the invisible fence with it<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... if it fails, I will return it, and be angry.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

<h2>Couple of questions</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/clintp/">clintp</a> on 2003-10-23T16:07:17</h3>
From a lawn &amp; garden/gadget geek:
<p>
Does this thing have sensors to detect wet grass (from dew, rain, etc..) and is it smart enough not to mow when it's too wet?   The FAQ says that water won't hurt it, but I'm picturing wet grass clogging up the works...
</p><p>
A theme seems to be that this will mow your lawn much more frequently than you would with a walk-behind mower.  If it slacks off for some reason (or the first-time use) will you have to use a gas mower or something to knock down the excessive growth, or does this seem like it can handle long grass?
</p><p>
Good luck!  Can't wait to hear more.</p>

It doesn't mow on a schedule, but when you put it out and press GO, so you check for wet grass, Mr. Lazypants.<br> <br>Not sure about long grass, but as I don't have a backup mower, I'll find out soon enough.  The movies online showed it mowing some grass longer than mine, though it didn't look quite as thick.  I'll put it at the highest settings and see how it does.

Doesn't mow on a schedule!?!  Pfft.  This is a perfect opportunity for some hardware hacking.  Maybe a nice online interface to kick it off, monitor battery usage, and track it around the yard as it goes.
