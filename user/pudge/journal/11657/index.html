<p>Jennifer's family last year moved to Washington, about an hour north of Seattle.  Now thet we have a child, she wants to live close to her family; and we've wanted to move somewhere else for some time, but SoCal, where they lived before, was always out of the question.<br/><br/>So, we are moving to Arlington, Washington.  We've got a new house ready and everything is moving ahead for a move in June.

<h2>Welcome to Puget Sound.</h2>

Puget Sound - One of the most beautiful places in the world.  <p>
One of the things you'll want to buy is a <a href="http://thomasguidebooks.com/" title="thomasguidebooks.com">Thomas Guide</a thomasguidebooks.com> - the only map book you'll need for Puget Sound. (It was the first thing I bought at the gas station when I moved here.)  The Perl user's group is <a href="http://seattleperl.org/" title="seattleperl.org">SPUG</a seattleperl.org> (we have quite a bit of fun), there is a <a href="http://linuxnorthwest.com/" title="linuxnorthwest.com">Linux festival</a linuxnorthwest.com>, and, well, Redmond.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

Welcome to the Seattle area! I think your family will love it here. Besides the Seattle Perl group, Portland is only a 2 - 3 hour drive.



<h2>Vancouver BC, CA</h2>

I did a lot of work in the Vancouver area for a contractor working on a project for the GVRD back in 1994-1997 timeframe.<br> <p>It is a beautiful area.  It does rain a lot, but it's probably not what you are thinking of when you think of rain.  Thunderstorms are quite rare and most of the rain is mist.<br> </p><p>They have as much rainfall in the Houston TX area yearly as they do in Seattle, but in Houston when it decides to rain, it RAINS.<br> </p><p>Personally, I love the misty weather.  I feel fine during the dark periods and when the sun does come out, it's just glorious.<br> </p><p>Vancouver BC is the home of <a href="http://activestate.com/" title="activestate.com">Activestate</a activestate.com>.  Hmmm... I wonder if they would want to field their stuff on OS X?  They put out a solid product.</p>

Yeah, Seattle gets close to 300 days a year (IIRC) of precipitation, but not a lot of inches compared to other places with far fewer.  I was in Houston for a summer in the early 90s<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... man, you'd think with rains like that, they would build houses that don't flood so easily.<br> <br>Anyway, I prefer more sunshine than not, but oh well.

I was once involved in preparing a bid for a Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA) system for the City of Houston City Water and Sewer system.<br> <p>The bid requirement documents, up front, in the first paragraph, if I remember correctly, referred to the fact that the Storm sewers in Houston could handle x million gallons/day.  It went on to say that the peak demand on them would be 3*x million gallons/day.<br> </p><p>I think they were making sure all the bidders knew that they would not be, in any way, held responsible for any flooding that might occur.<br> </p><p>It's just so flat there that there's no way to clear all that water.  The area where the Johnson Space Center is now was once a big swamp that had been drained.<br> </p><p>Of all the places I've lived, I think I like Salt Lake City best for the weather, although they have nasty winter inversions that cause the smog to settle into the valley for weeks at a time.  However, it's probably irresponsible to live in Salt Lake City, because it's a desert and can't really support that many people.  Perhaps the same could be said of Houston, but for the opposite reason.  It's naturally a big swamp (or wetland) and we should probably leave it alone.</p>
