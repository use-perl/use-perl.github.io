<p>I get hundreds of spams per day, a large percentage of which are "virus spams," the Microsoft worms/viruses that try to infect my Mac.  And a significant number of those are bounce messages telling me that the mail that "I sent" contained a virus.  Except, of course, that I never sent that mail.<br/><br/>Can someone clue these people in, the ones that run these "helpful" systems, that it is likely that <I>none</I> of the virus spams they are getting actually come from the user in the From: address?  They are contributing to the problem.  They are not helping.

Is the problem that the email contains a virus, or that there is no such user at the target domain? If it is the former I absolutely agree with you, and would be interested to know if there are any hints in the email headers that indicate what software is generating this *helpful* reply. If its a 'no such user' bounce there is no real way around this except to stop bouncing messages...not really an option.

I am getting some of both, but I am complaining about the "J00 sent the user a VIRUS, D00D!" messages.

Any hints in the headers to indicate what software is doing this? I've been trashing my spam alot lately so I can't look at my own.

All sorts.  Nothing in particular worth mentioning, that I've seen.
