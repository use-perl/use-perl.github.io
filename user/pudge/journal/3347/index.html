<p>In 1998, I received 857 spams.<br/><br/>In 1999, I received 1,532 spams.<br/><br/>In 2000, I received 3,140 spams.<br/><br/>In 2001, I received 7,386 spams.<br/><br/>Already in 2002, I have received 2,954 spams.  If February had been 31 days, I'd likely have gotten as many spams last month as I did in all of 1999.<br/><br/>I have never auto-filtered spam ... until now.  It's gotten to be too much.  I am getting about 50 spams per day, manually filtered to my spam box.  Sigh.  I get more spam every year than all previous years combined.  This year I expect to get about 20,000 spams at the current rate of growth, which has been sustained over several years, and shows no signs of abating.<br/><br/>It is really disgusting.</p>

I'm going to try installing it on my new mail box RSN, and I've got anectdotal reports from a friend
that uses it that it works pretty well.

The problem with this is you don't find out about the people who just throw their hands in the air and say "Sod it, why should I bother", and never respond to the TMDA check message. Unless TMDA logs this, and you check your logs (which would, of course, be full of spammers anyway).<br> <br>Instead try <a href="http://www.spamassassin.org/" title="spamassassin.org">SpamAssassin</a spamassassin.org>. It's pretty effective, and besides, I work on it<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)

Eudora filters catch most things for me.  I get mail from many different mailboxes directly to my Mac, and don't want to proxy it all through another machine first, unless I have to.

Do you download via POP? It's in the TODO list to write a POP proxy server in POE that automatically does SpamAssassin filtering, and it might be fun to hack it together sometime soon.

In my to-do list is to finish up something I wrote that logs into your POP account, skims messages, kills ones that look like spam or viruses, and then leaves your mailbox otherwise untouched -- i.e., when you download messages later with your POP client, nothing is marked as already-read.
<p>I have the basic POP machinery working; I just need to sit down and write the what-is-spam rules around it.</p>

<h2>Curious</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/chaoticset/">chaoticset</a> on 2002-03-07T17:18:32</h3>
Have you kept the same email address?
<p>
I ask because I have recently switched to what I believe is going to be the last address I'm at for some length of time.  I want to know how things will go.</p>



<h2>SpamAssassin</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/gnat/">gnat</a> on 2002-03-07T22:47:13</h3>
<a href="http://spamassassin.taint.org/" title="taint.org">SpamAssassin</a taint.org> is awesome.  I've been using it for a few weeks and with a couple of scoring tweaks I only get one or two pieces of spam a day now, instead of 40.<p>
