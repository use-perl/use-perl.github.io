<p>Ryan Dobson, son of <a href="http://www.family.org/">Dr. James Dobson</a>, and friend of mine from college, runs <a href="http://korministries.com/">KOR</a>, a 501(c)(3) youth ministry.  Part of the ministry is the <a href="http://korministries.com/podcast.html">KOR Kast</a>, a podcast, which now features a segment called "Politics with Pudge."  Which is me.  Talking about politics.<br/><br/>Feel free to let me know what you think about the segment here or via email, or send email to politics at korministries.com.<br/><br/>Since KOR is 501(c)(3), I <a href="http://www.irs.gov/charities/charitable/article/0,,id=120703,00.html">have to be a bit careful about what I say</a>.<br/><br/>Also, I found out recently that <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0229906/">James Dobson</a> (a different one) was in <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0043547/">Flying Leathernecks</a> in 1951 with John Wayne, where Mr. Dobson played "Lt. Pudge McCabe."  Hmmmm.

I'm always looking for good podcasts and this KOR Ministries is great.  I have to say, that I had some preconceived notions - which were probably unfair to Dr. James Dobson because most of what I know about Dr. Dobson is what the left says about him - anyway, my preconceptions were wrong and KOR is great.<br><br>Your Pudge on Politics for 10/5 is perhaps the best thing I've heard on this particular subject.  You people out there who are wondering what subject I'm talking about need to go listen to the podcast...<br><br><a href="http://www.amconmag.com/2006/2006_10_09/article.html" title="amconmag.com">This is best thing I've read on this particular subject</a amconmag.com>.

From the article:<br><br><i>On the other hand, we conservatives had logic, tradition, and most of the facts on our side&#8212;which pretty much leveled the playing field.</i><br><br>Score: -1, Flamebait.

<p> <i> Progressives, imagine if George W. Bush were using force trying to spread feminism instead of capitalism. Would you still protest his wars?</i> </p>

<p>I honestly think the answer to that would be "yes," given that to some extent the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have resulted in increased freedom for women and the left has heard this and is still protesting.</p>

<p> <i>Conservatives, imagine if it were Bill Clinton trying to suspend the Constitution to protect us against white terrorists like Timothy McVeigh. Would you call reporters &#8220;traitors&#8221; for covering it?</i> </p>

<p>Presupposes that Bush is trying to suspend the Constitution; fails to take into account the Republican/Bush view.</p>

<p>In this and a handfull of other places, the author's leftwing bias shows.  But overall, he does a good job and makes some good points.</p>
