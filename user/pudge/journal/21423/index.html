<div class="span8">
<p>This Sox-Yankees series is probably the best baseball series in the history of baseball.<br/><br/>It has everything.  Arch rivals for 100 years, finishing first and second in the division for several years in a row.  Last year the Sox blew Game 7 in the playoffs, and then went to improve their team by signing the best player in the league, who was then signed by the Yankees.<br/><br/>The Sox started the season great, pummeling the Yankees, but the Yanks turned it around, and finished three games ahead overall, while the Sox finished three games ahead of the Yankees in head-to-head games.<br/><br/>The Yankees won the first three games of the series: never in the history of baseball has a series gone seven games after one team won the first three.  Until now: the Sox won three straight, and here we are again, Game 7.<br/><br/>The series itself has been amazing.  The winningest pitcher in the league, Curt Schilling, was lame with a torn tendon in Game 1 and got shelled, and then came back to shut down the Yankees to win Game 6.  Game 2 was a pitcher's duel, and Game 3 was one of the biggest blowouts in league championship history.<br/><br/>Then came games 4 and 5, each going over 5 hours, and into extra innings, with the Sox coming from behind in both to beat the best closer in baseball, on back to back nights: something that has never been done to him.<br/><br/>Already, this series has broken records.  The aforementioned three straight for each team is one.  Equally excruciating is the fact that this is the longest series in terms of hours in the history of baseball, at 25:36, and they have played only six games.<br/><br/>So Wednesday's Game 7 is just going to be huge.<br/><br/>And I have a hockey game to play during it.  I can record it of course, but 1. this is a game you want to watch live, and b. I just know someone at the hockey game will tell me what happened.  So do I play my hockey game or watch the ball game?<br/><br/>Curt Schilling made a big deal after the game tonight about how he failed in Game 1 but prayed for the strength to compete in Game 6, and God gave it to him.  It wasn't a "Jesus made us win" speech.  For Schilling, prayer is not a way to win, but a way to reach your greatest potential.<br/><br/>And so he has inspired me, and I asked myself, What Would Curt Do?<br/><br/>Clearly, he would play the game, for his team, for himself.<br/><br/>So anyone who tells me what happens in the Sox game before I watch it on the TiVo gets a punch in the gut.</p>

I'm not a sox fan, but how could you <b>NOT</b> watch the game. If they win you'll be kicking yourself for years...

Well, I will see the game regardless -- via TiVo -- does it matter if I see it live?

I think so -- no matter how hard you try you'll probably hear about the game before you see it. So watching it later will rob you of the spontaneity that makes these things so thilling/disappointing. At least that's been my experience, but I'm not as much of a fan as you are<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

<em>no matter how hard you try you'll probably hear about the game before you see it</em> <br> <br>Last week for Game 2, I didn't hear about it.  So I am hopeful.<br>

precedent beats second-hand anecdotes every time<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-) (plus, like Mr. Brandt said, you don't want to let down your team)

Totally.<br> <br>I emailed the team asking them not to talk about the game.  I think I will keep my bag behind the bench so I can go straight to car after game and undress there, with radio turned up so I can't hear any people nearby.<br> <br>And I think I will also listen to and watch game prior to my game, because before the game it will be hard to avoid it anyway, and I won't miss anything this way.<br> <br>I am a man with a plan!

<h2>I TiVo lots of games...</h2>

Hockey playoffs especially (well, not this year).<br/><br/>I'd advise that you announce to your team, loudly and clearly, that you're taping the game and do NOT want to know anything about it.  Offer to leave the room, or to have them all over for beer and baseball afterwards (your treat), but make it clear you don't want to know anything.  This usually works for me.<br/><br/>Lucky for you, you're not still in MA otherwise it would be unavoidable, best intentions of your friends or not.  Kind of like 3rd or 4th round Stanley Cup games are around here.  The revelers in the streets usually give it away.<br/><br/>And bring a good CD to listen to in the car on the way home.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

I listen to audiobooks on iPod.  Right now listening to America: The Book from The Daily Show.

<h2>The right call</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/cbrandtbuffalo/">cbrandtbuffalo</a> on 2004-10-20T16:22:06</h3>
You made the right call. You can't let down your hockey team to watch the game.<br> <br>Our goalie had the same dilemma last year. He ran out to check the TVs at the rink between periods. I can't say much for his concentration on our hockey game, but he did show up. And he got to sit at the rink, in his pads, and watch the end of the baseball game.<br> <br>I think we lost our game and the team he was rooting for lost. Rough night for him<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)



<h2>It's obvious of course</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/btilly/">btilly</a> on 2004-10-20T16:46:05</h3>
The entire history of the Red Sox is one of snatching defeat out of victory.  What better way could there be to continue the curse of the Babe than by losing in a heartbreaker this time?<br> <br>Cheers,<br>Ben



<h2>Baseball...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/schwern/">schwern</a> on 2004-10-20T17:38:20</h3>
That's the one where they hit the ball with the stick and then run around the bases rather than back and forth, right?<br>

Yes.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)
