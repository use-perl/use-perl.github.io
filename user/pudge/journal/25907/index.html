<div class="span8">
<p>I was going to here announce my candidacy for public office, for the Charter Review Commission of Snohomish County.  Every ten years, three residents from each of the five Council districts are elected for an unpaid one-year term to propose changes to <a href="http://www.co.snohomish.wa.us/executiv/charter.htm">county charter</a>.  The local GOP had only two names to put on the ballot for my district (the seats are nonpartisan, but the parties are still involved), and so I was recommended for the position by various people.  On Monday I agreed, and on Tuesday I filled out the paperwork, and on Wednesday I prepared to file it.<br/><br/>But before I did, I was reviewing some documents, and discovered that elected county officials must be three-year residents of the county.  I've lived here since June 2003.  I wish someone had thought about that before I filled out the paperwork, but it was an educational experience, and at least I didn't actually file anything or announce my candidacy.  Or opened a bank account, or ordered any campaign materials.  That would've sucked.

<p>
I'm confused.  If you were running as a GOP candidate for public office, (a) why didn't you mysteriously "relocate" to Wyoming shortly before the filing deadline, and (b) why didn't your residency in Wyoming trump your local jurisdiction's residency requirement?

Don't make me roll my eyes at you!<br><br>Unforunately for complainers, the Constitution doesn't strictly define the requirement.  There was nothing remotely illegal or unconstitutional, nor even against the spirit of the Constitution, in what Cheney did.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:p<br>

Hey, I never implied that there was il-this, im-that or un-the-other-thing about what Cheney did.  I just thought that the GOP does its thing (relocate a candidate to Wyoming, thus increasing the state's population by 20%), while the Democrats do their thing (take a junket to Alaska to give the "My Heart Bleeds" speech that your brothers gave, or shop your platform around to every piddling little interest group to insure "political correctness").

Sorta how the Cubbies beg a dead goat for forgiveness each April and stay home each October.  It's all ritual.  Just ritual.
</p> <p>
Since you didn't actually run in this election, do you still get to do the "My Little Blue Friend" ad during the Super Bowl?  Or is that high honor reserved from someone representing the great state of Watergate<tt>^W</tt>North Carolina<tt>^W^W</tt>Kansas?

Evading the question already?  You <i>must</i> be a politician.  How soon before you're serving Shark Sandwiches?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)
