<p>I've heard this is the prettiest baby ever.  So I went and bought the People magazine with the pictures of her.  People spent $4 million on the pictures, and frankly ... well, I don't want to be cruel, but I've seen a lot of babies, and I think People got screwed.  This has to be the ugliest baby I've ever seen.  We're talking coyote ugly here.  I guess they can afford plastic surgery, but man, she's gonna have a tough life being that deformed.

It's not like you took it back and asked for your money back, did you?<br><br>If enough people acted like you did, People got their money's worth.

Actually, I didn't buy the magazine.  And I don't even know what the baby looks like, either.  The whole post was a lie.<br>

Heh.  I just got sick of the crap about this new baby and how everyone is saying it is the most perfect baby ever, and I thought how funny it would be if it turned out to be really ugly.  Of course, very few babies are ugly, but this would be one of the few.<br>

Considering Angelina and Bradd need their daily dose of make-up to look <i>picture perfect</i> (no pun intended), I hope their baby wont be hooked to eyeliner, mascara and lipstick.

ALL babies are hideously ugly.  They all look like Winston Churchill's bastard Chinese child.

Some are worse than that - one of my colleagues just had a child and he looked like margaret thatchers press secretary - bernard ingham instead of churchill... I was so taken aback that I actually blurted out "christ it's berhard ingham but shrunken by some bond vilain's ray gun!"
