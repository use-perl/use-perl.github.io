<p>TorgoX <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/TorgoX/journal/22498">complains</a> that Bush's tone is "huffy."

Note also that those stats only include government gifts, not private, and guess what: we lead the world there, too.<br/><br/>Not that we can't give more, but, as aevil is wont to say, no good deed goes unpunished, and that's the point.

<h2>GNP</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/KM/">KM</a> on 2005-01-11T23:15:50</h3>
I keep hearing about how we rank so low in aid compared to GNP, yet the same people don't say how, in a dollar amount, it's still greater than anyone else. If you give 1% of a 1000 GNP, it's still less than<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.5 of a 10000 GNP. But, that doesn't seem to matter, since the percentage is what people seem to be talking about. Everyone spins the stats to make them look good, or us look bad.<br> <br>Bush has the right to be huffy about this. If people want to complain about how much we give in aid, then the next time you need it.. don't take it from us.

I don't particularly like the huffiness, but yeah, it's understandable.<br> <br>What actually bugged me more was when they first started looking for money, came up with like $35m, said "this is only for starters," and then everyone attacked them for not giving more.  When they, a few days later, said they would give $350m (with more to come), people said, "oh, you just did that because we criticized you, and you still had a weak initial offer, so you still suck."  Just stfu.<br>

The UN figures are <a href="http://millenniumindicators.un.org/unsd/mi/mi_series_results.asp?rowID=651&amp;fID=r10&amp;cgID=" title="un.org">here</a un.org>
<p>
Its true that in the last 3 years the US has given more in absolute terms to least developed nations (prior to 3 years ago, Japan was the largest donor 7 years running). And I'm not complaining about that. More is better, no argument.
</p><p>
However, if you're going to make a comparison, using that number is silly: the US is *bigger*, and you need to scale this somehow if you want to compare their contribution. Scaling by GNI seems fair enough as its scaling on the ability to give: Norway has a higher GNI/capita than the US so it scales<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/down/ their contribution in comparison. (the <a href="http://devdata.worldbank.org/external/dgcomp.asp?rmdk=110&amp;smdk=473880&amp;w=0" title="worldbank.org">world bank</a worldbank.org> lists those figures as $38,700 and $35,400)
</p><p>
If we just scaled by population, which would tend to rate the US contribution higher, the discrepancies still pop out: 293M people versus just <a href="http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/be.html" title="cia.gov">10M in Belgium</a cia.gov>, but only gave 4x more?
</p><p>
Or, take a similar population: France, Germany, UK, Italy (total: 260M, GNI/cap around $22,000) gave double what the US did.
</p><p>
Put it this way: if Bill Gates gave double what you do to charity each year, would you consider him generous? The answer isn't a straight yes or no, and the same applies to US ODA.</p>

Let me be really simplistic about this..<br> <br>If people want to gripe about what we do/don't give.. don't ask for help when you need it (and you will ask).<br> <br>If you go by population, I'd expect China to be giving leaps and bounds more than anyone else.<br> <br>If Gates only gave double to charity each year of what I did, yes.. I would consider him generous. Why? It's CHARITY. It's not an obligation.. and any charity is more generous than none.<br> <br>Why can't people just be grateful anymore? Why does charity and aid have to be made into a global pissing contest?

<em>Scaling by GNI seems fair enough</em> <br> <br>I think comparing is stupid.  This is my main point, which KM addressed nicely.<br> <br>My secondary point is that if you must compare, we still give a hell of a lot, and as per the first point, don't bitch about it.<br> <br>My third point is that those comparison numbers do not include an area where the US gives more than most other nations: private donations (<a href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory?id=384824" title="go.com">over $200m as of Jan 5</a go.com><nobr> <wbr></nobr>... surely a lot more since, at least $280m and counting [the American Red Cross alone has $80m more today than it had on Jan 5]).<br> <br>A fourth point I didn't mention at the start was that the announced aid comes in different forms: if you exclude aid in the form of loans, and you include our military aid (to the tune of $6m/day in the tsunami efforts), then the US surpasses Australia (despite the assertions that we're giving substantially less, as many people continue to believe they are giving $1b USD instead of closer to $380m USD).  And of course once you add the aforementioned private monies, it's not even a contest anymore (which it should not have been to begin with).<br>

To repeat myself: I am NOT complaining about the amount the US gives. More is better,<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/whoever/ gives it. Charities here (in the UK) are arguing that it is not a bad thing that its become a politicial pissing contest, as it only results in more being given all round.<br> <br>The comparisons originate with the figures I pointed at, because the UN suggested a target for developed nations to reach 0.7% of GNI for overseas development aid. The US has tripled their aid in that category WHICH IS GREAT.<br> <br>In private life this same kind of target is common: in Islam, the 'zakat' asks for roughly 2.5% of your income in alms; the christian tithe of 10% has the backing of the law in several european countries.<br> <br>BTW I totally agree that the US give much more in military aid, debt relief and probably in corporate donations, but the private donations are actually comparable to elsewhere (eg $189m in the UK by 6th Jan). I don't mean to belittle US donations by that, only to say that govt aid is far larger and argues your case better (eg the US is committed via the World Bank HICP to something in the region of $20bn debt relief)

<em>It is also 42 hours of spending for the Iraq war.</em> <br> <br>You think that's interesting?  It isn't.  Comparing apples and oranges never is.<br> <br> <em>Bush proposed spending $270M on lying to kids about sex next year.</em> <br> <br>False.  Even if there is some false information in there that could possibly rise to the level of a lie, most of it is accurate, whether you agree with its aims or not.<br> <br> <em>They want to spend $100M lying about Social Security.</em> <br> <br>False.  Social security is scheduled for failure, and it begins to lose money starting in five years (that is, the trust fund will shrink beginning in five years<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... it is not for about 30 years until it actually has a deficit).<br> <br> <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/nrof_luskin/luskin200501110842.asp" title="nationalreview.com">The data shows this.</a nationalreview.com>  You can disagree with the data or its analysis, but to call it a lie is ridiculous nonsense.<br> <br> <em>They (spent) at least a million dollars lying to us about "No Child Left Behind" (the Army recruiter list).</em> <br> <br>Nothing on that page mentions any such thing, so I am not sure what you're referring to.  Maybe you refer to the fact that NCLB says that schools must give student information to Army recruiters?  How does this constitute a lie?<br> <br>My personal view of it is that it is a bit distasteful, but I add it to one of the many reasons my children won't attend government schools.  The government certainly has this right: we can't tell the federal government they have the right to give money to schools and direct their curriculum, but that they don't have the right to know who is in the schools.  It's why I am against such federal control over the schools, and why I was against NCLB (the control/money part, not the recruiter part, which just logically follows).<br> <br> <em>"Misleading" citizens seems to be a chronic condition for this administration.</em> <br> <br>That issue is far less about being misleading than it is about being covert.  Much of what they said in these propaganda spots was accurate, but the way it was done was clearly wrong.  Those spots were probably more accurate than the "Drugs Are Bad" and "Army of One" ads we've seen from the government over the years, but these were done covertly, and hence, were worse.<br> <br>I suppose you could say that by being covert they were misleading about the origins of the pieces, which is true, but different from the rest of what you've been talking about, which is the content of the messages themselves.<br> <br> <em>In short, we could easily pay for the damage if the administration would simply break one bad habit.  That "huffy" tone was a clear signal that it isn't going to happen.</em> <br> <br>We already are paying for it.  It is happening.  And we've promised more if there is more need.<br> <br>After all you've said above, I find it hard to care that you think Bush has been "lying" and "misleading" when the bulk of your evidence for it is, itself, exactly that.<br>

I have plenty of my own (indeed, in that very post you are referring to, I said I disagreed with the very notion of NCLB, which is one of Bush's most prized initiatives, which is hardly something a "totally partisan" Republican would do).  But his criticism was mostly bullshit, and I called him on it.<br>

<h2>Sex</h2>

Not arguing about the other points... but even an understatement such as: <i>there is some false information in there [sex education] that could possibly rise to the level of a lie</i> denotes in itself a health hazard. Who will pay for the moral, social and medical damage of letting abstinence-only advocates <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/usa/story/0,12271,1365262,00.html" title="guardian.co.uk">enter the schools</a guardian.co.uk> ?

Let me put it this way: every public school sex education curriculum I've seen has lies in it, which can constitute a health hazard (for example, I've seen the effectiveness of condoms wildly misportrayed in both directions).  And I firmly believe this inevitable when politicians set such policies, instead of local school boards.<br> <br>Remember, we started seeing a lot more sex and teenage pregnancy in schools in America under Clinton and his style of sex education.  The incidence of such things did not decrease.<br> <br>So you can ask your question about "who will pay?," but that question is the same regardless of which curriculum is in effect.

I hate getting in the middle of this, but I think that teen pregnancy actually went down in the 1990s. At least that's what I take from a quick look at <a href="http://www.agi-usa.org/pubs/teen_stats.html" title="agi-usa.org">this set of statistics</a agi-usa.org> (Table 2 seems to be the most relevant).

I didn't want to get into specifics, but I was speaking more of economic/regional data than overall, e.g., that they went up in inner cities and such, where sex is more common, and sex education more relevant.<br> <br>That said, yes, overall, pregnancy rates did go down (though sex rates fluctuated, from the data I've seen [which is much less reliable anyway]); and then again, there's no reason to think abstinence education will cause them to increase.<br> <br>This gets very complicated, very quickly.  For example, most of Bush's advocacy has not been for abstinence-only education, but rather for education that focuses primarily on abstinence, etc. (meanwhile, some groups don't even mention abstinence at all).

I am against all school sex education, for my kids anyway.  They will get a much better, more reasonable, broader understanding from me at home.  I don't need some idiot teacher trying -- poorly -- to explain sex to my child.  Another reason to avoid government schools.<br>

Well, yeah, but where are you getting your numbers?  Since when is the US Gov't giving <b>more</b> than everyone else?  Or more than anyone else?
<p>
I haven't been keeping track, since the issue is pointless political posturing more than it is about actual aid and relief.  As I remember it, the initial pledge from the US was $35M, when the other government aid packages were in the hundreds of millions; Japan's initial pledge was $500M.
</p><p>
After about two weeks and a conference to figure out how much the relief is going to cost, Austrailia is promising close to $1B, and other nations are revising their pledges way, way up.  This is around the time the $35M magically became $350M with more to follow.</p>

<em>Well, yeah, but where are you getting your numbers? Since when is the US Gov't giving more than everyone else? Or more than anyone else?</em> <br> <br>Well, clearly the US is giving more than many countries, by any standard.  Not sure why you're bothering with "anyone else."  But you're missing the context, which was regarding American international aid overall, not just to this one tsunami disaster.  That's what TorgoX's original quote was regarding.<br> <br> <em>As I remember it, the initial pledge from the US was $35M</em> <br> <br>No.  They first said $4M, IIRC.  They announced funds as they secured them, as they come from different places.  There was nothing remotely magical about it, it was merely a process, and there's nothing remotely bad about having such a process.<br> <br>As to Australia, half of that $1B AUD (about $750M US) is in interest-free loans, while Japan has said it will be in direct grants.<br> <br>So from government sources, the US might only be in the top five in total amount pledged, so far.  However, the US will likely end up giving more than anyone else when you include private sources, which was part of the point: the US relies more on our citizenry than many of these other nations.<br>
