<p>While travelling last week I had my cell phone out, and I set it down and couldn't find it when it came time to board.  I looked all over and thought it was just lost.  I couldn't pull all my bags apart, as I didn't have time while boarding, so it was still possible I had it.  I figured, however, I would not give it up entirely until I tried one more thing to find it.

I had been using my Bluetooth headset thingy, and I knew it had plenty of battery, so chances are if it was in the bag, the Bluetooth was still on.  So when I got into my next destination, I pulled out my laptop and did a Bluetooth device scan.  Sure enough, there it was.  Either it was in my bag, or the person who stole it was still nearby.

It was buried in my bag.
