<p>Sometimes I give up on TV shows I've liked, or tried to like.<br/><br/>I gave up on 24 a couple of seasons ago.  I came back for this season, and I like it more than I did when I gave up on it.<br/><br/>I nearly gave up on Battlestar Galactica.  It was trying way too hard early on, the performances were forced.  It just didn't work.  But it got better quickly, I think.  I stuck with it in large part because of Roland Moore, the guy behind the BG story, who was also one of the people behind the Star Trek: DS9 story, and that had a similar problem: weak beginning, but turned into a great epic.<br/><br/>Star Trek: Enterprise, on the other hand, I gave up on after the first season, and every time I went back to look again, I was sorry I did.

<p>I gave up on Enterprise after one episode.  My wife and sister in law seem to think it was pretty good, though.  I always assumed that I would catch it in repeats and enjoy it more than I did first run.  All Star Trek series are better in repeats than they were when new.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<p>Meanwhile, we've discovered <a href="http://www.newvoyages.com/" title="newvoyages.com">New Voyages</a newvoyages.com>, which we felt was impressively good.</p>
