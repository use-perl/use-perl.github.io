<p>Today UPS brings some capacitors to me so I can try to <a href="http://www.vonwentzel.net/ABS/Repair/">repair my dead graphite AirPort base station</a>.  I've essentially verified it's the two capacitors that are blown; hopefully, I can fix the sucker up.<br/><br/>I gave it to my father-in-law, and he needs it to connect to a modem connection, so third-party options are limited for replacement, and the Apple replacement costs about $200.  I could always give him mine with a modem and buy a new one, but I want one with an antenna port (which I am planning on buying soon, the Dr. Bott one), and only the $200 base station has an antenna port.<br/><br/>So I am hoping this $13.50 repair ($1 parts, the rest shipping and handling) will take care of it.<br/><br/>If I don't post a followup soon, it's because I burned my fingers and can't type.

Just in case anyone sees your posting and thinks "<em>hey, maybe that's what's wrong with my base station too</em>" they can find more info including how to visually identify blown capacitors how to effect the replacement at <a href="http://www.seanadams.com/deadairport/" title="seanadams.com">this site</a seanadams.com>.<br> <br>If you're in the same boat, you can get the replacement parts at a nearby radio shack and save shipping costs (assuming you have one nearby).<br> <br>It worked for me<nobr> <wbr></nobr><tt>:)</tt> <br> <br>-matt

I read bad things about Radio Shack capacitors, just being not long-lasting enough.  So I "splurged."<br> <br>And, it worked!  No hissing sound, and happy lights, and all is well.  I should test the modem and Ethernet ports, but I can see it in my PowerBook's AirPort menu.<br>
