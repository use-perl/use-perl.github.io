<em>Is OS 10.</em> <br> <br>No, it's not.  There is no Mac OS 10.  It is Mac OS X, version 10.<br> <br> <em>Afterall was it not common to call prior versions OS 9 etc.?</em> <br> <br>There is no version of Mac OS *after* version 9, so it isn't "prior" to anything.  Mac OS X is not Mac OS; Mac OS 9 is not a prior version of Mac OS, it is the current version.<br> <br>Mac OS and Mac OS X are different operating systems; it makes no sense to say that Mac OS X is a later version of the same OS, or that Mac OS 9 is an earlier version of the same OS.  They are not the same OS, they are different.  Hence, they have different names.<br> <br>Regardless, no, no one called it "OS 9" or "OS 8".  I'd never once heard that, until Mac OS X came along.<br> <br> <em>This of course makes<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/MacOS X v?10\.\d+/ incredibly redundant/l4m3.</em> <br> <br>It is not redundant at all, as "X" is not part of the version, it is part of the name.  It <em>sounds</em> redundant when you say it out loud, but it is not actually redundant.<br> <br>And there is no such thing operating system as "MacOS".<br>

<em>Regardless, no, no one called it "OS 9" or "OS 8". I'd never once heard that, until Mac OS X came along.</em> <br> <br><br/><br/>I did. And still do. Please don't confuse what you have never heard with what doesn't exist. In the context of "Mac OS," I find "OS 8", "OS 9", and "OS X" all perfectly acceptable.

I'm sorry if you take literally a statement like "no one ever said that," since it is impossible to take literally<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...<br> <br>And while you may find them acceptable, I do not.  You are free to find them acceptable, and I am free to think they are stupid.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

<p>To be honest, I still use the term 'System', as in System 6, System 7,

Well, that's wrong, too.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:D  I can't remember when they made the switch.  I know it was Macintosh System 7.5 and Mac OS 8.  I can't recall if 7.6 was Mac OS, or Macintosh System.

<h2>search implications</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Bumppo/">Bumppo</a> on 2002-08-28T20:54:23</h3>
I find myself holding my nose and using "OSX" in some cases because it's more readily searchable. Some crap mailing list search engines can't/don't index anything with fewer than three characters, so "Mac OS X" gets truncated to "Mac", which usually isn't specific enough.<br> <br>I was pleased to spot "Mac OS" in O'Reilly's <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/oreilly/author/stylesheet.html#M" title="oreilly.com">style guide</a oreilly.com>, after seeing it the wrong way in several books over the years. "MacOS" looks like a cereal brand.
