<p>I am normally loathe to write tests, but for Mac::Carbon, I am making an exception.  So the other night, I started working on a test suite.  It is far from exhaustive, but it is a nice beginning.  It does things like get a list of your volumes, convert them from FSSpec to paths, make sure the paths exist with <TT>-d</TT>, runs an AppleScript to get the version of the Finder, gets/sets creator/type of files, displays the amount of RAM in and the clock speed of the machine, displays a notification dialog to tell you to switch various applications to the front/back, plays a sound from a resource file, talks using the speech manager, and more.<br/><br/>I am even using Test::More, which makes life easier.  I may need to include it in MacPerl.  It's all working really well thus far.<br/><br/><ECODE>
	ok(my $h = Handle->new('xyzzy'),	'new handle');
	is($h->get, 'xyzzy',			'get handle');
	is($h->size, 5,				'handle size');
	is($h->get(2, 2), 'zz',			'get handle portion');
</ECODE><br/><br/>I just need to add some more tests for Mac::Files and Mac::MoreFiles, then clean it up (which includes making it build on machines other than this one and integrating the changes with MacPerl).  Then: profit!  I mean: release!

I started writing tests for some code here at work, and it's really really helped.  It's also kind of addictive.  The more you write, the better you feel about your code.  I find that Test::More and Test::Harness together make for a very nice testing environment, as well.

... did you find any bugs with your tests?<p>

Not that I can recall, but much of the test suite would have failed if not for detection of problems in my previous one-off tests (I wrote a lot of one-liners while working on the port).<br> <br>These modules have all been around so long (most of them for upwards of 6 years) that the bugs in them are few and far between.  I am changing very little of the modules; most of the bugs will have to do with my ported support functions (for time conversions, GUSI replacement functions, etc.) and various unique interactions with Mac OS X.<br> <br>And at least one bug remains in the tests, though I can't really detect it with Perl (the Notification Manager simply doesn't play a sound I pass to it, and the only record of this is the fact that nothing comes out of the speakers<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...).<br> <br>The test suite is just a beginning; it'd be nice to test every function in every conceivable way, but hopefully that is something other interested parties can help with.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:D<br>The most difficult modules to write tests for are Mac::Files and Mac::MoreFiles, and I imagine most bugs, if they exist, are to be found there.  And those are the ones I've not yet written tests for.<br>
