<p>I finally got my new PowerBook from Apple today.  It first went in for a sprained ankle on Dec. 19, and it came back with cancer.  Over three weeks ago they decided to replace it, and finally, it got replaced.<br/><br/>So my almost 9-month-old (well, now, over 10-month-old) PowerBook G4/667/512/30/AirPort/combo became a new PowerBook G4/867/512/40/AirPort/combo.  I lost IrDA, and gained better AirPort reception (I can now compute from the bathroom and bedroom without the external WaveLAN card, but I installed WirelessDriver just in case).  I gained a better screen, which has resolution that seems too high for my cherished Geneva 9 and ProFont 9.  I am not sure about whether or not I get a new 1-year warranty, or just something like "old warranty or 90 days, whichever is longer."<br/><br/>I spent much of today fixing the machine up again.  I am almost done with Mac OS X, just doing a fresh fink install now.  My Mac OS apps are back in place, but I need to reinstall some stuff into the Mac OS System Folder.  But I will just add things back to the System Folder as needed.  I am keeping the 10GB compressed disk image from the old system around, so I can grab things as I find I forgot them.<br/><br/>I am unhappy with Apple's repair service, which broke my computer and couldn't fix it on three trips to the repair facility.  And it took over three weeks to get me a replacement PowerBook once they decided to replace it.  All told, I was without my computer for two days shy of seven weeks.  But, I am happy to have it now.
