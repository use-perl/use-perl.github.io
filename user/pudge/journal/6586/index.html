<div class="span8">
<p>I did a build of MacPerl 5.6.1 for the first time in many moons today.  A few small test things to fix.<br/><br/>One odd thing I noticed was that something that popped up in builds for MacPerl 5.8 that I never noticed before were popping up in MacPerl 5.6, with MacPerl trying to open "Test:Harness.pm" and seeing a file ":Test" trying to open it, instead.  This causes havoc in the test suite, since there is a file called "TEST" (remember, case-insensitive!) in the t directory.  So in my test script, I move the file around depending on whether the test needs that file or not.<br/><br/>Anyway, this never happened before with 5.6, that I recall.  But there's not been a new GUSI in some time (since right before MacPerl 5.6.1r1 was released), and I would have noticed it before.  Could something else have changed?  I have no idea what, but I might look into it.  I am fairly certain this is a bug in GUSI though, so hopefully Matthias will fix it and I won't need to worry about it anymore.<br/><br/>So ... apart from that, I am now just synching up some of my work from 5.8, fixing other little bugs, etc.  Moving toward an r2, slowly, but surely.</p>
