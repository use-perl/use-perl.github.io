<p>I am testing some features of Slash, which means you will be limited to Latin-1, with no high-bit characters.  Entities/character references only!<br/><br/>This will revert back to the old way of "whatever characters you want, man" later this week, likely.

<h2>This is a test</h2>

&#171;This is a quote!&#187;



<h2>Note</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/pudge/">pudge</a> on 2003-07-29T20:27:55</h3>
High-bit Latin-1 chars will be converted to the appropriate character reference, unless there is an appropriate ASCII version hardcoded in the code (like 'curly quotes' -&gt; 'straight quotes'<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... suck it up!).<br> <br>In Extrans and Code modes (and ECODE tags), which do not allow any character references, those character references will turn into literal text, like <tt>&amp;#171;</tt>, because why would you use that character in Code anyway?  Silly.<br>

<p>Bah; curly quotes were an abomination, anyway, from the moment the Macintosh first invented them.  Or maybe from the moment the Wintel world first changed the high bit character code for them.  (Or maybe I have my history wrong....)</p>

Curly quotes are several hundred years older than the Macintosh...

<p>Yeah, but typewriters got rid of that abomination long ago.  Why people have to bring back the wild ways of the ancients is beyond me.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)</p>

The typewriter quotes <i>are</i> the abomination though...

Talking about horrible quotes, I wish <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/user/mgk25/ucs/quotes.html" title="cam.ac.uk">
`these' ugly quotes</a cam.ac.uk> would stop showing up.

<p>OH, MY, YES!!!  I hate that.  I've even seen software that does that automatically.</p>

<p>Whenever I see that I feel like the typist was just very insecure about only having straight quotes.  It really takes away my respect for their writing.</p>

<p>Also, `' may resemble quotes, but on many terminals I use, they are so big it almost looks like the author quoted like \this|.</p>

While you are testing for new features, could we get  allowed in HTML?<br>

PRE?  No, I think that won't happen.  PRE is abused and messes up entire pages.  Might as well ask me to give a loaded gun to bunch of convicted murderers.  OK, it is true that use.perl.org users are not Slashdot users, but really, PRE just causes a lot more problems than it solves.<br>

I want to post images in my journal, just like Elaine does with MT. pleasepleaseplease.  slash doesn't need to host them and if it messes up the page, it's my own fault. Even if I keep posting pictures from goats.ex.  pleasepleaseplease.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

*sigh*.  Well, I had to try whining.  I couldn't think of anything less energetic to try.
