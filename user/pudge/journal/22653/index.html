<p>I am taking every Monday off for a few months, to go skiing.  Good stuff.<br/><br/>I pulled my hamstring on Dec. 22 in a hockey game.  It did OK today on the slopes (I never go down more than intermediate anyway, so not a ton of stress, but a good amount).  I have to decide if I think it has healed enough to play this season of hockey, but I am optimistic.<br/><br/>There's a <a href="http://www.angelofthewinds.com/">casino</a> less than three miles from my house, that I didn't know about until recently.  It's not huge, but a decent size -- 22K sqaure feet, 425 slots, 10 tables -- but it's back in the woods away from any main road, so I'd never seen it.  There's also a <a href="http://www.arstc.com/">gun range</a> about seven miles away.  On a date, should I go shooting first, gambling second, or vice versa?

Well, you could ask your date for her preference.  Then you could check with your wife.</p>

Almost perfect answer.  Now that it is the 21st century, you should have said "check with your significant other".

<tt>When I last met Chris (aka pudge), he had a wife with him.&nbsp; (OSCON in 1999)&nbsp; Now that it is the 21st century (and a decade later) he might have an SO rather than a wife, but I prefer to assume that people have not changed marital status unless I have information to the contrary (and it was only half a decade later when I wrote the reply).</tt>

If you are gambling a lot of money, and aren't good at handling losses, I'd say shoot first and ask suicidal questions later, after you've run out of bullets.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>



<h2>Shooting first</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jdavidboyd/">jdavidboyd</a> on 2005-01-13T16:56:09</h3>
and shooting second.<br>
As to gambling, why do you want to throw away the money you've worked so <b>hard</b> to acquire?<br>

As noted, it's very near my house.  I am no fan of gambling, which is why I've got to check it out.<br>

I suppose if you were looking to <em>really</em> mix things up well you could shoot gamblers and then gamble with shooters, but it doesn't sound like a good idea.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
