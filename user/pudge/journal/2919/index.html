<p>Somehow, DirecTV, after I <A HREF="http://use.perl.org/user/pudge/journal/2747">adjusted my account options online</A>, decided it was time to close my TiVo account, even though I have lifetime service.<br/><br/>So I am now going on Day Two of No TiVo.<br/><br/>Try to avoid the online account changing if you can, or at least double-check what changes they make to your account for the next day or so after you make changes.

<p>Soon, it really won't matter what's on TV for you -- you'll be busy snapping pix of your new baby. And when you're done with that, you'll be 50 and it will be time to learn shuffleboard and bridge and to acquire a taste for Moxie and say things like "I never let <b>my</b> kid do that" or "this generation is dumber than a sack of hair."

</p><p>Ok. I don't have a TiVo so I have no idea what kind of withdrawals you're going through.</p>

There's a few problems with losing the TiVo, most of them having to do with the fact that right now I am recording like 15 hours per day of Olympics coverage.  OK, so I can use the VCRs.  But I would start a recording and start watching it from the beginning with the TiVo; can't do that on a VCR.  Plus, it looks much better on the TiVo.
<br>
<br>And then there's staying up late to watch shows I normally would TiVo and see the next day or something.  And then there's the fact that I don't remember what shows I was going to watch or record.  I record like 8 shows on Sundays (half politics, half Fox and HBO stuff at night, and that's not even including Nero Wolfe, which still hasn't started up again, apparently).  It's not that I can't see these things without the TiVo, but it is a lot less efficient to do so.
