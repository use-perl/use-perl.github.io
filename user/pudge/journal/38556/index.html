<p>It's been five and a half years since <a href="http://pudge.net/glob/2006/04/useperl-29236.html">I preordered <em>The Fool and His Money</em></a>, the sequel to <em>The Fool's Errand</em>, a now-22-year-old puzzle game for the Mac.

I've <a href="http://pudge.net/glob/2006/11/useperl-31482.html">dared to believe</a> it would be released before, and it never was.  However, this time there's an actual <a href="http://www.fools-errand.com/">teaser</a> available.

It's much like the original, but updated with new puzzles and graphics.  I have to say it's probably not worth six years of development time, but it is pretty cool.  It includes a <a href="http://www.fools-errand.com/05-the-fool-and-his-money/tarot-imperial.htm">card game like in the original</a>, but with new rules.  Figuring out the rules is the puzzle, so I won't tell you them, even though I mapped them all out and their scores (or most of them ... I have been unable to identify any Rhadamanthine cards but the one, and two cards appear to do absolutely nothing).  (There's also other versions of the puzzle in the game, apparently.)

Here's hoping the game is actually released this year!

<h2>did you prepay?</h2>

<p>If you also prepaid, there's some good irony there.  Or maybe that was the point of the "game"<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>
