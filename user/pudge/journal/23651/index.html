<p>I am sick of the self-important navel-gazing that is "blogging."  Today on CNN, I watched in horror as their "Blog Reporter" reported on a group of "bloggers" that is having a conference call for the mainstream media ("blogcall") to inform the media as to what they are "blogging" about.  I wish I could have made <em>any</em> of that up.<br/><br/>I've wanted to record this old Randy Stonehill song "Christine," because I think it is funny and because I think that with a few small word changes it says a lot of what I think about "bloggers."  Without further ado: <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/pudge/#Christine">Christine</a>.</p>

What is it lately about the growing Sally Field-esque "YOU LIKE ME!" kind of insecurity with the blogerati trying to push blogging. There's money to be made I suppose, but the really interesting thing today is how many of them have been circle jerking to Sifry's nice little bar chart of how many new blogs per day are being created and not one of them linked to Gallup's findings [ http://gallup.com/poll/content/?ci=15217 ] that basically finds that most people either don't know or don't give a damn about blogs.



<h2>Sick of CNN?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/mary.poppins/">mary.poppins</a> on 2005-03-15T06:41:46</h3>
Perhaps a more appropriate reaction would be to be sick of CNN.  The way to deflate self-important publishers is to ignore them; apparently CNN is not doing this.  Every time I'm at an airport and they've got CNN blaring noises at me at the gate, I end up watching for a bit (since it's too loud to ignore, and I don't have one of those universal-remote-turner-offer things).  CNN typically is showing the latest on some celebrity, or footage of a politician giving a meaningless speech, or random pundits spouting incorrect things.<br> <br>Personally, I don't watch CNN, and do read a number of blogs regularly.  None of these bloggers, however, claim to be the <i>New Thing</i> that everyone <i>Has Got To Get Into</i>.  Though some of them (such as <a href="http://fafblog.blogspot.com/" title="blogspot.com">Fafblog</a blogspot.com>) do make fun of such bloggers.
