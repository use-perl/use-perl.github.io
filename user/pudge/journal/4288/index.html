Subject: Re: [use Perl] use Perl user password for vulpes_aureus<br/><br/>No matter what I put in the password field your fricken machine rejekts me.  Your system stinks, becouse it never veryfied the password!  Other places, it has to be entered twice, and if no mach repeat it.  You tell to chanege the password, but how can be change you give no clue!<br/><br/>pudge@perl.org wrote:<br/><br/>Your new password is xxxxxxx.  Your old password will still work until

<p>you took the time to insert it here...and didn't even remove the sender's name to protect the innocent. Cruel and unusually mean. If I did this for every dumb email conversation at CPAN I'd have an even more excrutiatingly dull journal.</p>

Whatever.



<h2>To protect the &quot;innocent&quot;</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Simon/">Simon</a> on 2002-04-18T15:40:35</h3>
Odd. I don't regard people who send me gratuitiously abusive mail as "innocent".

<p>I've refused requests from the FBI et. al for email pertaining to real crimes not just some ego wanking of some perl people....email shouldn't be treated so lightly and be posted so publicly without consent.</p>

<p>Besides, weren't you the guy who couldn't take a joke and whined on about how unappreciated you are recently? I'll bet there are a few similar emails from you floating around the net just waiting to surface with your name on them. Noone around here is innocent, which is why it's stupid, unentertaining and offensive to certain unwritten rules of courtsey which seem to have all been forgotten.</p>

<h2>That was a bit unneccesary</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Elian/">Elian</a> on 2002-04-18T14:20:42</h3>
Especially as he may well not be at fault. Netscape 6 and many versions of Mozilla are completely unable to log into use.perl. (And slashdot, and presumably any Slash-based site) Dunno why, and it's damned annoying when you get a version that does it, but there's no hint to the user that the browser is at faut.<br> <br>(FWIW, I've reported this to you at least once though it's probably a browser problem and not Slash's)<br> <br>Yeah, he was obviously frustrated and rude as a result, but that's no reason to slam him quite so publically, complete with e-mail address.

I don't care what his problem is.  He was rude.  I posted the example of being rude.  I don't care what his email address is.  Go away.

flies, honey, and vinegar anymore?

I just had someone try and ping flood me last
night after I told him to ask his CGI question
somewhere other than EFnet #perl (for those
not familiar, the channel has a longstanding
policy that web and CGI questions are verboten
since most of them are FAQs or not really
perl related).  He earned himself a nice letter to his university's abuse account; maybe next time he won't throw a tantrum when
someone doesn't give him free support.
