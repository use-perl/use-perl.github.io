<p>I ordered the DVDs from Amazon, but I was bummed to learn they are in 4:3 ratio.  Just like all my other sports DVDs.  Why don't they take the HD 16:9 ratio and use that for the DVDs?  Seems stupid not to.<br/><br/>However, I was pleased to see the <a href="http://shop.mlb.com/product/index.jsp?productId=2020502">picture on the MLB web site</a>, because I was thinking, "I should print up box scores for when I watch the games," but I saw each DVD has the complete box score on the back of its individual case.  Smarties!

<h2>No 16:9?!?!</h2>

Well, that just significantly reduced the chances that I'll buy the set...  as you pointed out, they <i>have</i> the 16:9 formatted footage, it just doesn't make sense to me that they wouldn't use it.  Let those of us who have 16:9 TVs enjoy it in its proper glory! (albeit with less resolution than the original HD signal)



<h2>16:9</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ziggy/">ziggy</a> on 2005-07-23T22:46:54</h3>
They're still remastering the video for 16:9.  Expect it to be available in 6-18 months (after everyone has already bought the 4:3 version).  Just in time for everyone to be demanding HD-DVD instead.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)

I don't really care about HD-DVD.  Sure, it would be nice, but regular DVD does a great job.  Maybe when I see it for the first time I will change my mind.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

It might seem expensive to have to shell out $90 for two nearly identical DVD sets, but just remember you can amortize the cost over 80 years...

I figure I'd sell the original on eBay or somesuch, then end up paying like $120-$130 total.
