<p>I just watched the Star Wars trilogy on DVD.  I'd heard about how they changed Han Solo from making a preemptive attack on Greedo, but I didn't know they removed the <a href="http://tribute4tasha.50megs.com/ewok_song.html">Yub-Yub song</a> from the end of Return of the Jedi!  And just when I thought that was the worst Lucas could do ... they show Hayden Christensen as the spirit form of Anakin Skywalker.<br/><br/>George Lucas, you, sir, are a cad.

They actually put Hayden Christensen in as Anikin? Why the hell can't Lucas just leave it alone.

<h3><a href="/user/chromatic/">chromatic</a> on 2004-12-30T08:15:22</h3>
<p>Lucas always envisioned Christensen as Vader, despite the fact that the first movie predated the actor by a few years, Christensen turning two the year the third movie actually came out.</p>

Nothing in that boxed set offended me too much. Let's just hope 3 is better than 2, and that it doesn't suffer from the Matrix 2/3 syndrome.

I can say only that either you're simply trolling us, or you never saw the original movies (not the "special edition" versions) in the theatre in a proper manner.
<p>
What Lucas has done to the classic movies is akin to rewriting Little Red Riding Hood so that she is killed by the wolf.  Horrors!
</p><p>
Just another guy who saw the <i>real</i>Star Wars in a movie theatre in 1977-78-79, losing count at the number of times...</p>

No trolling, I promise.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br/><br/>I've never seen an original in the theatres. For that matter, I'm not sure what they ever played on TV (the original, or the second wave of barely changed versions on VHS) that I've seen many many times.<br/><br/>I did try to follow all the "what's changed" reviews. I guess I just don't care religously about the changes because I understand most of them from a continuity standpoint; esp. putting Hayden in the endscene.<br/><br/>With that said, I think it sucks that we can't get a DVD set of the original, unmolested versions too.

<p>I wish he had just touched them up to digital and left everything alone!!! I have yet to see the 3rd movie but Hayden as Vader?! That is like writing code in Python!  Eeeeeek!

</p><p>I am glad that I didn't buy them...</p>
