<p><a href="http://use.perl.org/user/TorgoX/journal/24360">TorgoX</a> loves to say nonsensical and insupportable things like "Bush is a fascist."  Oh, he doesn't come right out and say it, because saying what you mean is so gauche.<br/><br/>But really, my point in writing is to rebuke his silly attack on global warming skeptics.  In this case, something brand new pops up, and he expects people to immediately recognize it as proof of some case.  He decries that people should actually take time to study the evidence.  It's amazing to me that people can take this stance at the same time they criticize people for supposedly ignoring science.  He is, in fact, asking people to ignore science by jumping to conclusions about what this evidence means.<br/><br/>Take his sentence, "The data from the icecores will be denied."  Maybe, but maybe that will be because it is actually flawed.  Who can say, before the fact?  '"More research" will be needed.'  Maybe because the initial research was incomplete.<br/><br/>I could make equally damning charges of the other side.  How about: the data from the icecores will be said to prove that global warming is caused by man.  They will say no more research is needed, that the case has been proved absolutely.<br/><br/>I take it back, that is not equally damning, it's more damning.  And at least as true.<br/><br/>And as side note, the title of that article, "900,000-year-old ice may destroy US case on Kyoto," is false.  The case against Kyoto was never that we don't need to reduce pollution, but that Kyoto was a piss-poor way to do it, for many reasons, including -- but not limited to -- the fact that "developing nations" were significantly exempted, and that the U.S. would be harmed more than most developed nations in that the baseline data used for reduction targets was taken just before the latest U.S. economic boom, which makes U.S. targets far greater -- even proportionate to the amount of pollution produced -- than the others.<br/><br/>You could make the case, perhaps, that the U.S. should have to reduce proportionally more because it is the baseline that matters, and it is just unlucky for the U.S. that it has so much further to go.  But then why not make a similar argument for developing nations?  Clearly, there are some factors that are, if not more important than the need to reduce pollution, mitigating of it, but they pretend -- in the case of the U.S. -- that reducing pollution is all that matters, so suck it up!<br/><br/>Of course, the greatest argument against Kyoto is simply that the U.S. doesn't need an international treaty to fix its problems, and therefore we are better off doing it on our own.  I'd vote against it for that reason alone.  But I'm cool like that.

So you're saying pollution doesn't cross borders?  If I dump toxic waste in the Rio Grande, it will know to stop at the Mexican border?  If we release smoke into the atmosphere, it will know not to go over the ocean?

Rather, you don't understand it, so it seems nonsensical.<br> <br>Of course pollution can be a problem that crosses borders.  So too with many things, such as the economy.  If the U.S. has to have certain pollution standards for Mexico's sake, does Mexico have to have a certain economic standard of living for the U.S.' sake?<br> <br> <em>Pollution is not a local problem, and shouldn't be treated like one.</em> <br> <br>What does that mean?  The U.S. should follow some international agreement to do something it doesn't want to do?  If so, then how could that treaty or law ever be ratified, if it is not something we want to do?  And if we want to do it, why do we need an international agreement?<br> <br>Or maybe you think it should be imposed on the U.S. against its will.  How do you propose this should happen?  This would be a direct assault on the very notion of democracy.<br> <br>Kyoto was a terrible idea.  If the U.S. citizens want to cut down on pollution, they can vote for laws and politicians who would make laws that will cut down on pollution.  If they do not want to cut down on pollution, then the principle of democracy says that no such cuts should happen.  And if some other country doesn't like it, it is their right to introduce sanctions against us or attempt to come to a common agreement where we would get something in exchange for a change in our behavior.<br> <br>This is how the real world works, but it not how Kyoto works, which is why it never had a chance of passage.  And don't blame Bush for it not passing: the Senate never would have passed it, not under Clinton, not under Bush, not when the Democrats had a majority in the Senate, not when the Republicans had a majority.<br> <br>If you want to blame someone, blame the people of the U.S. who don't want such terribly drastic cuts that would seriously hurt our economy.<br>

Agreements, be it between people or nations, are all about not doing what one wants to do. Compromises. Living together. My freedom ends where my neighbour's begins.

Realize the context: we are relating to the acts of a national government.

Being a democracy sometimes means doing what people and business don't want.

Everybody else managed to pass Carbon laws and targets despite the 'huge economic harm'.
<br> <br>
Also the developing nations pollution is negligable in comparison to the United States - even China and Russia Pollute less than the united states.
<br> <br>
Finally what with the US claiming to be the last superpower and guardian of freedom, etc self-policing, etc the magnaminous thing to do would be to sign up.. but no it has too many special interests.
<br> <br>
Finally you can't blame the voters - Washington and particularly Bush and the Republicans have such strong links with the oil industry and other major pollutors that even if the american people asked for green laws they would never get them.
<br> <br>
Its not about american democracy and freedom its about american corporate self interest, corruption and a bad choice at the last election.

I can't see another reasonable way to describe the idea that we can only cut our pollution through an international agreement, instead of handling it on our own.

Well, there's two primary parts, meant to address two different problems.<br> <br>The first, which most people say won't fix SS, is the personal accounts.  What is true is that it won't fix SS *solvency* problems, which is a straw man, as it is not meant to  (well, in truth, it could help prevent future solvency problems, as it will reduce the long-term liabilities at the same time it is reducing the revenues, making it easier to manage, but that's not really the point of it).  It's meant to help fix the problem of SS being a raw deal for many people, by allowing them to opt out if they choose.<br> <br>The second, which certainly will help fix SS solvency problems, is changing the benefits structure.  To say this won't help fix SS is ridiculous, since it address the problem directly: as expenses overtake revenues, we reduce expenses.<br> <br>What confuses a lot of people is that they see this big looming transition cost, but it's financially sound.  You're not paying more, you're just paying it up front, instead of down the road, which actually means it costs less.  A lot of people think it makes the whole thing cost more, which is just false.  It just moves the costs up front.  Of course, that sounds great -- and it is -- as long as we can find a way to pay for it up front, which so far no one's been able to do.<br>

That constitutes an attack? I don't want to attack views I want everyone to agree with me,I do not even care about that very much.<br> <br>If Kyoto isn't a sensible first step to reducing greenhouse gases(and saving the world) or at least  making oil last a little longer until we can come up with something we can use for more than a generation or two then why did 141 countries  ratify it?

<em>That constitutes an attack?</em> <br> <br>Of course.  You were sarcastically denigrating my view by parodying it.<br> <br> <em>If Kyoto isn't a sensible first step to reducing greenhouse gases(and saving the world) or at least making oil last a little longer until we can come up with something we can use for more than a generation or two then why did 141 countries ratify it?</em> <br> <br>You started with the straw man fallacy, and now you've moved to the appeal to authority fallacy.<br>
