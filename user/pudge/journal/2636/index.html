<p>I am attempting to order the Patriots' Super Bowl DVD from nflshop.com and it is taking forever.  I ordered a present from nationalgeographic.com and it was similar.  What's up with these commerce sites?  Did they hire the e-trade monkey to man them?<br/><br/>pdcawley asked if I was going to watch the game twice!  No, the DVD does not have the complete game, it has season highlights.  Besides, I have the game on the TiVo and plan on watching the game dozens of times.  It's the first Super Bowl my daughter's been alive for, and she'll get to see it many times.  Hopefully this year will also mark her first championships for hockey and baseball, too.  :)<br/><br/><A HREF="http://use.perl.org/user/hfb/journal/2620">hfb</A>++ came over to watch the game (she lives in MA and lived many years in St. Louis, she couldn't lose) and brought us some nice* baby clothes for our daughter.  But I must say, while I can understand the feelings the bloke from alt.talk.bizarre has about childrearing, I can quite honestly say I share none of them.  Coming clean for me about my feelings for my forthcoming baby girl entails no negative sentiment of any kind, especially since she is coming into a world where the New England Patriots are champions of the world!<br/><br/>* They really are nice; it's a rather poor word, but I can't think of another.  I can't write "cute" because that's too unmanly for me to write.  If I wrote "splendid" or "delightful" I would have had to kick myself out of my own Super Bowl party.  So "nice" will have to suffice.  :)</p>

<h2>cute is a good word :)</h2>

<p>The store reeked of 'cute' and I'm still not sure which is scarier; just the act of shopping in a baby store or thinking that I was becoming jealous of the kids these days who get such cute clothes as the 60s had really really ugly 'fashion'. I'm glad you liked them. I tormented Jarkko for about 45mins while trying to pick out something cute<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) </p>

<p>And Mr. Vogel is...not entirely serious you know<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) Don't worry the pod people replaced him with a parental model weeks ago<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>
