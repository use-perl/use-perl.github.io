<p>Well, I didn't get a lot done this week.  Long hours at work, plus meetings, plus cleaning out my den, and I just couldn't get up for it.  However, Thomas Wegner did give me a working patch to File::Glob, which made my week.  And I spent tonight working on a first go at an installer, using MindVision's VISE.<BR><BR>It is very cool; they give free licenses to share/freeware developers (good for one year; I just give them a copy of the installer so they can verify it meets their criteria, which it already did before, since Matthias used it), and then I can make all the installers I want for MacPerl for a year.  Then I just renew in another year to make more.<BR><BR>Also very cool is the relatively new web-based installer.  I create a little 276k installer app, and then the user downloads it and selects what he wants to install: PPC, 68K, Fat, MPW, whatever.  Then the user selects a location to download from (I will put in a bunch of CPAN mirrors from around the world), and then the app downloads what is needed.  I tested it tonight and it worked great.  Very nice.<BR><BR>I plan on distributing the one tiny web installer, and the full installer with everything in it, so users can choose which to download.<BR><BR>I also need to look at the Updater functionality at some point; it might be cool to have an Updater that can update all of the standard modules (maybe other modules, too?) to the last versions, etc.  Mmmmm.  That comes later, but I am going to read up on it now so I know if I need to do any preparation beforehand.</p>
