<p>I never got around to figuring out how to do remote Apple events with Mac OS X.  All I knew is that the old method from Mac OS of filling in a complex data structure didn't work.<br/><br/>It worked great on Mac OS, but wouldn't work on Mac OS X.  So tonight I decided to figure it out, and I did.  Instead of packing the data structure, I just construct a URL.  That's all.  Something like <TT>eppc://pudge@mac.example.com/Finder</TT>.  And Mac::Glue makes it even simpler:<br/><br/><ECODE>
# normal way, for local Finder
$finder = new Mac::Glue 'Finder';<br/><br/># method for remote Finder
$finder = new Mac::Glue 'Finder', eppc => Finder => 'mac.example.com';
</ECODE><br/><br/>That's it.  Then use <TT>$finder</TT> as though it were local.  Of course, there is the issue of security.  You can pass the username and password to the constructor, or just pass the username and get a dialog box asking for the password.  If neither is included, you'll get a dialog box, too.  Either way, click "Add to Keychain?" and you never have to see the dialog box again, for that username/hostname combination.<br/><br/>There's also a place in the URL for specifying UID or PID, in those cases where more than one app of that name is running.  I tested this and it didn't work, it just chose one and sent the event to that app every time, no matter what.  Hm.<br/><br/>Regardless, it's working.  Send events to your other Macs.  Astound your friends.  Requires today's newly updated Mac::Carbon, Mac::AppleEvents::Simple, and Mac::Glue.</p>
