<p>The New England Patriots have won every NFL game, since the merger, ever played in February.  I don't just mean every game they've played in: I mean every NFL game that's been held in February.<br/><br/>Also, every playoff game Brady's played in, he's won by three, unless the opponent was Pittsburgh (7 and 14) or Indianapolis (10 and 17).<br/><br/>Patriots 24, Eagles 21.</p>

<h2>Go Patriots!</h2>

Normally, I would pull for the NFC team.  However, ever since Green Bay's "4th and 26" debacle, and the subsequent Philly trolling, I've come to dislike the Eagles.
<p>
Go Pats!</p>

Pudge, that is scary.

Anyway, CONGRATS!</p>

Thanks Pudge, that's a good one.

<p>
This was the first Superbowl to end the first quarter scoreless, they said.</p>

Hmm. Never trust a sports announcer's "records" unless he thanks his statistician by name!
<p>
So how many February games since NFC/AFC were renamed?</p>

I don't know if there were any before the merger, but I could not find out, so I didn't want to assume there were none.

<p>It was the first Superbowl to end the <b>third</b> quarter with scores tied. That I do remember.</p>
