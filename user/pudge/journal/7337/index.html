<p>In the latest Who's Who book, they used four times more to describe Hillary Clinton's accomplishments than they did for Bill Clinton's.  Heh.
Who's Who seems pretty stupid to me though.  If you are really someone "important," you don't need to be in the book; if you aren't someone "important," then you don't deserve to be in the book.  In theory, anyway.  In reality, anyone who gives them money to have an entry published is "important."

<p>I'd just like to point out that the <a href="http://www.worldwhoswho.com/" title="worldwhoswho.com">online edition</a worldwhoswho.com> that's just been released uses mason and mod_perl to run.

<i>In the latest Who's Who book, they used four times more to describe Hillary Clinton's accomplishments than they did for Bill Clinton's. Heh.</i> <br> <br>Interesting trivia ++:-)<br> <br>Do you know who wrote this entries? I have no idea about the American way of doing <i> importance business</i>, but at least in some European who's whos the entry is basically written by the submitter, and the submitter usually is the (semi)important person itself. Maybe different in the case of Presidents, Kings and other doubtless important people.<br>

It is essentially the case that you can have printed there about yourself whatever you wish; if I had to guess, I'd say Hillary wrote her own (or one of her people did) and Bill had them do it for him.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)
