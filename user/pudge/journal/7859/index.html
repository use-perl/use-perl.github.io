<p>I often don't take advantage of the fact that plates are round.<br/><br/>Rather than rotating a plate to more easily get to the food that isn't closest to me, I usually reach across the plate, sometimes contorting my wrists to get at the food.<br/><br/>I wonder how much time and energy I've wasted doing this, over my life.  Who else has this problem?  How much wasted time and energy goes into similar activities?  How many people keep their mousepad too far away instead of just sliding it closer to the keyboard, just because they are too lazy or careless to move the coffee cup out of the way?  Do we bend at the waist to tie our shoes instead of kneeling?  Could we have stopped September 11 from happening if all of us were just a little more diligent?

<h2>Laziness ?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/rafael/">rafael</a> on 2002-09-20T13:42:32</h3>
Real laziness : you write a Perl one-liner to rotate your plate for you. (Using Voice::Recognition from CPAN, of course. Or maybe PSI::ESP<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)



<h2>Just the opposite</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ct/">ct</a> on 2002-09-20T20:03:06</h3>
My wife once commented that I can't eat a meal set in front of me unless I've rotated the plate 180 degrees. My plate rarely stays in one place during the meal as I eat Around it.<p>

Of course, I'm a big fat guy, so my opinion is perhaps not relevant. Or perhaps it's more relevant. Decision on that topic is left as an exercise for the reader.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>
