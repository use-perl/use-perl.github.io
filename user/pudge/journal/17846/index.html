<p><A HREF="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/crimson1/2004/03/08#a1243">Dave Winer wants Atom to join forces with RSS</A>.  I pointed out the fact, in the comments, that this defeated part of the point of Atom, which is to get away from Dave.  He deleted my comment.<br/><br/>At least he is interested in having an honest discussion about the real issues involved.  (*cough*)  I know it doesn't sound like personality conflicts are real issues, but in Dave's case, they are.  Without Dave and his intolerable personality, Atom would not exist.  The Atom developers would already have worked with him to turn RSS into something better, instead of starting a separate project.<br/><br/>To have any discussion of merging the projects without discussing Dave's personality and his influence over the final result makes no sense whatsoever.

<h2>Atom is nice</h2>

I avoid XML as much as possible and the other day I set up an Atom feed out of boredom when I was screwing with the RSS feeds that validated but which people complained didn't work. Atom does what RSS should have done but never did and it works for those of us who don't really give a damn about RSS, XML, or the scathingly ugly pissing match between the two sides of the war. They should just ignore him and his ugly RSS as Atom is nice and I'm pretty certain it will catch on soon enough.

I've not yet touched Atom, because I am too busy with "real work," but once it is out of beta or whatever, I hope to add it to Slash.

<p>Well, he _does_ say:</p> <blockquote><div> <i>If you make a personal statement about anyone I will delete your post.<br>No strikethrough's, no pleading to take the high road. Just deletion.<br>So stick to technology, formats, protocols, software, user issues, etc.<br>If you make a personal statement, the whole post will be deleted.</i> </div></blockquote> <p>But, as you say, it's impossible to discuss this in any meaninful way without bringing Winer's personality into it.</p>

<em>Well, he _does_ say<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...</em> <br> <br>But he didn't delete a comment where someone praised him, only when someone criticized him.  And when called on it, he asked the guy to "edit" his comment instead of just deleting it.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

Wow.  He's being an asshole even in how he insists that everyone pretend he wasn't and isn't an asshole.  Man, that guy is a real piece of work.
