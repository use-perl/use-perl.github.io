<p>Thanks for all the kind words about my song at the debate.  In case you missed it, here's a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5_7nWgcSjE">snippet of the debate showing my song, the candidates reaction to it, and me in the audience</a>.<br/><br/>There were front-page (below the fold!) stories in the local <a href="http://heraldnet.com/article/20071129/NEWS01/711290037">Everett Herald</a> and <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2004043711_youtubestar30m.html">Seattle Times</a>, along with mentions by Rush Limbaugh and others.  And I was interviewed by Melissa Long on CNN Live.  That video is in my <a href="http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=123A7F0F309178DF">YouTube playlist covering the debate and my trip</a>.<br/><br/>I also have some reaction videos at the end of the playlist, where I talk a bit about my thoughts on the whole thing, especially the reaction to my song, and about General Kerr ("the Gay General").<br/><br/>Speaking of my videos and General Kerr, I think I have the very first video of him after it came out that he was related to the campaign.  I asked him in the spin room right after my interview on CNN Live whether he was a "plant" of the Hillary campaign.  It's there in the playlist too.

NPR mocked you while I was having my coffee during 'Morning Edition.' I think it was Linda Wurstheimer (not sure on the spullin') who made a snarky comment about guys with guitars that I cannot recall well enough to quote but I nearly spewed my coffee when I heard you singing.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:D

Ha.  I heard Mara Liasson talk about it, said my song was one of her favorite moments, and I like Mara a lot, so that works.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)
