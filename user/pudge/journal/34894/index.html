<p>In a <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/pudge/journal/34777">recent journal entry</a> I noted the Boston sports teams are doing pretty well.  Since then, the Celtics have started the season 6-0, and the Patriots have gone to 9-0.  And the Bruins have slipped a bit in the standings, having lost some close games.<br/><br/>I paraphrased The Simpsons, saying, "The Patriots are still winning, dominant as ever.  The Celtics picked up some major stars, the Red Sox have the best record in the league, and the Bruins ... well, we love the Bruins."<br/><br/>Here's a song by Ryan Parker noting the same basic thing, from a different perspective: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbsOcEm7Rzs">Thank Goodness for the Bruins</a>.

In the spirit of taking offense.....<br/><br/>My god. Boston sports fans will be the death of me. If it isn't Bill Simmons complaining about the officiating in the Patriots *win* over the Colts, it's fans like you pointing out that *one* team in Boston isn't perfect. GAAAAHHHH!!

I wasn't pointing it out, I was linking to a non-Boston-fan who was pointing it out.<br><br>Also, I'd trade in this year's success of all the other teams for a dominant Bruins team!<br><br>

Hockey is a sport to which I never became attached; probably because I wasn't raised playing/watching it. However, I can see the attraction. I'm intrigued by the Celtics because of the the Ray Allen  connection to Seattle. Boston seems like a perfect fit for him because he can throw 3-point daggers without having to be the man every day. I have mixed feeling about the Patriots. Part of me wants me to see them get beat a couple of times by mediocre teams in order to quash the endless talk or best team ever and such. The other part of me inexplicably wants root for them because they've stirred such ire for basically nothing else than being good.

They are a great team, mostly great guys, and I am just thoroughly enjoying their run, because I know it won't last forever.  I was rooting for the Patriots when I lived in California and the Niners ruled, and the Patriots were 1-15.  I don't gloat about the Pats today, but I do enjoy them.<br><br>
