<p>I've heard a lot of people compare George Bush to Hitler and Big Brother and say that the U.S. is one of the least free countries in the world.  If that were true, you'd think people would be afraid to, you know, say so.  Or that if they did say so, something bad would happen to them.  <a href="http://pudge.net/tunes/tracks/George%20Bush%20is%20Hitler.mp3"><em>George Bush is Hitler</em></a> is a gentle reminder that people who talk about Bushitler are totally bay.<br/><br/>I wrote and recorded this song within just a couple of hours last night, after watching Marilyn Manson tell Henry Rollins that we are getting ever-closer to <em>1984</em>.<br/><br/><blockquote>
<b><a href="http://pudge.net/tunes/tracks/George%20Bush%20is%20Hitler.mp3">George Bush is Hitler</a></b>
George Bush is Hitler
He killed six million Jews
George Bush is Hitler
He wants to kill me and you
George Bush is Hitler
Hey gypsies, you are next
Everybody knows
George Bush is Hitler<br/><br/>Bush is Big Brother
He watches you all day
Bush is Big Brother
He hears everything you say
Bush is Big Brother
He changed the words to this song
Everybody knows
Bush is Big Brother<br/><br/>Bush stole our freedom
We can't protest his ways
Bush stole our freedom
Armed guards make us obey
Bush stole our freedom
I live in an internment camp
And everybody knows
Bush stole our freedom
</blockquote><br/><br/>Listen to more <a href="http://pudge.net/tunes/">PudgeTunes</a>!<br/><br/>(Oh, and Mr. Colbert, I still don't accept your apology.  This song proves that Hungarians can play guitar, and you have offended me and should be fired.  I was working on another song to dedicate to you, but now ... I just don't know.)

<h2>a clever ploy</h2>

You are just trying to preempt any possible followups by mentioning "Hitler" in your initial message.<br>

Oh, but there are so many more words to use.  "Fascist," for example!<br><br>But then I would have to add a new verse to the song.<br>

<p>Excellent song, and I would love a fascist verse.</p>

It's elegant and refined. It's on topic. It's Pudge!

knew that.  I'll give you some hints of who does.<br>1. He's a gas bag<br>2. Talks from the side of his mouth<br>3. If he invites you to go hunting, decline.

So<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... you think Dick Cheney is Hitler?<br><br>Do you think that makes you look more, or less, sane than those who think Bush is Hitler?
