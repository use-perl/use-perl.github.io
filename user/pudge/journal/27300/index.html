<div class="span8">
<p>Shootouts in hockey are lame.  Yes, they are exciting.  But they are also anti-climactic.<br/><br/>It's like if you are watching Star Wars, and right after Leia gives the medals to Han and Luke, Chewie took out a sword and cut her head off.<br/><br/>Tonight I saw my first regular season NHL shootout, and before it even started, I was thinking, "65 minutes of hard-fought hockey, and it comes down to <em>this</em>?"  Six guys and two goalies isn't hockey.  It's a sideshow.<br/><br/>Hockey is teamwork, offense and defense.  If one team plays better as a team than the other, but the other has a better goalie or a better shooter, then the latter team has the advantage in the shootout.<br/><br/>People say they needed to get rid of ties.  Maybe for marketing reasons, but I don't get it.  They say people left unsatisfied when ties result.  Good, they should, because it's a lame ending.  But I don't feel satsified after a shootout, either.  And not just because my team lost; if the Bruins had won, I'd have feel like we'd stolen a free point.  Which is better I suppose, but not enough that it warrants screwing up the game.<br/><br/>Of course, it's not about the game.  It's about marketing the game to people who don't already like it.  And those people love shootouts, unfortunately.

I think you find it lame because there is no real shoot-out tradition in US sports.<br><br>In European sports it is a common element in games, especially in play-off soccer games. They have an overtime of twice 15 minutes and if the match is still tied, it's penalty shooting.<br><br>One can muse about the injustice of winning or losing a game based on a duel between goalie and the one shooting. But some of the most memorable games in football have actually been decided that way. It's the occasion where heroes and deadbeats are born and some incidents during such shoot-outs are still talked about 20 years later. But then it may be different in soccer where the goalie statistcally only has a chance of maybe 20% or so to save a shot.<br><br>It's also great when you're watching a match between two teams you don't really care about.<br><br>We don't have it in regular season games, though. They tried to reduce the amount of ties by introducing the three-point scheme. You get three points for a victory instead of two. That means a tie (worth one point) is now less useful to either of the two teams than it used to be before.

s/US sports/North American sports/<br/><br/>If Europeans like shootouts, more power to them in their leagues.  I intensely dislike shootouts for all the reasons Chris outlines: basically it's a chintzy way to decide a game where two teams have fought equally hard over 65 minutes, *and* I see no reason to _force_ a winner and a loser through a clunky mechanism that artificially reduces a team game to individual efforts.  I cannot fathom why ties are unacceptable to so many people.

Instead, an win and overtime win are both worth 2 points, and overtime loss is one point.  I'd prefer an overtime win be worth two, overtime loss worth one, and you need to win in regulation to get three.  So every game is worth three points, period.<br>

Only they don't call them "ties" anymore.  If the score is tied at the end of regulation, each team still gets one point, just like before.  All the overtime and shootout stuff after that is simply to decide who gets the one bonus point.

At least the resurrected NHL (Neo-NHL?) are giving a <b>bonus</b> point, in <b>addition</b> to the 2x1pt for tie. None of the 3 points on offer for a clear winner are evaporating at end of game.

<p>When the MLS tried Shootouts to get overtime-happy Americans to watch the first few seasons, they gave <b>only</b> one point to <b>only</b> the winner of the shoot-out, so the loser of the shoot-out did <b>not</b> get a point for a tie. Two points evaporated when it went to shoot-out.

</p><p>MLS dropped shootouts, reverting to international standard 1pt for a tie. Turns out TV Networks preferred a clean schedule -- 90minutes playing time fit nicely in 2 hours air time with no timeouts except for rare <i>bad</i> injury -- to a definite winner.  They'll put up with a variable length game from NFL and MLB, but 2nd tier sports (in America) like Soccer (World Football), Lacross, (Field) Hockey, and Boxing-on-Ice (Hockey) need to fit the schedule.

</p><p>I would predict the TV execs will axe the shootouts<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... unless shoot outs pad the average game length to a nicer value. (3*20+2*[BREAK]+shootout]= ??

</p><p>FYI, MLS retains OT only for post-season play, per FIFA standard, with normal playing OT for 15+15 minutes before a shootout.</p>

Any win -- regulation, overtime, shootout -- is two points.  A loss in regulation is no points, otherwise is one point.  And there are no ties.<br><br>I'd love it to be either what we had before -- win is two, tie is one, and no shootout or points for overtime loss -- or have a win in regulation be three, a loss in regulation none, and a win in overtime/shootout be two, and a loss in overtime/shootout be one.  Or better yet, a tie be one for each, with the final point simply lost to the ether since neither team was worthy to claim it.

OHHHH.
<p>So nominally it's 2pts on offer, but if you lose in overtime or shoot-out you get a point you get a point <b>and</b> the winner gets one too, so teams could conceivably increase their expected value of points by conniving to tie in regulation and only start playing in OT !?  That's wrong, yeah.</p>

Each team can still only get a max of two, but the total amount of points that the two teams will get increases by one after regulation.  So yeah, in theory, the Bruins and Maple Leafs could have agreed before Monday to go to OT, and have the Leafs win at home in OT, and then tomorrow to have the Bruins win at home.  A guaranteed three points for both teams is better than each risking getting none to try for four!<br>

<p>
you're upset with shoot outs wouldn't be because the Bruins lost would it?
</p>
<p>
All kidding aside I'm assuming that you're talking about the Toronto vs Boston game. It was also my first time seeing a regular season shoot out and I have to say I agree with you. However, if the shoot out causes the teams to work harder in the 5 minute OT period I'm all for it.
</p>
<p>
Watching OT in last nights game was very exciting, almost playoff OT exciting. You could tell they players were really trying to finish the game without going to a shoot out.

<p>
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I do believe this is the way it used to be. At the end of regulation they would play an additional 5 minutes. If someone scored during that time, the winning team would receive 2 points, and the losing team nothing. Teams started playing for the tie rather than the win to at least give them self one point. Rather than watching two teams playing to preserve one point I'd rather see them play for an additional point.

<p>
It's amazing how excited the crowd gets when they think there's going to be a penalty shot. Doesn't matter which team is going to be awarded it, the crowd is electric. I got all excited "YEAH! PENALTY SHOT!!!". Alas as you said, they are much too shy with the penalty shots. I hope their intention with the shoot outs wasn't to try and capture some of the "magic" of a penalty shot, if so they've failed miserably. Penalty shots are <em>way</em> more exciting than shoot outs.
