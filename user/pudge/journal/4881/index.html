<i>One justice, Stevens, said the Miller test can't be used for the Internet, because community standards vary too much. While this is a problem with Miller, it's always been dealt with reasonably before.</i> <br> <br>How can it work?  There is a huge difference between community standards in different communities.  Does this law restrict itself to only apply the standards of the community where the site is hosted?  If not, justice Stevens argument is exactly right - a web site that is fully within the community standards of its own community can be charged by members of other communities with other standards.<br> <br>The Web is quite different from most previous distribution schemes, because it crosses community boundaries.<br> <br>A traditional community information resource, like a library, chooses to collect material appropriate to its own community.  If a different community has different standards, the library for the second community simply selects a different set of books.  For a person in the frst community to be offended by the "inappropriate" material in the library of the second community, he has to visit that community; which implicitly requires subjecting himself to their standards (without necessarily approving them, of course).<br> <br>On the Internet, the shelves of the virtual library for every community is equally visible.  You are just as likely to be browsing the information appropriate to a community that is drastically different from yours - in economic or ethnic background, or in geographic location (perhaps a different nation or continent).  But the person browsing has not left their own community, and so can have the belief that their own community standards "ought" to still apply.<br> <br>There is a strong tendency in the U.S. to apply the laws of the "victim" rather than the laws of the "defendent" (to the extent that the U.S. often acts as if itw laws applied elsewhere in the world).  But that causes exactly the problem that Stevens worried about - the most restrictive community standards will be invoked.  The existance of a community with a more lenient standard won't matter, and such a lenient community <b>cannot</b> be served to the limits of its standards.

<h2>Re:community standard do vary too much</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/pudge/">pudge</a> on 2002-05-13T21:00:47</h3>
The short answer to "how it can work" is that it is a lot more complex than it appears, and you can't just look at the words used and judge based on that.  There's a lot of caselaw and precedent behind it.

<p>For starters, you need to look at how similar cases have been handled, where the distributed content was not specific to a particular community.  From the current decision, in re a decision about a national mailing (Hamling):

</p><blockquote><div>
When  the  scope  of  an  obscenity  statute's  coverage  is
sufficiently  narrowed  by  a  'serious  value'  prong  and  a
'prurient  interest' prong,  we  have  held  that  requiring  a
speaker  disseminating  material  to  a  national audience  to
observe varying community standards does not violate the
First Amendment.
</div></blockquote>

<p>Note the important first half of that sentence: we are talking about a very limited scope, things that do NOT have serious value, AND are of a prurient interest.  And:

</p><blockquote><div>
The  fact  that  distributors  of  allegedly  obscene
materials  may  be  subjected  to  varying  community
standards  in  the  various  federal  judicial  districts  into
which they transmit the materials does not render a federal
statute unconstitutional.
</div></blockquote>

<p>So there's the first part: it is not unconstitutional to require them to abide by the various standards of individual communities.  This was, Justice Thomas notes, affirmed later in a case of a dial-a-porn operator:

</p><blockquote><div>
There  is  no  constitutional  barrier  under
Miller  to  prohibiting  communications  that  are  obscene  in
some communities under local standards even though they
are not obscene in others.  If Sable's audience is comprised
of  different  communities  with  different  local  standards,
Sable  ultimately  bears  the  burden  of  complying  with  the
prohibition  on  obscene  messages.
</div></blockquote>

<p>However, that isn't the whole story (nothing in law ever is the whole story<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-).  This case is distinct from Hamling and Sable:

</p><blockquote><div>
The Court of Appeals below concluded that Hamling and
Sable  "are  easily  distinguished  from  the  present  case"
because  in  both  of  those  cases  "the  defendants  had  the
ability to control the distribution of controversial material
with  respect  to  the  geographic  communities  into  which
they  released  it"  whereas  "Web  publishers  have  no  such
comparable  control."
</div></blockquote>

<p>However:

</p><blockquote><div>
In  neither Hamling nor Sable, however, was the speaker's ability  to
target  the  release  of  material  into  particular  geographic
areas  integral  to  the  legal  analysis.
</div></blockquote>

<p>And:

</p><blockquote><div>
Respondents  offer  no  other  grounds  upon  which  to
distinguish  this  case  from Hamling and Sable.
</div></blockquote>

<p>So there's the question: is the lack of ability to geographically target
specific locations sufficient to distinguish it?  If so, the case wasn't
adequately made.   On one level, which you addressed, which Justice Stevens
based the lone dissent on, yes, it seems that "the 'community standards'
criterion as applied to
the  Internet means that any  communication available  to a
nationwide audience will be judged by the standards of the
community most likely to be offended by the message," and that this is
unfair.  However, Justice O'Connor, in her superb concurring opinion, wrote:

</p><blockquote><div>
The  plurality's  opinion  argues  that,  even  under  local
community standards, the variation between the most and
least  restrictive  communities  is  not  so  great  with  respect
to  the narrow category  of  speech  covered  by COPA  as  to,
alone,  render  the  statute  substantially  overbroad.
I  agree,  given  respondents'  failure  to
provide  examples  of  materials  that  lack  literary,  artistic,
political,  and  scientific  value  for  minors,  which  would
nonetheless  result  in  variation  among  communities  judging
the other elements of the test.  Respondents' examples
of  material  for  which  community  standards  would  vary
include  such  things  as  the  appropriateness  of  sex
education and the desirability of adoption by same-sex couples.
Material  addressing  the  latter
topic, however, seems highly unlikely to be seen to appeal
to  the  prurient  interest  in  any  community,  and  educational
material  like  the  former  must,  on  any  objective
inquiry, have scientific value for minors.
</div></blockquote>

<p>So she notes that (paraphrased), "OK, you think standards may differ significantly, but you gave not one example of how they might differ in the narrow field of vision in COPA."  How can the Court be expected to rule that these standards applied to the Internet are unfair when not one example of them being unfair is presented?

</p><p>[And as a side note, I get really pissed off at the ACLU lawyers who pretend that things like sex education have anything at all to do with this case, since they clearly have serious educational value, and are therefore not within the narrow scope of COPA to begin with.  In one document from a few years ago, the ACLU contended that the Starr Report would be illegal under COPA, despite having unquestionably clear political value -- as it formed the basis of evidence for the impeachment of a President -- and ignoring the fact that it is privileged communication, being a part of the Congressional Record, and therefore not subject to such laws anyway.  It's a smokescreen tactic, and it's entirely dishonest.]

</p><p>So, all that said, O'Connor then floats the idea that national standards may be called for.  The current statutes do not define what constitutes a community; indeed, in the original Miller case, the community was "the State of California."

</p><blockquote><div>
If  the  Miller  Court  believed  generalizations  about  the
standards  of  the  people  of  California  were  possible,  and
that jurors would be capable of assessing them, it is difficult
to  believe  that  similar  generalizations  are  not  also
possible  for  the  Nation  as  a  whole.
</div></blockquote>

<p>I don't know if you've spent much time up and down California, but it is by far the most diverse state, by region, that I've ever been in.  Oakland and Reading and Los Angeles and San Francisco and San Diego all have wildly different standards.  So if this is reasonable, why not national standards?  Should this be the case, it would demolish all of the claims in your comment (for U.S.-based content only of course, but foreign content is a completely different discussion anyway).

</p><p>But really, even without this possible remedy to the problem, the point that O'Connor makes that no evidence at all was presented of any content that would cause any such problems with varying standards is telling.  I don't think the ACLU simply forgot to come up with examples.  I think they were unable to find one that would convincingly make their point.  If that is the case, then it's hard to take the claim seriously.</p>

</p><p>That accurately describes every TV commercial ever made. And Howard Stern. And Jerry Springer. And Oprah.And South Park. And the History Channel's XY Factor.

Bullets and cars are a nearly as dangerous as titties, don't you think?
</p><p>It may be that the most harmful element of society isn't really porn or TV or bullets or Republicans, but people. If we could just get rid of the bad ones and keep the good ones, this country would be so much the better. Unfortunately, a fringe political party that came to power in Germany in 1923 really soured the pot for the rest of us on that idea. At the risk of getting metaphysical, the intent to do harm is what we ought to be targetting. With enough motivation, I'm sure a body could turn a hanky into a weapon or read Little Red Riding as a child rape story.
</p><p>To my thinking, "decency laws" are a way of branding certain ideas as harmful and dangerous. This is a little weird. I don't know if ideas are the problem so much as action. I can certainly support restricting harmful action. In fact, I believe that's what most laws do now. It continues to be argued that ideas directly lead to action. At the very least, some ideas seem to trigger Really Bad behavior in some people. While I don't have the professional credentials to support or deny such a claim, I can say that despite a very spotted history, the Catholic Church has done some good for some people. I'm sorry, was I supposed to be talking about porn?</p>

<em>That accurately describes every TV commercial ever made. And Howard Stern. And Jerry Springer. And Oprah.And South Park. And the History Channel's XY Factor.</em> <br> <br>It is not JUST that it might be found to appeal to prurient interest and lacks serious value.  That's just two parts of the three-part Miller test.  You are forgetting (?) the second prong (huh huh) of the Miller test, which is that  the material must also depict, in a patently offensive manner, actual or simulated sex or exhibition of the genitals.<br> <br> <em>And the news coverage of the Lewinsky investigation including the Government sponsored snuff piece known as the Starr report.</em> <br> <br>That's simply false.  This material was specifically related to an investigation and impeachment of a President.  To say this material lacks serious political value is wrong by any objective standard.<br> <br>As to national driver's licenses and gun laws, no, that doesn't follow at all.  Gun laws and driver's licenses, while there are some jurisdictional issues that nationalizing might address, do not have nearly the same problems with local standards that Internet-based obscenity determinations do.  Here we are talking about one local standard dragging down everyone's right to free speech.  That's far more significant in scope.  It's not about the danger of the material involved, it is about preserving the individual freedom of those who would have such material.  O'Connor made the point that the best way to preserve your individual freedom is to not have your web site be subject to the standards of Tennessee.<br> <br>Further, no one is contending in this bill that the material is dangerous or evil.  Yes, traditionally, Miller was used to keep out certain material entirely.  But this scope is far more limited than even the traditional Miller test, in that it only has anything to do with material that is available to minors.  It may be, as the entire SCOTUS (huh huh) agreed, that there are other issues about overbroadness here, but the Miller test is not one of them.<br> <br>The point is that this is not about whether or not people are bad or material is bad, but about allowing parents to have a little bit more control over what their children may freely/easily get their hands on.  It's not like we don't already have laws prohibiting the distribution of pornography to minors.  We have these laws everywhere, and this law is merely an attempt to extend that to the Internet.<br> <br>And no, this law has not one thing to do with branding any idea dangerous.  It has to do specifically not with any idea, but with <i>how</i> ideas are depicted.  Miller is very specific in that regard.  This law is not a wholesale attack on pornography or information about sex.  It is a very limited law that prohibits ONLY material that depicts sex in a graphic and patently offensive manner, AND appeals to prurient interest, AND lacks any serious value, AND is readily available to minors.  It's a very high bar to reach, and most web sites that distribute such material -- as you well know, jjohn -- already block children through means that would be acceptable under this legislation, so its affect would be entirely negligible, except for the few sites that don't do any blocking, of content relevant to this law, through "adult verification."<br> <br>I don't know if this law is good enough to be enforcable, or should be enforcable, but the concept is sound.  If COPA is not reasonable on the grounds of "free speech" in general, than neither are any laws prohibiting distribution of porn to minors.  Maybe that's what some people want, maybe that's what some people think is reasonable.  But most people certainly don't think that, in this country.<br>

Not informational text, no, it would not have anything to do with COPA.  It would need to depict sexual acts in a patently offensive way.  Simply remarking that people have sex with certain other people is not a depiction or description of the sexual act that falls under the Miller test.  Now, if the speech did go into graphic detail about how that sex "worked", then it might be covered under COPA, perhaps.  But mere educational materials about the nature of swinging clearly do not fall under the Miller test, no matter how many people find them offensive, and therefore have nothing to do with COPA.<br>

I'm thinking of a swinger community site... where you'll find not only informational material, but also "personal adds" type things where folks may have explicit photos and descriptions of interests, as well as irc-type chat rooms for discussion including "chat sex".

Well, many explicit photos could be covered under this law.  That does not render the entire site illegal.  I am not sure what your point is supposed to be.  The whole point of the law is that certain "pornographic" material would be illegal if readily available to minors, and I can't see what swinging has to do with anything in the law, nor what putting that material on a swinging web site has to do with anything.<br>

I think you are misunderstanding the "sexually explicity" test.  Perhaps not.  But the material must depict, describe, or represent, in a patently offensive manner, an actual or simulated sexual act or sexual contact, an actual or simulated  normal or perverted sexual act, or a lewd exhibition of the genitals or post-pubescent female breast.<br> <br>A swinging web site could not, even if it were found to appeal to prurient interest and found to have no serious $foo value, be found to violate this law unless it had graphic depiction of sexual acts.  I admit I don't look at swinging web sites very often, but the point here is that the fact that it is swinging has nothing to do with it.  The lifestyle is not in question here, it is whether or not sexual acts are graphically depicted, in a patently offensive manner.  If a swinging web site -- or any web site -- wants to put up such material, it would just need to put it in a section that has some barrier to children.  This would also hold true for a web site catering to singles that had similar content.<br> <br>Maybe you are trying to make the argument that some people would find the swinging web site's depiction of sexual acts to be more patently offensive than a singles' web site's similar depictions by virtue of the swinging nature.  I frankly find that unrealistic; few people are going to say, "that picture of a blowjob would be OK if it weren't swingers doing it."  I just don't see that happening.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br> <br>Frankly, most of this will merely hinge on whether or not the material is pornographic, and while "pornographic" is not a legal term, you know it when you see it, and that's always been, when you get down to it, what most juries in Miller cases have decided on.<br>

If it were of the same essential manner as an illustration in a sex education text, then it won't appeal to prurient interest, and the law is therefore not applicable anyway<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... if it does appeal to prurient interest, then so would the other, and you must consider its education value.  If this photo is clearly framed as being of an educational nature, as the one in a sex education text clearly is, then again, I see no potential problems (leaving aside abuse of the law by prosecutors and juries, which is possible with *any* law, and is part of why we have an appeals process to begin with<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-).<br>
