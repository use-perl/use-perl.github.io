<p>I upgraded to Mozilla 1.2 this morning, on Mac OS X.  It hung on startup, trying to create the first window.<br/><br/>I duplicated ~/Library/Mozilla/ in case I broke something, then deleted the Application Registry file inside that folder, and then started Mozilla.  It asked me to create a new profile; I obliged.  New profile, I want my old prefs back.  I quit Mozilla, copied the contents of my old profile into the new one, and then started Mozilla again.  Everything back to normal.<br/><br/>Although, I cannot tab in between form elements anymore.  I used to be able to select form elements with tab.  What gives?

Since I got my spiffy new G4 laptop on Monday I have been re-installing software.  Since Mozilla 1.2 was the latest, I tried installing that.  I uninstalled it today.  It just does not work.<br> <br>I would really like to use something else though.  Internet Explorer and Opera on the Mac is really nice, but cannot deal with self-signed certificates, and three sites that I trust (including PAUSE admin stuff) have those.<br> <br>I installed Mozilla 1.1 again and found it to be as slow as it was on my G3 laptop, which deflated my new-CPU gloating a bit.<br> <br>I wish they had a better way to note development and stable tracks.

<i>Since I got my spiffy new G4 laptop on Monday I have been re-installing software. Since Mozilla 1.2 was the latest, I tried installing that. I uninstalled it today. It just does not work.</i> <br> <br>According to the release notes, after installation it has to be started as the user who installed it at least once before it will work for the other users as well. I did that and had no problems at all.<br> <br>I actually fell into the habit of reading these notes prior to installing a new release. Mozilla (and likewise Phoenix) turned out to be rather fickle when it comes to upgrading. Fortunately, any changes and problems are nicely documented there.



<h2>User who installed it</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/pudge/">pudge</a> on 2002-11-28T14:17:05</h3>
I have only one user on my system, I install everything, I installed it, I ran it, it didn't work.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)



<h2>Tabbing in a form</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/KM/">KM</a> on 2002-12-02T17:57:10</h3>
I haven't tried 1.2 yet, since people keep saying it is hosed (so, still with 1.2a). Try adding this to your user.js file, and restart Mozilla. See if it helps with your tabbing in forms (works fine in 1.2a):

<blockquote><div><nobr> <wbr></nobr>// Enable tabbing to all fields in a form,<br><nobr> <wbr></nobr>// as well as links.<br>
  user_pref("accessibility.tabfocus", 7) ;
</div></blockquote>

That file should be in:
<p>
~/Library -&gt; Mozilla -&gt; Profiles -&gt; LOGIN -&gt; RANDOM.slt
</p><p>
(LOGIN is your profile name, RANDOM is random stuff). If it doesn't exist, create it.</p>



<h2>Rock on</h2>

Thanks, that works great!
