<p>My TiBook is still freezing.  I got a new keyboard, and I thought it fixed the problem for awhile, but after a full day of using, it finally did freeze, and I was able to duplicate it many times.  I don't know if the length of time the computer has been running makes a difference, but sometimes I can reliably hit the space bar a few times and freeze it, and sometimes I cannot.  But soon after I cannot, like 10 minutes later, I usually can.<br/><br/>I can also cause it to freeze during the startup "bong" sound, if that tells you anything.  It's definitely hardware.<br/><br/>Also, it doesn't happen with external keyboards (or never has), it doesn't seem to happen unless I press down with some force (not banging, but not lightly pressing, either), and it doesn't happen if I lift the keyboard off the laptop, out of its well.  I tried tapping on other components inside (sure, why not?) but couldn't cause it to freeze.<br/><br/>The only good news about this is that I think I can use the computer at YAPC.  I can type lightly, and even if I do freeze, I think the freezes should be infrequent (as long as I don't play any games, which is when I use more force; most of the freezes I've had, when I've not been trying to freeze the machine, have been while playing video games, mostly EV Nova).  I can bring an external keyboard, too, for when I am able to use it (such as during my talk).  I am fairly sure at this point I will have to send the machine to Apple (my one fear is that they will not be able to duplicate the freezes), but I can do it after returning from YAPC, as I have no travel plans for another month and a half.<br/><br/>The other good news is that I have two perfectly good TiBook keyboards.  Yay, me.
