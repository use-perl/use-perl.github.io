<p>TorgoX <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/TorgoX/journal/22975">writes</a> that what Bush is trying to do in Iraq will do poorly even if the Iraqis are lucky.<br/><br/>That's really really dumb.<br/><br/>No one knows what will happen, and as noted many times before, no one had any other solutions beyond "let's let the situation continue to fester with Hussein in power."  We tried something, and by all indications it is going very well.  Sure, you can point out some of the tragedies -- there are many -- that have occurred along the way, but these will not prevent the long-term goal from occurring.  It's like saying a football team had a bad game because the QB threw a few interceptions: what matters is whether they win in the end.*<br/><br/>Oh, but because I believe this, I am probably not "persuaded by the facts."  Yes, people who disagree with you are closed-minded.  That's so original.  And insipid.<br/><br/>The facts are these: Iraq is progressing about as well as anyone could have hoped.  There have been problems, including too many civilian deaths, too many insurgents, and a rebuilding effort that has not been strong enough in some areas.  There have been many good things too, such as Iraq doing quite well governing itself for more than six months and just recently having extraordinarily successful national elections (which were secured primarily by Iraqi police).<br/><br/>By all indications, the nation is well on its way to having its own entirely independent country, with new executives to be chosen soon, and a Constitution to be written by the new representatives, to be ratified later this year.  Whether that will happen remains to be seen, of course, and there are a large number of obstacles along the way.  But the naysayers are the same people who said a handover of power last summer could not work, and that elections in January could not work.  Why should we believe them now?<br/><br/>Ah, but Iraqis are incapable of governing themselves.  So this is doomed to failure.  Is there a word for this that does not imply racial, ethnic, or religious bigotry?  I am trying to think of one.<br/><br/>
* And by the way, I couldn't care less about complaints about sports analogies in war.  Our sports are simplified versions of war, in essence.  And so when trying to simplify war for the sake of discussion, we naturally use something else we already have that is a simplification of war.<br/><br/></p>

Whatever is really happening in Iraq and whoever was  right about the reasons the are some things that seem hard to deny.<br> <br><br/><br/>1. If there were WMD of any variety in Iraq they are now probably in the hands of people who are not much better that Hussein.<br><br/><br/>2. The war in Iraq seems to have made large chunks of for want of a worse word old europe more anti Bush and probably more anti american now that he has been reelected.<br><br/><br/>3. The failure to find any WMD leaves people with a bitter taste in their mouths about preemptive wars. I can not see america having much help taking on Iran or North Korea unless the other guy starts it. Maybe this doesn't matter.<br>
4. Wars may cost quite a lot of money but occupations cost more. I'm not an economist but apparently quite a lot of euro is flowing into the usa to pay for the war in Iraq(amongst other things) and this is part of the reason the dollar has lost a large chuck of its value against most other major world currencies. Some people seem to think this will have long term major consequences.<br> <br><br/><br/>It's all history in the making so who really knows whats going to happen.

<em>If there were WMD of any variety in Iraq they are now probably in the hands of people who are not much better that Hussein.</em> <br> <br>Sure.  At worst, we are likely not much worse off.  But I never supported the war because I thought WMD existed, this was never my priority, and it doesn't have much to do with my thoughts on the matter one way or another.<br> <br> <em>The war in Iraq seems to have made large chunks of for want of a worse word old europe more anti Bush and probably more anti american now that he has been reelected.</em> <br> <br>This doesn't matter to me.  Yes, I want people to like us, but more than that, I want to do the right thing, and I think going into Iraq was the right thing.<br> <br> <em>The failure to find any WMD leaves people with a bitter taste in their mouths about preemptive wars.</em> <br> <br>Yeah, and it's why I was -- before the war began -- angry with how the war was being sold, because of some of the effects like this.<br> <br> <em>I can not see america having much help taking on Iran or North Korea unless the other guy starts it. Maybe this doesn't matter.</em> <br> <br>I don't think it matters in the case of North Korea.  No one would help us take on North Korea anyway.  No one will strike North Korea first, not the U.S., not anybody, unless Japan perceives a real imminent threat of a missile strike (which is not impossible, but probably unlikely).<br> <br>Iran and Syria and others have the potential to be more similar to Iraq, but remember, we didn't go into Iraq until we tried and failed for 12 years to get them to comply with their obligations under UNSC 687 (and following).  There's nothing similar to that kind of defiance of the world community with Syria.  Iran has a similar, though different, problem with its nukes, but that is being dealt with (although we'll see how effectively).<br> <br> <em>Wars may cost quite a lot of money but occupations cost more. I'm not an economist but apparently quite a lot of euro is flowing into the usa to pay for the war in Iraq(amongst other things) and this is part of the reason the dollar has lost a large chuck of its value against most other major world currencies. Some people seem to think this will have long term major consequences.</em> <br> <br>I am no economist either, but in some ways, this is a good thing.  The dollar has been overvalued for a long time (considering the huge U.S. debt), and it's good for U.S. businesses that it's coming down, as it helps with the trade imbalance.  In the long term, I only see a big problem here if the U.S. doesn't begin to fix its trade imbalance, and this devaluation provides a great opportunity to start to do that.<br> <br>Not that I am in favor of increasing debt to devalue the dollar, but that doesn't mean some good can't come of it.

<i> TorgoX writes that what Bush is trying to do in Iraq will do poorly even if the Iraqis are lucky.</i> <br> <br>I think that is is a very poor attribution.<br> <br>TorgoX may very well have the most posts in the journals, but he doesn't actully comment on a large portion of them. (Which isn't a slam in any way against his posting style.)<br> <br>In the post you link to, he makes no comment at all. He links to four different articles and it takes a bit of work to find out what, exactly you are referring to here.<br> <br>Because you are not referring to something he actually wrote, but rather an article he linked to...

<i>Iraq is progressing about as well as anyone could have hoped.</i> <br> <br>Unless you were the guy responsible for the initial <a href="http://www.rense.com/general36/rerum.htm" title="rense.com">plan</a rense.com>.<br> <br>We used to play that game as kids. I would do something on my skateboard... it would go incredibly bad, then I'd say: "I meant to do that".<br> <br>Of course, it wasn't true.<br> <br> <a href="http://bottleofblog.typepad.com/bottleofblog/2004/12/four_more_years.html" title="typepad.com">And, as this article notes</a typepad.com> many of the people that actually had a clue about how it was really going to go down... they got fired.<br> <br> <i>By all indications, the nation is well on its way to having its own entirely independent country, with new executives to be chosen soon, and a Constitution to be written by the new representatives, to be ratified later this year.</i> <br> <br>Well, if the ten points (Analyzing the Elections) in <a href="http://www.palestinechronicle.com/story.php?sid=20050203113940880" title="palestinechronicle.com">this article</a palestinechronicle.com> are true... I would not exactly call them "independent".<br> <br>Or a democracy for that matter.<br> <br>But hey, every country needs a puppet government so they can deploy new military bases.<br> <br>---<br> <br>Now, we are in the country. It is too late to "do no harm", but... I do believe we have the responsibiltiy to do as little harm as possible. And that means getting out as soon as possible, IMHO.<br> <br>There are several things that tick me off about the whole thing and this seems like a good post mention them.<br> <br>1) The attitude, which even you seem to have in this very post (<i>what matters is whether they win in the end</i>), that the ends somehow justify the means.<br> <br>That is terribly wrong, especially coming from a group claiming a "moral" mandate.<br> <br>I mean, there are certainly easier ways to get Bush out of office than a vote. But that would not be right.<br> <br>We could eleminate poverty in America by simply killing the poor. But that would not be right.<br> <br>The ends do not justify the means. Doing the right thing is what justifies the means.<br> <br>The whole idea of cheating to "win" seems counter-moral to me. Yet it seems to be something that the Republicans identify greatly with. Winning... at all costs.<br> <br>2) Pre-emptive war.<br> <br>Why?<br> <br>Simple, you just legitimized the attacks on the World Trade Center.<br> <br>They were simply pre-emptive attacks agains a "war mongering" state with "weapons of mass destruction". The only state, by the way, that has ever deployed nuclear weapons against another country.<br> <br>Looking at it from the point of view of others, if ever there was a country that should be "pre-emptively" attacked... it is us.<br> <br>Naturally, I think that this is wrong. But, I also think it is as legitimate as the concept of "pre-emptive" strikes.<br> <br>Pre-emptive strikes are for fear mongering barbarians. Not civilized peoples.<br> <br>And, if that isn't a legitimate line of reasoning... then add this to the list: Using different rules for ourselves than we allow for others.<br> <br>3) They lied to get what they want.<br> <br>Call it what you want. This administration tied Iraq to 9/11 and used that to "justify" going after Iraq.<br> <br>Yeah, you can point to other things they used to justify it also. You can get pedantic and insist that it depends on what the definition of "is" is. That just adds fuel to the fire. They used every single excuse they could find to "sell" it to the public.<br> <br>Me thinks a legitimate endevor would not require that behavior.<br> <br>4) Missed the target<br> <br>Meanwhile, the country that most of the 9/11 attackers came from... still <a href="http://www.forbes.com/technology/ebusiness/feeds/ap/2005/02/03/ap1802141.html" title="forbes.com">jerking our chain</a forbes.com> with meetings.<br> <br>And, the mastermind... we still get "updates" from him too.<br> <br>So, while I applaud the president's goal of "spreading democracy"... I can't help but cringe at the total ineptitude and arrogance that seem to permeate their every decision.<br> <br>

Kerry didn't get elected because he couldnt or refused to reduce complex moral, economic and military issues into happy chirpy apple-pie bullshit, unlike Bush who lied through his teeth to provide patriotic sounding soundbites.
</p><p>
Why listlen when its boring - much better to believe that Saddam was a bad guy (in fact he is quite far down the list of bad guys, compared to dictators accross africa and asia) that needed to be removed from power, or that the iraqi opposition group that was used to justify and legitimise the invasion was in fact created and funded by the CIA and was mostly used to funnel public funds into a handful of pockets.

Germany went through much the same after Hitler. Germany seems to be doing okay today. Granted there are a lot of differences but to say there is no precedence is not historically accurate.
