<h2>best ever?</h2>

I'm not a dedicated football fan as yourself, but that's a little premature isn't it? As a Steeler fan I'm obligated to hate the Ravens, but compare their <a href="http://www.baltimoreravens.com/template.php?subsection=statistics2000&amp;section=press" title="baltimoreravens.com">2000 season</a baltimoreravens.com> with <a href="http://www.patriots.com/stats/STDStats.sps?patBPF=1&amp;patBFV=&amp;patBFI=0&amp;patBSW=800&amp;patBSH=600&amp;compid=23546" title="patriots.com">the 2003 Patriots</a patriots.com>. That's not to mention the Bears of 85, Steelers in the 70s...

<p>Then again, 'best ever' discussions are one of the things that can make sports fun!</p>

And certainly the 85 Bears would be in there, no doubt.<br> <br>And don't look at stats, they are very misleading with this Patriots team.  Remember, they didn't have outstanding stats in 01, but were the best football team that year.  Don't look at the fact that they are 15th in pass yardage against, look at the fact they have won 13 games in a row, by slim margins, and have a few impressive shutouts against good teams.

I wholeheartedly agree with you about "just win, baby" mentality. And somehow between clicking the 'reply' button and the 'submit' button I'd forgotten the "one of" qualifier<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-) (replying from the<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/my/amigos/ page doesn't display the message I'm replying to...)

<p>And now that I look at the stats again I might have to go back on my words. One of my favorite stats (beyond wins) is the number of shutouts and single-digit games -- 3 and 2 (with one 10 point game), respectively. Nice work. Not quite as good as the downright gaudy stats of the Ravens -- 4 and 5 (plus two 10 point games) -- but still good. </p>

<p>The number of first downs allowed is another good indicator -- 286 for the Pats, 216 for the Ravens. However, the third down percentage is quite close (Patriots, 35.5%; Ravens, 34.1%). And despite what you said about passing yardage, the yards per attempt is nearly identical (5.4 vs 5.6). </p>

<p>Note to self: keep quiet about things you don't know that much about...</p>

<em>And despite what you said about passing yardage, the yards per attempt is nearly identical (5.4 vs 5.6).</em> <br> <br>The Patriots defense was excellent in yard per attempt and competion percentage, but average in total yards.  I've been preaching this as the Achilles' Heel of the defense for awhile: the vulnerability on the long pass, the tendency to give up the big play.  And no team is better at the big play than the Colts right now.  SCARY.

<h2>Manning</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/djberg96/">djberg96</a> on 2004-01-12T21:38:06</h3>
I watched part of the 2 Colts victories and all I have to say is, "holy shit!".  This guy is picking apart defenses at will.
<p>
I read that he's been studying defenses like a madman, and has even double-audible'd to adjust to defensive scheme adjustments.  He's become a real student of the game, and when you combine that with his athletic ability, it's downright scary.</p>

Yes.  After the Pats faced the Colts in November, I announced the Colts are the scariest team in the league to me, and predicted a Colts/Pats AFC Championship Game.<br> <br>The good news is that Belichick has done very well against Manning in the past, and even did well against him for most of the game this year.  Also, the Colts defense is not playing very well.  If the Chiefs had just stopped the Colts ONCE they could have won the game.  The Patriots should be able to stop them at least once, but, of course, don't have the offense that the Chiefs have.
