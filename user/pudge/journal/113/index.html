<p>Well, testing is good.  I have been uncovering a few subtle bugs.  One was some weirdness in config.h where BYTEORDER was not getting defined, so MacPerl 5.6.1a1 thinks it is little-endian.  Oops.  That's all fixed.<br/><br/>Then we find that perl does <I>not</I> completely implement sprintf, and that it leaves the e/f/g formats for the local sprintf to handle.  And there is at least one bug in SFIO's sprintf implementation, and maybe two (that is, it rounds 0.9 down to 0 for %0.f, and it pads %010g with spaces to the left, instead of 0s).  One or both of these may have been fixed in more recent SFIOs.<br/><br/>I also added some Makefile instructions to install the libs in :lib:macos: into :lib:, simplifying a few things.  Yay.<br/><br/>I am going to start the tests over from scratch, as I found out some interesting things.  First, "@INC = '../lib'" works fine in MacPerl 5.6.1.  Is this good or bad?  I dunno, but for now I'll keep it, as it means far fewer patches to the test suite.  Now that (as noted in the previous paragraph) Config.pm is in ::lib, we won't need to include ::macos:lib.  Nifty.<br/><br/>I also found out that $ENV{MACPERL} and $ENV{PERL5LIB} were sometimes interfering with my test paths.  Ack.  So part of the test procedure would be to un-set those (under MPW).<br/><br/>Really, most of these tests need to be done under MPW.  Oh well.</p>
