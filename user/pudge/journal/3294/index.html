<div class="span8">
<p>Journals now support SOAP.  This is experimental and subject to change, though I hope that it won't change significantly, except to fix bugs and improve in various ways.<br/><br/><P>There are five methods.<br/><br/><UL>
<LI><TT>add_entry(LIST)</TT>
<BR><TT>add_entry(SUBJECT, BODY)</TT>
<P>Add an journal entry.  Either pass two arguments, SUBJECT and BODY, or pass a list of key-value pairs, where the allowed keys are <TT>subject, body, discuss, posttype, tid</TT>.
<P><TT>discuss</TT> is a boolean for turning on discussions.  <TT>posttype</TT> is an integer specifying one of the allowed post types.  <TT>tid</TT> is an integer specifying the one of the topic IDs (topics aren't really used in journals on use.perl.org right now).  These things will take your defaults if left unspecified.
<P>Method returns the unique ID of the new entry, or false for failure.
</LI><br/><br/><P><LI><TT>modify_entry(ID, LIST)</TT>
<P>Similar to <TT>add_entry</TT>, but modifies an existing entry, specified by ID.  Journal ID can also be seen in the header of the particular journal entry in the web interface.  Supply only the keys that are to be modified.
<P>Method returns the same unique ID if successful, or false for failure.
</LI><br/><br/><P><LI><TT>delete_entry(ID)</TT>
<P>Deletes entry specified by given ID.
<P>Returns true for success, false for failure.
</LI><br/><br/><P><LI><TT>get_entry(ID)</TT>
<P>Returns hashref with data for given entry, or false for failure.
<P>Data currently includes the URL to the journal entry, the URL to the journal discussion, the ID of the journal, the ID of the journal discussion, the body, the subject, the posting date, the topic ID, the user ID, the user nickname, and the posttype.
</LI><br/><br/><P><LI><TT>get_entries(UID, LIMIT)</TT>
<P>Returns arrayref of hashrefs, with data for journal entries for user with given UID, or false for failure.  Returns most recent LIMIT number of entries, with three keys for each entry: URL to the journal entry, the ID of the journal, and the subject.
</LI><br/><br/></UL><br/><br/>
<P>Now, how to use it?  I gave <A HREF="http://use.perl.org/user/pudge/journal/2824">an example</A> recently, but here is another.  Note that I use SOAP::Lite (although any SOAP client should work) and I use my own local Netscape cookie file on Mac OS to provide authentication.  If you don't properly authenticate, you will be able to use the get_* methods, but not the others; and, of course, you can only add/modify/delete your own entries.<br/><br/><BLOCKQUOTE><ECODE>#!/usr/bin/perl -w
use strict;
use HTTP::Cookies;
use SOAP::Lite;<br/><br/>my $host        = 'use.perl.org';

my $proxy       = "http://$host/journal.pl";
my $cookie_file = "$ENV{HOME}Netscape Users:Chris Nandor:MagicCookie";<br/><br/>my $cookie_jar  = HTTP::Cookies::Netscape->new;
$cookie_jar->load($cookie_file);<br/><br/>my $journal = SOAP::Lite->uri($uri)
                        ->proxy($proxy, cookie_jar => $cookie_jar);<br/><br/># now, the methods<br/><br/>my $recents = $journal->get_entries( 1, 10 )->result;
my $recent  = $journal->get_entry( $recents->[0]{id} )->result;<br/><br/>my $new_id  = $journal->add_entry( 'this is a test again', 'ha!' )->result;
$journal->modify_entry( $new_id, body => 'uh!' );<br/><br/># this one is dangerous, be careful
# $journal->delete_entry( $new_id );<br/><br/>__END__
</ECODE></BLOCKQUOTE><br/><br/><P>I hope this makes your journal experience a more pleasurable one.  Note that you shouldn't abuse this by making a ton of entries, because I'll be angry, and so will your fellow users who are set to receive a message each time you post a new entry.<br/><br/><P>Two more things: there currently is no nickname-&gt;uid mapping (although get_entry returns the nickname and uid).  There will be at some point, probably.  Also, the only way to get recent journals is <A RHEF="http://use.perl.org/journal.pl?op=top&content_type=rss">via RSS</A>, which may suit whatever evil purposes you have.<br/><br/><P>Special thanks to jjohn for his help in figuring some of this stuff out.</p>

To forestall abuse by posting a lot of entries, how hard will it be to stick a formkey onto journal creation? Do<br/><br/><tt>formkeyHandler('max_post_check', 'journals', $formkey, $msg_ref)</tt><br/><br/>and create a var called<br/><br/><tt>max_journals_allowed</tt><nobr> <wbr></nobr>... simple right?

Try:

The one-liner will complete and then return, so it is not good for interactive scripts.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)  If you want an interactive command-line, get and install <a href="http://developer.apple.com/tools/mpw-tools/" title="apple.com">MPW</a apple.com> (or just ToolServer, if you have something that can talk to it, like BBEdit, but MPW is superior, because ToolServer cannot call other tools, so you can't do "perl -le 'print `files`'" etc., because ToolServer itself is what allows you to call said other tools!<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-).

<p>You'll want to be careful in how you handle the checking for SOAP at build-time and run-time. Don't want to force people into installing something, better to give them the choice. Unless they already have it installed, of course<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-).</p>

Hmm. I'm more of the philosophy: why have two versions of the same code?<br> <br>At the very least, the more modules that make people have SOAP client software, then the more SOAP server software there can be.<br> <br>That said, is SOAP::Lite that difficult to install?

If you're talking about using SOAP versus trying to read, parse, and post data by emulating a web client, there's no contest: use SOAP.  The web client interface is guaranteed to change some day in subtle ways that will break any code you have.  The SOAP interface is not.  I won't say it's guaranteed to not change, but I'll try not to change it.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br> <br>So yeah, if it were me, I would require users to use SOAP::Lite, or some other SOAP client module.<br>

<p>Any idea when we'll see a method for getting the ID from the username? I've already got two scripts based on this ready to go, but it pains me to see users forced to look up the UIDs<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-).</p>

<h3><a href="/user/pudge/">pudge</a> on 2002-03-11T02:45:49</h3>
No, no idea yet.  What I <em>think</em> might be best, currently, is to have a SOAP interface for the users stuff.  So right now we have Slash::Journal::SOAP, and maybe add a Slash::Users::SOAP.  One thing I am sure of is that I don't want to go further until I have a better sense of direction, so now would be a good time to give me any thoughts anyone might have on the subject.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

<h2>Re:Username = UID mapping?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/rjray/">rjray</a> on 2002-03-11T23:35:09</h3>
<p>Hurm-- I'd love to help out with ideas, especially since this is going to be referred to several times in my SOAP chapters for the book on web services I'm writing<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-). I'm not that familiar with the Slash code itself, though, and I'm not at a good place to be trying to dive into something new, either.</p>
<p>I would start with a fairly basic approach that lends itself easily to adding onto later. There is no need for user-add or user-delete functions at the SOAP level, I think we can all agree that those are better left someplace !SOAP. Basic information retrieval by UID, discerning UID from a given username, and some degree of user-info updating for users that have adequate credentials on the UA, these would be a good start. Even the latter, user-update, is less important at this stage than information-retrieval.</p>

<h3><a href="/user/pudge/">pudge</a> on 2002-03-12T03:38:57</h3>
Those are similar to my thoughts, thanks.<br> <br>However, a problem I see is with how to get this all to play nicely together.  What I mean is this: the uri() for Journals is "http://$host/Slash/Journal/SOAP".  But the uri() for getting information about users would be something like "http://$host/Slash/Users/SOAP".  Is this too unwieldy?

<p>Here's something I've put together as an early example for my chapter on using the toolkits (the one that will introduce each of the <tt>SOAP</tt> and <tt>SOAP::Lite</tt> packages, before moving on to bigger code).

<p>Just used this to post a
<a href="http://use.perl.org/user/rjray/journal/3472" title="perl.org">test-entry</a perl.org>
into my journal. It's probably about on-par with the test script pudge was using a while back, except that the path to the cookie file is UNIX-ish instead of Mac-ish (and File::Spec wouldn't really help here, because the different Netscape platforms save their user data in differently-formed paths). It also allows for command-line arguments for title and whether to allow discussion. It also allows a command-line-provided filename to provide the body, or in absence of it reads from STDIN. It doesn't handle the other options to <tt>add_entry</tt> because they're integer-oriented, which would be useless to an end-user without some text-to-value mapping (pudge: another subject for our off-line architecture discussion). But it's a start, and might be good cut-and-paste fodder for someone else. I'll be adding the non-Netscape cookie support later.</p>
