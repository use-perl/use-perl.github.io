<p>Step one: apply fix for T_OSTYPE to typemap, and fix the same problem in MacPerl::GetFileInfo, which bypassed T_OSTYPE.<br/><br/>Step two: fix ReadHex in Carbon.h, which takes a hex string of two or four bytes and converts it to an integer for use in GUSIPath2FSp, which converts a GUSI-encoded file spec to a FSSpec.  For Intel, it was doing it in the wrong order.<br/><br/>Step three: there's no step three!<br/><br/>Fixing those three bugs tonight dropped me from 79/199 failed tests, down to 1/199.  And the one remaining is GetAliasInfo(), which is deprecated, and simply does not work on Intel Macs (nor UFS volumes).<br/><br/>So, it's all done.  Well, not really.  I have a lot more testing to do.  But I am far further along after one night with this loaner Mac than I thought I would be.  I really need to doublecheck and expand my test coverage, and then test a bunch of other things that use Mac::Carbon.<br/><br/>The remaining point that worries me most is that I was informed that the blanket fix for OSType might be wrong on a per-API basis, as mentioned previously, but so far that doesn't seem to be the case with any of the APIs I am testing.

Thanks for doing this.  Its perfect timing. I have a homebrew time reporting system for my consulting biz that uses Mac::Glue to integrate iCal into it.  I just got a new MacBook Pro and tried to move the system to it yesterday and discovered it didn't work.<br><br>If there's any way I can help out with testing, I'm willing.



<h2>loaner</h2>

really, with the usefulness of Mac::Carbon, Glue etc, they should just let you <i>keep</i> the machine.<br><br>
