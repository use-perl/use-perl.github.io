<div class="span8">
<p>The New England Patriots under Brady/Belichick have won all their playoff victories by three points, in years they went to the AFC Championship Game, except for games against Indy or Pittsburgh.  In those four games against those two teams, instead of winning by a FG, they won by a TD, a TD and a FG, two TDs, and two TDs and a FG.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots#Season-by-season_records">Go see.</a><br/><br/>So Patriots over the Colts, by three TDs.  I know that seems like a lot, but what else could it be?  I suppose I could be reading the pattern incorrectly.  Maybe two FGs?  That would fit the drama of the occasion.  Could also be one TD and two FGs.<br/><br/>And then, of course, Patriots over the Bears/Saints (probably Bears) by three in the Super Bowl.

The Patriots were the beneficiaries of Marty Ball. 4th and 11 and we're in field goal range? Go for the first down!
<p>
Fummmmblllllle!
</p><p>
Nice play challenge and clock management there, too, Marty.
</p><p>
I'll be you're hoping for a Patriots/Bears rematch. Me? I hate the Bears, but I also don't want to have to listen endlessly about the New Orleans miracle, Katrina, blah, blah, blah, before, during and after the Super Bowl. I'm torn.</p>

BTW, this particular Marty loss is now known as "The Interception".  It can now be added to "The Drive" and "The Fumble" as part of a long line of Marty screw ups.
