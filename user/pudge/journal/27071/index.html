<p>In the mid-90s, the Boston Bruins ended the longest consecutive playoff appearance streak* in U.S. sports history at 29 seasons.  The next longest streak at the time was 27, by the Chicago Blackhawks.  They ended their streak the following season.<br/><br/>Last year, the Boston Red Sox ended one of the longest championshipless streaks in sports history at 86 years.  The next greater streak at the time was 87, by the Chicago White Sox.  Do you see where I am going with this?<br/><br/>Also: the Red Sox -- who have won six World Series -- have never won the World Series in a year when the Boston Bruins were playing (as the Bruins did not exist until about 10 years after the 1918 win, and were not playing in 2004-2005, due to the lockout).  If I were not such a huge hockey fan, I would call for the team's elimination.<br/><br/>On the other hand, maybe the Sox only won because God knew without hockey, we would be terribly depressed unless something big happened.<br/><br/>Game 2 of the 2005-2006 season begins in 15 minutes.  Go Bruins!<br/><br/>
* OK, I know that doesn't sound all that impressive, since it is hockey, where even teams with losing records can make the playoffs, but they also had a winning record each of those seasons.  So nyah.
