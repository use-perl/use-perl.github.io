<p>This morning I flopped around the radio, trying to avoid talk about the Red Sox and Iraq, and I heard a song I'd never heard before.  In my mind's eye, I saw a picture of the chick who won on American Idol.  Now, I've only seen part of the show once, and have only heard her sing once, and it wasn't this song.  Yet, at the end of the song, the DJs identified her as the singer.<br/><br/>Did I recognize her voice?  I suppose that's the most likely explanation, though it seems a bit far-fetched, since I had only heard her sing once, and her voice isn't very unique; then again, <A HREF="http://use.perl.org/user/pudge/journal/1038">stranger things have happened</A>.<br/><br/>But on the other hand, last week I heard this guy for the first time named John Mayer.  I thought, he sounds like Dave Matthews.  nvp recommended it this weekend, so I bought it today, and then I say on IRC how I like him, and I just heard of him last week.  aevil reminds me that she told me in January about him, that I listened to him, and that I said he sounded like Dave Matthews.  I now recall this incident, but at the time I bought and listened to the CD today, I did not.<br/><br/>Freaky.

...maybe you'd be interested in Guster or in Martin Sexton.<br> <br>The three of them played together (well not together, but in one concert) in St. Louis recently, so I'm guessing their marketing folks think they work well together. Apparently the three of them were touring together.<br> <br>My personal ranking was Martin Sexton (solo guitar blues singer, Very Good, I'll pay money for his CDs and future concerts) then Guster (well-described by a friend as 'the indigo guys', good but not something I'd pay money for) and then John Mayer (definitely Dave Mathews -sounding, which is not my cup of tea).<br> <br>Given that I'm not a Dave Mathews fan, you may want to take my recomendations with a lump of salt, but those marketing folks must have had something in mind when lumping them in one show, eh?<br> <br>If you go to one of Mayer's shows, be prepared to stand out in the audience. The largest demographic in the audience seemed to be 17-23 year old girls and it was very apparent when he came on that they were mostly there to see him.<br> <br>-matt

The people who go to concerts that stand/sit around me usually suck.

I'm a wuss about cigarete smoke, and most venues are smoke-filled. This concert happened to be at a smoke-free venue and some friends were going. I took advantage of the rare concert opportunity.<br> <br>-matt<br>
