<p>Most of Apple's iApps are dogs.<br/><br/>Well, sure, Mac OS X itself is pretty much a dog (in its UI).  Mac OS runs circles around it in many respects.<br/><br/>But that doesn't excuse 600K of calendars taking up 40% of my RAM on a 512MB machine (according to Process Viewer) in iCal.<br/><br/>Nor does it excuse that it takes more than 30 seconds to start on a G4/667.  And about 30 seconds to move something from one (~300K) calendar to another.<br/><br/>iChat isn't very slow (how could it be?), but it is pretty buggy.  It crashes a lot.  iCal has some significant bugs too, though it's not crashed on me yet.

I don't know what you're seeing.  iCal has worked zippily and promptly for me.  ps tells me

<blockquote><div>
<tt>gnat  1206   0.0  6.5   193992  50780  ??  S     8:42PM   1:55.93<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/Applications/iCal.app/Contents/MacOS/iCal -psn_0_10878977
</tt> </div></blockquote>

Which isn't anywhere near 600K.<p>

You're just cursed.  Sucks to be you.  Rocks to be me, with football games, DVD releases, movie releases, and holidays all synched with iCal<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p><p>

How big are your calendar files on disk?  ~/Library/Calendars/.  Mine topped 600K.  That's what I was talking about.

<em>Are you sure that you are reading the Process Viewer output right?</em> <br> <br>When it says "% Memory" and below that reads "40", yeah, I think so.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br> <br>Note that I have *only* seen this with a large-ish calendar.  No one else I've talked to who reports significantly lower memory use has had a calendar<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.ics file larger than 300K, let alone 500K or more.
