<h2>Da Bears!</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/shild/">shild</a> on 2007-01-29T20:43:38</h3>
Here are some keys to a win...<br><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; * Defense - just play like they did against the Saints<br><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; * Offense - run Thomas &amp; Benson eating up the time, keeping Peyton off the field.<br><br>Glad to hear you are cheering on the Bears.<br>Now you need to become a White Sox Fan...<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

The Colts will most likely stack against the run until Grossman gives them reason not to. If Grossman has one of his bad days, the Bears are going to get run over like a freight train and it could be Denver vs SF all over again.
<p>
If Grossman has one of his good days, however, they have a chance, but the Bears secondary is suspect.

Prediction: Colts 31, Bears 13</p>

Actual: Colts 29, Bears 17

Yeah, I think my overall prediction was pretty spot on.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

I freely admit my prediction about the Bears winning was mere wishful thinking.

Yes it was, they certainly did not play like they did against the Saints.<br>Positive side of it all is this Grossman's first full year and he got Super Bowl experience.<br>When Hester ran the kickoff back I  was excited than quickly remembered Ted Ginn's<br>run back for OSU which turned out to be the only thing OSU did that game.<br>At least the Bears didn't get it beat as bad.<br><br>
