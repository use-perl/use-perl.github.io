<p>Day Three, woke up, cleaned up room, checked out.  The hotel had this <A HREF="http://pudge.net/gallery.pl?op=display&amp;pic_id=628">soul CD</A> in the room that was pretty relaxing, and I thought Oh, Cool, I get a free CD out of this.  Then I saw the sticker: $13 to keep the CD.  So I ripped it.<br/><br/>I went over to the OSDN booth and found no wireless access.  So I found another wireless network and used that.  Then I got tired of stealing things and we got the nice men from shownets.net to set up a hub and some static IPs.  But the public computer we had set up had no RJ-45 connection I could find, just 802.11 card.  So I set up my extra PowerBook instead.<br/><br/>I saw Penth, for the first time since TPC was in Monterey, I think.  She stopped by on her way to the <A HREF="http://pudge.net/gallery.pl?op=display&amp;pic_id=658">.org Pavilion</A> (where .org's, non-commercial groups, set up small booths).<br/><br/>I went and hung out with the crew in the speaker's lounge, having some rice pilaf (no pictures of it, sorry!) and getting a copy of the <A HREF="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/runblogslash">Slash book</A>.  I then went to <A HREF="http://pudge.net/gallery.pl?op=display&amp;pic_id=672">Brian Aker</A>'s talk on how Slashdot &amp; MySQL scaled together, which was quite interesting, even for me, who knows most of the story already.  After the talk, Brian rushed to the airport and I went back to the OSDN room again, where I checked mail, downloaded <A HREF="http://www.perl.org/ThePerlReview/">The Perl Review</A> (which I read on the train) and helped clean up the room a bit.<br/><br/>After awhile, with most everything being taken down, I wandered over to the <A HREF="http://pudge.net/gallery.pl?op=display&amp;pic_id=644">Compaq pinball table</A> (some Harley Davidson game) and proceeded to score 36 million points on my first ball.  A guy walked up and bragged that he had a high score of 96 million, so I decided to best him.  I scored another 30-something million on my second ball, and was up to 86 million total with my third ball when the power went out.  In the words of Charlie Brown: AUGH!<br/><br/>I took a cab over to Penn Station and stood around for an hour, got on the train, and read The Perl Review, watched Tron, and went home.

I wish I had a copy of the Slash book.  (The four dead-tree drafts on the corner of my desk don't count.)
