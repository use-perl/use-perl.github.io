Is there any reason why the front news items would show up in the blogosphere (search, subscriptions, etc) but not the journals? (nothing seems to carry them)<br><br>Is that something you would need to enable support for so they could add it, or is it just the aggregators and search people all not caring?

What do you mean by "subscriptions"?<br><br>And are you talking about RSS feeds for journals?<br>

I mean more that while RSS is available directly from use.perl, and while Google's normal search may index pages here and there, the use.perl journals don't seem to be integrated into the whole Google Blog search, or the major aggregators and search things (Technorati etc).

I have no idea how they find their feeds.  If all feeds Google finds should end up in their Google Blogs whateveritis, then obviously Google is broken, since our feeds are properly announced in the pages Google is indexing.  If they have to be provided to Google specially somehow, well, then that hasn't been done by me, so it would need to be done.  I am not really sure how to answer the question, because I know nothing about these aggregators or how they work, as I don't *care* about them or how they work, as I don't have any personal need or use for any of them.<br><br>So if you want something to show up on them, find out how to get something to show up on them.

<p>What do you mean "in the blogosphere"?  Doesn't that just mean "people blogging about them"?  Your question to me sounds like "Why do people blog about front page news items but not journal items?"  Are you trying to ask why search engines do not pick up journal entries?  Because if so, you should know that <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/jdavidb/journal/29537" title="perl.org">they do</a perl.org>.  What do you mean when you say "nothing seems to carry them"?</p>
