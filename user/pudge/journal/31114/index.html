<h2>I'm picking my teeth with your straw man</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Ovid/">Ovid</a> on 2006-09-26T07:13:55</h3>
<p>It's so easy to knock down straw men.  Kinda fun sometimes, too.</p>

<p>If only I had known that that liberals are driven by "wishful thinking" and and "the notion that we can make life on Earth perfect" and "[maybe] we can all have a Star Trek like existence".  Gosh, even though I've never met a single liberal who espouses such a view, clearly you, Pudge, the Champion of Truth and Light, have revealed to me the Way.  Never again shall I be so shallow as to believe that differences in core values might lead people to different political viewpoints.  Instead, it's mere naivit&eacute; and having read too many fantasy books as a child which has driven America's liberals for so long.</p>

<p>For what it's worth, before I hit this bit, I thought you sounded rational.  As for your character assassination of all liberals (I guess that would make it character genocide, eh?), yes there are some people who would fit your description. You can easily chum the waters by tossing them out there but I could just as easily make up my personal view of conservatives which is equally as ridiculous.</p>

<p>I stopped listening to the podcast after that.  It was clear there wasn't much point.</p>

<p>Agreed that you didn't say "all liberals".  My apologies.  However, you presented the viewpoint of what describe as "many liberals" and you quite failed to make it clear that this is a minority viewpoint.  Instead, you presented a viewpoint that is clearly your own, you mocked it ("Star Trek like existence"?), and used a minority opinion -- one I don't hear -- as a contrast to conservative opinion.  You might think it's fair to contrast a minority opinion with what you clearly view as the rational conservative opinion, but it's not.  You failed to make it clear that you were trying to comparing dissimilar things.  If you feel that your characterization of liberals makes for a fair comparison, you need to provide some evidence that it's true that they believe "the notion that we can make life on Earth perfect".</p>

<em>Agreed that you didn't say "all liberals". My apologies. However, you presented the viewpoint of what describe as "many liberals" and you quite failed to make it clear that this is a minority viewpoint.</em><br><br>Excuse me for not being perfect.  I guess my own lack of perfection is part of why I don't believe in the possibility of immanentizing the eschaton.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)  If I had gone deeply into it, I surely would have made that point, but I quickly moved on to another aspect of the topic.<br><br>Also consider the context: I just got done saying that SOME liberals and conservatives use fear to push their agenda.  Clearly I wasn't saying ALL liberals and conservatives do this.<br><br>I really didn't think anyone would think that either all/most liberals do believe this, or that I was trying to imply it.  Obviously, I was mistaken, and I should have further emphasized the point for those who might be confused.<br><br>And don't think I am insensitive to the issue: I've heard many liberals, many times, accuse "conservatives" or "Christian conservatives" or some variation of holding views that I don't hold, even though I am a member of those groups.  Some of those are majority views (gay marriage is bad), some are not (dark-skinned people are bad).  In either case, rarely do the liberal commentators discriminate even as much as I did, when I used the word "many."<br><br><em>Instead, you presented a viewpoint that is clearly your own</em><br><br>You say that as though it is a bad thing.  I don't see how.<br><br><em>you mocked it ("Star Trek like existence"?)</em><br><br>I didn't even make that up.  Did you listen to the very first Ask Pudge episode?  You asked a question that I answered on it, about Perl 6.  One of the other questions (by a liberal friend of mine) specifically asked why we, as a society, do not try to move more toward the poverty-lessness of Star Trek.  I was mocking it, but I didn't make it up, and I believe it is worthy of mockery.<br><br>Again, I am not mocking liberalism there, just this one view that many liberals hold.<br><br><em>and used a minority opinion -- one I don't hear -- as a contrast to conservative opinion.</em><br><br>But that was in the context of SOME liberals.  I was absolutely contrasting that to my, and conservative, opinion.  There's nothing wrong with that, and in doing so it does not imply that this view is a majority view.<br><br><em>You might think it's fair to contrast a minority opinion with what you clearly view as the rational conservative opinion, but it's not.</em><br><br>Of course it is.  It is only unfair if I mean to make that view out to be the dominant liberal view, which I did not do, either implicitly or explicitly.  There's nothing remotely unfair or wrong about it.  If I say, "many C programmers think Perl's expressiveness is harmful, but Perl programmers believe it is a good thing," I am not saying all C programmers think it is harmful, or implying it in any way.  Nor am I criticizing C itself, which has less expressiveness, because it certainly may be the case that this also has its clear benefits.<br><br><em>You failed to make it clear that you were trying to comparing dissimilar things.</em><br><br>I wasn't comparing dissimilar things.  I was comparing two ideas about how the world works.  Only in your mind -- not in mine -- does this have anything to do with majorities or minorities of certain ideological frameworks.<br><br><em>If you feel that your characterization of liberals makes for a fair comparison, you need to provide some evidence that it's true that they believe "the notion that we can make life on Earth perfect".</em><br><br>Come on<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... you are attacking the strawman you just apologized for attacking.<br><br>If you want some evidence that SOME liberals believe that, well, that's not hard.  From Condorcet's notion that there exists a science which can solve all of man's problems, to Lennon's statement that "All You Need Is Love," to today's Neo-Marxists (on display prominently at various antiwar demonstrations), there is simply no disputing it.  But I won't pretend to try to prove that "liberals" in general believe this, because I never stated it, I never implied it, and I don't believe it.<br>

<p>So to contrast this, I could make the following statement:</p>

<blockquote><div>Many conservatives are racist bastards who feel that non-white people are less intelligent than white people and are genetically predisposed to commit crime.  Liberals, quite rightly, reject this notion.</div></blockquote>

<p>One problem with that statement is that I've now lumped all liberals in the same category.  I doubt that many liberals would agree with the "many conservatives" viewpoint I present, but I'm sure that some do.  However, my statement about conservatives is completely accurate -- depending on how one chooses to define "many".</p>

<p>That's not the point, though.  If I posted that statement to my blog, I'd be ripped to shreds for it and quite rightly so.  Just because a statement is <em>technically</em> correct does not mean that the connotation matches its literal meaning.  As such, a skilled wordsmith can avoid being pinned down on just about anything ("I did not have sex with that woman!").</p>

Racism and liberalism are not mutually exclusive (although certainly, liberalism in America tends to reject it).  But the possibility of "immanentizing the eschaton" is, I believe, fundamentally opposed to what conservatism is.  It'd be like saying that "I'm sure some liberals believe we should not use government to improve the lives of the people."  That makes no sense; such a person isn't a liberal.<br><br><em>However, my statement about conservatives is completely accurate -- depending on how one chooses to define "many".</em><br><br>Sure.<br><br><em>That's not the point, though.

But I don't retract what I said, because I don't believe it was wrong.  I still don't buy your idea that there was anything wrong with the comparison part.  The problem was simply in inadvertantly leaving the impression, for some people, that I meant this was a pervasive idea among all or most liberals, when I didn't mean that at all.<br>

<p>But why compare non-pervasive ridiculous notions in the first place? Isn&#x2019;t that an excercise in futility? The fact that someone is liberal or conservative does not make them more or less likely to hold ridiculous views. What changes may be the particular form of crackpottery or the way it it is expressed. But either way, neither conservatives nor liberals (nor anarchists nor people of any other political view) are in any way protected from stupid ideas purely on account of their ideology.</p>

<p>This is the crux of the matter.</p>

<p>If you wanted to avoid such criticism, you would have compared a ridiculous liberal notion not against a reasonable conservative one, but against a reasonable <em>liberal</em> one. Changing multiple variables at once makes a comparison worthless unless you are trying to imply that they are correlated.</p>

<p>This is why people are correctly jumping at your throat for such a statement, and why they would have been correct to do so even if your statement was further qualified to point out that the liberal view you chose is not pervasive.</p>

<p>Perhaps a better wording would have been "a significant number of liberals" instead of "many liberals."</p>

<p> <i>Instead, you presented a viewpoint that is clearly your own, you mocked it ("Star Trek like existence"?)</i> </p>

<p>Have you listened to Ask Pudge episode 1?  Because one of the questions was <a href="http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=186286&amp;cid=15374865" title="slashdot.org">this</a slashdot.org>.  So in the full context of Ask Pudge, the whole "Star Trek post economy, everyone's needs could be filled if we'd just abandon capitalism/conservatism/greed" has been referenced before and is being referenced again.  And no, pudge doesn't have much respect for the viewpoint that <i>assumes</i> this is possible without proof (though he's certainly willing to tackle questions like, "if we did such and such, is it possible that that could really lead to something fantastic like that?")</p>

<p> <i>and used a minority opinion -- one I don't hear -- as a contrast to conservative opinion</i> </p>

<p>"Conservatives are all motivated by fear" and "Liberals all believe Star Trek's premise that scarcity could be eliminated if we didn't have greed (and laissez-faire capitalism)" are both strawmen arguments.  Neither one is true for a majority of conservatives/liberals.  They compare very well together.  I guess if you think that it's self-evident, rational, and relevant to say that conservatives are all motivated by fear, then maybe you wouldn't think the two assertions compare well.</p>

<p>Well, I certainly wouldn't say that many conservatives are motivated by fear.  In fact, I don't think the neo-cons who've hijacked (in my opinion) the conservative party are motivated by fear.  (Like many, I feel they find fear is a great tool for public manipulation).  So no, I don't think the comparison is unfair for this reason.</p>

<p>And for the record, my general opinion of what I view as "true" conservatives tends to be people who think that smaller government works better and the government should be staying the hell out of people's lives unless absolutely necessary.  That's a viewpoint I have a lot of sympathy for.  It's not a viewpoint that the current administration seems to share.</p>

<p>You and I are in complete agreement on that.  Which is why I've basically exited the Republican Party.  Of course, my belief in small government eventually caused me to become an anarcho-capitalist and repudiate politics entirely, so that may have something to do with it, too.  But I still wear the name conservative, and I still use it to mean "small government."</p>

<p>I've definitely had a lot of strange "impedence mismatch" moments with both liberals and "conservatives" when discovering that my definition of conservatism did not match up with theirs.  (When you believe that conservatism means government should not define marriage and that thus an anti-gay marriage amendment is wrong, you have a lot of these moments.)</p>

<p>To clarify previous post, you and I are in complete definition over that definition of conservatism.  I don't think we're in complete agreement in both accepting that as our own personal viewpoint, because I don't think (but could be wrong) that it's your viewpoint.</p>

<p>The problem I have with some conservatives is the same problem I have with some Christians.  Basically, what they preach and what they practice aren't the same thing.  This is hypocricy.  Frankly, I don't mind a little hypocricy now and then so long as the practitioner is willing to admit the error of their ways and <em>tries</em> to be better.  However, when they refuse to admit they are wrong, I have strong issues with this.  Unfortunately, while these might be minority positions, they seem to have had a disproportionately strong effect on the US political process.</p>

<p>Regarding hypocrisy, some Christian's are a case in point.  The following is presented with the view of Christianity I held when I was a Christian. (Much of the following is just from memory, so my apologies if I get little bits of it wrong.)</p>

<p>When the Pharisees presented Jesus with a coin with Caesar's image and asked if he should pay taxes (tribute) to Caesar, they presented him with what appeared to be an insoluble dilemma.  If he said "no", then the Romans could swoop down on him for advocating violating the law.  If he said "yes", his followers could accuse him of putting Caesar above God since the coin suggested Caesar's divinity.</p>

<p>However, Jesus neatly side-stepped this with his famous "Render unto Caeasar that which is Caesar's and unto God that which is God's" (that might be off slightly, but it's basically the same thing).  What Jesus did, with that one statement, is make it clear that separation of Church and state is something which Christians's do not have to reject.  A state must necessarily accept that the people in its borders often have a variety of differing views.  The role of the state, in this case, is to ensure that the expression of those views does not demonstrably harm the people over whom the state has jurisdiction.  While this clearly has grey areas, the state is perfectly within its rights to prohibit murder, theft, rape, and so on.  At no point in reading the Bible do I remember Jesus saying that a state had to enforce religious beliefs.</p>

<p>Some Christians in the US want their personal views encoded into law.  However, they ignore some pretty salient points of the Bible.  Remember when Christ protected the adultress from being stoned?  Why did he do that?  I think many fail to consider this.</p>

<p>However, it goes back even further.  If God did not want people to have the ability to choose, he wouldn't have put the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil in the Garden of Eden.  By putting it there, he was making it clear that Adam and Eve had the right to choose whether or not to sin.  If one is to be a Christian, what hubris compels them to deny a right which God granted?</p>

<p>More immediately, let's say that you just lock up everyone who sins.  Does physically preventing someone from physically doing something you consider sinful make them a better person?  No!  It merely prevents them from doing something you consider sinful.  As a result, laws designed to prevent sinful behavior, while they might protect society, don't do a damned thing in the eyes of God (in my opinion, of course).  Instead, people should be allowed to choose their path so long as the only people affected are consenting adults.  If they go to hell, that's <em>their choice, as given by the God of the Bible</em>.  I can tell you not to steal from me, but I have no right to tell you it's illegal to participate in consensual group sex.</p>

<p>Today, there are conservatives who espouse "conservative" ideals but who ignore those ideals as thoroughly as Falwell Christians ignore Christianity.  If the Republican party truly followed ideals of smaller government and state's rights, it would be a wonderful thing.  I wouldn't always agree with their approach, but I'd be one hell of a lot more likely to vote for them.</p>

<p>Everything you just said sounds like it could've come straight out of my mouth.  My wife and I talk about this all the time.  We believe God specifically prohibits Christians from governing others.  (And the maximum penalty church government can impose is putting people out of the church.)  I use the phrase "right to sin" a lot, with the same logic you do: God gives us the right to sin.  God believes in the right to sin.</p>

<p> <i>Frankly, I don't mind a little hypocricy now and then so long as the practitioner is willing to admit the error of their ways and tries to be better.</i> </p>

<p>You're welcome to point out any consistencies I ever express here.  I try to be very consistent.  Doing so, I take some pretty radical views sometimes.  But I strive for consistency, perhaps above all else.</p>

<p> <i>(Much of the following is just from memory, so my apologies if I get little bits of it wrong.)</i> </p>

<p>As near as I can tell, everything you said accurately agrees with my understanding of Christianity.</p>

<p> <i>However, Jesus neatly side-stepped this with his famous "Render unto Caeasar that which is Caesar's and unto God that which is God's" (that might be off slightly, but it's basically the same thing). What Jesus did, with that one statement, is make it clear that separation of Church and state is something which Christians's do not have to reject.</i> </p>

<p>Hmmm.  Never thought about it as separation of church and state.  I think of it as, "Don't you go using God as an excuse to not pay your taxes, you scoundrel!"  Here and everywhere else in the New Testament, submission to human government is commanded for Jesus's people.  It's well-worth noting that the government in question (Rome) was morally depraved: these taxes went to fund homosexual orgies, idolatrous worship, and immoral conquests.  And the tax collectors themselves got away with intentionally overcharging the people.  And in this context, Jesus says, "Pay up."  Wow.</p>

<p>Of course, I do not accept that Jesus ever grants His people the right to tax others.  In fact, the teaching for Jesus's people is "Do not steal."  I submit to taxation and law and specifically disclaim any right to tax or rule others.  Any official doing so and claiming to represent me is lying; I don't claim to have that authority, and haven't delegated it.</p>

<p> <i>A state must necessarily accept that the people in its borders often have a variety of differing views.</i> </p>

<p>As an anarcho-capitalist (and as a Christian), I accept the right of any size group of people to willingly form a state of whatever type they wish, as long as noone is compelled to participate against their will, although in a situation such as we have on earth right now, where each region is limited to only one existing state, I believe such a government is morally restricted to only protecting the rights of its citizens.</p>

<p> <i>The role of the state, in this case, is to ensure that the expression of those views does not demonstrably harm the people over whom the state has jurisdiction. While this clearly has grey areas, the state is perfectly within its rights to prohibit murder, theft, rape, and so on. At no point in reading the Bible do I remember Jesus saying that a state had to enforce religious beliefs.</i> </p>

<p> <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=2&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.free-market.net%2Fresources%2Fintroduction.html&amp;ei=SJYaRcmvLLq4aoyj3JwN&amp;sig=__rVYjD-kqD5QPZmLARzGXA_mmQAk=&amp;sig2=kemg4_uGKjYEHxLe2pEfQw" title="google.com">Here</a google.com>'s what I believe is the foundation of morality in terms of what a state can and cannot do.  (Nonreligious.)  I believe a state is an extension of self-defense: you possess the right to defend yourself, so you can form an organization with a group to defend that group.  Thus any compulsion a state exercises over anyone must be limited to defending rights.  Of course, voluntarily people may do much more with a state.</p>

<p> <i>At no point in reading the Bible do I remember Jesus saying that a state had to enforce religious beliefs.</i> </p>

<p>You are correct, sir.  In fact, Christians are prohibited from exercising judgment over those outside the church: see I Corinthians 5:12, and then read the entire chapter for context.  I see here a judicial authority given solely to a local church, with the maximum permitted penalty being to tell a person, "Bye, we can't accept your sin in our church anymore."</p>

<p> <i>Some Christians in the US want their personal views encoded into law. However, they ignore some pretty salient points of the Bible.</i> </p>

<p>Yep.  Like I Corinthians 5:12.</p>

<p> <i>Remember when Christ protected the adultress from being stoned? Why did he do that? I think many fail to consider this.</i> </p>

<p>I've been expressing this point from I Corinthians 5:12 for a long time, now, but I have to confess this implication of the story of the woman caught in adultery (John 8) only hit me last week.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)  The OT law was an earthly theocracy (and like all governments, I consider it to be a private relationship between the Governing and the governed).  It's necessary for all human governments to have penalties and consequences for violation of the law.  But the heavenly nation Christ sets up in the New Testament works completely differently.  And so in the transition period between Old and New, the time when Jesus was living on earth (because the New couldn't start until He had accomplished His death), He begins imposing these additional restrictions.  And one of them is that such a penalty can't be imposed without a sinless person to initiate it.  Christians thus can't engage in the kind of penalties that occurred in the OT any more.</p>

<p> <i>However, it goes back even further. If God did not want people to have the ability to choose, he wouldn't have put the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil in the Garden of Eden. By putting it there, he was making it clear that Adam and Eve had the right to choose whether or not to sin. If one is to be a Christian, what hubris compels them to deny a right which God granted?</i> </p>

<p>Nothing to say, other than I agree.</p>

<p> <i>More immediately, let's say that you just lock up everyone who sins. Does physically preventing someone from physically doing something you consider sinful make them a better person? No! It merely prevents them from doing something you consider sinful. As a result, laws designed to prevent sinful behavior, while they might protect society, don't do a damned thing in the eyes of God (in my opinion, of course).</i> </p>

<p>Again I agree, and have said basically exactly the same thing, often.  I have a picture from Kiev, Ukraine, of the ruler Vladimir, who learned from his Bible that everybody needed to be baptized, and so he commanded the entire nation (village?  I'm not sure how many people this was.) to be baptized, on pain of death.  Same story with Charlemagne.  Such accomplishes nothing; baptism must be united with belief (Mark 16:16).  So, while you qualified that this is just your opinion -- it can be backed up with Scripture.</p>

<p> <i>Instead, people should be allowed to choose their path so long as the only people affected are consenting adults. If they go to hell, that's their choice, as given by the God of the Bible. I can tell you not to steal from me, but I have no right to tell you it's illegal to participate in consensual group sex.</i> </p>

<p>100% agreement.  And as for your last sentence, I believe that is exactly what government is entitled to do, period, without any reference to religion.  To assert that government can exert force for any cause other than to defend rights is to assert that people have rights over each other, and have delegated them to the government.  As I believe in self-ownership, as an inviolable principle that cuts across all lines of belief, I can't accept a right for government to do any more than this.</p>

<p> <i>Today, there are conservatives who espouse "conservative" ideals but who ignore those ideals as thoroughly as Falwell Christians ignore Christianity. If the Republican party truly followed ideals of smaller government and state's rights, it would be a wonderful thing. I wouldn't always agree with their approach, but I'd be one hell of a lot more likely to vote for them.</i> </p>

<p>I will never vote for a politician again.  All politicians assert their right to govern over people regardless of consent.  As a Christian I can't support this, and even if I were not a Christian it would violate self-ownership.</p>

<p>Sure I am.  I'm teaching the Gospel of Jesus Christ, which is a far more effective way to combat every problem people want to solve with government.  And as I understand that Gospel, abandoning any claims we have of the right to govern each other is essential.</p>

<p>From a secular point of view, persuading people to relinquish this claim is also the way to eventual success.  You cannot achieve a society that doesn't believe it has a right to vote on each other's affairs by voting.

<p>BTW, ironically I rechallenged my pacifism yesterday (not as a result of the discussion here, in case you were wondering) in light of some new thoughts I had about some of the words of Jesus.  Still a pacifist, but always reconsidering.</p>

<p>Well, with all this feedback, I for one am anxious for next week's installment of Ask Pudge!<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

This has easily been the most feedback I've ever gotten so far.  It's no small wonder people like Ann Coulter say terrible things; it gives them attention, fame, and money.<br><br>I am sad to say such a path is uninteresting to me.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)  Hell, if I was prone to do what I was accused of doing, I would have actually said what I was accused of saying!<br>

<p>Ah, well.  Maybe I can come up with a non-controversial Ask Pudge question for you, or something.</p>

No, ask any question you want.  I just won't seek out anything controversial, and I won't intentionally say outrageous things to anger anyone.<br>
