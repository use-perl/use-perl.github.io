<div class="span8">
<p>I just uploaded a new version of <a href="http://dev.macperl.org/files/scripts/happening">happening</a>, my perl script that can update iChat status with what program you are running, what you are listening to, etc.<br/><br/>This release makes one feature work better (setting iChat image) and adds a new feature (screen saver images).<br/><br/>I added one feature a little while ago, and made it work better this time: making your iChat icon match the album cover of the track you are listening to in iTunes.  I just ripped my entire CD collection to lossless and put in album covers for all but a few of the CDs, so that's kinda nice to have.<br/><br/>And while on the subject of album covers, I added a related new feature.  See, I have a laptop in my stereo closet, and it is hooked up to the amp and to the TV.  When I press the "Music" button on my <a href="http://www.harmoneyremote.com/">Harmony Remote</a>, the TV shows the laptop screen and the amp switches to the USB digital output from the laptop.<br/><br/>Just looking at the iTunes interface gets boring, and while I can see the small album cover in the bottom of the screen, I wanted it big.  So now the album cover not only gets set as the iChat icon, but it gets saved to a temp folder.  Then I set my screen saver to come on in the shortest interval (3 minutes), and to randomly select a picture from that folder.  Now the screen saver is showing the album cover of the song I am listening to.<br/><br/>There's probably better ways to do that, but I couldn't find any, and I figured this would be fun to play with.<br/><br/>So now if you see a big album cover on my TV or you see my iChat icon changing regularly to match what I am listening to, you know why.<br/><br/>Coming up next is a script I use to rip my entire iTunes collection to a new library at a lower bitrate, that I use to sync to my iPod.  But it is running on a PowerBook G3/500, and so it is going to take about week to finish converting my 130+ GB of tunes, and then I have some more work to do on the script to clean it all up.

<h2>FLAC or SHN?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Phred/">Phred</a> on 2004-10-14T21:20:51</h3>
Did you rip your cd's to <a href="http://flac.sourceforge.net/" title="sourceforge.net">FLAC</a sourceforge.net> or SHN?  Flac looks like the promising standard.  You can encode the tracks with quite a bit of metadata.

Apple Lossless.  It's very similar to FLAC, and it is built-in to iTunes.
