<p>This weekend wasn't horrible, but it wasn't great.<br/><br/>First, my TiBook decided to freeze for no apparent reason, in both Mac OS and in Mac OS X.  "Freeze" as in "needs three-finger salute."  No love.<br/><br/>Next, my printer dies.  Epson Color Stylus 777i.  There are pieces in there that look broken.  The printer is out of the reach of the pets, so they didn't break it, and I don't recall breakdancing in the general vicinity of it, so I don't know how it happened, but it is unusable.  I thought about buying a new one, but I am going to wait for Mac OS X 10.2 and get one that reportedly works well with it.  But I just spent over $50 on ink cartridges, which is probably about as much as a new damned printer will cost.<br/><br/>Then, my TiBook decided to continue freezing, early and often.  I could not find the Hardware Test CD that (supposedly) came with it, though I did run various tests with TechTool Pro, and Apple is sending me a CD.  I suspect I will need to send them my computer to fix, which means I need to move all my data to another computer (thankfully, I have extras lying about) and be without my TiBook for awhile, risking not getting it back in time for YAPC.<br/><br/>Then I wake up to remember I forgot to set the TiVo to record the World Cup games.  I was able to record half the second game and all the third game, but missed the first game, USA vs. Korea*.  They'll replay it twice today, though, so I set the TiVo to catch the 3 p.m. showing.  If you know who won, don't tell me, because I will destroy you.  And your computer.  Then you'll understand better how my weekend has gone.<br/><br/>* Last night on the NBC Nightly News, the anchor said the US was going to be playing South Korea in World Cup action.  No, it is the Korea Republic, which includes North and South Korea, isn't it?  I'd look it up to be sure (I am 90 percent sure), but I fear seeing a result for this morning's game.  :-)

  I'm a bit too tired to research it thoroughly, but I'm 99% sure that the Republic of Korea is South Korea. The former is their official name, the latter the colloquial one. I <em>very</em> much doubt that Japan or South Korea would have accepted co-organisation with North Korea, and that the US would have accepted to attend a competition co-organised by the Axis of Evil<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)

  I didn't get to see the game, but the outcome is rather cool imho. Kudos on beating Portugal, it bothered quite a few of my portuguese friends here<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

I dunno, N. Korea and S. Korea joined forces for the last Summer Olympics.  Regardless, ESPN said it was South Korea<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... I dunno.  Their team page doesn't say.<br> <br>It was a pretty good game, but I was significantly annoyed that the Korean goal-scorer mimed a speed skater after scoring, a reference to the South Korean speed skater who violated a rule in the Winter Olympics and was eliminated, losing the gold medal to American Apolo Anton Ohno.  From the "your-skater-messed-up-let-it-go" dept.<br>
