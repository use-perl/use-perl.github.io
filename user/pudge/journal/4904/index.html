NRA, Rush Limbaugh, NRA, Rush Limbaugh, NRA, Rush Limbaugh.  "I own guns.  Guns are cool!  Government isn't cool when it talks about guns.  Except for John Ashcroft!  Yeah!  My cock grows to nearly four inches in length when Charlton Heston pulls the strings and John Ashcroft's mouth moves!  Isn't it funny how Ashcroft sounds like Moses?!  I wonder if that's why the US has its tongue up Irael's ass?  Peace, out."<p>

You're just jealous.

<p>Jealous? No. Nervous, perhaps. Distinctly uncomfortable, definately. The thought of someone who, like myself, most likely spent a good deal of his formative high-school years being subjected to mocking and derision by the "jocks" and other more-popular cliques, advocating gun ownership and demonizing those who think differently, <i>that</i> alarms me.</p>

I don't know how much I have been mocked and derided into relation to you, but I advocate gun ownership, and think that people who disregard or wish to remove the Second Amendment are aiming to destroy a fundamental democratic principle and imporant right.  Do I alarm you?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:D  Hm.  Don't answer that.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)<br>

The right to revolt is good.  The "right" of violent criminals and would-be criminals to purchase guns on the cheap without background checks via gun shows<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... not so good.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<p>

Guns are fun.  We went to a shooting range before our wedding.  The Dirty Harry<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.44 Magnum was awesome.  But in the hands of the coffee-filled former postal worker who cuts me off in traffic and then loses control when I flip him the bird<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... more fearsome than awesome.</p><p>

All this NRA all-or-nothing "they came for the [X], and I didn't say anything" slippery slope argument bullshit gets in the way of an actual debate about whether there's a middle-ground whereby I don't get shot at the Chucky Cheese by a 12 year old with a rat phobia, and hunters can still dress in camouflage and shoot each other by accident during designated times of the year.</p><p>

&gt; PS, Every time you kill, God masturbates a kitten.<br>&gt; Or something. <br> <br>Oh dear... I find that statement deeply disturbing, but I can't determine precisely why.<br> <br>I think I'm just going to have to stop killing so that I need not worry about it any further!<br> <br>-matt<br>
