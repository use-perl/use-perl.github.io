<p>OK, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0051308/">Lucas shot a rifle</a> and not a shotgun, but still.<br/><br/>I fired a shotgun for the first time in my life on Sunday.  A 12-gauge Beretta over-and-under, trap model.  The bottom barrel is a full choke, which means the shot stays together longer; the top barrel is modified, so it has a wider spread, making it easier to hit those flying discs.<br/><br/>I joked with my brother-in-law that I'd be happy to hit with just one of the 50 shells I had.  Of course, that would not make me happy.  But it'd be better than missing them all.<br/><br/>For my first shot, I used the (harder to hit with) bottom barrel.  I planted my left foot in front, put most of my weight on it, crouched down a little, and closed my left eye (it's far more powerful than my right, so I can't clean it open unless it's covered) as I sighted the front of the tower.  I meekly coughed "pull!" and followed the clay pigeon up to the left, and just as it reached its peak, I pulled the trigger.<br/><br/>Shards of pigeon flew every which way.  Victory is mine.<br/><br/>I dunno how much of it was beginner's luck though, as the rest of my day saw me hitting only about 4 out of 25 shots with the full choke.  But I hit about 18 of 25 with the modified choke, so that's still pretty good for a beginner.<br/><br/>It's the stationary targets I have trouble with ... if you're breaking into my house, pretend I'm a grizzly bear, and just stand still.<br/><br/>Speaking of Lucas McCain -- you know, The Rifleman -- I picked up three episodes of The Rifleman on DVD for $1 at Target.  The had a whole box of DVDs of old TV shows, and they don't even give you a case for the disc: it's got gummy glue on the label side, attached to the inside of a cheap cardboard box.  Nice way to mass produce some of this stuff people wouldn't spend much money for.<br/><br/>Today I went skiing.  First time this season.  I've not played hockey since Christmas 2004 either, so I am just out of shape.  By mistake I went to an intermediate trail for my first run, and my legs were burning trying to navigate the several inches of powder.  I got better as the day wore on, of course.<br/><br/>Until we decided to go home, and I left my skis behind, which I didn't realize until I got home.  We called them, and they said they would look.  We'll call again in the morning.  I *really* hope they find them.  I am optimistic.
