<div class="span8">
<p>Thanks to Thomas Wegner, a lot more is working now in MacPerl 5.6.1.  File::Temp is happy, even File::DosGlob, and File::Spec::Mac is happier.<br/><br/>File::Spec::Mac still has some work left in it, which I am going to mail p5p about.<br/><br/>So currently, all tests pass on MacPerl, except: tests that require fork; some known breakage in sprintf with our version of sfio; system() not returning a usable value; and sysopen not giving a warning on writes to a readonly file.<br/><br/>Except that now Matthias has ressurrected old MacPerl behavior, in part, of formatting error messages, so that on writes to a socket (Apple event, filehandle, whatever) a message is formatted to look like an MPW-style error message.  This causes significant problems for about five different tests.  Yay.  I am not sure what to do about it.  I am thinking that I might want to make some sort of switch or global or pragma for disabling the MPW formatting.<br/><br/>For now, I am just running the tests with the formatting off; that way, at least I can verify the tests do pass.<br/><br/>There are two camps that want the MPW formatting: MPW users :-) and BBEdit users.  The problem of BBEdit is not one of Bare Bones code; they already have code to parse Unix perl error messages, as they use it in Mac OS X.  But there are a lot of users out there using old versions of BBEdit, so they can't retrofit very easily.<br/><br/>Just a late-night random thought: perhaps they could come up with a patch to old versions of BBEdit for MacPerl support?  It would basically check the MacPerl version, and use a different parsing code for 5.6.1 and greater.  We could even distribute links to the updaters with MacPerl.</p>
