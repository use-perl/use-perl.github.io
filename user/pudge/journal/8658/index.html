<p>I just had an idea for a story about musicians selling their soul to the devil for a hit song, but it turns out that so many musicians sell their soul for a hit song that the market is oversaturated, and the songs don't all become the big hits that the devil promised.  I don't have an ending, but maybe the musicians could sue for their souls back (though that would be a little too Dan'l Webster-ish), or perhaps it could turn out that an industry executive, who is controlling which songs get airplay, is really the devil.  Oooooo.

<h2>This show was on TV when?</h2>

One of the first episodes of <a href="http://www.visimag.com/culttimes/cx58_instant.htm" title="visimag.com"> <i>G vs E</i> </a visimag.com> (also eventually titled <i>Good vs Evil</i>) had a plot about Chandler and McNeil trying to get a heavy metal musician to renounce his Faustian deal.  Alice Cooper even made an appearance, IMSMR.

Sure, there have been many TV shows about musicians selling their souls, but in my idea, the key is that there are just too many of them selling their souls for the market to handle.<br> <br>Oo, I have another possible ending: the executive is the one who sold HIS soul, and the bargain was to get the other musicians to sell their souls so he could get musicians with hit records, but they don't all necessarily get hit records because of some loophole having to do with their deals coming as a result of his deal.<br> <br>Nah, still too Dan'l Webster-ish.<br>

<h2>Melancholy Elephants</h2>

Clever idea.  Sounds like a twilight zone episode to me.<p>

A nice irony is that this parable about copyrights has been plastered across the Internet, often without attribution to the author.</p>



<h2>Harlan Ellison</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jordan/">jordan</a> on 2002-10-29T16:51:44</h3>
Has a novel out with the theme of a guy selling his soul to be a rock star.<br> <p>Never read it, though.<br> </p><p>I like the angle of the exec who sells his soul with the proviso that he recruit others.  That's an interesting spin on the Faust story, IMO.  It's also darn close to what happens in the music business these days.  Some guy enters the business with ideals and a fresh sound, but inevitably ends up corrupted by the system, putting out the same crap as everybody else.</p>



<h2>Crossroads</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ziggy/">ziggy</a> on 2002-10-30T19:08:43</h3>
I think I saw that movie.  It starred Ralph Macchio (gasp!), and all of the guitar parts were played by Joe Satriani.  Ralph got to keep his soul because his (er, Joe's) guitar playing was so much better than the Devil's guitar warrior (played by Joe Satriani).

Yes, I saw that movie too.  It is one of dozens of different stories to have this theme running through it.  Even O Brother, Where Art Thou has this going on.

<p>Both are based on the story of Robert Johnson, who wrote the song Crossroads (gosh, I love that song), and was purported to have sold his soul to the devil, which is probably where most of the stories about musicians selling their souls come from.

Yes the name of the movis was CROSSROADS..about Robert Johnson..Starring Ralph Machio (hehehe)he should have been a member of Menudo, ANYWAY..the guitar parts are by Steve Vai..whom is also in the movie. It is actually a good movie if you omitt Ralph Machio!
