<div class="span8">
<p>I thought Mel Gibson's <em>The Passion of the Christ</em> was a beautiful (though certainly flawed) movie.  It was a bit gruesome in parts -- I, who have no serious problems watching violence in movies, had to turn away in one scene -- but so too was the actual event.  A lot of people criticized the movie because the event, to them, is beautiful, and "Christianity is not about love, not violence."<br/><br/>But like much of Christianity, the crucifixion has a dual nature.  It is not, as the great theologian Sam Donaldson said on ABC News, merely about love.  It's about how that love was expressed:  through suffering.  Without the suffering, without the sacrifice, the event has no meaning.  As the prophet Isaiah wrote, "by his scourging we are healed."<br/><br/>Accordingly, the song that follows (originally recorded by The Choir, then by The Lost Dogs) captures well the crucifixion's dual nature.  Have a good Good Friday.
<blockquote>Go on up to the mountain of mercy
To the crimson perpetual tide
Kneel down on the shore
Be thirsty no more
Go under and be purified<br/><br/>Follow Christ to the holy mountain
Sinner sorry and wrecked by the fall
Cleanse your heart and your soul
In the fountain that flows
For you and for me and for all<br/><br/>At the wonderful, tragic, mysterious tree
On that beautiful scandalous night you and me
Were atoned by His blood and forever washed white
On that beautiful, scandalous night<br/><br/>On the hillside you will be delivered
At the foot of the cross justified
And your spirit restored
By the river that pours
From our blessed Savior's side<br/><br/>At the wonderful, tragic, mysterious tree
On that beautiful scandalous night you and me
Were atoned by His blood and forever washed white
On that beautiful, scandalous night<br/><br/>You carried the sin of mankind on Your back
And the sky went black<br/><br/>Go on up to the mountain of mercy
To the crimson perpetual tide
Kneel down on the shore
Be thirsty no more
Go under and be purified<br/><br/>At the wonderful, tragic, mysterious tree
On that beautiful scandalous night you and me
Were atoned by His blood and forever washed white
On that beautiful, scandalous night
On that beautiful, scandalous night
On that beautiful, scandalous night
Miraculous night</blockquote></p>
