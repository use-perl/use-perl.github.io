<p>I felt much the same way a year and a half ago. After living with subversion since then I find it rather scary that I  used CVS for so long. If you are anything like me you'll quickly find that you were so used to CVS's deficiencies that you didn't realise how much it was crippling you.</p>

<p>So - give subversion (or svk, or darcs, or even arch<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-) a try - it's fun!</p>

So you will give me a week to make the switch, set up a server, port my many scripts<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... ?  Didn't think so!

Heh<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-) Where's the Free Time Fairy when you need her.
