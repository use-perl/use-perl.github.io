<BLOCKQUOTE>Law-related blogs -- known as "blawgs" -- have sprung up with the rise of the blogging self-publishing trend in general.</BLOCKQUOTE>
That's one of the dumbest things I've ever read.  Please go kill yourself for inventing that word.  But only after <A HREF="http://www.cnn.com/2003/LAW/12/26/toddlers.claim.ap/index.html">this woman</A> kills herself:
<BLOCKQUOTE>A 2-year-old model and actor who cut his head at a playground is seeking unspecified lost wages and other compensation from the city.<br/><br/>Konrad Mader of Greenwich was running toward a treehouse at a playground November 4 when he crashed into a railing, according to a claim filed last week by his mother.... The blond toddler received several stitches.<br/><br/>In a letter to officials, she demanded compensation for medical bills, pain and suffering and a "lost wage amount due to his inability to audition or take modeling or commercial jobs while his head heals."<br/><br/>Mader blamed the boy's injury on a green railing, which she said blends in with the landscaping. Mader said the railing should be painted a brighter color.</BLOCKQUOTE>
Die please.  Please.  I'm asking nicely.</p>

While I've nver heard of it being referred to as a blawg (so far, but some idiot will eventually sink that low), Pamela Jone's site 'groklaw' has grown from its blog origins to now being the premier news site for Linux law related issues (currently and for quite a while it has been dominated by SCO vs. IBM &amp; RHat &amp; [soon] Novell &amp; [someday] a horde of thousands).<p>
Even if law is something you find boring, and SCO is something you think of as oft-repeated hype, that site is fascinating to visit.  People get excited and astounded by legal statements (IBM's and SCO's respectively) on a regular basis; and the clear lay person explanations mean that it is non-lawyers that are feeling those emotions.</p>

No, I don't find law boring at all.  I've been known to dissect Supreme Court opinions for fun.  It is merely the term "blawg" (dammit, you made me say it again<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-) that I find extraordinarily offensive.
