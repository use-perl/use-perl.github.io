Maybe I'm missing something, but have you checked System Preferences &gt; Energy Saver &gt; Schedule  does what you need?<br> <br>You can ask your computer to wakeup at 3:00 am and cron Backup.app to run at 3:15...<br> <br>Best regards,

<h3><a href="/user/pudge/">pudge</a> on 2004-04-05T21:09:03</h3>
No<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... there's no way to tell it to wake up, only to startup, sleep, or shut down.  In theory, the start up does a "wakepoweron", which should both wake and turn power on, but it doesn't work for me in practice.  Go figure.

Hey I had the same problem, I built a Cocoa solution using
the IOPowerManager interface, dailyWakeup. When periodic
daily then runs I have it requeue a request for the next day.<br/><br/>I also wrote a GUI interface to the timer queue ( Cocoa
based).<br/><br/>My main problem is that when I wake the box up, it won't
stay awake very long, just three or four minutes even though
the energy saver panel is set for 15 minutes.<br/><br/>Details at: http://homepage.mac.com/levanj/Cocoa<br/><br/>

Yes, I just saw that yesterday.  I was going to ask you if you know why I would have something scheduled for wakeup, that sometimes it won't wake up at all.

If you look at the system log, I bet it will show the wakeup
did take place, it probably went back to sleep before the
task fired. I find that I have to fiddle a bit to get the wakeup
close enought to task time. Cron only checks one a minute...<br/><br/>Jerry

No, I had the wakeup scheduled hours before it went to sleep, then it went to sleep, and it never woke up hours later, when it was scheduled to.

Nope, I never thought about it<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) I suspect each keydown, mousemotion probably sets a watchdog timer, since nothing
gets moved/pressed it is not clear to me what would happen...<br/><br/>Jerry

Putting it in<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/etc/daily.local will guarantee it is run before the computer goes back to sleep?  It looks to me (from looking at daily.out) that stuff from daily won't run unless the computer is awake at the time.
