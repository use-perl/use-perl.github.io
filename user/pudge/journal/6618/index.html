<p>While most everyone else is at TPC, I am at home playing with the new 60mm telescope my wife bought me.  It's way cool.  Aside from the regular stuff, it has a computer so it can automatically find celestial objects, and you can hook that computer up to your PC and control it with the included software.<br/><br/>The CD even comes with ActivePerl (yes, it's Windows; I am running it under Virtual PC), to script the telescope, but the software is only scriptable for a certain number of days before you have to pay.  Well, if I am able to hook it up to my Mac and control it via Virtual PC, I might do that at some point.  For now, I am just learning to use the thing.<br/><br/>It also comes with an "electronic" eyepiece, for plugging the telescope into a video source, like a video camera or TV.  So I can sit in my living room, control the telescope from the computer, and watch it on TV.  OK, that's all a bit too perverse.<br/><br/>I can see me spending a lot of money on eyepieces and such for this thing.  Gotta take it slow.  :-)

Is this a Meade?  What model?<br> <br>Must be nice to see the sky.  I have a big honking street light dead center in front of my house.  In the back, my neighbors have motion sensitive porch lights.<br>

It's a Meade 2060-AT.  We have virtually no neighbors; two street lights, both at a distance; surrounded primarily by the state forest and farms, so very little city light noise; and the house is up on a hill.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br>
