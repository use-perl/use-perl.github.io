<div class="span8">
<p>Let's go back to 2004.<br/><br/>The Patriots won 21 games straight, going back to 2003.  That streak ended at the hands of the Steelers, and the then-lossless Ben Roethlisberger.  The Patriots would not lose another game -- including handing Big Ben his first-ever loss -- until the 2005 season.<br/><br/>Except for one.<br/><br/>December 20, 2004, the Partriots travel to Miami, and Tom Brady gets intercepted four times (for some perspective, he has only five INTs this season so far) and A.J. Feely threw none, and Sammy Morris scored two TDs, and the Dolphins won 29-28.<br/><br/>The Pats ended the year 17-2, and the Dolphins 4-12.<br/><br/>Of course, Feely is now with the Eagles (where he just missed upsetting the Patriots a few weeks ago), and Sammy Morris now plays for the Patriots.  But the Dolphins also beat the Pats in 2005 (granted, that year, the Dolphins actually had a winning record) and 2006.<br/><br/>In 2005, the teams were close in the standings, and the Pats had their worst season in years, and lost at home 28-26.  In 2006, the Pats had a 12-4 record, the Dolphins were 6-10, and the Pats went on to just miss going to the Super Bowl.  And in Week 14, the Dolphins shut the Patriots out in Miami, 21-0.<br/><br/>Twenty-one to nothing.  Just a year ago.  The only shutout the Patriots have suffered since the 31-0 shutout the Bills handed them in week 1 of 2003 (which the Patriots avenged in week 17, with a 31-0 shutout over the Bills).<br/><br/>Granted, this is an undefeated New England and almost-winless Miami, the by-far-best against the by-far-worst.  On the other hand, the 2007 Dolphins want no win more than this one, and have beaten the Patriots in their second meeting of the season three years in a row, including a shutout last year.

<p>Thanks<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...thanks for the reminder<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...</p>

<p>From a best ever record of 13-3 last season to what looks like a tie for the worst record ever of 4-12
