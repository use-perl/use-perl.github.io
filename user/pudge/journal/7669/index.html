<p>I've been really put off by all this September 11 memorial stuff.  Jon Stewart summed up my feelings nicely, as he often does:<br/><br/><BLOCKQUOTE>
I don't think that we're far enough away from this event to be doing this, quite frankly.  Now, I understand, you may say, "Well, we do this for all events.  In fact, the Civil War, hell, we have reenactments of that."  But we didn't in 1865, is my point.

Back then people <strong>remembered</strong> things!  Things that happened <em>years</em> earlier!
</p>
<p>
Now I'm doing well just to remember which of Ira[qn] took hostages in 1980.

I believe that was whichever one the U.S. didn't give the chemical weapons to.

<p>Nothing is forever<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) It was Iran back in the day that the Shah of Iran was having problems with the Ayatollah Khomeni. Taking hostages seems so quaint in comparison to these days.</p>

<h2>Remembering</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jdavidb/">jdavidb</a> on 2002-09-11T14:05:49</h3>
<p>To me, remembering is how I honor those who died.  Their lives were lost suddenly, horribly.  On Sep. 12 last year, I saw a picture of someone falling to their death from the towers, and I thought, "That was the last seconds of that person's life.  No one will ever hear from them again.  I will never personally get the chance to meet them.  They lived, had friends and/or family, had a life that meant something, and now are dead."  I resolved that those people would not be forgotten.</p>

<p>I understand we all have very different reactions to this.  Some of us would like to completely forget everything.  Most of us would like to move on.  In all that, I take today as a time to remember, to preserve the memory of those lost, and the horrible events that shook this nation.</p>

We've been preserving the memories for a year now.  There is no danger that they will be forgotten.

<p>I know.  I'm not worried you will forget.  I'm not worried anyone else will forget, or that I'll forget.  I'm just explicitly remembering.</p>

I wish more people would remember to remember August 6th.
<p>
(That's 1945, for those of you with failing memories.)</p>

I don't know.  I hugged someone I loved for a few minutes and called it good.
<p>
I've always thought it's more important to focus on what's ahead than what's past, especially in a situation like this.  I like to think that the best way to honor the dead is to continue living.

Good thing I don't watch the news, I guess...</p>
