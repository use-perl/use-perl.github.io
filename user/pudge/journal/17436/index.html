<h1>Wrist Surgery</h1>

<div class="span8">
<p>Back in early October I hurt my wrist (probably playing hockey), and after two trips to the family doctor, one to an orthopedist, three x-rays, one MRI, and then a trip to a wrist specialist, it's been determined that I have damage to the TFCC (cartilage between ulna and hand) in my left wrist.<br/><br/>The symptoms are primarily a nagging, constant pain that I could possibly live with, but also include signficantly reduced strength and increased susceptibility to significant pain, when twisting or lifting.  Plus, I can't type for as many hours in the day as I used to.<br/><br/>Possible treatments include waiting for it to heal (it's been over 4 months), cortizone (not permanent), arthroscopy, and osteotomy.<br/><br/>Osteotomy would involve removing a section from the ulna, shortening it (my ulna is a couple mm too long, which may have predisposed me to the injury, and shortening it might relieve the pain and also help prevent further injury).  It would also be a significant surgery that would lay me up for months.<br/><br/>The clear winner here is arthroscopy.  They want to try to repair it, but that's usually not an option for this type of injury: first, because it's been so long and the tissue probably can't be repaired, and second, because it's in the center of the cartilage, so it is hard to get to for repair.  So, they'll likely remove the damaged portion.  From what I understand, I'll take 1-2 weeks off from using it for typing, and another 2-3 months for full recovery, and return to hockey.<br/><br/>Surgery's scheduled for March 12.  I go out to a Slashdot meeting in MI on March 18 anyway, so that gives me a little more time to not type.</p>

and get well soon<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)



<h2>Hockey injuries</h2>

I've had my share of hockey injuries as well. My worst was when I broke my ankle in three places and needed screws to put it back together. Medicine being what it is, I'd say I'm back to 95% on that ankle with the only real side-effect being some soreness on cold days.<br> <br><br/><br/>The real effect has been much greater, however. My wife started a three strikes and you're out program for hockey. Three major injuries and she says I can't play anymore. Now, we argue about the meaning of "major" injury, of course. My count is at one (the ankle). She is at two because of a cut I got when a puck hit me in the head and cut me through my helmet. It was only a few stitches, so I don't think it counts.<br> <br><br/><br/>Good luck with whatever you choose!

I would say a major injury is one that is permanently, or long-term, debilitating.  Stitches don't count!

<h2>Smooth recovery</h2>

Best wishes on a smooth recovery.  Your injury is  super-sucky for programmers.  Perhaps Dragon Speak
(or its Mac equivalent) would be helpful in offloading some of the burden from your wrists?
<p>Get well soon, pudge-daddy.</p>

Thanks.  I don't think this will be something I need to resort to speech recognition for.  I hope.<br> <br>All you liberals should pray I get better, because if I have to leave programming, I might enter politics instead!<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)

Threats! Hey, I have it on good authority your wrist injury was inflicted during a rather vigorous session of self-abuse. Catholics go blind and protestants get carpal!<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) Drudge would have a field day!<br/><br/>Aside from the evil thought of you in politics, get well soon<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
