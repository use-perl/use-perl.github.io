<p>Tariq Aziz is a christian ? Didn't know that, but googling for it confirms that <i>Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz is
the only Christian member of Saddam Hussein's cabinet</i>. Moreoever he's a <a href="http://www.chaldeansonline.net/" title="chaldeansonline.net">Chaldean</a chaldeansonline.net>. </p>
<p>Reminds me : back in the centuries where Baghdad was the capital of an empire largest than the Roman Empire, the Khalif was a sunnit muslim, (of course, this was a theocracy), but it was not uncommon to have chiit / christian / jewish or zoroastrian ministers and tax collectors. At this time, this was considered a good policy, to avoid ethnic and religious tensions among citizens. (In contemporary Iraq, all cults seem to coexist anyway with the neo-stalinist cult of the almighty leader and demigod Saddam, but there's still <a href="http://www.chaldeansonline.net/chaldeanews/chaldean_nun.html" title="chaldeansonline.net">religious murders</a chaldeansonline.net>.)</p>

The older Muslim empires, Ottomans, Seljuks, Mamluks, Abbassasids, Umayyids, were far more cosmopolitan and urban than the fundamentalist muslims allow. There was certainly a tolerance (although not exactly "approval") of other faiths "of the book" that appears to be waning now. But then, since when are extermists ever interested in the truth?

<em>But then, since when are extermists ever interested in the truth?</em> <br> <br>This statement appears to assume the extremists don't have the truth.  How closed-minded of you!

I've never seen them all together, but then again, if they had a teleportation device like <a href="http://www.alexchiu.com/" title="alexchiu.com">Alex Chiu</a alexchiu.com> talks about, it is possible.  Then again, Alex Chiu is a Christian, too!  Aieeeeee!
