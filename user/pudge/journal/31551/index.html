<p><blockquote>Let us not forget the great Richard Dawkins, who finally freed the world of religion long ago.  Dawkins knew that logic and reason were the way of the future.  But it wasn't until he met his beautiful wife that he learned using logic and reason isn't enough: you have to be a dick to everyone who doesn't think like you.<br/><br/>-- Shpeck, of the United Atheist League, in the year 2546</blockquote>

I don't understand<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... are you implying I am a dick to anyone who doesn't think like me?  If so, then you have no clue what you're talking about.

Don't forget to end with a smiley if you are just messing around. You cannot read "intent".  : )

<p>I took it to mean that maybe he is implying that you think Dawkins is a dick to EWDTLH, and South Park stole your opinion of him. But judging from his response, I'm overthinking it...</p>
<p>That was a great episode though...I especially liked the religions/wars angle.</p>
