<p>I was watching Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent, and a wife sees email on her husband's account from "SexyRita", and she immediately grows concerned, and reads it, and finds out it was in response to a personal ad ... but what are the chances that email from someone by that name is *real*, and not spam?  PLEASE!

<h2>clever spam</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/gav/">gav</a> on 2002-04-29T14:50:20</h3>
Since my email is gavin@ I've been getting some worrying spam recently like:
<blockquote><div>
gavin, Have you thought about refinancing your house?
<p>
gavin, Would you like to see hot cheerleaders naked?</p>
</div></blockquote>
Coupled with an innocent subject these could really freak out an spouse. She could worry that I'm going to take the money I've made from refinacing and run off with horny cheerleaders! Didn't they say that the internet was a leading cause of divorice...

Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent rules<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... I LOVE that show!



<h2>This just happened.</h2>

A friend of mine just got spam from "Sandra", basically saying "Here are the sexy photos you asked for in your classified ad."<br/><br/>His girlfriend was using his computer and managed to read it. Wanted to know who the hell Sandra was.
