<p>&lt;<i>sigh of frustration</i>&gt; 
I'm not sure what to do with myself..... So things are looking bleak, at best, at work. The workload is diminishing, our projects are ending, our responsiblities are vanishing. Mergers can do that to groups, especially unwanted groups. <p> What do I do? <p>
<ul>
<li> look for another job
<li> return to school
<li> ride this job out and hope for the best
<li> eat lots of icecream
</ul>
It wouldn't be that bad if I wasn't married, and if I had a degree, however, I am, and I don't. Currently I have the flexabality to work full tiem while going to school part time. The last 3 years hear have really been a blessing, a blessing that is drawing to an end. It makes me regret that I wasn't so ambitious towards school while I had it easy over the last little while. The way things are looking now I'm gonna be out of a job with no degree and *some* skills.<p>
Going back to school full time would be FUN in my opinion, however It's not just me anymore. Being married is so interesting like that. Don't get me wrong, I wouldn't change a thing in my life, especially being married! It's just that we can both have the same aspirations and goals, with 2 different roads leading to the goal.<p>
I'd rather get this school/degree thing out of the way ASAP and if I do find myself unemployed this would be the perfect time to do it. We are used to a certain standard of living tho, and I'd hate to yank that comfortable carpet out from underneath my wife with one big tug.<p>
In my mind the only way to do both (education/income) would be to land some perfect job (even more perfect than the one I have now) where I could attend school during the day and work making serious bank at night.<p>
I have faith that things will work out for us, it's just no fun waiting for the future sometimes.</p>
