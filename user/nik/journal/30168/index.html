<p>It's been a busy few months.<br/><br/>Most of my Perl work has been concentrated on SVN::Web.  Since I last wrote in here there have been 6 other releases.<br/><br/>As well as the usual round of bug fixes, new features include:<br/><br/>* Better RSS support.<br/><br/>* Localisation selection from the web interface.<br/><br/>* Caching<br/><br/>* A few thousand additional tests, to check that mod_perl and apache/cgi support work.<br/><br/>* mod_perl2 support<br/><br/>* A standalone webserver that can be used for testing, or environments where full blown Apache isn't necessary.<br/><br/>The other thing I plan on doing is taking a deeper look at dtrace on Solaris (and possibly FreeBSD).  This with an eye to building on some earlier that people have done instrumenting Perl with dtrace.  More details on this over at <a href="http://jc.ngo.org.uk/blog">http://jc.ngo.org.uk/blog</a>.</p>

I'm hugely looking forward to your dtrace findings.  It's something I've meant to look into a lot more since I first read about it.  I'm enourmously glad to see the progress it's making in arriving on FreeBSD.

BTW, would you mind enabling comments on your blog?  At the moment, it's asking me to log in...

Comments are now enabled, I think.  I'm somewhat new to WordPress, so it's entirely possible I've missed a button somewhere else that needs to be pressed.  Let me know if it works (presumably, by, uh, submitting a comment<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-) )

Thanks -- the comments are enabled now.  You might want to enable moderation though, in order to avoid comment spam.  Unless you're using wordpress 2.0, which I think comes with the akismet spam plugin (not sure if its enabled by default though).

Moderation is enabled.  I got a bit confused by this last night -- after you've entered a comment it will show it to you, even though the moderation is on.<br/><br/>However, the comment won't show up for anyone else until it's explicitly moderated.

Ah, cunning!  It's been so long since I fiddled with wordpress I didn't realise!

<p>Thanks,<br>
