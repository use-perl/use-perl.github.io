<div class="span8">
<p><p>A few weeks back I did the work to make most of the FreeBSD regression test suite produce output that's compatible with Test::Harness and prove(1).</p>

<p>Back then there wasn't a name for that format.  Now, of course, <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/petdance/journal/22057">there is</a>.</p>

<p>This was very much a rough cut.  A lot of the tests were written in C, consisting of a few hundred (or in some cases a few thousand) ASSERT() calls, with a <tt>printf("PASS\n");</tt> at the bottom -- if your test didn't dump core you knew it worked.</p>

<p>Changing most of those to add <tt>printf("1..1\n");</tt> and <tt>printf("ok 1\n");</tt> was the work of an afternoon.</p>

<p>On the TODO list was to implement as much of TAP as possible in C -- having plans, ok(), and so on.  By doing that, and removing the ASSERT()s, a failing test doesn't prevent all the other tests from running, and you get a truer picture about how many tests overall are being run.  And we all know that seeing the test count go up is a strong incentive to keep writing them.</p>

<p>So, here's a very early draft of that; <a href="http://jc.ngo.org.uk/trac-bin/trac.cgi/browser/nik/libtap/trunk/src/">libtap</a>.  Right now, plan(), ok(), and diag() functionality is there, which is almost all the way to what I need for FreeBSD regression suite.</p></p>

<p>We've done slightly different things.  My code still expects the tests to run by something like Test::Harness' <tt>runtests()</tt>, and produces output that is (supposed to be) 100% compatible with that produced by Test::More under the same circumstances.</p>

<p>My take on this is that we really only need one 'harness' and protocol, and Test::Harness/TAP does a good job of being that.  But there's no reason why the tests themselves have to be written in Perl, which is where <tt>libtap</tt> comes in, making it a little easier to write tests in C.  I think someone's mentioned having an equivalent library for PHP too.</p>

Why have three separate plan functions?
<p>
I would have thought you'd just do a single 'plan' function, which takes an integer as its first arg and then varargs after that.
</p><p>
Define constants like NO_PLAN and SKIP_ALL as negative numbers, a positive number for the first arg corresponds to the current plan_tests, NO_PLAN as the first arg corresponds to plan_no_plan, SKIP_ALL corresponds to plan_skip_all, and you grab the string from the varargs to get the equivalent of the current plan_skip_all's argument.</p>

<p>Rough consensus on #london.pm -- originally the code did much as you suggest (although it looks like I didn't commit that, there's a hangover from it in one of the <a href="http://jc.ngo.org.uk/trac-bin/trac.cgi/file/nik/libtap/trunk/src/t/plan/plan.c?rev=196" title="ngo.org.uk">test files</a ngo.org.uk>).</p>

Interesting.  I like the old way much better, the multiple different plan functions seems like it makes the C version different from the perl version when there's no good reason to do so.
