<p>I knew there was something else I wanted to mention in my previous entry.  I've been doing a little more hacking on SVN::Web recently.<br/><br/>One of the things that's bugged me about SVN::Web is the hoops a user needs to go through if they want to write their own SVN::Web::action class.<br/><br/>As well as writing the class (which is relatively easy), they need to provide templates for the interface, and localisation files for any language strings that they use.<br/><br/>This has been unduly difficult in the past.  Although SVN::Web has supported looking for templates in multiple directories for some time now, localisation files have always had to live in one location.<br/><br/>Worse, you couldn't 'override' a localisation string that ships with SVN::Web with one of your own, without changing the files that ship with SVN::Web.<br/><br/>This makes upgrading more complicated than it needs to be, and means that the instructions for installing any third party actions would be more complicated than is really necessary.<br/><br/>So, over the weekend I finally did the work to make SVN::Web support localisation files in multiple directories.  This means that you can use the localisation files that ship with SVN::Web, and selectively override one or more of the localisation strings by creating your own language.po file in your own directory -- future SVN::Web upgrades won't overwrite it.  And installing third party actions is now simpler, since they can ship with their own localisation files, and now it's just a config.yaml tweak to have them used.<br/><br/>To do this I had to change the i18n infrastructure somewhat.  Previously (I inherited this from clkao) SVN::Web used Locale::Maketext::Simple.  As the name implies, this does make localisation quite simple, but at the cost of some flexibility.  One of the things it couldn't do was support localisations in multiple directories.<br/><br/>So I had to roll my own SVN::Web::I18N, using Locale::Maketext and Locale::Maketext::Lexicon.  The code itself is pretty simple, but I had a few headscratching moments trying to work out how to tie it together, as I found the Locale::Maketext* documentation a little confusing.<br/><br/>These changes were in r1178 (<a href="http://jc.ngo.org.uk/svnweb/jc/revision?rev=1178>), and you can see SVN::Web::I18N too (<URL:http://jc.ngo.org.uk/svnweb/jc/view/nik/CPAN/SVN-Web/trunk/lib/SVN/Web/I18N.pm>).<br">http://jc.ngo.org.uk/svnweb/jc/revision?rev=1178>), and you can see SVN::Web::I18N too (<URL:http://jc.ngo.org.uk/svnweb/jc/view/nik/CPAN/SVN-Web/trunk/lib/SVN/Web/I18N.pm>).<br</a><br/>Now if I can just get SVN::Client support working I can get on and release SVN::Web 0.50.  And with that out of the door I can release a couple of other modules I've had hanging around -- SVN::Web::Timeline (<a href="http://jc.ngo.org.uk/svnweb/jc/browse/nik/CPAN/SVN-Web/branches/timeline">http://jc.ngo.org.uk/svnweb/jc/browse/nik/CPAN/SVN-Web/branches/timeline</a>), which generates a nifty AJAX timeline of commits to the source code, and SVN::Web::Search (<a href="http://jc.ngo.org.uk/svnweb/jc/browse/nik/CPAN/SVN-Web-Search/trunk">http://jc.ngo.org.uk/svnweb/jc/browse/nik/CPAN/SVN-Web-Search/trunk</a>) which indexes Subversion repositories and lets you search over them.</p>
