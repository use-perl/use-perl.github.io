<p><p>I've been busy over the past week producing four new Test::* modules.</p>

<p>These are a bit different from most other Test::* modules, which are normally written to help you test your code.  These, however, are designed to help you test the environment that your code is going to be running in.</p>

<a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/nikc/Test-Symlink/">Test::Symlink</a> lets you easily verify that a symlink exists, and that it links to the correct location.

<pre>
    symlink_ok($src => $dst);
</pre>
    
<p><a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/nikc/Test-Unix-Group/">Test::Unix::Group</a> and <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/nikc/Test-Unix-User/">Test:::Unix::User</a> let you verify that a user, group, and home directory exist.</p>

<pre>
    user_ok({ name => 'nik', uid => 1000}, 'nik has uid 1000');
    
    homedir_ok({ name => 'nik', group => 'staff' },
        "nik's homedir is owned by the staff group");
	
    group_ok({ name => 'wheel', members => [qw(root nik)]},
        "'wheel' has the correct members");
</pre>

<p>Finally, there's <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/nikc/Test-Net-Connect/">Test::Net::Connect</a>, which lets you make sure that you can make a network connection to a particular host.</p>

<pre>
    connect_ok({ host => 'www.example.com', port => 80 },
        "Web server is reachable from here");
</pre></p>

It appears that the CPAN Ratings is having issues, so here goes....<br> <br>Wouldn't it have been slightly better to have made Test::User with Test::User::Unix, Test::User::Win32, etc child classes...sorta like File::Spec?<br> <br>As it stands now, we would have to make a Test::Win32::User, which would turned out slightly dirty namespace wise for all of the possibilities...<br> <br>Just a thought...<br> <br>



<h2>Module naming is always a bit subjective</h2>

<p>Six of one, half a dozen of the other I guess.  Working out which order to put the 2nd and 3rd level namespaces in Perl modules is always a bit subjective.  FWIW, I did get feedback from the perl-qa mailing list which suggested that Test::Unix::User/Group was appropriate.</p>
