<p>202 Km/h 20:15 Int: 21 C Ext: 26 C<br/><br/>That's what you could see on the train.<br/><br/>So I made it back safe and sound.<br/><br/>I kind of liked Lisbon, but I know working there wouldn't be exactly the same as being there for one day... I would probably miss my home and especially my girlfriend... but hey, you gotta take the good with the bad, right? :-) And there's alway trains and stuff, and I do have some friends living there :-)<br/><br/>Anyway, I went to the interview. For what I can tell, they're pretty pleased by the fact that I'm one of the most active Perl'ers in Portugal, but it's like I told them: "Hey, it's Portugal! It's not that hard, really :-)"<br/><br/>They seem to be a good company to work in, so I can only hope for them to make me a decent proposal...<br/><br/>One funny/strange thing about the interview I only realized later: there was no technical part!<br/><br/>:-|<br/><br/>I mean, we talked about the things I've done and the ones I'm doing at the present, but there wasn't even a line of code involved, or any kind of test, so I'm not sure if they know how good or bad I am... not that it bothers me... I feel confident enough :-) Maybe there will be something like that in a near future, or maybe they already know more about me then I thought they did (they told me a coworker of theirs had said good thing about my code... :-| ) So what? Maybe the guy confused things and people! :-D It's possible! :-D<br/><br/>Meanwhile, I haven't heard from Infineon so far... this can mean an awful lot of different things, but the ones I'm more inclined to believe are that either they're not calling me at all of they're simply not hiring at the moment, being a moment a period of a month... I do know they usually have a guy flying in from Germany to do the interviews, and he might be on vacation...<br/><br/>I'm still considering some other companies for which I could send my CV to, if things with Lisbon don't work out.<br/><br/>Oh well, it was fun, going to Lisbon and having a multi-vitamins juice there, with some friends :-)
