<div class="span8">
<p>For two years I've been hearing things like "salaries are low because they are compensated by prizes" and "you have to do this; I know it's extra work, but you'll be paid for it".<br/><br/>Two years...<br/><br/>No prizes...<br/><br/>Every three months the excuse for the prize having not arrived yet would change: waiting for the end of the fiscal year, civil year, for some money from what's-his-name arriving, some project to be completed, etc.<br/><br/>Today (my last day on the job), I had a conversation with the guy who had told me all this... He started by asking me to do a million different things (send him programs I had done, documentation for some stuff, etc.) Afterwards, it went like this:<br/><br/>Me: What about the prizes?<br/><br/>Him: Well, you have to understand that the prizes work part as a recognition and part as an incentive, and given that you're about to leave, that part of the incentive doesn't make sense anymore...<br/><br/>Basically, he says I will receive a prize (again, a delayed prize, because he wants to wait for some other thing), doesn't say how much, but says it'll be lower than what others are going to receive (and yet I've probably been the one who worked harder)... but he still wants me to send him all the stuff I have...<br/><br/>Now... I saw this coming from a looooooooooong way, you know?<br/><br/>Let's just say... I prepared myself O:-)
