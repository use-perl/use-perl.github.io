Actually, they seem to be very well organized.<br> <br>Plus, they work with Perl and other open-source stuff, and it's the kind of company that values guys like me (last week, when I told some people in Brazil I was organizing YAPC::EU::2005, I was asked if I had nothing better to do with my time...)<br> <br>Also, I would have a laptop of the company (currently, I'm using mine to work), a celular phone, I would get to work from home one day each week, etc, etc, etc... it seems real nice...<br> <br>And it's Perl related!!<br> <br>Anyway, for all they've told me and what I've heard of them, it seems to be the kind of place I'd like to work in...<br> <br>And there would be other Perl hackers working with me!!
