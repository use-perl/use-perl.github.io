<p>As some of you might know, I went to an interview, yesterday, in Lisbon...<br/><br/>I really don't know what to think of it yet...<br/><br/>It started with me filling some pages with crosses, marking technologies I already knew with "Weak", "Medium" and "High" level and for how many years I had known them and... The first section was on "Programming languages"... There was no Perl... OK... I can live with that, they simply don't use Perl... There was C, Prolog, Java, Ada, Cobol, and lots of others, but no Perl... But the surprise was still to come...<br/><br/>When I got to the section on "Web" (or something like that), I immediatly recognized lots of things... HTML, Javascript, XML, XSL, Perl... wait a minute, Perl???? WTF? This should be on the Programming languages section!!!<br/><br/>Bah... whatever...<br/><br/>I didn't mention it anyway because I was only talking to a person from HR (if I get to the second phase of the process, I'll contact with technical people, I guess).<br/><br/>She told me about the company and a bit about the project: it's in Lisbon, which is good, it's probably on Windows, which is bad, it's in a bank, which is interesting, it's probably not very good for me financially, which is inadmissible :-)<br/><br/>We talked a bit about values, I mentioned a minimum value and she said "I'm not sure if, for this particular project, such an high value will be possible; would you consider a lower offer, or is it out of the question?" I said "It would depend on the rest of the circumstances", but I guess I should have said "No", because that value really isn't high, not for me, not for anyone working in Lisbon, and everybody I told the value so far keeps telling me the same thing so, you see, it's not me...<br/><br/>Anyway, she's supposed to take my CV to someone who'll decide whether he (or she, I don't know) wants to interview me or not, and then I might get another call asking me to go to Lisbon again...<br/><br/>I'm thinking, if I get that call, should I take another day off to go there or not? Hmm... If I knew in advance that they were willing to pay me a reasonable salary, I guess I would, but all I know right now is that they, apparently, are not...<br/><br/>I think I should call them Monday morning and tell them not to bother calling me for another interview if they really don't plan paying something similar to what I asked... I'd like to get a new job, but I'm not so desperate to the point of getting myself in an even worse financial situation than the one I have today...</p>
