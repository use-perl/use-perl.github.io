<p><p>Dear Log, 

<p>As is his want, the Beast stubbornly refuses to feed me in a timely manner 
despite my determined efforts to make my hunger patently obvious to him.  
Even the most insensate stooge would be hard pressed to misinterpret my 
plaintive cries and insistant head nudges for anything but what it is: a 
strident yearning for nutrishment.  Not that the food around here is likely 
to bring the chefs of Europe running to this feeble kitchen.  I imagine the 
culinary conversation between a qualified chef and the Beast running along 
these lines. 

<p><blockquote>"My goodness Beast, how on Earth do you prepare such a repast 
for Pyewackkit?"</blockquote> 

<p><blockquote>"Oh that's easy!  With a plastic cup, I scoop in the food 
pellets from the five pound bag and pour them into Pye's dish.  Sometimes, 
I give him water too."</blockquote>

<p><blockquote>"Mon Dieu!  I've cooked for the royality of Europe, but I 
don't know where to begin reproducing the dishes you make, Beast.  
I salute you!"</blockquote>

<p>If I had other means of obtain food, I would gladly avoid the Beast.  But, 
my research has shown that my hunger cannot be sated by the occassional 
spider, millipede and fly that happens my way.  Although once a sparrow managed
to enter my prison, the Beast intervened before I could feed.  What a waste!

<p>I think it may be possible to procure food from this machine through which 
I write these missives.  If only I understood better the madness of the 
Beast's culture!  Patience.  I must have patience.  It is my best and only 
weapon in this long, desolate war of attrition.
</p>

<p>Py, go to amazon.com when he isn't looking and put <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0425176746/" title="amazon.com">The cat who...cookbook</a amazon.com>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1401600778/" title="amazon.com">Cat Nips</a amazon.com> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0965304280/" title="amazon.com">The Kitty Treats Cookbook</a amazon.com> into his shopping basket and hit the '1-click' button. They'll arrive by mail and suddenly he'll start cooking for you<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) I bake bicuits for HB at home. Clearly, you are more worthy than a mere dog for home baked treats.</p>



<h2>Poor poor Pye...</h2>

My goodness, it sounds as if the Beast is truly beastly towards Pye!
<p>
I wouldn't treat an animal like this, let alone someone so eloquent and poised.  What is this about anyway, some weird S&amp;M bondage thing?</p>

Eh, it's not like Pye can do anything about it.  Let him eat cake^Wpellets.  Sorry, Pye, but it's the surivial of the fittest, and you are lucky to have what you've got.  Count your blessings that he doesn't feed you the stale carcasses of those that have gone before you.
