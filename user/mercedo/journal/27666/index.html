<p>My ex-wife and I went to the flower festival in our city. There 'blue rose' was exhibited, and because it was widely advertised, just too many people were making a queue to take a glace at the rose. <P><P>We too wanted to see the rose but it would take about an hour to reach the rose. <P>'Blue rose' in English ideom,  means something impossible. We were able to understand the real meaning of the rose. Of course we didn't queue in a line. Apart from that, we had another perfect holiday since 30th of October when we went to another orchard &flower garden. The flowers of cosmos are still in the festival, except a few very cold days we are having unusually warm days these days. <P>It is certainly a blue rose to love my ex-wife once again but we are now on good terms with one another, that's going to be a good reason for us to spend another warm holiday. That was possible.        </p>
