<h1>Parrot Plumage Day 5: Configure.nqp and a 'proper' Makefile</h1>

Shortly after
<a href="http://use.perl.org/user/geoffrey/journal/39622">Day 4</a>
day job deadlines loomed, and I expected Day 5 to be delayed at least a week.  Thanks to some late nights this morning's status meeting at the day job went well, so Tene++'s ping on
<code>#parrot</code> caught me with a few spare tuits and the strong desire to take a break from the tasks of the last few days.
</p>

<p>
Tene had pasted a patch to the <code>Makefile</code> for Plumage, essentially suggesting that it be a bit less hard-coded and instead use the <code>parrot_config</code> binary to fill in some of the variables.  Unfortunately, his patch used backticks (<code>`...`</code>) to capture the output of <code>parrot_config</code>, which is not portable across <code>make</code> implementations.  In fact, it appears that every <code>make</code> does this differently -- GNU Make uses the <code>$(shell ...)</code> construction, BSD Make uses the special <code>!=</code> assignment operator, and so on.
</p>

<p>
Asking around, it soon became clear that this morass of incompatible syntax for capturing shell output is one of the reasons everybody just uses a Configure script of some sort.  In fact, a simple Configure script does nothing more than replace markers in a makefile template (typically called <code>Makefile.in</code>) with the proper text, and write out the completed <code>Makefile</code> to be fed to <code>make</code>.
</p>

<p>
That sounded like exactly the kind of simple substitution that I needed for the Plumage <code>Makefile</code>, but I couldn't just use one of the zillion existing <code>Configure</code> scripts, because it needs to be written in NQP for much the same reasons that Plumage itself does.
</p>

<p>
Well, I clearly couldn't leave <em>that</em> situation lie, so a couple hours later, <code>Configure.nqp</code> was born.  After implementing <code>slurp()</code> and <code>spew()</code> functions in the <code>Glue.pir</code> "builtins" library, reading the template and writing the output again were trivial, but the interesting task turned out to be implementing <code>subst()</code> to do the text substitutions.
</p>

<p>
Parrot has for quite some time now shipped with PGE, the Parrot Grammar Engine.  Among other things, PGE has built-in support for the Perl 5 and Perl 6 grammar/regex languages.  With some gracious help from pmichaud++ and a good bit of spelunking in the Rakudo <code>src/builtins/</code> directory, I pieced together the necessary bits to instantiate the Perl 6 variant, use it to compile the regex argument to <code>subst()</code>, and iterate over the matches performing the substitutions.
</p>

<p>
At first I implemented purely static string replacement; the same new string would be used to replace every match point in the original.  This method would however be horribly slow for the task at hand -- I'd have to run the substitution across the entire makefile text for each of the hundreds of config values that <code>parrot_config</code> knows about.
</p>

<p>
Taking a hint again from the Rakudo implementation of <code>subst()</code>, I also made it possible to supply a sub instead of a plain string as the replacement argument.  This sub gets called with each match object in turn, and returns the appropriate string to use for the replacement.  This makes the relevant code from <code>Configure.nqp</code> remarkably clean:
</p>

<pre>
my $replaced := subst($unconfigured, '\@<ident>\@', replacement);

sub replacement ($match) {
    my $key    := $match<ident>;
    my $config := %VM<config>{$key} || '';

    return $config;
}
</pre>

<p>
(Yes, <code>replacement()</code> could easily be written as a one-liner.  It seemed a bit clearer this way.)
</p>

<p>
The plain string form of <code>subst()</code> still gets used, to fix the slash orientation for Windows systems:
</p>

<pre>
if ($OS eq 'MSWin32') {
    $replaced := subst($replaced, '/', '\\');
}
</pre>

<p>
A few miscellaneous cleanups and an update to <code>README</code> later, and the <code>Makefile</code> cleanup task (which I expected to remain near the bottom of the task list for a fair bit, nibbling at the edge of my conciousness) is Just Done.  That's a good feeling.
</p>

<p>
As always, you can check out the code at the
<a href="http://gitorious.org/parrot-plumage/parrot-plumage">Parrot Plumage repository</a>, and don't hesitate to ping me on IRC -- I'm <code>japhb</code> on <code>#parrot</code> at <code>irc.parrot.org</code>.
