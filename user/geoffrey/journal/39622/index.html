<a href="http://use.perl.org/user/geoffrey/journal/39516">Day 1</a>
and
<a href="http://use.perl.org/user/geoffrey/journal/39598">Day 2/3</a>
got me (mostly) prepared to begin the actual coding for the
<a href="http://gitorious.org/parrot-plumage/parrot-plumage">Parrot Plumage</a>
prototype.  There were just two things left to figure out: how to access command-line arguments, and how to initialize complex data structures.
</p>

<p>
The first problem turned out to be relatively simple to solve with a couple more additions to the glue library to initialize
<code>@ARGS</code> and <code>$PROGRAM_NAME</code>
from the <code>IGLOBALS_ARGV_LIST</code>
field of the Parrot interpreter globals.
</p>

<p>
The second problem (initializing complex data structures) required a couple silly hacks, but I got a decent workaround in the end.  Allow me to explain ....
</p>

<p>
NQP natively can index into hashes, arrays, and complex arrangements of same with relative ease.  Want to access an entry in a hash of arrays of hashes, with some fixed keys and some varying keys?  No problem.  Something like this will do:
</p>

<pre>
$age := %pets{$type}[$num]<age>;
</pre>

<p>
The problem is, there's no short and simple way to
<em>initialize</em> the <code>%pets</code> hash.  NQP doesn't have syntax for hash or array literals, which makes it rather painful to instantiate complex structures.  Oh, I suppose you could write a whole bunch of these:
</p>

<pre>
%pets<feline>[0]<age> := 5;
%pets<feline>[1]<age> := 6;
%pets<canine>[0]<age> := 4;
...
</pre>

<p>
but as you can imagine that gets old rather quickly -- and doing the initialization in raw PIR would be even more painful.  Luckily, during my previous hack day I'd brought the JSON parser up to current standards, so I used it for a little trick.  I defined the data structure I wanted as a JSON string, parsed it into a real data structure using the
<code>data_json</code> language that now ships with Parrot, and then ran a fixup routine on the few bits that didn't translate easily.
</p>

<p>
That last bit might require a little explanation.  I could only create data structures this way containing data types the JSON language knows how to represent: numbers, strings, arrays, hashes, booleans, etc.  However, there's no way to represent a code reference, and one of the applications I had in mind was a function table for mapping user commands, such as
<code>version</code> and <code>install</code> to the subroutines that would implement them.
</p>

<p>
My solution was to replace the code references with the <em>names</em> of the subroutines I wanted in the JSON text, and then after parsing the JSON run a peculiar bit of inline PIR to replace the names with the real code references.  The fixup function in question looks like this:
</p>

<pre>
sub fixup_commands ($commands) {
    Q:PIR{
        $P0 = find_lex '$commands'
        $P1 = iter $P0
      fixup_loop:
        unless $P1 goto fixup_loop_end
        $S0 = shift $P1
        $P2 = $P1[$S0]
        $S1 = $P2['action']
        $P3 = get_hll_global $S1
        $P2['action'] = $P3
        goto fixup_loop
      fixup_loop_end:
    };

    return $commands;
}
</pre>

<p>
The short explanation is that the loop in the above PIR block iterates over each entry in the <code>$commands</code> hash, and for each <code>action</code> key replaces the matching string value (the subroutine name) with the subroutine itself, looked up using the <code>get_hll_global</code> op.  And it works!
</p>

<p>
These problems out of the way, I could finally start writing a prototype of the <code>plumage</code> command line tool.  Time eventually ran out on my hacking day, but I managed to implement basic versions of
<code>usage</code>, <code>version</code>, and
<code>info</code> commands, and a command parser and dispatcher that could be charitably described as "beyond minimalist".
</p>

<p>
While the first two commands just provide info about <code>plumage</code> itself, the last one is the first command that actually provides real functionality.  In particular, <code>info</code> simply loads the metadata for a given project and prints the details for the user.
</p>

<p>
In order to have some metadata to display with my brand new <code>info</code> command, I took a shot at filling in the fields from the
<a href="https://trac.parrot.org/parrot/wiki/ModuleEcosystem#MetadataProposal">Metadata Proposal</a> manually for a single project.  In this case, I chose
<a href="http://github.com/jnthn/blizkost">Blizkost</a> because it's useful, cool, and non-trivial without being insane.
</p>

<p>
Unsurprisingly, I came across a couple underspecified bits in the metadata proposal, but things mostly seemed to make sense.
<a href="http://gitorious.org/parrot-plumage/parrot-plumage/blobs/master/metadata/blizkost.json">The result</a> is a tad wordy, but it is after all intended to be generated mostly automatically.
</p>

<p>
That done, I found myself out of time for this hack day, but things are looking up for implementing an ultra-simple version of the <code>install</code> command next time.  Until then, I invite you to
<a href="http://gitorious.org/parrot-plumage/parrot-plumage">browse the repository</a>
or just come by #parrot on irc.parrot.org and ping me (<code>japhb</code>). See you there!
