It's been over a month since
<a href="http://use.perl.org/user/geoffrey/journal/39713">my last entry</a>.  Life pretty much had me swamped for the last five weeks, but nevertheless I did get some Plumage work done.
</p>

<p>
It would be a daunting task to try to go back and remember all the details of the last five weeks, so I've decided to take
<a href="http://use.perl.org/user/pmichaud/journal/39834">a hint from pmichaud</a> and just include my <code>#parrotsketch</code> reports (edited a bit here):
</p>

<pre>
DONE IN PLUMAGE:
* Handle fetching over old working dir, including when changing repo types (as partcl did)
* Add rx() function for compiling regex strings, until nqp-rx is ready for use
* Likewise all_matches()
* Various small cleanups
* Fix gitoriousparser plugin for dalek-plugins
MAD PROPZ:
* darbelo++                 # help with cleanups
* dukeleto++                # plumage source tree reorg
* dukeleto++ and Tene++     # plumage test harness and test suite
* dukeleto++ and Infinoid++ # gitoriousparser work enabling a parrot-plumage dalek feed
EOR


DONE IN PLUMAGE:
* Dependency handling, including remembering installed projects (not the final paradise, but Good Enough For Now)
* Automatically sudo if parrot_bin directory not writable by user
* New 'projects' (list known projects) and 'showdeps' (show resolution for all dependencies) commands
* Plumage metadata dir can now be overridden by conf file (for testing support)
* Several new functions in Glue.pir and Util.nqp
* Lots more docs for Glue.pir and Util.nqp
* More tasks broken out of my head into TASKS
MAD PROPZ:
* dukeleto++ # Testing, testing, testing; factor out Util.nqp from main program
* darbelo++  # Matrixy metadata (and making it buildable against installed Parrot)
EOR


DONE:
* Improve validation of metadata
* Refactoring and function documentation
* Much improved Makefile (with automatic Makefile rebuilding)
WIP:
* import_proto.p6 (Import proto-managed projects into Plumage metadata)
* Analyzing discussion surrounding major CPAN META spec upgrade (which is in design phase)
MAD PROPZ:
* darbelo++ # Plumage's NQP configure brought to other projects
* Austin++  # Makefile education
BLOCKERS:
* import_proto.p6 blocking on proto's installed-modules branch
EOR


DONE:
* Talked at length with Plobsing++ re: current NCI problems
* Brain dumped to https://trac.parrot.org/parrot/wiki/NCITasklist
WIP:
* Converting Plumage to make use of new NQP-rx features
* Pushing the envelope of what NQP-rx has
* Exchanging feature requests with pmichaud++ via http://wiki.github.com/perl6/nqp-rx/plumage-requests
* Moving Glue.pir functionality to Util.nqp where possible
* Further expanding Util.nqp to cover more common functionality
* Cleaning up and expanding Plumage's test suite
NEXT UP:
* More of everything in WIP section
BLOCKERS:
* Several local Plumage branches blocked waiting for various NQP-rx features
EOR
</pre>

<p>
So there you have it -- a month of Plumage work, in shorthand.  I also finally got around to setting up Perl-specific microblogging accounts on
<a href="https://twitter.com/japhb">Twitter</a> and
<a href="http://identi.ca/japhb">identi.ca</a>;
I'm <code>japhb</code> on both of them just as I am in <code>#parrot</code> on <code>irc.parrot.org</code>.  As always, don't hesitate to drop by and ping me.  If you'd like to join the Plumage effort, check out the code in the
<a href="http://gitorious.org/parrot-plumage/parrot-plumage">Parrot Plumage repository</a>; read the <code>README</code> for the general overview, then come to <code>#parrot</code> to get your questions answered!
