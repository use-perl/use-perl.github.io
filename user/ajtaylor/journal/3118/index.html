<p>This weekend I was looking through Speakeasy's site and noticed that the difference between the 608/128 package I have now, and the 1.5/128 is only $10/mo! Why I hadn't had this all along I don't know. So I called, waited on hold for &lt; 5 min (much better speakeasy!) & the friendly, clueful tech put in the order to upgrade my line. After a little waiting, I tried the ever popular  and ubiquitous speedtest java applet at bos.speakeasy.net. To my surprise, not only did they increase my DL speed (as I wanted), they upped my UL speed too! 
<p>
Now, being the paranoid and cheap person that I am, I wanted to make sure I wasn't getting charged too much. So I logged into the TAC to see what they had me listed under. With a impish giggle, I saw:<br>
1.5/128 RADSL LineShare
<p>
Hehehe! More speed! Am I bad to graciously take the extra 260kbs difference and not tell them? After all, it's not my mistake. Why shouldn't I use it while I can? It's kind of like my former dotcom employer continuing my COBRA coverage for 3 months after I told them to stop it... 
<p>
Gotta take advantage of it while you can. Now it's time to download some ISO's or something. :-)</p>
