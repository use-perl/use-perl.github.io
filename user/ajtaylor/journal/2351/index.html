<p>OK, this isn't directly perl related, but I do mention mod_perl towards the end...
<p>
I have an old PowerEdge 2200 server and wanted to add more RAM as it currently only has 64MB. But it uses 168 pin buffered ECC EDO DIMMS, which are more expensive than SDRAM. Crucial has at times wanted as much as $90 for 128MB, which I wasn't prepared to pay.
<p>
Enter Pricewatch. For those who don't know, pricewatch is your friend. :-) A quick search for my RAM type turned up Memory4Less.com (which does more than memory - go figure). They only wanted $47 for 128MB, so they got it.
<p>
Once it's in, perhaps I can run multiple instances of mod_perl, along w/ Mysql, & PostgreSQL without swapping. It kind of sucks when you run into swap even when the bare minimum httpd processes (1 parent, 1 start, & 1 spare) are running. I tried having 0 spares, but apache complained & said it was setting it to 1 because surely that's what I meant. No it wasn't...
<p>
One last thing. I setup <a href="http://bricolage.thepirtgroup.com/">Bricolage</a> as mentioned on the front page and it's pretty cool. From my cursory glance it's quite comprehensive. And when I wanted to run it on a high port and/or virtual host, the developers saw the utility of my request & the feature is now in CVS. Isn't open source great!</p>

<h2>Buffered EDO</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ct/">ct</a> on 2002-01-23T18:52:37</h3>
Ahh yes, the mystical Buffered EDO, which was the bane of my existance. When I first built my dual PPro 200 the 64meg stick that went in cost me $175 in 1999. I always wanted to upgrade it but couldn't ever find it.
<br>
<br>About six months ago I checked EBay and found a guy selling 256meg Buffered EDO kits (Two 128's) in a dutch auction for $99. One paypal later and my Dual PPro has 320Megs.
<br>
<br>Of course I now don't have a clue what to do with the box, it's now running OpenBSD, which, of course, means it's a single processor machine.

I have never had any problems finding the right memory. It's been finding it at a reasonable price that has eluded me in the past. All I can say it, I really love pricewatch. I hope they're making a profit.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)
<p>
On a related note, I'm old enough to remember paying $40/MB for memory to go in my 486-33SX. It was as lot of money, but the difference between 4 &amp; 8MB was well worth it.</p>
