<div class="span8">
<p><p>I've started getting HTML spam where the images are embedded as separate MIME attachments within the message. The image links look like <img src="cid:message_part_id">. I have the option in my mail software (Thunderbird) to not load images in HTML mail, but this method allows them through anyway. It really got my attention today when a spam for a German porn site came up w/ an image of a nude woman. The bad part is that I was in my office at work! No harm done but it could have been embarrasing to say the least...</p>

<p>Anyone know of workarounds for not displaying these sort of messages/images? Should I just turn off HTML mail all together? I just want to avoid throwing out the baby w/ the bath water. And I'd like to note that I send email in text format, not HTML. :-)</p></p>

<h2>Filtering out HTML</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/dws/">dws</a> on 2003-08-08T20:09:41</h3>
I discard all email that's HTML only, and have never (to my knowledge, and I check the discard pile once a week) had a false positive. YMMV.

Do you have friends you send you mail from Hotmail or MSN accounts?  They changed a while back to make it impossible (or possibly only much harder) to avoid sending HTML only.  I think SpamAssassin's default rules even got modified to avoid the HTML-only penalty for messages from there.<br> <br>Although now that I think of it, I haven't noticed any of those messages in a couple of months.  Maybe they changed back.<br>

I don't know which MUA it was, but I did see one once that asked for every HTML message if the user really wanted to see it.<br> <br>Perhaps you can make your client do this.
