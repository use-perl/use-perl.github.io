<p>Woohoo! I finally got a real job. Looks like I'll start on Monday. I was laid off Sep 6, so yesterday was my 6 month mark. Holy cow, has it really been that long? wow...
<p>
Boy, it's amazing how that time has just flown by. I watched Sep 11 live (luckily not in person). I had Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Years all without a full-time job. Thank goodness I have some freelance work that has been helping me stay afloat. I really couldn't have survived with out it.
<p>
And for those who care and have read this far, thanks for your kind words & thoughts. I can truly understand how others in my situation feel. Until you've walked a few miles in their shoes, you don't really know what it's like.
<p>
While this is not my dream job, it will be a good one for me. The pay is not as good as I had hoped, but I'll get a nice raise after 3 months. And I'll be 2nd in command of the technology side of things. Lots of chances to prove and stretch myself. I've found that's important if you want to, to quote a famous slogan, "Be all that you can be.". :-)
<p>
I wish all those still looking for work the best of luck. And I hope it won't take 6 months for you to get off the unemployment dole.</p>
