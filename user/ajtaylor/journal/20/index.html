<p><b>Looking for a job</b>
<p>
This is my first weblog, so who knows where it will end up. Maybe it will just ramble on and not say anything. That does seem to happen to me occasionally...
<p>
Almost three weeks ago the startup I worked for laid me and several others off very unexpectedly. It really sucked, because there was <b>no</b> warning. We were told we "had enough to make it through the end of the year". I'm guessing now that they meant they had enough after letting some folks go. And this week, a few more people were let go as well.
<p>
I knew it could happen, this was a startup after all, but I never expected it to happen to me. I was in engineering after all, part of the <i>important</i> people. Well, that's the chance you take working for a startup. :-)
<p>
I'm doing some freelance work right now, which along with my severance will hopefully get me though June. If you have a perl developer position open, or know someone who does, please let me know. My resume and experience is at <a href="http://www.drewtaylor.com/">drewtaylor.com</a>.
<p>
I think I've rambled enough for now. Perhaps I'll be back. Hopefully I'll get at least an interview soon... </p>
