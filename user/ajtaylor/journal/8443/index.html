<p>I like the look of these new tabs (they actually look like tabs!), but it doesn't quite feel right. I'm sure pudge is still working on the final layout, so here's my thoughts:
<p>
<ol>
<li>My chief complaint is that when I'm in someone's journal it's not obvious whose it is. How about "user's journal (Friend of a Friend) in the blue bar? I really don't want to have to look at the tab or window title to figure out which journal I'm reading.
<li>The "Logout...username" tabs should consistently stay on one side or the other. But I definitely like having them.
<li>The journal links "user's journal...Friend's journals" should be above the dark blue line, not below. It's too easy to lose track of it in the current position. Perhaps a 2nd line below the links for "FAQ...Logout". Speaking of which, don't the new tabs make some of said links redundant now?
</ol>
<p>
OK, I think that's all my gripes for now. But I still like being a guinea pig! :-)</p>

<h2>Friend of a Friend</h2>

I don't quite understand replacing the person's name with "Friend of a Friend" either, but it seems to be buggy.  I get "Friend of a Friend" even when the person is also a direct Friend, which I'd think should take precedence.

<p>Loud agreement.  I'm used to looking to that spot for the user's name.  Their relation to me is less important, and if the person is a friend and/or fan, the fact that they are the "friend of a friend" is less important still.  Besides, I already have the icons.</p>

<p>I think I've also mentioned I think the friend-of-friend, foe-of-friend, etc. icons seem to just create clutter when a person is a friend or foe.  If I already know my opinion of the person, other people's opinions are less relevant.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, thanks for the great website(s), pudge!</p>

Actually I'd gotten less used to looking at that spot for the user's name in recent weeks because (as sometimes happens during use.perl tweaks) that text had become invisible (white on white) in the light view.  I hadn't bothered complaining this time, since it seemed to be in transition.<br> <br>And yes, thanks, pudge!

There was a new update today; more is still to come (my biggest problem with it is the "Friend of Friend" text, too, which is still there, though most of the other known problems have been fixed).
