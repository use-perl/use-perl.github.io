<p>First, I have to say just how much I love reading journals here on use.perl. For some reason I find it facinating to watch other's lives from a distance. And even better, I've learned a whole lot from people much better/experienced than myself. Conferences are also very cool for learning as well. I had an excellent first time experience at YAPC this year and plan to keep attending in the future. Hearing that YAPC was actually more technically advanced helped dull the pain at not being able to go to TPC one more year.
<p>
For instance, gav mentioned the Burner idea in a journal, which he stole from Bricolage. I had started to do something similar here at work, but had not considered creating a seperate object for it. So I finished hacking and polishing it yesterday and I'm very happy with the results. I still have my TT support, and my boss has HTML::Template support. And since he's the boss and I'm the employee, his choice wins the coin toss. But I don't (yet) have to convert any of my old programs that are using TT since I still have that support.
<p>
And due to my forward thinking, it was very easy to retrofit the existing code I had done to use the new Burner object. MVC to the rescue! Perl made it all very easy and provided me with the multiple excellent templating systems I can use. So here's to perl (and the community members)!</p>
