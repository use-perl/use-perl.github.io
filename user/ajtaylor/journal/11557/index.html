<div class="span8">
<p>I'm trying to figure out how much it would cost me to go to OSCon. I don't need to stay at the Marriott for $129/night, so I'm wondering what are some good alternatives. Important considerations: transportation to conference (may or may not rent a car), cost, food, and amenities. I don't need anything fancy, just a decent place to sleep.
<p>
Also, I would be going alone so I'd also be interested in a roommate. I noticed on the OSCon page there is a roommate list, so perhaps I'll subscribe to that as well. Any one going that wants to bunk w/ a boring non-smoker/drinker like me? (I'm really not boring, I just abstain from a lot of things. :-)
<p>
Also, I know I'm going to be hitting Powell's Books. What other attractions are "Must See" in Portland? How much spending money will I need? I'm planning on $50-100 for the bookstores (my wife will kill me)...</p>

<h2>Powell's and Powell's Technical</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/merlyn/">merlyn</a> on 2003-04-09T21:58:47</h3>
Be aware that Powell's City of Books (the mothership) is about 4 blocks from Powell's Technical Books.  Don't go into one confusing it with the other. {grin}
<p>
And only $50?  <i>Maybe</i> you'll make it out for only that much. {grin}</p>

Well, in my defense I mentioned a range for my book budget.
<p>
So you're telling me I'm going to have to stay away from <b>2</b> great bookstores? Why did you have to go and tell me that? Did I say only $50? I meant to say $150. My wife is <b>REALLY</b> gonna kill me. If the extra weight from the books doesn't do me in first.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>

<h2>Transportation</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/chromatic/">chromatic</a> on 2003-04-09T22:18:48</h3>
<p>
You can get away without a car pretty easily.  The <a href="http://www.tri-met.org/index.shtml" title="tri-met.org">MAX</a tri-met.org> runs from the airport right by the hotel and all the way out to blissful suburbia in the west and less-blissful suburbia in the east.  There's a stop just a few blocks from Powell's and Powell's Technical, and they're in the free downtown zone.  (To and from the airport isn't free, but $1.55 or so each way is cheaper than a taxi or a rental car.)
</p>
<p>
This town's <em>nice</em> to pedestrians.

A few corrections.
<p>
MAX's closest approach to the conference hotel is about six blocks (and I don't call that "right by").  If you're rolling your roll-a-board, it's probably OK, but if you have checked luggage without wheels, it might be a bit of a drag.  (Note to chromatic: were you confusing the Marriot Marquis on Broadway with the waterfront "downtown" Marriott?  The conference hotel is the latter, and less centrally located, unfortunately.)
</p><p>
MAX doesn't go close to either of the Powell's.  However, once you've found the bus mall (about 4 blocks from the conference hotel, and in a perpendicular direction to the MAX line), many frequent busses go north/south in the mall toward the Powell's Tech store, and yes, the busses are free in that area.
You're still about 5 blocks from the nearest free bus to Powell's City of Books, and 2 blocks to Powell's Technical, but that's closer than walking the 18 blocks from the conference hotel.</p>

<p>Yeah, I had confused the two hotels.</p>

<p>I do count Powell's as fairly close to MAX, though.  It's a five-minute walk from the station at 9th -- that's my preferred stop!</p>

<h2>Things to see in Portland</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/dws/">dws</a> on 2003-04-09T23:31:26</h3>
The 24-hour Church of Elvis used to be a short walk from Powell's technical bookstore. I believe that it's moved somewhere nearby.

It's moved into boxes.  Stephanie probably ran out of money.

<h2>Check out my journal</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/autarch/">autarch</a> on 2003-04-10T03:38:25</h3>
I mentioned in <a href="/user/autarch/journal" title="perl.org">my journal</a perl.org> a week or two back that I had negotiated a group hotel rate at a nearby hotel within 1 mile of the Marriot.  It's $79/night for a room, there's free wireless, and it's near Powell's.  I haven't sent them back the final paperwork I need to send, but I will do so soon and post an update in my journal.

Ah ha! I thought I had read a journal entry that mentioned this. I'll take a look.

Great info. Thanks! I like the wireless access, but I'd have to swipe my wife's windows laptop for a few days &amp; buy her a wifi card. Oh wait, I wanted to get one anyway.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-) Now I have a couple more months to make her see the light of OS X so she can have access to a computer while I'm away...</p>

The hotel does rent out wireless cards, apparently.  But they're damn cheap, so buying one might be worth it.<br> <br>Anyway, $79/night is a really good deal for a downtown Portland hotel, whether or not you use the free wireless.
