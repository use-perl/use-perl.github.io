<p>Here's my favorite quote of the day. It's from a NY Times article about number portability for cell phones. (<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/03/18/technology/ebusiness/18NECO.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2002/03/18/technology/ebusiness/18NECO.html</a>)

<blockquote><i>
Asked whether the customers' perspective had become lost in this debate, Ms. Hoskins of Verizon said, "Carriers are in the best position of figuring out what consumers want."
</i></blockquote>

Need I say more? Is it any wonder why competition benefits consumers so much with the incumbent carriers thinking they know everything?

The paragraphs immediately following are just as good:
<blockquote><i>
Yet one Verizon customer who filed a comment with the F.C.C. said he was reluctant to switch providers because of the cost and trouble involved Ã¢â¬â even though another carrier offered a feature he would like that was not available through Verizon.
<p>
"Being a Verizon customer," he wrote, "I find it hypocritical that they fought so hard to prove they were competitive when it came to their being allowed to enter the long-distance telephone market and now they are fighting just as hard to reduce the competitiveness of the wireless industry." 
</i></blockquote></p>
