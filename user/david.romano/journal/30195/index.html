<p><p>
While trying to build <a href="http://www.pugscode.org/">pugs</a> with readline support, I've had to battle a neutered readline library, a readline that doesn't come with certain functions which pugs (and <a href="http://www.haskell.org/ghc">ghc</a>) expect. I had previously installed readline 5.1 in /usr/local, but apparently ghc still linked to the libreadline in /usr, even after my having set <a href="http://www.justatheory.com/computers/databases/postgresql/howto_avoid_tigers_readline.html">$LDFLAGS to -L/usr/local/include</a>. Therefore, I decided to do something a little more drastic: overwrite the libreadline.dylib in /usr/lib.
</p>

<p>
Now I've heard over and over again that you don't want to mess with /usr and that you should always use /usr/local. However, it didn't seem like other workarounds were working. So I decided to cream my /usr/lib version of libreadline and install the same version and minor version of of readline from GNU (after making a backup of my original libreadline.dylib and include/readline.h, of course). Fortunately, it wasn't too hard. I did <code>curl -f http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/readline/readline-5.0.tar.gz | tar xvz, cd readline-5.0; make; sudo make install</code>. However, there was one small hitch. The make process gave this error message:
<pre>gcc version 4.0.0 20041026 (Apple Computer, Inc. build 4061)
powerpc-apple-darwin8-gcc-4.0.0: -compatibility_version only allowed with -dynamiclib
</pre>
The reason for the error is that GNU readline's default flags for building shared libraries is wrong for my version of OS X. Fortunately, some quick google'ing turned up <a href="http://www.hmug.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?p=105&">this</a>, telling me that I had to edit shlib/Makefile to have SHOBJ_LDFLAGS=-dynamiclib. After that was changed, <code>make</code>ing was successful.
</p>

<p>
But I decided to dig around more as the the reason <strong>why</strong> GNU readline was passing the wrong flag. It was easier than expected. I looked at <code>configure</code> and noticed that it called ${srcdir}/support/shobj-conf to configure the shared libraries. Searching for <code>-dynamic</code> brought me to this chunk of script:
<pre>
    case "${host_os}" in
    darwin7*)    SHOBJ_LDFLAGS=''
            SHLIB_XLDFLAGS='-dynamiclib -arch_only `/usr/bin/arch` -install_name $(libdir)/$@ -current_version $(SHLIB_MAJOR)$(SHLIB_MINOR) -compatibility_version $(SHLIB_MAJOR) -v'
            ;;
    *)      SHOBJ_LDFLAGS='-dynamic' 
            SHLIB_XLDFLAGS='-arch_only `/usr/bin/arch` -install_name $(libdir)/$@ -current_version $(SHLIB_MAJOR)$(SHLIB_MINOR) -compatibility_version $(SHLIB_MAJOR) -v'
            ;;
    esac
</pre>
The lone <code>darwin7</code> looked suspicious to me, so I checked out the same file for readline-5.1 and noticed <code>darwin7</code> had changed to <code>darwin[78]</code>. Also, the error message above said it was building for <code>darwin8</code>, so it seemed reasonable to suspect this was the crucial change. After I made that change and did <code>make clean; ./configure; make</code>, libreadline-5.0 compiled properly.  Now ghc and pugs both compile with readline support, and I haven't had any problems (readline related) otherwise. Woo-hoo! :-)
