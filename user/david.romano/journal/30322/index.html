<h1>Installing 5.004_05 on OS X</h1>

<div class="span8">
<p><p>
So I've been (slowly) helping out with <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/mivkovic/Mail-Sendmail-0.79/">Mail::Sendmail</a> as part of the <a href="http://qa.perl.org/phalanx/">Phalanx Project</a>, and the author really wants the module to stay compatible with 5.004. Needless to say, OS X doesn't ship with 5.004, nor have I used it. So, in order to make sure I don't screw up and use a feature newer than what 5.004 offers, I decided to download the <a href="http://www.cpan.org/src/5.0/perl5.004_05.tar.gz">source for 5.004<a/> and install it.
</p>
<p>
Downloading the source and running <code>sh Configure</code> (as the INSTALL file says to do) was easy enough. Knowing how to answer the various questions Configure asks was not. Nor was it quickly apparent that Configure used the file 'makefile' during the configuration process. (I'm don't have a lot of experience with make, so that's probably why).  Unfortunately, for me, I forgot to use the HFS+ with case sensitivity, so the files 'makefile' and 'Makefile' aren't different. So it wasn't until I actually peeked about inside that I realized if I changed the default for Configure to use 'makefile.osx' as the default Makefile (line 3370 of Configure), that Configure would properly make a Makefile. However, even after I did that, the makefile in the x2p subdirectory kept saying that I needed to <code>make depend</code>, even tho' I had already made it. So I had to comment out the last three lines of Makefile in x2p to keep the make'ing going.
</p>
<p>
After I finally got a working config.sh (and by working, I mean <code>make</code> ran to completion), a couple of the tests didn't pass:
<pre>
Failed 2 test scripts out of 164, 97.56% okay.
one is t/lib/complex.t -- Out of memory!
another is t/lib/db-recno.t -- test 25
</pre>
Turns out  I could get rid of the "Out of memory!" error  by using the malloc that came with perl and the ignoring my the system's malloc. (I think <a href="http://blog.segment7.net/articles/2006/02/19/undefined-method-for-symbol-on-os-x">this</a> might have been part of the problem, but didn't fiddle with it further.) If anyone else is adventurous and wants to have 5.004_05 on their mac and is having trouble, let me know and I'll post my config.sh somewhere.
<strong>update: my <a href="http://www.unobe.com/files/osx/perl5.004_05/config.sh">config.sh</a>.</strong>

<h2>I do.</h2>

I have a few modules (Module::Install and Locale::Maketext::Lexicon in particular) that needs to work with 5.004, and I'd like to have it installed on MacBook as well.

Module::Install for 5.004 would be great! For now I'm putting the config.sh <a href="http://www.unobe.com/files/osx/perl5.004_05/config.sh" title="unobe.com">here</a unobe.com>.
