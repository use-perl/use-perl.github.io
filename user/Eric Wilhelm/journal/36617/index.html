<p>I just discovered that L(qw(foo bar baz))->first(sub {1}) would segfault (in fact, any call to the first() method would segfault) because the code which passes the arguments through to List::Util::first() had been generated with the wrong prototype.<br/><br/>So, List::oo apparently needs better test coverage.  But, it also apparently has only one user, so...<br/><br/>Ah well, I shipped a new version anyway.<br/><br/>I know there's a general dislike of phone-homing, but it would be nice to have some inkling of how many people *might* be using which of my modules (breaking something is always a good way to take a rough census, but even then you're only going to hear from the people who were using the feature <em>and</em> noticed the breakage <em>and</em> bothered to report it.)  I think what is needed here is some combination between social and technological hacks -- preserving anonymity and achieving just the right level of bug-me-ness.  I've often thought that such an approach would also be useful in getting more input to cpan ratings.</p>

<h2>Strawberry Perl module download stats might help</h2>

The heading says it all: If Adam decided to regularly release (anonymized) download statistics for his Strawberry Perl CPAN redirector, that could help somewhat. It's a biased picture, but better than nothing.<br><br>So far, though, Adam never answered when somebody suggested this. I'm not sure whether it's lack of time to write the bits of code for automation or whether he'd rather not release the information.

Mostly it's just me being too lazy to write the log munging code...<br><br>Oddly, you'd be surprised how little in the way of installs end up in my logs.<br><br>Even as the download rates of strawberry itself has grown, the logs from the cpan mirror hasn't grown to match it.<br><br>I can only assume many people install stuff once and then don't need more, or are just switching fairly quickly to a more local mirror.<br><br>If someone wanted to help write the log munger, I'd be happy to get the help though.
