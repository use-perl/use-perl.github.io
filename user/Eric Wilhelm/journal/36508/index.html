<div class="span8">
<p>Tonight I kicked-off the "Er.pm" brand with the HTTP::Server::Simple::Er module.  I don't know if I'll be able to build the brand to the level of Adam's "::Tiny", but we'll see.<br/><br/>In any case, I seem to always want something more from an API and I tend to get deadlocked thinking of names instead of writing code.  Plus, it amuses me that "Eric's Rewrite|Redesign" neatly abbreviates to "Er" and acts as a pun suffix ;-)<br/><br/>And, it is also rather "Er" in some cases.  That is, the "::Er" modules are likely to be just about the opposite of "::Tiny", because I usually want more cowbell and I probably expect that you're running a perl which was released in the last 5 years with a working toolchain.<br/><br/>It also might stand for "Experimental Release" or "Emphasis on Rabbit".  If we had a tidier way to run forked API's in our namespace, we wouldn't have to talk about what it means.<br/><br/>Anyway, that's one more distraction^Wdependency down, and only about 6 to go before the task at hand is actually done...</p>

I don't get it... what exactly does it mean?<br><br>Are there criteria for it?<br><br>Or is it just "my extensions to stuff"...<br><br>

<h2>Re: criteria?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Eric Wilhelm/">Eric Wilhelm</a> on 2008-05-25T18:42:32</h3>
It is typically not "my extensions to<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...", and much more likely "my frustrations with<nobr> <wbr></nobr>..." or "my attempt to rethink<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...".  If it were a simple matter of extensions or mixins, those could usually be given a proper namespace.<br><br>In a couple of the cases on my todo list, the original API simply grates on me and the only way forward is a complete rewrite.<br><br>So, usually it is a sort of "I wish it had been done this way to start with" or "what if..." and like I said:  probably an experiment.
