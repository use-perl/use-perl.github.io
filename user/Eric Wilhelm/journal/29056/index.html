<p><p>I'm currently pondering a system for storing sample files for automated and manual testing (of the <a href="http://scratchcomputing.com/projects/uber-converter/">UberConverter</a>.)  One goal of this is to turn this pile of files into something with some attached meta-data, and another is to allow me to easily add them to a list of files to be run through a given automated test.</p>

<p>Has it been done before?  In a way that plays nicely with subversion?  With an open source implementation?  With very little setup needed on the client side?</p>

<p>I have not been thinking along the lines of an SQL database.  Seems that would be too much hassle to get it running out of a tarball on any platform, though I guess sqlite would be an option.  All the same, I'm guessing that the problems which that solves would not payoff against the burden of opacity.</p>

<p>So, I'm considering writing something which is largely based on convention and using subversion's builtin metadata.  The propedit command allows me to drop into an editor.  Also, renaming a sample file means that the info moves along with it.</p>

<p>But, renaming a test script leaves me needing a validator for the props.  Alas.  Everything is doomed to eventually be laden with formality?  Feature creep at the "dreams and kittens" stage can't be helping that &mdash; I've already been picturing a webapp with wiki-like features for uploading sample files.</p></p>
