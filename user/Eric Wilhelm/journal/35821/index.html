<p>Andy Lester reminded me that I have roughly the opposite of a tendency to state the obvious, which isn't a particularly great PR strategy.<br/><br/>So, what does Perl get out of participating in Summer of Code?  Why should we spend all of this time and effort to mentor?<br/><br/>For starters, there are the community and publicity benefits:<br/><br/>1.  New blood.  My hair might still only be white on the inside, but I am getting too old to play the part of Perl's "young crowd."<br/><br/>2.  A place in the minds of students (and academia in general.)<br/><br/>3.  Staying in the headlines -- if we don't have a presence, we lose mindshare.<br/><br/>On top of that, students are competing for these internships -- so we're getting self-selected and motivated individuals writing new code.  Those who enjoy teaching will understand what a great experience that can be.  (And those who don't know if they enjoy teaching couldn't pick a better chance to try it.)<br/><br/>And those are just some generalizations.  Use your imagination and your own point of view and you should be able to find a few specific reasons of your own.  There have been quite a few good project ideas suggested so far <a href="http://www.perlfoundation.org/perl5/index.cgi?gsoc2008">on the wiki</a>, including several for parrot.<br/><br/>So, for me it seems much more like a question of why <b>wouldn't</b> you want to help make Perl a successful participant in summer of code.</p>

<h2>Huh?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Alias/">Alias</a> on 2008-03-03T08:45:57</h3>
Is someone suggesting that we don't do it?<br><br>Has nobody remembered that Inline::Java came out of a SoC project?<br><br>

<h3><a href="/user/Ovid/">Ovid</a> on 2008-03-03T09:22:39</h3>
<p>I'd be surprised if anyone is suggesting that.  For all of the hassle, it's a fun project with high visibility.</p>



<blockquote>

<h2>Re:Huh?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/petdance/">petdance</a> on 2008-03-03T23:14:43</h3>
Yes, but WHY is that high visibility valuable?  Just because we say "Hey, look, Perl!" doesn't make a project valuable.

<p>

Again, not stating it's not valuable, but I think we need to say WHY it's valuable.</p>

<p><div class="quote">Is someone suggesting that we don't do it?</div> No.  Andy was suggesting that my PR efforts need to include an explicit statement of motivations.  Perhaps I should leave the PR to the experts, since all this post seems to have accomplished is to introduce the possibility for confusion.<br><br>Well anyway, if someone asks you "why?", maybe this helps, but Inline::Java is a great example.

<h2>The genesis of Inline::Java</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/nicholas/">nicholas</a> on 2008-03-22T00:39:27</h3>
<p>Eh? I think that there is some confusion here. <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/patl/Inline-Java-0.01/" title="cpan.org"> <code>Inline::Java</code> 0.01 dates from 2001.</a cpan.org> That predates Google Summer of Code by 4 years. Is it being confused with something else?</p>
