<p><p>On the off chance that the lack of community contributions is due to a terrible name, "The UberConverter" will henceforth be known as <a href="http://scratchcomputing.com/projects/vectorsection/">VectorSection</a>.  I have also obtained <a href="http://vectorsection.org/">vectorsection.org</a> and will be working on disassociating this hair-brained idea from the hair-brained idea that is Scratch Computing.</p>

<p>Okay, so the name change isn't really simply a PR ploy.  I always thought that Uber Converter was not the best name for a vector graphics translator.  Please, no VectorMagick suggestions -- I don't want to share half a brand.  But, a better name could never hurt and working titles just aren't professional, right?</p>

<p>Which brings me to the question of what it takes to get more community involvement and third-party contributions in a project which has been specifically designed (architecturally) to foster this?  I hear a lot of "but I don't know Perl" where I've said before that all you have to know is YAML.  I should just claim that it is written in C++?  See, the question "what language is it written in?" is really asking "can I use language X to write a component?" and the answer is "YES!"</p>

<p>Slight exceptions WRT java, C#, and etc. -- only in that I want installation to be easy on lots of platforms without depending on proprietary third-party runtimes.  Sounds like a job for Parrot?</p></p>
