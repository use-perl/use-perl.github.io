<p><p>The <a href="http://www.perlfoundation.org/perl5/index.cgi?hall_of_shame">Hall of Shame</a> page on the wiki has been called "a flame war waiting to happen".  Really?  Does it help if it comes with reasons and I'm willing to put my name on my opinions?</p>

<p>IIRC, Schwern had a litmus test for this sort of thing.  Should probably find that link...</p></p>

<h2>flamewar?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/educated_foo/">educated_foo</a> on 2007-10-23T05:01:37</h3>
That was me...  I thought it would become a flamewar because creating a "hall of shame" invites people to find tutorials to slag on (it's fun!) rather than to actually use.  I think "shaming" also encourages strident rather than thoughtful criticism.  That said, I think now that the page could also become merely useless: if you already have a page that says "look at these things," how much do you gain by having another that says "don't look at these," especially when the web is so full of stuff that's not worth reading?

<p>Of course, it may not be a big issue -- from glancing over the perl wiki, it seems like the contributions are still mostly civil and helpful.</p>
