I finally got a new release of CAD::Drawing out the door.  This didn't add any features besides whatever might have creeped into it in the last year (<small>ok, there's that save to image thing, which is pretty neat</small>.)
</p>
<p>
But this involved a lot of juggling support files.  These modules started in their individual distributions with EU::MM and I had decided to move them to Module::Build as well as condensing them into 8 distributions (putting several modules in the "core" CAD::Drawing, but keeping the plugins as individual packages.)
</p>
<p>
Ok, enough setup.  My e-mail address, employer, copyright dates, and several other global values have changed a few times and I wanted to get everything pounded into the same shape without mistakes, and without sed (not on the multiline stuff, <em>please</em>) and without writing a custom utility for each task.  Note that the point was not to save time yesterday (though I may have managed that, it is a slim margin at best.)  The point is to work toward something like a module_shepherd app which is going to be the &lt;tron reference&gt;MCP&lt;/tron reference&gt; for my CPAN code.
</p>

<h2>Enter the PodAdz</h2>

<p>
Of course any self-respecting hacker knows what an adz<small>(e)</small> is right?  Actually, now that I look for it, I can't find the definition that linked the two together.  Oh well, this is a curved tool for hacking on your POD.  'Nuff said...
</p>
<p>usage is just:  <code>podadz <em>command</em> &lt;file&gt; &lt;directory&gt;</code>.  Where <em>command</em> is either "breakout" or "assemble" (for now.)  So,</p>
<pre>
$ mkdir /tmp/pods
$ find */trunk/lib -name '*.pm' \
    > /tmp/pm_list
$ for f in $(cat /tmp/pm_list)
  do p=$(echo $f | perl -pe \
     's#.*/lib/##;s/\.pm//; s#/#::#g;')
    podadz breakout $f /tmp/pods/$p
done
$ md5sum /tmp/pods/*/*AUTHOR
</pre>
<p>
And that shows you fingerprints for all of your author sections.  Note, the chunk filename is preceded by a number, which is all that really matters when we go to put it back together.  Now say that you have a file <em>/tmp/the_author</em> with all of your current contact info:</p>
<pre>
head1 AUTHOR

Just S. Omeguy <jsomeguy at cpan dot org>

http://thatguy.com
</pre>
<p><small>Note missing /^=/.  That's part of the trick.  I also throw in the "\n\n=cut\n" for free.</small>  You can symlink all of the author files to this bit...</p>
<pre>
$ for i in /tmp/pods/*/*head1_AUTHOR
  do rm $i; ln -s /tmp/the_author $i
done
</pre>
<p>And then just reassemble...</p>
<pre>
$ for f in $(cat /tmp/pm_list)
  do p=$(echo $f | perl -pe \
     's#.*/lib/##;s/\.pm//; s#/#::#g;')
    podadz assemble $f /tmp/pods/$p
done
</pre>
<p>Oh, and it uses PPI.  It does eat your trailing whitespace on the first run-through, but is anyone really attached to those dangling &nbsp;&nbsp;'s?</p>
