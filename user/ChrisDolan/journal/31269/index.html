<div class="span8">
<p>Thanks greatly to input from <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/jjore">Joshua ben Jore</a>, my new module <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Devel-EnforceEncapsulation/">Devel::EnforceEncapsulation</a> is headed for CPAN.  This module employs a hack to block raw access to a blessed reference from outside its class.  An example:<br/><br/><pre>
use BankAccount;
use Devel::EnforceEncapsulation;<br/><br/>Devel::EnforceEncapsulation->apply_to( 'BankAccount' );                                                
my $acct = BankAccount->new();                                                                       
print $acct->balance(),"\n";  # ok                                                                   
print $acct->{balance},"\n";  # dies                                                                 
</pre><br/><br/>The original idea came from <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/Ovid/journal/31241">Ovid and Adrian Howard</a>.  Ovid has expressed an interest in creating a Class::Encapsulate which would be a production-quality version of this enforcement.</p>

Have you considered applying this directly to objects? Use Symbol::gensym to get a new package, make the object ISA the new class. Potentially you have to rebless the object higher or something. I'm guessing chromatic and Ovid did something similar with Class::Trait.

That's possible.  Another way is simply:<br><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Devel::EnforceEncapsulation-&gt;apply_to($pkg);<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; my $obj = $pkg-&gt;new();<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Devel::EnforceEncapsulation-&gt;remove_from($pkg);<br><br>The instance keeps the overload, but subsequent instantiations are not affected.  The only downside to that approach is that it might blow away any deref overloads that may exist in $pkg.  But that's a pretty small hazard.<br>

It's also not reentrant since you're fiddling with a global.

Good point.

<h2>Changing my mind</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Ovid/">Ovid</a> on 2006-10-09T22:36:55</h3>
<p>After giving it a lot of thought, I'm thinking now that <tt>Class::Encapsulate</tt> might seem like a good idea, but it's probably more trouble than it's worth.  I think that your plan of applying it at runtime for development is probably a cleaner way to go.</p>

I appreciate that.  In our discussions, I've been frequently reminded of Linus Torvalds' <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/31312/" title="lwn.net">opinion</a lwn.net> on hacks to protect the Linux userspace from stack smashing exploits:<br><blockquote><div>"In short, anybody who thinks that the non-executable stack gives them any real security is very very much living in a dream world. It may catch a few attacks for old binaries that have security problems, but the basic problem is that the binaries allow you to overwrite their stacks."</div></blockquote><br>In typical Linus style that statement is harsher than it needs to be, but I consider the protection of hash refs to be a similar scenario: a gesture toward encapsulation that only partially solves the problem.  However, also like non-executable stacks, hash encapsulation is useful for finding cases where non-malicious code is violating convention.<br><br>Like the Linux kernel and non-executable stacks, Perl objects may someday get good protection without the encumberance of inside-outness.  But unless Class::Encapsulate takes off, that might have to wait for Perl 6.<br>

Wow, that's very similar!  I had done some searches for "overload" and "'%{}'" before writing mine and your module did not show up.<br><br>The key difference between our implementations are:<br>
&nbsp; * Mine applies externally post-facto, yours from inside the code<br>
&nbsp; * Mine allows access from sub/superclasses, yours does not (deliberately!)<br>
&nbsp; * Mine supports all of overload.pm's dereferencers, yours supports %,@,$, and &amp;.<br>
&nbsp; * Mine allows access from anything in the same package, yours allows access only from matching package AND file<br>To generalize, your implementation is stricter.<br><br>I'll document all that in my SEE ALSO.<br><br>I like your comment about foolproofness.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br>
