<p>[I started asking this question on IRC, but it got too complicated...  It seems like something basic that most DBAs should know, but I'm not a DBA and I couldn't find a good solution after some searching.]<br/><br/>What's the best way to represent polymorphism in a collection of database tables?<br/><br/>Consider a website where students answer surveys administered by faculty or departments.  Start with three database tables: survey, faculty, and department.  How do I indicate one-to-one ownership from faculty to survey and from department to survey?  I like the strong-typing guarantees of foreign keys, so I really want to avoid un-keyed solutions.<br/><br/>I've thought about the following solutions, but I'm unhappy with all of them:<br/><br/><dl>
<dt>One null field</dt>
<dd>Put "faculty_id" and "department_id" foreign keys in the survey table and insist that exactly one is not null.  This is awkward in code due to the pervasive conditionals, and problematic as I consider more things that both faculty and departments can own (e.g. student rosters)</dd>
<dt>Single owner table, two-to-one</dt>
<dd>The survey table has an owner_id which points to an owner table which has faculty_id and department_id fields, exactly one of them non-null.  This is easier to code than the above because everything gets exactly one "owner".</dd>
<dt>Single owner table, two-to-many</dt>
<dd>Ownership is not represented in the survey table, but instead the owner table has faculty_id, department_id and survey_id fields.  This seems to have no advantage over the "One null field" option.</dd>
<dt>Multiple owner tables</dt>
<dd>Create a faculty_survey and department_survey one-to-many tables.  How do ensure that each survey is represented exactly once across those two tables?</dd>
<dt>Multiple survey tables</dt>
<dd>Partition the surveys into two tables, one for faculty surveys and one for department surveys.  This is very painful as I add more things that can be owned.</dd>
</dl><br/><br/>Am I missing something obvious?  What happens when I add another type that can be an owner?</p>

<h2>Which database engine are you using?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/mattk/">mattk</a> on 2008-06-14T07:54:19</h3>
You could use Postgres schemas to achieve this - keep your survey table in one schema, and your faculty/department tables, identically structured, in seperate schemas. When you want to work with the faculty stuff, set your search path to survey + faculty. If the survey schema holds unique keys, the same join queries should return different results based on which schema is active.

o The survey table has a context_id<br><br>o The context table has:<br>- the id pointed to by context_id<br>- the owner_id<br>- the owner_type_id<br><br>o The owner_type table has:<br>- the id pointed to by owner_type_id<br>- the name of the owner type<br><br>o The owner_id points to either the faculty<br>table's id or the dept table's id (if you<br>insist on having these in separate tables,<br>an assumption which needs questioning)<br><br>(o Alternately, the faculty and dept tables<br>can have owner_type_id, of course)<br><br>o The owner_type's name tells you what type<br>of thing, faculty or dept, to instantiate<br>to handle the desired behaviour of the<br>owner<br><br>o The owner_type table can be effortlessly<br>extended, as per the very last comment in<br>your original post<br><br>o The golden rule is that every list of<br>things goes in it's own table. Hence the<br>tables for surveys, owner_types, faculties<br>and depts (if the last 2 are really so<br>different)<br><br>o From that follows the owner_type_id<br>field and the owner_id field<br><br>o Your design fault, which you seem committed<br>to, is the put a list into a list of foreign<br>keys, faculty_id and dept_id, rather than<br>into a table. It's a classic mistake<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br><br>o Reposted via emacs after use.$curse.perl.org<br>let me preview and submit my last post but still<br>threw it away, AFAICT<br>
