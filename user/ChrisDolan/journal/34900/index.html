<div class="span8">
<p>I have a lot of programming niche interests -- video, <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Net-VNC/">VNC</a>, <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Perl-Critic/">static analysis</a>, PDF, filesystems, <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/FLV-Info">Flash</a>, <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/CAM-SOAPClient">SOAP</a>, etc.  Most of all, I love it when these interests intersect.  For example, I wrote still-closed-source (sigh) library that converts a VNC stream to QuickTime.  A prototype of that software was the basis for the <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Test-Virtual-Filesystem/">YAPC::NA 2006 videos</a> I produced.<br/><br/>Another convergence happened last week.  Google released <a href="http://code.google.com/p/macfuse/">MacFUSE 1.x</a>, a Mac port of the Linux user-mode filesystem code.  I had tried an earlier version, but I never got the Perl bindings (<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Fuse/">Fuse.pm</a>) to work right.  What can this do?  It lets you write your own mountable virtual filesystem in a couple hundred lines of code.<br/><br/>Back in 2002-2005, I did a ton of PDF work.  A result of that was a base library, <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/CAM-PDF/">CAM::PDF</a>.  I got authority to release it to CPAN about the same time the business motivation for the library dried up.  But in the process, I learned the PDF specification inside and out.  PDF is basically a serialization of an arbitrary tree structure: strings, numbers, hashes, arrays, references and blobs, all in an almost-human-readable syntax.<br/><br/>You can store <b>anything</b> in PDF.  Most of that tree is focused on storing pages, text and graphics, but the fascinating part is <i>that's just convention</i>.  The underlying data structure is generic.<br/><br/>So why not put filesystem data and metadata inside a PDF?  I mentioned the idea at the last <a href="http://madmongers.org/">Madison Perl Mongers</a> meeting and they laughed at me! (LAUGHED! at ME!)  Well, that was enough motivation!  A weekend later, I released <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Fuse-PDF">Fuse:PDF</a> v0.01 to CPAN.  It's still very worthy of the v0.01 label (no symlinks, no hardlinks, no large files) but it's usable.<br/><br/>What do you think?  Inspired or daft?  Should I have put it in the Acme:: namespace?  :-)<br/><br/>[Along the way, I'm also writing <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Test-Virtual-Filesystem/">Test::Virtual::Filesystem</a> which is a collection of typical file I/O actions that should work on any mounted filesystem.]</p>

You must build it!



<h2>Figuring out perl FUSE</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/bill_mcgonigle/">bill_mcgonigle</a> on 2008-06-06T05:04:41</h3>
I saw in your CPAN review that it was difficult to figure out the minimum number of functions required to be implemented by a perl FUSE filesystem - did you find this documented anywhere (or document it yourself)?

No, I just kept implementing methods until I was satisfied with the behavior.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br><br>Seriously, though, statfs and getattr are probably the bare minimum, followed by mknod getdir open and read.<br><br>Take a peek at Test::Virtual::Filesystem which can help to validate your FUSE implementation.

Oh, fantastic, I didn't even see the test suite when I was looking last night.  Your methodology is admirable.
<br> <br><br/><br/>I'm going to take a stab at an 'md5uniqfs', which stores one copy of a given file per filesytem, hardlinking duplicates.  Should be useful for backups.
<br>
<br><br/><br/>Having a good test should really help.  Thanks!

Very cool!  Drop me an email when it's ready for use.  I'd like to try it out.
