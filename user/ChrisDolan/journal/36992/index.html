<div class="span8">
<p>I <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/ChrisDolan/journal/36296">mentioned</a> a while back that I was playing with a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parrot_virtual_machine#Compiler_tools">PCT</a>-based grammar to parse Yacc files and transcode the Yacc grammar to PCT.<br/><br/>My project took two big detours.<br/><br/>First, I re-learned that Yacc is a parser for a pre-tokenized stream and does not include lexing or scanning, unlike PCT.  So it is infeasible to do a full, automated translation.  I suspected that would be the case when I started, but I didn't realize how far from complete my translation would be.  Basically, I generate a lot of mostly-useful PGE "rule {}" constructs, but then a lot of placeholder "token {}" constructs that need to be addressed by a human.<br/><br/>The second detour was that I was trying to learn Yacc and PCT/PGE at the same time, which was too much.  So, I dropped down to Perl5 and wrote a parser based on the m/\G.../cgxms construct.  The good news is that I finished, and the parser is blazing fast, if verbose.  I can parse the whole Yacc vocabulary (well, Bison v2.1 really). My testcases are perl/perly.y, bash/parse.y, cola.y, lua51.y and even bison/parse-gram.y.  I am generating PCT grammar.pg and actions.pm files that actually compile, but they are far from functional -- they're just starting points, really, but they're better than a blank page I think.<br/><br/>So, opinions are welcome:
<ul><li>Should I continue working on the Perl5 parser to get it to make better PCT output?</li>
<li>Should I work on porting the parser itself to PCT?</li>
<li>Should I put this aside and start using it to make real Parrot code from existing Yacc grammars?</li>
<li>Or should I work on the RT/CPANTesters bugs that have been accumulating against my existing packages?  Sigh...</li></ul>
