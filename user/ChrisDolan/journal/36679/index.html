<p>Lazyweb:<br/><br/>Catalyst uses HTTP::Body to decode incoming HTTP requests.  This is particularly important for HTML form-based file uploads.  It works great for me in any browser and when uploading text files.  But when uploading binary files via Test::WWW::Mechanize::Catalyst, HTTP::Body over-reads the MIME part and drops the file upload.<br/><br/>I suspect its a problem with byte-length vs. character-length of a string, where my request has some UTF-8ness going on in the Test::W::M::C workflow (where the request never actually goes over the wire -- it stays in the same Perl process the whole time).<br/><br/>Has anyone else encountered this?  I posted a <a href="http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=36709">workaround request</a> to RT for HTTP::Body, but I'm not sure who's really at fault here: me, HTTP::Body or T::W::M::C.</p>

Hi Chris,
Oddly enough ( or not so oddly enough ) this is happening to me too.
The interesting thing is that I was able to upload files using WWW::Mechanize::Shell and Test::WWW::Mechanize so I'm guessing you are not the problem.

Hi Chris,
After some rudimentary digging around I'm fairly sure this is in &amp;T::W::M::C::_make_request. If you set $mech-&gt;allow_external(1) and add your port to the URL you are trying to test, it falls back to the  W::M::_make_request implementation and everything works great. Since Test::Catalyst starts your application it is in fact listening on the dev port (whatever port you have selected, default 3000 ) and the request will succeed. Not very portable but it works until I can figure out how to patch T::W::M::C.

<p>Thanks for the info.  I'm using my own hack -- Base64 encoding the uploaded file and doing a special-case decode server-side -- which is working well enough for the moment.</p><p>If you or I can isolate the problem far enough, one of us should write it up as an RT bug report.</p>

I talked to the package maintainer this morning and he asked me to patch it if I could. Seems he's swamped with other stuff. I'll look into getting a patch out sometime next month. ( Hopefully  I can find the exact cause in a week or two )
