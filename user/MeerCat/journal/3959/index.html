<p>Hmm... now have a team of 5 highly paid very competent programmers who have managed to re-write my perl'isms in C++ (which appears to have now become a very ugly language since being my native language for 10 years) - and despite 35 of the biggest companies in the world deciding that "this writing-it-in-house is the only viable solution", we still seem to be stuck at the "but you can't go any further until we all make our own tuppence worth of comment", combined with "I know you haven't been allowed to formally start the project, and we've changed the entire scope/timescale plan 4 times in the last 3 months, but you will still deliver by the date you quoted 6 months ago won't you"...<br/><br/>So tomorrow I have 10 project managers descending for PowerPoint presentations, rather than just the 5 of last time - this (in The City) is progress...<br/><br/>Oh well, wrote a decent multi-language, multi-platform, multi-compiler-per-platform build system in perl (after looking at cons and various other alternatives to make) that's humming along nicely, and some quite handy perl modules to drive <a href="http://www.perforce.com/">perforce</a> operations too without needing to compile up the API - makes life easier to map from "this is series of the command-line operations I do that I want to automate". So the nightly "label and clean build at the top of the tree, and email the results to the build-meister, plus (if it doesn't work) send a threatening email to anyone who has submitted changes since the last time the build worked" seems to buzz along nicely in surprisingly little code - did I mention how much I like closures ??</p>
