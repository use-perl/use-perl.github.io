<p><p>My mug from <a href="http://www.yapceurope.org/2002/">YAPC::EU in Munich</a> broke today. I poured water into it from the kettle, heard a cracking sound, and brown liquid started to appear from the base. It now has a fine curving crack all the way down one side. :-(</p>
<p>Unlike some mugs, these ones don't seem to have infinite lifetime[*]. At my previous house the other housemates had three, and by the time we left two had died, of which at least one was due to similar non-impact induced failure.</p>
<p><small>* Oldest mug I have in continuous regular service is probably an "I was plundered from <a href="http://www.jorvik-viking-centre.co.uk/">Jorvik</a>" mug which dates from a family holiday in 1986ish</small></p></p>

I had been told it was a Krug. But that page actually seems to imply that either is functional.<br/><br/>And I use it sometimes for tea. ha!

<p>No, not crazy. I mean the black, half pint mug, rather than the creamy, considerably larger stein.</p>
<p>I forget who had the 2002 organisers in stitches by going up at the end of the conference and thanking them for the small beer stein and the sensibly sized coffee mug.</p>
