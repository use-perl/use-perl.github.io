<p><p>This <a href="http://www.musicvoyager.com/info/tr/Trumpton.html">article about Trumpton</a> suggests that <cite>the musical box device used in Camberwick Green was dropped from the new series, perhaps because some children found it upsetting</cite>. I didn't find it upsetting. I actually liked the sense of closure it gave as the character disappeared away, the entire world of Camberwick Green put on hold until the next episode. Am I on my own here? Am I just strange?</p></p>

I never saw Trumpton, or knew anything about it and have only now realised what Half-Man Half-Biscuit were singing about in "Trumpton Riots".<br><br>John.<br>--<br>



<h2>Tidying up</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/barbie/">barbie</a> on 2005-08-12T10:01:42</h3>
I always liked the idea of the character going back in the musical box. It was the part of tidying up after you'd been playing with your toys, and were getting ready for lunch or tea. I'm old enough to remember Camberwick Green, Trumpton and Chigley the first time around. I used to like the clown doing the roller board for the credits to Trumpton.
<p>The other 'Watch With Mother' series of programmes where a joy too. The Woodentops, Pogle's Wood and Tales From The Riverbank were great.</p>
