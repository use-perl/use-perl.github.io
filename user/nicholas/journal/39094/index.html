<p><p>Dear POSIX,</p>
<p>Why did you decide that <code>xargs</code> with no filename arguments should run the command <b>once</b>? I can only assume that there are zero mathematicians and <b>zero computer scientists</b> on the relevant committee. How else could such a demented special case get through?</p></p>

<h2>Either Way Can Be Wrong</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Smylers/">Smylers</a> on 2009-06-08T10:37:00</h3>
<p>I used to think that as well (though I'm not sure Posix are necessarily at fault: possibly they just codified what was already a <i>de facto</i> standard).</p><p>Then I encountered a situation where I did need the command to run once, even with no arguments.  In normal circumstances* the command runs exactly once regardless of the number of arguments, not once per argument, so there's consistency in making this always be once, even with no arguments.</p><p>Whichever way they picked was going to be wrong sometimes.  What they really should've done was spec an option for picking the &#x2018;other&#x2019; behaviour.  I'm still inclined to think they picked the wrong default, but so long as I could get both I'm not that bothered.</p><p>Gnu's <code>xargs</code> has the <code>-r</code> option, which does what you want.  FreeBSD's (and therefore presumably OS&nbsp;X's) doesn't have this option.**</p><p>Frustratingly I can't now recall the circumstances in which I wanted the &#x2018;run once anyway&#x2019; behaviour; if I remember I'll post a follow-up, since I realize this is much less persuasive without it!</p><p> <small>* Non-normal circumstances include having so much input it needs to be split into multiple invocations of the command, or using <code>-n&nbsp;1</code> to run the command once per argument.</small> </p><p> <small>** FreeBSD's does however have the useful <code>-o</code> option, handy for opening a bunch of files in Vim, which Gnu's is missing.</small> </p>



<h2>There is worse precedent</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Aristotle/">Aristotle</a> on 2009-06-08T15:51:22</h3>
<p>Most shells will invoke <code>foo</code> and pass a literal <code>bar.*</code> as the first argument if you run <code>foo bar.*</code> if nothing in the current directory matches <code>bar.*</code>. In bash since 2.something you can <code>shopt -s failglob</code> to prevent this.</p><p>But then the shell will also refuse to let you run <code>foo bar.* baz.*</code> if <em>either</em> <code>bar.*</code> or <code>baz.*</code> fail, when really you probably only wanted it to refuse if <em>both</em> fail. So basically you want the behaviour of <code>shopt -s nullglob</code> when there&#8217;s more than one glob.</p><p>Or at least, you want that behaviour most of the time.</p><p>Defaults: It&#8217;s Tricky To Get Them Right.</p>
