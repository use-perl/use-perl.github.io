<p><p>So, for some reason I woke up around 4 this morning with images of battles
in Moria disturbing me, and keeping me from sleep. I have no idea what prompted
this, as I last read the book over 10 years ago, and I only saw the film when
it was on release at the cinema. Strange.</p>

<p>Of course, my subconscious being helpful, it decided that while I was awake
and on the subject of disturbing images, it should go and work out what else
it could find to associate with this theme. It remembered for me a story that
someone told me about cave diving. Now, caving is dangerous, and diving is
dangerous, so obviously it's logical to combine the two and compound the
risks.  Anyway, what I was once told was about someone on his first cave dive,
squeezing his way through a passage where visibility was only a few inches,
and coming face to face with a skull behind a visor. He'd bumped into (almost
literally) a previous less-than-successful cave diver on the same
route. Somehow this guy kept his nerve, and not only backed himself out
safely, but also managed to recover the body. I don't know if he did it again,
but the happy images put me off the idea of ever trying</p>

<p>Not content with that, it then decided to remember the stories behind a
couple of untimely deaths related to people I know. I'm not going to share them
here, partly because I suspect that I find them upsetting more because I know
the people involved than because of the cause, but mostly because in each case
having learned the story, I discovered that I would rather not know it.
In one case this was after curiosity got the better of me and I didn't heed
the advice of a friend who said "you don't want to know". He was right.</p>

<p>Fortunately I don't seem to associate much imagery with either, so my
subconscious failed around this point and eventually I did get back to
sleep.</p></p>
