<div class="span8">
<p><p>Curiously in the past 24 hours two different entities have effectively asked the same question - "given development funding, can the Perl core be made faster?"</p><p>Having spent a couple of years trying to benchmark, profile and accelerate the core, generally with no measurable impact, I'm coming to the general conclusion "no". Of course, there are specifics - there are still some algorithmic wins to be made in the regexp engine, and Yves' recent work on these is very welcome. In turn, there are improvements that can be made to the regexp engine's optimiser (the code that attempts to avoid even calling into the engine itself). But apart from that, my considered opinion after banging my head against the problem for so long is</p>
<ol><li>Ouch!</li>
<li>There are no significant wins left to be found</li>
</ol>
<p>I reserve the right to be proved wrong. Only working proofs will be accepted. :-)</p></p>

<h2>Working proof</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jdavidb/">jdavidb</a> on 2006-06-28T18:10:35</h3>
<p>I can describe a working method for making the perl core faster, but it involves upgrading the processor you are using.  And all of us will probably be doing it at least once in the next 3-7 years or so.</p>



<h2>OK I'll bite...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Matts/">Matts</a> on 2006-06-28T18:15:37</h3>
What about Parrot? Isn't that supposed to make things faster, in part by switching from a stack model to a register model (and thus making optimisation easier), and also by making things easier to optimise at "compile" time?<br><br>Or is Parrot not the great-white-hope we think it is?

<h3><a href="/user/chromatic/">chromatic</a> on 2006-06-28T18:23:58</h3>
<p>The trick is refactoring (or reimplementing) Perl 5 so that it runs on Parrot.  It <em>ought</em> to make things faster though.</p>

I believe Ponie is dead.

Certainly nothing so far as p5p is concerned, nor any other of the various perl fora and lists I pay attention to.<br><br>But that's ok, we all know Perl is a volunteer-based operation.

In case my parrot comment didn't stab you enough<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br><br>A way of properly doing objects might actually speed things up a lot. If you could have a class with defined attributes so that when you access those attributes you don't have to go through a hash (or array even) you can get some decent performance improvements for object heavy systems (as fields.pm hints at).<br><br>Admittedly this doesn't affect boring benchmark applications, but it does help people whose day job it is building large scale apps with perl, and it could give them some sense of how things might be with perl6.

<p>This sounds like a lot of work. If someone want to volunteer to write such a thing, then great, patches welcome - although they should be warned that there can be no guarantee in advance that code will be accepted.</p>
<p>But I don't think that any of the current maintainers have a sufficient itch to scratch personally, so I cannot see such a project happening "by itself".</p>

Sure. But you did say "given development funding". So I took that as to mean "given infinite funding and infinite available monkeys". Hey I can dream can't I<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)

<h2>Re:OK, another stab...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/nicholas/">nicholas</a> on 2006-07-04T01:29:08</h3>
<p>A right. I didn't pick up on this as an approach to solving the "make perl faster". I was seeing the requestor's desire more to be to make their existing perl code faster (at least, without substantial re-writes). And this seems more like a way to make new code faster.</p>
<p>In turn, such an approach might have the same "speedup" as pseudo-hashes. Offhand I don't know the URL to the analysis, but someone [Schwern, IIRC] demonstrated that the real 15% speedup that pseudo-hashes provided for <code>use fields</code>  over regular hashes came with the side effect of slowing regular hashes down by about 15%. So best case was break even, and the general case was lose. Likewise, I fear that attribute access might require tentacles all over the existing method call or hash lookup code (particularly if duck typing is to work), so doing this sort of thing right might actually slow the current approach down further.</p>
<p>Finally, the timescale for anything as major as this is would be 5.12, not 5.10, and even if major releases got back to something like once every 2 years, that would still see it as being 3 years out. By which time I hope we have non-prototype Perl 6.</p>

Thinking of Perl 6 being ready in 3 years is dreaming. Sorry, but someone has to say it.<br><br>Classes need not be accessed through the hash API. I think of a class (or object) as another xV type, rather than another extension on SVs. But I know zip about the perl core - I'm purely speculating based on the little work I have done in XS.<br><br>I remember Schwern's analysis, but I also remember it being rather flawed because there's lots in later perls that slow it down (most notably unicode) that weren't taken into consideration. But my memory may be hazy on that.

I am sorry, but <a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?query=v6" title="cpan.org">v6.pm</a cpan.org> works today; the underlying support modules (Moose, Pugs::Compiler::Rule, ModulE::Compile) are useful in production; Perl 6 is just another CPAN module, and we are working to make it useful for production in <em>this</em> Christmas.
<p>
But you can use Moose or any other support modules without the v6.pm syntax sugar; if so, then it's ready even sooner.</p>



<blockquote>

<h2>Re:OK, another stab...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/audreyt/">audreyt</a> on 2006-07-06T08:44:12</h3>
Also, by "CPAN module" I mean "pure perl 5 CPAN module with some XS dependencies like PadWalker", so you do not need to install GHC or Parrot or any other runtime to make Perl 6 work.  which makes it far easier to deploy, too...



<h2>Re:OK, another stab...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Matts/">Matts</a> on 2006-07-06T13:36:03</h3>
We were talking about different things here (perl 6 being a fully finished and working perl 6 on its own interpreter). But saying v6.pm is working today is a long way off saying it's a finished perl 6. The perl 6 schedules have been way off from the start and I think my expectation of us being ready to transition people to perl 6 in 3 years is probably about right given what I know of the current development stage (unless there will be a Blue Peter "and here's one I made earlier" phase<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)).<br><br>In no way do I mean to insult the excellent work you've done Audrey - nor anyone else on the perl6 project. I think it's an important direction and one that takes a lot of time and energy, and I salute you for putting that effort in - I certainly can't say the same for myself.

Frankly I think the <em>Perl 6 on its own interpreter</em> idea doesn't work at all.
<p>
It's true that Perl 6 will run on multiple interpreters (including Parrot, JavaScript and more), but it's the perl5 interpreter that will get us to an incrementally-deployed production soonest.
</p><p>
That is, the <em>transition</em> to Perl 6 will be no different to, say, the <em>transition</em> to DateTime.pm; modules start using it, or part of it, when it makes sense, but it doesn't need to be an all-of-nothing process.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>

<h2>and option #3</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/hfb/">hfb</a> on 2006-06-29T06:02:02</h3>
why fucking bother?<br/><br/>Machines are getting faster and if the legacy code isn't working fast enough, instead of wasting time/money/angst on p5 perhaps migrating to something known for its speed would be a better use of resources. Tilting at windmills is only for the true romantics.<br/><br/>As I recall, someone asked the same question a while back and came to the same 'no' conclusion. I also seem to remember Alan Burlison having a few cutting, yet fitting, remarks about squeezing a few more drops of speed out of the p5 core.

<p>Also for large systems there comes the tipping point where developer time actually becomes cheaper than the costs of machines, maintenance and rack space. It's these sort of entities who were asking the question.</p>



<blockquote>

<h2>Re:and option #3</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/hfb/">hfb</a> on 2006-06-30T02:34:27</h3>
As someone who works in a joint with a Sun 25k, I realise that there are slower, cheaper options<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) However, at the point where you have the cost of a new machine exceeding the cost of labour, does the speed of the archaic code matter that much and, if it does, doesn't it make more sense to just rewrite it using something else...like C?



<blockquote>

<h2>Re:and option #3</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/nicholas/">nicholas</a> on 2006-07-01T09:46:07</h3>
<p>It was firms with over 50,000 lines of perl code that were thinking about it, one of which I know is running code across several hundred servers. I doubt that re-writing the whole thing in C (or anything) is easy, as I'm guessing that the cost of validating that the behaviour is the same is prohibitive, but re-writing parts might well be, if those parts can be identified. But I think that both were thinking that it still might be easier to concentrate resources on the core, as that could speed up all code, and the core does have very good regression tests. So I believe that their question is worth asking, to allow them to make a decision. But from this side of the fence, I can't see any big wins to be made in the core.</p>



<blockquote>

<h2>Re:and option #3</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/hfb/">hfb</a> on 2006-07-02T08:07:08</h3>
<p>
Well, with something like that you have to consider so many other possible bottlenecks, especially since much of the clustering software, if that's what they're using, do exact a speed toll. I'd call them outright awful, but a few of them do actually manage to work on occasion.
</p>
<p>
And, given the pain and suffering involved with changing most anything in the perl core, *ahem*, I'd guess that rewriting large parts or the whole thing would be faster and far less hassle with a greater performance gain. Anyone with 50k+ lines of perl expecting zippy performance gets what they deserve.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
</p>
<p>
The question was worth asking, but the answer may not be the one they like.

<h2>Inline functions?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Ovid/">Ovid</a> on 2006-08-07T18:33:30</h3>
<p>I know this comment is late, but I was wondering if it would be feasible to inline function calls to avoid the function call overhead?  I remember chromatic mentioning that he looked into this and saw that the pads were going to slow it down regardless (I could be misremembering) and I suspect that the difficulty in distinguishing between methods and subroutines would make this idea pretty much dead, but if it was feasible, would this speed up Perl?</p>



<blockquote>

<h2>Re:Inline functions?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/nicholas/">nicholas</a> on 2006-08-09T21:29:44</h3>
<p>Well, you have to assume that the function isn't going to get dynamically redefined. (or even <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/mjd/Memoize/Memoize.pm#SYNOPSIS" title="cpan.org">memoized</a cpan.org>). So inlining would be more like macros than true functions. I think someone was mentioning this on p5p at some point, but I've no idea how evolved (or involved) the implementation would be.</p>

<h2>Opcode fiddling presents an opportunity?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/demerphq/">demerphq</a> on 2006-11-12T14:28:19</h3>
Replacing commonly used general purpose opcodes with tailor made ones to optimise common constructs seems like relatively unexplored ground.<br><br>An example would be something like the work I recently did with if(%foo){}. Consider something like:<br><br>
&nbsp; @list = split<nobr> <wbr></nobr>//,$str;<br><br>This construct can be compile time resolved and replaced with a special "splitchar" op that doesnt even think about the regexp engine or go through any of the conditionals in the normal split opcode.<br><br>Im pretty sure that there are many such optimisation opportunities available.<br><br>Yves<br><br>



<blockquote>

<h2>Re:Opcode fiddling presents an opportunity?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Aristotle/">Aristotle</a> on 2006-11-12T19:33:37</h3>
<p>Problem with that is identifying the right places to build tailor-made code so you don&#x2019;t waste your time optimising things no one uses.</p>

<p>Also, TMTOWTDI means you have to make a reasonable guess at other ways of asking for the same thing. F.ex., off the top of my head, I can think of <code>@list = $str =~ m//g;</code> to do the same.</p>

<p>But sure, if you can come up with good common optimisations, you can possibly do a lot. An area where this has already been done and that IMHO still merits attention is <a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/functions/sort.html" title="perl.org"> <tt>sort</tt> </a perl.org> blocks.</p>
