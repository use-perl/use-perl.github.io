<p><p>The Register reports a piece of opposition spin that <a
href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/6/31142.html">Tony Blair has no e-mail
address</a>. Thinking that this is discraceful, they've helpfully set him up with
a hotmail account. So I started wondering what sort of spam he'll soon be
getting. Maybe something like this</p>
<br>
<p><strong>$$$ Make Mushrooms Fast $$$</strong></p>
<ul><li>Tired of being impotent on the world stage?</li> 
<li>Unable to buy the ingredients you need on the open market?</li> 
<li>Can't get the staff?</li> 
<li>Cyclotrons too slow?</li></ul>
<p><em>We have the answer.</em>  Here's how to do it without any pesky double
dealing arms traders, nosey weapons inspectors, or self righteous foreign powers
being any the wiser.</p>

<p>Just send 1g of weapons grade plutonium to the address at the top of this 
list. Do it discretely, in a lead lined jiffy bag so as not to arouse any 
suspicions. Next delete that address from the list, move all the others 
up by one, and then put your own address at the bottom of the list. 
Finally pass this message on to 6 of your friends (or enemies). That's
it! Soon you'll have enough plutonium rolling in to go critical.</p>

<p>Here's the list that leads to liberty:</p>

<ol><li>People's Front for an Independent Texas<br>
PO Box 1*<br>
Austin<br>

<li>ESR<br>

Or is this his secret hideaway to escape from Tubbie-bye-byes? Or the launch site for a retaliation attack on the Boohbah's attempt at taking the CeeBeeBees crown?

Or perhaps I ought stop watching kids TV with DanDan<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<p>I didn't, and a quick check on google didn't find it. Presumably as it (the set) physically exists it has a postcode?</p>
<blockquote><div>Or is this his secret hideaway to escape from Tubbie-bye-byes?</div></blockquote>
<p>Well it did occur to me that if you were potentially going to have packages arriving that could go boom, you may wish to have them delivered somewhere else. It's a bit like saying <a href="http://london.pm.org/pipermail/london.pm/Week-of-Mon-20010827/004298.html" title="pm.org">please send me an SS20</a pm.org> and leaving the word <em>send</em> open to interpretation.</p>
<p>Anyway, it brings a whole new meaning to <cite>time for tubby bye-bye.</cite> </p>
