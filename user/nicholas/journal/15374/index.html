<p>It must be true - <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/3211047.stm">the BBC said so</a> :-)</p></p>

<h2>And the BBC said......</h2>

<p>I once had an argument with some minion of the BBC who claimed that you had to have a modem to connect to the Internet. I pointed out that most people at that time on the Internet were on academic networks with no modems in site, and that only a tiny percentage of uses actually used a modem at home (which was true). The minion got all "high and mighty" and told me that telling people that they didn't need a modem to connect to the Internet would only confuse them.</p>

<p>Since that discussion, many people have got modems at home, but many more use the Internet at work now than then, and at last cable and xDSL are taking off, so the modem will be consigned to the scrap heap of history eventually.</p>

<p>As much as I like the BBC, they are a bit light on facts these days, and are quite happy to dumb things down to make a <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/low/business/3205080.stm" title="bbc.co.uk">good story</a bbc.co.uk>...</p>

<p>Oh well. Maybe it's time to switch our loyalty to <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/HomePage" title="aljazeera.net">Aljazeera</a aljazeera.net> or <a href="http://english.pravda.ru/" title="pravda.ru">Pravda</a pravda.ru> </p>
