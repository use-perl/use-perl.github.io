<p><p>Yesterday while out to lunch I went for a walk. As I was walking back to the office along Old Street a car sounded its horn. I looked up, and as far as I can make out over the trafic noise the female driver shouted out "nice bum!" I think what prompted this was that at that point I was walking with both hands stuffed in the rear pockets of my jeans.</p>
<p>Today I went into a shop at lunchtime to buy a large cappochino. While it was being made, I attempted to lean back onto a furniture unit with the napkin dispensor and spoons on it. Only the unit wasn't up for this, and decided to lean with me. It was a good job that I was doing this slowly, as I was able to stop before it and me ended up collapsed on the floor.</p></p>
