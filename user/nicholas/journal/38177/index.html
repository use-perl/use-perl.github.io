<p><blockquote>The attack against the electronic payment services firm leaves to to 1.5 million payroll and gift card holders in the US at risk of fraud. Up to 1.1 million social security records were also exposed as a result of the breach.</blockquote>
<blockquote><a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/12/29/rbs_worldpay_breach/">RBS WorldPay notified law enforcement and regulators about the attack on 10 November but waited until 23 December before publishing advice to potentially affected customers. The timing of its announcement raises suspicions that the firm is releasing bad news at a time when it is likely to go largely unnoticed.</a></blockquote>

<p>This would be a firm owned the same RBS that <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/08/26/more_details_lost/">lost a million customer records</a> and doesn't want you worry too much about that either.</p></p>

<h2>They're a bank, therefore they're secure</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/neilh/">neilh</a> on 2008-12-29T16:59:46</h3>
in the same way that windows defines everything in the kernel to be secure; drivers need to be secure; therefore drivers must live in the kernel, right?  What could possibly go wrong?



<h2>A significant mitigating fact</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/btilly/">btilly</a> on 2008-12-30T01:30:40</h3>
<p>In the USA the bulk of the financial risk is born by the financial institution.  In the event of a dispute if they cannot prove that you paid, you will win by default.  And saying, "our records indicate" is not proof.  That won't help your credit rating.  But it does keep you from losing actual money.  (And it gives financial companies incentives to do all sorts of odd things like keep videotapes of ATM withdrawals in case they get disputed...)</p><p>From what I've read, this is the opposite of the UK.  Which has lead to problems for consumers over there.</p><p>Therefore the people who are at risk of fraud from this are not as unprotected as you might think.</p>
