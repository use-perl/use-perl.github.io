If by "arabic" you mean 1,2,3,4,5... then, yes, Hebrew uses these as numbers. Note that you write and read Hebrew right-&gt;left, but numbers are written and read normally, as in English left-&gt;right.<p>
These numerals are called arabic, which is funny, because the arabs themselves use other characters for numbers.</p>

Those are called Arabic numbers because they are, indeed, variants on the
numeric symbols used in Arabic (see
<a href="http://www.omniglot.com/writing/arabic.htm" title="omniglot.com">samples here</a omniglot.com>).
Some of the shapes are easily recognizable, as are their decimal combination.
Those numbers have been introduced in Europe during the XIth or XIIth century
IIRC, by a Christian priest who made a travel through the Dar al-Islam to learn
about languages, religions and techniques. Their shape evolved to be more
compatible with the shape of manuscript latin letters used at this time.
(This priest later became a pope,
which is, I think, a good lesson in religious tolerance. Unfortunately I
don't remember <i>which</i> pope, and I've no time to google for it
currently.)

Sylvester II (999-1003). Sadly, the people who thought that an occasionally benevolent, omnipotent, elusive and unseen god made the world flat and the center of the universe also regarded much of his accrued knowledge as demonic, and of him a mystic, a wizard, a devil. So much for religious tolerance or sense of irony. You must be thinking of B.C. not A.D.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) The current pope had a big shindig celebrating Sylvester's millenial anniversary last year if I recall correctly.

Wow, I'm impressed. The benefits of a catholic education?

Yes sadly, had the Roman Catholic church just read the Bible they would have known their views were incorrect and spare a few people a nasty burn.

Yes, the Catholics did enjoy burning people...Joan of Arc, heretics, anyone who disagreed with them.....and reading was only for a chosen few so, maybe they should have stopped people from going to movies.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

In Arabic they're called "Hindu numbers".

Somewhere around here I have a (Modern) Mayan / English / Spanish dictionary where the pages are numbered in 1,2,... etc as wall as in
<a href="http://www.michielb.nl/maya/math.html" title="michielb.nl">Mayan
numerals</a michielb.nl>.  Altho I don't know if any modern Mayans can read those, or even if their languages
still count in base-20 at all.
