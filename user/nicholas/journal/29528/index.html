<p><p>I love employment agencies. I've had such fun with them before. Sometimes
I've managed to get them talking. I remember one saying</p>

<blockquote>Sometimes we have to fuck the employer. Sometimes we have to fuck
the candidate. Sometimes we have to fuck both.</blockquote>

<p>Another told me the ratios of 1st interviews, 2nd interviews, offers, and
acceptances she was supposed to get. I'm kicking myself for not writing them
down, but at each stage they were typically 5:1. It seems to be a policy of
fling enough ess-ache-one-tee and see what sticks, rather than make any real
attempt at trying to match people and positions.</p>

<p>Another recruiter made a comment about "having to pretend to be a Java
developer this afternoon" - I can only assume that he'd faked a CV and was
putting himself up for interview via some other agency in an attempt to find
out who the employer was and steal business. That same agent was the one who
got me a job. He cajoled me into starting in February, apparently because my
new employer wanted it. Only when I started they weren't really ready, and I
believe that they had agreed to February because they thought that I was
pressuring them. So I assume that the agent had a February target he wanted to
meet, and messed us both around.</p>

<p>Another agent from that same firm got me to go back for a second interview,
for a firm I was pretty sure wasn't me. She made it sound like they were keen
on me.  Only when I got there it turned out that they'd brought someone junior
in as the second interviewee, because they wanted him to benefit from our
chat. They had no intention of offering me the job - they knew it was too
limiting for me, but they too had been talked into a second interview by the
agent.</p>

<p>So you maybe you can see why I love them so much. I've met a few good,
honest agents, but I've met far more who are two faced, self serving greedy
opportunists. My experience doesn't seem to be atypical, and employers don't
seem to like agents much either. So why doesn't the free market sort this
out...</p>

<p>I believe I know what the problem is. Any conventional agent, for example an
estate agent selling your house, paid on a commission related to and deducted
from the sale price, is motivated to work in your interests, even if (perish
the thought) they were was driven purely by their own greed. You approach the
agent to start the business arrangement, their gain aligns with your gain, and
ultimately if they're not performing you can pull the plug on them and take
your business elsewhere. The interests of the agent and the agent's employer
align.</p>

<p>But "recruitment consultants" typically don't work like this. Their fee is
paid by the employer, as a (high) percentage of the starting salary. So their
interest is to maximise the salary to maximise the fee. But the employer's
interest is to minimise the salary. Contradiction. And in most cases employees
approach the agent, who then speculatively bombards employers. So unlike
selling the house, this isn't the case of the fee paying party approaching the
agent, which means means that the employee doesn't have the final clout of
"I'll take my business elsewhere then". So who is the "recruitment consultant"
working for? Not the employer, else they'd be trying to get the best staff at
the lowest salary. Not the employee, because the employee is just a pawn in
the game of getting paid. It's in their interests to be self-serving, and I
can't see how to resolve this, short of changing the system so that the
employee pays the fee, a change which feels like a non-starter, as where does
the employee find the money from?</p>

<p>So, with all that, it's time for me to find a new job. Oh joy.</p>

<h2>Agents</h2>

<i>Any conventional agent, for example an estate agent selling your house, paid on a commission related to and deducted from the sale price, is motivated to work in your interests, even if (perish the thought) they were was driven purely by their own greed.</i><br><br>You might be surprised. Although their interests are <i>closer</i> to being in line with yours, it's not all roses. In the US, the typical real estate agent commission is 6%, but that gets split a bunch of ways and they generally only take away about 1.5%. A $10,000 better sale on your house only makes them $150. So their main interest is getting you to take the first offer they think is reasonable, even if you could get $10k more by waiting a couple weeks. Fast turn-over pays them better.



<h2>Agents...!</h2>

<p>I could not agree more, recruitment-agents are parasites with little in common with either party.</p>

<p>However, I'd have to say that even estate agents, who you would think have an interest in selling property at the highest possible value are pretty useless too. That could be be because of the past few years it's been a sellers market in the UK - I should know as I'd like to buy. Now that it's a buyers market they are equally useless, only nothing is selling now...</p>
