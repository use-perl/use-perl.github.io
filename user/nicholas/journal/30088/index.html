<p><p>This morning I had the interesting experience of casting two votes in the same election. Totally legally, as I was proxy for both my parents.</p>
<p>There's a bye election in their consituency after the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4993000.stm">death of Eric Forth</a>.
This is the MP whose "arrival" in the consituency prompted me to <a href="http://use.perl.org/comments.pl?sid=9497&cid=14504">write this</a>. It was many years until he finally succumbed to pressure to actually <b>move</b> to the consituency that he "represented". Or at least buy a house - you never can really tell.</p><p>In theory Bromley &amp; Chislehurst is so Conservative that if you stuck a blue rosette on a turkey it would get elected as the MP, with the opposition votes split cleanly between Labour and Lib Dem. However, the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/5043528.stm">candidate chosen</a> could be a turn off, as he's another non-local candidate (albeit less non-local), he's pro European (an issue that visbily splits the Conservatives - Labour keep their splits well hidden), and if elected he's not intending to resign from his GLA job. So he might not do as well as might be expected, although I'd be surprised if he doesn't get in. It's more a question of the relative positions of the 3 main opposition candidates.</p></p>
