<p>Too right, it's confidential and priviledged :-) It's from my sister, and gives suggestions for what my brother-in-law and my niece might want for Christmas.</p>
<p>Actually, to fair, my niece is under 18 months, so I doubt that she's reading online journals yet, so it's safe to say that my sister suggests that my niece would be quite happy with odd safe items such as <cite>squeezy stress ball things, pine cones,        
cotton reels, anything shiny, things that make nice noises, things that go      
inside other things, brightly coloured plastic things etc</cite></p>
<p>Meanwhile my parents' dog is happy with any second-hand baby toy that has long ears or something else that makes it good to toss around, and I suspect that their cats don't mind, as long as it causes the small human not to bother them. Small human is not yet old enough to feed them or open doors, so what's the point of it?</p></p>
