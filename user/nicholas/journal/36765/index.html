<p><p>So, I need to pay rent. I don't have Internet banking set up, and go to the branch to ask them how best to transfer money from my account to my landlord's account, for which I know the account number and sort code...</p>
<p>Well, if I want to do it electronically over the counter, that will cost me ÃÂ£20. Of course, if I had Internet banking it would be free, so clearly it's the counter service that's costly. Only the helpful cashier is quite happy to spend 5 minutes looking up in a big book to verify that the sort code is <a href="http://www.smile.co.uk/">Smile</a>, and phoning up <a href="http://www.co-operativebank.co.uk/">The Co-operative Bank</a> (and getting passed upwards) to verify that they will accept a cash payment over the counter into a Smile account. (which they will). So then I make a cash withdrawal (over the counter, and over my cashcard limit) (again, not chargeable), and the first half is done.</p>
<p>So later on I head over to the The Co-operative Bank, where indeed they happily accept the cash deposit from me. I comment that it's crazy that my bank want to charge me ÃÂ£20 for this, that it's better to do the transfer with cash, and that <b>nothing</b> seems to have changed since I did this nearly 20 years ago.</p>
<p>"You need a new bank", she said.</p>
<p>"Mmm, yes, I do", I replied. "Do you have a leaflet?"</p>
<p>So she stepped out from behind the counter, found me a leaflet out front, and showed me the 4 options of current account detailed there. IIRC they would charge 
ÃÂ£0 for this sort of transfer (my favourite price).</p>
<p>Dear RBS, that ÃÂ£20 charge might be about to cost you an entire customer.</p>
<p><small>Oh the irony. They would only charge me <a href="http://www.rbs.co.uk/personal/travel/g1/making-payments/royworld-economy-euro.ashx">ÃÂ£10, half that price</a> to make a Euro transfer into an account in the eurozone, which means <b>international</b>. Yes, it's not same day, but I don't <b>need</b> same day here, dammit, and if that is a service you offer for free, it wasn't something that it ever crossed the mind of your chatty helpful counter staff to offer me.</small></p></p>

<h2>Banks...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ajt/">ajt</a> on 2008-06-24T16:47:41</h3>
<p><blockquote><div>A bank is a place that lends you an umbrella during fair weather then asks for it back when it rains. -Robert Frost.</div></blockquote>

<p>When I moved I sent a letter to everyone to let them know (at the last minute) that I was moving. One bank sent back a letter to say that they don't reply to letters on Internet accounts. Don't you just love banks...?</p>



<h2>Hopefully they've improved</h2>

I <a href="http://blog.brautaset.org/2004/03/13/banking-trouble/" title="brautaset.org">tried opening an account with the Cooperative bank</a brautaset.org> a few years ago, but after they lost my details a couple of times, directed me to a branch that don't exist, and sent me a letter saying they needed to still confirm my identity in response to somebody else's application I decided to drop the issue.



<h2>Try their internet branch</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/doop/">doop</a> on 2008-06-24T21:51:45</h3>
I opened an account with Smile about two and a half years ago, and they've been unfailingly helpful. And no, they don't charge for transfers either..



<h2>standing</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/quidity/">quidity</a> on 2008-06-25T22:17:39</h3>
Can't you set up a standing order?<br/><br/>And yes, it cost me less than GBP20 to transfer money to the antipode of my home branch, so something is clearly odd in the state of Scotland.

<h2>Re:standing</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/nicholas/">nicholas</a> on 2008-06-26T13:57:15</h3>
<p>Yes, I can set up a standing order once we have a regular amount and date. But right now I'm on a (very informal) short term agreement, with the option of going to something formal and long term if I like it, so right now payment isn't regular enough to have a standing order for it.</p>
<p>And yes, I agree that something is very wrong. I assume that a (regular UK bank clearing play with your money on the money markets rip-off) 3 day service exists. It's just that they don't want to offer me it over the counter. Hmm, maybe that's where the Underpants Gnomes got their plan from:</p>
<dl> <dt>Day 1</dt> <dd>Money leaves your account</dd>
<dt>Day 2</dt> <dd>???</dd>
<dt>Day 3</dt> <dd>Profit! <small>oops, how <i>did</i> that happen? We were just moving your money from A to B.</small> </dd>

<h2>Cash Cow</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/lilstevey/">lilstevey</a> on 2008-07-04T23:22:39</h3>
I've recently swapped banks myself.
<br> <br>
Very stupidly I agreed to a pay-for-banking-deal - it seemed like a good deal, cos I was applying for a mortgage at the time.<br/><br/><br> <br>
It was like ticking a box saying "rob me blind" I wouldn't be at all surprised if banks have a target list of fools who have accepted there rip-off deals and target for further abuse.<br/><br/><br> <br>
A little while later &pound;800 was wrongly charged to my account ( Apparently for a TV ). I had also been a mug and paid for "insurance" in case my card was lost or stolen.<br/><br/><br> <br>
I phoned up the helpline to report it. They said the bank would deal with it, and referred me. It took me weeks and weeks to get my money back - long after they had received a signed document from me expressing in writing that the transaction was nothing to do with me.<br/><br/><br> <br>
I can't at present remember the last phone call I had with them on the subject, but I was very forceful. The money was transferred very soon after.<br/><br/><br> <br>
A day later, I got a phone call from them, saying that another &#194;&#163;800 had been transferred to my account, and could they have the money back.<br/><br/><br> <br>
It took weeks of my inconvenience for them to benefit from me, but days ( if that ) for them to notice a mistake that cost them money.<br/><br/><br> <br>
A few other errors on their part later and I've since shifted my current account to the nationwide - who at the moment I'm very happy with.<br/><br/><br> <br>
There's some darn nice people working very hard in some branches - I used to have a good relationship with my branch until they closed it and moved banking to call centres, and even that recently, at one point I wrote a letter of compliment about one branches help for me with my previous bank, but at the end of the day I hold the belief that on an organisational level some of the big high street banks really don't appreciate whose money they are looking after.<br/><br/><br> <br>
With very little effort and inconvenience people can not only stop funding these corrupt institutions, but can also get a better deal for themselves by shopping around.<br/><br/><br> <br>
I respect you for finding  better deal -more people should do the same and show these people where their salary comes from.

<h2>That's one thing the US does right</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/btilly/">btilly</a> on 2008-07-10T16:56:45</h3>
<p>By law, the banks are liable for virtually any mistake.  If there is any question, then you get the benefit of the doubt, always.  Somebody stole your credit card and racked up a bill?  Their liability, not yours.</p><p>The result is that mistakes are fairly few and auditing for fraud is rather tight.  It also gives the banks a lot of incentives to get security right.  Because if they can't <i>prove</i> that it was you withdrawing money from the ATM, they lose.  Which means that things like having a security tape with a video of who money from your ATM is built into the system from the start.</p>
