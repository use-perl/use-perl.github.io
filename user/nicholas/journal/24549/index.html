<div class="span8">
<p><p>I recieved some virus scanner spam. The usual unhelpful, inaccurate bullshit about "might be infected" demonstrating that a product is, er, inept, by making a positive identification of a header forging worm, then mailing the address in that header...</p>
<p>So I replied, and after getting a bounce from the address it sent from, mailed postmaster. And for the first time, postmaster replied. So hurrah for siemens.com for employing clueful postmasters who hunt down and LART misconfigured scanners within their organisation. If only other companies had the same policy.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, people who write spamming software, especially when "sold" as virus scanners, should, well, be banned from using computer equipment more complex than a McDonald's till.</p></p>

<h2>not always the virusscanners</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/tannie/">tannie</a> on 2005-05-05T16:43:35</h3>
Just as a little note, generally it's not just the virusscanner that sends out the spam and such.
It can also be the mailserver. Yes, really<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)
Actually it's more or less the combo of two. Virusscanners are not mailservers etc, but do need to get along and work with eachother.<br/><br/>A general setup seems something like 'mailserver parsing mail to virusscanner before anything else'. The virusscanner then reports back 'hey, this has a virus' and depending on settings it'll remove the virus and put a note in it. The mailserver then sends out the mail anyway, cause hey, it's clean now right?<br/><br/>The best setup would ofcourse be "DELETE THE FREAKING E-MAIL AND BE DONE WITH IT!"<br/><br/>This is possible. I do it. I don't want virusses anywhere on my system and I sure as hell will refuse to send one back. (ok ok, getting carried away, it's my job, really I get so many complaints from people going ' I did not send this mail, why does it bounce back to me? ' cause so many postmasters still bounce virusmails and *refuse* to change that)
