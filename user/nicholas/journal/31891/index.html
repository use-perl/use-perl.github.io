<p>Muppets. If it's now discontinued, why does it appear in search results?</p></p>

<p>Generally sites do this so that visitors can differentiate between "This is definitely the item I wanted and now I know I can't buy it", and "I don't know whether this site just doesn't have the item I want, or whether their search system sucks so much that I just can't find it". </p>

<p>Finding the item and telling you it's no longer available so you can move on and look for something else (or try to find a different site where you can buy this) is very often the better result.</p>

<p>Of course, providing a way that you <i>could</i> buy it (even if just linking to an eBay search) would be even better.</p>

<p>OK. It's a fair cop. Although I'd like it better if the default search only showed available products, with a clear button to get everything else too. But I suspect that the counter to that is that this is confusing to some peopple. (In turn, most sites could do a lot to simplify the visual confusion of all their not-for-the-task-in-hand links and buttons first, rather than worrying about that.)</p>

<p>Still, it looks like they have other issues, with such gems as <cite>Results 0 - 12 of 13</cite> and <cite>Results 12 - 24 of 13</cite>. I wonder if a fencepost would do as clue by four<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>

<p>Hiding these results behind an extra button defeats the point of having them. Would you have repeated your search with &#8220;show me out-of-stock items&#8221;? I think the right approach would be to put a &#8220;permanently out of stock&#8221; marker right next to the link in the search results page.</p>
