<p><p>I drove to my parents last night. As I was driving round the <a href="http://www.streetmap.co.uk/newmap.srf?x=531666&y=173035&z=1&sv=531750,173250&st=4&ar=Y&mapp=newmap.srf&searchp=newsearch.srf&dn=658">Tulse Hill one way system</a> something suddenly turned on siren. This was a bit unsettling, as I was heading towards a crossroads at about 25mph with the lights green in my favour, and had no idea whether something was now about to cross it and potentially hit me. About half a second later I located the siren. It was on a police van proceding the <b>wrong way</b> round the one way system, about to go against the lights in conflict with me. <b>W.T.F. was it doing approaching the lights with its sirens off, only turning them on when it got close?</b> The only thing to their credit was that they were proceding cautiously (about 10-15mph), so weren't likely to collide with anything. But it doesn't inspire me with confidence.</p></p>

<h2>Two problems</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/drhyde/">drhyde</a> on 2004-08-12T15:28:28</h3>
This bring to light two problems.  The first is the obvious - the Met are a bunch of cunts.  The second is the the obnoxious wailing sirens that are all the rage now, having largely replaced the old two tone sirens, are a stupid idea in that it's far harder to tell what direction they're coming from than it was previously.
