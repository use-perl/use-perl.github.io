<p><p>We were having some fun at work, with TCP not doing what we expected. Strangely, it looks like (not confirmed) the Linux IP filter considers that a connection in <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=-btNds68w84C&pg=PA241&lpg=PP1&dq=tcp+illustrated+volume+1"><code>FIN_WAIT_2</code></a> isn't covered by "ESTABLISHED" <i>if</i> the connection is going via a router, but <i>is</i> if it's to a machine directly connected. I say "not confirmed" because it wasn't me checking this, and this makes no sense, as what does the IP stack know about routing - that's an Ethernet level thing, surely?</p>
<p>Anyway, as a side effect, it threw up this rather interesting snippet on <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=-btNds68w84C&pg=PA246&lpg=PP1&dq=tcp+illustrated+volume+1">page 246 of <i>TCP/IP Illustrated: The protocols</i></a></p>
<blockquote>To protect against this scenario, RFC 793 states that TCP should not create any connections for MSL seconds after rebooting. This is called the <i>quiet time</i>.
<blockquote>
Few implementations abide by this, as most hosts take longer than MSL seconds to reboot after a crash.
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>That's not true any more. Linux developers are working really hard to reduce the boot time. The goal is of the order of 5 seconds. That's much less than the Maximum Segment Lifetime, which the standard says is 120 seconds, but can be reduced.</p>
<p>So, is it exploitable? I wondered what mischief can one make by taking advantage of this...</p></p>
