<p><p>Possible new <code>$employer</code> decided that they wanted me to take the
Brainbench Perl 5.8 test. I feel that there has to be some irony when the test
asks about some change made in 5.8.6, and I find myself grepping to find the
answer in the very directory tree that I used to make the integration to 5.8.6
and the final release. (<code>/home/nick/p4perl/maint-5.8/perl</code> on
<code>saigo.etla.org</code>). No, I can't remember everything that goes into a
release, even if I did write about it at the time in the perldelta.</p></p>

Deep apologies from new $employer.<br><br>It became the unfortunate funny hallway anecdote about how process can be moronic.<br><br>On the other hand, name of prospective $employee spread like wildfire.<br><br>Henri

<p>There's no need to apologise. I find all this very funny, and laughed until
I coughed. It also seems to have been very effective at breaking the ice.</p>
<p> <small>Yes, I did think it slightly strange that I was being asked to do a
Perl test, but my two choices appeared to be "fight it" or "play along". It
seemed that "fight it" was at best break even, whereas "play along" was at
worst break even, which made the decision obvious.</small> </p>
