<div class="span8">
<p><p>In the UK the Post Office attempts to deliver letters to the addressee, not
just the address. One side effect of this is that you can re-write the address
on an unopened letter, stick it back in a letter box, and it will be forwarded
on.</p>
<p>This also seems to work for junk mail. I didn't like getting a deluge of
paper crap for umpteen former tenants of this property, so I systematically
sent it all back. Happily after about a couple of months it almost entirely
stopped.</p>
<p>But it hasn't all stopped, and in particular it seems that mail comes for
the previous person named on the electoral register. One piece has come franked
not by the Post Office, but by "UKMail Businesspost". Yes, mail delivery
deregulation now means that there are private operators sending junk mail too,
although I believe that currently they still use the Post Office's delivery
staff for that last mile of copper. (ish).</p>
<p>So I thought "right. What's the return address?" Then I thought "But I can't
put it in the letterbox, as it has no valid Post Office postage." Then I
thought "Why do I care? It doesn't get back to me once it goes in the letterbox,
and if the Post Office change the sender the standard cost for delivering
un-stamped mail, that's just fine by me. Puts the marketer's costs up. Might
reduce the flood slightly."</p></p>
