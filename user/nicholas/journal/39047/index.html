<p><p><a href="http://use.perl.org/user/spinne/">spinne</a> tells me that the German equivalent of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apples_and_oranges">"Apples and Oranges"</a> is "Apples and Pears".</p>
<p>"But that's not a good phrase," I replied. "Apples and pears are similar. They both grow in orchards, and both are used to make cider. Neither is true of oranges." I pointed at my booze supply*.</p>
<p>However, she makes the valid point in reply that "Apples and Pears" is arguably a better expression, because, yes, apples and pears <i>are</i> similar, but <i>similar</i>, <b>not</b> <i>directly comparable</i>.</p>
<p><small>* We have both kinds of booze here - apple cider <b>and</b> pear cider.

<h2>Apples and Pears on the same tree</h2>

<p>Apples and pears are sufficiently similar to be able to grown on the same tree once you have done the grafting magic. I think you are quite right you couldn't mistake an apple and an orange but you could mistake an apple and a pear.</p><p>Isn't pear cider actually called "perry" anyway...?</p>

<blockquote><div><p>Isn't pear cider actually called "perry" anyway...?</p></div></blockquote><p>Well, yes, I thought that too, but the box and bottles say "pear cider", so I thought I should quote it verbatim. I'm not sure if there's some incredibly subtle distinction between "perry" and "pear cider", or if it's simply Bulmers translating from English into <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estuary_English" title="wikipedia.org">Estuary</a wikipedia.org>, because that's more their target market.</p>

<p>Wackypedia suggests it's all just branding....</p><p>I'd suggest you try <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westons" title="wikipedia.org">H. Weston &amp; Sons'</a wikipedia.org> Premium Organic Pear Cider, very nice! Mind so you so is their (apple) cider so it's not a surprise. What was surprising was that it was cheaper than the mass produced <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulmers" title="wikipedia.org">Bulmer's</a wikipedia.org> stuff in the supermarket.</p>

<p>Just because it says something on the packaging doesn't mean it's true.  After all, if you believed that bullshit you'd live on tasty KFC for the rest of your life.

</p><p>The drink made from apples is cider.  The drink made from pears is perry.  "Pear cider" is cider with added pear juice.  To call something made without apples "pear cider" is to lie about its nature.</p>
