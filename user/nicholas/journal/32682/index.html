<p><p>It's somewhat confusing. I write the odd ramble here. Rarely does anyone

<h2>Long time listener....first time caller</h2>

I read almost every journal entry posted including yours.  I think the most noteable exception is TorgoX.  I don't typically reply because most comments to most journals would be "me too" or "that's interesting".  When there are specific requests made in a post that I might be able to help with, I do.<br><br>

<p>I miss <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/broquaint/journal/" title="perl.org">broquaint's
journal</a perl.org>. Well, to be pedantically correct, as it's clearly still there, I
guess I miss the fact that it used to get longer.</p>

<p>
If you assume that, you're wrong.
</p> <p><blockquote><div>Rarely does anyone comment.</div>

<p>
Maybe you're raising a too high rate of introspective reflection with the stuff you mentioned. And people here are so reserved they keep these intimate thoughts for themselves<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)

<h2>Readers vs commenters</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Aristotle/">Aristotle</a> on 2007-03-14T17:11:02</h3>
<p>Getting comments is always rare. You get more when you generate controversy or post technical inquiries that many people have something to say about. Otherwise, assume that for every one person leaving a comment, there are at least another 10 who read silently. The ratio is probably higher, in fact.</p>

<p>Personally, I see every single entry and comment posted to the journals here, by way of the newsfeeds. (I don&#8217;t <em>read</em> them all, but I still see them before deciding to skip.)</p>

Please bury your deposit in the back garden for further responses.

Clearly I'm not watching.

<p><div class="quote">Come to think of it, pretty much everyone that has moved away from use.perl I don't read their journals any more.</div>  <p>Yeah, I grab those people only in passing, infrequently, though now that I'm playing so much with Google Reader I might go out and subscribe.  To me the unified forum community system was always more attractive than a bunch of scattered blogs.</p>

<p><blockquote><div>Come to think of it, pretty much everyone that has moved away from use.perl I don't read their journals any more.</div></blockquote><br><br>Yeah, that's precisely why I "syndicate" my journal, which I consider to really live in Rubric at rjbs.manxome.org.  I get many more interesting people reading and commenting on it, here, and it's led to a few nice contacts, like people saying, "Hey, you're a Perl hacker in the Lehigh Valley?  When's beer?"
