<p><p><cite>There's no F in swearing</cite> said the sign in the pub for
Blackfriars. And it whilst it is right, I think I'd prefer it to be wrong.
Because Friday was a strange day.</p>
<p>So, for his 30th Birthday Bob decided to do a <a href="http://london.randomness.org.uk/wiki.cgi?Category_Circle_Line_Pub_Crawl_2007">Circle Line pub crawl</a>, but with class, by visiting Good Beer Guide pubs*. And for some reason I was
invited. And for some crazier reason I accepted the invitation, possibly
because it's not something I've ever done before. So we met at 10am at the
Fresh Pizza Co. in Victoria Station for "infinite bacon" (<i>i.e.</i> an all
you can eat breakfast buffet) and by 11am we were clawing at the door of the
first pub, the <a href="http://london.randomness.org.uk/wiki.cgi?Cask_And_Glass,_SW1E_5HN">Cask and Glass</a>, for our first drink, in this
case "Late Red" by Shepherd Neame. 15 minutes later we were in the
<a href="http://london.randomness.org.uk/wiki.cgi?Buckingham_Arms,_SW1H_9EU">
Buckingham Arms</a>, where we rapidly discovered that allowing people to have
different bitters was not a good plan, as it caused confusion and dithering.</p>
<p>And so the day progressed. <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/kake_pugh/sets/72157602529212328/">Kake</a> and <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/rjw1/sets/72157602564222147/">Bob</a> took photos. In the <a href="http://london.randomness.org.uk/wiki.cgi?Ship_And_Shovell,_WC2N_5PH">Ship and Shovell</a>
Bob decided to <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/rjw1/1632815071/in/set-72157602564222147/">add a touch of satire to my t-shirt</a>, which stayed on it for the rest of the day. Apparently I was a bad thing for buying a round of the
Grand Union Honey Porter at <a href="http://london.randomness.org.uk/wiki.cgi?Metropolitan,_NW1_5LA">Baker Street</a>, but it was by far the
nicest looking thing on offer. But despite my attempt at sabotage, by 11pm we completed our circuit at the
<a href="http://london.randomness.org.uk/wiki.cgi?Duke_Of_Wellington,_SW1W_8TR">Duke of Wellington</a>. I've done it now. I don't feel any great desire to do it
again. At least not soon.</p>

<p><small>* Where possible. However, Great Portland Street and Gloucester Road
proved too much. For the former, Adam's itinerary said <cite>http://www.beerintheevening.com/pubs/s/21/2181/Smugglers_Tavern/Warren_Street ( *** Not GBG - It's a desert around there - SUGGESTIONS WELCOME *** )</cite></small></p>
