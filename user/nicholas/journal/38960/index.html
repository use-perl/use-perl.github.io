<p><p>Hindsight is 20:20. I'm not sure if it's fair to say that back in <a href="http://www.spectator.co.uk/coffeehouse/3608466/the-campaign-to-ditch-speaker-martin-gathers-pace.thtml">2001 when Freedom of Information legislation was passed, it was clear this juggernaught was coming down the track</a>, but it <b>is</b> clear back in 2005 that <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/leader-of-scots-tories-quits-after-row-over-taxi-expenses-513470.html">expenses can sink you</a>. (in that case, the Scottish Conservatives' <i>leader</i>. *)</p>
<blockquote>This may look like a Tory initiative, but disgust at whatÃ¢â¬â¢s been going on is spread across all parties. I also think it's significant that the 2005 intake are taking the lead here: the world has changed, Westminster hasn't, and this is clearer to some MPs than others. I draw a division across all parties: good (who are disgusted) the bad (who know it's bad, but don't want to rock the boat) and the ugly (Margaret Moran and Derek Conway). It's time we heard more from the good.</blockquote>
<p>So, yes, I'm wondering, who are the honourable honourable members? Is it just <a href="http://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/richard_taylor/wyre_forest">Dr Richard Taylor</a>?</p>
<p><small>* Hmm, progress of sorts for them. Scottish Conservative<b>s'</b> rather than <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_2001">Scottish Conservative<b>'s</b></a></small></p></p>

<p>Yes, I had noticed this. I was pleased. I'm not sure what I'd do in a similar position - I don't like commuting long distances, so I'd want somewhere in London. But I like my own bed, and I'm not convinced that "my bed" and "my other bed" fits my mental model of "my own bed".</p><p>Also, I'm not sure that I'm pleased that I have a good MP, and no cause to <a href="http://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/david_howarth/cambridge" title="theyworkforyou.com">write to him</a theyworkforyou.com> to express my (self)righteous indignation, or disappointed that I don't have a <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/mps-expenses/5305166/Margaret-Moran-claims-were-necessary-MPs-expenses.html" title="telegraph.co.uk">complete</a telegraph.co.uk> <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/mps-expenses/5311182/Margaret-Moran-to-pay-back-money-for-shared-home-MPs-expenses.html" title="telegraph.co.uk">hypocrite</a telegraph.co.uk> who can  U-turn her convictions within 24 hours, in the hope that she'll be re-electable, and therefore someone I can write to in disgust, and actively not vote for next time.</p>
