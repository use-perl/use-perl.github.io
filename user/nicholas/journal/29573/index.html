<div class="span8">
<p><p>Today was a great day for dandelions, or more specifically the next
generation of dandelions. This follows on from last Tuesday, which was a great
day for dandelions - for some reason thousands of them decided to come into
flower in the local park all on the same day. Hence today there are thousands
of seed heads.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Friday may not be such a great day for dandelions. My neighbour
moves out, and hopefully before the new owners move in, I can reprise my role
as "nemesis of dandelions" and eliminate hers from her front garden. Then again.
"nemesis of dandelions" wonders if he's fighting a losing battle, particularly
given the overwhelming forces stationed just ÃÂ¼ mile away as the seed head
drifts.</p></p>

<h2>Salad!</h2>

There were loads in Hamburg this weekend too. Get the young leaves (so they are less bitter) and make a nice salad out of them!

<p>Um, I don't think so. Certainly not with the ones from the park. I know where
they've been.</p>
<p>Well, to be pedantic, they've not "been" anywhere else, but I know what's
"been" on or near them.  I'm not convinced that dog (and fox) urine and faces
are the most appealing salad marinades, even if thoroughly washed off in my
kitchen.</p>

Well, just imagine that the dandelions have been organically grown and cultivated.  That might help the taste.  I also suggest a balsamic vinegar since it has a stronger flavor than the typical red wine table vinegar.
