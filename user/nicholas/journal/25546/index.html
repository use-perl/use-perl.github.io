<p><p>Gah. It's <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/front_page/4655555.stm">all gone horribly wrong</a>. This is Britain. Winning just isn't the done thing. :-)</p>
<p>Maybe it's time to leave the country for the next 7 years, until all the dust has settled and the whole thing has been paid for. Mmm. Maybe I'm being optimistic on that "paid for" bit.</p></p>

<p>Possibly more interesting than the story itself is <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/olympics_2012/4618507.stm" title="bbc.co.uk">the BBC's analysis of what the bid did right to be successful</a bbc.co.uk> </p>



<h2>Salons take on it</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/sky/">sky</a> on 2005-07-06T20:37:12</h3>
<p>I like Salons take on London winning.</p>

<p> <cite>"London's bid, seriously, was built around using the Games as the centerpiece for development in Stratford in East London, which fell on hard times in the Middle Ages and just hasn't been able to get on its feet. "</cite> </p>

His comment about British and Finnish food probably pissed off the last nerve the committee had for France and just decided to fuck it all and leave it to London. Personally, I think whomever thought London would be a great place for a billion people to visit was completely bonkers but...oh well, I guess the East End will get a bit of business and sprucing up for the tourists.
