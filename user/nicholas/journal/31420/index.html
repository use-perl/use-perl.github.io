<p><p>On Saturday I popped into Waitrose and noticed that they have some rather nice offers on rather nice beer. So tonight I took the car round and relieved them of some of it. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/34063820@N00/279364024/">Food ÃÂ£5.23, beer ÃÂ£38.58</a>. This will last me quite a while, and <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/nicholas/journal/25793">for all their good points</a>, Somerfield are no longer doing 4 for ÃÂ£5. The manager happened to be near the checkout as I was unloading my trolley, and I complemented her on their disappointingly good stock control - as you can see I had only found one reduced to clear item that I liked*. To add that finishing touch, the checkout operator was under 18, so had to ask for clearance before scanning the alchohol.</p>
<p>It's ages since I've seen Bishop's Finger on special offer. Mmm. Once upon a time (it was alledged that) Shepherd Neame exported half of their entire production to France, just so that we could go over there for day trips and buy it back, only at prices with French duty rather than UK duty. Well, the EU is a free market - what do you expect? :-)</p>

<p><small>* In particular, my most favourite of all item, reduced price venison sausages, wasn't even around in its full price variant.</small></p></p>
