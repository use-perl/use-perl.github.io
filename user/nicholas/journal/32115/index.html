<p><p>I was chatting to a friend on the phone last night, and she said that she's
received two letters now, from Spain, real stamps, typewritten envelopes and
all, congratulating her on her recent win in the Spanish lottery. 600,000 Euros,
and twice now - how lucky she is. Obviously, they instruct her to keep her
good fortune a secret, and include a form for her to send bank details.</p>
<p>I didn't think that 419ers were sending letters any more. Certainly, I've
never had one. We're also unsure as to where they got her address from - hers
is less trawlable online than an address for me, but she is an admin contact
on an <code>.org.uk</code> domain whereas I am not, so perhaps they are mining
that.</p></p>
