<p><b>This</b> is why people are angry:</p>

<blockquote>Jacqui Smith, the home secretary, was hauled over the coals by members of the Police Federation of England and Wales.</blockquote>

<blockquote>She was forced to defend expenses and allowances for all public servants, saying they were necessary for them to work effectively.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Steve Morley of the Metropolitan police questioned why so many police allowances, from dry cleaning to extra cash for working on rest days, had been dropped.</blockquote>

<blockquote>He said: "Home secretary, can you explain for the benefit of my members, your electorate, why all our expenses and allowances have been taken away?"</blockquote>

<blockquote>Morley added that some claims by MPs would be "jaw-dropping in a third-world dictatorship let alone in the country of hope and glory".</blockquote>

<p>The police have received a lot of formal complaints (<a href="http://news.scotsman.com/latestnews/Police-asked-to--.5259783.jp">one example</a>) - maybe they are sufficiently pissed off that they <b>will</b> investigate. Certainly the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2009/may/10/mps-expenses-capital-gains-tax">old ones have awakend from their slumber</a>, but that won't get public. Well, maybe they will - after all <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7103828.stm">HMRC has a record to live up to.</a></p></p>
