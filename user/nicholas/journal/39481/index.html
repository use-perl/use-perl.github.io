<p><p>So, Oxford Airport is now <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/oxfordshire/8205130.stm">"London" Oxford</a>. Who are they kidding?
<p>Although at least it's not "London" Lydd Airport, now "Ashford" something-or-other. I can't find a picture of the home made "London" sign at the exit, but <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/92566565@N00/476432536">here's one of the rail link</a>. Then again, I'm surprised that Ryanair don't start moving their services there, what with their continuing desire to <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/8205445.stm">get something for nothing</a>.</p>

<p>I think <a href="http://blog.fsck.com/">Jesse</a> nicely summed the whole game up on <a href="http://london.pm.org/about/irc.html">IRC</a>:</p>

<p>Maybe they are attempting to get the geographically challenged American market?</p>

<h2>&quot;Ballina/Byron Airport&quot;</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Alias/">Alias</a> on 2009-08-18T00:42:09</h3>
<p>Near the town where I grew up there are two seaside towns about half an hour drive from each other.</p><p>One is called Ballina. It is like a mid-sized regular country town centre that just happens to be on the coast. It has beaches, and an inlet, and fishing, and boating, and so on.</p><p>Because it's a regular country town, it also has a regional airport and a small industrial/business area.</p><p>The other is called Byron Bay. It's a smaller town with an aggressively anti-development council and a hippy vibe. It also has a huge world-quality beach right at the point that the main street reaches the coast, and it sits at the most easterly point in Australia so it has a quite pretty lighthouse, and a small ship-wreck at one end of the beach.</p><p>And of course, due to the wildly divergent supply and demand it has become hugely popular with Sydney people as a "get away from the hustle bustle" holiday destination and turned into a millionaire's playground.</p><p>Being (literally at times) violently anti-development there was no way it was EVER going to get an airport. And so, of course, a few years ago Ballina airport changed name to "Ballina/Byron Airport".</p>

perversely I can get to my new employer's office in Halifax, Yorkshire for 9am from my home near Truro, but not anywhere in central london...although it does mean getting out of bed at 5am.
