<h2>Why?</h2>

None of the changes are significant.  The new FSF mailing address?  Removing "19yy" as the template for the year?  I don't get it.

<p>I agree that they're not significant changes. But I don't like the fact
that they have made changes to the document <i>without</i> any of

</p><ul>
<li>noting in the document that changes have been made</li>
<li>changing the version number of the document</li>
<li>serving the document from a different URL</li>
</ul>

It may well be administrative oversight, but I'm not comfortable with a system
that lets the public master copy of one of the most important documents on the
Internet get changed, without any clear indication that it's been changed.

<p>These changes are minor and innocent. But if minor innocent changes can
slip by, so, potentially, can minor less-than-innocent changes.</p>

It is very nice of them to tell me how to do this:<br><br>
&nbsp; If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this<br>when it starts in an interactive mode:<br><br>-    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19yy name of author<br>+    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author<br>
