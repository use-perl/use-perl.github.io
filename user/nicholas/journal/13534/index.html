<div class="span8">
<p><p>Our department's secretary/adminstrator/organiser is very cagey about handing out drawing pins. Hence they are usually in short supply, and if we want to pin escape plans^W^W things up on our cell^Wcubicle walls we either have to grovel profusely to get half a drawing pin, or raid it from the corners of someone else's pinnings. However, she's on holiday this week, and there's a temp in to do her job. (She's obviously the most important person in the department, as she's the only one who has holiday cover brought in)</p>
<p>Anyway, we needed some drawing pins, and we'd run of spare corners to steal them from. Rob, my co-worker had a brainwave - "Go ask the new secretary for some drawing pins - she won't realise that she's not supposed to give them out"</p>
<p>So I visit her</p>
<p>Me: Can I have some drawing pins please?</p>
<p>Her: Yes, how many would you like?</p>
<p>Me: We're a bit short, could I have half a dozen please</p>
<p>She opens the treasure cupboard, and pours herself a handful out from a box, which she hands to me.</p>
<p>When I get back to my desk I count <b>thirty</b>. Woohoo! Where am I going to hide these? I notice the piece of paper which is pinned across an annoying eye level crack in my cubicle wall - I'll pin them up behind it. So I lift it up, and Lo! There are already five drawing pins pinned there, which I'd concealled and forgotten about.</p>
<p>Happy now.</p>
