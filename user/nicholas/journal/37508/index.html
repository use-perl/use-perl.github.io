<p><p>Dear lazyweb...</p>
<p>So we have in our possession a Belkin <code>F5D7632-4</code> and a Netgear <code>wnr834b</code> (ie <code>wnr834b<b>v1</b></code>). The Belkin is an ADSL modem/wireless base station/4 port switch. The Netgear is just a wireless base station and 4 port switch. Right now the Belkin is doing perfectly fine delivering Internet to wireless enabled machines.</p>
<p>However, what we also have are some computers in a room that doesn't have a phone extension. Hence we'd like to find a way to use the two wireless devices to bring the Internet from the phone socket to the Ethernet. It seems logical that the Belkin needs to stay attached to the phone line :-) So is there a way to get the Netgear to change its behaviour from "I talk upstream over that Ethernet port, and NAT it downstream over wireless and those 4 Ethernet ports" to "I talk upstream over wireless, and NAT* it downstream over those 4 Ethernet ports"? The Internet doesn't seem to be clear on this (and Netgear's own manual is not the most useful here).</p>
<p>It's proving remarkably hard to search for appropriate clue, because it's not obvious what the correct terms for this are, and even when some are (such as sources of Linux firmware for the routers) the level of "noise" from Google swamps any signal.</p>
<p>Note that I'm really not a sysadmin, nor a hardware person. I can melt regular DIN connectors with a soldering iron just fine. Mini-DINs would stand no chance, so fancy stuff isn't going to fly.</p>
<p><small>* doesn't have to be NAT. Bridging from wireless to Ethernet would work just as well</small></p></p>

<h2>Use a Linux-able WAP?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/autarch/">autarch</a> on 2008-09-22T13:36:16</h3>
<p>If you get one of those WAPs that can be updated with a Linux-on-WAP thing, I'm sure you could do this. Check out OpenWRT and Tomato. Both run on a Linksys WRT54GL.</p>



<h2>Repeater</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Phred/">Phred</a> on 2008-09-22T20:18:24</h3>
<p>If you can flash one of those devices with OpenWRT then this link may help you - <a href="http://wiki.openwrt.org/Repeater" title="openwrt.org">http://wiki.openwrt.org/Repeater</a openwrt.org> </p>



<h2>Wireless bridge?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/speters/">speters</a> on 2008-09-25T21:18:45</h3>
I had a similar problem that I solved with a Wireless Bridge (Linksys WET54GS5).  It has four ethernet ports and NATs from the router.  Very slick and much more stable that the Belkin USB Wireless adapter that the old iMac had been using.
