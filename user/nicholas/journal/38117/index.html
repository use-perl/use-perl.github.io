<p><p>In a very long article, The Register relates how <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/12/16/adobe_open_source_flex/">Adobe learns lessons of open-source Flex</a></p>
<blockquote>Matt Chotin, Flex senior product manager, said one hurdle is getting people in the community to back up ideas and suggestions for Flex with actual code submissions. [...] "There are plenty who say casually they want something but don't want to get an account," Chotin said. [...] "We have a very active Flex community...but getting people to the point where they aren't just sending an idea without anything backing it up is difficult - any idea is OK as long as there's code with it," Chotin said. "We are still trying to figure how to get the community and companies to say: 'This is an important change to make and I want to make this contribution,'" Chotin added.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Chotin conceded one thing Adobe could have done better before taking Flex open source was to research how other open-source projects work. This could have informed how the Flex project had been set up and helped improve the way things are being done.</blockquote>
<blockquote>So was it worth going open source? The majority of the costs Adobe has - and continues to incur - from taking Flex open source come in time - the number of people hours involved in working through submitted fixes, for example. Chotin claimed he could not put an actual dollar amount on the work.</blockquote>

<p>Sorry to dissapoint you, Matt Chotin, but you're not doing that much wrong. Certainly, it's happening much like open source projects I know about. And the code review problem is the same problem the perl core has.</p></p>

<p>Given the way p5p treats some code submissions, I can proffer a somewhat different explanation.</p>
