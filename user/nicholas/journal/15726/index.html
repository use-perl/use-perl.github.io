<p><p>I got e-mailed by a recruitment consultant today, who had found my CV on google, and was wondering if I was available to fill a senior perl position. I replied to say that I was not looking, but also asked if he was aware of <a href="http://jobs.perl.org/">jobs.perl.org</a>, which might be of use to him.
No he wasn't aware, but he will take a look. Hopefully this will be another person helping concentrate perl job ads into easy to find place.</p>
<p>I think it would be good if as many people as possible were able to encourage employers and recruiters to use <a href="http://jobs.perl.org/">the perl jobs site</a>. If your looking for a perl job, it certainly beats having to wade through all the reposted crud at the regular unfiltered job <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=midden">middens</a>.</p></p>

<h2>jobs.perl.org++</h2>

<p>All I can say is that we got a jolly good person, via jobs.perl.org, even the people we didn't hire were good.</p>

<p>On the whole, recruiters are mostly useless. I'm quite happy to pay some one who can find quality candidates for a job, but they usually can't. We did get the odd good CV, and they would have probably been good at the job, but the vast majority were inappropiate for the job.</p>

<p>What really scares me is that I got jobs that I've been/am happy with. I'm amazed it is possible to ever match up jobs with people!</p>



<h2>people are using it more and more ...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ask/">ask</a> on 2003-11-14T03:27:15</h3>
at least <a href="http://jobs.perl.org/about/stats" title="perl.org">the stats</a perl.org> are looking busier and busier.  I really should make stats of the web traffic as well.<br> <br>I also added a few more "cool names" to the "companies using jobs.perl.org" list on the front page.<br> <br>
