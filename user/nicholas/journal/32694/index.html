<p><p>So I was standing in the park in the sun looking at the stream* and I had a
series of thoughts. It's not yet a
<a href=http://use.perl.org/user/nicholas/journal/29573">great day for dandelions</a>, but it does seem to be a good day for small blue beetles (and probably a feast day for anything
that eats small blue beetles). It's also somewhere in between a great day for
frogspawn and a great day for tadpoles.</p>
<p>Anyway, digression. they probably started with the fact that the stream
itself is in a somewhat arbitrary state of escaping its way from
<a href="http://www.therrc.co.uk/case_studies1.php?csid=32">artificial
naturalisation</a>. In particular, it's getting some way towards fighting out
from the meanders that were laid down for it, and imposing its own route.
So I seemed to be wondering, where is the line between artificial and natural?
Is a coppiced woodland natural? Or artificial. Not sure. In fact, it seems
that according to the <a href="http://www.answers.com/artificial&amp;r=67">
definition of artificial</a>, "natural language" is itself artificial. Hmm.
Thinking is hard.</p>
<p><small>* This is more fun than finding Storable backwards compatibility
bugs or chasing down MAD failures.</small></p></p>

It's good to know that the pumpking has philosophical thoughts.<br><br>I conclude, the artificial-natural distinction is an artificial, not a natural, distinction.
