<p><p>So Kake wrote that <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/rglondon/55067.html">RGL now does OpenStreetMap links</a>. So I went to look at OpenStreetMap, for some reason ended up zooming in on Alperton, near where I used to work, and found something to be not quite right. At which point, of course, OpenStreetMap's servers decided to go down for an upgrade, before I could write this. So here goes...</p>
<p>If you <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/?lat=51.53601&lon=-0.29349&zoom=16&layers=B000FTF">zoom in here on the River Brent</a>, where the Picadilly Line crosses it, you'll see Riverside Gardens, Queensbury Road, and Park Avenue. But you won't see any route mapped connecting them. Which is a shame, because there is a path from Riverside Gardens to Queensbury Road, and a footbridge from there to Park Avenue, <a href="http://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&ll=51.53538,-0.291674&spn=0.000838,0.003178&t=h&z=19">as can be seen on Google Maps</a>. I rather liked that bridge - I used to think of it as the <i>Bridge over the River Brent</i>, and walk to it in my lunchbreaks when I wanted to get away from the office, and let my mind wander and unwind. Such an exotic and beautiful location... ah the memories.</p>
<p>So if there's anyone in the area with a GPS, please could they fix this. In particular, have fun working out which is the official route of the footpath on the south side of the bridge.</p></p>

<p>if you know the path well enough to trace it from yahoo imagery, you gan create an osm id and add it without using a GPS. Is is purlely a footpath or a bikepath by intent?  My GPS is too far from London, and I do not know it so shalln't trace it. Meantime I have marked it on <a href="http://openstreetbugs.appspot.com/?lat=51.53601&amp;lon=-0.29349&amp;zoom=16" title="appspot.com">http://openstreetbugs.appspot.com/?lat=51.53601&amp;lon=-0.29349&amp;zoom=16</a appspot.com> where a local may find it and fi  it.</p><p>Bill in Boston</p>

<p>It's over 5 years since I've been there, and I have no idea if it's a footpath only, or <a href="http://www.naturenet.net/row/rowdefinitions.html" title="naturenet.net">some form of path</a naturenet.net> where bikes are allowed. So, I don't feel qualified to trace it out. In particular, as I alluded to, the route south of the bridge is ambiguous, and likely exactly one of the two possible choices is legally designated the path.</p>

<p>right. well, we've marked it for the locals on the bug map.  either the bike-mappers or urban ramblers will pick it up.</p><p>(we'll be talking OSM at Boston.PM's September meeting.)</p><p>feel free to trace anything missing where you travel currently,</p><p>bill</p>
