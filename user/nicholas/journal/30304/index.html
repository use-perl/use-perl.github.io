<p><p>I've just listened to <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio/aod/radio4_aod.shtml?radio4/nowshow">this week's Now Show</a> [beware. that link will become next weeks' Now Show around the 21st July]. The first of Mitch Benn's satirical songs* was about Zinedine Zidane, and was entirely in French, without translation. I'm not aware of any other UK radio station that assumes that its audience is savvy enough that this sort of thing will just work. It reminds me of another non-lowest common denominator sketch they did some time ago - the Impressionist driving test. Sadly I can't find any reference to that online.</p>

Thankfully, the downloadable podcast contained that one.  I have no idea at all why they decided to cut the song about Prescott and Brokeback mountain however.

<p>I'm so grateful the BBC are doing podcasts though.  It's so much more convenient than "Listen Again"...

Hiya, have you got the 14Jul06 podcast saved? A fellow English teacher wants to listen to it and I'm trying to help. If you got it, I'll appreciate it if you could upload it up to a free server and paste the link here. Thanks in advance.<br/><br/>Sryn

<p>Share &amp; Enjoy!

<p>Do they stream to the British Antartic Territory? (If yes, is that because the BBC actually have the rights, or merely because they don't realise that your IP addresses aren't actually located where they think you are?)</p>

<p>One thing that amused me in LA was that there were people there who would happily pay the licence fee, if they could get the UK BBC channels out there. It's a shame that all the licensing complexity means that this will never happen, depriving auntie of potential revenue to spend on more programs (or Chris Moyles). Meanwhile, our friends in LA get their Top Gear fix via Bittorrent, because they have no other way.</p>
