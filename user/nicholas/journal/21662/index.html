<p><p>So, there is good news. And bad news</p>

<dl><dt>Good news</dt><dd>The plumber came on Monday. In fact, it was reported that at one point there was a second workman present, and the sound of drilling. The plumber worked late, and only left at 8pm, having finished the days work by leaving the bathroom more tidy than we usually manage. I thanked him for keeping it clean. They worked worked hard - the shower tray is in (atop the piece of plywood, atop new floorboards), and new plaster has been applied between it and the walls, to set it firmly in. On Monday I was hopeful that this would mean tiling on Tuesday, grouting on Wednesday, drying on Thursday (and maybe Friday) and functional shower by the weekend.</dd>
<dt>Bad news</dt><dd>Today, little happend on the work front. Tiles arrived. Plaster dried. T<small>HE</small> E<small>ND</small>.</dd>
<dt>Ugly news</dt><dd>Jo [the agent] escorted someone round the kitchen. Verdict is that the <strong>whole kitchen ceiling</strong> will have to come down. Great. I have no idea how long this job will take (estimate versus reality), nor whether the kitchen will be remotely useable in this time. I'm not convinced that I want to live through this. Neither is (at least) one of my housemates. However, most excellent timing, as we can only give notice on the first of a month. So if we do decide to abandon the sinking ship, we can't give notice until 1st December, and pay up to 1st January.</dd></dl></p>

<h2>Giving notice</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/drhyde/">drhyde</a> on 2004-11-03T09:54:50</h3>
You can only give notice on the first of the month?  Sounds like some suit is bullshitting you.  The standard contract says you have to give one calendar month's notice, but not when in the month you can give it.

<p>Of course, you could just stop paying rent immediately and just move out.  Or you could mutter at your local council's housing department about how shite your landlord is.  They enjoy that sort of thing.</p>



<h2>A Similar-ish Tale</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Smylers/">Smylers</a> on 2004-11-03T18:40:12</h3>
<p>There was <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/property/main.jhtml?xml=/property/2004/11/03/phell03.xml" title="telegraph.co.uk">another bathroom tale of woe</a telegraph.co.uk> in <cite>The Sunday Telegraph</cite> (but not published online till today).  The victims there were to some extent asking for it (they were attempting some kind of upgrade, not just having maintenance done), but still it wasn't their fault that their back-up system failed too:</p>

<blockquote><div>I had been showering at the gym for the past month, which was tolerable<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... until the gym burned down. That was the last straw.</div></blockquote>
