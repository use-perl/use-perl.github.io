<p><p><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/comedy/clue.shtml">I'm Sorry I Haven't A Clue</a> is back. This is good.</p>
<p>This week's was very good. This is very good. Althought the quality of the recording streamed from the website wasn't so good - it seemed to have tinny artefacts of some sort. I need to be in in time to listen to it on real FM. Bugger this digital malarky - they can't skimp on the bandwidth for analogue (TV or Radio, by compressing it excessively to squeeze more in) so analogue ends up sounding so much better. Then again, I might be biased (or at least blessed with a strong signal), living within 10 miles of a 1MW transmitter.</p></p>

<h2>Radio4 Streaming Quality</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Dom2/">Dom2</a> on 2005-11-15T07:00:20</h3>
I'm glad I'm not the only one who can't get along with streamed radio 4.  It's quite ridiculous that the sounds quality is so bad -- and I'm not even a hi-fi person.  I tend to sit at my computer listening to the radio on my phone (which has an FM receiver) instead of using that convenient broadband connection.  Insane.

<p>But anyway, <em>I'm sorry I haven't a clue</em> being on again is definitely a Good Thing.

<h2>Maybe World Service will pick it up</h2>

I've heard of this, especially Mornington Crescent, but never heard it. (I do enjoy the other less absurd panel games on BBC World Service on both FM and SW, such as Just a Minute and My Word.)   I suppose BBC4 is probably on XM or Sirius, but paying for broadcast just doesn't seem right.

<p>Beware of confusion. <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcfour/" title="bbc.co.uk">BBC4</a bbc.co.uk> is just another recent BBC TV channel. <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/" title="bbc.co.uk">(BBC) Radio 4</a bbc.co.uk> isn't just another anything. The BBC already <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio/aod/radio4.shtml?fm" title="bbc.co.uk">streams Radio 4</a bbc.co.uk> (or at least the programmes it has the appropriate rights for), and you can listen to the most recent episodes of various programmes for the week after transmission. So this case you want <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio/aod/radio4_aod.shtml?radio4/clue" title="bbc.co.uk">http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio/aod/radio4_aod.shtml?radio4/clue</a bbc.co.uk> </p>
<p>The world service has had over 30 years to pick it up - if it hasn't yet, I doubt that it ever will.</p>

(BBC) Radio 4, right. I so rarely have anything to do with BBC TV I forget about Compulsory License Fees and the fact that BBC finally has more than one TV channel.
