<p><p>So, we're in the lift here in Shopzilla's HQ in Santa Monica slightly after office hours, and we want to go down from floor 4 to floor 3 to meet someone. Can we? Can we heck. It seems that after hours the lifts enter "happy vertical people transporter" mode. The lift ignores any pushes for the button for floor 3. There's a card reader for the internal doors that's supposed to enable "up", but it doesn't recognise the temporary visitor pass as valid for up. The lift lets us go to the ground floor. But then we can't go back up. So we are forced to consider the possibilities that down has to offer (the lobby, and the basement parking levels), and how on earth we contact the person to explain where we are. The stairs aren't any help as they have one way doors that only let you go down to the ground floor. We solve the problem by staying in the lift waiting to be summoned (1 in 3 chance) and get back somehow. But on floor 3 we can't even get te lift to register the idea of going to floor 3, let alone up to floor 4. I forgot how it all got solved. Maybe the lifts would be more co-operative in future if <a href="http://www.powells.com/biblio?isbn=080852450x">I read them a story</a>.</p>
<p>But on the up side, they have tea.</p></p>
