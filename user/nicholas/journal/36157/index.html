<p><p>I've discovered a European language that is even more confusing to pronounce than <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welsh_language">Welsh</a> (<a href="http://cy.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cymraeg">Cymraeg</a>) - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatian_language">Croatian</a> (<a href="http://hr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hrvatski">Hrvatski</a>)</p>
<p>Welsh only has the appearance of "hunt-the-vowel" - for example</p>
<dl><dt>cwm</dt><dd>valley</dd></dl>
<p>but once you know that <i>w</i> is a vowel in Welsh (with a <i>u</i> sound) you're sorted.</p>
<p>Whereas it turns out that Croatian has entire syllables without vowels. There's one above - <i>Hrv</i> has a rolled <i>r</i> in place of a vowel. Wah!</p></p>

<h2>Add two more</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/speters/">speters</a> on 2008-04-15T13:34:58</h3>
Since Serbo-croatian (srpskohrvatski) doesn't technically exist any more, just add Serbian (srpski) and Bosnian (bosanski) to your list.  Serbian gets a leg up for me since it has both Cyrillic and Latin alphabets with differing sort orders.  For example, the Cyrillic &#x428; is equivalent to the Latin &Scaron;, but &#x428; is at the end of the Cyrillic alphabet while &Scaron; comes in just after S.  That must certainly make SQL "order by" statements fun and exciting.



<h2>syllabic r</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/slanning/">slanning</a> on 2008-04-15T13:37:58</h3>
<p>I guess the 'r' acts as a syllable itself, though. "errrrrh"</p>
<p>I wonder what all in English is difficult for non-English speakers. I'm sure the 'r' sound is, for one, as that seems to differ in a lot of languages (English (even American vs. British can be different), French (who sometimes approximate English 'r' with a 'w'), German (trills), Spanish (like a soft 'd'), Czech ("rzh" as in Dvorak), Chinese (a mixture of l and r) that I can think of all have different 'r' sounds).</p>

<p><blockquote> <div><i>German (trills)</i></div> </blockquote>Rather guttural [&#640;] most of the time, or [&#592;] at the end of syllables. Russian's got trills.<p><blockquote> <div><i>Chinese (a mixture of l and r)</i></div> </blockquote>r in Standard Chinese is not like l at all. It is pronounced like [&#635;], or sometimes [&#656;] at the beginning of a syllable, and has to be carefully learned.

Re: Chinese (a mixture of l and r).<br><br>I guess he was thinking of Japanese. Remember that joke, which, if I remember it, asks a Japanese to repeat 'Flied lice' knowing they will say what sounds like 'Fried rice'.

<h2>Stick your finger through your neck</h2>

I'm reminded of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strc_prst_skrz_krk" title="wikipedia.org">Str&#196; prst skrz krk</a wikipedia.org> in Czech/Slovak.<br><br>I think Croatian does them better when it comes to words without "traditional" vowels, though.<br><br>And then there's Georgian, with impressive consonant clusters such as "gvprtskvni" ("you peel us" or something along those lines, IIRC).

I heard this one from a Slovak friend in college.  Hearing a rolled "r" used as a vowel is crazy the first time...

<p>FWIW, is the Georgian pronounced like it's spelled (in English plus rolled "r")?</p>
