<p><p>For some reason, the train I was on this morning happened to be in a garrulous mood. Before we'd even pulled away from the station it had assualted my ears with 4 announcements, one repeated, two mostly unnecessary, before saying "Please would customers with mobile phones and stereos use them with consideration to other customers".</p>
<p>"Grrr," I thought, "please would trains with PA systems use them with consideration to others"</p>
<p>Of course, the train had the last laugh. After regailing us all with messages about putting luggage on the luggage racks, not putting your feet on the seat, moving in between the seats to allow other sardines to board, why we were late, not leaving luggage unattended, it produced its punchline:</p>
<blockquote>Please listen to announcements on the station and onboard the train.</blockquote>
<p>Maybe I should be happy that it's not talking about the weather...</p>
<p><small>We apologise for the delay. This is due to {rails expanding in the hot weather|leaves on the line|the wrong kind of snow}</small></p></p>

<h2>Quiet Coach</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Smylers/">Smylers</a> on 2005-09-08T12:04:18</h3>
<p>I heard an announcement once which asked passengers, sorry &ldquo;customers&rdquo;, in the quiet coach only to use mobile phones, personal stereos, and laptop computers in silent mode.  Two of those I can understand, but <em>silent personal stereos</em>?</p>

<p>But you're right that the most irritating noise is the announcements.  They should make the quiet coach announcement free, and put a sign at the end of it saying that if you're too stupid to notice your destination station and you choose to sit in that coach then it's your own fault.</p>

The idea of quiet coaches is a great one.  Trouble is, it breaks down because they allow children in there.  And also when you book seats in advance you often end up being put in the quiet coach without asking to be, which annoys both the person who wants to be normal and yak on their phone, and the person who wants to be in the quiet coach but can't be.
