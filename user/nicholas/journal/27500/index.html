<p><p>According to various second hand reports on the Internet, <a href="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?ll=50.675467,-1.934023&spn=0.032399,0.076728&t=h&hl=en">Sandbanks (in Poole, in Dorset)</a> has either the fourth or third highest land values by area anywhere in the world. So what is the source of this ordering? Where are the two (or three) places which are more valuable?</p>
<p><small>For those who have been there, notice that Google Maps doesn't show the road down the Studland Peninsur. D'oh! The chain ferry wouldn't be very useful without that road.</small></p></p>

<h2>Hybrid mode</h2>

Map mode shows the road. Hybrid mode is only supposed to show more major roads anyway.

<p>Hybrid mode zoomed in to the "We're sorry, but we don't have imagery" level shows the road. So Google (or their data feed) is forgiven.*</p>
<p>Perhaps it's good that they don't have hi-res imagery of that area, as I'm not sure if I really want to zoom in that far on the nudist beach. Very disconcerting that - you're starting off on walking the South West Coast path, all nicely wrapped up, and you encounter loads of starkers wrinklies.</p>
<p> <small>* partly forgiven. The one way system shown around <a href="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?ll=51.525780,-0.080166&amp;spn=0.003976,0.009591&amp;t=h&amp;hl=en" title="google.co.uk">Old Street</a google.co.uk> is at least 2 years out of date. Then again, it does tie in with the age of the satellite photos (Look closely at the position of the busses waiting at the traffic lights). But the alignment of the streets and the satellite could do with some improvement. Then again, <a href="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?ll=27.940929,-82.441878&amp;spn=0.005646,0.009591&amp;t=h&amp;hl=en" title="google.co.uk">compare the streets and the satellite in Tampa<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</a google.co.uk> </small> </p>
