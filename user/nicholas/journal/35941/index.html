<blockquote>By way of comparison, since 2001 the annual death rate from international terrorism in the UK averages out as eight.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Compare last year with 25 years before. </blockquote>
<blockquote>In 1972 the UK saw 10,631 terrorist shootings and 1,853 bombings; 470 people were killed by terrorism.</blockquote>

<blockquote>In 2007, there were 47 shootings and 20 bombings - all in Northern Ireland and three people were killed by paramilitaries.</blockquote>

<blockquote>There were precisely no shootings, bombings or deaths associated with al-Qaeda.</blockquote>

<blockquote>It was the same story the year before.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Indeed, with the exception of the 52 people killed during the appalling attacks of 7 July 2005, no-one in Britain has been killed by al-Qaeda affiliates since 9/11.</blockquote>
