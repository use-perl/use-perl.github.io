<p>In 2005ish, Fotango started developing something that "evolved" into Zimki, a hosted "Software As A Service" offering, allowing you to write applications in server-side Javascript. The plan (or at least, one iteration of the plan) was to trial it as "free", but later on charge for it (or at least, above a low "free" threshold). It never seemed to get that many actual users, and folded when Canon Europe folded Fotango.</p>
<p>Of course, <b>nothing</b> is left online describing it, other than a <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/2006/09/zimki-hosted-javascript-enviro.html">O'Reilly radar post</a>.</p>
<p>So, it seems, Sun re-invented the concept, and called it Zembly. It seems to be incredibly similar - <a href="http://java.sun.com/javaone/2009/articles/gen_zembly.jsp">SaaS, browser-based, server side JavaScript, scaling catered for, two syllable name starting with Z</a>. Curiously, they <b>did</b> find a credible pitch for <b>who</b> might want to use it - people writing applications for social networking sites. This is actually a really sensible target - from what I remember reading, social networking apps can explode into <a href="http://www.ccl4.org/user/nick/I/Keep%20shovelling%20carrots.mpeg">resource-devouring monsters</a>, so having all your insane scaling problems handled by someone else with experience seems like a big win. Heck, they even <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/2008/06/zembly-provides-social-context.html">even got a Radar pitch</a>.</p>
<p>Only <a href="http://zembly.com/static/suspend/index.html">they too are shutting down</a> [that link likely will break soon after 30th November, try <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/11/10/sun-kills-zembly/">TechCrunch</a>]. Is there any money in this? Or at least, is there any <b>profit</b>, at this level of abstraction?</p></p>
