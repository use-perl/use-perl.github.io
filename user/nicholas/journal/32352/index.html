<p><p>It's definitely the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/features/snowmen.shtml">right kind of snow</a>. I set of for a walk to the park, and tested it by
trying to roll a ball along the pavement. My ball was getting a bit unwieldy
after about 15 houses, particularly because it seemed to be more keen on
becoming a snow tetrahedron, so I parked it. When I came back, I rolled it
back to my house, by which time it was rather big. So I wandered the other way
and rolled a second ball back (which also seemed to have tetrahedral ambitions).
One ball on top of the other ball, and after a bit of underpinning following a
toppling scare, it seemed stable, so a third small ball (forcibly round) and
I seem to have the only snowman in the road. A neighbour walked by at this 
point, and smiled, so I explained "well, I made this ball, and then you have
to something with it, don't you?" and shrugged.</p></p>
