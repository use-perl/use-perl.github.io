<p><p>I visted my parents for Christmas. Despite most people already being off work on Christmas Eve, I had to fight my way there through very heavy traffic, as all the last minute shoppers returned from emptying shops all over London. I watch almost no TV here, so watching something on ITV at my parents was my first exposure to TV adverts for some time. Also, I don't like shopping at the best of times, so I don't enjoy the bustle involved in getting presents for people at this time of year.</p>
<p>It's Christmas Eve. We have a very nice meal at a restaurant with my sister and her husband. A passing comment that he made was that he's been unable to buy teacakes in the supermarket near work since September, because they've been replaced by Christmas puddings. I return to my parent's house, and my thoughts are about it being Christmas day tomorrow, calm thoughts, hoping people will like the presents that I bought, and how the rush is now over.</p>
<p>Waaah!</p>
<p>The TV is full of adverts for "January" sales, which start on Boxing Day. Give us a break! We've had retail therapy in our faces for 4 months now for one reason and barely hours after the shops shut on that and they're already encouraging us to start shopping again for another.</p>
<p>Bah humbug. What is the world coming to? It's not even the most important Christian festival.</p></p>
