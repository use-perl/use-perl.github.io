<p><p>I don't like clay with sandstone lumps in it either, although not as much as <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/nicholas/journal/31285">I don't like sandstone</a>. The clay is hard work, and to make any progress needs shaving off the side of the hole with a shovel, sliver by sliver. Only sooner rather than later you hit a sandstone lump and you're going nowhere. So you switch to a pickaxe, but you can't get it under the lump, or if you can, the lump is firmly embedded going anywhere. Grr. (And because the sandstone is surrounded by solid material, it won't shatter and remains as hard as, well, rock). I guess it doesn't help if you have surface water pouring over the place where you are digging your hole.</p>
<p>But we persevered, and <a href="http://gallery74781.fotopic.net/p35039430.html">it's up</a>. Finally. <a href="http://www.bluebell-railway.co.uk/bluebell/pic2/news/new_bracket.jpg">Last year's</a> [left, in as delivered state. Right is 2004's, but fitted out] was actually much simpler to install, despite being a 4 rail post with a half bracket, instead of a "simple" two rail post.</p>
<p>And as ever, it seems much longer when it's vertical than when it's horizontal on the ground. Visual perception is a strange thing.</p></p>
