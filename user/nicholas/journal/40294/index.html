<p><p>So, mostly conclusions without much justification. Of the recent consumption:</p>
<dl><dt><a href="http://www.westons-cider.co.uk/Shop/Sparkling-Ciders/Medium-Dry-Ciders/Henry-Westons-Vintage-Special-Reserve~~12x500ml/">Weston's Vintage Special Reserve</dt>
<dd>I didn't like this as much as the first time I had it. It feels like it's over doing it somehow.</dd>
<dt><a href="http://www.thatcherscider.co.uk/products/singlevarietal/katy/">Thatchers' Katy</a></dt><dd>Nicer than the Special Reserve.</dd>
<dt><a href="http://www.westons-cider.co.uk/Shop/Sparkling-Ciders/Perry-and-Specialist-Ciders/Perry/">Weston's Perry</a></dt>
<dd>Want more. Seriously drinkable. Seriously dangerous*.</dd>
<dt>Brother's Festival Cider</dt><dd>I didn't like it that much. It has a slight rough undertone, like there's a trace of scrumpy in it. But I wasn't trying to drink paint stripper (this time).</dd>
</dl>
<p>Unfortunately I have run out of Katy and Perry. There will have to be a third place drink-off between the Special Reserve and the Festival Cider. Carefully. And not on a school night.</p>
<p><small>* Trumps Apple Hooch in the "danger" category. To me, Apple Hooch tastes like Appletize. Problem is that I know that Appletize is non-alcholic, and don't pace myself. Only Apple Hooch is (well, was) 5% ABV. Weston's Perry is 7.4%.</small></p>

<h2>Try the rest of Weston's</h2>

<p>I'm very partial to Weston's Cider and Perry, at this very moment I'm cooking tripe in premium organic cider. I think that Weston's Vintage is very good though - you should try it again before you discard it. Their Perry is very good, and strangely enough they do both Perry and Pear Cider. My local Morrisons have a good selection of Weston's cider along with very good beer too!</p><p>Also consider Henny's Ciders, also available at a decent supermarket.</p>
