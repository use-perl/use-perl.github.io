<h1>The big sucking noise in London</h1>
<h2><a href="/user/nicholas/">nicholas</a> on 2007-04-26T15:39:43</h2>
</div> <!-- /span4 -->


<div class="span8">
<p><p>There are at least 8 companies that I'm aware of recruiting for "Perl 
developers" in London. I think that are all expanding, rather than replacing 
existing staff, most want "senior" people, and in a couple of cases I believe 
that they're wanting 12 or so people over the course of the next months. 
So even if some of these posts are filled, it just starts the merry-go-round 
by transferring the vacancies elsewhere.</p> 
 
<p>Herein lies a problem.</p> 
 
<p>There aren't that many "senior perl" people looking for new jobs in London. 
In particular, a lot of these companies seem to want someone with 3-5 years 
experience in <i>template system of choice</i>, who likes making websites, 
knows the current web standards, and is keen on the salary ranges offered.</p> 
 
<p>Trouble is that everyone else is looking for exactly the same sort of 
people. And that they seem surprised that they can't find anyone. Or that 
people start asking</p> 
 
<ol><li>What is going to prevent this job becoming repetitive in 3 months?</li> 
<li>Two years down the line, where is my next career move within your company?</li> 
</ol> 
 
<p>It's probably a side effect of Perl. It's not taught at universities, so 
there isn't a ready made supply of cookie cutter graduates to slip into dull 
jobs. It's not used by major IT contractors (think Capita or EDS), so they 
aren't busy generating people moving on with 3-5 years' experience of Perl. 
Perl is something people tend to find by themselves, so is likely to bias 
itself to the more self-motivated (and potentially therefore, on average,
above average) IT person. Also Perl is seen by some as a fun language - this 
has lead to a class of people who preferred to stick with Perl and let the 
money go down during the quiet times, rather than change to other skills and 
follow the money elsewhere. But when "Perl" jobs dried up after the last 
bubble burst, what do people do? If you want the money, you shift your CV to 
emphasise the well paid skills, <i>i.e.</i> not Perl.</p> 
 
<p>The upshot is that there aren't enough "Perl" people for these new jobs. 
There aren't the less experienced developers who would see these "senior" 
jobs as a move up, because there weren't the more junior jobs for them over 
the past few years. There are people with more experience than the range 
the employer suggests, but strangely they've been working elsewhere, so 
earn more than the employer wants to offer for <b>just</b> the skills they 
seek. And there are people who used to do Perl, who aren't now, who are 
likely to be earning more than the employer wants to offer.</p> 
 
<p>So what can the employers do to recruit and <b>retain</b> staff? 
Logically:</p> 
 
<ol><li>Raise the offered salaries by ÃÂ£5-10K. After all, it's a free market, 
and demand outstrips supply.</li> 
<li>Accept that instead of taking someone with <i>n</i> years experience of 
Perl, they will also have to take people who are good programmers, smart, 
don't have <i>n</i> of Perl, but do have <i>n</i> years of transferable 
experience.</li> 
</ol>
 
<p>After all, we pride Perl on its shallow learning curve, so its similarity 
to many other languages (sed, awk, C, C++, Java, PHP) means that smart 
people don't take long to become effective in it. Sure, you can't fill your 
entire team this way, but you don't need everyone to be the same cookie-cutter 
Perl expert.</p></p>

<h2>... and in Vienna</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/domm/">domm</a> on 2007-04-26T18:18:31</h3>
<p>The place I'm working for is looking for up to 4 Perl programmers at the moment (well, I think they'll start the proper search in a few days..). And there are some other companies looking for people, too.</p>

<p>Ony of my co-workers (how technically is in another team (front end, while I'm doing back end stuff)) in fact didn't know Perl when he started, but had several years of experience with PHP (gasp!). Now that we've converted him to the good side, he seems to be quite happy with Perl.</p>

<p>So the point is, if you're looking for Perl people, you might want to also target other P-language speakers...</p>

<p>/me has to tell HR to consider this, too</p>



<h2>Outside the EU</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Ovid/">Ovid</a> on 2007-04-26T20:49:33</h3>
<p>I'm trying to convince my company to start hiring more people outside the EU.  The available pool of top-notch Perl people is very small and you have to have something "special" to recruit them in London.  I think that if a company can be patient, they can easily fill their staff with work permit holders who won't demand top of the line salaries.  The problem, of course, is that once they're over here, they'll see what they <em>could</em> be making and then they'll start to chafe.</p>



<h2>London != Magnet</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/barbie/">barbie</a> on 2007-04-27T08:40:31</h3>
You also have the problem that not everyone sees moving to London as a step in the right direction. There have been plenty of jobs I've been offered in the last 20+ years, that would have required me to move to or nearer the capital and I've turned them all down. I know I'm not the only one, so while companies might complain there are no Perl people, there are other factors that might not be so appealing, that are influencing some to not apply. Now if the jobs were in Birmingham<nobr> <wbr></nobr>....<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)

<h2>Re: if there was a job in Birmingham ...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/drhyde/">drhyde</a> on 2007-05-01T18:17:02</h3>
... then I'd not be interested, even if it seemed perfect and was well paid, because when it's time to move on (because they hate me, or I hate them, or they go tits up) there'll be nothing else in the area, and moving sucks<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)  The impression I get is that IT in the UK outside London is predominantly either academic or, umm, lower skilled.  In both of those cases, the employees don't expect to be as mobile as the good people in London do.

<p><div class="quote">IT outside London is predominantly either academic or lower skilled.</div>  <p>Where are you getting that impression from? There are plenty of VERY skilled opportunities all over the UK, and I see an acedemic job once in a blue moon.</p><p><div class="quote">In both of those cases, the employees don't expect to be as mobile as the good people in London do.</div>  <p>You're looking at it from the wrong angle. Both employee and employer in London don't need to think long term because they find another job / can (usually) fill the position. Contracts are often short as they work on short term projects. Outside of the capital most employees and employers are thinking more about career progression, or developing their skills by specialising in certain areas. Employers seem to put more effort into retaining their good people, and employees are often looking for somewhere to settle, where they can bring their kids up.
</p><p>In fact I'm more inclined to think there are more academic and low skilled IT jobs in London than in the rest of the UK. That and finance<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
</p><p>It'll be interesting to see how the IT recruitment fares for the "technology corridor" between Birmingham and Worcester, specifically for Longbridge and Pebble Mill technology parks. I suspect (and hope) that there'll be some very specific IT skills being advertised soon.</p>

<h2>It's not a Perl problem, it's an IT problem.</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ziggy/">ziggy</a> on 2007-04-29T04:43:14</h3>
Although I haven't seen these particular ads in London, it sounds very familiar to openings I've seen elsewhere.  And it's not limited to Perl -- it's common throughout the industry, regardless of language choice.<br><br>The root cause is that most businesses aren't in the IT business.  IT is a cost center, a necessary evil of getting the real job done in the modern age.  Because it is a cost center, it's an area where costs should be contained and ideally minimized.  Thus the downward pressure on salaries -- on the one hand, you don't want to hire someone junior and inexperienced.  On the other hand, either you're not willing to pay market rates for senior staff, or you're willing to pay market rates, but don't have the kind of work to keep senior staff from getting bored and moving along.<br><br>Java shops have had these problems at least since the boom -- simply knowing Java isn't enough, and all candidates need to have 3-5 years experience in the platform of choice -- related or competing platforms aren't good enough.  No interest in hiring senior people who learn on the job.  No value in finding someone with a different perspective.  Management has selected the technology stack, and now it's HR's turn to find someone who can maintain and extend a project using that precise stack.<br><br>This process goes on until it becomes obvious that the first choice -- hiring precisely the skills you need -- is no longer a viable hiring strategy.  Next comes putting out ads for related skills.  Hiring Tcl programmers is beyond impossible, unless you can get someone in the door by being vague and listing one of (Perl|Python|PHP) as 'valuable skills'.  You have a chance of hiring that candidate if all the stars are aligned, particularly if there's a mortgage due and the job market generally sucks at the moment.<br><br>What's lost are the positions seeking senior staff, with salaries and challenges commensurate with the desired skill.  In positions where IT is a cost center, this shouldn't be surprising -- the goals of management and the candidate pool are at cross purposes.  The problem is that these are the bulk of the positions available, sadly.



<h2>Perl Programmers going the way of the Cobol?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jhfoo/">jhfoo</a> on 2007-04-30T02:32:05</h3>
Over here in SG it's just as difficult (if not more) to get someone who even knows what Perl is. This perception is not a good picture of Perl, because in this part of the world it's just as difficult to get a Delphi developer.<br/><br/>To make themselves marketable, people like to choose tools which allows them to move around (or get hired) easily. We see less of the code enthusiasts who spend time evaluating the various styles of development tool, and decide for themselves which they will WANT to code in. But that's reality.<br/><br/>It's a survival game. My personal take on how Perl can prevent itself from fossilising, is to figure a way to really get Perl 6 out the door and renew its relevance in the modern world.<br/><br/>Perl 5 is great, but we are all evoluntionists. Me? I'm a Perl man. But now I'm also a C# guy too.<br/><br/>I have to.

<h2>Perl programmers in London</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/PerlJunkie/">PerlJunkie</a> on 2007-05-09T15:02:54</h3>
<p>
You know there are a number of things about this "problem" with finding Perl programmers in London that surprise me.
</p>

<p>
First of all, I'm still <b>amazed</b> that employers don't see that London is as close to most senior and seasoned Perl developers as their cable modem.  What's with the still-lingering demand that people be geographically located?  It's insane.  Wake up; the world's a different place.
</p>

<p>
Second of all, in line with <i>numero uno</i> above, there are a lot of senior, seasoned Perl developers in the US.  Even if I lived in the UK, as someone else (someone local to the UK) mentioned, I don't know that I would want to put up with London right now.  So by eliminating the possibility of case-in-point #1 above, workers IN the UK and good workers in the US are eliminated.
</p>

<p>
Third, it's plain out insane to insist that the people you hire are familiar and have 3-5 years working in the templating system of choice.  I personally am an HTML::Template enthusiast, but that's never kept me from learning TT or Text::Template, Mason or anything else based on the same concept in relatively short order.
</p>

<p>
Fourth, I think these companies get what they ask for.  I monitor jobs.perl.org, and have yet to even get a sniff when I reply to openings in the UK.  Now I readily attribute this to item #1 above, because I <b>KNOW</b> what my Perl skills are like (and so do over a <b>DOZEN</b> Fortune 100 companies in the US who have used my skills and asked for me again and again to do new work).
</p>

<p>
All those points together lead me to say this: I'm not so "convinced" that employers in London are as "desperate" as I'm reading here.  Either that, or they just aren't clued into the market and how it all works.  As the OP mentions, people senior in Perl aren't your run-of-the-mill IT people.  They generally picked up Perl on their own and have a little bit of "maverick" in them, and don't go about their work or their careers in the straight "Visual Basic developer" fashion.  If anything, we are the anti-thesis of that.
</p>

<p>
The solution is to change the approach, again as has been suggested.  The Perl people are out there.  They just aren't in the same neighborhoods the employers are searching in and again when we <b>do</b> come knocking on the front door, the employer doesn't have the good sense to see who's there and open the door.
