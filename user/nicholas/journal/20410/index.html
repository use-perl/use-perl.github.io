<p><p>I went for a walk around 5pm along the Thames. A bit upriver from where I normally walk there's a pontoon dock. This isn't news in itself, but what caught my eye was a narrowboat moored on the end. Plus it was listing quite badly.</p>

<p>A bit later I was on the way to the, er <i>today's</i> <a href="http://london.pm.org/pipermail/london.pm/Week-of-Mon-20040809/028541.html">emergency social</a> and walked past the mooring. The narrowboat was still there, and not looking that well. It was thoroughly grounded, touching the bottom at 2 points, which can't be that good for it structurally. Also it wasn't that habitable, as it was totally off-level, both 10ÃÂ° front to back, and listing at 10ÃÂ°. The crew were sitting by it on the pontoon, looking bored. I guess that they'd moored up to go shopping, and forgotten that we ain't in Texas now: tide goes up, tide goes down. The tidal range here, >40miles inland, is about 6m, so moorings have to cope with this. Do not be surprised if the river goes away for a bit.</p>

<p>On the way <b>back</b> from the emergency social, they're still there. Looking incredibly bored now. The Thames seems to be no closer to them than 5 hours ago. I estimate that they won't refloat until 1am. Ooops.</p></p>
