<p>It's called a free market. Quit whining. You always pretend that you like them when they work in your favo(u)r. And then get upset when other people play by the same rules, such as <a href=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/4734728.stm">one group of foreigners selling things to another group of foreigners</a>.</p></p>

<p>Do people really think they're going to come in and foreign-up the long-standing successful recipes?  Who cares?  If you want to buy American, you should even more want to buy local, so you should get local brewed beer.  It will be better tasting and better for your local economy.</p><p>VICTORY HOP DEVIL FOR LIFE!</p>



<h2>It'll be better Bud</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Beatnik/">Beatnik</a> on 2008-07-26T23:24:14</h3>
Having spent the last 2 years surrounding by tons of non-belgians (including quite a few americans), I can only say they're all really glad there's better beer out there than Bud. Quite a few of my co-workers have made it their personal goal to drink as many different types of belgian beer as possible. I know more americans with a <a href="http://www.perfectdraft.com/home.htm" title="perfectdraft.com">Perfect Draft</a perfectdraft.com> (beer on draft for home use), than I know belgians.
<br> <br>Purely coincidential, I was born and raised in <i>Stella central</i>. After a while you stop smelling the aroma of corn flakes in the air.



<h2>AND?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/brian_d_foy/">brian_d_foy</a> on 2008-07-27T04:58:53</h3>
<p>Why can't Bud get better AND Stella get worse at the same time?</p>

<p>Yeh, I can't tell from the comments which is the better beer.</p><p>Bud or Stella.</p>

<h2>but we know for sure....</h2>

it'll still be beer, so it can only taste so good.
Yay, wine.
