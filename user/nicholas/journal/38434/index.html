<p><p>Dear lazyweb,<br>
which airport that Ryanair "serve" is furthest (or at least, most inconvenient to get to) from the town they name it after?</p>
<p>It occurs to me that I don't know. <a href="http://www.stanstedairport.com/">Cambridge (south)</a> isn't in the running, as that's an official BAA lie*. Likewise they've stopped trying to call Bratislava as (just) Vienna, and despite being in a different country, it's more convenient than "Frankfurt" Hahn or "Dusseldorf" Weeze.</p>
<p><small>* just like "our core business is running airports".</small></p></p>

You can fly Bratislava - Stockholm. However, that doesn't mean Arlanda (near the city), but rather Skavsta airport - which is approximately 100km south of, or a 1 hour 20 minute bus ride to - Stockholm center. That beats Bratislava/Vienna by a good bit. (Bratislava is my local airport, so I use Ryanair a good bit, and I do hear plenty of German spoken and plenty of people taking the bus to Vienna...it's nice that Ryanair now acknowledge my city's existence as a European capital now, rather than as if it was a suburb of Vienna, though!)

<p>In Belgium, they call Charleroi "Brussels South". The distance from Brussels to Charleroi Airport is about 56km, according to [Mappy]. That is not as bad as it looks on their <a href="http://www.ryanair.com/site/map/images/mapbgdefault.gif" title="ryanair.com">map</a ryanair.com>, where it looks like Brussels is just over the French border, instead of in the middle of the country where it really ought to be. More than 90% of that distance can be traveled over the highway, so it's not that inconvenient. Still, the longest stretch of Belgium (North-West to South-East) is only about 300km, so 56km is quite a significant chunk, by that scale.</p><p>Talking about that <a href="http://www.ryanair.com/site/map/images/mapbgdefault.gif" title="ryanair.com">map</a ryanair.com> (which is the background of their <a href="http://www.ryanair.com/site/EN/dests.php" title="ryanair.com">Silverlight page</a ryanair.com>): Oslo, Norway really looks out of place, as well as Paris, France. </p>
