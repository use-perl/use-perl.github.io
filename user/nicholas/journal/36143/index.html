<p><blockquote><a href="http://brucefwebster.com/2008/04/11/the-wetware-crisis-the-dead-sea-effect/">But in my experience, thatÃ¢â¬â¢s not what happens. Instead, what happens is that the more talented and effective IT engineers are the ones most likely to leave Ã¢â¬â to evaporate, if you will. They are the ones least likely to put up with the frequent stupidities and workplace problems that plague large organizations; they are also the ones most likely to have other opportunities that they can readily move to.</a></blockquote>
<p>Sadly, that seems to sum up my experiences of the past few years, and may well also be why I know almost no-one in London who is working somewhere that is recruiting, and enjoying where they work, using Perl, in London. This is despite knowing a lot of people in London.</p></p>

...the point that <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/scrottie/journal/36134" title="perl.org">scrottie makes</a perl.org> about maintenance code:<p><blockquote><div>If you're a good programmer who likes writing code, you're forced away from entire languages. You're suddenly unable to touch Perl, as an employee, because the only jobs are maintenance or else adding features to a completely fucked system, which you won't do. A few dozen companies mismanaging projects ruined the market for you.</div></blockquote>
