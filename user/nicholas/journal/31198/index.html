<p><p>The IRC network that most Perl stuff happens on is often referred to be the name rhizomatic, and Google finds references to rhizomatic.net. Yet <code>whois</code> now finds no such domain. What bit of history am I missing?</p></p>

There is Whois info for rhizo.mati.ca<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)

Nope, that's the other way around! I own mati.ca, and I put in the "rhizo" cname to point to irc.perl.org's roundrobin *because* the network was called "rhizomatic", at least some of the time.<br><br>Before there was an irc.perl.org, the network was Kevin "YAPC" Lenzo's baby. Rhizomatic.net was his domain, and since the main server in the network was his, people were IRCing on "rhizomatic.net". Then as more servers were added, they got "rhizomatic.net" hostnames too. But all this time, Lenzo himself was calling the network "MAGnet".<br><br>Anyhow, Lenzo got busy with Cepstral and fell off of IRC, and his IRC server "token" is long gone, and eventually rhizomatic.net expired and got bought up by someone else. Some servers still have "MAGnet" in their MOTD, but I don't think there was ever a domain that went with it.<br><br>These days I think it's probably easiest to just call it irc.perl.org, which also happens to be a geodns round robin thingy for all of the servers in the network anyhow.
