<p><p>Dear lazyweb,</p>
<p>Given that genuine VT102 terminals are not that practical to lug around, what
is the "best" terminal emulator for OS X? I realise that as all are made of <a href="http://nick.hates-software.com/">software</a>, all will be hateful, but I was hoping that some might be less hateful than others.</p></p>


<hr/>



<h2>Terminal.app</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/petdance/">petdance</a> on 2008-02-21T17:57:13</h3>
Terminal.app does vt102.



<h2>What's wrong with Terminal.app?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/skugg/">skugg</a> on 2008-02-21T21:22:40</h3>
What is it you don't like about Terminal.app? I know there <i>are</i> alternatives out there, but I've never felt the need to go looking. I really like it...

<p><blockquote><div>What is it you don't like about Terminal.app?</div></blockquote>
<p>Well, under 10.3 and 10.4, it seemed to have some bug whereby when running with
the character set as ISO-8859-1, text with code points in the rage 160-255 would
sometimes wordwrap, and sometimes not. Which was hateful.</p>
<p>However, that now seems to be fixed (in 10.5), so I think that currently there
is nothing actively annoying me.</p>

<h2>I like Konsole</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Shlomi Fish/">Shlomi Fish</a> on 2008-02-23T09:48:16</h3>
<p>
On Linux, I like KDE-3.5.8's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konsole" title="wikipedia.org">Konsole</a wikipedia.org>.  It's very powerful, customisable and convenient. KDE has been ported to Mac OS X, so you may try it there.
</p>



<h2>xterm or iTerm</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Adrian/">Adrian</a> on 2008-02-23T22:37:13</h3>
<p>My personal preference is for <a href="http://iterm.sourceforge.net/" title="sourceforge.net">iTerm</a sourceforge.net> - but many folk seem to hate it<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p><p><p>Running X and using xterm is another option.</p>

<p>I've been told that the Leopard terminal app is quite an improvement over the Tiger one - but I've not played with it myself.</p>



<h2>iTerm</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/speters/">speters</a> on 2008-03-07T03:55:29</h3>
<p>I've been using iTerm for quite some time.  The big problem I have had with Terminal.app is not being able to "Page Up", which is painful when using some sort of terminal-based IRC client.</p>
