<h2>My list</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/autarch/">autarch</a> on 2006-11-22T21:24:53</h3>
I've been looking for a new job recently. Here's some of the questions I ask:<br><br>* What do you like best about working here? What do you like least? What would you change if you could?<br>* How are conflicts resolved? Specifically, technical conflicts, interpersonal conflicts, etc.<br>* How are business and technical goals balanced?<br>* Do you think you're given reasonable goals? How are missed deadlines handled?<br>* Do do automated testing? Do you have QA? Code reviews? Docs?<br>* How would I fit in here? What do you see my role as?<br>* Why should I work here? Sell me on this job.

<p>Which reminds me that one non-squirmy question I've asked is <cite>What version(s) of perl do you use?</cite> Now <b>I</b> might be a bit narcissistic for asking that one, but it does tend to reveal how much the person interviewing you really knows about the system, and about Perl. It reminds me of clkao's classic conference question, which he asked after every talk (until other people started joining in and beating him to it):
</p><blockquote><div>What version control system do you use?</div></blockquote>

<div class="quote"> <p> <cite>What version(s) of perl do you use?</cite> Now <b>I</b> might be a bit narcissistic for asking that one</p> </div> <p>Not at all. It gives you useful information, and reveals that you take your pumpking responsibilities seriously.</p>
<p>Additionally, if the employer is interested in you specifically because of your deep knowledge of perl internals, it lets you start a conversation with them about why they use the version they do, and the benefits and problems with that version related to the kind of programs they write.</p>
<p>Then again, I'm relatively new to the workforce, so I probably shouldn't be giving interview advice.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<p>Good questions, but I have one modification. I think you should try to phrase these in a more concretely open-ended fashion (if that makes sense) because you can wind up stumbling onto really juicy and useful stuff.</p>

<p>For instance, instead of "How are conflicts resolved?" I'd ask "Tell me about a conflict in your team." And if they don't get to how it was resolved (which is what you really want to know), you can then follow up with, "How did it get resolved?" or "How did [team member X] handle being on the losing end?" If they start floundering with an example of a conflict, give them a softball, such as the all-purpose and universal: "Have you ever had marketing deadlines conflict with technical capabilities?" After they hit this out of the park they might be more chatty.</p>

Do you realize that these are questions I ask of an _employer_? I kind of assume they're not nervous interviewing me and already willing to be chatty. I do think that making it a bit more open-ended might be a good way to get better information out of them, though.

<p>Yeah, I understood. But even though it's an employer, it's still a human. And because we're in a technical industry, it might be one of those peers who isn't that great at communicating with their fellow humans. And even folks who are decent communicators might be have a script they're told to stick to -- asking the right kind of questions can get them off it.</p>

Yes, if it is apparent what your intention is when asking the question, they can just tell you what you want to hear.<br><br>If they aren't too sure what the meaning of your question is, they can't lie, or are less likely to lie. Or put an acceptable spin on their reply.

<h2>This actually works the other way around...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/merijnb/">merijnb</a> on 2006-11-23T10:52:44</h3>
I always ask the interviewee at the end of the interview "do you have any questions for us" and give them five minutes for this. You are actually judged on the quantity and quality of the questions you ask at that point. It will quite often reveal what you are interested in, career, collegues, projects, technical stuff etc. If you have no questions, it doesn't reflect very well and probably means you don't actually want the job.

When I'm being interviewed - and indeed when I'm interviewing someone - I like it to be more a conversation than a question/answer session.  The last several times I've been interviewed, all of my questions have been answered in the conversation.  I'll have already, for example, made it clear to the interviewer that I have other interviews lined up, or other positions offered to me, and they'll have already had their opportunity to convince me to work for them.

<h2>Management Style</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Smylers/">Smylers</a> on 2006-11-28T13:17:25</h3>
<p>I like to ask about the manager's management style: who they admire as
managers of development teams, what they read to learn more about and keep up
with the field.</p>

<p>It's surprising how many people just flat-out admit they just make it up as they go
along, or say they don't have time for reading about how to do their job (as
though that's somehow a long-term win!).</p>

<p>For example I'd be happy with a manager who's read what <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/" title="joelonsoftware.com">Joel on Software</a joelonsoftware.com> and <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/articles.html" title="paulgraham.com">Paul Graham</a paulgraham.com> have written on the subject.
I could also be happy with a manager who disagreed with those two, or was a big
fan of somebody else's writings (which I would then ask for a reference to, for
looking up after the interview).</p>

<p>I have a good idea which giants' shoulders I was standing on to become a
decent Perl programmer, and what I do to progress further.  I'd be really
surprised if somebody could be an excellent manager without learning from those
who have gone before.</p>
