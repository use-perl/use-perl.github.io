<p><p>So Ken Livingstone is re-elected as mayor of London. Possibly this not that interesting at all to most of use.perl's readers. Except that he's just demonstrated that it's not a guarantee of polical suicide to introduce road charges for car drivers.</p></p>

I am living in a very tight town where in parts of the city centre all car traffic is banned. And yet, I'd vote for anyone who promised to make the other parts of the city car-free as well, or at least charge fees.<br> <br>I've seen cities where even the wide streets are closed down for ordinary traffic, such as Edinburgh's Princess street. That makes for a very relaxed atmosphere. Naturally, good public transport is necessary in this case.

I wonder how much larger his majority would have been if he hadn't rejoined Labour.<br> <br>And I'm loving the irony of Tony Blair's best news from the elections being the re-election of someone he really didn't want in the party.
