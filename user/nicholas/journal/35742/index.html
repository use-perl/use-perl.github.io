<p>Home Office minister Tony McNulty <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/7260164.stm">told BBC</a> that a national database was not a "silver bullet" and that it would raise practical as well as civil liberties issues.</p>

<p>"How to maintain the security of a database with 4.5m people on it is one thing," he said.</p>

<p>"Doing that for 60m people is another."</p>

<p>Politicians listening to reason and experts and <i>not</i> going to do something (that can be spun as doing something <strong>useful</strong>) because it's impractical? Who are you and what have you done with the real politicians?</p></p>
