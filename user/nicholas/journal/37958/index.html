<p>(And you may not know that in the original spec, Verified by Visa was to be implemented as a proper phishing scam - a popup you didn't expect, without a URL bar, asking for the sensitive information. And even now, some banks still outsource it to third parties to implement, with the result that your bank's name and URL is not in the the hostname of the server challenging you to divulge sensitive information.)</p></p>

<p>I hate it, all that happens when "Verified by Visa" pops up is the transaction fails and I take my business elsewhere or if I'm really pushed and I have to use that vendor I use my Mastercard instead...</p>



<h2>Man I hate it</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/link/">link</a> on 2008-11-27T21:43:36</h3>
<p>I tried to hold out but eventually I signed up. To this day it leaves a bad taste in my mouth. If I ever stop being lazy maybe I will signup for a mastercard but I'm sure it will turn out that they have some equally stupid thing.</p>

Yes, they do - MasterCard SecureCode - which is still the 3D Secure protocol. The only way to completely avoid it is to get an Amex card.

The one time I was confronted by Verified By Visa, I thought I was being phished so I screwed around a bit going directly to their site to make sure it was real, and in the process, managed to get my account completely locked for suspicious behavior, without being notified at the time.  Several charges bounced and caused me quite a headache.
