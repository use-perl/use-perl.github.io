<p><p>After excellent sushi at <a href="http://la.foodblogging.com/2006/06/28/irori-japanese-restaurant-marina-del-rey/">Irori</a> with <a href="http://hiveminder.com/">Jesse</a> I decided that the night was still young so I would go for a drive. Our hire care is a Pontiac Grand Prix, and I'm feeling calmer about it* and California driving rules now, so just driving around while the traffic is light actually seemed like fun. As I was on Lincoln Boulvard at the time, which happens to be highway one, I decided that following highway 1 as it jinks through Santa Monica to the coast was the way to go, and I set off north up the Pacific Coast Highway. Initially I decided that I would turn round at Malibu, but at Malibu I decided that this was all going so well I'd keep going for a bit, and in the end I turned roughly at Point Dume**. On the way back through Malibu I noticed something slightly odd - a yellow warning sign for a bend, with a limit of 45mph. The odd part - this stretch had a limit of 45mph ("radar enforced"). Maybe they are suspecting that <a href="http://www.jalopnik.com/cars/news/more-on-the-enzo-incident-on-pch-with-photos-156121.php">not
everyone sticks to the speed limit on PCH.</a></p> 
<p><small>* Colour me white (van man), but really I still think I'd prefer a Transit. Shorter, narrower, better turning circle, better driving position, and a manual diesel would have about as much poke and be about as hard to stall. Heck, you don't actually need forward gears in one - empty you can pull away in third, and you could probably get to 70.</small></p>
<p><small>** Near the end of Wildlife Road, for the record.</small></p></p>
