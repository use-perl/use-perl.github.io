<p>It reminds me of a company, where the ticket for one of the development tasks
I was assigned started "Now that we've signed the contract with
<code>$third_party</code> we need to work out whether it's possible to deliver
what is described in the agreement." And what do you, dear mis-management, think
I the programmer am going to do, if it turns out not to be possible? Perhaps it
would have been a good idea to ask the programmers <b>first</b>, before making
promises that you may not be able to keep.</p>

My favorite way to explain this is to put a dollar value on things.<br><br>So if a biz/sales guy says we can do something, it's a "$1000 promise" or a "$100,000 promise" or a "$1,000,000 promise".<br><br>These guys know dollars. If they have to make a $100,000 promise and make the techies life hell to secure a $10,000,000 deal, so be it. Lets face it, most things are possible, they just sometimes have unbelievably large price tags on them.<br><br>Then it's just a case of having them check which promise are $100,000 promises. Which is a little easier, because they look bad if they make a $100,000 promise on a $10,000 deal.<br><br>

I don't understand.

<p>If the company makes my life hell, I don't care how much money is involved (unless a lot of it will go to me as a bonus, I suppose, but that's unlikely).  I'm just going to quit and get a job with nicer people.</p>
