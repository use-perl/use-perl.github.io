<p><blockquote><p>A father who tried to buy six beers from a branch of Tesco was told that he could not be served because he had his teenage daughter with him.</p><p>A cashier told Dominic Zenden, 45, that he could not leave with the Budweiser bottles in case he gave any to his 15-year-old daughter, Devon. </p></blockquote>
<p>I think Charlie from Munich's comment sums it up best:</p>
<blockquote><a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article3935489.ece">Tesco would do well to stop anyone buying Budweiser!</a></blockquote></p>

<p>Our local Co-Op refused to serve Nicole a few months ago when she went to stock up on Boddingtons. They asked for ID, and told her that they refuse to serve under 18 year olds. She's 35! (but don't tell her I told you that<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)) She had to come back and get her passport to prove she really was as old as she claimed. She was actually quite chuffed<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
</p><p>I think the best comment though has to go to this one:</p><p><div class="quote">"Mr Zenden, who has worked as a spiritualist medium for 25 years, should have seen this coming really - shouldn't he?"</div>

The only time I've been asked for ID when buying booze, I was 15 and could, of course, easily "prove" that I was over 18.
