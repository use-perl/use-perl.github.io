<p><strong>Challenge-response systems suck</strong></p>
<p>In the good old days, if someone wrote a worm for Windows that sends a mail to a third party address with an envelope faked as if I sent it then one of two things could happen:
<ol><li>It is delivered to that address - I see nothing</li>
<li>It fails to reach that address, and I see a bounce.</li></ol>
Count that carefully - at most, one worm mail generates <strong>one</strong> message to me.</p>
<p>Enter challenge response systems. This is the third message I have had asking to confirm the message that "I" sent:<br><br>

<p>Notice how I can't shut them up even I want to - there is no link to click to say "forget it, this wasn't me". I've been quite tempted to click on that link to let the message through - after all, in the short term, I lose nothing by doing that, but gain silence. Maybe there is a good use for all these Windows worms - I hope that all these challenge-response store systems are suffocating under the weight of SOBIG and Klez, and we soon will be rid of them.</p></p>

Filter all challenge/reponse messages that are addressed to your 'real' mailboxes into the trash. Read, and respond to all the ones sent to invalid addresses, certifying that whatever got sent wasn't spam.<br> <br>If enough people do this, eventually we'll see such fuckwitted systems dying out.<br> <br>Now, all we need is for the DNS based 'only these hosts have authority to send mail from this domain' spam stop thing to gain traction...

<p>I've just received another from someone else, thanks to SOBIG.E. This challenge wants me to respond with a reply to an e-mail address. Helpfully it's set the <code>Reply-To</code> to that address. That way lies madness - if the faked from address had not been me, but that of any autoresponder, then the challenge will be met, and the orginal unwanted message will get through. Then again, it's not my problem if the C/R luser gets the infected message sent to him/her/it.</p>
