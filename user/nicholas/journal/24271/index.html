<p><p>Now on <a href="http://maps.google.com/">Google maps</a> if you drag America off to the left you'll discover that a new pair of islands has appeared in the previously endless sea. Yes. Google maps now does <code>.uk</code> and <code>.ie</code>. None of the rest of Europe - it's still part of the endless sea. I guess Google maps now roughly corresponds to Dubya's world view. :-)</p></p>

I suppose it's <a href="http://local.google.co.uk/maps?q=sushi+loc:+w2+5bp" title="google.co.uk">fairly pretty</a google.co.uk>, and they've also gone for my favourite colour scheme!



<h2>Ireland</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/link/">link</a> on 2005-04-19T15:43:15</h3>
They do not seem to have populated the database with any irish information. Nothing I search for brings back any useful results. Strange as I assumed they pulled it from the same source as the maps and their is plenty of map data for Ireland.Still it is beta so maybe they will get around to it.

The actual business address data is provided by Yell.com (as credited at the bottom right of search results), and since they don't cover Ireland it'll be a lot more work for Google to do this.

I meant the location search more than the business search. It feels a little strange to see Dublin on the map but for a search for Dublin to not return Dublin,Ireland.<br>
Then again its cool to have the maps available at all,just a pity google ireland havn't managed to get a maps.google.ie in place.

<p>I'm waiting for the tie in to the satellite information now. Demanding much, am I ? Well, the USians 'ave it. Why not us, huh ? I'm waiting to be embarassed by someone pointing me to it<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)
</p> <p>It's wonderful stuff though. I trashed my Multimap bookmark then and there.</p>

I am not looking for a discussion or argument<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... I've just been reading lately a lot of people talking about the "Anglosphere," remarking about how it was the English-speaking nations -- Australia, UK, U.S., and even the English-speaking Canadians -- who were largely behind the war in Iraq, and how there is may be some benefit in a treaty between English-speaking nations.<br> <br>I'd never really thought of the world as easily separable by language like that, across great distances, but it actually seems to make sense to me.  I know a lot of has to do with common heritage, which is why I've also seen people include India as a possible associate member to the club.<br> <br>Anyway, this was just running through my mind.  Sorry for the dump.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br>

...just happened across this entry.  I realize you weren't looking for discussion or arguement, and I hope to not provide the latter, but I think two things are worth pointing out.
<p>
With an obvious exception (the US), the associations are there in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Nations" title="wikipedia.org">Commonwealth of Nations</a wikipedia.org>, which has existed since the 1920s and currently has its most effect through cultural links instead of explicit treaties (though there are a number of policies that are harmonized between Commonwealth countries).
</p><p>
What that means for international identities today, I'm not sure.
</p><p>
Secondly, as an American living in Canada, who moved here just before September 2001, I can say pretty clearly that english-speaking Canada was <em>not</em> solidly behind the war in Iraq; an ipsos-reid poll I just dug up says two weeks after the war started, 54% of English Canada supported the war (48% including Francophones).
<a href="http://www.ipsos-na.com/news/pressrelease.cfm?id=1784" title="ipsos-na.com">http://www.ipsos-na.com/news/pressrelease.cfm?id=1784</a ipsos-na.com>

In mid-2002, approximately 65% of Canadians were opposed to Canadian involvement in the war without UN sanctions, or approved of US involvement, according to Environics polls (<a href="http://erg.environics.net/news/default.asp?aID=516" title="environics.net">http://erg.environics.net/news/default.asp?aID=516</a environics.net>).
Though Environics' numbers suggested 70% of Canadians were opposed to the war after the first six months, so higher than ipsos-reids' poll results.
</p><p>
Anyway, just wanted to fill that bit in.</p>

I didn't mean to imply the support was overwhelming.<br>
