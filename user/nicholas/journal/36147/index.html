<div class="span8">
<p><p>Luton (or at least <a href="http://london.randomness.org.uk/wiki.cgi?Luton_Airport">the airport</a>) turned out to be surprisingly unsucky, at least on a weekday. As they were only using &#8533;th of the checkin desks, but probably &#8531;rd of the departure lounge, I have this horrid feeling that it will be heaving during the weekends of package holiday/charter flight season, but I've no intent of finding that out first hand. Then again, I wasn't planning to fly out via Luton until about 22 hours before the plane took off.</p>
<p>Given that I had to depart before 9:30, I had to buy a full fair ticket (which turns out to be a princely ÃÂ£31 from Grove Park, a mere ÃÂ£2 more than the off-peak price to Stansted Airport). As I was blowing the budget already with full-fare, I thought about asking the ticket office person what the cost of first class was, but I didn't. The irony was that the 09:00 Derby service from St Pancras (first stop Luton Airport Parkway) was only 5 coaches, so to prevent overcrowding in standard class, they'd de-classified half of first class. So I got to travel first class anyway. :-)</p>
<p>Those hourly Derby services seem to be rather nice. The train goes like the clappers (we passed 3 ThameslinksÃ¢â¬Â  on the way), first stop is the right stop, and even with a maximal 10 minute wait for the airport bus and an 8 minute bus ride, it was still faster than the Stansted "Express". (46 minutes, including a stop at Totenham Hale and one other station. Stansed is to "Express" as Tiscali is to "unlimited")</p>
<p>Despite this I still prefer <a href="http://london.randomness.org.uk/wiki.cgi?London_City_Airport">City</a>. But there one needs to book early, or be filthy rich.</p>
</p>
<p><small>Ã¢â¬Â  The slower service to Luton Airport Parkway. Semi-fast Thamelinks take 30 or so minutes, stopping Thameslinks take 40</small</p>
