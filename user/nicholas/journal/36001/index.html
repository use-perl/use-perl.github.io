<div class="span8">
<p><p>After <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/nicholas/journal/35997">the pub after dim sum</a>, as it was a nice day, I decided to take the scenic route and walk back to an Underground station via the Thames path, as I a few years back <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/nwclark/">I</a> used to share a house in Kenyon Street with <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/kake/">Kake</a>, <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/jchin/">doop</a> and HoggyÃ¢â¬Â </p>
<p>First thing of interestÃ¢â¬Â¡ was that the 100m detour round 30m of (seeming) <a href="http://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&ll=51.487325,-0.227097&spn=0.00081,0.003195&t=h&z=19">"temporary" car park</a> may be about to go! The wooden fences around it are gone, replaced by mesh, and the hard surface has been grubbed up, although the rubble is not yet gone. Hopefully it will be be moved inland, swapping space with the current inland detour of the Thames Path.</p>
<p>Next thing of interest was that the 3 geraniums my mother gave me that I planted out in I guess 2003 are still in the front garden of 75 Kenyon Street. Geraniums don't like frost, and I chose to plant them out in the full expectation that I was condemning them to an early death, as they would not survive their first winter. That they did, even including one day noticing a thin layer of settled snow on their leaves, I can only put it down to being in a sheltered location, close to the front wall.</p>
<p>Third thing of interest, and some sad inevitability, is that <a href="http://streetmap.co.uk/streetmap.dll?G2M?X=523658&Y=176983&A=Y&Z=1">the post office</a> is under threat of closure. "Don't worry" implies the happy helpful corporate post office poster in the window, there are lots of post offices conveniently not closing, and then gives the location of two others, which I assume are the nearest, and both seemed to be well over a mile away. G-reat. In turn, the owners/operators of this post office had their own poster up asking people to write in to explain why they objected to it closing, and a picture of a lot of important looking (or at least trying to look important) people standing outside said self-same post office. After a bit of time I worked out why they looked familiar - one was David Cameron, so I infer that another was the local Conservative MP, who won the seat from Labour at the last election, and I guess that they are making themselves seem useful in the hope of getting him re-elected.</p>
<p>Apart from that, Fulham are still at Craven Cottage (and given that originally they only applied for 3 years' planning permission, I guess that they must have got that extended). I wonder how their plans for a new stadium are doing, and whether there will be a big dent in that if they fall off the Premiership at the end of the season.</p>
<p><small>Ã¢â¬Â  We never managed to persuade him that he really really needed to write something and upload it to CPAN.</small></p>
<p><small>Ã¢â¬Â¡ to about 3 people reading this.</small></p>

4, actually. Talk about the end of an era! I've walked around that thing a bunch of times and it always annoyed me.</p>
