<p><p>Most strange. A fire engine just drew up outside my house. Even stranger,
this was the house that it was trying to visit. My house backs onto the railway
right next to Grove Park station, and there had been a call about a fence on
fire. I checked. My fence was not on fire. This is good.</p>
<p>However the fence flambÃÂ© was located a bit further back, and the fire engine
reversed down about 12 houses to attend to it. Given that the other side of the
fence is the railway line, complete with moving trains and live conductor rail,
they tackled the fire by taking a ladder and hose through the house, carefully
pointing water over the fence, without stopping the trains.</p>
<p>All out now, fun and excitement safely over. Although one of the fireman
said with everything so tinder dry they are likely to be dealing with vegetation
fires like this until October. So not that fun or exciting really.</p></p>
