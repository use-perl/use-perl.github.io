<li>The road out of London Bridge bus station is nose to tail buses</li>
<li>London Bridge northbound is a long traffic jam</li>
<li>London Bridge southbound (away from Canon Street) is a long traffic jam, presumably due to all the buses queuing to get into London Bridge bus station</li>
<li>Morgate is nice and quiet. (All the traffic is held up somewhere back on London Bridge)</li>
<li>Everything crams together so much that even the motorbikes are having trouble squeezing through the spaces. Heck, even the mountain bikes don't fit.</li>

<h2>Brompton++</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Dom2/">Dom2</a> on 2005-08-15T14:44:56</h3>
<p>My brompton is equally thin, and I'm very grateful for it.  I didn't realise quite how thin until I took my mountain bike to work one day.  All of a sudden I had to stop before taking out people's wing mirrors...  Now that would never do.  We mustn't be rude at these people in their huge vehicles taking up the <em>ENTIRE F**KING ROAD</em>, just to transport little Johnny to school.  Oh no.

<h2>handlebars</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/domm/">domm</a> on 2005-08-15T16:23:03</h3>
Even though my handlebars are wider than those found on racing bikes I manage to squeeze through traffic quite well. A bigger hindrance is the child seat that's still on my bike (even though Samo is riding his own bike since several years).<br><br>There are very few things nicer than speeding past cars in a jam (or even in slow-moving city traffic)<br><br>
