<p><p><a href="http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl6.language/2007/03/msg27322.html">Perl 6 now has <code>rat</code>s.</a>* Rocket will like Perl 6. :-)</p>
<p>We went into the park, because it doesn't seem like a great idea going into
the woods when it is windy. Rocket found a very interesting clump of reeds,
which he bounced around. After a minute, a rat popped out, jumped into the
stream, swam a short distance downstream, and disappeared under the bank.
Rocket, on the other side of the reeds, didn't notice this, but after a bit of
a false start I was able to convince him to investigate the new hiding place,
he detected the smell of rat, and then spent several minutes with his nose in
the holes in the bank, barking and growling at the bank, and trying to work out
how to dig into to the bank, all the time standing in the stream. In the end,
we weren't getting anywhere so I convinced him to walk further down the
stream to find more rats.</p>

<p>Another clump of reeds by the stream proved to be very interesting, worth
of bouncing round and jumping through. After a bit of this, standing on the
far bank of the stream, I spotted the rat jump into the stream, and swim
underwater up to a clump of reeds actually in the stream. Try as I might, I
couldn't convince Rocket that these reeds were now interesting, and where the
rat was hiding; instead he kept jumping round and through the initial clump.
Crafty second rat - by swimming under water it left no scent.</p>

<p><small>* presumably conversion of <code>rat</code>s to <code>int</code>s
is based on the "three blind mice" principle.</small></p></p>
