<p><p>My went to Weymouth yesterday, on a train that was full of
<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_2/6437175.stm">Millwall
fans going to Bournmouth</a>. Not the best at geography, are these Millwall
fans, because when the train got to Vauxhall, a huge cheer went up because
"at last we're south of the fucking river again". Even if they weren't good
at geography, being good at keeping their eyes open would have sufficed, as
it's pretty difficult to cross the river above ground without noticing.</p>
<p>Likewise, if they were any good at their geography or their club history,
they would know that Millwall is actually north of the river. Millwall FC moved
south in 1910, three years before Arsenal moved north.</p>
<p>Which reminds me of the time boarded a train and found it full of Arsenal
fans, all looking very glum. It seemed best not to say anything, on the
assumption that their team had lost. Later I found out that they'd beaten
Charlton Athletic something like 5-0. Strange. Do they do happy?</p></p>
