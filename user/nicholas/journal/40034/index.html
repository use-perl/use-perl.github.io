<p><p>So, this morning on the way in, the (4 wheel drive) Suzuki in front of me was trying to pull away from me at some traffic lights, but was having trouble because its right rear wheel was spinning. Me, on a <b>racing bike</b> behind it had no problems.</p>
<p>Some vehicles serve no purpose.</p>

<p><small>Context - It snowed last night. There's a couple of inches* of snow, and unlike last time, none of the roads have been gritted. Grr.</small></p>
<p><small>* For people outside the UK, the correct unit conversion for snow is <b>1 inch</b> == <b>1 metre</b>. This will make everything make sense.</small></p></p>

<p>I am in the USA.  What is this "meter" business.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-P<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/duck</p><p>More seriously didn't you mean to tell people to convert "couple inches" into "several centimeters"?  Because, unless we Americans have really mangled English units, an inch is nowhere near a meter.</p>

<p>No, I was very precise. I wrote <cite>correct unit conversion <b>for snow</b> </cite>, to reflect on how the UK (fails to) cope with even the slightest amount of snow.</p>

<p>The inability of the UK to cope with snow is directly connected to the overall climate and is hardly unique.</p><p>I guarantee that large parts of the USA (eg the Pacific Northwest and Virginia) are similarly incapable of handling even small amounts of snow.  By contrast there is only one place in Canada which is unable to handle snow.  (That would be Victoria, BC.  It has a combination of rare snow due to warm, wet climate, with a tendency towards wet snow combined with steep geography with many residents who moved from locations with dry snow and flat geography.  The result can be..amusing.)</p>

Not all vehicles that hippies scream about being EVIL FOUR WHEEL DRIVES in fact have four wheel drive.  Plenty don't at all, and in some it's selectable, so may have been turned off in this case.  In any case, it's an indictment of the driver, not the vehicle.<br/><br/>Also if you're riding a bike with tiny skinny tyres, you're probably putting a lot more pressure on the road, so (ignoring tyre tread design) will get a better grip.
