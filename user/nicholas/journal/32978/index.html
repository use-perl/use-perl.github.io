<p><p>It seems that there has been more than one person take a job somewhere,
partly on the basis that they saw me there and thought it would be good to
work with me, only for them to discover that I was leaving, or had left.
In one case I know this because he said this to me, as part of "sorry to learn
that you are leaving". In other cases, it seems that HR departments have been
pimping the job based on the fact that I was there. Pimping me as an asset
makes me uncomfortable, and in turn I feel a bit bad that I've (unintentionally)
disappointed people, by (unwittingly) endorsing products.</p>

<p>But if there's a lesson here, then it's <b>talk to me</b>. Or anyone else
you were thinking it would be fun to work with. You will learn things, and
as a consequence make more informed decisions; better decisions. But remember:
</p>

<blockquote>All jobs are equal. But some jobs are more equal than others.</blockquote>
<p>And the trick is finding the ones that suck in the ways that you can cope
with, so that you can be happy and productive.</p></p>
