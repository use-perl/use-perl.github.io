<p><blockquote>Mr Obama drank a Bud Light, Mr Gates a Sam Adams Light, Sgt Crowley a Blue Moon, and Mr Biden a non-alcoholic Buckler.</blockquote>
<URL:http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/8176925.stm>

<p>One of these things is not like the other. But I'm not sure which. I initially assumed:<pre>
Not Beer <-- Bud Light -- Buckler -- Sam Adams Light -- Blue Moon --> Beer</pre>
or even<pre>
Bud Light             <-- Not Beer -- Buckler -- Sam Adams Light -- Blue Moon --> Beer</pre>

but then it turns out that Buckler is owned by Heineken International, so I'm not sure. Also, whilst I've tried and quite like Sam Adams, I've no idea whether Sam Adams Light is comparable, or vile. And, heck, Blue Moon, it seems, is from Coors, but knows that would damage its credibility, so tries to hide it.</p>
<p>I don't know. There is decent American beer, but why does everyone try hide it?</p></p>

<p>A <a href="http://www.masson.us/blog/?p=5374" title="masson.us">blog</a masson.us> I read had some interesting comments about the beer as well.</p><p>If Gates drank Sam Adams Light at least it was an American owned beer company compared the rest. As much as I like most of Sam Adams' brews, Light is not really among them.</p><p>The President should have had a hometown beer, Old Style or even better a Goose Island.</p><p><a href="http://xkcd.com/617/" title="xkcd.com">XKCD</a xkcd.com> has a good take on this as well.</p><p>Then again as much of a beer geek/snob as I am I won't beat someone up to much over their choice of beer. Well, for politicians I would hope they would chose a beer from best represents their constituents/district.</p>



<h2>Beer from a big company?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ajt/">ajt</a> on 2009-08-01T13:45:13</h3>
<p>I lived in the US for three years and it's fair to say almost all the "beer" I had there wasn't in any way good. It was mostly over chilled, fizzy pop with a ethanol in it. In one or two places I found decent beer but that was alas by far and away in the minority.</p><p>Having said that a lot of so called beer in the UK isn't much better, it's synthetic fizzy pop with ethanol added and sold far too cold for you to taste anything. I would say that decent beer is perhaps more common in the UK than it use to be and than it is in the US.</p><p>I don't like larger, which is far more common in the US than proper beer, so I have a biased opinion. However people I knew out in the US who did drink and like larger were pretty dismissive of the common commercial beers available in the US.</p><p>Is there any large brewer that produces a decent beer?</p>



<h2>those beers</h2>

<p>Coors owns Blue Moon, but that doesn't stop it from being a decent beer.  (Microsoft makes Xbox.)</p><p>Sam Adam's Light is okay.  Some people only drink light beer, and if you're one of them, Sammy isn't a bad choice.</p><p>I can only assume Obama either (a) doesn't have good taste in beer or (b) picked something he figured lots of people would identify with.  I'm not sure which I option like less.</p><p>Meanwhile, yesterday I picked up another case of beer from my favorite brewery, Victory, right here in eastern Pennsylvania.  Today, I'm going to try to get a sampler of more of their beers.  I hope more people try good American beer and find out how very good it can be.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...hey, what about (c) Obama knew that anything he ordered could cause a rush of Obama nuts ordering the beer, and didn't want to overwhelm any microbrew... and he hadn't realized, initially that Bud was now foreign-owned... yeah.  Let's try to believe that one!</p>
