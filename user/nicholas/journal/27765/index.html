<div class="span8">
<p><p>So at work we have this nice flexible photocopier/printer/scanner/even fax machine (I think) that just works. Send it jobs over the network of your choice, and printout soon appears. A3 or A4, all is happy.</p>
<p>Only today someone sent a job on US Letter just ahead of of mine. I tried to figure out how to get the printer to print it on A4. It's not obvious. I fed a sheet into the manual load and said "It's letter, honest", to which the printer replied "The guides aren't in the right place for letter. Please move them".</p>
<p>Gah! It's smarter than me. Failing also to find a way in the UI to say "put this job on hold", the only way I could find to get my printout out was to cancel the offending job. Grr.</p>
<p>At least it's not the Sun compiler documentation from around the time of Solaris 2.3 that came as a Postscript file. Formatted for US Letter, obviously. If you sent it to the printer and expected it to "jam" (until you pressed shift continue - being an HP Laserjet the UI was small and comprehensible), instead what you got was a neat printout on A4 saying roughly "you don't have US Letter in this printer. Please load the printer with US Letter paper and try again"</p>
<p>Fortunately I don't think that those culpable work for Sun any longer.</p></p>

Our jobs queue up behind A3/A4 print jobs if I  (or whomever) forget to "scale to US Letter" in the print dialog.<br><br>I think we do get an option on our HP all-in-ones to force print to the current paper size while it's flashing LOAD A4, but I'm not certain.<br><br>Cheers,<br><br>
