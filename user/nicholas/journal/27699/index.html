<p><dl><dt>Observation</dt><dd>Our end of holiday year is December 31st. Consequentially we have some people taking lots of days off to use up their remaining paid leave. It's also coming close to winter, which means that we also have people off sick due to heavy colds. Some days these combine to make us a bit thin in some departments.</dd>
<dt>Conclusion</dt><dd>Given that we can't move winter, maybe it would be worth moving the end of holiday year to April or thereabouts.</dd></dl></p>

Or of course relax the rules about rolling over holidays.<br><br>(Or have managers monitoring holidays taken during the year before it becomes a problem, though that's obviously more work<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

<blockquote><div>Or of course relax the rules about rolling over holidays.</div></blockquote>
<p>I thought about this, but I don't think that it would work. If you increase the fixed number of days you can take, it buys you one year until people hit the same problem. If you remove the limit then it can cause some people to accrue enormous amounts of holiday that they then (not unreasonably) want to take, possibly in sufficiently dense blocks that it causes some problems. Particularly as now they're more experienced, and more knowledgeable about how the organisation works.</p>
<blockquote><div>(Or have managers monitoring holidays taken during the year before it becomes a problem, though that's obviously more work<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</div></blockquote>
<p>I'm not convinced about this either. In addition to your observation about more work, it's also the case that people who don't need to take holiday earlier prefer to save it up in case of a "rainy day". Trying to cajole people to take it earlier may not work.</p>

<h2>In Denmark ...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/tagg/">tagg</a> on 2005-11-22T22:02:49</h3>
Here in Denmark, the holiday year ends April 30th. But it doesn't remove the thinning, it just means the last part of April is very quiet here and there, in addition to the cold-related thinning around now... including<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/me - &lt;sniffle/&gt;.



<h2>The other solution</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Alias/">Alias</a> on 2005-11-23T00:01:04</h3>
Of course, here in the South we have Christmas + New Years + School (Summer) Holidays all on top of each other. So from New Years Eve until the 7th of January we just pretty much shut the country down, and you can pretty much assume nobody will be at work.<br><br>Seems to work well enough.



<h2>Re-baseline calendar to hire date.</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Louis_Wu/">Louis_Wu</a> on 2005-11-23T21:46:18</h3>
At Boeing all of these calculations are based upon your "Anniversary Date", which is essentially [1] the day you hired in.  So my vacation/sick days expire on the day <b>I</b> hired into the company, while yours expire on <b>your</b> hire date, 6 months later.  There is still a bit of bunching, with the ends of school terms likely being the biggest concentrations, but it seems to work.

<p>
[1] "Essentially" because if you had a coop, or a sabatical, or maternity leave, or left the company and came back, it's adjusted to an equivilant date to give you your total time in service in a continuous block.</p>
