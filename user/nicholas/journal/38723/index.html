<p><p>Ted Leung wrote about <a href="http://www.sauria.com/blog/2009/03/28/the-pycon-summits/">The Pycon Summits</a>. A couple of things interested me. Emphasis mine:</p>
<blockquote>The largest discussion during that section, was of course, the roadmap for 2.x versus 3.x, and how to encourage people to move from 2.x to 3.x. It looks like there is (good) reluctance to keep the 2.x series moving forward, so there may be a long (possibly infinitely long) gap between 2.7 and 2.8. At the same time, it seems clear that 3.1, which is currently in alpha, will be the first truly usable release in the 3.x line. The goal is to get 3.1 out pretty quickly and deprecate 3.0 - an odd and one time practice for the Python community. There was also a discussion of what could be done to help library and framework developers jump to 3.x. One concrete outcome was agreement to start work on <strong>a 3to2 tool which would allow developers to develop on 3.x and then backport to 2.x</strong>, thus helpoing developers to flipp their effort into (in my opinion) the correct release stream</blockquote>
<blockquote>I am also happy to see that they are going to tackle removal of PythonÃ¢â¬â¢s global interpreter lock (GIL).</blockquote>
<p>I'd already commented on the latter <a href="http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2009-03/msg00719.html">on p5p</a>, but I'll repeat the relevant part:</p>
<p>I'm curious how the plan to get rid of the global interpreter lock pans out, and what has
changed since <a href="http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2001-August/017099.html
">Greg Stein tried it, and got a 60% slowdown for unthreaded code</a>
(on platforms with fast threading primitives), something that Gudio was not
going to accept back.</p>

<p>Also, I'll repeat here the interesting comment on the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/unladen-swallow/wiki/ProjectPlan">Unladen Swallow project plan page</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
    Here at Red Hat we use Python for a lot of things. What we've observed
    is that execution performance is not the main issue (although it
    improving it would be greatly appreciated), rather it's the memory
    footprint which is the problem we most often encounter. If anything can
    be done to reduce the massive amount of memory Python uses it would be a
    huge win. I would encourage you to consider memory usage as just as
    important a goal as execution speed if you're going to tackle optimizing
    CPython.

<p>Memory usage is something that Perl 5.10 already addresses.</p></p>

<h2>Memory performance</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/educated_foo/">educated_foo</a> on 2009-03-30T16:56:10</h3>
<p>This is something a lot of people don't seem to get -- CPU and disk are all but free in our era of 2GHz+ chips and terabyte drives, but memory (and cache) are a huge bottleneck.  The limiting factors in many programs I write (bioinformatics) are memory and sometimes address space, not CPU time or disk space; and my most frequent source of UI irritation is not waiting for the CPU, but waiting for an application that has been paged out.  Yet we see man-years devoted to ever-more-complicated CPU schedulers and file compression algorithms, while language runtimes become increasingly complex and approximate LRU remains the state of the art in virtual memory management.</p><p>So thanks for your time spent reducing Perl's memory footprint.  I wish more people were focused on memory usage.</p>

<p>I think this just goes to show you how different problems needs different optimizations. I mainly work on web applications and in those instances we are mostly concerned with Disk performance, CPU and network, not memory. Withy 64bit boxes all over the place having 16GB+ memory is pretty common. So memory is never my problem and I appreciate all the work that's been put into making CPUs faster.</p>

<p>This really surprises me.  From my admittedly outdated experience, I would have guessed that you would either be network-bound or, with too many simultaneous (slow) connections, memory-bound.  What's sucking up all that CPU?  Is it the kernel copying buffers around, or your app generating a bunch of dynamic content?</p>

<p>We do have a lot of IO bound issues (especially with the DB) and most of our content is dynamic. Since we try to minimize the load on the shared resources (the DB) it means we push the computation into the web servers as much as possible, so having fast executing code is nice.</p><p>Memory is so cheap so throwing a few extra gigs into a box is a non-issue. I've never found myself thinking "wow I wish Perl used less memory". Again, this is just my experience with the kinds of applications I develop.</p>
