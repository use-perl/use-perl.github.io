<p><p>So <a href="http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2009-05/msg00682.html">Richard mailed this to p5p</a>, and it made me wonder, what's the shortest word ladder to get from <code>ping</code> to <code>perl</code>. <i>i.e.</i></p>
<blockquote><pre>+-+-+-+-+
|p|e|r|l|
+-+-+-+-+
| | | | |
+-+-+-+-+
...
+-+-+-+-+
| | | | |
+-+-+-+-+
|p|i|n|g|
+-+-+-+-+
</pre></blockquote>

<p>Well, the theoretically optimal word ladder would only change 1 letter at a time, so would
have to be
<blockquote><pre>+-+-+-+-+
|p|e|r|l|
+-+-+-+-+
|p| | | |
+-+-+-+-+
|p| | | |
+-+-+-+-+
|p|i|n|g|
+-+-+-+-+
</pre></blockquote>
<p>but I don't think that that's doable. (in English, at least).</p>
<p>So, suggestions for short but amusing ladders?</p>
<p><small>I found all these <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_drawing_characters#Unicode">really nice Unicode box drawing characters</a> but they don't seem to work on my Firefox. Fixed width fonts don't seem to be fixed width :-(</small></p></p>

Why are you making the detour from "peck" to "pick"?

<p>Using my<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/usr/share/words/dict I found 3 different 5 word "solutions".  However I disagreed with the dictionary on whether pino and penk are really English words.

<p>&gt;</p><p>The original Unix* usr/dict/words file was always skewed by Bell Labs terminology. The crossword fanciers' online dict files are usually better for word puzzles.

<p>Sensitive how?  If perl is not in your dictionary, then reversing the two will result in your never finding perl.  If there are multiple paths, reversing can change which path you find.  Otherwise it should run forwards as well as backwards.</p><p>It admittedly lacks when it comes to efficiency.  However given that most of the time on my machine was scanning the file, I didn't care to optimize.</p>

<p>Even if Perl is in dict, starting at perl is faster since it has fewer adjacent ladder words, so search tree starts less bushy (and on average will reamain so), and more next-move-win states since ping has more adjacency.</p><p>Most of the time shouldn't be in file scan unless your machine has no disk cache or the program ran correctly the first and only time! With cache, I am seeing 124ms on building %is_word with a small dict, twice as much loading half dozen dicts including moby. Oh wait, I made one small tweak to achieve that<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...</p><p>my $n = length($start ); # add<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...<br>while () {<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; chomp();<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; next unless length() == $n; # add<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; $is_word{lc($_)}++;<br>}</p><p>the cost of rebalancing the much smaller hash is much less. To build a full dict is more like 5000ms, so yes, tha would be dominating. Don't hash what you don't need!</p><p>maybe tonight or weekend i can bench some otheralgos, eg the meet in the middle / alternate ends  strategy and the grep f($word), keys tactic.  Need something better to try to answer if there is ANY connection from<br>
