<p><p>I've now discovered what the police tactical firearms unit are there to do outside the <a href="http://maps.google.co.uk/?ie=UTF8&ll=51.516081,-0.101565&spn=0.001496,0.003353&t=h&z=19&om=1">Old Bailey</a>. Previously I've just seen them standing around, chatting, watching, waiting. This morning walking up Warwick Lane I could see a crowd of people. I wondered if they were queuing to get into the court's public gallery. But on turning the corner it turned out that they were all waiting, as was all the traffic. The wiry old men and short smiley women with rifles at the ready were standing in the road, securing the area outside the building. No-one said anything; everyone waited. Then a police car drove up, another officer (with another rifle) got out, went over to the side, motioned something, and announced "thank you". And everyone moved on.</p></p>
