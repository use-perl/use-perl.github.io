<p><p>So I turned on my radio on Friday, and now that The Now Show has finished, I was expecting The News Quiz. Only it wasn't. It was something called <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00m44s1">I Guess That's Why They Call It The News</a>. Eh? Anyway, I decided to try it out. After about 5 minutes, I didn't think that I was enjoying it, but thought that this wasn't totally fair on it, so decided to stick it out for 30 minutes minimum.</p>
<p>On Saturday was doing the washing up when it was repeated. Now, usually, I will listen again to The Now Show or The New Quiz, so I turned it on. I listened for about five minutes, then turned it off. It was preferable to wash up in silence.</p>
<p>I talked with my father. He didn't like it either. So it's not just me.</p>
<p>I think that the problem was that is was neither sufficiently scripted, nor sufficiently improvised. The Now Show is scripted, rehearsed, and performed by a regular team. They can produce some wonderful surreal humour, and some biting satire. The News Quiz isn't scripted - the panel have no idea which questions they are going to ask, but in the unscripted mÃÂªlÃÂ©e, they can produce some wonderful surreal humour, and biting satire. This programme had neither, despite the fact that its chair, Fred MacAulay, is often very funny on The News Quiz. Doing the washing up is preferable to it.</p></p>
