<p><p>Whilst walking back in the dusk from the park, something went thump into the
insole of my right walking boot. I looked down, and I'd just been head-butted
by a frog. Silly thing. Lucky thing, more like, as if it had been a bit faster
it would have been under my boot, rather than slamming into it.</p>

<p>Given that currently it seemed keen on continuing off the pavement, into
the road; a route which only leads to more flats, grass, but a distinct lack
of water features, I decided that it would be best to forcibly revise its route
planning for it, and carry it back to the park. However, recalling that frogs
are prone to pee when picked up, I attempted to lure it onto a piece of
cardboard [quite a bit of free rubbish nearby :-(], which proved harder than I
hoped, as trying to sneak up on it with the cardboard merely resulted in frog
herding. Getting it to the park this way would have been very slow. [Mmm, but
probably faster than the delivery for the thermos for the coffee machine in the
office. Maybe it's being hopped over from Switzerland by carrier-frog].
Fortunately the frog wasn't clever enough to avoid getting trapped between the
cardboard and a wall, with which I had it up. Unsurprisingly, for the whole of
the journey the persistent little thing tried to find a way to hop off the
cardboard, but to no avail. [Last night I'd been herding ferrets*, and they're
faster than frogs, so the frog doesn't stand a chance]. By the end I was
carrying the frog in my hand, because it hadn't let rip yet, and I so I assumed
that if it was nervous, it didn't have any left. Either that, or it still
assumed that it was on cardboard, and so "knew" not to. :-)</p>
<p><small>* Said ferret, <i>Frettchen</i>, likes beer, and will happily climb
into a glass to drink the last drops, or enthusiastically lick it from your
fingers. I presented her with a finger dipped in perry last night. Her reaction
was priceless - came up to the finger, then backed away "euugh", faster than a
CAMRA member from a product of Anheuser-Busch.</small></p>
