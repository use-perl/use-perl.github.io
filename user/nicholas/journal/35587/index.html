<p><p>So, I was reading the perl source code, as you do. And there were was all
this code that did automatic changing of of magic types as objects went
through their lifetimes. Or scalars were upgraded. Or something. And there were
comments about how it assigned to a variable <code>${^THUMB}</code>, as an
interim measure until something was changed. And it was all written by,
inevitably, Ilya.</p>
<p>And then I woke up, and found out that it was all a dream. But a dream with
all the correct braces and indentation. <i>Waaaaaaaaa.</i> I can't even get
away from it in my sleep.</p>
<p>Mind you, I should have realised that it was a dream given the
uncharacteristic length and clarity of the comments in code by the said
contributor.</p></p>

Interesting that you mention this.  I recently had a dream about some changes I was planning on making to cperl-mode.el.  All the syntax-highlighting and insane regexes were there, and whaddaya know, it's Ilya code too.  What a world<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

Lisp warps your brain; but in this case, not in a good way.
