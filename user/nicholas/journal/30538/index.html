<div class="span8">
<p><p>We keep hearing that it's really hard to find decent Perl people, yet from the
other side it seems that it's really hard to find decent Perl jobs. Now it may
be a bit of blinkers issue here on both sides, as certainly the recruiting
problem is more general - it's hard to recruit good people full stop, and
likewise it's wrong to think that one tool is good for every job, but I
believe it fair to assume that there are some jobs for which Perl is the best
tool, or at least a good enough tool to get the job done, which in the end is
what counts, hence there should exist "Perl" jobs.</p>

<p>So what's going on here? On Thursday at the london.pm social there were
perhaps half a dozen good people considering their next move, looking for jobs
that will stretch them, jobs that involve programming challenges breaking new
ground, rather than just productively churning out many effective but samey
websites. And like me when I was recently looking they don't see anything. I
have contacts in a couple of banks that are recruiting (or at least they'd
like to recruit me) but banks aren't for everyone (I have my reasons for
thinking that I'd go mad at one, hence I politely turn them down). But apart
from that we all see roughly the same jobs cycling round <a
href="http://jobs.perl.org/">jobs.perl.org</a>
it seems that many who advertise for "senior perl person" actually want
"experienced website maker". Yes, you want a good person who can work without
close supervision. But no, you don't actually want a senior person in the
traditional sense of the rÃÂ´le - a person who leads and mentors a team of
juniors. Many of these jobs would be in small to zero team, with no career
progression upwards, and they are small companies so there no career
progression sideways*. In addition, many of these jobs these are not in
companies that rely on a technical edge for their profits, so the job is about
getting non techies' things done, rather than out innovating the
competition. Some of the agents try to make jobs look sexy by using more
buzzwords, but the sort of calibre people they're looking to recruit were
(un)employed in 2001, so see through hype.</p>

<p>Yes, there are a few other jobs out there, and some of the people advertising
them may even be reading this. But if they're asking for a minimum of 2 years
experience and the offered salary range is only ÃÂ£5000, then they're hardly
thinking about recruiting someone with 8-10 years' experience**, and unlikely
to be able to really take advantage of those extra skills that person would
bring. It seems that we have the <a
href="http://www.winemag.co.za/content/webletter/2003/dec05.htm">King Louie problem</a>.</p>

<p>And maybe I'm being a bit arrogant here in some of my assumptions, but even
when I was looking for a job a few months ago I was surprised and disappointed
that no-one in London seemed to be interested in hiring the current pumpking.
Do I know Perl? Well, um, you're probably running a version I released - does
that answer the question? Can I diagnose and solve your obscure problems, test
and refactor your code, benchmark, profile and optimise your system (and not
necessarily by micro-optimising the code)? Hell yes. If your HR department
cares more that I have a degree than experience even now, will that be a
problem? No! Is my written English going to let you down?  Well, you're still
reading piece, aren't you? And yet still no-one in London (other than one
friend in a bank) was trying to recruit me. At least 3 people wanted me to
apply for jobs and move to the US, but nothing or nowhere so exciting that I
had a U-turn on my "I like London" policy.</p>

<p>So I'm starting to think that there's a bit of a myth here. There may well be
employers looking for good people who know Perl to do jobs. But these are jobs
that would suit 9-5 programmers who need to pay a mortgage and feed a family,
people with a Chinese wall in their head to divide work from play. And how many
good Perl people do you know like that? The best Perl people are passionate.
And probably that's why the jobs remain as vacancies - because your spec is
impossible to fill. If you really want good people then you need to make it
clear that you will stretch them, rather than taking a dull job and trying to
tart it up with this month's buzzwords.</p>

<p>Or maybe we should temporarily forget our principles, and <a
href="http://flickr.com/photos/obra/199214978/">make hay while the sun
shines</a>.</p>

<p><small>* I've had an e-mail exchange with one person advertising one of
these jobs - a nice polite chap who was honest and confirmed that I was
accurate in assessment of the job behind his advert and therefore why it was
not for me. From the qualities he demonstrated in that exchange I'd love to
work for him, but not in that company simply because of the sort of jobs that
it can('t) offer.</small></p>

<p><small>** If you wish to argue with that one, consider that someone who was
on ÃÂ£25,000 after two years and had a 3% rise each year would be on ÃÂ£30,000 at
eight years.  So that's ÃÂ£5000 just for sitting at the same level for 6
years. And we're not talking about those sort of people, or those sort of
salaries.</small></p>

<h2>I haven't had a problem either way</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/TeeJay/">TeeJay</a> on 2006-08-05T19:54:37</h3>
6 months ago I was able to walk out of a job, and find another senior role, with better pay, prospects and technology (including R&amp;D and possible decent training), and they were a good outfit to work for.<br><br>Unfortunately I had to leave because of problems with my wife's health that required me to work from home - although they were very reasonable and if it wasn't so bad I could probably have stayed.<br><br>Anyway - I found a contractor position where I was able to work from home pretty quickly, and although I may complain on irc about the usual problems you have in development it's not your usual web stuff but interesting, complex and challenging problems and interesting clever people.<br><br>Since I've been there I've been looking at finding additional contractors and not had a problem finding reasonably skilled people, despite the rural location (devon, but mostly tele-working) and (relatively) low rates.<br><br>Of course this is just anecdotal, but so is the griping about how hard it is. I guess people's expectations are too high and both employers and employees aren't prepared to compromise enough.



<h2>Middlemen...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ajt/">ajt</a> on 2006-08-06T19:01:15</h3>
<p>The problem isn't jobs or canditates, it's the arseholes in the middle that understand neither candidate or position, that screw everything up.</p>

<p>A friend at a major UK clearning bank told me off two positions at one of their major non-London data-centres. They need a "hacker", someone who is able to function on VAX, Solaris or Windows, someone with initiative, someone who is able to think and select the best tool and apply it rather than a thoughtless one solution fits all drone.</p>

<p>Management is in fits on how to describe the job, they talk the HR talk, but have no idea how to describe the job. My friend described the job description to me, and I though they need a hacker, but being a bank they can't say they want a hacker. At my place of work, we had a similar job, and I wanted to advertise for a hacker, but managment refused, so we put down a bland meanigless buzzword list, and the twits in the middle sent us all sorts of totally inappropiate candidates.</p>

<p>I know there are jobs out there, and I know there are suitable canidates, the hard bit is getting the right people to meet...</p>



<h2>Unix SA's have much the same problem</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/hfb/">hfb</a> on 2006-08-07T05:46:43</h3>
<p>
With more than 10 years experience, if you aren't in management or wanting to be on the management track, you either find jobs advertising for that 'senior' person who is either a glorified systems babysitter or up to their ass in alligators left behind by the last guy who was smart enough to get the hell out while the going was good before the music stops and the chairs are all gone. Even then, when you do get an interesting problem, many places just want the quick fix instead of the nuanced analysis and long-term solution to the problem. Experience makes it both easy and difficult.
</p>
<p>
These days, most normal companies can do everything they need with young kids who are a little green but make up for it with enthusiasm and google whereas 10-15 years ago you had to be sharp enough to either figure it out on your own or know where to start looking for clues and make educated guesses. I'm nearly convinced that senior tech staff who aren't management should consult instead of boring themselves to death with the a job as even if you do get bored, the paycheck can make up for it.

<h2>getting non-techies' things done</h2>

<blockquote> <div><i>
the job is about getting non techies' things done
</i></div> </blockquote>
<p>
This is something I've recently realized is why
I'm frustrated with how things are going in my life.
I'm not doing anything, I'm doing what enables others
to do things. And I think I'm smart/valuable enough
that I should be doing things.
