<p>I've been to work now for a week.  I'm still adjusting to the pace here.  It is defently a slow down from what I was used to.  And that's both a good and bad thing. <br/><br/>It's good because that means more work went into making everything stable and secure around here.  Problems arise and are dealt with.  People are working on projects most of the time.<br/><br/>It's bad because people appear to be lazy and un-disiplined.  They appear to just want to do the least amount of work to accomplish the goal without striving for the best result.  That sorta performance would be unacceptable in other shops.  I mean, Jesus help me, I've told twice today to 'pace myself' by a cow-orker of mine.<br/><br/>I was brought in in an effort to remedy this.  And I don't know what I think about that.  It would oh-so easy to slide into laziness, but I wouldn't feel good about myself.  But if I stick my head above the crowd in a 'high-speed, low-draft' performance, I'll earn the scorn of my cow-orkers.<br/><br/>Surely a reversal of fortune for this slacker.</p>
