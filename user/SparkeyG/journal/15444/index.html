<p>Well, I've got a new job.  I handed in my two weeks notice at my current employer, and can't wait to get to the new place.
<p>
It was kinda of odd walking into my managers office and handing him my letter.  Never had to do that before.  I was expecting him to show me the door, you know.  Every where else I had worked, at the time you gave your notice you were walked to the door and told your personal effects would follow.  But not here, he even asked if I could push back my last day.  I had planned in June to take two days off this week, and he wants me to stay <strong>two more</strong> days to make up for those.  Can you get an idea why I'm not two sad to leave this place?<p>
The next job is a Perl Programmer with Customer support duties.  I'm looking forward to it.  The customer base is internal and seems to be like all other financial industry customers I have dealt with in the past.  The perl is hard-core, and will surely force me to become a better programmer than I already am.
<p>
On a completely different note, this past weekend I went on a one-day bus trip to and back from Columbus, OH (8hrs one way) to watch the <a href="http://www.chicago-fire.com">Chicago Fire</a> get embarassed by the last place team in the conferance.  We fielded our second and third string players and lost 2-6, after giving up a 2-0 half-time lead.  Yeah, I know we had the season championship already wrapped up, but still there's pride to play for.</p>
