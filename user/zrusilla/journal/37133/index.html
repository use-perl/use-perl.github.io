Smolder  is a web-based app, written by Michael Peters of Plus Three, to aggregate (I keep wanting to say aggravate) smoke tests and display results and trends at a glance.  Smolder takes the tedium out of reading TAP by highlighting failure in a colorful way.   It also provides trend graphs, RSS feeds and emails.  TAP isn't hidden from you, though; you can download it.
</p><p>
<p> I am using Smolder to get the freebies--aggregation, pretty pictures, RSS and email--as part of a project to pull together a litter of tests into a coherent set of suites suitable for smoke testing.  There are more sophisticated uses of Smolder than mine.  Michael gave a talk on using Smolder with Buildbot at YAPC::NA 2008 to more fully automate your builds and tests. Invent your own fun integration to achieve your goals.</p>
<b>Installation notes</b>
<p>Smolder is a self-contained app, installing everything it needs, including an Apache server and CPAN dependencies, in its own directory.
</p><p>
I had to do a bit of fiddling to get it up and running on MacOSX and Ubuntu Hardy Heron, but the installer, based on Krang, is well-organized, easily subclassable and Perl-hacker friendly, so you can easily enshrine your fixes for your platform in code and send them back to Michael.
</p><p>
My major Debian-related issue was the lack of a libperl.so--the Smolder installer complained it found no libperl and exited.  You can either run<br/>
<code>$ apt-get install libperl-dev</code><br/>
or just make a symlink from libperl.so.5.x.x. to libperl.so by hand. Either works.
</p><p>
useradd also failed because on my platform -M should be -m.  Must remember to submit patch.
</p><p>
Also be sure libgd is compiled with TrueType support or your graphing will fail.
</p><p>

On MacOS X, I had to submit a patch for Leopard to create user and group since as of Leopard Apple abandoned NetInfo (<pre>nicl</pre>) for  Directory Services (<pre>dscl</pre>).

Also on Leopard, I'm having a most curious problem with libgd.  Leopard seems to HATE it. It hisses into the log:<br/>
<code>
The process has forked and you cannot use this CoreFoundation functionality safely. You MUST exec().
</code><br/>
Anyone else seen this message before?

<b>Where to find it</b>
