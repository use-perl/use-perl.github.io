<p><p>Well, it's been three weeks of misery.  I had an awful case of the flu, which later turned into pneumonia.  I've been on two rounds of antibiotics and lost about 20 pounds.  I still haven't fully recovered; I still have a cough and upper respiratory ickiness, but I'm in unbelievably good shape compared to where I was.</p>
<p>I tried to spend time relaxing, but it's the holidays, and I'd made promises to friends and family.  I managed to drive up to see my in-laws around Xmas.  New Year's eve I spent a few hours napping just so I could be awake at midnight and drink a toast.</p>
<p>I've gotten a pretty solid lead for some data warehousing work.  They asked me some really chump questions, but hey, if they sign the checks, they can ask anything they want.  Of course, they want to pay as little as possible, but I think I convinced them that quality costs money. ;-)</p>
<p>Still, I'm trying to savor being able to spend a little time at home.  Even if it is thru a filter of cough syrup and the buzz of the humidifier....</p></p>

I'm heading to the ER myself today with what I believe is a fairly advanced case of bronchitis in order to head off whatever nastiness would ensue.  Normally I'm not willing to go to the hospital for anything short of a third limb growing out of my back, but my job requires vocal clarity, and I called in sick Monday.  I can't do that again Friday.
<p>
Good luck with yours, and wish me luck with mine, please.</p>
