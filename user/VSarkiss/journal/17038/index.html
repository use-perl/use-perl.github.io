<p><p>Some recruiters are really aggravating.  Yesterday I applied for a contract job thru a site that makes you enter a text resume (don't even get me started on that disaster), then apply for jobs by clicking a link.  In other words, I don't have any control over what the recipient sees.</p>
<p>Yesterday I got a note from one:
<blockquote>Your resume wasn't attached.  Please send it in MS Word format.</blockquote>
I could see the generated email at the bottom of her note.  It contained my text resume....</p>
<p>In this day and age, with a new worm/virus spreading thru MS Word documents every day, I can't believe someone is saying, "Hello, random stranger, please send me email with the most common vector attached, so I can click on it."   I replied saying I don't send MS Word attachments thru email and sent a PDF instead.</p>
<p>Yes, I do want this gig, and it's so annoying to have know-nothings guarding the gates.</p></p>

<h2>RTF</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/gav/">gav</a> on 2004-01-27T14:53:54</h3>
RTF is perfect for sending things via email. The files are small, can't contain viruses, and you can even rename them to ".doc" so as not to confuse MS-Word users.

<p>Hmm, I'd thought about sending an RTF, but hadn't thought of renaming it to ".doc".  Good idea, I'll do that.  (Good thing OpenOffice.org will write RTF files....)</p>



<h2>RTF what?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/educated_foo/">educated_foo</a> on 2004-01-27T17:53:58</h3>
"RTF resume-at-the-end-of-your-own-email", perhaps?

<h2>Good Recruiters?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ajt/">ajt</a> on 2004-01-27T16:17:23</h3>
<p>Is there such a thing as a "Good Recruiter"?</p>

<p>Good luck with the job, even if you have to wade through a mire of incompetance to get there.</p>
