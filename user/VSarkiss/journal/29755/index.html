<p><p>I don't often write about deeply personal things in this journal.  Sometimes my entries are Perl or FOSS related, sometimes not.  But I think I need to write down some things for my own future reference.</p>
<p>Some may know I've fought depression off and on for many years, and for the last two or three years, I've gone thru a hard battle.  In September I tracked down a psychotherapist that I'd worked with successfully many years ago, and began seeing her regularly, sometimes as much as three times a week.  It's expensive and difficult, but it's starting to pay off.  A couple of weeks ago, I broke thru some tough issues, and my mood has lifted significantly.</p>
<p>I'm not out of the woods yet.  My current client assignment is very frustrating and un-rewarding, so it's compounding the problem.  When I have time to myself, I'm still tempted to hide in my cave rather than face the world.</p>
<p>I'd like this whole episode to be over.  I just want to celebrate and declare victory, but I can't -- not yet.  I've had success, but I still need to keep working at it.  Though my attitude's changed, I still need to get all my life's supports back together.</p>
<p>The most joyful thing in my life is still my family.  I'm hoping things will slow down in a few weeks when school lets out for summer.  My wife will be teaching summer session, which is not as time-consuming -- we hope -- so we'll have a little less pressure and more free time.</p>
<p>So as I turn the corner and continue trudging the road to happiness, I'll mark some mileposts here, to remind myself of my journey and progress.</p></p>

<p>You&#8217;re not the only one to have trodden that road. I know how difficult work it is. Me, now that I&#8217;m no longer in a bad place, I&#8217;ve lost some of the will to continue working onward and have been lingering, though I have a ways yet ahead of me. I&#8217;ll need to untangle a ball of interdependent problematic situations before it will seem compelling to resume grinding away at it, though. You seem to be making good progress; congrats.</p>

<p>Thanks for the encouragement.  I hope you find your way too.</p>
<p>As you said, sometimes the mundane and ordinary side of life is hardest to overcome.  To quote Chekhov: "Any idiot can face a crisis.  It is this day-to-day living that wears you out."</p>

Congratulations. After 15 of Freudian psychoanalysis myself I know something of what you're going through.<br>
