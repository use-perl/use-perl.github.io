<p><p>I haven't written here in a while, but I've been busy with <code>
@life = qw(kids family work health);
</code>Lazy lists would be really handy here...</p>
<p>At the moment, <code>$work</code> is a huge pain.  The customer's reporting environment is a mess, mainly due to a group of consultants they got here a couple of years ago from <code>$huge_report_vendor</code>.  We've been trying to clean it up but have been getting frustrated at every turn by the client's internal politics.  Now we've been sidelined in favor of -- you guessed it -- consultants from the original vendor that created the mess.  I'm relegated to administrative tasks of filling in metadata.  Spare brain cells, anyone?</p>
<p>Another pain I'm currently fighting is that the <a href="http://www.ftb.ca.gov">Franchise Tax Board</a> has lost one of my tax payments from last year.  Yesterday they sent me a letter threatening collection, even after I've sent them copies of the cancelled checks.  Argh!</p>
<p>What's going right is that our new puppy has been lots of fun.  We've been taking him to an off-leash dog park in our city, and he's been playing really nicely.  It's a lot of fun to watch.  Pictures soon.</p>
<p>But the best thing I've got going now is starting karate again.  Fitting two nights a week in my schedule was hard, but it's been worth it.  I've been going for a couple of months now, and I can finish warmups without getting out of breath -- sweaty and breathing hard, but not feeling like I'm going to keel over.  And of course, punching, kicking, and grappling are a terrific way to let off steam (in addition to ranting in a journal :-)</p></p>
