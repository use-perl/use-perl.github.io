<p><p>Well, summer's almost ending.  I had a terrific vacation with the family at a nice <a href="http://rrgetaways.com/">rental in the Russian River</a>.  The place is dog-friendly, so we introduced our pooch to kayaking -- he was a little unsure at first, but ended up loving it.  I've been "between projects" the last couple of weeks, so I've been having fun tracking down old friends (and making new ones) on LinkedIn.  Meeting people for lunch has been my main activity.</p>
<p>Things will probably change a lot next week.  After Labor Day, my daughters start school, and my wife begins to teach full-time at <a href="http://southhillshigh.com/">South Hills High 
School</a> (be gentle, that's a student- and teacher-maintained site).  Our closest friends, with whom we often traded pick-up and drop-off duties, are moving out of the area.  We'll miss them as well as having fewer logistical options.  And I'll probably start a project somewhere, hopefully either close to home, or with decent public transportation.</p>
<p>I'll enjoy the calm now, even while I watch the dark storm clouds gathering in the distance.</p></p>

<h2>The Russian River</h2>

<p>My father had a cabin on the Russian River when I was young.  Haven't been able to remember much about it but that link with the pictures brings back some memories.  What an awesome place.</p>
