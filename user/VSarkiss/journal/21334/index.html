<div class="span8">
<p><p>Last week, when people at my client were cleaning up their offices to move to their new location, the person I sit next to held up a 12-port network hub and said, "Well, I guess I won't need this anymore."   Then he got ready to throw it away.</p>
<p>Never one to see such waste, and having suffered long with poor old 4-port hubs, I volunteered to take the box home.  Always willing to help, you know.  (OK, so what I really said was, "Are you NUTS?  Gimme that.")</p>
<p>So now I no longer have to cascade my hub, and I even have a bunch of empty ports.  The thing works great, and I saved probably around $70.</p>
<p>Except for one small hitch: it has a fan, and it whines....  Whenever I pass the office now, I can hear its plaintive cry.  As I type this, it's giving its little nasal drone, like a kid with a stuffy nose who won't blow it.</p>
<p>I have a feeling I'll be taking the WD-40 to it this weekend.</p></p>

<h2>Hubs</h2>

You realize that hubs pretty much cost nothing today, if you can even get them, and unmanaged 100mbit ethernet switches cost 20 quid or so. Managed 100mbit switches cost slightly more and unmanaged gigabit switches can be had for 20 quid a port.

But this one cost <em>exactly</em> nothing.  That's what I like about it.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)
