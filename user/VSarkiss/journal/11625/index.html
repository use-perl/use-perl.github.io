<p><p>A pair of ducks (I think they're male and female) has taken a liking to my swimming pool.  They were here last year, but stopped showing up after a while, and now they're back.  They're pretty birds, but they poop all over the back yard (and in the pool too), so I chase them away when I see them.  After I added chlorine to the pool yesterday, I figured they wouldn't like the water any more, but they're back.  I suppose they're urbanized ducks and can stand chlorinated water.</p>
<p>So the list of critters I've seen so far in my back yard includes rabbits, skunks, racoons, feral cats, ravens, and hawks.  (Actually, I'm not sure  they're hawks, but they're some kind of raptor.)  I've seen and heard coyotes, but they haven't tried to get into my yard yet, thank goodness.</p>
<p>Maybe I should get a big dog.</p></p>

<h2>Rabbit Season!</h2>

Sorry, I had to.  Too many cartoons as a kid.<p>
It's pathological<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>

Maybe you need to see a puh-sychologist.

<p>Yeah, that was in the back of my mind when I wrote it.  I guess that's why I started thinking about the rabbits, but that led to thinking about other creatures, rather than to Elmer Fudd.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)</p>
<p>Heh.  Whenever my kids start to argue about something and it turns into a back-and-forth, all I have to do is yell "Duck Season" or "Rabbit Season" to break it up.</p>

<h2>Sopranos</h2>

After reading the first sentence did I immediately think of the Sopranos?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

You're not the only one, next thing you know there will be therapy, then strip clubs and butcher shops.
