<p><p>My Linux box (RH 7.3) came with MySQL and Postgres.  I used the MySQL mainly as backend for Everything2 and MovableType, and the Postgres just for goofing around.  (Well, I used E2 and MT just for goofing around also.) </p>
<p>Around March of this year I got DB2 UDB from the IBM web site and brought it up.  I used DB2 MVS <small><i>mumble</i></small> years ago and thought it was pretty nice, so I wanted to see what this version was like.  I've been told UDB is a totally different code line than the old MVS version.  Still, pretty nice.  I'm surprised it's not more popular.</p>
<p>Earlier this month it became clear at my client that I'd have to develop some pieces on Oracle, which I'd never used seriously.  So I went to Oracle and downloaded 9i to see if it came with any good documentation.  It didn't, but I figured I'd install it just for grins -- though I only got halfway through.  That thing's complicated and the online docs are pretty meager.</p>
<p>Monday I decided to start work on re-writing some Sybase scripts so I could contribute them to a Sybase DBA collection that someone I met through Perlmonks is putting together.  I realized I'd need a Sybase installation to test against, so I went to the Sybase web site, and lo and behold, you can get ASE 11.9.2 for Linux for development use.  So I grabbed it and brought it up last night.  (Having done some DBA work in the past helped....)</p>
<p>So have I missed anything??  Is there any Unix-compatible database out there that I don't have?  (I used to have MS SQL Server when I had a Win2k box -- before the hard disk started going and I decided to leave the dual-boot world.)</p>

You've missed mSQL, from hughes (which inspired MySQL).

<p>You've missed firebird, the ex-borland interbase thing.

</p><p>You've missed SAPdb thing which has been released as GPL recently (check slashdot stories).

</p><p>Sorry no links, I'm about to go home...

And don't forget <a href="http://www.hwaci.com/sw/sqlite/" title="hwaci.com">SQLite </a hwaci.com>. Matt Sergeant has written a <a href="http://search.cpan.org/author/MSERGEANT/DBD-SQLite-0.21/" title="cpan.org">DBD driver</a cpan.org> for it as well.

<p>And Informix.  Bought by IBM, though.  Is it still a separate product?</p>
