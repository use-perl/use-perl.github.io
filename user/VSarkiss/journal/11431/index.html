<p><p>I had wanted to write something in here every day this week, but obviously that takes more effort than I'd thought....</p>
<p>The week's shaping up nicely.  I walked for an hour yesterday, and today I drove my car for the first time in a week.  Walking was OK, but driving was uncomfortable, so I'll be staying home the full week.</p>
<p>I did finish the little patch for the monastery (the <a href="http://perlmonks.org/index.pl?node=Saints+in+our+book"> Saints in our book</a> page).  Very embarassing: <a href="/user/tye">Tye</a> told me the patched code, which I had tested offline, wouldn't even compile until he fixed a typo.  I looked around and realized I had tested the original code, not my patched version....</p>
<p>I tried to bring up my local installation of DB2 V7.1, which I'd started but not finished back in October of last year.  I remembered the admin password, but it complains about not having a license key, and I can't find it in the CDs.  This surgery appears to have caused Alzheimer's....</p>
<p>I just found out my new contract requires me to  take a drug test.  I suppose I may have to explain the painkillers.</p>
