<p><p>Over the last few months, I've gotten so used to <a href="http://adblock.mozdev.org">AdBlock</a> for Firefox that I'm surprised when I look over someone's shoulder and see all the bouncy ad banners and junk.</p>
<p>Now I'm starting to wish it had even more capabilities, like "take out the rightmost column of this table" or "block everything in this <code>div</code>".  (Sure I could write custom CSS to hide the divs with ads in them, but who wants to do that for every site?)</p>
<p>Is anybody working on an AnyBlock extension? :-)</p></p>

<h2>Remove any object</h2>

I seem to remember an extension that would remove any object from a page.  That object could be an image, table cell, and so on. I never got around to installing it though.<br> <br>I think the intent was to remove those annoying sidebars with all the google ads and so on. I just immediately look for the "printer friendly" versions.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

And of course besides Nuke Anything you can <a href="http://plasmasturm.org/log/244/" title="plasmasturm.org">use Firefox' builtin DOM Inspector to delete any part of the page or change CSS attributes or whatever else you want</a plasmasturm.org>. It's too clumsy for constant use, but sometimes the effort is worth it, like when you want to read something as long as, say, a Paul Graham article at a readable font size without being confined to his 400px column, or when you want to roll your own printer friendly version of a page, or stuff like that.

<h2>Installed adblock yesterday</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jdavidb/">jdavidb</a> on 2005-02-25T00:44:01</h3>
<p>I finally succumbed and installed adblock yesterday.  I've tried to be good about the ads, but I am just so annoyed by popups and anything that makes new windows and such.  And with the way some advertisers have learned to cheat and get around the popup blocking, I decided I was tired of being nice.</p>

<p>Previously I had one policy: let the ads alone to be nice, unless they show scantily clad women.  I know I'll be mocked for this, but I'm a one woman man, and I previously would use Firefox's builtin image blocking on any ad with a woman in a swimsuit or such.  (Pudge, if you're reading, this wiped out about 50% of slashdot's advertising awhile back.)</p>

<p>So yesterday I installed adblock and the enhanced tab browsing interface extensions at once.  I immediately blocked an adserver that I know has been putting up illicit popups.  And then today I decided I was fed up with the geocities ads that have gotten more intrusive (and won't close since I upgraded from 1.0PR to 1.0), so I blocked those, too.  Meanwhile, I set links to always open in the same tab instead of popping up new windows.  I'm in heaven!</p>

Whilst I don't personally care about naked women, what riles me is moving things on the screen.  Animated adverts are like having a 5 year old child jumping up and down next to your monitor.  So they all get blocked without hesitation.

<p>A nice side effect is that when you've blocked a few things, the space that they took up collapses, leaving you with much more readable content per screen.

</p><p>I'm exceedingly glad at how firefox extensions have taken off.  I can't imagine trying to get all this functionality in another browser.

<p>Exactly.  I don't mind a bit of text or a quiet image down the side of a page -- I might even read it.  But I find the animated images and flash movies incredibly distracting (and annoying).</p>
