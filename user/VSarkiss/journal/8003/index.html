<p><p>My current project involves MS SQL Server 2000 and its Data Transformation Services (DTS), which is basically an ETL tool with a Microsoft slant.  You can write ActiveX scripts as part of a package, and language choices include VBScript, JScript, and PerlScript.  Having previously endured the punishment that is writing VBScript, I immediately installed ActiveState's distribution, which includes PerlScript.</p>
<p>Perlscript came up with no hitches, and I found some excellent docs on working with Win32/OLE/COM (or whatever it's called these days....) at <a href="http://www.roth.net">Dave Roth's web site</a>, and, as always, <a href="http://perlmonks.org">the monastery</a> is a great resource.</p>
<p>But it's still all very weird for me.  I'm not used to enumerating OLE collections, or having <code>STDOUT</code> disappear down a black hole. It's been a while since I've felt uncomfortable writing Perl; it's like there's grease on the keyboard.  I look at what I have to do and I don't have an immediate reaction of how to do it.  It's like walking down a formerly familiar street, but all the houses are tilted 45 degrees now.</p>
<p>I'm sure it's just a matter of getting used to it, but at the moment, it's still weird.</p>
