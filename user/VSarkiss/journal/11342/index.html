<p><p>My hernia repair surgery went well last Friday, and I'm recovering nicely.  Took a shower this morning (yay) and took the dressing off (ouch).  I'm surprised at how much mobility I have.  The main problem is standing up and sitting down, which I try to use my arms for.  As luck would have it, my allergy is acting up, and coughing or clearing my nose is painful.</p>
<p>My current contract is due to end on May first.  I'll miss the income, but not the work.  I've complained about it plenty in here, so I won't repeat.  This week will be a good opportunity to get started looking for something new.  (If you know of some consulting opportunities in May in Southern California, please let me know. ;-)</p>
<p>This may also be a good opportunity to get started on some development I've been thinking of but haven't had the opportunity to work on: a database transformation toolkit.  Basically, having written hundreds of Extract-Transform-Load routines in the last few years, I want to make my own life easier: write a set of tools that take the repetitious part out.  DBI is a good foundation to make this happen, although I'm afraid the schema discovery for some RDBMSs may take more work.  Nonetheless, if I can get it to work for the big players (probably Oracle, Sybase, MS SQL Server, DB2, MySQL and PostgreSQL) I'll declare it a success.  (Nothing like a small initial target.)</p>
<p>Of course, there's all the other cool stuff I've wanted to do: look at <a href="http://www.parrotcode.org">Parrot</a>, subscribe to perl6-language, work on the pmdev todo list at <a href="http://perlmonks.org">the Monastery</a>.  If I make progress on all of these, maybe I should consider additional surgery.</p></p>
