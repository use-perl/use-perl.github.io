<p><p>Well, I haven't written here in a while mainly because I haven't had much to say.  So at least I'll pass along a household tip.</p>
<p>Last night my car got vandalized: someone drew a swastika on the hood with what looked like magic marker.  (I have no idea why: it's a Lexus, not like a Hummer or a Ferrari or something.)  I tried removing it with water and 409, but to no avail.</p>
<p>I looked up <a href="http://www.sharpie.com/sanford/consumer/sharpie/home/faqs.jhtml">
the Sharpie FAQs</a>, but found nothing.  So I called their 800 number, and the person suggested using alcohol.  I put a little isopropyl alcohol on a cloth, and the ink came off beautifully.  Not a mark remains, and the car's finish is OK.</p>
<p>Still, I'd like to get my hands on the person who did it.  Grrr...</p></p>

<h2>cleaning dry-erase whiteboards</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/merlyn/">merlyn</a> on 2003-12-12T16:34:36</h3>
As a parallel tip, let me note this winner.  If someone takes a permanent marker to a dry-erase whiteboard (usually accidentally, and yes, I've done it), it's actually quite simple to remove.
<p>
Just take one of the dry-erase markers, and overwrite the area that was damaged by the permanent marker, four or five times.  Then erase with the normal dry-erase eraser.  Comes right off!  Doesn't matter if the permanent mark has been there for months: it still works.
</p><p>
I was amazed that it would work, since the dry-erase cleaner spray bottle never seems to have an effect. Those markers are magic. {grin}</p>
