<p><p>Today is my wedding anniversary.  My wife and I will be celebrating with a romantic dinner this weekend.</p>
<p>This morning, all smiles and optimistic, I let the dog out.  A couple of seconds later, I heard her yelping and barking like mad.  I ran out and discovered she'd found a small skunk and was trying to attack it.</p>
<p>I dragged her in, stinking to high heaven.  I threw her in the shower stall and started with a tomato juice rinse. Then I found what appears to be <a href="http://ask.yahoo.com/ask/20010313.html">a better solution</a>.  In spite of the heat, I had to open all the windows to try to get some of the smell out.</p>
<p>I'm not sure how <em>I</em> smell right now.  I'm waiting for my office co-workers to show up, to see how they react....</p>
<p>Nothing like a romantic start to your anniversary day.  &lt;grumble>Stupid dog.&lt;/grumble></p></p>

<h2>Dangers of having a paper-route</h2>

Skunks for one.  I never actually got sprayed by a skunk but on two occasions I had close encounters.<br> <br>The first was funny.  It was late fall in Maine and morning dew is actually frost.  The wooden steps of the porch I was climbing made a loud snapping noise as as they "gave" under my weight.  A startled skunk below sprayed leaving the porch stinking to high heaven.  I almost feel bad for the people that lived there - being bad tippers and all.<br> <br>The second was karmically not funny - I walked through long grass where a skunk had very recently sprayed.  The fake leather shoes I was wearing were cracked and absorbed the moisture.  Being very poor (fake leather shoes), I didn't have anything else to wear to school.  Word of advice, do not try to cover up skunk with cheap ladies perfume - Kids can be cruel.
