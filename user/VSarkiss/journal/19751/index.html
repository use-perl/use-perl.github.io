<p><p>A: <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/07/08/0412226">What is an unlikely combination?</a></p>
<p>Just as I was <a href="~VSarkiss/journal/19749">complimenting Slashdot</a> on the occasional useful article, they run this to prove me wrong.</p>
<p>I've been a fan of <a href="http://www.jeopardy.com">Jeopardy</a> for many years, and frankly, I think Ken Jennings is one of the worst things that's happened to the game.  Quite probably, any of the other previous 5-day champs could have gone this far if they had been allowed to continue indefinitely.</p>
<p>More power to Ken -- may he strike the million mark -- but for viewers like me, the game has become dull.  The addition of new players once a week (or so) used to keep it fresh.  No longer.</p></p>

 For me, it's all about style and tactics. He's a very aggressive player, and it seems to work for him. Sure, he knows a ton, but he also knows how to work the game.



<h2>OK</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/pudge/">pudge</a> on 2004-07-08T20:40:06</h3>
But how does this reflect poorly on Slashdot?

<p>Anything I disagree with reflects poorly on Slashdot.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)</p>
<p>Seriously, that seems to be the attitude of everyone that writes comments there (and yes, I'm guilty of it myself, except I'm writing here): if I didn't like what they published, they suck.</p>
<p>To be quite honest, I followed some of the links they had in the article, and disagreed with the contents.  So I disliked the article.</p>
<p>Irrational?  Absolutely.  Common?  I think so.</p>
