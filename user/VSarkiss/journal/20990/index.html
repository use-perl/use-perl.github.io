<p><p>I've always said that, as a consultant, it's my job to help the clueless.  Complaining about them is like a doctor complaining about seeing sick people all the time.  But some clients -- well, some <em>people</em> at some clients -- make it very hard to stay quiet</p>
<p>Case in point: Outside of my main taks, I've been asked to help a particular individual who seems to be completely lost.  I'm not talking lack of technical knowledge, but lack of plain common sense.  A typical exchange this morning, as he walked up to my desk:</p>
<p>Client: "I just emailed you copies of those spreadsheets."<br />
Me: "Oh, ok."<br />
Client: "They should show up in your inbox soon."<br />
Me: "The output from the programs we ran yesterday?"<br />
Client: "Yeah."<br />
Me: "Does the email say what they are?"<br />
Client: "Oh, yeah."<br />
Me: "Anything I need to do with them?"<br />
Client: "No, I don't think so."<br />
Me: "Um..." <em>*blink*</em></p>
He emailed me documents I don't need, that I would see in a couple of moments in my inbox anyway, and then walked over to tell me about them.... And they wonder why he's not getting his job done.</p></p>
