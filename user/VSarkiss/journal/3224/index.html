<p><p>I just realized I've only written one entry a month since starting to keept this journal.  I guess I just don't <em>do</em> journals very well.  I already keep my logbook on paper for work, but this is different -- it's so public. </p>
<p>Having just gone through another of my periodic "What the heck am I doing?" crises, I'm  starting to regroup again.  It'll soon be two years since I quit my last job and went off on my own.  I certainly can't complain about the fact that I've had steady work since then. I've even done very well financially, just working part-time.  But I haven't achieved the goals I set out for myself at that time, and I feel like a failure because of that.  I've decided I need to do one of two things:
<ol><li>Renew my original commitment; or,</li>
<li>Change my goals.</li></ol>
Heh.  "If you can't get what you want, lower your standards."</p>
As usual, I've still got a lot of scattershot ideas floating around.  I just bought the Perl/Tk book just to play, and started reading -- slowly -- Damian Conway's <i>Object Oriented Perl</i>. Everyone's right, it's a terrific book.  As Francis Bacon said,
<blockquote>Some books are to be tasted, others to be swallowed, and some few to be chewed and digested.</blockquote>
This is definitely in the last category.</p>
<p>I just found out the <a href="http://la.pm.org">LA Perl Mongers</a> meeting next week is in South Pasadena instead of the Westside.  I'll certainly make an effort to attend.  Can't have too many Perl friends.</p></p>

<h2>Goals</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/shockme/">shockme</a> on 2002-03-02T19:46:10</h3>
I don't have any.  Heck, I'm still astounded that I get paid to sit in front of a computer every day.  Just put me in front of a monitor/keyboard, and I'm like a little kid at Christmas.
<p>
Maybe I should get some goals.  But if I had them, maybe I wouldn't be as happy as I am.  Granted, it's difficult to know where you're headed if you don't know where you're going, but at the same time, if I was striving for an endpoint, I might not be as happy with the day-to-day.
</p><p>
And I'm just so damned happy to be here.</p>
