<p><p>My current client project is not going well, sadly,  due to sociological problems rather than technical ones.  I hate to say it, but it's my impression that people around the client organization are starting to lose faith in the goal.</p>
<p>The silver lining is that reduced stress at the client is giving me more energy and more time to get back to my own development.  I spent most of yesterday working on a little system to track my receivables.  (I know I can buy a package, but what's the fun in that? ;-)</p>
<p>Up to now, I've been using a series of OpenOffice Calc spreadsheets (ported from Excel) to keep track of invoices and receivables, but year-end has always been a problem with my little system.  So yesterday I started working on a LAMP replacement (Linux-Apache-MySQL-Perl).  After a short while I realized how much functionality I've put into those spreadsheets over the years!  Just finding a way to figure out the number of business days between dates took me on a wild trip through CPAN.  (By the way, Date::Calendar, which gets installed with Date::Calc, appears to be the only one that implements the function.)</p>
<p>There's another neat thing about this. I've seen clients manage conversion projects like this both well and poorly, so now it's time to see if I can practice what I preach.</p></p>
