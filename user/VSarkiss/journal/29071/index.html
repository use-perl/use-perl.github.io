<p><p>My Linux box started acting up last night, and this morning the main hard disk won't even spin up.  So I dug up the most recent backup, which was over a year old, and inspected it on the WinXP box.</p>
<p>Much to my surprise, there isn't a whole lot out of date on the backup.  I realized I haven't really been doing much of anything on the Linux box lately.  Since I left self-employment, all I was doing there is picking up email from my forwarding address (mostly tossing spam, to be honest), some browsing, and some simple doc prep.  I've repointed forwarding to Gmail, got most of my bookmarks from del.icio.us, and I'm really wondering what I should do with the box.</p>
<p>I built it about five years ago, and it's had two hard disks that have both been problematic.  With the price of hardware these days, I wonder what's worth salvaging.  If I don't bring it up, it'll be the first time in about ten years that I haven't had a Linux machine at home.</p></p>
