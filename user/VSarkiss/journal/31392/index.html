<p>I have to admit I've never tasted Vegemite, but a label saying it's "Concentrated Yeast Extract" doesn't make me go, "Yum, I'll try that."</p></p>

<p>The U.S. clearly doesn't comprehend freedom at all.</p>

<p>Why do I have the right to die or the right to abort my child or the right to ride my motorcycle without a helmet, but can't eat what I want?</p>



<h2>hoax?</h2>

Although that's reported by an apparently reputable
newspaper, I'm going to go out on a limb and guess
that this is a hoax. It's fun to assume the worst
about the US these days.

I hope it's a hoax. But I see something indicating that it's not. I'm not an expat, but I like the stuff anyway.

Vegemite is made from beer.<br><br>"Concentrated Yeast Extract"<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... the "Yeast" here being beer yeast.<br><br>The story goes that there was a big war (1? 2? One of the two anyway) and nutrient rich food was scarce, due to the war effort.<br><br>And basically beer was still being made, and there was all this scum (dead yeast) at the bottom of the beer brewing tanks that was pretty high in vitamins...<br><br>And so you take the beer dregs, concentrate them, extract out the healthy parts, concentrate it into a very salty paste, and you have Vegemite.<br><br>And yes, it's hideous. Those that do eat it tend to be very careful about getting the balance between it and the butter on the bread juuuuust right.

It's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marmite" title="wikipedia.org"> <em>Marmite</em> </a wikipedia.org>, none of this "vegemite" rubbish.  And it's best in thick quantities on toast, covered with a layer of scrambled eggs.   Oooh, yes!

<blockquote> <div><em>Vegemite is made from beer.</em></div> </blockquote>
Since beer is liquid bread, and the alleged ban is due to the alleged ingredient that is only allegedly allowed in bread and cereals, I don't see why Vegemite couldn't just be re-classified as "spreadable bread", and the ban could be lifted.
