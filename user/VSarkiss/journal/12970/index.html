<p><p>I have an email address book with lots of people I've worked with over the years.  Occasionally, I'll remember someone in there and send them a "Hi, how's it going?" note just to keep in touch.  If I don't get a reply, and it had been a particularly long time since I'd communicated with that person, I figured their email address had changed or something.</p>
<p>Lately it seems more of my notes have disappeared into the ether, and I think the explosion in spam is to blame.  Either the recipients have mis-configured spam filters, or they just didn't recognize my name and tossed a note with a subject line like "Hello" or "Greetings".  Sometimes I wonder if I've done that myself.</p></p>

<h2>Been there done that</h2>

I tried to get it touch with a buddy of mine for 15 years after I was out of the Air Force.  All I had was his old home town and his name.  Over the years I would call information and try to track him down. Went nowhere.<br>
One day I got an email with the subject "I finally tracked you down."<br>
Sounded like spam to me, but just something about his email address sounded vaguely familiar, so I happened to open it instead of bit-bucketing it.<br>
Was I glad I hadn't trashed it.<br>I'm sure huge amounts of email gets thrown away because of spam.
<b>Steve Ciarcia</b>, in his last editorial in <i>Circuit Cellar</i> magazine, says that he request people that write to him to have distinctive, as obviously as possible non-spam subject lines so that he will actually read their messages instead of throwing them away.<br>
