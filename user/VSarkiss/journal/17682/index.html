<p><p>OK, I'll admit it, part of my motivation in writing this is to have a journal entry dated "February 29".  As a comedian once said, "Simple entertainment for simple minds".</p>
<p>I just finished my first week at my new job.  It's gone really, really well, although I can't get over being nervous at the fact that there are no fires burning.  Every shop has change occurring at some rate, and I just happened to be lucky that I started on a week when things are quiet.  How lucky can you get?</p>
<p>Well, I'll tell you.  One of our sister companies handles online ticket sales, and there's a lottery every few days for leftover tickets.  Friday evening I won tickets for a lacrosse game.  To be honest, I had no idea professional lacrosse even existed in the US, but hey, with free parking thrown in, the sky boxes were just damn amazing!</p>
<p>Winning a silly lottery is what I consider a small thing.  The big thing, the real lottery I won, is to be working among great people.</p>
<p>No, I take that back.  The <em>really</em> big thing, what I was truly blessed with, what I find beyond comprehension, is the incredible wife and children that I have (not to mention friends and acquaintances).  The joy they bring into my life is beyond measure.  I'm just so glad that I have a good day job that I can appreciate them.</p>
