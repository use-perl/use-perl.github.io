<p><p>I finally got around to upgrading Firefox from 0.9.x to 1.0.  <em>Very</em> nice.</p>
<p>Not only does it seem faster, but all the extensions I like were available as well.  Most importantly, all my AdBlock entries came over without a hitch.</p>
<p>I don't think I would have upgraded if AdBlock wasn't available.  I can't remember the last time I had to tolerate some stupid animated flash thingy on a web site.  Gah.</p>
<p>I only use two other extensions (tabbrowser preferences and undoclosetab), but just for grins, I installed the ForecastFox extension as well, so I have little weather icons in my status bar.</p></p>

<h2>no sessionsaver ?</h2>

I have both the extensions you mentioned, but if I had to pick another extension to install, I'd get sessionsaver in a heartbeat.<br/><br/>Saves a "session" of multiple tabs and reopens them.



<h2>tabs? sessions?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/WebDragon/">WebDragon</a> on 2004-12-07T21:27:49</h3>
sounds to me like neither one of you has found tabbrowser extensions: http://piro.sakura.ne.jp/xul/_tabextensions.html.en<br> <br>has everything you could possibly want to tweak about tabs and then some, including groups AND sessions. I reFUSE to run firefox without this.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br> <br>the other nice extension I am really getting to love is webdeveloper: http://www.chrispederick.com/work/firefox/webdeveloper/<br> <br>ahhh that's much better.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

<p>Web developer is way overkill for me since I don't do web development.  And the tabbrowser extensions were also over the top.</p>
<p>Not that there's anything wrong with them.  They're just not useful to me.</p>



<h2>Re:tabs? sessions?</h2>

<p>I used tab browser extensions all the time... upto 0.9
</p><p>Then I realized it was overkill and slowed down the entire browser significantly. Figured that tab reordering and groups were neat, but the only thing I <b>really</b> wanted was a session saver<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) FF is a lot more responsive without TBE, actually. To be fair, it's been a few months, so things might be different now.
</p><p>WebDev and Venkman are the two extensions that I can't live without when I do webby stuff. They're not for all users, tho<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

I've never noticed any significant slowdown here, myself, but I'm sure it's possible.<br> <br>http://www.flashforum.de/forum/showthread.php?t=149915 has a nifty trick for improving the speed of firefox browsing. Just pay attention to the english parts.<br> <br>Myself I like the fine-grained control over when and where tabs are launched, given by this extension, as well as the session control.
