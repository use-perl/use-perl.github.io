<p><p>Some of you may have heard me ranting in the <a href="http://perlmonks.org/?node=fullpage+chat">Monastery's CB</a> about this, but I still haven't got a solution that I like.</p>
<p>My current client engagement is at a bank, and they have an absolutely draconian firewall.  (Several years ago, you couldn't get internet access until a senior VP approved it.)  I'm using a Windows XP machine without a compiler, so I need pre-compiled CPAN modules for anything that's not pure-Perl.</p>
<p>Piece-o-cake, right?  Just install PPM, and set up some repositories.
That's what I thought too, until I realized I couldn't make PPM punch thru the
firewall.  I'm still not sure what the problem is.</p>
<p>Happily, ActiveState, as a last measure, have set up <a href="http://ppm.activestate.com/PPMPackages/zips/6xx-builds-only/">a repository of ZIP files</a> corresponding to their PPM packages, and I've often fallen back on using those.</p>
<p>Except the bank's f*-ing firewall won't let me download anything whose name
ends in <code>.zip</code>!  In the past, I've gotten around it by renaming
archives to end in <code>.mdb</code> or <code>.piz</code>.  But I can't do
that with AS's repository.</p>
<p>The only thing I could come up with was to download the repository
contents (at least the stuff that I needed) to my own machine, then burn a
CD that I could take to work.  Of course, that has a limited lifetime, in that it goes out-of-date as  oon aas anyone uploads to CPAN, but I'm only looking for acouple of DBI/DBD packages, which don't change very often.</p>
<p>So the question is: are there any other alternatives?</p>
<p>Remember, I:<ul>
<li>don't have a compiler, so <code>make install</code> isn't an option.</li>
<li>can't seem to make <code>ppm</code> go past the firewall;</li>
<li>can't download any files whose name ends in <code>.zip</code> or (probably) <code>.tgz</code></li></ul>
Is there any other way to get CPAN modules running on my boxx??</p>
</p>

burn a CD/DVD of the AS repos/CPAN at home or elsewhere or get a jaz drive or some other sort of removeable media and do the same between home a nd work. Banks don't change very quickly usually and, to be honest, after Nordea bank crashed after one of the more recent virus outbreaks, it's really not a bad idea to keep the internet away from the money networks.

<p>That's all I could think of too.</p>
<p>I'm not blaming the bank for wanting to keep people out -- as a matter of fact, I wish they would try harder -- it's just that they're doing a better job of keeping their workers in!  I mean, extension-based file blocking is a bit stupid.  The fact that I could get around it by just renaming files tells you how effective that is.</p>

I missed the CB discussion so I don't know if you are already aware of this but, just in case, here are ActiveState's instructions on
<a href="http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/docs/ActivePerl/faq/ActivePerl-faq2.html#ppm_and_proxies" title="activestate.com">PPM, Proxies and Firewalls</a activestate.com>.

The "proper", and sometimes even most effective solution may be to go political.<br> <br>Find someone who needs your work to... well, be done. Tell them you need access in order to complete the assignment you were given.<br> <br>Make sure they understand it's that simple, and while it may be unusual, there is nothing strange about it. You're not an ordinary user in the system. You're a developer and have legit reasons for what you need to do.<br> <br>It helps if it's a high-pressure/high-profile gig (one of the few advantages of doing a marathon march BTW<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:/ ).<br> <br>If you're pretty certain this won't work, just stay off radar.



<h2>Mini-CPAN</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/zatoichi/">zatoichi</a> on 2004-08-30T00:42:31</h3>
I thought I read something somewhere about Mr. Schwartz creating a mini-cpan that he took around on CD.
