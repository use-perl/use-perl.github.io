<p><p>I admit, sometimes I can't figure out all the UI elements here at use.perl.org.  I often have to look around the page, thinking, "That link used to be around here, somewhere."  Then there's all the new stuff that pops up on occasion.  (I can figure out Friends, Fans, and Foes, but what's a "Freak"?  In the slash sense, I mean).  'Tsall good, mind you.</p>
<p>This last one has me totally mystified, though.  A while ago I noticed the new tabs at the top of the journal pages (Logout, Preferences, Password, ~VSarkiss), and thought, "OK, cool, easy access to my stuff".  But later, when I added ziggy as a friend, a new "~ziggy (25)" tab showed up.</p>
<p>Why?  I mean, I like to read ziggy's blog and all, but this seems a little excessive....  And why not all the others I list under "Friends"?  I can't seem to find anything in my settings about a "friend tab" or a "~ziggy tab" (;-) preference.</p>
<p>The FAQ doesn't say anything about it.</p>
<p>Hey, if you can't ask weird questions in your journal, where can you ask them?</p></p>

<h2>&quot;Most recent friend&quot; tab?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jdavidb/">jdavidb</a> on 2002-10-25T17:53:09</h3>
<p>Did <i>everybody</i> add Ziggy as a friend yesterday?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)  I had the same problem, and noticed the same thing on slashdot yesterday after adding a friend there.  Today I added Rafael (thanks for the subversion book info, Rafael!) and Ziggy's tab was replaced.</p>

<p>It looks like for whatever reason you get a tab showing your most recent added friend.  I think this is a bug.</p>

<h2>Update:</h2>

<p>It's not even "most recent friend."  It's "most recent person for whom you clicked the friend/foe/friend-of-friend/whatever icon.  I now have someone else on my extra tab.</p>

<p>Maybe I can click on my own and it will be less confusing.</p>

<h2>Slashcode slightly underdocumented...</h2>

You can? It took me hours to get the basics on this "friends" system. The main slashcode does not in the least document how it all works. Blimey.
<p>A "Freak" is the same in relation to a "Foe", as a "Fan" is to a "Friend". Same relationship, other end.
</p><blockquote><div> <i>But later, when I added ziggy as a friend, a new "~ziggy (25)" tab showed up.</i> </div></blockquote>
That one had me baffled too. It turns out that, whenever you click on a user info link, this person becomes the subject of that tab, except when it's you &mdash; you have your own tab. Well, that's what <em>I</em> make of it. It has something to do with the root of the subdirectory you're in. For example, if you go to <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/pudge/" title="perl.org">this link</a perl.org>, you'll see the tab for Pudge appear &mdash; except when you are him.
<p>And it sticks. If you leave the site and come back in a day or two, it'll be the same person on that tab. Even if you log out, and log in again, manually.</p>
