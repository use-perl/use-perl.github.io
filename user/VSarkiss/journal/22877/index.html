<p><p>I've been feeling stale and tired lately.  Work is fairly mundane, and now that I have a salaried position, I don't spend time worrying about the next contract, late receivables, and junk like that.</p>
<p>I need something to wrap my brain around; something to get the creative juices flowing again, but I can't figure out what to do.</p>
<p>In the past I might've tried to pick up a new language or join a project or something, but I can't get excited about programming.  I thought about joining Phalanx or Parrot, but nothing sounds appealing.</p>
<p>I need to find something that's not related to computing.  It's not November, but maybe I should <a href="http://www.nanowrimo.org">start writing a novel</a>.  Or learn something new in a different field.  (A couple of years ago, I made a project out of learning General Relativity on my own.  I got pretty far -- for a dilettante anyway :-).</p>
<p>Suggestions, anyone?</p></p>

<h2>How about...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jdavidboyd/">jdavidboyd</a> on 2005-01-25T17:04:15</h3>
Helping someone learn to read?<br> <br>There are many volunteer organizations that could use help to tutor  students (children and adult).  I'm amazed when I see the statistics of how many people still can't read!<br> <br>
A worthy cause and very rewarding to the self...

<p>That's a great suggestion.  It turns out our local library has an adult literacy program, and they're looking for volunteer tutors.  I wrote away for more information.</p>

<h2>Writing</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/chromatic/">chromatic</a> on 2005-01-25T17:52:43</h3>
<p>A novel's a big chunk; I've passed 45,000 words on mine with a target of 70,000.  It's pretty daunting.</p>

<p>I found it helpful to start with <a href="http://wgz.org/chromatic/writeyourlife" title="wgz.org">Write Your Life</a wgz.org> every day for a month to cultivate the habit of writing.  You and your family might appreciate having that around, too.</p>



<h2>Help compile all human knowledge</h2>

<p>Become a Wikipedia addict^Weditor.  There will never be an end to the work to be done.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<p>I also echo the suggestion of helping someone learn to read.  Certainly a worthwhile endeavor.</p>



<h2>3MP</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/chaoticset/">chaoticset</a> on 2005-01-26T01:53:49</h3>
You may want to consider the Three Month Plan, which is 1000 words per day every day from the beginning of February to the end of April.  After this, you have a corpus of 90000 words.
<p>
It doesn't have the alarming pace of NaNoWriMo, but it does have the advantage of starting very soon.  Get a little plotting and some character notions put together, and you could have yourself a nifty chunk of narrative by May.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>
