<p><p>When I first started use.perling, I ordered my slashboxes on the opening page with "Recent Journals" near the top.  Then something happened, the slashbox order changed, and for a while, I couldn't re-order them.  But it worked again when I tried it a couple of days ago (thanks, pudge), so I put "Recent Journals" back near the top.</p>
<p>Well, I'd gotten used to the old (unchanging) position, and now after I bring up the front page, I scroll down and wonder where the recent journals box went....</p>
<p>Reminds me of something strange that happened to me a few years ago. Before Unix, I was using VMS and TOPS-10 (among a few others).  With those DEC operating systems, you could abbreviate commands, and the command to look at a file's contents was <code>TYPE</code>, which you could abbreviate to <code>TY</code>.  When I first switched over to Unix, I set up an alias so <code>ty</code> would run <code>more</code> (<code>less</code> didn't exist then...).  The habit got ingrained, and I've kept that alias all these years.</p>
<p>The strange incident happened when I had to do something on VMS a few years ago.  I was staring at the keyboard trying to remember how to look at a file's contents....  I had grown to associate <code>ty</code> with Unix, and had forgotten its original source....</p>

It's really great to watch a recent Mac user on a Windows. He keeps hitting the corners of the screen with the mouse and he makes strange faces, wondering why no action is taken O:-)
