<p><p>My current client is in a downtown Ellay tower.  Over the past few months, the elevators have been "modernized".  (That's what the sign said: "Elevator modernization in progress".)</p>
<p>To prove that modernization <code>ne</code> improvement, part of the process was making the elevators talk:  "Going up", "Twentieth, FLOOR", and so on.</p>
<p>There are few things more annoying than a chippy-yet-monotone female voice first thing in the morning, telling you the elevator is "Going down".</p></p>

It may be annoying to people who can see the floor indicators, but it is invaluable to people who are blind, and can even be useful to people who are distracted and start to enter/leave as soon as the door opens without checking that it is going the right direction or at the right floor.

<p>Oh, I don't have any problem with assistive technologies.  And you're right, I'm sure that was the motivation.  The fact that it's helpful to some doesn't change the fact that it's annoying to others.  Especially that voice quality and intonation....</p>
<p>Hm, maybe they could add a button: "If you can see this button, push it to shut up the elevator."<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>
<p>As for helping distracted people: no, they still do it.  Just last week a lady pushed 21, got off at 20, and only caught on when her badge wouldn't open the door....  It seems to happen at the same rate before and after the change.</p>

Helping distracted people doesn't have to always succeed to be valuable.  It just has to sometimes convert failure into success.  I've had occassions where I stopped walking out the door as I realized that the voice had just said "3'rd floor" instead of "4'th floor".
