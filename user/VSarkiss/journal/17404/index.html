<p><p>I <a href="/user/VSarkiss/journal/16006">mentioned here a while ago</a> about adopting our dog from the animal shelter.  They guessed her age from her teeth since she was a stray, but based on that, we figured she turned six months old last month.  So I signed her up for an obedience class from our city's rec department.  She's very affectionate and gets along great with people, but doesn't behave well around other dogs.  I thought the class was a great opportunity to socialize her.</p>
<p>Yesterday, after getting yet another blister on my  hand from her pulling on the leash, I decided there's no point in continuing right now: she's just not "getting it".  She's a smart dog, but she keeps backsliding.  I figured I'll try again in a few months, and keep working with her at home in the meantime.</p>
<p>My wife says this is the first time she's heard of anyone flunking out of kindergarten....</p></p>

Get a 'pinch' collar.<br>  We use them on our dogs for obedience training, and taking them for walks.<br>  They work well, and they don't hurt the dogs.<br> <br>
And they <i>certainly</i> do get their attention!<br>

<p>Funny you mention that: I got one just a couple of days ago.  It does help, although I still think I need to wait before enrolling her in class again.</p>
