<p><p>This poor neglected journal.  It used to be I wrote here once a month, now I realize it's more like once a season....</p>
<p>So I started at my new client today, and as usual, had a case of "new project blues".  Where do I park?  Where's the bathroom?  Where's the coffee?  How's this phone work?  Where do you keep stuff?  What do you want me to do?</p>
<p>Amazingly enough, I had answers to most of those by the end of the day.  Except, of course, the big one, "What do you want me to do?"  My customer's a former Andersen Consulting guy, so the design docs count as much as the working system.  The problem is, the design docs aren't really for helping the developers: they're for putting in front of your manager and saying, "See? Deliverable 1 is complete, so keep the funding going."  Sigh.</p>
<p>There's also that overwhelming sense of being alone at a new client.  Luckily I got the internet connection going on the computer and logged on to <a href="http://perlmonks.org">Perl Monks</a> for a brief period, and felt like I was among friends again.</p>
