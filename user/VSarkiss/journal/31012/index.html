<p><p>Glancing thru <a href="http://news.yahoo.com">Yahoo News</a>, I came across the eWeek article <a href="http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1895,2016415,00.asp">
10 Programming Languages You Should Learn Right Now</a>.  (Shame TorgoX doesn't write here anymore: ALL MUST LEARN! LEARN NOW! :)</p>
<p>My favorite piece of lameness in the article is the reason you should learn the number one language, PHP:
<blockquote>Building Web apps from scratch using C or COBOL is going the way of the dinosaur

<h2>Good to clear that up</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/autarch/">autarch</a> on 2006-09-15T20:57:49</h3>
I was about to start this new webapp in C _and_ COBOL. I was going to mostly write it in COBOL for the high level logic, and the use C for the performance-intensive bits.<br><br>I am _so_ glad I read that article first!



<h2>AJAX is a language now?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/DAxelrod/">DAxelrod</a> on 2006-09-15T22:12:27</h3>
My favorite entry was AJAX. Since they already have JavaScript as a separate item, what are they actually suggesting learning? XML? XMLHttpRequest? At least they clarify that it isn't a language.<br><br>And I love how many imperative programming languages with Algol-derived syntax they list. For balance, there's some OO. They have country *and* western.

<h2>Why you should learn C</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/bart/">bart</a> on 2006-09-15T22:14:36</h3>
<blockquote><div>Learning C is crucial. Once you learn C, making the jump to Java or C# is fairly easy, because a lot of the syntax is common. Also, a lot of C syntax is used in scripting languages</div></blockquote><br>Well OK... but what about C?<br><br>This quote is only saying that a lot of languages syntactically look like C, but I don't see anything like a reason to learn C itself.

... that is has a number 1. on it. Note that the article doesn't say anything about it being the best or their top recommendation. It's just the first one displayed.
