<p><p>A couple of years ago, when I decided to strike out on my own and form a product company, rather than the consulting work I'd been doing for more than a decade, I tried to explain it to my father in terms of an analogy.</p>
<p>If this had been 100 years ago, and I was a carpenter instead of a computer guy, I would have two basic choices.  One would be what I was already doing: going around repairing broken furniture, and building custom pieces ordered by customers.  The other choice would be to set up my own shop, and build furniture or cabinetry the way I think they should be made.  Good materials and good craftsmanship: dovetail joints, nice rounded-off edges, and so on.  Of course, the danger with the second route is that I would set up shop and nobody would show up to buy what I made.</p>
<p>What I didn't mention is how frustrating the first way -- my existing line of work -- can get.  When the customer tells me the equivalent of, "Nail the bed to the armoire".  My eyes go wide; and I think, "What??"  Politely I ask the customer what they're thinking, why they think that's necessary.  The usual answer is, "Aren't you a carpenter?  Here's nails and a hammer.  Put the armoire and the bed together before the whole project falls behind schedule."  I write memos that this doesn't make sense, it's crazy, and am reminded that I'm not the project manager.</p>
<p>Mumbling something about the customer always being right, I nail the bed to the armoire ("Nails.  We don't use glue or biscuits here.  Nails and brads are our standard.")  I even do a clean job at it.  Then I stand there looking at the mess and shake my head.</p>
<p>Six months later, the customer complains about the fact that they can't move the bed out of the room now because it's nailed to the armoire: they won't fit through the door.  I'm blamed for lack of understanding, and shoddy work.  "Well, didn't you <em>know</em> we'd want to move it out eventually?  What kind of crappy workman are you?"</p>
<p>Well, I've been asked to do crazy, kludgy things again, and I just know where this is going....  One way or the other, I have to leave consulting and start a product line.  I figure even if I starve sitting in my own shop selling my own pieces, I'll never have to explain why the damn cabinet is glued to the sofa.</p></p>
