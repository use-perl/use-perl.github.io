<p><p>I have long had problems with my sinuses.  When compounded with a cold or an allergy flare-up, it can be real misery.</p>
<p>One of the best treatments is a simple <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=nasal+lavage">nasal lavage</a>: put a little salt and baking soda in a cup of warm water, then snort it up.  I know it sounds repulsive, but it works great.  No medicine I've ever taken works as well.</p>
<p>I usually keep a small film can of salt and baking soda in the bathroom, and I take it with me when I travel.  Today I realized if airport security ever stopped me and asked me what that suspicious white powder in the film can is, I could reply, "Oh, that.  That's just for my nose."</p></p>

My wife has one of those, and uses it most mornings.  I've thought abuot trying it out when my sinuses get bad, but I still have this mental problem with drowning by my own hand.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

It's not too hard to get used to, though sinuses filling up with fluid isn't exactly normal. I've been doing it for a year and a half, and my sinus and allergy problems have mostly gone away. Use a non-iodized salt if you try it.

<p>It does take some getting used to, but it's not the drowning feeling that's bad, it's seeing what comes out of your nose.</p>
<p>Erm, I don't think I want to write about this anymore.</p>

They use this as a treatment for babies too, even of just a few days old &mdash; except maybe for the baking powder, I never heard that before. The popular name for it here, is "sea water". It serves both to clean the nose, and the eyes, if those got dirty.
<p>Just goes to show that humans, like all vertebrate land animals, originate from the sea, as salty water is thought of as better than just clean water.</p>

Careful, it's baking <em>soda</em>, not baking <em>powder</em>.  Baking soda is simple sodium bicarbonate: it makes the water slightly alkali, which is easier on the mucous membranes.  Baking powder OTOH has other ingredients, which are probably not good for your sinuses....
<p>You're right, you can buy the stuff bottled also (brand names like "Ocean").  But I like the warm water, and as much as I use it, homemade is much cheaper.</p>
