<p><p>The last couple of days I've been banging my head against another Microsoft wall: the fact that workflow in DTS packages only has "and" conditions, not "or".  In other words, you can't say "run this job if either this or this is true", which means you can't program alternate paths: there's no way to provide a "rendezvous" in a workflow.</p>
<p>I tried several alternatives, and even hunted down an example on the web of someone doing two paths using VBScript; but the example is so rigid it can't be put into a general form.  I'm now ready to declare "it can't be done".  At least until the bruises on my head heal....</p>
<p>I liken the difference between developing on MS and developing on Unix/Linux to driving on two different roads.</p>
<p>The MS road is well-lit, nicely landscaped, freshly painted.  But to either side is a 1,000-foot drop to sharp, jagged rocks.  It's great as long as you're in the boundaries, but if you want something they didn't anticipate, you're dead.</p>
<p>The Unix road is a little dusty, well-worn, and has occasional pits, but the shoulder is very gently inclined, and there are call boxes every few feet.  Sometimes the easy things are not easy, but the difficult things are usually possible.</p></p>
