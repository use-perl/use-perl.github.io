<p><p>I <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/VSarkiss/journal/25906">mentioned last week</a> that I was thinking of upgrading to Fedora Core 4.  The good news is that the upgrade went well.  The bad news is how I ended up doing it.</p>
<p>I knew I was in for trouble when I booted my machine and <tt>fsck</tt> said "The system appears not to have shut down cleanly" or words to that effect -- in fact, it had shut down clean as a whistle.  To make a long story short, it cleared  so many inodes in /usr and / that I could only boot to single-user and only a few programs would run.</p>
<p>I booted from an Ubuntu live CD and downloaded ISO's for FC4.  Then I had to boot FC3 again to use <tt>cdrecord</tt> to burn the CDs -- fortunately that still worked.  I did an upgrade, and after a few runs of <tt>fsck</tt> and <tt>badblock</tt>, I had a working system again.  Surprisingly, <tt>yum</tt> found about 250 packages to update.</p>
<p>I'm still not sure how the disk got fratzed.  We've had a couple of power outages in our area lately, so I'm assuming there was a power spike or  some such.</p></p>
