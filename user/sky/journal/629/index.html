<p>Ok, so we are back from the conference! Me, Malin, Claes and Ingy drove back from Amsterdam. We were planning to stop in Copenhagen for the night, but ended up driving all the way, in 14 hours. It is 1300km with a 40 minute ferry trip in it. We averaged around 120km/h during the trip.<p>
I think Autobahn scared the shit out of Ingy, I was realy annoyed and was driving in speed between 180 and 225 km/h. Unfourtnatly it then started POURING down water and we had to slow down. Then there was heavy traffic around Hamburg and then it was 200 again. So back in Sweden there was heavy winds and bad rain. I got some sleep and then I took over when we had 350k left. Now in Sweden you are suposed to do 110, I did 180 and this is where Ingy got realy scared! I just wanted to be home and sleeping.
<p>
It is good to have Ingy here, he is a cheese lover, that lets me buy more cheese, I am also a cheese lover butI try to cut down. We have been talkign alot of perl things and this YAML thing looks like a good idea. I want to make YAML work well with POE.
<p>
I had a long discussion with Kevin Lenzo, and I will come back to some of the things we discussed, but it would make POE even cooler.
<p>
It was greating meeting all the people!<p>
