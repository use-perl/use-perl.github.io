<p>Off on holiday

So today I am going on a 3 week holiday. Of course, when I say that I actually mean a holiday period of 3 weeks interrupted by a conference tour in between. 
<p>
So on the 19th of July, I will fly to Ottawa via Chicago from Stockholm for the Ottawa Linux Symposium. I am staying the conference hotel together with Mr Duncan.
<p>
On the 25th of July After the conference ends we will fly down to Portland via Chicago and arrive on the evening of that sunday.
<p>
5 days of OSCON!
<p>
Fly home on the 29th of July to Stockholm for another 8 days of holiday before I start working again back in London.
<p>
If anyone wants to meet up in Ottawa, please drop me an email!
<p></p>

Food for purchase?  What's that about?
<p>
I'm also on flight 929 from ORD to PDX, but please note that they moved the flight time back from 1500 to 1445.
</p><p>
When do you get into ORD?  How much of a layover do you have?</p>

Food for purchase means we don't get free food aboard! Ok, so flight changed, damn them, I got my confirmation on Friday.... I am coming in on Air Canada / UA 8491 at 13:54 to Terminal 2...<br>Should I be worried?<br> <br>Cheers<br>Arthur

I dunno, it might be a little tight.  You've got 45 minutes to switch to a different terminal.  Will you have to go through customs between these flights?  Or will that have been taken care of elsewhere?

Don't know about customs and immigrations. However checking on the united airlines website, UA929 from ORD to PDX is scheduled to leave on 15.00 on the 25th of July.
