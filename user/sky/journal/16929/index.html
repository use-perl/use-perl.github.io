<p>So, this year the conference season starts of early for me, with little advance warning and a strange new conference too. <p/>
At <a href="http://opensource.fotango.com/">work</a> I have recently been dabbing a bit into wine, you know, the ultra cool opensource implementation of the Win32 API. So I suggested to the company that instead of going to all boring (in the sense I heard most of the talks by now) perl conferences again, I switch one and hit <a href="http://www.winehq.org/wineconf/">Wine Conf</a>, after an hours thinking I got the ok and now I am off to fly to Minneapolis on Friday the 29th of January, see wine hackers for the weekend and then fly back early morning on Monday the 2nd of February!
<p>
Maybe some perl people live in the area? Maybe some time on sunday to meet up?

Both Ken Williams and I live in Minneapolis, actually.  Email us and let us know where you're staying and all that.



<h2>And pack warm clothes</h2>

It can get _really_ freaking cold here now.  Today was nice (near 20 F), but the past few days had temperatures around 0 F, with biting winds.  You really _must_ have a warm coat, gloves or mittens, and a hat if you expect to walk around outside at all.<br> <br>Most places, when it gets cold, you think "this is unpleasant".  Here in Minneapolis it regularly gets cold enough to be quite dangerous if you don't have the right gear.
