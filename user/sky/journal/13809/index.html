<p>Hey, I have this brilliant idea, I want to write a version control system...... a networked version control system!<p>

Now, obviously a networked version control system is going to be CPU and memory bound, and it doesn't do much string manipulation so I am going to write it in C! And then I am going to base it on APR which is way less portable than for example Perl, because I don't want it to run on any other platforms than standard unix and win32!<p>

Then I base it on a 666 layered architectured design without doing enough scalability testing to make sure it actually works, then I start hyping it incredibly! 
<p>
PROFIT!

Sad news, subversion has <a href="http://nntp.x.perl.org/group/perl.ponie.dev/15">delayed the Ponie project at least a week</a> and most likely lost me as a user.<p>

<p>This is very sad news, Sky. Maybe the problem is just that it's still not in a final release form. Let us hope so.</p>

<p>In the meantime, I got an email this week from somone at Perforce saying that they give out free licenses for open-source projects. I'll forward the mail to you.</p>

<blockquote><div>[Perforce] give out free licenses for open-source projects</div></blockquote>
<p>perl5 already uses Perforce as its version control repository. Ignoring the issues about open/closed source software, I seem to remember at least 3 practical problems with it:
</p><ul> <li>It does checkouts over ssh, which means that the user has to maintain a ssh tunnel to the repository machine, and the repository machine owner has to maintain the ssh authorized keys file</li>
<li>It can't do anonymous read only access</li>
<li>Every year the licence key has to be renewed. This is admin faff. If this is not done the repository isn't usable. If it is done late, the respository is offline until it is fixed</li>
</ul>
<p>IIRC we're also low on licenced users. Licenced users are counted, so we have ask nicely every time we want to increase the number of users. Each ssh tunnel counts as a user, so I can't have 3 different machines tunneling into the repository simulatenously on 1 licence - I have to drop the connection before starting up the new one.</p>
<p>If I've made errors I'm sure I'll be corrected</p>

<blockquote><div>Each ssh tunnel counts as a user, so I can't have 3 different machines tunneling into the repository simulatenously on 1 licence - I have to drop the connection before starting up the new one.</div></blockquote> <br>Strange. Perforce licenses are normally counted per named user. A named user can have an unlimited number of simultaneous connections (read: client workspaces) to the repository. Of course, the free licenses for open-source projects might differ in this respect from the normal payed-for licenses, which are the ones that I'm familiar with, so YMMV.

<h2>Try arch</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Matts/">Matts</a> on 2003-07-31T17:28:08</h3>
Really try arch (or tla or ArX). It's quite a bit different to using CVS (and thus I assume SVN), but it seems to work.<br> <br>Check outs can be slow as they start at a base revision and then work through applying the patchsets, but you can optimise by providing checkpoints along the way. It's all in the manual.<br> <br>I know people don't want to try arch because of Tom Lord. That's a shame, as it'd be like not trying qmail because of djb.

it is also a bunch of awk scripts
