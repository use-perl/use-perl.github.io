<p>Last night was my 10th month anniversary of my engagment to my fiancee and the girl I love. Since we hadn't celebrated properly for some time, and she is leaving for London over the weekend (yes, this means I will create code like a maniac this weekend) to see Madonna, I figured I would surprise her with a nice dinner.<p>
I went down to the local market and picked up
<UL>
<LI>Ostrich, very nice alternative to filet of ox
<LI>Russian Caviar, a new kind with russian names on it, made it hard to find out a name. Small grained with no texture at all, just made a wonderfull smooth taste with a bit of limeness to it, wonderfull!
<LI>Toast for the Caviar
<LI>Red Onion for the Caviar
<LI>Wild raspberries
<LI>Strawberries
<LI>Blueberries
</UL>
I then proceeded to bake potatohalves with olive oil, mushrooms and tomatoes in the oven, while we had the caviar on toast with whipped sourceream and red onion. Here the only snatch presented itself because the potato took 3 times the planned time to complete. This highly increased the taste of the green peppar souce but meant I overdid the ostrich.<BR>
Ostrich should realy be fried quickly and be very rare done. Ofcourse I fried it in butter, but not very much.<BR>
To the dinner we had in my opinion the nicest mineral water, SanPellegrion from Italy and a <A HREF="http://www.wineresearch.com/wr-cgi/ViewWineInfo.asp?WineID=2726">1990 Grande Vin Signature Champage from Jaqusson & Fils</A>,  while this might not have been the best to the Ostrich it was delicious to the Caviar and had a wonderfull taste.<P>
We then had a walk with our dog, the english bulldog monster Archie and then had a sallad of the wild berries, I added milk and Bailleys with chrused ice. This was lovely in this rare hot Swedish summer day.
<P>
<I>Artur</I></p>
