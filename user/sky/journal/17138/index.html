<p>So I arrived on Friday afternoon after a spending a long time flying, due to insane regulations I had to be up at 6AM in the morning so I could be at the airport for for 7 so I could sit around for 3 hours to until the flight left at 10.15. Thankfully I have a <a href="www.prioritypass.com">Priority Pass</a> so I could relax in a lounge. I wisely choose to fly American Airlines since they have air marshals and therefore they fly, they also have plenty of space in economy and more importantly, power in economy (if you ask for it, Delta also has this). I was picked up by Mandi from Codeweavers and after a detour by the hotel we ended up at the Codeweaver office. Lots of geeks here but I am kind of alone with my laptop.
<p>
After a few more people joined in we went off to a mexican resturant which was nice, ended up in bed at midnight after being up close to 24 hours.
<p>
Then on saturday we got picked up by Jeremey White and taken to the hotel, it was a lot of small speeches, discussion and interesting approaches on how to fix things, and when the mythical 1.0 release will happen. The big thing is that Office really runs except clippy.
<p>
Right now there is demos and talk about winebuild, which is ofcourse what I think is most interesting, and then after this it will be a demo of ReactOS by the core ReactOS team. But first pizza.

<p>
So, the planes <b>we know</b> have men with guns on are safe?

No, however, if you would read my comment correctly, planes we know have men with guns on are not grounded at Heathrow leaving poor me lost in the US.
