<p>I'm finding it a struggle to work with the 'system' that my current client/employer (yeay contracting) has accumulated over several years.<br/><br/>Todays WTF, was that anything that was in T4/Fax encoding was stored in 1 table - about 32 distinct types of chart despite there being about 7 clear groups of chart that are handled/processed/used differently.<br/><br/>The fact that most of the code is so badly written and stuck around 1993 in style means that I have to actually get up and walk away from my desk regularly rather than get worked up at the sheer idiocy on the screen.<br/><br/>The good news is we are replacing as much as possible, the bad news is we don't have close to enough time to document what the system is currently doing - even if we could get everybody to agree to what is actually supposed to do.<br/><br/>*sigh*
