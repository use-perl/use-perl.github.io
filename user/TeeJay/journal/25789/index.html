<div class="span8">
<p>This afternoon I was changing some code that checked if a value matched one of a couple of values for each clause, but now it matches up to a dozen.
<p>
If it was SQL I'd use the nice IN operator, but perl lacks an equivilent. Will perl6 include a fast, efficient equivilent without resorting to the LISP/Scheme/CrackInspired syntax that I see so much of in the summaries?
<p>
Using perl 5 I abuse grep like so
<br>
<pre>
<pre>
   if (grep ($var == $_ , (3,4,6,8..11,12,14,15))) {
     print " matches\n";
   } else {
     print " has no matches\n"
   }

</pre>
</pre>
<br>
Which I think is pretty readable if slower than a bunch of hand written == and & glued together across 6 lines.
<br>
or I could use the <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/larrysh/Number-Range-0.06/lib/Number/Range.pm">Number::Range</a> module.

<p>While I can't say I'm wild about the name -- though I can't think of a better one -- the <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/List-MoreUtils/lib/List/MoreUtils.pm" title="cpan.org">List::MoreUtils</a cpan.org> module seems to offer a more general solution.</p> <blockquote><div> <tt>use List::MoreUtils qw/any/;<br> <br>if (any {$var == $_ } 3,4,6,8..11,12,14,15) {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; print " matches\n";<br>} else {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; print " has no matches\n"<br>}</tt> </div></blockquote>

I don&#8217;t see how that makes anything any better. You can <code>s/any/grep/</code> and remove the <code>use</code> line and that works.

<p>Because if you have a large list, <tt>grep</tt> forces you to iterate over every element.  That could be expensive if called many times.  <tt>any</tt> is easy to read and terminates as soon as any element in the list meets the condition.  Of course, that still doesn't mean that <tt>any</tt> is better, but if you're using that in conjunction with other functions in that module, it can be a win.</p>

<p>Well, yes. And I did consider that.</p>

<p>But it really only matters if you have a large list in which you look for some values much more frequently than for others, so reordering the list can yield consistent savings. Otherwise you&#8217;re just reducing the runtime from <i>n</i> steps to <i>n/2</i> averaged steps &#8211; both of which are <i>O(n)</i>.</p>

<p>If that tiny an optimization actually manages to make a noticable difference, then you really have no excuse not to use a hash.</p>

<p>If the code block was doing something much more complex that can&#8217;t be expressed in terms of hash <code>exist</code>/lookup, <code>any</code> would be worth considering, but for a simple &isin; operation, any case too big for <code>grep</code> to handle is also too big for <code>any</code> to handle relative to the better option that is available.</p>

In p5, you could use Quantum::Superpositions any()<br><br>In p6, they are called junctions - and in this case it is still any()<br><br>Cheers
