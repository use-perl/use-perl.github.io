<p>I am working through my inbox giving credit where it is due on the autodia project - I misplaced my last up to date CREDITS file and have had to rebuild it from scratch.
<p>
It looks like I have received patches, and contributions as well as example c++, java and php, from about 20 people - most of them C++ programmers from France, a significant number are from Germany and most of the rest are from anglophones (US or UK) who have given into my whining on various related lists and had a play with the code.
<p>
On a side note - today I discovered that HTML::TEMPLATE reporting is shockingly shit.. It reported a syntax error on line 30 that turned out to be on line 200 odd. Didn't give any useful information - about as helpful as that rubbish 'error at line 0' message I got a couple of times from vbscript.
<p>
Our project at work is really starting to be limited by HTML::Template but we have so much code and HTML invested in it that it is too expensive to move to TT.
<p>
When people talk about legacy code you often think of 10 or 20 year old mainframes not 4 or 5 year old HTML and perl scripts or modules.

<h2>TT</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/gav/">gav</a> on 2003-03-17T23:26:44</h3>
<p>I moved about a year ago to TT from H::T and haven't looked back. The extra power is great. I feel that you get a lot better separation of overall presentation and logic if you can move some of the presentation logic out into the template. You can defiantly cut down on lines of code which makes maintenance easier.</p>
<p>The thing I really like about TT is that you can pass any kind of data type; hashes, arrays, objects, functions, etc and use them in your template. It also works nicely with Class::DBI which I am a fan of.</p>
<p>It should be fairly easy to port H::T code and templates to TT, especially if you use a kind of <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/gav/journal/7072" title="perl.org">wrapper  class</a perl.org>.</p>



<h2>Bug Report?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/samtregar/">samtregar</a> on 2003-03-18T06:00:34</h3>
Do you want to file a bug report, or just cry about it?   I'm more than happy to work on fixing bugs in HTML::Template but I haven't personally witnessed any problems in the syntax error detection code.
<p>
In case you didn't read the docs, the proper place to report a bug in HTML::Template is <a href="http://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/ReportBug.html?Queue=HTML%3A%3ATemplate" title="cpan.org">here</a cpan.org>.

<h2>Re:Bug Report?</h2>

Yeah, I will report an error today.
<p>
Sorry to bitch about H::T so much, I think we should have been using TT a long time ago. I don't think H::T is suited to a project of this scale.
</p><p>
when you are looking for a really stupid mistake (and these are the hardest to find as we all know) incorrect or lack of line numbers in error messages are deeply unhelpful.
</p><p>
Bug reported via rt.
</p><p>
I would probably have some problems to bitch about with TT if I used it everyday at work too, but I don't so H::T is going to get bitched at.
