<p>For all their happy chirpy blogs about how much cooler, smarter and nicer they are than google they seem to be just like another AOL or MSN.<br/><br/>hotmail used to be the scammer webmail of choice, but these days it seems to be yahoo, in the past couple of days I've had 3 carefully crafted nigerian scam attempts (targeting people selling cars in a specific uk car trade magazine) from yahoo webmail accounts - I can't be bothered to report them to yahoo anymore as they haven't responding to reporting the first, thats pretty annoying.<br/><br/>I've also just heard that Yahoo were more than happy to hand over their search logs to the white house without a fight or informing their users - I won't be searching with them then.<br/><br/>They still want about a hundred quid to place an entry in their directory, despite the fact it isn't used in any search engine rankings, and is just a small link from their search page - how many google click thru's can that buy? Oh yeah - if I want to advertise on yahoo/overture, they want 60 quid up front.. but why bother - when most of the 'net is using google, and you don't know what kind of results you'll be getting?<br/><br/>And it took them almost a year longer to recognise a site I run than google, so on that count they are behind google.<br/><br/>Finally they still don't have the UK in their yahoo maps.<br/><br/>So from where I'm sitting, right now Yahoo don't seem a whole lot of use.<br/><br/>A.</p>
