<p>We have been using Movietrak.co.uk for a couple of weeks and already we are thinking of cancelling.
<p>
The first and most minor annoyance was that it sent our Charlies angels 2 before charlies angels 1, despite one having a 'higher priority'.
<p>
Next we discover that we can only use it from the computer we registered from (no warnings about that) so my wife can't use it while I'm away with my laptop that we used to register.
<p>
Finally we discover that they will randomly send out a film they think you might like if they don't have the stock to send a film in the list you specified, rather than waiting for you to add more, or for something you want to come back into stock.
<p>
of course none of the popular films in the top 5 or so of our list have been sent in the 3 weeks we have been there.
<p>
and as usual for a .asp webshite the search is next to useless (we use imdb or blackstar or amazon to find the exact title of a film and then type it in to the search box at movietrak).
<p>
Once again its a good idea wasted on a very poor implementation at both the technical and design levels - a little more thought would have gone a long way.
