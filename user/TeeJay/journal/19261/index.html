<p>After another couple of hours debugging the code, I now have it working for at least 8 x 8 squares (Too time consuming
to check it works on larger numbers as I don't have any graphical output yet). I also have it working (I think) in all 4
directions and clockwise or anti-clockwise.
<p>
Refactoring the C++ has been pretty painless, for some reason C++ seems to really reward your efforts in refactoring -
now nearly every line in the actual recursive methods deals with plotting the curve, with only a couple of calls to a
method that tracks it and updates the internal data structures... having just recompiled and checked its just over 200
lines excluding comments. I think if it was any smaller it would start to sacrifice clarity and I plan to write C++ like
my Perl - working and clear. Shame there don't seem to be any nice simple unit-testing frameworks like Test::Simple and
Test::More, I have found log4cpp which will probably be added to my (currently very small) collection of essential C++
libraries.
<p>
Looking at the C++ I can see that I can probably reduce the LoC and improve the clarity and even performance (possibly)
of the Perl version. I look forward to having both the C++ and Perl versions side-by-side having both been refactored.
<p>
Refactoring code in a different language forces you to look at the original in a different light, I might try and find
other modules I have written in Perl and rewrite them in C++, which should improve both my Perl and C++ skills. Oddly
writing more C++ means I am rereading K&R with renewed interest, hopefully I should be able to flick through
Stroustrop's book with similar interest and ease after another month of two hacking with his creation.
<p>
Oh yeah - you can find them on my <a href="http://droogs.org/teejay.html">'other blog'</a>

<h2>OO</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/djberg96/">djberg96</a> on 2004-06-15T14:29:28</h3>
If you find yourself enjoying the OO paradigm, might I suggest learning a bit of Ruby and seeing how it stacks up against the Perl and C++ versions?  If not, I'll await your final Perl product and see what I can come up with.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

I like OO, but I like prefer to use it when needed not all the time. Something that works in Perl and to a lesser degree in C++ is to write some procedural prototypes or functions to prove a concept, then refactor and re-implement in purer OO as the requirements and solution become clearer.
<p>
I assume Ruby doesn't have the 'Everything must be an object' OO puritanism of Java.
</p><p>
I would look at Ruby but getting up to speed on C++ is work enough and I don't see Ruby bringing in a salary anytime soon.
</p><p>
I plan to learn the minimal PHP and Python to get by with those should I need to hack some of either language but I dislike them both (although knowhere near the degree of vbscript).
</p><p>
Perhaps I can look at ruby once I have some more popular and widely-used, if less fashionable and modern, languages.
</p><p>
Besides, by the time I can learn Ruby, Perl 6 will have knicked most of its good bits anyway<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)

You are correct - you can use a functional style in Ruby if you wish.
<p>
Now that you mention it, it might be interesting to see how your code looks in Java.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>
