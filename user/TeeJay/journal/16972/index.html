<div class="span8">
<p>for some reason there is a popular assumption among some of the UK press and Parliament that attempting to <a href="http://politics.guardian.co.uk/libdems/story/0,9061,1129744,00.html">understand</a> and empathise with Palestinian Militants is to condone or support it.
<p>
Like the good lady says, there has to be a root cause to the problems in Palestine - and sticking your head in the sand won't help you find it, let alone solve it.
<p>
&lt;&lt;Dr Tonge's comments were condemned by the Israeli embassy, whose spokesman said: "We would not expect any human being - and surely not a British MP - to express an understanding of such atrocities."&gt;&gt;
<p>
.. so trying to or expressing understanding of why it happens is considered bad. What utter idiocy, especially on the same day as <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/israel/Story/0,2763,1129884,00.html">this</a>
<p>
There is clearly a terrible problem when the head of the British Jewish Delegation claims that Israel is treated unfairly because of 'bad press' and that it needs better PR. Israel doesn't need a better spin doctor - it needs to stop shooting peace campaigners, children and journalists, and stop its fence building and the bulldozing of homes and farms that go with it, it also needs to stop blockading trade and aid to palestine. If it managed to not act in an appalling manner it would not get bad press and as an unintentional side effect it would even bring it closer to peace.
<p>
Of course that isn't going to happen so they are looking for better spin doctors and blaming everbody else and crying 'anti-semite' or 'supporting terrorism' whenever somebody doesn't support them or questions the reasons behind what is happening.
