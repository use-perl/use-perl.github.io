<p>my dear god this language is ugly - its like the bastard offspring of Basic and Pascal that was raised by COBOL.
<p>
Some plucky python programmer wrote a basic Autodia parser based on the PHP handler and suggested it would only be 20 minutes work to patch the PHP version based on a little python knowledge.
<p>
yucky yucky yucky!
<p>
And I though PHP was a nasty little child

<h2>Overreacting</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Dom2/">Dom2</a> on 2003-06-27T08:52:26</h3>
I think you're being too harsh.  On quite a lot of levels, Python and Perl are very close indeed.   I don't think that a comparison to COBOL is fair at all - nothing similiar whatsoever.

<p>I'm quite surprised at how bad you've found it, though.  Generally, I find python code to be pretty readable and comprehensible.  Of course, you can write assembly in any language, but on the whole people don't seem to in python.

<p>It's not completely unfair.  Both Python and COBOL had "readability" in mind, especially for people who were new to programming.  It's no surprise to end up a little verbose in odd places.</p>

I find python code over-verbose...
<p>
why use a symbol for appending something to a value when you can use a word and some brackets???? Because of its verbosity I see python being even more unfriendly to non-english programmers.
</p><p>
I have managed to get a basic parser fetching out methods and discarding comments (hint to language writers out there - don't close multi-line comments with the same symbol it sucks and don't use three of them for god's sake!) and already found that it seems to lack sensible namespaces.
</p><p>
I am looking for a nice tutorial and introduction to python packages and objects.
</p><p>
So far delving deeper has not produced anything I like or that couldn't be done easier and quicker in perl or java.
</p><p>
Python would be a great language if C, Java and Perl didn't already exist - but they all do and offer more. It comes accross as the UNIX VB.
