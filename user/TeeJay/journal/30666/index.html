<p>So for this contract I'm working on data feeds, that are fairly complex - One of the other contractors did most of the work on buidling a parser using HOP crack, but I'm writing the tests.<br/><br/>Now the message format is pretty variable, but mostly tokenisable, with some freeform. The number of possible valid variations for a given place and date are huge, not to mention each subtype of the message being slightly different and having slightly different rules.<br/><br/>The thing is there is no official validity test for these messages, there is a huge book of rules that are for pilots reading these messages, but very little of it translates directly to machine recognition.<br/><br/>So today I'm doing the same test as the offical aviation met offices : chuck a days worth of data at your parser and see what looks broken.<br/><br/>Luckily for me instead of an Access Database, An excel spreadsheet, some macros and a dozen pairs of eyes (the recomended way to test the feeds), I have Test::More and a nice script that will run 10s of 000s of tests (1 per field per message), providing me with regression testing against what the old parsers would extract from given data.<br/><br/>Next step is to extract some more recent control data (the 100s of MB of data I've just been removing duplicates from and testing with are about 3 years old), and build a test against that as the standards have changed a bit in the last couple of years and now stations will provide data in whicever format they last read, whether 6 years ago or last week.<br/><br/>Then onto the specific edge case testing, and handling partial success in parsing data.<br/><br/>Phew - thats a lorra lorra tests.<br/><br/>Once that's done I'll be running the parsers side by side with the same data and comparing the differences in the db (and frontend).<br/><br/>A.</p>

<p>Maybe <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Test-LectroTest/" title="cpan.org">Test::LectroTest</a cpan.org> could be useful for your use case? Mind, my suggestion might be garbage, but that&#8217;s what &#8220;statistical testing&#8221; like you&#8217;re having to do generally reminds me of.</p>

Doesn't look much help at first glance.<br><br>I'm pretty happy with what I've got now - I now have the new parser working better than the previous one and passing all the original test sample.<br><br>Now I just need to build a 2nd test sample with more recent data and hand write documented edge-case tests.<br><br>The 2 test samples aren't documented because there are simply too many variations on the data, they are really more regression testing than unit testing but at a unit-test level
