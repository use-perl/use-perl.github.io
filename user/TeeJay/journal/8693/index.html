<div class="span8">
<p>I tried PHP properly for the first time this week.
<p>
Starting at the weekend, I downloaded a load of the Introductory Articles (and a bunch of the advanced ones too) from O Reilly's PHP dev centre.
<p>
Then I started porting my very-lightweight-cms from perl to php.
<p>
My first impression was that error reporting (something PHP considers a selling point, why?) is poor - marginally better than ASP.
<p>
My next impression was that the few error reports you do get are unhelpful.
<p>
Further impressions are : <ul>
<li> Object Orientation ? PHP objects seem to lack constructors, destructors, multiple inheritance and differentiation between attributes and methods.
<li> Database Access ? PHP lacks any decent Database access - you pass around a bunch of variables that aren't handled in a nice abstracted OO way like DBI and require different functions for different database!
</ul>
<p>
Overall I am very disappointed, although I have to admit PHP is better at a technical level than ASP - I managed a hell of lot more in an hour of ASP/VBScript than PHP despite not knowing VB and knowing Perl and C.
<p></p>

<h2>Objects and databases</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/vsergu/">vsergu</a> on 2002-10-31T16:46:28</h3>
PHP has constructors.  They're just named after the class and have some oddities (such as handling the return of the object magically).  And attributes and methods are distinguishable: methods have <code>()</code> after them.<br> <br>There are PHP classes for abstracting database operations.  I ended up writing my own DBI-ish one, though, which I suppose I should put out there some time.
