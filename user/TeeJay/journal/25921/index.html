No, actually I spent Tuesday Night hacking some <a href="http://maps.google.co.uk/">google maps</a> stuff. Yahoo just isn't providing maps in the UK so it is as good as useless.
<br><br>
Also despite what some bloggers at Yahoo have said, the gmaps API works just fine. The documentation and examples are all good, and the firefox javascript debugger (or plugin) really helps.
<br><br>
I've also been hacking the Class::DBI::Relationship::IsA code to work properly - I managed to fix a deep recursion bug and am probably 2/3 of the way through inheriting relationships. That leaves a couple of niggling bugs users have reported (but that don't actually impact on what I am using it for) and hopefully I can release a much better version in the next few weeks
<br><br>
I also have a huge backlog of fixes, feedback and bug reports for autodia that I haven't had the chance to work on. sorry.
<br><br>
Finally I am discussing maypole development on the list and not touching the code until I've got rt up to date and a decent plan for 2.12
<br><br>
Oh and there's also the dayjob (which has involved working behind a dialup modem) and doing a dozen jobs that don't involve writing a line of code.
<br>
We do have a nice new office though, with nice new rack, ikea furniture and pool table. I don't have anywhere to hang the Buffy Calender yet and have to navigate my way around large piles of computers and cables to get to my desk.
