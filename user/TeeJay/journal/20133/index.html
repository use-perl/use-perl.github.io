<p>At home and for family/friend projects I have been using Class::DBI (and now some maypole). At work we have been using Tangram and Class::Tangram.
<p>
Each has a load of stuff I wish the other had, and in tangram's case a load of stuff I wish would just go away (silent death, unreachable parts of the system, unintelligable and undocumented monolithic evil voodoo internals).
<p>
As we get bitten by yet another problem involving our complex bastardised mix of tangram, generated code, fastcgi and psa I am looking at if it might be quicker to just port what we need to CDBI.
<p>
Of course CDBI is not Tangram (thank f**k), so I plan on creating a nice Tangram-style API and wrapper around CDBI and a load of custom subclasses and plugins to give the features and flexibility (that are worthwhile) of Tangram as well as the transparency, maturity and sheer common-sense simplicity design of CDBI.
<p>
The name is something I have bandied around at work for a while, PINT, you can guess what it might stand for :)

you my friend are a very very crazy individual



<h2>where to start</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/TeeJay/">TeeJay</a> on 2004-07-30T08:40:40</h3>
I have already mucked with the accessor/mutator creation a little (very small couple of lines) to provide tangram style syntax for interacting with the attribute types that Class::DBI already supports
<p>
Next I am working on including most of the relationship types that Tangram provides with a similar syntax.
</p><p>
After that I need to work out a good way to add additional data types for attributes, but I will cross that bridge when I come to it.
</p><p>
Hopefully I can provide most of what we need, with the same syntax, and only have to rewrite a few dozen lines in the whole application to move to CDBI from Tangram.
