<div class="span8">
<p>After nearly a month of mucking about my <a href="http://droogs.org">droogs.org</a> domain is back on the superwebinterhighway.
<p>
Also yesterday I discovered the 'joy' of food poisoning, something I have avoided for nearly 30 years ( 8 of which I was vegetarian, which helps ). It got so bad I blacked out at about 4:30 AM yesterday morning after a deeply unpleasent experience starting at 11PM and getting worse until 5AM when I think I managed to evacuate the contents of my guts and what felt like most of my internal organs. I almost regret starting to eat fish again (trying to avoid farmed) seeing as it was a dodgy ASDA (Walmart's UK store) Tuna steak.
<p>
Anyway, I should be resubbing to all the lists that kicked me off - only the soap-lite mailing list was smart enough to probe my address and resubscribe me automagically - all the other mailing lists obviously fail to cope with domain renewal delays.
<p>
I knew the domain was renewed as soon as I checked my inbox - 900 spam and bounce mails in the day it was back, even while the domain didn't resolve I still got 5 - 10 spam a day.
