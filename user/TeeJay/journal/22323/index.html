<div class="span8">
<p>Yesterday I released <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/teejay/XML-DOM-BagOfTricks-0.01/lib/XML/DOM/BagOfTricks.pm">XML::DOM::BagOfTricks</a>, it is a small library that I am using to generate and manipulate XML using XML::DOM.
<p>
Any suggestions for improvements or new features much appreciated.
<p>
I have also spent the afternoon looking for a way to handle an Mbox folder for our mailing list system at work. Email::Folder is really nice, but is read-only (although casey said adding a way to delete messages is at the top of his todo list)
<p>
Next I tried Mail::Folder as that appeared to have a method to delete messages, but that won't install on my machine, and is so ruled out.
<p>
Which leaves Mail::Box..
<p>
Installing Mail::Box I said 'yes, install everything you think you might need'.. so it is, and on and all of Mail::* later.. hopefully the tests will pass..
<p>
I guess I will Thanks but No Thanks, when I install that on the staging and production servers.

<b>..BREAKING NEWS... BLUNKETT RESIGNS..</b>
<i>David Blunkett, the no longer Home Secretary has <a href="http://politics.guardian.co.uk/homeaffairs/story/0,11026,1374464,00.html">resigned after being warned that evidence had been found linking him to a fast-tracked visa for  his married lovers nanny</a>. This makes him a liar as well as an adulterer and authoritarian bully boy.. good riddance</i>
<p>
Mail::Box seems to have passed all its 100's of tests and installed.. joy

<h2>A few comments</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/mir/">mir</a> on 2004-12-15T19:07:37</h3>
<p>just from reading the docs:</p>
<ul> <li>You left <tt>XML::Xerces::</tt> in several places in the doc, I guess the Xerces part should be removed,</li>
<li>I am really confused about the <tt>getWhatever</tt> methods: do they get existing nodes or do they create new nodes? If they create new nodes, as I think  they do, then why not call them <tt>createWhatever</tt> or (better I think) <tt>newWhatever</tt>?</li>
<li>they're called "Red Hot Chili Peppers"</li>
<li>if you want ideas of methods to add to the module, you can have a look at <a href="http://www.xmltwig.com/module/domtwig/" title="xmltwig.com">XML::DOM::Twig</a xmltwig.com> an old attempt at extracting methods that made sense from XML::Twig and using them with XML::DOM.</li>
</ul>

&gt;&gt;You left XML::Xerces:: in several places in the doc&lt;&lt;
<p>
oops, so I did. Sorry. Will fix that later today
</p><p>
yes, the getFoo methods should perhaps be createFoo, or getNewFoo
</p><p>
meh - chili, shmilli<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)

XML::DOM::Twig is noted and will be assimilated.

<h2>Progress with mail thanks to google and cpan</h2>

Part of the mailshot management system we are building (CDBI,mysql,TT natch) is catching bounces and unsubscribe messages and coping with temporary problems like busy server or inbox quota limits, etc.
<p>
Luckily I think Mail::Box will allow me to manage an Mbox for each address quite nicely, once I get the drift of the Java style (lots of words, not much useful meaning.. no bloody examples!) documentation.
</p><p>
Also <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/freeside/Mail-DeliveryStatus-BounceParser-1.4/BounceParser.pm" title="cpan.org">Mail::DeliveryStatus::BounceParser</a cpan.org> makes it easy to discover the message-id, addresses and type of bounce from an email. Very handy indeed.
</p><p>
Shame it took so long to find the right modules for the task tho. Still quicker than writing and discovering all the pitfalls for myself.
