<p>This week I have been busy infringing various software patents. <br/><br/>Of course every week I work as a programmer I am implementing ideas, some that other people have thought worth patenting, usually they are billed for less than the price of a patent application to the client.<br/><br/>But this week I have been implementing a solution that allows somebody to use credit card details without having to re-enter them. The client asked, we provided, it is an obvious request with an obvious solution.<br/><br/>Also I found that dan crevier (http://blogs.msdn.com/dancre/ slashdotted for a couple of minutes) has patents on treating email contact information as an object, and autocompletion of email addresses in email clients - the former is unbelievably obvious, something I have just done in another project, and the latter of which I use every day in Thunderbird.<br/><br/>Perhaps microsoft and amazon should be grateful that the many many people who have to infringe their ridiculous patents haven't taken them to court yet to nullify them<br/><br/></p>

<p>I&#8217;ve heard it quoted that it takes about a million dollar to nullify a granted patent. I guess that&#8217;s why noone&#8217;s doing anything about the many ridiculous, but granted patents. The system is just grossly unbalanced; getting patents filed is so much cheaper than removing them that removing doesn&#8217;t happen.</p>

<p>Guess what will happen after you get the court to nullify one of the MSFT patents they bring against you? They will trot out another. And one million later, they&#8217;ll trot out another. And one million later, they&#8217;ll trot out another. And one million later, they&#8217;ll trot out another. And one million later, they&#8217;ll trot out another. It doesn&#8217;t matter how right you are. It doesn&#8217;t matter if you nullify every last patent they accuse you of violating. You&#8217;ll be crushed like a bug under a landslide of legal expenses.</p>

<p>Just like tattoos, uh?</p>

Ahm, that&#8217;s one way of looking it, uh, I guess.

Filing them is a painful way to remove tatoos.
