<p>I hadn't heard of this until today, when reading through some mail modules.
<p>
It seems to be the Email::* modules, is there anything else to it? A proof of concept webmail module would be really useful, or even just enough bits to build one without having to jump through dozens of hoops installing dozens of C libraries, and reconfiguring mail servers, as well as installing half of CPAN.
<p>
looking at perl.org - there doesn't seem to be much you can do to 'get involved' outside of joining the p5p and p6p mailing lists and adding modules to CPAN.. at least for free -- donating costs money.
<p>
It would be nice if there was a list of projects, like Maypole, The Email Project, or the now dead/dying/neglected P5ee project.
<p>
Would also be nice to link up with the Apache Foundation as they seem to be focussing on Java to the exclusion of all else when we could be partnering to provide a sane and compatible API accross languages for key things like web services, XML, etc as well as collaborating on things like RMI and Messaging between Java and perl in native formats.
<p>
I know I can only spare a few hours a month towards open source projects and I'd like to help, but its hard to see a way in - the perl lists are time-sinks, contributing requires money, and there isn't a place I can see where I can sign up to help either a specific project like the Perl Email Project or anything... I'd like to work on improving searching for search.cpan.org but as Acme points out its T0p Sekr1t for some reason and  is too lame to be useful sometimes.

<h2>The Email Project</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/cwest/">cwest</a> on 2004-06-29T15:24:13</h3>
I joined recently. Not buy subscribing to a mailing list or putting my name on a wiki, but with code. Email-Send, Email-Address, Email-Simple-Creator. In fact, with those and my Net-IMAP-Simple module, you've got a good start for a webmail client.<br> <br>Alternatively, you could look at Email-Store and Maypole. Or just wait till Simon is finished glueing them together.<br> <br>

I think the problem is that there's no place to go to figure out what needs help, nor is there any easy way to discuss a proposed new module, an API, etc.

zackly!
<p>
I was hoping for a simple page with
</p><ul>
<li>goals</li>
<li>guidelines</li>
<li>deliverables</li>
<li>acheivements</li>
<li><nobr> <wbr></nobr>.. and most importanly - somebody you can ask about it all.</li>
</ul>
I believe the NMS project has all these. It would be nice if there was a projects.perl.org listing things like the NMS, Email, P5EE (or whatever replaces it), CPANPLUS, Maypole, etc.
<p>
Also a list of Perl Applications, would be quite cool.

<h2>Another project ...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/rob_au/">rob_au</a> on 2004-06-30T04:13:09</h3>
I would note that there is also the DateTime project (<a href="http://datetime.perl.org/" title="perl.org">http://datetime.perl.org</a perl.org>) and POE (<a href="http://poe.perl.org/" title="perl.org">http://poe.perl.org</a perl.org>) which are worthy timesinks (although I don't know how active the DateTime project has been of late).

DateTime has been low key recently because many of the core problems are solved.  However, there's still lots left to do.  There are many other calendars to be implemented, we could use modules for holidays, and there's not much in DateTime::Fiscal.

<h2>Join up with the Phalanx project!</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/petdance/">petdance</a> on 2004-06-30T16:32:49</h3>
The Phalanx project has your name on it!  Help beef up the tests of Perl, CPAN and Ponie.
<p>
<a href="http://qa.perl.org/phalanx" title="perl.org">http://qa.perl.org/phalanx</a perl.org>
</p><p>
Phalanx is undergoing some changes in how it'll work, so for now, join the perl-qa mailing list at lists.perl.org and keep an eye on it.</p>
