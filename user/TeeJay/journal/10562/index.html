This makes paging large data sets truly horrid, as you have to nest subselects at least three deep to have any sense of order because rownum is calculated before the ordering.
<p>
gah! MySQL is so much easier for day to day work!

<p>Yes, but what do you do for page two, when you want 50 &lt; ROWNUM &lt; 100?</p>

exactly.
<p>
This is much easier in MySQL.
</p><p>
We will probably move most this kind of SQL (large blocks) into Phrasebook classes, just doing an
execute_query('queryname',%args) or something.
</p><p>
If rownum was computed after the order by then it would be very useful - shame it isn't.
</p><p>
btw - we have about 8 O Reilly PL/SQL and Oracle books scattered around the desk of the dev team - I don't have time to read them tho, thats why have the TOAD jockies to keep the scary bad bits of oracle hidden in nice procedures and objects and then wrapped in nice layers of perl. (although some of it would be better wrapped in concrete and dumped in the north sea).

select myrownum,stuff from(select (rownum) myrownum,stuff from mytable) where myrownum&gt;50 and myrownum100<br/><br/>you're right, but this does.. not sure why it doesn't allow you to alias the rownum in the outer query

<h2>Re:Rownum?</h2>

the only reason I think the rownum concept has merit, is if you want to have a query on a table that is ordered by something other than the primary key - and you want to find a particular value, and view the rows around it.<br> <br><br/><br/>if there is an easy way to do that using limits and offsets let me know.. I'm trying to make a dictionary page that finds a word and prints nearby words (in mysql) - while reading up on it I found the oracle rownum stuff and decided it would be easier with that. <br> <br><br/><br/>I guess I could do a:
select count(1) from words where word.. and use that as an offset. which is probably just as easy as the rownum, glad to see I answered my own question and changed my opinion about the rownum vs limit/offset in the same post as I was writing it - I'll post it anyways to see what people think.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:P

<h2>Paging</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jdavidb/">jdavidb</a> on 2003-02-13T20:45:01</h3>
<p>I presume you've already <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/jdavidb/journal/10242" title="perl.org">done this</a perl.org>, since you mentioned nesting queries three levels deep.</p>

<p>Learn from how we do it in Perl.  Got useful functionality that looks ugly, even hacking the language?  Encapsulate it in a module.  Abstract out the parameters you need (lower bound, upper bound, maybe table name and where clause if you want to use dynamic SQL), then stick it in a stored procedure.</p>

<p> <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/orbestprac/" title="oreilly.com">Oracle PL/SQL Best Practices</a oreilly.com> says:</p>
<ul>
<li>SQL-04: Put single-row fetches inside functions; never hardcode a query in your block.</li>
<li>SQL-06: Define multi-row cursors in packages so they can be used from multiple programs.</li> </ul>
<p>Or, to generalize, encapsulate your queries in stored packages, procedures, and functions.  Makes things reusable and, more importantly, nice and clean for you and your successors.</p>

<h2>Re:Paging</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jdavidb/">jdavidb</a> on 2003-02-13T20:52:42</h3>
<p>Hmm, even better, from the beginning of the chapter:</p>

<p>SQL-00: Establish and follow clear rules for how to write SQL in your application.</p>

<ul>
<li>Never repeat a SQL statement.</li>
<li>Encapsulate all SQL statements behind a procedural interface (usually a package).</li>
<li>Write your code assuming that the underlying data structures will change.</li>
<li>Take advantage of PL/SQL-specific enhancements for SQL.</li>
</ul>

<p>Okay, not all of that was relevant here, but the point was, once you've written the triple-nested select, encapsulate so from now on you can use a page.next50entries routine.</p>

<h2>ROW_NUMBER()</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/runrig/">runrig</a> on 2008-12-20T02:42:36</h3>
A little late to this thread...but Oracle has support for this with "ROW_NUMBER() OVER..." (along with other useful "Analytic Functions" involving "...OVER...").
