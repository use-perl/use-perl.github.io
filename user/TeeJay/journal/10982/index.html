<p>so - how about a nice site about cool or new perl projects, kind of like freshmeat but without all the python and php crud ;)
<p>
Although CPAN provides some scripts and applications (such as Template Toolkit, Openframe and Autodia), it is more used for Modules and scripts and applications are kind of over-looked. I mean how many perl mongers associate CPAN with applications rather than modules?
<p>
I like the idea of a nice site somewhere between o reilly's opendir, cpan and freshmeat where you have blurb on a project, its documentation in a standard format ala cpan, standard installation ala cpan and project info ala sourceforge / freshmeat, perhaps even following the foundry idea in sourceforge too.
<p>
Is it worth it ? any other thoughts ?

<h2>Good idea...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Ranguard/">Ranguard</a> on 2003-03-11T13:50:29</h3>
<p>There are several projects (such as <a href="http://www.movabletype.org/" title="movabletype.org">http://www.movabletype.org/</a movabletype.org> - news / blog system) which I have only just come across - which are well coded perl systems.
</p>
<p>
The point being, it took me a long time to find this, having a central place (even just as a lookup database to start with) for existing perl projects would be great.
</p>
<p>
The ideal of having a single install process would be great, but probably take a long time to get running.

There are only simple requirements for CPAN - I am sure we can build a basic system using PAR or rpm or Makefile.PL. I think using a common and/or subset of installation methods would really help perl application growth.
<p>
It should be simple enough to build a blog with categories for things like Charting, Content Management, Blogs, etc. You could also search on equivilent eg enter phpnuke and you get slashcode, etc.

<h2>What would be the point?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/mir/">mir</a> on 2003-03-11T15:42:47</h3>
<p>I don't think that's a good idea</p>
<p>When I am looking for libraries to help me code in Perl I go to CPAN, because the language of the library is indeed quite important. But when I am looking for a canned tool to do something, I could not care less in which language it is coded, as long as I can run it. So I go to Freshmeat.</p>
<p>Why would I limit myself to tools written in Perl? A random example: <a href="http://freshmeat.net/projects/mailman" title="freshmeat.net">Mailman </a freshmeat.net> is a pretty good mailing list manager. The fact that it is written in Python does not prevent it from being used to manage <a href="http://www.pm.org/mailman/listinfo/" title="pm.org">perl monger lists</a pm.org> Why would I want to use Majordomo (written in Perl) when Mailman is clearly superior?</p>
<p>Note also that you can browse all 2500+ <a href="http://freshmeat.net/browse/176/?topic_id=176" title="freshmeat.net">
Perl project on Freshmeat.</a freshmeat.net> </p>
<p>So why would we duplicate a system that exists and that works well?</p>

If you think you're likely to want to customize a given app, having it be in Perl can be a plus.  It's unlikely I'll ever tweak mailman much, because it'd require me to learn a whole new language just to do it.  I use it anyway, of course, but it'd be cool if it was in Perl.

<h2>_C_PAN</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/davorg/">davorg</a> on 2003-03-11T15:44:56</h3>
<p>I think it's important to remember what the "C" in CPAN stands for. CPAN should be the one-stop shop for all your Perl code requirements.</p>
<p>It's true that CPAN is mostly used for modules (the<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/scripts directory is hardly used) and it's true that the distribution and installation processes used for modules are not a good fit for full applications, but neither of these seem to me to be a good reason for going off and doing this elsewhere. You should be looking at how you can extend the existing CPAN system to incorpoaret these new requirements.</p>
<p>But, yes, the idea of having a centralised repository of Perl applications is a good one. Even if it starts off by just being a directory.</p>

Definately a directory.
<p>
I feel sure that many perl developers, as I did, do not release to CPAN for several reasons..
</p><ul>
<li> Code Unreadiness, I put off uploading autodia until relatively recently - a directory would be able to  warn that code is experimental.</li>
<li> Size, Developers are usually reluctant to upload massive projects to CPAN, a directory will be for metadata.</li>
<li> CPAN works very well for modules but seems less suited to applications - a directory would suit projects that don't map well to cpan because they are encumbered by licensing, strange installation, etc.</li>
</ul>
The problem freshmeat is that it is huge and searches don't always return what you are looking for, frequently you get a dozen cruddy php scripts obscuring a nice little perl script.
<p>
Also freshmeat doesn't offer any perl specific features such as Module or Version requirements, Testing and QA standards, or whatever perl developers want.
</p><p>
Essentially this is a scratch for two of my own itches - one for seeing where there are holes in the perl application basket, and two for finding applications that I know are in perl so that they can be integrated nicely in a perl environment.
</p><p>
I would also like to bundle some of the applications with articles - for example a tutorial on integrating cvsweb, bugzilla and blosxom as I did here - a handful of perl applications that integrate very easily.
</p><p>

<p>I am sorry, but this is pure biggotery. As much as I love Perl, the fact that a piece of software is written in Perl or in PHP tells me nothing about its quality.</p> </div></blockquote>

Not really.
<p>
I have actually found this problem in real projects.
</p><p>
Why would I want to install mod_php on my server for the sake of a script written in a dodgy language by somebody who obviously thinks that decent variable scoping, namespaces, modules etc aren't worth it.
</p><p>
Integrating perl applications is nice - when you have a bunch of tools written in perl you can add your own custom configuration and code-sharing / integration with a couple of perl modules.

I'm not sure that Perl needs an archiving solution for the various software projects. CPAN, SourceForge do quite well at this. But I think that more has to be done to highlight quality open source applications that use Perl. Perhaps an area of use.perl.org would work?
