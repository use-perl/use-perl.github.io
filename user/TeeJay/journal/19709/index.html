<h1>Fresh XP install (on brand new laptop)</h1>

<div class="span8">
<p>My wife has a nice new laptop, it came with windows XP (presumably with recent service packs applied, I certainly hope so), and Word 2003.
<p>
Its already getting on both of our nerves. The trackpad doesn't act as a button unlike my trusty old linux laptop. Word will
no longer start until we register over the phone (yeah right) or over the internet.
<p>
Knowing how bad XP default install is, I decided that before Sam was safe to surf the web, that I should install all the updates from the website and replace IE with Firefox. Of course, within 10 minutes of starting the download, IE has crashed and the connection died inexplicably. Joy! I can only hope that I can download and install the patches before her machine is some
script kiddies zombie and sending spam or accumulating child porn (seriously, it happens and you're a fool if you think your
XP machine is somehow safe). Great, I can't even disconnect the line through XP's GUI, time for yet another reboot.
<p>
This will be a fun afternoon, not. Kungfuftr told me last week how he let his girlfriend use his XP laptop for the afternoon
(after he had downloaded the updates and set it up to be a bit more secure), and after just a couple of hours surfing popular mainstream websites it was already riddled with spyware and junk. SP2 won't help much either judging by the reports from Chaos Manor or RC1 (summary : don't touch it unless you love being a microsoft guinea pig and want to experience severely broken system type bug testing for yourself).
<p>
In other news, IE6 still has issues rendering basic HTML and images. It can't
do Transparent PNG and has inexplicably placed an image several pixels inside
a table cell despite both the cell and the image being left aligned and there
being cellpadding and cellspacing of 0. Why do people still use, or worse -
design specifically for, this outdated excuse for a browser. Why for the love of
god does it still open new windows with whatever the first window was looking
at, who's damned stupid idea was that?
<p>
For all the apparent usability gains I find windows XP even harder to use and
so does my wife. Any useful stuff that used to be easy to find is hidden away.
Finding and setting the 'internet firewall' is nontrivial and it isn't much of
a firewall either. As for stability and reliability, its already crashed
several times, and has issues disconnecting dialup ppp. Its also painfully
slow on a 2.8 GHz machine with plenty of RAM and HDD. Booting takes up to a
minute with another minute while it adds a bunch of unused 'tool's to the
toolbox down by the clock some of which refuse to go away - how is MSN
Messenger an essential system tool that can't be removed, ffs! So MSN is now
on the desktop, as are a dozen other brash loud icons for equally brash and
useless online services and software that we won't need or use, while 'My
Documents' is no longer on the desktop to start with -- probably because of
the confusion caused by having a choice of Username's documents, shared
documents and my documents, being scattered around the hard drive, with
unknown permissions and unclear ownership.
<p>
I fear its going to take a few more evenings removing useless cruft, and
scouring the internet for tips on making the machine perform at an adequate
speed. Any activity within 10 minutes of booting or resuming (from standby) is
painfully slow (much slower than our old 400 Mhz P2 running win98) as is any
networking or peripheral task such as printing or connecting or disconnecting
to/from the internet.

<h2>a bit more secure!?!?!</h2>

right... for those that don't know... I'm a sys admin by trade and a bloody paranoid one at that. Not only do I install updates immeadiately on any new windows install, but I also restrict running services, change group policies and also change all display preferences to make it a little nippier. That aside, my fiancee (get it right aaron) has a very restricted account which doesn't let a lot happen (infact it won't allow activex to be run unless it's been signed)... however even within an hour of her using it, it was laced with 2 spyware agents (ones that install themselves) and one malware agent (a ruddy virus!). The most important thing you can do in my opinion is to get rid of internet explorer (not uninstall, too many things rely on it, just make it extremely difficult to find and use) and use something along the lines of firefox!
