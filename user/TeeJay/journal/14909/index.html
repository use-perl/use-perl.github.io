<p>Judging by how my job hunting has been going - it is far healthier now than 6 months ago (don't ask).
<p>
The graph at <a href="http://www.jobstats.co.uk/jobstats.d/Details.d/Trends.d/SKILL/PERL.d/index.html">jobstats.co.uk</a> seems to have a rather reassuring shape to it.
<p>
If only there were decent jobs outside of the major cities though. With all the hype about the internet and working from home there is still pretty much serious teleworking going on in the UK and not a hope of actually affording a house anywhere near a decent job.
<p>
As proof of this the salary for a web developer in Truro, Cornwall is 15 to 18 thousand pounds a year. If you were to get a mortgage in truro you would need a mortgage between 6 and 8 times your salary!! I was lucky in that I managed to buy a house (that needed some work) 3 miles from truro for *only* 105,000 while working in london, this is the cheapest house we have seen in the area and the average salary is about 11,000 compared to the average house price of 120,000 - how fucked is that?
