<p><DrHyde> mentoring is cool, but london.pm mentoring never goes anywhere
<Greg> what perl needs is a some sort of standard enterprise module set
* TeeJay thinks certification is a good idea, but probably would be less political/problematic if we left it to novell and/or others
<mstevens> greg: we should form a project
<mstevens> greg: but what could we call it
<TeeJay> thats *so* not even funnt
<Greg> hmm, p5eek!
<TeeJay> what about extending the bundle idea with toolkits or something
<TeeJay> like super-bundles
<TeeJay> with added er.. 'value'
<TeeJay> um..
<Greg> s/toolkits/wizards/
<Greg> wizard processes
<Greg> call them smart-bundles
<Greg> you can grab the bundle, run the wizard and it will create skeleton code for you using its bundle
<TeeJay> are you serious or taking the piss - its hard to tell
<Greg> thats the genius of it ;-)
<TeeJay> bah
<TeeJay> its entirely plausable, all the bits are there
<TeeJay> its just the packaging and polishing
<TeeJay> as usual
<Greg> so imagine you start a new project, its going to be web based and use a db, you might grab the persistence and templating smart bundles
<Greg> and use them to get you some good skeletal modules for both halfs
<Greg> using best of breed, and latest version modules
<TeeJay> yup and the wizard will ask you pertinent questions about your webserver and needs
<TeeJay> again, possible and useful.. but..
<Greg> all we need is to harness the awesome power of open source!
<TeeJay> no, thats easy, its sitting down and doing it
<Greg> just get a mailing list, announce it and you'll get people excited
<Greg> itll be great
<TeeJay> no, thats bad
* TeeJay has started to release code, then do a mailing list and announcement later
<TeeJay> shame nobody is interested in ebXML as the module is a good start
<Greg> they probably dont get it, now packaging it as a smart bundle with a helpful wizard would make all the difference
<Greg> people dont want to download an ebXML module, they want to download solutions to their development needs
<Greg> they want solutions not technologies
<Greg> smartbundles given them solutions!
<TeeJay> stop, you're starting to sound like an MD
<TeeJay> next you'll be saying that we don't need project management
<Greg> we need employees to take personal responsibility
<Greg> for their work and their customers
<Greg> focus less on technologies and more on giving our customers what they want timely well executed solutions
<Greg> using the power of smart-bundles
* TeeJay runs back to his C++
* bob slaps Greg to snap him out it
<Greg> the sba (smart-bundle agent) would be able to handle a lot of the display code required for the wizard, and would be Q&A based
<TeeJay> 'I see dead projects'
<Greg> it would then pass these answers off the to the real guts of the wizard, meaning the wizard could spent its time crafting the code
<TeeJay> 'they wont go away, they keep on talking to me'
* bob releases a monkey, to see if it will distract greg
* Greg hands bob a network monitoring SB
<Greg> see thats the great thing about SB's they dont have to be module based they can be about applications as well, in fact .... OH MONKEY!
* Greg gets out his pan pipes and plays a merry tune for the monkey
* bob watches the monkey dance
