I really need to check one of these days and see if sloccount ignores POD, __END__ and __DATA__ blocks, and heredocs properly.<br><br>Note to self, if not, write Perl::Sloccount.<br><br>Secondly, one interesting problem I've noticed is that when my codebases get to around 50,000 lines of code, they stop growing.<br><br>It's as if the rate at which problems can be factored out and moved into CPAN modules, plus general refactoring, cancels out the code growth for new features.<br><br>That or I guess I might be getting bored with that problem<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

Yeah - This is 40k LoC over several sets of modules.<br><br>The longer I work on them the less the LoC grows.. sometimes the LoC shrink as I refactor the code to be better or replace a wheel I reinvented with one from CPAN.<br>

All it tells me is that SLOCCount is based on false premises. It's just stupid to think that a year of programming is worth a million dollars. Who wrote SLOCCount? A programmer, duh!<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) I'm sure you can find ways of arguing that secretaries are worth a million dollars (most are worth way more than they earn, that's for sure), janitors are worth a million dollars, security personel, etc..

All your comment tells me is that it's based on false premises<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br><br>Firstly, the dollar value sloccount sets is based on effort, not value, and for a finished product, and is based on standard estimate models with a reasonable track record.<br><br>That is, if that code was a finished product, how much should it have cost to develop.<br><br>
