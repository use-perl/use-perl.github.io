<p>O2 who have managed to piss me off in oh so many ways (from changing job requirements between interviews, to refusing to provide me with a contract phone because I didn't have any credit cards and hence no credit rating but owned my own bloody house), continue to annoy me with a cold calling scheme they have outsourced, and claims to be 'customer service' - when it spends 10 minutes asking me about my fucking mobile contract (which I'm tied to for another 6 months) before trying to sell me a competing O2 service - one that I previously had and I know cost me just as much but without any customer service and rubbish motorola phones.<br/><br/>I politely pointed out that given my hourly rate - them wasting 10 minutes of my time, costs more than I'm likely to ever save. God! I hate hate hate being cold called.<br/><br/>Hate!</p>

<h2>Cold Caller Destruction Button</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ajt/">ajt</a> on 2006-03-06T12:49:28</h3>
<p>I know how to feel. I want a button on my phone that when a cold caller rings, I press the "Red" button and the person on the call centre is electrocuted.</p>

<p>The first company I hate is "Progressive" a job agency that ring me at work about every month to try and sell me contractors - even though I tell them I'm not in a position hire anyeone. My second gripe is my own bank that rings to check up that I'm happy - but first they need me to confirm some confidential details to make sure I'm me - I did check and it wasn't a phising scam, it really was my bank...</p>
