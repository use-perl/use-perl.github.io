<div class="span8">
<p>One of the reasons I so desperately want a new job is (after the general cluelessness, lack of professionalism, and shockingly low pay) is the blinkered attitude to technology.
<p>
Despite our servers being hacked several times in a couple of years, we have not moved away from IIS and are still using windows 2000 for web serving.
<p>
Since I started we now have 4 linux boxes - 1 development server, 1 production, 1 Research / Desktop box, and a new linux firewall.
<p>
The job here despite a major Apache/mod_perl/Tomcat deployment on a large flagship project continues to be with ASP on IIS. This is because despite 2/3 developers being PHP and Perl developers our director reckons that ASP is the bee's knees.
<p>
Now I know that we are going to be stuck using a platform and product that is no longer supported,  online documentation is already dissappearing due to bitrot, limited space, etc so it becomes harder to find any useful information on ASP as everybody moves to .net or java.
<p>
ASP is essentially a dead end technology - there is no upgrade path. If you want to stick with MS technology then you will have to throw away all your vbscript asp pages and rewrite them.
<p>
Any bugs in ASP, and there are a lot of problems in ASP, are here to stay as I haven't seen any ASP patches, upgrades or fixes that didn't require moving .net .
<p>
To think that we are getting another ASP developer when we should be thinking about how to escape the sinking ship that is ASP to Java, PHP or Perl is chilling.
<p>
If anyone needs a perl hacker who can do ASP, PHP, Perl, Linux, Apache, mod_perl, MySQL, SQL Server, Oracle, Postgres - let me know !!</p>
