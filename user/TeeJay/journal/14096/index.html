<p>Sometimes I am still surprised at the utter idoicy and cluelessness that abounds in the internet industry. Todays shock was the Royal Bank of Scotland 'online business banking'.
<p>
I visited the site while running Mozilla on Linux (because I like to get my work done, rather than lost, or interrupted by reboots/crashes or emailed to all and sundry by outlook virus) - the website (http://roylinedirect.rbs.co.uk - no www subhost because that would be too hard, lamers) declared that I needed internet explorer 4 or above on windows. Of course it couldn't detect which browser I was using (idots) but guessed (by the lack of vbscript) that it wasn't inept exploder. The <a href="http://roylinedirect.rbs.co.uk/info/techmain.htm#Netscape">FAQ</a> claims that netscape doesn't provide the security technology it needs - which would be what? vbscript exploits?
<p>
This website has to install a dozen custom components in your browser and then reboot. Once you have spent 20 minutes fucking about, you then spend anoher ten tediously registering including entering a 35 character security code.
<p>
When we used the site - it doesn't actually provide anything that couldn't be done quicker and easier through a normal website using normal ssl technology. Did I say these people were <b>idiots</b>?
<p>
bah!
