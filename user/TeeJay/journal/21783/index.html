<p>It only took me most of the afternoon to sort out, which I suppose isn't too bad, but I managed to compile win XP executables using pp -o.
<p>
The executable uses things like Net::HTTP and Crypt::SSLeay so it was nontrivial, and GPG to boot.
<p>
My machine here at work has MS .Net Framework installed but I also had to install the Microsoft Visual C++ toolkit 2003 and the Platform SDK for windows XP SP2, then I had to heavily hack PATH to include all the oddly named and located binary paths. Then I had to copy missing includes and librarys into the vcc-tk directory (lots of duplicates only a handful are actually needed).
<p>
Judicious use of windows search (and its annoying user interface), vcvars32.bat (ensure its in your path) and the links provided in the relevent thread of the <a href="http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.par/1682">perl.par newgroup</a> made it possible.
<p>
most of the problems boil down to MS tools putting libraries and executables all over the shop, and you having to specify the paths and/or move them around. Searching google and your own machine for the missing or broken file will eventually yield an environment that will compile binaries for your platform that should run on XP SP2.
<p>
Of course the easy way is to use the ready-built binarys of parl and pp that autrijus provides.

<h2>all because AS par ppm is over a year old</h2>

If activestate kept up with CPAN this would have been fine, instead I had to uninstall the ppm par and install from source, which kind of defeats the purpose of ppm.
<p>
Of course without AS I'd have to jump through even more hoops when using perl on WIN32.

<p>I use a perl compiled with <a href="http://mingw.org/" title="mingw.org">gcc</a mingw.org> to create my own PPMs. I've been able to create PPMs for PAR, Wx, XML::LibXML and others with relative ease. And they all work with a regular ActivePerl.</p>

annoyingly I now find that there is an resolved dependancy when it runs at the clients site.
<p>
This has lead me to a handy tool via google tho :
<a href="http://www.dependencywalker.com/" title="dependencywalker.com">dependency walker</a dependencywalker.com> which gives you nice dependency trees for your dll or exe files on 'doze -- shame it doesn't allow you to fix or bundle them.
