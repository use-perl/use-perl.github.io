<p>Jeff Merkey is playing silly buggers in court again - he even has is own website (because blogging your side always goes down with judges -- almost as well as representing yourself! ha ha!)
<p>
Apparently he has his own website and is prepared to sue anybody who calls him a prize muppet (and I have to admit he really does look a prize muppet, his own responses only seem to confirm that appearence to a reasonable person) in the threads on <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/140157/">LWN</a> or <a href="http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20050617213927771">groklaw</a>
<p>
Word up Jeff - reconsider litigation as a solution to everybody thinking you are a whining clueless cretinous twat with a napoleon complex, as from the saner side of the atlantic ocean it doesn't look to be helping.

You know, I can reach you through the federal courts in the UK.  "Buggery"?  Pretty vile stuff.  Go drink some body fluids -- you will feel better.

"silly buggers" is an english phrase, look it up.<br/><br/>I think any reasonable person would agree that mass libel litigation across the world (popping up in numerous places and threatening to sue people) while representing yourself could be regarded as "tomfoolery" see <a href="http://cgi.peak.org/user/jeremy/retort.cgi?British=side" title="peak.org">http://cgi.peak.org/user/jeremy/retort.cgi?British=side</a peak.org> for an explanation. By drinking body fluids - are talking about "taking the piss", another english phrase many yanks are unfamiliar with.<br/><br/>By the way, I doubt you have a case for libel in the UK. You really should learn to take this kind of stuff on the chin instead, then people would stop laughing at you. Suing everybody who mocked, joked or commented about your actions only reinforces peoples perception of you as a kook or fool.<br/><br/>Follow the advice I gave before. Libel is usually the last resort of liars, scoundrels and the eccentric. Better to show people are wrong than attempt to make every court in the world state that they are wrong.. and it's quicker and cheaper too. In a word - stop acting like a kook and people will stop thinking you're a kook.<br/><br/>I'm sure there are million more constructive things you can do with your time and money than hunt google for people talking about you. You could campaign against software patents, write some open source software, do something useful.<br/><br/>cheers,<br/><br/>A.

You know, I've never has much luck arguing with British folks -- it's ususally just better to give in and buy them abeer at the local pub.<br/><br/>SOme good advice, but people posting threats to murder my wife and children isn;t something I plan to take on the chin.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br/><br/>Jeff

Fair enough. Threats of violence are always unacceptable.

TeeJay,<br/><br/>Thanks for restoring my faith in the sanity of people.  I appreciate that you recognize that this is an unacceptable form of free speech.<br/><br/>Jeff

<p>What, PJ threatened your unborn child? Get real, the sky's blue here Jeff.</p>

<p>
Let's be honest, you've got a screw loose (another British saying with no sexual overtones with which you seem to have a problem).</p>
<p>
Get some counselling before you ruin what little reputation you have left.

Stuff it.   Time to add some british "poofs" to the complaint.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

Jeff,<br/><br/>I was curious if you could show us exactly where somebody was posting threats to murder your wife and children because I think the next thing to do is get the logs of the post and trace the IP address and then determine who it is.<br/><br/>I'm pretty certain I know though who is the biggest danger to your wife and children.  He's a complete lunatic and is quite often totally divorced from reality.  Now, I'm not certain this is the guy, but his name is Jeff Merkey.  He's an unstable nutcase, so be cautious if you approach him.
