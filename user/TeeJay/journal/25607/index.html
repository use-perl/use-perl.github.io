<p>I uploaded two minor revisions to Maypole last night - 2.10_pre2 and 2.10_pre2a.<br/><br/>I'm afraid I had a very long couple of days in London for my wife's operation.<br/><br/>On the 7th we had to get up at 5am to be at the Royal Free Nose, Ear & Throat Hospital (100 yards from Kings Cross) for 7:30. Like most londoners on thursday we passed within hours and meters of catastrophe without noticing.<br/><br/>In the hospital itself we heard over the phone there had been an explosion at Liverpool street, then within an hour the nurses moved a TV into the ward so we could se what on earth was going on (better than chinese whispers and everybody chattering on their mobiles).<br/><br/>Sam was supposed to have had her operation at 8:30 AM, but in the end didn't have it until gone lunchtime and without general anaesthetic as the anaesthetist had been called to kings cross to incubate casulties - luckily for us the surgeon did her operation while waiting for any ENT casulties to arrive, unluckily no general anaesthetic or even sedation meant that Sam could see and feel pretty much everything except the small area numbed with local anaesthetic. <br/><br/>The only ENT casulties from all the bombing appeared mid afternoon for treatment for perforated ear-drums, and anybody who could be kicked out of their bed was. By the time we were able to arrange a lift out of london (Taxis were totally unavailable by phone and required you fight your way into them on the street) it was gone 6 and it took them 45 minutes to drive from the far side of euston road to pentonville road, then another 2 hours to get back to south london.<br/><br/>Finally we got back to cornwall yesterday evening at about 8 and I quickly fixed the mistakes people had highlighted in my rushed 2.10 pre release (I wanted to get it out of the door before I disappeared to London for a few days).<br/><br/>Anyway back to normal -- we have a smoke testing Maypole site hosted by one of the nice chaps on the maypole list and 2.10 should be out next week (mid july) which is pretty much on schedule.<br/><br/>Then onto 2.11 which is where we really get stuck in and work on making it not just work but work well and easily.<br/><br/>
