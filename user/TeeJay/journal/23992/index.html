<p>I've finally pushed the website I have been working on for my family live.
<p>
You can now <a href="http://www.pukkaplants.co.uk/">buy Ornamental Grasses and Phormium</a> at the website.
<p>
The site uses Class::DBI to model the data and provide object-relational persistance, searching, etc, with a Maypole Backend and a lightweight mod_perl and Template Toolkit front end.
<p>
There is more detail in the powered-by-perl entry I added.
<p>
Some important notes are Redhat 9 is *so* unsuitable for server-usage, much of the delay was working around bugs in its perl and apache. I also had to redesign the website and how the stock was represented in the system.. never have your wife as project manager and client for a project like this. 
<p>
Also the quality of image you get from a decent Kodak digital camera compared to a 3 year old bargain basement fuji are incredible. I threw away a hundred photo's I took with the old camera and redid everything with the new one and the results are incredible.
<p></p>

<h2>another cause of delay</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/TeeJay/">TeeJay</a> on 2005-04-03T16:31:50</h3>
..was the ammount of DIY I've been doing now that it's spring.
<p>
So now we have freshly repainted master and spare bedroom (and I only had a roller for the spare *sigh*), new curtains, rails and tie backs, new lampshades, lamps and light switches, and then all the spring cleaning and tidying and organising and up and down the ladder into the loft and no sitting down on bank holidays for Teejay.
</p><p>
And now I've done the bedrooms and resealed the bathroom, that leaves the hallway and downstairs and we have hardly touched the garden since last summer so that needs doing, although I at least managed to cut the hedge and grass out the front so the place looks vaguely respectable.
</p><p><nobr> <wbr></nobr>..All of which means that the website rolls out a month or three late (and only 2 or 3 working days out of about 12 late), and that I have a huge backlog of patches and fixes and releases for my CPAN modules.

<p>I hope the plants site is going well.</p>

<p>You say you are using Maypole, how did you find it? I'm trying to use it at work for an Intranet project, and it sort of works. It feels like a really good idea, but I've had constant problems with it. Would you use it again?</p>

I need to learn it better.
<p>
Getting started was quick and while I developed the site maypole itself was under heavy development and a lot has changed.
</p><p>
Also I think there is plenty of room for speed improvements.
</p><p>
My next maypole project is Mayfly, which implements Bugzilla (and some ideas of my own) in Maypole.
</p><p>
I think this will really prove/stretch maypole and expose what work needs doing.
