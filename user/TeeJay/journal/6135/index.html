<p>Just finished watching a very good documentary on Channel 4 about Death (Channel 4 breaking taboo's again it manages to discuss death in grown-up way). The program covered 3 women who died of ovarian cancer - something very significant to me because my own mother died from ovarian cancer just before christmas. I watched the program and found it both touching and informative - I probably understand what my Mum went through more now than before as well as getting more background on the subject in general.<br/><br/>It also ties in with the Daily Mail reporting how you are 10% more likely to survive cancer if you live in continental europe rather than britain.<br/><br/>Watching the sufferers go through chemotherapy or choosing to aim for a better quality of life reinforces my view that too much emphasis is placed in hunting for a cure instead of prevention and quality of life. Both medical and pharmacutical industry seem to be more interested in treating the tumour than the person - usually at great expense/profit.<br/><br/>On a lighter note - I spoke too soon about bugs in my freelance project : 10 minutes into documentation this evening I found a showstopper and a couple of typos and so won't finish til tomorrow evening after spending 30 minutes debugging instead of documenting.</p>
