<p>I just found <a href="http://www.zeroc.com/ice.html">Ice</a> linked from Miguel's blog. It looks really interesting but they haven't released a Perl implementation. Given there is a C++ implementation it wouldn't be that hard to do.
<br><br>
<b>update:</b> apparently there isn't "any commercial demand for a Perl version of Ice", but how much demand do you need to recoup the cost of building/releasing an opensource prototype? There are a hell of a lot of perl developers who would use it and some would I imagine pay for the tech support.. or they could sponser and support somebody else to develop it. feh.

<p>...thanks for the pointer.</p>

<p>I'd imagine that python and PHP implementations exist means creating one for Perl would be straightforward, for someone who knows what they're doing.</p>

<p>What would also be interesting is a listing of how many cross-platform middleware systems have been published<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>

Yes I thought it looked interesting but I don't have the time to play with the C++ stuff and build a wrapper just to try it out.
<br> <br>
Marginally annoying that it supports PHP and Python but not perl. I guess there are more people for whom its cheaper to pay for stuff than code it yourself in those markets.
<br> <br>
It would be cool if we had a Perl API using the C++ Lib, commercially supported or not.

We may be building a perl interface to it soon. Watch this space.
