<p>this story at the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/2745629.stm">bbc</a> makes me glad i spend a little extra on decent coffee at a fair price for farmers.
<p>
I don't give much to oxfam or other international charities but I do try to buy ethically - organic and freetrade where affordable and possible.
<p>
I can never understand why people buy nescafe and shite like that - its not as nice flavoured as some of the fair trade coffees and hardly any cheaper - most of your money goes into executives and advertisers pockets.

I've said it <a href="/user/Purdy/journal/5927" title="perl.org">before</a perl.org> - where you spend your money does have an effect.<br> <br>Jason

<blockquote><div> <i> <br>Two of his children are underweight and chronically malnourished.<br> <br>He and his wife Johana have just had their third child in the earthen brick roadside hut they built themselves.<br> </i> </div></blockquote>While I agree that we should watch how we spend our money, I find it disturbing (and probably a big contributing factor of this problem) that a couple would decide to have a third child when they cannot provide for their first two.<br> <br>It is sad to see fellow human beings in these conditions but they can help themselves (at least partly) by living within their means, too.<br> <br>Jason

Actually if the industry was more healthy then the children would bring in an extra income.
<p>
its not like they are sending them to college or anything.
</p><p>
in any poverty situation, your children are your welfare, your sick cover and your nurses.
</p><p>
also they don't have access to contraception and are entitled to have children if they so wish - would you really wish forced abortions on them ?
</p><p>
If they have no means then an extra mouth makes little difference. Its not like they are going to spend money on disposable nappies or a nanny and then complain.
</p><p>
Its like telling homeless people that maybe if they didn't smoke or drink they wouldn't be homeless which is bullshit - if they didn't smoke or drink or fuck they would have no reason to live ! same applies to these people : hell you could afford a new car or holidays three times a year if you never checked your email or went out with friends or did anything fun ever!

My point is that they made a choice to bring another child into the world, a child that will be subjected to worse conditions their first two children.<br> <br>Contraceptions/abortions are besides the point (no, I wouldn't force abortions {if you couldn't tell, I'm pro-life}) - people should take serious time and thought into bringing a child into the world.  I seriously doubt this couple did and as a result, their family unit will be more strained and it doesn't help the overall economic situation.<br> <br>There's more to say, but this is a huge door that has been opened and I don't have the time to put forth all my thoughts.  I guess my bottom line is that if you cannot provide for your child (and that can be interpreted very loosely or in different ways), then perhaps you should not have a child.<br> <br>Jason

<h2>Starbucks</h2>

How can there be any doubt?  It's Starbucks.  It'll have that trademark overroasted taste.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)
<p>
I don't know your palate, so you might prefer Starbucks to other coffee roasters.  I tolerate Starbucks because they are a known quantity, and their coffee doesn't suck (although I'd prefer a twinge less roasting).
</p><p>
If you <b>really</b> want to make your dollars work for you with fair trade coffee, go elsewhere.  Kudos to Starbucks for creating awareness, but their still a large US Corporation.  True, they're a corporation that believes in fair trade coffee, offers benefits to part time staff and creates a lot of jobs.  But they still need to spend money on advertising and things that don't make the coffee taste any better...
</p><p>
Other coffee roasters market free trade coffee as well.  <a href="http://www.greenmountaincoffee.com/" title="greenmountaincoffee.com">Green Mountain Coffee</a greenmountaincoffee.com> does, and their corporate mission is more in line with social and environmental responsibility.  I've never tried them, so I can't say whether you'd prefer the taste of their roast.</p>
