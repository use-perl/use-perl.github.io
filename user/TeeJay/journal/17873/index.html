<p>As anybody who knows me or my journal will know - my pet project is <a href="http://droogs.org/autodia/">Autodia</a>, a small program (or rather a script and collection of associated modules) that generate UML Class Diagrams (which can also be abused as database diagrams) from pretty much anything (perl, c++, php, torque, dbi, sql, python and java).
<p>
It has been going for about 3 years I suppose, and in that time I have released about 20 versions (currently preparing 1.12 for release).
<p>
In that time I have received email from users in more than 50 countries - many from eastern europe, and even some from the far east.
<p>
I have also received patches and fixes from almost 30 people, thats on top of the many more bug reports I get.
<p>
And all this for a small programmers utility.
<p>
When I see people dispute the 'many eyes make bugs shallow' idea, I now know, that its often true - even though my project is small I get a huge ammount of help - I probably spend less than an hour a week on average working on it now, yet it continues to progress and improve with a flutter of patches and bug reports every month to my inbox.
<p>
of course because my tool is for programmers by programmers, users are more likely to give feedback, but it is a lot more than I expect or anticipated.
