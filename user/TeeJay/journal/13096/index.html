<h1>o2 website utterly useless</h1>

<div class="span8">
<p>congratulations o2 on a badly broken website - this takes some doing if you only provide web access for web accounts - at least cahoot works.
<p>
If you have 2 accounts with the same email address (because for the badly broken and very unhelpful manner in which it deals with credit refusals for instance) you will be unable to log into either! fantastic!
<p>
They use JSP and charge 50p a minute to find out what has gone wrong with your order - worse still their credit checking is very badly broken - I own a car, a mortgage, am married and have a fairly high income and am making repayments on a loan and credit card without problem but will they take the risk on me being able to pay 20 pounds a month for their lousy service - oh no of course not,
<p>
These idiots don't deserve my money - all these big businesses complaining about how difficult it is to make any money when they are busy trying to avoid dealing with customers and are more concerned with directors paychecks than ensuring that people who want a service and are willing to pay for it can't because of their badly broken systems and stupid giant centralised call centers that make even the smallest problem impassable forcing you to go to a competitor or worse still give up because its not worth the fucking bother.
<p>
o2 your jsp system is very badly broken and poorly designed sort it out or I will be forced to stick with orange or maybe try out 3 who might actually manage to get a phone somewhere I can get it rather than delivering to my home address where I won't be because I work for a fucking living!!

<h2>Is anyone here surprised?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ajt/">ajt</a> on 2003-06-27T16:22:51</h3>
<p>Is anyone here surprised that a large corporation spun out of BT is utterly useless, and has a web site that seems like it was designed with the sole purpose of not working.</p>

<p>Or, maybe I'm getting cynical........</p>



<h2>o2 shop no help either</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/TeeJay/">TeeJay</a> on 2003-06-28T17:14:05</h3>
I spent an hour trying to get an o2 phone from the shop today but according to then - they don't decide its the credit rating company - yet the credit rating company claims that the phone credit lender (who is so reluctant to lend me 25 quid worth of credit for one month) is supposed to give a reason.
<p>
O2 staff are very unhelpful in this - they can't over-ride anything even if the problem could be easily fixed.
</p><p>
It reminds me of the the natwest advert 'my wifes phone company has put procedures in place to ensure that I can never ever get a phone without first getting a credit card and spending recklessly'
</p><p>
what is it with business these days - everything has to be reduced to a simple form that is ticked and then TheComputer does stuff and the real human beings are unable to help becauae they are are entirely powerless.
</p><p>
Maybe the economy would be better if all these companies worried more about their customers and less about ensuring their directors are rolling in more money than they can ever spend.
