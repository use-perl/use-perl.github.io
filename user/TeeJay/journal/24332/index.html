<p>After using the fedora core 3 distro for a couple of weeks, I decided to give tap-to-click one more try.
After further googling and browsing through the fedora forum I found the vital incantation to make the synaptics touchpad in the nx6110 work correctly.
<br><br>
Apparently adding 'psmouse.proto=imps' to the kernel arguments in grub.conf would do the trick. I tried it and it worked. fantastic.
<br><br>
The redhat network update tool seems quite good but after first installing there were over 500 packages to update and up2date seemed to hang. Running the update manually through yum gave full details of the updates it was doing and asked a couple of questions but installed the hundreds of packages without trouble.
<br><br>
I had been planning to move everything to my new laptop and catch up the work I need to do or have promised to do to my CPAN modules but I have been too ill with a nasty flu to even work on my day job. Hopefully by early next week I'll be fit enough to get a few hours hacking C::DBI relationships in the evenings.

<h2>scrolly thing works too now</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/TeeJay/">TeeJay</a> on 2005-04-24T14:38:04</h3>
I have just noticed the scrolly bit works too now (tap, then scroll - nice) without eating up any of the touchpad itself in normal use. sweet.
