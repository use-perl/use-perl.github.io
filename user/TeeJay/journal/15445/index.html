<p>There is a very real danger to users of Internet Explorer and Outlook - There have now been 3 recorded cases of people <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/55/33636.html">prosecuted</a> in the UK for child porn offences because Trojans or Virus infected their systems and downloaded child pornography.
<p>
Many people don't seem to care that private correspondance and files could be emailed to all and sundry by mass-mailing worms, or that important files be deleted or altered, or that their comprimised computer is being browsed by strangers or being used to attack internet sites and infrastructure.
<p>
Maybe people will care when they find offensive images lying around on their hard disk or get a knock on the door from the police.
<p>
Inertia says people will think "that won't happen to me, it only happens so people who open and run files from strangers and I don't do that" or "what are the odds of that happening".

Alternatively it could be sold as a positive. It's just a question of getting the right spin. I can see the slogans now - "<i>Use Windows and have a ready-made excuse when your wife finds your porn stash!</i>"



<h2>I wonder how stupid those users are</h2>

It would be interesting to see whether the people who've successfully used the "trojans ate my homework" defence are still using Windows.



<h2>Hmmm</h2>

Y'know, I'll bet lots of people want to know about this.  I think I'll send an email to my entire address book...<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)
