<div class="span8">
<p>Today and yesterday I spent most of my time trying to install two different Bug Tracking Systems : mantis and bugzilla.
<p>
I am already biased towards bugzilla for 2 reasons - its proven in open source projects and its written in perl, while mantis is new to me and written in PHP.
<p>
After having to uninstall and reinstall various php binaries to get even a login screen I wasn't very impressed with mantis - the documentation is unclear and lacking.
<p>
The PHP code isn't very clear and I was glad when after wasting an afternoon and a couple of hours of this morning trying to get beyond a login screen I was able to give bugzilla a try.
<p>
Bugzilla installed easily enough, even before I read all of the documentation. The documentation is very helpful and the CPAN Bundle makes it a doddle to install.
<p>
We dumped the default redhat sendmail install and switched to exim.
<p>
Once I'd done that it *just worked* - no excuses.
<p>
Imagine my surprise, after being told by many people that the codebase to bugzilla was best described as a car crash, that it has moved to template toolkit.
<p>
With little effort and without even touching a cgi script I had branded and beautified the headers, footers and a couple of pages, adding my own toolbars based on those provided.
<p>
Once I dug into the database and read the documentation I was able to start hacking away, adding extra drop downs to forms to save typing users names, and even creating a new cgi script in about 10 minutes that gives a quick summary of current bug status and assignment.
<p>
There are many areas where the code could be refactored to fit in with the London.pm programming style : using an sql phrasebook and a nicer database abstraction layer as well as more use of templates for things like forms and result sets.
<p>
I could happliy hack away on bugzilla all day linking it into our systems for cvs, project management, documentation, etc.
