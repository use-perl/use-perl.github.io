<p>What is it about catalyst advocates that make them so catty and bitchy towards and about other projects?<br/><br/>Somebody posted a question to the maypole-users mailing list and was privately emailed offlist by somebody telling them to use Catalyst or Jifty instead, not even including the list or myself.<br/><br/>*sigh*<br/><br/>Ironically, it's these same people who cry foul when people call Perl dead or obselete or out of date, but are quite happy to bandy such terms around Perl projects that they consider out of favour - way to go!</p>

<p>I can't speak for the Jifty one, but the Catalyst community is pretty big by now. So isn't this a bit of a generalisation?</p>

<p>It also seems a bit mistargetted if you first say the Catalyst advocators are bitchy, but then say the post asked to use Catalyst <i>or Jifty</i> instead. So maybe somebody just doesn't like Maypole.</p>

There are a significant minority of Catalyst and DBIx::Class users who insist on ramming it down your throat or slinging mud at every other project at every opportunity.<br><br>Much the same as the annoying python fanboys who seem to be pained that other people still don't use the software that they love so much.<br><br>Both groups are the face that I see most of catalyst and python respectively. They may not represent them, but they are noisy and unwelcome and project an unpleasent image of the projects nonetheless.

<p>Isn't this true for every project that gained enough momentum? I (of course, as an insider) have heard enough silly anti-Catalyst rants and seen enough thrown feces. For DBIC, IIRC mst writes to these kind of people to make sure they understand that the community is not based on that kind of behaviour.</p> <p><blockquote> <div><i>Both groups are the face that I see most of catalyst and python respectively.

<p>I really don't see that much of an outstanding issue. Perl has the same problem, and as I said above, I'm pretty sure every large enough project will draw people of this kind to it. What do you suggest to make the situation better?</p>

No useful suggestions really - just wanted to get it off my chest.<br>

<p>Lack of perspective? Inferiority complex? Difficulty connecting faceless online users to real people? Ennui? Fatigue, PMS, lifestyle/health problems?</p>

I suspect whoever did it thought they were being helpful, but it does sound a lot like a Ruby advocate telling people not to use Perl.
