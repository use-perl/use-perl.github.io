<p>I now have my driving test booked. Sometime in Janurary (I am waiting for written confirmation) I will be able to take my practical exam and get a full driving license!
<p>
In the meantime I am getting as much practice in as possible. Being able to drive will be so helpful and make life a lot easier.

<h2>Driving--</h2>

Heh, I've driven two, maybe three times since I learned to drive.  It was a peer pressure thing.  Everybody said I should learn to do it.  I still hate driving as much as I did before, but now they have no excuse to rant at me.

<p>Of course, the laptop which I bought myself as a gift for passing the test has been <i>infinitely</i> more useful.  Make of that what you will.

I have waited about 10 years before learning to drive - now 27 years old I could have taken the test 10 years ago.
<p>
I didn't need to drive until now, but living in a rural area with a disabled spouse means that driving is a real necessity.
</p><p>
The bonus will be, being able to drive to somewhere nice at the weekend and move stuff about without having to blag a lift from somebody.
</p><p>
If I move back to london, then I can sell the car and put Full Clean Driving License on my CV
