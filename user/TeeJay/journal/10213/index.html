<p>Today I am generating some static HTML pages from a data structure.
<p>
HTML::Template makes this a difficult task in many ways.
<p>
Not only do I have to jump through hoops both in the HTML and the perl to make it at all possible, I still can't do anything useful.
<p>
One thing that is really bugging me is the lack of  variables inside the template - I can't create a flag inside the template and check it, this means I can't do something inside and inner loop based on the state of an external loop.
<p>
I really hope this place moves to TT soon, as H::T is just plain lame.

</div></blockquote>
It is my understanding that if you create your instance of HTML::Template with
<blockquote><div>
<code>global_vars =&gt; 1</code>
</div></blockquote>
then you inner &lt;TMPL_LOOP&gt; can see varibles outside its scope.  This won't give you the fuctionality of TT  but should make your life a little easier when you want to check flags and such that aren't in your current &lt;TMPL_LOOP&gt;



<h2>Wrong tool for the job?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/samtregar/">samtregar</a> on 2003-01-27T18:31:52</h3>
This sounds to me like a case of using the wrong tool for the job.  HTML::Template was designed to support a workflow wherein a Perl geek codes Perl and an HTML designer designs in HTML.  The template syntax is kept simple so that the HTML designer doesn't have to learn a whole new language just to create a template.  All the code goes in one place and all the HTML goes in another.  It's nirvana when you reach it, but there's no way to get there alone.
<p>
However, it sounds to me like you're a lone Perl geek hacking code <i>and</i> hacking templates.  For a job like that, TT makes a heck of a lot more sense.  Hell, from that perspective even Mason starts making sense.
</p><p>
So, in closing, use the right tool for the job.  Then you won't be tempted to slandor that poor wrench you're trying to use as a drill.

PS: All that said, I've never had an HTML generation problem I couldn't solve with HTML::Template.  If you post a full description on PerlMonks you'll be sure to get a solution.</p>

Then Template Toolkit does H::T's job better.
<p>
A designers using TT won't need to know any more than a designer using H::T.
</p><p>
But at the same time the same templates can acheive a great deal more without the ridiculous hoop jumping required with H::T.
</p><p>
A designer should not have to worry about many of the problems H::T brings with it. Scoping of variables and other problems make many simple HTML layout tasks hard or impossible.
</p><p>
This is why I think I that H::T is lame - it doesn't even do HTML Templating very well - which is what it claims to do on the tin.
</p><p>
The FAQ and documentation is thin on the ground and essential features are lacking such as template variables, the ability to get keys from hashes and the usability of TT.
</p><p>
I don't mean to slag off the product of somebodies work, but it quite simply doesn't deliver what its advocates or developers claim. The FAQ should give a long list of things that H::T can't do or makes difficult.

Enlighten me then, where should I start in the "long list of things that H::T can't do"?  I can't think of a single HTML task I haven't been able to with HTML::Template.  I build web applications all day long with HTML::Template and CGI::Application, and nothing has stopped me yet!

ok try looping through N lists concurrently,
or looping through the keys of a hash, or using an iterator object, or keeping track of presentation logic values with variables local to the template.
<p>
You can do anything with H::T assuming you totally mangle your data and code to squeeze everything into an array of hashes.
