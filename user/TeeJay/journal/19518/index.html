<div class="span8">
<p>This weekend I have planned to catch up on the coding I have been meaning to do for a while. Although I have been busy
with some personal and work and other coding recently in my spare time, i.e. when I am staying in guildford and have no
TV or wife for company, I haven't had time to catch up on my CPAN and other projects.
<p>
This morning I made a start on changing that. I spent much of this morning checking all the emails I have received
about Autodia and other stuff as well as checking the pages I noticed last night when I sorted out my bookmarks.
<p>
By 2:30 I had managed to refactor the <a href="http://www.chaosreigns.com/code/springgraph/">springgraph</a> perl
script into a module that worked under strict. I plan to integrate some  of the 'bounce' logic into the layout for
Autodia and release the module as SpringGraph on CPAN, although I am waiting for the author to respond to the email
asking if doing so would be ok (keeping copyright, credits, etc intact).
<p>
The rest of the afternoon was spent working through Autodia bug reports, patches and suggestions while taking regular
breaks in order to complete 'Lord of The Rings - Two Towers' on the PS2. Once I have completed the hidden level and
watched all the extras I will trade it in with some others and get 'Return of the King'. We have all 3 films on DVD
now, its only a matter of time until I persuade Sam (my wife) that it would be fun to watch them back to back. We also
have the LotR edition of Risk, but playing it is not a good way to keep a marriage intact ;)
<p>
How did I find the time for all this? My wife is away for the weekend so I have to squeeze in all the spare-time coding
I need to get done in between some minimal housework, feeding the cat and helping my father-in-law. He is a commercial
grower which means that he grows tens or hundreds of thousands of plants or trees or grasses on contract from either
seed or stock -- hard work : he works 7 day weeks from about march to september or november, so I will give him a hand
tomorrow (sunday) before putting in another evenings hacking.
<p>
Busy busy....
<p>
I have a new project lined up as well, following the theme of Autodia, I want to be able to manage and share tasks and
people between Evolution, MrProject/Planner and Bugzilla. Maybe toutdoux and MS Project later as well. VCS integration
would be cool so milestones could be linked with tags or versions in VCS (as well as the users). Oh yeah, would be good
if it talked to the gtt or timetracker files / program too. Hopefully I can do it in C++ (although I might still
prototype some of it in perl) using Xerces and QT.
<p>
<p>
sidenote to anybody interested in the 2.0 release of autodia -- this afternoon/evening/night I .. 
<ul>
- added umbrello output (experimental - doesn't seem to work)<br>
- fixed Perl Handler to cope with perl scripts as well as modules [bug reported via debian]<br>
- added a small tweak to Perl Handler to stop it complaining about uninitiated values at line 375<br>
- fixed python handler so inheritance works properly<br>
- fixed C++ handler to handle namespaces in types <br>
- fixed C++ handler to cope with inheriting from public foo or foo<br>
- fixed SQL handler to handle linebreaks in table declarations<br>
- fixed Umbrello Handler to cope with &lt;= 1.1 and now &gt;= 1.2.0 or style files<br>
- fixed Diagram module to ensure binary files are output in BINMODE for when on win32<br>
</ul></p>

I love when you have one of those days, the sense of accomplishment, the focus - everything<br> <br>Those days are the reason why I really like programming...
