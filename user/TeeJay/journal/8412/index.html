<p>Recently I looked at renting a flat.
<p>
The agency (who happens to have the landlord of the flat as a partner) then said we could have the flat if we went to their house and bought the money (i.e. security deposit, fees, etc).
<p>
After giving them the fees and security deposit and fees, they thanked us and said we'll send you a contract soon. This was a little disconcerting as we were lead to believe that we would be signing a contract.
<p>
The next day we received a letter saying we had given them a deposit ( deliberately ambiguous ) and had agreed to a 12 month contract - which we didn't.
<p>
To cut a long story short - these people lied, deceived and generally cheated us - they lied over the telephone, they lied in their advertisement, they lied in their office and they lied in their letters.
<p>
They even insulted and shouted at the CAB advisor when she called
<p>
Now we will contact every organisation available to expose them as fraudulent and to aid us in recovering our money because the County Court has found in their favour despite evidence that they take money by deception and falsely advertise.
<p>
Anybody who can get us pro-bono legal support or help or put us in touch with investigative reporters who can help us expose them - email me at rippedoff@droogs.org
