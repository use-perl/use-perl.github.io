<p>
It's interesting that you, and apparently many other people, see "cool stuff in perl" and "andy lesters personal blog with plugs for his other blogs and random shit his friends IM'd him" as mutually exclusive.
</p><p>
The fact is that Perlbuzz has <b>always</b> been at least partially "andy lesters personal blog with plugs for his other blogs and random shit his friends IM'd him", which sometimes overlaps with "cool stuff in perl".  I'm bemused that so many people are upset when one comes to the fore in front of another.

<p>Yes, I've always realized that "perlbuzz" is a vehicle for Andy Lester's self-promotion.  This is a large part of why it's a joke, and why I rarely bother to visit.</p>

You say "self-promotion" as if it's a bad thing.
<p>
If I've got something to say, and I think it's important, then I'm going to promote the vehicle for that.</p>

<p>It is, you don't, it isn't, and therefore you shouldn't.</p><p>Pudge provides a forum here without self-promotion, as does Tim Vroom (?) at Perlmonks.  Why can't you at least try to do the same?</p>

<p>
I just explained why I promote Perlbuzz and other things that I think are worth reading. You disagreed with the premises, but the answer is still the same.</p>

<p>I'll try this one more time.  There are two things under discussion here: promotion of Perl (or "important ideas"), and promotion of yourself as a minor internet celebrity.  If you have what you think are important ideas, or contributions to Perl's well-being, by all means argue for them.  If you want to become a celebrity, then try to do the DHH/37signals thing.  But don't confuse the two.</p><p>Your motives may not be at all self-centered, but I really can't tell.</p><p>Let me give you a few more examples:  Nicholas Clark contributes huge amounts of time to perl5 without self-promotion.  So does Raphael Garcia-Suarez.  I contribute a bit to CPAN without wanting to make an internet name for myself, as do many others.  You're welcome to make a living however you want, but don't ask me to respect your trying to be internet-famous for being internet-famous.</p>

My, that's a lot of suppositions in three paragraphs.  And so many orders to give me, too!
<p>
I'm not sure what you mean by the "try to do the DHH/37Signals" thing, but if I ever decide I want to become an "minor internet celebrity," I'll know who to ask for advice.
</p><p>
<i>don't ask me to respect your trying to be internet-famous for being internet-famous.</i>

Easy enough.  I've never asked anything from you, and I don't see a need to start.</p>

What part of "you're welcome to make a living however you want" is an oppressive order?  Do whatever you want on the internet!</p><blockquote><div><p>Easy enough. I've never asked anything from you, and I don't see a need to start.</p></div></blockquote><p>
Fair enough.  Let me take this opportunity to express my disdain.</p>

<p>You announced Perl&#160;Buzz with a huge ruckus about how inward-facing the Perl community is and that we need to fix that (which I still agree with) &#8211; and then it turns out to be a use.perl journal with a domain name and a mission statement. How&#8230; <em>pedestrian</em>.</p><p>If I were in the habit of writing advice articles of the sort you like to publish, there would be one about underpromising and overdelivering here.</p><p>(I feel the need to apologize for my persistent negativity; that&#8217;s because I agree with most of your observations and motivations and would <em>like</em> to be positive. But I cannot be dishonest. I considered unsubscribing from Perl&#160;Buzz (but did not, although may yet) because I&#8217;m tired of having to react with criticism. That&#8217;s no fun for anyone.)</p>

<p>

So don't react with criticism.  Nobody's forcing you to do so.
</p><p>
But by all means, if it's a chore to read something so pedestrian, I encourage you to unsubscribe with all speed.</p>

<p>It isn&#8217;t a chore, it&#8217;s just disappointing. What I&#8217;m saying above is that I&#8217;m adjusting my expectations (namely, of what you&#8217;ll do, based on things you say that I (continue to) respect and agree with).</p>



<blockquote>

That's certainly very kind of you, to lower your expectations such that you might still grace Perlbuzz with your readership.

<p>This has little to do with Perl&#160;Buzz. I can&#8217;t avoid you on p5p, module-authors or perl-qa, nor here really. Neither can you really avoid me. All of the above was only supposed to say that in spite of all appearance, I respect you and value most things you say and that my criticism so far has not been a result of personal dislike. Henceforth I shall simply leave it at that.</p>
