<p>Having worked with ASP for nearly 6 months I think I am qualified to say it is a pig. I could do the same  faster and easier using Apache::Template and a handful of perl modules.
<p>
What really bugs me is that people use it, and think its better than sliced bread! Worse still are sites that use ASP and can't even get the basics right - like for instance being able to see the friggin' front page! <a href="http://www.pcmag.com">PC Magazine</a> I am talking about you, you muppets! HTF do you make your homepage a 404!!
<p>
There are so many broken sites and many of them are either ASP or JSP. I think there is a reason for this..
<ul>
<li> Application, Presentation, Data all muddled into a page of HTML.. stupid, stupid, stupid
<li> VBScript - a crippled language with no merit that requires third party COM objects to be of any use at all.
<li> ASP/JSP are designed for people who can't program and don't understand the concepts of web development to write dynamic websites
<li> IIS is the platform for people who don't think about what they do
<li> Only an idiot would choose to use ASP for a website with more than a handful of simple dynamic pages.
</ul>
