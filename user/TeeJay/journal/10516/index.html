<div class="span8">
<p>despite appearences vcg is in active development, as you can see in this <a href="http://mail.gnome.org/archives/dia-list/2003-February/msg00029.html">announcement</a> by James Micheal DuPont who has just released the first fully GPL deuglified code.
<p>
Hopefully this should start some activity around the  new, cleaner codebase.
<p>
So far I know my own VCG.pm and Autodia (which will use VCG.pm some time this week) use it as an alternative to GraphViz (not that we need one, just that choice is good), as does JMdP's own introspector project. It is even being discussed that elements of the layout logic may be added to dia - which would make dia fantastic and be a big leap in catching up with visio.
<p>
I am doing a load of work on VCG.pm to release version 0.2 tonight at some point with much improved pod, an API more consistent with graphviz and a little nicer code.
<p>
It is starting to look a little less like leons code now, which is either good or bad - I haven't decided yet. I think I tend to write clearer (or probably verbose for some coders) code.
<p>
I still need to send marcel a patch for GraphViz::DBI, but as he mentioned he isn't really maintaining it I might offer to take over - not that I have the time, just that it would be fairly easy to hack on along with the related stuff I am doing.
<p>
I will take over the world with my m4d ch4Rt1nG Sk1lLz!!!!
