<p>Looks like my faith in oracle and mysql are founded somewhere in fact.
<p>
I trust oracle because its usally run by an expert somewhere and I don't have to worry about it. Every time I have worked with oracle it has been transparent enough to hardly affect my work.
<p>
I really like MySQL because so far it has met my needs, and been really easy to use and excellently documented.
<p>
eWeek did some comparisons <a href="http://www.mysql.com/eweek/index.html">here</a>
and surprise - they come out tops.
<p>
cool

<h2>No Postgres</h2>

Bah, why didn't they test that?  It would have been a useful addition...

yeah, I was dissapointed by that - if we had the example site we could test it against sqlite as well.
<p>
maybe we should contact them.

Probably they saw postgresql was first in all tests, even before Oracle, and that hurts<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)<br/><br/>I really like postgresql as it has almost all the features of Oracle except for the license cost<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...

<h2>JDBC</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Matts/">Matts</a> on 2003-02-11T21:46:01</h3>
It seems this test is a test of the quality of the JDBC driver more than anything. That's a shame.

<h2>Re:JDBC</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/TeeJay/">TeeJay</a> on 2003-02-11T22:13:58</h3>
Very True!
<p>
It seems that SQL Server JDBC and even ODBC drivers leave something to be desired.
</p><p>
I don't think any serious java project should consider SQL Server at the back end for that reason - as well as it not offering much value and not integrating as well in to vertical Java solutions by the likes of IBM.
</p><p>
This does show that MySQL would not be part of the system that would slow down any application though.
</p><p>
If it can manage the same throughput as oracle and others then it clearly scales adequately that the middleware becomes a weaker link (at least in the case of SQL Server and others).
</p><p>
Of course this didn't cover hairy transactions, or require clustering or high availability - but 90% of solutions don't require that. Even those that do can usually work fine with Master/Slave load balancing which is practical and proven with MySQL.
</p><p>
I should mention that I really like the 'feel' of mysql in many ways - the full text searching is rather good and it is easy to tweak and secure.

Well, they do say this:

<blockquote><div>Out of all the drivers we used, Microsoft's new JDBC driver had the most problems. It's still a beta driver in the form distributed on Microsoft's Web site, but it's not a new product per se, because it's based on code licensed from DataDirect Technologies Inc., which has had the leading third-party SQL Server JDBC driver for some years now.</div></blockquote>

<p>Fortunately there are other drivers on the market -- I've used ones from <a href="http://www.inetsoftware.de/" title="inetsoftware.de">i-net</a inetsoftware.de> with good results. The only time I tried to use the MS JDBC driver it barfed on some fairly common metadata commands. (Besides, I trust MS to produce a decent JDBC driver as much as I trust RMS to push proprietary software<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)</p>
