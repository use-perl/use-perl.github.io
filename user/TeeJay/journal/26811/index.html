<p>So many people in large public organisations and businesses manage to fuck up perfectly simple websites and applications.
<br><br>
<ul>
<li>Jobcentre Plus - Still broken in FireFox, requires IE, even with IE shows out of date or useless results - manages to be less convenient than walking to the jobcenter yourself.
<li>Cornwall County Council - Cannot apply for a job online unless you use IE and have vbscript enabled, most of the advertised jobs (which require you to navigate through at least 5 links) are internal only. Broken links for job descriptions add to the sense of futility.
<li>The PostOffice / Royal Mail - Broken in Firefox, after eventually using IE and getting to the bit where you apply are told to telephone the people who told you to use the website.
<li>Comet - Job application doesn't work online in IE or Firefox.
</ul><br/><br/>I just noticed how bad this was when my wife was jobhunting for my father in law and repeatedly asked for help where websites totally failed to work or display<br/><br/><br><br><br/><br/>Really - how hard can it be? This is for really really simple stuff - collecting applicant information online and linking it to a job - all the hard work is still done manually. *sigh*<br/><br/><br><br>

<h2>Marketing Types</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ajt/">ajt</a> on 2005-09-21T18:15:23</h3>
<p>Marketing types are easily impressed. They are often dim, and impressed by fancy demos and slick presentations. They have no idea about the technology, and are easily sold crap by any one who turns up with a bid to a tendered contract. The then force this poorly written rubbish on their own companies, and because they never see the customer complaints, think everything is fine and dandy. The good desingers out there gradually learn that they don't get work by doing good demos, instead they churn out the same flashy content free IE only rubbish that the other guys do, and eveyone loses out.</p>

<p>I don't even complain to the sites anymore...</p>

<p>Me bitter...? I've seen it, and I don't care anymore that our new site will break accessability guidelines, only work in IE6.785687587653432, and requires a zillion plugins and eats bandwidth like it's going out fashion....</p>
