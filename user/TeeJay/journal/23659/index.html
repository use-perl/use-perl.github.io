<div class="span8">
<p>I have been puzzled this morning about why I couldn't get wsdl.exe to work (via mono) with my https webservice.
<p>
I kept on getting : <br>
Error: There was an error processing 'https://baldwins.aaron.dev.fsite.com/SOAP/khaoscatalogue'.
<ul>
  - Error getting response stream (Write): SendFailure<br>
  - The authentication or decryption has failed.<br>
</ul>
..not very helpful.
<p>
After a lot of looking around I eventually managed to find <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/FAQ:_Security">this FAQ</a> which says to use certmgr to add certificates to the Trusted group. Unfortunately I can't seem to get this to work.
<p>
Looking at <a href="http://blog.peoplesdns.com/aggregator/feed/14">monologue</a>, I see that <i>"The certmgr tool has been updated to download certificates, including up-to the root certificate if desired.
certmgr.exe -ssl https://www.verisign.com

This can be done from any SSL session (as long as you supply the port number for non-Fx protocol), e.g.
certmgr -ssl ldaps://www.nldap.com:636
<p>
There are a few possible problems (like old root certificates using MD2 in their signature) so be sure to read the man page if it doesn't work."</i>, but of couse that requires dev (1.1.4) rather than stable (1.0.6) and there are of course no rpm's for dev - maybe I can grab a nightly binary...
</p>

<h2>1.1.4 redhat rpms badly broken</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/TeeJay/">TeeJay</a> on 2005-03-15T12:16:49</h3>
It looks like that was a waste of 45 minutes - after installing the redhat 9 mono 1.1.4 rpm's I can only get "illegal instruction".
<p>
Mono seems a lot further from being ready for production use than I expected. That is very disappointing.
</p><p>
I guess I'll have to resort to using bloody<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.Net on windows until mono suck less. And all I want to do is write a simple webservice client to an HTTPS service.
</p><p>



<h2>some progress at last</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/TeeJay/">TeeJay</a> on 2005-03-15T14:39:01</h3>
Once I made the service available over http I managed to get some WSDL errors from mono's wsdl tool - not enough to be helpful though (Microsofts wsdl.exe is even worse).
<p>
Fortunately I managed to find <a href="http://www.mindreef.net/tide/scopeit/start.do" title="mindreef.net">mindreef soapscope</a mindreef.net> web service checker and <a href="http://soapclient.com/" title="soapclient.com">soapclient</a soapclient.com> web service client.
</p><p>
I haven't managed to get any luck with the mono/.net tools yet, but these are very helpful as is this <a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/03/14-annotated-WSDL-examples" title="w3.org">Annotated wsdl examples</a w3.org> page at w3.org.

Hmm...
<p>
mono wsdl barfs on the examples from w3.org, wtf is that supposed to mean - either the examples are broken or wsdl sucks.
</p><p>
I had to crib from the GoogleSearch wsdl which mono seems to love, even after changing everything to look like GoogleSearch, it still fails to generate anything useful.
</p><p>
hateful thing
