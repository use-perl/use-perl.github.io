<p>I have had an ethical problem with the diamond trade for a long time so I was interested in the discussion over at <a href="http://ask.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=02/08/13/2010256&mode=nocomment&tid=99">slashdot</a> on buying diamond rings for engagement.
<p>
I bought my now wife an enagagement ring from a regional specialist, and got our wedding wings from specialists locally and in london.
<p>
I was reluctant to buy a diamond ring knowing that the price of diamonds is over-inflated by the deBeers monopoly and skewed market as well as media pressure.
<p>
The ring we eventually settled on had two small diamonds (by engagement ring standards - still big enough to cost money) and a large amethyst in a nice gold setting.
<p>
Its hard to find a comprimise but we meet on the middle on issues like this , chocolate, fish, meat, charity, politics.
<p>
Although we are both politically aware we are passionate about different things and I would consider worldwide problems such as poverty, human rights, etc as more important than the national and local issues that concern her more.
<p>
Fortunately we are able to agree and make an effort towards both local and international things.</p>

I get the sinking feeling that your ethics overwhelmed her wants for a diamond.  Regardless of the ethics involved, if she wants a diamond (for whatever reason), she should get a diamond.  That said, you guys celebrated your (Nth?) wedding anniversary recently, so things must be good in the TeeJay household.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
<p>
This <a href="http://ask.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=37935&amp;cid=4067912" title="slashdot.org">post</a slashdot.org> represents my thoughts pretty well on the topic.
</p><p>
I got suckered into the diamond mentality (with the America/DeBeers propaganda) myself and didn't ask my wife what she really wanted.  But going with the default diamond option turned out to be good.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

no...<br> <br>Sam chose the ring, If I didn't like it I would have said so - after all it was a huge chunk of my wages.<br> <br>As I said we both have to compromise I buy chocolate from brandnames despite having doubts about their involvement with slavery and third-world poverty and she makes an effort to get fair-trade tea and coffee.<br> <br>I would really like to get antique eternity ring or some used/old diamonds mounted in a custom eternity ring. That way we get more for our money and avoid being suckered into subsidising deBeers and Civil Wars in africa.

My wife thinks that engagement rings are tools for men to mark their territory so she didn't want one. Our wedding rings are simple, flat and wide bands without any decoration. (The only problem is that they pick up scratches like the dickens.)
