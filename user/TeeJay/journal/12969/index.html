<p>wouldn't it be cool if you could get relatively up to date free software on CDROM from your local library.
<p>
I want to try and make free software and documentation available at your local library.
<p>
My plan is to organise a website and mailing list of people with CD Burners and fast connections, people with contacts to library people and people with the time and skills to bundle up software into packages suitable for Joe Learner.. in that order
<p>
Hopefully we can organise a press thing with an MP, a bunch of pilot libraries and point people (i.e. LUGs, schools, and librarians) at our website.
<p>
Any assistance (websites, mailing lists, offers to burn CDs and helpful MP's) would be much appreciated

<h2>Good idea</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ajt/">ajt</a> on 2003-06-20T17:21:32</h3>
<p>I think it's a good idea in principle, BUT there are problems.</p>

<p>Many libraries I've seen have been <em>got at</em>, and are full of expensive Dell/HP/IBM PCs running expensive proprietary operating systems like Windows XP. If you come along trying to distribute "free" open source software, you may find the shadow of FUD being cast over the poor old library, by the BSA/Microsoft: what if it's not free software? what if it's pirated? what if it's kiddie porn? how could a self respecting Windows using library protect it's self from naughty open source people?</p>

<p>I don't think you'll get HM Govt involved, they sold out to MS years ago, but you may be able to get a pilot running somewhere, perhaps a University library, and try and get someone like IBM/RedHat/SuSE involved so you can say it's all kosher.</p>

There is actually a pretty strong community of open source developers in the library community. Check out <a href="http://www.oss4lib.org/" title="oss4lib.org">oss4lib</a oss4lib.org> for details. Believe it or not, there is also <a href="http://www.rice.edu/perl4lib" title="rice.edu">perl4lib</a rice.edu>, which is a listserv for perl in libraries that has been around for a few years. Both would be good discussion forums for your idea.

I would think there would be natural affinity between libraries and Open Source.<br> <p>I've read somewhere that publishers tried to license books in the late 19th and early part of the 20th Century to fight the growing 'threat' of the many libraries that were springing up.  These licenses allowed you to read the book, but not to lend it out.  This was struck down in the Supreme Court and the concept of First Sale was established that basically gave you the rights to do whatever you wanted with copyrighted material that you purchased, save copy it (copyright - Copy Right - get it publishers?)  The concept of First Sale has been used recently in court cases where Software Vendors are claiming you don't have the right to resell their media.<br> </p><p>Does anyone know of anything really good on the history of Copyrights and Patents?  (I never use the term Intellectual Property, <a href="http://www.fsf.org/philosophy/words-to-avoid.html#IntellectualProperty" title="fsf.org">agreeing with RMS on this</a fsf.org> ).  Something for the layman, rather than the lawyer, that would give detail surrounding the history I sketch above?  I find it a fascinating subject.</p>
