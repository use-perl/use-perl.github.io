<div class="span8">
<p>I'm dealing with a relatively recent codebase where the programmer has decided to use Object::InsideOut - and I'm really getting annoyed with it.<br/><br/>It doesn't offer any actual benefits over using a sane class system, such as Class::Accessor, doesn't provide any persistence (so that's all tacked on seperately via a heath-robinson contraption involving large SQL snippets all over the shop). I'd really like to replace all the Object::InsideOut code with DBIx::Class.<br/><br/>*sigh*<br/><br/>Today's fun problem is that I've added a new attribute, but the getter methods don't seem to exist, despite being specified in exactly the same way as all the others, naturally no useful information is provided about why it doesn't exist - merely that (despite all the code being in place) it doesn't.</p>

It may be tricky to add that attribute, but once you do it will be, like, totally encapsulated...

&nbsp; &nbsp; $object-&gt;{__PACKAGE__}{attr} = $value;<br><br>Now the object's guts are well divided into areas of authority.

What the hell is that supposed to mean?  I said that you should avoid tight coupling and screwing around in the guts of objects you don't destroy, but that the solution of inside-out objects can be a greater cost than is needed if you can effect a cultural solution.<br><br>How is that an endorsement of anything even remotely like monkeypatching?

<h2>Re:cultural solutions</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/rjbs/">rjbs</a> on 2007-11-27T15:21:05</h3>
In Perl, it would be this:<p><blockquote> <div><tt>use File::Spec;<br>use Other::Modules::Also;<br>
&nbsp; <br>sub File::Spec::catdir {<br>&nbsp; shift;<br>&nbsp; return join('//', @_);<br>}<br>
&nbsp; <br>do_stuff;<br>...<br>my $path = File::Spec-&gt;catdir(@parts);<br>...<br>do_things;</tt></div> </blockquote> In other words: change the behavior of shared code by messing about with its guts, rather than by producing a subclass that you use.  It's fast and easy (so a monkey can do it), acts like you've patched the source, and affects all the other code you've loaded and probably not reviewed for how it will be affected by your change.  Oops!

I think calling it 'monkeypatching' might be doing it an injustice. It's not pretty, but it's also something that (IMO) is useful when you know what you're doing, kind of like mucking with symbol tables. But it sounded from Aristotle's comment that this is SOP for Ruby folks, which I agree is scary.

<p>I agree it can be useful in limited and highly constrained circumstances. It has its place, much like GOTO, which I am fond of defending against dogmatists despite the fact that I practically never use it.</p>

<p>The most common form among Ruby folk is adding methods to classes you don&#8217;t own. That does indeed seem to be SOP. Eg. Rake (the build system written in Ruby) stuffs a kitchen sink of filesystem-related methods into <code>Object</code>. Changing existing behaviour is less common, but they do that too; cf. the Chainsaw Infanticide Logger Manoeuvre. The Rails crowd is particularly given to using this&#8230; technique.</p>

<p>You made an unqualified claim that inside-out objects have some unspecified overhead cost and then said the absence of their benefits is only a problem if you make it one. That&#8217;s the same sort of argument by which monkeypatching gets justified &#8211; &#8220;it&#8217;s only a problem in practice if you make it one, and doing it this way is easier.&#8221; I cringe in embarrassment whenever Perl hackers trot out the living-room-and-shotgun line in the presence of others (and when it&#8217;s just Perl folk I roll my eyes).</p>

<p>What are those rumoured costs anyway? The only ones I&#8217;m aware of are second-order effects of <code>DESTROY</code> being broken and threads being terrible in Perl. Thankfully, 5.10 hacks around both of these. (Well, personally I don&#8217;t care about threads, so that one doesn&#8217;t affect me in any case.) Is there any counterargument if 5.10 is presumed?</p>

I will be very plainspoken and see if that helps me communicate any better:  It is always a bad practice to alter an objects behavior without limiting the scope of those modifications.  It is also always a bad practice to alter the data associated with an object without controlling the way that the object 's methods and its data interact.  Unfortunately, it is difficult to do this in Perl.  One solution is inside-out objects, which prevent the user from altering an object's data easily.  However, inside-out objects have costs.  These costs are added complexity due to garbage collection, threading problems, and difficulty when serializing.  These problems may be mitigated by using an inside-out object framework, but then the framework itself is a cost.  One of these frameworks is very simple fieldhash system in perl 5.10.  Unfortunately, it requires perl 5.10, which has not yet been released as a stable product, and which will take time before it is deployed into vendor perls.<br><br>So, if it is possible to create a *cultural* solution by having coding rules that ban unjustified alteration of foreign objects, this may be preferable to inside-out objects.  The shotgun analogy is correct, here.  Perl does not come equipped with a shotgun (encapsulation), so manners may have to do.  Trying to bolt the shotgun on can prove more dangerous (to maintainability) than simply behaving well.<br><br>The shotgun metaphor need not be a reason to never *add* a native shotgun.  I like field hashes, and I think they are a good step toward correcting the errors in language design that have made encapsulation in Perl objects problematic.  I am certainly more likely to use fieldhashes for encapsulated data than I am to use Class::InsideOut or Object::InsideOut.<br><br>Abigail's point about compile time errors versus runtime errors was an excellent one, and I don't mean to address it at all, above.

Agreed totally - it's trivial to avoid the problems that Object::Std and O::IO try to solve without all the extra nonsense, what's more you can still use a sensible class framework.<br><br>Not once in the decade I've been writing Perl have I needed O::IO or it's ilk.

<h3><a href="/user/Abigail/">Abigail</a> on 2007-11-27T12:50:45</h3>
That solves only one of the two problems Inside-Out Objects try to solve.
<p>
The other is turning (possibly hard to find) runtime errors into compile time errors.
</p><p>
Preferring <tt>$hash -&gt; {attr}</tt> (or <tt>$hash -&gt; {__PACKAGE__} {attr}</tt>) over <tt>$attr {refaddr $ref}</tt> is, IMO, as sane as preferring package variable and 'no strict' over lexical variables and 'use strict'.
</p><p>
Inside-Out Objects has never been about providing encapsulation with a shotgun. It simply favours perl5-style variables ('strict', 'lexical') over perl4-style variables ('no strict', 'package'). An attribute, after all, is simply a variable.</p>

Yes, that's a very good point, and what I suggested doesn't address it at all.  I wonder whether a bit of sugar around restricted hashes could provide something 80% as useful without many of the drawbacks of inside-out objects... but I haven't given it much thought, let alone experimentation.

I'm disheartened to hear that you're having trouble with
another programmer's code, and laying the blame solely on
OIO.  If you need help, OIO's POD references both the
module's
<a href="http://www.cpanforum.com/dist/Object-InsideOu" title="cpanforum.com">
discussion forum</a cpanforum.com> and the author's email:
jdhedden AT cpan DOT
org.
<p>
While OIO's POD does discuss some of the advantages of using
the inside-out object model, it also lists several more
involved discussions on the matter including Damian Conway's
book <b>Perl Best Practices</b>.
</p><p>
OIO does provide methods for maintaining persistent data,
but not directly to a database.  However, I don't see why
this would be difficult as it would only require two simple
methods in the parent class: one to dump the object and
store it in the DB, and the other to retrieve and
reconstitute the object.  Your comment of <i>large SQL
snippets all over the shop</i> sounds more like
implementation issues rather than a deficiency with OIO.
</p><p>
With regard to the problem you're having with adding a new
attribute, if you email me directly with the details (and
perhaps an example), I'll do my best to help.  Thanks.</p>

<p>Errm, DBIx::Class is an object-relational mapper, not a class framework. Criticising Object::InsideOut for not being an ORM is like criticizing perl for not being an editor. What are you even talking about?</p>

DBIx::Class is also a class framework, same as Class::DBI and Class::Accessor - all of which are much easier to use and maintain than O::IO.



<blockquote>

<h3><a href="/user/Aristotle/">Aristotle</a> on 2007-11-28T10:03:00</h3>
<p>No, CDBI and DBIC are not the same kind of thing as Class::Accessor. You don&#8217;t write programs with CDBI/DBIC if they have nothing to do with a database, and you don&#8217;t stick non-database-related logic in your CDBI/DBIC classes either.</p>

"requiring a user to provide regexen to match method/attributes"
<p>
It's not a requirement - it's optional.  Cut out the
regexes, and your preformance will go up (probably
significantly).  The regex option is there to provide
greater programming flexibility if that is desired.  As with
any feature, if it's not needed, then don't use it.
</p><p>
"There is a great deal more to useful object persistence
than a couple of SQL statements..."
</p><p>
The requirement to tie your objects to a database was
evidently something the original coder failed to properly
take into account.  As OIO does not support this sort of
thing, then obviously it was not the right tool for the job.
It's senseless to condemn the screwdriver for not being a
very good hammer.
</p><p>
"O::IO and it's ilk are interesting illustrations of some
concepts but have no place in production code."
</p><p>
In your humble opinion, of course.  OIO is being used quite
a bit in production code (based on the correspondences I
have had with users).  So it's down do agreeing to disagree.
</p><p>
'Nuff said.  Good luck with your rewrite.  Sorry I couldn't
be of any help.</p>
