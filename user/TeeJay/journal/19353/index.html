<div class="span8">
<p>It rocks.
<p>
I have yet to find out how extensible it is as I am busy prototyping my father-in-law's website. Maypole allows me to knock together a nice UI to manage the objects and quickly change the application schema via my mysql login and emacs to update the handful of LoC required to power it.
<p>
So far my only immediate questions are :
<ul>
<li>why no default css file included to go with the templates in the custom directory?
<li>why no frontpage template in the factory directory - something like the apache default start page would be cool.
<li> how do I change the order fields appear on the form?
<li> How do I change dropdowns to use a field other than name or id?
</ul>
<p>
I am sure the later two are answered somewhere in the documentation, just thought I would mention that they are the first questions I would ask once I had a basic site up (which I now have).
<p>
I also got a mail from 'zengargoyle' about maypole - he would have replied to my post but lost his password and mailed me instead :
<br>
<i>
it looks like Maypole is still at 1.4 which i've been playing with
for a month or so.
                                                                                                                             <p>
the URL handling is a bit screwy, the examples have you give the
base_url as http://somwhere/with/trailing/slash/ and it won't
work without the last /  but the templates aren't consistent
and you'll end up with links that have '//' in them which is
ugly.
                                                                                                                             <p>
whichever you choose CGI::Maypole or Apache::MVC for your driver,
the parse_location function handles munging the URL.  i think the
regex might be a bit off and changed it to:                                                                                                                          <p>
<pre>
     $self->{path} =~ s/^($loc\/*)?//;
                                                                                                                             </pre>
<p>
and fixed up the templates to always put their own slashes.
                                                                                                                             <p><pre>
  [% base %] / [% table %] / [% action %]
</pre><p>
in the Class::DBI::AsForm module there's some sort of bug that
causes TEXT objects (in mysql database) to not have their current
values set as default.  if you edit a row with a TEXT object, the
textarea comes up empty while varchar/int/etc have their current
values.
<p>
i changed this in the to_field function which cleared up the
problem and doesn't seem to break anything else...
                                                                                                                             <p>
                                                                                                                             <pre>
    #my $class = ref $self || $self;
    my $class = $self;
                                                                                                                             </pre>

print "$Maypole::CLI::buffer\n@r\n";
                                                                                                                             </pre>

other than that, Maypole has worked out rather nicely.
i'm about a month away from having my app all finished up and hope
to contribute some patches then.
                                                                                                                             <p>
oh, i have a working FCGI::Maypole for mod_fastcgi if you dislike
mod_perl and mod_cgi isn't fast enough.
<p>
oh, and you'll have to hack a bit if you want to send cookies from
the CGI implementations.  the Apache::MVC uses Apache::Request which
has a place to set cookies to be sent back to the user.  the CGI::Simple
based CGI::Maypole doesn't (nor a way to send a redirect).
                                                                                                                             <p>
i just added an extra request variables and overrode the send_output
funtion.
                                                                                                                             <p>
<pre>

        my $r = shift;

this is a function of Class::DBI proper.  DBI::Loader makes some guesses (like 'name' is used for stringification if it's there). The pulldown automagic is from the Relations that have been created.                                                                                                                             </p><p><blockquote><div> <tt>App-&gt;config-&gt;{loader}-&gt;relationship(<br>&nbsp; 'beer has breweries'<br>);<br> <br>create table beer (<br> id integer<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...,<br> name varchar<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...,<br> brewery integer<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...,<br><nobr> <wbr></nobr>...<br>)<br> <br>create table brewery (<br> id integer<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...,<br> name varchar<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...,<br><nobr> <wbr></nobr>...<br>)<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  </tt> </div></blockquote> <p>
the has_a/has_many relationships that Class::DBI::Loader creates controll the pulldown creation.
