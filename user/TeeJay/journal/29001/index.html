<div class="span8">
<p>I've pretty much completed the scheduler I have been developing - I just need to polish the web gui and integrate log4perl properly.<br/><br/>Anyway - one of the things it does is run commands either as perl via do() or via system().<br/><br/>It captures stderr/stdout through copying the current filehandles for each, and reopening them to files, reopening the copied filehandles again after running a command. That bit is fairly simple, but allows me to slurp in the stderr output after running the command or if the whole process running the command dies unexpectedly. In a scheduler with dozens of jobs to run, many of them in development this is incredibly useful:<br/><br/>###<br/><br/>    open(OLD_STDERR,">&STDERR") or warn "Failed to save STDERR";
    open(STDERR,">$stderr_filename") or warn "Failed to redirect STDERR";
    open(OLD_STDOUT,">&STDOUT") or warn "Failed to save STDOUT";
    open(STDOUT,">$stdout_filename") or warn "Failed to redirect STDOUT";<br/><br/>    print "$$\n"; # don't want an empty file
    warn "$$\n"; # don't want an empty file<br/><br/>   # do stuff ...<br/><br/>    open(STDOUT,">&OLD_STDOUT") or warn "Failed to restore STDOUT";
    open(STDERR,">&OLD_STDERR") or warn "Failed to restore STDERR";<br/><br/>
###<br/><br/>The tricky bit this morning was handling scripts that 'exit' when executed within do. I want to capture that exit and continue, but any other exits should happen normally. <br/><br/>The only solution that actually worked was to copy  a glob of CORE::GLOBAL::exit to somewhere, set the glob to sub that warns/logs the exit, with time and pid, before continuing, and then copy the original exit glob back :<br/><br/>###
    eval {
	*real_exit = *CORE::GLOBAL::exit;
	*CORE::GLOBAL::exit = sub { warn localtime() ." pid : $$ attempted to exit! caller : ", join(', ',caller()),"\n"; };
	$ok = do "$filename";
	$error = "couldn't parse $filename: $@" if $@;
	$error = "couldn't do $filename: $!"    unless defined $ok;
	$error = "couldn't run $filename"       unless $ok;
	*CORE::GLOBAL::exit = *real_exit;
    };
###<br/><br/>Getting it working was helped immensely by Nik and Davorg on #london.pm following Nik's talk at the last tech meet where he demonstrated how to over-ride stuff in a script that is being run.</p>

First of all, thanks for sharing -- that's useful stuff.  But have you considered local() instead of copying something and then copying it back at the end?<blockquote> <div><tt>eval {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; local *CORE::GLOBAL::exit = sub {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; warn localtime()<nobr> <wbr></nobr>." pid : $$ attempted to exit! caller : ", join(', ',caller()),"\n";<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; };<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; $ok = do "$filename";<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; $error = "couldn't parse $filename: $@" if $@;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; $error = "couldn't do $filename: $!"&nbsp; &nbsp; unless defined $ok;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; $error = "couldn't run $filename"&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;unless $ok;<br>};</tt></div> </blockquote> <p>-Dom</p>

yes I tried it - despite having being in an anon block inside an eval it didn't descope for some reason - possibly I fluffed it, but exits ended up getting caught in unexpected places elsewhere in the program.

Dom's code won't work because core subroutines can only be overridden at compile-time. Also you don't need to store a copy of <tt>*CORE::GLOBAL::exit</tt> as it can always be found in <tt>CORE::exit</tt> (although you can't take a reference to it so just use a wee closure e.g <code>*CORE::GLOBAL::exit = sub { CORE::exit $_[0] };</code>).

I'm an idiot. Dom's code should work since the code in the the context of the <tt>do</tt> will be evaluated at compile-time.

Oooh, crap, I didn't know that.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-(  Thanks for pointing it out.

What you are doing sounds quite a bit like what IPC::Run3 does.<br><br>Is it missing something, or does it do something in a way that doesn't work for you? Have you heard of it?<br>

It kind of evolved, I'd be tempted to replace it with IPC::Run but only if it others exactly the same stuff without adding complexity.<br><br>Although, to be honest - it's working very nicely now
