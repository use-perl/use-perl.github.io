<p>I've offered to update and release maypole, and put together a roadmap for maypole. Several people on list have said they want me to do the job and people have been asking me (and others) to sort it out for weeks.
<p>
I hope to put together a new roadmap in the next month, and update SVN with a mind to releasing a development / alpha 2.10 release in the next couple of weeks
<p>
Once that has been tested, we'll look at releasing 2.10 and finalising a road map for Maypole 2.x until autumn.
<p>
Now I just need to get co-maint access to cpan and svn access...
<p>
<b>[updated]</b>
<p>
Sri has kindly sorted CPAN permissions for me - now just waiting for svn access, and we can get to work. Lathos didn't object when I spoke to him about it so we should have a bunch of nice people to ask tricky questions later.
<p>
We are also discussing the new roadmap, patches, etc on the list. So maypole is alive and well and back to work.
<p></p>

<p>I don't know if I am much help, or if I have enough time to be of service, but we're using maypole at work, and it's very good, and in our interest to keep it going...</p>

any feedback is good - join the list and contribute to the roadmap thread.
