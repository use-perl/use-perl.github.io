<div class="span8">
<p>the *huge* 2 year project we have been working on at $employer went live this morning served from a mix of Linux and IIS boxes and we are slowly moving the remaining IIS/ASP pages to Linux as people tell me what the asp pages actually do.
<p>
Looks like my cow-orkers learnt perl and linux and apache the hard way last night as I decided to call it a day after 12 hours on saturday and 2 more on sunday. When I came in last night it was obvious they had pulled an all nighter and learnt enough perl and stuff to make some very simple changes. Oddly, despite being sleep deprived I think they might catch the bug.
<p>
So today we are all shattered but still have dozens of niggling little issues to chase down until the entire frontend is served from Linux and MySQL without having to hit the very slow and overloaded windows boxes.
<p>
Before you ask why I didn't pull an all-nighter I'll point out a couple of things <ul>
<li> am I a) senior or b) director ? : nope
<li> do they pay me enough to sacrifice my marriage for they sake of a badly managed project ? : nope, in fact all the overtime I put in this week just about covers the usual shortfall between how much they pay me and how much it costs to live here.
<li> did I make an effort to try to get the project back on course by questioning what we could actually deliver, and they did they listlen, and was I right about how we wasted 3 days on stuff that isn't needed ? : yes, no, and yes.
<li> did my employers let 70% of the development team leave because they were underpaid and taken for granted, without replacing them ? : yes
</ul>
