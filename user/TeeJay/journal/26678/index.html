I got back from greece very early saturday morning after a pretty awful journey back to bristol airport from skiathos. Luckily we spent the last few days on the island after spending the rest of the holiday on skopelos.
</p>
<p>
We managed to try squid, octopus and a variety of other local seafood - Swordfish souvlaki can't be beaten although Monkfish saganaki is to die for.
</p>
<p>
Managed to spot 8 monestaries, dozens of pretty churches, several old men on donkeys as well as various donkeys carrying stuff (including olive branches, which looked very quaint), 3 lizards, 1 monk, 6 nuns, 4 priests and dozens of other postcard moments. Also tried about a dozen different cheese pies. Skopelos Cheese pie is a local dish that is feta in a coil of filo pastry and then deep fried, variations include more traditional tart styles as well as with different meats and vegetables, both baked and fried.
</p>
<p>Also tried out a bunch of tavernas on both islands and got a lot of snorkelling and swimming done</p>
<p>
Finally - managed to relax in the sun and forget about work, open source projects and everyday problems.
</p>
<p>
Anyway - now I am back - we have a Maypole release to work on, I desperately need to catch up on Autodia which has dozens of patches and bug reports to work on, also there are several Maypole Applications in various stages of development and finally I need to work on a couple of freelance bits and pieces for friends and family.
