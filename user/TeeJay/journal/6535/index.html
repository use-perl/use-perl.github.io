<p>..which is probably why you can't actually program in it.
<p>
following last weeks trouble with queries that fetch records with BLOB columns, in short..
<ul>
<li>don't bother using getrows on recordsets with more than one BLOB
<li>always specify the fields you want to fetch
<li>always access the fields in that order
</ul>
This morning I was surprised to discover that getRows() empties the current record of the recordset so you can't get any values out once you've called it.
<br>
Then I discovered that you can't put method calls into an array so 'aryRs = array(rs("foo"),rs("bar")) won't work and gives an error at line 0 (ASP error messages as unhelpful as ever, this also occurs if you miss a comma in an array).
<br>
so now I am forced to declare a variable for each column, populate each variable one by one from the recordset in the order of the select statement and then populate the array with the variables.
<p>
what a PITA.
<p>
Also this morning I came accross an annoyance when using ProxyPass in Apache - the header fields are emptied so I can't parse the path of where my mod_perl scripts are called from and have to use a variable instead. Easy to get around but being able to view the headers would be much more elegent.
