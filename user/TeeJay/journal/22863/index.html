<b>WHAT??</b>
<p>
I just spent 10 minutes going through the rigamarole of searching and booking the flight and then just after taking my credit card details its decided that my session timed out in the 3 minutes it took my to fill in the last form and dig my credit card out of my wallet and double check I filled it in correctly.
</p>
<p>
whoever is in charge of their website needs their arse kicked. It is seriously under-powered and has a habit of falling on its arse at any excuse and basically refusing to sell me a fucking flight.
<br>
I emailed the register but nobody there seems to care.

<h2>Hahaha, they have no bugs</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/sky/">sky</a> on 2005-01-24T22:39:48</h3>
So, I booked for me and my wife two years ago, however in the email confirmation her name came out as 'UNDEFINED UNDEFINED'.
<p>
So after a call to Ryanair, I was told that I had entered UNDEFINED to be able to illegally change names later, and that their programs have no bugs! Never had any bugs and that they couldn't have any bugs. I was also told it was a program not software. I called back two days later to tell them to fuck off, however I had a redirect on file, they gave me a free dial number, I called them up and they said sorry, what is your wifes name, we will change it.</p><p>I believe someone must have overheard and escalated it.</p><p>What made it even more stupid is the fact that her name was on the credit card. I believe the javascript that copied the name from the credit card failed somehow. Since then we don't fly Ryanair. BA isn't so much more expensive and so much nicer!</p>



<h2>Avoid &quot;budget&quot; airlines</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/drhyde/">drhyde</a> on 2005-01-25T10:21:50</h3>
Perhaps now you understand why I avoid all those horrible "budget" airlines like the plague they are.  Flying from ridiculous places like Essex (and daring to call it London) is bad enough, but they seem to pride themselves on having no customer service.  These days I always fly with a proper airline.  They work better, they fly to and from places that matter, and are not significantly more expensive.

<h2>not much choice from newquay</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/TeeJay/">TeeJay</a> on 2005-01-25T15:27:57</h3>
There isn't much choice between budget and unaffordable at newquay - southwest airlines have taken over the old BA route to gatwick and so have a much more convenient service, can't have any worse customer service than ryanair and I would be happy to book a flight with them if only they had prices anything like ryanair.. currently I could hire a car and a driver and it would still be cheaper than flying to gatwick at a convenient time.
