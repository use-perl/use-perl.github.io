<p>I just put a new version of Autodia (now at version 2.01) on the <a href="http://www.droogs.org/autodia/">website</a> and uploaded it to CPAN.
<p>
Its a bit of a minor release but useful if the bugs fixed affected your ability to use it :)
<p>
I have also been busy working on requisite relationships for my Class::PINT project - Class::DBI now has several new relationships after I got the ball rolling with IsA (Richard Hundt gave me the skeleton class and I documented and maintained and patched it with amendments from the CDBI list as well as my own code), then HasManyOrdered which provides a powerful ordered one-to-many or many-to-many with transparent side-tables rather than the hacks required with the vanilla CDBI has-many. Somebody else has also released a nice CDBI relationship for handling arbitary per-object attributes.. nice.
<p>
For my (officially over in a week) day job I have been working on porting a scary Tangram/PSA/Fascgi/jsrpc monster into a simpler friendlier (and working) version based on Class::DBI, Class::PINT, and mod_perl. One of the side-effects is that I now have 90% of a nice CDBI database and class generator, I plan to integrate it with my autodia classes so that I can generate a CDBI application from Umbrello or Dia or Druid schema, or even port from a non-persistant class.
<p>
I am now officially looking for work.. teleworking would be nice but I'm happy to work anywhere that would allow me to be home (cornwall) late friday night until late sunday night/early monday morning ... oh and it needs to pay my bills. I have over 5 years commercial perl experience, a decent degree and love perl..
