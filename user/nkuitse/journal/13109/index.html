<p>My current project is a database for work.  To save myself future headaches, I've been sticking to the <i>code it once</i> principle.  Specifically, I've been coding table and class information in YAML, then defining templates (using the Template Toolkit, of course) to produce SQL code, Perl modules, and (ta da!) a Makefile.<br/><br/>With lots of Perl glue.<br/><br/>And now I've got the biggest headache of them all.<br/><br/>Moral: trying to save myself headaches later is pointless if <b>my brain explodes in the process!</b><br/><br/><b>Update:</b> Happily, the headache is quickly fading.  I added a target in my makefile spec to produce a (longish) SQL command file that populates the database in one transaction, and the resulting file is looking good. It's not running to completion, because my data has a few hiccups in it that my data preparation scripts didn't catch, but that's easy enough to fix.<br/><br/>Moral #2: When trying to save yourself headaches later, don't try to save them all at once.  One aspirin at a time, my friend!</p>

<i>It actually sounds pretty cool.</i> <br> <br>Thanks for the encouraging words.  My brain is much better now.  Lying in the grass with my eyes closed helped a lot.<nobr> <wbr></nobr><code>:-)</code> <br> <br>I wouldn't say it's a mess, just <b>big</b> and I tend to work on several parts of it at once.  When I'm in the groove this can work very well (until my brain conks out); at other times, it results in a certain amount of wheel-spinning...

<h2>CREATE TABLE abstraction?</h2>

<p>Does this allow you to describe a table structure and dump out SQL statements to create it in various databases?  That'd surely be useful!</p>

<i>Does this allow you to describe a table structure and dump out SQL statements to create it in various databases?</i> <br> <br>Maybe. I'm only targeting PosgretSQL at the moment, but it should be easy to target other RDBMSes too, as this would mostly* entail making a few new SQL templates.<br> <br>* There are bound to be some PostgreSQLisms outside of the templates; hopefully, not many.<br> <br>Here's a much-abridged example of a table definition:<br> <br> <b>tables/Orders/definition.yml</b> <blockquote><div> <tt>--- #YAML:1.0<br>name: Orders<br>singular: Order<br>description: Book orders placed for the library<br>type: data<br>null: '--undef--'<br>sequences:<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;- name: &amp;1 order_id_seq<br>columns:<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;- name: id<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;type: int<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;description: The unique ID for this order<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;pkey: 1<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;unique: 1<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;nullable: 0<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;sequence: *1<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;- name: book_id<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;type: int<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;description: The book we're ordering<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;nullable: 0<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;foreign_key:<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; table: Books<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; column: id<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; reverse:<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;name: orders<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;multiple: 1<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; on_delete: CASCADE<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; on_update: CASCADE<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;- name: type_id<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;type: int<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;description: The type of order (one-shot, blanket, etc.)<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;nullable: 0<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;foreign_key:<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; table: OrderTypes<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; column: id<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; on_delete: CASCADE<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; on_update: CASCADE<br>indexes:<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;- name: order_book_idx<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;over: book_id<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;unique: 1<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;- name: order_type_idx<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;over: type_id<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;unique: 0</tt> </div></blockquote>The <b>singular</b> element is used to form the name of the class whose instances represent rows from the table.  The <b>reverse</b> stuff will result in a method Snoof::Object::Book::orders that returns a list of orders whose book_ids match the id of the book in question.  (Snoof is the name of the project.)<br> <br>The Makefile is created from the table definitions and a makefile spec, which I won't list here.  It was a pain to set up but much easier than writing and maintaining a (very long and repetitive) Makefile manually would have been!<br> <br>All SQL code is created from the table definitions using a template for each statement (CREATE TABLE, SELECT, UPDATE, etc.; I haven't written them all yet).  Here's an abridged example (partly outdated because I broke out the column constraints into individual elements):<br> <br> <b>tt2/create.sql.tt2</b> <blockquote><div> <tt>[% FOREACH seq = table.sequences -%]<br>CREATE SEQUENCE [% seq.name %];<br>[% END -%]<br>
&nbsp; <br>CREATE TABLE [% table.name %] (<br>[% FOREACH col = table.columns %]<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/*<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;[% col.description %]<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; */<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; [% col.name %]<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; [% col.type %][% IF col.constraints %] [% col.constraints.join(' ') %][% END -%]<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; [%- UNLESS loop.last %],[% END %]<br>[% END %]<br>);<br>
&nbsp; <br>[% FOREACH index = table.indexes -%]<br>CREATE [% GET 'UNIQUE ' IF index.unique %]INDEX [% index.name %]<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; ON [% table.name %] ( [% index.over.join(', ') %] );<br>
&nbsp; <br>[% END -%]</tt> </div></blockquote>The Perl modules implementing the business objects (Books, Orders, etc.) are also generated from templates.<br> <br>Later, I may generate HTML docs from the table definitions and (you guessed it!) some more templates.  That way 6 months from now when I've totally forgotten the design, I won't have to plow through source code and make my head explode again.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br> <br>For good measure, the data files (created from an earlier project) are kept in YAML and used to create tab-delimited files suitable for importing via SQL COPY.  No templates involved (whew!), just some simple Perl code (plus the table definitions).

You could probably try and use some of the code from tedia2sql - it generates loads of code for oracle, postgres, etc - most of the big databases.
<p>
And you can create it all from dia which is nice - should be easy to create your other stuff from dia too.
</p><p>
I am currently working on a new project to combine schema and code creation so that you can create your databases, your queries (all kept in a nice phrasebook natch), and documentation from a couple of perl scripts.

Thanks for the tip.  I've gotten over the hump now, I think, so I probably won't use tedia2sql, but it's always good to know about the alternatives...
