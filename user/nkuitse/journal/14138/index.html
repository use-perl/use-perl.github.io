<p>Ann Arbor lost power at about 16:12 EDT yesterday, along with everybody else.  (Well, not <i>everyone</i> of course...)  50 million people lost power in the U.S. and Canada, apparently.<br/><br/>I popped in at work this morning to see what was what and was amazed to see we've got power again.  (I'm currently being treated very nicely by a Lasko "Wind Machine" fan, sitting about 2 feet away.)<br/><br/>The University has its own power-generating capabilities (duh!) and the medical library (my workplace) is currently hooked up to the hospital's power. To conserve energy all non-essential staff are supposed to stay home, and I'm afraid I fall in that category (flash to that Twilight Zone episode where Burgess Meredith is obsolete) so I'll have to leave the fan behind and mosey on home and sweat it out.  The air outside is thick and torpid, and when I awoke this morning I felt as though I had lain in a pool of sweat all night.  On the bright side, the toilet there is flushing OK.  At least for now.<br/><br/>Well, I've put the computers to bed and they should be all right when I come back on Monday.  Hopefully we'll get power back soon.  More importantly, I hope everybody else out there is OK.<br/><br/>Signing off for now...</p>
