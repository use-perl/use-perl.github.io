<div class="span8">
<p><p>When I think about telling people about PAR internals, a reply from
a colleague readily comes to mind, when he was asked about an icky detail
of his analysis:</p>

<blockquote><i>You don't want to know how sausages are made!</i></blockquote>

<p>
But then I can't resist grossing out people with some details anyway...
</p>
<p>
Two years ago, I wrote <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/PAR-Repository-Client">PAR::Repository::Client</a> as an interface for loading
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/PAR">PAR</a>s and thus arbitrary modules from a remote server. If the client
is installed, all you need to do to auto-load missing modules from
the server is:
</p>

<pre>
  use PAR { repository => 'https://foo.com/myapp' };
  use Foo; # will be loaded from remote if necessary
</pre>

<p>
But since this may become expensive, and caching the binaries only
removes part of that, the "install" option was part of the
interface almost from the start:
</p>

<pre>
  use PAR { repository => 'https://foo.com/myapp', install => 1 };
  use Foo; # will be loaded AND INSTALLED if necessary
</pre>

<p>
Back then, I also added most of the code necessary for an "upgrade"
option.
</p>

<pre>
  use PAR { repository => 'https://foo.com/myapp', upgrade => 1 };
  use Foo; # will be loaded AND INSTALLED OR UPGRADED if necessary
</pre>

<p>
Unfortunately, it was missing a few critical details until today.
The repository client is normally only invoked when all other sources
fail. But that's a problem if you're trying to check for upgrades.
Thus, repositories in upgrade-mode are now checked early in the module-loading
process.
</p>

<p>
The real bummer was that in order to check for upgrades, the locally installed
version has to be determined. Since this is hard to do reliably without loading
the module, that's what PAR has to do. But that means require()ing module X from
within an early @INC hook that ran due to a "require X;". There's so many things
wrong with that idea, it's not even funny. It seems that creating an infinite
recursion in an @INC hook segfaults perl 5.8.9.
Regardless, it can be (and was) made to work:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Before running the client's upgrade_module method, dynamically override the set of active (via PAR.pm) PAR::Repositories to be empty.</li>
<li>Run the current repository client's upgrade_module method which
will attempt to require the module for checking its version.</li>
<li>Afterwards, check whether the module was loaded using %INC.</li>
<li>If not, continue normally, probably ending up failing to load the module from anywhere or loading the freshly installed copy.</li>
<li>If the module was loaded, prevent an additional loading with an evil trick in
the @INC hook:</li>
</li>
</ul>

  
<pre>
  my $line = 1;
  return \*I_AM_NOT_HERE, sub { $line ? ($_="1;",$line=0,return(1)) : ($_="",return(0)) };
</pre>

<p>
Even disregarding the slight obfuscation, can you figure out how this works?
</p>

<p>
One obscure feature of @INC and the module loading is the return value(s) of
a subroutine @INC hook. It normally simply returns a file handle that the
module code is then read from. But if it returns a code ref as its second
return value, that code ref is called repeatedly until it returns false.
After each invocation, $_ is assumed to contain the next line of the module code.
If the first argument was a file handle nonetheless, $_ is initialized to
a new line from the file handle before calling the subroutine.
</p>
<p>
The motivation here is mostly that we want to set the file contents to "1;".
Unfortunately, passing undef as the file handle resulted in the subroutine not
being called. This smells like a bug in perl to me, but I'll have to check that
more closely with blead. Furthermore, it's not wise to load any unnecessary
modules in PAR.pm as they would have to be included verbatim in an uncompressed
part of PAR::Packer created executables. Therefore, instead of simply passing
a IO::Handle->new(), I'm supplying an arbitrary GLOB ref.
</p>
<p>
Finally, the subroutine itself simply sets $_ to "1;" in the first invocation
and returns zero on the second to stop the evaluation, thus essentially
short-circuiting require()'s loop through @INC.
</p>
<p>
After going through this considerable pain, I got the auto-upgrading feature
of PAR::Repository::Client to work. There's probably still bugs and
testing it as part of the test suite is no fun (but still feasible).
</p>
<p>Stay tuned for a new release of the involved modules.</p>
<p>
Cheers,<br/>
Steffen
