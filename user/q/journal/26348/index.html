<p><p>There should be a warning label on perl. Do not attempt any breakthroughs on a work night.</p>
<p>A very, very good friend of mine has been helping me learn perl. I have never learned any languages, and the perl isn't as difficult as the understanding of how to actually program. It's an interesting and exciting time.</p>
<p>Today he was teaching me about references, and we created a module. It attacked various celebrities using claw and biting attacks, and it really helped me to understand concepts that were completely foreign to me, but now I cannot sleep. All I can do is continue to read Programming Perl, pushed on by the fact I can actually understand what it's talking about this time.</p>
<p>Time to take some sleeping pills as a precaution, and attempt some more examples. I feel like I'm moving at a decent pace, I've been learning perl off and on for the last 3 months, and although I still spend more time worrying about the ability to write something than actually writing it, I feel confident that at some point it will all spring to life in my head.</p></p>
