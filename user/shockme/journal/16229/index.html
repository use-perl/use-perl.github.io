I finally got around to putting the <a href="http://perladvent.org">Perl Advent Calendar</a> RDF on my <a href="http://exitwound.org/shock">(e)xitwound.org journal</a>.  Very cool ... and now I don't have to fret about forgetting about it.
<P>
Justin and I finished <b>Medal of Honor Rising Sun</b> (cooperative mode) tonight.  It's a very fun game, although the cooperative mode is a little short.  I'm psych'd to see cooperative mode finally taking off on the PS2, and I'm really looking forward to the time when cooperative mode is the primary focus, with solo mode eating the short sheet.
<P>
So, having conquered WW2, we moved on to <b>SOCOM 2: US Navy SEALs</b>, which (absent network capability -- coming soon to a Christmas tree near me) doesn't have a cooperative mode.  Justin bored quickly, but I played it long enough to satisfy my curiosity.  It looks like they've really done a bang-up job on this one.  Very deep, and very involved.  I'm looking forward to spending some quality time with it.
<P>
Given Justin's quick dismissal of SOCOM 2, we moved on to <b>Time Splitters 2</b>.  The graphics leave much to be desired, but it's a fast moving, fun game.  Tonight we conquered Siberia, 1990.  Tomorrow, we invade Chicago circa 1932.  I dig Chi-Town.
<P>
While fragging our way through Siberia, I took about 7 telephone calls/pages from the office.  We're having cooling problems on a few of our servers, and one's NIC keeps dying.  Disabling and re-enabling it does the trick.  I'm betting I get paged during the night and have to drive to the office.  Grrr....
<P>
If you've never tried it, I highly recommend Scotch and Sprite.  Aim for a 1 to 4 or 1 to 5 ratio between the Scotch and the Sprite.  It's a staple around my house - and when I say "my house", I mean "me" (although Lori does enjoy them, too).  Good stuff.  You won't regret it.<br/><br/>
