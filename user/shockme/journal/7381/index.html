<p>All day long I kept thinking, "This can't be right ... I haven't seen one thing land in my Inbox all day, and I haven't received one SPAM at all."  I even sent 2 test email to my home addy to test it, and they never appeared, and they never bounced.
<P>
So, I get home from work, and some friends arrive for dinner.  A case of beer (give or take a 6) and they leave.  I turn on the monitor, and a <TT>ps -ax | grep evol</TT> reveals that Evolution <I>is still running</I> even though I x'd out of it last night (as I do every night).  There were so many processes, it was faster for me to log out of X and log back in than it was to attempt to kill -9 everthing.
<P>
Upon re-login, all of my missing email was there.  Apparently x'ing out of Evolution isn't a guarantee.  It may still be be running in the background, siliently collecting your email .... </p>

<p>I've been running Evolution as my primary mailer since May or June.  (Mac died in April and I literally didn't respond to email for two months.)  I've seen a lot of things, and many times I find I have to shut it down and restart to get mail.  Fortunately I'm on one high traffic mailing list, so I can check that folder and know I need to restart if I haven't received anything in about four hours.</p>

<p>I'd say Evolution is not quite ready for primetime, yet, though I have high hopes it will be improving.  They do seem to keep making new releases.</p>

<p>My biggest gripe is Evolution takes forever to open a new window on my low-memory laptop.  Replying to a message, composing a new message, or just double-clicking on a message to read it in its own window instead of the preview pane involves making the click and wandering off to find a short task to do while I wait.</p>

Ditto on the new window thing.  Often I'll click on Reply or New Mail, and it takes just long enough that I start to think that maybe I didn't click it.  So, I click it again, the first one pops up, and as I'm typing the email, the second one appears.
<p>
They have really made some great strides, though.  I can remember trying it way back when it was first released, and it (predictably) sucked.  I'm more of a mutt user, but Evolution has made a believer out of me.
</p><p>
The only good thing (IMNSHO) about my department's eventual migration from Exchange 5.5 to Exchange 2000 is the Evolution plugin for 2000.  Once I get that operational, I really won't have much more use for my VMWare stuff.
</p><p>
I haven't heard of anyone experiencing your issue of having to restart to get mail.  That would annoy the hell out of me, though.</p>
