Since the kids will be in Odessa tomorrow, Santa came early this year.  This morning when we woke, we found his footprints by the fireplace, and a note in Justin's stocking.  Apparently a gust of wind blew several presents off his sleigh and into the backyard, so the kids had to go find them.
<P>
Lori's parents came up last night, and mine arrived around 10:00AM.  It was a fantastic day.
<P>
My new laptop arrived around 2:30PM.  With no CD-ROM drive.  Grrr ... no OS, no floppy, no CD.  How the <I>hell</I> am I supposed to play?  The guy was very apologetic and is sending one out ASAP.  Still, that leaves me until Monday evening - minimum - without my new toy.
<P>
For years, my Postfix server has been running on a dual Pentium Pro 200 with an astounding 32MB RAM (yeah, I know -- <I>astounding</I>).  It's also my (and several others') DNS server  I've looked into bumping the RAM, but it's going to cost in the neighborhood of $300 to get it to 128MB.  Nope.
<P>
Tonight, I've resurrected an old single Pentium Pro 200 that has 256MB RAM.  This machine gave up the ghost some time back due to some heat damage.  Repairs so far have been minimal.  It's going to be the new email server.  I'm preparing a Debian install with jigdo.  The CD should be ready to go by morning ...<br/><br/><br><br>Posted from <a href="http://exitwound.org/shock">exitwound.org</a>.</p>
