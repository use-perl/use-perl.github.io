<p><a href="http://www.opera.com/linux">Opera</a> is my browser of choice, but v6.0 TP2 - while being far superior to v5.0 - is an unpredictable pain in the ass.  They should change the wording on the "Back" button to read "core dump".  This would save a lot of real estate, because they wouldn't need the Forward button.  If you can't go back, you'll never go foward.  Piece of crap.
<P>
Finally got my kernel upgraded to 2.4.17.  Whoohoo.  CDROM access has been restored.  Please feel free to move about the cabin.

<I>Update 19:11</I><br>
I've been trying to learn CGI.pm in my spare time.  You wouldn't think it would be that hard, but it's kickin my butt.  I keep telling myself it's because I'm learning it in the evenings when I'm tired.  Either way, it's starting to piss me off.  I don't know if <a href="http://www1.fatbrain.com/asp/bookinfo/bookinfo.asp?theisbn=1565924193&vm=">CGI Programming With Perl</a> is poorly written, or if I'm just too impatient.  I readily admit that I'm skipping around alot, but finding what I need seems very difficult.  I'm somewhat disappointed in the content, and find myself using perldoc to locate what I really need.  Maybe I just need a break from everything, but I really want to get this crap working.</p>
