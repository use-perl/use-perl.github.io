<p>At the office, we use <a href="http://www.postnuke.org">PostNuke</a> for our Systems Group's documentation portal and announcements.  We also use <a href="http://phpwiki.sourceforge.net">PHP Wiki</a> for various purposes, but mainly for daily journals and general "how to" documents.
<P>
Many moons ago, we used <a href="http://www.phpnuke.org">PHPNuke</a>.  At that time, I wrote a small module that was basically a checklist.  However, I didn't port it when we migrated to PostNuke, and haven't really thought that much about it.  Especially since no one had bitched about its absence.
<P>
Until today.  Now it's a <I>must have</i>.
<P>
PHP Wiki plugs into PostNuke very nicely.  But getting it operational under PHPNuke isn't that easy.  And it's not well documented either.  I had it working where I could access it directly (http://document_root/modules/phpWiki/index.php), but accessing as a module wasn't happening.  All I ever got was a blank page.
<P>
I was going through PostNuke's documentation on creating modules ... good lord, man.  It quickly became apparent that I didn't have time to "do it the right way".
<P>
So, I hacked up a Perl script that will access the PostNuke cookies to determine permissions, etc., and present the checklist.  It's a hack, no doubt.  But it's working quite well.  Once I have a little more time, I'll revisit the PostNuke documentation and do it correctly.
<P>
Justin barfed at school today.  No fever.  No weirdness.  Just puke.  Lori picked him up at lunch and took her back to work with her.  He's all kinds of pissed that he couldn't go out and play tonight ...<br/><br/><br><br>Posted from <a href="http://exitwound.org">exitwound.org</a>, comment <a href="http://www.exitwound.org/shock/archives/000021.html">here</a>.</p>
