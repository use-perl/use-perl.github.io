<p>They are idiots.  And everyone knows it.  Even <i>they</i> are self-consciously aware of this fact.  
<P>
They bristle and quickly become angered when fact and circumstances (planned or otherwise) conspire to highlight their inadequacies.  And yet they seem so comfortable with their stupidity.  They rarely research any problem, and I have never known them to purchase a book at their own expense.  Personal and professional growth are concepts too foreign ...
<P>
Everyone knows that they are incompetent, incapable, ineffectual, unfit, unskilled and unqualified.
<P>
And they know it too.
<P>
However, they have insisted that they should be the primary group responsible for managing and administering IIS.
<P>
I insisted that we not fight them ... that we simply let them take control.  With a few discrete hints and very little wrangling, Management (in its infinite and all-knowing wisdom) decreed that yes, control and administration of the IIS servers should be passed to that group.
<P>
And so, today, I hear them talking ... "Security is very important to me, you know.  That's why I turned off SSL on my browser."
<P>
Oh, dear God ...<br/><br/><br><br>Posted from <a href="http://exitwound.org">exitwound.org</a>, comment <a href="http://www.exitwound.org/shock/archives/000014.html">here</a>.</p>
