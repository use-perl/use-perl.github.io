<p><P>
I received an email today stating that my new laptop should be delivered before 4:30PM, 12-24-2003.  w00t.
<P>
I've decided not to install Debian just yet.  I've been wanting to give <a href="http://www.gentoo.org">Gentoo</a> a whirl, and now seems as good a time as any.  Also, with the recent troubles that Debian has had (and the lengthy timeline involved in their recovery - packages.debian.org has been down for over a week now), it just seems that now is the time ...
<p>
I've already downloaded and burned the 2 LiveCD set, so once it arrives, I should be ready to install Gentoo on it shortly after unboxing it ... assuming that it's actually the machine I ordered.
<P>
I spent the day (day 1 of my vacation, no less) cleaning the house.  Justin helped quite a bit.  LJ bailed on us, and is staying with her grandparents until Tuesday.  They'll be bringing her up when they come up for Christmas.  And I've saved some very special chores for her.  I can hear the whining already.
<p>
Justin and I spent alot of time trying out new characters on Gauntlet ... I expect more of the same tomorrow.
<P>
Tonight is Lori's office Christmas party.  Some French place.  I can feel my anus constricting already ...
<P>
And I've <I>got</I> to get my checkbook lined out before my head hits the pillow tonight.  It's a nightmare ...
