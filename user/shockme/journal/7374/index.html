<p>Man, I've accomplished so very little today.  I started with the best of intentions.  I was going to hit the office, call Sendmail, nail that sucker, and move on to bigger and greater accomplishments.  I was going to be the man on the silver mountain ...
<P>
And then apathy set in.  I hit a thread on Slashdot regarding Microsoft's latest EULA and HIPAA, and (because sometimes I just don't know when to shut the hell up) ended up reading HIPAA and creating a huge list of points of concern for the boss-man.  
<P>
While I was working on this masterpiece, I downloaded John The Ripper and started it running, just to see if it'd crack any of the passwords on my system.  2.5 hours and counting, it's discovered 1 out of 5 passwords.  The particular account in question needs to be removed anyway.  I doubt seriously that it'll crack my personal password.  A while back I downloaded and modified easypass.pl, and I use it for my password creations.  It creates passwords like:
<blockquote>
&#burchtimed2444<br>
purrstubes8832)%<br>
expel1155)*sound<br>
))chafelithe4141<br>
1760$+steamreach<br>
hamalstars3563!#<br>
==vitaeyaqui6221<br>
revelgreat2748$^<br>
99(#sniffaptly42<br>
_@colorclank2098<br>
</blockquote>
<P>
Sometimes it generates some pretty funny ones.  I think I'm on fairly safe ground, password-wise.  Nothing's perfect, but those are pretty decent passwords.
<P>
For the past week, I have been without Kleenex (aka, tissue) at the office.  We have a lady who orders this stuff, and she tells me it should arrive any day now.  Still, it's amazing how often a person uses something like tissue.  You don't really miss it until it's not there.  I kept my empty box on my desk to remind me to ask about it, but I finally threw it away.  Without really thinking about it, I'd just reach over to grab one, and my hand would get stuck in the box.
<P>
Maybe tomorrow I'll have more energy and can actually get something accomplished.  Maybe tomorrow the tissue man will come ...</p>

How many of those style passwords do you have active at any given moment?<br> <br>I'd be somewhat hard pressed to remember a new one of those a fortnight, let alone 7 at a given time.

I'd guestimate about 20.  <a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/user/wbsoft/linux/tkpasman.html" title="xs4all.nl">TkPassMan</a xs4all.nl> to the rescue.

Ah. Cheating =)<br> <br>I'm quite fond of ssh, with the ability to authenticate via keys. You just remember the key's password and you can unset/disable the actual password. Screwed if you forget the key's password, mind you, or lose the key, but you do get to use ssh-agent =)
