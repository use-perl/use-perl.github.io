<p>Okay, so I suck at this web log (aka, blog, blogg, et. al.) / journal thing.  
<P>
And, based on my last journal entry, the C++ thing is sucking too.
<P>
On the upside, the beer-drinking thing seems to be going well ...
<P>
What can I say?  I've been lax, and it's certainly not laziness.  I've actually been quite busy.  
<P>
My job as *nix System Admin is rocking along, and I find myself doing fewer and fewer Windows-related tasks.  Mainly because we hired a Windows-type god, and also because <I>everyone</I> has figured out how powerful Perl is.  I spend, on average, about 25 - 50% of each week coding something for someone.  Combined with tweaking Apache, installing PHP-something-or-other,  <I>finally</I> convincing management that we can run a fail-over sendmail system on a Linux box (rather than Solaris), and teaching Perl to the other systems programmers (weekly, sponsored by upper management), I've been a busy little Monger.
<P>
But wait!  That's not all you get .... I've also been delving deeply into Perl/Tk.  And I absolutely love it.  I suck, but I'm getting better.  It all started with my wife's aversion to the command line ...
<P>
I have a pretty cool MySQL MP3/Ogg set up.  All of my CDs are ripped and catalogued in a MySQL database.  I have a few command line scripts that allow me to play whatever I want.  For example:
<P>
play -t=metal
<P>
will play every MP3/Ogg file that is of the Type <I>metal</I>.
<P>
play -p='drowning pool'
<P>
will play every song by the Performer <I>Drowning Pool</I>.  Etc., etc., etc.
<P>
My wife <I>despises</I> the command line.  Her response was basically, "I just want to be able to point and click, and it play what I clicked on."
<P>
And thus was born the <a href="http://mcc.sourceforge.net">Music Control Center</A>, my new little pet project.  It's already grown beyond what I had anticipated, and keeps me quite busy.  But, it's perl, it's Tk, and it's alot of fun.
<P>
And I guess that's all that really matters.</p>
