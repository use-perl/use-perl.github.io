<p>My 6 year-old boy and I play Playstation2 quite often.  <I>Quite</I> often.  Hours on end.  My 7 year-old daughter has made a valiant effort to get involved, but explosions and fragging really aren't her style.  So, when I stumbled across an article on the game Dance Dance Revolution (DDR) the other day, it got me to thinking.  Little girls like to dance.  They like to listen to music.  And, God knows I need the exercise.  I hit google, and read a few reviews on game pads, and found a pretty decent deal on 2 pads and the latest game.   
<P>
The package arrived yesterday, and we assembled the pads last night.  She couldn't wait to get home from school so we could dance.  We danced for hours.  And hours.  5.5 and counting as of this writing.  I have to admit, the game is every bit addicting as everyone claims.  Even $family{wife} is getting into it.  This is working out better than I'd hoped.
<P>
My only complaint with the game is that it makes my beer very foamy ....
<P>
Speaking of Hancom, does anyone have experience with <a href="http://new.mandrakestore.com/mdkinc/index.php?PAGE=tab_2/menu_0.php&id_art=181&LANG_=en#GOTO_181">their office suite</a>?  I've tried <a href="http://www.hancom.com">their website</a>, but it's either down or offline.</p>

<h2>Video games and families</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jdavidb/">jdavidb</a> on 2002-09-13T02:51:21</h3>
<p>My fondest memories of childhood are playing video games with my dad.  In 1984, our new Atari (thanks Dad!  I still have it!) brought our family together as we recovered from a crisis.  Pac-Man was #1 for us, even though it's considered to be a horrible game (on the 2600).  In later years, Dad kept me awake late into the nights playing Tetris, Mah-Jong, and some other game I can't remember, on my Apple IIGs.  I have fond memories of that, too, although some of those memories involve me throwing a pillow at him and whining, "Daaaad!  It's almost midnight!  I gotta sleeeep!"<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<p>In short, treasure these moments.</p>
