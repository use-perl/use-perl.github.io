<p>Another day, nothing done, but this time, it's not my fault.  
<P>
I started the day running through the Sendmail installation instructions, ensuring all of the directory permissions/ownership were correct.  I hadn't created the security certificates yet, so I was off to server #3 to do that.  Server #3 was non-responsive.  (We're going through an IP change-over, so big deal.)  After I reconfigured server #3, it's still non-responsive.  I'm trying to track down the networking guys to the get ports straightened out, when I'm suddenly derailed.
<P>
One of the research servers is offline.  I go to investigate, and the damned thing is unplugged.  The electrical cord is connected to a swing arm on the rack.  When the swing arm is fully extended, it unseats the plug.  Great.  So, I get one of the guys to start working on that, while I try to get the server back online.  And things got alot worse ....
<P>
From that point until the end of the day, it was one thing after another.  A lot of small shit that eventually smothered any hope of productivity.
<P>
Anybody have experience with the PS2 version of Dance Dance Revolution?</p>
