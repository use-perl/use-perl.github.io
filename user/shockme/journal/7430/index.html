<p>So, before I leave the office last night, I'm on the telephone with a guy on the west coast.  He provides support for one the applications running on two of our servers.  The app is broken, and I'm giving him a run down of the log files.  During the conversation, I make it abundantly clear that we (my work group) have made <I>absolutely no</I> changes to the server.  <B>None</B>.  He tells me not to worry about it, that he'll check it out and take care of it.  I head home.
<P>
This morning, what do I spy in my Inbox but an email from him stating:
<blockquote>
Well whatever upgrade or configuration change occured 8-28 - 8-29 on the
[machine name] machine has it DOWN. I cannot figure out what that is. [My application] is up an (<I>sic</I>) working.
</blockquote>
<P>
Basically, whatever the problem is, it's not his doing.  It's mine.  I don't care about email like this one, because it's the typical reaction from external "support" personnel.  What really set me off was
<OL>
<LI>I had already told him that we had made <B>no</B> changes to the server.  <B>None.</B>
<LI>He CC'd the affected customers (<I>my</I> customers) on the email
</OL>
<B>PRICK</B>.
<P>
My boss chewed him a new one.  As mad as I was, by the time my boss got through with him, I was almost embarassed.
<P>
The problem turned out to be a corrupted configuration file.  <I>His</I> configuration file.  The one <I>his application</I> uses.
<P>
Heheh.
<P>
My $family{wife} and I are going to dinner tonight.  Just the two of us.  It's gonna be a little piece of heaven.  I'm gonna drink like a fish ...</p>
