<p>Well, the Solaris box is locked down tight.  Only port 22 is currently open.  I installed a bunch of <a href="http://www.gnu.org">GNU</a> stuff on it today.  Bash was the first thing, then gcc to compile ssh.  Once ssh was installed, I was able to begin working from my desk once more.  My feet were enternally thankful.  Then I installed Perl and a ton of other stuff.  With any luck, we can migrate sendmail tomorrow.
<P>
I've got to patch the mGen system.  According to their technical support, they can't stream to anything higher than MSIE 5.03 or something.  How stupid is that?  Anywho, that should hopefully go quick tomorrow.  I'd love to put that project to bed.
<P>
The weather here is <b>cold</b> today.  For the past few days, we've had very pleasant 70 - 75 degrees.  Today, it's raining and in the mid-30's or so.  On the upside, I work indoors.  Looks like a good night for the fireplace and whiskey......
<P>
And <a href="http://www.perlmonks.org">PerlMonks</a> is back online!  W00H00!</p>
