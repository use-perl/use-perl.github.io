<p>I took my daughter to Tae Kwon Do last night.  The building is structured such that you can watch the class  (which lasts an hour) from a small waiting room, but you can't sit down.  So, rather than play "battling elbows" with all of the other parents, I hit the local Barnes & Noble.
<P>
As I was almost finished skimming the computer books, I spotted <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0072131829/qid=1031181778/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_1/104-0504841-1607128?v=glance&s=books">Incident Response</a>, a security book I'd been wanting to check out for a while now.  I'd heard alot about it, but hadn't had the opportunity to page through it.
<P>
I could not put the book down.  <I>Damn</I>.  This is really good stuff.  Not wanting to pay Barnes & Noble's outrageous prices ($39.95 + tax), I checked out prices on the 'net later that night.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com">Amazon</a> had it for about $25.00.  While I was digging around the site, I stumbled upon <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0072222824/qid=1031181905/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_1/104-0504841-1607128?v=glance&s=books">Anti-Hacker Tool Kit</a>, which kind of impressed me.
<P>
Then I remembered a book I had at the office.  Something to do with Oracle administration.  I've had the book for probably a year, and haven't cracked it once.  So, today at lunch, I exchanged the Oracle book for <I>Incident Response</I>.  While there, I paged through <I>Anti-Hacker</I> and was pretty impressed with its content.  So, I went back to the office and ordered it from Amazon.
<P>
I really dig security, but haven't had much of an opportunity to play with the nuts and bolts.  I'm really looking forward to playing with this stuff.</p>
