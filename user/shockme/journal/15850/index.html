<div class="span8">
<p>Somewhere along the line, I made the "strategic" decision (although at the time, it didn't <I>feel</I> strategic) to install Mandrake rather than RedHat on 4 of our servers.  No big deal, right?  I mean, when you strip away all of the bells and whistles, Mandrake is pretty much RedHat is pretty much Mandrake.
<P>
4 servers.  DNS servers.  2 internal, 2 external.  Mandrake.
<P>
Fastforward about 6 months, and suddenly one of the external DNS servers is now also our failover Sendmail server.  I had a few weenie-type issues getting the commercial version of Sendmail to run on it.  Sendmail's technical support, while making sure that I understood that they didn't support Mandrake, were more than helpful, and in a very short period of time, it was working.
<P>
As part of the Sendmail installation, I also installed Trend Micro's Interscan VirusWall.  It's got all sorts of scanning shit, but all we use is the SMTP stuff.  I spend more time disabling what we don't use than getting the rest of the set-up configured.
<P>
And merrily we rocked along.
<P>
After a while, the Security Team contacts me.  Interscan is supposed to automatically download and update the virus files on a nightly basis.  It's working perfectly on the primary MTA, but on the secondary (Mandrake, external DNS), it's not.  And they can't figure out the error message.  I tell them that I'm well aware that it's not automatically updating, because I've been manually updating it for the past 6 months or so.  I tell them to contact Trend Micro and get it resolved because I'm tired of manually updating the thing.
<P>
Once Trend Micro heard "Mandrake", that was the end of the discussion.  They only support RedHat, and absolutely refused to discuss the matter any further.
<P>
Now, I understand the <I>asshole concept</I> better than most.  Hell, I wrote a few chapters myself.  And I also understand the magnitude of providing technical support across several different platforms.  But refusing to even discuss the matter with us?  Refusing to even walk through a configuration file or two and to at least let us know that we had set up the machine properly?  That's inexcusable.
<P>
Trend Micro lost themselves a customer today.  We were evaluating alternatives within an hour of their refusal.
<P>
And I'm 50% finished with a Perl script that'll autmatically download the updates from their site and apply them.
<P>
Interscan may not be willing to discuss the matter, but I'll be damned if I can't fix what they <I>won't</I>.
<P>
And they can have my Perl script, too.  Right after they smooch my lilly-white ass.<br/><br/>
