If I could get my hands on the guy, I truly believe I would beat him to death with the CD-RW drive <B>that he mailed today</B>.
<P>
Huh?  <I>Today</I>?
<P>
Yeah.  He told me he'd express mail it on December 24.  I followed up with an email explaining why it would be <B>really great</B> if I had the drive on December 29.  When I arrived back in town last night, I was more than a little pissed to find that he hadn't emailed me yet.  So I emailed a status request to him.
<P>
And he apparently mailed the drive sometime between receiving that email and 15:45 CST.  Oh, so apologetic.  So supplicating.  So expiatory <I>and</I> explanatory.
<P>
<B>As God as my witness I would beat him to death with the drive.</B>
<P>
In the language of the United States Postal System, <I>overnight</I> does not carry the <I>obvious</I> meaning.  See, in the context of the English language, we might take it to mean something like "[d]uring or for the length of the night".  We might then believe that an <I>overnight delivery</I> would translate to delivering some package from point A to its final destination (<I>a.k.a.</I> point B) <I>during the length of the night</I>.
<P>
But we would be foolish naives to believe such fodder, because we would be overlooking the <I>United States Postal Service</I> definition.  Now, I am well aware of the <I>official</I> definition, but I'm talking about the <I>real world</I> definition.  You know, the one that reads something along the lines of "We will deliver this package overnight, but we specifically reserve the right to designate a night of our choosing."
<P>
<B>As God as my witness I would beat him to death with the drive.</B>
<P>
And if he required a signature proof of delivery <B>I will tear his heart out with the pen ...</B>
