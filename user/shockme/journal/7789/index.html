<p>It was supposed to be easy ... nothing to it really.  All we had to do was change the IP addresses of a few key servers ...
<P>
The day started early, 3:30am.  The first server I converted, a Solaris box, was a breeze.  <tt>sys-unconfig</tt>, reboot, a quick setup, create <tt>/etc/defaultrouter</tt> and modify <tt>/etc/nsswitch.con</tt>, and the mail was routing.  Off to the Windows boxes ...
<P>
I was about 1/2 through converting my second machine, and the team was about the same.  Then WINS began to crack under its own weight.  See, over the years, our WINS servers have been picking up alot - <B>alot</B> - of static entries.  Apparently, anytime something wasn't working correctly, someone in the department would call Microsoft, who would recommend <I>yet another</I> static entry.  And the changes we were making were apparently the last straw for this brittle, God forsaken piece of "technology".  And once it started buckling, the resulting crash was unavoidable.
<P>
The rest of the day was hell ...
<P>
I love it when users call, start the conversation with something like "I know you've probably received 500 calls like this today, and you're up to your chin in emergencies, and I know you're working extremely hard to get us back online ..." <b>and then proceed to tear me a new asshole</b>.  Yeah, keep it up, lady.  Welcome to the bottom of my to-do list.
<P>
On the upside, SpamAssassin is kickin' it.  So far, it's incorrectly identified only one email as SPAM.  Sweet ...</p>
