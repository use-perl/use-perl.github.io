<p>What a tiring weekend....
<P>
Friday night, the little boy who lives with me had his first overnight guest.  Yeah.  Very loud voices until the late hours of the night, closely followed by very loud voices in the wee hours of the morning.  I fought valiantly, but the battle to win rest was lost.
<P>
Saturday afternoon, the inlaws arrived.  I had run to the office to check the systems, and they were here when I got back.  I really dig my inlaws.  We get along great.
<P>
A friend came by seeking legal assistance for his dad.  I keep trying to impress on people that <I>I no longer practice law because <B>I hate it and don't want to do it</B></I>, but they don't listen.  So, I'll help his dad.  He is, after all, one of my best friends.
<P>
The main webserver went down on Saturday evening, so I had to go to the office and reboot it.  It does this every 6 - 10 days.  Eventlogs show nothing, and other than the fact that it's unreachable, everything looks fine.  A reboot always fixes it.  I'm currently campaigning to configure an automatic reboot of this machine every 3 - 4 days.  That'd fix that.
<P>
Sunday morning came early.  6:00am, at the office, flashing BIOS on a mail server.  w00h00.  Big fun.  I did manage to get a nice nap later in the afternoon.
<P>
Other than this, I did diddle.  I attempted a VPN to the office, only to bring down my network.  I guess I need to read the docs more closely.
<P>
And I'm looking for a PlayStation2.  It's definitely time to upgrade the games around here.
