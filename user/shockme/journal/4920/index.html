<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's been a while.  I've been busier than a one-legged cat trying to bury a turd on a frozen pond, <I>for sure</I>.
<P>
I've finally decided that it's now or never.  Either I start learning C++ or I just friggin' give it up.  So, last night I did a little research on C++ books, hit <a href="http://safari.oreilly.com">Safari</a>, checked one out, and got jiggy.  This evening, I downloaded <a href="http://www.kdevelop.org">KDevelop</a> and wrote my first C++ program.  It's not much, but it's miles from where I was two days ago.
<P>
I must say that KDevelop is, so far, extremely impressive.  Those guys are doing one helluva job.
<P>
On the Perl side of things, I <I>finally</I> finished the initial development on <a href="http://www.exitwound.org">my website</a>.  It was my first experience with HTML::Template and my first serious use of CGI.pm.  It's also my first time using CSS, and other than a few browser-specific issues, it's looking okay.  All in all, it's been a real hoot.  $family{wife} still won't use it though.  Whatever.  I think she's afraid that if she shows me any signs of encouragement, then I'll spend every non-work-related waking second digging deeper into it.  Like that's not going to happen sooner or later anyway.</p>
