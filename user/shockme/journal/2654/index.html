<p>This is quite a slow day.  Thank the lord.  After Friday, I needed it.  Spent most of the weekend lounging and recovering.
<P>
The Superbowl.  I didn't have any feelings one way or the other.  I guess I was rooting for the Rams, but didn't really care when they lost it.  Good to see New England finally pull one out.  Even better to have a Superbowl that's not extremely one-sided or, for the most part, over before half-time.
<P>
Off and on, over the past few weeks, we've been trying to get a working Debian installation.  So far, we're 0 for 5 attempts.  First, the NIC driver wouldn't work.  Over the weekend, we got Woody downloaded.  Burned it to CD today, and it craps out during the install with no real indication as to why.  It's a shame, too.  I run Debian at home, and I really miss apt-get.
<P>
I haven't been able to get Tk/Perl chatter to work since PerlMonks came back online.  *sigh*</p>
