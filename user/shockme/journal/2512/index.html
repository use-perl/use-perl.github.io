<p>With the exception of tweaking a perl script, I spent the entire day standing in front of a rack mount server trying to get Solaris configured.  No matter what I did, it would not correctly set up the ethernet card (hme0) on boot-up.  Finally gave up, issued the sys-unconfig command and reconfigured the entire system.  Success at approximately 17:00.
<P>
The first thing I'm doing tomorrow is burning a CD-R with gcc, bash, perl and few other things.  Gotta get this thing online if I'm ever going to get sendmail migrated/upgraded, etc.
<P>
My books from <href="http://cbd.booksonline.com">CDB</a> finally arrived today.  Got them at lunch.  The Solaris book is already paying off, and I'll be spending some time with it tonight.  The WinNT book didn't ship though, and it doesn't look like they're going to have it any time soon.  Damn it all.  They said they sent a coupon for me to order a different book, but I can't find it.  Whatever.
<P>
My feet hurt from standing in front of that rack mount all day.
<P>
Time for a few beers and a few reads through the Solaris book . . . I sure missed <a href="http://www.perlmonks.org">PerlMonks</a> today.  I think I'm addicted.</p>

<p> make sure your<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/etc/hosts file has the IP and hostname in it,<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/etc/hostname.hme0 is populated with the name of the host,<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/etc/resolv.conf and<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/etc/nsswitch.conf are both properly configured,<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/etc/netmasks if you have an oddball netmask,<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/etc/defaultrouter for your router/gateway [ numeric address] and you should be set. Also at the "OK&gt;" prompt you can type 'test net' to see if the hardware even sees the card/interface which will tell you pretty quickly if you've got a faulty card.</p>

<p>I highly recommend <a href="http://www.sunfreeware.com/" title="sunfreeware.com">sunfreeware</a sunfreeware.com> for most gnu stuff these days unless you need something custom or have lots of time to kill.</p>

thanks for the info.  i had done all of that (and yes, sunfreeware is quickly becoming my best friend - along with <a href="http://www.everythingsolaris.org/" title="everythingsolaris.org">Everything Solaris</a everythingsolaris.org>.  still, no joy.  sys-unconfig and reconfiguring everything got me up and running.  i just wish i'd done it sooner.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:/

<p>sys-unconfig does a lot more than just networking so it's easier [ and safer ] just to do it the good old fashioned way if you know how to do it. If you are newish to Solaris I have nothing but praise for the purple system admin book by Evie and Co. if you don't have it already. And we all have tales of pain and such...usually it's when you are in a panic or are tired when the flailing begins. Sometimes a little break helps...lunch or a walk around the building...to see what the problem is... I still chuckle at some of the stuff I've done over the years...Keep a good sense of humour.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<h2>Stand to type</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/TorgoX/">TorgoX</a> on 2002-01-30T01:57:39</h3>
Supposedly, having to stand to type is a good way to cut back on RSI -- it makes your feet tired before your hands get tired/injured.  Not a great way to <em>have</em> to work, tho -- more of a reminder to not work "too much".
