<p>Well, after a little further research, I discovered a cockpit error in the spamd restart script.  I'm trying to restart sendmail, spam-ass milter, and spamd every hour.  I placed all of the restart calls in a bash script, and cron'd it like so:
<P>
<code>
* 1 * * * /home/stephen/bin/restartSendmail.sh
</code>
<P>
Yep, that runs every morning at 1:00 whether I want it to or not.  Changing it to 0 * * * * fixed that.  spamd still hangs, but the restart script is correcting it in a more timely fashion now.  I hate that this is even necessary.  It's ugly.</p>

Have you tried just running spamassassin though procmail?<blockquote><div><nobr> <wbr></nobr><tt>:0fw<br>| spamassassin -P</tt> </div></blockquote>As I only get
This might work better than using a milter, as I recall they are broken in several versions of sendmail (the one that comes with 7.3 and I use anyway).

Surely you mean spamc / spamd?

A system-wide procmail was recommended by a friend the other day.  I think it's a good idea.  At any rate, it can't be possibly be worse than the existing solution.  (Okay, okay<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... things can <i>always</i> get worse<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...)
<p>
As soon as my workload subsides this week (yeah, right), I'll definitely be looking into it.</p>

Not quite sure what happened to that post. It was supposed to be something like:

As I only get &lt;50 emails a day. On our work server we get a couple of thousand and have had good results with spamc/spamd (just replace 'spamassassin -P' with 'spamc').</p>

Uh, that runs at every minute (60 times total) during 1am.  Do you really need to restart Sendmail that much? {grin}

Oh.  Right.  Heh.  Either way, it's completely <i>not</i> what I wanted.  But it does explain the huge drop in SPAM received between 1am and 2am.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)

<h2>Try pperl instead</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Matts/">Matts</a> on 2002-09-23T19:34:15</h3>
If it's performance you're worried about, try PPerl (from CPAN) for running<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/usr/bin/spamassassin instead. It'll be a little slower than spamd (for various reasons I won't go into), but you won't have the startup overhead of the perl compilation every time.
