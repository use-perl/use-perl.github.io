<p>Wow.  The last week and a half have been trying times on the computer front.  It seems that anything that <I>could</I> go wrong <I>has</I> gone wrong.
<P>
First, a simple <B>apt-get install ssh</B> left a client's email server completely unusable.  It did an upgrade to libc6 (which I had recently done on one of my servers), but something went horribly awry.  fork began barfing all over the place ... and I ended up practically working through the night to get it back into shape.
<P>
I upgraded my kernel version from 2.4.23 to 2.6.1.  Then my Synaptics touch pad stopped functioning.  I had to google the hell out of this one ... and then remembered reading something somewhere about moving drivers from kernel space to user space.  <I>Doh!  They were serious!</I>  I finally located 
<a href="http://w1.894.telia.com/user/u89404340/touchpad">Peter Ãâsterlund's page</a> which contains the new driver.  His page is outdated, but the INSTALL file is accurate.
<P>
There is something funky going on between my laptop and the office DHCP server.  Or possibly my laptop and the office network.  It just randomly drops me from the network.  5 minutes tops, and I'm offline.  <I>No network for you!</I>.  Weirdness.  I'll have to investigate this when I have more time <B>and</B> when there's someone from Networking around who actually knows what (s)he's doing.
<P>
And this morning my workstation at the office was dead.  Power supply.  <I>No power for you!</I>.  So, I've been working at a makeshift Windows box that is really good for nothing more than checking email and doing some light surfing.  Grrr ... I've got work I need to do, dammit!
<P>
On the upside, I did get SpamCop and SpamHaus integrated into my Postfix set up at the house.  And I tightened the configuration file down quite a bit.  Then I spent something akin to a leisurely afternoon watching the logs files and feeling good every time Postfix rejected an email.
<P>
Oh, and now my blog sync script isn't working ... great ...</p>
