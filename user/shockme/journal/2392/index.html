<p>first entry.  jeez....meant to start this on 01.02, first day on the
job.  things have just been too busy.
<P>
i've seemingly succeeded in making the transition from attorney back to
programmer/analyst.  budgetary concerns, but otherwise everything is
very cool.
<P>
the hours are 8:00 to 5:00 with an hour for lunch pretty much any time i
want to take it.  this has been a big adjustment for me, because i'm not
used to getting off work while it is still light outside.  also, the
whole holiday thing freaks me out.  i'm used to january 1, july 4,
thanksgiving day, and christmas day.  this job has *10* holidays, on
top of vacation.  technically, we're supposed to have 17 (!) days, so
since we are only getting 10, we're all picking up an extra 2 - 3 hours
per month vacation time.  basically, by the end of my first year here,
i'll have 3 weeks vacation.  holy sh*t!
<P>
first day on the job, they gave me a new dell gx400 and told me to
install whatever version of linux i wanted.  i opted for redhat, only
because the servers i support are redhat.  also, while debian installed
okay, i could not get the 3c59x module to speak to the network.  so,
redhat it is.  i installed win2k on a 10gb vmware virtual disk.  the
next day, they gave me a 17" flat panel.  enlightement rocks at
1280x1024.
<P>
my first project is to install the mgen server, get it talking to the
ncube boxes, and make the video feeds work.  so far, so good.  i'm
currently struggling with the client-side video player.  everything on
the server end looks good, but video client is tanking.
<P>
my next project, beginning next week, is to upgrade sendmail on the
email server.  this will also entail a reinstall of the solaris os.
should be fun.  i've estimated about a week for the whole project.  once that's done, i'll be bringing the network management server back online.  (i'm still not clear as to why it's offline.....)
<P>
also, in the very short time i've been here, i've already developed the
reputation of the "go to" guy if you need a data file parsed.  long live
perl.
<P>
so, inside of my first month, i'm already being exposed to nt, 2k,
ncube, solaris, and oracle.  by the end of the year, i should be hip
deep in it.
<P>
i really like everyone i'm working with.  linux and perl.  this job
rocks and life is good.</p>
