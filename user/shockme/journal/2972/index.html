<p>Well, eventlog.pl is ready for primetime.  I spent most of the afternoon identifying event codes that could safely be ignored, and modifying the script to cycle through every server we have.
<P>
One of the systems programmers cornered me and wanted to more about "this perl thing."  He was amazed that <B>yesterday</B> I was talking about parsing the log files and <B>today</B> I was actually ready to implement the solution.  He was <I>really</I> impressed when I explained that doing remote backups of each server's log files would be a cakewalk, and that the code was already written for us in the POD.
<P>
So, I spent a few minutes showing him the script, explaining CPAN, and pointing him to Activestate.com, and letting him know that he was more than welcome to borrow from my library.  Ker-ching!  If this keeps up, I may actually be able to convince the higher-ups to send me to Perl-related conventions.
<P>
It's time to go home, kick back, and enjoy a few well-deserved cold ones.  Did I say "few" . . . .?</p>
