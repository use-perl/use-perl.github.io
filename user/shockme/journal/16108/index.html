<p><P>
What do you say to a guy who goes on and on and on ... <I>ad nauseum</I> ... about the fact that we (he and I) <I>never</I> spend time together anymore.  How we <I>really</I> need to get together more often, etc., etc., etc.  And then, when he knows you'll be in town for 4 days, and knows how to get in touch with you, when it's been made clear that all he has to do is pick up the phone and he <I>absolutely</I> agrees to call ... and doesn't.
<P>
I say you don't say a thing.  Just move on and count yourself fortunate to have so easily identified someone who is, at best, an acquaintance.
<P>
If only I'd let it go years ago ... I've lost so much time over this guy.
<P>
Every time he has a problem, I'm the first to hear about it.  And I spend hours on the phone - or face-to-face - talking with him, listening, etc.  Every time he needs a shoulder, I'm the one he calls.  Every time he needs <I>anything</I>, it's me.
<P>
And I have unconditionally been there for him.  To the extent of opening my home to him, offering him room and board, feeding him, whatever the situation called for.  I have always been there, regardless of the circumstances.  I have actually lost favor with other people and countless opportunities, simply because I insisted on devotion to a friend.
<P>
But when it comes to just hanging out, being together, doing "friend" stuff, well ... he's got "family commitments", or "emergencies", or [insert convenient excuse here].  Oh sure, he can hang for an hour, if I'm willing to come pick him up.  Nevermind that it'll take me 20 minutes to drive to his place ...
<P>
It took me until this weekend to really see it, but I'm nothing more than a convenience.  And that kind of hurts.  I always considered him a brother, but I guess it's my own damned fault.
<P>
I'll live.<br/><br/><br><br>Posted from <a href="http://exitwound.org">exitwound.org</a>, comment <a href="http://www.exitwound.org/shock/archives/000031.html">here</a>.</p>
