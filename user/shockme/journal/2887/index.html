<p>So, Waylon Jennings has passed on.  I can't even begin to express how sad and empty this has made me.  I've been listening to the guy for years, and he was on my list of "must see" concerts.  Guess I'll have to wait on that one now.
<P>
It's so weird, too.  All week I've been on a big Waylon kick, listening to him almost continually.  On Wednesday, as I was driving back to work at lunch, I was trying to figure out how old he would be.  He was with Buddy Holly, which means he would've been about 20 in 1959.  About 30  when he had his first #1 in 1968, and in his mid-to-late 30s during the huge outlaw movement of the 70s (when he, Willie, Tompall and Jessie cranked out <a href="http://www.cdnow.com/cgi-bin/mserver/SID=1305871226/pagename=/RP/CDN/FIND/album.html/ArtistID=JENNINGS*WAYLON\WILLIE+NELSON\JESSI+COULTER/ITEMID=360739">the first country album to go platinum</a>.  So, he'd have been in his 60s today.
<P>
Turns out I was right.  He was 64.
<P>
60 albums, 16 No. 1 hits, 2 Grammy awards and 4 Country Music Association awards.
<P>
So long Waylon.  You will be missed.
