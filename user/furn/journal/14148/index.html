<p>I just got back from my job as sys admin at Columbia University (Teachers College) - I was in a basement Barnes and Noble in the computer book section when the power went out. It took me 28 hours to get home. At least I wasn't stuck in a subway! My wife is about to deliver so I was nervous the whole time. I sure need a better cell phone battery! Manhattan was beautiful in the dark. Very calm. Summer night. People helping each other. Broadway was full of glow sticks. Errie. Only one crime during the night on the upper west side. Someone tried to rob Radio Shack. Broke the plate glass window but there were so many cops patroling nearby that they bolted. I live in Branford CT (3 hour commute) and no trains, no subway. Stayed with my brother in the city. Good to see him.</p>
