<div class="span8">
<p><p>At this point in my career I'm probably 50/50 in the time I've
spent using Java and Perl. When I first got into Java my brain tried
to map Perlisms to Java, but I think I'm now fluent to the same degree
in each.</p>

<p>That said, even after six years of doing Java FT there are still
some things from Perl I dearly miss, and they break down into syntax
and constructs.</p>

<p><b>Syntax:</b> And I've said many times that, barring extreme
cases, disliking a language because of its syntax is like disliking a
spoken language because of a dialect. After a while of reading or
hearing it, you get acclimated. What was once jarring becomes the
norm. </p>

<p>That said, the things I miss most are <tt>next</tt>, <tt>last</tt>,
and <tt>unless</tt>. The first two are just lingo preferences both:
<tt>next</tt> and <tt>last</tt> are more humane (and informational)
than their equivalents, <tt>continue</tt>, and <tt>break</tt>. (Seeing
'break' in a program is still occasionally funny, as if you're
attempting to induce a random bug with a single verb.)</p>

<p>But <tt>unless</tt> is different. One of my pet peeves with Java
libraries is that there's never an 'isNot' for every 'is' property. So
you wind up mixing metaphors, using a terse negation operator with a
verbose boolean property invoked as a method. For example, if I wanted
to process a list only if it had data, I'd do:</p>

<pre>
List thingies = getThingies();
if <b>( ! thingies.isEmpty() )</b> {
   // do stuff with thingies
}
</pre>

<p>Besides the mixing metaphors, there's more of a logistical problem
(and source of a future rant): with most developers' weird whitespace
preferences, the negation becomes very difficult to see because it's
rendered as:</p>

<pre>
List thingies = getThingies();
if <b>(!thingies.isEmpty())</b> {
   // do stuff with thingies
}
</pre>

<p>Putting the negation in the method is better, either as:</p>

<pre>
List thingies = getThingies();
if <b>(thingies.isNotEmpty())</b> {
   // do stuff with thingies
}
</pre>

<p>or you can have a more readable positive version, which suffers
because it's not a valid JavaBean property and therefore either un- or
differently-usable by lots of tools and libraries:</p>

<pre>
List thingies = getThingies();
if <b>(thingies.hasItems())</b> {
   // do stuff with thingies
}
</pre>

<p>Both of these move the negation right, into the property. Perl
moves it left, into the condition declaration:</p>

<pre>
# assume that $thingies is a list object with methods
my $thingies = get_thingies();
<b>unless ($thingies->is_empty())</b> {
   // do stuff with thingies
}
</pre>

<p>But that's just the beginning. Where it really shines is with
prefix operations in loops where you want to skip items, or stop
iterating entirely. To take an example from my daily work, say you
have a plan of care for a nursing home resident and you want to only
use that plan if the resident is not 'on leave' (out of the home) or
discharged. In Java, this might look like:</p>

<pre>
Listlt;Plan> plans = getPlans();
for ( Plan plan : plans ) {
    <b>if ( plan.getResident().isNotActive() ) {
        continue;
    }</b>
    ...
</pre>

<p>(Note that a nice object designer put the negative condition as a
method!)</p>

<p>I could have put the 'continue' at the end of the line, eliminating
the braces, but then it gets lost. Perl gets around this by putting it
at the front, so you have:</p>

<pre>
my @plans = get_plans();
foreach my $plan ( @plans ) {
    <b>next unless ( $plan->resident()->is_active() );</b>
    ...
</pre>

<p>Reducing the number of lines (from 3 to 1) is secondary to making
your intent much clearer, and that's what I dearly miss. One of the
'features' built-in to Perl (and its culture) is TMTOWTDI. It makes
non-regular Perl users frustrated, but IMO it can actually make for
much more readable programs because your intent can be more clearly
stated.</p>

<p><b>Constructs:</b> The other two items, <tt>grep</tt> and
<tt>map</tt> are kissing cousins, and represent the ability to do
something on a bunch of stuff (an Iterable, in Java terms). That
something might be to conditionally include it into another bunch of
stuff, or to pull common data out of each of the bunch, or
whatever.</p>

<p>There are libraries that kinda-sorta do this (like 
<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/collections/">commons collections</a> 
or <a href="http://jga.sourceforge.net/">jga</a>), but
they're clunky as hell. It's not necessarily their fault, in many
cases Java makes this necessary. But the result is the same: the
clunkiness discourages the sort of active use that, again, expresses
intent much more clearly. For instance, say I wanted to pull out the
ID from every resident given the list of plans above. I could do it
the long way:</p>

<pre>
List&lt;Integer> residentIDs = new ArrayList<Integer>();
for ( Plan plan : getPlans() ) {
    residentIDs.add( plan.getResident().getID() );
}
</pre>

<p>whereas in Perl, it might be:</p>

<pre>
my @residentIDs = map { $_->resident()->id() } get_plans();
</pre>

<p>To the uninitiated, <tt>map</tt> is scary, using the infamous
<tt>$_</tt> that non-Perl folks seem to instinctively hate at first
sight. I always tell them, "Just substitute 'it' where you see
dollar-underscore." So your block now reads "get the resident from it,
then get the ID from the resident and return that." Not so scary, and
after you see it and use it a few times it's second nature -- you get
acclimated.</p>
