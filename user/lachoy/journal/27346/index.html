<p><p>I got my haircut at the Pittsburgh Hair Company in Dormont today, my usual place. It's close (walking distance), cheap, and the women there are pleasantly chatty. Usually the conversation is about the weather, vacations, kids, local happenings. But today it was hockey -- rhapsodizing about Crosby's passing ("It's even more amazing when you see it for real") and why Fleury's butterfly-style of goaltending is preferred, why the line of Foo, Bar and Baz will gel soon, and so on.</p>

<p>And I was the only guy in the place and don't know squat about hockey. Cool.</p>

<p>(Actually, this is probably just a 'generic northeast city moment', but whatever...)</p>

Neat.  Too bad the Penguins are the worst team in the NHL though.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)  But hey, they finally got a win!<br>

Oddly, there's no correlation between how crazy fans are about a team and the team's performance...

Yep.  A true Philadelphia fan (1) always roots for the home team, (2) believes they're all a bunch of bums (3) up to and including the moment when they win the championship, (4) except for that amazing lineup that played a few decades ago -- they were the best team in <tt>$sport</tt> ever to grace the game.

Except for (2) that sounds a lot like Steelers fans. The whole team isn't known as a bum, maybe up to a handful of choice players, and those are usually limited to defensive backs, the quarterback and maybe a wide receiver.
