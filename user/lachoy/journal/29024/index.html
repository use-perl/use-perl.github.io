<p><p>(Well, they're changes for me anyway.)</p>

<p>1. <b><a href="http://www.tamarindpa.com/index.shtml">Tamarind</a></b>
is, as you might expect, an Indian restaurant. It's in the Scott Town
Center strip mall and, also as you'd expect, it's a few doors down
from an Indian grocery, so after eating you can grab your bulk refills
for cumin, coriander, beans, rice, etc.. I think it opened in the last year or two. The restaurant is fairly small (8-10 tables?) and there may have
been one table open on a Saturday night, and about half open on a
Wednesday night.</p>

<p>We went there for the first time when some friends were visiting a
couple weeks ago and everyone really enjoyed it. I had the Aloo Saag,
very tasty and, while spicy, not overpowering.  Barb had the Aloo Gobi
Masala that was good, but not as good as mine. (Ha!) One of our friends got
the Chicken Tikka Masala, loved it, and her husband got something I
don't remember but it was apparently quite spicy -- he refused to stop eating so
the spicyness wouldn't catch up to him.</p>

<p>We went a few days later because our house was filled with an
airplane-glue smell from the water company cleaning out the
underground pipes. That time I had the Palak Paneer (great, but not
quite as spicy as when I make it with s/Paneer/Tofu/), and Barb got
the Aloo Saag. Great stuff, and reasonably priced, too.</p>

<p>Note: it's BYOB, and they charge a typical corking fee ($5).</p>

<p>2. Last night was my first trip to 
<b><a href="http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/style/fooddrink/restaurantreviews/s_424604.html">Pinati</a></b>
in Squirrel Hill. It's where Pino's used to be on Murray Avenue. 
Lots of kosher food, which IME means at least a few good vegetarian 
items (as opposed to afterthoughts). Barb's already been there a couple
times with former co-workers and had the veggie delight in laffa bread, 
so we just got that with a fried, cold eggplant salad to start. The
salad sounds weird (fried AND cold?) but it worked pretty well, and 
the slightly spicy tomato sauce on it worked for me. The sandwich was
good too; I hadn't had laffa bread before; it was thicker and more
substantial than a pita. Good pickles.</p>

<p>We had some sort of cheesecake covered in chocolate for dessert
which was so-so. The waitress recommended one of the chocolate
souffles for next time, patting her belly at the memory of one she'd
eaten earlier that day.</p>

<p>I don't think there's booze here either, and I don't know if it's BYOB.</p>

<p>3. I was disappointed to learn that the 
<b><a href="http://www.rolypolyusa.com/home.html">Roly Poly</a></b> 
in the Miracle Mile shopping center in Monroeville closed at the end 
of last month. The Panera around the corner seems to be packed no 
matter what time of day you go in; without the Roly Poly I'd 
imagine that's only going to get worse.</p>

<p>4. Also disappointed to see that <a href="http://www.madmex.com/">Mad Mex</a> took the Salmon Salad off
their menu -- it was swimming in cashews and lots of other great
textures. In fact, I think they took all salmon out of the menu --
worried about the environmental impact of Chilean salmon farming?</p>
