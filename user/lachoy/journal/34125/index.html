<p><p>Scheduling is a big part of our kickass product for nursing homes
(coming soon!). Generally there are:</p>

<p><ul>
  <li>appointments (Mrs. Slugworth has a beauty shop appointment on
  Tuesday at 4:30),</li>
  <li>recurring appointments (Mr. Dahl has a dialysis treatment every
  other Wednesday at 1:30),</li>
  <li>many types of scheduled care (record weight every Sunday at 3:00
  and the last Wednesday of every month at 3:00; do not give fluids
  for eight hours starting at 2 AM on August 13th; offer fluids every
  two hours between 6 AM and 9 PM from August 2 to September 15; etc.)</li>
</ul>

<p>One of my fundamendal tenets of software development is that
anything dealing with dates and times sucks hard. You have to deal
with weird measurements (leap years, inconsistent month lengths),
timezones, synchronization, agreement on units of measurement, and
it's one of the relatively few areas of ubiquitous low level computing
that can be
<a href="http://www.kottke.org/07/02/daylight-saving-change-and-computer-systems">influenced
by human politics</a>.  Fortunately many other people much smarter
than me have come to the same conclusion and have developed libraries
and specifications to deal with the suck.</p>

<p>The infantry library for us is 
<a href="http://joda-time.sourceforge.net/">Joda Time</a>, which is 
in my top five open source Java libraries ever. Partially because what it
replaces -- the datetime handling in the JDK -- is so awful. But it's
also because it's designed by people who have actually used dates and
times in the real world, and because it encourages good practices by
using immutable objects as the default and making everything
threadsafe.</p>

<p>But that only deals with dates and times, not recurrences. The
800-pound gorilla in the recurrence space is 
<a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2445.txt">RFC 2445</a>, "Internet
Calendaring and Scheduling Core Object Specification" or
"iCalendar". iCalendar deals with every aspect of scheduling I can
think of, and one of the trickiest is recurring schedules. The formal
definition for the 'RRULE' (section 4.3.10) is a page and a half, and
that doesn't even scratch the surface of what it actually means. The
description of each field fills up another two pages: more useful, but
still a little abstract for practical use.</p>

<p>For me, the best part comes later, in section 4.8.5.4. It includes
<b>six pages</b> of explicit examples, like these three:</p>

<pre>
   Every 10 days, 5 occurrences:
     DTSTART;TZID=US-Eastern:19970902T090000
     RRULE:FREQ=DAILY;INTERVAL=10;COUNT=5

<p>     ==> (1997 9:00 AM EDT)September 2,12,22;October 2,12

<p>
   The first Saturday that follows the first Sunday of the month,
    forever:

<p>     DTSTART;TZID=US-Eastern:19970913T090000
     RRULE:FREQ=MONTHLY;BYDAY=SA;BYMONTHDAY=7,8,9,10,11,12,13

<p>     ==> (1997 9:00 AM EDT)September 13;October 11
         (1997 9:00 AM EST)November 8;December 13
         (1998 9:00 AM EST)January 10;February 7;March 7
         (1998 9:00 AM EDT)April 11;May 9;June 13...
     ...

<p>
   Every 3 hours from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM on a specific day:

<p>     DTSTART;TZID=US-Eastern:19970902T090000
     RRULE:FREQ=HOURLY;INTERVAL=3;UNTIL=19970902T170000Z

<p>     ==> (September 2, 1997 EDT)09:00,12:00,15:00
</pre>

<p>When writing any type of documentation it's easy to assume your
reader consumes what you've written as carefully as you've produced it
-- from front to back, paying attention to your highlights and
thinking deeply about your assumptions and goals. But IME few people
have the inclination or luxury of reading that way -- it's, "How can I
do job X?" Examples are the best way to do this; if your library is
good enough, they'll get to the other (still important) parts
later.</p>

<p>(BTW, the library we're using for recurrences is 
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-rfc-2445/">Google's RFC 2445
implementation</a>. It's okay (it has Joda Time integration!), but IMO
needs some usability improvements. When I get a few minutes to breathe
this fall I hope to try and contribute...)</p>
