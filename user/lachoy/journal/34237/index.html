<p><p><a href="http://www.russellbeattie.com/blog/java-needs-an-overhaul">Russell</a>
seemed to kick off lots of discussion over Java's future; two of the
better ones (from my POV) are from 
<a href="http://bitworking.org/news/237/The-beginning-of-the-end">Joe Gregorio</a> 
and 
<a href="http://rc3.org/2007/08/java-is-what-it.php">Rafe Colburn</a>.</p>

<p>I've been thinking about this off and on over the weekend. And one
thing I kept coming back to (even disregarding ideas about the
technical future that my eight-month old keeps stealing from my mushy
brain) is a discussion of community and open source. Has there ever
been a development platform that died out having such a large and
diverse open source community?</p>

<p>People who are firmly in the scripting camp and have never used
Java may not realize the size and scope of the community. That may be
because there's no central repository (like CPAN), or because there
are so many large companies out there that might look to the naive to
steal the oxygen from the ecosystem.</p>

<p>But right now I think of the Java community identically to how I
think of Perl and CPAN: if there's some system I need to talk to, or
some general task I need to accomplish, there will be an open source,
business-usable library out there for it. I have bet my technical
future on this with both platforms and haven't been disappointed
yet.</p>

<p>Further, dismissing Java-the-language but grudgingly accepting
Java-the-platform makes no sense. If I'm running JRuby, or Scala, or
plain old Java, the community and the wealth of libraries is what
supports my project and team.</p>

<p>Lastly and IMO, that the official JDK is open source makes it that
much stronger. And that all editions of the platform , from mobile
phones on up, are open source is underappreciated because of the
carping that it took them too long (it sure did) and there are
apparently some leftover licensing issues (IANAL). One of the
wonderful things about open source is that people pretzel your project
in areas and ways you never anticipated, and that all those pretzels
produce benefits you can't even conceive. I think we'll see lots of
these in the next few years, particularly as mobile devices get more
powerful and people start playing with little dev kits that can run
Java.</p>

<p>I have some other thoughts on this general topic (mostly related to
the amount of risk projects/hiring are willing to assume with other
platforms), but I'm going to have to wait a bit on those. Hopefully my
eight-month old won't steal those, too.</p>
