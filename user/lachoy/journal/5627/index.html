<p>I think <a href="http://www.pop.org/">this organization</a> (despire their cool domain) used a jedi mind trick to make certain folks <a href="http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2002/06/13/unfpa/index.html">believe what they wanted</a>; I understand it works only on the weak minded or those predisposed to a certain view...</p>

<h2>Funny quote</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/pudge/">pudge</a> on 2002-06-13T22:18:06</h3>
I don't know much about the issue, and don't really care at the moment, but I found this Congressperson's quote to be funny:<br> <br> <em>"The administration is going against the will of Congress and the international community by allowing a small band of extremists to hamstring its foreign policy."</em> <br> <br>Odd, I don't recall anything in the Constitution saying the President should be bound in any way -- legally, morally, or otherwise -- to the will of Congress, let alone the "international community" (even if such wills exist).<br>

I thought that was funny too, particularly since trying to define the "will of Congress" would send anyone into the land of the nutty.

Indeed.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br> <br>Well, unless it is defined as what Congress <em>votes</em> for, such as a bill or resolution, but the President is specifically allowed to -- even encouraged to, if he feels he should -- disagree with such will of Congress.<br>

Exactly. Viewing a vote on a bill as a more abstract notion of "will" is dangerous, just like using the "will of the people" to justify what you think is right. (If you think there's a "will of the people", try getting 4+ hackers to agree on where to eat<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)
