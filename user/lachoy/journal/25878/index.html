<h1>I installed a car stereo!</h1>

<div class="span8">
<p><p>For most of a beautiful Saturday afternoon I installed a new <a
href="http://www.crutchfield.com/S-TvhTgARV6s3/cgi-bin/ProdView.asp?g=62700&I=158S2210">car
stereo</a> to the Honda. Previously it had a factory tape player +
radio and if it worked properly I would have never considered
replacing it. But the unit kept losing power sporadically, sometimes
leaving me with an entirely silent commute. Even worse was when it
would work for a couple of minutes and then drop out in the middle of
an interesting news story. Unacceptable.</p>

<p>So I figured I'd try my hand at installing one myself. Since I'm
pretty klutzy and know diddly about cars you may be forgiven for
wondering what was going through my head. My approach is similar to
software: stereo replacement is one of those things non-gearheads can
fiddle with (~skins). Maybe not as easily as oil/air filters
(~configuration options), but the fiddle-ability should be higher than
heavy-duty car work (~modify + recompile).</p>

<p>So, some impressions. I did start taking photos but stopped
as I got more frustrated. (Plus: I'm lame.) I'll post to flickr the
final results later today.</p>

<p><ul>

<p>  <li>While the instructions from Crutchfield were straightforward,
  and the wiring diagram was excellent, a couple things were really
  annoying.

<p>  <ol>

<p>    <li>They tell you to remove thick plastic tabs from the
    model-specific adapter with a utility knife. Maybe it's me but
    slicing through a 1/4" thick piece of fairly dense plastic with a
    razor blade just didn't work; the tension placed on the blade made
    me very nervous that it would slide off the plastic and right into
    me. So I got out the Dremel and roughly sliced though the tab
    (mmmm, burning plastic...), then shaved off enough with the
    utility knife to make the edge smooth.</li>

<p>    <li>They tell you you'll need a deep socket but never explain how
    it's used because you don't actually need it. (Maybe it was left
    in from an earlier draft?) This was only mildly annoying in the
    way that finding extra screws after assembly is unsettling.</li>

<p>    <li>The diagram of the screws attaching the stereo harness to the
    car was wrong (or at least really misleading), so I spent an
    awkward and painful hour trying to figure out how to get the wrong
    couple of screwbolts out. Thanks to <a
    href="http://www.installdr.com/InstallDocs/Honda/Accord.html">a
    different guide</a> I found out about two other screwbolts that
    were quite easy to remove.

<p>    <p>There's another interesting parallel with my software
    experience here: when you're implementing a new system and you're
    not familiar with its terrain you may find yourself struggling
    mightily with implementation details. With software I have a
    pretty good sense about what's reasonable and unreasonable
    struggling -- in the event of unreasonable struggling I usually
    figure I misinterpreted something or skipped important
    instructions. I don't have that sense with cars so it winds up
    taking many times as long as it should.</p></li>
  </ol>
  </li>

<p>  <li>I learned how to solder, probably incorrectly. When you're
  putting the wires from the stereo together with the wires from the
  harness adapter (the other end of which plugs into your model's
  plug) the Crutchfield instructions say that you can crimp them
  together and cap, but they strongly recommend soldering
  them. Unfortunately most of the soldering instructions on the web
  were on a smaller scale, creating a joint from a wire to a PCB. But
  I went ahead and tried anyway.

<p>  <p>I couldn't get it to work correctly -- everything tells you
  you're supposed to touch the iron to the wire and the solder to the
  wire; the solder will eventually start melting as the wire heats
  up. But it never melted! So I did what everything tells you not to
  do and touched the solder to the iron which, after some trial and
  error, made it melt nicely over the joined wires. I need to watch
  someone who knows what they're doing to know what I was doing
  wrong.</p></li>

<p>  <li>A Murphy's law I now know: If you drop a screw it will land in
  the most inconvenient place possible, such as between the floor rug
  and the car frame, and it will slide into an impossible-to-reach
  nook. So be sure and cover any gaps with cloths or sticky-side up
  tape.</li>

<p>  <li>Fortunately the wire colors of the wiring adapter matched the
  wire colors of the stereo. I triple-checked to make sure because I
  was afraid of something like a <a
  href="http://faculty.washington.edu/chudler/words.html">Stroop
  effect</a>.</li>

<p></ul>

<p>The relief I felt when first plugging in the stereo to the car's
wiring and hearing sweet static come from all four speakers:
<b>awesome</b>.</p>
