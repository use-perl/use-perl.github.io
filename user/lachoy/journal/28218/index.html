<div class="span8">
<p><p>I realize I'm behind the times learning about AJAX but I finally
have a possible reason to use it. ("Possible" because what little
webapp work I do now is as an admin front-end to a Spring-enabled
server with web and data services.)</p>

<p>Unfortunately the internal team working on webapp framework
upgrades hasn't picked an AJAX framework -- I was hoping they'd done
all the hard work already! So, time to get my learn on.</p>

<p>The basic concepts behind AJAX are a piece of cake. I get treating
the page as a DOM, async requests, callback handlers, JavaScript
prototypes and its special brand of OO, XML-or-JSON data as RPC return
value, registering special backend handlers to respond to the AJAX
requests, etc. No problem.</p>

<p>My needs for this are fairly simple:</p>

<p><ul>
  
  <li>Stick to the front-end stuff. I don't want a do-everything
  library, they're always a gigantic PITA to debug and therefore make
  me pre-emptively nervous. Plus, I don't like being tied down to a
  particular backend framework just to make the front end work,
  particularly for a front-end library that's supposed to consume
  generic messages. This also means I don't want to do anything on the
  back-end that's synced with the front-end, even if it makes my life
  easier. Creating dispatch tables to do this myself is not a
  problem.</li>
  
  <li>Typical compatibility stuff (cross-browser DOM manipulation,
  different XMLHTTPRequest implementations hidden behind abstraction,
  etc.)</li>
  
  <li>Don't dictate an XML message format. If a library makes it
  easiest if you use top-level element 'foo' and child 'bar' with your
  data, fine. But make it possible for me to use something else:
  again, one of the supposedly attractive features of this is the
  generic messaging. The server's job is to deal out data, not to
  format it to make all the different clients happy. That's the
  client's job.</li>
  
  <li>Up-to-date docs with examples. If something is really, really
  sharp then this need can be glossed over, but without the docs it
  difficult to tell if something is really sharp: nice Catch-22. We
  can break out of the Catch-22 if someone I know and respect
  recommends it: word-of-mouth almost always wins.</li>
  
</ul>

<p>So I googled around a bit and found the following resources from:</p>
  
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.ajaxian.com/">Ajaxian</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.ajaxmatters.com/r/resources">AJAX Matters</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.savagevines.com/ajax-javascript-resources/">list from Ian Sheridan</a> (who needs to change his color scheme away from grey-on-black!)</li>
</ul>

<p>I'll just list them here and (hopefully) write later about which
once I decided to use.</p>
  
<h2>Frameworks</h2>

<p><b><a href="http://dojotoolkit.org/">dojo</a></b></p>

<p>This looks genuinely interesting and it seems like the authors have
put some time into designing the libraries. After browsing around a
bit docs are fairly weak for what it does. But it seems like a
contender.</p>

<p><b><a href="http://prototype.conio.net/">prototype</a></b></p>

<p> I've heard of this before (is Rails using it?) but the admission
in the README that "Prototype is embarrassingly lacking in
documentation" is discouraging. But wait, someone seems to have <a
href="http://www.sergiopereira.com/articles/prototype.js.html">written
a separate guide</a> which is encouraging. (Possibly even <b>more</b>
encouraging than if the original author wrote it, since it means that
the concepts are getting digested by another brain before being laid
out.)</p>

<p>I really like the <tt>$()</tt> and <tt>$F</tt> shortcuts, very
smart. Why would anyone complain about these? If they're not
<a href="http://blog.moertel.com/articles/2005/12/08/cost-reducing-interfaces-should-be-the-focus">cost
reducing</a> I don't know what is.</p>

<p>...uh-oh, it looks like maybe the <tt>Ajax</tt> object wants its
XML in a particular format ('ajax-response' top-level element in
example under 'The Ajax Object'). Under that it looks arbitrary, so
maybe it's not so bad...</p>

<p>...the "Developers' Notes" reference looks useful and shows lots of
use-case oriented objects and methods. (<tt>Insertion</tt> and
<tt>.Before</tt>, <tt>.Top</tt>, <tt>.After</tt>? Neat.)</p>

<p>After reading a number of other sites (some of which I didn't
mention here), Prototype came up a lot as a dependency. This is a good
sign.</p>

<p>External Prototype docs:</p>
  
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.sergiopereira.com/articles/prototype.js.html">Developer Notes for prototype.js</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://particletree.com/features/quick-guide-to-prototype/">Quick Guide to Prototype</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://blogs.ebusiness-apps.com/jordan/pages/Prototype%20Library%20Info.htm">Overview of the Prototype Javascript Library</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://wiki.script.aculo.us/scriptaculous/show/Prototype">docs from script.aculo.us</a></li>
</ul>

<p><b><a href="http://bennolan.com/behaviour/">Behaviour</a></b></p>

<p>Not an AJAX toolkit per-se, this just allows you to register events
much more cleanly. Looks pretty simple and easy-to-use.</p>

<p><b><a href="http://script.aculo.us/">script.aculo.us</a></b></p>

<p>Silly name, but pretty sharp. Seems to confine itself solely to
front-end effects and uses Prototype for the heavy lifting.</p>

<p>Documentation at first glance looks decent, but it's in the form of
a wiki. That's not horrible but like most people I like having
everything offline and in one place.</p>

<p><b><a href="http://www.mochikit.org/">MochiKit</a></b></p>

<p>Great docs! And tests! Support for  <a href="http://openjsan.org/">JSAN</a>!</p>

<p>This looks great and seems like it could be used in favor of the
scriptaculous/Prototype combo except the set of visual effects is
tiny. Actually it's one and a pretty small one: rounded corners. Maybe
there are libraries that build on top of this?</p>

<p>The online demos are great, but it seems like an awful lot of code
to do client-side sorted tables. (That could just be my ignorance
talking though, since I don't have much experience with it.)</p>

<p>They stuck in the <tt>$()</tt> shortcut, cool.</p>

<p><b><a href="http://getahead.ltd.uk/dwr/">DWR</a></b><br />
(Direct Web Remoting)</p>

<p>Good docs, but it's tied to server-side technology. It's very
Spring-like in its approach to un/marshalling.</p>

<p><b><a href="https://swato.dev.java.net/">SWATO</a></b></p>

<p>Seems like it requires both client- and server-side components. I
appreciate that it can Spring for this, but that's still no
good. Sparse documentation.</p>

<p><b><a href="http://cpaint.booleansystems.com/">CPAINT</a></b><br />
(Cross-Platform Application Interface Toolkit)</p>

<p>Good docs, a rarity. Unfortunately, it's (a) a do-everything
framework, (b) explicit about the XML format it wants from the
backend. Not for me.</p>

<p>It also seems to want the backend to serve it HTML which it can
just put in the right place. I guess it's useful, but pretty
limited.</p>

<p><b><a href="http://taconite.sourceforge.net/">Taconite</a></b></p>

<p>More response documents as its own format, more formatting in the
response.</p>

<p><b><a href="http://sarissa.sourceforge.net/">Sarissa</a></b></p>

<p>While I like the name because I had a crush on a girl named Marissa
in high school, and it is client-side focused, this focuses on XSLT
which seems like jumping out of the frying pan and into the fire.</p>

<p><b><a href="http://openrico.org/rico/docs.page">Rico</a></b></p>

<p>Sharp looking page. Let's click on 'Documentation'...</p>

<blockquote>This page is being expanded. For now here are a few guides
and tutorials.</blockquote>

<p><b>Next!</b></p>

<p><b><a href="http://zk1.sourceforge.net/">ZK</a></b></p>

<p>WTF? This looks like it's <b>all</b> server-side, serving up
XUL. Feh. (Plus, they don't tell you the docs on the front page are
all PDFs. Annoying.)</p>

Thanx for all the references. I love it when I can outsource the hard work even without asking...
