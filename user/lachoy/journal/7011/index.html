<div class="span8">
<p><p>A few trivial and stupid things I've come across while using Windows as a desktop the last two weeks. (At a client site, no choice, etc.). This is on NT 4.0, so some of these might have been fixed. (But I'm amazingly bored right now, so whatever.)</p>

<ul>
  <li>I really miss tabbed browsing, much more than I thought I would.
  <li>Why do certain 'system' windows not have an entry in the task bar? For instance, opening up the 'Control Panel' brings up a taskbar entry, but the panel entries 'Data Sources', 'Date/Time', 'Keyboard' (among others) do not, while the 'Desktop Themes' one does. Similarly, if you accidentally double-click on a bunch of files that are selected and don't have a default file type, you'll get n 'Open With' boxes that don't have taskbar entries and will quietly hang around under all your other windows until you notice them.
   <li>The built-in shell (cmd) has strange ideas about going back and forth in your history. If I run commands, A, B, C, then up-arrow twice to re-run B, an up-arrow after I run B will bring 'A'. I think I prefer the dumb stack.
   <li>If I open up a file in IE served as text/plain (for example, 'ProcessThatData.pm') then 'save as...' it will not only bowlderize the name to 'ProcessThatData_pm.htm' but also add opening and closing XML headers to it.
   <li>I also dislike how you can't at least symlink at the root level (as a drive letter) a directory within a share.
</ul>

&gt; a file in IE served as text/plain<br> <br>and MSIE can't render text/plain documents as text/plain if they<br>appear to contain html markup<br> <br>-matt

And MS actually consciously designed that bug into it.  You see, text/plain is supposedly an <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/workshop/networking/moniker/overview/appendix_a.asp" title="microsoft.com">"ambiguous" MIME type</a microsoft.com>, meaning IE can assume it knows better than the server that's actually giving it the file.

Another one I just remembered: IE doesn't remember the last directory from which you opened an HTML file, defaulting to 'Desktop' every single time. Not even in the same freaking session!

I found another one: if a site isn't found due to misspelling, 404 error, etc., it shouldn't go in either the history or completion listings. Blech!

and if the 404 error message isn't heavy in kb, MSIE should not ignore it in favor of a "more helpful" version. I'd much rather have a 1kb page with only a link to a site map/search than the generic MSIE page not found message.<br> <br>-matt

<p>
  Mozilla runs on win, you should be able to get it installed (and it's not picky if you don't have admin rights to the box). There also is a version of IE (using the IE ActiveX control or whatever) that has tabs. Someone mentionned it here recently, a search might reveal it.
