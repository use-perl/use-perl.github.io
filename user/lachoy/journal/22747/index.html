<div class="span8">
<p><p>If you want to use a microwave ovens your task is pretty simple:
you want to heat something. The variables involved in accomplishing
your goal are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>what are you heating?</li>
  <li>how hot do you want it?</li>
</ul>

<p>That's it. Then why is nearly every microwave I've ever used so
complicated? For example, I give you the microwave at my closest work
kitchenette:</p>
  
<p align="center">
(view image: <a href="http://www.cwinters.com/images/blog/work_microwave_interface_small.jpg">front panel of microwave</a>)
<br clear="all" />
<a href="http://www.cwinters.com/images/blog/work_microwave_interface_large.jpg">(view larger image)</a>
</p>

<p>The primary problem comes from button placement. Why are 'Custom' functions at the top?  For most tasks you just need the 'start and add 30 seconds for
every press' button. And, to its credit, this microwave does have
it. Can you find it at a glance? Me neither. (It's next to the 'Stop'
button.) Problems with it:
  
<ul>
  <li>You have to lean close to the thing to read the small print on
  it. Why not just a '+0:30' without the clock or 'sec' on it?
  
  <li>The coloring doesn't indicate its purpose, so if you do hit it
  by accident you'll probably be startled by the microwave being
  activated.
</ul>  

<p>Another notable violation the 'Start' button. Except for the tough-to-find 30 second button every single use
of this microwave will involve that button. So why is it:</p>
  
<ul>
  <li>situated in the middle of the other buttons? I guess we should
  be thankful it's at least on an edge so it's easier to hit.
  <li>colored the same as the other buttons? (even though the 'Stop'
  button is marked red)</li>  
</ul>

<p>The coloring thing is what gets me angry almost as much as the placement. I could almost understand if
<b>none</b> of the buttons had coloring. But that's not true, the
'Stop' button has a red circle. So why not make every button that
makes the microwave run green? Or the 'handy' shortcut buttons up top
purple so your eye will group them together separate from the
rest. (And why are they on top anyway?)</p>

<p>A couple other minor issues:</p>
  
<ul>
  
 <li>Why are the two largest buttons 'Timer' and 'Clock' (at the
 bottom)? 'Timer' I can see because people use microwaves as timing
 devices all the time. But 'Clock'? How often do you set the thing?
 Does it really deserve that large a button? My thinking is that the
 designers figure they're related, so why not put them next to one
 another. And if they're next to one another, they <b>have</b> to be
 the same size, right?</li>
  
 <li>The food groupings are kind of odd. Besides their weird location,
 you have 'Fresh' and 'Frozen' vegetables. But different types of
 vegetables need to be cooked for different amounts of time -- cooking
 asparagus and broccoli for the same time would bring seriously
 undesirable results.
  
 <li>'Snacks'? 'Reheat'? The only one of those that really makes sense
 is 'Popcorn', but...
  
 <li>...as anyone who has worked in an office with other people will
 tell you, there's always some asshole who puts popcorn in a microwave
 and then forgets about it and lets it cook for the full 'Popcorn'
 cycle. For all microwave popcorn I've encountered this turns out to
 be 30 seconds too long, and that's sufficient to fill a surprising
 amount of space with the horrible smell of charred popcorn for about
 20 minutes. And it only takes about two and a half minutes to
 cook. So the person who walks away from the popcorn does so for what?
 To check email? To shift-reload foxnews.com again to get their talking points to the brilliant ideas
 our brainless president has barfed out this week? No, their time is
 much too valuable to sit around and wait for popcorn.
  
 <p>(You'd could argue that this isn't a microwave design problem. But
 what if they reduced the 'Popcorn' cycle by 30 or 45 seconds? Think
 of all the noses saved!)</p></li>
  
</ul>

<h2>microwave interface</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/rjbs/">rjbs</a> on 2005-01-17T03:54:30</h3>
My family's first microwave, obtained in the late 80's, had the best interface I've seen.  It had two dials and a button.  The top dial set the power from one of five or six settings.  The bottom dial set the time to cook.  I believe it went from zero to ten minutes, with marks every thirty seconds.  When you turned that dial, it immediately began cooking.  When you pushed the button, it stopped cooking and the door opened.<br> <br>Every other control I've seen has been superfluous and confusing.

<p>We had one like that too and I agree that it was great. One of the things designers often fail to remember is physical memory and how it can act as interface shortcuts. For instance, back then I knew that cooking a hot dog was 45 seconds, and that if I put the dial between the tips of my thumb and forefinger 45 seconds was about the distance for my thumb to roll to the first knuckle of my forefinger. So I didn't even have to look -- just dial and wait for the ding. (I ate a lot of hotdogs back then...)</p>

<p>That microwave also had  handle on the door which wouldn't open unless you pushed a button located about where your thumb would naturally land. And once you pushed the button with your thumb the microwave would stop cooking. Easy easy easy.</p>
