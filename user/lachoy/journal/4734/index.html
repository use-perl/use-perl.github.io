<p><p>Put out OpenInteract 1.40 this morning, to many huzzahs. (Well, one. From one of our cats.) Let me just say again that CPAN/PAUSE rock my world.</p>

<p>To test it out I finally, finally got <a href="http://www.cwinters.com/">cwinters.com</a> back online. I had to transfer data from a very old (18 months) MySQL structure into Postgres, my database of choice now. That went pretty well -- I modified the various presentations to have different base templates, copied all the photos to a particular directory, then set the page scanner to work to bring everything in. Worked like a charm, and we're back online. Ugly, but online. Some sort of photo gallery, potentially borrowed from slashcode, is likely in the near future....</p>

<p>For some reason, I woke up thinking about wikis -- insane in the wikibrain -- and how to implement a simple one (hah!) in OpenInteract using <a href="/user/chromatic/">chromatic's</a> Text::WikiFormat. I finally took a look at it and it's nice and straightforward, even for overriding and (I think) adding behavior. We'll see. Obviously, good ideas are fermented on less than four hours of sleep... (Or maybe they just <b>seem</b> like good ideas then.)</p></p>

<h2>Text::WikiFormat</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/chromatic/">chromatic</a> on 2002-05-08T02:03:50</h3>
It *should* be good for overriding and adding behavior.  That was one of my design goals.
<p>
There aren't any tests for that specifically, though, mostly because I hadn't thought of any good things to add or to override.  I'm likely to add in any suggestions you have, or even write new tests based on your ideas.</p>

Couple of things I came up with:

<ul>
  <li>Headers. I've used the TWiki and the UseMod methods and don't really have a preference:<br>
TWiki (using line start/end anchors): ^---+ text $ is h1<br>
 ^---++ text $ is h2<br>
 ^---+++ text $ is h3<br>
UseMod: = text = is h1<br>
== text == is h2<br>
=== text === is h3</li>
  <li>Interwiki links, normally Foo:WikiName. You'll need to provide a way to map to other wikis, but that's easy</li>
  <li>Other external links. The everything [command://argument] or [[command://argument]] is killer and allows for supereasy plugins. Might even want to use this instead of the previously mentioned interwiki: [meatball://BarnRaising]</li>
  <li>Be able to differentiate between link types in the extended linking semantics, particularly for email.</li>
</ul>

<p>I might come up with more ideas as I use it more, but it's a start<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>

<p>Oh yeah, I forgot. It would also be great to get a list of WikiWords from the most-recently formatted text. Handy for indexing and all...</p>
