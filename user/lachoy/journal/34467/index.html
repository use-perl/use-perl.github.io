<p>MJD has been working on his 
<a href="http://perl.plover.com/yak/flags/">red flags</a> book for a
while, and he's had an open invitation to Perl Mongers groups: he'll
speak at your group for free as long as you give him something to talk
about. This could be work you'd like to see improved, whatever</p>.

<p>I can testify that in the absence of volunteers he'll find other
work. In our case, he happened on the Class::Observable module when he
came to Pittsburgh last year. I remember walking in just as they were
handing out copies of the source code, and seeing 'Observable.pm' at
the top: my stomach plummeted.</p>

<p>Fortunately, he was extremely fair, and it was difficult to argue
with any of his choices. The only one I could raise a tiny objection
to was naming: I'd used 'update' to mirror the Java
<tt>java.util.Observable</tt> interface, and on hearing that's why I
chose it he said something like, "Oh, that makes sense." I'd also used
a set of awkwardly-named methods like "_obs_foo_bar" but that's
because I didn't want them overridden and Perl doesn't give you
private methods. (At least, not by default.)</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I had to bail during MJD's presentation -- not
because I couldn't take it anymore, but because it was early on in
Barb's pregnancy and I had a strict time limit on how long I could be
away from home. (Long story.) And because I came in late I couldn't
explain this to MJD, but I figured that Casey, Tom or Rob would have
told him I wasn't the shinking violet sort. (I did tell him later in
an email.)</p>

<p>Anyway, I figured that was the end I'd hear of it until the book
came out, and given the lead time of HOP I was comfortable with a few
years for that. Until I got an email from Rob Blackwell: "You're an
international red flag" along with a link to MJD's 
<a href="http://pic.plover.com/YAPC/Vienna/Flags.pdf">YAPC::EU
presentation</a>.</p>

<p>Ouch. Yeah, that me. But in my defense I think my overengineering
tendencies have been greatly curbed in the last few years. And the few
recent times at work I've strayed close to the overdesign line I've
actually been rewarded when a changed or new requirement came up and
it was a piece of cake to handle. We talk about "code smells" like
they're so cut-and-dried, but they're not. In everyday work you often
get to choose one way of doing things over another, and IMO it's
experience with similar choices more than anything else that dictates
which one will bear fruit, how successful your choices will be.</p>

<p>Wish I would have been there to see the whole presentation :-)</p>

I wish someone would critique my recent modules.
