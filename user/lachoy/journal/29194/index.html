<h2>Surprising?</h2>

The military and aviation communities have always gone in for Ada.<br><br>After all, they invented it.<br><br>"Ada - When you absolutely, positively, have to not kill people, or the opposite"<br>

Well, surprising to me. The military/government part was not surprising, but it was my impression, based purely on talking to other folks and hearing stuff to and fro, that Ada was a little aged and not used quite as much anymore. And for some reason I never associated it with embedded computing either, but that's just ignorance.

My favorite professor from college, Robert Dewar, used to joke about this very fact.  He worked on this project, as well as the ADA spec it was based on.  He always said he wouldn't fly in this plane since he was all too conscious of how many things could go wrong!

Ada is a great language.  If the Perl programming market dried up over night it would be my next stop.
