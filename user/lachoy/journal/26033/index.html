<p><p>(I finally got some wireless access so I can post this from a couple days ago...)</p>

<p>Pittsburgh airport was a breeze. From kissing Barb goodbye to my gate
was ~25 minutes. I was a little surprised they made me take off my
Tevas at the checkpoint, but whatever.</p>

<p>Flight was fine. For some reason I was a little nauseated and my brain
kept spinning incomplete scenarios of doom, but that sounds worse that
it was. I think that's a consenquence of getting older (at least for
me).</p>

<p>Grabbing a bus from the Newark airport to Manhattan was surprisingly
easy. The line I rode goes to Penn Station, Grand Central Station, and
the Port Authority Bus Terminal. The latter was only four or five
blocks from the hotel, nice. It took a while to get there (~1+ hours)
and we seemed to go through some interesting neighborhoods -- roads
that didn't really look like a bus should be on them with parking on
both sides -- but it was fine. Only $13 vs the $60 a taxi would
apparently have cost.</p>

<p>Walking past the army guys at the bus terminal with rifles - yow. I
guess you get used to it, but guns like that are shocking if you don't
see them in real life. You'd think that with all the violent movies
I've seen it would be different.</p>

<p>The conference sent two or three notices to us about the
<b>crazy</b> (but cool!)  elevators. Instead of hitting up-or-down and
walking on the first one that arrives, you enter your destination into
a keypad which tells you which elevator you'll use. Eventually it
arrives and knows which floors it should stop at. Seems more efficient
and has worked well so far. But are people really that dumb that they
need to get forewarning about this? I think it's more that they don't
work so well, much worse than you'd expect since they can forecast
usage better.</p>

<p>The hotel is charging $13/day for internet, bastards. Maybe they'll
have wireless at the conference but I'm not holding my breath -- it's
not a geek conference. It's one with people who don't mind sticking
their company for $13/day for something that should be free. (Update:
fortunately intel is sponsoring a "wife cafe", which is just an access
code and an area, no coffee or anything. Hooray intel!)</p>

<p>I haven't been in New York since 1987 or so, when I visited the NYU
campus to see what it was like. (I can't remember now if I applied,
got accepted and didn't go; applied, got rejected and didn't go; or
didn't apply.) Most of what I remember was Washington Square and some
guy getting $15 from me at the train station for a "prepaid" cab
ride. What a sucker I was (am).</p>

<p>Sunday evening Andrew, Lisa and their friend Jenny showed me
around. We met at Union Square which I reached by subway. (Piece of
cake, partially due to Andrew's directions and partially because
subways are all alike.)  We walked all over the place which was
great. It's something I'd do if I were by myself except I was with
people who knew their way around and had interesting stories about
places we saw along the way. Many of which started with, "N years ago
there's no way we could walk around this neighborhood" and had
somewhere in the middle, "and now it costs [some exhorbitant amount]
to live in a studio here." Eventually we went to dinner at a southern
place I cannot remember the name (Old Devil something?) but it had BBQ
tofu, great cole slaw with cilantro and excellent tangy mac and
cheese.</p>

<p>One of the things we talked about Andrew and Jenny's project
management book which I'm really looking forward to. I've been
not-so-diligently reviewing chapters and what I saw looked great --
very practical, not pie-in-the-sky.</p>

<p>More soon, including photos...</p>
