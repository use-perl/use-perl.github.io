One of the first questions we get when we tell people we're vegetarians is, "What do you do on Thanksgiving?"** Actually, Thanksgiving is one of the easiest times to be a vegetarian. I've never been to a Thanksgiving dinner that didn't have at nearly half a dozen side-dishes -- a couple type of potatoes, the inevitable green bean casserole (sometimes two), one squash dish, some sort of cruciferous vegetable (cauliflower, broccoli, brussels sprouts), cranberries. With some quick gravy to bind everything together you're great. (It's much more difficult at some chain restaurants that put bacon on everything...)
</p>

<p>
But what you don't do is get a Tofurkey. (I talked about how ridiculous <a href="http://www.cwinters.com/news/display/699">a while ago</a>.) It's just unnecessary.
</p>

<p>BTW, if you've got people coming over I highly recommend this super-easy ginger ale recipe, printed in a recent <a href="http://www.vegetariantimes.com/">party propaganda instrument</a>:</p>
  
<pre>
2 cups water
2 cups light brown sugar
1/2 pound fresh ginger, cut into 1/4" thick 'coins'
1 cinnamon stick
pinch of cayenne pepper
sparkling water

<p>1. Bring sugar, ginger, cinnamon and water to a boil in 
large saucepan. Simmer 5 minutes, remove from heat
and mix in cayenne pepper. Let cool

<p>2. Strain liquid into small pitcher; cover and 
refrigerate until ready to use

<p>3. To serve: mix 1 part ginger syrup to 3 parts 
sparkling water.
</pre>

<p>
** And then sometimes they start interrogating us about whether we're "pure" vegetarians and start in about how we're hypocrites if we're not, and maybe they even say something like "With all due respect, those leather shoes you're wearing..."

<h2>Go Italian</h2>

I'm lucky to have an Italian mother-in-law who usually adds something like lasagna or stuffed shells to the table. I love Italian food, so it's great for me and other people usually end up digging in too.



<h2>vegetarian and leather?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/gizmo_mathboy/">gizmo_mathboy</a> on 2005-11-13T03:47:33</h3>
When I ask about someone's vegetarianism I ask the "type": vegan, lacto-ovo, etc.<br><br>I would make the generalization that if you're a vegan there's a strong chance that you are also animal rights oriented.<br><br>But I generally think vegetarians choose it for dietary reasons.

You're absolutely right. But a lot of people don't even know there are different types and see any modification of 'pure' vegetarianism as hypocrisy.
