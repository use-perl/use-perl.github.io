<p><p>Note to self: when <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/docs/api/java/util/Observable.html">copying an API</a> you should not rely solely on memory. One of the nice things about creating a new module is that you can put out a <a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?dist=Class-Observable-0.02">new release</a> in short order without ticking anyone off :-)</p>

<p>Saw <b>Mulholland Drive</b> yesterday. Both my wife and I were mostly baffled when it ended, and after discussing it for a while we decided on a couple of theories then started watching it again to prove them. Unfortunately we both fell asleep before the end. The perils of growing old...</p>

<p>Also saw <b>Ali</b>. Parts of it were fantastic -- I like Michael Mann's style a great deal -- but overall I thought it fell short. Ironically, my wife liked it more than I did -- she had fairly low expectations. But I've read quite a bit more about him than she has, so it's kind of like reading the book before seeing the movie.</p>

<p>That said, I think representing a person as complex as Ali, and the whirlwind around him and what he represented, is a nearly an impossible task to do in a 120-150 minute movie. There were parts of the film that I thought were obvious remnants of scenes that had previously been surrounded by other material, and relationships that were largely unexplained, etc. Oh well.</p></p>
