<p><p>IIRC, going to use.perl.org/comments.pl used to show you a list of the last ~20 comments. I found this very useful to keep up with active discussions and find out which were becoming active.</p>

<p>This feature (or was it?) isn't there anymore. Is there an equivalent from another URL?</p></p>

<h2>Yes, I think so</h2>

My personal use.perl SlashBox has <a href="http://use.perl.org/search.pl?tid=&amp;query=&amp;author=&amp;op=comments" title="perl.org">comments</a perl.org> in it, which I think matches what you had in purpose.

How do you do that ?

Preferences -&gt; Homepage -&gt; Scroll down and type stuff inside the "User Space" box, at the bottom.<br><br>Oh, and you also have to tick the User Space box to make it show up.

<p>Exactly!

</p><p>  My "UserSpace", created when the Comments.pl stopped working, has the following --

</p><p> <a href="/search.pl?tid=&amp;query=&amp;author=&amp;op=comments" title="perl.org">Comments</a perl.org>
<br> <a href="/search.pl?tid=&amp;query=&amp;op=journals" title="perl.org">Entries</a perl.org>
<br> <a href="/journal.pl?op=edit" title="perl.org">Write</a perl.org> </p> <blockquote> <div><tt>&lt;p&gt; &lt;a href="/search.pl?tid=&amp;amp;query=&amp;amp;author=&amp;amp;op=comments"&gt;Comments&lt;/a&gt;<br>&lt;br<nobr>&gt;<wbr></nobr>   &lt;a href="/search.pl?tid=&amp;amp;query=&amp;amp;op=journals"&gt;Entries&lt;/a&gt;<br>&lt;br&gt; &lt;a href="/journal.pl?op=edit"&gt;Write&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</tt></div> </blockquote>which I think I reverse-engineered from the search page.

Wait a minute...<br><br>Two things:<br><br>First: yours is just like mine, even with the same order...<br><br>Secondly: mine stopped working... I mean, there was something with use.perl that made my userspace be truncated and I lost the third line and couldn't put it back... does this mean the problem has now been solved? (because I was told it would be) (and yes, I'm too lazy to give it a try)

<i>First: yours is just like mine, even with the same order...</i> <p>Amusing!

</p><p>Dunno. The conversion to "modern" HTML whacked a lot of things, but most of them seem better now. (Still some issues with layout on narrow windows?) I've got 3 lines now, all three display and work.</p>

There's a byte limit on the field, maybe you went over?

I didn't went over, the byte limit came under<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br><br>You see, everything was working fine, and suddenly... part of what I had there disappeared<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)
