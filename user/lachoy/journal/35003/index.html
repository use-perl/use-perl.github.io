<p>
<p>There's a nice response from Bob on my thoughts on small vs large
teams. He raises a bunch of good points, go read 'em.</p>

<p>Re-reading <a href="http://www.cwinters.com/news/3606">what I
wrote</a>, it sounds a bit like I'm a large team guy. People I work
with know better: I'm quite the opposite. The largest development team
I've ever worked on is what I'm on now -- seven developers, four on
the server-side (including me) and three for the application on our
wearable device (although we get to steal them sometimes). And one of
the server-side folks came on four weeks ago.</p>

<p>And even at one point when we had the potential of bringing other
folks temporarily on the team for our last three months before product
intro, I resisted. Primarily because software isn't a generic thing
you're building, it only makes sense in a context. And our containx
(nursing homes) isn't something you can pickup overnight. So I saw
that maybe we could get lots of code produced, but we'd be cleaning it
up for the life of the product.</>

<p>Anyway, what I wrote was primarily a response what I saw as some
naive thinking. When someone says that a team of three people can do
anything, I hear "I've never put a system into production." (Yes, it's
hugely unfair.)</p>

<p>But reaction pieces aren't affirmative, they don't really tell you
what a person thinks, just what he doesn't think. So here's what I
think: small teams kick ass. Products designed and built initially by
a small team tend to have a greater cohesion than those built by
larger groups, and I think this is an overlooked benefit for
maintenance programmers.</p>

<p>But small teams can by risky, too. Developers tend not to talk
about risk because we think we can steamroll over it by heroics and
cleverness. You have to be much more careful about hiring -- bad
apples spoil any team, but they're immediately fatal to a small
team. And it's even riskier if you need to move quickly -- it takes
time to find the right people.</p>

<p>Of course, the alternative is risky as well. Hiring any warm body
may seem productive at first ("we hit our hiring numbers!"), but it
won't buy you success. And adding warm bodies to a project in trouble
is a sure way to tank it.</p>

<p>A number of the strengths of small teams have a double-edge. For
instance: on a small team it's easier to trust everyone, to know that
they're going to do their job so you don't need to cover for them. But
when something unexpected comes up there are fewer people to deal with
it. So people tend to work longer hours. Which isn't so bad for a
short time, but that has a bad habit of going longer than
anticipated. Not so good for people with families.</p>

<p>Compared to this, choices among programming languages or even
frameworks seem secondary. Or maybe teams choose these things to fit
the folks working there? (If they're able.)</p>
