<h2>Proposal</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/pudge/">pudge</a> on 2005-02-15T21:34:18</h3>
I proposed on Valentine's Day, 1994, after a sporting event, in private.  Not during it.<br> <br>Cam Neely scored two goals for the Bruins, including the game-winner over the Kings with less than a minute to play.<br> <br>She said yes.<br>

<p>I can only imagine the shock.  Cam Neely is a <em>he</em>!</p>

Or so you thought.

I'm impressed by your ability to remember details of a non-playoff hockey game you saw 11 years ago, even if it was on your engagement day. (Especially because you've probably seen hundreds of games in the meantime.)

I didn't see the Bruins much, not live.  It was the only game I saw in a several-years span.  So that helps too.
