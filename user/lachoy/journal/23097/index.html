<p><p>Stuff I've done recently that made me feel like an idiot:

<p><ul>
  <li>I ordered <a href="http://www.citrussoftware.com/screentool.php">Screentool</a> so I can do screen/video captures for OpenInteract demos/advocacy. (It's only $12, vs. $80 for Snapz Pro which all the cool Ruby kids <a href="http://wiki.rubyonrails.com/rails/show/RailsAcademy">use</a>). So I got the confirmation email from the service they use but didn't see a registration key. So I waited a day or two and finally emailed them. It turned out the key was in the email but I just had to scroll down. Stupid! (My mail window really looked like the email was complete...)</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.vocollect.com/">Work</a> strongly encourages volunteer/charity work. And one of the things people do every year is a 150 mile bike ride (over two days) up to Erie. I went to the intro meeting and got all excited about getting in shape, riding my bike again, springtime, etc. But when I got home and told Barb she said, "Doesn't that <a href="http://www.goaskalice.columbia.edu/2428.html">hurt your guys</a>?" Stupid! I didn't even think about that, bad husband. So the bike ride will have to wait until next year, unless conditions change in the next month or so...</li>

Vnc2swf is a screen recording tool for X-Window (X11), Windows and Mac OS Desktop. Vnc2swf captures live motion of a screen through VNC protocol and converts it a Macromedia Flash(TM) movie (.swf).<br> <br>Sample movies are on the site:<br> <br>http://www.unixuser.org/user/euske/vnc2swf/<br>



<h2>Screen Capture</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/phillup/">phillup</a> on 2005-02-09T20:04:02</h3>
I have found that SnapZ really bogs down my machine when trying to do the movie thing.<br> <br>Otherwise, I absolutely love it.<br> <br>Anyways... what I do when I want to do a movie is hook the composite out to my PC's video capture card. Then I do whatever I want on the laptop...<br> <br>When I'm done, I edit the file and add voiceover, etc...<br> <br>Since the capture is done on a seperate machine, there is not a problem with the application bogging down.
