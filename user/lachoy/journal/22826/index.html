<p><a
href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Algorithm-Dependency/">Algorithm::Dependency</a>
is a nifty little distribution to help you manage
dependencies. ("Little" is not derogatory; just the opposite.) It
provides just enough functionality so that you can glue it to your
application with fairly little fuss. Here's how I'm planning to use it
to support an OpenInteract2 feature improvement.

<p>In <a
href="http://jira.openinteract.org/browse/OIN-115">OIN-115</a> we have
the improvement 'Break setup into individual tasks'.[1] The goal of
this imrovement is to allow other technologies easily put themselves
into the OI2 lifecycle. With the improvement processes we don't know
about beforehand can get initialized at server startup, and by a
separate process, rather than managing this state themselves. So if
you want to establish a connection to a message queueing system when
the server starts up you can just create a setup task to do it and the
rest of your code can just assume it's there.</p>

<p>Previously all the setup routines were in one big class, <a
href="http://search.cpan.org/user/cwinters/OpenInteract-1.99_05/lib/OpenInteract2/Setup.pm">OpenInteract2::Setup</a>. This
was tightly coupled to <a
href="http://search.cpan.org/user/cwinters/OpenInteract-1.99_05/lib/OpenInteract2/Context.pm">OpenInteract2::Context</a>
such that the context was responsible for knowing what methods to
call, the order to call them, and what methods to skip in certain
circumstances. (Sometimes you want to create a Context without it
being fully-formed, such as when you're creating a new website,
install SQL structures, or other bootstrapping actions.) Obviously
this is no good -- not only are we limiting what's called, but we
can't discover new behaviors at runtime to integrate these unknown
technologies. (A <a
href="http://jira.openinteract.org/browse/OIN-39">small change</a> in
1.99_05 allows you to use a subclass of OpenInteract2::Setup and
define pre/post methods, but that's a bandaid fix.)</p>

<p>After some grunt work I ported each of the setup procedures from
methods in a class to each in their own class. As a result we had a
bunch of subclasses classes under <tt>OpenInteract2::Setup</tt>. Each
class had to implement <tt>get_name()</tt> (to return its unique name)
and <tt>execute()</tt> (to do its work). It could implement
<tt>get_dependencies()</tt> (to declare what it should run after) and
some lifecycle stuff (setup/teardown, basically). Additionally, each
subclass is responsible for registering itself with the parent so the
parent knows how to find them. (There's a simple example of this
below.)</p>

<p>So how can we allow OI2 to find all these setup classes at runtime
but still maintain an order to executing them? Well, we already had
code for the first part in <a
href="http://search.cpan.org/user/cwinters/OpenInteract-1.99_05/lib/OpenInteract2/Manage.pm">OpenInteract2::Manage</a>,
which walks over @INC, finds all subclasses and require()s them. Once
brought in each subclass registers itself with the parent factory with
a name for us humans to reference the action by. We don't need to know
'OpenInteract2::Manage::Website::Create', just 'create_website'. (This
is made simple by <a
href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Class-Factory/">Class::Factory</a>). So
that got abstracted out to a utility method for common usage and it
works fine.</p>

<p>Now onto the ordering part (and the actual point of this
post). Previously the caller of the setup controlled not only the
order but also what procedures should not be run if others weren't
run. (See the <tt>setup()</tt> method under <a
href="http://search.cpan.org/src/CWINTERS/OpenInteract-1.99_05/lib/OpenInteract2/Context.pm">OpenInteract2::Context</a>
for that nasty bit.) But if we're bringing in these procedures
dynamically we can no longer proscribe the order. So we need a
dependency tree built from the data -- name + dependencies -- made available by each class.</p>

<p>I've written dependency trees before, but that's more
infrastructure than I wanted and more code that's not aimed at the
core purpose that can break. After hunting around CPAN a bit I found
<a
href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Algorithm-Dependency/">Algorithm::Dependency</a>. It
has a few dependencies itself (har har) but was a snap to install on
my Powerbook. (Even for Win32 it just required a few PPDs to be
built.)</p>

<p>So here's the procedure for what I wanted:</p>
<ol>
  <li>find all setup tasks on the system
  <li>ask each task for its name and dependency names
  <li>pass the task names + associated dependency names to an object
  <li>ask the object the order in which I should execute the tasks
</ol>

<p>In A::D-speak the last part translates to:</p>
  
<pre>
my $dep = Algorithm::Dependency->new(
    source => Some::Storage::Class->new,
);
unless ( $dep ) {
    oi_error "Failed to create setup dependency object: cannot start server"
}
my $all_ordered_setup_tasks = $dep->schedule_all();
</pre>
  
<p>Pretty straightforward, even with the 'Some::Storage::Class' in
there. That 'source' winds up highlighting A::D's pragmatic
assumptions from your application. It deals with IDs (or names), not
objects. So as long as your dependencies can be referenced by a string
(and EVERYTHING in Perl can), then you're good to go.</p>

<p>But the above only takes care of item 4 from our list, with a some
of item 3 behind the scenes as well. So how do we tell A::D about our
dependencies? You can use a static file (and A::D includes a class for
reading it in), but we need something dynamic -- remember, we want to
discover these classes at runtime. Fortunately the storage class was
very straightforward; here it is with some logging removed:</p>
  
<pre>
package OpenInteract2::Setup::DependencySource;
# ...a few imports...
   
sub _load_item_list {
    my ( $self ) = @_;
    my @ad_items = ();
    my @all_actions = OpenInteract2::Setup->list_actions;
    foreach my $setup_name ( @all_actions ) {
        my $setup_item = OpenInteract2::Setup->new( $setup_name );
        next unless ( $setup_item );
        my @dep_names = $setup_item->get_dependencies;
        my $dep_item = Algorithm::Dependency::Item->new( $setup_name, @dep_names );
        unless ( $dep_item ) {
            oi_error "Failed to create dependency item from '$setup_name'";
        }
        push @ad_items, $dep_item;
    }
    return \@ad_items;
}
</pre>
  
<p>So with that little class and a reference to the base setup action
our A::D code becomes:</p>
  
<pre>
my $dep = Algorithm::Dependency->new(
    source   => OpenInteract2::Setup::DependencySource->new(),
    selected => [ $DEFAULT_DEPENDENCY ],
 );
my $all_items = $dep->schedule_all;
</pre>
  
<p>(The <tt>$DEFAULT_DEPENDENCY</tt> is simply reading the server
configuration; everything else depends on it and we execute that
separately to deal with some bootstrapping issues.)</p>

<p>Easy enough. However, if you run this you won't get what you
expect. A::D's documentation tells you that it doesn't return ordered
dependencies. (I'm not sure what use unordered dependencies are, but
ok.) It's a simple fix:</p>
  
<pre>
my $dep = <font class="red">Algorithm::Dependency::Ordered</font>->new(
</pre>
  
<p>Now for the slightly hard part -- what happens when you want to
remove something from the list? This functionality is not in A::D but
it was fairly simple to add. The pseudocode is just:</p>
  
<pre>
foreach item you want to remove
    - ask the dependency object for that item's children
    - remove the item
    - remove the item's children
</pre>
  
<p>I coded this method up (called 'without()'), added docs and tests
and sent it to the author Adam Kennedy. We'll see if it gets
added. (IME patches with docs and tests are treated much better
than code-only.) In the meantime, now it's easy to do something like
this:</p>
  
<pre>
   # don't run 'read repository' or any of its dependencies
   OpenInteract2::Setup->run_all_actions( $context, 'read repository' );
</pre>
  
<p>Since 'read packages' depends on 'read repository', it doesn't get
run. Neither does 'read action table' or 'read spops config' since
they depend on 'read packages', and on down the line. Even better: we
don't have to explicitly account for and ignore other setup tasks
added at runtime -- for instance, if <tt>Class::DBI</tt> needed to do
some startup work you could create a class for it like this:</p>
  
<pre>
package OpenInteract2::Setup::ClassDBI;
 
use strict;
use base qw( OpenInteract2::Setup );
 
sub get_name         { return 'initialize Class::DBI' }
sub get_dependencies { return ( 'read packages' ) }
sub execute {
    my ( $self, $ctx ) = @_;
    # ... do my actual work here ...
}
 
OpenInteract2::Setup->register_factory_type( get_name() => __PACKAGE__ );
</pre>
  
<p>Since it depends on 'read packages', it too gets skipped when we
execute the above <tt>run_all_actions()</tt> method.</p>

<p>[1] That issue is a great example of something driven by
implementation already half-done rather than a use case beforehand. I
think it points out a problem with knowing a system really well: need
and implementation become interchangeable in your head. Oh well.</p>
