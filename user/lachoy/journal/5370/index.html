<p><p>In happier news, I finally made some of the dishes from my Indian vegetarian cooking class. The first was a ricotta cheese (substituting admirably for paneer) and peas. I fortified it with some chickpeas as well. The second was a simple cucumber raita. Both turned out very well, although the ricotta was a little spicier than I'd planned.</p>

<p>Part of the preparation for this was getting spices, and for this I went to one of the local Indian grocery stores and stocked up on the staples: seeds of coriander, cumin, black mustard, fenugreek, cardamom, etc. Plus some tamarind pulp and frozen coconut, which I'm told lasts forever. But what was shocking was how <b>cheap</b> everything was. Maybe it's just crappy <a href="http://www.gianteagle.com/">Pittsburgh grocery stores</a>, but herbs (like cilantro/coriander) are difficult to find and expensive. And spices: two bucks got me a big bag of cumin seeds, versus five bucks for a tiny glass container.</p>

<p>Tonight's recipes: an eggplant chutney and some mung bean pancakes.</p></p>

<h2>They're staples</h2>

I think its simply the fact that they are staples of Indian cooking, so the Indian grocer can't get away with high prices.<br> <br>Another example is agar, which is a substance derived from seaweed that is quite similar to gelatin, and can be used to make vegetarian pudding/jello/mousse/whatever.<br> <br>If you go to a Western store that has it (say, a coop like that one on the East Side in Pittsburgh), it'll cost you a _lot_ of money.<br> <br>But in Asia, they make a number of jello-like desserts, and they don't use gelatin, they use agar.  So go to an Asian grocer and agar is really cheap.
