<p>Weird thing happened last night: after  a quick trip to the grocery I unlocked the passenger's side door, since it was raining and all. (How gallant!) But I couldn't get my key out -- it refused to budge! Fortunately, we had my wife's keys so we could make it home. I separated it from the key ring and we drove home with a key sticking out of the door. A call to AAA (evil automobile lobbyists that they are) and a fella came out who apparently pulled with more force that we did since the <b>entire lock</b> popped out. So we're going to have to make a trip to the dealer... ack.</p>

<p>The prevailing theory on why this happened is that someone was futzing around with the lock, maybe when we were at <a href="http://www.dcnr.state.pa.us/stateparks/parks/mmill.htm">McConnell's Mill State Park</a> yesterday taking some photos. Investigations will continue, perpetrators will be brought to justice.</p></p>

If you find out, please, journal it.</p>

Finally got this fixed. Something in the lock got out of whack, so they had to replace the lock cylinder in that door. Good as new. (They might as well have said "We're procapcerting the floozle" for all I know about cars...)
