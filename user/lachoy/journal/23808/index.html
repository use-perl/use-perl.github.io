<p>When it came out I remember reading around that <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0370263/">Alien vs Predator</a> was one of the Worst. Movies. Ever. And yeah, the title is just stupid ("AVP"?), the story and setup were contrived and that acting was mediocre at best. But it's a comic book! You're really there to see aliens duke it out, just like you saw Jurassic Park to see the lawyer get snatched up in the jaws of the Tyrannosaurus. So maybe it was the cellar-dwelling expectations, but it was actually pretty fun. That <a href="http://imdb.com/name/nm0005125/">Sanaa Lathan</a> is so easy on the eyes didn't hurt either...

I liked it too. It would have been better I think if they had stuck closer to the book version.



<h2>Me too</h2>

I quite liked it as well, "good" and "fun" come to mind, although not "great".<br> <br>I think intentionally not watching the trailer helped a lot, particularly in regards to the plot. The plot was weak, but not terrible, but I imagine the trailer ruined the plot for most people.
