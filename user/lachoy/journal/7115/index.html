<p>I just found out (via <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/koschei/">koschei's userinfo</a>) about this 'amigos' page that has recent journal entries from all your friends in a single place. (<a href="/my/amigos/">Try it!</a>) I'm kicking myself for not having seen this before. Does everyone else know about this and I'm arriving late to the party? Is there a page on use.perl that lists similar shortcuts? </p>

I'd been wondering what the opposite of "fan" was, but does this mean that Jesus freaks are hated by Jesus?

there's <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/wickline/journal/6994" title="perl.org">this</a perl.org> link too<br> <br>-matt

That's the beauty of that one: it <b>could</b> be the handiest thing of all, but you'd never know it!

Amigos is not linked to anywhere because it's broken.  It doesn't use the right journal "theme" (it was coded to use something separate, for reasons passing my understanding) and I never got around to fixing it; and as I dislike how it looks, it's not linked to.<br> <br>As to the Misc. thing, I don't see it linked to anywhere; wickline, perhaps you are using text (light) mode?  I don't use light mode, so it is quite possible there are problems with it that I am unaware of.

Sounds like broken light mode though.  It's only supposed to appear if you have miscellaneous options available, which are then put up dynamically on the page.  I will fix at some point.  Sorry.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)  Thanks.

Another useful fact: if you're in text mode, you get a lot of extra links down at the bottom of the page. Such as amigos, 'Misc', et al.<br>
