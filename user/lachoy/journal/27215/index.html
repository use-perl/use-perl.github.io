<p>This is how those science fiction/horror stories always start, isn't it? Maybe it's like <b>The Stand</b> and those six people happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time -- truck stop/rest area/tollbooth when an escapee of a secret biological research lab bursts in and covers them in lab-created viruses. Or maybe these six hikers happened on the decaying carcass of a bear where a newly mutated virus is hanging out. Or something.</p>

<p>(It turned out to be a respiratory illness in a nursing home, but still. Brrrr.)</p>

<h2>still a bit scary</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jmm/">jmm</a> on 2005-10-17T17:29:50</h3>
It was Legionare's Disease.  But there was a slightly scary development - while it was originally thought that the outbreak occurred solely within the nursing home, there were two additional deaths to people living nearby who had no obvious contact with the nursing home.  However, the occurrances all happened at around the same time and no additional instances are known, so it is not an ongoing issue.



<h2>Better when it was unknown....</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ziggy/">ziggy</a> on 2005-10-19T01:56:05</h3>
I'd rather have the "unknown respiratory illness" than an outbreak of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legionellosis" title="wikipedia.org">legionellosis</a wikipedia.org>.  Maybe because I remember the Bellvue Stratford as being an old, disused hulk of a building for a couple of decades before it finally reopened.  (Still gives me goosebumps every time I walk in.)  Maybe because remediating a legionella infestation is such a bitch because the bacteria is so damn resiliant to pretty much everything.
