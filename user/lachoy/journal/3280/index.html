<p><p>I'm not very good at thinking on my feet, one of those people who thinks of something to say 30 - 1800 seconds later. So I was very pleased with myself with a recent telemarketer.</p>

<p>She started out: "Hi, I'm with Mumble Morf, a marketing research company and we're doing a survey on marketing and the internet. First, can you tell me if you or any member of your immediate family works for a marketing agency or media outlet?"</p>

<p>I blurted out, "Yes, my wife works for a local TV station." (She is a teacher.)</p>

<p>"Thank you, have a good evening."</p>

<p>Yes!</p></p>

<h2>What's wrong with ...</h2>

"Sorry, I'm not interested."<br> <br>That's what I usually say.  Of course, I got this cool service on my phone line that actually ends up blocking 99.9% of telemarketers anyway so I haven't had to deal with them for the last 1-2 years.

Lately I've been using "Please add me to your 'do not call' list".  That ends the call just as quickly, and offers the slight chance that they'll obey the law and not call you again for at least a year.<br> <br>Of course, none of these approaches work when the phone rings repeatedly but there's no one there because the autodialer connected when no telemarketer was ready to come on the line, which seems to be happening more and more.  We need more laws, and better enforcement.<br> <br>I think offering bounties would help.  Encourage the wretches who couldn't get any job better then telemarketing (surely no one actually chooses to do it) to turn in their employers for big bucks.

Try this on for size next time someone calls you about phone service during dinner:
<blockquote><div>
<i>Hi, I'm &lt;mumble&gt; calling from AT&amp;T.  Are you happy with your current long distance provider?</i>
<p>
Actually, I'm deaf, so I don't really use the telephone.
</p><p>
<i>I'm sorry.  Did you just say you're deaf?</i>
</p><p>
Yes, I did.  [<b>click</b>]</p>
</div></blockquote>
Kinda cruel, but only to the telemarketers.  If you get one with a clue, they'll be laughing all the way to the end of their shift.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)
