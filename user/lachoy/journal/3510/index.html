<p><p>Went through a rough draft of taxes last night. I really screwed the pooch on this one. Yet another reason why I'll never work for myself again -- these "little details" just get ignored or pushed off again and again until they become ulcerbombs. Oh well, it's just money, albeit money that we don't have...</p>

<p>A few other crappy things going on right now as well, and I have a sneaking suspicion that the allergy fairy is going to visit soon. And all the girl scout cookies are gone!</p>

<p>I picked up some new non-tennis shoes yesterday. It's actually very difficult to find men's non-leather walking shoes -- the only option I've found so far is getting fairly cheap ones (~$20) and going through them quickly. There are places that do <a href="http://www.pangeaveg.com/">online ordering</a>, but my feet are only slightly off so I'm reluctant to try that. Maybe next time we're down in Washington.... Bitch bitch bitch.</p></p>

<h2>I feel your pain</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ajtaylor/">ajtaylor</a> on 2002-03-14T15:50:07</h3>
I was laid off the last 3 months of last year, so I was living (barely) on unemployment &amp; whatever freelance work I could get. Of course, I didn't have taxes taken out and did quite a bit of freelance work last year,so now I owe much more than I have to pay.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-( I guess I'll make installment payments &amp; just accept the penalties/interest.
<p>
Ugh, taxes...</p>



<h2>The IRS is as bad as Enron</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/hfb/">hfb</a> on 2002-03-14T16:15:07</h3>
<p>I get taxed at 45%+ and Jarkko, who isn't even a bloody citizen, gets taxed at a similar rate since<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.fi and<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.us are chummy in the taxation department. Adding the two sums together is a breathtaking amount...and what do we get for it? bombs and precious little else.</p>



<h2>Get an accountant</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/autarch/">autarch</a> on 2002-03-19T06:11:56</h3>
I can't repeat that enough, get an accountant.  I got one last year for 2000, when I was mostly employed as a 1099 worker and didn't pay taxes.<br> <br>Before going to the accountant I had done my own taxes in Taxcut Pro and gotten one number.  I had an accountant do it and he came up with a figure $1,000 lower!  That was well worth the $140 I paid the guy.<br> <br>I'm going back this year.
