<p><p>The other day I needed to capture part of my Mac screen for something or other. After looking up the chord (I always forget it: Cmd-Shift-3!) I hit it and the very satisfying snapshot sound played. [1] And as normal I saw the image captured to a file ('Picture 1') on my desktop ...and then I saw another one, labeled 'Picture 2', with the contents of my other monitor. Each graphic had its own resolution too. Neat!</p>

<p>When I first started this entry it was about how, except for that obscure key combo, OS X makes this easy compared to XP. But then I realized that I rarely do full-screen captures in XP, it's typically a single window (Alt-PrintScreen), and I don't think I've ever done a full-screen with multiple monitors.</p>

<p>So I snapped the full-screen: no clicky sound, but for my limited purposes I think I like XP's version better. Even though it captures to the clipboard instead of straight to a file. Instead of splitting the desktop image into two separate files it merges them into one. Since my monitor and laptop don't have the same resolution (1280x1024 x 1400x1050) there's a little black bar at the bottom of the monitor to compensate for the difference.</p>

<p>There's likely a way to do this on OS X too -- in fact, I'd be surprised if there isn't. But this was a case where XP surprised me, and that doesn't happen very often.</p>

<p>[1] I hope whoever created that sound gets some cash, since it seems to be the same one that plays on my phone whenever I take a picture.</p>

cmd-shift-4. Hold ctrl down and drag from the corner you want to the opposite corner.<br><br>When you let go, the camera noise happens, and your image is in the clipboard.<br><br>Don't hold control if you don't want it in the clipboard.<br><br>(I think the Mac is more flexible, but YMMV).

I think the OS X is more flexible too -- AFAIK, XP only has Ctrl/Alt-PrintScreen to capture fullscreen or a single window, but being able to capture a region means you can grab background areas in one shot instead of grabbing everything then cropping. But my OP is a "common case A is easier on Foo than Bar" and still worth mentioning.

I prefer the OSX way to do it as well.<br><br>I've been using these boxes for longer than I care to admit, and if I've needed to take a dozen screen shots, it's a lot.  But I've never forgotten Cmd-Shift-3 and Cmd-Shift-4, because it's <i>always</i> been that way, or at least it has been for about the last 21 years since the 128K was released.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)<br><br>Yet there's a nicely labeled "Print Scrn" button on PC/Win* keyboards, but I can never remember the magic incantation to use it.  Go figure.
