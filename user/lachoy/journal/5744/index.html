<p><p>Still poking along with Swing. The ORA book was kind of right and kind of not -- I wound up downloading the code examples and adding a <tt>setVisible(true)</tt> here and there until things displayed ok.</p>

<p>However, I'm now trying to follow along with some of the tuturials Sun has online. For some reason I keep forgetting these exist. And when I remember I'm always pleasantly surprised by their quality and depth, as well as the sheer number of tutorials that are freely available there.</p>

<p>As a result, Swing is starting to click but not quite there yet. A lot of it is forgetting my crippled as feeble HTML monkey.</p>

<p>I'm also trying think of my <a href="http://joelonsoftware.com/articles/StrategyLetterV.html">complements</a>  so I can figure out how to commoditize them. I'm thinking Nasoya, XEmacs and unsweetened iced tea for starters, but I'm sure there are more.</p></p>

<p>Good points, but every time the author mentions the GPL, he says something about it being against capitalism.  It's not, and never has been.  Eric Raymond, the free-market libertarian, was using the GPL a long time ago.  Free-software/open-source folks aren't commies.  At least, not all of us.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<p>In fact, I like the GPL.  I'm a laissez-faire capitalist.  I believe in strong property rights and weak intellectual property rights (because IP is sort of an artificially created construct, an artifact of government control).</p>

I should have been clearer -- it's an interesting article, but imposing a monolithic view of why people (or companies) create opensource/free software will either be too general to mean anything or wrong. However, it is IMO leading down the right path to a productive way for companies to view opensource: as a business decision to further the central goals and strategies -- it's just another tool. The dichotomy of opensource/capitalist is BS in the real world.
