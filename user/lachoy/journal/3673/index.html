<p>Still thinking out loud here...</p>

<p>Currently we generate about 500+ classes and interfaces, and 600+ deployment descriptors. The amount of generated information is only going to go up as we add more functionality to the system.</p>

<p>The tricky part is how to integrate the generated code and the custom code, particularly in a staticly-typed language like Java. This issue will only get worse as we add more classes and relationships. It's possible to just have custom functionality in a separate file that gets pulled in when the class gets generated, and the user doesn't know the difference. But that's difficult to test and for non-trivial methods, difficult to write.</p>

<p>I feel obliged to mention here that, of course, little of this would be a problem in Perl. But when you're working in a language you need to think in its idioms and patterns.</p>

<p>If I wanted to I could just have all relationship methods return a <tt>Object</tt>, but then you have to do a cast every time you call something. I consider excessive casts to be one of those "code smells" the XP folks talk about -- it's fine for the Collections API (Lists, Iterators, Maps, etc.) because that's one of the trade-offs (at least until generics/templates come), but not for classes you create unless you have a darned good reason.</p>

<p>In addition to this, I'd like to enable clients to have a simple, unified interface to all functionality a "business object" supports, and enable this interface to support both generated and non-generated code. (Without the code generation wrinkly, this is generically known as a "Business Delegate" in the relevant pattern literature.) Again, with multiple inheritance this wouldn't be an issue: just have the delegate inherit from as many custom and generated classes as necessary.</p>

<p>So instead we need a pseudo-proxy interface, where the delegate gets a request and hands it off to the right place for processing. Not too difficult, except I'm still bitten by the typed return values -- even though it's acting as a proxy the delegate still needs to know the return values of various methods, even if they're generated.</p>

<p>And all the time I'm thinking 'simplify, simplify'... More later, when things are working.</p></p>

<p>Mark-Jason Dominus once said something quite true, to the effect that patterns (in the <cite>Design Patterns</cite> sense, maybe not the sense you mean) are just programs that the <em>programmer</em> has to run in his head, because the language is too stupid to do it for him.</p>
