<p><p>I'm about to consider building my next Linux 
box for my use at home. I'm sure I'm not ulike 
a lot of folks here at this site in that I have 
very demanding specs for a "home machine." </p>
<p>My current machine was underpowered the day 
I built it, but I didn't realize that at the 
time.  After all, who is going to need more than
512Mb of memory for a home machine? But then I 
installed Apache, Tomcat, mod_perl, Postgres, 
MySQL and a bunch of other stuff.  Since this 
machine is my incoming MX I installed SpamAssassin
and portsentry and a bunch of other IDS 
packages.</p>
<p>Then I noticed my disk light stayed lit 
pretty much all the time and the system spent 
a lot of time swapping and paging. Gee.. I guess
I need more memory this time around. </p>
<p>So... which motherboard? Well, the two 
Intel motherboards that I bought to build my 
son and daughter's machines didn't work out 
so well.  They ran hot and my son's machine 
crapped out altogether. My ASUS motherboard 
seemed to work just find.  Guess I'll stick 
with that. And more memory...</p>
<p>Who would have thunk 80Gb of disk wouldn't 
be enough... now my disk is 85% full all the 
time and damifyknowwhy. Oh.. and why do I 
only have one spindle.  Maybe I should look 
at SATA this time and set up a RAID. </p>
<p>But wait, RAID5 is notorious for the 
"write penalty" you pay.  Hmmm.. wonder how 
bad that really is? More testing.. yeah that's 
it.. more testing...</p>

If you are going the Intel route, make sure you get a Core2Duo.<br><br>The write penalty for raid5 is minimal if you have a good hardware raid controller.  I don't think I would do raid5 for a home system though.  Maybe software raid1.<br><br>You definitely want sata though.
