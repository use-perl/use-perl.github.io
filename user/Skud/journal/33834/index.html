Pet topic du jour... the suckiness of installing Perl web apps, as compared to apps written in certain other languages starting with P.
</p>
<p>
Last night I posted <a href="http://infotrope.net/blog/2007/07/17/cpan-and-the-installability-crisis/">this blog post</a> about CPAN and installability.  I've also been making some generalised <a href="http://infotrope.net/wiki/installing_perl_web_apps">notes</a>  on the subject.
</p>
<p>
Any thoughts/comments/suggestions/etc would be welcome, if you've got 'em.

<h2>big problem with rpm/dpkg and maybe msi????</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ddick/">ddick</a> on 2007-07-18T04:26:58</h3>
they all assume that you have root privileges on the host.  So not the case for most people installing an app on a web host.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/me thinks its time to create a build script for this case.  I wonder if windows users can install an msi without root privileges.  somehow i suspect so.

<p>You need Administrator privileges for installing most apps on Windows, even though many could be created not to need them in theory. But no one makes such installers in practice.</p>

Yes, very true.  Someone over on my blog was all "duh, just use dpkg/rpm/whatever!" and just not getting it.



<h2>Re:big problem with rpm/dpkg and maybe msi????</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ddick/">ddick</a> on 2007-07-19T00:09:39</h3>
agreed, but even in theory, rpm/dpkg require a ton of "disable-everything" options because a fundamental part of their operation assumes a root administrator who relys on the existing package database to determine dependencies AND to update it with the current installed package details.  Whereas, for good/evil, i don't think msi has that issue.  There is no concept of a dependency database in msi.

Thew new <a href="http://www.movabletype.com/mt4/" title="movabletype.com">Movable Type</a movabletype.com> beta tries to do a PHP-easy style installer.  They had a screen cast (can't find it now) and it looked interesting.  They totally skimmed over the dependencies issue though.

I'll have to check that out.  IIRC from last time I used MT, it was the hairy sort of code that probably *doesn't* use non-core CPAN modules<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-/  I'd like to think that'd changed but I'm not confident.

<h2>krang</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Qiang/">Qiang</a> on 2007-07-18T17:38:08</h3>
as you mentioned in the end of your blog, developers need a good installation system to bundle up the app. i think krang ( <a href="http://krang.sf.net/" title="sf.net">http://krang.sf.net/</a sf.net> ) can help. it has a neat build system that compile modules for you. you do it on different OS then tar and distribute them to the users.

Thanks! I'll look into it.
