<p>To Melbourne.pm last night, along with Josh H from work (ex Pdx.pm).  Gave a talk on test modules -- basically just a quick overview of some of what's out there on CPAN -- which I think went pretty well.  It got that eyes-lighting-up response from a few people anyway, and someone at the pub namechecked Lessig wrt my presentation style, so excuse me while I preen briefly (though I thought I was doing the Takahashi method (<a href="http://presentationzen.blogs.com/presentationzen/2005/09/living_large_ta.html>), sorta, only with code blocks).<br">http://presentationzen.blogs.com/presentationzen/2005/09/living_large_ta.html>), sorta, only with code blocks).<br</a><br/>Must clean up my CPAN modules.  It's a mess.</p>

Unless you have a short word like 'perl', you can't get the maximum size in Roman script on the screen you can get in Chinese, Japanese and Korean. You could if overhead screens were like movie theater screens, ie longer, rather than taller.<br><br>I guess you could fill the screen if you made each letter thinner, but that doesn't look so good.<br><br>The maximum effect is possible in Chinese, I think, because it is the ultimate in compression of meaning into sound. Each word (actually, morpheme) is one syllable long and represented by one character.<br><br>Japanese, like English, has multi-syllable morphemes. Even though text translated from English into Japanese is usually shorter, text translated from Japanese into Chinese occupies even less space usually.<br><br>(Perhaps it also has something to do with hyphenization.)<br><br>I was trying to find a powerful 4-letter slide by gugod. This one is from audrey's delivery of takesako's ppencode presentation.<br><br><a href="http://labs.cybozu.co.jp/blog/takesako/images/osdc_tw_takahashi.jpg" title="cybozu.co.jp">http://labs.cybozu.co.jp/blog/takesako/images/osdc_tw_takahashi.jpg</a cybozu.co.jp>

Yeah, in my case I found myself trying to write Test::MockObject::Extends (in one pathological case) and it was a bit lame.  Worked better for words like "SKIP" that have something closer to the same aspect ratio.
