A couple of days ago I installed Plagger (<a href="http://plagger.org">http://plagger.org</a>).
</p>
<p>
Wait, back up.
</p>
<p>
A couple of weeks ago I installed Catalyst.  I sat on the #catalyst IRC channel while doing it, and commented in passing that it required half of CPAN.  Someone then said, "yes, and plagger requires the other half," reminding me that I'd been meaning to check plagger out ever since audreyt(?) had mentioned it at a Sydney.pm meeting a year ago.
</p>
<p>
So I downloaded plagger.  And it downloaded half of CPAN.  I mean really.
</p>
<p>
And while that happened, I went googling for plagger docs, and found that almost all of them are in Japanese, and I felt rather daunted by the whole prospect (not least because CPAN.pm and Module::Build don't much like working in my home directory on my hosted server, and I keep having to manually install shit and it was taking forever) and then somewhere in my googlings I came across <URL:http://feedblendr.com> which does about 80% of what I wanted anyway.
</p>
<p>
So my rather small achievement for yesterday -- but I'm proud of it anyway -- was setting up a doohickey that picks up my posts from all the various places I hang out (here, LJ, del.icio.us, LibraryThing, and so on), merges them, and combines them on my homepage to make it easier for stalkers to follow me.
</p>
<p>
You can see it at <a href="http://infotrope.net">http://infotrope.net</a>.
</p>
<p>
I used XML::RSS::Parser instead of the XML::LibXML that I've previously used for such tasks, and I have to say that XML::RSS::Parser is very slightly nicer.  No less lines of code, really, but apparently it behaves better if your feed is somewhat broken.  And when you're mashing up a heap of feeds, something's sure to be broken sometime.
</p>
<p>
And that, boys and girls, is why I've finally started posting on my use.perl journal.  I'm user #28 on this system and I'd never done it before, but now I've got my shit together to feed it out to my own webpage, it feels more useful.

And Jifty makes you install the third half of cpan.
