<p><P>A huge thank you to those who posted here and sent private email. I now have a much better working mutt, and I can send emails too. I'm not quite sure how I managed the latter, but I'm not complaining ;) There are a few things I still need to fix, but most of that is just the learning curve. I discovered a nice utility, <a href="http://muttrcbuilder.org/cgi-bin/index.pl">the .muttrc builder</a>, that has a bit of a guide to what you can do within the config file. <a href="http://www.tmtm.com/nothing/">Tony</a> also sent me a script to give me an idea how to better list my mailboxes with Perl, which will prove useful to use for learning how to extend the capabilities of mutt. I would still like to be able to use a GUI client when I'm on the desktop, but I don't mind waiting now to figure that out.
<P>
I have now caught up with three people who have sent me ideas and/or patches for three of my distributions. Now I just need to find the time to implement them :)</p>

<p>How do you like mutt so far?<nobr> <wbr></nobr><tt>:-)</tt> </p>

<p>Btw, I have some suggestions to try in <a href="http://plasmasturm.org/log/344/" title="plasmasturm.org">Email for procrastinators</a plasmasturm.org>. Particularly, using threaded view as the default and saving sent mail to the inbox is a combination that everyone should at least try once.</p>

<p>I'm getting there. I still have a few tricks to learn, but it's not all bad. I've got used to the drag-n-drop of a GUI, so I find I'm having to think a bit more.
</p><p>I do have threading set up as default, but I find I miss new entries in some mailboxes. I imagine I should be able to flip between threaded and date order, but I haven't got around to looking that up.
</p><p>The next hurdle I need to address (pun intended) is the address book. I have a lot of people I mail, some have more than one address, and it would be so much easier for me to type a shortcut and for mutt to complete the To: line for me. I've seen a few web pages on this, but haven't yet had the time to actually do anything. It's on my TODO list<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<p>You can change sort order by hitting <tt>[o]</tt>. (mutt will prompt you with the available orders and their shortcuts, so you don&#8217;t need to memorise those.)</p>

<p>The addressbook is handled by the <code>alias</code> command:</p>

<p> <code>alias <b>ap</b> Aristotle Pagaltzis &lt;pagaltzis@gmx.de&gt;</code> </p>

<p>With that you could send me mail by saying it&#8217;s <i>To: ap</i>. Don&#8217;t miss that tab completion for aliases is available on all email address prompts in mutt!</p>

<p>These commands are usually kept in a file customarily called <code>aliases</code>. You point mutt towards it using <code>set alias_file=/path/to/aliases</code>. If you hit <tt>[a]</tt>, mutt will extract the From: address from the mail you&#8217;re viewing (or pointing at), and will append the appropriate command to the aliases file after prompting you for the details. Note however that it won&#8217;t actually <em>read</em> this file unless you also have <code>source<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/path/to/aliases</code> in your<nobr> <wbr></nobr><code>.muttrc</code> &#8211; so the aliases file is effectively a secondary<nobr> <wbr></nobr><code>.muttrc</code> as far as mutt is concerned.</p>

<p>This custom of keeping the two separate files developed because the <code>alias</code> command format is understood by more mailers than just mutt, and they can all use the same file if you do it this way. But since I don&#8217;t use anything but mutt, I gave up on this separation. Instead I just keep my aliases at the bottom of my<nobr> <wbr></nobr><code>.muttrc</code>. That allows me to keep aliases for mailing list addresses and their corresponding <code>subscribe</code> commands next to each other, neatly solving the headache it would otherwise be to keep the aliases in synch with distant <code>subscribe</code> commands.</p>

<p>Superb. Thanks for all that, it's going to prove very useful. I think I owe you much beer<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
</p><p>Ever thought about writing a book?</p>

<p>A book? Heh, not really; certainly not about mutt. You think?</p>

<p>I did go back to collect my comments from your journal entries, though. I want to tidy them up, flesh out the result, and eventually post it as an intro/tutorial on plasmasturm.</p>

<p>And thanks for the beer offer.<nobr> <wbr></nobr><tt>:-)</tt> </p>
