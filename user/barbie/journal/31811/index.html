<p><p>It appears that I should have read the mailouts for the <a href="http://london.pm.org/lpw/">London Perl Workshop</a> a little more careful. 
<p>There ISN'T a general get together of attendees and London.pm'ers after the event as I had thought we I initially read the list and such, but an organised BBC Backstage Party event for various London geeks, which you have to sign up for. The Party list of 400 is full and the waiting list is over 200, so I guess I have no chance of getting in.
<p>Seeing as the trains leave London too early for me to go to the IQ gig, I had thought I would be able to spend an evening with the guys from London.pm. I only get to see them a few times each year, so thought I could make the most of it. However, it seems like they're all signed up for the bash now!
<p>Looks like I'll be heading home early then :(</p>

It actually sounds like rather a lot of us are in that boat...so many that muttley has mentioned on the l.pm list that an alternate social plan is in the works. Stay and hang out. I'm sure that there's massive evil to be had by a roving band of mongers on a saturday night.

<p>Cool. I won't be on my own drinking in some corner of <a href="http://www.fluidfoundation.com/venueDetails.asp?venue_id=2559" title="fluidfoundation.com">a pub</a fluidfoundation.com> off Oxford Street then<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)
</p><p>I've just emailed muttley, so hopefully he can point us in the direction of a decent hostelry for the evening. At least somewhere that accommodate the overspill from The Party<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

All fixed now - we're heading to the <a href="http://london.pm.org/pipermail/lpw-2006-announce/2006-December/000001.html" title="pm.org">Grafton Arms</a pm.org> nearby.
