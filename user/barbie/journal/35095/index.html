<p><p>There are days when I really hate having to leave someone else to sort things out. On Tuesday my mail started playing up. It would seem that EasySpace still haven't released the DNS for missbarbell.co.uk. I've now been onto my new providers, simply.com, who are looking into it. It would seem the name servers are pointing the MX records to the EasySpace servers, which are now starting to drop the mail or more accurately ignore all requests from DNS to acknowledge the domain, even though they're quite happy to accept regular A record requests! As a solution I thought I would use the grango.org domain as that has also been set up with the same forwarding. Alas it would seem that the EasySpace mail server is also rejecting all requests to anything at grango.org. I never thought DNS was this hard. It took me a day after reading the O'Reilly book to grasp how it all fits together, maybe EasySpace should club together and buy themselves a copy. It's getting really frustrating having to deal with them now and I can only hope that once I finally get everything moved to simply.com I will be free of EasySpace for good. If you've been sending me mail in the last week and not heard anything, sorry it probably didn't get through :( Fingers crossed I can get things sorted today.
<p>
<b>Update:</b> Simply.com have now regained the name servers, so missbarbell.co.uk is working again. However, EasySpace are now claiming that MessageLabs don't know how to configure mail servers! Kind of says it all really doesn't it ;)</p>
