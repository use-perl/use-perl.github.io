<p>Since I haven't really spoken about it this year, some may be forgiven for thinking that Birmingham have not got any further with their bid. And they'd be pretty much right.
<P>
Steve said to me a while ago, that although he came up with the idea, if it hadn't have been for me organising everyone, our attempts at even bidding to hold a YAPC::Europe Perl Conference would never have got off the ground. He's probably right, as while everyone else is eager to help, its been down to me to hold it altogether, and prod people when they need reminding. Fortunately no-ones prods me, even though I probably the one that needs it!
<P>
So I've started finishing off a proposal document that I meant to finish back in January. As February was rather hectic for me, I haven't gotten around to organise very much bid related, although I did finish some of the movie slides for Steve. I have another set that I've been promising to finish for the last few weeks.
<P>
However, this weekend sees us doing a large amount of filming. Hopefully. And getting down to what else needs to be done. Having planned so far in advance, we now have the advantage that much of the groundwork is paved. We have lots of ideas that are now only waiting the go ahead, having got  all the brainstorming out of the way. We already have interested sponsors, even though we haven't even won the bid yet!
<P>
The only hard work at the moment is for JJ to get the Javascript search working for offline Perldoc (the online version has proved so popular, JJ was quite relieve to see perl.org help out), Me to get the proposal finished, the presentation finished and the website jammed full of content, and for Steve to get OpenGuides up and running, then film and edit the movie. Not much then :)</p>
