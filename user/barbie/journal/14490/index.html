<p>Birmingham.pm had another technical meeting last night. Everyone seemed to enjoy the talks, there was certainly a lot of variety. We had a crowd in from Gloucester this time around, and they seemed to enjoy it so much they're thinking of coming again. Great stuff :)
<P>
I'll have to wait til the weekend to upload my talk about the YAPC::Europe::2003 conference, as it featured several extracts from MJDs talks. Not wishing to take anything away from his livelihood I need to remove everything bar my notes first. Although the glob image I'd like to keep, 'cause that was cool.
<P>
Martin Lee did a great talk about mail headers, and how to abuse them. Including a live demonstration of how to find and use Open Relays and Open Proxies.
<P>
Steve prepared his "talk that I knocked up on the train earlier" a little more fully this time. He actually wrote a document rather than the pen and paper that is his usual medium. He's getting better and quite proud of it too. Steve gave an insight into how to use 'tie'.
<P>
Steve also pondered about the Birmingham.pm submission for YAPC::Europe::2006. I have no doubt he's serious, but he wants to make a movie submission. Not your average iMac/digicam type movie, a proper movie. He has a plan and will probably have a script finished before too long. If it does come off, it'll be a wonderful piece of art, never mind a conference submission. I don't want to give anything away but he has a plan to remake a very well known film in and around Birmingham, so that the panel get see what we're planning, instead of reading it. It'll be alot of fun doing it, even if we don't get accepted.
<P>
The more Steve talks about it, the more I realise this is likely to be a reality. I'm getting nervous now. The stress, the strain .... and I hate being in front of an audience!</p>

<h2>Oooh, making a movie?</h2>

Do you need crew?  I've been a sound recordist in the past, and I know plenty of people who might be up for helping out if you need 'em.

I have an ex-colleague who is a <a href="http://www.deadgood.co.uk/" title="deadgood.co.uk">filmmaker</a deadgood.co.uk> too. Well known for low-budget movies.
<p>
Seeing as I'm also a lighting engineer, it might be fun to have a Perl crew behind the camera though. I'll put in a good word.</p>

Remember, I said that *I've been* a sound recordist though - I'm not any more, cos I started going deaf, and a sound recordist with less than perfect hearing is about a useful as a chocolate crash-helmet.  But I can help with getting other people.  And I've done catering for film crews too - which is perhaps even more important than all the crew who get credits<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

<p>Couldn't agree more.
</p><p>I think Steve's idea was to have a bit of fun first and foremost, so getting a perfect result wouldn't be high on the list. It's sounds like the film may turn out like one of those classic b-movies, that go on to become cult legends. We've still got 2 years to get it together yet, so plenty of time to fine craft a masterpiece.</p>
