<div class="span8">
<p>For a while this has been at the back of my mind. I like <A HREF="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Test-MockObject/lib/Test/MockObject.pm">Test::MockObject</A>, but setting it up for mocking the DBI can be a bit long winded sometimes. I like what <A HREF="http://search.cpan.org/dist/HTTP-Recorder/lib/HTTP/Recorder.pm">HTTP::Recorder</A> does, and <A HREF="http://search.cpan.org/dist/DBI/lib/DBI/Profile.pm">DBI::Profile</A> is half way to where I want to get to.
<P>
I want a module that can do two things; 
<P>
<OL>
<LI>to be able to implement what DBI::Profile does, in terms of recording the SQL query and storing to a file, but in addition stores the result set that is returned by the DB, and can append to the file if requested to. Reading the docs, I can't see whether or how DBI::Profile can do this. 
<LI>to be able to translate that data file into a format that can be quickly plugged into a Test::MockObject backend, an as yet unwritten Test::MockObject::DBI module.
</OL>
<P>
The aim would be to run a test suite, which outputs a file with all the necessary information passing between the application and the database, which can then be munged into a format which can replace the database using Test::MockObject.
<P>
The problem I've encountered so far is that, DBI::Profile only records the SQL queries being sent, and it recreates the profile file for each invocation rather than appends data. However, using this as a starting point, there should be no reason that I can't implement something similar. I can't find anything that looks like it can do what I want on CPAN (or <A HREF="http://cpan.uwinnipeg.ca/htdocs/faqs/cpan-search.html?request=search">Randy Kobes' site</A>), although that may just be me not asking the right question. Note that I'm not after <A HREF="http://search.cpan.org/dist/DBD-Mock/lib/DBD/Mock.pm">DBD::Mock</A>, as I'm not testing the database calls, just that the munging of the result set is as expected.
<P>
So has anyone else thought of something like this? Can DBI::Profile do this? Is there some other module that already does this, or something similar? Is anyone working on a soon to be released distribution that does this? I did wonder whether, like HTTP::Recorder uses HTTP::Proxy, whether I could use <A HREF="http://search.cpan.org/dist/DBI/lib/DBI/ProxyServer.pm">DBI::ProxyServer</A>, but that looks to be far too much effort for what I want.
<P>
I'm a big advocate of using Test::MockObject instead of trashing someones database. So I thought making life a little easier for anyone who wants to do the same, but can't face writing all the data files for the test suite, would be a good thing.
<P>
In other news Mark Stosberg released another version of <A HREF="http://search.cpan.org/dist/CGI-Uploader/lib/CGI/Uploader.pm">CGI::Uploader</A>. I have been meaning to finish off the Test::MockObject style testing for him for several months. Having DBI::Recorder would make that so much easier ;)</p>

<h2>can plug some of this into DBD::Mock</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/lachoy/">lachoy</a> on 2004-08-17T21:39:35</h3>
<p>For your second item above, you can tell DBD::Mock to return results for either the nth SQL statement or for the statement matching the string x. So I don't think it would be too difficult to seed the database handle with the results from a given file -- something like a phrasebook with attached results. There aren't any hooks for creating such a file though.

</p><p>(Note that I'm no longer maintaining this module -- as of yesterday <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/stevan/" title="cpan.org">Stevan Little</a cpan.org> has graciously taken it over at my request.)</p>

..find the tuits. I, for one, would find such a module immensely usefull.<br>
My tuit supply has completely dried out (why does the boss expect me to do actual work?), otherwise I would have tried to do something like it myself, but I would be happy to help in any way I can.

Well I'm surprised no-one has tried it before. I'm on holiday next week, so will try and grab some time to investigate DBI::Profile further, and see if there are additional hooks I can use to get at the data. I may look at DBD::Mock for the end result, as this would require less work on my part, and already works<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
