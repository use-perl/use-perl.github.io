<p><p>Back in July 2000, Mike Bissett and I went to OSCON in Monterey. While there we attended a BOF about Perl Monger groups. When we got back, we had a look around and discovered the nearest PM group to Brum was a now defunct group based in Stafford. So that August we applied to run <a href="http://birmingham.pm.org">Birmingham Perl Mongers</a>.</p>
<p>We held our first meeting in The Hogshead in the city centre, with Mike, myself and Mike's girlfriend. Humble beginnings, but we have since grown to a regular(ish) crowd of about 10 (more on a good day). We now hold regular technical meetings, as well as the traditional social meetings. We've had guest speakers and visitors from foreign parts (including Milton Keynes!), all of whom have been very welcome to eat, drink and chat with us.</p>
<p>Today, on the <b>9th September 2009</b>, we will be celebrating our <b>9th birthday</b>. For the geeks that's 09 on 09/09/09. We didn't plan it honest, and in fact I only noticed it when checking the date for the next meeting after last month's :)</p>
<p>If you're in or near Brum tonight and want to help us celebrate, please <a href="http://birmingham.pm.org/meet/next">feel free to drop by</a>, we'll likely be there all night ;). We'll be at <a href="http://www.jdwetherspoon.co.uk/pubs/pub-details.php?PubNumber=5609">The Dragon Inn</a> on <a href="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=B5%204TD">Hurst Street</a> (about 5mins walk from New Street station) from about 5.30pm onwards. Hope to see you there if you can make it.</p></p>
