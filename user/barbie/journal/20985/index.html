<div class="span8">
<p>I will be going on the Perl Whirl next month, and have been catching up with all the mail sent on the list while I was at Belfast. I have been a little disappointed by the war of words regarding the assumption that nobody should have a problem with wearing a monkey suit (or a tuxedo if you're from the states) for the evening dinner. Randal, Gloria Wall, Karen Pauley and others have helped to calm my worries of being an outsider, but I find it awkward that some expect everyone to jump at the chance to "dress up".
<P>
I for one do not feel comfortable in a suit. While I'm happy to dress smartly (and generally do whatever the circumstance), I really dislike having to wear a suit. I REALLY dislike having to wear a suit to any sort of "fancy" dinner occasion, as I don't like being false (among other reasons). Unfortunately, I would rather people get to know me as I am, and not by some notion that I can be clean and smart in fancy dress. It just feels fake.
<P>
The Perl Whirl is a "geek" cruise. A chance to learn some cool stuff and meet some great people. I don't see it as a chance to show off how "sharp" someone can look. For the record I don't go to MessageLabs Christmas Dinners for exactly the same reason. EVERY other conference I have been on has never expected me to dress up for dinner, and I think its a shame this one does. By the looks of things several others are of the same opinion that we would rather have a liquid lunch than have to wear suits.
<P>
I guess its an American thing to always want to wear fancy dress. Certainly from films it appears to be indoctrinated from High School. Over here in the UK, there is a much higher reluctance to dress in dinner suits for several reasons. A few of which are masonic, draconian and class societies, more likely to drum up images of the Colonial British Empire. They aren't always pleasant images. For others the idea of dressing up feels like siding with the enemy, such as marketing and sales folk (;)), presenting a false front, and thus never getting to know the real people. I'd rather meet the real people on the cruise and enjoy their company, than be asked to prented to be something I'm not.
<P>
I've suggested to <a href='http://use.perl.org/user/davorg/journal/'>Dave</a> that we form the Geek Heretics for two nights, to carry on the tradition of <a href='http://london.pm.org/about/faq.html?#heretics'>London Heretics</a>.
<P>
(I just hope they serve a good stout on board, otherwise it's going to be very expensive to match it with spirits)</p>

One of the reasons I never went, I don't play dress up (unless I want to).

</p><p>Organize a slob's buffet or something.  No suits allowed.</p>

It grates on me that I can't dress normally for work, having to wear "smart" shirt, "smart" trousers, and ridiculous little shoes, instead of my normal more practical, more comfortable clothes.  However, I can put up with this level of fancy dress because at least I'm getting paid for it.  As I said at the interview when they mentioned this to me, "I'll turn up in a pink tutu if you pay me enough".

<p>I prefer to think of it as a sociological study of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ritual" title="wikipedia.org">ritual</a wikipedia.org> known as 'evening dinner.' Particpating in different cultures and all that...</p>

<blockquote><div> <em>I for one do not feel comfortable in a suit.</em> </div></blockquote>
<p>I've tried that excuse (along with "It's just not me") on my wife. Now I'm sticking with "Ok, but not more than once or twice a year."</p>
<blockquote><div><em>While I'm happy to dress smartly...</em></div></blockquote> 
<p>While I, on the other hand, am a study in
<a href="http://www.bbcamerica.com/genre/home_living/what_not_to_wear/what_not_to_wear.jsp" title="bbcamerica.com">what not to wear</a bbcamerica.com>.
For me, dressing smartly involves shorts and a t-shirt without holes (or jeans and a plaid shirt if it's cold, but then it's never cold in California). At
the office.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.oO(hmm, so much for the holes requirement for today). Though I know my wife would prefer it if I came home everyday in a suit...</p>
