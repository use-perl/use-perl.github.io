<p><B>Tuesday</B>. At 8am we arrived in Katakolon, Greece. Several of us had 
booked an excursion to the ancient ruins of Olympia. It was quite something to
see, and I would recommend it as a spot to go and visit if you have never been.
The whirl started again in the afternoon for me with Marty's talk on 'Writing 
Better Perl'. Soon after it begins, Randal fell asleep. Thankfully not because 
of Marty, but due the heavy night last night. Randal did perk up to question 
whether $#+ and $#- would ever not be equal. Marty then got all excited and 
took great delight in proving that they could be different. Its always the 
little things ;) It was a shame that Dave Cross' 'Idiomatic Perl' was on at the
same time, as the two talks do compliment each other very well. After a short 
break the evening session began. The first hour was taken up by a sales pitch 
by an IBM sales person. Maybe someone found it useful, I started to fall 
asleep. Thankfully Marty was up next to do his Kangoogo piece. If you saw it 
in Paris last year, you know what it was. The difference here was that Larry
Wall was in the audience :) Robert then went on to do a short CVS Tutorial, 
which I elected to skip to prepare for dinner ... sorry Robert. Tonight was
the first formal night. Despite not having a suit, I thought I'd give the black
jeans and smart dark grey shirt a try. Not a flicker from the staff.
<P>
<B>Wednesday</B>. Another early dock, this time in Izmir. I discovered on returning
to work, that the wife of one my coworkers is from Izmir, and was there at the
time we docked too! Today was a lengthy stopover, so that we could take an
excursion to Ephesus, the site of the Temple of Artemis. It was an awesome
place and again well worth a visit. I ended up taking about 180 photos of the
ruins alone. As the trip back was at least an hour I took some time to have a
rest. After all I'd missed breakfast. For the afternoon I attended Casey's
'Building Web Applications with Perl (Part 1)'. I think it proved to be the
most popular of the Perl talks, and was full of great hints and tips. Casey
even managed to explain Class::DBI properly to me and suggested a great Perl
module in the guise of SQL::Translator. I never have to use Visio again :) The
evening talk was by Randal explaining the benefits of mod_perl ... at breakneck
speed. It was basically a 90 minute talk condensed into 60 minutes. Some good
pointers and ideas, and a good quick introduction to mod_perl. Dinner tonight
had an Italian theme, not quite sure what all the napkin swigging was all
about, but I've always liked Dean Martin singing 'That's Amore!'. More card
games (Fluxx & 6 Nimmt), baileys and cocktails followed.
<P>
<B>Thursday</B>. Despite arriving in Istanbul at 8am, due to another late 
night (it was all Karen's fault ;)), today we had a lie in. 7 of us arranged
to meet at 10am, with the intention of heading in to Istanbul for a wander. 
I'm not sure what we were aiming for when we started walking, but after walking
through the kebab district, we had definitely started to get hungry. We found a
great restaurant, and ended up with a 4 course meal. After another bit of 
walking and we eventually found the Grand Bazaar. The place is huge inside and 
I was completely taken aback by the place. Robert managed to find a shop 
selling rugs and decided he need to buy one. The rug seller was obviously good,
as he managed to get Robert to buy two. I picked up a hat for DanDan, which he
loved when I got back. Finally we headed back to the boat. Karen was supposed
to be studying all day, but we later discovered that Anna had persuaded her to 
come a take a quick trip to the city. The evening session featured a humorous 
talk by Marty called 'GnuGuerrilla', which although more about taking over a 
Windows network, did fill me with ideas for something we could do for a much 
more serious task here at MessageLabs. This was then followed by Robert talking
about 'Managing Your Own Open Source Project'. This was something of interest 
for me, as this is something I'm hoping to do in the future. By listening to 
someone who already has done it and notice some of the pitfalls was extremely 
useful. The talk could actual change Open Source to online and still be 
relevant, as there are some commercial projects that could benefit from what 
was discussed. On arriving for dinner we discovered Neil had decided to mix 
things up. Unfortunately for him, Casey and myself sat with Marty, Karen and 
Dave before he had a chance to move us. Still we did get to chat with some new
people too. After dinner, while sitting by the disco, Karen and Casey were 
trying to persuade each other and the rest of us to go in and dance. With 
reluctance we did go in. But as you would expect from a bunch of geeks, the 
first thing we do is sit in the dark and order more drinks. The music was 
dreadful and dancefloor was not exactly packed. However, one of the geeks, 
Chris, who unfortunately wasn't the best dancer, was having a great time 
cutting a rug on the floor. He did try and get Casey up, but he was having
none of it, choosing to use Karen as a shield from any further advances.
Eventually Karen having failed herself to get myself or Casey to dance, took
another new friend, Ted, out on the floor. Though Ted's eye was on another 
young lady. Unfortunately, he failed to notice she was with her parents, and 
got a very curt no when he asked her for a dance. Poor lad. They eventually 
kicked us out of the disco, not that there was much incentive to stay, and 
headed for bed.

<h2>Timezones!</h2>

On top of the usual drain of a geekcruise for me (from which I generally need a week to recover after it's over), I had also crossed 8 timezones by flying and airporting for 20 hours straight a mere three days before.  It finally caught up with me.
<p>
I now have a much greater respect for anyone who has to deal with people halfway around the world by physically jumping there.  Yeow.  How do they <i>do</i> it?</p>

Alas I can only claim a 1 timezone jump, but I've been shattered for the past few days. I think that has more to do with the fun and drink though<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

<h2>What's a Kangoogo?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jplindstrom/">jplindstrom</a> on 2004-10-21T14:09:18</h3>
Kangoogo doesn't Google.<br> <br>So what is it?

From japanese it translates as a language that is made from a mixture of others. The english translation is creole, although this is typically associated with the language spoken from around Louisiana.
<blockquote><div> <i>

</i> </div></blockquote>
English is a creole language, as is Perl. The fact that there are references to japanese in the apocolyses and the style of Perl 6 follows a japanese language structure in places, is what Marty's talk picks up on.
