<p>I have to wonder what is happening about YAPC Europe this year. Registration was supposed to open on March 1st 2003, a month later still nothing. The YAPC::Europe mailing list is virtually dead at the moment, and the website hasn't been updated since January. Seeing as the conference is less than 4 months away it would be reassuring to see some activity.
<P>
If I remember tonight, I'll be sending an appropriate email to see what is going on. Even if there is nothing to report it's still useful to know things are still on-going. However, if there has been nothing to report for 2 months, then I will be extremely concerned.
<P>
Last year the Munich.pm guys were very good at keeping a running commentary about what was happening. The majority of the time I was just happy to know things were happening, but it was also nice to be able to offer advice and ideas on occasion.
<P>
Perhaps this year, knowledge of the conference is on a need to know basis, which to my mind would be a bit sad.
<P>
My flight is booked now, so I'll be extremely agrieved if I have to cancel now.</p>
