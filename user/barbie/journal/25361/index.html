<p>After a mammoth journey that saw me go from BHX via FRA to <a href='http://www.connollyco.com/discography/rush/moving.html'>YYZ</a> in around 12 hours, I finally touch Canadian soil just around the time of rush[1] hour! After waiting for nearly an hour for the bus, I realised why it was late once I saw the main road into the city. Thankfully the hotel was only the 3rd stop, so after a whistle-stop tour of the city centre I got the chance to lie down. 
<P>
The bad news was that my mobile can't connect to a local service and the hotel broadband wasn't working. Unfortunately by the time I figured that it was the hotel's problem the business centre guys had gone home :( Thankfully an engineer has just turned up and got me online again ... yeah :)
<P>
This morning saw me taking a ride to the <a href='http://www.cntower.ca/portal/'>top of the world</a>. It was awesome. It was a shame that it was so misty, as apparently on a clear day you can see the spray from the Niagara Falls. The SkyDome looks so tiny from way up there too. It's a pity that the football is on tonight, as thats doesn't interest me, but had there been a baseball game on, it might have been a different matter.
<P>
I took a ride on a street car (that's a tram to us Brits), and walkd up Yonge Street. Got some great photos of the <a href='http://www.connollyco.com/discography/rush/allworld.html'>Massey Hall</a>. I was going to make the pilgrimage to the Mapel Leaf Gardens too, but my feet hurt.
<P>
A some point while I'm here I need to go a sit on the steps of the <a href='http://www.connollyco.com/discography/rush/moving.html'>Parliment Building</a> and get someone to take my photograph. Aparently Alex's Bar is not too far away from the hotel, but I doubt I'll get to see any of the guys. Would be fun though :) I also need to go and find the cross section of <a href='http://www.connollyco.com/discography/rush/hemispheres.html'>Danforth And Pape</a> (although La Villa Strangiato isn't to be found there). The funniest thing though is that the hotel's restaurant is called Hemispheres!
<P>
Later tonight I'm hoping to see some fireworks.
<P>
Work think I'm here for a conference, but for me it was always going to be a bit of a pilgrimage ;)
<P>
[1] An unintentional pun, but it works for me :)</p>

<h2>danforth and pape</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jmm/">jmm</a> on 2005-06-26T01:50:59</h3>
The Bloor-Danforth subway line has a stop at Pape, so it should be simple.  From 89 Chestnut, walk east to the Dundas subway station at Yonge Street, go north 3 stops to Bloor, and switch to the Bloor-Danforth line eastbound.
