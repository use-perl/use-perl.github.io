<p><p>Tuesday nights meeting at Gloucestershire LUG went down very well. 21 people in attendance with 4 talks being present. Although JJ and I got a lot of good responses from our talks and some interesting questions, we definitely saved the best til last. Rob and Simon presented a lightning talk on their adventures at FOSDEM last month. The centre piece to their talk was a demo of metasploit. Unsurpisingly it had a captive audience and featured several explitives after witnessing how easy it was to take over a computer on a connected network.
<p>Discussions are afoot to try and organise a technical meeting with Malvern LUG, together with a possible joint venture with the IET. Today I have also discovered that Robbie Bow is planning to revive Cam.pm, so hopefully we can arrange something with them too.
<p>Next month we have MiltonKeynes.pm and Birmingham LUG planned, both of which also look like they will be well attended. 
<p>If you organise or are a member of a local PM group or LUG that hold technical meetings (or even would like to use us as an excuse to start some technical meetings), please feel free to get in touch and we'll see what we can arrange.
We now have an official Birmingham.pm projector and screen, so we can potentially set up just about anywhere. If you have access to those facilities so much the better as it saves me lugging them around :)</p>

<p>We'd be delighted to host you at <a href="http://wellington.pm.org/" title="pm.org">Wellington.pm</a pm.org><nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>

<p>After all, how can you call it a "world tour" if it doesn't take in the South Pacific.</p>

We'd love to, and perhaps next year we might just do that, as I'd like to do a trip that includes Japan, Australia and New Zealand. We need to save up first,  unless a benevolent sponsor decides to pay for the airfare<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)

'how easy it was to talk over a computer'<br>Did you mean '...take over...'?

Oops, yes a typo, but then talk isn't too far removed<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
