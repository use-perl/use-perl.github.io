<p>My musings on this year's conference will appear at some point this week, but suffice to say it was as educational and entertaining as previous conferences. Thanks to Paris.pm for putting it together and making it a success.
<P>
I met several people I hadn't met before, several met me for the first time, and we recruited two additional Birmingham Perl Mongers ;)
<P>
Looking at the stats, out of the top 6 Perl groups only Copenhagen.pm and Birmingham.pm have yet to win a bid to host YAPC::Europe. One of our members wants to attempt a bid for 2005, but seeing as Copenhagen deserve a shot (plus the fact that I'd like to go back there after the Ark tour of 1993), plus having one country host consecutive conferences isn't really fair, I think we'll defer until 2006. 
<P>
It might be a good idea for at least a couple of us to get some practice in of speaking in front of 200+ people. For anyone who doesn't know me well, only Natalie Merchant [1] or large sums of money have enticed me onstage. So maybe I'll be brave enough next year. Perhaps if I have 10,000 Maniacs playing in the background I might survive. Gawd knows what I'll talk about though.
<P>
[1] 2499 people applausing did scare the life out of me though. </p>
