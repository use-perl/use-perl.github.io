<p>Last night I had an enjoyable experience watching two really good bands. The first featured a friend of mine on bass keyboards (he's a proper bass player too, but the keyboards fits in better with the band). They are called <a href='http://www.kingshavelongarms.co.uk/'>Kings Have Long Arms</a> and the have to be once of the most unusual synth bands to come along for quite some time. They've even persuaded Phil Oakey of Human League fame to sing on their first single, a cover of the very old Human League (before the girls arrived) song called Rock And Roll Is Dead. It's a classic. 
<P>
The band came on stage and another friend, who I'd persuade to come along, asked me which one of the band I knew ... erm ... the one in the green basketball vest and shorts and the fetching sparkly racing green gimp mask! 'How did you meet him?' was the next question ... erm ... I used to babysit him and his sisters!
<P>
They were supporting another Manchester band, <a href='http://www.iamkloot.com/www/home.html'>I Am Kloot</a>. Both bands went down a storm and rightly so. They gave it their all, had fun and enjoyed every minute of it. So did I. One of the best gigs I've seen all year.

The only reason I ever heard of I am kloot is because Kloot is dutch for testicle and when they were on stage in the Ancien Belgique, it was in most of the papers<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
