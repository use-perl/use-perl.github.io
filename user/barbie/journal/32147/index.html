<p><p>Dear All,
<p>On 2nd September 2006 it was all over. After three years worth of planning, emails, announcements and lots of late nights, it was all over and done. It was an experience none of the organisers will forget and we're glad to have been a part of the YAPC history.
<p>Those that attended the conference will have been aware of the survey we sent out. We're delighted to say that the response far exceeded our expectations, so thank you to everyone who took the time to answer all the questions and send us your thoughts.
<p>We've created two documents form the survey. The first is the statistical results for the survey, with our own thoughts on the results. The second is a collection of comments made in the suggestions and feedback sections of the survey form.
<p>While many of the comments were absolutely valid, we did feel we needed to explain some of went on behind the scenes. It isn't easy to organise a conference for over 200 people, and we hope some of the suggestions will serve as a pointer to future organisers of what some of your attendees will be hoping for.
<p>The documents are available online:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://yapceurope.org/2006/yapceurope-survey2006.pdf">The Survey Results</a>
<li><a href="http://yapceurope.org/2006/yapceurope-feedback2006.pdf">Suggestions & Feedback</a>
</ul>
<p>We hope you enjoy reading them.
<p>Regards,
<br />The Organisers of YAPC::Europe::2006

thanks for sharing that.<br><br>i like the comment about 'conference virgin' BOF. every YAPC conference organizer seemed to recognize this problem but there yet to have an effective solution. This BOF will certaintly help.<br><br>like the Brouchure idea for pitching to PHB too.<br><br>also want to stress that a central-posting board/area is very important to the attendee.<br><br>one thing i am interested in YAPC is to find out what people use Perl for and quite few times i am amazed with the findnigs. (in the chicago YAPC someone mentioned that their Perl webapp powers many hotels' pay-per-view TV system.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-) not sure if this fits well in the survey though.<br><br>now, i think the YAPC-lesson-learned kind of stuff should posted on yapc site to help future conference organizer.<br><br>
