<p>During last nights Birmingham.pm social meeting we got to talking about Red Hat 8 and Mozilla. In particular the lovely round edged windows and default the fonts of the Bluecurve interface. Its impressive how much the desktop side of Linux distros have come on in the last few years. I think now more than ever there is a real alternative to Windows that does scare your average user ... well not too much anyway :)
<P>
Aparently Red Hat 9 is now out, so will have to clear out some disc space on my file server tonight [1] so I can download the ISOs. My only problem is that I've been so busy with working on my laptop, I haven't had a chance to backup anything yet. I still haven't manage to get the network configuration working on it, so backups involve lots of file copying to and from floppy disk at the moment. Of course that is another reason why I should get my finger out and upgrade. Then the nice new shiny network card, that is currently sitting gathering dust, can get some much needed exercise.
<P>
Its a shame that the Linux Expo, which was due to be held at the Birmingham NEC this month, has moved, as I could likely have bought a copy of Red Hat 9 there.<br/><br/><P>

<p>Actually if you're interested in a good backup solution for Red Hat, take a look at (<a href="http://www.mondorescue.com/" title="mondorescue.com">www.mondorescue.com</a mondorescue.com>).</p>

<p>The guys that write and debug it hang around a lot on irc.freenode.net in both <tt>#redhat</tt> and <tt>#mondo</tt> if you have any questions.</p>

This looks great, especially as its cross platform. Once I get my big Linux server up and running and talking to the other machines, I wanted to create a single CVS repository that can be used to hold the important stuff (mostly code,  docs and websites), and then back that up periodically.
At the moment I have both a Windows and a Linux CVS repository and tons of adhoc directories, so this looks like a good solution. Thanks<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

I did like the final thought on the About page:
