<p><p>It's been several years since I had to build an RPM. Today I had to build one for work, and instantly hit an odd error. It basically claimed that 'Copyright:' wasn't supported and bombed with a synatx error. A bit of googling and I discovered that as of rpmbuild-4.4 the tag 'Copyright' was replaced with 'License'.
<p>Now maybe it's just me, but License and Copyright are two entirely different things. One doesn't imply the other. While both can exist separately, stating that one has been superceded by the other is just nuts. I can understand why License should be included, as knowing the distribution rights can be quite important. But to ban the use of Copyright just seems to be a nuisance. If they had downgraded it's usage to that of a comment, then that I could understand. But to state, as one poster did, that "it's a bug in your packaging" is just inconvient and annoying.
<p>In this case the rpm I'm building is for internal use only, so setting License to 'Restricted Private' doesn't seem to be as informative as 'Copyright: 1998-2007 MessageLabs'.
<p>License vs Copyright ... the new holy wars!</p>
