<div class="span8">
<p><p>Preparations for the <a href="http://qa-hackathon.org/">2009 QA Hackathon</a> are
well under way, and following our earlier announcement to confirm the
dates, 28th - 30th March, we are delighted to announce the venue. The
QA Hackathon will be held at <a href="http://www.cityinn.com/birmingham/">The City Inn</a>,
which is located in Birmingham city centre and within easy reach of
road, rail, and air links.</p>

<p>We are currently negotiating prices for accommodation as we are keen to have
everyone staying in the same hotel, so that if attendees feel inclined to
hack into the night they can do so. Therefore if you are planning on attending
the hackathon, <a href="http://qa-hackathon.org/wiki/Attendees">please add yourself
to the website</a> so that we have a better idea of numbers.</p>

<p>In regard to those planning to attend and will have your travel and/or
accommodation funded by your employer, please let us know, as we would
be happy to include them as a sponsor on the website, and recognise
their contribution to the event.</p>

<p>Further to this we are eager to attract sponsors to help us cover costs
for the event. Even a small amount would be extremely welcome, and we would
encourage you to get in touch, or ask your marketing department to get
in touch for further information of what we can offer sponsors. We are
very grateful to our early sponsors $foo magazine and Nestoria, and of
course The Birmingham Perl Mongers who are underwriting the event.</p>

<p>If you have any questions, or simply wish to contact the organsiers you
can do so at: <a href="mailto:organisers@qa-hackathon.org">organisers@qa-hackathon.org</a>.</p>
