<p>Since Monday morning on the way to work, I've thinking about talks. I now have 4 talks I want to write. Two definitely for submissions to YAPC::Europe (as I now think it's about time and they're good ideas for talks), and another two just for the Birmingham.pm technical meetings. The former two I might even present at Birmingham.pm AND London.pm techinal meetings, if I'm feeling brave. 
<P>
For sometime I have been trying to think of something I could talk about, that I would feel comfortable presenting in front of Perl experts. It's not easy and quite a daunting prospect if you hate presenting anyway. Thankfully, RichardC has nitpicked my talks enough for me to feel that I can do it without losing too much face. However, I really need to make an effort to ensure there is an absolute minimum of errors. I have a habit of cut'n'paste and retyping, without checking the result to see whether I've missed or mispelt something. Its okay in front of Birmingham.pm (they're a forgiving bunch), but for London.pm and YAPC::Europe it really isn't good enough. I will attempt to have them finished by the end of the year, so I can practise ... at least once a week :)
