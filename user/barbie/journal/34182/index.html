<p><p>It would seem my routing ISP is <a href="http://status.easyspace.com/">suffering again</a>. It's a pain as I've been having a few private and mailing list conversations this week and suddenly they all dried up this morning. As a blanket announcement, if anyone wanted to get in touch in the short term you can use my <b>missbarbell</b>@<b>easynet.co.uk</b> account. I've been meaning to turn that account off for sometime, it's just as well I haven't got around to it :)
<p>I wonder if this is a yearly thing, as this has been happening roughly around this time for the past few years. I really must get around to properly setting up my own mail server.</p>

I recommend <a href="http://bytemark.co.uk/" title="bytemark.co.uk">bytemark</a bytemark.co.uk> for your mail sewer.  I also keep a few other shell accounts around so I can at least send email if they ever have an outage.  <a href="http://freeshell.org/" title="freeshell.org">freeshell.org</a freeshell.org> is good.

<p>I'm currently setting up exim on my server at the moment<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) I've also got access to a Bytemark server so that may be the backup plan<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
</p><p>Since NicNames got bought out the service levels have just gone down hill. I'm now planning to move all my other domains across to Simply.com, as they are local (Worcester, I practically pass it on the way to work every day!) and have 3 mail servers as opposed to the 1 I have with EasySpace.
</p><p>I suppose I could go with a certain major mail security provider, but I'm not sure I could persuade them that it's a test account and get it for free<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>
