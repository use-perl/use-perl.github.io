<p>I'm not quite sure how it started, but it appears that Casey, Marty and Karen 
have been having a bit of a laugh with each other. On Wednesday at dinner, Casey had
the idea to send the waiters over to Karen with a birthday cake and sing her 
Happy Birthday. Thinking they would just do it, he thought it would be quite a
fun surprise. Unfortunately one of the waiters went asked if there was anyone 
on the table with a birthday, to which they replied no. Casey, however, 
insisted that it was Karen's birthday. 
<P>
The sound of Happy Birthday and a lit cake came past the table. I think Karen 
thought they'd escaped, but oh no. It was quite amusing to watch her go bright 
red. The rest of us were crying with laughter, and got even worse when Karen 
got up and walked towards us. I think everyone expected her to give Casey a 
good clip round the ear. Instead he just got a kiss on the cheek, and a 'just 
you wait' look. 
<P>
Seeing as it was only Wednesday and there was the rest of the week to go, Casey 
suddenly realised he had probably played his Ace a little too early. For the rest
of the week, he was sweating slightly as to what he'd get in response. 
Thankfully for him, there wasn't anything. 
<P>
However, sitting in the airport, Karen did come up with a classic response. 
You'll have to wait until it happens to find out what she's planning though. 
<P>
Casey, be afraid. Be very afraid ;)
