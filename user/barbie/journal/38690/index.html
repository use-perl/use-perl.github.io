<p><p>I got this in my inbox this morning:</p>
<blockquote><b>THIS IS UNSOLICITED, THUS SPAM !
<br /><br />
STOP THIS *NOW* AND REMOVE ME FROM THIS LIST. I CAN KEEP TRACK OF CPAN DISTS MYSELF.
</b></blockquote>
<p>This is in response to a CPAN Testers daily summary report. The above is cut-n-paste from the original. I then discover I'm in the middle of a mud-slinging regarding the daily summary because it doesn't go far enough.</p>
<p>Is it really that difficult to realise I'm actually a real person, and actually quite responsive most of the time. Politeness goes a long way. Treating me like the scum of the earth doesn't.</p></p>

<h2>Name and Shame</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Ovid/">Ovid</a> on 2009-03-24T11:52:26</h3>
<p>Name and shame isn't generally a great strategy, but it's awfully tempting at times (presumably after you contact the email author and they still treat you like that).</p>



<h2>THANK YOU BARBIE!</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/mir/">mir</a> on 2009-03-25T14:23:02</h3>
<p>I FOR ONE REALLY *APPRECIATE* THE CPAN TESTERS REPORTS AND I THINK YOU HAVE DONE A GREAT JOB AT IMPROVING THE SIGNAL/NOISE RATIO, THUS I THANK YOU.
</p><p>
There you go, I hope the balance of the universe is some what restored.</p>

<p>lol<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p><p>It was a bad morning yesterday, and the person who sent the mail just really touched a nerve. Thankfully those kinds of mails don't happen often. The irritating thing was that the author's distribution currently fails on all platforms and perls, and he would have got about 10+ individual mails previously, this time around he got 1 email.</p><p>I appreciate some don't want the mails, but is it really that difficult to write a polite mail asking me to disable the mails for them? Obviously for this guy it is.</p><p>Thanks Michel, you did make me smile. Balance restored<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>
