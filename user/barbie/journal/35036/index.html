<div class="span8">
<p><p>This weekend several members of Birmingham.pm headed to London for the London Perl Workshop. Several of us met up in the evening at The Penderel&#39;s Oak pub in High Holburn for pre-workshop hellos, beer and food. On Saturday the workshop started with a great keynote by Tim Bunce, featured a Teach-In by Dave Cross and two further tracks of talks. Unfortunately Dom Mitchell and myself got stuck in a lift and ended up missing all the afternoon lightning talks, but despite this, it was a great day of talks and discussion. Aside from photos, I have several videos from the event and will be putting them online as soon as I have some time to edit them. In the meantime, enjoy the photo albums now available:</p><ul><li><a href="http://birmingham.pm.org/album/138">London Perl Workshop - Friday Meetup</a></li><li><a href="http://birmingham.pm.org/album/139">London Perl Workshop</a> </li></ul></p>

I couldn't think of a nicer person to spend an hour in a lift with, though!  Thanks for putting up with me.

If we'd known we'd have taken bets on who was most likely to have eaten the other one<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

<p>We'd both just come out of Subway across the road with foot long subs, so it would have been quite a long time before we got that desperate. Missing beer would have been a much higher concern before missing food<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)</p>
