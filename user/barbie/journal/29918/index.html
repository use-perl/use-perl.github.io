<p><P>I recent bought two 300GB drives to use for backups. I have tons of digital photos (especially of the family) I want to have backed up, but at some point I want to rip the 300+ tapes of <a href="http://ark.grango.org/">ARK</a> and <a href="http://www.gep.co.uk/iq/">IQ</a> gigs I have. However, storing the HDDs in a single machine would normally prove awkward, due to space. But then I spotted something called an <a href="http://www.raidsonic.de/en/pages/products/backplanes.php?we_objectID=2516">IcyDock</a>. I noticed Overclock have a <a href="http://www.overclock.co.uk/product.php?productid=19181&cat=466&view=rel">3 bay version</a>, which looks like just the job for me.
<P>
ARK have given me their blessing to put the recordings online, although I'll probaby rotate 1 or 2 gigs (thats concerts not Gigabyte of space) a month. I'd look to put the IQ shows online, but although the band are well aware I have tons of tapes, some of them are so rare that I'd be reluctant to just let them loose. There were only about 5 of us who had pretty much the whole of the 80s shows between us. Not sure if that's true any more. I bumped into John last night (ex-bass payer for ARK, current bass player for IQ), and he seemed in jolly spirits. He was enthusing about his current side project, <a href="http://www.frost-music.com/">Frost</a>. Their new album is released next month, and if John's involvement is anything to go by, it'll be well worth a listen.</p>
