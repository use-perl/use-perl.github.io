<p><p>Third party libraries are troublesome at the best of times, but I don't usually have so much trouble as I did yesterday. 
<p>As the Google Calendar thing seems to be growing in popularity, I firstly wanted to create a Birmingham.pm version of our own <a href="http://birmingham.pm.org/bpm.events.ics">ICS feed</a>. My ultimate aim is to be able to automatically update Google Calendars that I have access to, when I add, amend or delete calendar entries for Birmingham Perl Mongers events.
<p>So I set about installing muttley's <a href="http:search.cpan.org/dist/Net-Google-Calendar">Net::Google::Calendar</a>. As I write most my development code on Windows, I started out trying to install it on my XP laptop. It became traumatic simply because of the libxml2 and ssleay libraries. I did manage to get both install evenutally, only to find the ssleay DLL doesn't work on XP.
<p>Next up I tried on a remote Debian server. This time the xmllib2 library caused problems. Even though it was installed and was the latest version from the debian stable repository, XML-LibXML and XML-Atom couldn't find it!
<p>Finally I tried my home Debian box. It seems running apt-get and cpan from the command line just got themselves in knots. I finally used synaptic this morning and installed the dependencies cleanly. Then ran cpan to install Net::Google::Calendar. Finally it worked!
<p>Installation shouldn't be this troublesome. As far as I was aware synaptic is mostly a pretty wrapper around apt-get, so why the command line version kept failing to find libraries I have no idea. Hopefully I can get this installed on the new server we're planning for Birmingham.pm, so I can implement the Google Calendar automatic update features.</p>

<h2>You need the -dev package</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/autarch/">autarch</a> on 2007-04-11T15:00:33</h3>
You probably needed to install libxml2-dev on the Debian box.



<h2>your problem is trusting debian perl packages</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/TeeJay/">TeeJay</a> on 2007-04-11T20:10:54</h3>
just use cpan - using debian perl packages is a recipe for pain.

<p>Except cpan was having just as many problems! On the one box, after installing libxml2 and rerunning cpan, it failed to locate the library<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:(
</p><p>I don't think this a Perl issue though, it's more the way 3rd party libraries are installed and seem to be a lot more fragile these days.</p>

<h2>OS X gets it right</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/drhyde/">drhyde</a> on 2007-04-12T10:45:23</h3>
This is why I like OS X.  Properly packaged OS X apps include their own copies of libraries in their<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.app directory.  Sure, this means you get duplicated files but really, who cares about duplicating a few 100K libraries these days?
