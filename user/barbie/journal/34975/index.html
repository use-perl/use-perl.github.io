<b>Talks:</b>
<ul>
<li>WARP [ Martin Wright ]
<li>Option and configuration processing made easy [ JJ ]
</ul>
<p>
<b>Datails</b>
<p>
Please note, due to an unfortunate block booking, we have had to move the last technical meeting of the year to Bennett's. This will be the last technical meeting until February 2008, although there will be our AGM in January. 
<p>
This month we have a special guest joining us, with Martin Wright coming to talk to us about WARP, an initiative to alert and inform users of potential software threats, issues and vulnerabilities. 
<p>
Following his successful first article on Perl.com, JJ will be expanding the article to give a more interactive explanation of program argument processing. This will also be a warm-up for his appearance at the London Perl Workshop at the weekend, and JJ would appreciate the feedback, so come along and see this exclusive preview.
<p>
As always entry is free, with no knowledge of Perl required. We'd be delighted to have you along, so feel free to invite family, friends and colleagues ;)
<p>
We'll be in the venue from about 6.30pm, and have booked The Boardroom for the night. Order food as you get there, and we'll aim to begin talks at about 8pm. I expect talks to finish about 9.30pm, with plenty of time for discussion and planning for meetups over the weekend in London.
<p>
