<p><p><a href="http://use.perl.org/user/domm/journal/32175">Thomas</a> has just sent me a mail telling me I've been tagged. I followed a few others and found some very interesting things about people I've known for some time. There is perhaps the obvious one for me, but seeing as I've never told anyone in the last 15+ years of being asked, I'm not about to start now :) However, here are a few others, just in case you were interested enough to wonder.
<p>
1) I have brain damage. In December 1980 I hit a pothole in the road, while riding my bike through the village where I grew up. I went over the handlebars and landed on my head. I suffered temporary paralysis of the lower limbs and now have a ridge in my skull that is going to look terrible when I go bald. Although the damage isn't noticeable most times, I do have a problem recalling things from memory. It's not that I've forgotten anything, just that the triggers need some help making the associations. However, it probably does explain a few things :)
<p>
2) I once worked for Take That. For several years I was a professional roadie, either working as local crew, lighting engineer, drum technician or stage crew. I worked with several small bands, but also got asked to work with some big ones too occasionally. Aside from Take That, I've also done many others including Debbie Harry, June Tabor, The Indigo Girls, Massive Attack, The Lemonheads and the one that always gets muttley jealous, The Breeders.
<p>
3) I competed in the Cheshire Trials. Once upon a time the British Olympic Committee would come to the Cheshire Trials to look for hopeful atheletic stars of the future. I used to run 200m and 400m. Unfortunately I never got picked, but Andrew Geddes did, who was in the year above me at school and lived round the corner. 
<p>
4) My singing voice has been heard on BBC Radio One. Back in 1992, the band I was working with at the time, Ark, won a competition on The Friday Rock Show with Tommy Vance, to record a session at the Maida Vale studios. On the track Celebrate, the band and crew all crammed into the sound booth to record the backing vocals. It got broadcast at least twice.
<p>
5) The only member of Led Zeppelin I have ever met is John Bonham. My next door neighbours used to compete in the North West Scamble races and I'd often go with them to offer support. On a few occasions John Bonham would take his son Jason along to compete. Although I now live not far from Robert Plant, John is still the only band member I've had the opportunity to say hello to. I also live not far from Tony Iommi, but I've met him :)
<p>
I'm loathed to continue this on, as I've never been a fan of chain letters. But if I was to name anyone they would be .... <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/lilstevey/journal/">Steve</a>, <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/jj/journal/">JJ</a>, <a href="http://martian.org/karen/">Karen</a>, <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/Alias/journal/">Adam</a> and <a href="http://deflatermouse.livejournal.com/">muttley</a>.
