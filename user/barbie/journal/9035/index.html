<P>
I had originally posted my feelings regarding the Solutions post for MJD's quiz here, but having had some mixed reactions, I now don't want to fuel the situation further.
<P>
Mark has said he didn't mean to upset me, but unfortunately I didn't read the post that way, and neither did some others who have made private comments to me.
<P>
I can accept we have a difference of opinion, but didn't deserve to held into question in the way that I was. Despite Mark and others asking me to still contribute, I feel that my usefulness of the quiz list has come to an end. I would rather my posts be considered rationally than start a flame war.</p>

<h2>Rant</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/acme/">acme</a> on 2002-11-20T15:03:44</h3>
It was a bit of a rant, wasn't it? I'd have kept it out of the qotw, but then, I'm not him. Of course, I'm the kind of person who would say that it's a bug in perl - it doesn't normally give warnings for things that may be wrong, so I don't see why it should start here.
