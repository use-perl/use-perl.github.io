<p><a href='http://use.perl.org/user/drhyde/'>Evil Dave</a> and I were talking offlist regarding various matters, and he happen to mention that he maintains a site for old software. He mentioned WordStar.
<P>
I remembered using WordStar briefly at Cov Poly back in the mid 80s. Initially the Poly had advocated something called SMART, sort of like OpenOffice, but based on DOS. It wasn't bad for what it was, but WordStar was definitely a step up. Then I worked for a company in Leicester in 1986 and discover a revolutionary desktop publishing package (it was a bit more than just a word processor), called Volkswriter. At the time I thought it was the bees knees, but unfortunately it didn't seem  to sell very well. The Leicester company was the only company I knew who used it. When I joined GEC a year later, they were firmly leading the way with Interleaf.
<P>
WordStar and WordPerfect were making great leaps and bounds as I recall at the time, and over took both. Then Windows 95 happened and MS Office gazumped the lot of them.
<P>
A shame really, as the others were great packages too.
<P>
Interesting aside, all my documentation for C programs at Cov Poly had to be done in nroff, as the lecturer hated DOS (no, the Linux vs Windows vs Mac is not a new debate ;p). I became a bit of a whiz at writing nroff macros and used to use them at GEC to write all my documentation from design specs to program user guides. I then had a little app that acting as filter into Interleaf. Kind of like POD and all the pod2... apps now :)</p>

In 1986/7 I did my sandwich year working for IBM. The department that I was in was responsible for producing the text that was used in new product announcements for PC products (that was the year that the PS/2 range was released).<br> <br>We had a single document for each product from which we extracted the relevant parts to make up a number of differently formatted documents for various audiences. We didn't use a work processor, we had plain text files that were marked up using an internal IBM markup language called GML. This was a simplified version of another language called SGML.<br> <br>Of course, once I got back to college in 1987 I started using "real" word processors and assumed that my knowledge of SGML would be something that I'd never need again.<br>

troff is excellent.  I wrote all my college in troff/tbl/pic/eqn using the -me macros.
