<p>So this month has mostly featured a lot of work after the QA Hackathon, without too many announcements. While there has been a lot of changes behind the scenes, we've mostly been getting on with stuff. David Golden and Ricardo Signes have been continuing with the Metabase, to the point David can now submit reports locally. There is still a bit of work needed to get the rest of the pieces all synced and working, but we are getting closer to CT2.0.</p>
<p>The mailers managed to highlight a fault recently, that has now been fixed, so if you've been wondering why the Summaries haven't been appearing, they should start filtering through again soon. <a href="http://stats.cpantesters.org/updates.html#April2009c">As announced during April</a>, there are now Weekly and Monthly Summary reports available, as well as the ability to receive individual mails again. Check the appropriate pages on the <a href="http://prefs.cpantesters.org/">CPAN Testers Preferences</a> website and update as you require. </p>
<p>As mentioned in <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/barbie/journal/38904">my blog last week</a>, my time over the last month has featured work on the dual dynamic and static sites for the Reports. I'm pleased to say the underlying code is now complete. It will take a little while to carefully change the live system, as there are some significant database changes required, so I want to make sure the changes don't have any adverse affects. In addition, prompted by <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/Alias/journal/38842">Adam Kennedy's blog post</a> about the state of many Perl websites, I took some to look at some designs and found one that looked perfect for the job. I've now reskinned several of the CPAN Testers sites and just have 1 publicly visible site left to do. There is another that has been waiting in the wings for some time, but I may wait until CT2.0 is available before unleashing it. However, with all the changes going on, there is one site that will be new (sort of), although it really is just a fork one of the existing sites. Seeing as I don't want to spoil the surprises, you're just going to have to wait for a little while longer to see all the results :)</p>
<p>We passed 3.5 million test reports last month, and although there were quite a number of reports posted last month, considering that last month CPAN had the most distributions submitted in a month ever (<b>1897</b>), it wasn't quite as many as I would have expected. Unfortunately the graphs on CPAN Testers Statistics have reached their Google Chart limit, so I'll be altering the graphs slightly for next month. </p>
<p>We topped 149 testers submitting reports last month, so thank you again to everyone involved. The mappings this month included 24 total addresses mapped, of which 10 were for newly identified testers.</p>
