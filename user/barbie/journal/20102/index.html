<p>This weekend has been quite traumatic. Nicole's Nan, Mary, was finally laid to rest. 
<P>
The services began on Sunday afternoon, with the cavalcade going from the funeral home to the church. They took a route that led them along Midland Road, where Mary and Poppa has spent most of lives, since moving to Birmingham, the grandsons walking behind the hearse. Then Mary's 3 daughters and 3 grand-daughters carried her into the church. It was much more emotional than I expected. Unfortunately, due to Nicole not being the first into the front pew, like was originally planned, DanDan ended up sitting on his own. He was absolutely golden. Even though it was a longish service he was quiet and respectful all the way through. 
<P>
The final service began on the Monday morning. The readings and tributes were wonderful. Nicole only just got out her thank-yous to the staff of the nursing home, who had been looking after her Nan for the past year or so. The 6 of them that could come along to pay their respects were in tears afterwards. The priest managed to capture Mary's life very well, even though he hadn't known her for very long. The church service ended with 5 of the 6 grandsons and Ray (Nicole's father) carrying Mary out of the church. I didn't get to see the burial service, as I walked both DanDan and his 2nd cousin Jacob round the cemetary. Nicole and Jacob's mom were wary of the effect it might have on them. Throughout the whole of weekend, DanDan didn't once question what the box was. We told him we were there to say goodbye to Nanny-Nanny, and he just accepted it.
<P>
The whole occasion went very well, and its been amazing to see how many lives Mary and Poppa touched, as the cards, phonecalls, and personal callers are still coming. It's going to affect Nicole's mom quiet hard shortly, as she has been holding together extremely well. However, I've told her she now has DanDan and the one forthcoming to look after now :)</p>

<h2>The last farewell</h2>

I'm sorry to hear of your loss. Your situation echoes my own. My wifes mother passed away last January. Our son Alfie was very close to her. He was very brave at the funeral, though he cried a little after the service.<p>Naively we thought that a 5 year would quickly forget. However, he now sleeps with us most nights, still talks about her and when tired or upset cries and says he wants his Nanny. It's not easy.</p><p>My wife is also expecting. Alfie is planning on telling the baby all about the lovely nanny he never met</p><p>Jonathan</p>
