<p><P>The joys of translation do bring up some amusing phrases. As part of the <a href='http://braga.yapceurope.org'>YAPC::Europe</a> package, we are now able to book rooms in the university's <a href='http://braga.yapceurope.org/index.cgi?UniversitaryResidence'>halls of residence</a>. Within the description that cog and ambs have included about the accommodation, was the fact in included "an electric disk".</p>
<P>
Here at MessageLabs we have been wondering what on earth it could be. An electric fan, something to play music on  or something else. Well Alberto has just sent me a mail it explaining it. It's equivalent to a single hot plate on a cooker. So we can actually cook hot food in the room, and not have to go in search of a cafe in the morning :)</p>
<P>
Seeing as we've only just got the go ahead to send 6 people, and the local hotel being fully booked, we're having to go with the Halls accommodation. We could go to the hotel in town, but we'd rather be closer to the venue than town. It'll be easier crawl to in the morning for some ;) It's been a bit frustrating with the decision to go being left so late, as flights prices have gone up and I can no longer fly on Monday due to a ÃÂ£500 rise in price. That's rise, as in the flight now costs ÃÂ£850+ just to fly out on Monday. The lesson is, book everything yourself and hand the boss the bill when he finally says yes!
