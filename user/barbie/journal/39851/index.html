<p><p>Cross-posted from the <a href="http://blog.cpantesters.org">CPAN Testers Blog</a>.</p>
<p>If you've not been following the <a href="http://blog.cpantesters.org">CPAN Testers</a> in the last month, you will likely have missed the updates to the <a href="http://stats.cpantesters.org">CPAN Testers Statistics</a> site. I would like to thanks <strong>MW487</strong>, <strong>JJ</strong> and <strong>Colin Newell</strong> for their thoughts and suggestions. The biggest changes have been around the matrices. The old matrices have been thrown away and a completely new set have been created, merging much of the data that was previously across the two old style matrices. The site now also looks at the OS system, rather than the specific version installed, which now gives a better general overview. In turn a new <a href="http://stats.cpantesters.org/mosname.html">OS table</a> is also available highlighting the number of tests per month are attributed to a particular OS. Unsurprisingly Linux is currently streets ahead of any other OS.</p>
<p>The graphs have always been of interest to those wishing to use them to promote Perl and CPAN, however, the way they are currently presented, doesn't always suit everyone, especially if they wish to change the style or take a different snapshot of the data. As such, you can now download the raw data files used to generate the graphs. All the files are in CSV format, so are easily loaded into you spreadsheet application of choice. Speaking of spreadsheets, in addition to changing the look of the matrices, you can now also download an XLS version of each matrix, as well as now having the ability to view each table in a widescreen format.</p>
<p>A new graph available is the <a href="http://stats.cpantesters.org/perform.html">Performance Graph</a>, which shows how the CPAN Testers Reports Page Builder is performing each day, against the volume of reports submitted per day. While the majority of the time the Builder does perform well, every so often it slows due to the load on the web server, meaning it has to occasionally catch up, which can take several days. Now you can see whether any issues have caused your page to take a little longer to build, as well get a better idea of how many reports are getting submitted every day.</p>
<p>The most recent update has been the new dashboard on the homepage. Every so often I get asked how many CPAN distributions are on CPAN. Although the <a href="http://stats.cpantesters.org/statscpan.html">CPAN Statistics</a> have had their own page for a while now, some have mentioned that it would be really cool to have a ticker that flips as a new upload gets added to CPAN. Although I can't do that just yet in true realtime, the new dashboard does try an emulate the rate at which reports and uploads have been submitted over the previous 24 hours.</p>
<p>In other CPAN related news the proposals and discussions for <a href="http://www.dagolden.com/index.php/519/list-of-cpan-meta-spec-proposals/">Meta-Spec 2.0</a> have now come to a close. David Golden is currently <a href="http://github.com/dagolden/cpan-meta-spec">accepting patches</a> to the approved proposals and hopefully we'll have a new draft specification available soon. It's been an interesting discussion in some cases, while others have been agreed or rejected almost without question. Some require a bit more thought, so it's likely there will be a further refinement of the spec in the future. If you want to read all the threads, visit the <a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/cpan-workers@perl.org/index.html#00197">mailing list archives</a>.</p>
<p>Last month we had a total of 171 tester addresses submitting reports. The mappings this month included 27 total addresses mapped, of which 14 were for newly identified testers.</p>
<p>Until next time, happy testing :)</p>
