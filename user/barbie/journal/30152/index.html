I could make some digs about that title, but it does in fact refer to me getting home safely. I was planning to update my journal while I was in Chicago, but with so much to do and so many people to meet, I just kept notes. Alas that wasn't as good an idea as I first thought.
<P>
On Wednesday while trying to plug in a power adapter, my laptop fell off the chair and hit the floor. As it wasn't a long drop, I just feared broken plastic. On first glance it seemed I had escaped without any broken exterior, and thought I was safe. Alas the blue screen that confronted me when I opened the laptop wasn't so heart warming. It appears that both the Hard Disk and CD Drive are more b0rked than a borked thing :(
<P>

I'm just glad that before leaving for the states I saved off all the photos I'd ever taken of Ethne onto my new 300GB drive. There are quite a few things that I've lost, which I should have backed up (although most I can recreate), but the biggest annoyance is that all the photos I'd take while in Chicago are now gone, and my slides now only exist in video format. There were a few other talk presentations I was working on, which I'll now have to start all over again. I'm going to have to start setting an automatic rsync of a morning so I don't forgot to do it manually.
<P>
I still have some hand written notes, so I'll get around to posting them during the week.</p>
