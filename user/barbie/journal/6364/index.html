<p>Reinstalled my laptop (was RH 6.2) to RH 7.3, mainly to get mod_perl compiled properly in Apache, but also cos I was getting bored of wishing I had a decent Office system that worked under Gnome (and for anyone thinks StarOffice does, it doesn't on the 2 different cover disks, 1 official disk and a site download I tried).
<P>
Having got KDE up and running with various extras, discovered I only have 200MB left on my HD :( Mind you it's my own fault for adding games I suppose ;)
<P>
Alas it isn't as fast as my previous installation, and has the annoying habit of continually popping up the contents of the CD drive when reviving from suspend mode. I can probably turn it off, but have found the option yet...
<P>
With everyone seeming to rave about KDE I expected it to fly, but on this box it appears to be at least 30-60 seconds slower to open a browser.
<P>
I prefer the Workspace split on Gnome as I usually have a defined role for each one. Several times with KDE I select the workspace, then accidentally select the wrong console and I flip to another workspace. Is there a option to only show the apps running for the selected workspace? I might get better with practice, but I doubt it.
<P>
Started redevelopment of our flagship product into mod_perl. Previously codenamed Mephisto, the mod_perl version has been christened Elizium (see Fields Of The Nephilim). Proving a bit messy to begin with, but hopefully it should make the whole thing a bit more streamlined.
<P>
Also saw my contribution to NMS get an official release this weekend :) Nice to know I can do something useful every once in a while.</p>

<h2>Mephisto?</h2>

If that's the code I looked at, then I'm not sure the codename is sufficiently diabolical.

No, you looked at the other product that is being developed for NTL.
<p>
The one I'm responsible for is a much simpler beast. The only major hassle really is making sure all our globals are being passed correctly.
</p><p>
Unfortunately because it was based on an old code base that has gradually been rewritten, we don't run with -wT and strict, which is very scary. However, running on my laptop with -wT and strict mainly just showed up that the passing of globals between scripts is bad and there are several instances of variables only used once.

One day I might write my memoires of the experience....<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>
