<div class="span8">
<p><p>Seeing as others have been discussing suitable talks for forthcoming conferences, I've been wondering whether my <i><b>Understanding Malware</b></i> talk would be worth submitting to YAPC::NA and/or YAPC::Europe. The thing is there is some interesting content, but it doesn't really discuss Perl. It also isn't specifically about anything we do here at MessageLabs, although I do tell a few war stories. However, the tie-in is that here at MessageLabs we do use Perl to help protect the internet from scum^Wmalicious software writers.

<p>I did the talk at Leicester University last week and at Coventry University yesterday, and the response was very positive. At both events the discussion during and after the talk, proved there was most definitely interest in the subject matter. And I have no doubt that some would find it interesting at YAPC conferences. But does it really warrant a submission? The abstract would be:

<p><blockquote><i>In the early days of computing, networks and servers were left more or          
less open to anyone, as everyone looked after the machines they used,           
never maliciously doing any damage. Then someone decided that it would          
be "fun" to try and break things. Today there are hundreds of thousands         
of malware threats, many of which are now borne over email. This talk            
looks at the many different types of malware (including virus, spam and         
phishing) and provides some clues to help those wishing to filter and 
stop these threats reaching their inboxes.
</i></blockquote>
<p>So my question is, should I submit this talk to YAPC::NA and YAPC::Europe? 
<p><b>Update:</b> Thanks for the feedback guys, I shall now be submitting it to both YAPCs :) Then it's up to the organisers ;)</p>

<h2>Yup</h2>

Yes please, sounds fascinating.



<h2>Absolutely</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Alias/">Alias</a> on 2008-02-20T21:00:07</h3>
It's talks like this from topic experts that help round out the conference and make it far more interesting.<br>



<h2>Yes yes yes yes.</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Aristotle/">Aristotle</a> on 2008-02-21T11:21:11</h3>
<p>Yes!</p>

<p>(In case I haven&#8217;t made myself clear: you definitely should.)</p>
