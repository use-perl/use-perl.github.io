<p>The LPW organisers have announced the 
<A HREF="http://london.pm.org/lpw/talks.html">talk schedule</A> for next 
weekend. 
<P>
Looking at the original list, I was hoping I'd get the chance to see most of 
the talks that looking interesting for me. I've decided to follow the Learning 
Perl track in the morning and the Advanced Perl track in the afternoon. That 
way I get to see most of the talks I want to see.
<P>
It means I get to see both of 
<A HREF="http://www.martian.org/marty/">Marty</A>'s test talks, so I can get 
some hints when I put together mine for work. But it does mean I miss 
<A HREF="http://use.perl.org/user/tomhukins/journal/">Tom</A> talking about 
'Class::DBI', <A HREF="http://use.perl.org/user/drhyde/journal/">Dave Cantrell</A> 
talking about 'API standardisation' and 
<A HREF="http://use.perl.org/user/cwest/journal/">Casey</A> talking about 
'Managing and sending mail'. Maybe I can persuade Tom and Dave to come a present their talks for Birmingham.pm :) Admittedly Casey's talk would be for amusement 
only, as I'm more interested in the audience and questions than the actual 
talk. Plus it means if there are any shenanighans due, then I'll miss them :( 
Hopefully someone has a video recorder running at the appropriate moment (but 
don't tell him I told you!)
<P>
I have still to expand my talk from the original 20 minutes I had planned, but 
there are several notes I've made for things I can talk about at greater length.
The original short talk was probably a bit too much geared to how a report is 
created. I want to get away from that, and show the benefits of cpan-testers, 
Phalanx and CPANTS. Hopefully it'll generate some good discussion and may be 
even encourage more to get involved.
<P>
I still need to sort out a hotel. Hopefully work will be sorting that out today.<br/><br/><P>
<b>Update:</b> We're staying at <a href='http://www.kkhotels.com/george'>K+K Hotel George</a> for Friday night only. I heard a whisper that the recommended pub meet for the Friday night is likely to be <a href='http://london.openguides.org/index.cgi?Star_Tavern%2C_SW1X_8HT'>The Star Tavern</a> in Belgravia, which from past experience would be an excellent choice. Now I just need to get there and enjoy the weekend :)</p>
