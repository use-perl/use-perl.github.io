<p>Around a year and a half ago I was having problems with Class::Phrasebook. Mainly because it requires XML libraries, that (without going into detail) couldn't be installed on the target machine. I had to rewrite my phrasebook code to use a simpler method. I choose .ini files, utilising Config::IniFiles.
<P>
After mentioning this on use.perl, Iain Truskett got in touch and sent a distribution that he'd been working on, called simply Phrasebook. It was a true class based framework with a plugin architecture. I'd started using .ini files, while Iain was using YAML. After an initial bit of hacking I had the .ini plugin working within Iain's design. 
<P>
On 29th December 2003, Iain unfortunately died. I was left with a lot of ideas and code that deserved to be carried on. I made a start in early 2004, but for a number of reasons got side tracked. Towards the end of last year I started completing the work, but hit several problems. The modules that were original used had moved on. After several upgrades I then discovered that Class::MethodMaker just didn't work for me. In the meantime Simon had written Module::Pluggable, which appeared to fit the bill much better. I also felt the name of the distribution need to be changed, hence renaming to Data::Phrasebook.
<P>
Over the past couple of months I have been working on the documentation and tests to get as complete a work as possible, both for the main distribution and the plugins. Yesterday I felt the main distro and the two original plugins were ready for release. 
<P>
I'm now looking at finishing the other two plugins and releasing those as soon as possible. I now have all the POD and tests ported from the other plugins, which has been useful. Now to just to fix the niggly problems.
<P>
I wouldn't have ever got this far if it hadn't have been for Iain's help and original core code. 
<P>
In other news I have fixed several bugs in a few of my other CPAN distros, fired off patches to several others and collaborated on CPAN-YACSmoke with Robert Rothenberg. The plugins for the latter should also be released this week.</p>
