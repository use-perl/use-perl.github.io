<p><P>I've been working on a Google Map and have hit a problem. Creating the map and all the markers has gone really well. The hard part was finding the time to get all the latitude and longitude values. However, now I've created the map and wanted to do something a bit extra. I want to have text below the map with links to the markers on the map. 
<P>If you go to <a href="http://maps.google.com">maps.google.com</a>, and do a search for something like hotels, you get a nice google map and a list of all the hotels as a text frame. When you click on one of the text links, the map is readjusted and pinpoints the associated marker. I want to do something similar, but it's proving rather frustrating as all the howtos about the Google Map API (official and unofficial) don't seem to reference this linking. Or if they do they use a word or phrase that isn't obviously about text links external to the map. 
<P>Anyone have any references to tutorials or howtos about this?</p>

I'm not sure exactly what you mean but
<a href="http://www.redbrick.dcu.ie/user/link/yapc/" title="redbrick.dcu.ie">http://www.redbrick.dcu.ie/user/link/yapc/</a redbrick.dcu.ie> may be some help. Also, double clicking on a point on my map will display the coordinates you need to add the point in question to your map.

Excellent I was looking for this earlier but it's not linked via the Braga site anymore. It's exactly what I was after. Just before I saw your post though I found the following <a href="http://www.econym.demon.co.uk/googlemaps/basic2.htm" title="demon.co.uk">Google Maps API Tutorial</a demon.co.uk> page about it. The bit I was missing was the fact you had to pass the html again to the popup, I was thinking I needed to simulate a click on the marker. The answer is always easier than you expect! Thanks.

if you read the google api page carefully, there is a link to <a href="http://mapki.com/" title="mapki.com">http://mapki.com/</a mapki.com> which includes all links (including that link), code snippets and useful tips ( check the optimization tips )<br><br>I too, trying to use google map in my own project, going to tackle the show all markers in an area task soon. it's been fun
