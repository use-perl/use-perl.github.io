<p>Thought I'd better add something to my journal seeing as I've been very quiet for the last month.
<P>
Work is still bad, trying to cram 5 days into 3 is not fun. As I now have several personal projects on the go too, which has been fun, but very time consuming, I decided it would be better to keep a fairly low profile, thus reducing the potential interruptions from mailing lists and the like.
<P>
It's been sad to see how few Perl jobs there are going in the midlands, even though Java is slowing gaining pace. If QIIS carry on the way they're going then I may have to starting those learn Java books again.
<P>
Gained a couple of new members on the Birmingham Perl Mongers list, and we are starting to advertise on the Linux lists around the midlands, so I hope to have a growing social turnout this year. I wanted to have another technical meeting next month, but what with being innundated with work and stuff I haven't had the time to sort anything out. We'll see how it goes over the next few weeks I guess.
