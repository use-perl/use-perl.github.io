<p>Just managed to arrive home from the tech meet ... after a 3 hour journey home ... Robin should probably home in about 20 minutes.
<P>
4 hours to get there and 3 hours to get home. Many is the time I remember doing the run in 90 minutes. London traffic is getting very messy. A traffic jam on the Western Avenue (A40) going out of London at midnight is just bizarre to us country folk.
<P>
The tech meet itself was great, and my thanks to all the speakers and Mark for organising it. I think the idea of all lightning talks was really well done. Not something for every meeting, but good every once in a while. I did kick myself after Leo's talk though, as I'd written a paging routine over a year ago, that more or less did exactly what Data::Page(set) does. But I didn't think it was useful enough for anyone to use. 
I think over the next few weeks I'll be looking back over some of my code and seeing whether any of those nice little features could be packaged up and reused :)
<P>
Also thanks to everyone who commented on recent events. I just hope that lessons have been learnt from all of it.</p>
