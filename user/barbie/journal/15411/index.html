<p>Something went wrong the other day on Windows box. I have no idea what, but it's caused a big headache. I couldn't get any Perl commands or scripts to run with it crashing, except for 'perl -v'. I had perl 5.8.0 ActivePerl install, and was gearing up to do the CPAN testing that I couldn't do on the 5.6.1 box, due to certain distributions requiring 5.7.0 or higher.
<P>
I ended up removing Perl completely and reinstalling from scratch. Alas whatever caused 5.8.0 to crash is still there, even when I've downloaded a fresh installer from ActiveState. I've managed to get 5.6.1 running, but getting some of the modules reinstalled has been extremely annoying. 
<P>
It appears that modules that once installed with ease, have been "improved" so that the newer versions fail disastrously. The worst offender has been DBD::mysql. I originally used the old Msql-mysql-modules distribution, which installed without a hitch. DBD::mysql just fails. No messages or warnings, just dies. I was wondering whether it required Linux and/or 5.8.0, but according to the docs, there is an ActivePerl version. However, installing via PPM, it comes back saying although a PPD is found it's not for MSWin32-x86-thread-multi. This is more of a fault with PPM than the distribution admittedly, as after several attempts with the same error, Template-Toolkit eventually decided the OpenInteract copy was the correct PPD and installed. Unfortunately several goes at PPM with DBD::mysql have not been as successful.
<P>
Tonight I shall mostly searching <a href='http://backpan.cpan.org'>BackPAN</a> for another go with Msql-mysql-modules!
<P>
In all this I've been getting the impression that a significant number of module authors are not bothering to test modules properly. There has certainly been a growing number of "UNKNOWN" tests that others have raised on CPAN testing too. 
<P>
Another gripe has been Time-modules. The first test fails, as it can't set $ENV{TZ}. It even gives a message saying that this is localtime's problem. If that's the case, why not have a separate test file and skip if it doesn't work. I don't need to set $ENV{TZ} for what I'm doing ... I don't care if it never gets set. The test script is littered with old style testing by printing 'ok 1', etc. To get it to installed I simply by passed the bits that should have been skipped. When I have more time, I shall attempt to bring the test scripts up to date and see if the author is interested.
<P>
If ever I discover what has caused Perl to fail in the first place I shall be wringing it's neck. Hopefully ActiveState will be releasing a new build before too long with all the extra bits that have been added recently.</p>
