<p>Yesterday, the snow stayed long enough for me to take DanDan up onto the <a href='http://www.birminghamuk.com/waseleyhills.htm'>Waseley Hills</a> and go sledging down them. Its a good spot for sledging as the hill is not too steep and runs for a long way.
<P>
The first couple of runs I let him go from about half way up, so he didn't go too far or too fast. I didn't want to scare him. However, even after only a few minutes he was up trying to get a bit higher, so I decided to walk him right to the top. The first full run I went with him, but after that he did it all by himself. He loved it. We only stopped because the snow was starting to melt and sledging on grass is rather difficult. Otherwise I think we would have been walking up the hill all day. 
<P>
The only disappointment was that I forgot my camera. Its not often I do, but I was gutted I didn't capture his first sledging experience. After all, when was it you did something for the first time ?
<P>
