<div class="span8">
<p><p>Following an email about missing licences in Test-CPAN-Meta, I reviewed the spec and realised I'd made a slight error. The spec suggests some of the valid licences out there, but the text for the field 'license' need only contain a string. It doesn't have to be a known licence. As such I tidied up the code a bit and while I was at it, add some functionality that Adam asked me for a couple of months ago.
<p>So yesterday I fixed up both <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Test-CPAN-Meta">Test-CPAN-Meta</a> and <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Test-YAML-Meta">Test-YAML-Meta</a> to include the following:
<ul>
<li>the 'license' field only requires a string,
<li>the licence validating code now returns 1 for a known licence, 2 for an unknown licence and 0 for fail,
<li>meta_yaml_ok() and meta_spec_ok() now return the loaded hashref, if you need it.
</ul>
<p>Regards the latter, Adam wanted to specifically check that a value in the hash was there. Previously there were no additional tests he could perform without loading the file himself. So now it's there if you need it.</p>

I'll test this with tonights release of Parrot 0.6.0.<br/><br/>Regards,

<h2>differences?</h2>

Is the only difference between these two modules the tool used to parse the YAML content of the file?  Having an explanation of that in the POD would be really helpful.  I spent a bit of time squinting at the two of them.

<p>Yes, and Yes<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
</p><p>Test-CPAN-Meta came about due to Adam creating the Parse-CPAN-Meta distribution, which is planned for core status. As such TCM wouldn't need any non-core modules. Originally I was going to let Test-YAML-Meta disappear, but have changed my mind in the event someone wants to specifically use a YAML parser to validate.</p>

<h2>any license is valid?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/rjbs/">rjbs</a> on 2008-03-18T22:29:48</h3>
The "license" entry in META.yml has long stymied me.  The <a href="http://module-build.sourceforge.net/META-spec-current.html#license" title="sourceforge.net">spec </a sourceforge.net> says: "See the Module::Build manpage for the list of valid options."  Unfortunately the link to the manpage is busted.<br><br><a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Module-Build/lib/Module/Build/API.pod" title="cpan.org">Module::Build::API</a cpan.org> seems to provide this list, though.  The wording of the specification is vague, but given that there is a list of valid options, isn't anything else invalid?

...furthermore!  The list from Module::Build::API is unclear.  "apache" isn't qualified, so it's not clear if it means 1.0, 1.1, or 2.0.  GPL and LGPL are also not versioned, but Artistic is.<br><br>Ugh.<p><blockquote> <div><tt>copyright:<br>&nbsp; license:&nbsp; Software::License::Artistic_2_0<br>&nbsp; year: 2008<br>&nbsp; holder: Ricardo Signes</tt></div> </blockquote> Or something, please.

<p>The spec does say look at that link for a list of valid options, but itself only implies that it is required and a string. However, M::B::API states "Valid options include:", thus I've taken that to mean that this is not an finite list, but a starting point. In the resources section there is the ability to list the licence URL, which could be updated from anything listed in M::B::API or my modules. I consider the ones I list internally to be an example rather than set in stone.
</p><p>Unfortunately the discussion regarding the META.yml spec still seems to be stuck on the M::B list, which I personally have no interest in joining. I would prefer to see the spec to be completely independent from any other distribution, thus making it much easier to submit patches, instead of them getting hidden in a RT queue for something else.</p>
