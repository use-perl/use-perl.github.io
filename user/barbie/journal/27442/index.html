<p><P>As <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/barbie/journal/27389">mentioned</a> recently, I'm not able to read email at home at the moment. As a consequence my mail parsing script, which I use for deleting spam as well as relaying/redirecting personal mail to and from work, seems to have developed an unexpected problem. It is now relaying and redirecting everything that is in my POP account, that has already been delivered. I store the messageid of each mail sent, so theoretically it shouldn't be resending, but I wonder if the hash that gets stored (via Storable) has got corrupted and the resulting mess is meaningless. <br/><br/><P>Apologies to anyone who has been affected from me sending too many mails this morning :(<br/><br/><P>Thanks to everyone who responded to my request for suggestions for a new email client. The overwhelm suggestions, both in the comments and elsewhere, has been to go with Mutt and Thunderbird. I've installed both, together with fetchmail and procmail and I'm now in the process of configuring it all. To help me out I found <a href="http://zenii.linux.org.uk/user/telsa/BitsAndPieces/procmailrc">Tesla Gwynne's procmail config file</a> very useful. Now I just need to figure out I get everything to use exim rather than sendmail. </p>
