<p>During the evenings, while sat in our favourite bar on the 'whirl. We got 
treated to the delights of Bob Dylan, Dire Straights, U2 among many others. To
say the boy could play was fine, he could. To say he could sing was stretching the
truth beyond all comprehension. Even when the duo took over they were just as
bad. Simon Cowell on the X Factor often rates people as only worthy for cruise ships.
Believe it or not Simon, those people are far better than those on this cruise
ship!
<P>
On the last night, Marty wanted to do a bit of karaoke. Randal had been 
desperate all week and was extremely disappointed to discover they didn't have a 
karaoke bar at all ... even for one night. Still we cobbled together a few 
requests, nothing too demanding, just Nine Inch Nails' Closer, The Pogues'
Fairytale of New York, as well as a few other well chosen ditties. We never
got to hear Closer, but he did play Pink Floyd's Wish You Were Here, and did
we ever wish we weren't. Then again it was a scream. We all joined in for 
Yesterday by The Beatles and tried to upstage him. However, I think we were 
laughing too much.  
<P>
Come the end of the night, Marty grabbed his laptop and started up some mp3s.
Unfortunately his choice of The Proclaimers, was in my opinion, perhaps the
worst song he could have chosen. He and Anna tried to pull it off, but there
is no way you can make gold from lead. Even if they can sing better than the
cruise singer.
<P>
To escape from the bad singers one night, somebody thought it a wheeze to see
what the cabaret entertainment in the theatre was like. It turned out to be a 
magic show. Well again, saying it was magic would be stretching the truth just
a tad too far, in both senses of the word. For kids it would have been great. 
Even for some adults it was probably fun, but only for the eye-candy. However, 
for anyone with any clue as to how "magic" tricks are done, it was a little 
too obvious in places as to what was happening. Virtually every trick was
straight out of the 'Breaking The Magician's Code' TV series. A couple of the
lads were amazed that the girls could change their costumes so quickly. What
they failed to take into account was that the girls were mostly wearing just
two-piece outfits (occasionally a cape), and were nothing but skin and bones,
thus sliding outfits off and on took seconds. Thankfully when the show was
over, we all thought it wise to head back to the bar. At least the bar/lounge
performers were entertaining.
