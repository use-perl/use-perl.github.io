<p><p>Being a bit of a music fan, I thought I would see who was playing a gig in Houston while I'm at <a href="http://conferences.mongueurs.net/yn2007/">YAPC::NA</a>. I could have seen <a href="http://www.ticketsnow.com/TicketsList.aspx?PID=472080">The Police</a> if I was staying just a little later. But I was intrigued to see <a href="http://www.ticketsnow.com/TicketsList.aspx?PID=485097">Wolfmother</a> will be playing at The Warehouse. Having heard their Woman single played in a recent commercial, I wouldn't mind seeing them. However, seeing as the traditional pre-YAPC meetup happens on the Sunday night too, I probably won't. 
<p>Ticket prices seem a little excessive, but then again I think ticket prices have gotten rather ridiculous over the last 10 years anyway. Once upon a time you'd expect to pay roughly the price of an album to see a live band. These days you could pretty much buy the back catalogues of most bands with the cost of a ticket. I'd liked to have seen Rush again, but at ÃÂ£50 (including fees) a throw, I'd rather wait for the DVD.
<p>
Back in Houston, if you're really feeling nostalgic, you could always go and see <a href="http://www.ticketsnow.com/TicketsList.aspx?PID=475505">Cyndi Lauper</a> on the Sunday night too. Personally I think I'll give that one a miss ;)
