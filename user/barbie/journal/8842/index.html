<p>Sometime ago I used to use a nice little app to access a very popular site. Unfortunately it could only cope with the US version of the site. So when the site branched out around the world and updated it's pages, the nice little app became quickly out of date, and the author gave up trying to update it.
<P>
Since then I've had to manually access the site, which these days isn't so bad, but once upon a time was very time consuming. The nice little app did all the hard work for me.
<P>
It crossed my mind that under the WWW:: namespace on CPAN there might be some modules to do what I want, that is to search and interrogate the site of choice. There is ... sort of. Again the module that I found concentrates on the US site. So with the aid of my new review copy of Perl & LWP I am now learning all about how to do what I want. Hopefully at the end of all this I'll have a plugin interface that can handle whichever international version of the site you want. It's a long shot, but it just might work.
<P>
I was thinking it might take quite a bit of time to get it sorted, but seeing as I'm soon to be in the CFT club, I might even get it finished before Christmas. </p>
