<p>I have just returned from The Perl Whirl, and had a wonderful time with everyone. I'd like to do it all again, but I may have to wait a year or two. Considering the cost, it is certainly value for money, though convincing the boss about going to the Caribbean next year might be a tough call.
<P>
Now that conference season is over, I am now thinking about what to put forward for next year. <a href='http://use.perl.org/user/matts/journal'>Matt</a> usually gets to go to OSCON, so I guess I won't be able to go to that, but YAPC::NA might be worthwhile attending. And as long as YAPC::Europe isn't at the wrong time, I'll be going to that too.
<P>
Next up though is the <a href='http://london.pm.org/lpw/index.html'>London Perl Workshop</a>. Seeing as so many lovely people seem to be going, I'm really looking forward to it. Now that I'm back from the Perl Whirl, I'm looking to sort out a couple of talks. I will probably aim them at the Beginner Track, although they may also be of interest to others. Now that I've finally done a talk in front of conference peeps (in Belfast), I really ought to start doing it more.
<P>
Having seen the talks the guys were doing on the Perl Whirl, I really think I could do a couple of testing talks (or one long one) that would interest people. I might even submit them for the <a href='http://www.geekcruises.com/top/pw05_top.htm'>Perl Whirl</a> next year ;)
<P>
I shall be writing up my notes and sorting through my photos this week, and hope to have them online somewhere by the end of the week. I'll add a link when I do. More asides will no doubt be hitting my blog over the next few days :)</p>
