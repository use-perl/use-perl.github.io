<p>Earlier this year, my father was contacted regarding his old cine-film that he recorded in and around London and whilst on holidays. Some from before I was born up until I was about 10. A production company were looking into creating a TV show that capture the sights and sounds of London from the eyes of regular people. 
<P>
Back in the late 50s and early 60s my father was an avid home movie fan, and regularly took his cine-camera with him. During that time he got married and had me. As anyone who has a Dad who is a fanatic with video cameras will understand, my father filmed constantly whenever we went on trips out or on holiday. He has stacks of films from back then, but alas now in the digital age we can't watch them any more ... until now. As part of the deal the production company are transferring everything on to video for him. Seeing as they don't have a budget to pay him for the movies, I reckon he's got a pretty good deal. Plus he gets the originals back afterwards. 
<P>
A month ago they came up to interview him for the day. He's never been so pampered. He finally got a letter the other day to say when the show will go to air.
<P>
So, if you happen to be in London, or at least within range of the London transmission of ITV, next Sunday, 9th November, at 5.30pm the series <a href='http://www.radiotimes.beeb.com/jsp/frameset/index.html?src=/ListingsServlet?event=10&channelId=26&programmeId=14502994&jspLocation=/jsp/prog_details.jsp'>London's Home Movies</a> starts it's run. <br/><br/>I'm not sure which clips will feature me, although I suspect there might be clips of me with my Granddad in Trafalgar Square feeding the pigeons, and probably holidays on the beach [1]. I'll be intrigued to see the clips of my Dad being interview. His name is Trevor Hughes if you manage to see it ... he's the one that looks like <a href='http://www.tmaw.co.uk/davidj.html'>David Jason</a>.
<P>
[1] There might even be my first meeting with Patsy Kensit. She's 2 years younger then I am, so I guess she must have been about 6 or 7 at the time, and was featuring as Patsy Peapod in a Birds Eye frozen peas advert. My first claim to fame :)<br/><br/></p>
