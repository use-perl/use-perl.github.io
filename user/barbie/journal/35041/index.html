Yesterday a new version of the <a href="http://cpantest.grango.org">CPAN Testers Wiki</a> was uploaded. It includes several bug fixes through previous versions of Labyrinth, as well as a couple of new features.
<p>
The first feature has been on David Golden's annoyance list for some time and it's taken me a while to find a suitable way of doing it. It isn't perfect and I will try and think of a better solution, but when logging in you should be taken back to the previous page you were viewing. It will hopefully at least ease David's frustration at always being taken back to the front page ;)
<p>
The second feature was prompted by David Cantrell's talk at the London Perl Workshop. He popped a rather long URL on the screen to find a particular wiki page. It has been on my todo list for a while to sort that out, so I took some time yesterday to finally just do it. Now you can use the URL of 'http://cpantest.grango.org/wiki/CPANAuthorNotes' to get to the CPANAuthorNotes page and likewise for other basic page views. I will look to extending this further at some point, but for the moment that should help out anyone trying to refer anyone to one of the wiki pages.
<p>
If you spot any problems with the changes, please me know.
