<h1>The YAPC Surveys 2009</h1>

<div class="span8">
<p><p>This year, both <a href="http://yapc10.org">YAPC::NA</a> and <a href="http://yapceurope2009.org">YAPC::Europe</a> are using my survey software to administer the talk and tutorial feedback, as well as the regular Conference Survey. This is the first time I'll have run it for YAPC::NA, so the results are going to be interesting, particularly comparing them against views of both conferences.</p>

<p>The YAPC::NA surveys are currently due to close at the end of this week, but as I haven't had the time to send out reminders, I may well extend that by a week. So if you attended YAPC::NA and haven't submitted a response to the survey, please consider doing so. If you've lost your keycode email, please contact me and I'll sort you out a new one.</p>

<p>The attendees for YAPC::Europe needed no encouragement whatsoever, and the rate of submissions was staggering. Less than a day after the survey was opened in Lisbon, we had nearly as many responses as the YAPC::NA survey in the previous 5 weeks! I get that the Americans might be a little skeptical, but I was hoping for more than the 38% we currently have. YAPC::Europe responses, even after less than a week, are already over 42%! The first YAPC::Europe survey in 2006 received just under 54%, while the 2008 survey received just over 67% response. I'm hoping we can get over 70% this year, which will be fantastic.</p>

<p>The survey software itself is being cleaned up, and I'm hoping to be able to properly Open Source it within the next few months, as there are a lot of smaller workshops and conferences that I think may wish to take advantage of the codebase. While I'm happy to run the YAPC surveys, and collate them on the <a href="http://yapc-surveys.org">YAPC Conference Surveys</a> website, trying to co-ordinate them all for everyone who wanted to operate a similar survey, would be a little too much work. Plus, it might help to get some feedback and patches to improve the surveys for the future.</p>

<p>Thanks to the organisers of YAPC::NA and YAPC::Europe for letting me run the surveys for them, and thanks to everyone who has contributed to the feedback. It all helps to improve YAPCs for everyone for the future.</p>

<p><b>Update:</b> Just to give you some hard numbers...</p>

<h2>10%</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/gizmo_mathboy/">gizmo_mathboy</a> on 2009-08-11T14:39:44</h3>
<p>When I send surveys to my users I'm happy with a 10% response rate. Which I think is the rough standard for surveys. Although a little googling seems to put that number at about 36%. I guess students are just more apathetic.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)</p><p>Of course, different populations are...different. Getting feedback is great and the response rate for both are great in my opinion and YAPC::EU is just astounding.</p>
