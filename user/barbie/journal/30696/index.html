<p><p>8 VERY large boxes arrived yesterday, along with a couple of smaller ones, which go with the 6 other boxes that have arrived over the last few weeks. And there are more to come apparently. I was starting to pile them up in the office, but we've had to move some to the garage so I can get in the office!
<p>I think we now have everything from sponsors to fill the bags, it's just down to us to pack them! Notable mention should go to <a href="http://www.shadowcatsystems.co.uk/">Shadowcat</a> for the excellent bags and the goodies they put inside for everyone. With the collection of goodies we have, I doubt anyone will be disappointed with their swag. And if they are, then that just means more for me ;)
<p>Shadowcat have also donated a rather swish auction item. I'll not reveal it just yet, but suffice to say, I expect there to be some serious bidding for it in the auction.</p>

There's another box on the way (weighs about 8.5 kilos). It contains about 8 books. Due to circumstances, I sent it out friday. The postal clerk claimed it'll take 8 business days so I hope it arrives on time.
