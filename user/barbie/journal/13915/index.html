<p>For those who know me, will know apart from music, Perl and balti's [1], my other interest is board games. In a previous <A HREF="http://use.perl.org/user/barbie/journal/13587">entry</A> of a few weeks ago, I mentioned I attended <a href='http://devel.diplom.org/manorcon/'>ManorCon</a> at Birmingham University. I got roped in to play a game of <a href='http://www.coolgames.com/mfg-cat/soc/0483-00.htm'>Die Siedler</A> and ended up winning. As a result I have discovered that I managed to come 11th in the <A HREF="http://devel.diplom.org/manorcon/res03.htm#DSVC">Die Siedler tournament</A>. There were a few hundred gamers and plenty of games. Providing I don't have other commitments, I'll be up for going next year for the full weekend.
<P>
Having seen the results page, I thought it amusing to note that there were several people who run football teams in a fantasy football league I'm involved with also attended. Pity I've never met them as it might have been useful to set up a few transfer deals :)
<P>
The weekend after YAPC::Europe, I hosted a private games weekend. Unfortunately several who were originally going to attend had birthday parties and weddings to attend. Some of the reserve players also had weddings, christenings and stag nights to attend, so I perhaps hadn't picked the best weekend for it. However, plans had been made and two of guys coming up from London had already taken days off and booked their train tickets, so we went ahead anyway. Most games we played with at least 4 of us, so it wasn't so bad. We got through:

A number of the games were mine that I hadn't had a chance to play yet, which was useful. Hit of the weekend though was Princes of Florence.

You actually got through a game of <i>Kingmaker</i>?  We only played with the expansion (which I think came from an issue of <i>The General</i>) in order to prevent the dreaded "Captain of Calais" stalemate.
<p>
Except for <i>Kingmaker</i>, I haven't played any of the games you've mentioned, though I've heard of a few.  I'm suprised you didn't give <i>Britannia</i> a whirl - it's perfect for 4 players and has a predictable playing time of 3 1/2 to 4 1/2 hours per game.
</p><p>
My other favorites include <i>Republic of Rome</i>, <i>World in Flames</i>, <i>Diplomacy</i> and <i>History of the World</i>.</p>

To be fair we didn't actually finish Kingmaker. I had control of the Lancastrian King, Henry VI (as I'm from that side of the Pennines, being a Yorkist wasn't in the equation), had already killed one of the Yorkists, Edward, and was about to attack Richard in Calais. The second player had crowned Richard, Duke of York, king, had killed the other Yorkist in Wales, George, and was about to attack and kill Margaret who was controlled by the third player. The other Lancastrian, Edward, was sitting in his castle brickin' it.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;) We had to call time, as the London lads had to catch their train.
<p>
Of the games you mention, I only know of Diplomacy, although I haven't played it. Most of the games we played over the weekend are quick 30 - 90 minute games. Quite a mix of styles, trader, building and racing games. The sort that don't take too long to explain the rules and get going. Thanks for the suggestions for more games, I shall look them up.</p>

<i>Republic of Rome</i> is a fun game.  There's lots of diplomacy and backstabbing involved, but everyone can lose if folks can't get along when Hannibal comes calling.  Probably best with 5 players.
<p>
<i>World In Flames</i> is World War II Grand Strategy game.  You're looking at a serious time investment with this one, probably about 4 weekend's worth.
</p><p>
<i>Diplomacy</i> is only good with seven players.  It's one of the few diceless games you'll ever see.  As the name suggests, this one is won or lost at the negotiating table.  This one can also  be played online, with negotiations happening via email and 1 or 2 turns per week.
</p><p>
<i>History of the World</i> is fun, but takes about 5 hours to play.  I heard that it was revamped for the better when Milton Bradley (I think) re-released it, so I can't comment on how it plays now.
</p><p>
Oh, one other one I forgot to mention was <i>Circus Maximus</i>.  Quick playing time, lots of fun.  Combines Roman history, racing and violence.  I suggest watching the chariot scene from <i>Ben Hur</i> to get you in the mood first.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>
