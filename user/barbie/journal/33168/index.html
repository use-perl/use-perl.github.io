<p><p>I note on the YAPC::NA wiki that there are plans for a <a href="http://conferences.mongueurs.net/yn2007/wiki?node=BeersOfTheWorldBOF">Beers Of The World BOF</a>. I remember this being talked about for Chicago, but don't remember it happening. The only event I've seen it work well at was Braga for YAPC::Europe::2005. At the Braga event, virtually every attendee brought a bottle from their home country, and pretty much covered a worldwide selection of beers.

<p>Due to the restrictions these days for carrying liquids on flights, and the risk of getting bottles smashed in the hold, the chances of anyone flying to Houston this year bringing a bottle is pretty unlikely. Particularly if you live outside of the USA. It's definitely a nice idea, but unless you have a local store that imports some absolute delights (Portugal's Super Bock Stout comes to mind), then I'm dubious of 'The World' being as big a selection as it suggests :(

we did have a Beer BOF at last year YAPC::NA. It was one of the best BOF I have ever attended.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br><br>about dozen people showed up. i don't remember the start time (probably 9 or 10pm ) and not do i remember the end time( too many beers<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) . but it was hosted at the dorm's balcony. IIRC, there were beers from U.S, Netherland, and some other countries.. someone even brough their homemade apple cider beer.<br><br>damn the strict fly regulation, it was probably the last real WORLD beer BOF..<br><br>too bad you missed it..

<h2>Change the name?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jfluhmann/">jfluhmann</a> on 2007-05-02T04:09:20</h3>
<p>Maybe we can change the name to something else and meet at a local brewery.  A quick search turned up the following:
</p><ul>
  <li> <a href="http://www.saintarnold.com/" title="saintarnold.com">Saint Arnold Brewing Company</a saintarnold.com> </li>
  <li> <a href="http://www.bjsbrewhouse.com/" title="bjsbrewhouse.com">BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse</a bjsbrewhouse.com></li>
  <li>...and a few others that didn't have sites</li>
</ul>

<p>Nah, keep it. It carries on the tradition. Plus an organised trek to a brewery isn't likely to get as many recruits as a excuse to sit around and chat with an unusual beer.
</p><p>Although what I know of American beers they are desperately in short supply of a good dark beer or stout. At least I did find Guinness<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)</p>
