<p><p>A short post to say thanks to all the speakers and attendees who made this year's YAPC::Europe so worthwhile doing. We've had some good feedback and we now have some good thoughts and suggestions for future organisers. 
<p>A number of people have been inspired enough to get involved with local Perl Monger groups and <a href="http://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=570867">at least one is being created</a>, and hopefully the newcomers will get the chance to come to further Workshops and YAPCs, which for me is always a part of the aims of a YAPC. While many of us attending YAPCs are part of the community, there are several that aren't and it's nice to be able to show them it's worthwhile staying involved.
<p>Yesterday and today I am extremely tired, but it feels like I've been on tour again, which always gives me a great buzz. It was a lot of hardwork putting this together, with the occasional frustration at times (especially finding a venue), but the results seemed to have been well received, so we must have got most things right.
<p>Expect some further announcements for numbers, finances and the like over the coming months, but for the moment we'll probably be taking a well earned rest.
<p>Some people have been asking about the finances, and at the moment it's difficult to give exact figures. We do know that the auction made just under ÃÂ£3000, which is excellent. However, being a limited company we have to get our books in order before we know exactly how much we can donate elsewhere. After that we'll have a clearer picture of what funds will be going where. However, I think TPF and the organisers of YAPC::Europe::2007 will be plesantly surprised with the contributions we'll be making. 
<p>Looking forward to my trip to Vienna next year :)</p>
