<p>The other day I had a bit of play with <a href='http://search.cpan.org/author/IDORU/WWW-UsePerl-Journal-0.11/lib/WWW/UsePerl/Journal.pm'>WWW::UsePerl::Journal</a>. Unfortunately the box I was on didn't have a web browser (we were on a course so it was just a basic Linux box, sans gimmicks), so couldn't read use.perl directly. Thankfully it did have a network connection to the outside world. So CPAN.pm was my friend.
<P>
Installed WWW::UsePerl::Journal and had a play. discovered that the listing of ids/titles is slightly broken. On further investigation discovered the line:
<P><code>
        foreach (sort keys %entries) {
</code>
<P>which isn't very clever. A quick fix and a bit of added functionality I could list ascending or descending ids/titles at will :) However, it doesn't have comment stuff in there yet. So started adding that. Now have half a patch and half a new module. Planning to send them to the module author, when I get time, and see if he wants to add them to his distribution.
<P>
Mind you I should really finish my third talk for Birmingham.pm. Maybe later...</p>

<h2>Patches welcome!</h2>

Great, yeah, send me the patch.<br> <br>I don't use the module now, so I haven't been doing anything to it. I plan to use the SOAP interface instead of the horrible kludgy scraping that's going on now, but I don't think you can access the comments that way...<br> <br>I ought to write a wee script to output RSS, then I might start using the module again...

It'll probably be next week now, as I have talks to write and present this week.
<p>
A handy module to know though, it kept me amused for a couple days during my qmail course<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>
