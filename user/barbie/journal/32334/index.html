<p><p><a href="http://perl.grango.org/">CPAN Testers Statistics</a> updated for January 2007.
<p>A lot of checking of stats went on this month, as quite a few reports got discarded due to the format of the subject line not being correct for CPAN Testers and CPAN Statistics parsing tools to disassemble. A few uploads also suffered the same fate. The problem is that the reports need to have the distribution name and version, not a module name and not just the distribution name, otherwise the parsing tools are unable to gauge the correct CPAN entry which they should be associated with. In the case of PASS reports this is often the only reference to the distribution name and version in the whole report. Thankfully, these kinds of faulty reports number in single figures most months, but this month we did have quite a few. 
<p>We also had a few new email addresses popup, although some are for already existing testers, who have just changed their address. We're getting closer to the 1000 testers mark, but there are still over 500 addresses that I haven't been able to assign to anyone. It would be nice to find out who everyone is, but seeing as several are from years ago, I doubt I'll be able to track those down. Still I'll keep plugging away.
<p>And finally, as predicted last month, Chris Williams leaves a <a href="http://perl.grango.org/testers.html">smoking trail</a> behind him, as he surges a long way into the lead for the number of test reports posted. In <a href="http://perl.grango.org/mtesters.html">January 2007</a> alone he posted 10158 reports, the highest anyone has posted in a single month. Chris really deserves a lot of credit for the effort he has put into CPAN Testing, as most of us simply test one version of perl on one specific platform. A few people have been testing with multiple perls and platforms, but I think Chris currently has the most broad testing with around 12 different platform/perl combinations. However, don't be put off even if you're only able to test one platform/perl combination, as all CPAN Testing is useful. Thanks to all the CPAN Testers for taking the time to submit their reports.
<p>Next month I'll see if I can produce any more "interesting" stats from all this data :) </p>
