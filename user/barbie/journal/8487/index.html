<p>At last I've managed to organise another Technical Meeting for the Birmingham Perl Mongers. This time around it's just us and no guests. I did approach Dave Cross, but unfortunately he's on holiday, though he did say he'd love to come and do a talk for us, so at least I have our major star attraction lined up for next time :)
<P>
Seeing as we have a bit of an increase in the membership, I thought it would be good to get a comparison between members who turn up for technical and social meetings. So far it's been pretty much the same, with just a couple of extra people coming along to the technical meetings (then again we've only done one so far so it's not a great comparison).
<P>
I was hoping to have a technical meeting next month, but it might be a bit too soon to get more talks together. I have to get back in touch with Jono Bacon (KDE man for the UK, who lives in Wolverhampton), and see if he's free. There have been a few emails back from the leaders of Linux groups round these parts, so it might be an idea to actually join up and let them know we are more than happy for them to come along too. As well as getting a few more speakers sorted.
<p>
I now have 4 talks to prepare (2 for this tech meet, 1 for next time and 1 for a YAPC::Europe submission next year), which for anyone who knows me well is a bit bizarre, as I hate being in the spotlight. 
<P>
If you're in the area and feel like dropping by, we'll be at QIIS HQ (about 10mins walk from the train station) on Wednesday 23rd October from around 6.30pm to 9.30pm. Details are on the website [<a href="http://birmingham.pm.org/docs/technical-next.html">Meetings Page</a>], if you need more help finding us.</p>
