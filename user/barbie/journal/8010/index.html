<p>Still going through debriefing and having the embarrassing wait of my laptop's power supply. Thankfully it's currently winging it's way to Birmingham thanks to Norbert, who I now many drinks to say thank you.
<P>
This year's conference was a blast, and when I finally get my laptop up and running again I'll added my twopennarth to my journal. However, some great talks, some great company, new friends and lots of beer. Having had a look at some of the photos coming out of the woodwork I've been surprised at how many I'm on! Must be just the rock 'n' roll slut that I am :)
<P>
Got to do a bit of coding while at the conference, but my attempt at causing Leon grief with yet another Acme module before his talk, Acme::Barbie, was a bit pathetic so I didn't bother. I do have a germ or an idea for what it could be, but better wait until I have something decent up first.
<P>
Plans are afoot for another Birmingham technical meeting, so hopefully I'll get something together for a look at what happened while I was there.
<P>
Good News is that all my plugging of the Test modules and Schwern's test suite talks, is likely to pay off. Firstly as we are getting a training budget we might get to go to London and Belfast for technical talks, as well as next years YAPC::Europe. Would be nice if they stumped the cost of OSCON, but I doubt it. Secondly they want me to put forward a plan to completely cover the writing of test scripts in Perl for the whole intranet system. No mean feat, but it will be worth it in the end. If it happens I think I'll be sending O'Reilly another success story, which reminds me I really ought to get the company to agree to sending the current one I have.
<P>
... And we have 2 new recuits to the mailing list ... yeah!</p>
