<p>The road formerly referred to as 'The Birmingham Northern Relief Road', <a href='http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/staffordshire/3298789.stm'>opens today</a>. All being well it should make my journeys up to Manchester and Cheshire a lot easier.

<P>
Do they serve it in a gold cup or something? Aside from the fact I can't stand coffee, justifying the cost against extortionate prices for a beverage is hardly a good comparison.</p>

<p>I've not had the dis(pleasure) of needing to drive a long distance along a motorway recently, but I think that the price of tea is now over &#163;1.50 in most of them. From memory, coffee was usually slightly more. I don't remember gold cups (actually, I don't even remember decent bone china cups), so I suspect the price is partly because they have a captive audience (where else do you get tea on a motorway), but partly because their costs are high. However, all this justification of extortion reminds me of <a href="http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2002-01/msg00859.html" title="mpe.mpg.de">Schwern's explanation of the cost of the POSIX standard.</a mpe.mpg.de> </p>

I find it so sad that prices for such a simple thing have escalated so high. In a regular truckstop cafe, of which I know a few along the Manchester to London route (which I travelled more times than I can remember), 50p-75p is a more normal price. Admittedly the Motorway services do have a captured audience and theoretically there is more hotwater in the metal container, but it's a bit pointless when half of it ends up on the floor.
<p>
Their costs are not as high as you might think. The ex-singer of Ark used to work for Granada Services and staggered us by the amount of profit they make a day. I wish I had exact figures, but it was serveral thousands of our English pounds.
</p><p>
Still that's business, and if they didn't have a market, they wouldn't be able to charge those prices. I rarely eat or drink in motorway services anymore. It's much cheaper to go to the petrol station instead.</p>

From the <a href="http://www.m6toll.co.uk/" title="m6toll.co.uk">website</a m6toll.co.uk>, The standard toll will be 3 quid - two is just the introductory offer.<br> <br>
Fortuantely for me I use rail and bike - easily the best way to get around the west midlands, a centro card costing &#163;63.50 a month, which gives me access to all buses and trains ( bikes travel free on local services ), works out at about &#163;3 per working day.<br> <br>
Pity any drivers having to fork out 3 quid to get home from work while crufts is on though.
