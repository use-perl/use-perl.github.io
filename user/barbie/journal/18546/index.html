<p><P>It seems the internet faltered last night, as just before we began the <a href='http://birmingham.pm.org'>Birmingham Perl Mongers</a> technical meeting several routes to servers died. Brian couldn't get access to the Birmingham Uni servers, and I could get access to the pm.org server in the US, where my slides were hosted. Unfortunately neither Brian nor I thought we'd need to make backup copies (I usually have a copy on my laptop just in case!). The one time I don't do a copy and everything goes for a burton. 
<P>Thankfully, Arnaud created an SSH tunnel through his box and we managed to access the Birmingham Uni servers, so Brian could still do <a href='http://birmingham.pm.org/talks/moregems/intro.html'>his talk</a>. However, we still couldn't get any communication going with the pm.org server. Having tried several times this morning the pm.org server was still down, and didn't surface until Lunchtime today :(
<P>So my talk has been postboned until next month. Brian put on a great show, and extended his talk with lots more explanations than he was originally planning, which made for a very interesting talk. He's now thinking of submitting to YAPC ... by Friday!
<P>Big thanks to Brian and Arnaud.</p>
