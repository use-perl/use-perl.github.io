<p>So I've now being using <a href='http://birmingham.pm.org/modules/Mail-File-0.03.tar.gz'>Mail::File</a> with much delight, as I can now number myself among the <a href='http://testers.cpan.org/'>CPAN testers</a>. I have created a directory within the distribution, with docs and code, showing how to do automated testing with the module. I've even included some of the scripts I use on Windows to do the additional reading of an Outlook Inbox folder to figure out which modules to test. And now I'd like to upload it to CPAN. However, I'm not sure the name is quite appropriate. Suggestions welcome.
<P>
I was thinking last night about my Mail::Outlook module. It works and does the original job I intended it too, which was to send mail via Outlook. However, it crossed my mind that perhaps I ought to extend it so it can hide all the M$ API stuff and get messages from other mail folders, etc via a nice OO interface.
<P>
The X-Header stuff is proving awkward as it needs to use events within Outlook to capture the message before it hits the Exchange. Plus some of the research I've done leads me to wonder whether the Exchange server handles the X-Headers. The .oft file I found on the net doesn't work with the latest versions of Outlook, as it appears it was using a loop hole that has now been closed.
<P>
I'm also going to investigate writing Mail::Outlook::Express, perhaps even rewriting Mail::Outlook to act as a base class with the guts specific to either the Express or Exchange versions that are available or requested.</p>

Use an SMTP server?

Mail::File? Because that requires a network connection<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
<p>
Mail::Outlook? Because it seemed like a good idea at the time.</p>
