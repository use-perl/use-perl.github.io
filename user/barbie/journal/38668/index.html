<p>2009 QA Hackathon Update - 19th March 2009

<p>Dear All,</p>

<p>Welcome to this week's update for the <a href="http://qa-hackathon.org">2009 QA Hackathon</a>.</p>

<p><b>ATTENDANCE - FULL</b></p>

<p>Just so everyone knows we now have a full attendance. We have 24 people who have confirmed their attendance, with 1 runner and 3 ad-hoc developers to help the other 20 developers. Due to our capacity limits at the venue, unfortunately we cannot accommodate any more attendees.</p>

<p><b>SPONSORSHIP &amp; FUNDING</b></p>

<p>As we mentioned in our last update, we haven't had as much sponsorship and funding as we would have liked. We're exceptionally grateful to our current sponsors, who between them have helped us keep largely to our budget. However, we still need a small amount of funding to cover the additional venue costs. If your company would be willing to help fund us, please get in touch, even if you're only able to offer a small amount. Every little counts.</p>

<p><b>TRAVEL GUIDE &amp; MAP</b></p>

<p>For those unfamiliar with how to get here, please see the Directions Guide [1] or the Hackathon Map [2] to find your way around the city centre, from both the airport and train stations.</p>

<p><b>TRAVEL</b></p>

<p>For those planning on taking the train from London, please update the London Travel Team [3] page, with your travel plans, so you can all meet and travel at the same time. For those travelling by air, please add your flight details where applicable to the Air Arrivals [4] and Air Departures [5] pages. </p>

<p><b>EVENING PLANS</b></p>

<p>For each evening during the hackathon, we are planning to book a table at a few different local restaurants. We'll aim to eat at about 7pm, then head to a nearby pub for a few drinks, before heading back to the hotel bar for a nightcap. Please note that all the evening food and drinks will not be covered by the QA HAckathon budget..</p>

<p>As we are expecting all hackathon attendees to join us, we have already included their names in the lists for each evening. However, if there is anyone in or near Birmingham that would like to join us on any of the nights, please add your name (and anyone with you) to the appropriate page by Monday 23rd March, 12:00 UTC, so we know how many people we need to book tables for.</p>

<p>For the full list of page links see the Evening Events [6] page.</p>

<p><b>QUESTIONS</b></p>

<p>If you have any further questions, please email us at organisers@qa-hackathon.org.</p>

<p><b>THANKS</b></p>

<p>Many thanks to our sponsors who have donated funds to help us put on the event, Birmingham Perl Mongers for underwriting the whole event, to Dijkmat for sponsoring Michael Peters' attendance, $foo Magazin and Nestoria for providing event funding and to PROCURA B.V. and Booking.com for funding their employees to attend.</p>

<p>More news soon...</p>

<p>Thanks,<br />
The 2009 QA Hackathon Organisers.</p></p>
