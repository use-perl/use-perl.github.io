<p><p>
Looking at the YAPC::Europe::2006 <a href="http://www.birmingham2006.com/cgi-bin/yapc.pl?act=user-stats">statistics page</a>, I note that all the bidders to host next year's YAPC::Europe all only sent one representative. Where they all planning to do it alone? There was definitely a healthy spread of user group representation this year, and at least a new one is being created by some attendees.
<p>
The last 7 YAPC::Europe hosts took up the top 11 places in the groups list. Copenhagen.pm are right up there, and have been bidders before, so hopefully they're still thinking about it. Lisbon.pm are getting in some practice with their Perl Workshop next year, so we might see a bid from them in 2008. 
<p>
But the one that cheers me up no end, is to see MiltonKeynes.pm comfortably sitting in 8th place. So will we see a return of YAPC::Europe to the UK in the not too distant future? Will Tom and his gang host an extended technical meeting to rival Birmingham.pm? Will they pretend to cancel at the last minute to try and get their own back on the 2006 hosts? We shall just have to wait and see ;^)
<p>
Personally I wouldn't mind seeing Berlin.pm winning, and should have asked tinita to consider bidding. I've had several near misses at getting to go to Berlin on various band tours, but they all fell through for some reason or other. Maybe I'll just have to follow Thomas' lightning talk suggestion and just plan a visit anyway. With flights getting ridiculously cheap to certain European destinations at the moment, it's no more expensive than getting to London these days!</p>

Actually we were two folks from vienna.pm (but I might have missed to fill that<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.pm text box). Tomorrow we'll have the next yapc::2007 meeting<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)

<p>That'll be why<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
</p><p>It was interesting to see that small groups were still interested in hosting the conference. Normally it's been groups that have sent a largish attendance to the conferences that have bid for it. Although having said that all you guys are veteran yapc attendees so perhaps that makes up for it<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
</p><p>Good luck with the meeting, you have a lot of work ahead of you. Try and get as much as you can done early so you're not rushing towards the end. It made life alot easier for us.</p>
