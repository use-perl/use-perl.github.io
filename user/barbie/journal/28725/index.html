<p><P>Since creating the <a href='http://perl.grango.org/'>CPAN Testers Statistics</a> site, I've been meaning to add an extra page. Today I got around to it.
<P>Have a look at <a href='http://perl.grango.org/matrix.html'>The Matrix</a> page. It details the number of reports created against the platform and version of Perl. I've only done it for the last month of stats, but may extend it in the future.
<P>It highlights the platform/Perl combinations that do/don't get tested. If anyone has been wondering whether it's worth getting involved, they can now see a little clearer what areas are distinctly lacking.
<P>If you have any further thoughts for improvements, let me know.</p>

&lt;blatant-promo&gt;<br>If anyone has got some time (rather than hardware) to contribute and would like to do so by rolling virtual test images of various perl platforms (rather than physical boxes of various perl platforms) please drop by irc.perl.org #pita and help us work on CPAN Testers 2.0 (ugh).<br>&lt;/blatant-promo&gt;<br>&lt;br&gt;<br>I'm particularly interested in talking to someone who can set up operating systems to have multiple versions of perl installed on it.

<p>David Langren has all the Perl releases of 5.8.x on Linux, which he uses to run CPAN testing. I'm certainly interested in PITA, but mailing lists are better for me to be involved in discussions. I've been trying to get PITA running on Windows (5.6.1), but unfortunately I've had problems with prerequisites. I've ended up posting several RT tickets this week<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:(</p>

Ditto with the dependencies.<br><br>Now we have Vanilla Perl, I'm slowly churning through bugs in dependencies so we can announce it more properly.<br>

Hi,<br/><br/>Maybe i'm missing something - it all seems too easy, if you could shine a torch on my ignorance it would be much appreciatted?

For a few years now i've been religously adding new users to my linux box when a new project comes along - after which I install into the new home dir ( as the user ) apache, mod_perl, perl etc before beginning any work. It keeps the whole thing clean and is pretty pain free, and its pretty simple too. I've only been using one version of perl in all the different areas, but unless there is somekind of prereq hell I've managed to be lucky enough to avoid
I wouldn't imagine it to be too difficult to set up different versions.
