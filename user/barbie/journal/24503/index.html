<p>I've no idea what has happened, but all the mail to the mailing lists I'm on, as of Saturday morning, have failed to reach my mailbox. I have done look ups on some blacklists and none seem to mention my domain or the IP it references. There are possibly some personal emails that have failed to get through too.
<P>
If it was just one set of mailing lists, I could reasonable expect a setting on a mail server wasn't resolving the domain correctly. However, all the lists, including Perl, Linux and various music lists all seem to have stopped dead. As I get them sent to my work address, I know there has been mail sent to them. There must be a reasonable answer to this, but for the life of me I can't think of it :(
<P>
Unless it gets fixed soon, I may well have to start using my cpan.org email address instead.<br/><br/><P>
<b>Update:</b> I think someone must be reading my journal. In the last few minutes a torrent of email has just hit my ISP's mail server. It appears to contain all the backlog from Saturday morning too, thankfully. Seeing as my test mails were getting through, as well as a trickle of spam, I can only guess that a mail server died over the weekend at my ISP, and they've only just turned it back on and fixed the problem.</p>
