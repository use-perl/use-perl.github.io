<p>I wonder if its a coincidence that some of the key players looking after CPAN have travelled to Portland this weekend, on the same weekend that CPAN has not been behaving very well.
<P>
Over the weekend http://search.cpan.org/ was non-existant, and today the search mechanism is returning "No matches", even when looking via Author the modules/distributions are there.
<P>
Maybe CPAN has a cob on because it's masters are having fun :)</p>

<p>Some of us just like to have weekends now and then.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) PAUSE was down for a while which was why CPAN appeared to by out of date and the place where search is hosted had a power maint window causing a little downtime. Graham rebuilt the WAIT index to fix the searching bits that were broken as well.</p>

Normally I wouldn't have noticed, but I happened to be answering questions on a techy board and wanted to point the questioners at loads of cool modules. It just amused me to think CPAN might be pouting cause it's masters where off having fun<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
