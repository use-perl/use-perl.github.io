First off, congratulations!
<p>
May I ask the origin, meaning and pronunciation of "Ethne"?</p>

Its a bit of a long story, but it started from a mispronunciation of the spelling 'Eithne'. When Nicole found out that was pronounced 'Enya' (as in the singer), she didn't like it at all. Everyone in the family liked the pronunciation we'd used, so Nicole did a bit of research and found that the pronunciation we'd been using was 'Ethne' (EH-th-nee).
<p>
The origin of the name is Irish, or <a href="http://www.wordlookup.net/go/goidelic-mythology.html" title="wordlookup.net">Goidelic</a wordlookup.net> of Celtic origins, and is the name of a Irish goddess. Googling we found a <a href="http://www.pantheon.org/articles/e/ethne.html" title="pantheon.org">few</a pantheon.org> <a href="http://www.maryjones.us/jce/ethne.html" title="maryjones.us">references</a maryjones.us>, but once we discover girls being name it in more recent times too, we felt more comfortable calling her that.
</p><p>
I originally knew a girl called Ethne, although I'd always thought it was spelt Eithne, when I was a Cov Uni, and it had always struck me as being a nice name. Last year when we thinking of girls names, for some reason I thought of it again, and everyone loved it straight away. Towards the end of the pregnancy Nicole was more annoyed at me for refusing to think of a boys name ("just in case"), as due to family birth patterns, I'd been convinced we were going to have a girl as soon as I knew Nicole was pregnant.
</p><p>
Since calling her Ethne, we've been surprised to discover several people have known an Ethne at some point in time. Just the one though<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... and now two<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)</p>
