<p>I like <a href='http://search.cpan.org/dist/Class-Phrasebook/'>Class::Phrasebook</a>, but yesterday discovered a major flaw in my liking for it. It uses XML. Now in and of itself, that isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it needs expat to work. For my own stuff that's fine. However, on the distribution I was creating for work this became a stumbling block yesterday. Installing loads of new apps wasn't seen as a good thing, quite rightly too.
<P>
I've now rewritten a very basic C::P into a Phrasebook module that works on .ini files, via another favourite module <a href='http://search.cpan.org/dist/Config-IniFiles/'>Config::IniFiles</a>. It works, but it doesn't have anywhere near the support for debugging, etc that C::P gives you. It crossed my mind whether it would be worth expanding the module to more or less support everything that C::P (debugging, whitespacing, etc) does and release to CPAN. I then had to wonder what to call it. Class::Phrasebook::Ini might make people think it relies on C::P, which it doesn't. But Config::IniFiles::Phrasebook might be an idea.
<P>
I should really get approval from the boss first, seeing as I wrote it for and at work, but I'm sure it won't be a problem. It's nice to think of a useful module for a change. 
<P>
Thought for the month. Have you noticed more Games:: modules appearing? I'm guilty too, but it made me wonder is Games:: the new Acme::?</p>

<h2>Work together?</h2>

Why not contact the C::P author and propose that C::P be rewritten to accomodate multiple storage backends?

<p>I also didn't like C::P, so I wrote <a href="http://dellah.org/svn/perl/Phrasebook/" title="dellah.org">Phrasebook</a dellah.org> which is vaguely more flexible and uses YAML by default.</p>

<p>It's not on CPAN because I can't think of a good name for it and I don't think it's good enough to deserve the Phrasebook namespace.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://dellah.org/perl/Phrasebook-0.16.tar.gz" title="dellah.org">download tarball</a dellah.org>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Its been serving well internally.</p>
