<p>Birmingham.pm had a technical talk last night. Lots of good stuff, tons of cool stuff (mainly from Rich), some interesting stuff and some broken thoughts (mainly from me).
<P>
Due to my lack to time given to prepare notes and spell check, there were a few errors in my slides, along with a bit of a flow problem in a couple. Having time to run through them before hand is always a good thing. I had to drop my third talk, More LWP, as I just didn't have the time to write it. We managed to talk for two hours though.
<P>
Rich's two talks went down very well, especially the Device::Ericsson::AccessoryMenu one. Complete with XBlast competition via mobile phone :) Siesta looks like it's coming along well, they just need to finish it now.
<P>
JJ's talk on the R in Perl was well done, including the bit of how to annoy non-Perl programmers.
<P>
My talks prompted some discussion and ideas, which was the main reason I wanted to do them, so I got the result I wanted, even though I could have done with presenting them a bit better. Still food for thought and perhaps once I've had time to look deeper into the CGI Parameters Validation talk I might be able to present it to London.pm or even a YAPC next year. We'll see.</p>
