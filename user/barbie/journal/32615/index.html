<p>A bit late this month as I've been trying to map lots of new addresses to real people. I'll be sending out an other survey type mail soon, so hopefully that'll help to reduce the unknown addresses in the coming months.
<p>In the meantime, Chris has once again been an amazing contributor to CPAN testing and is further extending his lead on the top testers page. A worthy mention to Dave Cantrell, who after only 1 month as a CPAN Tester already finds himself in position 20. Dave has been a great help to many authors already, as it would seem he is the most significant tester of Perl 5.6.2, and has found a few problems that would otherwise have been missed by the looks of it.
<p>Last month was also the highest recorded submissions of reports to CPAN Testers. While Chris and Dave have undoubtably made notable quantities of submissions, a big thank you to everyone else who has submitted a report. Even just submitting 1 or 2 reports helps, so please don't feel you have to compete with the dedicated testers. Keep up the good work folks.</p>

<p>Great to have some competition!</p>

<p>For those that want to watch <i>perl.cpan.testers</i> in virtual real-time I have set up #cpantesters channel on irc.perl.org network. GumbyNET2 bot is announcing uploads and test reports as and when they happen.</p>

... it would be interesting on site to show the top 10 worst (most FAILs) distributions<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

<p>That shouldn't be too difficult to do. I'll have a look for next month, depending whether I can find the time! March has turned into a very busy month as I have several talks to prepare<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... including how to be a CPAN Tester<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)</p>
