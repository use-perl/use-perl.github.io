<p><P>A couple of weeks ago, JJ, Phil and I went up to Edinburgh for their <a href="http://edinburgh.pm.org/">Perl Monger</a> social meeting. I finally got to meet <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/rrwo/">Rob Rothenberg</a>, as well as a couple other members of the group. Apparently there are normally a few more, but I think I might have scared them off, when I mentioned Phil has spiky pink hair!
<P>We had a good night and the talk flowed around Perl, to several other things. We talked a little about the forthcoming YAPC::Europe, and I think we managed to persuade them all to come and visit us. I have only just been able to get <a href="http://birmingham.pm.org/album/106">photos online</a> as our server has been offline. I really like Edinburgh and it was a shame that Phil and I had such an early start to get back. Next time I think we'll probably plan a couple of days and also head up to <a href="http://aberdeen.pm.org/">Aberdeen</a> too, which may work out quite nicely as they appear to be planning their socials for the Thursday after Edinburgh meets :)
