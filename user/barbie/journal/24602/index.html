<p>I have about 5 talks to prepare. Seeing as Toronto is perhaps the closest, I sat down to write the talks I'm doing for YAPC::NA. It seemed like hard work to begin with, but seeing as I had already got some notes on both, I started with those. Pretty soon I had virtually finished both. Today I'm pleased to say I have tidyied up the loose ends and have two talks prepared. So far so good
<P>
The next step is a little more tricky. I don't do PowerPoint or any other fancy presentation application. I like HTML. I have a simple script that uses Template Toolkit and some templates to produce my slides. The hard part is getting hold of the new MessageLabs branding layouts and images so that I can respectably present the talks with them. Seeing as MessageLabs are paying for the trip, I don't think it would be very good using my usual Birmingham.pm layouts. Unfortunately we have only just changed the branding and they are not producing a HTML friendly pack of images, etc. It's either PowerPoint or nothing. Alledgely PowerPoint can save to HTML, so a PowerPoint enabled user is going to see if they can grab the images for me.
<P>
Thankfully the branding images and layout are quite easy on the eye. I just wish they could think about those of us who don't do the corporate thang. PowerPoint is an application not a standard :(</p>

Surely, by making the "corporate standard" layout hard to work with, they have released you from any obligation to use it.
