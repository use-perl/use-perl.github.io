<p>I've been looking through my notes from Paris last week, and got to Elaine's talk on <a href='http://yapc.mongueurs.net/yapc/talk/?tid=73'>CPAN</a>. She mentioned some interesting additional files, that are not so widely used or known about. A couple I already knew of, but it crossed my mind that I only knew of them from either the <a href='http://www.cpan.org/misc/cpan-faq.html'>CPAN FAQ</a> or from the odd reference here and there. I've just had a look at the CPAN FAQ and only the <a href='http://www.cpan.org/modules/04pause.html'>PAUSE FAQ</a> one is mentioned.
<P>
Seeing as you can't do a directory listing on /modules, etc I wonder is there a page which lists all the additional files, or do you just have to hear about them from blogs, monks and talks?
<P>
For those not familiar with these additional files they all start with a 2 digit number, such as 01mailrc.txt.gz, 02package.details.txt.gz, 04pause.html or 01modules.mtime.html. It would be nice to have a page that lists and perhaps gives a brief description of these additional files though.</p>

<p>I could have sworn that the <a href="http://www.cpan.org/CPAN.html" title="cpan.org">CPAN.html</a cpan.org> listed them but it doesn't. Since CPAN is still at heart an FTP archive some bits haven't been brought along for the web since we forget that they aren't visible via the web unless you know what you're looking for. I'll add a note to add those in with the next FAQ update and if I can't add it to the<nobr> <wbr></nobr><a href="http://www.cpan.org/modules/" title="cpan.org">/modules page</a cpan.org> I'll ask Jarkko to.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) I'm glad you got something out of the talk and flattered you managed to stay awake through it. The slides will be in PDF format in my CPAN dir sometime later today, too, if I don't melt from the heat first.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

Brilliant. I was trying to figure out where it might be best to list them, probably in CPAN FAQ or as a separate page, with a link under the FAQ headings. I've never had cause to use the FTP directly, as installation is handled by CPAN.pm or CPANPLUS.pm for me these days.
<p>
I actually found your talk quite informative. It's nice to have some history and the like about how it all came together. Talks like this I always pick up some hidden gems, as for one reason or another, there is always something that gets tucked away and forgotten about. It's like clearing out the attic and suddenly finding the old school books and poems/lyrics you wrote years ago.

I look forward to seeing the PDF. Thanks<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>
