<p><p><a href="http://use.perl.org/article.pl?sid=08/05/17/0943225">This is simply awesome</a>. <p>For sometime there has been discussion that the corporate world needs to recognize its use of Perl and contribute to its continued development. I know there have been several corporate contributions in the past, but the majority of donations more recently has come from small companies and individuals, for whom the contributions have been a very notable amount. I'm not sure whether Firebird Management LLC would be classed as a corporate, but it would be wonderful to see others following their lead.

<p>The Perl community is indebted to all those involved in the discussions, and I for one, am looking forward to seeing the fruits of this donation. Brilliant, just brilliant.</p>

<h2>It's not corporate</h2>

I also thought it was from Firebird, but it's not.  It's from Ian Hague directly, who happens to be a co-founder of Firebird.

Blimey, even more respect than was already due.

<h2>Kudos</h2>

<p>A generous as Google and others have been in the past, this is a momentous event for the Perl community.</p>

<p>I know many people work very hard on Perl (5.x and 6.x) but there is very little money backing it up and I hope that this donation helps to keep things moving and doesn't cause any problems like Debian's Dunc-tank.</p>
