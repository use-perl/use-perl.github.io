<p><B>Friday</B>. Today was a full day at sea, and as a consequence a 12 hour 
session of talks (minus lunch and coffee breaks). I started with Marty's 
'Template Toolkit for Non-Web Applications' talk. There was some good ideas 
here, and some cool tricks with TT that he highlighted, even writing Java code. 
However, in retrospect it might have been better to go deeper with TT, 
especially seeing as one of the authors of the Badger book was on board, and do
a more involved talk on TT. But having said that, it should be noted that Marty
does some great rants during his talks, and this was no exception. In fact the 
rants actually spawn some interesting ideas and examples. For the afternoon 
session I attended Dave's 'Tieing and Overloading Objects in Perl' talk. Some 
of this I had already seen, but the tie-ing side of things did help to clarify 
some misunderstandings I had of tie. His example with Tie::Hash::Cannabinol,
which works on so many levels, proved very illuminating :) The evening session 
featured a PHP Q&A by Rasmus Lerdorf and a look at Perl 6 by Larry Wall. As 
always Larry is both off-the-wall and entertaining with his presentation, 
especially dressed in his red tuxedo for the second formal dinner later. For
dinner that night, 8 of us (Marty & Karen, Casey, Robert, Allison, Geneva Wall, 
Dave and myself) decided to go up to the more exclusive restaurant. Ted T'so 
and his partner also had the same idea. Geneva couldn't face eating her 
lobster, so named him Fidel and placed him in a glass. The waiters looked on 
very bemused. We headed down for drinks. Once they closed our bar (at 2am) we 
headed to the Casino bar with Randal and some Norwegians. Randal invented a new
drink entitled the Schwartzian Transform.
<P>
<B>Saturday</B>. Today was the last day of talks. I took on Marty's 'Playing
Together', which looked at some common tools to enabled networks to talk to
each other. So DNS, DHCP, Samba and printing were all covered among others. It
was interesting to hear Marty's experiences of setting up networks, some of
which carries on from his 'GnuGuerilla' talk. He also aimed the talk at small
networks, and as such some of the tools mentioned, such as dnsmasq, were quite
new to me. By lunchtime we had docked in Dubrovnik. Several of the geeks had
planned to meet up with several Coartian Linux geeks and go for a meal in a
really nice restaurant. I went with them, just to check out the restaurant,
but the news that it was going to be expensive proved true, so I opted for a
walk arount the city. I'm glad I did, as there were several interesting 
buildings, not least of which was the Irish Pub I found in the back streets.
Having survived without Guinness for a week, I thought I owed it to myself to
have at least a pint .. or two :) Once back on the boat I did as much packing
as I could, as the luggage had to be outside the room by 1am. The last night
of dinner found us more or less sitting back on our original tables. There's
obviously something in the idea of 'birds of a feather, stick to together'.
After dinner we once again headed for our favourite bar. The story that had
been unfolding for us, came to a very amusing conclusion. I will have to write
down the tale, as if it doesn't get posted, then I'm sure to forget. As it was
the last night on board the boat, it also meant it was Karen's last chance to 
get us into the disco and dancing. To her credit, she managed it, even me and
Casey! I have to confess I was more interested in documenting the event than 
participating. By the time we'd finished it was gone 2am, and definitely time
for bed as we had to be out of the rooms by 8am.
<P>
<B>Sunday</B>. Going home day. At least for some. We were out of the rooms and
waiting around for most of the morning. Some of us had problems sorting out
bills, and the queue for paying was horrendous. About 100 people in line and 
each of the cashiers taking around 5 minutes per person. There were a few that
had problems leaving on time, and 2 guys actually missed their flight because
of the cockup with registering credit cards. It transpired later that their
network was screwed and couldn't process any credit cards. Thankfully Marty,
Karen and I were on the second wave off the ship, and quickly found our bags
and headed for the airport. My flight wasn't until the afternoon, so I had
plenty of time to sit and wait. I'm glad I did, as the two guys who had missed
their flight, were not getting a good deal from the Costa representatives. I
managed to step in and explain a few things as to the lack of communication
and general disorganisation of the admin staff on board. Unfortunately the
reps couldn't authorise payment for a hotel and another flight the following
day, so the two guys were faced with paying over Ã¢âÂ¬1150 & Ã¢âÂ¬500 respectively
to get home. Money they didn't have. On further investigation, it appears
that Costa in their infinite wisdom, had booked a flight that required those
that were travelling on it, to get off the boat and arrive at the airport
with precision timing. No room for error. Given the cockup with the credit
cards, if the flight had been even 30 minutes later, they would both have
made the flight. I had to leave them and catch my flight, which thankfully
went without a hitch, but I was concerned they were going to end up stuck in
the airport. However, they did manage to get home safely. Costa have not made
a good impression on anyone, although the bar staff, entertainment staff and
some of the waiting staff were wonderful. From what has been said, Neil wants
to come back to Europe for a Geek Cruise, but it is highly unlikely that he'll
be using Costa again.
<P>
All in all I enjoyed the Geek Cruise side of things, the excursions and the company I kept. I'd certainly like to do it again, but may have to wait until 2006. I'll have to see if we can afford a family holiday in the Caribbean next year ;)</p>

<h2>On inventing the Schwartzian Transform (version 2)</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/merlyn/">merlyn</a> on 2004-10-22T13:11:43</h3>
Once again, although I invented the recipe, I did not name the result.  I was trying for an Oatmeal Cookie (buttershotz, goldschager, baileys, and kahlua), but because of missing ingredients on the ship, ended up with CremeDeMenthe, Baileys, and Jaegermeister.  The result can be viewed <a href="http://www.stonehenge.com/merlyn/Pictures/Trips/2004/04-10-Italy-PerlWhirl4/Day-5-At-Sea/?show=139" title="stonehenge.com">in my picture archive</a stonehenge.com>.
