<p><P><strong>The YAPC::Europe::2006 Backstage Pass<br>
Bulletin 3.1<br>
- A 'Behind The Scenes' missive from the organisers</strong>
<P>
<strong>"pod171 are you receiving me?"</strong>
<P>
Unfortunately a cockup with logrotate brought the Birmingham.pm server down at the weekend. It meant that aside from the Birmingham.pm and Birmingham OpenGuides websites, the YAPC::Europe::2006 and wiki websites were out of action, not that the latter two would have made that much difference to anyone else but the organisers. We've been in the process of setting up the websites and putting them through their paces to ensure they stand up the demands we require of them, and contain all the right content to provide you with all information about the conference. They won't be made public just yet, but it won't be too long now.
<P>
<strong>"If only tonight we could sleep"</strong>
<P>
Accommodation looks good at the moment. There are two hotels vying for our affections, that are both within a two minute walk (if you walk really slow) of the venue. Both have Wifi access and/or cabled broadband access in the rooms and are 3 star quality hotels. They both have deals on at the moment, but we are trying to negotiate an even better rate, so please bear with us.
<P>
<strong>"If I had a hammer"</strong>
<P>
Something that we'd like to expand on this year is the tutorials. We're still happy to have the traditional style of tutorial, but in addition we'd be interested in anyone who has ideas for any project workshops. These can be a hackathon or maybe a hands-on example workshop or even a Q&A session. Submit your idea as per the regular talks in the Call For Papers by Friday June 2nd to <a href="mailto:talks@birmingham2006.com">talks@birmingham2006.com</a>. We'll let you know whether your submission was successful as soon as possible after the submission deadline.
<P>
<strong>"And their off...."</strong>
<P>
We've already had a number of people submit their talks in the last few days, and we hear there are many more being put together, so we're quite excited to see what other treats you all have in store for us. Judging by the content of the submissions so far, we're going to have a fun time scheduling them all. I wonder if there's a 'use Clone' in BioPerl? I could do with a couple more of me to see all the sessions :)
<P>
<strong>"yada yada yada"</strong>
<P>
That's it for this little addendum to our main announcement. We'll be including more minor updates to future announcements, so keep an eye for them as we go on.
<P>
If you have any questions about the conference the organisers can be reached at <a href="mailto:organisers@birmingham2006.com">organisers@birmingham2006.com</a>, and we'll get back to you as soon as possible.
<P>
Cheers,<br>
The YAPC::Europe::2006 Organisers.</p>
