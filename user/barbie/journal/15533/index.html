<p>It's DanDan's birthday today, but we had his party for the family yesterday. He had a great time and so did we. Nicole got him to make a list of all things he wanted for his party. Everybody had to have red pop and purple pop, cheese, ham and a cake. He came up with quite a list, and Nicole and I spent most of Saturday buying it all. He stayed at his Nanny's on Saturday night so we could get the house ready. His face on Sunday morning with the balloons on the front door was a picture. My niece, Megan, is now walking and the pair of them had a great laugh playing cars and musically instruments. They even sat together at their great Grandma's old picnic table, pinching food off each others plate come teatime. They entertained us all afternoon.
<P>
This morning DanDan opened the presents from Nicole and I. A taxi, a roadway mat, but then his eyes really lit up when he opened the half-size guitar. It's a bit too big for him at the moment, but in a year or two he should be able to start getting proper tunes out of it. For now he's happy sitting on the sofa strumming away making up his own songs. A rock and roll star in the making :)
<P>
He'll probably have his second album recorded by the time I get home!</p>
