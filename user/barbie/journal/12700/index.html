<p>Finally found time to work on a second beta of Calendar::List, thanks to some crtique from <a href='http://use.perl.org/user/richardc/journal'>richardc</a> [1]. I dropped the '-opt' style of passing hash keys and redid a couple of the tests to cover more cases. Dropped it into the Birmingham.pm holding area [2] and richardc managed to find a broken bug. Odd it seems to be working fine here.
<P>
I've now started on my talks for the Birmingham.pm <a href='http://birmingham.pm.org/docs/technical-next.html'>technical meeting</a> on June 18th. Thankfully they're not too involving more just a presentation of thoughts and ideas. The LWP talk I originally did was very centred around my Perl Auctioneer application (which has yet to be finished), so this time I looking more into the type of scripts you can write and use. A sort of mini-Cookbook talk. The Calendar::List one is a short lightning talk introduction to the module.
<P>
The final talk is likely to be a bit of a discussion point, with why I got entwined with all the parameter validation modules about. Mainly a quick presentation of whats there, whats good and what I'm thinking for the future. We'll see next week whether anyone else also thinks its a good idea.
<P>
Okay back to fixing that test bug....
<P>
[1] The <a href='http://www.activestate.com/Corporate/ActiveAwards/index.html'>local boy done good</a>, who needs your vote :)<br>
[2] Not a proper holding area yet, just a directory, but you can get the latest tarball at [unavailable until latest tests work!]
<P>
<b>[update]</b> Seems I was a bit hasty with the upload. V2 needed fixing and V3 has a broken test file when I added a few more tests. Hopefully V4 will be a complete working version!</p>
