<p><P>
The Birmingham.pm World Tour of UK Perl Monger user groups began last night, with a visit to <a href="http://london.pm.org">London.pm</a>. Unfortunately only two members of <a href="http://birmingham.pm.org">Birmingham.pm</a> were able to make it, myself and Phil Ironside (who is actually the leader of <a href="http://www.malvern.lug.org.uk/">Malvern LUG</a>). We had a great night though, and it was good to see everyone. Sadly Muttley wasn't able to attend, which was a shame as it would have been the first chance I would have to congratulate him in his new role as leader of London.pm. Hopefully he'll be able to make the encore visit which is planned for June.
<P>
Dave Cantrell was trying to persuade me to add Croydon.pm to our list, which I'm considering. I know many of them come to the London.pm meetings, but they're a lovely bunch, so it seems only right to try and include them. David Hodgkinson mentioned that the <a href="http://bath.pm.org">Bath.pm</a> meetings are likely to happen a little more, and they're on a Saturday night, so would be easier to arrange than a mid-week jaunt. I have still to arrange with <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/TeeJay/journal/">TeeJay</a> about our visit to Plymouth (<a href="http://devoncornwall.pm.org">DevonCornwall.pm</a>), but a May trip looks promising. There is still possibility of a Cambridge trip too (<a href="http://cam.pm.org">Cam.pm</a>), but being a bit more awkward to get to, may have to wait until the summer, when we can make a bit of a long weekend of it. I'll need to finalise dates soon, so I can get t-shirts printed. Can't have a tour without t-shirt merchandise, it's just not rock'n'roll!
<P>
I especially would like to thank Jacqui Caren, who has very kindly donated some items for the YAPC::Europe auction. A couple of Perl related items, and a Sci-Fi related item. If anyone is thinking of having a clear out at anytime, and would rather that unusual Perl/FOSS related item went to a well deserving home, let me know and I can arrange to store it for the auction too.
<P>
The World Tour continues in two weeks time, when we visit <a href="http://belfast.pm.org">Belfast.pm</a>. It's coinciding with <a href="http://belfoss.org/Home">BelFOSS</a>, which is looking very interesting. </p>
