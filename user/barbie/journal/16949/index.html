<p>This BBC article, <a href='http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/3419591.stm'>Bigmouth strikes again</a>, poses an interesting thought. The incident that prompted it, is a very sensitive one (I don't think she deserves a prison sentence, a hefty fine and community service might be more appropriate), but how often have you wanted to dearly make a stupid quip to a really stupid question?
<P>
When I went to TPC4 in 2000, on arrival at San Francisco airport I was asked 'which operating system do you use?' Now in the past I have used many operating systems (Pick, Xenix, Ultrics, VMS ... as well as the usual). I dearly wanted to reel them off and watch the blank look on the customs officer's face, but instead stuck to a more traditional list. I got a blank look, until I said the magic password (Windows). Then I got the all clear!</p>

Why on earth where you asked which OS you used?  In what possible, conceivable way could that affect your travelling via aeroplane?

It was US customs, after I landed at San Francisco from the UK. I think they were trying to verify I *REALLY* worked with computers and was worthy enough to be allowed into the country! Anyone not bowing to the shrine of Redmond must obviously be a liar and sent home.
