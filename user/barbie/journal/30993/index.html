<p><p>If you attended <a href="http://www.birmingham2006.com">YAPC::Europe::2006</a>, then you will likely be receiving a little mail round about now, that includes a link to an online survey. A number of questions in the survey were asked of us during discussions with sponsors and proved difficult to answer as we had no backup for any of our assumptions. As such we thought starting a survey would help future organisers encourage big name sponsors to fund YAPC and Workshop events.
<p>Hopefully everyone will complete the survey, and hopefully they'll complete them within the few weeks. However, people are people and I suspect there will be some that won't complete the survey, and several others that will try and get in just before the deadline (even though we don't have a deadline). For those of you who feel you fall into the latter category, remember that this is to help encourage more high profile sponsors get involved, and thus raise the profile of Perl outside of the existing community and ensure we keep attracting newcommers to Perl conferences and workshops.
<p>All survey submissions will be saved anonymously, and only aggregated data will ever be released. We aim to have some form of presentation before the end of the year, which we'll promote in all the usual places.
<p>If you haven't received your mail by the end of today, and you did attend, please let me know.</p>
