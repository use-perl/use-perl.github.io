<p>Seeing as I thought Cache::FileCache would be a good idea to implement on our new mod_perl system, I thought I'd try installing. Unfortunately ActiveState only have a PPM version for Solaris.
<P>Never mind I'll use my new mini-CPAN to get the latest version and install it myself. Until that is it requires Storable. Now ActiveState have version 1.12 of Storable, which I duly installed, but Cache-Cache requires version 1.14 or above.
<P>
Never mind I thought, I'll just go back to my mini-CPAN and install the latest version of Storable. Then I discovered the fatal flaw in my trail.
<P>
I don't have a C compiler on my windows box, and Storable seems to be asking for a C related thing called "cl". The last time I had one on a win32 box brings back some horrific memories. So alas I won't be getting to use Cache::FileCache in production software :(
<P>
One of our clients insists we use winNT ... don't ask!</p>

<h2>Cache::FileCache in Win32</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ajt/">ajt</a> on 2002-10-21T11:29:33</h3>
<p>By using an alternative PPM repository I've been able to get my version of Storable up to 1.011 and install Cache:Cache 1.01 on NT. Works quite well - though some functions can't work. Jolly good module, and it's author is a helpful person.</p>

<p>See here for a list PPM repositories with newer software than AS: <a href="http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=147012" title="perlmonks.org">Re: Modules in the Windows environment</a perlmonks.org>. I've found the University of Winnipeg repository in particular to be very good for mod_Perl and XML modules.</p>

Brilliant there are 2 on that list I already use (Theory for mod_perl and OpenInteract for Template Toolkit), but the others are very welcome. Thanks.
<p>
It would be nice if, like CPAN, there was a central repository for all ActivePerl packaged modules. Perhaps ActiveState could open up their repository a bit, so it becomes a one stop shop, rather than having to search other repositories or do-it-yourself (which sometimes isn't an option).</p>

<p>This has come up a few times on <a href="http://www.perlmonks.org/" title="perlmonks.org">Perlmonks</a perlmonks.org> hence my suggested link. From what I gather there are a number of alternative repositories out there with various things on them, but it's not co-ordinated like CPAN.</p>

<p>As far as I can work out AS only build modules when a paying customer asks for them or if they think they are useful. For example Crazyinsomniac started up his own repository, here is the <a href="http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=162391" title="perlmonks.org">announcment</a perlmonks.org> which covered some of the topic.</p>

<p>As far as I'm aware no one has yet produced a single meta-PPM tool, and I believe AS only include their own repositories when you install AS Perl. I think they list some repositories in the HTML documentation they ship, but they also use to include links to Matt's Script Archive. I complained about MSA and they added better links (<a href="http://nms-cgi.sourceforge.net/" title="sourceforge.net">NMS</a sourceforge.net>), but I've not seen the latest docs to see what they currently say (<a href="http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=128588" title="perlmonks.org">Help to Update the ActiveState Docs</a perlmonks.org>).</p>
