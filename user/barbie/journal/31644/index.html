Event:   Technical Meeting
Date:    Wednesday 22nd November 2006
Times:   from 7pm onwards (see below)
Venue:   O'Neills, 90 Hurst Street, The Arcadian Centre, Birmingham

</pre>

<p>
After a great turnout at our meeting last month (thanks largely to the Malvern LUG transfering their meeting to ours, cheers guys), I hope we can continue the trend. This will be the last technical meeting for 2006 and once again we'll be at O'Neills. If you wish to partake of food before the talks begin, please get your food orders to me by 12pm Tuesday 21st November (menu details below). 

<p>
This month we are honoured with three guest speakers. Firstly we have local LUG member, Alex Willmer, who will be talking about cool GPS things. Tom Hukins will telling us about this cool Perl extended technical meeting that he attended in August (apparently it was in Birmingham and many of us managed to miss it!). Then we have Jonathon Worthington talking about formal programming language theory, with a glimpse of Parrot and Perl 6 along the way. Finally, we have our own JJ provide a good introduction to functional programming.

<p>
A very varied month of talks, and hopefully there will be plenty for everyone.

<p>
<b>Talks:</b>

<p>
The bundle of talks on offer this month are:
<ul>
<li>GPS and Geospatial Information Systems with Linux [ Alex Willmer ] 
<li>What I learned at YAPC Europe [ Tom Hukins ] 
<li>Formal Theory, Informally [ Jonathan Worthington ] 
<li>Functional Programming - an introduction [ Jon Allen ]
</ul>
<p>
As always entry is free, no knowledge of Perl is required, and we'd be delighted to have you along. Feel free to invite family, friends and colleagues ;)

<p>
<b>Times:</b>

<p>
These are the rough times for the evening:
<ul>
<li>18:00-19:30 - food *
<li>20:00-22:00 - talks *
<li>22:00-23:00 - discussion *
</ul>
<p>
* Please note that beer will be consumed during these sessions ;)
<p>
<b>Venue:</b>

<p>
Technical meetings are held at O'Neills on Hurst Street, by The Arcadian Centre. We will be in the main function room ("the band room" if you've ever been there at the weekend). It's approximately 5-10 minutes walk from New Street station, and only slightly longer from the city centre.
