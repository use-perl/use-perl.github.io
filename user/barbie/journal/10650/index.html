<p>For anyone likely to be in the vacinity of Birmingham or the West Midlands next wednesday (26th Feb), you may be interested in a technical meeting us Birmingham Perl Mongers are holding.
<P>
Our Guest Speakers are <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/davorg/">Dave Cross</a> and <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/2shortplanks/">Mark Fowler</a>, who have graciously offered to do a couple of talks each. If you're a regular attendee of London.pm technical meetings, then you will likely be familiar with them, but always worth a second hearing. For anyone who is interested in coming along, details and directions can found on the Birmingham.pm <a href="http://birmingham.pm.org/docs/technical-next.html">Technical Meetings</a> page. I shall be giving a talk, along with another Birmingham.pm regular, so there will be something fresh to listen to.
<P>
On another note, I have been quiet of late, which is very unlike me, but I seem to take much longer to do any coding at home than I did at work. When I finally get my business idea off the ground, I will definitely be looking at other premises. Less distractions.
<P>This unemployed lark is a real bummer though. Dwindling resources has meant having to miss the chance to see Peter Gabriel, Ministry and Yes. Though on a plus point I have won tickets to see Red Hot Chili Peppers in Manchester, with hotel accomadation and meal thrown in for good measure :)</p>

<p>
Wow!  That must have been one HELL of a show!  I wonder if they all came out together at the end to do a Afro-prog version of "Jesus Built My Hotrod".</p>
