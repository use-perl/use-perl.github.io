<a href="http://perl.grango.org">CPAN Testers Statistics</a>

<p>The cpan-testers mailing list finally got turned off for outbound email. The outbound part of the mailing list has been a growing cause for concern for Ask and Robert, as with the increasing volume of reports, the mail server at perl.org has been suffering, and consequently all the other mailing lists, particularly all the Perl Monger group and Perl project mailing lists have been seeing servere delays. Reports should still be sent to the list, but all access and reference to them should be done through the NNTP server or the web based list. PAUSE Uploads can still be received via email thanks to the new cpan-uploads mailing list. This is read-only mailing list, and any mail sent to it will be ignored. Authors and Testers wishing to continue discussions for any particular reports should direct them to the cpan-testers-discuss mailing list. See <a href="http://cpantest.grango.org/">CPAN Testers Wiki</a>, particularly the <a href="http://cpantest.grango.org/wiki/MailingLists">Mailing Lists</a> page, for further details.
<p>Despite the slight drop in testers and thus reports last month, it is worth noting that both the number of platforms (70) and the number of perls (21) are the highest we've ever had. Of course we would be delighted to see more of both ;) Over the past few months it's been interesting to see that all the top 5 testers are European based, and last month Serguei Trouchelle, who has been a tester for just under a year, has lept into 5th place. Well done Serguei, and to all the testers for contributing their efforts.
<p>6 more addresses mappings, including 3 new testers. Even though there have been several new addresses spotted, and even some that have been around for a while, I think it's getting time again for my mail requesting clarification of who people are, so expect an email sometime this month if your email address isn't too obvious. Some are kind enough to include hints for me, but still the majority like to disguise their involvement.
<p>The Oslo Perl Mongers are organising the <a href="http://perl-qa.hexten.net/wiki/index.php/OsloQAWorkshop2008">Oslo QA Hackathon</a> in April, followed by the Go Open Conference, where Adam Kennedy and Michael Schwern will be presenting. For various reasons it looks like a number of those involved with CPAN Testers won't be able to make the event, but there are plenty of TAP and standard Test tool authors going that it should be a good event to attend. I'm planning to host a CPAN Testers BOF at both YAPC::NA and YAPC::Europe, with more of a mind to figure out some specifics for the future of CPAN Testers. In the meantime, the TAP and Test toolchain are likely to get a good round of tuits during the Hackathon, so hopefully we'll all see the benefits of the Hackathon.

Perhaps we could start with freaking "Get rid of mail"?
