<p><P>I like nice suprises. The one I got last night had me completely lost for words. 
<P>
Last night we had the usual <a href='http://birmingham.pm.org/'>Birmingham.pm</a> <a href='http://birmingham.pm.org/docs/meet-social.html'>social meeting</a>. On turning up, most of the folks were already there, I noted two women sitting down with their backs to me. I did think it a bit odd that Penny (JJ's other half) was sitting *opposite* him. As I came to sit down, I got the shock of my life to see it wasn't Penny, but <a href='http://www.martian.org/karen/'>Karen Pauley</a> sitting opposite JJ. She'd planned the trip over a couple of weeks ago and Marty had told her not to tell me. I'm glad she didn't tell me, as it really was wonderful to see her.
<P>
It was quite a lively meeting last night, which is always nice. The other woman there tonight was Steve's other half, Lynsey, who has been wheelchair bound for the past few months, so it was good to see her up and about. Talk touched on <a href=''>Perl 5 Day</a>, which JJ and I are attending. We have some interesting ideas for the event, and although we have come at it from different angles, our thoughts are pretty similar. But the night rounded off with seveal games of Fluxx. And I didn't win any of them :(
<P>
So we now have a Birmingham.pm technical meeting in 2 weeks time, then Perl 5 Day in a few weeks, followed by a trip to <a href='http://braga.yapceurope.org/'>Braga</a>. It's a fun Perl packed month again. September looks to be as busy with both the group's 5th birthday and my 40th. I think this could be termed party season :)</p>
