<b>Introduction:</b>
<p>
This month we're featuring a night of Regular Expressions, thanks to Brian McCauley. Brian will taking a trip from the basics, through the changes for 5.10 and finally taking a glimpse at Perl6 Grammars.
<p>
Once again we'll be at The Victoria this month. The pub is on the corner of John Bright Street and Beak Street, between the old entrance to the Alexandra Theatre and the backstage entrance. If in doubt, the main entrance to the Theatre is on the inner ring road, near the Pagoda roundabout. The pub is on the road immediately behind the main entrance. See the map link on the website if you're stuck.
<p>
As always entry is free, with no knowledge of Perl required. We'd be delighted to have you along, so feel free to invite family, friends and colleagues ;)
<p>
We'll likely be in the venue from about 6.30pm, although as we don't get access to the room upstairs until 7.30pm, we'll be eating downstairs and moving up later, with talks planned to begin about 8pm. As there are only 2 talks, we'll head down to the main bar for more discussion afterwards.

<p>
The venue is approximately 5-10 minutes walk from New Street station, and about the same from the city centre. On street car parking is available on Beak Street and around the loop of Station Street, Dudley Street and Hinckley Street (and Theatre Approach), free after 6pm, or alternative you may prefer to park in the NCP multistorey car park on Hill Street, or in the Red Cage opposite the MailBox.
<p>
If you're travelling into the city centre from the south along the A38, follow signs for New Street Station. At the Pagoda roundabout, turn right onto Smallbrook Queensway. If you arrive from the north, again follow the A38 and signs to New Street Station, then at the Pagoda roundabout turn left onto Smallbrook Queensway.
<p>
At the first set of traffic lights at the bottom of the hill, turn left, past the Holiday Inn hotel, Beak Street is the first left and the pub is on the right hand side as you turn the corner into John Bright Street. Opposite Beak Street, the second right on Hill Street is Station Street (you can follow the road round the block to come out back on to Hill Street via Hinckley Street), where you might find on street parking. A few yards further up Hill Street on your right is an NCP multistorey carpark, however, you might be better heading further up to the traffic lights on Hill Street, and turning left. As you approach the flyover and the Mailbox, the Red Cage multistorey is on your right hand side.
