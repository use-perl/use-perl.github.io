<p><p>Apparently my current mail ISP are having a few "issues" with their mail servers again. A friend had to contact me through Facebook this morning as they got a bounce message saying the ISP wouldn't relay the mail, even though they host the domain!
<p>This has been happening for the last 3 years around this time, and I'm surprised with myself that I haven't sorted something out sooner. So now I'm looking at transferring the missbarbell.co.uk domain to another ISP. However, all still hasn't gone to plan. The web form they use to transfer domains seems reasonable enough, but when you complete it and submit, it gives an error without telling you what the error is. I've just had to contact support directly and have them perform the transfer. Once the other domain I have hosted there comes up for renewal, I'll be transferring that too. NicNames used to be a good company, but since they got bought out the service has gone downhill. I don't think EasySpace are anything to do with EasyJet, but the cheap and nasty of the latter certainly applies to the former.
<p>Originally I was planning to host a mail server on one of my own servers, and may well do that at some stage, but it really is much easier having someone else sort all that stuff out for you. But just in case you try sending mail to me over the next day or two and you get a bounce message or an odd error message, please try resending again, as it should get through eventually.</p>

About a year ago (after a <a href="http://unixshell.com/" title="unixshell.com">catastrophic data loss</a unixshell.com>) I switched email for my domain to <a href="http://www.tuffmail.com/" title="tuffmail.com">Tuffmail</a tuffmail.com>.  I've been very happy with the service.  They don't have any non-email extras like <a href="http://fastmail.fm/" title="fastmail.fm">some of the others</a fastmail.fm> but their prices are reasonable and the service has been very reliable.

<p>I only use these ISPs for DNS type things, I don't host mail or sites with them and my mail is stored on my server at home. After suggesting several times that EasySpace use more than one mail server, in case anything goes wrong, they are still persisting with what would seem to be an old flakey box. I'm moving to Simply.com as they already host other domains of mine, have 3 mail servers and are based roughly 10 miles from my house, so I could potentially pay them a personal visit<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;) Not that I ever expect to, as they've been rather good for the past few years since I started using them.</p>
