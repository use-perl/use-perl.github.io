<p>Greetings one and all. Seeing as I've been enjoying the pleasures (!!!) of use Perl for the last 18 months or so, I thought perhaps I ought to actually sign up properly for it. I can't promise too much mirth and mayhem, but I'll certainly try.<br/><br/><P>Birmingham.pm celebrates it's first birthday next week. We started before January 2001, but only had our first official social meeting then. Unfortunately Mike has decided to take a 6 month sabbatical, roaming the wilds of Australia, so we will be a member down this month.<br/><br/><P>My promises for this year (don't worry I'll break them all) are to (a) finish my talk so that I have something to waffle about at TPC or YAPC::Europe or even a London.pm technical meeting if they're unfortunate enough, (b) finish my fantasy football league prediction site and (c) to actually complete a proper module ready for submission to CPAN so I can claim the moniker that I've been dying to use, since I first discovered CPAN.<br/><br/><P>Failing all that I aim to get to more London.pm meetings and drink more Guinness.<br/><br/><P>Have fun People.
</p>

<h2>Drink More Guinness</h2>

Already doing so.  I was on the receiving end of stern frowns from the missus after Dad and I bowled off an 8-pack on Friday.  The taste was worth it, though.  Deeeelicious.<p>

Last night we bowled off a bottle of nouveau beaujolais.  Also delicious, in a different way.  Much better than the "free" bottle of Merlot from the BMW dealership we had on New Year's Eve.  Quoth the owner of the bottle "that's not free, that cost us $30k!".  Tasted like shite.</p><p>

It's a shame that red wine is the drink that's good for you.  I could easily drink a glass of Guinness, whereas I have to work at a glass of wine.  Still, it could be worse--we could be expected to be drinking galliano to prolong our lives<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p><p>

Actually, dark beers are thought to have similar health benefits as red wine. Here's one <a href="http://199.97.97.16/contWriter/yhdalcohol/2000/12/20/medic/6240-0150-pat_nytimes.html" title="199.97.97.16">
