<p>On 2nd October members of Birmingham.pm and Wolves LUG attended the BrumCon IV
conference. I was probably expecting too much of the conference, but from
previous reports from Brum2600 meetings I was surprised at some of the talks.
<P>
The conference began with a talk mostly about radio direction finders. To anyone
who had never heard of the doppler effect to simulate a radar, or didn't have a
basic grasp of direction finding, then this talk would have probably been very
interesting. However, for myself there was nothing here I hadn't learnt when I
joined GEC nearly 20 years ago.
<P>
The next couple of talks could have been more engaging if they had any depth
to them, or any degree of real relavance to the audience. The first covered
how easy it is to recover files from hard disks even though you think you've
deleted them. Very much preaching to the converted. The other was a look at
creating a hidden file system with the EXT2 directory tables. While this may be
of interest to those who really have something to hide, I sincerely doubt any
of the assembled are of any real concern to the authorities.
<P>
After a break for lunch, we returned to hear a talk on porn. Well in actual
fact it was really a talk about how the Google image search tool is really
quite good. Featuring mostly school-boy tongue-in-cheek humour, it was quite a
pointless talk. If this is what we had been waiting for, as was commented on
seeing as the man from the BBC had left, then I really was at the wrong 
conference. To his credit the speaker didn't use slides or any kind of visual
aid, which really would have sunk the depths. Although it was supposed to be 
light-hearted, I couldn't help but feel it was misplaced.
<P>
The single most engaging talk of the event was up next. A guy from UK Broadband
explained how 3G worked. With JJ in the audience offering tidbits from the
Vodafone perspective, it had the whole audience rivetted. It seemed to generate
the most discussion afterwards too, which can't be bad. I certainly have a 
better grasp of it all works now.
<P>
The next talk also caught my interest, and was concerned with breaking one-time
pad encryption. Although fairly trivial when you think about it, it did serve
to highlight that although reliable encryption with one-way pads is virtually
unbreakable, assuming the programmer is going to make a mistake or not encyrpt 
correctly, can open up the encyrption to exploits. An interesting talk.
<P>
Running for home, the last talk was with a locksmith. Not with computer locks,
but traditional padlocks. He explained a little of the history and the
different types of locks, along with many examples he'd brought along. The
ways to approach lock picking, and some of the tools used. Again while the
talk had a modicum of interest, I was a little at a loss to see where it fitted
into the Brum2600 idea.
<P>
All in all, it was an interesting day out, and for five pounds it wasn't like
I felt I had been cheated or anything. The conference itself was very well
attended, and even got a spot on the TV, so there is definitely interest out
there. However, I was expecting a few talks more orientated to hacking and
networking, such as packet sniffing, hacking protocols, among other things,
but alas there was none of that. Perhaps I might do one about email next year 
for them. I'm sure Matt and Rich can give me some pointers to cover, and I'm 
pretty certain it would be a darn sight more relevant that picking padlocks!
