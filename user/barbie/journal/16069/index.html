<p>Last night was Nicole's monthly gig. Well Slim Pickins' monthly gig really, but Nicole was also doing an acoustic set. It was rather nice as she did two of my songs and later the band did another of my songs. They're hoping to record them next year, either on Nicole's "solo" album, or the full band album. It'll be the first recordings that I'll officially have a songwriters credit :)
<P>
A friend, whose band also played, is now asking me to let him have a few lyrics to have a go at. I stopped writing about 7 years ago, after around 15 years worth of poems and songs. It seems odd now that suddenly people are getting interested. I plan to publish some online sometime in the future, maybe I'll get a bit more interest then too :)</p>
