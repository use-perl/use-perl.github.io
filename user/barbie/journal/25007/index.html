<h1>Google's Summer of Code</h1>

<div class="span8">
<p>I've just read the piece by <a href='http://www.perlfoundation.org'>TPF</a> regarding the <a href='http://www.perlfoundation.org/gc/grants/proposals.html'>list of projects</a> suggested for the <a href='http://code.google.com/summerofcode.html'>Summer of Code project</a>.
<P>
Top of the list leaves me a little confused:
<P>
<blockquote><i>Automated smoke testing for CPAN</i></blockquote>
<P>
Isn't this the <a href='http://search.cpan.org/dist/CPAN-YACSmoke/'>CPAN::YACSmoke</a> / <a href='http://sourceforge.net/projects/yacsmoke'>yacsmoke project</a> that Robert Rothenberg and I have been working on? And <a href='http://conferences.yapceurope.org/2005/talk/109'>a talk</a> about which I plan to do at <a href='http://braga.yapceurope.org/'>YAPC::Europe</a>.<br/><br/><P>Does this mean The Perl Foundation don't see this as a worthwhile project and want yet another project to go through the hardship of coding the automated testing of CPAN. Or have I missed something? Both Robert and I have put in a lot of personal time and effort in doing this. It seems a bit odd to suggest doing something else to replace it! I really hope I've missed the intent of this suggestion.
<P>
BTW <a href='http://conferences.yapceurope.org/2005/schedule'>Talk Schedules for YAPC::Europe</a> are now online.</p>

<p>The short answer is "I don't know" and the long answer is "I don't know". I would ask them though. It might have been a simple oversight on their part.</p>

<p>Having worked on an issue with you on Data::Phrasebook I would hope that it isn't a snub as you were great to work with.</p>

<h2>Take a deep breath</h2>

Relax. The simplest answer is the best: the TPF site is not as fresh as it could be.<br> <br>The next simplest answer is good too: the project is alive and thriving and can still use development.<br> <br>The knee-jerk reaction, that the world hates you, is a bit extreme.

The list is pretty fresh, as the entries came from suggestions from members of the TPF in the last week. Others involved in TPF have commented on their surprise at the entry being there.
<p>
The yacsmoke project could use some ideas, which is one of the reasons I'm doing the talk in Braga, to get some suggestions. There are at least 2 other automated CPAN testing projects on CPAN, so we're not alone either.
</p> <p>
The knee-jerk reaction, wasn't a "the world hates me" response. It was a genuine confusion as to why anyone would suggest starting another project when there are 3 others on going. All 3 are fairly small projects and personally I don't feel they warrant a $4500 grant to work on them. If nothing else, there should perhaps be a better description as to what each list entry involves, which might have avoided any confusion.</p>

Instead of reacting here, why didn't you just ask TPF and get the real answer? Instead of solving the problem, you over-reacted.<br> <br>It's just a list of ideas. It's not a judgement.<br> <br>You're estimation of the grant is out of whack too. It's for students who want an introduction to open source. Students and interns take a long time to get things done. Google wants to give the money away, Google wants people to work on open source projects, but you're now saying "Don't work on mine". What do you care how much Google wants to pay? It's not your money.<br> <br>Stop being a dick and start making some friends. don't let your attitude be the one that introduces people to open source.

And I certainly hope your remarks are not an introduction to those interested in open source. At least I wasn't being personally insulting.

I hope it is an introduction: just because it's open source doesn't mean you can act like you do. I have a problem with how you're personally handling this. You want to scream and stamp your feet and point fingers so students who want to participate in the Summer of Code stay away from your pet project. <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/barbie/journal/22432" title="perl.org">You've had this problem before.</a perl.org> <br> <br>I'm calling a spade a spade.

I have personally dealt with Barbie and had no issues with him. In fact, he helped to work around a problem that I was having. Maybe it was a "knee jerk reaction" but name calling is never the right thing to do. Even if you are "right".

<i>Stop being a dick and start making some friends.</i> <br> <br>And there's nothing like personally insulting someone in a public forum that says 'welcome to open source'.<br> <br>Sigh.

<h2>Not a slap</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Allison/">Allison</a> on 2005-06-13T00:19:06</h3>
My apologies for the confusion. The most important thing to keep in mind is that the Summer of Code isn't for experienced developers to tackle huge projects on their own, it's for summer student internships to help out any way they can. I certainly didn't mean the entry as a replacement for your project. I've <a href="http://www.perlfoundation.org/gc/grants/proposals.html" title="perlfoundation.org">modified the page</a perlfoundation.org> to reflect that fact.
<p>
(And sorry not to respond earlier, but I just saw this journal entry a few minutes ago.)
</p> <p>
On a semi-related note: please feel free to email us when you have problems. TPF isn't a huge impenetrable organization. We're just a small group of volunteers doing the best we can. We make mistakes sometimes and sometimes don't communicate clearly, but we're glad to be corrected and glad to talk things through.
</p> <p>
Allison</p>
