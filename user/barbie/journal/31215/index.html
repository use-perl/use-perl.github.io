<p><p>This Saturday I'll be speaking at my last conference of 2006. That'll have been 6 conferences attended, 4 of which I'll have spoken at (3 truthfully, as I wasn't really a speaker at YAPC::Europe). I don't think I'll be able to stretch myself to this again next year, but we'll see.
<p>
The event on Saturday, is another I was specifically asked to be a speaker for (<a href="http://www.lugradio.org/live/2006/index.php/Main_Page">LUGRadio Live</a> was the other). It's known as <a href="http://www.brum2600.net/brumcon6/">Brumcon</a> and is the conference that the Brum2600 group have been arranging for the last few years. I attended one a few years ago, but was a bit disappointed by the lack of real depth of the talks. I'm hoping this year will be a little different. I'll be speaking about email, but as I can't give any company secrets away, it'll be a general what is email, how it works and some simple tricks and tips for blocking spam and viruses. There'll be nothing earth-shattering and pretty much everything I say will be related to things already available in Spam Assassin, clamAV and the like. However, I do have a few stories to tell :)
<p>It still surprises me how many people, even geeks, really don't know about how email works. As such I'm hoping my presentation will be an enlightening talk, rather than a set of ready made receipes to start your own email security company ;)</p>

Last I heard, email had something to do with a powdery substance in all kinds of colors that you'd have to bake to turn it into a hard glacy uhm thingie? It seemed to have gotten very popular over the last 10 years or so because I hear lot's of people talk about it.. They seem to spend lots of time baking and sending each other these small items. I personally prefer the parchment and quill approach. I can write a lot faster that way...&lt;/sarcasm&gt;
