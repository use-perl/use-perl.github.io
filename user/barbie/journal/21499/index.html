<p>While on the cruise, we got a brief highlight of the British news in a 4 page
A4 newsletter type paper. Within one of them I noted that the signs on the M1,
M6, M18 and M62 are going to feature the messages "Keep Left Unless Overtaking"
and "Don't Hog the Middle Lane". I wish they would have the same on the M5 too.
<P>
About 10 years ago, the Warwickshire police were actually giving out spot fines
on the M40 for road hogging. I believe it was classified as driving without due
care and attention. I don't know why they stopped, as driving down the M40 to
London did improve for a while. 
<P>
It really is alarming how bad some drivers have got. Traditionally learner
drivers are not taught how to drive on motorways, so you only learn to drive on
motorways by following the example of others. Thankfully I learnt from my
father, who always made a point of moving to the inside lane as soon as it was
safe to do so. He gave a very good reason for doing so too. If you blow up an 
engine (which I've done ... twice), it's easier to pull over onto the hard 
shoulder from the inside lane. It also means faster cars can drive past you, 
and thus have less idiots trying to drive about a foot from your bumper.
<P>
This morning on the way to work I tagging two police cars, who were obviously
on a mission, as they did a constant 70mph down the outside lane. Bearly any
cars pulled over, but they did all slowed down though. I was even surprise to 
see a lorry driver have the gaul to overtake in the outside lane in front of 
them. It's illegal for lorries over 7.5 tonnes to overtake in the outside lane,
and if the cops hadn't have been on a mission, then I would like to think they 
would have pulled him over.
