<p><p>Taking a leaf out of the YAPC::NA organisers' book, it would be useful for the Copenhagen organisers for <a href="http://www.yapceurope2008.org/">YAPC::Europe 2008</a> to know if people are planning to meet up on the Tuesday evening. In previous years it's been very much a guesstimate as to how many people would turn for food/beer/pre-registration, so organisation hasn't always gone as well as planned. 

<p>Last year the guys from Vienna chose an excellent venue for the pre-conference meetup, but were totally overwhelmed by how many people turned up. So this year, to hopefully give the Copenhagen guys the opportunity to plan ahead and suggest somewhere that can accommodate all of us, I have updated the <a href="http://www.yapceurope2008.org/ye2008/wiki?node=PreconferenceMeeting">PreconferenceMeeting</a> page and so please add yourself (and any partners) to the list of attendees.
<p>
Please note that the pre-conference meetups are not part of the conference budget, so you are expected to fund your own beer and food expenses. However, if any company wanted to put a donation behind the bar, I'm sure the Copenhagen organisers would be delighted to co-ordinate things for you ;)
<p>
Also a reminder that if you're flying in to or out of Copenhagen Airport, add your <a href="http://www.yapceurope2008.org/ye2008/wiki?node=AirArrivals">arrival </a> and <a href="http://www.yapceurope2008.org/ye2008/wiki?node=AirDepartures">departure</a> times to the wiki too, so you can co-ordinate travel with others to and from the capital.</p>
