<p><b>Background</b>
<p>
During the early part of last year Birmingham Perl Mongers took to the road to promote the 2006 YAPC::Europe Perl Conference, which we hosted at the end of August 2006. We took it upon ourselves to visit several Perl Monger groups around the UK. It proved extremely popular and several groups asked to come back again, and some Linux user groups asked if we could visit them too. So this year we decided to do exactly that, although we've decided to give ourselves a bit of a challenge.
<p>
In 2006 it was purely a networking exercise, to get to know other Perl and Linux users around the country. For 2007, however, we are planning a bigger Perl promotion by performing via a speaking tour, with several members of Birmingham Perl Mongers attending Perl & Linux user groups around the UK, offering to present talks at their technical meetings about different aspects of Perl.
