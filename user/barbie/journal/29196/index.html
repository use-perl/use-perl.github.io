<p><P><a href='http://perl.grango.org/index.html'>http://perl.grango.org/index.html</a>
<P>Stats for March 2006 are now online. I note that report submissions are on the rise again. There seems to be a fresh surge now that Perl 5.8.8 is out there in the wild. However, it looks like all but one Perl 5.6.1 tester has moved on. In fact there are only 43 reports (out of 8871) that are for anything less than Perl 5.8.0.
<P>Jost Krieger is still hanging on at the <a href='http://perl.grango.org/testers.html'>top spot</a>, but Yen-Ming Lee is making a very determined effort to catch up.
<P>I've managed to map quite a few people to email addresses this month, as thankfully a few people have found the site and let me know which were their addresses. If you too have submitted some reports, take a look to see whether I still have just your email address listed or have mapped it to your name (and PAUSE id if you have one).
<P>With regard to mapping addresses to names, I'd like to make it clear, that you are completely free to submit from any email address you choose. It makes it easier for me if it's the same address as the one listed in the <a href='ftp://ftp.perl.org/pub/CPAN/authors/01mailrc.txt.gz'>authors list</a> or your cpan.org address, but it doesn't have to be. However, it is at least hoped that you use an email address that can reach you though, unlike 'root#localhost.localdomain ((root))' or similar. Not because I can map stats to you, but so CPAN authors can contact you should you post a report about a distribution of theirs, with test failings that they can't reproduce.</p>

Any chance you could add two additional graphs?<br><br>One would be just a graph of uploads, to show general CPAN author activity over time.<br><br>The second would be FAILs, on it's own, as a measure of quality ( although there's probably a better one involving FAILs as a percentage of total reports or something ).

Seeing as both are quite close together, it might be just as easy to have a single graph with just those 2 stats. I'll have a look at adding them in the week.

</p><p>Done. Although I'm not too sure what it shows. Bear in mind that CPAN Testers only test a selection of perls and platforms. Plus the number of testers has increased over time, so it's not too surprising that if a distribution fails it may fail for all testers.</p>
