<h2>Hotel websites</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/drhyde/">drhyde</a> on 2009-02-25T22:13:34</h3>
<p>I never cease to be amazed at how crappy hotel websites can be, but the City Inn site is Special.  <em>It doesn't appear to have their address on it</em>.  There's a map showing the main streets (but not *all* the streets), and there's "turn left, take the second right, go past three sets of traffic lights" style directions - but NO POSTCODE OR ADDRESS THAT SOMEONE COULD PUT INTO THEIR GPS THINGY.

</p><p>Impressive.

</p><p>Perhaps the QA hackathon should be dedicated to fixing their website for them<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>
