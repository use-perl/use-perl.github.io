<h1>YAML confusion with a List of Hashes</h1>
<h2><a href="/user/barbie/">barbie</a> on 2007-02-28T11:56:43</h2>
</div> <!-- /span4 -->


<div class="span8">
<p><p>The following is a snippet from a valid META.yml file:

<pre>
   optional_features:
     - foo:
       description:        test
       requires_os:        Linux
       requires:
         Test::More:       0.47
</pre>

<p>and below is the snippet of data that both YAML::LoadFile() and YAML::Syck::LoadFile() return:

<pre>
'optional_features' => 
  [
    {
      'foo'               => undef,
      'description'       => 'test',
      'requires_os'       => 'Linux',
      'requires'          => { 'Test::More' => '0.47' },
   }
  ],
</pre>

<p>
Note that 'foo' is inside the hash, not the first item in the list. To me
this is a design flaw, as it makes no sense to me having the list 
identifier as part of the hash. Plus it makes it painfully difficult to
validate. I would have expected the following:

<pre>
'optional_features' => 
  [
    'foo' => {
      'description'       => 'test',
      'requires_os'       => 'Linux',
      'requires'          => { 'Test::More' => '0.47' },
   }
  ],
</pre>

<p>Looking through the documents and bug reports I can't see anything that matches this, so I'm not sure whether I've misunderstood the specs or whether I have actually found a problem with the way YAML interprets this particular type of data structure. At the moment I don't have enough knowledge of YAML or YAML::Syck to understand how this is being parsed. Does anyone who knows them better than I, know whether this is a bug or expected behaviour?

<h2>Nesting in YAML</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ferreira/">ferreira</a> on 2007-02-28T12:45:59</h3>
<p>
The nesting of data structures in YAML blocks is indicated by indenting. So that:</p><p><blockquote> <div><tt>optional_features:<br>&nbsp; - foo:<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; description:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; test<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; requires_os:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Linux<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; requires:<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Test::More:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0.47</tt></div> </blockquote> is just a tight version of<p><blockquote> <div><tt>optional_features:<br>&nbsp; -<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; foo:<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; description:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; test<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; requires_os:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Linux<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; requires:<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Test::More:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0.47</tt></div> </blockquote> In contrast,<p><blockquote> <div><tt>optional_features:<br>&nbsp; - foo:<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; description:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; test<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; requires_os:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Linux<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; requires:<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Test::More:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0.47</tt></div> </blockquote> turns into<p><blockquote> <div><tt>'optional_features' =&gt;<br>&nbsp; [ { foo =&gt;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'description'&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;=&gt; 'test',<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'requires_os'&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;=&gt; 'Linux',<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'requires'&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; =&gt; { 'Test::More' =&gt; '0.47' },<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;}<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;}<br>&nbsp; ],</tt></div> </blockquote> which is closer to what you're looking for (I guess).

<p>Yep, that is more what I was after. I'd misunderstood the bit about indenting, as I'd indented from the list, not the map key. A new version of Test-YAML-Meta coming soon<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

I was interpreting the <a href="http://module-build.sourceforge.net/META-spec.html" title="sourceforge.net">current META.yml Specification</a sourceforge.net> (it's hidden within the Recommends section, as I think the heading has been accidentally omitted). I'd just got the indentation wrong<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

<h2>this is what you want</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/arakan/">arakan</a> on 2007-02-28T14:51:25</h3>
I think you have misunderstood the specs because you are getting the expected behaviour.<br><br>You are interested in the value of the "optional_features" key, and you expect that to be a ref to a list of two elements: the first element is "foo"; the second is a ref to a hash of the other data.<br><br>When you describe what you want you can see that the list has 2 elements.  So in YAML you need one "-" for each element.  So what you want is:<br><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; optional_features:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - foo<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - description:        test<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; requires_os:        Linux<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; requires:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Test::More:       0.47<br><br>

<tt>Actually, you need to *correct the indentation*.&nbsp; (Why does this site screw with my indentation in plain text?&nbsp; Yes, I should use "preview".&nbsp; I'm now using "code")<br><br>*This* is what you want:<br><br>optional_features:<br>&nbsp; - foo<br>&nbsp; - description: test<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; requires_os: Linux<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; requires:<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Test::More: 0.47<br><br></tt>

<p>Except it isn't<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)
</p><p>optional_features is a list, with each element of the list being a map with an identifier. The indentation I'd used made it look like the list element had no identifier, hence why 'foo =&gt; undef' existed inside the map, when I meant for it be the identifier for the map. <a href="http://use.perl.org/comments.pl?sid=34702&amp;cid=53414" title="perl.org">ferreira</a perl.org> has put me on the right track.
</p><p>As I suspected, I had just misunderstood the specs, as I didn't think I could have been the first person to come across this.
</p><p>As for indenting in use.perl, you want '&lt;ecode&gt;' tags not '&lt;code&gt;' tags<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<tt>Are you sure it isn't what you want?&nbsp; I'm trying to understand what you are describing.<br><br>You say "each element of the list being a map with an identifier".&nbsp; That is possible in Perl6, but in Perl5 a list (or array) element can only be a simple scalar or a reference to something.<br><br>So I think you must mean that you want a list that looks something like this:&nbsp; [ foo =&gt; {<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... } ]<br><br>Is that what you want?<br><br>That list has 2 elements: the first is "foo"; the second is a hashref.<br><br>In your initial post you said you expected<br><br>'optional_features' =&gt;<br>&nbsp; [<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; 'foo' =&gt; {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'description'&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;=&gt; 'test',<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'requires_os'&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;=&gt; 'Linux',<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'requires'&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; =&gt; { 'Test::More' =&gt; '0.47' },<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;}<br>&nbsp; ],<br><br>as your resulting data structure.&nbsp; That is exactly what is produced by my YAML:<br><br>optional_features:<br>&nbsp; - foo<br>&nbsp; - description: test<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; requires_os: Linux<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; requires:<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Test::More: 0.47<br><br>Try it.<br></tt>
