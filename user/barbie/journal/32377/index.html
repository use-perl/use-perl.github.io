<p><p>Thomas met us at the hotel and took us on a guided tour of the city yesterday. He was an excellent guide and knew how to get magnificent sights come into view at just the right moment. Walking out from the Royal Palace into the gardens beyond were breath taking. There are so many sights to see here that anyone coming for YAPC::Europe needs to take a few extra days to take it all in. I'll certainly be back again.
<p>I'll get my photos up online as soon as I can, but I think the highlight of our walk around the city, was walking across the gardens around SchloÃÅ¸ SchÃÂ¶nbrunn. As we came out into the open area in front of the palace, it wasn't the palace itself that blew us away, it was the Maria Theresien Kaserne on the top of the hill. Impressive isn't the word. We'd been walking around so much, none of us felt up to walking up and down the hill, so I'll be leaving that until next time. Thomas did say there was a magnificent view from up there though.
<p>The one thing that has really bowled me over though, is the size of the city. It's much bigger than I had thought, and there is just so much to see here. If you're into sightseeing and the like, you're going to have a great time here during the conference. </p>
