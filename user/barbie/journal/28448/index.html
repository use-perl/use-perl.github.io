<div class="span8">
<p><p>As <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/barbie/journal/28247">mentioned</a> at the beginning of the month, <a href="http://birmingham.pm.org/">Birmingham Perl Mongers</a> are planning to visit several of the Perl Monger user groups in the UK. We chose the ones that seem to have regular social or techincal meetings, rather than just being an online mailing list. Disappointingly there seem to be only 6 of us that have regular meetings. Well 5 really, as Belfast are holding a meeting in our honour :)</p>

<p>The disappointing bit for me is that we cover Northern Ireland, Scotland and England, but nothing in Wales. I know there are IT companies in Wales, but either there is no-one using Perl, or no-one is motivated enough to form a group. I suspect the latter. Being of Welsh heritage, I was hoping for a trip across the border. Mind you, I'm looking forward to visiting the other groups, as several members I've known online, but have yet to meet IRL.
</p>
<a href="">So here they are, the current tour dates. I'll fill in venues and stuff once they're known. If you're in the UK and would like to say hello to a few of us from Birmingham, feel free to either drop by our own meetings, or get to one of the group meetings below.

<pre>
  Birmingham Perl Mongers
    2006 World Tour of 
UK Perl Monger user groups

Thu  2 Mar - London
Wed 15 Mar - Belfast (*)
Wed  5 Apr - Nottingham (*)
Wed 12 Apr - Edinburgh
Thu 25 May - Milton Keynes
Thu  8 Jun - London
</pre>
<P>With the following added for good measure:
<pre>
 15-16 Jun - Nordic Perl Workshop - Oslo
 26-28 Jun - YAPC::NA::2006
 22-23 Jul - LugRadio Live 2006
 ??-?? ??? - YAPC::Europe::2006
</pre>

<p>There may also be return visits to Belfast and Milton Keynes before YAPC::Europe too. Starred (*) dates have yet to be confirmed, but it's pretty likely those will be the final dates.</p>

<p>[1] Being a fan of <a href="http://www.billyconnolly.com/">Billy Connolly</a>, it was an obvious choice to follow his style of travel guide title. Except we won't be telling jokes. Unless you're really unlucky!</p></p>

<h2>Geeky event in Wales</h2>

There is at least one geeky event in Wales this year!  There will be a mini-Linuxbierwanderung in Hay-on-Wye over the Easter weekend.  All are welcome, even Linux weenies and Brummies.

<p>I did consider this, but Nicole has other plans for me that weekend! It's a shame as its the closest LBW there's been since I discovered them. The only downer is it means I might spill beer while walking<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)
</p><p>I'll suggest it to the other B.pm'ers though. Is there a website with meeting/travel/accommodation details?</p>

There's no web site, but any questions will be answered on the LBW mailing list.
