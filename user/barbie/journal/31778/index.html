<p>I've updated the CPAN Testers Statistics site with all the latest numbers. Interesting to note that Chris Williams is making a gallant effort to become top-dog :) At his current rate he should make it in just over a year's time.
<p>There have been a number of new addresses appearing, many are for existing cpan-testers, but there are a notable number who aren't, or at least they are addresses I've not been able to map. Which brings me to my request.
<p>There are currently 563 addresses I've not been able to map, throughout the whole of the cpan-testers lifespan. Many of those address are likely to be from people who don't submit reports anymore, so there's not a lot I can do about that. However, of the existing and new cpan-testers, it would be useful if there was some way to easily recognise their posting name/address so that I can map them to known addresses. Now I can appreciate that some would like to keep their addresses hidden, but there are still two ways you can help me.
<p>The first is to use your PAUSEID@cpan.org mail address, which is already widely known on the web from your Perl contributions. However, that only works if you're a CPAN author. E.g. barbie@cpan.org.
<p>The second way is to use your name or PAUSEID (for those that prefer it) together with the email address, if you can configure it as such. E.g. "BARBIE" &lt;other-address@example.com&gt;
<p>So far there have been 881 by UNKNOWN USER, with addresses such as 'root@localhost', as well as the other 563 unmapped addresses. Having something that can help me associate these addresses to you would be very much appreciated.
<p>Note that if you are going to add a name to your submission, please don't use something like the following, as they don't help ;)
<ul>
<li>"MikeyB"
<li>"root"
<li>Admin Tls
<li>Admin Ulwww

<p>You can also let me know if there are any addresses in <a href="http://perl.grango.org/testers.html">the list</a> that are yours that I haven't mapped :)</p>

<h2>Can you track reporting tools?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/dagolden/">dagolden</a> on 2006-12-01T21:53:57</h3>
<p>In the "someday/maybe" category, I'd be interested in seeing statistics on how many reports are coming from different reporting tools, e.g. YACSmoke, CPANPLUS, CPAN::Reporter, etc.  Or how many people are using each tool.</p>

<p>I think that might be have to be done parsing each message for "this report was made by<nobr> <wbr></nobr>..." strings rather than just tracking headers, so it would take a little bit of work, I guess.</p>

It's certainly something I've been thinking about, but just haven't had the time to implement. At the moment I don't parse the body of the report, but it shouldn't be too hard to add that in. I'm planning some changes over the next month to try and promote CPAN Testing and introduce some howtos, both to authors to get their distributions tested, and to potential testers to learn how to get involved. More news on that soon<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

<h2>Coooooool....</h2>

Wow, thank you so much for compiling this. Was this automated, or did you manually have to comb through every address? (Or at least, though the addresses that weren't identical to the cpan author addresses?)<br><br>I'm also impressed that you were able to attach my reports to me. I'm guessing it was because they were all from the same domain name. Did you do a whois, or did you  connect it through my cpan author page?

<p>All the report parsing is automated. However, the address mapping is part script and part manual labour. The script searches through the 01mailrc file for known PAUSE addresses, and through the known mappings and attempts to find matches to domains. Of the rest I lookup peoples domains, sometimes a whois and see whether there are any clues via Google. The manual part usually only happens when I have some free time and feel like wandering around the web.
</p><p>In your case, your domain did make it an easy spot<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<p>What's your objection to Agent Zhang, who's known for <a href="http://groups.google.co.uk/groups?as_ugroup=perl.*&amp;as_uauthors=Agent+Zhang" title="google.co.uk">contributions to Perl&nbsp;6 development</a google.co.uk>?</p>

<p>Nothing, I just didn't realise it referenced a real person<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) Will update for the next run of the web scripts. Apologies to Agent Zhang for missing this one.
</p><p>Thanks Smylers for the update.</p>
