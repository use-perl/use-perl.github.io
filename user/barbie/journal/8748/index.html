<p>I've just finished a very eventful day. My son DanDan was 2 and we had a bit of a family party, with lots of presents, cards, food and trifle :) DanDan was more interested in his new toy car, which is a model of <a href="http://www.brum.tv/">Brum</a>, the car from the kids TV show. If you've never seen it, it's a classic. It's also shot on location around Birmingham so I'm hoping I can get DanDan into town one of the days when they are filming. It's great to watch.
<P>
On Saturday I finally managed to get the last 8 months worth of photos onto DanDan's site, which all came with the aid of my latest lessons in how to use Image::Magick (which was nice). I completely cleaned the code I was using and it is now mod_perl ready once I get my other server back on it's feet. I'm a bit loathed to advertise DanDan's site here [1], so if you do want to have a look, email me privately and I'll send you the link.
<P>
I've also just finished a nice little professional society site. A paid experience too :) They didn't need much, just basic secure logins, but the hope is that we can get them to part with more cash in the future to extend their publishing system, and to add things like forums. Could be a nice little earner, along with all the associate sites they have. Here's hoping anyway.
<P>
[1] Aside from the fact it's a private site and not for the listings of Google and the like, I also don't want to get it on spammer's lists either. Especially as we had to close DanDan's old hotmail account as it was getting stupid amounts of spam, the majority of which was porn.</p>
