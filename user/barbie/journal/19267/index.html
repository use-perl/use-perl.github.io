<p>So I haven't properly written anything in my journal for a while. Mostly due to too much happening elsewhere in my life, both work and social. 
<P>
I got a promotion, I'm now a Technical Architect/Development Manager for Infrastructure, which alas doesn't come with the kind of salary you might expect from a grand title. However, it does sound better than just Software Engineer. This means I have to people manage again, though thankfully my team are a pretty good bunch. They were actually quite relived it was me who got the job ... at least that's what they tell me ;) Still trying to get to grips with the role, but it's likely to mean more meetings that I really want.
<P>
Finally finished the 1st phase of my Labyrinth project, which is running the Birmingham for 2006 Bid site. As yet I'm awaiting the other committee members to have a play and attempt to break it. In the meantime, I've ported DanDan's website and I'm now porting the Birmingham.pm website. There are two other websites I aim to have ready during the summer too. If all goes well, a set of servers will be up and ready during August, which will then host my little empire.
<P>
I've started to acquire a number of parts for my various broken machines, HDD donated from friends and a BX motherboard bought on eBay. I now have another donation of a gateway that I need to set up and finally get my LAN up and running. The Wireless router is being a pain, as I still can't get it to talking to anything. The manual implies I'm supposed to have a Win32 laptop to get it to work, which just sounds daft. I'll perserve though.
<P>
There is other news on the horizon, but I shall save that for another time. </p>
