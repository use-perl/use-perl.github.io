<p>Having spent the last few months pretty much ignoring gigs as I knew I wouldn't be able to afford them, I thought I'd start surfing to see what's out there yesterday. To say I was chuffed after a half an hour's surf would be putting it midly.
<P>
First off I discover that <a href="http://www.tmtch.net">The Men They Couldn't Hang</a> have reformed and are planning a new album and tour soon. Then much to my extreme delight I discover that <a href="http://www.henryrollins.com">Henry Rollins</a> is doing a spoken word tour at the moment and due to hit the UK in a couple of weeks time.
<P>
I have been a fan of TMTCH since the late 80s and have seen many a fine gig by them. For anyone unfamiliar with them, think The Pogues with an English rather Irish flavour. 
<P>
With Henry Rollins, I am very much a fan of his spoken word stuff, but not very much his musically output. His insights into touring (on Think Tank he recalls his first ventures into Russia, and Eric The Pilot is a must) are hilarious and remind me alot of the things I and others got upto on tour. Though we were never as extreme as Henry! When he starts talking about general experiences, observations or about things that bug him, he can be humorous, philosophical, insightful but most of all entertaining. I first saw him a few years ago in London and was shocked to realise he just talks until he feels like stopping, about virtually anything that comes to mind. After well over 2 hours I felt I'd got my moneys worth.
<P>
If you fancy something a bit different, I'd recommend both. I've booked my tickets :)
<P>
Now if only <a href="http://www.kmfdm.net">KMFDM</a> would tour the UK.... </p>

<h2>TMTCH</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/davorg/">davorg</a> on 2003-03-31T12:44:17</h3>
<p>I've TMTCH more times since they split up than I did when they were together. I first saw them in 1988 when they played a promotional set in the Virgin Megastore on Oxford St when <i>Waiting for Bonapart</i> was released. The only time I've paid to see them was at their "final" gig in 1991. Since then I've seen them numerous times at various festivals.</p>
<p>Thanks for reminding me that I don't have any of their albums on CD. I'm just off to spend some money<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

If you like The Men They Couldn't Hang you got to get hold of <b>Swill's</b> solo album <b>"The Day After"</b>. <p>Swill is the singer/acoustic guitarist with TMTCH and has made an album and an EP. I've been to the 'Mens' live gigs as well as Swill solo gigs and they really are something else : ). Actually, I say solo but as a backing band he does sometimes use the brilliant 'Swaggerband' which comprises of Ricky (bass player) and Jon (drummer) of TMTCH.

</p> <p>Have a look at <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/folk/roaringjack/21c.html" title="angelfire.com">http://www.angelfire.com/folk/roaringjack/21c.html</a angelfire.com> and <a href="http://www.tmtch.net/" title="tmtch.net">http://www.tmtch.net/</a tmtch.net> for more info. I know you can buy the CD at TMTCH.net but resources on the web seem to be very limited so if you find any other links please let me know.</p>

Swill has a new EP about to come out and there is an offer on www.tmtch.net to buy an advance copy and also get a name check on the 2nd album.<br/><br/>there are also some snippets of some of the EP tracks in the news section of tmtch.net. These are sounding great!

<h2>Rollins keeps on talking</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/merijnb/">merijnb</a> on 2003-04-03T11:39:00</h3>
I can testify to the fact that Henry Rollins keeps on talking. I once saw him live and the organisers of the event booted him of the stage at midnight. When my friends and I were sitting at the entrance afterwards talking about stuff he just sat with us and kept going till 2 am or so. Maybe I should go see his show on the 13th in London.<br> <br>His talking CDs are just hilarious. I love listening to them on the commute, and the other passengers must think you're an idiot if you sit round with a huge smile and occasionally cackling loudly.

I used to listen to a variety of Henry's talking CDs  on the bus into work. It was a struggle sometimes to stop the tears of laughter. I often wondered whether the passengers thought I was weirdo<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... then again they would probably be right<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
