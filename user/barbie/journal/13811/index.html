<p>Got to the airport for just after noon, and had a spot of overpriced and overcooked Chicken Tikka Masalla (I like my curries) from Terminal 2's "restaurant". It fed me at least, but I've had a lot better. Plane food compared well, never tried goats cheese before. Went on to try it several times in Paris. Nice.
<P>
<a href='http://yapc.mongueurs.net/yapc/info/?id=jon'>JJ</a> and I landed 65 minutes later at CDG. At first the 10 Euro bus ride to <a href='http://www.paris.org/Monuments/Arc/'>Arc de Triomphe</a> seemed expensive, but in comparison to the rest of the visit, it wasn't so bad after all. After much carrying of heavy bags, we finally made it to the hotel. JJ and I discovered <a href='http://yapc.mongueurs.net/yapc/info/?id=lilstevey'>Steve</a> didn't know where he was staying and had been wandering around the locale checking out the <a href='http://www.paris.org/Monuments/Luxembourg/'>Jardins et Palais du Luxembourg</a> (or Luxembourg Park) among other things. We tell him to meet us at the pub in a little while.
<P>
Quickly dump bags and freshen up, then onto registration at <a href='http://www.cnam.fr/'>CNAM</a> before it closes. <a href='http://use.perl.org/user/BooK/'>BooK</a> comes and says hello, which was nice, and I also said hello to a few other Paris organisers who's names I recognised. Collect goody bag and head to the pub round the corner. Greeted by many London.pm'ers who I hadn't seen for ages ... well at least since last Thursday :) Steve catches up with us, and after a quick beer goes in search of his hotel. Beer, we quickly realise, is going to be in short supply, mainly due to the fact that at ÃÂ£5 (at least) a pint, we're not going to be able to afford much. The Paris crew tempt us with cheaper beer and food to their local bar, just off <a href='http://www.paris-views.com/html/HTML2912.htm?0,1,Title,2912'>Place de la Republique</a>. They serve stout ... yeah!!! Finally we head for the hotel and an earlyish night.
<P>
PS If you've never been to Paris, I recommend at least seeing the following <a href='http://www.paris-tourist-information.co.uk/Paris-Places-Of-Interest.htm'>monuments and structures</a>. The hotels are optional ;)
