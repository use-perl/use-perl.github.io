<p><p>I'm not sure if this is supposed to be a secret, but seeing as it's listed on <a href="http://yapc.org">yapc.org</a> and the first post to the website states it being launched to the public, I guess there was supposed to have been announcement. For those of you, like me who missed the announcement, who are interested in attending <a href="http://conferences.mongueurs.net/yn2008/">YAPC::NA 2008</a>, you may want to add yourselves to the website and update the <a href="http://conferences.mongueurs.net/yn2008/wiki">wiki</a>. Now I know the dates I can actually plan to be there :)</p>

You didn't miss the announcement because they're still working on it. The website is online and you can submit proposals, but the organizers haven't been ready to announce it yet.

Ah! In that case someone jumped the gun by adding it to the yapc.org front page. The site looks fine to launch to me.

Well, I think adding it to yapc.org is one of the things on the list toward announcing it<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) The site <i>looks</i> good, and I think Josh has figured out the ACT things he was integrating. He talked about it at last night's Windy City Perl Mongers meeting, so I think it's just writing the announcement now that he knows everything works.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br><br>

No biggie guys<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)  It seems like I caused a little bit of confusion at last night's pm meeting... the <a href="http://yapc.org/America" title="yapc.org">http://yapc.org/America</a yapc.org> is ready to go, we'll be updating it often as we add sponsors and other conference information.  What is/was still kind of secret is that the proposal submission is actually turned on now even though we haven't opened up the call for participation yet... there were a few people that were asking us when they could post their submissions and I didn't want to hold them back so I silently flipped the CFP bit for them:)<br/><br/>As far as not announcing that the site was ready on use.perl.org, I can't believe that forgot to do that.

I really always wanted to hit YAPC, and this year I'm not going fishing in Canada for a week (thanks DHS for the passport requirements), but taking off a M-W is hate. Sometimes I wish it was T-F-Sat, leaving Sunday for travel.

Dude, it's work-related<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)  Your employer should be paying you to attend.  It's worth it.
