<p><P>After a long flight, but not quite as long as cog's, I arrived safely in Chicago. After failing to get a connection to cog's phone, I figured he must have headed off. So I went in search of the Blue Line myself. I found it fairly quickly, and got the first train. I was just about at Clark/Lake, when cog suddenly appeared at my side.
<P>We checked in and discoveedr we are in a very nice part of the dorm. The other dorm and the conference building are a few minutes walk away and the 7-11 is handily located between the two dorms. There are some students around and even a few sitting outside with laptops, so perhaps not as scarey as was first imagined.
<P>Cog and myself got something to eat and drink and sat outside til we started to feel tired. The weather is very pleasant and pretty much on a par with british weather at the moment. I'm hoping it stays that way for the rest of the week.
<P>Heading off to do some sightseeing tomorrow before the crowds descend, plus cog wants to watch the Portugal match in the afternoon. I don't mind as I need to get on with some code fixes and I really need to do some rework on my slides for my talk for Monday. 
<P>But we're here and that's the main thing :)</p>
