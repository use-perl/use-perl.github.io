<p>Thought I'd install <a href='http://search.cpan.org/author/INGY/CGI-Kwiki-0.17/'>CGI::Kwiki</a> on my box here as a personal todo, ideas and thoughts site. Unfortunately it doesn't work on Windows :(
<P>
It complains that I haven't got a PERL5LIB, even though its a Registery setting and just for added value I put it in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file. Still no joy. If I had the time I would look though and figure out where it thinks PERL5LIB is stored, but alas I don't, so I won't.
<P>
Back to pen and paper....</p>

<p>It does work honest! Ignore the failed tests and give it a go. If you have a look on CPAN, check the RT entry for it and you will see:</p>

<p>I don't know if you got
http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/cpan-testers/2003-04/msg02224.html
but you still got the same problem</p> <blockquote><div> <tt>#ok(system("PERL5LIB=../../blib/lib;../../blib/script/kwiki-install") == 0);<br>ok(system("$^X -Mblib=../../blib/lib<nobr> <wbr></nobr>../../blib/script/kwiki-install") == 0);</tt> </div></blockquote> <p>I've pointed this out to Brian, and he says he'll fix it.</p>

Thanks. Will try that tomorrow. I was most disappointed not to have it up and running. I've been meaning to try it for a while and just haven't had the time.

<p>I went though the same cycle. I thought this looks "cool", tried to install it, it failed, gave up for a bit and then tried again.</p>

<p>Once you look at the tests, you can see why the tests won't run on a non-Unix box, and if you check the subsequent tests you'll see that they are so basic as to being next to useless.</p>

<p>However that aside, I think it's a great little application. Brian is a busy bod, but seems to take some suggestions on board, so it's worth nagging him to make changes to the core, and it's designed so you can change the bits you don't like easily. There is even wiki just for it <a href="http://www.kwiki.org/" title="kwiki.org">www.kwiki.org</a kwiki.org> where you can make suggestions too.</p>

I had a quick (haha) look at the Kwiki Wiki (!!) and didn't see anything obvious for a fix, but then I didn't have the time to do a delve into the code.
<p>
Did the fix, ran kwiki_install and as if by magic the Wiki appeared<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

Lovely. Thanks for the fix.</p>
