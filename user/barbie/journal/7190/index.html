<p>I have been hoping I could release my personal debug module, which had been christened Devel::DebugPrint. Unfortunately it was pointed out to me that Log::Dispatch and it's associated modules can actually do most of what mine can do. Initially i had been resistant to it as it was all OO based, whereas mine is a basic collection of routines.
<P>
The 2 main plus points for my module are that it is all self contained with no other module dependancies and can be used at it's basic with a simple call.
<P>
I will look at implementing a version with Log::Dispatch and see if I can get it to work easily with my original idea. If it works I may be moved enough to write a Log::Dispatch::Lite type module, otherwise my module may get it's release afterall.
<P>
I currently have so much on it's difficult to find time to fiddle around and come up with a new module. Now that I've got KOffice working on my laptop, I will look at some Perl scripts that I can write to implement the stuff I had on Excel. maybe a module will jump out from that.
<P>
My other module that I have designs over is provisionally entitled MIME::Descs. It ties in with MIME::Types and MIME::Type in that it provides long descriptions of the MIME types available. One of our clients had the idea that it would be nice to have major formats listed so that when someone uploads a file to the system, they could be told what it was and ask whether they were sure!!!!
<P>
After looking at the method employed by MIME::Types to extract the mime-type, I created a similar script, but with descriptions instead. Not sure if it'll be of any use to anyone else, and will require maintenance everytime a new mime-type is created, but it might be worthwile.</p>
