<p>The BBC news site announced that <a href='http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/3346241.stm'>Springsteen tops concert earners</a>. Interesting that while record companies bemoan the fact that they are losing money, the actual artists who go and do the hard work of touring and performing (Springsteen regularly plays up to 3 hours per gig ... 4 on a good night) are getting respectable rewards.
<P>
<a href='http://www.pollstar.com/'>Pollstar</a>, who compile the figures above, also reported recently that <a href='http://www.pollstar.com/news/viewnews.pl?NewsID=2999'>Recording Industry Loses A Big One</a>. It's a loophole, but does mean that many may evade prosecution ... or is that persecution?</p>

The ruling says that RIAA can't require ISPs to identify users without getting a judge to agree that there is reason. So, for now at least, there is less chance of innocent users receiving lawsuit demands; there will be far fewer lawsuit demands in general since the RIAA can't use vague suggestive evidence to lauch a lawsuit and back down if they are shown to be wrong. Of course, after they've gone around the circle a few times, they will find a combination of evidence that a typical (or favoured) judge will deem adequate and automate collecting that level of evidence and start getting mass applications.  It's a hiccough and a slowdown, not a stop to their actions.</p>

Like most loopholes. They are soon closed when business deems it necessary. I'm just waiting for the day someone uses an RIAA officials PC for downloading music<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... and gets found out!
<p>
I might even put a disclaimer on my website that allows anyone except employees of RIAA to download the music. Then it's just a matter of watching the IP addresses<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) Not that I can do anything about it as I'm not in the US.</p>
