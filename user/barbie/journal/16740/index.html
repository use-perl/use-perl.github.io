<p>This Christmas was a subdued affair. Nicole was very ill through most of it, and on New Years Day her gran suffered what was initially thought to be a heart-attack. Thankfully it wasn't, but did give everyone a scare. Also the HDD on my development machine, that I was planning to reinvent as my graphics machine, crashed permanently :(
<P>
DanDan seemed to have a good time though, as I ended up walking him round the shops trying to sort out a broken remote controlled car that Father Christmas had bought him. We ended up at ToysRUS and I got him a Land Rover Discovery style car. It's suppose to be for older kids, but he's already a dab-hand driving it round the house. 
<P>
He's also learnt how to use my Playstation (he learnt how to use the cable, video and DVD machines months ago), though he's only interested the racing games. I only have Wipeout 3 and demo of Lego Racers from a cover disk, but he thinks they're great. Will have to start looking in the second-hand shops and eBay for job lots of PS1 games now :)
<P>
Seeing as he's quick to pick things up, I've been letting him spend more time on the PC at home. He can point and click round the <a href='http://www.bbc.co.uk/cbeebies'>CBeebies</a> website pretty much. Any worded instructions we have to help with, but he's got used to where things are these days. I'm just wondering how soon it'll be before he starts finding bugs in my code :)<br/><br/>

<h2>That brings back memories...</h2>

I remember my son when he was 4 (and not yet able to read) calling me:<p>

"Dad, come here, I can't get the floppy to eject.  Oh, wait a minute, I found it.  Did you know that there are at least 4 ways to get the floppy to eject?"

(This was on a Mac Plus, which dates it considerably.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>
