<p>I recently download a broadcast of the <a href="http://thedent.com/more.php?id=272_0_1_0_C">Oxygen Custom Concert</a> that Tori Amos did on March 16th for the Oxygen network. Not being in the US means we don't get stuff like this, unless some kind soul posts it in the binary newsgroups ... which they did :)
<P>
While watching the show back the other night I was intrigued to hear which cover song she had elected to do. As I think most of here approaches to covers have been brilliant. The song she chose was Desperado, the Eagles classic. She did an interesting version, but it didn't grab me in the way other renditions do. In particular Andrew Whyment's rendition.
<P>
For anyone not in the UK, there is a phenomenon called 'Stars In Their Eyes'. Every now and then they have a celebrity edition. Earlier this year there was Coronation Street (UK soap) edition, which featured Andrew Whyment (who plays Kirk Sutherland) doing Desperado. If you've ever seen the soap (my other insists on it!) then you'll probably know his voice and perhaps agree he doesn't sound like a singer. However, my mouth hit the floor when he started singing Desperado. Incredible voice. Unfortunately the girl who plays his sister won the show, even though she didn't deserve it IMHO. I just wished I'd taped the show now.
<P>I should perhaps note that I don't normally watch Coronation Street or Stars In Their Eyes, but seeing as my other half enjoys them, I usually end up sitting with her, tapping away at the laptop ... or asleep.</p>
