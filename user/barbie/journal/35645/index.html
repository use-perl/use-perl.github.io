<p><p><b>Birmingham.pm World Tour 2008 - Leicester LUG - 13th February 2008</b>
<p>Tonight is the second date of the <a href="http://birmingham.pm.org/article/bwt2008">Birmingham Perl Mongers 2008 World Tour</a>. We'll be visiting <a href=" http://www.leicester.lug.org.uk">Leicester LUG</a>, where I'll be presenting a talk entitled "Understanding Malware". The talk happily coincides with MessageLabs' <a href="http://www.messagelabs.com/threats?c=WW729BpQp4GLx7X2QWb46g%3d%3d">"Know Your Enemy"</a> campaign, which means I have a few freebies to give away too.
<p>The event takes place at Leciester University, and the Leicester LUG guys have created a <a href="http://www.leicester.lug.org.uk/next.php">meetings page</a> with links to the university pages with maps and directions, as well as the necessary info to find room 527 in the Ken Edwards Building, where the talk will take place. I am due to start sometime between 7.30.pm and 8pm and the talk will be for about an hour, with a Q&A session afterwards. They then head to the pub for a debrief. 
<p>

<p><b>Background</b>
<p>
In early 2006 Birmingham Perl Mongers took to the road to promote the 2006 YAPC::Europe Perl Conference, which we hosted at the end of August 2006. We took it upon ourselves to visit several Perl Monger groups around the UK, and proved extremely popular, with several groups asked to come back again, and others asking us to visit them too. In 2007 we visited both Perl Monger and Linux user groups, this time presenting at each groups technical meeting. For 2008 we hope to include several groups we never previous got to as well visiting some old friends.
