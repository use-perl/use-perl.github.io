<p>As predicted, Chris has become the first tester to submit over 10,000 reports. Not a bad feat for someone who has only been testing for 2 years. This month our top 3 testers all submitted over 4,000 reports, so congrats to Chris, Andreas and David for that. At the other end of the scale we have seen 31 new tester addresses recently, of which 18 I've been able to identify, with 12 being new testers, so the promotion of CPAN Testers seems to be working :)

<p>Also worth noting regards the new addresses, is that thanks to the inclusion of easily identifiable handles, I was able to quickly match testers to their addresses, so many thanks to those who included them. During June and July there are still 13 addresses I've not been able to match, so let me know if you spot your address in the <a href="http://perl.grango.org/testers.html">lists</a>.

<p>Unfortunately the testing seems to <a href="http://perl.grango.org/rmatrix.html">mostly centre</a> on 5.8.8, but on a plus side it is being covered on 44 out of 53 different platforms. However, it would be good to see other perls getting tested with all the latest distributions.

What has surprised me is to see 17 distributions leap into the top 100 <a href="http://perl.grango.org/wdists.html">Highest Failure Counts</a>, 7 of which where distributions released last month and the other 10 being distributions who report counts have been added to last month. The Top 100 <a href="http://perl.grango.org/wpcent.html">Highest Percentage Counts</a> might look to have faired better with only 8 distributions climbing into the 100, has 14 distributions released last month featured. The difference being that older versions have been updated and released, but still seem to be suffering from test failures.</p>
