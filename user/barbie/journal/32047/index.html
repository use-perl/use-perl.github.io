<p>A few minor changes to the layout. Firstly, the listings for the Stats By Month are now all listed with the most recent entries first, so you don't have to scroll to the bottom of the page just to see what's changed. Secondly, I've tabulated all the data, to make it easier to use CSS. I'll probably extend this further at some point, but I'll leave it for now.
<p>Chris Williams is now surging for top place in the Top Testers of all time, and I should imagine he'll be ahead by this time next month. Yi Ma Mao is likely to regain 2nd place again once she passes Jost in a few months time. 
<p>Once again there is a high proportion of FAIL reports, even though the total number of reports dropped. On a positive note though, there were only a few badly submitted uploads and reports last month, and it seems that those getting involved in CPAN Testing are all using one of the recommended testing tools.
<p>I haven't had as much time as I would have liked to work on CPAN-YACSmoke last year, but I now have a new box with which to do some proper CPAN Testing with. As such the initial plan is to create an environment to find bugs in the latest codebase and improve the test suite. Then I shall be looking to implement many of the changes that have been hiding in notes, such as allowing the tester to choose whether they use CPAN or CPANPLUS as the installer mechanism. We'll see how I progress.</p>

<p>.... Barbie! For all his hard work generating these statistics</p>

<p>Also for CPAN::YACSmoke</p>

<p>Though I would say, having looked at the SVN of CPAN::YACSmoke if there was some way to reduce the number of dependencies, 0.03_08 seems to want to install DBI for instance.</p>

<p>I have some suggestions as well which I have been trialing to bring CPAN::Reporter functionality to CPAN::YACSmoke ( the %ENV report etc. ), I'll send you an email regarding it though</p>

<p><div class="quote">reduce the number of dependencies</div>  <p>That is something I would also like to reduce. The plugins for the data storage require DBI, but it would be nice to simplify the dependencies. Another reason why I would like to make the requirement of the installer a user choice, thus removing all the dependencies CPANPLUS has if the tester only wishes to use CPAN/CPAN-Reporter.</p><p><div class="quote">I have some suggestions<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...</div>  <p>Please send them my way. I want to be able to get a release out before any major rework is done, but certainly any small items can be looked at before then.</p>
