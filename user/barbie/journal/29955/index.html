<p><P>
So I noticed something about the YAPC::NA schedule the other day. I'm the only native British speaker (at least that I'm aware of) on it! At the moment I only know of one other British based attendee. It's a far cry from previous years, when there was a notable contingent from London.pm attending. I must be missing something. Was there a notice that said UK based perl hackers should not attend? 
<P>
Part of my reason for attending YAPC::NA is so I can see some of the talks that are appearing at YAPC::Europe this year, as then I'm unlikely to have time to see them. I'm also looking forward to seeing some of the talks that won't be appearing at YAPC::Europe either, such as Adam's PITA talk. I'll also be interested to see how the 4 track approach works, as although our 4 tracks aren't quite the same, it does spread out the attendance to the talks a little more.
<P>
All in all I'm quite impressive by both schedules. There are some common talks, but by in large there  is a strong lineup from both sides of the Atlantic.</p>

<p>This year, I don't think that anyone from Fotango is speaking at YAPC::NA. I believe that several are attending though, so you won't be alone.</p>

It may not be representative of all of Britain, but if it will help I shall wear orange in support.

I'm having a year off this year.  I'm going to be attending YAPC::NA and YAPC::Europe, but after five YAPC::Europes, four YAPC::NA and two London Perl Workshops (which I've spoken at every single one, including the ones I wasn't meant to be speaking at,) I think it's time I went to one of these things and didn't speak for once.
