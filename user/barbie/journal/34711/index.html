<p><p>I've been a bit quiet for the past month or so, mostly because projects both at work and home have taken up a lot of my time. One of the home projects has involved creating some report documents in PDF. When first thinking about this, I was looking at PDF::API2, and various other PDF modules, but was struck at how much layout work is put into the code. I don't like having to mix the two, as if I have to change anything in the layout it means changing the code. Reading a <a href="http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2007/09/20/pdf-processing-with-perl.html">recent article</a> on perl.com only reaffirms that. If you're creating a special document, this might work for you, but it doesn't for me.
<p>Thanks to <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/andrewf/">Andrew Ford</a> and <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX">wikibooks</a>, I have been learning how to mix <a href="http://www.latex-project.org/">LaTeX</a> with <a href="http://www.template-toolkit.org/">Template Toolkit</a>. My current installed version of the <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Template-Latex/">plugin</a> (2.17) doesn't go as far as I need it to at the moment, but the <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/andrewf/Template-Plugin-Latex-3.00_05/">newest version</a> and its new dependency, <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/LaTeX-Driver/">Latex::Driver</a>, do. Unfortunately I've been finding problems with it on Win32, so I'm currently working through those with Andrew and hopefully he'll be able to get a working Win32 version out soon.
<p>However, following Andrew's encouragement to look at Latex, I was quite impressed at just how easy it was to learn the basics, and in fact I kind of jumped in at the deep end and was creating complex headers, footers, tables and graphics in my first document. I found a problem though, that none of the expert forums seem to have solved, as I want to swap a page layout from Portrait to Landscape mid document, but apart from that everything has worked wonderfully. 
<p>If you are ever in a situation where you need to produce regular reports from various data sources, and templating would feel a natural way to go, I heartily recommend looking at Latex with Template Toolkit.
<p>Andrew will be giving an introduction to his modules at the next Birmingham Perl Mongers technical meeting. If I can manage it, I'll see whether I can record it on video. Assuming Andrew doesn't mind of course :)</p>
