<p><p> The YAPC::Europe::2006 Backstage Pass<br /> Bulletin 11.2<br /> - A 'Behind The Scenes' missive from the organisers

<p><b>"Thunder In The Mountains" (Lightning Talks)</b>
<p>Have something to say that everyone at YAPC should hear? Want 5 minutes of fame? Then what are you waiting for? Sign up for a Lightning Talk today. 
<p>Lightning talks are a regular feature of YAPCs, which enable attendees to participate in quick fire talks, without the overhead of worrying about whether you got your talk presentation just right. You don't even need slides. If you have a project or topic you want to announce, that would only take 5 minutes to tell everyone about, now's your chance.
<ul>
<li><a href="http://wiki.birmingham2006.com/wiki.pl?LightningTalks">http://wiki.birmingham2006.com/wiki.pl?LightningTalks</a>
</ul>

<p><b>"Victims Of The Riddle" (Registration)</b>
<p>We have over 200 registered users of the website, of which over 160 are now confirmed. We have some bank transfers pending, so that number is likely to rise over the next few days. If you're planning to attend, we advise you to register as soon as possible, as once numbers start to approach our limit, we will have to disable conference registration.
<p>If you are planning a bank transfer, please ensure it reaches us by Friday 25th August. Unless we have funds in our account, we cannot confirm your attendance. If you don't see yourself as a confirmed registered user when you login to the website, but believe you should be, please contact us as soon as possible.

<p><b>"In The Fairground" (Jobs)</b>
<p>Shopzilla are looking to hire some cool Perl programmers. If you're interested take a look at their full page advert (PDF)

</ul>

<p><b>"Street Addict" (Directions)</b>
<p>Over the next week, we will start to upload lots of direction information for everyone. How to get from the airport to the city centre, from the city centre to the hotels and then from the hotels to the venue. We'll also include references to places to eat and drink around the venue. The city centre is within 5 minutes walk, but around Broad Street, Brindleyplace and The Mailbox there are a plethora of restaurants, bars and pubs, and even two supermarkets.

<p><b>"Blue Meanings" (Early Arrival Plans)</b>
<p>So everyone is aware of plans for the two days before the conference, we thought we'd be best to share some of them with you now.
<p>Firstly on Monday 28th August, a number of people will be in Brum early. As such we are planning to meet up at a local pub (to be determined) and move on to an Indian restaurant located close to the Jury's Inn. If you would like to join us, please add your name to the Arriving Early wiki page, so we know who to contact with further information.
<ul>
<li><a href="http://wiki.birmingham2006.com/wiki.pl?ArrivingEarly">http://wiki.birmingham2006.com/wiki.pl?ArrivingEarly</a>
</ul>
<p>On Tuesday 29th August, virtually everyone else will be joining us. We have booked the Panama Bar, which is approximately 2 minutes walk from the venue, on the banks of the canal. We have an area allocated to us for doing registration stuff, but feel free to come and go as you please. Note that registration will also happen during the conference too, at the front desk in the foyer.
<p>Please also note that The Panama Bar doesn't serve food. However, The Mailbox, Brindleyplace and Broad Street all have plenty of restaurants, if you wanted to go eat for a bit and rejoin us later. Registration will start about 6pm and probably finish when the bar closes (11pm), at which point we shall adjourn to the bar and foyer of Jury's Inn.

</ul>
<p>Then the fun begins.
<p>After the conference, on Saturday 2nd September, there will also be a meetup for those staying for the weekend. We'll announce where we'll be meeting at the end of the conference.

<p><b>"Urban Tribesman" (Security)</b>
<p>Due to the fact that the CBSO foyer is open during the day for the public to buy tickets for forthcoming events, we would like to ensure that everyone in the rest of the building is supposed to be there. As such, please ensure you have your conference badge with you at all times. Venue and conference staff may challenge you if they are not sure who you are, so please do not be offended if you are asked. 
<p>Conference badges will be distributed with your conference bag during registration.

<p><b>"It's A Mystery" (Any Questions?)</b>
<p>If there are any issues or questions, please direct them to the <a href="mailto:organisers@birmingham2006.com">organisers</a>.
