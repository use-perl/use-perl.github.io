<p><P>I'm busy trying to get everything sorted here at work, so everyone knows what to do in my absence. Mostly it's going to plan, but I have stand-ins in case of emergency.
<P>
My last day actually at work for August is tomorrow. Friday I head down to London to represent ML for Perl 5 Day. I'm quite looking forward to that, as there are some ideas I have that it would be interesting to see how others percieve them and their importance. It'll also be good to catch up with everyone before Braga, particularly as some won't be able to make it.
<P>
Then I have a weekend that is meant to be free, but probably won't be, as there are already plans afoot to keep me going til the last minute.
<P>
Finally Tuesday we fly out. The ML crew and Birmingham.pm crew all land around 4pm, so we're hoping to get a cab to Braga, seeing as it works out cheaper and less hassle getting buses and trains. Hopefully cog and ambs will have found a good place for us all to meet in the evening. <a href='http://use.perl.org/user/lilstevey/journal/'>Our scout</a> is keeping us up to date with things to bring. Steve's word of warning: make sure you bring a drink with you, as once you get off the plane it may be confusing to find where you can buy something.
<p>
I still have to think about the fixes to my slides, as I've had a few suggestions since Canada, and there are some updates I need to include. I had hoped I'd get them done this week, but that seems unlikely at the moment. Whatever happens, I will be presenting something. In fact I'm presenting 3 talks, which I'm now wondering was a good idea. Whatever happens, it'll be fun!
<p>
Looking forward to seeing everyone again. Was Belfast really a year ago!</p>
