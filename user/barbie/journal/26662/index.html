<p>I've never thought of myself as a project manager, but in three areas of my life I seem to be doing just that. 
<P>
At work, being a Development Manager, I am responsible for several key projects MessageLabs will be releasing throughout the next 12 months. I am trying to make sure the team are happy and supported in all they need, but its sometimes hard to resist diving in and trying to help out as a code merchant. Old habits die hard.
<P>
My life will be over next week. Alledgely ;) I reach a milestone in my life. 40. I'm having a family party, a joint party with Birmingham.pm (on <a href='http://birmingham.pm.org/docs/meet-social.html'>Wednesday 14th</a>, if anyone wants to join us), and a friends party next weekend. It's a shame we don't have a massive house as I've had to keep the numbers down to about 40 people. There are several people I would have liked to invited (including many from London.pm), but hopefully I'll get to see them before the end of the year and party just the same :)
<P>
Lastly there is the planning for this conference thing. We have done so much in the last 2 years, it's quite pleasing to know we are a group of organisers who are quite dedicated to making the best conference we can. We want to do things right and we want to raise the bar. We still have a lot to do, but now we're off and running for real. Let's see if I make 41 ;)</p>

Let me know if you survive. I turn 40 next year.

When I turn 48 (a few years from now), I'll start telling people I'm "30".  That is, 30 hex.



<h2>&quot;joint party&quot;?</h2>

Is that what I think it is? And with me in Canada!

If you're thinking lots of beer to celebrate mine, Steve's and Birmingham.pm's birthdays, then you'd be right. What else could you mean<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;^)
