<p>Well I have been very quite here for sometime. Hadn't quite meant to let things slip, but I've been so busy doing other things.
<P>
Best news for me this week has to be finally getting a job. MessageLabs got back to me yesterday and made a firm offer, which I've accepted. I'm now due to start next Tuesday. This had been a great weight off my mind, as I was beginning to wonder whether I actually get anything Perl related. I even had a Java interview a couple of weeks ago.
<P>
My plans to rewrite the Intranet system I was working on at QIIS have slowed. Partly due to me contracting with the company that has come out of the ashes of QIIS, <a href="www.i2q.co.uk">I2Q</a>, but also there is a legal issue with me creating something that I previously created at QIIS. I still have plans to finish it, and possibly sell it, but I think that that will be a long time down the line now. This time around I want to design it properly, with full Technical Specs and everything, and code it with the benefit of hindsight. I2Q have already stated interest if I finish it, which would be good as they can do the selling and leave me to tinker in my spare time. 
<P>
DanDan and Nicole have taken up some of my time too, which has been fun. Though I think DanDan is going to get withdrawal symptoms once I start work again. Still at least I'll be home earlier than when I was working in Brum. Gloucester is only about 35-45 minutes drive, whereas catching a bus back from Brum could take anything up to 2 hours.
<P>
I should mention that our Technical Meeting for Birmingham.pm, went down very well last month, with thanks to <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/davorg/">Dave</a> and <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/2shortplanks/">Mark</a> for coming up to Birmingham to give us 4 talks between them. Some felt that the talks were a bit too heavily weighted towards the experienced programmer, so from now on I'm going to try and keep a balance. At the next Technical Meeting (proposed 30th April) I am planning a beginners guide to Regular Expressions tutorial, and possibly a further look at screen-scraping via my Perl Auctioneer talk. Time permitting of course.</p>
