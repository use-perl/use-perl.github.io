<p>MessageLabs are recruiting. We are looking for a few jobs, although for my team there are two in particular. The first I posted to <a href='http://jobs.perl.org'>jobs.perl.org</a> yesterday (although its awaiting re-approval due a minor change), while the second is currently having the job spec defined.
<P>
The first job is for a <a href='http://jobs.perl.org/job/1777'>Perl/Linux Programmer</a>. We're looking for someone who has good experience with Perl and Linux, but preferably knows C/C++ well too. Most of the work will be network programming, so understanding protocols would be a good thing. I've been surprised at how many have applied promoting their web programming skills, which while admirable, is not the focus of the job. I've also had CVs from China and the US, even though the advert explicitly says we are in the United Kingdom and that the job does require you to be onsite!
<P>
The second job is a little more interesting. We are looking for someone who has good understanding and experience of security models and applications. I hope to have the CV on jobs.perl.org next week, so I'll expand on it further then. 
<P></p>

Well I haven't counted them out yet. I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt, as someone from Budapest has also applied who seems quite eager to return to the UK, so they may be in the same situation.
<p>
I was more surprised that I actually got interest from further afield than Europe to be honest. In a good way.</p>
