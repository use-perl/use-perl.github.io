<div class="span8">
<p><p>With <a href="http://vienna.pm.org/">Vienna.pm</a> making their <a href="http://vienna.yapceurope.org/ye2007/cfp.html">first announcement</a> of the year, for the YAPC::Europe::2007 conference, it's rather fitting that Steve & I, together with our other halves, have finally booked flights to visit the guys next month. As fortune would have it, we're there for Vienna.pm's monthly meeting, so I think that MUST count as the first date on our World Tour ;)
<p>We have a good reason for visiting the Vienna.pm guys and you'll get to hear more about that soon.
<p>In the meantime I'm really looking forward to visiting the city as my ex-flatmate is from Linz, but lived in Vienna for many years, and keeps wanting Nicole and I to go and visit the place. Now I get to do it twice :) While we're there we'll try and get an idea of some of the places to see and find out more about the recommended hotels and the venue for the conference.
<p>Looking at the photos of the city, we should have a fun time.</p>
