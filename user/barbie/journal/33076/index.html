Event:   Technical Meeting
Date:    Wednesday 25th April 2007
Times:   from 7pm onwards (see below)
Venue:   O'Neills, 90 Hurst Street, The Arcadian Centre, Birmingham
Details: <a href="http://birmingham.pm.org/cgi-bin/brum.pl?act=tech-next">http://birmingham.pm.org/cgi-bin/brum.pl?act=tech-next</a>
</pre>

<p>
<b>Introduction:</b>
<p>
As always entry is free, with no knowledge of Perl required. We'd be delighted to have you along, so feel free to invite family, friends and colleagues ;)

<p>
<b>Talks:</b>

<ul>
<li>Testing With Perl [ Barbie ]
<li>Yahoo UI demo [ Colin Newell ]
</ul>

<p>
The main talk this week will feature an in depth look at the Perl testing mechanism, and a selection of popular test modules available on CPAN. For the second talk, Colin will be giving a demo of using the Yahoo UI tools.

<p>
<b>Venue:</b>

<p>
Technical meetings are held at O'Neills on Hurst Street, by The Arcadian Centre. We will be in the main function room ("the band room" if you've ever been there at the weekend). These days they accommodate us at the back of the function room (bear right as you walk through the double doors into the band room). If you arrive early on, then you may find us scattered about partaking of the pub grub (see menu below).

<p>
The venue is approximately 5-10 minutes walk from New Street station, and only slightly longer from the city centre. On street car parking is available on Hurst Street and Bromsgrove Street, free after 6pm, although as spaces are in short supply you may prefer to park in the NCP Arcadian multi-storey car park, entrance off Bromsgrove Street.

<p>
<b>Food:</b>

<p>
Food is available until 8pm. I'll not be organising pre-orders for food this month, but a menu is available (click the link below), if you would like to decide before you get here. Please note that the menu below is a little out of date as they've changed a few items around, although pretty much everything on the list they still do. We normally start arriving from 6pm onwards, with most people arriving about 7pm.
