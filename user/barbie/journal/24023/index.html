<p>Last weekend and at last weeks technical meeting, The Birmingham Bid organisers continued their efforts to film a movie. Steve was principal cameraman and director, with the rest of us coming up with good ideas along the way. Although we do have a script, it does allow for sudden burst of inspiration.
<P>
Last Saturday, Steve, JJ, Brian, myself and DanDan all went on an adventure. We started at a very nice cafe in Selly Oak (Brum Uni student district), then took a train ride (via New Street and the mono-rail) to the airport. Then back to town and over to the conference venue. Finally we headed along the canal to The Flapper And Firkin. Thankfully it was a nice day, but was still quite a trek. The pint at the Flapper was very satisfying.
<P>
Last Wednesday, at the end of the technical meeting, we took some time to film some comic capers. We had a new recruit and a guest from London, in the guise of Richard Clamp, so they have also unwittingly become movie stars.
<P>
There are still a few scenes remaining, and we have a planning meeting in a few weeks to discuss what is left to do. I have now also just about completed the stills for a section of the movie, and we are still on course for submitting the completed movie with our conference bid.
<P>
The proposal document is just about finished too. We have been knocking it into shape for the past month or so, so we hope we've both got everything we need to include and all the bits others never thought to include ... we're hoping the latter makes us look *real* good ;)
<P>
We've questioned, as others have done, whether we know what we're letting ourselves in for, but I think we can handle it. If we can't, I'll let DanDan and Ethne entertain everyone :)</p>
