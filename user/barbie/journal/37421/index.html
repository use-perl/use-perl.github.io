Yesterday I announced the launch of the notification system (with very mixed reactions), part of a whole swathe of improvements planned for CPAN Testers. The next phase for the notification system is to implement a preferences website, on which authors can fine tune the alerting they wish to receive, even down to particular os, perl version, distribution and distribution version. So for example if an author wants to receive mails for their distributions, except their Acme:: ones, or only for those reports run on VMS, then they can. I'm not going to commit to when the preferences site will be live, as there is much work behind the scenes still yet to do, but all being well I plan to have something live in the coming months. 
<p>
Since taking on the code base for <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/CPAN-WWW-Testers-Generator">CPAN-WWW-Testers-Generator</a> and <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/CPAN-WWW-Testers">CPAN-WWW-Testers</a>, I have been hard at work implementing many improvements for these, as well as packaging <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/CPAN-Testers-WWW-Statistics">CPAN-Testers-WWW-Statistics</a>. You may not have noticed the improvements in the database generation tools and process, but you may have noticed some of the clean ups on the Statistics site. One of these clean-ups has been to finally add an <a href="http://stats.cpantesters.org/rss-2.0.xml">RSS feed</a> and formalise <a href="http://stats.cpantesters.org/updates.html">the blog</a>. 
<p>
Another update has been to move the non-CPAN code and data to a new <a href="http://devel.cpantesters.org/">CPAN Testers Development</a> site. My primary intention with this is to provide links to the data that is used or generated behind the scenes, that isn't appropriate for CPAN. However, a further intention is to provide a suitable one-hit place to find all the development links you will need if you wish to get involved in working with the CPAN Testers code base. At the moment only links to the CPAN versions are included, but eventually git/svn/cvs/whatever repositories will also be listed. This will hopefully encourage patches and the like for adding more functionality to the websites and bring us closer to CPAN Testers 2.0.
<p>
However, there is still one part of the puzzle to be unveiled, and that is the new CPAN Testers Reports website. On Monday I gave a quick preview to <a href="http://miltonkeynes.pm.org">MiltonKeynes.pm</a>, which gained some positive comments, and will hopefully meet with approval with everyone else (though I doubt it after the flak I've been getting over the past week) once it receives its finishing touches. The site currently builds to over 3.7GB as a static site, so the move to a dynamic site will reduce that somewhat. Lots of fixes for the static site have been implemented, and many more are still planned. Expect its public launch soon.
<p>
There is lots more planned for CPAN Testers 2.0, but much of that will be behind the scenes in the way that reports get sent to the central server. If you want to get involved and help improve CPAN Testers, please consider joining the <a href="http://wiki.cpantesters.org/wiki/MailingLists">cpan-testers-discuss mailing list</a>. David Golden has started a <a href="http://wiki.cpantesters.org/wiki/Roadmap">Roadmap</a> page on the <a href="http://wiki.cpantesters.org/">wiki</a>, so please put forward your suggestions and ideas.
