<p><p>Being a Board Games fan myself for several years, and that I'm discovering more and more friends are interested too, as well as many Perl geeks like Board Games, plus the fact that Austria, like Germany, are a nation that love Board Games, it seemed a reasonable thought to suggest a <a href="http://vienna.yapceurope.org/ye2007/wiki?node=BoardGamesBOF">Board Games BOF</a> in Vienna for <a href="http://vienna.yapceurope.org/">YAPC::Europe</a>. It seems I was right, as several have suggested games to play or that they plan to bring. Traditionally the BOFs are a one off event, but I think there might be the chance to play every night if we're lucky. I think next year I might even suggest a Board Games Hackathon ;)

I'm also a bit of a game geek.  One of the best games I've come across I found in Dutch called 'Koehandel' or something like it (basically, cow market).<br><br>It involves economic decisions and a bit of gamesmanship which makes it a very interesting strategy game.<br><br>According to <a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/1117" title="boardgamegeek.com">boardgamegeek</a boardgamegeek.com> it's called "You're bluffing" in English, which seems like a bit of a crap name, but there you go...<br><br>

That might be another one to teach my son. He can already play Hunters &amp; Gathers, Bohnanza, Mississippi Queen and Freight Train. I'm just waiting until he's old enough to play the likes of Verr&#228;ter and Rail Baron<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

C'mon, quit playing those wimpy Eurogames and play a real wargame! Dice! Hexagons! Gobs of charts and tables! 12+ hour playing times!
<p><nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-P</p>

<p>You mean like <a href="http://devel.diplom.org/manorcon/" title="diplom.org">ManorCon</a diplom.org><nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
</p><p>I missed last year and this, but DanDan might be old enough to come along with me next year<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) Although apart from Risk, I've never been into the big long wargames. I get bored as it takes ages for anything to happen.</p>

I wouldn't call Risk a wargame - it's a dicefest.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
<p>
I think a better introduction to (light) wargames for Eurogamers would be something like <a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/3307" title="boardgamegeek.com">Wallenstein</a boardgamegeek.com> or <a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/9625" title="boardgamegeek.com">Struggle of Empires</a boardgamegeek.com>. These games have conflict, but no charts and such, and it is represented abstractly. There is also much less combat overall than Risk, i.e. it's part of the game, but it's not all combat all the time.</p>

<h2>Go</h2>

The only game I really like to play is Go.<br><br>Are there going to be other Go players at the YAPC in Vienna?<br><br>Marcel<br>

I've got a Go board, but I've never taken the time to learn how to play it. It was very popular when I was in school, but at the time I was more interested in playing chess. These days the "German Style" of board games seem much more fun<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

<h2>I love board games</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jfluhmann/">jfluhmann</a> on 2007-08-14T14:31:42</h3>
<p>Nice!  I love board games, too.  I really like Mind Trap, but they quit making it.  I need to see if I can buy it online from somewhere like Amazon.  Maybe I'll have it before next year's YAPC::NA.</p>
