<p><p>After the launch last week of the new <a href="http://www.cpantesters.org">Reports site</a> for CPAN Testers, I received several requests for amendments. Many of these have now been implemented, along with several updates already planned.
<p>See <a href="http://search.cpan.org/src/BARBIE/CPAN-WWW-Testers-0.35/CHANGES">CHANGES</a> for details, but essentially for the regular user, I've now implemented the cookie and URL reading functionality, which will hopefully improve some of site for some. As such you can now select preferences which will render the page as your personal defaults, and you can now select the dynamically created permanent link, which you can send to friends or bookmark.
<p>Unfortunately the functionality isn't as good as I'd like it to be, as it still needs to load the page before it can filter. I had a chat with JJ the other night and he suggested an alternative method, which could work. However, if anyone has suitable javascript skills and can suggest other filtering solutions, please let me know.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the  trigger only fires AFTER the entire page has loaded...</p><p>So now, on my page the humungous list of PASSes spool out for 4 or 5 minutes, and THEN once it's all up my browser hangs for 30+ seconds applying the CSS rules (asking me 3 or 4 times if I want to cancel the "hanging" Javascript).</p><p>You need to fire the CSS rules early while the DOM is smaller, so that the page immediate starts spooling out with the correct rules.</p><p>Run the cookie logic immediately in the  or at the very top of the  content.</p>

<p>Patches welcome<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)
</p><p>I did try to get the javascript to preset the CSS styles, before any of the content loads, but it doesn't work for some reason. I did try several different approaches, but the browser just ignores the dynamic style settings. I'm potentially looking at loading everything via javascript and rendering the page without the CSS flags, but I wonder whether that would suffer the same problem with the time consuming javascript logic.
</p><p>The most suitable method I see of solving it is with AJAX, and I'm nowhere near ready for the dynamic site.
</p><p>As mentioned in the post, if anyone has pointers for how to do this better on the client-side, I would be delighted to hear of them<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>
