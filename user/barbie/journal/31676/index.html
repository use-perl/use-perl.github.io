<p><p>Tonight I'll be the guest speaker at <a href="http://www.covlug.org.uk/">Coventry Linux Users Group</a>. They've asked me to do an introduction to Perl and CPAN. I've dusted off and considerably updated the talk I gave to South Birmingham LUG a couple of years ago. It's been interesting to reread the talk as several things have changed in the last two years.
<p>Originally I was going to do this talk for the folks in Coventry earlier in the year, when I was going to promote the YAPC::Europe conference a bit. Unfortunately they had to reschedule, so I've missed that opportunity, but I am still hoping I might be able to recruit one or two into <a href="http://birmingham.pm.org">Birmingham.pm</a>. Afterall we're only a few miles down the A45 :)</p>

<p>And while we're at it, I never thanked you for having me down for the lexing talk.  That was a lot of fun.  I'm just sorry I had to run off so soon afterward.</p>

<p>Thanks for taking the time to come and talk to us. I had a good night, and I know several others have commented that they really enjoyed the talks too.</p>
