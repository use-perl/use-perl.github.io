<p>It looks as though one of the following has occurred:<br/><br/><ul>
<li>The spammer attacking AOL has stopped
<li>AOL has gone bust
<li>The AOL mail servers are down
<li>someone has finally looked at the abuse@aol.com mailbox and decided to stop sending me mail bombs
</ul>
<P>
I suspect the last one. The first would be nice, and the other two would be just desserts. After 3 and a half days, with around 4,000 mails returned to them, they have either decided to configure their mail/spam software correctly or blocked outgoing messages to my domain, as all mail from AOL has just stopped dead.
<P>
Back down to my regular levels of inconvenience now.</p>

I've been getting of the order of a thousand attempts to deliver spam to my server every day from AOL hosts, almost all sent to non-existent addresses.  In the eight hour period that I checked in detail, they didn't try to deliver a single real email.  So I've added *.aol.com to my host_reject line.  Real people don't use AOL anyway, so it's not as if it'll inconvenience anyone who matters.

The only person I know who uses AOL, and I do receive legit email from, is <a href="http://www.henryrollins.com/" title="henryrollins.com">Henry Rollins</a henryrollins.com>. Unfortunately I'm not downloading messages onto my own server yet (still need to fix my Linux server), so I'm stuck with my POP account filling up.
<p>
It seems they haven't fixed the software, as I'm now receiving another batch of bounces, although at a considerably reduced rate.</p>
