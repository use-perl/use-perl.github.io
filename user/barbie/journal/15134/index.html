<p>Last night Mel was staggered to hear us talking Perl. Consider wrists slapped. We won't do it again, not until the next meeting anyway :)
<P>
JJ lamented that he had a bit of catching up to do with my list of Perl modules. Most of my modules are not ready for CPAN and some probably will disappear without a trace. I'm just hoping others are motivated enough to submit theirs.
<P>
Managed to persuade Jon and Chris to do talks at the January technical meeting (date TBA). Well more like they inadvertantly volunteered themselves. I wrote it in my notebook just to be sure :) I hoped that the technical meetings would be a success when we started them, but was doubtful. I'm pleased to say that although we don't have stunning numbers turning up at each one, roughly 10 out 42 members on the mailing list is not a bad ratio. Now that we have some regular meetings I shall be attempting to advertise our existence to the local LUGs and Unis again.
<P>
Steve sent his apologies for non-attendance via SMS. He was still in Estonia. The lure of women, cheap beer and a damned good time just couldn't be resisted :)
<P>
The free beer (Guinness in our case) with every meal, went down rather well. Just Jon and myself were partaking, while everyone else happily piled the glasses in our direction.
<P>
Thankfully I didn't fall asleep on the bus this week and managed to get home before midnight.
<P>
Our reccy for a new social pub and The Birmingham Job movie takes place on Saturday 18th October. We'll be meeting up for breakfast at 11am, at the cafe opposite Henry's Bar at the top of Hill Street (near the <a href='http://www.bbc.co.uk/birmingham/your_birmingham/birmingham_in_pictures/images/gallery_art_in_the_city/iron_man.jpg'>Iron Man</a> and <a href='http://www.virtualbrum.co.uk/images/victoria/floozy.jpg'>"The Floozie in the Jacuzzi"</a> if you know Brum). Following that, the pub crawl ... er ... I mean recon mission will commence. Pub list still to be decided, but I'm sure we'll have fun. Anyone who happens to be in  Birmingham city centre that Saturday (perhaps your other half wants to visit the new <a href='http://www.bullring.co.uk/website/'>Bull<a> <a href='http://www.bbc.co.uk/birmingham/webcams/bullring/bullring.shtml'>Ring</a>) and wants to join us (even just for one), email me for my mobile number
