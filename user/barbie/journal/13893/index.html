<p>Saturday we awoke to much rain. I had thought it would be nice to go sightseeing, I did want to see <A HREF="http://www.whatsontheplanet.com/wow/ptnr/hotels/paris/page.jsp?fx=event&event_id=78093">Paris Plage</A>, the beach that had been created on the banks of the Seine, and <A HREF="http://northstargallery.com/pages/PereHist.htm">PÃÂ¨re-Lachaise</A>. But being outdoor sights, it didn't seem like a good idea. So shopping seemed like a good idea. <A HREF="http://goeurope.about.com/library/phot/bl_paris_halles_1.htm">Les Halles</A> was the place. Being a Saturday and raining everyone else seemed to have the same idea too. It was packed. Not that many places of interest, but it did wile away an afternoon. Found a neat Tea Shop, where I bought some Passion Fruit flavoured tea. Then a chocolate shop for presents for DanDan and Nicole. I had hoped to find a toy shop so I could get a model of a french car for DanDan (he's mad on tractors and "Jeepy cars" (aka /(Range|Land) Rovers/) at the moment), but the only one I found was a shop for trainset accessories, and the cars and lorries seemed pretty expensive for a toy.
<P>
Met up with JJ in the evening and had Mexican for dinner. Headed for a quiet drink in La Taverne and were quickly joined by Arnaud and Tom. <A HREF="http://yapc.mongueurs.net/yapc/info/?id=kudra">Kudra</A>, <A HREF="http://yapc.mongueurs.net/yapc/info/?id=nicholas">Nick</A> and <A HREF="http://yapc.mongueurs.net/yapc/info/?id=hfb">Elaine</A> spotted us and finally persuaded us to join them outside. Several p5p guys were there and a few London.pm'ers, including <A HREF="http://yapc.mongueurs.net/yapc/info/?id=richardc">Richard</A><A HREF="http://use.perl.org/user/richardc/">C</A>, who had stayed in Paris. More beer, good conversation and a mostly rain free table. Lovely.
