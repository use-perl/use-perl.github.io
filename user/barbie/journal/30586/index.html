<p><p> The YAPC::Europe::2006 Backstage Pass<br /> Bulletin 11.1<br /> - A 'Behind The Scenes' missive from the organisers

<p><b>"Friends of Mine" (Registration)</b>
<p>Three weeks to go and the confirmed attendees are increasing. We have seen a number of people claim to be doing bank transfers, which have yet to materialise. Please note that unless we have confirmed your attendance via email and on the website, then you will NOT be registered. If you are planning to pay via a bank transfer, the money will need to clear into our account by Friday 25th August in order to guarantee your place. We will publicise via the usual routes whether cash (Pounds Sterling only) on the door will be accepted after Saturday 26th August. However, we do urge you to prebook as soon as possible.


<p><b>"Hungry Like The Wolf" (Conference Meal)</b>
<p>The Conference Meal is now booked. We are planning to have a Balti Night as the conference meal for all you lovely people. This has been a logistical worry for us, as how on earth do you fit over 200 people in a restuarant built for less than 100? Well thanks to JJ, we've managed to find a TARDIS! The meal venue will be Second City Suite, who have a purpose built hall for large weddings and events. They specialise in Indian weddings, and as such are more than able to accommodate everyone and provide a very enjoyable evening. 

<p>As part of this booking, we need to know exactly who will be joining us. So if you are planning on bring partners or the family, you will need to let us know as soon as possible. At the current time there will be no extra charge for partners and family, however we may need to make small charge for guests if numbers increase dramtically over the next few weeks.


<p><b>"Last Chance on the Stairway" (Deadline For Papers)</b>
<p>Any speakers reading this, please note that Papers, Slides, Demos, etc, are due by the end of this week, Friday 11th August. Anything later than this will miss the final deadline, as we need to burn all the Conference CDs. 


<p><b>"New Moon On Monday" (Swag For The Bag)</b>
<p>Many sponsors have come forward and offered swag and various items to help us with conference merchandise. Please note that if your company would like to donate anything, please get in touch as soon as possible. All swag needs to be delivered by the end of next week, Friday 18th August.


<p><b>The Wild Boys" (Sponsors)</b>
<p>Up until a couple of weeks ago, it was looking like us organisers would be digging deep into our personal pockets to help pay for the conference. Thankfully, two late sponsors have come forward to save our wallets. However, we are still looking for anyone to help us get over the final hurdles. If your company can help, even by a small amount, we'd be delighted to hear from them.


<p><b>"Is There Something I Should Know?" (Any Questions)</b>
<p>If there are any issues or questions, please direct them to the <a href="mailto:organisers@birmingham2006.com">organisers</a>.

<h2>POD ok?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Beatnik/">Beatnik</a> on 2006-08-10T23:09:56</h3>
I've finished my paper but it's in POD.. Is that a problem?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) BTW What's the cleanest way to get the books at the venue? I'm not sure how much space I'll have left in my luggage if I take them.

<p>Yep POD is okay.
</p><p>As for books, if you can send them to our company address by Friday 25th August, I can bring them along to the conference. Could you email me the list of books you have for auction. Thanks.</p>
