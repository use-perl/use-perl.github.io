<p>While in Belfast Geoffrey Avery saw fit to bring a card game with him. <a href='http://www.wunderland.com/LooneyLabs/Fluxx/Fluxx.html'>Fluxx</a>. Apparently it was VERY popular at YAPC::North::America this year. And so it was in Belfast too. Every night there was a game featuring various nationalities, though most of Birmingham.pm and Paris.pm seemed to be involved at any one point. As a consequence I will be ordering some packs for several of Birmingham.pm.
<P>
<a href='http://use.perl.org/user/nobull/journal'>Brian</a> was so taken with it, he now plans to write an online version of it. I'm looking forward to that :)</p>

<h2>Homebrewed version</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/2shortplanks/">2shortplanks</a> on 2004-09-22T13:07:33</h3>
Fluxx is rather good fun.
<p>
I'd warn brian off writing an online version though.  The game's still copyrighted.
</p><p>
Remember I said I'd do a london.pm version?  So far I've got as far as producing a Graphviz map of how all the cards link together so that any version that we produce has the same weighting as the real version.  Of course, this has just proved to show how terrible GraphViz's layout algorithm is.  Anyone got any other suggestions for graphing software (no, I asked acme and he had no useful suggestions)
</p><p>
The other draw back is that <a href="http://www.wunderland.com/LooneyLabs/Fluxx/blanks.html" title="wunderland.com">Blankxx</a wunderland.com> don't come in very flexible packs so I'm either going to have to buy a shedload of blanxx packs to replace all the normal cards or find some way to print the whole lot.  Again, suggestions welcome.</p>

Google should lead you to sources for <a href="http://plaincards.com/Pages/Products.htm" title="plaincards.com">blank cards</a plaincards.com> that you can run through your printer or copier or pen/pencil.<br> <br>-matt

<h2>GraphViz revisited?</h2>

Have you tried all of the layout programs? dot and whatever-that-other-is-called.
