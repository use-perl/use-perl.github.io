<p>Fiddled around with some code last night. I started implementing some of the ideas from RichardC and JJ for Calendar::List, which is getting nearer an official CPAN release, and was relieved to see that only 3 tests failed. Now I just have to fixed that bit of code and add a few more data formats (and tests for them) and I should have another beta release.
<P>
Made some more headway with the WWW::UsePerl::Journal patch and additional Comment module. However, discovered that the comments are based on the thread they are in. This is fine if you want to find all the comments in a particular thread, but I also wanted to have a most_recent_comments() function, which could list the last 30 (or supplied number) comments added, much like the NewestNodes bit in PerlMonks. Unfortunately it doesn't work so well :(
<P>
For anyone who is interested the link to a subcomment is:
<pre>
http://use.perl.org/comments.pl?sid=13809&op=&threshold=0&commentsort=0&mode=thread&tid=34&pid=21409#21414
</pre>
<P>
Which contains alot of info to reference the thread (<code>sid</code>), the parent comment (<code>#21414</code>), etc. However all I want is the comment itself, in this case <code>21409</code>. There must be a method of doing it, but haven't had to time to look through the slash code yet. I think that'll be my task for next week now. </p>
