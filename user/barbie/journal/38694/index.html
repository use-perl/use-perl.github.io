<p><p>Dear All,</p>

<p>Welcome to the last update before the 2009 QA Hackathon.</p>

<p><b>SPONSORSHIP &amp; FUNDING</b></p>

<p>Before starting out on the update, we wanted to make sure you all knew who to thank for helping to put on the QA Hackathon. With final costs coming in last week, our budget slightly went over the edge. However, thankfully we have some wonderful sponsors and we're back on course for a very successful weekend of hacking.</p>

<p>So a big thank you to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Birmingham Perl Mongers</li>
<li>Dijkmat</li>
<li>Digital Craftsmen</li>
<li>$foo Magazin</li>
<li>Nestoria</li>
</ul>

<p>As well as a thank you to the following companies for funding their employees to attend:</p>

<ul>
<li>PROCURA B.V.</li>
<li>Booking.com</li>
</ul>

<p><b>TRAVEL</b></p>

<p>Please make sure that you are familiar with the Directions Guide [1], and where the hotel is located (Jury's Inn, Broad Street), so you can at least find your way initially.</p>

<p><b>FRIDAY EVENING</b></p>

<p>On Friday, I plan to be at the hotel for about 1pm, and will aim to be around in the lobby after checking in. Once those arriving by air around lunchtime have had a chance to check-in and freshen up, we'll head over to the The Wellington. We'll be passing a couple of places to eat if anyone fancies a late lunch. Unfortunately The Wellington doesn't serve food, however you are allowed to bring your own :) It is also worth noting that The Wellington is A Real Ale Pub, and usually has 10-15 guest and local ales on tap.</p>

<p>We have tables booked at The Thai Orchid for 7pm, for 18 people. The Wellington and The Thai Orchid are virtually opposite each other on Bennetts Hill, off New Street. If you get there slightly earlier than the rest of us, ask for the table for 'Birmingham Perl Mongers'.</p>

<p>After the meal, we'll be walking slightly down the hill, to The Hill, where some of the later arrivals will hopefully catch up with the rest of us.</p>

<p>See also Friday Evening Events page [2]. Note that directions have been added to this page, to both pubs and the restaurant, from The Jury's Inn.</p>

<p><b>SATURDAY</b></p>

<p>The QA Hackathon will kick-off at 9am at The City Inn. We'll have some initial outlines for everyone for what they hope to work on during the weekend, then splinter off into working groups as appropriate.</p>

<p>During the day, there will be refreshments provided during the morning and afternoon, with a buffet served for lunch. </p>

<p>The room is booked until 5.30pm, at which time we will break, with everyone heading back to their hotels to freshen up. We will meetup at 6.30pm in the Jury's Inn lobby, before heading over to Brindleyplace and the Handmade Burger Co. for food. After the meal, we will be heading over the canal to the Flapper & Firkin. Advice: DO NOT fall into the canal ... it isn't nice!</p>

<p>Note that Digital Craftsmen have also put some money into the kitty to buy the first round. The Flapper & Firkin is hosting an unsigned band festival this weekend, so we may head to The Malthouse if it proves too busy.</p>

<p>See also Saturday Evening Events page [3].</p>

<p><b>SUNDAY</b></p>

<p>The day will begin at 9am at The City Inn, finishing at 5.30pm. Refreshments and buffet provided as per Saturday.</p>

<p>After the day's hacking, we will again meet in the Jury's Inn lobby for 6.30pm before heading up Broad Street to Shimla Pinks. After the meal we will be heading back to Brindleyplace to All Bar One.</p>

<p>See also Sunday Evening Events page [4].</p>

<p><b>MONDAY</b></p>

<p>For the final day we will begin at 9am at The City Inn, finishing at 5.30pm, with refreshments and buffet provided as per Saturday. We'll aim to have a wrap-up session during the afternoon, so everyone can present a round up of what they have achieved over the weekend.</p>

<p>For those not heading home immediately after the hackathon, the rest of us will meet in the Jury's Inn lobby for 6.30pm, then head over to The Mailbox and Bar Room Bar. After the meal we can either stay in Bar Room Bar, or head over to Penny Blacks, which is also in The Mailbox. </p>

<p>See also Monday Evening Events page [5].</p>

<p><b>THANKS</b></p>

<p>JJ and myself would like to thank everyone who is taking part in the hackathon this weekend, as well as all our sponsors. Without you all, this would not be happening.</p>

<p>We look forward to seeing you all, and hope you all have pleasant and safe journeys getting here.</p>

<p>See you soon...</p>

<p>Thanks,<br />
The 2009 QA Hackathon Organisers.</p>
