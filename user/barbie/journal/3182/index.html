<p>As of Monday I'm down to a 3 day week. I could look on the bright side, and realise that it could mean that I can post to use Perl and those Perl/CGI forums more :) Or perhaps finish my inaugral module ready for CPAN and get a few people to look at it and see what I've missed. However, it'll more than likely mean that I have to do more babysitting, while Nicole does her thing!
<P>
She is a very good artist and sculptress, so it could be just the right time for her to finish off those fairy wands and sell them over the net. Hopefully next week we'll finally get <A HREF="http://www.madeinlove.co.uk/">Made In Love</A> up and running with a front page and everything.
<P>
We had a look at some fairy sites and wand sites, and were amazed at how much they were selling for and how minimalist they were. Perhaps we've found that niche market. Well we can but hope :)</p>
