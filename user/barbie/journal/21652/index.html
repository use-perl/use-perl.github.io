<p>My talk about cpan-testing has been accepted by the organisers of the <a href='http://london.pm.org/lpw'>London Perl Workshop</a>. It isn't on the website yet, but I'm looking forward to seeing who comes along. 
<P>
I'm expecting a large number of the regular attendees to Perl conferences to attend the event as a whole, but I wonder how many of those that are new to Perl or have never been to a Perl conference will be attending. I am hoping there will be a significant number. Judging from the feedback of other workshops, the attendees are often a very different crowd from those that attend conferences. However, seeing as it's London, don't expect there to be too much of a difference.
<P>
Now I just need to figure out where I'll be staying (a hotel close by), when I'll be getting there (looks like I'll be getting in to Paddington about 7.40pm) and where the designated pub will be. Assuming there *will be* a designated pub! Seeing as there isn't a wiki for attendees to note where to meet up, or suggestions for a "workshop hotel", it's going to be a bit awkward arrange some kind of co-ordination. Then again it is only one night :)</p>

<h2>Hotel</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/cog/">cog</a> on 2004-11-02T15:12:30</h3>
The workshop may be only one night, but I'll be in the city for three nights<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

<p>Anyway, I asked about places to stay (and other things too) on the london.pm
mailing list, and got some feedback (thanks, guys). At the moment, I'm more
inclined to stay at <a href="http://www.the-generator.co.uk/" title="the-generator.co.uk">The
Generator</a the-generator.co.uk>.

</p><p>Here's what Paul Orrock said about it: "According to a couple of friends of
mine who have stayed there it's clean and  cheap (&#163;30 for your own mini room or
&#163;10 in a dormitory). Oh and it has it's own bar with an all you can eat for
free breakfast policy."

</p><p>Andy Armstrong said he stayed in the one in Berlin and he recommends it<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

</p><p>But I would really like to know where others are staying...<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-|</p>

Looking on <a href="http://www.hotels.com/" title="hotels.com">Hotels.com</a hotels.com>, The Commodore (&#163;75 single, &#163;84 double) and The Kensington Close Hotel (&#163;85 single/double), look worthy places. There are other cheaper hotels, but they are mostly a lot further away or not the kind of hotel you really want to stay in. However, I suspect many attendees will be travelling on Saturday morning. Thankfully for me the company are paying the bill, but others will probably not be as fortunate.
<p>
I'm hoping that the organisers (or somebody) organises a pub where we can drink til late on the Friday night, otherwise I will only have a couple of hours socialising time<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:(</p>
