<p><p>Sometime ago I offered to update a website for a friend of mine, he's actually one of DanDan's guardians. The original site was one he'd done himself, and to be fair he didn't too a bad a job considering he isn't technically minded at all. But there were things that really bugged me about the layout and that the home page was a 10MB download!
<p>This weekend we launched the new version of <a href="http://www.thescooterdo.com">The Scooter Do</a>. The feedback so far as been fantastic and marks another success for Labyrinth.
<p>I managed to have a good crack at cleaning the Labyrinth code over the Christmas holidays and even added some documentation too. There is still a lot to document and clean, but I was quite please to be able to dump huge chunks of code that I don't use any more. It's going to be interesting to get the testing all sorted as the testing is a bit basic at the moment. I'm hoping to take a better look at <a href="http://www.openqa.org/selenium/">Selenium</a> soon, so I can better write tests that cover the whole site not just the core links.
<p>I did so well over Christmas I might actually get my own personal site updated this year!</p>
