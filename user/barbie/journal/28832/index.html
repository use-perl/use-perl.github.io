<p><P>Thanks to a very kind wiki spammer, the <a href='http://birmingham.openguides.org'>Birmingham OpenGuide</a> was trashed last night. Thankfully I did a backup yesterday afternoon, so was able to restore the site this morning. It was a painful restore though, as not being too familiar with postgresql, I ended up initially spend 2 hours last night until just before 2am trying to get the site back. Time when I should have been in bed fast asleep.
<P>It's made me realise some of the flaws in the OpenGuides framework, all of which have been mentioned on the OG-DEV list, so I'm not the only one. The biggest pain is installation and configuration. The unhelpful response has been use Debian or rent a UML machine. It sets the barrier to entry much higher than it should be.
<P>The most painful for me last night was the configuration for admin tasks. Deleting a page is fine, but what about rolling back a spammed node? It all has to be done manually. What about blocking IPs or preventing anonymous editing of pages? It looks I'm going to have to roll my own. 
<P>JJ suggested it would be nice if the coords where entered, that the map should open up in Google Maps. A great idea and I see there is even a <a href='http://dev.openguides.org/ticket/46'>patch</a> from someone. Unfortunately the pages they are patching in no way ressemble the default installation templates, so now means there is going to be a lot of handcrafting to get it working.
<P>However, the first priority now is to get a patch together to block anonymous editing, and create a fake error page for IPs which are blocked. Then I'll write a rollback patch.
<p><b>UPDATE:</b> 
<P>Edit Protect and Rollback features now implemented on the Birmingham OpenGuides site. The Edit Protect feature enables us to use a config file to block based on IP or username. The Rollback feature now allows us to cleanly remove wiki spammed pages. I'll look at creating a patch for both, together with a few other admin features, that can be rolled into both <a href='http://search.cpan.org/dist/OpenGuides'>OpenGuides</a> and <a href='http://search.cpan.org/dist/CGI-Wiki'>CGI::Wiki</a> distributions.</p>

I think the templates we have are from an earlier version, which would explain why there are significant differences. I'll look at doing some merging next week when i have a little more time.
