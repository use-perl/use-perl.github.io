<h1>No NIN for me this year :(</h1>

<p><p>A while back I bought tickets to see Nine Inch Nails for last Monday at the Birmingham Academy. I told JJ about it, but the gig had sold out. Thankfully they announced another date, tonight in Wolvehampton, so we both got tickets. I was then offered a ticket for last Sunday night (as they had announced 2 Brum dates), but turned it down as I thought seeing them 3 times would be a bit over the top and a little too expensive.
<p>Last Monday's gig <a href="http://www.nin.com/tr/">got cancelled</a> and JJ has just phoned to say tonight's concert has been cancelled too :( The only gig that didn't get cancelled was the Sunday night one that I turned down.
<p>But that's not the worst of it. Both cancelled gigs have been rescheduled. The Brum date is now August 28th and the Wolverhampton date is August 30th ...  both when I'm in Vienna for YAPC::Europe!!!!!!! Ahhhhhhh!!!!!
<p>Just my bloomin' luck. 
<p>However, I can understand Trent cancelling due to throat problems. Having worked with a few bands that have tried to play when their singer has had a bad throat, it really isn't worth it. You don't perform at your best, and risk making things worse and cancelling even more shows. I just wish the gigs could have been rescheduled for a different week :(
<p>Apparently the new album (Year Zero) is part one of a two album concept, with part two coming out next year. Fingers crossed I get to see them play then.</p>

<h2>The Effort Of One Trent Reznor</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/vek/">vek</a> on 2007-03-13T06:21:22</h3>
I'm not a huge NIN fan although I must admit that I've held a passing attraction for ages[0].  A bloke I work with *is* a huge NIN fan and he was telling me of how much effort Trent is putting into the promotion of the new album.  From the USB drives of new NIN tracks "accidentally" left in the bathrooms of concert venues to cryptic messages on the back of concert t-shirts that fans spend hours deciphering.<br><br>For the first time in years I'm *really* looking forward to the next NIN album.<br><br>[0] I was at the London Astoria when Trent toured Pretty Hate Machine and he did his signature smash-instruments-up routine and I snagged the drumsticks from the stage.  Which, depending on your point of view, is either pretty cool, or quite sad<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)  But dammit, was that that an amazing gig.  Hangover?  Yup<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)
