Event:   Technical Meeting
Date:    Wednesday 20th June 2007
Times:   from 7pm onwards (see below)
Venue:   The Victoria, 48 John Bright Street, Birmingham, B1 1BN.

</pre>

<p>
<b>Introduction:</b>
<p>
After the slight confusion last month, Steve suggested we try out The Victoria this month. The pub is on the corner of John Bright Street and Beak Street, between the old entrance to the Alexandra Theatre and the backstage entrance. If in doubt, the main entrance is on the inner road, by the Pagoda roundabout. The pub is on the road immediately behind the main entrance.
<p>
As always entry is free, with no knowledge of Perl required. We'd be delighted to have you along, so feel free to invite family, friends and colleagues ;)

<p>
<b>Talks:</b>

<ul>
<li>Extended File Attributes [ Richard Dawe ]
<li>Lightweight Ajax with OpenThought [ JJ ]
<li>Preparing For CPAN [ Barbie ]
<li>An Introduction To Template Toolkit [ Barbie ]
</ul>

<p>
Richard Dawe will along to give an update on his File::Attrs distribution on CPAN, JJ will be presenting his demo enlightening Ajax talk, and I'll be presenting two talks. The first will a (slightly) abridged version of the talk that I will be giving in Houston for YAPC::NA next week, followed by a brief introduction to the phenomenon that is Template Toolkit. Although the TT talk may be postponed if we run out of time.

<p>
The venue is approximately 5-10 minutes walk from New Street station, and about the same from the city centre. On street car parking is available on Beak Street and around the loop of Station Street, Dudley Street and Hinckley Street (and Theatre Approach), free after 6pm, or alternative you may prefer to park in the NCP multistorey car park on Hill Street, or in the Red Cage opposite the MailBox.
<p>
If you're travelling into the city centre from the south along the A38, follow signs for New Street Station. At the Pagoda roundabout, turn right onto Smallbrook Queensway. If you arrive from the north, again follow the A38 and signs to New Street Station, then at the Pagoda roundabout turn left onto Smallbrook Queensway.
<p>
At the first set of traffic lights at the bottom of the hill, turn left, past the Holiday Inn hotel, Beak Street is the first left and the pub is on the right hand side as you turn the corner into John Bright Street. Opposite Beak Street, the second right on Hill Street is Station Street (you can follow the road round the block to come out back on to Hill Street via Hinckley Street), where you might find on street parking. A few yards further up Hill Street on your right is an NCP multistorey carpark, however, you might be better heading further up to the traffic lights on Hill Street, and turning left. As you approach the flyover and the Mailbox, the Red Cage multistorey is on your right hand side.

<p>

<b>Times:</b>

<ul>
<li>food available until 7.30pm

Hope you can make it.
