<p><b>Background</b>
<p>In early 2006 Birmingham Perl Mongers took to the road to promote the 2006 YAPC::Europe Perl Conference, which we hosted at the end of August 2006. We took it upon ourselves to visit several Perl Monger groups around the UK, and proved extremely popular, with several groups asked to come back again, and others asking us to visit them too. In 2007 we visited both Perl Monger and Linux user groups, this time presenting at each groups technical meeting. For 2008 we hope to include several groups we never previous got to as well visiting some old friends.
