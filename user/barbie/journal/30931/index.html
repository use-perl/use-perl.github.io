Just before the auction, DanDan, Steve and I presented some gifts to various people who have helped us make YAPC::Europe::2006 such a great event. During the presentations I was meant to show some pictures of each person. However, I got so carried away with the talking bit that I forgot to switch the screen over on the laptop. So to recitfy that, here are the appropriate links and thank yous.
<p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.grango.org/awards/00-cbso.jpg">The CBSO Centre Staff</a><br />Niki accepted the flowers and champagne on behalf of the CBSO Centre staff. In particular Niki, Alison and Nick helped to keep the whole thing running smoothly in the background and put up with us moving things round and generally getting the way :)
<li><a href="http://www.grango.org/awards/01-geoff.jpg">R. Geoffrey Avery</a><br />Geoff took the pressure of us having to think about Lightning Talks and scheduled a great set of talks for the last afternoon. Geoff also help to supply the auction software, which made it a little easier to see what all the bids were.
<li><a href="http://www.grango.org/awards/02-karen.jpg">Karen Pauley</a><br />Karen wasn't there to accept her award, but we made sure she got it the following morning. Many might not have know how much time Karen has spent flying over from Belfast to attend our planning meetings in the last year. And there were several. Her advice and experience as a previous YAPC organiser was invaluable.
<li><a href="http://www.grango.org/awards/03-allison.jpg">Allison Randal</a><br />Allison has been a big supporter of YAPCs in general and has given us a lot of encouragement over the last year. The fact that dispite being ill during the conference, she made sure she held on to present her talk, was a shining example of her enthusiasm for the Perl community and us ;)
<li><a href="http://www.grango.org/awards/04-andrew.jpg">Andrew Stringer</a><br />Andrew was our sound man. We never thought about PAs and microphones until Andrew mentioned that we probably needed something, and that he had one he would be willing to set up for us.
<li><a href="http://www.grango.org/awards/05-simon.jpg">Simon Cozens</a><br />Simon was a last minute attendee, and pleaded for us to let him in. Thankfully we still needed a Japanese translation for our opening speech. Simon also offered his services in helping to setup the venue and came along on Tuesday, helping to carry boxes and put up signs. As it turned out, he was also the perfect speaker replacement, when Schwern was unable to make the trip over.
<li><a href="http://www.grango.org/awards/06-crew.jpg">The Crew</a><br />
<ul>
<li>David Leadbeater</a>
<li>Andrew Ford</a>
<li>Richard Dawe</a>
</ul>
Our crew were brilliant. Several people actually offered additional help, should we need it, but these guys managed to cope with all the extra bits we didn't have time for. If you saw someone waving a timecard at you while you speaking, it was one of these guys.
<li><a href="http://www.grango.org/awards/07-lynsey.jpg">Lynsey Corbett</a><br />Last, but certainly not least was Lynsey. During the conference Lynsey made sure we were fed and watered and had plenty of sandwiches to choose from when, unlike all the attendees, we couldn't disappear off for lunch in a nice pub or restaurant.
</ul>
<p>
All the recipients were given an engraved balti bowl and an "Itchy Guide to Birmingham". Even if they don't get to eat a curry out of the balti bowls, at least they'll have something to remember us by.
<p>
Thanks to everyone who helped out, spoke and came along to the conference. Without you folks it really wouldn't have happened. And thanks to JJ for letting me use his photos. You can see the full set on his <a href="http://perl.jonallen.info/yapc">website</a>.
