So my first proper session was about <a href="http://typo3.com/">TYPO3</a>, a CMS written in PHP. The 3 guys presenting, gave a good introduction via a live demo of the system, and showed some cool ideas that they've implement. I was interested on a personal level to see what they'd encountered with the development of the admin side, and they certainly tried to cover many aspects. It was a little too busy for me, but they also mentioned that through the use of skins you can simplfy what you see. There is also a lot of configuration you can use to default many settings. There were some nice aspects to page referencing within the document tree that I thought were very nice and may end up adapting for Labyrinth.
<p>
The second session was titled "Automate the creation of web sites, given a data model". It took the idea of metadata and allowed you to link to further data. It's perhaps not a new idea, but the implementation was well executed and <a href="http://projects.washingtonpost.com/congress/">the</a> <a href="http://www.chicagocrime.org/">examples</a>  highlighted what the speaker had done extremely well. He works for The Washington Post, and seems to have intergrated his ideas as a form of journalistic research.
<p>
Next up I went along to "Voluntary groups and money", which I thought might be interesting now that Birmingham Perl Mongers are a non-profit limited company. However, the topic of conversation was much more centred around how you pay individuals for work they've done on projects. There was quite a bit of discussion, but none of it was relevant to how B.pm operates (as a non-profit, we are not allowed to claim a salary).
<p>
The last session of the day was Damin Conway with "Giving Better Presentations". I'd heard about this talk before and was intrigued to see what tips I could learn in helping me to be a better presenter. I'm not a natural presenter and I'm actually extremely self-concious during presentations. A number of the points Damian made were things I've already thought about, but there were some that I'm going to take away and digest and see how I can improve my own performance. I would like to get better as there are several ideas for talks I've like to present. 
<p>
Several people are here for the conference and have arrived early. It's been good to see Aaron, Murray, Jesse, Jouke and others here. I'm now wishing I could have stayed longer, but I'll be heading back home on Tuesday. Nicole thought she was getting me back in September ... little did she know!
<p>
Now for the Beer Track ... or was it Euro Bar Camp?
