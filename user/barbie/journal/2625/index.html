<p><P>I had hoped to write at least one journal a week, but life got the better of me :)
<P>
Well January has turned up trumps for Birmingham Perl Mongers, we've managed to grow our mailing list and now have new people turning up to our social events. If the new year starts this well, we'll be taking over the pub by December.
<P>
A few people have asked for a technical meeting, so we are now in the throes of sorting one out. If all goes to plan we will have one ready for March. I've no idea what I'll talk about, but I feel I ought to say something, seeing as I am the leader and all :)
<P>
Started helping out on a programmers technical forum, and have been surprized to be voted as one of the CGI and Perl forums experts. Scared stuff. I have been a bit too busy to write on it in the last week so have probably dropped down the list now :(
<P>
Very pleased to see The Perl Review up and running. Having seen the demise of The Perl Journal (my subscription bit the dust after I was sent a $50 renewal bill for a token offering 4 times a year), it's nice to see somewhere for a magazine style outlet of articles. I know there are several articles all over the web, but there was something quite special about TPJ and hopefully TPR will carry on the tradition.
<P>
That's all for now folks. Have fun.<br/><br/></p>

If you like I can come and give a talk on something. POE, XML, AxKit, whatever. I'm in Gloucester so it's not too far.
