<div class="span8">
<p><p>Last night at the <a href="http://barbie.missbarbell.co.uk/album/68">WolvesLUG Christmas party</a>, <a href="http://barbie.missbarbell.co.uk/cgi-bin/pages.cgi?act=album-image&iid=6506">Ron Wellsted</a> (BigRon) revealed the answers to his Christmas Quiz that he placed on the list for everyone to have a go at. Unfortunately many of us were busy and didn't have time to think through the answers. As such only 3 people manage to submit answers. James won with full marks, with the LUGRadio presenters Chris and Aq following in his wake. The quiz was very well done and I thought it might interest and amuse people here too. There are no prizes, just the self satisfaction of knowing even more trivia than you did before. If you really want to know the answers drop me a line and I'll post them to you. Big thanks to Ron for putting the quiz together.
<p>
Quoting Ron ... "The questions are all computer related, but some of them are very obscure so will need some research.  All just a bit of fun.  Don't blame me if you end up wasting hours (or days!) visiting some very obscure corners of the internet."
<ol>
<li>What improvement over RFC 1149 was offered by RFC 2549?
<li>Who were the first group to implement RFC 1149?
<li>Who/what does the term "scratch monkey" commemorate?
<li>What were the programs "Robin Hood" and "Friar Tuck" used for?
<li>What happens when the switch is flipped from "more magic" to "magic"?
<li>What was the first computer bug?
<li>How do you measure nuclear warhead yield using Ethernet cable?
<li>What is a terminak?
<li>What is important about the 3rd - 13th September 1752?
<li>Approximately how long is a micro-fortnight?
<li>What was the date of the first USENET posting from kremvax?
<li>What was SAIL?
<li>Who created and unleashed the Great Worm?
<li>Where did TANSTAAFL come from?
<li>What is the Utah Teapot?
<li>What year did the "September that never ended" begin?
<li>What is magic smoke used for?
<li>What book was the origin of the "Endian"?
<li>What is an ICBM address?
<li>What type of computer was John Titor after?
</ol>
<p>PS: Please don't include answers in comments, it spoils the fun for everyone else who finds this years later :)</p>
