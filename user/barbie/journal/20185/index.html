<p>Nicole decided to take her mom out for the day on Saturday, seeing as she hadn't had the chance to spending time with her on their own in the last few weeks. As a consequence DanDan and I spent the day together doing "stuff". We started off going to the park, and DanDan riding his bike and racing round the playground. Took some time to go "up in the clouds" on the swings, before we headed off to get some RadWeld for my car. When we got back he had great fun vacuuming the car, while I fixed the radiator. I finished off the vacuuming, getting inside all the nocks and crannies DanDan couldn't reach, and again I have clean car.
<P>
After lunch I decided it would be nice to go to the Lickey Hills Country Park. As it was a nice day, I suspect it might be busy, but figured DanDan would still enjoy it. He did. He has so much energy he just keeps going, climbing up the towers and ladders that are meant for children at least twice his age, including a rope slide. After a few hours, I persuaded him to come for a walk through the woods. We made a slight wrong turn and ended going the long way round, so he ended up getting quite tired. I carried him part of the way back, and we had great fun pulling faces and singing songs together. Before getting back to the car, we came out on the far side of the hills, and could see the East of Birmingham and beyond. To DanDan its Big Town, and he was desperate to see our house, but ours is on the west side of the hills. Finally we headed back, via the petrol station and a nice iced-lolly. He was completely shattered, but we had a great day. He didn't even ask where Nicole was once.
<P>
Sunday was spent fixing Nicole's dad's computer. Unfortunately BT Yahoo! completely stuff up his internet connection (they've recently changed his broadband & email access), and in his attempt to try and fix it, he managed to disable the CDRW drive. I got him to go through and delete all unwanted emails and data files, before I started zipping everything to floppy disk. We ended up with about 8 disks, which wasn't bad going. Wiped the hard drive and reinstalled the lot. I had planned to only be there for about an hour, 5 hours later we were done. He's been driving Nicole's mom nuts as he hasn't been able to connect to the web, now her sanity can be restored :)</p>
