<p><P>Well not exactly toys, but tons of music memoribilia from the 70s/80s. Mostly magazines, fanzines, posters and fanclub books. I've been clearing out the attic for the past few weeks and have unearthed some very interesting bits of music history. However, seeing as they are in the loft, I'm not likely to get around to reading them again, so thought it probably wise to see if anyone else would be interested in them. Enter eBay. This weekend has ended with me selling around ÃÂ£100 worth of paper. I have still a lot of suff to get through, but I'm more than happy with the response so far.
<P>
There have been a few fanzines which i just threw out, considering them not worth the interest for anyone, but now I wonder whether there might have been someone who wanted them. If I find any more I shall be putting them up for sale first. There are quite a few fanclub letters and the like I've kept over the years, so I'll be intrigued to see how much they go for. It's amazing what sells though. 
I still have over half the loft to get through, so  I wonder what else I'll find.
<P> I have tons (literally) of bootleg cassettes up there too, which I would be reluctant to sell (I traded or recorded vitually all of them), I might try and find some way to give them away to anyone who wants them. Over the years I have accumulated some very dodgy recordings, as well many concerts from the radio. I won't embarrass myself with the names just yet, but I'll probably get around to putting up a list at some point.
<P>
The only downer to selling on eBay, is that it isn't so easy to transfer money from PayPal to your own bank account, so I'm having to force myself to buy lots more CDs and DVDs ;)</p>

<h2>Tapes</h2>

You'd be amazed who wants old tapes these days.  If you don't want to sell them, have you considered giving them to the British Library for their sound archive?  Knowing you, I expect you've got some rare gems mouldering away there which they'd like to preserve.

<p>Nicole suggested getting in touch with the bands themselves, but seeing as many have long since disappeared, tracking them down could be more effort than its worth.
</p><p>Looking round the British Library site I think they could recieve a large anonymous donation of recordings at some point:) Thanks for the suggestion.</p>
