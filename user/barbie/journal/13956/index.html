<p>Today am I mostly being relieved that
<P>
a) I fixed my RH9/Config.pm problem - LANG=en_US not LANG=en_GB.UTF-8<br>
b) I can now install Module::Build, DateTime and PAR<br>
c) I uploaded Calendar-List-0.05 to PAUSE
<P>
That last one has the bonus of seeing me finally have a module on CPAN. It's been too long coming. Thanks big time go to <a href='http://use.perl.org/user/richardc/'>RichardC</a> for testing & suggestions and JJ for more date format ideas and things. Not implemented all the suggestions yet, but they're on their way.
<p>
... as is Calendar-List-0.05 to a CPAN mirror near you. Please be gentle ;)

<h2>Locales</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Dom2/">Dom2</a> on 2003-08-06T20:15:48</h3>
Turn them off now.  They'll do you no good at all and they'll fuck up your ls output (Which eejit decicided to sort case insensitively with locales turned on?).

<p>Oh, and they'll fuck your postgres databases too if you have one.  And probably more stuff I haven't discovered and never will because I TURNED THE FUCKERS OFF.

</p><p>The only sane thing to do on a RedHat box is <tt>sudo rm -f<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/etc/sysconfig/i18n</tt>.  People who want locales can turn 'em on on a per user basis.

</p><p>Keep looking at the quotes at the bottom  of each use.perl page.  There's a good one from Jarkko about locales.

From the experience I've just had that would be a good idea. Since installing RH9, not being able to install DateTime, which relies on Module::Build, has stopped me testing and releasing Calender::List. I had figured when the question came up on install, my language option would be for the system dictionary. Silly me. Deleting might be a good way to go.

Heh, my colleague had <i>enourmous</i> problems building perl modules from CPAN on RH9.  When he turned locales off, everything just worked.

<p>It's a real shame; locales are a nice idea at heart, just badly implemented in practise.
