<p><P>Brum.pm had it's monthly meeting on Wednesday. Richardc came all the way from london to greet us and I managed to forget his book ... D'oh! Several people complained of no money, some were on nights and two were in Amsterdam ... they sent me a message from the Heineken Museum, it was funny :) ... so we were a small contingent this month.
<P>
Richardc told me I should log onto IRC more, so the following day I did. Thankfully I had a quiet day so I could be attentive and post things. Promised myself I'll do it again.
<P>
Played around with ideas for names of my two little modules, which will hopefully break my duck on CPAN. Currently toying with the idea of Devel::Debug and Devel::Timer as they are really aimed at the development side of things. My idea was to have some simple routines that people with little knowledge could pick up and use. Devel::Timer might be renamed as Benchmark::Timer::Simple by the time I've stopped fiddling. Wrote some nice Pods to go along with my modules, must see how I fair with Pod::Coverage now ;)
<P>
Finished coding my son's web photo album using perl, MySQL and Template Toolkit. Currently only running on a Toshiba brick near me, until FreeNetName gets their arse into gear and change the IP tag on the slimpickins domain. At which point f2s will kindly let me do lots of nice things on their server. Having done DanDan's Site I now have to overhaul the Slim Pickins site, hopefully using some of the same code. However, have recently got a review copy of the <I>"Running weblogs with Slash"</I> I might end up using slashcode instead. It won't need all the bells and whistles, but a news and message board sounds interesting.
<P>
Got loads of cheap books from O'Reilly this week, thanks to their nice discount for User groups. Unfortunately they didn't have any more <I>"Learning Perl/Tk"</I> for me :( However, I have just noticed that there is a new <I>"Mastering Perl/Tk"</I> available, so may have to investigate do another review ... well it can't hurt to ask. My sister has also told me that she can get a 50% discount on most books by Sams, Que, Prentice Hall, New Riders, among others, so my book collection could grow to new proportions this year.
<P>
After just over a year of Brum.pm, I finally got enough interest to consider doing a technical meeting. Having posted on the list and on use Perl; I now have Richardc and Matt Sergeant offering to do talks, as well as something about debugging and timing from myself, and hopefully a couple of lightning talks from the other user group members about their ideas and things. Currently looking at the last week in March, as I didn't want to clash with the London.pm talk on 21st March. Anyone reading this wanting to come along, and close enough to Brum (UK), let me know and I'll tell you how to get here.
<P>
Until next time, have fun!</p>
