<p>It has just occurred to me that my problem with Storable on Win32 boxes is a bit of a misnomer. Win32 implementations of Apache only handle one child thread. Therefore why do I need to worry about the Storable module, when I can write a simple caching module that just doesn't clear itself unless the server gets restarted. I'd like to blame it on the alcohol, but I haven't had any since the weekend!
<P>
However, the learning experience has been good as I managed to find some good references and got alot further through my mod_perl/Apache books than I wouldn't have otherwise. I also discovered some extra Apache:: modules that I might to play with too.
<P>
We recently did a load test, which went well. With 15 simultaneous logins (5 cgi requests & 3 html requests per login ... we have frames), it took over 3 minutes running as a normal webserver. Running under mod_perl, the same 15 logins took 27 seconds. The managers were suitably impressed.
<P>
Once I get this caching things sorted, and the authentication out of the core, it'll fly like an eagle ;)
<P>
And I've nearly finished updating DanDan's site with new code and new images. More soon...</p>

"Win32 implementations of Apache only handle one child thread."<br> <br>Is that still true with Apache 2.0? I know that 1.3 serialized all requests, but IIRC that changed with the new version.<br>

It's v1.3.24. I've tried v2.0, but it kept crashing, so gave up. Admittedly that was a few months after v2.0 was released so might be more stable now.
<p>
My problem with Storable is that it requires C compilation and we don't have any C compilers on the win32 boxes. Until ActiveState release a more recent version, I'm a bit stuck.</p>
