<p><P>I was trying to find a suitable set of lyrics for today's post, but nothing seemed right. So now I'm 40. I've been getting paid lots of compliments that I don't look my age, which is always nice. The nicest compliment though was that someone thought I've blossomed in my old age. I do to. My life has taken several twists and turns and I was trying to think of a defining moment when I started to become who I am now. It was in August 1992.
<P>In mid 1992 I was offered the opportunity to go on tour with a rock band. This was the point at which a life dream became a reality. I didn't hesitate and quit my job at GEC. In September 1992 I became a Professional Lighting Engineer. I travelled Europe, worked with a whole variety of bands and acts, and had a lot of fun. I learnt a lot too. 
<P>
It was perhaps the biggest change in my life, and started the road of discovery of who I really am, and what I wanted out of life. It's been a wonderful journey so far, and I feel that I'm coming into my own. I have a lot more confidence in myself than I ever have. There are also so many opportunities opening up for the future, that I think I'm going to discovering even more about myself in the coming years, and what I'm capable of.
<P>
I feel I'm entering the 3rd phase of my life, where I start to really understand where I'm going. It's scary, terrifying and exciting all at the same time. I'm looking forward to it :)
<P>
PS: Thanks to everyone who has already sent birthday wishes. Much appreciated. Pity you couldn't all share in the doughnuts here at MessageLabs ;)
</p>
