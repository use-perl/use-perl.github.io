<p><a href='http://use.perl.org/user/Matts/journal/'>Matt</a> brought back some copies of <a href='http://www.theperlreview.com/'>The Perl Review</a> back from OSCON. I have just finished reading it. All I can say is an excellent job by everyone.
<P>
I do like the inclusion of the Perl Testing Reference Card on the back page, though was a little disappointed to not see <a href='http://search.cpan.org/dist/Test-Pod-Coverage'>Test::Pod::Coverage </a> in there. Michael Rodriguez's 'Extending XML::XPath' made fascinating reading. It was also interesting to see several mentions of refactoring in the magazine. 'The Magick Tile Puzzles' article by Grant Mclean, has given me several ideas both for DanDan and for a T-Shirt design that Birmingham Perl Mongers have been trying to concoct :)</p>

There's not much to Test::Pod::Coverage, until you want to customize it.  Is that something you're doing?

No, it's just a nice module to ensure you've all the POD bits you thought you had. It was something I have previously discussed with Sagar (author of Test::Distribution) about adding to his module, but I have yet to have time to write the patch for him<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:(
<p>
I seem to have a backlog of patches I need to write/finish at some point in time. With all the other things that have taken a higher priority in my life, they've had to take a back seat.</p>
