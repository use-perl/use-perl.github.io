<p><p><b>Birmingham.pm World Tour 2007 - MiltonKeynes.pm - 2nd April 2007</b>

<p>
Tonight (Monday 2nd April 2007) Birmingham Perl Mongers perform another date on their World Tour, as members of Birmingham.pm will be attending the technical meeting of MiltonKeynes.pm. Together with speakers from MK.pm the talk schedule looks as follows:

<ul>
<li>Desperately Seeking a Lightweight Perl web Framework [Peter Edwards]
<li>Testing When You Don't Have Time [Tom Hukins]
<li>- To Be Confirmed - [Barbie]
<li>So Damn Kludgy (Lightning Talk) [Barbie]
</ul>

<p>
Attendance is free, and will be at the Open University (Systems Seminar Room, Venables Building, Walton Hall, Milton Keynes, MK7 6AA - for map links, see the bottom of the page: <a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/contact/">http://www3.open.ac.uk/contact/</a>). Doors open around 7.30pm, with talks set to get underway at about 8pm. 

<p><b>Background</b>
<p>
During the early part of last year Birmingham Perl Mongers took to the road to promote the 2006 YAPC::Europe Perl Conference, which we hosted at the end of August 2006. We took it upon ourselves to visit several Perl Monger groups around the UK. It proved extremely popular and several groups asked to come back again, and some Linux user groups asked if we could visit them too. So this year we decided to do exactly that, although we've decided to give ourselves a bit of a challenge.
<p>
In 2006 it was purely a networking exercise, to get to know other Perl and Linux users around the country. For 2007, however, we are planning a bigger Perl promotion by performing via a speaking tour, with several members of Birmingham Perl Mongers attending Perl & Linux user groups around the UK, offering to present talks at their technical meetings about different aspects of Perl.

<p><b>Tour Dates</b>
<p>Dates so far confirmed:
<blockquote>
Mon 12 Feb - Vienna.pm<br />
Tue 20 Mar - Gloucestershire LUG<br />
Wed 28 Mar - Birmingham.pm<br />
Mon  2 Apr - MiltonKeynes.pm<br />
Thu 19 Apr - Birmingham LUG<br />
Wed 25 Apr - Birmingham.pm<br />
Wed 23 May - Birmingham.pm
</blockquote>
<p>
More dates to be added, with London.pm, Malvern LUG, Coventry LUG and Wolverhampton LUG to be scheduled. If there are any other groups that would like us to visit and present a few talks, please get in touch.
