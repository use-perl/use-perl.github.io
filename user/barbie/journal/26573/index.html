<p><P>For the few people who didn't know this week at YAPC::Europe, Birmingham.pm winning the chance to host next year's conference might have been a surprise. However, I don't believe there was anyone who didn't know!
<P>
So yes we've won the honour of hosting the conference next year. Steve stepped forward and gave a brief introduction to explain how it was all his fault. We then showed the movie. Yes our awesome movie. For those who couldn't be here, we'll put the movie up on a server soon. 
<P>
We will be relaunching the Birmingham OpenGuide site, along with the conference website and the new look Birmingham.pm website in the next week or so, once we finally get the DNS records sorted.
<P>
So what can you expect from Birmingham next year? Well we're hoping to hold the conference at the Aston University complex, from August 30th to September 1st. There will be beer. There will be Baltis. How could you resist :)
<P>
More news soon.</p>

You just need to check the definite dates, so we can organize our vacations.<br/><br/>Good luck with the organization. Let me (us) know if you need some information about this year YAPC.<br/><br/>See you.

Dates and venue, etc will be announced as soon as we confirm and book. Look out for announcements in all the usual (and a few unusual) places<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

When you get something for definate (like the dates, or whenever you release the birmingham openguides site) you should do a story on the main use.perl.  Not everyone reads your journal!

Fear not we are preparing press releases for use.perl and many other sites. Expect some initial announcements shortly.
