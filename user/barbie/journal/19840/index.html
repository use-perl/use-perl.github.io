<p>Tonight <a href="http://birmingham.pm.org">Birmingham.pm</a> are joining up with <A HREF="http://www.wolveslug.org.uk/">Wolves LUG</A> for their social meeting in Wolverhampton. They meet at <A HREF="http://www.standardrestaurant.co.uk/">The Standard</A> curry house, so I'm well happy with that. The only disappointment is that the last train leaves just after 11pm, meaning we can't drink and chat like the others 'til 2am! Another time perhaps.
<P>
Tomorrow I get to present my Perl talks to the <A HREF="http://www.sb.lug.org.uk/">South Birmingham LUG</A>, who are having their technical meeting at Birmingham University. We're doing a talk exchange, as a couple of their guys are coming to the Birmingham.pm <A HREF="http://birmingham.pm.org/docs/technical-next.html">technical meeting</A> later in the month. I cribbed most of the first talk from a talk <A HREF="http://use.perl.org/user/davorg/journal/">Dave Cross</A> gave sometime ago, while the second is an updated version of one I gave to Birmingham.pm earlier in the year. I'm hoping to recruit a few extra Perl mongers along the way, and hopefully promote Perl more in the West Midlands. Should be interesting to see how I cope in front of a fresh audience.
<P>
When I posted on the Birmingham.pm list about the talks, I had some interesting questions regarding my CPAN testing talk. Several expected it to be about testing in general and some of the Test:: modules. As there is obviously alot of interest for this, I hope to present another session to SBLUG later in the year covering how to do testing with Perl. There has also been talk of doing something similar for work too.</p>

The 'A Brief Introduction to Perl' talk you gave to LONIX. I originally had some slides I started working on, but having read your talk, I thought it had a better structure. I've edited it in parts with the extra bits I wanted to mention, but it's still mostly your talk.
<p>
You get the credit on the first slide too<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>
