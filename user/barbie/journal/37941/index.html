<p><p>If you're on <a href="http://www.facebook.com">Facebook</a>, you may already be aware of the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/inbox/?ref=mb#/group.php?gid=2331173193">Perl Mongers group</a> that I set up some time ago. The group is open to all and you are more than welcome to add yourself if you haven't already done so. Currently there are 646 members from all around the world. One of the reasons for creating the Facebook group was to help promote the local Perl Monger user groups, as well as some of the Perl events, such as YAPCs, that are held all over the world. As a consequence, earlier this year I created events for YAPC::NA 2008 and YAPC::Europe 2008, which proved very popular. Partly in preparation for next year, the following events are now available to sign-up to:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=23685648119">London Perl Workshop</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=49235281584">YAPC::NA 2009</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=35195122275">YAPC::Europe 2009</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Feel free to add yourself and tell your friends/colleagues of Facebook about the events.</p>

<p>I've been trying to keep the main group page up to date with events, but more new ones seem to be popping up all the time. If you have an event and would like me to create a Perl Monger event on Facebook, either <a href="http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=739385762">contact me</a> through Facebook or via my <a href="mailto:barbie@cpan.org">CPAN email</a>, let me know the details and I'll generate the necessary pages. Or if you have already created an event on Facebook, feel free to post a link on the group page or add a note to the wall to advertise it.</p>

<p>With more and more people getting involved with Facebook, the Perl Mongers group is an ideal way to promote both YAPCs and Workshops to people who might not otherwise see them. Remember that not every programmer interested in Perl reads use.perl, PerlMonks and the like. However, there is a good chance they will be on Facebook, and will see someone they know signing up to a Perl event that they previously never knew existed.</p>

<p>It all goes to prove the Perl is not just alive and well, but active and healthy :)</p></p>
