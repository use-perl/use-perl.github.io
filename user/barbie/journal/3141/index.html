<div class="span8">
<p>This last week has not been a good one. The only good thing that happened was on Friday, when Nicole played her gig, which went down exceedingly well thankfully.
<P>
It was announced to us at Questions on Tuesday, that the company was having money troubles and the expected promise of cash from a Venture Capitalist never materialised. However, seeing as we are down to a skeleton staff after the last round of redundacies, any further losses are likely to destroy the company. So they've proposed we take 50/50 split of pay/holiday or pay/shares. I opted for the pay/holiday split, in the hope that I might find the odd quick website to do to keep the money rolling in. Little did I realise how desperate people were.
<P>
Over the weekend I put forward 5 proposals to projects advertised on a freelance site. Until today no-one had replied. The reply I did get was both a disappointment and an eye opener. One of the jobs I had pitched for was a fictious job, posted by a designer who was beginning to wonder if anybody was using the site. He'd been pitching for jobs for 3 months and heard nothing. Was he pitching right, too much money, not enough, were his sites too bad or too good? So as an experiment he posted a job to see what kind of response he got. Within the space of a few hours the pitches started rolling in. After 250 in 24 hours he stopped counting, but he did send a report out to everyone, apologising for time wasting, but also giving a valuable guide as to what everyone was pitching for a basic 5-8 page site.
<P>
Many are students or have read a book and think they can do it for ÃÂ£50 or even free. I pitched quite high, but certainly not the highest, based on about half my current rate. If that's the state of the market then perhaps I should start thinking about going back to embedded C, where I can earn stupid money without too much effort!<br/><br/></p>

<h2>Specialize!</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ajtaylor/">ajtaylor</a> on 2002-02-27T03:01:55</h3>
As you noticed, anyone can pick up a book &amp; learn "design" and HTML. Or even worse, buy a copy of Dreamweaver or Frontpage &amp; put together a website. What you need to do is specialize. HTML monkeys are everywhere. You said you also do embedded programming? Go with that - there might be less volume of work, but at least you could make money w/ it.
<p>
Here's an idea: If you want steady freelance work, find a local design shop that doesn't know how to do programming, and volunteer your services. I had it slightly easier in that they came to me.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-) But now I have the design shop, PLUS I'm doing other work (and billing directly) for the design shop's client. I'm sure I got lucky, but if it worked for me, maybe it will for you as well.</p>
