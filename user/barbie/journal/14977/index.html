<div class="span8">
<p>Started looking into writing a new module the other day. It sort of works on my Windows box at work, but there's that annoying popup [1] from Outlook that I don't think I can get round. The idea was to write it so that I can send automated reports from the CPAN testing scripts. Currently they look for recognised mail apps or SMTP, none of which are available here.
<P>
I uploaded a very alpha version on the <a href='http://birmingham.pm.org/modules/'>Birmingham.pm modules</a> page, but it needs a bit of developing before I release it.
<P>
I've also mailed the authors of the testing scripts/modules in the hope that they can aid my ability to send a batch of reports. I don't think it'll be too traumatic to do, but then I haven't delved too far into the code yet. I'd also like to test CPAN modules on my laptop too, which doesn't always have a network connection attached, and currently has no mail apps configured. If I could save reports I could simple send them off once I'm back online, or transfer them to another box to send. Here's hoping it's possible. Failing that I'll have to hack the current scripts for my own ends.
<P>
[1] Annoying, but at least it prevents viruses doing things they shouldn't.</p>
