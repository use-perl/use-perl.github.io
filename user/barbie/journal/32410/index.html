<p><p>EvilDave has recently started CPAN Testing, and happened to ask about a quick start guide to get him up and running. Since the demise of the testing piece in CPANPLUS, there wasn't really anything to take it's place, so over a year ago I started putting together a <a href="http://yacsmoke.cvs.sourceforge.net/yacsmoke/CPAN-YACSmoke/lib/CPAN/YACSmoke/TesterGuide.pod?revision=1.1&view=markup">TesterGuide</a> within <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/CPAN-YACSmoke/lib/CPAN/YACSmoke.pm">CPAN-YACSmoke</a>. However, this guide is still only in the CVS reporsitory on sourceforge, as we haven't had a release of CPAN-YACSmoke for quite sometime. The main reason for no further release was due to me organising YAPC::Europe last year and a working on a few other priorities. However, I do want to get a release out some time this year.
<p>As the TesterGuide is now partly out of date (no mention of Dave's <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/CPAN-Reporter/lib/CPAN/Reporter.pod">CPAN::Reporter</a> or Chris' <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/POE-Component-CPAN-YACSmoke/lib/POE/Component/CPAN/YACSmoke.pm">POE::Component::CPAN::YACSmoke</a>), if anyone has the time to patch it with more up to date text, please feel free to email me or add an new ticket into <a href="http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Dist/Display.html?Name=CPAN-YACSmoke">RT</a>. 
<p>The bigger problem for getting a release sorted is getting the test suite for CPAN::YACSmoke completed. I want to get it working better with the current codebase first, which will then see a new release, then the ability to working with either CPANPLUS or CPAN/CPAN-Reporter is the next step. If anyone is up for the challenge of adding tests to the current suite, again feel free to email me or add tickets to RT.
<p>I should really start up a mailing list for this, but as yet only Rob and myself have been doing any development work. Perhaps now would be a good time to kick start all this again :)</p>

I ended up using CPAN::Reporter, because it slips into the way I normally do things and Just Works, so required less thinking than any other approach would have.
