<p><p>As <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/jj/journal/32349">JJ</a> has mention the Birmingham.pm social last night was at The Wellington. The Wellington is a bit unusual in that it doesn't serve food, but they are happy for you to eat there. They even provide plates, cutlery and sauces. Everyone else had already had food before they got here, and Greg and I were the only ones who hadn't. We did contemplate going to the nearby Supermarket, but Steve suggested the Thai restaurant across the road, which is supposed to be really nice. As we looked at the menu outside, I am not surprised it was really nice, at those prices I should hope they were one of the best in Brum. Greg really likes Thai food, and seeing as they do a takeaway service, he persuaded me to at least find out how much they charge on the takeaway menu. I'm glad he did, as the prices are almost half. We had decent starter and main course each and both came to ÃÂ£8. Only slightly more than a main course basic burger in the Old Joint Stock. I think we'll be back again next month :)
<p>The only downer was that it was a bit smoky and the volume of voices was a bit too loud. They don't play music, but I was struggling to here conversations even across the table. It wasn't this bad last time we were at the pub, so hopefully we just picked an off day.
<p>The others did enjoy several of the Real Ales on offer, but seeing as I only drink stout, I think they were a little disappointed I didn't at least try the <a href="http://images.jonallen.info/display.pl?template=perl&image=497">Perle Beer</a> :)</p>
