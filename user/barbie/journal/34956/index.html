<div class="span8">
<p><p>After a troubled couple of days, the grango.org domain is back online again. I've just reinstated all the DNS entries and the CPAN Testers Wiki and Statistics sites are back online again, along with 20 other subdomains. After being informed that the EasySpace engineers could restore all the DNS entries from backup, and being fobbed yesterday and this morning that it was still in the queue, I then discovered that they are unable to do a restore! So I have had to re-enter all entries by hand again. If I had been told this on Tuesday I would had the sites back online then.
<p>Along the way of getting this sorted, I have now inadvertently discovered that they also store all their customer passwords in plain text. If ever there was a reason to run screaming this was it. Unfortunately as I don't want to lose the re-registration I've just paid, I have to wait 60 days before putting in a transfer request. So I've now marked in my calendar to transfer domains at the end of January.
<p>I hope that'll be the last I ever hear of EasySpace after that. February can't come quickly enough now.</p>
