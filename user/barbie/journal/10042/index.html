<p>These last couple of months have found me wondering what the hell I'm going to do with myself. The job market is embarrassing round here ... even after Christmas. To make matters worse agents and companies just aren't bothering to get back in touch after sending off CVs and the occasional follow up phone call.
<P>
I can understand agents and companies may get several CVs for a particular job, but is it really that difficult to send a quick email to say thanks, but no thanks, or some indication that they are dealing with your CV.
<P>
One particular company, who I would be very interested in working for seem to have taken a vow of silence. I've thought it would be good to get away from designing websites, and this particular company, though dealing with the web/internet is more about writing applications. The company website reads like they are exactly the kind of company I want to work for. So I sent my CV off, to hear nothing. About 2 weeks later, a jobsite had a really great job posted, so I sent off my CV to the agent, only to discover it's the same company. I let them know I've sent my CV in, and they promised to follow it up for me. After a week of no word I called the agent, who said they'd get back to me. It's now been over 4 weeks since the agent said they would get back to me and nearly two months since I originally sent my CV.
<P>
So far I've sent off about 20 CVs in response to various job postings. So far only 2 have responded. Am I really that unemployable?
<P>
Unfortunately I haven't had much time to work on any Perl projects that I had planned to either, which has been getting me down. I was planning to have a couple of applications ready that I could perhaps sell, one as a shareware app and the other as a business concern, but alas no. I still need to look at updating the NMS site that I originally said nearly 3 months ago I'd take a look at.
<P>
If anyone out there within easy reach of (south) Birmingham needs a decent Perl programmer please get in touch.</p>

<h2>Agents are there to make sure you DON'T get a job!</h2>

<p>I know the feeling. When I lost my job two years ago, it was like pissing in the wind. I sent of CV after CV to companies that I thought I was a good fit for, only to discover the CV goes to an agent who seems more interested in sending you somewhere you're not interested in.</p>

<p>Since I've had a job, I've had a number of recruiters ring me up weekly, offering me people (even though we've had no vacancies) that were totally inappropriate for any job we may have...</p>

<p>I can but wish you the best of luck</p>
