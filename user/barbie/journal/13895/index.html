<p>Thanks to David, Book, Eric and the Paris crew for organising yet another great conference. It really did feel like everything had gone by too fast I was enjoying myself so much. There were several talks I missed, which has more to say about the interest of the talks than the scheduling, and many names and faces I can now put together. Lots of ideas to implement. 
<P>
I managed to catch the CPANTS BOF along the way, but missed all the other BOFs. I would have liked to have been part of the PerlMonks Photo, but maybe next year. I should have paid more attention to the BOFs as I'm sure there were others I was interested in, but got carried away with events and completely forgot to check.
<P>
I think only one person asked why? And no-one bought me a drink as a bribe either. Perhaps Greg's efforts in Amsterdam 2001 had stalled that idea. Perhaps their thinking of another method. Or better still, if you're thinking 'why what?' at this point, I need not worry :)
<P>
I got asked a couple of times whether I was doing a talk. I really must get over this fear of standing up in front of 200+ people and speaking. I have two fledging ideas for talks I could do, neither of which have been covered before, so maybe 2004 will be the year for my inauguration into the YAPC Speakers Hall of Fame. We'll see. See you all next year.
