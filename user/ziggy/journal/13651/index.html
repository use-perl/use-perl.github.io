<p>A few Swiss researchers <a href="http://news.com.com/2100-1009_3-5053063.html?tag=fd_top">discovered</a> that it's not too difficult to stage a brute force attack on encrypted Windows passwords.
<p>
Why?  Well, Microsoft has used a one-way hash function to encrypt passwords since they were introduced in Win3.1.  But they never added <i>salt</i> to their hash algorithm, so with a big enough lookup table (say, 1.4GB, something that easily fits into an off-the-shelf PC these days), you can identify someone's password by looking at the encrypted version.  Win2K and later upgraded the hashing algorithm to make it stronger, but <i>it still doesn't use salt</i>!
<p>
Cryptography is a broad and dense field, but the basics are easy to understand.  Adding randomness (i.e. salt in a one-way password hashing function) is one of the earliest and easiest lessons to learn.  
<p>
The description of the early Win3.1 password hash (uppercase everything, hash 7-byte chunks) smaks of being too clever by half[1], and being too unsophisticated, even by early 1990s standards.  There just isn't any excuse for doing that in the first place, doubly so because it's <i>still</i> in use.  Using salted passwords was the norm in the <i>1980s</i>, back before Win3.1 was even conceived.
<p>
&nbsp;
<p>
[1] At one point, the interminably long "product activation keys" used by all Microsoft products was outed: it was about ~20 alpha numeric characters, but the only ones that mattered were the 5 numeric characters at the end which needed to equal <tt>0 mod 7</tt>.  So <tt>0000-000000-000000-00000</tt> was a perfectly valid activation key in the late 1990s.  :-)</p>
