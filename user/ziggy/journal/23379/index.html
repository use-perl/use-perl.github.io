<p>At <tt>$WORK</tt>, we've been talking about the <a href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/loty/">language-of-the-year</a> [1] since about October, if not earlier.  I had planned on looking into <a href="http://www.ocaml.org/">OCaml</a> in 2005, while a one of my colleagues decided to look into <a href="http://www.haskell.org">Haskell</a> instead.
<p>
In January, I was pretty busy with <tt>$LIFE</tt>, so I didn't get much started.  Hearing how wonderful Haskell is, and watching Autrijus working on <a href="http://www.pugscode.org/">Pugs</a> from afar, I decided to switch tracks and get into Haskell.
<p>
As far as programming languages go, Haskell is very different from anything else I've seen or used.  Approaching it with a Lisp/Scheme mindset helps, but isn't sufficient -- there's still a period of adjustment.  
<p>
Interestingly, we're looking at writing a parser at <tt>$WORK</tt>, and we're actively avoiding the standard <tt>lex</tt> / <tt>yacc</tt> two step for a couple of reasons: (1) it needs to be fast, (2) it needs to be threadsafe, (3) it needs to be <b>fast</b>, (4) it needs to produce helpful error messages, (5) we need the option to use load more than one parser at a time (some yacc's don't do that very easily), and (6) did I mention it needs to be both <b>fast</b> and <b>threadsafe</b>?  ;-)
<p>
ML / OCaml / Haskell are good languages for writing parsers and interpreters, so that's an obvious path to examine.  The engineering on the <a href="http://www.haskell.org/ghc">Glasgow Haskell Compiler</a> is downright impressive, and battle-scared enough that we're not squeamish adding it to the toolchain.      (Among other things, it can compile to .c / .o files on the standard platforms.)  And if you're going to be doing parsing in Haskell, your first stop is probably going to be <a href="http://www.cs.uu.nl/user/daan/parsec.html">Parsec</a>.
<p>
Sure, learning Haskell takes some effort and adjustment.  But it's worthwhile.  Looking over the <a href="http://www.cs.uu.nl/user/daan/download/parsec/parsec.pdf">paper on Parsec</a>, it condenses a year's undergraduate curriculum on parsing and compiler theory down to about 50 pages (including index).  And you only need to read the about first half of it to get a working understanding of compiler theory -- which is <i>much</i> better than the alternatives.

<p>
<small>[1]: In <i>The Pragmatic Programmer</i>, Dave and Andy recommend learning a new programming language every year, just to stay fresh.  Best case, you'll learn a great new tool.  Worst case, you'll gain a new perspective on coding practices to use and avoid.</small></p>
