<p>I bought a standard size noname backpack in college about 14 years ago.  It cost more than I could afford at the time (about $50 IIRC), but I was tired of burning through cheaply made $20 backpacks every few months.
<p>
It was one of the best investments I ever made.  That backpack finally gave up the ghost last November.  It lasted over a decade of continuous and rather heavy use.  (I used to be able to stuff a week's worth of groceries in there, and still be able to carry it comfortably for a good long haul).  There's nothing really wrong with it now, just that one of the straps has pulled out of it's seam.  A good cobbler should be able to fix it.
I think it's time to give this bag a rest though.  There are better bags on the market these days -- better fitting, more compartments, stronger straps, more water resistant, compression straps, the whole shebang.  
<p>
So I've been in the market for an Eagle Creek bag for a few months now.  Haven't found a lot of floor stock about, but I finally found <a href="http://www.eaglecreek.com/day_travelers/60054.html">a good everyday backpack</a> this weekend.  I looked at Eagle Creek about six months ago, and their website wasn't doing any ecommerce yet (just shuttling you off to your favorite electronic or brick-and-morter merchant).  Why Eagle Creek?  My other everyday bag is an Eagle Creek attache (an old design, before they all had padded laptop compartments).  That bag is about 10 years old, and is only just now starting to fray away at the piping.  I've burned through three shoulder straps, but it still keeps hanging in there.  :-)</p>
