<p>Are you using <i>slow</i> applications to process the XML data flowing through your enterprise?  Then try <a href="http://www.datapower.com/products/xa35.html">this</a>!  Not only does it come with built-in support for XML 1.0, XSLT 1.0 and XPath 1.0, but it fits in a 1U cabinet with <i><b>4</b></i> 10/100 Ethernet ports!  And it's the only product on the market that can process XML at <i><b>wire speed</b></i>!</p>

<h2>XML, the new AI?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/mir/">mir</a> on 2002-09-12T15:55:08</h3>
This is scary!<br> <br>It reminds me of the old Lisp Machines. I remember the times when AI was The Next Big Thing (tm) and how I got scolded by my PHB a couple of years later for saying that the software she wanted to buy was an Expert System...<br> <br>This is very bad news for XML indeed<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;--)<br> <br>



<h2>No, good news</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Matts/">Matts</a> on 2002-09-13T07:19:06</h3>
Because beyond this particular box we can get back to reality again. XML becomes background noise (like RDBMS' now are), and we can all just move along to something far more interesting. Like getting our jobs done again.

Possibly.  This box sounds like it's hype driven, though.
<p>
As I understand it (from <a href="http://lists.xml.org/archives/xml-dev/200209/msg00320.html" title="xml.org">the post to xml-dev</a xml.org>), this "accelerator" is a fuzzy allocation of CPU resources; it sits on a network and performs XML-&gt;[X]HTML transformations using XSLT (the product page hypes that it's XPath 1.0 compliant as well...).  Since a 386 could flood a 10-Mbit ethernet connection, it sounds like they're just moving the transformation process off of a (possibly saturated) server to another (probably underused) server.</p>

<i>This box sounds like it's hype driven, though.</i> <br> <br>That's my point. This is a good thing. Once you reach the point of hysteria there's only good stuff on the other side of it.<br> <br>Although I'm fairly sure that boxes like this one have been around for a couple of years now. I remember seeing something like it being advertised at one of the XML conferences I went to.
