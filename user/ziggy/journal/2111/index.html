<p>I was teaching the XML Schema course in New York last week.  It's a very condensed presentation of the XML Schema language and really deserves about 2 days of coverage.  Unfortunately, I had to cram that and a 3-day XPath/XSLT into three days.  The presentation was a little rushed (about 450 slides in 3 days, when 90 slides/day is a <i>good</i> pace).
<p>
Like most XML programmers, I'm not too fond of XML Schema.  Ideally, I could be teaching RELAX NG instead, but realistically it's the big companies that want XML Schema because it's blessed, but the bleeding-edge programmers that want RELAX NG.  This mess will probably sort itself out in about 18 months time.  Regardless of the RELAX NG / XML Schema split, XML Schema will probably be around for a long time because (1) it's blessed by the W3C, and (2) because it's the only schema language at the moment that provides any validation of element/attribute content.
<p>
As usual, I found that as I present the material on structures (&lt;xsd:complexType/&gt;, &lt;xsd:simpleType/&gt;, &lt;xsd:complexContent/&gt; and &lt;xsd:simpleContent/&gt;), I find myself tyring to hold back the bile and not become an apologist for the spec.
Then I get to the point where enough material is covered to produce schemas that validate meaningful content and structure -- like a block that tags addresses that can validate US States (either abbreviations or spelled out), zip codes and optional zip + 4.  The real beauty here is that with a few tweaks to the structure, that is composable into a larger container that can validate US addresses or Canadian addresses <i>through the schema definition</i>.  (Extending this to the entire Commonwealth is left as an exercise for the reader...)
<p>
So, as much as I dislike XML Schema, each time I get to this slide, I find that I really like what it can/should do (even if the syntax is overcomplicated and could benefit from a couple of refactorings).  The best part is that this validation can be done declaratively and automatically -- regardless of the programming language used.</p>
