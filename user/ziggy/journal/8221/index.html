<p>Washington, DC is on the world scene, again.  This time it is because of a <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/delegatrix/journal/8218">rash of inexplicable shootings</a> in the area.  These aren't your run of the mill mafia/drug war/mugging/turf battle style homicides though.  They're apparently totally random, and without warning.
<p>
Unfortunately, the net effect is that the lead story every few hours for the last 3.5 days has been either &laquo;<i>no new shootings, no significant new developments</i>&raquo;, or &laquo;<i>there's been another shooting, but we don't know if it's related</i>&raquo;.
<p>
It's getting quite frustrating.  Especially when the Chief of Police has long since run out of interesting ways to say &laquo;<i>We don't have any news to report; here's a summary of what we've said before.  I'll answer your questions now.</i>&raquo;</p>

<h2>This just in: no new developments!</h2>

And people wonder why I totally avoid the US news media, but local and national.

I've grown to expect the local news to be inane, and the network news to be worthless.
<p>
What's new and annoying is that the Montgomery County Police Chief is acting like a very poor Press Secretary, holding news conferences every three hours (or less).  He doesn't have anything new to say most of the time, and usually uses these opportunities to pump up minor changes (we now have <i>two</i> numbers to call if you've seen the sniper!  keep those calls coming!).
</p><p>
For the last few days, he's been slowly introducing the ever-expanding task force looking into this crime (like the presence of more "leaders" behind the podium will solve these murders any faster...).  Pretty soon, half of the staffs for the ATF, FBI, DCPD and various surburban police departments will have been introduced to the press to say "we don't know much  more than we knew three hours ago, nor do we know much more than we did this time yesterday..."</p>

You say that as if this wouldn't happen, given the same circumstances, anywhere else.  Odd.
