<p>This spammy piece of email made it through spamassassin and into my inbox this afternoon:

You have received a Picture Share from {firstName}.
  
  
  
To view it, click the link below:

[...]
</pre>
At first glance, it looked like another HTML spam with a link to some pr0n.  The use of the literal "<tt>{firstName}</tt>" in the body of the message looked rather odd, as did poorly auto-generated content of the message.
<p>
Just as I was about to delete it, I looked at the email address again.  It was a 10 digit number, and looked vaguely like a phone number of someone who would call me. I checked the link, and it was indeed a picture from someone's phone.  
<p>
I'm counting the days before pr0nspam and harrassing email starts coming through this way...</p>

<h2>Reverse-lookup the number.</h2>

Was it a picture of some(one|thing) you know?
<p>
I habitually do a reverse lookup of unknown numbers, so I would have tossed that number into Watson to see who it belonged to before I clicked.  But if the spammers got lots of phone numbers related to a community website, they could fake the sender with a likely number, and it might end up spam anyway.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:(

Has Friendster or the like had any security breaches lately?</p>

Yes, but that was not immediately obvious given how the message was constructed.
