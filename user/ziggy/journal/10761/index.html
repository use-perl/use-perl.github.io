<p>Well, it's happening.  The US, UK and Spain have put forward a <a href="http://nytimes.com/2003/02/24/international/worldspecial/24CND-IRAQ.html?pagewanted=print&position=bottom">second resolution</a> to the UN Security council to declare Iraq in material breach:
<blockquote><i>
The draft resolution is direct: It warns Baghdad of "serious consequences" should it not immediately disarm, but it does not set a deadline for a United Nations vote on the resolution. Diplomats say, however, that they expect a vote sometime in the next few weeks.
<p>
 The resolution also stops short of requesting "all necessary means" to force Iraq to comply.
</i></blockquote>
Somehow, I wish they didn't stop short of requesting "all necessary means" to force Iraq to comply.
<p>
Bush the Elder had a stately way with foreign policy.  Sure, he reigned flaming death upon Iraq.  But he also waged military action with nothing more than a few stacks of Marshall amps and a nice mix that included endless repetitions of &laquo;<i>Highway to Hell</i>&raquo; turned up to about 11 or 12.
<p>
Somehow, I don't think Bush the Younger has the style or the inclination to try to resolve this issue by blasting &laquo;<i>Tonight I'm Gonna Rock Ya Tonight!</i>&raquo; or &laquo;<i>Start Me Up</i>&raquo; or the Complete Works of Celine Dion until Sadaam accedes...</p>

When I say <i>turn the knobs all the way to 12</i> I really mean it.  If C&#233;line doesn't do the trick, then it's time to use heavy artillery:  Jim Neighbors, William Shatner (<i>Lucy!  In the Sky!  With!  Diamonds!!!!</i>), John Tesh, Yanni and Zamfir, Master of the Pan Flute.
<p>
If <i>that</i> doesn't work, then it's time to send in the drones.</p>

<h2>Are we talking about Panama?</h2>

Ah, Panama, where a victory was gained with only rock and roll. Maybe.<br> <blockquote><div>When Bush Sr invaded Panama in 1989, journalists were once again banned. Democratic congressman Charles Rangle of New York still insists that as many as 5,000 civilians in Panama City were killed by US invaders. But there are no pictures, no eyewitness accounts.<br> <br>The invasion of Panama and the arrest of Manuel Noriega were, like Desert Storm later, something of a political triumph for Bush. But the reality of that particular war asserted itself during a televised briefing by the president. It was just at the end of the session, when Bush was wisecracking with reporters, that most networks split their screens to show the arrival of dead US soldiers from Panama.<br> <br>Bush was caught bantering as flag-draped coffins arrived at an air force base in Dover, Delaware - a military mortuary. Later that week, Bush ordered the press banned from covering the arrival ceremonies for the fallen.</div></blockquote> <br>From towards the end of this <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/g2/story/0,3604,894708,00.html" title="guardian.co.uk">Guardian article</a guardian.co.uk> by the Pulitzer prizewinning journalist Patrick J Sloyan.<br> <br>(Presumably Rangle's view is in the minority, but I thought I'd point it out anyway. I'm feeling worryingly serious at the moment.Sorry.)

Marginally related<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... it seems that the Pentagon has been workingn overtime to improve media access in the coming conflict, compared to past conflicts.  They held Boot Camp for journalists, and their new "motto" for releasing information (like photos and video) is "minutes and hours, not days and weeks."  I don't know much about what else they are doing in this realm<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...
