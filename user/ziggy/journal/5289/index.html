<div class="span8">
<p>I'm really aching to ditch Windows.  Unfortunately, I need to view PowerPoint and RTF files faithfully; Open Source tools aren't quite there yet (and I haven't yet convinced my clients to bite the bullet and move to PDF).  
<p>
Doing some routine maintenance on my Win* box, I inadvertantly left virtual memory turned off.  Shouldn't matter too much; the box has 256MB of RAM.
<p>
Today, I was comparing two RTF documents side-by-side; one just under 1MB, the other about 1.5MB.  With nothing else running concurrently but for a bash shell, I got a "low memory" warning from Word; the entire machine slowed to less than a crawl as it valiantly tried to figure out how to task switch, but couldn't remember how...
<p>
Now I read <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/cs/weblog/view/wlg/1464">this</a>, where Brett McLaughlin talks about his new TiBook:
<blockquote><i>
Instead of looking like some nerd that should have on horn-rimmed glasses, I can code on a machine that would fit in more at an IKEA magazine booth than an Internet cafe. And with 512 MB of RAM, I can edit Photoshop images that are 50 MB+ without having to kill my Java processing (an XSL transformation running under Ant) in the background; my Windows desktop (also with 512 MB) chokes on the exact same task. So now I've got the sleek, sexy exterior with the under-the-hood power I want.
</i></blockquote>
Freedom to innovate?  Greenspun was right; in a few years, Microsoft just might be delivering 1985-era advances to the masses.</p>

<h2>OS X</h2>

<p>I love my TiBook, too. I wrote <a href="http://david.wheeler.net/osx.html" title="wheeler.net">an article</a wheeler.net> on getting some of the requisite stuff that Perl hackers need, so you can use it when you've made the upgrade, Ziggy.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>

I'm just wondering how the RTF support in NeXTSTEP / OS X compares to modern versions of Word.  The original RTF spec is intended to be forward compatible, so that if the native RTF widgets in OS X are only capable of dealing with v1.1, they should (in theory) be able to read most portions of v1.5 documents, ignoring the new and unknown control words.
<p>
If that works, it would go a long way to helping me read the files I need to read on a daily basis.</p>

<p>I have no idea. I use Office v.X. I'm not sure there's a native RTF viewer on OS X. AppleWorks would probably work, though, and it often ships with OS X systems.</p>

<p>No, wait, hold the phone. I just saved a text-only document to RTF in Word v.X, and it opened quite nicely in TextEdit, the default OS X document editor. Cool! If you want to send me a document, I can try to open it in TextEdit and see how it looks.</p>

<p>One thing that's <b>really</b> cool about OS X is native support for PDF. In the print dialog box of any application, I can click the <i>preview</i> button, and it takes me into the Preview application, where I can save a document to PDF. I use this for sending invoices, contracts, etc. I can even send a PDF dump of an RTF file you send me and I view in TextEdit.</p>

The more I read this stuff, the more I want to just go out &amp; buy a tiBook.
