<p>Walking to the train this afternoon, I walked past a group of street performers in the Inner Harbor.  This is a daily occurrance in the spring and summer, and today's ensemble was a steel drum band (about 12 people, including someone playing a regular drum kit, and possibly a few other intstruments as well).  They were pretty decent, and attracted a much larger crowd than the ubiquitous South American Indians playing windpipes with their newagey CD accompaniment.
<p>
That was interesting in and of itself.  What was more interesting was what they were playing.
<p>
I can't put my finger on it, but I'm sure it was some Glen Miller, or at least something from the 1940s big band era.  The steel drums certainly bring something new to that kind of music.  :-)</p>
