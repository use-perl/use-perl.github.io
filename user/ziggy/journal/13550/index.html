<p>The irrepressible Philip Greenspun has made another <a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/philg/2003/07/18#a884">pronouncement</a>:
<blockquote><i>
[P]eople over the age of 25 shouldn't use Unix/GNU/Linux/whatever, unless they are full-time professional Unix sysadmins.
</i></blockquote>
Why?  Because a Really Smart (tm) friend of his managed to mangle <tt>/etc</tt> when he extracted a tar file instead of listing it.  Obviously, the solution here is to upgrade to WinXP where thousands of pointless dialog boxes pop up if you're about to do anything dangerous...
<p>
The real revelation here is that suffering from MIT Syndrome does not absolve you from being tired or careless.</p>

<p>If those kids would just get <a href="http://www.embedded.com/story/OEG20010706S0053" title="embedded.com">back to their 16 hour-a-day jobs</a embedded.com>, they wouldn't have time to mess around!  Plus, in five years, they'll hate computers!  Does no one have any work ethic anymore?</p>

I find it very, very hard to be civil when discussion some of the hogwash that Greenspun spouts. So I'll shut up about it now.

<p>S'okay.  When Ziggy and I are around, we tend to gripe about just about everything everyone's ever said about "the right way to write software".  Why, just the other day, I was saying "Incremental delivery?  That's just a fancy way of saying you take an afternoon off every week to 'run the build'."</p>

Who said you had to be civil about Greenspun?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)
<p>
The man is so demonstrably brilliant that we ought to listen to him and throw out man-millenia of experience and best practice because brilliant yet aging MIT grads (like him) might make a careless mistake and royally mess up a Unix box.  WinXP is <i>obviously</i> so much easier to administer because of all of those thousands of inane dialog boxes, and you can <i>never</i> mess up a Windows box like you could a Unix box, so there's an <i>intuitive</i> benefit there...
</p><p>
Oh, except for the professional Unix sysadmins.  All of whom are perpetually under 25, infallable, alert and unstoppable.  Until they heed the call to <a href="http://www.sciflicks.com/logans_run/" title="sciflicks.com">Sanctuary</a sciflicks.com> and admit that Win* is just <b>better</b>...</p>

<h2>I feel the same way about cars</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jjohn/">jjohn</a> on 2003-07-20T12:45:06</h3>
Since most folks under 25 get into automobile accidents, clearly they shouldn't be driving.  Why are we listening to Greenspun, again?

Actually, the under 25s should be polite and stop clogging the roads.  Boston would be <i>so</i> much more drivable if no one under 25 had a drivers license.
<p>
And everyone should just make way for the <a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/philg/2003/07/11#a853" title="harvard.edu">autodidacts</a harvard.edu> who teach themselves how to fly a helicopter.  It's really intuitive, isn't it?
</p><blockquote><div> <i>

Isn't it obvious?  Because he's right!  Or is it wrong?  I didn't go to MIT, so I keep getting those two words confused...

<h2>My impression...</h2>

My impression is that his entry was suggesting _old_farts_ stay away from linux and leave it to the young'uns with the mental acuity to handle the beast.<br> <br>Others should take the idiot route...<br> <br>---<br> <br>OTOH... it seems to me that the above posters had the opposite impression.<br> <br>Must be my getting close to 40...<br> <br>P.S. I've been lurking for months, and decided to finally get an account to make this entry... probably something to do with turning 40 next year.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)<br>
