<p>We all know that online voting and "reader's choice awards" are well-nigh
meaningless these days.  The results purport to convey the views of the
readership.  In fact, they represent the views of a <a
href="http://use.perl.org/user/pudge">few individuals</a> who know <a
href="http://espn.go.com/mlb/s/2001/0624/1218244.html">how to stuff a
ballot box</a>.

<p>

These antics are so 1995 (remember <i>Harry, the Angry Drunken Dwarf</i>
and his friend <i>Harry, the Drunken Angry Dwarf</i>?), but they persist
and will never go away.

<p>

Fast forward to the latest "scandal" - the voting for the <tt>$magazine</tt>
Reader's Choice award.  Kevin Bedell describes it this way:

<blockquote><i>
Another example of this is the annual ballot stuffing that occurs in the
voting for the Java Developer's Journal (JDJ) Reader's Choice Awards. It
seems every company that has a product nominated sends out e-mail blasts
to their employees encouraging them to vote for the company's products.
<p>
Some companies raise this ballot stuffing to an art form. Their mottos
seem to be, "Vote early, vote often, and write a perl script to keep
voting for you after you leave for the day". 
</i></blockquote>

Hm.  Good to know that even Java vendors use Perl for the hard stuff.  ;-)

Even Sports Night used perl for their ballot stuffing.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br> <br>What really bugs me are the polls that really purport to mean something, like online political polls.  Favorite actor or ballplayer is one thing, but man, when the subject is meaningful, there is inly *negative* value in having an online poll.  It harms the open discussion of the topic.
