<p>I use a 40GB FireWire drive to back up my Macs.  <tt>rsync-hfs</tt> keeps a copy of whatever's currently on the important parts of my hard drives.  I don't do incremental backups or use tape; that's too much work, and having a reasonably current spare is sufficient for the moment.  
<p>
I'm thinking about backing up everything (not just $HOME and other such bits), and doing incrementals.  The 120GB FireWire drives are reasonably cheap.  I could get one, but the 250GB FireWire drives are out there.  In a few months they should be hovering around $150, roughly where the 120GB FireWire drives are today.
<p>
Think about it - .25TB as an impulse purchase just for backups and stuff.  My first hard drive was 45MB, about $450, and it was spacious enough that it took me a couple of years to fill it up (about the time it died due to stiction problems).  A few years ago, 36GB of online storage for a test server was a big deal.
<p>
What a long, strange trip it's been...</p>

<h2>Strange Times</h2>

Yes - I've been decommissioning some old HP servers over the last few weeks - in some cases I had to physically destroy the disks. It was strange to smash up "big" 2GB SCSI disks that probably cost in the thousands when first purchased.
