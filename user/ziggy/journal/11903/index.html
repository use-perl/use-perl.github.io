<p>Sam Calagione, the founder and president of the Dogfish Head Brewery in Delaware, is a dangerous man.  The guy is crazy about beer, and his beer is crazy.   Here's a <a href="http://www.dogfish.com/beer/index.cfm">sample</a>:
<ul>
<li>60 minute IPA: 6% ABV, 60 IBU</li>
<li>90 minute IPA: 9%ABV, 90 IBU</li>
<li>120 minute IPA: <b>21%ABV</b>, <i>120 IBU</i></li>
<li>Midas Touch Golden Elixir: A beverage based on the residue found on the drinking vessels in King Midas' tomb. (Truly tasty stuff!!!)</li>
<li>WorldWide Stout: <b><i>23.04 % ABV for 2002</i></b> (no, that's not a misprint.)</li>
</ul>
If that's not enough, Dogfish Head has diversified into <a href="http://www.dogfish.com/spirits.cfm">distilling spirits</a> at the brewpub on the beach:
<ul>
<li>Brown Honey Rum: A double-distilled, amber rum aged on American oak and wildflower honey. Dark and smooth, this rum has a subtle woody character from the oak aging and a touch of sweetness derived from the honey.</li>
<li>Wit Rhum: A triple-distilled white rum aged on Curacao orange peel and coriander. A refreshing citrus rum that starts with a note of spiciness and ends with a refreshing citrus character.</li>
<li>White Light Rum: A more traditional un-spiced rum. Triple distilled and incorporating the same pot-still method as our other rums. The character of the high-quality molasses we use shines through in this rum.</li>
<li>(there's also a Vodka and a Gin in the mix, too.)
</ul>
At this point, some form of whiskey can't be too far behind....</p>

Nice to see someone else knows about Dogfish. This among other small subtleties is what kept me living in Delaware long after I left the company I moved down here to work for.<br> <br>Their Shelter Pale ale is decidedly my favorite, despite heady competition from the Raison D'Etre and Indian Brown Ale. Immort Ale (which must be drunk solo, as in 'don't drink anything else first,  or it will change the taste of it') is almost like three Shelter Pale's in one bottle, and is delicious provided you start with a fresh palate.<br> <br>It's relatively expensive, but that keeps the sales to a tolerable level and lets Dogfish spend more time doing what they like -- brewing some *excellent* ales, instead of stamping out cookie-cutter ales like what happened to the Yngling company.<br> <br>Dogfish rules. I *so* want to do a television commercial for them.. I've got it all written out in my head, and it would go over beautifully in this area of DE/PA/MD due to certain cultural phenomena in this area. (about which I shall hint no further lest I give the thing away)<br> <br>I'm half tempted to start Dogfishpal.com as a paypal clone<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)
