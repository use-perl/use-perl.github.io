<p><p>
There are (at least) two <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shibboleth">shibboleths</a> in the realm of Perl: <a href="http://dev.perl.org/perl6/talks/2000/als/larry-als.txt">manipulexity</a> and <a href="http://dev.perl.org/perl6/talks/2000/als/larry-als.txt">whipuptitude</a>.  If you understand the meaning (and value) of these concepts, you're one of us.  If you can't, you're not.
</p><p>
These terms were coined by Larry, and woven into his presentation at the Atlanta Linux Showcase, <a href="http://dev.perl.org/perl6/talks/2000/als/">Camel Lot #6</a>.  Larry presented this talk in October 2000, shortly after the Perl6 announcement, and it describes some of his early thoughts on Perl6.
</p><p>
<b>Manipulexity</b> is the property where, starting from zero and a couple of simple tools and slowly hand-craft a complex solution to a complex problem.  Like programming in C.  Your tools are <tt>cc</tt>, <tt>libc</tt> and other C libraries.
</p><p>
<b>Whipuptitude</b> is the property where, starting from zero with a large library of easily combined tools, you quickly hack a solution to a moderately simple, but annoyingly tedious problem that occurs frequently.  Like writing a shell script.  Your tools are <tt>sh</tt> / <tt>ksh</tt> / <tt>bash</tt> / <tt>csh</tt>, <tt>sort</tt>, <tt>grep</tt>, <tt>sed</tt>, <tt>awk</tt>, <tt>ps</tt> and so on.
</p><p>
If you plot manipulexity on the vertical axis and whipuptitude on the horizontal axis, there is a great void in the middle through the upper right -- problems that need high whipuptitude (easier to write than C), and high manipulexity (more complexity than you can tolerate in a shell script).  Perl was designed to hit this sweet spot.  Perl6 is targeted at expanding Perl's scope within this sweet spot -- more manipulexity and more whipuptitude than we have today.
</p><p>
I went googling for these terms earlier today.  Google didn't find much, and didn't know where these terms came from (or what they mean).  I found a <a href="http://dev.perl.org/perl6/talks/2000/als/">source</a> for these terms, along with <a href="http://dev.perl.org/perl6/talks/2000/als/talk.html">slides</a>, a <a href="http://dev.perl.org/perl6/talks/2000/als/larry-als.txt">transcription</a> and <a href="http://blob.perl.org/dev.perl.org/perl6/talks/2000/larry-als.mp3">MP3</a> of the presentation.
</p><p>
Maybe next time it'll find something.  ;-)
</p></p>

Which spelling did you use - the (correct) spelling in the title or the (incorrect) spelling used twice in the body of your article?  Manuplexity would refer to being able to use your hands in a complicated way, perhaps involved a large amount of waving (which might leave the watcher/listener perplexed).

D'Oh!  Fixed, thanks.

Jon Harrop has a nice language comparison of performance vs. conciseness:<br><br><a href="http://www.ffconsultancy.com/free/ray_tracer/languages.html" title="ffconsultancy.com">http://www.ffconsultancy.com/free/ray_tracer/languages.html</a ffconsultancy.com><br><br>Note that there's no Perl involved, though -- the relevant package would be PDL, I guess.
