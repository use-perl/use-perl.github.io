<p>We got a report-for-jury-duty notice in the mail.  On the back is a series of checklists to determine if you are qualified or unqualified for jury duty (e.g., don't bother showing up if you aren't a US citizen, a convict, too old, or hear voices in your head).
<p>
And this interesting qualification:
<blockquote>
DISQUALIFIED: I AM NOT QUALIFIED TO SERVE AS A JUROR BECAUSE:
<p>
______ I am unable to read, write, speak or understand the English Language.
</blockquote>
Um, yeah.  That trumps the classic: <i>Keyboard Error: No keyboard Present.  Press F1 to continue.</i></p>

Someone who cannot read/write/communicate in English who lives in our society will noneteless receive mail written in English.<br> <br>They will deal with it somehow - usually by having someone else read it for them, telling them of the content (in their own language), and writing any reply for them (translating the reply into English).<br> <br>The keyboard message "Press F1 to continue" is worse.  It communicates an action request while knowing that the recipient does not have the means to implement it.  With the "no speak English" case, by the time the message is transmitted to the recipient, they already have the means to respond too and it is no longer self-invalidating.

spoken like a true english speaker. It says,essentially, "Hey, motherfuker, move back to fuckall wherever you came from if you can't read this". Move to a country like Finland where you have no hope of understanding anything in the least for months if not years, even after you pay taxes, and you might have a fucking clue. Until then, you don't have even the slightest.  The same thing happens in every language. It's galling and humiliating at best.

Um, I don't see much point in trying to accept a person who cannot understand English to be a juror in a trial that will be carried out in English.  Without adding enough extra information to voting registration to cause significant privacy concerns, I don't see how the jury selection people could hope to write their letter in the recipient's native language.  So, they write in the language they they need for a useful response, and that 95% of the population understands.  (Perhaps the notice that the original poster received also had a Spanish translation, that would depend upon which part of the U.S. it happened in; jury notices here in my part of Canada are written in English and French, but not in Finnish, Hindu, Arabic, or<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...)  I was addressing the specific situation that was posted, not a generic world situation.<br> <br>I don't really understand your point, actually.  It sounds like you're upset that the Finns speak to you in Finnish instead of English - which fits the mold of &lt;sarcasm&gt; true English speaker &lt;/sarcasm&gt;.  I'm pretty sure you knew that you would be encountering this problem before you chose to move to Finland, perhaps it is worse than you originally expected.  Good luck with improving your Finnish to the point where this is no longer a problem - with my "ability" at learning human languages, I don't envy you that opportunity.

<p>
For most of the English speakers here who can't even read Finnish well enough to order basic foods from a menu, reading 'Min&#228; en ymm&#228;rrt&#228; suomea' from a government mailing is very unlikely. Of course, Swedish is also the second language but, yes, for English speakers, especially from the US where language education barely gets by for the primary language, most tend to take English for granted. It's not just the jury cards, everything is in English.
</p>
<p>
Why would I be upset at the Finns speaking Finnish to me? I do, afterall, live in Finland where the language is Finnish and I don't want to be like most of the 10+ year expats here who still can't read a menu. It's just very difficult, tiring and,  well, not English.

Huh?  Just because the PC didn't detect a keyboard doesn't mean <i>there is</i> no keyboard.  It may simply be that the connector was a little loose, or something.

Yes, I overstated it a bit.  But what proportion of the time when the "Press F1..." message comes along will the reader actually be able to usefully press F1.  Now compare that to the proportion of the time that a jury selection letter goes to a non-English speaker who is nonetheless able to return the later having checked the box that admits being incapable of working in English.  So, does this second situation "trump" the first (as an example of oxymoronic catch-22 speak)?
