  Dear PayPal user,
<p>
  We recently reviewed your account, and suspect that your PayPal account may
  have been accessed by an unauthorized third party. Protecting the security
  of your account and of the PayPal network is our primary concern.
  Therefore, as a prevention measure, we have temporarely limited access to
  sensitive PayPal account features.
  Please click on the link below to confirm your information:
<p>

<p>
  For more information about how to protect your account, please visit
  PayPal's Security Center, accessible via the "Security Center" link located
  at the bottom of each page of the PayPal website.
<p>
  We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause, and appreciate your
  assistance in helping us maintain the integrity of the entire PayPal
  system. Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.
<p>
  Sincerely,
<p>
  The PayPal Fraud Management Team

Let's see.  My PayPal account has been hacked, even though <b>I never opened a PayPal account</b>.  What's going on here?
<p>
This message is oozing scammyness, but the scammer covered his tracks better than most.    The SMTP from header and all the email addresses look legit.  Once I bothered to actually <i>read</i> this spam, it looked every so slightly off (<i>temporarely</i>? Please).  Mostly, it looked like it was cribbed from a real PayPal email, munged, and resent as a scam.
<p>
The really cruel bit of social engineering is the URL listed above.  It looks like it's going to go to a secure page on the PayPal site, but it is actually a link to an insecure page behind some cable modem somewhere in Canada.
<p>
This is a guy I would like to see persecuted to the fullest extent of the law....</p>

<h2>Paypal?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/pjm/">pjm</a> on 2004-05-12T01:14:11</h3>
The paypal site has a section about these things: in particular...<br/><br/>"If you think that you have received a fraudulent email (or fake website), please forward the email (or URL address) to spoof@paypal.com and then delete the email from your mailbox."

Thanks.  I don't deal with paypal, so I didn't know if/where they were accepting reports of these messages.

The bot at spoof@paypal.com has a very quick, very courteous autoresponse:
<blockquote><div> <tt>
Thank you for bringing this suspicious email to our attention. We
can confirm that the email you received; was not sent to you by
PayPal. The website linked to this email is not a registered URL
authorized or used by PayPal. We are currently investigating this
incident fully. Please do not enter any personal or financial
information into this website.

On the other hand, I receive e-gold phishing attempts every couple of days, and the one time I forwarded one to e-gold they replied that they got enough reports and I didn't need to forward any in the future. I don't have an e-gold account, but if I did I'd be concerned about their lack of interest in shutting down scammers.

<h2>PayPal will always use your name</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/brian_d_foy/">brian_d_foy</a> on 2004-05-12T05:15:23</h3>
Legitimate email from PayPal will always use your name, by the way.  Instead of "PayPal user", they will say "Dick Grasso", for instance.<br> <br>I use to think that particular policy was wierd, but now I understand.
