<div class="span8">
<p>Fact: Microsoft is a monopoly.<br>
Fact: Microsoft has abused it's monopoly power in the computer industry.<br>
Fact: Being a monopoly isn't illegal.<br>
Fact: Abusing monopoly power <i>is</i> illegal.<br>
Fact: This has been SOP for over a decade.<br>
Fact: This isn't news; anti-trust suits just take a long time to work themselves out.<br>
Fact: No one knows how to remedy the situation.<br>
Fact: Forcing Microsoft to pay a trillion dollars to put Windows Pee Cees in classrooms <b>looks</b> like a remedy, but actually is an extension of Microsoft's monopoly (at the expense of Apple).<br>
Fact: That proposed remedy was a complete joke.<br>
Fact: It's sad that 9 out of 18 states and the US Department of Justice thought that joke of a settlement offer was the best they could do.<br>
Fact: Even after it was proven that Microsoft is an abusive monopoly power, <a href="http://www.palminfocenter.com/view_Story.asp?ID=3233">more evidence</a> <a href="http://www.beincorporated.com/press/pressreleases/02-02-19_msft_complaint.html">keeps surfacing</a> about how the company <a href="http://news.com.com/2100-1001-871120.html">blatantly continues their abuses</a> <i>even while penalty negotiations are under way!</i>
<p>
These kind of strong-arm business tactics sound <a href="http://www.hbo.com/sopranos/">suspiciously familar</a>.  The important differences I see between Microsoft and the Soprano family are that:
<ul>
<li>The Sopranos are fictional</li>
<li>Microsoft doesn't resort to capital crimes to enforce their business plans</li>
<li>Microsoft doesn't send a member of the inner circle to "feed the fishes" at the end of every season</li>
<li>Microsoft doesn't deal in illegal merchandise, per se</li>
</ul></p>
