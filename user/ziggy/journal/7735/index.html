<p>I've been on the Erma Bombeck diet for just over a decade now.  It's a basic calorie counting diet, with a twist of Erma's wit on top.  I've long since lost the original column; this is from memory:
<ul>
<li>Figure out what your basic caloric intake should be.  You want to eat that many calories (or fewer) per day.  And don't forget to exercise.</li>
<li>Anything you eat while cooking doesn't count.  That's just tasting.</li>
<li>Anything you eat off of someone else's plate doesn't count.  That's just redistribution of food.</li>
<li>Anything you eat standing up doesn't count.  Civilized people eat sitting down at the table.  If you're not sitting down at a table, then you're obviously not eating, so those calories don't count.</li>
<li>Anything you eat between meals doesn't count.</li>
<li>Anything you eat at a party doesn't count.  Why?  Because it's a party!</li>
<li>Anything you eat at a restaurant doesn't count.  It's a special occasion, and close enough to a party to fall under the rule about parties.</li>
<li>Anything you drink doesn't count.  That's drinking, not eating.</li>
</ul></p>
