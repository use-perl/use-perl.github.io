<p>From the <a href="http://www.hp.com/hpinfo/newsroom/press/07may02b.htm">HP White Paper</a> detaling the roadmap and merger plans for the combined HP, Compaq and previously purchased brands:
<blockquote><i>
HP also will deliver on the previously announced Compaq OpenVMSÃ¢âÂ¢ roadmap, including the port to Itanium.
</i></blockquote>
OSF/1<tt>^W</tt>DEC UNIX<tt>^W^W</tt>Tru64 will soon go the way of all flesh, with the interesting features shoehorned into HP/UX.</p>

<h2>They tossed the wrong Unix!</h2>

I'm glad they kept VMS. Not that they had much choice--Compaq's got 18 or so years worth of commitment to the US Government, and they do tend to get cranky about stuff going away. Plus the multi-billion dollar yearly revenue stream with no competition isn't anything to sneeze at.<br> <br>But... Tossing Tru64? For <i>HP/UX</i>? What were they thinking?<br> <br>Ah, well, that's a blow in VMS's favor. They just killed off the only Unix that had anything like VMS's administration, security, and clusterability.

<p>well...from what I understand it's not as simple as Tru64 being tossed in favour of HP-UX. HPQ is heading full guns into a service type of organisation so even if this drives more people to Solaris as I expect it will, HPQ will be prepared to sell you support. All I know is that a large number of people, in the neighbourhood of 30,000, will be found redundant. I just don't see how 2 large beasts made into one gigantic beast is going to make for better products.</p>

<p>The wannabe PHB in my office is thrilled at this merger since he sees it as his big chance to crawl the corporate ladder...</p>
