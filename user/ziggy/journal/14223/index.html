Ernie Ball strings rock.  I never would have guessed the company had a CEO, much less a IT department.  I wonder if D'Addario is pro-microsoft?  I need more meta-criteria for choosing my strings ("Dude!  The strings sound so much <b>warmer</b>, man.")



<h2>String tone</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/WebDragon/">WebDragon</a> on 2003-08-21T16:49:30</h3>
Personally I prefer the sound of Washburn Slicks for my Takamine C-132S acoustic.<br> <br>I'm currently trying one of those sets that cost about $14.99 instead of $7 and that have some sort of space-age coating on them to preserve the string's tone and life. This was decided after I had a G-string break on me at the TUNING PEG, roughly one week after buying the set.<br> <br>I regularly tune the G string up a whole step to A as part of an alternate tuning I use. Normally I detune the whole guitar a whole-step and then use a capo on it to lengthen the string life, but this was ridiculous.<br> <br>I wish the washburn strings weren't so darn hard to find at local dealers that I have to custom order 'em when I want them.

I use Martin strings on my Martin guitar.  But maybe I'll switch to Ernie Balls for my electric, once I rebuild it.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

I suppose with a name like that it was almost inevitable that he'd wind up butting heads with Microsoft just so people like me could make a pun about him having the Balls to leave the bleating flock of Microsoft toadies that have been stringing him along, and try an alternate operating system. It's just too bad Microsoft hasn't taken the hint to try singing a different tune yet.<br> <br>
