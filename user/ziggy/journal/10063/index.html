<p>brian <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/brian_d_foy/journal/10061">wrote</a> a treatise on things to consider when naming files.  Like everyone else, I have a method to naming the files I create on my hard drive.  Of course, I don't always follow it, and I tend to create a new "naming scheme" every few months (or computers).
<p>
One thing that I <i>do</i> try to do with regularity is find appropriate names for the MIME attachments I send in email.  A recruiter friend told me a while ago how she deals with her email.  The quickest way to get her to ignore you is to send an email with a resume attached called "resume.doc" or "resume.html".  When someone receives hundreds of resumes per day, the time that it takes to rename an attachment is precious, and if there's no stunningly good reason to open/save your resume, it'll be in the trash can before you know it.</p>

Interesting.  Getting my resume noticed by recruiter and HR types is unfortunately a topic that's near and dear to my heart these days.
</p><p>
What does she recommend?  Something like "resume.firstname_lastname.txt"?</p>

</i> </div></blockquote>
Actually, I think she recommends something like "firstname_lastname[_resume].{txt|html|doc}".  Getting the person's name in the filename is the most critical point.  Chances are a good recruiter / HR type will be dealing with resumes already, so the _resume part is likely redundant.
<p>
However, it's misleading of me to neglect the most important point of getting a cold resume noticed: a good subject line that's concise.  Adding a personal referral in the subject is also worth way more than 20 extra points at UMich.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>

Yes, if I had a dollar for every <i>proposal.doc</i> that passed through the O'Reilly proposals alias, I'd be a rich man.<p>

Funnny how one never thinks of these things when you're the one <i>sending</i> the attachments.  Now I'm worried that I'm doing lots of other seemingly innocent things that are pissing off potention employers...
<p>
Sigh.
