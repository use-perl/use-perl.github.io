<p><a href="http://www.askbjoernhansen.com/">Ask</a> has weighed in on the <i>Cult of Dave Winer</i> issue.  Ask is among the many who considers Dave to be <a href="http://www.askbjoernhansen.com/archives/2002/08/18/000106.html">an idiot.</a>  One minor (and admittedly beneath-the-belt) datapoint: No one bothered to sign Dave's <a href="http://photo.perl.org/oscon/2002/Ask/day5|oscon/2002/Ask/day5/dsc_1871.jpg">get well board</a> at OSCon.  (That photo is from the afternoon of Day 5, IIRC.  The board had been up since at least Wednesday.)</p>

Actually, later in the day a few people did sign it.  But why take a photo of that.  =)

  Glad to hear about that... even though I dislike DW, I have been resisting trying to bring up that admittedly below-the-belt fact which I happened to notice as well. At least now I'll have an extra reason to resist<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)

Honestly, the board was pointed out to me (with chuckles, apparently), but I didn't know who Dave Winer is, and even how much or little sick he is.
<p>After Googling, I'm still not sure. {grin}  He apparently has something to do with Frontier, which I've never paid much attention.
Can someone explain the "joke" of the board to me?</p>

It's a variant of that old (allegedly) German joke, &laquo;<i>What if there was a war, but no one showed up?</i>&raquo;
<p>
In this case, it was &laquo;<i>What if there was a get well card for an Internet Icon(tm) like Dave Winer, and it was set up for everyone to sign, but no one signed it?</i>&raquo;</p>
