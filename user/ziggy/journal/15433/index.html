<p>Samuel Caughron of Proteron LLC (creators of the fabulous <a href="http://www.proteron.com/liteswitchx/">LiteSwitch X</a>) wrote an <a href="http://www.proteron.com/liteswitchx/openmemo.php">angry open memo</a>, saying that Apple included a basically copied LiteSwitch X and included it as a base feature in Panther.  Among other things, Sam accuses Apple of usurping features and entire products from 3rd party Mac OS X developers, and including them as part of the base OS (much like it did with Sherlock/Watson).
<p>
Today, Kevin Fox posted a <a href="http://fury.com/article/1872.php">rather scathing response</a> to the Proteron memo:
<blockquote><i>
Your open memo is based on the claim, reiterated on the LiteSwitch X home page, that "LiteSwitch X was the original application switcher for the Mac OS". This is both 'disappointing' and 'dishonest'. The first application switcher for the Mac OS was "Switcher" written by Andy Hertzfeld (with special thanks given to John Markoff and Bud Tribble) while under the employ of Apple Computer in 1985. Apple pioneered the technology you're claiming they pilfered, and they did it when the Mac OS was barely one year old. Over the intervening 18 years countless "little guys," Proteron among them, have come out with application switchers building on Apple's foundation. Surprisingly, very few gave any credit to Andy, John, Bud or Apple for the original innovation.
</i></blockquote>
Um, yeah.</p>

Man, Apple is my favorite cult ever! All who sin are roundly rejoined for being a disappointment for Bud.  True apostasy gets one a STRONGLY WORDED EMAIL that Steve started crying and had to go home!!



<h2>Watson</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/pudge/">pudge</a> on 2003-10-29T22:44:24</h3>
Apple didn't steal from Watson, either.  The primary claims of theft center around two things: the overall UI and the style of using screen scrapings and web services in a more custom manner for each site.  The former was primarily of Apple/NeXT design to begin with, and the latter has been done before in various ways and was the most logical evolution of Sherlock, whether Watson existed or not.  People had already been attempting to do more custom forms with Sherlock/Sherlock 2, which is probably what gave Karelia the idea for Watson in the first place.<br> <br>Originality is HARD!
