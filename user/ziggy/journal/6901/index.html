<div class="span8">
<p>It's been a little over a month since we got our iBook.  (I think Jesse Vincent mentioned that once you get an iBook, either you need to get another one, or you need to get a divorce.  He's right.)
<p>
I liked it so much, I did an impromptu Perl Lightning talk at OSCon.  My top ten reasons why Perl hackers should get an iBook:
<ol>
 <li>Perl's pre-installed</li>
 <li>It's UNIX</li>
 <li>Everything Just Works</li>
</ol>
As <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/Matts/">Matt</a> has been pointing out, iBooks and OS X aren't all happiness and joy.  There are a few problems with the things.  First off, there's <i>epileptic mouse syndrome</i> -- touching the overlarge trackpad with both thumbs at once.  Then there are lots of minor issues with the software -- alt+tab, HFS+ instead of a real filesystem (that is case sensitive), etc.
<p>
All in all, the experience has been a net positive.  I oversold iBooks and OS X in my mini-lightning talk (in retrospect, it came off less like a piece of humor than a really bad rehearsal for a Switch ad).  There are things that don't "just work" with OS X or the iBook.  Having used computers for <i>mumble</i> years though, it's the best working OS+Machine combination I've found to date.</p>

I just discovered <a href="http://camelbones.sf.net/" title="sf.net">CamelBones</a sf.net>. Call me a pig in mud, but this is what GUI development with Perl should be like. Awesome.<br> <br>But yeah, I'm definitely on the good side of happy with it. It's a very nice OS, and aside from a few performance issues and my annoyance at Apple for charging for Jaguar (which is annoying if you've just bought an iBook and there's no decent upgrade price), I think I'll keep it<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)<br> <br>As far as your lightning talk goes, what doesn't "just work" is compiling and linking unix things. I'm really quite frustrated with all that crap now.

</i> </div></blockquote> There are two constants in the Mac community: a sense of near religious faith in the platform, and a near constant frustration with Apple.  I'm looking forward to Jaguar, and I'm not looking forward to the cost.  But as far as I can remember, Apple has never bent to the pleas of the Mac Faithful for free upgrades, reducing the announced price (before shipping the product), or any other concessions to the early adopters.  And the faithful clamor for this at every major product announcment. <p><blockquote><div> <i>

</i> </div></blockquote> Yeah, I glossed over a million details there.  OS X is unix under the hood, but a fluffy unix.<nobr> <wbr></nobr><tt>/etc</tt> is an unused appendage; HFS+ may have some interesting features, but case insensitivity is a serious drawback; and NetInfo sounds good in theory, but I still have yet to see the benefit on a single box installation. <p> I scratched my head a few times about <tt>-framework Carbon</tt> and <tt>-flat-namespace</tt>, too.  In the end, I decided that it was a problem for another day and peppered the options about until stuff compiled.  Seemed to work.</p>

Just compare compiling Perl 5.6.1 to compiling 5.8.0. Or worse, compare compiling PostgreSQL 7.0 to compiling 7.2. The latter just works. </p>

Yes, I'm looking forward to being able to upgrade to perl 5.8 so that more stuff "just works" - but right now the reason I was given the iBook was to get something working on it, so I need to make sure I do that without upgrading too much.<br> <br>Funny, so far use.perl has been an even better source of help than google for all this<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)

 <p> Oh, so do you have to use the default-installed Perl 5.6.0 and the DSO'd mod_perl with Apple's<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/usr/sbin/httpd? Yucko. </p>

Yeah, I guess I do - I haven't gotten to that part yet - just got XML::LibXSLT and DBD::SQLite working.

Uncle Tim (or possible Uncle Steve, given our tightness with Apple) will be buying my Jaguar.  But wouldn't it just be easier to pirate?  Isn't that the classic protest against price gouging? <p> <i>--Nat</i></p>

<tt> <br> Well, I'm all in favor of civil disobediance, but I feel like <br> I get my money's worth with the edu price, so not paying it is <br> just breaking the law because it's convenient, not because it's <br> the right thing to do. <br>  <br> If I felt otherwise, maybe I'd consider copying someone else's. <br>  <br> I've seen oodles of O'Reilly CD Bookshelves placed on the 'net, <br> and rather than download them, I've reported them to O'Reilly's <br> legal folks and paid for my own. I've even reported a accident <br> where safari was accidentally left entirely open on a test server <br> for anyone to download tons of texts. <br>  <br> If I felt like O'Reilly books were priced at "gouging level", <br> then maybe I'd be downloading them instead of paying. <br>  <br> Just because folks are used to a free (as in beer, never mind <br> the Free as in Freedom) OS, doesn't mean that every OS needs to <br> be free. If folks don't feel like Apple gives them their money's <br> worth, they can break the law and risk (a small risk, admitedly) <br> letting a judge decide the right of the situation, or they can <br> go back to their free OS and just not use Apple's. <br>  <br><nobr> <wbr></nobr>...or just don't upgrade if the upgrade isn't worth it to you. <br>  <br> Not buying a product is a perfectly legal protest against price <br> gouging. <br>  <br> My rule of thumb has been roughly "pirate if you just want to <br> see what the program does or use it only once or twice, but if <br> you ever make a dime of income from the product pay for it OR <br> feel like a asshole for taking food from the kids of whomever <br> wrote the software". I don't enjoy feeling like an asshole. Of <br> course not everyone uses that rule of thumb. I'm not trying to <br> call pirates assholes, I'm just saying that *I* feel like an <br> asshole when pirating under certain circumstances. <br>  <br> I make a dime of income from MacOS X. I make more than enough <br> dimes to pay for a license. Similarly, I make plenty of dimes <br> from O'Reilly books and have paid for fifty to sixty of them. <br>  <br> You wouldn't suggest that I just download them would you?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;) <br>  <br> -matt <br> </tt>
