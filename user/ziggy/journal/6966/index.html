<p>The DC Mayoral race is a bit of a joke at the moment.  (The office of Mayor in DC is a bit of a joke as well.)
<p>
The party primaries are coming up, and the incumbent mayor, Anthony Williams, can't seem to get his name on the ballot.  It started when the nominating petitions came in.  Only 2000 signatures from registered DC voters were necessary, but the Williams campaign came up with 10,000 signatures.
<p>
Then the fertilizer hit the ventilator.  
<p>
The campaign staffers knew and freely admitted that at least half of those signatures were forged or fabricated (there was a $1 bounty paid for each signature).  Now, there are other irregularities being noted, such as problems with the signatures of the people <i>submitting</i> the petitions not being OK for some reason.
<p>
The good Mayor was prevented from being listed on the party ballot, and lost his battle with the court of appeals.
<p>
His only recourse now is to mount a grass roots campaign to get his name written in on the ballot.

<i>What happened if there was an election, and no one was running for office?</i></p>
