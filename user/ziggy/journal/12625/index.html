<p>Can someone please tell me why Nissan licensed the first few mellow bars <i><a href="http://www.purelyrics.com/index.php?lyrics=zopgaauy">Heroin</a></i> as a backdrop for an Xterra ad?  The images are of a couple driving off road to go rock climbing in the middle of the night.  But as soon as anyone who knows the song hears those first few notes,  Lou Reed's singularly depressing imagery comes to mind:
<blockquote><i>
I have made the big decision<br>
I'm gonna try to nullify my life<br>
'Cause when the blood begins to flow<br>
When it shoots up the dropper's neck<br>
When I'm closing in on death<br>
And you can't help me now, you guys<br>
And all you sweet girls with all your sweet talk<br>
You can all go take a walk
</i></blockquote>
Um, yeah.  <i>Buy our car!  You can drive it off road and shoot smack where no one will <b>never</b> find you!</i></p>

<h2>Dude, I gotta get me that car!</h2>

<p>Finally!  A car that fits my existentialist lifestyle has arrived.  No longer shall I play the hypocrit driving my pollyannaish VW bug or my free-wheeling solara.  Now I can have a car that expresses the same value system as my all-black attire.  I hope the car only comes in black or charcoal.
</p><p>It <em>is</em> the end of the world and I <em>do</em> feel fine!</p>



<h2>IIRC</h2>

IIRC it was Nissan who also did a commercial for one of their coupes with Jethro Tull's "Thick as a Brick" in the background.<br> <br>The commercial played the song while the car drove through a Mediterranean(?) village while the villagers followed the car skipping gleefully. I wonder whether the song aimed at the driver or the villagers???<br> <br>I feel a lawsuit from the Small Anonymous Mediterranean Village Anti-Defamation League (or was that the People's Front of Small Anonymous Mediterranean Villages )

Ya know, I think you're right.  That campaign ended a few months ago.  It was for an SUV of some sort.
