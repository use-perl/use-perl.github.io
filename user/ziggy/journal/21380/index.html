<div class="span8">
<p>Last night, I was asked the strangest question:
<blockquote><i>
Are you gay?
</i></blockquote>
This, I should note, was asked by the woman I'll be marrying in less than two months.
<p>
To be fair, there are a few times when that question is not entirely out of line.  If, for example, you happened to be an exceptionally well-groomed <a href="http://www.wordspy.com/words/metrosexual.asp">metrosexual</a>, and someone mistakes you for a gay man.  Or if you know what's so funny about Homer Simpson citing the glory hole as one of the <a href="http://www.thesimpsonsquotes.com/characters/homer-simpson-quotes-19.html">greatest accomplishments of humanity</a>.  Or if you get one too many of the inside references in <a href="http://www.sho.com/site/queer/home.do">Queer as Folk</a>.   All hypothetically speaking, of course.
<p>
And then there's the old standby -- just because <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/5686618/">a man</a> is married, and fathered two children doesn't mean that he isn't gay.
<p>
That aside, the rest of the conversation went something like this:
<blockquote>
What would make you say that?
<p>
<i>Well, I saw you went browsing to this site -- <a href="http://www.lambda-the-ultimate.org/">Lambda the Ultimate</a></i>.
<p>
Yeah?  And?
<p>
<i>Well, isn't <a href="http://lambda.org/">Lambda</a> a symbol of the gay community?</i>
<p>
Lambda the Ultimate is about a <a href="http://www.lispworks.com/reference/HyperSpec/Body/s_lambda.htm">different Lambda</a>.
</blockquote></p>

<h2>Thanks!</h2>

Thank you for the best laugh I've had all night!  Too bad I can't share this with anyone.  All I'd get are blank stares.



<h2>Well?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/brev/">brev</a> on 2004-10-18T15:36:15</h3>
Are you?!<br> <br>p.s. Scheme makes you gay.



<h2>Lambda this, &amp;lambda; that</h2>

<p> Better she ask two months <strong>before</strong> than two months after.
I don't recommend anyone marry anyone they don't trust completely -- which includes trusting the beloved enough to tell the beloved everything. Being "Straight but not Narrow", I would not consider bisexuality a detriment to marriage<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... but I expect partners to know sooner as opposed to later -- and realize some might have other issues.
</p><p>
Anyway, congratulations on the impending nuptials. May this be your greatest misunderstanding for some time to come.
</p><p>
At least you've come out as a Functional Programmer publicly.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

</p><blockquote><div> <i>Lambda the Ultimate is about a different Lambda. </i> </div></blockquote>

<p>Well, it's the <strong>same</strong> Greek letter (symbol, glyph) <b>&lambda;</b>, just abbreviating and connoting a different concept. IIRC, &lambda; originally stood for LET in the lambda-calculus, although we have re-introducted LET as a subtlely different operator in Lispish dialects today. I can understand a non-geek non-greek being thrown by the website title<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... some non-geek non-straight friends of mine would probably be very disappointed if they clicked through that link.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)
</p><p>
Wishing you the best for your matrimonials</p>

<blockquote><div> <i>IIRC, &#955; originally stood for LET in the lambda-calculus</i> </div></blockquote><br/><br/>I don't think that is correct.  According to Peter Norvig, <i>Paradigms of Artificial Intelligence Programming</i>:<br/><br/><blockquote><div>
        The name <tt>lambda</tt> comes from the mathematician Alonzo Church's
        notation for functions (Church 1941).<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... Lambda derives from
        the notation in Russell and Whitehead's <tt>Principia
        Mathematica</tt>, which used a caret over bound variables...
        Church wanted a one-dimensional string, so he moved the caret
        in front... .  The caret looked funny with nothing below it,
        so Church switched to the closest thing, an uppercase
        lambda [&Lambda;].... The lambda was easily confused with [the logical and symbol],
        so eventually the lowercase lambda was substituted... . John
        McCarthy was a student of Church's at Princeton, so when
        McCarthy invented Lisp in 1958, he adopted the lambda
        notation.<br/><br/>
