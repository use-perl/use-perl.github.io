<p>I first heard about WROX going out of business via the xsl-list.  I found that rather surprising, since they seem to have cornered the market on getting a book on the shelves as quickly and as cheaply as humanly possible.
<p>
The denizens of the xsl-list are noticably worried, because some of the best books on XSLT were published by WROX.  Michael Kay's first edition of the <i>XSLT Programmers Reference</i> was the only first-generation XSLT book that didn't totally suck to the point of worthlessness.  I've heard that his second edition is much better.  One of Jeni Tennison's titles was also published by WROX.  And now a lot of people are worried about the future of those books.
<p>
Today, I found out (via the xsl-list, natch) that Wiley has bought up most of the WROX catalog, and APress has purchased the rest.  That's certainly good news, at least for the few good titles that were in the catalog to start with...</p>

<h2>Wrox/Wiley/Apress</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/petdance/">petdance</a> on 2003-05-09T22:34:41</h3>
I believe that Wiley has only bought about 20 of the Wrox titles.  Apress has, indeed, bought the rest.
