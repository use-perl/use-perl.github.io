<p>The Late Great Douglas Adams penned <a href="http://www.douglasadams.com/dna/980707-00-a.html">a wonderful essay</a> in about 1989 or so about the trials and tribulations of using computers.
<blockquote><i>
All I want to do is print from my portable. (Poor baby). That isn't all I                  want in fact. I want to be able regularly to transfer my address book                  and diary stacks backwards and forwards between my portable and                  my IIx. And all my current half-finished chapters. And anything else                  I'm tinkering with which is the reason why my half-finished chapters                  are half-finished. In other words I want my portable to appear on the                  desktop of my IIx. I don't want to have to do battle with cupboard                  monsters and then mess about with TOPS every time I want that to                  happen. I'll tell you all I want to have to do in order to get my                  portable to appear on the Desktop of my IIx.
<p>
I just want to carry it into the same room. 
<p>
Bang. There it is. It's on the Desktop.
</i></blockquote>
Remembering what Macs (and PCs) were like in the late 1980s, I can't imagine how anyone ever accused them of being easy to use...
<p>
Looking on the brighter side, it's easy to forget how good we have it today.  </p>
