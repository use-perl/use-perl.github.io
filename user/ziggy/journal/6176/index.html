<p><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/world/americas/newsid_2089000/2089110.stm">From the BBC</a>:
<blockquote>
A group demanding voting rights for Washington DC is to mark America's Independence Day by asking Queen Elizabeth to place the US capital under British rule. 
</blockquote>
A couple of the local DC evening news programs had footage of the story, but none of the DC news outlets had anything on the web about it yesterday.  Interesting.</p>

As you know, I was there, and it seems to have been a successful publicity effort (not that anything will actually come of it).  There's another story at <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,56910,00.html" title="foxnews.com">Fox News</a foxnews.com> and a bad one at <a href="http://www.ananova.com/news/story/sm_621623.html" title="ananova.com">Ananova</a ananova.com> (focusing on the reunification idea rather than the <a href="http://www.dcvote.org/" title="dcvote.org">taxation without representation</a dcvote.org>, which is the real point).<br> <br> <i>The Washington Post</i> ignored us, as usual, but did print a <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A22217-2002Jul3.html" title="washingtonpost.com">letter to the editor</a washingtonpost.com> by DC Vote's executive director.

My position is that the city of Washington should be ceded back to the state of Maryland, just as the section on the other side of the river was ceded back to Virginia.<br> <br>I know this idea would be extremely unpopular, both in the city and in Maryland, but it would solve a <b>whole lakh</b> of problems.  In fact, it would solve <i>all</i> the problems.<br> <br>Critics (from other states) might argue that it gives an unfair advantage to Maryland... but the simple fact is that Maryland (and Virginia) already enjoy these advantages.  Nothing would change.  Well, the state would see a lot more tax revenue, but that would be offset -- <i>more</i> than offset -- by the burder (or rather, sinkhole) which is the District.  So, while other states would see an unfair advantage, Maryland would see an unfair disadvantage.  Sounds like a plan to me!<br> <br>
