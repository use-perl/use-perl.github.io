<p>Time to buy some more memory for my desktop computer.  When I bought it about 2 years ago, 128MB was a reasonable amount of RAM.  Lately, I've been noticing (thanks to wmmon) that I'm maxing out my RAM (a good thing) and starting to hit swap more and more (not necessarily a good thing).
<p>
Why?  Well, with Mozilla's tabbed browsing, I find that I keep more web pages open.  I just counted 4 Mozilla windows currently opened holding about 50 different tabs between them (some of those tabs have probably been open since Monday or Tuesday).  I used to keep a whole bunch of Konqueror windows opened at once, but the system would get a little sluggish with about 30 pages opened (so I'd spend more time reading, instead of noting "I want to read this later, when I have some more time").</p>

But do you ever find the time to actually read the pages?<br> <br>I've got a file containing hundreds, perhaps thousands, of URLs. I intend to read them all, but I suspect a fair number of them are 404s now. Darnit.<br> <br>42 hours in a day. That's what's needed. And only having to use 24 of them as we do presently. The rest to do with as one will.

Eventually.  Typically I'll take about 15 minutes and scan through a buttload of unread pages for interesting tidbits, and log the URLs somewhere so I can find it again, hopefully.

Unless Mozilla crashes, that is.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>

Hmm. I'm thinking some degree of automation would be useful. A browser feature explicitly for "I'll read that later". And when you do load the page, it just vanishes from the list (or is marked as read or something). Almost, but not quite entirely, like bookmarks.<br> <br>It's just to make sure the URLs are logged somewhere in event of a crash =)
