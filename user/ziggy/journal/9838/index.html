<p>I tried using iCal when it was originally released in September, but quickly stopped using it because it was so painfully slow.  There seemed to be some memory leak involved as well - quitting and restarting would free up some memory and speed it up.  It was a nice idea, but definately beta software.
<p>
I took another look at it last week when iCal 1.0.1 was released.  Looking back yesterday, I see that it's been almost silently upgraded to 1.0.2.  It's very much the same application, but the performance is light years better now.
<p>
Other changes since it's beta release in September: Apple now offers an iCal library at <a href="http://www.apple.com/ical/library"> http://www.apple.com/ical/library </a>.  These kinds of calendars and calendar sharing sites popped up like fungi after it was released.  I like that Apple is making it much easier to find calendars to subscribe to.  Other interesting calendars can be found at <a href="http://www.icalshare.com">iCalShare</a>, like <a href="http://ical.mac.com/mokolabs/Tour32de32France.ics">the 2003 Tour de France Calendar</a>.  (usePerl isn't friendly to webcal:// URLs at the moment...)</p>

Apple had that library of shared calendars from Day One of iCal, before anyone else did.  But since Apple didn't see fit to make NHL calendars (in addition to NBA and NFL), no one cared.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)

Really?  I remember looking around for the standard calendars (Holidays, etc.) when iCal came out.  The first (only?) place I found was icalshare.  Maybe my memory is fuzzy, or I never bothered looking at Apple's site...
