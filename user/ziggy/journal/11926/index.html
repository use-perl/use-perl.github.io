<p>Will <a href="http://news.com.com/2100-1029-998888.html?tag=fd_top">Virginia's new anti-spam law</a> help cut down on spam?
<blockquote><i>
The new statute adds criminal penalties for fraudulent, high-volume spammers. It outlaws practices such as forging the return address line of an e-mail message or hacking a computer to send spam surreptitiously. Those found guilty of sending more than 10,000 such deceptive e-mail messages in one day would be subject to a prison term of one to five years and forfeiture of profits and assets connected with these activities.
<p>
...
<p>
Virginia Gov. Mark R. Warner said the new law could have a significant effect on spam because half of all Internet traffic flows through the state. The passage of e-mail through Virginia-based Internet service providers, he said, gives state prosecutors the ability to reach the purveyors of spam in other states and jurisdictions, noting that an earlier, weaker state anti-spam law had survived constitutional challenges.
</i></blockquote>
Sadly, I don't think this will work.  Virginia might get some high profile prosecutions, but many cases to be tied up with issues of juristdiction <i>within</i> the US.  Imagine extraditing someone from Kreplachistan for "spamming".
<p>
Given the scale of the problem (spam is currently about 45% of the mail received by AOL; nearly 2 <b>billion</b> messages/day this week), costs of prosecution will quickly outstrip economic benefit to the state.</p>

Too bad spammers don't have as much money as <a href="http://www.philipmorrisinternational.com/" title="philipmorr...tional.com">Phillip Morris</a philipmorr...tional.com>. I guess it would help if it could be medically proven that spam could kill<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-) Spam is certainly raising the blood pressure of our networks. 45% is too much, and it was a lot less than that just a few years ago if memory serves. Hopefully <a href="http://foldoc.doc.ic.ac.uk/foldoc/foldoc.cgi?query=moore's+law&amp;action=Search" title="ic.ac.uk">Moore's Law</a ic.ac.uk> doesn't apply to spam, or else we'll soon be out of bandwidth.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

There's a spam conference in DC this week, and the issue is all over the local talk radio airwaves.  The stats I remember hearing are that roughly 45% of all email is spam now, vs. 8% in 2000.  AOL hit the 1 billion spams/day mark 8 weeks ago, and they're about to reach 2 billion spams/day any day now.
