<p><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/02/08/VisualStudioforApplications/print.asp">Here's</a> an article about &laquo;<i>Visual Studio for Applications</i>&raquo;.  It's a generic environment you can use in your program to make it scriptable using any language supported by VSA (e.g. VB.NET, JS.NET).
<p>
The article starts out marvelling at how amazing DOOM was, and especially because an MS-DOS program can run on this week's build of WinNT[1].  One of the problems the author highlights is that the scripting framework for the various releases of DOOM changed with each release, including the &laquo;scripting language&raquo; needed to tweak the engine.  Oh, and it was interpreted; we all know how <i>horriby bad</i> it is to have an interpreted language these days.  Only slackers avoid the trivial amount of work to compile a &laquo;scripting language&raquo; down to native code, after all...
<P>
So, what example does this article use to demonstrate the benefits of VSA?  A little application that controls four independant clocks with second hands.  We all know how performance critical a clock is, and how it's completely unfathomable to get enough performance out of a &laquo;scripting language&raquo; on a modern 1+ GHz system to update four second hands once per second...
<p>
There is something of value here.  I'm sure of it.  But I'm not sure what it is  though.
<p>
[1] The intro was written like it had to fill a few obligatory story elements.
<ol>
<li>start with a trivial, fun opening</li>
<li>mention as many Microsoft products as possible in the first page, ideally two per sentence in the first section, one per sentence after that, and one per paragraph once the code starts</li>
<li>tangentially link a perceived problem in a 3rd party product and a Microsoft solution to that perceived problem</li>
<li>Stress performance at all costs</li>
</ol>
The body of the article then aims to describe the twisty, turny passages that must be navigated to use this highly performant Microsoft solution.</p>
