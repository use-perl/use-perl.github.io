<p><i>Oh, the weather outside is frightful! <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/mmedia/webcams/snowcam.htm">This image</a>, taken inside the Capital Beltway, shows an unofficial measurement of accumulated snowfall, in inches.</i><br/><br/>DC is being blanketed in an early winter snowstorm.  By the time it all ends, we should be covered in 4-5" of snow.  If the bad weather continues like this, the US Federal Government may close down for the rest of the week!<br/><br/>(Do not pay attention to the ruler in that photo.  Although it shows a whopping 1/8" of accumulation, the drifts are big enough to cover a Tic Tac, or possibly even an Altoid!)<br/><br/><b>Update, 5pm</b>: Now that it's after sunset, it's easier to see how much accumulation is on the ground without the harsh glare of the sun.  Current total: about 1mm on the ground.<br/><br/><b>Update, 7pm</b>: I almost didn't make it home tonight.  It took a whopping 60 seconds to clean off my car in the parking lot.  Surely, all of the local supermarkets are cleared out of the staples, like milk and bread.  If the weather keeps up like this, we may need FEMA to assist us.<br/><br/><b>Update, 9pm</b>: According to the Post's yardstick, we've lost 3mm of accumulation.  Current total is now at -2mm.  I smell a total Federal Government Shutdown coming...</p>

<p>For DC it would be great to have an alternating background to the ruler + snow, indicating the different levels of hysteria based on the amount of snowfall. At 1 inch you could have cars smashing into each other; at 2 you could have a derailed metro; by 6+ inches you could photoshop in a scene from Dawn of the Dead or something...</p>

At around 8 inches or so, you could have a photo of the Hindenberg going down in flames with a superimposed Charles Manson in the foreground, as if he were reporting on the situation to some time-traveling news organization.
<p>
Time-traveling news organization...oooh, I have a great idea now!  I'm going to start TCNN -- Temporal Cable News Network.  "The day's news...on every day simultaneously."</p>
