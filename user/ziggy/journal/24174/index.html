<p>Today, my wife spoke at a CIO conference in <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=solomons,md&hl=en">Solomons Island</a> (the one on the Chesapeake, not in the South Pacific).  Along with a couple of bags, countless pens and various forms of caffeinated mints from vendors plying their wares to the gubment was a thumb drive from the organizers containing all of the presentations.
<p>
How utterly <i>useful</i>!  There's even a <a href="http://www.customusb.com/">company</a> that'll drop the files on the drives and put a logo on them, too.
<p>
And here's the utterly cool part.  If you couldn't find your presentation, just dig into your swag bag and pop the thumb drive into whatever computer you're presenting from.  Is that convenient or what?</p>

...that your wife lost her presentation?<p>
Dell was giving out thumb-drives with PPT shows (why use genuine Dell memory, or some such), I thought it was pretty cool.  16MB, but cool.  I got an empty one from Google (32MB, but no presentation).</p>

Nope.  She had about three copies with her, including a CD we burned the night before.  But if anyone else had lost their presentation, it's cool that not only is it available with all of the swag, but it's available on the <i>cool</i> swag, not the stuff that you automatically throw out or use as coasters.
