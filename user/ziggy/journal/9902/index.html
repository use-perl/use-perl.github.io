<div class="span8">
<p>Apple has been very forthcoming that Safari is a beta-grade product, and is actively asking for feedback with the little bug icon in the toolbar.
<p>
Toolbar elements can be shown or hidden using some toggle menu items in the View menu.  I've turned off the Bug button because the vast majority of sites that I've viewed with Safari are not broken.  (Some sites, like <a href="http://www.masonbook.com/">http://www.masonbook.com</a>, don't render correctly, and I have sent feedback back to Apple about that.)
<p>
I've just noticed that there's no way to send a bug report back to Apple once the bug button is not displayed.  There's no feature in any of the menu items that comes even remotely close to "send bug report".  Apparently, the only way to send a bug report in is to keep the bug button on the toolbar, or enable it quickly just for the purposes of sending in a single report.
<p>
It's a minor issue, but it's one of those little things I think Apple would have thought about in its user interface design...</p>

<p>Safari -&gt; Report Bugs to Apple<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...</p>
<p>'Course, I updated to "1.0 Beta (v51)" last night, that might be the difference.  And right now I'm only fooling around with Safari, I won't start giving it a real trial 'til it has tabs.  It's amazing how hard it is to surf without tabs.</p>

D'OH!.  I'm running v48, and it's in the Safari menu.  My blinders were on when I posted this entry; I didn't see the menus to the left of the File menu.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)
<p>
I haven't read the Aqua User Interface Guidelines, but it seems like Safari is putting a lot more in the app menu than other apps do; most other Aqua apps have an about and a preferences menu item, along with the standard Aqua entries (Hide, Quit, etc.).</p>

We are used to seeing the File menu next to the Apple menu, and our eyes just kinda skip the new application menu.
