<p>For non-cable-subscribers (like us), DVDs are a welcome respite from the bomb-to-bomb news coverage of the war in Iraq.
<p>
Tonight, our distraction was <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0268695">The Time Machine</a> from 2002.  I have no idea how it got onto our Netflix list, but it was in the mailbox yesterday.  I remember it lasted about 30 minutes in the theaters when it was released last summer, but I wasn't exactly sure <i>how</i> bad it really was.
<p>
This movie was worse than <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0185183">Battlefield Earth</a>.  
<p>
Yes, <i>that</i> bad.  There are no words.  </p>

<h2>I admit it</h2>

Ok, so I put it in the list.  After weeks of regressing to films of the '70s, I thought something new would be a good chnage.  My mistake. Most bad movies are good for a rental.  Most.  Not this one.



<h2>What's cable got to do with it?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Elian/">Elian</a> on 2003-03-21T16:30:43</h3>
I am a cable subscriber, and it's still wall to wall war. I keep waiting for the Food Network to roll out a war show.<br> <br>The most annoying thing is, given how little's actually happened the war coverage is even more vapid than what it's replacing, and when "Are you hot" is more substantial than the news you know there's a real problem...
