<p>Oliver Boermans <a href="http://www.ollicle.com/2003/11/18/hail_thief.html">relates</a> his frustration to EMI that the new Radiohead CD has copy protection that prevents him listening to a CD he <i>purchased</i> on his iPod.
<p>
Paradoxically, he might have better luck looking for the MP3s on the net, music he wouldn't be purchasing.
<p>
Funny, that.</p>

For sure, the complete album was in circulation two months before the album was released. I wouldn't be suprised if the band themselves leaked it.

I really like Radiohead, but I will never buy another Radiohead album.  I might consider it if they re-released this album without the copy protection.<br> <p>I also don't download music off the net where it might violate the copyright.  Too bad for both me and Radiohead I guess.  They won't get my money and I won't hear their music.</p>

DEAR RIAA I DOWNLOADED THE ENTIRE CONTENTS OF THE RADIOHEAD ALBUM BEFORE IT WAS RELEASED. HAIL TO THE THEIF.

I would be dubious as to whether this is the band's doing. Many artists have little control over this sort of thing. It might be their album, but the company have the right to release it in any format they so choose. That includes adding software without the band's blessing.
<p>
Prince and George Michael both attempted to sue their respective record companies of the lack of control over their own products. Prince changed his name to make it as awkward as possible for Warner Brothers and George Michael refused to make another record for Sony. They eventually got released from their contracts. Both had more clout than many other artists and I suspect Radiohead may not be in a position to throw their weight around.
</p><p>
The more people refuse to pay for copy protected CDs, the quicker the whole thing will be quashed. Despite claims that file sharing is stealing the market, if record companies note there is a drastic reduction in sales of copy protected CDs as opposed to non-copy protected CDs, they won't want to harm their sales figures any further.</p>

Agreed.  Don't buy it.  If you buy it by accident, return it, and if they refuse to accept it, tell them it will not play in your CD player, so it is therefore defective.<br> <br>And if you are an artist, insist in your contract that your CDs do not contain copy protection technology.  They may or may not be receptive to it, but that's why you have an agent, so don't worry about the details.<br>
