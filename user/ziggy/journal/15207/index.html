<p>I've been in a Jazzy mood this week, mostly listening to Dave Brubeck, Thelonious Monk, and McCoy Tyner (with some Django, Miles and Birdman thrown in for good measure).
<p>
It's amazing how Brubeck's sound so totally <i>fits</i> in NYC.  It's like a really good soundtrack for the city.  And it's somehow joyful at the same time.  Maybe it's just some cosmic alignment for the feel of the city on a crisp, pleasant, bright, sunny Fall day.</p>

I doubt that NYC is simple enough to be expressed by the music of a single musician<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) I noted that, except Django, all musicians you listed began the significant part of their career in New York. / You might want to check out Phineas Newborn, Lennie Tristano and Cecil Taylor for pianists that carry the same kind of sound than Brubeck : complex and urgent.

Thanks for name dropping, duly noted in Palm. Speaking of jazz, does anyone have a favorite jazz station to listen to on the Internet (English or otherwise). I listen to <a href="http://www.cod.edu/wdcb/wdcb_online.htm" title="cod.edu">WDCB</a cod.edu> (DuPage,IL) which is all jazz, and is decent. Any other pointers would be appreciated. I really like listening to jazz, because most of it is sans-vocals, and lyrics tend to distract me when programming.

It's not so much that Brubeck captures the totality of New York.  It's more that it just <i>fits</i> into the feel of midtown on a crisp fall day.
<p>
I think it was noteworthy because lots of music doesn't have any of that timeless resonance.  Nirvana may have "fit" when Kurt Cobain was alive, but that moment has passed, and <i>Smells Like Teen Spirit</i> doesn't speak to the city (or this country) anymore.  Dick Dale might be a great accompaniment when racing in a cab going uptown on 5th, but not when sitting in Central Park.
</p><p>
I'll keep my eyes peeled for those pianists.  Thanks.</p>
