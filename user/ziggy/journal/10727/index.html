<p><a href="http://reuters.com/newsArticle.jhtml?type=healthNews&storyID=2267218">This tidbit</a> came up via <a href="http://news.google.com/">Google News</a>:
<blockquote><i>
<b>School children under 16 are  being encouraged to experiment with oral sex as part of a  Government-backed drive</b> to cut Britain's sky-high teenage  pregnancy rate, newspapers reported on Friday.

Did &laquo;<i>cut the teenage pregnancy rate</i>&raquo; become a euphamism for &laquo;<i>nudge-nudge, wink-wink</i>&raquo; when I wasn't paying attention?</p>

<h2>Oral sex</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/TorgoX/">TorgoX</a> on 2003-02-21T19:36:10</h3>
I file "ORAL SEX HOW-TO" under the Life Skills component of the curriculum.  Hell, they might as well, learn <em>something</em> in school.



<h2>Headlines</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/vek/">vek</a> on 2003-02-22T18:08:03</h3>
I actually had to read the article twice.  I thought it was a joke the first time I read it but then to my amusement I realized that they were serious<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)



<h2>Returning to the Hellmouth...</h2>

<p>Goddammit, I'm going back to High School to be just like  <a href="http://www.comedycentral.com/tv_shows/strangerswithcandy/" title="comedycentral.com">Jerry Blank</a comedycentral.com>.

<h2>The Times sinks ever lower</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/blech/">blech</a> on 2003-02-24T11:39:44</h3>
The Times, of course, had its own rather bad spin on the story, and it's got picked up on by blogdom. However, if you read the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/2787491.stm" title="bbc.co.uk">BBC News coverage</a bbc.co.uk> a somewhat different picture emerges.<br> <br>It only mentions oral sex once: "Examples included when a 14-year-old girl asks: 'What does semen taste like?' Or a 15-year-old boy: 'How do gay men have sex, and is it possible for a man and woman to do it the same way?'" Both of these seem like reasonable questions for curious, sexually mature, teenagers to ask, and should we not answer them?<br> <br>The teacher whose report in the Times Educational Supplement led to the sensational (and, apparently, humourous, although I don't see what's so funny) headline brings her own religious baggage to the argument. Of course, so do I, but then I'm not published in what's still an influential UK paper.<br> <br>Meanwhile, there's a story on the BBC about <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/2789549.stm" title="bbc.co.uk">a new warning over sex disease 'crisis'</a bbc.co.uk>, and the UK has the highest teenage pregnancy rate in Europe, as well as some of the worst sex education. Personally I don't think these aren't linked.

I don't see why you would or should.  My child has responsible parents who will provide all the teaching that is necessary, in a far better way than anyone else possibly could.<br>
