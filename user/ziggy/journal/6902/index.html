<p>Last week, I wasted most of the morning because the WinNT box at my desk (at my consulting gig, thankfully) wouldn't boot.  After a while, I found one of the admins, only to find out that the Windows admin was out all week last week.  Today, the machine still wouldn't boot (it failed POST).  After a few minutes of organ transplants (moving the  hard disk around), the problem seems to be the power circuitry on the hard drive.
<p>
That's reasonable.  Hardware fails, eventually.  Of course, there's no backup, but that's pretty common.  All of the important stuff is on a Linux server in the server room, which is backed up.
<p>
It took a while to get situated on a temporary machine last week.  The issue wasn't finding a machine to use -- after one round of layoffs, there are plenty of unused machines floating around the office.  The issue was mostly finding a machine that wouldn't crash on login, or prevent software from being installed (damn pesky users trying to get their work done...)</p>
