<p>First, the Mayor discovers some "listening devices" in his office.
<p>
Now <a href="http://www.philly.com/mld/philly/news/6963689.htm">this</a>:
<blockquote><i>
The bugging, according to people familiar with it, was part of a wide-ranging federal investigation into corruption in city contracts and other matters. Those same sources confirmed that a number of raids conducted by the FBI today were connected to the investigation.
<p>
[...]
<p>
While sources confirmed that the FBI had taken the extraordinary step of bugging the office of the mayor of the nation's fifth largest city, much about the federal raids today remained unclear.
</i></blockquote>
A month before mayoral elections, no less.  The race is a dead heat at the moment, a total replay of the 1999 election where some "irregularities" gave Mayor Street a few thousand swing votes that got him into office.  (Recounting the recounts wasn't fashionable in 1999...)</p>

We never have anything interesting happen with our mayors in DC.

It's hard to get worked up about DC municipal politics.  It's such a dead-end, meaningless job.  Someone needs to be responsible for plowing the streets in the winter and urging people not to walk outside in hurricane force winds.  No one seems to care (or notice) if that person is a crackhead or a self-important posturing narcissist.
<p>
In Philly, the mayor's office is a launching pad for bigger and better things.  You can become a <a href="http://www.thehistorymakers.com/biography/biography.asp?bioindex=320&amp;category=politicalMakers" title="thehistorymakers.com">pastor</a thehistorymakers.com> (after atoning for bombing an entire city block), a <a href="http://www.caminobooks.com/rizzo.html" title="caminobooks.com">true urban legend</a caminobooks.com> (after suppressing civil unrest with an iron fist), or <a href="http://www.governor.state.pa.us/" title="state.pa.us">Governor</a state.pa.us> (after receiving the title of <i>America's Mayor</i>).</p>

For example, the current Mr. Yuengling, Dick, has four daughters, three who now work at the brewery, and all whose husbands took the Yuengling last name.

yes dick has four daughters and three work at the plant, but only two are married and both took their husbands names. Debbie is now Debbie Ferhat and Jennifer has been Jennifer Franquet. The youngest daughter Cheryl just graduated from Alabama and is not married. The fourth daughter Wendy lives in Baltimore Md.and took her husbands name.
