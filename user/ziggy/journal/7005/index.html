<div class="span8">
<p>We lost power this morning.  It shouldn't have mattered to me, since I was working on the iBook at the time.  Just to be safe, I went upstairs to perform a graceful shutdown on my desktop machine (attached to a UPS).
<p>
The UPS <i>did</i> work, except that it wasn't exactly uninterruptable.  As I got to the console, the machine was in the process of rebooting off of battery power.  So I did a graceful recovery-and-shutdown.
<p>
About 45 minutes later, power came back.  I tried to reboot, only to find that FreeBSD was barfing on the same kernel panics I <i>thought</i> I had fixed one week ago (trying to set a value to the <tt>net.link.ether.bridge_cfg</tt> sysctl variable was supposed to configure ethernet bridging, but instead caused a kernel panic).
<p>
After an hour of booting, crashing and rebooting, (when nothing looked broken, yet the kernel panics occurred practically on demand), I saw that there were some extra messages in the boot log that weren't echoed to the console during boot.  It turns out that the bootloader was loading the <tt>bridge</tt> module (and presumably failing), and the <tt>bridge</tt> module was failing to load properly during normal boot, which would explain why the system would crash when trying to set one of its sysctl variables.
<p>
I'm not sure how it got there, but the line in <tt>/boot/loader.conf</tt> that said <tt>bridge_load="YES"</tt> seems like the most likely cause of my recent unstability.  Once I commented it out, there were no more module load failures, and no more kernel panics.
<p>
Two+ hours down.  Now back to work...</p>
