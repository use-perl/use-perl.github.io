Good news!  Tech hiring is on the rise!  Here's a polite, thoughtful message that just appeared in my mailbox:
<pre>
Subject: Technical Lead / Technical Architect
   
Hello Owner,
   
My name is John Hardeman and I saw your on line
resume and was wondering if the following fulltime
position with Dell Computers would be of interest
to you.  I am currently sourcing for the Hiring
Manager and if you think this position is a good
fit for you, please respond with your resume,
salary requirements, availability, a short
paragraph on how your skills relate to the
following job.  I will then submit your resume to
the Hiring Manager at Dell Computers and give you
a follow up call.  Positions can be located in
Arizona, Portland, OR, or Seattle, WA.   My email
address is [...]
</pre>
</p><p>
Later on in this message, the head hunter lists <tt>@every_microsoft_technology</tt>.  Anyone who actually bothered looking at my resume would know that I'm not a good fit.  For starters, I use Perl, not .Net-of-the-week or C#...
</p><p>
Then again, the message was sent to a list owner alias.  Hm.  Kinda funny for someone to post a resume for a list owner alias....
</p><p>
Spammers.  Can't live with them.  Can't bury them in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yucca_mountain">Yucca Mountain</a>.

<h2>Mount Yucca, eh?</h2>

That's a nearly ideal solution for the spammer problem.  However, I worry about the dangers of interstate transport.  Perhaps we should simply seal them all in a rocket bound for the sun?

Isn't that a waste of rocket fuel?  I mean, have you seen the price of gas this week?  If cars get ~30 mi/gal, and the sun is 93,000,000 miles away, that'll take, oh, about 3 billion gallons of gasoline!!!<br><br>Don't worry about the interstate transport problems though.  All convoys to Yucca Mountain are under heavy escort, with all cargo in secured containers that the DoE has rendered leakproof.  If you can get the spammers onto the Yucca Mountain Express, there's no chance they're getting out.
