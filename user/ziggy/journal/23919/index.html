<p>brian <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/6770">notes</a> that <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/mac.html">Paul Graham</a> recently <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/mac.html">switched</a> from FreeBSD to a PowerBook.  Macs hit the open source community about 4 years ago, and really hit with a vengence 3 years ago, which makes Paul a little late to the game.  ;-)  (Some folks are already on the <a href="http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/003868.html">other side of the curve</a>
<p>
Paul mentions two interesting aspects of his conversion.  
<blockquote><i>When I walked into the <b>Apple store in Cambridge</b>, it was like coming home. 
</i></blockquote>
Yep.  That's center-of-the-universe syndrome.  The obscure Cambridge, MA variety, rather than the more common NYC variety.  (The Cambridge Apple store opened last year, if I'm not mistaken.)  Hm....Lisp and Lisp machines hit big in Cambridge in the 1980s, and Paul's a big fan.  The Apple Store hit Cambridge last year, and Paul is a late convert to Mac OS X.  I wonder if there's a correlation here...
<p>
Another troubling assertion:
<blockquote><i>
[T]here's this company called Apple. They make a new kind of computer that's as well designed as a <a href="http://www.bang-olufsen.com/">Bang & Olufsen</a> stereo system, and underneath is the best Unix machine you can buy.
</i></blockquote>
Wow.  What a backhanded compliment.  Among audiophiles, B&O is famous for designing very pretty, incredibly over priced equipment that offers mediocre performance at best.  If Apple is selling B&O grade equipment, and sells the <b>best</b> Unix machine that money can buy, it's time to sell your Apple stock and start investing in abacuses.  Or maybe Curta calculators.  :-)</p>

Yeah, I was gonna say, I was at the opening (with some friends<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-) and I have not been to Cambridge in a couple of years<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...

I just found some pics I've got in iPhoto, of when we were there for the Jaguar release<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... August 23, 2002.

Tim Bray simply reports that he's <i>thinking</i> about it, and there is a lot of downside. He's not talking about other people. I'm not sure what you mean by "other side of the curve", since Tim says he's switch to Solaris. That's more like regressing to 1998. It's not even <i>in</i> the curve.

<p>Hmm?</p>
<ul>
<li>&#8220;Other side of the curve&#8221; is ziggy&#8217;s phrasing, in his case referring to Windows. That is better?</li>
<li>I did say &#8220;veering onto,&#8221; not &#8220;on.&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;Other&#8221; was a link to Tim&#8217;s weblog, so I don&#8217;t know where you got your impression that I was talking about a lot of people.</li>

You didn't link "Other", you linked "Others".  You used the plural.  Why would you say "other" if you meant a single, particular person?<br> <br>Ziggy was talking about windows.  Tim Bray wasn't. You implied that he was by continuing Ziggy's metaphor.<br> <br>You wrote it, not me.  Have the balls to defend it if that's what you meant, or just declare "mea culpa".

I&#8217;m surprised that of all the things I wrote recently, this is rather innocent seeming aside is the one to get backlash. All I could own up to is that what I wrote seems to imply something I didn&#8217;t intend it to. I guess I&#8217;m hereby doing that. I&#8217;m sorry if I offended anyone in some way am not aware of.

<h2>&quot;Best Unix machine money can buy&quot;?!</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/schwern/">schwern</a> on 2005-03-30T23:14:31</h3>
I think the ol' boy's gone a little giddy.  I can say a lot of good things about OS X but I certainly wouldn't call it the best Unix machine.  Perhaps the best Unix DESKTOP machine but on the whole OS X's actual Unixen is just a crappy commercial BSD.  Out of date.  Slow to upgrade.  And just plain slow.<br> <br>Which is not to say they haven't put a whole lot of nifty things on top of it and solved a lot of problems the Linux Desktop folks have been trying to do for years.  That's what sells me.  "Its Unix AND I don't have to recompile my kernel and twiddle 15<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/etc files to get wireless working?  SIGN ME UP!"<br>
