<div class="span8">
<p>A friend of mine bought a <i>random</i> desktop PC about two years ago.  About two weeks ago, he called up one evening because this trusty workhorse (that was never configured properly, because said <i>random</i> vendor didn't provide installation media, should the disk be wiped to install, say Debian Linux on one partition...) up and died.  
<p>
So, we go through the possible causes:
<ul>
<li>Gremlins</li>
<li>DC power coming over the AC line</li>
<li>Hard disk gone soft</li>
<li>Lost a few bits of memory</li>
<li>Power spike</li>
<li>frayed cable</li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>
The machine would succeed with the POST, but then the screen would go absolutely black.  It <i>sounded</i> like it was a bad memory problem, but if that were the case, then the POST would fail (wouldn't it?).
<p>
Well, it turns out that it was a bad sector on the  hard disk -- right where <tt>autoexec.bat</tt> happened to be hiding.[1]  Funny, that.  I thought <tt>autoexec.bat</tt> was <i>soooo</i> late 20th Century.  Twenty years later, and that little hack is still causing grief.  I'm not sure what the solution to that particular problem, but my friend's workaround was to buy a brand-spanking-new top o' the line laptop and limp along for a few days until he could get his data (no backups, natch).
<p>
Some hacks never die.
<p>&nbsp;<p>
[1]: Of course, a bad sector in the wrong file in <tt>/etc</tt> or the bootloader or the kernel would be nasty too, but likely less fatal.</p>

<h2>POST</h2>

POST is rarely able to find memory problems.  The best it can usually do is determine how much memory is addressable, although I've had machines that have failed to do that.
