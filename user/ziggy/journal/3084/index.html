<p>A while ago, I stopped using Netscape cold turkey.  It's a pretty bloated browser, and the 4.x series for Linux is quite crufty.  I stopped using Netscape on Windows for a while now because (1) M$ has engineered it such that you'll never be without IE, and (2) Netscape on Windows is pretty darn old.
<p>
On FreeBSD, I started using a recent build of Konqueror.  Then I got fed up with IE and started using Mozilla on Windows, then Mozilla on FreeBSD.  One simple hack that got added to Konqueror over the years is shortcut URLs.  Konqueror recognizes URLs that start with <tt>man:</tt> as manpage references, <tt>gg:</tt> as shortcuts to search Google, <tt>dict:</tt> as shortcuts to look up a word in the dictionary at <a href="http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary">m-w.com</a>, and so on.
<p>
The funny thing is that in the grand scheme of things, I used Konqueror exclusively for only a few weeks, but now I'm hooked on the shortcut URLs.  And I'm constantly befuddled when I tell Mozilla to fetch <tt>dict:blather</tt> how I always get <a href="http://www.dict.com">a slovakian dictionary company</a>.</p>

  I used Konqueror for at least nine months and I had dozens of url shortcuts (notably cpan:). About 5 months ago I switched to Mozilla because it is generally techically superior but <em>I still have those old reflexes</em>. I don't know what to do...

Don't you find that Mozilla is really <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/vek/journal/3039" title="perl.org">sluggish</a perl.org> on Linux though?

  No, it's blazing fast here. Besides, it's a bit unfair comparing a web browser with Netscape 4, they don't fulfill quite the same task. A web browser has to read HTML, CSS, text in various encoding, images, all those things that Netscape always promised by never delivered.

<i>Besides, it's a bit unfair comparing a web browser with Netscape 4, they don't fulfill quite the same task.</i> <br> <br>Yeah, I see your point.  However it's really frustrating waiting for Moz to render a page - takes almost twice as long as vanilla Netscape, have to keep reminding myself that Mozilla is a technically superior browser so I should be happy right<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)  Again, I've only noticed this on Linux, the windows port of Mozilla 0.98 is <b>really</b> quick, so go figure...

  I'm starting to get the impression that all builds are not equal, even when they have the same version number on the same platform. My moz 0.9.8 is really fast on Linux and the same is really slow on windows<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) Besides, my Linux version has anti-aliasing built-in, and everyone keeps telling me that that's not possible...
