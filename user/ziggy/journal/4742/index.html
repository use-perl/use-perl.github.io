<p>Comments on Andy Oram's <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/lpt/wlg/1374">recent weblog entry</a> on "wireless libraries" (Wi-Li).
<blockquote>
Libraries, as we have grown to known them over the last centuries,
are a place.  They are a primary a place browse books and bookshelves,
but they are also a place to meet with classmates and find librarians.
Replacing all that with an 802.11b connected terabyte server is
simply a case of premature optimization -- access to digitized
works will be easier, but a great deal will be lost in the process.
 <p>
Surely, there is much to be gained by improving the computing
facilities around libraries.  For example, adding 802.11 networks
for browsing a truly well-designed card catalog web app from any
seat in or out of the library, not just the uncomfortable desks 
and tables designated for their use.
 <p>
Any bibliophile knows intuitively that there is something marvelous
and tactile about books.  They can be taken outside and read under
the shade of a tall tree, read late at night in bed, or in your
favorite comfy chair.  Ebook readers have all of the promise of
the paperless office, with the same potential for delivering the
dream to match.  So while there may be a benefit to digitizing a
few titles that are in both short supply and high demand, switching
an entire library over to digital media is like building a 12-lane
highway because an existing but disused sidewalk isn't wide enough
for four to walk abreast.
 <p>
Finally, I don't see how bringing a library to a workspace (either
a lab or a garden) will be an improvement.  What's good about
students who won't need to trudge back to the library for reference
material? The long walk back to the library teaches students that
everything has a cost -- if you didn't do sufficient research the
last time, then you'll need to stop whatever activity you've started
and return to the library to resume your research.  Putting a
well-stocked library within reach of every student at all times  
will be about as productive as putting a web browser on every 
computer; it may be a good research tool on occasion, but it will
be a distraction more often than not.
