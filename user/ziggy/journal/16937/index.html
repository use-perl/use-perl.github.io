<p>I stumbled across <a href="http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/library/ws-roles/index.html?ca=drs-tp0404">this article</a> on developerWorks today.  It describes all of the roles on a project team that developers web services and service-oriented architectures.
<p>
Skimming over the article, it looks like it should have been titled &laquo;<i>It takes a village to write a Web Service</i>&raquo;.
<p>
Someone must have opened pandora's box since I last looked into web services...</p>

<h2>How is this a surprise?</h2>

Given that the two strongest backers of web services were and are IBM and Microsoft?<br>

Don't get me wrong.  Web Services were overcomplicated to begin with.  But this kicks it up about an order of magnitude.
<p>
It's difficult to manage that kind of complexification -- even for IBM and Microsoft.  Either that, or I've grossly underestimated their ability to complexify something as trivial as IPC.</p>

<p>Anything that starts off with "First, let's talk a little bit about XML..." should warn you.  If the phrase "distributed systems" follows anywhere, run.</p>

and don't forget the awful "Three-tiered enterprise solution..."<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

<p>I'm <em>certain</em> there's something between those double quotes, but my brain refuses to read it.  Mind you, this is not a complaint.</p>

Similarly to<br> <br> <em> <br>Peace is not in the interest of the military-industrial complex.<br> </em> <br>also<br> <br> <em> <br>Simplicity is not in the interest of software companies.<br> </em> <br> <br>(I just made up both quotes.  Sure sign of pretentiousness.)
