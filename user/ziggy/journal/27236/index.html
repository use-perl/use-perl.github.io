What do you do when you turn 54 and start to feel old?  Get yourself to a gun range, get a submachine gun and <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/10/11/AR2005101101524.html">start firing rounds at a rate of $62,000/hour</a>:

<blockquote><i>
Fortunately, logistics proved no problem. This is America. By federal law, there must be a machine-gun firing range within a 10-minute Hummer drive of any major intersection.

<h2>Hmm</h2>

I hope I'm not the only person who expanded H&amp;K to Heckler and Koch (without noticing the abbreviation) and didn't get the "named like that" thing until the example (the one that doesn't actually belong to a gun manufacturer).<p>
For the record, I know a lot about guns, but have never fired one.</p>

<h2>Wrestle the barrel ?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/n1vux/">n1vux</a> on 2005-11-03T18:46:20</h3>
The <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/10/11/AR2005101101524.html" title="washingtonpost.com">original (RTFA) article</a washingtonpost.com> is worth a look, if only for the cartoon of Tweetie Bird locked-and-loaded, rockin'-and-rollin' on full auto. But it's also really a nice piece of <b>ironic self-deprecation, mocking American "gun culture"</b> while having a little guilty pleasure (and subsidized by writing the article!) -- which irony should be obvious from the title:subtitle "<i>Spray It, Don't Say It /
A guy's guide to communication</i>" -- but written with light enough irony so that the macho guys may not notice and may enjoy it too.

<p>But since this is a technoblog, I need to comment on the appallingly old technology.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)
</p><p>"<i>All you can do is wrestle desperately to keep the barrel down against a ferocious upward kick.</i>"
</p><p> <b>How last-century!</b> (Or even <a href="http://website.lineone.net/user/braithwaitej/mainsite/overview/guns/mauser.htm" title="lineone.net">1896</a lineone.net>.)
The <a href="http://images.google.com/images?q=H%26K%20MP5%20" title="google.com">H&amp;K MP5</a google.com> (that name sounds more like a music format than a fearsome weapon) has only minor ergonomic improvements from the <a href="http://images.google.com/images?q=Thompson+45" title="google.com">1927 Tommmie gun</a google.com> of nearly 80 years ago, and is recognizably derived from the Mauser C96 patented 110 years ago. They all walk up and to the side on full-auto<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... which is one reason 3-round-burst-mode is preferred by the military in most situations. (Of course the exceptions are important.)

</p><p>The prototype for a <a href="http://www.military.com/soldiertech/0,14632,Soldiertech_KRISS,,00.html" title="military.com">new generation of</a military.com> submachineguns (SMGs) is described as looking like a "<i>cross [between] a car wash spray nozzle [and] a Thompson submachine gun<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... [I]n addition to reducing felt recoil and muzzle rise on full-auto, the KRISS's unique design...  reduces weapon weight by as much as 50%. The total number of parts (including moving parts) is supposed to also be lower[.]</i>".

</p><p>But they're not in production yet, so while you can watch on-line demos, your local renta-range doesn't have them yet.</p>
