<p>Lisa and I were shopping for DVDs the other day.  We're in a classic-TV frame of mind at the moment. (an entire season of The Sopranos stands up to repeated viewing much better than a movie like Unbreakable or Manon of the Spring.  Go figure.)
<p>
I picked up a copy of Twilight Zone DVD #8 this weekend.  It's got <i>To Serve Man</i> and three other classic episodes.  The funny thing is that there was differential pricing for various DVDs in the series: a few were $12.99, some were $14.99, and most were $19.99.  (Note to self: check out Amazon's pricing for a comparison; might be a pricing glitch.)
<p>
Now the old original Twilight Zone is just about as classic as it gets.  What's really amazing to me is that these productions are 40 years old, but the writing is still so fresh and crisp!  Even though the production budgets were quite small, there were no special effects to speak of, and the set of techniques at their disposal was quite small, the production is still incredibly well done.  There is was more thought put into 24 minutes of <i>Third from the Sun</i> than there is in a typical episode of the X-Files (choose your favorite season).  Even with the then-accepted technique of very long shots (do we need to see a little girl climbing the stairs for 20 seconds?  No, but it doesn't adversely impact the story telling...) there is a lot going on here.  Doze off for a few seconds, and you'll miss something important.  (When was the last time you could say that about a recent Star Trek?)</p>

Okay, it's on it's way. But tell me this, oh mighty oracle whose wisdom is boundless as the very skies above us, what exactly is a woodchuck?
