<p>In the early 1990s, there was a lawsuit between USL and UCBerkeley about copyright infringement in BSD Unix.  Eventually, the matter was settled, and a version of 4.4BSD was produced that was completely devoid of USL code (4.4BSD Lite2, the foundation for FreeBSD).
<P>
Flash forward to 2003, and it's happening again.  SCO, the now-current owners of AT&T's intellectual property are suing IBM for <a href="http://news.com.com/2100-1016_3-999371.html?tag=fd_lede1_hed">releasing Unix trade secrets in Linux</a>.  This suit has been going on for about six weeks now, and it'll be a few years before the courts render a final verdict in this case.  The early indications are that a lot of lawyers will make out well, but by the end of the case, there will be no significant changes to Linux or SCO's Unix products.
<p>
I predict that sometime around 2013, the new corporate owners of the AT&T Unix IP will sue the Free Software Foundation, because of some perceived infraction in GNU/Hurd (a patent infringement case would be nice; haven't had one of those yet).  This case will also take years to settle, enriching a lot of attorneys, but not making a fundemental dent in the overall software landscape.</p>

Why?

Because lawyers fees suck.

Better:

</div></blockquote>
That's a lawyer, folks.  Discussing "wrong" and "right".  Insert laughter here.
