<p>The last few days, it's been foggy at home, on the way to the train station.  Nothing really interesting about that, although it's sometimes pretty watching the mists rise off of the itty bitty lake (duck pond, actually)...
<p>
However, when I get off the train in Baltimore (at Camden Yards) and make my way around the inner harbor, there isn't any fog anywhere.  None.  Nothing rising off of the harbor, nothing down town, nothing near the office -- nothing.
I chalked this up to a warmer climate around Baltimore (30 minutes journey north), different prevaling weather conditions, more concrete in the area or some meteorological effect of the harbor itself.
<p>
Today was different.
<p>
I started walking down Conway street, and I couldn't see the harbor through the fog.  I got to the harbor (stopping off at Starbucks on the way -- shame on me!) and the whole harbor was fogged in.  The other side was barely visible.
<p>
This afternoon, I took a late lunch, and the area was still overcast and foggy around 3pm.  Ordinarily this wouldn't be remarkable, but there was an ominous character to the daylight -- like someone was filming yet another remake of a Jack the Ripper movie.  This wasn't ordinary fog, like I've seen elsewhere, even the frequent bits of fog that came into Vancover.  This fog just sort of hung in the air all day long.
<p>
I really don't know what to make of it.  I'm chalking it up to a really sleepy small town atmosphere around Fells Point (where I'm currently consulting) and the inner harbor complex.</p>
