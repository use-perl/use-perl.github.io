<p>I've been playing with my FireWire drive today.  First, a few things are known not to work:
<ul>
<li>A drag-copy won't copy files that I can't read, and it will reset file ownership and permissions.</li>
<li><tt>tar</tt>, <tt>pax</tt>, <tt>rsync</tt> and <tt>cpio</tt> might be able to retain file attributes, but cannot backup the HFS+ resource fork.</li>
<li><tt>sudo tar</tt> or the moral equivalent will handle copying files I can't read, and preserve permissions as well</tt>
</ul>
I've heard about <tt>psync</tt> that comes with the Mac::File distribution, but decided against it.  I started out with <a href="www.metaobject.com/Community.html"><tt>hfstar</tt></a>, but it was acting funny.  I had an old version and upgraded it, and it still was acting a little funny (although it was preserving the resource fork when I used <tt>hfstar</a> to do the extraction</tt>).
<p>
Poking around, I found <tt>rsync_hfs</tt>, available from the CVS repository at <a href="http://www.opendarwin.org">opendarwin.org</a>.  I started using that, since it would be <i>much</i> easier to do an incremental backup just before I send the iBook back for repairs.
<p>
Here's what I learned:
<ul>
<li><tt>rsync</tt> to takes about 1 hour/GB to copy a data to a blank destination directory.  I'm guesstimating that this is due to computational overhead, since FireWire can do <i><b>much</b></i> better than that.  (<tt>hfstar</tt> seemed to be performing comparably)</li>
<li>Drag-copy performed about 50x better, pretty much at raw FireWire speed.  (An 8GB mix of small and large files took about 15 minutes, while a 400MB rsync took about 20 minutes).  However, the drag-copy technique won't get the file metadata right, nor will it copy files I can't read.</li>
<li>A final fixup through <tt>sudo rsync_hfs</tt> will cleanup any remaining issues that the came from the drag-copy</li>
</ul>
This worked so well, I'm considering reformatting the hard drive after the hardware is fixed to make this a dual-boot machine.  :-)</p>

<h2>psync?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/pjm/">pjm</a> on 2002-11-01T12:48:30</h3>
Which leads to the obvious question: why not psync? Reports I read tell of speeds way in excess of what you're seeing, and it seems to be reliable. I think someone (Randal?) might have been having trouble making a bootable backup via psync, but that seemed to be a drive-specific issue (ie an early firewire drive).<br/><br/>Just interested in why you looked elsewhere (as I've pointed a lot of people toward psync as a way to incrementally backup on Mac OS X).

I'm told my problem with making a bootable drive was merely that I hadn't installed a base system onto the drive.  When I jumped from my 667 to my 800, I did it by installing a small release on the 800, <tt>psync</tt>'ing the entire release over the top (gotta love that target disk mode), and the 800 was bootable as if it was the 667.  Works fine.
<p>
I'm using psync daily to a backup firewire drive.  However, since I can't "boot" off of that, I'll probably just install and drag-copy stuff back if I ever need to use it.</p>

I believe that the speeds are directly related to the number and size of the files being copied.  That is, copying 1 1GB file is significantly faster than copying 1024 1MB files or 256K of 4K files.  I've seen the variation in speed even with a drag copy.  And most of the files I'm backing up are small files...
<p>
<tt>rsync</tt> does impose some overhead on top of that.  After some more experimenting, it seems like <tt>rsync[_hfs]</tt> actually re-copies a file if the permissions are wrong, and my 8GB transfer was of my home directory (with a lot of MP3s), so the rsync fixup of<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/Users didn't have much to modify.
</p><p>
I've had to reformat the drive a few times now.  I <i>wanted</i> to use it on Mac OS X, FreeBSD and Win*.  However, the drive came as a dedicated HFS+ partition.  Drive Utility won't create an MS-DOS partition (only a dedicated MS-DOS drive).  While Drive Utility can create a UFS partition, I didn't get to test it out because (1) my FreeBSD kernel didn't have the umass driver compiled in, and (2) I'm skeptical that FreeBSD can read Apple's drive map.
</p><p>
It's not that I have something against <tt>psync</tt> per se.  Just that I wanted to try <tt>rsync[_hfs]</tt> first.  I'll probably test <tt>psync</tt> shortly.</p>

I believe you mean <a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?query=MacOSX::File&amp;mode=all" title="cpan.org">MacOSX::File</a cpan.org>.   There is no Mac::File.  There is a Mac::Files, part of MacPerl/Mac::Carbon, soon to be released!
