<p><blockquote>
Hackers, virus writers and software pirates could run rampant if Microsoft disclosed the technical product information that nine states have requested as an antitrust penalty, [says MS VP Jim Allchin].
<p>
[The] disclosures sought by the states "would make it easier for hackers to break into computer networks, for malicious individuals or organizations to spread destructive computer viruses and for unethical people to pirate" Microsoft's flagship software.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-- <a href="http://www.salon.com/tech/wire/2002/05/08/microsoft/index.html?x">Microsoft says penalty will let hackers run wild</a>
</blockquote>
<i>Could</i> run rampant?  Disclosures would make it <i>easier</i>?
<p>
Allchin must be in complete denial about all of the current 'sploits against Microsoft products, and he really does believe the marketspeak far to much for his own good.
<p>
Perhaps he's a double agent from Sun with a mission to completely embarrass Microsoft every few years.  <i>IE can't be removed from Windows!  Just look at here this little doctored video, and don't pay any attention to the man on the witness stand...</i></p>

While things are pretty damn bad, that doesn't mean they couldn't get <i>worse</i>.



<h2>Some Sense There</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/davorg/">davorg</a> on 2002-05-09T21:59:21</h3>
<p>Allchin does talk some sense tho'. The same article quotes him as saying:</p>
<blockquote><div>"We have to work on our reputation for security in the marketplace."</div></blockquote>
<p>Ain't that the truth<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>
