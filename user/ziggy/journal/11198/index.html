<h1>SQLite and MySQL</h1>

<div class="span8">
<p>I'm using <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/">SQLite</a> on a couple of projects at the moment.  I'm writing a Cocoa app in ObjC, and I want the thing to just work, so I need an embedded database.  I'm not especially happy that every column is a TEXT block, but it does make some things a lot easier.
<p>
I showed <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/speed.html">Matt Sergeant's benchmarking results</a> to David Axmark, one of the core MySQL developers.  Overall, David was pretty skeptical that SQLite <i>could</i> be faster than MySQL.  His observations:
<ul>
<li>A lot of the overhead between SQLite and MySQL is due to the TCP/IP stack.  Embedded MySQL should have comparable performance characteristics to SQLite</li>
<li>The use of strings for all columns comes from a fascination with Tcl; it's not a very interesting solution in terms of data integrity, but it is certainly understandable given the approach the designers took</li>
<li>Database structure operations (CREATE INDEX, DROP TABLE) are slower in SQLite because they took the entire-database-in-one-file approach; MySQL is faster here because indexes and tables are separate files.</li>
<li>It's fair that SQLite hasn't optimized operations that change a database's structure (CREATE INDEX, DROP TABLE, etc.), since their assertion is these operations occur infrequently.  David was quick to point out however that a few MySQL customers create a lot of temporary tables (hundreds per minute, IIRC).  These are certainly edge cases though.</li>
</ul></p>

<h2>Makin' tables!</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jjohn/">jjohn</a> on 2003-03-25T12:24:00</h3>
<p>Actually, I know of at least on medium-sized company that creates tables on the fly for their web application to hold session data. That's right, every session gets a new table. They use MySQL. I like MySQL and it's attendent admin and client utilities more the Postgres. Do I miss stored procedures? Sure, but I think those are
overrated. At gnat pointed out, SQL has exploded in popularity and there will be "language"-side (or middleware) tools that help with cascading deletes and other niceties that do easy the pain of DB applications. I just don't see what the big who-ha is about Postgres, but then I'm not doing financial transactions. MySQL is very <a href="http://www.jwz.org/doc/worse-is-better.html" title="jwz.org">New Jersey-style</a jwz.org>, but so is Linux.</p>
