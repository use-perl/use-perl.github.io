<p>Wired has an <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/13.06/craven_pr.html">article</a> about John PiÃÂ±a Craven, who has a cunning set of plans that all involve exploiting temperature gradients between deep ocean water and the surface:
<blockquote><i>
Craven hopes that within a year, bulldozers will begin clearing land on Saipan and engineers will start sinking a pipe to pump icy water from the ocean depths to produce electricity and freshwater. And back in Kona, Craven expects to use cold-water agriculture to transform five acres of otherwise barren lava fields into the world's most productive vineyard.
</i></blockquote>
The problem is, this reads just like a science fiction novel I read in the mid-1990s, and I can't remember the title!  The novel was a mediocre attempt at an epic story, which begins with a mad scientist who converts an oil tanker to pull up cold water from a few hundred meters beneath the surface, and use the temperature gradients to drive electrical generators.  The story unfolds in leaps and bounds, and at some point his granddaughter is a trawler captain who runs the company founded by the mad scientist, and the <i>fleet</i> of trawlers are bigger, have fatter pipes, pull more water from even deeper parts of the ocean.
<p>
I thought it may have been one of Damon Knight's later novels, but that doesn't appear to be the case.</p>
