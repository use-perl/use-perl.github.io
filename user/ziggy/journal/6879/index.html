<p>It's been about two months since I've gone cold turkey on coffee.  Occasionally I do miss it, but I don't get cravings for a good cup of joe or a shot or two of espresso.
<p>
It's gotten to the point where I'm walking past coffee shops almost oblivious to their presence.  But today, while on the way to the barber shop, we stopped into a Starbucks, mostly out of habit.  The strange thing was that I got to the counter and couldn't figure out what I was doing there.  It was a rather strange feeling, given how much time and money I've spent at Starbucks over the last decade...</p>

You could have had an iced tea or an Italian soda, I suppose...<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

You'd think.  But Starbucks is such an expensive place for a bottle of iced tea.  Especially if you're not into the Tazo flavors they offer, like ginseng bramblebery peach mango.  Strange thing is, I used to stop by coffee shops (<i>many</i> years ago) for italian sodas every so often.  Now I see them as just sugary fizzy water (when I'd prefer just the fizzy water). <p> What this nation needs is more tea houses.  There are two in DC.</p>

It's creepy, but I stopped drinking coffee about halfway through the training at my new job, instead bringing 2L bottles of tea with me.  Now, I have trouble bringing myself to make a cup of coffee.  Somehow it just isn't what I've wanted for a couple of weeks now. <p> I've just discovered Morning Thunder, and I'm pretty happy with it.  I'm sure my love affair with coffee isn't over yet...perhaps we just needed time away from each other.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)</p>
