<p>The DC Metro area received 5" of snow overnight.  The Federal Gov't is on a liberal leave policy (i.e., take a day off if you don't want to get into a car wreck coming into work).  The roads are ever so slightly treacherous, thanks to the locals and transplants who have never seen snow before.
<p>
So we're taking a snow day, and baking some bread.  The first rise is almost done, and we're in a bit of a quandry.  A standard bread recipe is enough for 2 1lb loaves, but we can only seem to find one standard loaf pan (aside from the other loaf pans of various sizes).
<p>
Cabin fever is starting to set in:
<blockquote>
Do you want to make one standard sized loaf, and use these four mini-loaf pans for the rest?
<p>
<i>Let's take a step back and take an assessment of our baking inventory.</i>
<p>
Before do that, we should start with a requirements analysis.
<p>
<i>That's a good idea, but we need to identify the stakeholders first.</i>
</blockquote>
I think there should be an addendum in the employee handbook for these situations.  If you use managementspeak at home during a snow day, it doesn't count as a day off.</p>

At times like this, I ask myself WWJD?

<p>
That should really be read as</p><p>
The roads are treacherouse because of the locals (pause) and transplants who have never seen snow before.
</p><p>
As a local, I can ensure you<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... we have seen snow before. Plenty-o-times. Doesn't really affect our driving really - we drive bad all the time and we don't let some silly thing like a semi-solid form of water influence our driving. Nope, not one bit.</p>

Hey, I'm from Philadelphia -- an area that's far enough north to close the schools about once a year due to inclement weather, but far enough south that there's a run on milk and bread whenever the weather guys predict so much as a flurry.
<p>
The snowflake-to-snowflake coverage of winter storms in the DC area is utterly stupefying.   So is the predilection of many school districts to close two days in advance of a mere <i>prediction</i> of flurries.
</p><p>
If the locals knew what snow looked like, you certainly can't tell from the news coverage, what with the nonstop entreaties to stay off the roads.  At least in Philadelphia, they save that kind of coverage for the "storm of the century" that comes by about once a decade.</p>
