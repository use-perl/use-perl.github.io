<p>I'm giving a talk on CVS at the June DC Perl Mongers meeting.  It's surprising how many developers still have CVS on their "list of things to learn" and haven't gotten around to using it (or some other SCM) yet.  To make this maximally useful, I want to review Karl Fogel's <i>Open Source Development with CVS</i> and the standard CVS documentation as part of the talk; there's only so much I can answer in a few hours, and I want to point people towards good material.
<p>
Long, long ago, I got a copy of the first edition of Karl's book, mostly to throw a few thank-yous his way for writing the first full-length english-language (printed) book on CVS.  I see now that there is a second edition, so I sent a message to the PR flacks about getting a review copy for this meeting and elsewhere.
<p>
Well.  For at least the last week, the publisher's website, <a href="http://www.coriolis.com">http://www.coriolis.com</a> resolves but times out when trying to fetch any page.  Thanks to the <a href="http://www.archive.org">Wayback Machine</a>, I was able to get some information, but they haven't done an update for this site since January.
<p>
So, did Coriolis go out of business and fail to tell anyone?  Are they still killing trees but not pushing bits?  </p>

<h2>CVS Book</h2>

Seems you missed the <a href="http://cvsbook.red-bean.com/" title="red-bean.com">online version of the book</a red-bean.com>. I use that in my CVS talks as the reference, rather than the CVS man pages.<br> <br>HTH.

No, I knew about the online version.  I was particularly interested in reading the few chapters
that didn't make it onto the web.  I've heard that there is some "insight" into development discussed in those chapters, more than the terse "CVS isn't a replacement for communication".

<h2>Karl is still working on subversion</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jdavidb/">jdavidb</a> on 2002-05-14T21:08:56</h3>
<p>I don't know about Coriolis, but Karl Fogel is still alive and kicking and working on <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/" title="tigris.org">subversion</a tigris.org>.  You might track him down and ask.</p>



<h2>CVS Training</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/exeunt/">exeunt</a> on 2002-05-14T22:43:32</h3>
While coming up with some training materials for people at my work on CVS, I ran across <a href="http://www.lodestar2.com/people/dyork/talks/2001/ols/index.html" title="lodestar2.com">this</a lodestar2.com>. I found it very enlightening, and useful. Still have not got around to doing the actual training, but when I do, I'll be sure to put what I've done online somewhere.
