<h1>Problems with wxPerl</h1>

<div class="span8">
<p>I got into a conversation about Perl GUIs the other day, and mentioned
that <a href="http://wxperl.sf.net">wxPerl</a> sounds pretty interesting
these days.  It's based on <a href="http://www.wxwindows.org/">wxWindows</a>,
which is mature, stable and used for a stunning array of projects.  
Mitch Kapor's Chandler is being written in wxPython, for example.
<p>
I haven't done any GUI programming in a long time, save for some
recent Cocoa/ObjC hacking.  This means that I've avoided Perl/Tk,
<a href="http://www.gtkperl.org/">GtkPerl</a>, <a
href="http://search.cpan.org/author/GGARAND/PerlQt-3.006/">PerlQt</a> or
wxPerl.  
<p>
So I started out with the latest wxWindows sources and tried to install
them on my FreeBSD laptop.  wxWindows was a simple <code>./configure ;
make ; make install</code>, but <code>Wx.pm</code> was a little more
tempermental.  I figured out that at a minimum, I needed to install the
xrc and stc extensions from the contrib directory.  
<p>
The bigger problem was with MakeMaker - it wasn't finding my wxwindows
include files in <code>/usr/local/include</code>.  OK, so just set
<code>CCFLAGS=/usr/local/include</code> when invoking <code>Makefile.PL</code>.
That worked OK for the main sources, but not for any of the sources in the
subdirectories, each of which had their own <code>Makefile.PL</code>s.  
Eventually, I found the cause of the problem: MakeMaker doesn't pass
invocation options to the sub-invocations of <code>Makefile.PL</code>.
<p>
All is not lost; I can just override those options with Make.  It didn't
work at first because BSD Make doesn't pass those overrides down to
sub-makes.  But GNU Make does, and an invocation like <code>gmake
CCFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include</code> worked well enough to build the
Wx module.
<p>
Then the tests failed because of an unresolved <code>pthread_*</code> 
symbol.  Turns out that my Perl build was unthreaded and wxWindows is
threaded, and the two don't work together very well.  So I rebuilt
wxWindows (and the required extensions) unthreaded and failed for a 
similar reason due to some <code>pthread_*</code> symbols in gtk/glib.
<p>
At this point, it was 6am, and I had spent a few hours compiling and
recompiling windowing toolkits and Perl modules until I realized I was
too tired for my own good.
<p>
&nbsp;
<p>
Sure enough, I woke up the next morning with the answer that should have
come to me many hours before: build a threaded Perl.  That worked, and
in about an hour, I had a working version of Perl, wxWindows and wxPerl.
