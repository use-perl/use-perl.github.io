<p><a href="http://www.jclark.com/">James Clark</a> has been rather quite of late.  There's a good reason for that -- he's been working on <a href="http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/relax-ng/">RELAX NG</a>, a better schema language for XML than the W3C's XML Schema.
<p>
James also <a href="http://xmlhack.com/read.php?item=1677">makes it clear</a> that XML technologies are a community development effort, not something owned by the W3C.
<p>
Here are <a href="http://www.imc.org/ietf-xml-use/mail-archive/msg00217.html">very significant reasons</a> to avoid XML Schema, regardless of it's parentage, blessing or corporate support:
<blockquote><i>
The definition of validity is so flexible in
W3C XML Schema as to seriously impact interoperability.  [...] 
With RELAX NG, this sort of bogosity does not arise: there is a clear,
unambiguous notion of validity.  If you have a RELAX NG schema, there
is no doubt about what instances are valid.
<p>
The role of a schema in a specification is to serve as a formalism.
How good is a formalism if that formalism itself lacks a proper formal
basis?
<p>
I often hear people say: "It doesn't really matter that the spec W3C
XML Schema Rec is so hard to understand; only W3C XML Schema
implementors need to do this". I think this is misguided. 
</i></blockquote>
(To be fair, James is asking equal billing for RELAX NG, even though he cites compelling reasons for abandoning XML Schema.)</p>

James Clark's email is really a brilliant piece. You can tell he is thouroughly po'ed at the W3C and how they push the monstruosity known as W3C Schemas!<br>I sure hope his weight will help to make people understand that the fact that a W3C blessed committee argued^H^H^H^H^H^Hworked for years on a standard does not automagically mean that the result should be accepted by the marketplace/community without restrictions.

Only time will tell.  But my money is on the schema language with a well-defined formal foundation, clear rules, and multiple interoperable implementations  (whichever schema language that may happen to be<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-).
<p>
In other news, I just got called back to revise some courseware I did about XML Schema.  Ugh.  One final foray into the belly of the beast, I hope.</p>
