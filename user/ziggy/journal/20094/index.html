<p>On Sunday, I awoke with a splitting headache.  Not sure what caused it,
but I usually don't get headaches, and it's rare that I get one that's
so bad that it keeps me in bed all morning.  Eventually, the Advil
and the Alavert kicked in sufficiently well for me to pursue my third
medication of the morning: Cafe Americano.  

<p>

With caffeine delivery vehicle in hand, I started wandering around
downtown Portland in the noon-day sun.  I got lost and found myself at
Portland State University before I doubled back, and found
<i>Murata</i>, the excellent Japanese restaurant Piers found last year,
and the Marriott, where there was the predictable gaggle of geeks in the
lobby making full use of the wireless network.

<p>

After chatting for a while, Robert and I wandered over to the Oregon
Brewers Festival, where we found Ron Kimball and a couple of other
conference attendees.  It was a hot day, so we focused on a couple of
American interpretations of Belgian Witbier, and the odd "pale ale" or
two.  Alaskan Amber is still as tasty as ever.  There were also a surprising number of east-coast beers at this
festival, including a half dozen brews from the mid-atlantic.  One of the food stands was selling Halibut and Chips -- I <i>never</i>
pass up a chance to get Halibut and chips when I'm in this part of the
globe.

<p>

After we had our fill of beer, we wandered back to the hotel to find the
usual suspects in the lobby.  At some point, I my throat started
bothering me, and I decided it was time for ice cream.  So Robert,
Jesse, and I took a stroll with the Fotango crew (Arthur, James and
Nick) to the ice cream place on the riverfront near the hotel.  Jesse
and Nick wanted something dinnerish, and got a couple of sandwiches,
while the rest of us got ice cream.  James and Arthur were amazed at the
you're-in-America-now sized portions -- $3 for a waffle cone with a very
generous "scoup" of ice cream.  Someone worked out that it was about
&pound;1.50 for about a pint of ice cream, with a cone underneath.  In England, I think they call this "ice cream for four".

<p>

After that, it was back to the hotel, where I reminded Nick that he is
in the US, so the paper is <i>supposed</i> to look funny -- it's 8.5x11,
not A4.  After some more yaking, it was time for bed, and a nice walk
back to the Sheraton in the cool evening air.</p>
