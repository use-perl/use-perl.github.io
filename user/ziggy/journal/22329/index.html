<p>Remember <a href="http://www.acs.org.au/president/1996/atm/npc/im961009.htm">this</a> outburst from Scott McNealy?
<blockquote><i>
[W]e did a survey at Sun. We had 12.9 gigabytes of Powerpoint slides in storage on our disk drives. Ha ha ha. It freaks me out just to think about. Do you how many person [centuries] that is? Of clip-art manipulations? I banned Powerpoint from our company - I just edicted it. That's cool - I'm chairman, President, founder, you know, chief cook and bottle washer there and I just edicted it - I just said "out". I think we are going to have a pretty good quarter because of that. I can't say for sure, but I guarantee you - if I just gave everybody overheads, you know, blank Mila overheads with all the free pens they wanted - I could drive productivity through the roof, as opposed to having - I mean you've all seen these overheads that have 14 pieces of clipart, 13 fonts, right hand justified, spell-check, 13 colours and you know your employee is exhausted by the time it finally comes off the printer. And do they communicate anything? No. 
</i></blockquote>
That was just over 8 years ago, back when 13GB was <i>big</i>, and that extra 100MB was significant.    Eight years later, and I carry more than that on my <i>hip</i>.  Hell, I might even have 13GB of <i>unused</i> disk space there for all I know.  
<p>
And here's the punchline: all that disk space, and nary a PowerPoint presentation to be found.  ;-)</p>
