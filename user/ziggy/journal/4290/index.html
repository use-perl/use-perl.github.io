<p>DevX has an <a href="http://www.devx.com/cplus/free/articles/dkhs41602/dkhs2-1.asp">interview</a> with Herb Sutter, their liason to the C++ community at large.  Herb isn't a slouch; he's the secretary of the ISO/ANSI C++ committee and has written about C++ for years.
<p>
The interview touches briefly on his role at Microsoft, and spends a lot of time on the state and future direction for C++.  It sounds like C++ today is <i>much</i> worse than I remember it.  I honestly don't know how anyone can pick up and love C++ today; it sounds like a great language to use if you've already been using it for the last five-to-ten years, but too complex to learn from scratch today.  But that's just my jaded opinion.  :-)
<p>
The interview closes with this bit of wisdom from Herb:
<blockquote><i>
Learn different tools. They teach different ways of approaching problems. Most language zealots I've encountered think that their favorite language is the be-all and end-all, simply because they know few or no other languages. Know the various tools you have available to you, and you can do a much better job of selecting the right toolsÃ¢â¬âplural, not singularÃ¢â¬âthat will help you get your job done today. 
</i></blockquote>
Funny, that sounds quite familiar.  Maybe gnat was onto something at YAPC in 1999.  :-)</p>
