<p><a href="http://www.schemers.org/">Schemers.org</a> is the proverbial online home of the Scheme community.  On the homepage are two links:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.schemers.org/Positions/lshift-2002-10-16.txt">looking for  functional programmers</a></li>
<li>Learn more in our <a href="http://www.schemers.org/Positions/">jobs</a> section.</li>
</ul>
A few observations:
<ol>
<li>The lshift position doesn't say <i>when</i> it was posted.  According to the URL, it was posted mid October 2002.</li>
<li>The lshift position doesn't say <i>where</i> the job is, or any relevant information about applying for the job</li>
<li>The lshift position lists a URL for more information (not hyperlinked), which is now 404.</li>
<li>The lshift homepage makes it clear that this is a London, UK, based firm; presumably that's where the job is as well, if it's still open...</li>
<li>The jobs page lists six open positions.  Looking at the URLs for these positions, 3 were posted in 2000, 1 was posted in 2001, 1 in 2002, and 1 in late January 2003 (working on an equity derivative systems at a bank in Munich).</li>
</ol>
Hrm.  Seems like not a week goes by without at least half a dozen messages from <a href="http://jobs.perl.org/">jobs.perl.org</a> appearing in my mailbox.  I won't even mention that the four job postings prominently listed on the home page were posted within the last month...</p>

<h2>It's in London and we're still on the look out</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Mik/">Mik</a> on 2009-02-03T16:28:17</h3>
That certainly was posted a while back, but not much has changed, we are still looking for good programmers - those with functional programming experience are most welcome and will probably find sympathetic ear here.<br/><br/>Try <a href="http://www.lshift.net/recruitment" title="lshift.net">http://www.lshift.net/recruitment</a lshift.net>
