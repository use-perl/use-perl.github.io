<h2><a href="/user/ziggy/">ziggy</a> on 2002-11-28T16:50:48</h2>
</div> <!-- /span4 -->


<div class="span8">
<p>I took my iBook into the Apple store in Clarendon, VA a week ago today.  My screen had uneven backlighting at low brightness, and the latch wouldn't close most of the time.  Something else happened <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/ziggy/journal/9048">last Wednesday</a>, where the machine would appear to crash and occasionally fail to boot.  (Oh, and I managed to chip the F1 key.)
<p>
After I spent an hour at the Genius bar detailing and demonstrating all of the problems, the iBook went to Austin to be repaired.  (There was a possibility that the iBook was dropped, which would have voided the warranty, or delayed repairs.  It wasn't dropped.)  I was told it would take about a week (maybe 10 days) to fix and return.  Someone at the Apple store called me this past Monday to tell me the iBook had been received at the repair facility, and they would be working on it shortly.
<p>
The iBook came back early Tuesday morning.  The Apple store called later that morning (after the store opened) to tell me that my iBook had been shipped back, and to give me the tracking number.  :-)
<p>
<b>The Good</b> The screen was replaced, along with the frame around it.  It closes nicely now, and the latch stays shut.  The issue with the loose wire seems to have been fixed, because it's not randomly crashing when I use the mouse, keyboard, USB or FireWire ports anymore.  Oh, and the F1 key was replaced too.
<p>
<b>The not so good</b>.  Something is still wrong with the backlighting, and it's worse than before.  It's got some dim spots, but now they're not quite as dim, and they're not on the left side anymore.   But they're more noticable (and more annoying) when the screen is at medium brightness.  They're more on the bottom of the screen and moving diagonally towards the upper left, rather than the entire left half of the screen.
<p>
I'll have to send it back again this weekend....</p>
