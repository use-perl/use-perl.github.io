<p><a href="http://use.perl.org/user/Matts">Matt</a> wrote a <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/Matts/journal/8173">brief update</a> about what's been going on at <tt>$company</tt>.  This passage brought a smile to my face:
<blockquote><i>
[...] I'm trying to work while everyone else is answering the phone being media darlings ;-) So I've come to the kitchen area to work. I've got wireless working and the iBook means I can work for quite some time without going back for my power cable. I'm down to 17m left on the battery, so I may just have to go back to my desk now, but I've been very productive in the short time I've been away in the quiet.
</i></blockquote>
The Dell Laptop I bought last year might last about 90 minutes with a fully charged battery and a wireless connection.  (There's a problem with the 802.11 driver; it keeps seeking on the disk every 3 seconds.)  My iBook routinely gets upwards of 3:30 on a fully charged battery with a airport turned on (and judicious use of the F1 key).
<p>
<b>This</b> is what laptops were <i>supposed</i> to be about.  
<p>
Now, if Apple would just bring hot swappable batteries to the iBook...</p>

<h2>hot swappable</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jdavidb/">jdavidb</a> on 2002-10-04T15:53:45</h3>
<p>I'd probably be happy if I could just pull out the battery without the clock resetting.</p>

<p>My ibook is the only laptop I've owned, and I only recently started hearing that other people don't routinely get 3 hour battery life on laptops.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>



<h2>Ugh, vaio...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Matts/">Matts</a> on 2002-10-04T17:08:42</h3>
My beautiful slim vaio sr1k gets about 45mins. Sexy laptop. Useless as a portable.<br> <br>Hot swap batteries would rock. Having to completely shut down to switch batteries is a tad annoying. Though I have never owned a second battery yet. Thankfully the iBook power supply isn't a brick so I don't mind dragging it around with me like I have to with my vaio.



<h2>SR7K</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/gizmo_mathboy/">gizmo_mathboy</a> on 2002-10-05T03:12:05</h3>
My sr7k lasts about 2 hours on the normal battery and easily twice that on the double capacity batteries I have.<br> <br>I concur on the need for hot swappable batteries. That would be really sweet.<br> <br>Well, back to surfing via wifi (on a cord though 'cause i can).



<h2>Battery swap on iBook</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ask/">ask</a> on 2002-10-06T11:50:28</h3>
Eh, can't you just close the laptop (to put it to sleep), swap the battery and open it up again?  That works fine on my old PowerBook (G3 Firewire 2000 / Pismo).<br> <br>
&nbsp; - ask

As I understand it, no.
<p>
There used to be a hack for some of the older powerbooks (pre-G3) where you could run the powerboook while asleep off of a 9V battery for a few minutes - long enough to swap batteries.
</p><p>
After that, Apple started putting a capacitor on the motherboard to serve the same function.  I understand it's on the Pismo and the TiBook, but not the iBook.  I did switch my battery once on the iBook, and it rebooted, so I'm inclined to believe the capacitor isn't on the current batch of iBooks.</p>
