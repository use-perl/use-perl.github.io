<p><a href="http://www.plotip.com/">plotip</a> popped up on delicious today, so I gave it a spin.  It does reverse IP address translation, and figures out stuff like where you live, current weather, current national population at that location (down to the nearest .3 child), national languages, TLD and currency, and how much money you have in your left pocket (almost).  Oh, and a pretty picture of the planet with your ICBM address higlighted by a little white dot about the size of Massachusetts.
<p>
Sitting at home, the lat/long for my IP has me at or about <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=38.895000,-77.036670&spn=0.008885,0.012145&hl=en">here</a>
<p>
Um, did I not get a memo?  Am I totally oblivious to the snipers on my roof or something?</p>

<h2>Accuracy</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/vsergu/">vsergu</a> on 2005-06-24T16:19:54</h3>
It says my work IP address is in Baltimore. It would probably be somewhat more accurate if it switched its ideas of your location and mine.



<h2>Bad data</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/delegatrix/">delegatrix</a> on 2005-06-24T17:39:47</h3>
It pegged me close enought to where I really am, but totally missed the population of the US.<br/><br/>It says: Population [National] 	278,058,881<br/><br/>Where did that come from?  The 2004 estimate is 293,655,404 and even the 2000 census count was 281,421,906.

They have a patented, sophistimicated algorithm that automatically subtracts cats and dogs from the population total.

<h2>Err, wrong country buddies...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/pjm/">pjm</a> on 2005-06-25T00:20:46</h3>
Looks like fun except for the fact that it seems to think that Australia is Austria: I tried a few IP's from my (Adelaide, Australia) university and they all display an interesting-but-not-terribly-helpful dot in the middle of Europe with the label "Austria" instead of a big blob in the Southern Hemisphere with the label "Australia".<br/><br/>Repeat after me: "au" = "Australia", "at" = "Austria". Ah well...

You mean Australia != Austria?  Wow!  Learn something new every day.  So which one is Governor Terminator from?  I can't tell from his accent.
<p>
What's next?  A discovery that Austrians don't speak English, but some long lost dialect of, say, Swedish?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)
</p> <p>
Ah well.  It doesn't matter much anyway.  Maybe you can get these guys to buy you a beer next time they show up at a conference.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)</p>

<h2>Funny</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ferreira/">ferreira</a> on 2005-06-25T01:04:43</h3>
I can't say anything but funny for this Plotip. It suggested I was in China, which is not very close to Brazil. If it was a joke, it was a good one.



<h2>Omniscient...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jdavidboyd/">jdavidboyd</a> on 2005-06-25T15:39:44</h3>
It seems to know more than I know, as it does get the location <i>slightly</i> wrong, but it says that the language here is<br>
<b>english</b>, <b>spanish</b> <br>
which is becoming more true every day!
