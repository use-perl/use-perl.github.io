People working at airlines don't like to talk about crashes, not even those affecting their computers.  
<p>
So it might seem strange to see a major airline turn to Windows, a product much-maligned as crash prone, as the only way to run a successful business. Yet for Jeff Cohen, chief information officer of JetBlue Airways, Windows is the only way to run a successful business--in fact, it's a nearly 100 percent Microsoft software operation. [...]
<p>
JetBlue, which operates one of just a few profitable airlines, saw its operating revenue jump 96 percent year over year in the fourth quarter and more than 98 percent for 2002 compared with the previous year. [...]
<p>
Cohen's organization would like to take some credit for those margin gains. <b>By standardizing on one operating system and using other Microsoft software, the JetBlue CIO says he cut the company's technical staff by 50 percent.</b> Electronic publishing of pilot manuals, which are available on a cockpit laptop, also helps cut costs. For Cohen, standardization of information technology, like the approach to the planes, is helping to keep JetBlue in the black when other airlines fly in the red.

<br>
(emphasis added)
</blockquote>
How do you argue with that logic?  IT departments don't exist to keep Sun, IBM, Oracle or Microsoft in the black.  They exist to manage corporate information technology and enable the business to function.  
<p>
Microsoft is the only IT vendor that aims to offer a standardized solution for the entire enterprise -- from the palmtop and the laptop to the backoffice server clusters.  (Don't even <i>think</i> about telling me that Linux hits all of those targets -- we all know that Linux is anything <i>but</i> standardized.)  In a sense, they're also the only IT vendor who sees this problem and aims to solve it.  Sun?  Java?  They only address aspects of the problem -- commoditize the OS until it's a non-issue.  But the CIO needs to worry about managing every OS installed in his enterprise...
<p>
Do the gains from a single standard platform outway the costs of using better technology?  Sure, there are risks to homogeneity, and yes, there are more security issues than average when dealing with Microsoft software.  But none of those risks will ever go away; they can only be hedged.  So if you're willing to pay all of those costs, do you <i>still</i> come out ahead by standardizing <i>everything</i> on a single platform?</p>

<h3><a href="/user/barries/">barries</a> on 2003-04-23T15:21:33</h3>
I have several for-profit and nonprofit clients that feel exactly the same way.  It's partly about lock-in (@required_software is <i>only</i> supported on Windows), partly about interoperability (I need to exchange MS documents with other divisions/companies/people), partly about familiarity (I <i>know</i> Windows/Word/Excel/etc) and partly about acheiving economies of scale (I only need to send my people to one training classes, I only need one person on pager duty, I can hire consultants more easily, etc).  Oh, and then there's the fact that there are no OSS office tools that really work well enough yet for the average office worker.  Nothing has yet matched the speed, stability, and usability of MSOffice's most common functions, let alone the larger number of infrequent but in use features (like tables, etc).  Yes OSS has alternatives, but they aren't nearly as mature; it would be surprising if they were after the much smaller amounts of calandar time, developer manhours, and user feedback they've had.

<p>Naively, I thought my NPOs would be interested in OSS ("Linux" in their minds, primarily) for cost reasons.  Not so: they get big breaks from MS and sometimes even sets of free licenses.

</p><p>The for-profit people, some of whom are keenly aware of OSS availability and its possible benefits, need to keep streamlined and not get distracted from their busniness goals; they must avoid the overhead and riskiness of trying to marshall disparate semicompatible systems and applications.  And often there is a groundswell of OSS lovin' going on amongst the rank and file so training and expertise isn't really the issue; it's maintaining efficiency and focus.

</p><p>These are not the organizations for whom cutting from 50 NT admins to 10 Unix admins might be cost effective (if you overlook all the user retraining for the non-admins), these are representatives of the huge number of small and medium size organizations that absolutely cannot afford the increased TCO of OSS software.  Yes the TCO might be lower if they didn't already have/know/interoperate-with MS products, but that's not the real world.

</p><p>I would positively <i>love</i> to push/pull/help my clients towards OSS, but there are very few for whom it actually makes sense.  Even I end up having to use MSOffice event to read some clients' documents, OpenOffice is just not compatible enough with it.  It <i>is</i> getting much, much better, but I can't cut over to it all the way, I launch it about 20% of the time instead of using Word, but I cannot author or edit in it without frequently ruining the<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.doc file in one way or another.  Word's file formats are such a piece of crap that it'll be stunning when we really get other apps to reliably work with them.

</p><p>Sigh.  Enough negativity for one day.  Back to work...</p>

Good project management and good people on the shop floor will lead to profits. Using Linux could make both of these easier but isn't magic pixie dust. Windows can make this easier or harder depending on how lucky or fault tolerant you are.
<p>
I think these guys should be talking about their project management rather than their windows standardisation which usually only really offers benefits to a handful of middle management and purchasing suits.

Linux offers benefits closer to the shop floor that these people often don't notice. I know this because I have seen it in several different companies varying from global corporations to cowboy MCP shops as well as a variety of companies in between.

<blockquote><div> <i>

</i> </div></blockquote>
Yes, and it appears that he made a sound business decision, based on a handful of objective metrics that impact the bottom line.  He's bucking the common wisdom that (1) you <i>need</i> multiple platforms to run an enterprise and (2) an all Microsoft shop is a solution for managers who don't know any better.  These were conscious decisions he took for JetBlue, and interestingly enough, it seems to be having a net positive impact on the bottom line.

<blockquote><div> <i>

</i> </div></blockquote>
You seem to be missing the point here.  Internally, JetBlue is in a better position if it standardizes on a single platform: A320 and Microsoft Windows being two examples.  The trickledown reduction in complexity for the organization in terms of training, support and parts inventory directly impacts the bottom line.  This kind of standardization allows the organization to be leaner and more frugal.
<p>
Forget about Windows for a moment.  The same things would be true of an organization that standardizes on RedHat + MySQL + Apache + Perl + KDE, if such a stack were comparable to everything Microsoft offers today.  However, there is no single-vendor end-to-end stack available today, except from Microsoft.  The issue is less about Microsoft than it is about standardizing on a single platform across the enterprise.

</p><blockquote><div> <i>

</i> </div></blockquote>
The function of a CIO is to keep the IT infrastructure humming so that the business can do its job.  There's a factor of active planning involved, and a much larger factor of day-to-day management and budget management.  As a CIO, I would be remiss in my duty to the shareholders if I architected a large, complex, costly multivendor IT infrastructure that is unnecessarily complex and does not outperform a simpler one infrastructure.
<p>
Hypothetical arguments that my costs may be more in the future do not help a CIO do his job (and contain costs) today.  Things move slowly in this industry, and if something comes to pass that one or more of my platforms becomes a liability (higher costs, greater insecurity), then a good CIO will address those issues <i>if and when they come up</i>.
</p><p>
The received wisdom in IT planning is that you absolutely need heterogeneity in IT.  JetBlue is questioning that assertion, and it sounds like they're coming out ahead (if the nonexistant numbers are to be believed).  That is, they're accepting the risks of a single vendor solution and the security risks of Microsoft products, and realizing their cost savings in reduced staffing, training and inventory.

</p><blockquote><div> <i>
You can standardize on MS clients, Unix or IBM Mainframes in the back office and Palm on the palmtops and have similar cost savings.

</i> </div></blockquote>
That's just more received wisdom.  This article claims that assertion, although widely believed, is wrong.  Or at least not universally true.

<blockquote><div> <i>

Again, a CIO does not run his business on hypotheticals, but on risk management.  It's not 1995 anymore.  And Microsoft is arguably more interested in staying at the leading edge of the curve than, say, HPaq or Sun.

</i> </div></blockquote>
I'll grant that this article is hardly brimming with real information.  Yet I still find myself intrigued with the idea that eliminating non-MS platforms from an enterprise could <i>possibly</i> reduce overall IT costs.  Specifically, that the same economic factors that aid jetBlue and Southwest to save money by standardizing on a single model of aircraft may also be a factor in IT.

<blockquote><div> <i>
If Linux/Apache delivers better price/performance for Web-based apps, as even a Microsoft funded study shows, other non-Microsoft funded research shows a tremendous savings.

</i> </div></blockquote>
Looking at costs at the micro level, you can certainly save money on a per-function basis.  What this CIO is saying is that there are <i>greater</i> costs to be saved at the macro level by standardizing on an all-Microsoft platform from stem to stern.  And that's something I've not heard <i>anyone</i> assert before.  Usually, the justification for an all-Microsoft enterprise is much weaker, focusing on inconsequential issues like size of the developer pool, cost of the hardware, or "betting on a market leader".
<p>
I've worked in predominantly MS shops and in mixed shops.  In the mostly MS shops, it <i>is</i> expensive to introduce the auxiliary platforms, whether it is Netware, Linux/BSD or commercial Unix.  In the mixed shops, I've also seen that the number of admins and related costs do increase compared to a homogeneous environment.  So, in my experience, the cost drivers this article cites are real, and I'm inclined to believe that these cost savings are possible.
</p><p>
Of course, the devil is in the details.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)
</p><blockquote><div> <i>

Yes, and neither Yahoo nor Google are remotely similar to jetBlue.  Both of those companies view technology as a core competency, not a support function.  jetBlue's experiences, if repeatable, are not a blueprint for a new IT management plan for every company on the planet.
<p>
Merrill Lynch has come to similar conclusions.  However, they have years of legacy systems to manage and maintain.  Their current view is that a monoculture is bad for a variety of reasons, but a large number of supported platforms is tantamount to anarchy.  They aim to standardize on 4-6 platforms to (1) reduce management costs, (2) provide a healthy mix of environements for a variety of uses and (3) arbitrage vendors against each other.  But ML is in a different space that either Google, Yahoo! and jetBlue.  You should expect that they have different needs and come to different conclusions.</p>

To some extent, he's right.
<p>
First, concede the desktop.  Windows, Office, VisualStudio, Outlook, etc. are the corporate standard in 99.44% of the corporate world.
</p><p>
Next, the department level.  Standard capabilities like file/print sharing, email and web serving can be performed by anything slightly more powerful than a PalmOS device.  Most companies standardize on Windows here out of ignorance; jetBlue sounds like they're standardizing here on a worse-is-better line of reasoning.  Sure, it'd be better to run these services on Solaris, Linux or whathaveyou, but that introduces costly complexities into the IT space; standardizing on Windows reduces costs.
</p><p>
Finally, there are the "enterprise applications".  This is the weakest link in the chain, where most serious businesses start to deploy Solaris if they haven't done so already.  Again, this CIO is using a worse-is-better line of reasoning; better to use VisualStudio to develop and Win2K to deploy and make your developers fungible within the organization.  The alternative?  Two (or more) tiers of developers introducing redundancies and inefficiencies in the IT structure.  Oh, and vendors provide solutions on Windows or they go with another vendor; he stated that there were instances where Oracle-on-Windows was required for some application or another.

<tt>&lt;devils-advocate&gt;</tt> <br>
<i>Vendors</i> in general are subject to this behavior.  There is no guarantee that a multi-vendor environment will prevent these missteps from occurring.  For example, would swapping out Microsoft's CMS for Zope or Vignette make your website any easier to maintain in three years time?  Probably not.

(I'm explicitly ignoring concerns like uptime, security holes, scalability and size of the admin staff to run a network like this.  I presume the jetBlue CIO is doing the same.)

I think you're overstating the case here.  Incompatibility isn't the only driver here; adding features (and fixing last year's mistakes) are another significant profit center.

Of course there are significant risks to a single vendor approach, because their interests are certainly not aligned with yours.  Yet, with all of the arguments against single vendor shops, I'm intrigued that there's even the remote possibility that an all Microsoft shop could be more cost effective than a typical heterogeneous shop.

I'm much more familiar with their older, more fascile arguments in favor of an all Microsoft shop: easier to find (certified) staff to run your shop (everyone uses the stuff), cheap body of labor to draw from (from oversupply), cost savings through cheaper hardware, easier to develop applications through wizzy tools and wizards.
