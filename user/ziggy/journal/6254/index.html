<em>If you were given the choice between falafel and gefilte fish,
           which would you choose?</em>
<p>Ful mdamas, Egyptian style, with FEESTFULLS of cumin.  And bring extra pitas and olive oil.  Chop-chop!  I'm hungry!</p>

Yes, but what kind of <i>pita</i> do you want with that?
<p>
There are about a dozen different kinds of pita that are made in Israel.  The kind that we Mericans know as pita is the dominant one made by the Israelis (and by the pita bakers in the arab quarters in the old city of Jerusalem).
</p><p>
There's a bedouin recipe that I've tried, cooked on the back of a wok of all things (just a handy, cheap, mass-produced metallic cooking surface) that's served (er, thrown) and eaten as soon as its ready.  Then there's the Druise style that's made like a big (14"?), extremely thin pancake and rolled up like a tortilla.  Neither of these pitas have pockets.
</p><p>
To me, these differences are one of the most interesting things about pita, just like the variation in falafel (<i>foul</i>, chickpea or otherwise) and tabouli (a cracked wheat salad with a touch of parsley, or a parsley salad with a touch of cracked wheat?).</p>

I had no idea that there were so many kinds.  I want them all!



<h2>Tabbouleh</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/pdcawley/">pdcawley</a> on 2002-07-11T04:24:26</h3>
Personally I'm in the 'parsley salad with a touch of cracked wheat' school of thought. And a gallon of olive oil, and unripened grape juice instead of lemon juice...

<h2>Mm, Falafel...</h2>

<p>
I actually learned how to make falafel in Bethlehem, Israel.  (I'd never had it in the US before then).  If I could find good pita bread in the Portland/Beaverton area, I'd make it more often.
