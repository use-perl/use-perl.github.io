<p>In Software Carpentry, Pete McBreen highly recommended Brian Marick's <a href="http://www1.fatbrain.com/asp/bookinfo/bookinfo.asp?theisbn=0131774115&from=TBJ817">The Craft of Software Testing</a>.  So, I've been hunting for it for about two months now.  Surely I could have just ordered it online, but where's the fun in that?
<p>
In the process, I learned a couple of tidbits about the book industry.  This title was published in 1997 by Prentice Hall. Since it's about 2+ years old, and since it typically sells less than 1 copy per week, it's not kept in stock at either of the major bookstores (although they *can* order it for you...).<p>
My quest to find the title on a real live bookshelf led me to <a href="http://www.reiters.com/">Reiter's Books</a> on K St. in Washington, DC.  It reminds me of what a good bookstore Quantuum used to be back in the day.  (Quantum used to have a store on the University of Pennsylvania campus, a long time ago; my last trip to Quantum in Cambridge, MA was quite depressing; an entire "room" of the store was dedicated to Microsoft and certification titles; there was an entire bookshelf dedicated to K&amp;R, lots of obscure titles that used to be there were strangely missing, and lots of bookshelves were strangely devoid of books...)</p>
