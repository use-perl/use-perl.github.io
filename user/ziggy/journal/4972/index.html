<p><a href="http://lambda.weblogs.com">Lambda the Ultimate</a> had an interesting story <a href="http://lambda.weblogs.com/2002/05/15">yesterday</a> about domain-specific languages.  
<ul>
<li>Bad news: it was done with PowerPoint.</li>
<li>Good news: the presentation was converted to HTML</li>
<li>Bad news: That interface sucks; it's slow, it requires scrolling in my rather large mozilla window, and it's slow to click back and forth between slides</li>
<li>Good news: Perl to the rescue!</li>
</ul>
This little hack takes individual, interleaved GIF slides and turns them into a much more user-friendly PDF:
<pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl -w

use strict;
use PDFLib;

my $pdf = new PDFLib (
				filename    => "slides.pdf",
				papersize   => "letter",
				orientation => "landscape",
				creator     => "Paul Hudak",
				title       => "The Promise of Domain Specific Languages",
);

foreach (<*.gif>) {
	my ($stem) = m/(.*?).gif/;

	print STDERR "$stem\n";
	`convert $stem.gif $stem.png`;

	my $img = $pdf->load_image(filetype => "png", filename => "$stem.png",);
	$pdf->start_page();
	$pdf->add_image(img => $img, x => 0, y => 0);
	$pdf->end_page();

	unlink ("$stem.png");
}
</pre>
<b>Many</b> thanks to Matt Sergeant for the PDFLib module.  I actually spent more time looking at the module documentation than I did writing and testing this code.  :-)
<p>
Now back to that presentation about DSLs...</p>

Excellent idea! Those types of GIF'd presentations always annoyed me - it never occured to me to use my own code to create PDF's.<br> <br>My only sadness about PDFLib is that I can't freely use the underlying library pdflib in a commercial setting. I wish there were a complete free alternative. I hade a look at the PDF spec a few weeks ago (in a book available from Adobe) and it's a bit heavyweight, so I won't be writing an XS module just yet<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)<br> <br>Oh yeah, that and I can't get it to do Unicode, no matter how hard I try.

I vaguely remember a discussion about this a few months ago.  What are the issues involved?  According to the <a href="http://www.pdflib.com/pdflib/business.html" title="pdflib.com">business topics</a pdflib.com> page, the only commercial issues involve shipping commercial products that incorporate PDFlib.  Use in a commercial setting seems OK.
<p>
As to the PDF spec, it's dense, but comprehesible.  There's a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0201101793" title="amazon.com">lot</a amazon.com> of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0201379228" title="amazon.com">prior</a amazon.com> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0201143968" title="amazon.com">art</a amazon.com> involved as well, so PDF falles under the "exceedingly well documented" umbrella (modulo PDF Forms).  If only that were true of RTF, which looks like a TeX-influenced bad acid trip, with a spec (v1.5) that's about as clear (once you pry it away from its forgotten ghetto of the web).</p>

You can't run a web site where you make money that uses PDFLib. Their license forbids it (obviously unless you have a commercial license from them). I think this makes axkit.org actually illegal, since I host ads there (I should remove them since they pay so little) and I serve presentations generated with AxPoint.

There seems to be lots of <a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?mode=module&amp;query=pdf" title="cpan.org">PDF modules on cpan</a cpan.org> including:
<ul> <li> <a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?dist=PDF-API2" title="cpan.org">PDF::API2</a cpan.org> </li>
<li> <a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?dist=PDF-Create" title="cpan.org">PDF::Create</a cpan.org> </li>
<li> <a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?dist=Text-PDF" title="cpan.org">Text::PDF</a cpan.org> </li>
</ul>
I looked over these a few months back and found the lack of documentation and examples quite daunting. I can't use PDFLib due as everything I do at work is in a commerical setting<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) Has anyone had any luck with these modules?
<p>
On reading and working with existing PDFs I've actually had more luck using
<a href="http://freshmeat.net/projects/pdftohtml/" title="freshmeat.net">pdftohtml</a freshmeat.net> (not to be confused with <a href="http://freshmeat.net/projects/pdf2html/" title="freshmeat.net">pdf2html</a freshmeat.net>!) and then post-processing using HTML::TreeBuilder.</p>
