This just in from the Philp K. Dick desk: a movie rendition of <a href="http://www.philipkdick.com/films_scanner.html">A Scanner Darkly</a> (starring Neo) is due out next Spring.

(But why did they have to cast Neo?)

I would give a great deal to ANY Philip K. Dick movie adaptation done well.<p>
Androids Dream of Bladerunners was <i>close</i>... but I'm snooty.</p>

The time is just about right to do a decent scramble suit for <i>A Scanner Darkly</i>, but that is one of the least important parts of the book.
</p> <p>
We have the technology to do a great version of <i>Maze of Death</i>.  Even as a one-hour (er, 44 minute) story as something Twilight Zone-ish.  Sadly, we don't have the will.  Not in the current political climate.

Strangely enough, it seems that all these recent horrible Dick adaptations have been from his (relatively) shorter stories.<p>
Based on that - there's a <i>chance</i> that A Scanner Darkly could be a better movie than some of the others.</p><p>

Actually, Total Recall didn't completely suck.  The short story didn't have as much of the phildickian ending that the movie did.  And so what if they had to make it a summer blockbuster?  They had to improvise a whole heckuva lot.

It's been back in print for a decade, so it should be easy to find new, used or in a library.  Go treat yourself.  It's a quick read and the ending is very phildickian, with more of a twist than Ubik.

If (if) you can ignore the fact that your eyeballs don't go that far out of your head without also assuring... death.

It was a summer action flick based on a Dick story.
<p>
I'll ignore the factual errors like the exploding eyeballs, just as easily as I'll ignore the fact that dust devils the size of Rhode Island didn't prevent colonization, and that Quaid could hop on the next shuttle to Mars, be unnoticed by the Federal authorities during boarding and transit, and still arrive mere hours after he departs.
</p><p>
(OK, I'll admit, that was an exaggeration.  The dust devils on Mars are only a few football fields across.  They're about as <i>tall</i> as Rhode Island is wide.)</p>

<h2>Darkly</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/pudge/">pudge</a> on 2005-08-09T17:34:26</h3>
I didn't know about it until someone mentioned it to me after I posted about my recent recording of <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/pudge/" title="mac.com">Through a Glass Darkly</a mac.com>, whose titles are based on the same scriptural reference.<br><br>Anyway, I don't know if I could watch a 2-hour A-Ha video.  Have you seen the preview for this movie?  It is taking all the film from the actors and animating on top of it, like a color version of Take On Me.<br>

It's got Neo.  It doesn't matter if they're using the A-Ha effect.  It's got Neo.  If
Kurosawa or Hitchcock rose from the dead to direct the greatest story ever told, and cast Neo in a starring role, it would <i>still</i> be unwatchable.

No, but check it: he is ANIMATED.  They can make him ACT DIFFERENTLY.  OK, it is still his voice, but they can change anything about how he LOOKS!<br>

No amount of A-Ha effects can make Neo act.  Cast him in any role, and there's that unspoken tension that his next line is going to be <i>Whoa, I know kung fu!</i>.  The best role he could possibly land is if casting sent someone like Noah Wyle to take his place.
