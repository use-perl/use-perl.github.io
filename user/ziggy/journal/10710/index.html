<p>Here's a quick trivia question for the US crowd:
<p>
<b>Question 1 (3 pts. each):</b>
<blockquote>
Name the original seven Baby Bells created after the AT&T breakup.
</blockquote>
<b>Bonus Question (4 pts):</b>
<blockquote>
There are now 4 Baby Bells.  Name them, along with the original Baby Bells they ate up.
</blockquote>
Good luck!  No searching!
<p>
&nbsp;
<p>
<b>Update:</b> +18 pts to prakash.
<p>
The original 7 Baby Bells were:  
Ameritech,  
Bell Atlantic,  
Bellsouth,  
NYNEX,  
Pacific Telesis,  
Southwestern Bell,  
and US West.  They have currently merged and morphed to form Bellsouth (still on its own), Verizon (Bell Atlantic and NYNEX), SBC (Southwestern Bell and Pacific Telesis) and Qwest (US West and Ameritech).</p>

Original Baby bells:
<ul>
 <li>Ameritech</li>
 <li>Bell Atlantic</li>
 <li>Bellsouth</li>
 <li>NYNEX</li>
 <li>Pac Bell</li>
 <li>Southwestern Bell</li>
 <li>US West</li>
</ul><br/><br/>Current Baby Bells:
<ul>
 <li>Bellsouth</li>
 <li>Verizon (Bell Atlantic, NYNEX)</li>
 <li>Pac Bell (US West)</li>
 <li>Southwestern Bell</li>
</ul><br/><br/>For some reason, I seem to think GTE is in the picture somewhere, but can't figure it out. I think Verizon ate Bell Atlantic + GTE.

Close.  +18 on the original baby bells; Pac Bell wasn't a baby bell.
<p>
+2 on the current baby bells: Bellsouth is still on its own, and Verizon is the new name for the post-merger Bell Atlantic (Bell Atlantic and NYNEX morphed into the New, Improved Bell Atlantic years ago).
</p><p>
GTE was never a baby bell; they were always GTE, not a post-merger AT&amp;T spinoff.  And they were eaten up by Verizon/Bell Atlantic some years ago (I forget which <i>nom de plume</i> they used during the acquisition).
</p><p>
5 pts still up for grabs.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>

And it was C&amp;P before it was Bell Atlantic.  Maybe it stood for Chesapeake and Potomac?

Perhaps I just want it to be something of a pun, but wasn't Bellsouth named 'Southern Bell' when it was spun-off?

Maybe you're thinking of Taco Bell?

Somewhere in the mix was a company called C&amp;W (originally Cables and Wireless).

As far as I know, Cable and Wireless is the English version AT&amp;T.  They made their money financing the laying of the first trans-atlantic cables for telegraphs and eventually telephones.
