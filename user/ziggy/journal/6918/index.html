<div class="span8">
<p>I recently got a copy of <a href="http://www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/unix_apps_utilities/finkcommander.html">FinkCommander</a>, and I've been installing more UNIX packages on the iBook.  Today, I managed to install <a href="http://www.gnome.org/gnome-office/dia.shtml"><tt>dia</tt></a>.  <p>
I think I remember seeing a few people mention <tt>dia</tt> as a tool used in making line drawings for presentations, so I thought I'd give it a spin.  
<p>
<i>What</i> was I thinking.
<p>
I must have decided to install <tt>dia</tt> before it hit me that it's a component in Gnome Office.  Sure enough, installing <tt>dia</tt> installed all of its dependencies, including a decent chunk of Gnome (or at least the foundation libraries).  It seems to have worked OK.  <tt>dia</tt> does in fact appear to be installed properly, after what felt like a day's worth of compiling to install the dozens of packages that were required just to get <tt>dia</tt> to compile....
<p>
&nbsp;
<p>
Oh, and here was an interesting twist in the middle of the process.  I had upgraded <tt>bash</tt> earlier today, and then proceeded to upgrade one of its dependencies (I forget if this was intentional or unintentional...).  Lo and behold, a few hours later, neither Terminal.app nor <tt>xterm</tt> could bring up a terminal window -- bash had a dynamic linking error that prevented it from running.
<p>
Thankfully, Terminal.app can override the login shell (tweaking NetInfo didn't seem to work) to something a little more sane (like <tt>/bin/sh</tt>).  A simple <tt>fink rebuild bash</tt> did indeed fix the problem, once I managed to figure out what was going on...
<p>
I think it's time to take a big step away from computers for a while.  I feel like I've developed a magnetic personality that's only drawing out the worst in software at the moment...</p>
