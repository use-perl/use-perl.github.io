<p>Suppose you have two weeks to spend in France, but not in Paris.  You cannot visit the whole country, but can only visit one region.  (Just for kicks, let's say it's two weeks in mid-July.)
<p>
Where do you go?</p>

I would go see <a href="http://www.belle-ile.net/" title="belle-ile.net">Le Festival de Belle Ile</a belle-ile.net>, which I think is producing <i>Die Zauberflote next summer.<br> <br>Other than that, I would stalk Lance Armstrong as he wins his sixth tour.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)</i>



<h2>Champagne</h2>

Of course, nothing better to do than drink champagne for a couple of weeks!



<h2>A partial advice</h2>

First, avoid the French Riviera.<p>Then, this depends on what you'd prefer to do -- sea? mountain? visit a city? eat a lot?</p>

Surely.  And unless you were totally unreasonable, you'd have an excellent time Brittany, Normandy, the South of France, Burgundy, or wherever you happen to find yourself.
<p>
So, my question remains, where would you want to spend two weeks in July in France?
</p><p>
(The question is purely hypothetical.  brian's going to be off the coast of Brittany, and it got me thinking that there are a lot more to France than Paris.)</p>

I hear ya there!

<p>I have relations who live there.  I love to see them, but I can't stand the place.  Other (english) people seem to find this somewhat unbelievable...

<h2>Where ever you want</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ajt/">ajt</a> on 2004-01-24T10:36:13</h3>
<p>Take your pick: mountains; coastline; wine regions; busy places; quiet places; hot places or cooler places...</p>

<p>France is a good size, and it's various regions are quite distict, and attractive in their own right. It all depends what you want to do. While you should be able to find good food and wine just about anywhere, and pretty countryside and things to do, it helps to know what you would like to do with your time, so that a good suggestion can be made.</p>

The Dordogne is <a href="http://www.regard-it.com/dordogne.htm" title="regard-it.com">beautiful</a regard-it.com>.

Strasbourg<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... but wait that's Germany<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... no it's France<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... no it's Germany. Okay right now in history it's in France but you never know what tomorrow may bring.



<h2>Loire Valley?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/grantm/">grantm</a> on 2004-01-25T09:38:05</h3>
<p>I enjoyed the Loire Valley.</p>

<p>I have a friend who had a great time doing a self-drive canal boat holiday in France (not sure where exactly).</p>
