<p>Paul Graham's <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/usa.html">latest essay</a> 
is out.  This time, he's trying to explain to his Japanese audience why
Americans do some things well (movies, software) and some things poorly
(cars, roads, houses).  
<p>
You can look at this as a pessimist, as a litany of things that
Paul thinks Americans do poorly.  I'm reading it as a set of
guideposts on things we Americans (and we programmers) should best
avoid.  Americans don't have a culture that values craftsmanship
that creates artifacts still prized 800 years after manufacture
(compared to Japanese swords of the 1200s), or design that demands
uncompromising attention and skill (like Japanese wood joinery).  But
we're a veritable font of creative artifacts -- including software.
<p>
We do things well when we solve a problem quickly and move
on.  That model works well for software, but less so for things like 
cars, bridges and homes.  As programmers, we are at our best when we
solve a problem and solve it quickly, instead of trying to build
"elegant" design in code that is overly complex, buggy and generally solve 
the wrong problem, poorly.
<p>
<small>
(Funny, Perl encourages us to play to these strengths, and avoid
these weaknesses.  Unlike, say, C++.  ;-)

A good accompanying talk on the 'focus groups result in crappy design' is from Malcolm Gladwell <a href="http://www.itconversations.com/shows/detail230.html" title="itconversations.com">Human Nature</a itconversations.com>.

You started making some good points, but I lost interest and didn't read to the end.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)
