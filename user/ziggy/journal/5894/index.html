So-called power sellers, those who average above a certain amount in monthly sales, are the backbone of eBay's auction business, CEO Meg Whitman said this weekend at the eBay Live conference, the company's first-ever user conference.
<p>
"Many power sellers are self-employed eBay merchants. Sometimes it's both husband and wife," she said. "That leaves our family entrepreneurs at a serious disadvantage when it comes to acquiring health care coverage for their families."
<p>
Starting this fall, the San Jose, Calif.-based company will allow power sellers to acquire health care coverage, including dental, vision and pharmacy, through a deal eBay has struck with Physician's Mutual.

Why do you think this is a bad thing?

It just seems odd to me that (1) selling stuff on eBay has become a full-time job (2) to a significant number of people (3) that eBay wants to actively encourage.  Health insurance is just the latest link (and most interesting wrinkle) in that chain.
<p>
I remember the good ol' eBay, the site where everyone could make money by snail-mailing kidneys and other accumulated cruft from the garage, attic and closet to the four corners of the earth.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>

What's stopping you?  In fact, you have an advantage over these power sellers in that you already have Health Insurance, I would guess, so you don't have that additional overhead to pay for when you go to sell on eBay.<br> </p><p>I think professional sellers on eBay is a really good thing.  I usually find that I get better service from professionals, when they are available.  OTOH, the small, unprofessional, seller has small overheads and you can often get good deals there, too.</p>

I guess I have a different perspective on it, since my wife's aunt and uncle do most of their business on ebay. They're antique (and etc.) dealers, and ebay has been a huge boon to them. Having just looked them up, they seem to <a href="http://cgi6.ebay.com/aw-cgi/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewSellersOtherItems&amp;userid=macstrell@pathway.net&amp;completed=0&amp;sort=3&amp;since=-1&amp;include=0&amp;page=1&amp;rows=25" title="ebay.com">qualify</a ebay.com> as "power sellers", and being able to get cheaper insurance would be helpful. (Assuming that this insurance would be cheaper, that is.)

Hrm.  Guess I'm just feeling a little more hypocritical than usual today.
<p>
I've never had a problem with brick-and-mortar stores turning to the web as a way to increase sales and turnover.  There was a used bookstore I used to frequent, and they would have been out of business had it not been for Amazon.com (and ABEBooks, and eBay, and<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...) making more used book sales than would have been possible for a little shop.  That's what the web is *supposed* to be about.
</p><p>
OTOH, that's not the typical image I have in mind when someone says "eBay Power Seller".  That term conjures up the image of a raw arbitrageur: someone who buys any kind of random cheap stuff in bulk only to turn it around for a profit on eBay.  Booksellers and antique dealers don't fall into that stereotype (they buy books and antiques, respectively).
</p><p>
Maybe it's time for me to pull out the great Randall vs. Dante debate: <i>Does title dictate behavior</i>?</p>
