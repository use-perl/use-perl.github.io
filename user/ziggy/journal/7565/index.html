<p>Anyone here ever hear about <a href="http://www.sdforum.org/">SDForum</a>?  It's a for-pay non-profit Sillicon Valley business/technology networking group.  They have regular monthly meetings about such varied topics as Wireless, Java, Venture Capital, and Security.  That's not counting the special events and seminars.
<p>
William Grosso has been talking about it over at <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/">O'Reillynet</a>.  There's something vaguely similar (and likely much older) in New York City with NYPC; their C/C++ SIG (now C++/Java SIG) is about as active as SDForum, with something like 20 meetings a month on programming topics alone.  (I never did find out what the rest of NYPC did...)
<p>
Is there a big technology networking group like SDForum in your town?  Or do you have just the oddball LUG and Perl Mongers group?</p>

<h2>Pittsburgh Technology Council</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/barries/">barries</a> on 2002-09-06T14:42:40</h3>
We've got a similar organization here: <a href="http://www.pghtech.org/" title="pghtech.org">Pittsburgh Technology Council</a pghtech.org> that also provides things like a group health plan for small tech companies that would be priced out of the market.

<p>I can't seem to get interested in having my consulting company join up because it seems like we'd spend a lot of time attending events instead of keeping the billable hours up.  But then I'm not trying to grow and grow and grow, so extensive marketing / networking holds little value for me as of yet.</p>



<h2>SD Forum</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/dws/">dws</a> on 2002-09-06T17:52:49</h3>
SD Forum used to be the Software Entrepenuer's Forum. They have monthly dinner talks, with the occassional interesting speaker. They also were the origin of a number of Silicon Valley SIGs. I used to go to meetings, but have trailed off as the talks got less interesting (to me). It's worth checking out if you're in the SF Bay Area.<br> <br>
