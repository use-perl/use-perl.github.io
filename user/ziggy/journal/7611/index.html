An item consists of a series of lines separated by "\n".

That just sounds like trouble to me. I personally think using XML is a good thing, it makes things easy.

Maybe if he was being sensible and talking about using YAML...

<h2>YAML</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ziggy/">ziggy</a> on 2002-09-09T02:55:44</h3>
At first, it sounded like YAML would have been a good fit.  But the YAML is 24 pages of spec-ese that's still being drafted.
<p>
There's something beneficial of making a ~five page <i>complete</i> spec that includes the file structure, semantic behavior and parsing rules.  It's also quite nice if you can write a parser in 1 line of Perl/Python for that format as well.
</p><p>
I agree with Aaron here.  If YAML is a goal, then the way to reach that goal is to engineer a YAML-compatible format, not mandate that RSS 3.0 is a YAML document per se (like RSS 0.9x-2.0 is an XML document).</p>

<h2>Re:YAML</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/gav/">gav</a> on 2002-09-09T03:22:40</h3>
I wasn't trying to suggest dropping XML and moving to YAML. I don't really care what format RSS uses, as long as it is something sensible. Using a format that somebody has already worked out (like XML) is a good thing. How many esoteric formats are already out there? Do we need another? I don't want to split on "\n" and worry that it might be "\r" or "\r\n" depending on the platform.
<p>
Whether RSS uses YAML or XML or something else, as long as there are tools out there that make it easy everything will work out.  Using <a href="http://search.cpan.org/author/EISEN/XML-RSS-0.96/RSS.pm" title="cpan.org">XML::RSS</a cpan.org> is easy. I don't have to write a parser and I shouldn't have to. The main advantage of XML as I see it is that adding fields in a later revision shouldn't break older clients.</p>
