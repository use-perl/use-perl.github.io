<div class="span8">
<p>I'm a big fan of having multiple Perl installations on a single system.  First, there's the default build on the system (5.005_03 under FreeBSD, 5.6.0 under OS X).  Next, there's the build I use on a regular basis (either 5.6.1 or 5.8.0 these days).
<p>
Then there are the one-off test builds I have in a home directory somewhere.  I like creating a <tt>test</tt> user with no privs to build and test a Perl configuration.  If I can run a program in that configuration, I know that my program is good to go on a stock build (or a build with a known minimalist configuration).  This helps me avoid problems where I forget a dependency and try to copy a module/script around.
<p>
I must be losing brain cells or something.  I've done this many times before, but today I spent a few hours trying to upgrade <tt>Bundle::CPAN</tt> on the distributions installed in <tt>/Users/test/...</tt>, and virtually every build was failing.  I soon found out that <tt>perl Makefile.PL</tt> was being built with <tt>/usr/bin/perl</tt>, not my private build.  Of course I could not update libraries in <tt>/System/Library</tt> or <tt>/Library</tt>; that's why all of the Perl libraries should be under <tt>/Users/test/lib</tt>.
<p>
Eventually, I found the source of the problem, stepping through <tt>CPAN.pm</tt>.  If <tt>CPAN.pm</tt> is invoked with a perl using a relative path, it looks for a perl with an absolute path and finds <tt>/usr/bin/perl</tt>, not my private build.  Running <tt>CPAN.pm</tt> with a fully qualified path to my local Perl (<tt>/Users/test/bin/perl -MCPAN -e shell</tt>) makes everything work just the way it should.
<p>
Somehow, I think I'll be forgetting this in a few weeks.  Maybe it's time to start taking that Ginko...</p>

<h2>I had that problem</h2>

<p>Submitted a fix to Jarkko for MakeMaker, it was fixed as of 5.6.1.  There may be another problem somewhere.  I remember that it related to abuses of parameters named PERL (which was supposed to refer to "any perl, possibly just a miniperl, of any version," but was used as if it was the perl to build with) and FULLPERL, which was supposed to be the actual perl you invoked.  I think I transformed a breadth-first search for "any perl," to a depth-first search to provoke it into finding the proper one more often, but that may not have been the 100% correct fix, and it may occur elsewhere besides MakeMaker.  (As seems to be your case with CPAN.pm)</p>

<p>Wow; something I actually knew a bit about.  That was the only patch I've ever submitted.</p>
