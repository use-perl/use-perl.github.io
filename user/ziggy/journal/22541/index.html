<p>As I mentioned <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/ziggy/journal/22476">previously</a>, I've been bitten by the <a href="http://www.davidco.com/">gtd bug</a>.  Specifically, I've succumb to the <a href="http://www.43folders.com/moleskines/index.html">Moleskine Fetish</a> strain of the virus.
<p>
The <a href="http://www.modoemodo.it/">manufacturers</a> of the Moleskine line of notebooks must have started a big marketing and distribution campaign in the US.  These notebooks were once hard to find, and now they're popping up everywhere.  (Some styles are still hard to come by, but you should be able to find <i>some</i> kind of moleskine in stock in most bookstores and better stationery stores here in the DC area.)  On the <a href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/43Folders/">43 folders</a> list, I've seen links to <a href="http://moleskineus.com/">vendors selling Moleskines</a> fly by, as if these things are hard to find online.
<p>
Silly me.  They're hard to find until you <a href="http://froogle.google.com/froogle?q=moleskine">actually bother to look for them</a>.  ;-)
<p>
Lest you think that the Moleskine fetish is a requirement for acquiring the gtd bug, let me heartily recommend the <a href="http://www.43folders.com/2004/09/introducing_the.html">Hipster PDA</a> -- a very efficent replacement for a Palm Pilot consisting of a pen, a binder clip, and a stack of index cards.  Sort of a 21st Century update of <tt>brian</tt>'s mid 1990's LoFi hack, the PAA[*].

I've had a moleskine for about a year now. I got it mostly for a place to dump thoughts. It's a very nice little notebook<br> <br>I'm in the early stages of the gtd infection. I haven't finished the book yet but I am hoping that it will help me reduce the mountain of work I have.



<h2>Hadn't heard of that...</h2>

I haven't heard of the "gtd bug", but my library does have his book, so I put a hold on it and will read that next (right after finishing "Snow Falling on Cedars").<br> <br>- Jason

Be prepared to put a hold on it again a few months after you read it.  A
lot of people on the 43folders list talk about how they keep a copy
handy for reference when they have questions.  David also recommends
reviewing gtd every six months or so, to clarify some points you may
have been unclear about before, or remind yourself of what else you need
to be doing.
<p>
Of course, that's a backdoor way for him to sell more books and
bump up his royalty checks.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)  But seriously though, it's a good
enough book (despite its flaws) that you probably want to have a
copy handy, whether you buy it in paperback, used, or just do your
best to take good notes while you're reading it.  If you need something
specific from the book, like the workflow diagrams, there are many
versions floating around the web.
</p><p>
Then again, I'll buy pretty much <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0865164193" title="amazon.com">any book</a amazon.com>, so take that with an appropriate amount of salt.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>
