<h1>England for the English!</h1>

<div class="span8">
<p><a href="http://use.perl.org/user/davorg/journal">davorg</a> introduced the first item on the Perl agenda for government: making all other programming languages illegal because they discriminate against programmers with dyslexia (see <a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?dist=Symbol-Approx-Sub">Symbol::Approx::Sub</a> for details).
<p>
I humbly propose the next item on the agenda: Keep England for the English!
<p>
This has nothing to do with evicting every immigrant that has relocated to the island of Great Britain since 1066.  It's much more serious, actually.  Consider the following examples of England's alleged modernity:
<ul>
<li>The path to Nelson's Column is surrounded by McDonalds franchisees</li>
<li>There are more Starbucks in Central London than Tim Horton's in Toronto or Montreal.</li>
<li>Pizza the Hut in Leicester Square.  Sacriledge.</li>
<li>It's easier to stop by a KFC or a Burger King on the way back from the pub than the local chip shop</li>
</ul>
...and don't get me started Englishmen drinking Budweiser or Miller High Life in a Pub.
<p>
Keep in mind, dear reader, that this is not a plea to retain the antiquated 20th Century trappings of English life.  Nor is it a movement to turn England into one big giant Royal Theme Park.  No, this is about keeping America in America and keeping England English.
<p>
Why, for example, does the English thirst for coffee need to be quenched by a bunch of Seattleites?  Why doesn't the Earl of Dwimsbury obtain a Royal Appointment to provide coffee to the Queen (and thereby parlay that into a chain of very successful coffee shops)?  If burgers and fries are an important part of English cuisine today, why must they come from McDonald's of San Diego and not from MacDuff's of Inverness?  
<p>
There is plenty of room for global brands in England -- even global American brands.  But not when every tied house is just down the road from Starbucks, McDonalds, Starbucks, Pizza Hut, Starbucks, Burger King, Starbucks and KFC....

<h2>beer</h2>

<p>I'm all for preventing that, as long as you don't expect us Americans to drink the stuff.  If you go too far with "keeping America in America and keeping England English", we won't be getting any more beer from the British Isles, and then where will we be?  I suppose it might encourage places to serve some of the good American beers, but I wouldn't want to bet on it.</p>

The good thing about America is that it is a melting pot (or a salad bowl, or whatever metaphor is P.C. this week).  So, while Lager is a German style that started in bohemia, it's been adopted and revised to be part of the American palate.  <a href="http://www.yardsbrewing.com/" title="yardsbrewing.com">English Ales</a yardsbrewing.com> are returning to the palate as well, so if we keep Budmilloors out of England, there's no reciprocal need to keep Fuller's, Bateman's and Young's out of America.

<h2>Programming languages</h2>

<p>:-P  I suppose you could drop programming languages created by employees of American space agencies, then.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>
