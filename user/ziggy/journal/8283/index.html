<div class="span8">
<p>I came across a web page a few years ago that talked about the unrealized promises of X Windows.  Ten+ years ago, X programs looked like crap because there weren't any good (open) X toolkits that were easy to code to.  As a result, there were all sorts of experimental prototypes like xedit, xrn, xman and the like.
<p>
The guy being interviewed (or the guy who wrote the page, I forget) talked about how the idea of window classes in X was set up so that you wouldn't have to roll your own text editor each time you needed to bring up an editing window -- you should just bring the user's preferred editor in a new window your application creates.  (This is the behavior people expect in a terminal window when applications respect the <tt>$EDITOR</tt> environment variable.)
<p>
Alas, no one figured out that was what X apps were supposed to be doing.  But the idea wasn't forgotten.  Now there's <a href="http://freehackers.org/kvim/index.html">KVim</a>, VIM integrated into KDE as a KPart.  The <a href="http://freehackers.org/kvim/screenshots.html">screenshots</a> show that the idea wasn't forgotten, and is indeed alive and well.</p>
