<p>Joel Spolsky has <a
href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/APIWar.html">written</a> a
longish piece on how Microsoft has planted the seeds of its own doom.

<p>

Executive Summary: Osbourne Syndrome writ large, running in slow motion.

<p> 

There are so many alternatives and initiatives in play for developers
writing apps for Windows that the whole thing is a wash.  If you're
developing software today, choose another platform that isn't anywhere
near as turbulent.

<p>

Side note: Microsoft's explosive growth wasn't from anything intrinsic
about their products.  It was good timing that was took advantage of the
exponential adoption of PCs in the 1980s/1990s.  When this year's PC
purchases exceeds the entire installed base, and when you target new PCs
almost exclusively, you have an excellent formula for success.  Convincing
that installed base to migrage or upgrade is a different matter entirely.

<h2>Good Article</h2>

I just read that article myself.  As I look around, if I had to pick a platform today to develop on, it would be (for all my bitching) Solaris - stable API, 64 bit OS, supports the latest Java (unlike FreeBSD, which is at 1.3.1 afaik), now runs on x86 or Sparc, seems to be more secure than Linux (general vibe - I have no hard evidence), good sysadmin tool support, scales well, reasonably good number of packages from blastwave.org (including Mozilla, OpenOffice and Evolution), can do the thin client thing, and has the warm, fuzzy corporate backing that so many PHB's need.
<p>
Oh, and if you still desperately need Windows, the Sunblades allow you do add a second motherboard, RAM and operating system via SunPCI rather than using emulation.</p>

<blockquote><div> <em>Most<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.NET developers are ASP.NET developers, developing for Microsoft's web server. ASP.NET is brilliant; I've been working with web development for ten years and it's really just a generation ahead of everything out there.

"ASP<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.NET is great!  I run it on my Linux server."
<p>
I'm sure that's exactly what MS wants to hear.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:D</p>

<p>Something I noticed, which no-one else has comented on. Joel says</p>
<blockquote><div>managed code languages (Java, PHP, Perl, even ASP.NET) </div></blockquote>
<p>Bah. Perl came third.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-(</p>
<p>Which is better than all the other languages he doesn't even mention. Perl is credible.</p>

Nobody has commented on it here, but Joel's article <i>is</i> getting wide
notice.

<p>

Some lisper <a href="http://cooking-with-lisp.blogspot.com/2004/06/joel-on-software-thinks-major.html" title="blogspot.com">noted</a blogspot.com>
the importance Joel placed on garbage collection to the exclusion of all
other techniques to "increase programmer productivity" -- OOP, AOP, UML,
Patterns, etc.  Quoting Joel:

</p><blockquote><div> <i>
    The real significant productivity advance we've had in programming
    has been from languages which manage memory for you automatically.
    It can be with reference counting or garbage collection; it can be
    Java, Lisp, Visual Basic (even 1.0), Smalltalk, or any of a number
    of scripting languages.
</i> </div></blockquote>

Perl didn't make <i>that</i> list, but the scentiment is still clear:
write in C (or FORTRAN) only when there are positively no other
alternatives, avoid C++ like the plague, and spend most of your time
working in a "better" language, regardless of how much others scorn it.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)

<p>

(I think he's understating the case, but that's me.  Yes, garbage
collection is the single most important feature, but the ability to program
at a higher level of abstraction is a close second, and something amazingly
difficult to quantify.)</p>

I think I'd agree with him; the GC is by far more important than OO techniques.<br/><br/>One can implement a "good enough" form of objects  and patterns in C; see GTK+, for example.  But GC is a killer language feature that's not so easy.
