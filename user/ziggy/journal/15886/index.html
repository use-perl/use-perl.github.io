<p>I've tried to play my iPod through my stereo, and it always sounded like total crap.  Too loud, scratchy, and it sounded like it was muffled by a few feet of cardboard.  Line in, headphone jack, no difference.  (But the headphone jack sounded about 5% less crappy.)
<p>
This patch cord used to work perfectly with a CD player, but it's been a long time since I used it.  The iPod works fine, so I started to suspect a bad cord.  Just for kicks, I used another cord (going into another input), and it sounded <i>wonderful</i>.  Using the bad connection on the XM tuner make it sound like crap, too.  Progress!
<p>
Just for kicks, I switched inputs, and identified the problem: the phono input.  Switching the patch cord to another open input fixed everything.  Who'd'a thunk it?
<p>
Now for the $64 question.  Is the phono input specially calibrated to receive input from a turntable (doubtful), or do I just have a bad set of inputs (probable)?

In other news, <a href="http://www.slimdevices.com/">Slim Devices</a> upgraded their SliMP3 and came up with the Squeezebox.  The SliMP3 was a cute idea -- a networked stereo component that played streaming MP3s from a server somewhere in the house, but it was wired.  The Squeezebox fixes this design flaw -- it can receive streams over wired ethernet or WiFi.  </p>

That URL gives me an error ("Redirection limit for this URL exceeded").
<p>But anyway: phono is indeed only for turntables. Why? Because it contains a special preamp, turning the phono signal into a normal audio signal.
</p><ul> <li>A turntable element reurns a very feeble signal: a few mV typically &mdash; roughly the level of a microphone. Normal audio jacks expect a signal of 100mV to 500mV, approximately, which is what normal audio equipment, tuner, cassette tape player, CD, deliver. So the preamp needs to boost the signal by about a factor of 50-100. That's a <em>lot</em>. Any other input, like from the iPod, will most likely be much too too strong for this input, resulting in a heavily distorted signal.</li>
<li>Phono signals require a special equalization: bass needs an extra boost, higher tones need to be weakened. This correction is known as the "RIAA correction". You can see a nice graph <a href="http://www.euronet.nl/user/mgw/background/riaa/uk_riaa_background_1.html" title="euronet.nl"> here, under point 3</a euronet.nl>, showing both a theoretical approximation (straight lines), and the practical EQ (curve). So even a good microphone, when connected through the phono input, would sound like crap, because of this.</li>
</ul>
<p>I found a rather nice explanation <a href="http://emerson.fas.harvard.edu/heck/components.php" title="harvard.edu">here</a harvard.edu> (subsection "Phono Pre-amplifiers").</p>
