It's 03.09.06 (in American terms at least), so it's time for Microsoft to unveil it's super-sekrit "Project Origami".  All signs point to a new Newton, updated for the 21st Century -- a wireless Windows device the size of a DVD case that's both computer and general purpose media device.
</p>
<p>
The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/09/technology/09tablet.html?ex=1299560400&en=afab1ee1acc06e6f&ei=5088&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss">early press</a> is in, and isn't very flattering:
</p>
<blockquote><p><i>
Andy Brown, an analyst in London with IDC, a research firm, said "converged devices" like Samsung's Q1 faced an uphill battle to win over consumers, who are more likely to favor traditional laptops with keyboards or tiny MP3 players than dual-purpose machines.
</i></p><p><i>
"The growth prospects are not really strong," he said. "The main problem for most is that they fall in between what consumers are looking for." 
</i></p></blockquote>
<p>
If you really want Origami, go look for <a href="http://www.langorigami.com/">the real thing</a>.  (Hint: the <a href="http://www.astc.org/exhibitions/flipit/iflipit.htm">travelling exhibition</a> is currently in Boca Raton, FL until April 30 2006.)

The problem with this form factor is that it doesn't fit in a pocket, and it rattles around in a briefcase. There's no reasonable way to carry it from place to place.<br><br>I predict a flop, with a few fast early sales, but then little uptake by the masses.



<h2>Lesson /not/ Learned</h2>

Sad to see the same mistakes repeated.  If someone wants a computing device that also works as a dumb multimedia device, Qasimo (Toshiba) already fills that, in a familiar way.  (I think some Sonys can do this now, too).
</p>
<p>
If someone wants a Multimedia device that can also compute, there are several iPAQ/Palm/Motorola Phone devices that fill that side.
</p>
<p>
The mistake is that folks assume that there is a gap between the form factors, but there isn't such a gap.  The people who want this form factor DID buy Newtons, and those same people won't be able to keep the new devices afloat either.
