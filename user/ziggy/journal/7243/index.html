<p>More of the Winer vs. Lessig "debate" that Dave doesn't want to end:
<blockquote><i>
First I don't have a good pointer to a Web page explaining his proposal, so I'm having to do this from memory. I'm not going to buy his book because I don't want to give him any money because I find what he wants so unsupportable. If you've read his book, and if I've got his proposal wrong, please send me a correction. Thanks.
</i></blockquote>
Translation: This is personal.  And extremely childish.
<p>
Dave appears to be staking out a middle ground of sorts between RMS and Jack Valenti on copyright.  He casts Lessig as slightly less left-leaning than RMS, which is a bogus characterization.  I hope that someone can accurately characterize Dave's beef with copyright reform; isolating a few ounces of clue from his tons of blather is just too tedious for me to endure anymore.</p>

<br>Otherwise I don't know if I should write an entry like this:<br> <br>"Community takes pity on Winer; his emotions are hurt and now all he can do is masturbate and try to talk himself up on his weblog."<br> <br>or if it just should be<br> <br>"Winer no longer considered an idiot.  Winer proven an idiot".<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br> <br>In either case, please don't link to him anymore.  I like reading your journal, I don't want to be tempted to read his.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br> <br>

Point noted.  Link removed.

Anyone who wants to find the article I originally cited can google for it.  I've seen a few other bloggers take issue with this particular passage today.  It shouldn't be hard to find.</p>
