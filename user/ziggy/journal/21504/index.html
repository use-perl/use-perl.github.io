<p>I stumbled across <a
href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?UseClosuresNotEnumerations">this
page</a> on the <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki">c2 wiki</a> today.
It's a discussion about why this:

<pre>
foreach my $item (@list) {
	...do something here...
}
</pre>

is less desiarable to this smalltalk/rubyish construct:

<pre>
@list.foreach {|item| 
	...do something here...
}
</pre>

In Perl (and Ruby), the syntactic difference is subtle.  In Java,
the syntactic difference is larger.  (See the Wiki discussion for
an example.)  The main difference is that throwing a closure at a
<code>foreach</code> method on a collection allows you to use a
named function just as easily -- instant reuse!  So stop copying the
body of a for loop over and over again (or just as bad, write it from
scratch every time you need it) and start composing code through
combinations of higher order operations.

<p>

All of this is well and good in the abstract.  But at some point, this
code has to execute.  It's nice to talk about ivory tower constructs
that are platonically "better" than the brute force coding.  How does it
all work in practice?

<p>

Ward Cunningham has some insight as to why Java programmers are so
hesitant to adopt these Smalltalk memes:

<blockquote><i>
I read in a recent performance tuning book that inner classes hava
a ram footprint of about 3K each before they are even instantiated.
Compare this to two or three bytes per (latent) block in Smalltalk
and you get a feeling for why each language has its own conventions.

</i></blockquote>

Hm.  I smell a leaky abstraction.

In Perl function calls are expensive, so we don't slice things as finely as we really should some times.<br> <br>In Java they made the poor decision early on to not make the basic data types real objects.  And then there's that whole "Final" thing.  And now this.<br> <br>Smalltalk... they seem to have unabashadly thrown their faith in Moore's law and advanced compiler design.  Although I've been flipping through a Smalltalk 80 book and remember they did some interesting hack with small integers where the first 256 pointers were all allocated to the numbers -127 to 128 so you could represent small ints as objects without extra memory.  And that there was a limit of 32K objects because pointers were 16bits long.  But that's all internal stuff and hopefully its gone now.<br> <br>
