<h1>Apple vs. Microsoft?</h1>
<h2><a href="/user/ziggy/">ziggy</a> on 2003-05-25T23:54:52</h2>
</div> <!-- /span4 -->


<div class="span8">
<p>Apple comes out with an interesting <a href="http://www.applemusic.com">digital music</a> service, and they become a media darling.  Customers like it too, to the tune of 2 million tracks <i>purchased</i> in the first two weeks.
<p>
Microsoft was working on their own, subscription-based alternative for a while now.  It was <a href="http://news.com.com/2100-1027_3-1009794.html?tag=fd_lede1_hed">supposed to ship</a> ahead of Apple's music store.  They're also playing catch up, and trying to fight the meme that Apple has put out there: we've purchased music for decades and want to continue to do so; "renting" music is just a bad idea.
<p>
Among the things Microsoft has done are: improve their DRM technology, work out how to make subscription based services work with DRM (i.e. timeout features) and work with multiple vendors (i.e. provide a "standard" supported by 15 portable players).  
<p>
From a project management/product management perspective, Microsoft did everything right: talk to the stakeholders (customers, consumer electronics vendors, music labels) and come up with a solution acceptable for all parties, support diversity in the market place (multiple music rental sites, multiple MP3 player vendors), and generally try to please everyone.  
<p>
Yet no one seems to want what Microsoft is working on.  Furthermore, Apple's stovepipe model (iTunes store only works with iTunes 4, which only works on Mac OS X 10.2, which only works on newer Macs; the only supported portable player is the iPod) is a big win in the market.  Superficially, Apple looks like it is doing all of the wrong things, especially when it comes to expanding vendor lock-in.
<p>
So, what is Microsoft doing wrong?  What is Apple doing right?  Or did Apple just figure out that the "stakeholders" in a digital music service are irrelevant, except for the end-user who just wants a compelling "total product"?</p>

<h2>compromises</h2>

If you talk to all the stakeholders and get a consensus that everyone can live with you often end up with a compromise nobody wants.
