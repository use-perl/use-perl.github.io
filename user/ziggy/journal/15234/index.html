<div class="span8">
<p><a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/">Paul Graham</a> wanted to release the design of <a href="http://www.archub.org/">Arc</a>, his new lisp, at the Lisp conference this week.  He got a little hung up on continuations and floating point numbers, so he presented his current draft language specification instead.
<p>
Paul started by identifying the irreducible primitives that are necessary to build a lisp sufficiently powerful to build and <tt>eval</tt>.  His list is currently at 9, but is likely to expand to include a few more primitives.  (McCarthy's lisp started with seven irreducible primitives: <tt>car</tt>, <tt>cdr</tt>, <tt>cons</tt>, <tt>if/cond</tt>, <tt>equal</tt>, <tt>lambda</tt> and <tt>set</tt>).
<p>
Continuations are going into Arc, as are macros.  Paul is currently taking a <i>very</i> minimalist approach to naming his keywords.  Lambda is currently spelled <tt>fn</tt>, function definitions use the <tt>def</tt> form, and macros are created with the <tt>mac</tt> form.  Scheme's <tt>call-with-current-continuation</tt> or <tt>call/cc</tt> will likely enter Arc as <tt>ccc</tt>.
<p>
Yes, that means that the predicate to determine whether something is a continuation would be called <tt>cccp</tt>, if you are of a Lisp-y instead of a Scheme-y bent.</p>

Somebody has to keep them going now they've fallen out of gcc...

<p>On a more serious note, is there more publically available detail on arc yet?  archub.org is kind of slim on the ground.

No, he's still working on the Arc language spec, written in Arc.
<p>
John McCarthy tried to impress upon Paul that this was not a good approach, since there will be required elements in the language design that are not representable within that language.  But that's where Paul is now.  He has ideas on where he wants to go after the core language kernel is finished, but he's not talking about any of that.</p>

<p>Is <a href="http://www.international-lisp-conference.org/" title="internatio...erence.org">this</a internatio...erence.org> the conference in question?  (I don't presently move in LISP circles, so I was just wondering.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) )</p>

Yes, that was the one.
