<p>From Fred Pohl, sometime around 1992:
<blockquote>
<i>
Global warming isn't about the weather getting hotter.<br>
It's about the weather moving elsewhere.
</i>
</blockquote>

That's a trip to the wayback machine, from when I was reading a whole shelf full of books about the imminent demise of the ecosystem, civilization, the economy and other happy fun topics.  Back when I wasn't eating meat, or wearing leather, but was consuming heavy amounts of roasted caffeine berries.... (it was a college thing)
<p>
Anyway, today we have conclusive evidence that global warming is here, in the form of weather systems not doing what they're supposed to be doing:  It's now Midnight, December 1st, and it's almost <i>70 degrees</i> in Washington DC.  It's been a mild November, but this balmy weather is positively crazy.  Especially when this is the time of year ice skating rinks are supposed to be open (and not as a respite from the heat...)</p>

<h2>Well</h2>

I might buy that if I weren't *freezing my arse off right now* in SE Mass.

That's what you get for living on the <b>wrong side</b> of the Jet Stream.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)
<p>
Update: it's colder this morning.  About 29 in the district, with highs expected around 60 today.  The temperature should be back to the high 60s again by the end of the week.
</p><p>
As soon as the jet stream switches to a more normal track though, we'll probably get more cold than we know what to do with...</p>

<h2>Los Angeles</h2>

Wow.  Maybe it's time to move. It has been sorta cold in Los Angeles the last week or so. (sub-roomtemperature outside almost all the time).
