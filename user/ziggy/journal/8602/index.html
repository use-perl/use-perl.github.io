<h2>Professionalism</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/TorgoX/">TorgoX</a> on 2002-10-28T04:49:44</h3>
I think I see what Cringely means, but I think "professionalism" is one of those words (possibly even worse than "integrity") that people can use to refer to (or defend) absolutely anything -- which means it's not much good as a word.  (That doesn't mean it's <em>meaningless</em> in a technical sense -- I think it means something like "paying attention to the <em>concept</em> of the job", but you never know what that actually refers to.)
<p>So people who want to replace every bit of a corporation with by-the-numbers modular units, can say they're doing it in the name of professionalism -- because that's what one learns to do in "professional" training at bidniss schools.  And people who want to keep a company small and personal, can just as well say they're doing it in the name of professionalism -- because a sense of "profession" is what they say they want to foster, where everyone has close personal ties to their task, and all the people who relate to it.
</p><p>So when I run into a word like this, I say that no point of contention should ever be expressed using that word, because it's just too imprecise, and that some other (more clear) word has to be used instead.</p>
