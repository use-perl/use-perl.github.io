<div class="span8">
<p>Tired of dealing with writing long messages in a <tt>&lt;textarea&gt;</tt> on a web page?<br/><br/>Usually, I'll copy out whatever draft I'm working on, fire up a new terminal window, paste the text into vim, edit it, and copy it back.  <br/><br/>Copying it back is something of a pain at times.  If it's a long bit of text that doesn't fit into a window, I scroll to the top, and copy it back in chunks.  About as smooth as coarse grit sandpaper.<br/><br/>Of course, there is a better way -- just filter the entire buffer through <tt>pbcopy</tt>, and paste it back in one big chunk.  (In vim, that translates into <tt>ESC H !G pbcopy &lt;CR&gt;</tt>)<br/><br/>(If only this hack would work as smoothly in Win* or my Ubuntu config...)</p>

<h2>Firefox Extensions</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Smylers/">Smylers</a> on 2006-01-06T17:44:31</h3>
<p>There are some Firefox extensions which make this even easier.  Currently I'm using <a href="http://dafizilla.sourceforge.net/viewsourcewith/" title="sourceforge.net">ViewSourceWith</a sourceforge.net>, which doesn't just do what it says but also provides a way of loading the contents of text areas into external editors.</p>

<p>You right-click in a text area and select a menu item to fire up the editor, then save stuff in the editor and it gets reflected in the browser.  I'm using it on Linux with Vim (<code>gvim</code>).</p>

<p>Note also that the Vim keystroke <code>H</code> only moves to the top line currently being displayed; to move to the first line of the document (even if it's scrolled off the top) use <code>gg</code>.  But actually the simplest way to filter an entire document (which doesn't depend on where you currently are in it) is to do:</p><nobr> <wbr></nobr>:%!pbcopy

<p>On Linux the selection in Vim is automatically also the X selection, and the clipboard is accessible as the <code>+</code> register.  So you can highlight an entire document with <code>ggVG</code> and then copy that to the clipboard with <code>"+y</code>.  I haven't used a Mac, so I don't know if that also applies there.</p>

<p>(Finally, don't think of <code>Esc</code> as being a prefix needed before normal-mode commands in Vim; it's the last step to finish an insert, not the first step of the following command, that is it's not needed when you use several normal-mode commands in a row.  Vim becomes much easier to deal with once your mental model of its modes matches how it does things!)</p>

<h2>s/pbcopy/xclip/</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/borup/">borup</a> on 2006-01-09T14:00:15</h3>
The xclip command line util lets you do pretty much the same as pbcopy (xclip is also the name of the ubuntu/debian package).<br><br>I just tried ":w !/usr/X11R6/bin/xclip".<br><br>Add "-selection clipboard" to the command line if you prefer ^V to middle click.
