<p>I've been getting headaches recently.  I've also been drinking coffee rather irregularly.  Usually, that tends to be a sign of caffeine withdrawl, so about a month ago, I gave up coffee.  All forms of coffee.  It's not a hardship really; I never liked it as wakeup juice.  I just happen to like the flavor of a well-made cup of joe.
<p>
The headaches aren't as frequent now, or as painful.  Possibly a sign that I'm slightly dehydrated on a somewhat regular basis (something that would be exacerbated by drinking a pint of coffee every so often).
<p>
Part of the reason I gave up coffee last month was because I was going to YAPC.  Since I'd rather drink water than bad coffee, I figured that I wouldn't be drinking coffee regularly in St. Louis (or San Diego), so that would only cause problems during the conference.
<p>
As far as I can remember, it's been about a month now.  And I just put the nice, new coffee maker we got this winter into storage.  Maybe it's time to put the other implements of junkiedom (the grinder, the french press, the filters, the stovetop espresso machine, ....) away as well.</p>

<p>There's something very wrong with you. It's against certain laws of nature to put coffee implements <i>into storage!</i> I feel for you, man.</p> <p>;-)</p>

You may want to give up all Caffeine, and that includes Tea and Coca Cola.  You might also want to avoid chocolate.

<p>It can take a good couple of months to detox, but you'll be glad you did.

</p><p>Replace the coffee in your life with (non-dairy) fruit smoothies and mineral water.</p>
