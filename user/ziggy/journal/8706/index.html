<div class="span8">
<p>I got my iBook on June 30th, and I've been carrying it with me almost every day since.  Last week, I went to the Apple store in Clarendon, Virginia, to talk about two problems I've been having.  First, the lid doesn't stay closed very much anymore.  That's a minor nuisance, but it's getting to be more bothersome.
<p>
Second, and more importantly, the backlighting is starting to act funny.  On low brightness levels, it's very easy to notice that the backlighting on the left hand side of the screen gradually starts to dim until it's almost unreadable.  It starts as a small dim spot towards the middle bottom and grows until it gradually spreads across the entire lefthand side.  As a coping behavior, I've noticed that putting the brightness up all the way gradually brings the brightness back on the lefthand side.  I tend to use a low backlighting to reduce eyestrain (and preserve battery power), so this is a real problem.
<p>
The helpful, friendly Apple store salesperson asked around and said that they <i>might</i> be able to fix the problem with the latch closing, but that the screen brightness was a serious problem, and would require sending the laptop in for servicing.  (All Praise AppleCare!)  The downside is that there's a possibility that the iBook's hard drive might need to be formatted (but I don't understand why.)
<p>
So, rather than getting an iPod at the store that day, I ordered a dual USB/FireWire drive from <a href="http://www.smalldog.com">SmallDog Electronics</a>.  (I had narrowed my search down to a LaCie Pocket drive, and they had a good price -- and SmallDog isn't a huge impersonal mailorder shop.)
<p>
I ordered the drive with 2-day delivery, and called to complain yesterday that it hadn't showed up yet.  FedEx goofed, and they resent the drive, and I received it this morning.  Time to start backing up the disk before I send the iBook back to Apple for repairs...</p>

Besides my usual jealousy of the iBook, I have to ask: where in Clarendon is the Apple store? (I used to live near there)

It's about three blocks away from the Metro station, in that little mall with the Barnes &amp; Noble and the Crate &amp; Barrel.  (I got off the Metro and called for directions.)

Wow. It must have changed a lot since I've been there (~4 years), since neither of those stores were there before. Arlington continues to be my favorite place I've lived so far.

<h2>Backlight</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Matts/">Matts</a> on 2002-11-01T11:11:05</h3>
I think the backlight is a particularly weak area on the iBooks. You may remember that mine went and had to be sent back. Cabling issue. It makes me wonder if yours will come back with a replaced cable. Do let us know<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br> <br>As for the catch, it may just be getting stiff or stuck wuth grime. Its a very clever design where the latch is hidden and flips down when it comes close to the bottom of the case by a magnet (don't put a floppy disk over the catch hole). If the catch is a bit stuck it might not come down far enough. I don't know what the answer is, since any method of cleaning would have to be extremely careful not to damage the screen. Good luck<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)

I remember that yours went back, but I didn't remember the cause.

</i> </div></blockquote>
I don't think so in my case.  My lid is slightly out of true, sticking out a little to the bottom right when it's closed.  It's out of true in precisely the right direction so that the catch doesn't stay when it's closed.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-S  Still, if grime is the suspect, I'll let you know.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

<h2>Backups</h2>

They don't usually bother with your drive, but if they feel they need to, they want to make sure that they can, so they ask you to be backed up.
