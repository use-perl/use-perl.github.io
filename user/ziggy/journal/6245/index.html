<div class="span8">
<p>Kudos to Apple on the design of the iBook and OS X.  (Ironic that I'm writing this on a Win* laptop...)
<p>
<b>Everything</b> has been scrutinized to the nth degree.  All the way down to the keyboard/software controls for the brightness.  Apple invented the OBE (out-of-the-box experience), and they've been refining the art over the past 20 years.  I honestly don't remember what it was like to boot the computer up for the first time -- two or three questions and it was all up and running.  These were important configuration issues like setting the timezone and the first account.
<p>
There's also a really good idiom for administering an iBook under OS X.  A handful of control panels have a little padlock icon at the bottom if they can be locked or unlocked.  Unlocking is simple, and works just like <tt>su</tt>.  (In fact, <tt>fink</tt> uses <tt>su</tt> to do its work all the time.)
<p>
There are the obvious coolness touches - like the pulsing glow on the front of the box when sleeping.
And the orange/green tint to the power adaptor when plugged into the iBook to indicate charging/wall-power.
<p>
There are also the obligatory dislikes.  I'm not immensely fond of the keyboard (Dell tends to have better laptop keyboards and a better trackpad).  I'd like to have a two button mouse, but it hasn't really been a problem yet.  (Not sure what happens when I start installing apps under XDarwin.)  And the lack of an audio in port is a real bummer.  
<p>
All told, these are minor issues.  I'd prefer to have a laptop with a trackpad that requires user re-education rather than a laptop that has a nice trackpad, but hard-to-find brightness controls and can't seem to drive a VGA projector at all...
<p>
So, if you're in the market, buy an iBook.  How many laptops come with Perl and Apache out of the box, after all?  :-)
<p><b>Update:</b> I just found the song browser.  The first thought that crossed my mind?  <i>Smalltalk Code Browser!</i>.  It really works well.  (And I am such a geek, but you already knew that...)</p>

<h2>My iBook...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/james/">james</a> on 2002-07-10T10:05:54</h3>
...experience has been mostly good as well -- I really like the laptop.  And my only gripe matches yours - the keyboard.<br> <br>On my iBook the delete key has popped off and broken the connecting pins, so at the moment it is being held in place by a little bit of superglue and some sticky tape.<br> <br>I could send it back to apple for an undetermined period of time, but I'd rather not.  Sooner or later iBook keyboards will appear at <a href="http://www.pbparts.com/" title="pbparts.com">pbparts.com</a pbparts.com> and then I'll replace the whole thing.<br>
