<p>Last night, we went to see HHGTTG.  Overall, the movie was well done.  The casting worked well, especially with <a href="http://us.imdb.com/name/nm0293509/">Tim from the office</a> as Arthur Dent, <a href="http://us.imdb.com/name/nm0080049/">Left Ear</a> as Ford, and <a href="http://us.imdb.com/name/nm0000614/">Professor Snape</a> as Marvin.  Zaphod is really hard to do well, and his second head and third arm didn't really work for me.  They fudged a few bits, like the cup of tea that powers the heart of gold.  And I don't remember Trillian getting rescued from the Vogons, but they needed to add something to turn the one book into a feature length film.
<p>
But the best parts of the film were the things that I least expected and most expected.  The trailer for Chicken Little was perfect.  And hearing that banjo-y theme for the first time in about 20 years was very welcome indeed.
<p>
Of course, I needed go visit the iTunes store to find out what that damn piece is called.  Turns out it's <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=54796297&selectedItemId=54795627">Journey of the Sorcerer</a>, which is actually part of a <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=1054520&selectedItemId=1054517">much longer song</a> by the Eagles off of <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=1054520">One of These Nights</a>.  
<p>
Hey, where did that $0.99 come from, and why is it burning a hole in my pocket?  ;-)
<p>
(Insert obvious reference to <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=U&start=1&q=http%3A//www.wired.com/wired/archive/12.10/tail.html&ei=yj54QoiHFcr0aJW42MQI">The Long Tail</a> here.)
<p>
Poking around the soundtracks on iTunes, here are some other blasts-from-the-past:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playListId=48346491">Spaced Out</a> - the very best of Kirk and Spock</li>
<li>The <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=58299796&originStoreFront=143441">Battlestar Galactica</a> Soundtrack, including the surprisingly memorable <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=58299796&selectedItemId=58299106">theme</a></li>
<li>The infectiously upbeat <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=58710826&originStoreFront=143441">Casino Royale Soundtrack</a>, and its trademark <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=58710826&selectedItemId=58710378">theme</a></li>
<li>The overplayed <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=22482737&selectedItemId=23150393">Cantina Music</a> from Episode IV</li>
<li><i><a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=6834101&selectedItemId=6834027">[Be a] Dentist!</a></i></li>

Oh, and Monday night is the <i>perfect</i> time to hit the theater.  ;-)</p>

<h2>What have you done with the T?</h2>

First, I'm not reading all your entry now because I don't really want anything capable of spoiling me the movie, so I'm not risking.

<p>So now... what does "HHGTTG" mean? Or have you done something to the first T? O:-)</p>



<h2>Not in Portugal</h2>

<i>Oh, and Monday night is the perfect time to hit the theater.</i>

<p>Not in Portugal, it isn't<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

</p> <p>Going to cinemas in Portugal on Mondays is cheaper than in every other day of the week (unless you're a student, and this is only valid for the main cinemas, as some small ones sometimes have their own rules/prices).

</p> <p>As a result, Monday is the day in which most people go to the movies, resulting in more noise in the room, more confusion, more stupid people making stupid remarks, etc, etc, etc.

</p> <p>Thursday is now the official opening day for movies in Portugal, so there are quite a few people going to see big movies on Thursdays...

</p> <p>IMHO, the best days to hit the theater in Portugal are Tuesday and Wednesday<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

</p> <p>/me considers seeing a movie today...</p>
