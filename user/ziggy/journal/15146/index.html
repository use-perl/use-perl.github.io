<b>Competition: Client</b><br>
The Linux Open Source operating system, which is also derived from Unix, and is available under a General Public License, has gained increasing public acceptance as its feature set increasingly resembles the distinct and innovative features of Windows, and as competative pressures on personal computer OEMs to reduce costs continue to increase.

(I can't help but wonder which "distinct and innovative features" they're talking about.  Integrated TCP/IP?  File sharing?  Print queues?  Itty bitty icons in the Tray?)</p>

<h2>Note the FUD</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jdavidb/">jdavidb</a> on 2003-10-10T13:51:35</h3>
<p>Linux is not derived from UNIX.</p>

<h2>FUD? Not guilty</h2>

This does not strike me as FUD.  While the <b>code</b> of Linux is not derived from the code of Unix (or at least the vast majority of the code is not, although some bits might come from BSD from Unix or other bits might come from other vintages of Unix); the <b>basic design</b> of Linux is definitely derived from Unix.  Just think of fork/exec, device nodes in the file system, process 0, C library interface to the OS, signals/kill, etc.

The distinction is academic.  Microsoft's report was <i>very</i> carefully worded.
<p>
OTOH, Linux was created independantly of Unix source code.  OTOH, the design is a pretty faithful reimplementation of the basic ideas in Unix.  OTGH, the usage of the term &laquo;<i>derived</i>&raquo; is deliberately ambiguous, and serves to cloud the issue WRT the SCO suit.</p>
