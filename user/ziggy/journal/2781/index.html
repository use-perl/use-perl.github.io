<div class="span8">
<p>Late last month, SatireWire <a href="http://www.satirewire.com/news/jan02/axis.shtml">ran a story</a> about the Axis of Evil, the Axis of Just as Evil, ... and the Axis of Countries Whose Names End in "Guay."
<p>
The Washington Post ran that story in the opinion pages yesterday, mostly unedited (the "Axis of Countries That Sometimes Ask Sheep to Wear Lipstick" was notoriously absent; sorry, gnat).
<p>
Apparently, news doesn't travel as fast as the speed of light.  CNN <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/meast/02/11/iran.kharrazi.cnna/index.html">is reporting</a> that Iran doesn't like being in the Axis of Evil.
<p>
Maybe if there were Gold, Silver and Bronze medals awarded to each of the member nations of the Axis of Evil, there would have been a response a wee bit sooner.  (Either that, or it's a slow news day, aside from DNA testing in Afganistan and a couple of knuckledraggers in Utah prospecting for Gold, Silver and Bronze...)</p>

It's not so much that news travels slowly; today marks the fall of the Shah or somesuch, and they are using the event to publically criticize/protest/whatever.
<br>
<br>There are only two Axis of Evil athletes in the Olympics, both from <a href="http://www.olympics.com/r/3/bio/noc_IRI.htm" title="olympics.com">Iran</a olympics.com> (cross country and alpine skiing).  Worthy of note is that there are no North Koreans; if there had been, they would have marched with the <a href="http://www.olympics.com/r/3/noc/noc_KOR.htm" title="olympics.com">South Koreans</a olympics.com> under the unified Korean flag as they did at the Australian games two years ago.  But since there were none, they marched under the South Korean flag.
