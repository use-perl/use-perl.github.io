<p>Bruce Eckel recently <a href="http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=141312">reviewed</a>  Bruce Tate's book, <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/beyondjava/">Beyond Java</a>, and inadvertantly set off a firestorm.  In Eckel's stream-of-consciousness review, he chides Tate (but actually doesn't, but really he does, no wait-a-second, nevermind) for sloppy thinking, and then lets loose a few <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/lachoy/journal/28081">howlers</a> of his own.<br/><br/>Of course, because a few pet languages were slammed, this post has launched an advocacy debate all over the blogosphere.  (You know where to look; I'm not going to provide any links or fan the flames.)  This kind of thing that was fun in 1997 on <tt>comp.lang.perl</tt> or some mailing list somewhere.  But then, somehow, most of us got tired of it all, grew up, and moved on.  <br/><br/>Advocacy debates and their associated flamewars don't contribute anything to the sum total of human experience.  If they do, the contribution is slightly less than lighting a fart in an empty room.<br/><br/>So, now comes the friendly periodic reminder about internet debating:<ul>
<li>Torkington's Law: <i>Email[*] is a vast, global conspiracy to waste <b>your</b> time</i></li>
<li>MJD's classic, <a href="http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2000/12/advocacy.html">Why I Hate Advocacy</a>
</ul>Now, if you actually go back to read what Eckel actually said (and ignore the flames and flamebait), I'd highlight your attention to this passage: <blockquote><i>My own experience in web frameworks was with Zope. In an interesting parallel with EJB3, Zope is now on version 3 which is a from-the-ground-up redesign, and everything I've seen of it indicates that, like EJB3, it represents a great deal of rethinking of the problem. I've been bumping up against the problem of "but all I want to do is connect a database to the web" in Zope2 for several years now. Oh, it's definitely something you can do, but unfortunately it's past the knee of the "Z-shaped learning curve," and is only trivial if you live and breathe Zope every day. Don't get me wrong; Zope is an excellent system and incredibly powerful, and Zope3 may be much easier, but I'm out of steam. I have realized that on my site, I really just want to do a collection of simple things, and I don't want to relearn Zope every time I want to accomplish something. So -- sorry, Jim (Fulton, not Kirk) -- I'm going to find something drop-dead simple to solve my drop-dead simple problems. </i></blockquote>Yep.  That's right.  We've been building abstractions (frameworks, app servers, etc.) to build web apps for over a decade, and we <i>still</i> haven't got it right.  Finding the right abstractions and architectures to build web applications (or even classify categories of web applications) is a deceptively difficult problem, and we're still feeling our way out of the dark.<br/><br/>

FWIW, that note I mentioned implying PHP apps were maintainable and scalable while Perl apps were not wasn't Eckel but one of the commenters
