Me: Kurt, you'll never guess who I met today.
<p>
Kurt: You're probably right about that.  Can you give me a clue?
<p>
Me: Brad.
<p>
Kurt: ...... <i>Cox</i>???!?
<p>
Me: Yep.
<p>
Kurt: <b><i>You met <a href="http://www.virtualschool.edu/cox/">Brad Cox</a>?  Dude!!!  How did you meet Brad Cox?  What's he like? Where did you meet him?</i></b>
</blockquote>
Yep.  I was in a workshop today, and the inventor of Objective C was in the room.  I must admit that I was zoning out when the mic was being passed around.  You can be sure when I heard "<i>My name is Brad Cox, and...</i>"  I snapped to attention without thinking twice.  ;-) 
<p>
I spoke to the good Doctor briefly.  He seems to have long since moved away from Objective C.  Brad also mentioned that he spent five years using Perl, although he's mostly using Java and Ruby.  
<p>
What interests the man who mingled C and Smalltalk these days?  He says he's mostly focused on online payment systems -- micropayments, new business models, community ownership and the like.
<p>
What I did find most troubling is that Brad's involvement in Objective C these days is receiving plaintive emails every time Apple contemplates removing the Objective C APIs from Mac OS X.  I don't follow Apple's ever-changing whims anymore, but this tidbit certainly sounds rather interesting.</p>
