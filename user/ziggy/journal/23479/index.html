<div class="span8">
<p>The <a href="http://www.nationalcherryblossomfestival.org/">National Cherry Blossom Festival</a> is a couple of weeks away.  Early <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A3959-2005Mar3.html">word</a> is that the blossoms should peak around April 4-9.
<p>
So, anyone coming into DC for the occasion? ;-)</p>

<h2>Not what I thought you meant</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Ovid/">Ovid</a> on 2005-03-03T18:47:13</h3>
<p>Years ago, a friend and I played a practical joke one someone we knew by subscribing him to <a href="http://www.blossoms.com/" title="blossoms.com">Cherry Blossoms</a blossoms.com>, a magazine for finding Asian mail order brides.  He lived in a crowded house, so naturally, when the first issue arrived, everyone knew about it before he did and they gave him hell.</p>

<p>It was, perhaps, a bit cruel, but I confess that he was a macho "I can kick anybody's @$$" jock type, so I didn't feel <em>too</em> bad about it.</p>



<h2>There's an Amtrak event for this!</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jjohn/">jjohn</a> on 2005-03-03T21:13:40</h3>
Sadly, I was thinking about coming down on the Amtrak to see this.  I like traveling by train anyway and this seemed like a good excuse.  I haven't made any commitments to do this yet.  So much to think about...



<h2>PyCon</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ascher/">ascher</a> on 2005-03-03T21:41:57</h3>
I'll be there for PyCon March 19-22 -- will you be there?

I may not show up for any of the sessions, but I work less than a mile away.  I'll be there.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)

<h2>I'll be there.....</h2>

but only because of my wife.  She has lived in this country for nearly a year now and I have yet to take her to D.C.<br> <br>There is a huge flower festival in Baguio (Philippines) around this same time of year which she likes so I think this will be a good thing to do.<br> <br>I really don't like D.C. traffic and it is still a bit too cold to take the Metro and walk everywhere (for her having not acclimated quite yet).

Wow!  What a small world!  My [late] stepfather was stationed in Baguio back in the '70s.
<p>
That's the town in the mountains, where airplanes "take down" because of the altitude, isn't it?</p>

That's the place.  It really is quite beautiful and cool (in comparison to the rest of the country).  The strawberries are wonderful.  Of course, I am a bit biased<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)<br> <br>So do you go to the DC PerlMongers meetings?  I went a couple of times when I was living in Germantown.  Baltimore.pm only meets when someone is going to present and as of yet (over a year) no one has.  I was going to present on sorting and how things will change in p6 - but alas, life took over.

I used to show up semi-regularly at DC.pm, and do about a presentation a year.  Haven't shown up to a meeting for a year or two now, but I still lurk on the mailing list.

<h2>My family is...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Whammo/">Whammo</a> on 2005-03-06T00:50:52</h3>
<p>Mom, sister, brother-in-law, two nephews, and a niece, for the week.  Not that they're specifically coming for the Cherry Blossoms, but they will get a chance to see them.</p>

<p>Interesting enough, the first time I ever went to D.C. - well, that I remember; I went when I was two, or something, but so what? - was 1987, when my high school band marched in the Cherry Blossom Parade.</p>
