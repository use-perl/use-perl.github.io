<p>Apple has come out with a sweet 50-lb eMac exclusively for education.  It's an iMac with a 17" flat panel CRT and all the standard goodies.
<p>
<tt>&lt;cranky_old_man&gt;</tt><br>
Some students are <a href="http://news.com.com/2100-1040-896568.html?tag=fd_top">complaining</a> about the pricing.  $1249 for a high end model?  $1500 for the custom built model?  What's to complain about?
<p>
In 1988, I bought a MacSE with two <b>floppy</b> drives for $2500.  Yes, a whole megabyte of RAM, a 9" black-and-white monitor and <i>no</i> HD (instead of spending the extra $500 for Apple's overloud 20MB disk, I spent $300 for a 45MB disk and somehow had space to spare when everyone else's disk started filling up...)  There was an option to buy a MacII for $4000, with a small color monitor and 80MB HD included.
<p>
And now students are crying out because they're shelling out $250-$500 more than the $999 list price of the base model?  Not only do these boxes still play Crystal Quest, Tetris and Escape Velocity, but these boxes come with compilers, X-Windows and <i>export restrictions</i>!
<p>
Back then, the computer I <i>wanted</i> was a $10,000 68030 NeXT cube (acutally, the '040, but that wasn't in production yet).  That box was a <i>steal</i> at $6,500.  (But you still really needed the 330MB HD; the system was unusably slow with the flopticals alone.  I can't think of a better machine than something like the eMac.  Very little on the market is close to an order of magnitude better than that $1000 configuration.
(Multiple CPUs get kinda interesting, but not that much more interesting until you start talking multiples of 16 CPUs...)
<p>
Kids today....
