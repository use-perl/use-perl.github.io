Funny.  A lot of hackers thought it was loony back in the day.  :-)</p>

<p>when most of us were too busy cashing in on Amazon, VA  and Yahoo IPO stock and getting big paychecks. The money was good while it lasted. It's a pity though that the dot.com craze turned what was an interesting profession into something far less so. I wonder how long before some of these lame columnists find something interesting to write about instead of the dot bomb yet again.</p>

For many "writers," there are only two things to write about: how the world is going to change, and how everyone was wrong about the world changing.  My response is of the latter type!<br> <br>I am no economist, or businessman, but when the "dot com" businesses took off and people told me about the new economy, I thought, how is it different?  No one ever had an answer, beyond the depth of, "you know, computers and stuff."  I didn't buy it then, and I can't stand the hand-wringing over it now.<br> <br>You're right, the money was good while it lasted, which is why I worked to get in on some of it, because I knew it wouldn't last.  It wasn't possible for it to.  I don't know why any moderately reasonable person had any idea it would (though perhaps I answer my own question there).<br> <br>Nothing has changed.  We keep looking for the Next Big Thing.  Meanwhile, we're still using OSes that were designed primarily before most of our colleagues were born.  And I'm fine with that.
