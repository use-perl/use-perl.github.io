<p><p>
In an effort to improve <a href='http://www.catalystframework.org'>Catalyst</a>'s public relations I decided to write in this journal occasionally. Let's see if I can keep this up.
</p><p>
To start this off I'd like to announce that the rewrite of the <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Catalyst::Plugin::Session">session</a> plugins is finished, and they have been released.
</p><p>
These plugins make support for all the session goodness more stable and flexible. They let you easily write <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Catalyst::Plugin::Session::State">state</a> and <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Catalyst::Plugin::Session::Store">storage</a> plugins (e.g. <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Catalyst::Plugin::Session::State::Cookie">cookie state</a>, <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Catalyst::Plugin::Session::Store::DBI">DBI</a> <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Catalyst::Plugin::Session::Store::Memcached">memcached</a> or <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Catalyst::Plugin::Session::Store::FastMmap">fastmmap</a> stores) easily, and then mix and match them without a headache.
</p><p>
In the works is a plugin for more fine grained expiry (each key in the session data can be expired independently), and a massive rewrite of the authentication/authorization plugins (naturally with good integration with sessions), that is getting the same kind of consistency and usability.
</p><p>
If you'd like to help (we mostly need testing), come and join us on the #catalyst on irc.perl.org. Our development is being done in the <a href="http://dev.catalyst.perl.org/repos/Catalyst/trunk/">Catalyst SVN repository</a>, where you can find our work in progress.

Who are you, and how are you related to the Catalyst project?  Are we supposed to know that psychically somehow?  Perhaps you should update your use.perl bio?

I'm nothingmuch, also NUFFIN on pause. I have a real name in hebrew on CPAN, so i'll list my english one: Yuval Kogman.<br><br>I lurk on #catalyst, #perl6 and some other channels on irc.perl.org and freenode, and when I have more time i often frequent perlmonks.<br><br>I'm related to catalyst because I contributed code. That's also how I'm related to other projects.<br><br>As for paranormal conveyance of information - it's really simpler than that. The mailing list and the modules' pages have the info about me. The other frequenters of #catalyst know who I am. I announced my intentions of rewriting sessions/auth a while ago, and now I got around to it with help and feedback from many people in the community. I think this counts more than a recognizable name.<br><br>I'm updating my use.perl bio right now, but I'm not sure it'll help.<br><br>Please try to be a little less negative - I really have no idea what I did wrong.

It looks to me like it got truncated.

Whoops... =)<br><br>Fixed... Roughly 3/4ths of a phrase was missing - i abbreviated it instead.

While the name "nothingmuch" may mean something <i>inside</i> the Catalyst community, it meant nothing to me as an outsider.  But you were trying to establish yourself in an outreach position.  <p>It's important when you are in an outreach position to provide some sort of relationship so that others can converse with you as something other than "random nick called nothingmuch who is now posting about catalyst".
</p><p>
For example, while I'm well known in the Perl community, if I were to start posting in the Scheme groups and start making authoritative comments about Perl, at least someone can see my real name in my footers, and can google and get a background for me, and know that I'm mostly a blowhard {grin}.
</p><p>You didn't have anything like that... just a single handle "nothingmuch".  That's why I challenged you to include some real-world info in your use.perl profile, to establish a real-world face behind your pseudonomynous postings.</p>

Thanks for the advice... This was all fixed, i hope.<br><br>Perhaps the bio is slightly too long now, but it does contain the info<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)

nothingmuch is responsible for some of the coolest developments in the Catalyst community at the moment.<br>
I'm looking forward to hear more from him!

He also is known in certain circles for an exciting pizza flambe.
