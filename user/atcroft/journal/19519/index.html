<p><p>Well, for those of you who waded through my ramblings from <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/atcroft/journal/19097" target="_atcroft">04 Jun 2004</a>, my surprise and admiration. Perhaps an update should be in order, though, as that certainly was a rather rather bleak first posting. As radioman Paul Harvey said, now for the rest of the story....

<p>My hope for a quiet weekend that I had mentioned was shattered by two or more calls about problems from work each day of the weekend. Ugly, ugly time, but most of those issues appear to have been taken care of since, or appear to have been side-effects of the failure cascade I had mentioned. I won't say things have calmed down yet (I don't want to curse myself), but they have gotten a wee-bit more tolerable in the mean time.

<p>As for the leak I had mentioned, I later found that it had leaked under the carpet into the dining area on the opposite side of the utility room. After a week or two of trying to keep up with the status on what was going to be done, it appears to be done now. A carpet company came out, lifted the carpet, cut out the padding in that area, then later (after forgetting to add me to their list of jobs to return to) replaced the pad. Following that, I had noticed what appeared to be a small leak near the hot water heater, but this week the maintenance crew from the apartment complex replaced the hot water heater, so hopefully that should be the end of such problems for a while.

<p>As to my hobby of photography, I haven't gotten to practice it much since that posting, but hopefully things will calm down a bit and I can do so. I had one recent photograph (from a few months ago, of a Civil War-era cannon at a nearby battle site) blown up to 16"x24" (about 40.6cm-by-60.9cm) and sent to a friend of mine as her present for graduating junior college. We thought it almost lost (it took about two weeks to go across 3 intervening states), but it finally arrived, and to my pleasant surprise she seemed to have liked it a lot.

<p>Anyway, for those of you who've made it through this far, my thanks, and my appologies for the level of boredom I've probably continued to instill. Until my next attempt to cure your insomnia, take care.
