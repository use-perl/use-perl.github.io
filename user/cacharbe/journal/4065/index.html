<p>I was having lunch recently, when the topic of <A href="http://www.weightwatchers.com">Weightwatchers</a> came up, and how one of the fellas at the table had lost 47 pounds in about six months.<P><br/><br/>I'm over weight, about 40 lbs heavier than when I started college, and I have been trying desperately to change that.  His 47 lbs weight loss struck a chord.<P><br/><br/>I got home early from work that afternoon (it was the Thursday before Easter, we had the next day off, and the lunch was an appreciation lunch for a project roll out) and decided to surf a little cable while my laptop booted up.<P><br/><br/>*flip*Weight Watchers Commercial
<BR>*flip*Weight Watchers Commercial
<BR>*flip*Weight Watchers Commercial<P><br/><br/>*GAH*<P><br/><br/>And I proceeded to surf over to perl monks for some light reading. A few hours later my girlfriend got home from work (she works at a styling salon), and the first thing out of her mouth?<P><br/><br/>&lt;VOICE accent="Ben Stein"&gt;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyone?<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyone?<BR>
&lt;/VOICE &gt;<P>
"We had a new customer today, and she was really informative.  She is a manager at the local Weight Watchers, and I want to go, but I don't want to do it alone."<P><br/><br/>OKAY!! I can take a hint!!<P><br/><br/>For those of you that don't know (but might care) WW uses a "POINTS" system to determine how much and of what you can eat in one day.  Based on my weight, I can eat so many points in one day, each food item has a points value based on Dietary Fiber, Calories and Fat. But I'll be damned, all of their data is in booklets, in pamphlets and on a little slide-rule like device. <P><br/><br/>How archaic!<P><br/><br/>(Of course, they do have a subscription based on-line service, but I'm already shelling out $12 each for the two of us a week plus the money it's costing me to change my diet - cleaning out the fridge can be painful)<P><br/><br/>And so began the quest. I scoured the web for all of the data files and perhaps even a canned application to do all this data tracking and number crunching. I found one for the Palm (that has been 'decommisioned' thanks to the WW legal team - but that's another story) and it's related data files.  Problem is, only one of us has a PalmPilot, and it ain't the girlfriend.<P><br/><br/>So the quest continued.  I've found a large number of text files that contain most of the data I want, now it's a matter of parsing over 100 different files with different file formats, getting them into a data base with some kind of maintainable structure, and implementing an application that will track all the data on the intranet at home.<P>*sigh*<P><br/><br/>If she hadn't said something, I could have ignored the prompting, but no...<P><br/><br/>At least I can flex the geek(tm) by designing the application<P>C-.
