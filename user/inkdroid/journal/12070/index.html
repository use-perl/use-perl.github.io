<div class="span8">
<p>I just finished reading Gene Wolfe's four part series Book of the New Sun (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/o/ASIN/0312890176">1</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/o/ASIN/0312890184">2</a>). I know I heard about Wolfe from someone on use.perl.org or #perl. Perhaps I eavesdropped on Dave Rolsky since he imagined and coded <a href="http://www.alzabo.org/">Alzabo</a> (a word from Wolfe's imaginary world). Anyway, these books were absolutely incredible.

<blockquote>
"a masterpiece of science fantasy comparable in importance to the major works of Tolkien and Lewis" (Publishers Weekly)
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
"Arguably the finest piece of literature American science fiction has yet produced." (Chicago Sun Times).
</blockquote>

When I read these comments on the back of the first book I must admit I was skeptical. It's almost the ultimate no-no for me to compare anything to Tolkien. I guess that's because I read Tolkien so many times growing up it somehow shaped part of my imagination, and is now inextricably linked to that time in my life.</p>

<p>But as I got into the Book of the New Sun I couldn't agree more. These books have been around for a while, so they are probably not big news to anyone who is into science fiction/fantasy. But if you haven't read them definitely pick up the first one and see what you think. These books have it all: superb language, richly imagined world, complex characters, mystery, magic, science, religion, history, phantasmagoria, sex, love ... the whole <a href="http://wombat.doc.ic.ac.uk/foldoc/foldoc.cgi?shebang">#!</a>. Now I need to find something new to read: any ideas? I feel like I'll have to wait a while before finding another gem like this.</b></p>

You should read the long sun books and the short sun books.  These latter two series eventually tie back into the new sun books.  It's pretty amazing.<br> <br>BTW, Alzabo is not a made up word.  It's Arabic for "the hyena" (I think).

Thanks, I was wondering if these were as good and related to the Book of the New Sun. Now I know what to read next. Have you read any Iain Banks? I really liked his "culture" series alot, and seems similar to Wolfe in some ways. Anyhow, cheers for the recommendation. That should keep me busy<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

I've read all of Iain Banks SF novels, as well as Complicity and The Bridge.  I'm a big fan of his as well.

I'm a fan of hard sci-fi, as well as good fantasy.  But for the life of me, I can not get into this series.  I'm midway into Claw, and I feel no real compelling urge to finish it or the rest of the series.

Well, keep going if you can. The plot line opens up somewhat slowly. There is a fair amount of tension in the book which I guess some people might find unpleasant. Hard science fiction it is not.
