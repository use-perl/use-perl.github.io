<p>Today my university decided to steal again some of my valuable time. It is actually far more brutal than stealing, as I'm quite bored most of the time, at least on Mondays. <br/><br/>Tomorrow does not promise more, but I need to get some sleep. And I have to finish my regex talk till Thursday and that is getting much more a problem as I thought cause I can't really think of what to strip out in order not to bore my audience to death (all none perl guys with different skills in programming, quite hard).<br/><br/>By the way, there is a quite interesting incident this Saturday. The epoch will wrap around to 1000....<br/><br/>$ date -u -d "Sat Jan 10 13:37:04 2004" +%s

30 human years is a long time in computer years.  How many systems do you think will still be running on 32 bit processors in that time?  Even your hair dryer will have 64 bits by then.</p>

I think that is exactly the same way of thinking all the guys had that said a two digit year is enough, who in hell will use our software in 2000?<br> <br>Anyway, I don't really believe it to be a problem by then but I can claim to be the one who first mentioned the 2034 Bug. Maybe I should buy the domain?

Not 30 years -- it starts in 4, when all the 30 year mortgages roll past the epoch end.

It's also already a problem in retirement planning calculations for anyone who's planned retirement date is later than 2034.
