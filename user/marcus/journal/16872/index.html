<p>Anonther week is over and I'm getting a small overview how my year might look like.
There are currently two chances to get out of germany. I got to do an internship beginning July, 19th and I'm applying for a scholarship to get to Toronto for the winter term.<br/><br/>But getting a job for my internship in Toronto is harder than I thought. What I actually thought would be the best idea was mailing to the Toronto.pm mailing list and ask for help. The only two answers I got was one offering me to ask for a job in his company and another who told me that it is quite hard to find a job in IT in Canada even for locals. Quite promising. One of the professors of our university is also teaching at YorkU in T.O. but to depend on him in important matters is quite... not a good idea. The other problem is that I'd miss YAPC::EU, because I'd be in Toronto (and thus missing nearly every conference this year).<br/><br/>As I don't have many options, because my language knowledge is limited to German and English (and Perl ;-), and Latin, but getting into Vatican is a no-op.) I got only one place to go to, Great Britain. But I'm not quite sure if that's what I want. I'll think that over and maybe ask London.pm for help. <br/><br/>The next problem I have is just plain room for living, as I know that there is a college in Toronto where I could stay but I've no experience with England (I've actually never been there).<br/><br/>Tricky situation. <br/><br/>I finished my new CV today, because when I'm going to apply for a job I'll need it, in either country. So I was quite productive. And I got to start to study a little bit, because I'm going to write exams in the first two weeks of February and I still have no clue about Maths.<br/><br/>We'll see, we'll see. Maybe I'll just contact the professor a second time to ask I've he'd provide me with the information I need, give him a deadline and otherwise look for a job in U.K..</p>
