<p>Having two weeks of Christmas holidays can be a tough thing. I thought I'd find time to do some work on Curses::UI and on a talk I'll give next Thursday, but my Family, Friends and heavy drinking consumed so much time that I was unable to do either stuff.<br/><br/>The last year ended quite easy for me, so it's time to schedule 04. I'm not quite sure what I want to do, but going back to T.O. (it's Toronto, Ontario for the unaware) is my first goal. Maybe in summer. Anyway, I'd like to join YAPC::EU, but as no date is set yet and YAPC::NA is quite early this year I fear to be on the wrong continent when either of both is held. But I'll survive this too.<br/><br/>German Perl Workshop is a big time problem, too, but I'll manage that. Maybe I'll give a talk, as they've not decided anything but the date till now. This depends on how my talk next week (about regular expressions) will be judged by the audience. We'll see. This talk is nonexistent, so I'll start creating some transparencies now.

<h2>YAPC::NA and T.O.</h2>

You should be able to handle both YAPC::NA and a visit to Toronto at the same time.  While Toronto was the runner-up for this year's YAPC::NA, the winner was Buffalo which is only a couple of hours drive away.  (Although the border crossing can add a few hours if there is an Orange Alert Heightened Security Level Check [TM unregistered] being carried out.  There were 3-5 hour delays during the Chrismas visiting season.  But that is for entering the U.S., so you could go to YAPC::NA first, then to Toronto and then return home.)

Got two problems with that. First is that my term lasts till July, 10th. And I'll go to Toronto around that time. Can't let go last month of the term just to stay in U.S or Canada.<br>Second Problem is entrance fee for the U.S. It's about 8 $ US IIRC if you cross the border from Canada and who want's to pay money to get into a country nobody likes (just kidding).<br>No, unfortunately this is a no go for me.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-(

$8 entrance fee?  Is that for non-Canadians crossing the US-Canada border into the U.S.?  I've never heard of this (and I do cross that border occassionally by land, somewhat more often by air).
