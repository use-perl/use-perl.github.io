<p>I'm currently in a very constructive email chat with a (I guess) indish guy who keep constantly asking me  how to do things in Curses::UI that are not even implemented. That's good, because he requested some rather usefull features like adding single items to a Listbox widget. Never thought of that and actually never did that. <br><br><br/><br/>When thinking about Curses::UI and hacking it I always want to keep backwards compatibility, that's because I'm lazy and don't want to change my own programs that use Curses::UI. This can't be bad for other people.<br><br><br/><br/>The problem is, as I took over Curses::UI there weren't really much tests. In fact, all tests in Curses::UI just test weather the modules compile, not their actual function.<br><br><br/><br/>But how to test something that is rather a visual thing than something you can catch in the source. I mean, usually you test a module by knowing what a method should return and then using Test::Simple or Test::Moore. I guess about 75% of all subs in Curses::UI don't return anything. They just do something on the screen. And they don't know weather their call just worked or didn't. That's rather strange.<br><br><br/><br/>It's actually not an excuse for not testing the 25% subs that return something. I'm going to do that before I release Curses::UI 0.80. The other problem that all the Test::* modules usually do output something, which can be hard if the screen is locked by Curses calls. This is a thing I've to figure out before I write the tests. The POD isn't tested either and this is something I consider as really bad. So besides all the other stuff I do I have to fix the and write tests for Curses::UI<br><br><br/><br/>Another thing I just wonder about is versioning of modules. I got Curses::UI when it was version 0.70 or something and kept increasing the version number in steps of 0.01 for quite a while now. I think it's psychological more usefull to releas a verion 1.0 someday to tell people that I believe it is ready, stable and useable. Maybe I should create something like a releas plan. It should be easy to release a 1.0 version till christmas. I will release the next version, that has mostly bugfixes and the new tests I'm going to write till end of this month as a 0.8 version. After waiting for some fixes I'll go up to version 0.9 and if I find now showstoppers I'll release it as 1.0. Sounds far more easy than it will be. Only in writing all those test I will intoduce new bugs, find some, fix some bugs and write some new features, so I shouldn't be that optimistic.<br><br><br/><br/>We'll see</p>
