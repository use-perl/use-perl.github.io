<p>This was a perfect day. As usual, I wasn't doing what I should have done, but started with a regretful thought: Let's have a look into how the Parrot Disassembler works and what Parrot actually does with the nice PASM my URM compiler is writing.<br><br><br/><br/><b>It didn't work</b><br><br><br/><br/>It segfaulted directly, and I started debugging the debugger....<br><br><br/><br/>It wasn't that hard, cause all the trouble was only caused by some uninitialised vaiables and the according memory mess.
<br><br>
But the main problem is that I still can not disassemble, because at some point it still segfaults and I don't know what is happening at this point.<br><br>
So maybe it's time to ask people who know what they are doing.<br><br>
My other problem at the moment is that my Parrot CVS is a total mess and that checking out needs a long time with 64k because Parrot got all the ICU (Unicode) stuff in it's repository. So I can't send a patch to the list. :-(<br><br>
But thank God it's friday, I'll have some drinks and maybe I'll have some good new ideas.:-)</p>
