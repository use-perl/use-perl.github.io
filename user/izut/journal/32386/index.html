<p>I've been working last week on SQL::Tokenizer, which was used to, erm, tokenize a SQL query correctly to extract named placeholders for a DBI subclass I'm working on. It is actually using the known-and-loved Perl's regular expression engine, but maybe I can write a version using Pugs::Compiler::Rule, let's see.<br/><br/>About the DBI subclass I mentioned above, Adriano wrote the Tao::DBI, which is a proxy to DBI that implements the named placeholders concept. I liked that and re-implemented the Tao::DBI as a subclass of DBI, but since it is not backward compatible with Adriano's one, I have to found another name for it before release.<br/><br/>Any suggestion?</p>

I've been thinking of doing something similar for some SQL::Statement subclasses I've been working on, but you beat me to it.
(S::S just does progressive regexes, which makes for some very muddy code at times). Should be very helpful in getting those subclasses done.<p>

BTW: I noted you only support ANSI comments; have you considered support for C style "/*<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... */" comments ? (many databases support the latter).</p><p>

Also wrt named placeholders, I don't know if its possible, but it might be nifty to directly reference Perl variables. I've done that with
SQL::Preproc, but it uses a source filter, which scares most people off.</p>

I thank you for using my code<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-) I'll implement the C style comments, following your suggestion.<br><br>I'll see if the direct references to Perl variables when using named placeholders is a Good Thing(tm).<br><br>I'm planning to release the code-that-was-named Tao::DBI when I find a new name for that. Some friends of mine suggested DBIx::WithPlaceholder, but I'm planning to ask about it at Perlmonks.
