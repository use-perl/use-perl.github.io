<p>I updated last week DBIx::Placeholder::Named to version 0.07, which is more compliant with DBI - accepting PlaceholderSuffix and PlaceholderPrefix keys - after I presented it on Amsterdam.pm meeting. I can say that I was surprised that nobody yelled with some module doing the exact same thing...<br/><br/>And continuing the things-I-would-like-to-see-on-DBI I wrote DBIx::Dictionary, which tries to add, in the same clean way DBIx::Placeholder::Named does with named placeholders, query dictionary functionality. <br/><br/>It integrates well with DBIx::Placeholder::Named, and currently only supports Config::General configuration files. I'm planning to add support for some SQL compliant configuration file.<br/><br/>I'd like to hear from you what you think about those modules!</p>

<h2>That looks useful...</h2>

But I won't be using it because named placeholders like that is already built in to DBD::Pg.<br><br>However if I was trying to write portable code that needed to handle lots of SQL, I definitely would use that.

Hi btilly!<br><br>Actually, the DBIx::Placeholder::Named module was conceived in part of rewriting some functionalities of Tao::DBI, for example inheriting properly DBI, and one of its goals is provide named placeholders to database drivers that doesn't support it (like MySQL and SQLite, for instance).<br><br>The cool part about this project is if you want (or need) to deploy your application in some database other than postgresql, you can possibly do that without much effort.<br><br>Using DBIx::Dictionary as top layer for DBIx and DBIx::Named::Placeholder as its parent class, makes things a lot easier, making possible to rewrite your queries from PostgreSQL to $database and maintaining the same API.<br><br>Ah, and thanks for your response<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br><br>

<h2>Phrasebooks</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ferreira/">ferreira</a> on 2008-01-15T11:26:17</h3>
With respect to DBIx::Dictionary, the concept of phrasebooks as introduced by this article: <a href="http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2002/10/22/phrasebook.html" title="perl.com">The Phrasebook Design Pattern</a perl.com>, the <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Class-Phrasebook" title="cpan.org">Class::Phrasebook</a cpan.org>, and the newer (and more actively maintained) <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Data::Phrasebook" title="cpan.org">Data::Phrasebook</a cpan.org> can be a wealthy source of layout for the set of named queries.

The point in DBIx::Dictionary is have a real DBI subclass that support the phrasebook design pattern, and make it can even be subclassed by other DBIx::* classes like DBIx::Simple.<br><br>I wanted to write it with the same thinking I had in mind when wrote DBIx::Placeholder::Named, which was inspired by yours Tao::DBI: small and straight to the point.<br><br>Hope this clarifies the idea behind those modules<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)
