<p><p><img alt="Sony Ericsson T68i" src="http://www.askbjoernhansen.com/archives/2003/01/design_t68i_2.jpg" width="200" height="133" border="0" align="right" />
I got a <a href="http://www.sonyericsson.com/T68i/">Sony Ericsson T68i</a> phone earlier this week.  It's cool.  It's missing some of the Nokia touch, but it's ages better than both the Nokia 7110 I had in Denmark some four years ago and the crappy Nextel and Sprint phones I've had the last years are not in the same league at all.  I still use my old Nokia 6110 I had with ATT as an alarm clock.
<br /><br />
So the <b>good</b> things I've found so far:
<ul>
<li>It's really light. 
<li>It's small.  Completely disappears in any pocket.
<li>So light and small that it has that Japanese style plastic toy feeling.
<li>The e-mail to SMS gateway seems to work fine (I'm using <a href="http://www.t-mobile.com/">T-Mobile</a>)
<li>Sending SMS'es to Danish phones (and back) works to my surprise. 
<li>T-Mobile supports CSD so I can use it as a modem using my minutes instead of using GPRS to $1 per megabyte
<li>Add to the wireless modem unlimited minutes in the weekend and it's pretty neat.
<li>Adding a background image is Too Neat.  And I never even understood the changing face plates thing.
<li>It comes with a handsfree thing.
<li>The blue light that flashes when bluetooth is activated is Really Sexy.  As sexy as little blue lights come anyway.
<li>The blue keyboard backlight is neat too.
<li>The screen is *bright*.
</ul>
<br /><br />
There are also <b>bad</b> things of course

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.apple.com/isync/">iSync</a> does not support IrDA.  I'll have to pick up a bluetooth adapter next time I go by the local Apple store.
<li>The buttons are tiny and cheap plastic like.  I'm sorta getting used to it, but it's not great. They could  not  be much bigger, but they could be better. 
<li>The speaker isn't super loud.  Usually loud enough, but why can't it be louder?  
<li>Vibrator Alert is weak.  I'm not sure I will feel it in an outer pocket in my jacket.
<li>No external speaker (which is only redeeming quality - or quality at all - with Nextel/Motorola phones).  Would have been great for listening to voice mails and navigating the oh-so-popular-with-too-many-companies touch tone navigation systems.
<li>It's cool with a color screen and all, but 256 colors?  I haven't thought about the "web palette" since '97!
<li>With the backilght turned off the screen is completely unreadable.
<li>It's <i>Slow</i>.  Not unusable, but seriously, why does the interface have to be so sluggish? 
Geez! 
</ul>
