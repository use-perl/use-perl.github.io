They have the 12" PowerBooks now.  So neat.  My latest idea is to get a PowerMac and then a 12" instead of the 17".  Or something.  For right now I'm happily bluetoothing my T68i.

Actually, sorta happily.  Why can't I syncronize groups to the phone? It helps that I can choose just one group from the address book to get syncronized to the phone, but the phone supports groups too.  Why can't I choose multiple groups and have them synced with the group membership?

And why does iSync crash every few syncs?  (iSyncServer to be exact). Not very helpful.

And once in a while I get a message that says
<i>|AsksT68i| The conduit does not recognize some data coming from the device, the data is inconsistent and cannot be trusted. Please reset this device and try again
 Conduit AsksT68i generated exception NSSyncConduitException: The conduit does not recognize some data coming from the device, the data is inconsistent and cannot be trusted. Please reset this device and try again.  Can't read contents of folder Default DataStore.</i>  ... What's that supposed to mean?  I'm about as geeky as they come, and even I don't think it's very clear what can't be read.  And there's not a shed of information about why.  "Does not recognize some data"... uhu.  Which data?  From where?  Why?  What can I do about it?  "Reset the device".  Oh, thank you.

It was a bit odd to get it to work at first; iSync denied all knowledge of the bluetooth adapter until I opened the network control panel.  Hmpfr.

I was going to write about using the phone as a modem via bluetooth, but Apple has a document called <a href="http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=86151">Bluetooth: How to Use a Sony Ericsson T68 Phone as a Bluetooth Modem</a> - so just go and read it there.
