<p>I <a href="http://use.perl.org/article.pl?sid=03/08/13/1350221&mode=flat&tid=32">announced</a> the <a href="http://cpanratings.perl.org/">CPAN Ratings</a> site on use.perl. Lots of comments and suggestions there.  More importantly, lots of good reviews.  I'm grateful to everyone who contributed already.  There are a couple of really, eh, "odd" reviews as well. Hopefully adding the "was this review helpful?" feature will help filter those out.  Oh, and I <a href="http://cpanratings.perl.org/about.html">added the links</a> to the installation instructions right over the TODO list.  Hint hint.

<a href="http://salon.com/opinion/feature/2003/08/08/gore_speech/index_np.html">A Huge and Terrible Mess</a> - Al Gore in a great speech to MoveOn.org.  <i>"Something basic has gone wrong in our country".</i>

<strike>Ben & Mena</strike><a href="http://www.sixapart.com/">Six Apart</a> put <a href="http://typepad.com/">TypePad</a> into "preview release</a>".  I've been playing with it since the beta test (alpha? I forget) and I must say it's very very cool.  And so pretty.  They gave beta testers 20 "lifetime 20% discount codes".  If I didn't already have plenty of servers and a nicely working slightly hacked MovableType installation I'd so be there.

<a href="http://www.plaidworks.com/chuqui/blog/000678.html">Experimenting in groups, the quiet voices</a>. How do you get the quiet people to participate more on your mailing list?  How do you "make more room"?  I'm not sure his ideas will apply as well to technical lists as they might to social lists, but the thoughts are very refreshing.  (<i>via <a href="http://enthusiasm.cozy.org/archives/000207.html#000207">Ben Hyde</a></i>)

Ben also linked to an old article about an <a href="http://www.ronincyberpunk.com/archives/001100.html">insanely stupid law</a> in Florida.  Really #$%#'ing disgusting.  And Sad.

Alex Shaffer writes about a few similar stories. <a href="http://nosuch.org/2003_08_01_archive.html#106083345951379796">Comic Disbelief</a> and <a href="http://nosuch.org/2003_08_01_archive.html#106037245898555773">Smut Patrol</a>.  Stories like that were more amusing when I was in Europe and could just laugh at the crazy Americans at a distance.  Instead adding depressive links about the patriot act I'll send you to Alex's <a href="http://nosuch.org/2003_08_01_archive.html#106005532647249713">free fashion advice for ladies</a>.

A link to the <a href="http://www.datanation.com/fallacies/">Guide to the Logical Fallacies</a> is always nice. Slightly related and even more useful: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0553371312/develooper">Getting Past No</a> (how to get your opponent to work with you) which is the followup to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0140157352/develooper">Getting to Yes</a> ("Focus on Interets, not positions").  Both books are short and sweet.  Very worthwhile.

Speaking of short and sweet.  Almost two years ago I bought <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0786885688/develooper">Shopgirl</a> and I still remember it as very fun and enjoyable. Steve Martin is making it <a href="http://www.imdb.com/Title?0338427">into a movie</a> now, with Claire Danes staring as Mirabelle.

Ben also <a href="http://enthusiasm.cozy.org/archives/000200.html#000200">links</a> to the <a href="http://www.tricolorsalvage.com/">tricolor salvage</a> site. Bloody amazing.  Some big container ship sank last year.  It was on shallow water and ships were sailing into it, so now they <a href="http://www.tricolorsalvage.com/pages/infographic.asp">sliced it up</a>(!) to salvage it.  (<a href="http://www.blognewsnetwork.com/members/0000001/mpg/tricolorAutos/tricolorAutos.html">and photos</a>).

OneStat.com says that MSIE <a href="http://www.wininformant.com/Articles/Index.cfm?ArticleID=39691">has a 95% market share</a>.  I'm happy to report that it's less than 60% at <a href="http://askask.com/">askbjoernhansen.com</a>.

<a href="http://www.washedashore.com/people/friendster/">people around me on friendster</a> - I wanted to make something like this; it looks very neat.

Camera phones are getting a bad rep because people worry that they can be smuggled into places where photography isn't allowed. Some weeks ago a 15 year old <a href="http://arstechnica.com/archive/news/1059847332.html">used his cell phone camera</a> against a guy who tried to  abduct him and got the abductor <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2003/TECH/ptech/08/01/camphone.abduction.ap/index.html">arrested</a>

As you might have seen Mark Frauenfelder and family <a href="http://boingboing.net/island/">moved to the South Pacific for a year</a>. Now they <a href="http://www.laweekly.com/ink/03/37/island-sinclair.php">found a house</a>.

BBC proves that there is <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/3096839.stm">No Loch Ness Monster</a>.  At least we still have <a href="http://www.imdb.com/Title?0107688">Sandy Claws</a>!
