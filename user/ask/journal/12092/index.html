<p>Noone liked Apple's round hockey mouse shipped with the original iMac.  It was just awful.  Too little.  Too round.  Bad designer, no cookie.<br/><br/>Some people <a href="http://www.unsanity.org/archives/000177.php">don't like</a> the newer (from 2000) "<a href="http://www.askbjoernhansen.com/archives/2003/05/whitemouse_125.jpg">pill mouse</a>" either.  <br/><br/>I am not sure what's not to like about it.  Most people rant about only having one button.  Sure, when I used LinuxPPC I sorta missed a second button.  In OS 9 I didn't at all and in OS X I honestly don't either.  I think Viridiana has something against the size, which is my only possible complaint.  It could be a bit taller for my hand.  I have to ask her what it is she doesn't like.<br/><br/>So what do I like about it?  Well, the things you become aware of when parts of your body becomes oversensitive (to put a semi-positive spin on <a href="http://www.rsiprogram.com/">it</a>).<br/><br/>I love that there's no button.  For my sore, tired arm and hand it's a total blessing to to put a bit more weight down instead of doing some awkward movement of one finger to a particular place to activate. Trust me, when your body throws in the white towel you'll know what I mean.<br/><br/>The adjustable click-tension will let you to make it work optimally for you.  I usually have mine set to the lightest setting.  If you have a heavier hand you just change it to require more pressure to click.  Viola! <br/><br/>And then it looks neat, which is never bad.<br/><br/>All that being said it seems like Apple are coming out with a <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/pages/2003/05/20030506140448.shtml">new keyboard and mouse</a>.  It's hard to judge the mouse without trying it (no major redesign except for apparent loss of the click tension thing (suck!)).   But the keyboard, oh dear, the keyboard!  From <a href="http://www.askbjoernhansen.com/archives/2003/05/newapplekeyboard.html" onclick="window.open('http://www.askbjoernhansen.com/archives/2003/05/newapplekeyboard.html','popup','width=382,height=278,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false">the pictures</a> it looks like it's getting a heavy tilt built in.  <br/><br/>That's #$%#$% backwards you idiots.  The natural position for the hands is the other way if anything!  No, years of keyboard design with optional tilt from the back has not changed it; quite the opposite.<br/><br/>
