<h2>Domestic abuse</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jdavidb/">jdavidb</a> on 2002-06-25T02:20:32</h3>
<p>That reminded me of the apartment where we lived for my high school years and first two years of college.  A man and his girlfriend and her children moved into the apartment behind us.  One night we woke up to a loud, repeated bashing sound.  It sounded like something was being thrown up against the wall.  A few days later, we noticed the little girl of the family had a broken arm.  Not long after, there was a loud screaming argument from that apartment in the middle of the night, with more crashing.  We called the police, who had already been notified.  (There were eight apartments in the building.)  The police showed up quickly, demanded entry with a loudspeaker, calmed everything down (hopefully hauled the guy off to jail for an appropriate period of time, but I wouldn't know).  This happened another time or two before the owners finally threw the man out.</p>

<p>This doesn't tell the half of how this experience traumatized me, though.  You see, I slept on our side of the dividing wall between the two apartments.  The crashes occurred on the other side of the wall somewhere right by my head.  A precious little girl had her body broken by her mother's abuser^H"boyfriend" just a few feet away from me.  I was never able to hear a child crying in our apartment complex without wondering if they were crying because of some accident or crying because they were being abused.</p>

<p>Why do some women get involved with (and keep coming back to) men who beat and kill them and their children?  I just don't understand, but I'd like to do something to help them realize they are worth more than the way they are being treated.</p>

The book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0970818106/asksplayground" title="amazon.com">the givers and the takers</a amazon.com> has some interesting ideas on how it happens that some people just let way too much abuse go their way.<br> <p> <br> <br>Actually, most of the book is about the smaller imbalances that you find in almost all relationships and why they are there (and how on a smaller scale "the giver" is just as manipulating in his or her own way as "the taker").<br> <br>Recommended.</p>
