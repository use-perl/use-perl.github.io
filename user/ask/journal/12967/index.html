<p>The rumor mill is going so fast the chain is falling off.

Apple accidentially <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/pages/2003/06/20030619233623.shtml">posted specs</a> on some "PowerMac G5" to the <a href="http://store.apple.com/">Apple Store</a> for a few minutes Thursday.  Of course some people think it was on purpose.  Why would that ever be?  To make fun of the rumor mongers?

<a href="http://macosrumors.com/">Some sites</a> also <a href="http://www.envestco2.com/macwhispers/archives/000078.php">thinks</a> we'll get new 970 powerbooks.  How excellent timing would that be?  I can only just barely get my old pismo to turn on now.

I bought Viridiana a 30gb <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipod/">iPod</a> for her birthday.  It's very neat.  Two words for the supplied windows software: Really Bad.  Maybe the <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipod/download/">2.0.1 update</a> will make it better.  Or maybe <a href="http://www.mediafour.com/products/xplay/">xplay</a> sucks less.  Or maybe she just needs a mac so she can use iTunes.

I can't wait to download Panther next week. Whee.  (Assuming they make it available on the <a href="http://connect.apple.com/">developers connection</a> site or that I ignore everything else and go to San Francisco next week - probably not such a great idea, although I think I might be able to score a free pass).

ps. Oh, and thanks for the <a href="http://www.askbjoernhansen.com/archives/2003/06/09/000300.html#000300">happy birthday</a> wishes in the comments and the umpteen emails.  I promise I'll reply to the emails before long.  It has been some busy weeks lately. 

pps. How come I never sleep before 4-7am'ish.  Is that healthy?  Are you sure?
