<p>The world is like a big nightmare these weeks.  If it had been in a movie you would have dismissed the plot.  No goverment can really be that dumb.  This dumb.  I get angry and frustrated just thinking about it.  I'm in disbelief reading the news and listening to <a href="http://www.npr.org/">NPR</a>.   Listening to news on the <a href="http://www.kcrw.com/">radio</a> and reading <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/">BBCs</a> makes me sick to the stomach.  <a href="http://www.cnn.com/">CNN's</a> and indeed most other american mass media makes me sick to the stomach over the messenger as much as the stories.

Right now CNN writes "Time's up" on their front page.  What would the answer be if Iraq demanded Bush to leave the White House?   Exactly.   It's so very backwards.  If any one country attacked the US on 9/11 it was Saudi Arabia.  Not Iraq.  As I am sure you are well aware, there were no Iraqis on the planes. None. Zero. Zip. 

On CNN they have <strike>weather forecasts</strike> graphics showing air planes flying in over Bagdadh with neat graphics of fires roaring.  They call it "Showdown: Iraq" like declaring war is a sports match.  

Who do the american administration think they are?  Trying to <a href="http://www.observer.co.uk/iraq/story/0,12239,905936,00.html">bug the UN security council</a>!  I thought that was the kind of thing you did to your enemy.  Does the Administration already realize that it's making an enemy of much of the rest of the world?

Did you see <a href="http://video.c-span.org:8080/ramgen/edrive/iraq022503_whpb.rm?start=28:10      
">Are Fleischer</a> being *laughed* out of the press briefing after trying to say that the U.S. isn't, wouldn't and couldn't try buying any votes for the war.  If I owned a TV I would watch C-SPAN.  The Onion has a hilarious article about <a href="http://www.theonion.com/onion3604/doesnt_own_television.html">a man who doesn't own a TV</a> - just like me.

The old <a href="http://www.proteinmainframe.com/ap/tv/rml_bush.html">Read My Lips</a> piece (RealPlayer required) is all too funny.  No, it's not the <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0274117">movie of that name</a>, but an excellent Bush/Blair duet from the guys at <a href="http://www.atmo.se/">Atmo</a>.  I think they made it last year, but it's all too relevant now.

Caught on Film: <a href="http://www.house.gov/appropriations_democrats/caughtonfilm.htm">The Bush Credibility Gap</a> (not related to the attacks on Iraq).  I wonder how Bush justifies his lies when he goes to bed.  Matching the rhetoric with the reality is just scary.  

Bush is acting as if divinely inspired.  Hello?!  Isn't that what we call the extremist muslims on?    If Bush had studied just a little bit of history, he would know that being a colonial power doesn't work out very well.  

Even <a href="http://www.suntimes.com/ebert/">Roger Ebert</a> is writing about this: <a href="http://www.suntimes.com/output/eb-feature/cst-edt-ebert13.html">Praying is fine, but Bush should make up his own mind</a>.<blockquote>There are of course many theologies in the world, but the two involved here have different theories of prayer. Bush prays in the tradition of a dialogue with God, in which God hears Bush and Bush hears God. This is the tradition preached by the Rev. Billy Graham, who helped inspire Bush to become born again after Bush turned to him for help with alcoholism.

The pope prays in a tradition where he asks God for the grace to make the right decision for himself, based on his own values and best effort. In this tradition, the pope has free will and the responsibility that comes with it. Free will must be absolute or it is not free. God is not a coach who allows the quarterback to make most of the decisions, but sometimes sends in a play from the sidelines. 
</blockquote>

Oh, and the CNN experts <a href="http://www.askbjoernhansen.com/archives/2003/02/03/000263.html">strike again</a> (via <a href="http://www.megacity.org/blog/archives/000359.php">Derek</a>)
&lt;<a href="http://www.askbjoernhansen.com/archives/2003/03/cnnbinladen.jpg">experts agree: bin laden is dead or alive</a>&gt;

Meanwhile the security in US airports <a href="http://abclocal.go.com/kgo/news/iteam/022603_iteam_screeners_oak.html">hits a new low</a> (via <a href="http://www.x180.net/Blog/">Duncan</a> who doesn't have an archive anymore, so I can't find his entry on it.  I did find a related entry on <a href="http://www.x180.net/Blog/1104092177.html">5 Year Old Girl As Terrorist Threat</a>).
