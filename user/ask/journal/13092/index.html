<p>Why does the conservatives think that not discriminating against gays for what they do behind closed doors "<a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/2003/0627/p01s01-usju.html">weakens the traditional family</a>"?  That's just insane.  You know, the gays are probably not going to have a "traditional family" no matter what the law says or how much they are being harassed.  And no matter what they do for themselves, it doesn't prevents anyone else from having whatever kind of family they please.  Why does conservative nuts get to use nice words like "freedom" and "traditional" for their spin?

<a href="http://david.wheeler.net/">David Wheeler</a> is in Los Angeles to install <a href="http://bricolage.cc/">Bricolage</a> for an unnamed Hollywood entity. <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/Robrt/journal/">Robert</a>, <a href="http://trainedmonkey.com/">Jim</a>, <a href="http://randomfoo.net/">Leonard</a>, Josh, myself and Kevin from the unnamed entity went to eat and be geeks at <a href="http://losangeles.citysearch.com/profile/52329/">Il Capriccio</a>. Lots of fun. And being outside is healthy, I hear.

In March I got a new 180GB drive that lasted all of six hours as my InnoDB storage device <a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&safe=off&th=47e87e5e3c4cdcd3&seekm=b49pk9%24rpu%241%40FreeBSD.csie.NCTU.edu.tw&frame=off">before crashing</a>.  Some weeks ago I finally fedex'ed it to <a href="http://www.hgst.com/hdd/support/pre_rma.htm">Hitachi</a> for replacement.  I got the new drive today and just installed it in the powermac.  172GB. Yay. That makes almost 400GB storage in my mac.  Room for more than <a href="http://www.waxy.org/projects/mp3calc/?bitrate=192&size=400&unit=gigabytes&Convert+it%21=Convert+it%21">200 days</a> of mp3s encoded at 192 kbps.  It seems like just yesterday that 400MB wasn't all that bad.  IBM/Hitachi is coming out with a <a href="http://www.hgst.com/about/news/20030106-5.html">4GB Microdrive</a> this fall.

Installing the drive on the 2nd IDE channel was a piece of cake.  The inside of the PowerMac is really nicely done. There are three IDE channels in the mac, so the second drive doesn't have to share with either the first drive or the optical drive.

Running Disk Utility is taking forever. Like watching paint try, without the bad smell.  Actually, it appears to have stopped progressing the progress bar.
