<p><a href="http://use.perl.org/journal.pl?op=display&uid=29">Nathan</a> writes about how it's hard to get stuff done without doing it yourself. I couldn't agree more.<br/><br/>In particular on the projects that inspire people to paint bikesheds it seems to be much more likely that you get anything done if you keep it to yourself or  a small group. Open lists inviting everyone to help out doesn't work at all for some types of projects. <br/><br/>Over at <a href="http://jobs.perl.org/">jobs.perl.org</a> we started out on the <a href="http://archive.perl.org/jobs-discuss%40perl.org/">jobs-discuss</a> list, but except for lots of ideas and thoughts and new colors for the bikeshed nothing happened for a long time.<br/><br/>We didn't get anything ready until I made a new list for those who wanted to actually do something with just myself and  <a href="http://www.urth.org/">Dave Rolsky</a> and we just went ahead and got it done. (There was one other volunteer whos name I've sadly forgotten; I'm sure he had the best of intentions but he never got time to do anything).<br/><br/>But I digres. What I wanted to say is that CPAN seems to be one of the most popular things to repaint and make new blueprints for. But not a lot of people actually do anything to build something.</p>
