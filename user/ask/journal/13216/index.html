<p>Using an old 15" monitor I found in the closet now.  It's tiny.  I'm sure modern PDAs have better resolution.  Actually, the monitor wasn't in the closet.  But there's another one in there.  And five old computers.  Five!  I think that's what Viridiana is talking about when she says I have too many computers.  Which I don't.  I only have what's most necessary. A FreeBSD box, a Linux box, the G4, Pismo powerbook (soon to enter the closet; I ordered a <a href="http://www.apple.com/powerbook/index12.html">12" Powerbook</a> today, yay).

Anyway, that's not why I can't breathe.  I can't breathe because it's about two million degrees in here.  The G4 is bordering on don't touch me hot.  I added more fans to the Linux box some months ago so it seems to be doing ok.  The FreeBSD box is a 4Mhz Celeron, so it doesn't make much heat.

I made an appointment to get a haircut tomorrow.  The first since sometime last year.  It just barely doesn't go past my lips when I try to put it in my mouth, so no report on taste.

Hixie of Mozilla fame now <a href="http://ln.hixie.ch/?start=1057004468&count=1">works at Opera</a>.  That's a little bit funny.

David Hyatt (ex-Mozilla, now Safari fame) disabled comments on his site becuase <a href="http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/hyatt/archives/2003_06.html#003564">people are rude</a>.

Tim O'Reilly thinks <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/3422">All Software Should Be Network Aware</a> - hear hear!

Chromatic <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/chromatic/journal/13207">read Slashdot</a> and it wasn't pretty.  So sad.

Since some days ago I have a <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/askbjoernhansen/">livejournal</a> so <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/yoak/">Jeff</a> can read my ramblings (on his request; he must be crazy!).  Yes, I am just mirroring what I have here, so if you clicked on the link and feel like you wasted your time I am sorry.

Must. Get. Back. To. Work.
