On KCRW's <a href="http://kcrw.com/cgi-bin/db/kcrw.pl?show_code=gz&tmplt_type=program">New Ground</a> the two Norwegians from R&ouml;yksopp where in the studio with Chris Douridas.  It was awesome.  I need to order their new album <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00006JKKK/develooper">Melody A.M.</a>.  BBC <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/dance/reviews/royksopp_melody.shtml">reviewed it</a>.  What does R&ouml;yksopp mean?  Smoke soup is the only thing I can think of?  They said it had multiple meanings.  What are they?


New daily read: <a href="http://www.thismodernworld.com/">This Modern World</a>. Dan Perkins won one of the <a href="http://www.rfkmemorial.org/journ_award/35th_Winners.htm">Robert F. Kenedy Journalism Awards</a>.  <cite>&#147;This Modern World&#148; by Dan Perkins (alias &#147;Tom Tomorrow&#148;) showcases multilayered satirical commentary on economic inequality in the United States, as well as the inaction of the politicians who have the power to change it. Perkins&#146; body of work also addresses subjects such as access to health care and the gradual erosion of civil liberties in today&#146;s post-9/11 world.</cite>

<cite>This being so, Rumsfeld had better watch his back. For this enthusiastic convert to the cause of legal warfare is, as head of the defence department, responsible for a series of crimes sufficient, were he ever to be tried, to put him away for the rest of his natural life.  <br /><br />His prison camp in Guantanamo Bay, in Cuba, where 641 men (nine of whom are British citizens) are held, breaches no fewer than 15 articles of the third convention. The US government broke the first of these (article 13) as soon as the prisoners arrived, by displaying them, just as the Iraqis have done, on television. In this case, however, they were not encouraged to address the cameras. They were kneeling on the ground, hands tied behind their backs, wearing blacked-out goggles and earphones. In breach of article 18, they had been stripped of their own clothes and deprived of their possessions. They were then interned in a penitentiary (against article 22), where they were denied proper mess facilities (26), canteens (28), religious premises (34), opportunities for physical exercise (38), access to the text of the convention (41), freedom to write to their families (70 and 71) and parcels of food and books (72). </cite>  <i>(via <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/jwz/180428.html">jwz</a>)</i>
