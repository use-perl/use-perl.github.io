<p>Mayday mayday, running out of burnable plastic.

Where should I buy DVD-R media (for the Apple Superdrive / Pioneer DVR-105)?

My usual pusher of <a href="http://www.newegg.com/">computer parts</a> is spectacularly overpriced for DVD-R's and the prices are not super competitive where I've last bought  <a href="http://www.tapestockonline.com/">DV tapes</a> and such (although they seem to be super cool people).

Google leads me to a bunch of places that seems like they easily could turn into infinite hassle, and infinite hassle is a bit too much for saving a few bucks.

So what to do?  And what to buy?  So far I've just used slow generic media for storing and moving data files.  I'd like more of those (although 2x or 4x speed would be much nicer) but also some higher quality media for putting into normal DVD players.  They say that the cheap generic media isn't compatible with as many DVD players?  Is that true?

Oh, does anyone know where to get clear plastic sleeves?  (Like the cheap paper sleeves with a plastic window but in all plastic).

Writing here was amazingly useful when I was <a href="http://www.askbjoernhansen.com/archives/2003/04/07/000286.html">choosing IMAP server</a> for my mail spool at home; so maybe it'll be for this as well.  :-)
