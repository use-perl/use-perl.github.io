<p>Recommendations on DV cameras would be appreciated.<br/><br/>Consumerish; I have a huge digital photo camera already, don't want a huge digital video camera too.  So size is a factor.<br/><br/>Image and sound quality is too.   You see, I try to make up for lack of skill with technical quality.  :-)  The GL2 looks fun, but huge.  Huge not good.<br/><br/>"Value for money" is important too too, but price not too much.<br/><br/>I've looked at the Canon cameras, but I just get really confused.  What's cool?  What should I look for?<br/><br/>

I've heard good things about the Sony 120.



<h2>Buying Advice</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/VSarkiss/">VSarkiss</a> on 2002-09-05T15:03:35</h3>
<p>I have a Panasonic I'm very happy with, though I can't remember the model number (it's at home, I'm at work).</p>
<p>I bought it after looking through <a href="http://www.consumerreports.org/" title="consumerreports.org">Consumer Reports</a consumerreports.org> (the print edition).  You have to pay for the actual product ratings, but they have free "Buying advice" that lists major vendors, features to look for, and so on.

<h2>My experience</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/acme/">acme</a> on 2002-09-06T11:28:52</h3>
Just after OSCON2002 I bought myself a <a href="http://www.canondv.com/elura40mc/index.html" title="canondv.com">Canon Elura
40MC</a canondv.com> which I'm very impressed with. (Disclaimer: I work for
Canon). My key reason for choosing it was its size: it is smaller than
my old Kodak still digital camera! I chose Canon as they're generally
good at hardware, and have good image stabilisation (much more
important than you think). The 40MC has DV in, which is also dead
useful: hard disk is still quite expensive so it's good to move
everything back to tape. The zoom is pretty good. I haven't actually
taken any photos with it (why?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-) and basically I'm very happy with it.
Oh, it doesn't have a built-in light, which could be a problem but
I've been ok so far. iMovie rocks.
<p>

Of course, I haven't had much experience with other cameras. I recommend
you play with one in real life first.</p>

The Elura is what I've had most eyes on so far too. I'll try finding a store where I can play with them a bit.<br> <br>The Optura models look attractive too.  I can't quite figure out what the big difference is; they look very comparable.  Grrh.
