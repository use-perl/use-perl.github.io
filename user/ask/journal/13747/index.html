<p>&lt;<a href="http://www.askbjoernhansen.com/archives/2003/07/melrose_sign.jpg">melrose sign</a>&gt;One of the fun and interesting things about Southern California is the amazing diversity. We have people from all over the world, of all sizes and belief systems.  I read somewhere that the Los Angeles school district has students speaking more than 200 different languages.  I think that was even without counting many dialects.

In <a href="http://www.weho.org/">West Hollywood</a> the police cars have rainbow colors.  The russians are living next to the jewish neighborhood. There are a lot of senior citizens.  And next to them are the gays. Small houses in the part where my (tiny and rent controlled) apartment is routinely go for <a href="http://visitors.themls.com/search/profile_page.cfm?mls=03-013893&property_type=0&pass_la=Anderson%2CAmelia">$750,000</a> or more.

&lt;<a href="http://www.askbjoernhansen.com/archives/2003/07/sunset_night.jpg">sunset at night</a>&gt;Anyway, that's not the amusing thing I wanted to tell. This is the only place I know where there are more billboards with scantily clad men than women.  Luckily for me there are plenty of scantily clad women in this town as well -- lots of eye candy for everyone.

And I mean everyone.

<i>v: I put gas on the car on the way home.  Across the street there's a club where a bunch of girls were going in, only wearing bikini tops, very short skirts and tall boots.
a: [enjoying the thought] uuh, and that's bad how?
v: I think they were men.</i>


<b>Update</b>: It's raining!  Incredible.  It's July!  Water is pouring from the sky. I don't know when that last happened. February? March? Oh, I think it stopped again already. Building a city in the middle of the desert is really not that smart.
