<p><a href="http://x180.net/Blog/">Duncan</a> is back.  Interesting things about the new <a href="http://x180.net/Blog/WebServers/IIS/IveHeardOfThisIdea.html">MS-IIS</a>.  He also tells that <a href="http://www.mit.edu/people/wsanchez/">Wilfredo</a>'s ".Mac job" was really <a href="http://x180.net/Blog/MacOS/iPod/WelcomedPod.html">working on</a> the <a href="http://www.applemusic.com/">Apple Music</a> store. Cool.

<a href="http://www.usainteractive.com/people/diller.html">Berry Diller</a> is <a href="http://www.alternet.org/story.html?StoryID=15768">opposing FCC deregulating</a> the media industry.  Very cool.  I know people who (know people who) talk to him.  Am I cool too?  No?  Rats.

<a href="http://www.askbjoernhansen.com/archives/2003/05/amusedtodeath.jpg">&lt;<a href="http://www.askbjoernhansen.com/archives/2003/05/amusedtodeath-thumb.jpg">[Amused to Death]</a>&gt;<a href="http://wgz.org/chromatic/">Chromatic</a> had a <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/chromatic/journal/11551">journal entry</a> quoting a news producer: <i>"For people who grew up watching war, it's time to live out the fantasy."</i>  It's such a cool album.  That reminds me of the intro to a song (the second) on Roger Water's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B0000027I6/develooper">Amused to Death</a> album.  An innocent childs voice says <i>"<a href="http://www.rogerwatersonline.com/lyrics_singles_what_god_wants.html">I don't mind about the war</a>.  That's one of the things I like to watch, if it's a war going on. 'cause then I know if -- when our side's winning, if our side's losing."</i>  They have the album in the Apple Music store too, but I don't think I can link to that.

Alternet has a story about an <a href="http://www.alternet.org/story.html?StoryID=15770">INS raid</a> on an asian restaurant.  <i>"You have no right to hold us," Asher insisted.   "Yes, we have every right," responded one of the agents. "You are being held under the Patriot Act following suspicion under an internal Homeland Security investigation." </i>.  I want to believe the story isn't true.

They also have a story <a href="http://www.alternet.org/story.html?StoryID=12062">Life on Ashcroft's Enemies List</a>: <i>No wonder the staid New York Times likened these imprisonments to the "disappearances" of government critics in Peron's Argentina [....] a man from Thailand was presented on charges of violating his status. The judge asked how he'd been picked up. His answer:   "I work with a guy named Muhammad." </i> 

&lt;<a href="http://www.askbjoernhansen.com/archives/2003/05/smoke-thumb.jpg">[Smoke Poster]</a>&gt;Viridiana and I watched <a href="http://www.imdb.com/Title?0114478">Smoke</a> earlier tonight.  I saw it twice when it came out in '95.  It was brilliant to see it again.  It's such a nice honest character based movie about a summer in the lives of five pleasant people.  Great dialog, good acting, interesting stories.   As James Berardinelli ends <a href="http://movie-reviews.colossus.net/movies/s/smoke.html">his review</a>:  <i>Its warm, pleasant glow may remind you of just how relaxing some summer experiences can be.</i>
