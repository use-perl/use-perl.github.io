<p>Don't forget to vote today if you are so enabled.  The Sacramento Bee is reporting that <a href="http://www.sacbee.com/content/politics/recall/story/7510384p-8452348c.html">recall polls are differing widely</a> so your vote just might actually mean something!

Too tired to write anything sensible now, but in brief according to me you should vote:

<ul><li>No to proposition 53 (which will tie money to construction projects and thus make the politicians unable to juggle the budget from year to year -- no wonder they can't balance it with stuff like this). In my ignorance I didn't know about this, but <a href="http://viri.org/">Viridiana</a> just explained it to me, of course it's entirely likely I got it wrong... mmnn). <li>No to <a href="http://www.defeat54.org/">proposition 54</a> (Racial Privacy Initiative).  At first it might sound like this would give less discrimination, but it's the other way around. Please say no.<li>No to the recall. It's just wrong that anyone with a couple of million dollars can make this kind of chaos.<li>Vote on someone.  With the current polls I'd probably put a not very enthusiastic vote for Bustamante.  If the Arnold-Risk&trade; wasn't looming over us I'd suggest voting for Camejo as his values fits much better with mine.
</ul>

In any case, it'll be exciting to see how it goes.

If Davis is recalled, when will the next election be? (assuming we won't get yet another recall).

Entirely unrelated, I was listening a bit to Henry Rollin's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00000C2CU/develooper">Think Tank</a> again tonight.  So much fun, so much energy. :-)  I don't think I've listened to any of his spoken words for a couple of years, but listening to it again I memorize all too much of it... mmmmn, maybe I shouldn't have had it (and the other albums) on repeat so much in the past. :^)
