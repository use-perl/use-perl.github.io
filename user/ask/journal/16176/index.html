<p>I got T-Mobile to enable GPRS ("T-Mobile Internet") on my phone the other day.  It works alright with the t68i and the PowerBook.   I used <a href="http://www.taniwha.org.uk/">Ross Barkman</a>'s "modem scripts". With the right script with the magic "use GPRS" commands I just had to choose the correct "CID" and enter "internet2.voicestream.com" as the phone number.  I also setup a "Data account" on the phone; I'm not sure I actually needed to do that.

A few odd things:
<ul><li>The T68i (or OS X) can't figure out to have both AddressBook.app and the PPP connection connected to the phone at the same time. <li> I get a 10.x IP address, having a public address would be slightly more convenient. <li> The latency is about a billion years.   Alright, that's not true but it's around or more than a second.  Not fun for interactive connections (understatement meaning: that really fucking sucks). <li>I haven't tested the transfer speed, but it seems better than normal GSM data (9600).  I was mostly going to use it for interactive connections I don't really mind whatever it is.</ul>

I can't figure out if I could use the $10 "T-Zones" service rather than their "Internet" service which is more.  I only need web access and ssh.  Can they really tell if you use the phone as a modem rather than just use data from the phone?  That was what the customer service person told me.
