<p>Damian's in NYC this week, and as a side benefit, he spoke to NY.pm. Since I'm within reasonably easy travel (even commuting distance if you're nuts) of the city, I popped on over to say hi and touch base.<br/><br/>It's always nice to see Damian in action--some day, when I grow up, I hope to be just like him. (perhaps a little taller and less australian, but...) It's both amazing and daunting to watch him go. Amazing because, well, he's amazing in action. Daunting because I teach classes sometimes, and, well, I'm not as good as he is. But, then, who is?<br/><br/>Anyway it was cool to meet a bunch of the NY mongers, and to touch base with the folks I'd met at previous conferences and such. We shall have to do it again some time. Perhaps when Guido comes to talk... :) </p>

Bummer! I wish I had known someone that was going as I would have made the trek as well. At least I've head Damian before, but you can never get enough Damian
