<p>I need to switch over my DSL service reasonably soon, from the one provided by work (which I don't work at any more) to DSL I'm kicking in for myself. (5 IP 192K SDSL is a bit more than I'm willing to pay for on a regular basis) This isn't that big a deal, except the new service is 1 IP only, and done via PPPoE. So I need PPPoE support, and IP masquerading on my linux server.
<P>
PPPoE is pretty simple, it seems--get the RP package, install it, and go. (I don't know if it works yet as I need to run some wiring first, but it loooks good so far) Not rocket science, though I fully expect things to go bang because of old PPP configs from years ago. I can deal.
<P>
Masquerading support, though, is a different matter. It turns out my kernel doesn't have support for it. I'm running a RedHat 2.2.19 kernel, as this system started out as a Redhat 6.something (or maybe 5.something, it's been ages) system. Not a prob, except that masquerading support isn't enabled. So it's off to reconfig my kernel, something I've done all of once (when I enabled appletalk support a few months ago). Of course, I find that IP masquerading doesn't <em>work</em> with this particular kernel source--the build throws fatal errors. That means grabbing a generic 2.2.20 kit and hoping like hell for the best. It's building in the background, and I have this nasty feeling that I'm going to lose support for something in the process. (My linux box is a Compaq Presario 2266 with custom just about everything but the disk and network cards)
<P>
As long as the disks and network works I can live, but it is nice to have video and sound. OTOH, it's a 300MHz original Celeron, so it's definitely less than snappy doing pretty much everything. The shiny new iBook definitely blows it away there.
<P>
Hopefully the damn thing will at least fail to eat its file system when it reboots. That would be good.</p>

Who is your new DSL provider? Did you try Speakeasy? They have lots of flexible services at reasonable prices. And NO PPPOE. There is really no reason you should have to use a service w/ PPPOE.
<p>
Speakeasy is definitly not the cheapeast, but the service is great and well worth the extra money. Theie support folks have a clue, and are server friendly. I have 604/128 w/ 2 static IPs for $60/mo. My service has only gone down once in the last year, not counting the times I forgot to pay the bill.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>

I'm using SNET DSL. They're my local phone company and, despite having been eaten by SBC, they seem reasonably clued. I've had bad luck with non-phone-company DSL providers going away, so I admit I'm being cautious. If the phone company goes down, it's time to pack it in entirely.

I hear you about DSL folks suddenly dying. But Speakeasy isn't trying to be the cheapest, hence less worry by me about them going away. And they use Covad, so should SE die (heaven forbid!) you could always use Covad's ISP. Of course if Covad dies... SE says they have backup plans, but of course no details are fothcoming. But all in all I'd bet that SE is here to stay.
<p>
You should talk w/ some of the PacBell folks who have DSL in CA. From what I've heard, being the telco is no advantage to them...</p>

<h2>RP PPPoE</h2>

I set this up with Verizon DSL a while back in Pittsburgh on my Linux laptop, and shockingly enough it was _incredibly easy_, with basically no snags at all.  Strange for not-so-common networking things on Linux, but true.

I've had Speakeasy for about a year (in Los Angeles) and I've been very pleased so far. They get you multiple static IP addresses and proper reverse dns and such if you ask for it.
