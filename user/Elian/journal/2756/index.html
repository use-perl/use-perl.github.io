<p>Now that I'm officially funded by The Perl Foundation, it means that it's time to use my Travel Allowance. Last week's PythonCon (SPAM 10, don't ask, as I don't know) ate a bit of it, and some of the summer cons will use some more, but that leaves a fair chunk of time reasonably free.
<P>
I'm trying to keep my calendar up to date on <a href="http://yetanother.org/dan/">my spot</a> on the YAS website, so you can check in there to see if I'm in the area. If I'm not...
<P>
Book me! An announcement will go out on use.perl's main page and to the news groups (and list of PM mailing lists I've collected) as soon as I get something formal together, but if you're interested in having me speak at your local PM meeting, by all means drop me a line at dan at sidhe dot org (Yeah, I know, but I get enough SPAM as it is) and see if we can coordinate something.
<P>
If you're not a perl mongers group we may still be able to work something out, so don't let that stop you. (Things might or might not fall in the class of things the grant's travel allowance is appropriate for, but try anyway and we can probably work something out)</p>

If you've received money from the Perl Foundation, what are you developing?  Or was this for speaking engagements?
<p>
And what is "PythonCon", hmmm?</p>

I'm the designer of Parrot, the engine behind perl 6. (Though the money is partially to fund me speaking to users groups) Not a whole lot, but it keeps me busy.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br> <br>PythonCon 10 was, well, the most recent python convention. I was there being subversive.
