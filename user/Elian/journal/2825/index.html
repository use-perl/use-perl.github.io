<p>I finally found something about the iBook that peeves me. (Well, besides not having two batteries, but that's OK) It goes to sleep when you put the lid down. And there's no way to stop this.
<P>
Now, all the other laptops I've had have had this as an option, but you could turn that off. Not with my iBook, though. This is darned annoying when I've got it hooked up to an external monitor, keyboard, and trackball, since I don't <i>need</i> to have the lid open. Don't even <i>want</i> the lid open--more chance of things breaking.
<P>
Oh, well, I suppose I'll live. :)</p>

<h2>Heat</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/garth/">garth</a> on 2002-02-13T01:49:53</h3>
The reason for it going to sleep is that it supposedly uses the keyboard to vent heat, and thus it probably isn't a good idea to have it running with the screen against the keyboard. A couple of <a href="http://www.macworld.com/tips/collection/35060.html" title="macworld.com">sites</a macworld.com> seem to agree with this.
<br>
<br>While I haven't tried it with mine, I have read that if you plug the AV dongle in, it doesn't go to sleep when you close the lid. This is so you can watch DVDs on an external TV, but that probably isn't what you want.

Alas, it does go to sleep with the AV cable. Just tried. Which is one of the things I wanted it to stay awake for. (The other two being for working when hooked up to all the external bits, and for using it as a whopping great MP3 player plugged into the car stereo<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

<h2>How I solved this</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jdavidb/">jdavidb</a> on 2002-03-06T18:47:45</h3>
<p>My ibook runs debian.</p>

<p>BTW, I now have another problem: does anyone know if apm runs on powerpc?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

Yeah, but that involves running Linux. I'll do that if there's nothing better for the platform (like, say, my x86 box, and Be just doesn't cut it there) but in this case there's something far better handy.  <br> <br>I'll just have to go nudge some folks until the magic incantation's revealed.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

<p>Please post if you find out because eventually my machine may go back to dual booting.</p>
