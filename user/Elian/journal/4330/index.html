<p>Dunno about anyone else, but I've been getting smacked the past few days by what I can only assume is virus or worm generated e-mail. You know the type, a bogus subject, no or very small body, an attachment, and a From address that doesn't actually match the original sender. (And for me is often someone from the Perl5-porters mailing list)<br/><br/>They're not a huge problem from a technical standpoint, since my mail server's on the end of a reasonably-sized DSL connection, and I get to it from my home LAN at 10Mb. Still, it's troubling, and I feel sorry for anyone paying by the minute for service. (They seem to weigh in at about 120K each, and I've been getting 20-30 a day of the things)<br/><br/>One more reason to hope for the quick (it's already painful) death of Outlook, which seems to be the delivery agent for this crap.</p>
