<p>So, I'm working on the first draft of the answers to the "Ask the Parrot" questions, and I'm hitting an interesting quandary. For at least some of the questions, the <i>real</I> answers are likely to be almost entirely meaningless (if not downright confusing) while <i>useful</i> answers to the questions won't actually be the right answers. Leads to the question "Which should I choose"?<br/><br/>Personally, I'm tempted to put the real answers in deal with the resulting confusion, as I think it'll be more useful in the long run. Still...</p>

<h2>Why not both?</h2>

Any reason not to put both in?  Well, besides the fact that it's more work<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)

More work is an issue. If I do both I might as well not bother with the real answer, though, as nobody'll pay any attention to it.

Care to give an example of the conflict? It could be possible to phrase things in such a way that you say "well it's $foo, but in reality you're going to be more interested in $bar because..."

Well, the "Philosophy behind Parrot" question (which is a very good question) for one. That's the biggest. The "It's really X, but you probably are thinking of Y" won't work there--the gap between X and Y is rather large. Also potentially counterproductive, as Y really doesn't answer the question and, worse yet, will lead people to think that it <i>does</i> answer the question.<br> <br>That makes up my mind, though. The right answers go in. I'd rather seem nonsensical than be actively misleading. Thanks.
