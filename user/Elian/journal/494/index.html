<p>Okay, so this is a combined sunday/monday diary thing.
<P>
For reasons I don't quite understand, I arranged for a morning
flight. An early morning flight. A <I>really</i> early morning
flight. Nothing quite like rousting the kids out of bed at 4:30 AM to
head off to the airport. (I really need to get the other car running)
The first leg, from Bradley to Chicago, wasn't at all bad, probably
because everyone was asleep. The Chicago to San Diego leg, though...
<P>
For some reason I don't understand, the woman in the seat in front of
me didn't figure out that the reason I kept kneeing her seat was
because she'd managed to set her seat back too far and was wedged
against my knee. (I'm not huge--6'1" isn't, by any means, big, but
planes are apparently designed to comfortably sit your average 10 year
old kid) <I>That</I> was just loads of fun. My knees still hurt, and
it apparently whacked my back some. Joys of getting old and creaky, I
suppose.
<P>
I also noticed that I read too darned fast. I brought a volume of
Ranma 1/2, three volumes of Maison Ikkoku, and four volumes of Fushigi
Yugi on the flight with me, and I blew through all of them (the Maison
Ikkoku stuff twice) before I was halfway through the second leg of the
flight. I'd also brought along <I>Angel Sanctuary</I> and the first
volume of <I>Orphen</I> with me on DVD. They would've been a good way
to spend the rest of the flight, until I realized that they might not
be the most appropriate things to be showing in public, at least in
their entirety. (With subtitles no less, so everyone can see the
dialog :) The question, of course, is what am I going to do on the
flight home?
<P>
I did notice a couple of interesting things, though.
<OL>
<LI>People, when their behaviour is taken as a group, are clueless
fsckwits. It's got to take at least three times longer than really
necessary to get everyone off the damn plane. (You notice these things
from the very back row)
<LI>People, individually, are clueless fsckwits. I saw people who
needed to go to the bathroom while they were serving lunch. These
folks, from the very front of the plane, followed the food cart all
the way to the back. And grumbled that the flight crew wouldn't get
out of the way. (Like those carts had any place to go. Sheesh)
<LI>Planes are deceptively simple, until you look under the
surface. Then they're amazingly complex. (And the simple things, like
getting passengers off the damn plane, function the worst)
</OL>
Dunno for sure what this means for perl 6, but it means something. I
shall have to ponder it some.
<P>
Monday was actually kind of nice. I had a tutorial to give in the
morning, and it felt like it went OK. That's always a releif, because
I get really nervous before these things. (Being in the morning
helps--I am not a morning person, and it apparently doesn't matter
that I'm three hours west of home. 8:30 AM is 8:30 AM, no matter what
the timezone difference from my local time) Got a massage in the
afternoon (Best $20 I've dropped in a long time. Being cooped up in a
plane with squished knees killed my back) and kicked around a bit.
<P>
Sat in on Simon's perl 5 internals talk. Now <i>that</I> is a good way
to get queasy after lunch. :) The talk was great, it's the subject
that's nasty. Met and chatted with some folks (I'm making an effort to
socialize this time. And yes, if you've seen me around the conference,
it does mean I'm even worse normally), then grabbed a light dinner and
hit the p5p impressions night. The impressions of Damian were pretty
amusing (crikey!) but things petered out pretty quickly. Perl geeks
are apparently not all that funny.
<P>
After was the p5p meeting. Wasn't entirely a waste of time, but pretty
close to it. (We didn't even have any glasses flung. I was
disappointed) Not too surprising, as we didn't really have anything
pressing to go over. This is a good thing, on the whole, but I think I
should've cut out earler. I'll know better next time.</p>
