<p>This is one of those 'begging' sorts of journal entries, but I'm currently at something of a loss.<br/><br/>The folks with the German Perl Workshop asked me, last fall, if I'd be willing to come out and speak. As I had a good-paying job pending, I said sure--I figured either the job would come through, or the GPW folks would have funding sufficient to get me out.<br/><br/>Well...<br/><br/>That good job is, 11 fricking weeks later, <i>still</i> pending. (I assume it's just dead and they've  not had the courtesy of returning my calls and e-mail) I'm still unemployed and, while job hunting, not in a position to spring for the tickets. The GPW, meanwhile, is also short of cash, and while they've graciously offered to put me up if I can get out, there's still that whole "getting out" problem.<br/><br/>That leaves me needing sponsorship of some sort, either corporate, personal, or training. (Yes, I do teach beginning, intermediate, and advanced perl classes, and'll speak to companies about perl 6 and/or parrot) Unfortunately, as my stint as a fundraiser for TPF shows, I'm not that good at rustling up cash.<br/><br/>So, anyone know of a company or companies interested in helping an itinerant Perl Guy make it to Germany for March?</p>

<i>So, anyone know of a company or companies interested in helping an itinerant Perl Guy make it to Germany for March?</i> <br> <br>Does it currently look as though you'll make it? Mark Overmeer told me that there are rumours according to which both you and Schwern will be in Bonn. Needless to say, this would be exciting news!

It's looking very unlikely at this point, unfortunately.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:(
