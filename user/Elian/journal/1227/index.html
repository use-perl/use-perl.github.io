<p>The new apple stores are downright <i>evil</i>. Stopped in one last night and saw the G4 laptops with the widescreen displays. DVD player, huge (and sharp) screen, gobs of memory, hard drive space, and enough Unix under the hood that I could build parrot while watching a movie. What's not to like?
<P>
It's times like these I regret not being independently wealthy. :) Time to go flog the street for a training gig or two, I think.</p>

<h2>Get an iBook instead</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/hfb/">hfb</a> on 2001-11-10T17:32:38</h3>
<p>I had a Ti but traded it for an iBook since the screen, though smaller, is sharper on the iBook, the iBook is smaller and more durable and the Ti scratches easily, gathers static and fries your legs when on your lap.</p><p><p>I adore the iBook and for only $1200 you get a small, light, rocking little computer that, in my own opinion, far outclasses the Ti. Maybe the next gen of Ti will be better but give it a pass for now.</p>

<p>And yes, those stores are evil. They have one up at the North Shore Mall near us and it's hard to avoid going there even though I loathe malls.</p>

Yeah, but, but, but... the Ti's got a higher geek factor!<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
<br>
<br>Your point is well taken--I've cooked my legs with laptops before, and that's just no fun. The G3 ought to keep up with the 450MHz PIII laptop it'd be replacing, and that's good enough. (Anything that can play movies on a plane is, by definition, Good Enough) Time to budget for the mid-range one, I think. (Pity they don't take dual batteries, which is the nicest thing about the HP I've got now, though that second battery's at the expense of the DVD drive)
