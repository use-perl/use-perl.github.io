<p>So, I've installed OS X on the Power Mac downstairs. No problem, got it on the 'net, ran the software updater, installed iTunes (the version that doesn't nuke the world in odd circumstances), twiddled with it--the whole deal. Straightforward enough, right?
<P>
Yeah, right.
<P>
So, I dig around and find Terminal. Took a bit, as the beast is swapping horribly. But, on the other hand, it is running with only 64M of RAM and the minimum's 128. (I remember when 64<em>K</em> was a lot, but that's just me being an old fogey) Telnet over to my linux box because SSH doesn't work. Telnet. Yech. That works though, and I can fire up pine just fine. Then try and telnet back. No dice. SSH? Apparently not.
<P>
Turns out this box has all inbound services disabled. That wouldn't be a problem (it's really a good thing all things considered) if it was easy to reenable the damn things. It looks like telnet's doable, but I'd as soon not. And sshd doesn't even want to fire up by hand.
<P>
Grrr. No different from any other unix box--they're all a stupid pain to set up the first time--but I'd hoped it'd be easier...</p>

<p>Go to <a href="http://www.crucial.com/" title="crucial.com">Crucial</a crucial.com> and load up while it's cheap. Heck, I have an iMac with a decadent 1 GB of RAM that I got for just a little more than $100!</p>

<p>Also, ssh should work by default. Jarkko grumbles about the terminal app frequently but, hey, this is NeXT OS all over again just with more screen licking goodness!<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) I still bear the scars from NetInfo....</p>

Ah, that's too much work. I'm off to <a href="http://www.pcsforeveryone.com/" title="pcsforeveryone.com">PCs for Everyone</a pcsforeveryone.com>. It has the advantage (I think--this is arguable) of being a block away. Don't even need to hop on the T, and I certainly don't have to wait. Waiting is bad! And at $17 for a 128M stick of used RAM (and I don't see a reason not to go used--semiconductors either work or don't) it's hard not to pork out both slots in the thing...

did you upgrade to 10.1(.1)?
<br>
<br>ssh wasn't in 10.0.
<br>
<br>sshd should just be a checkbox in one of the settings; at least that's how I recall having enabled it.

Yup, I started with 10.1, so it was there. I finally found the twiddly bit I needed to set to enable the thing. It was a pain to find, though. (Generally what I'd consider a Good Thing, except when it gets in my way...<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
<br>
<br>Ah, well, it beats having a zillion OS X boxes hanging around the net screaming "Hack Me!" to every skript kiddie on the planet.
