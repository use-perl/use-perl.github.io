<p>I'm giving a parrot status talk at the Boston perlmongers meeting wednesday, and trying to do the meet 'n greet at BioITWorld in Boston wednesday and thursday, so I figured having some benchmark numbers would be a good idea.<br/><br/>Now, with parrot I've been shooting for an overall 20% faster than perl 5. Nothing fancy, nothing revolutionary, just a good solid chunk better. 20% faster seems achievable, and I'd consider it a success if we did that. 30% faster and I'd be thrilled. So I ran our MOPS benchmark.<br/><br/>MOPS is a stupid benchmark--all it does is count from 1 to 100 Million. It was originally designed to do really simple things so we could judge opcode dispatch speed. We've versions for a bunch of languages. We've even got a postscript version.<br/><br/>Running this for perl takes 479 seconds. Not bad--we are going to 100 million after all. (This is on my old 300MHz Celeron box)<br/><br/>I take a shot at running it for parrot. We've three versions of it, just because. The trivial version, with the JIT enabled, takes all of 2 seconds to run, but that's hardly a fair comparison with perl, as it's all integer math. (Real machine ints no less, not even integer PMCs)<br/><br/>Running the truly equivalent version takes... 125 seconds.<br/><br/>But that's not all. Parrot, by default, builds with -g and no -O of any kind. (We are, after all, pre-alpha) Just for chuckles, I rebuild it with -O3 (which turns on pretty much all of GCC's optimizations)<br/><br/>With -O3? The run takes 103 seconds. Almost 20% faster than the original, and more than 4.5 times faster than perl 5.<br/><br/>Add in a trivial optimization (adding the integer constant one, not a variable with the value 1) and the run drops down to 80 seconds.<br/><br/>I think I'm not going to worry quite so much about hitting my 20% faster mark. :) </p>

<p>How does the equivalent in Ruby do?</p>

Good question. Unfortunately I don't have a ruby interpreter on my test box at the moment, so I can't get exactly comparable results.
<p>
A quick run on the iBook here gets me:</p><p>
<code>
perl:           193 sec<br>
Ruby:           255 sec<br>
Slowest Parrot: 26.7 sec<br>
Fastest Parrot: 6.7 sec
</code>
</p><p>
So we're looking pretty good there. (That's all with no JIT, as there isn't one for the PPC yet)</p>

I've considered doing this, but we can't do it just yet as most of the shootout examples need a couple more ops to be added to Parrot. We know all benchmarks suck, but this is a relatively popular one so we might as well give it a try. Oh, and the test harness for the shootout isn't the clearest piece of code I've seen...

When we've got sufficient code in to do a reasonable percentage of the shootout code, yes we will.
