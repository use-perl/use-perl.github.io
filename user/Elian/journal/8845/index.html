<p>Well, it was five days and four presentations (travel days definitely do <i>not</I> count, no matter how much I wish they did) but the seattle trip's done and I'm finally digging out. (Just in time to head to the Little Languages Workshop at MIT this Saturday) Here's a quick wrapup.<br/><br/><ul>
<li>SPUG: Gave the short parrot and perl 6 talks. Ran about two hours, total, things were pretty well received. About 30 folks showed up, give or take.
<li>Microsoft: This was going to be 45 minutes of perl 6 and 45 minutes of Parrot, but after two hours of perl 6 we ran out of time. (Plus another hour or so with some folks at lunch) The video should be online somewhere, though beats me where.
<li>RubyConf: This was the parrot talk, and it ran 45 minutes or so, and was pretty well received
<li>OOPSLA: This was on the object system we're building for parrot, and let me tell you, I was way out of my league there. (Though at least I had the honor of not being one of the boring speakers. I hope) 
</ul><br/><br/>The one thing I found most interesting was how many people (mainly at amazon, though I'm sure there are other places locally) didn't know I was coming, or that there's even a Seattle perl user's group. Pity, it'd have been cool to speak at Amazon, or to have a bunch of them come to one of the talks.</p>
