<p>IDG's running this new conference, BioITWorld, starting in Boston, so, since it's close, I'm here, (Right now on a couch on the exhibit floor, actually) and will be both days, modulo a visit to O'Reilly and Sasuga Books tomorrow. Perl's big in the BioInformatics realm, and this looks to be a good chance to both get a feel for how perl's used and works for people, and to do some fundraising for the Perl Foundation.<br/><br/>Pity it's kind of difficult to actually get in contact with the people using perl--the exhibit floor's mostly vendor sales folks.<br/><br/>Anyway, if anyone's here, look me up and say Hi.</p>

<h2>Some questions</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/djberg96/">djberg96</a> on 2002-03-13T19:16:02</h3>
Bioinformatics is something that's starting to interest me.  I know absolutely nothing about it, which is probably part of the reason I'm attracted to it (i.e. something new and different).
<p>
Anyway, I've been on the lookout for jobs out on the East Coast.  I'm just wondering how you like the Boston area and if you had any recommendations for ideal areas/suburbs to live in.
</p><p>
Looking at the postings for Bioinformatics centric jobs, it looks like most want their candidates to be double majors in biology and programming, something I don't think is a very reasonable expectation (though, what do I know?  For all I know there are *tons* of Biology majors who've picked up Perl along the way).
</p><p>
Do you have a feel for how strict those folks are with regards to having a Biology/Life Sciences background as a prerequisite?  Or could the essentials be learned on the job (or with a semester class)?
</p><p>
Good luck with the plug for the Perl Foundation.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
</p><p>
Thanks.</p>

Alas, I can't be all that much help. I don't live in the Boston area (at least not for East Coast values of 'area') and I don't have a whole lot of biology knowledge. Not much for squishy things, alas.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br> <br>Judging from the folks here, though, a strong information/signal processing or algorithmic background would stand you in good stead, as would a good statistics or mathematics background. When you get down to the bioinformatics level, it's almost all information.
