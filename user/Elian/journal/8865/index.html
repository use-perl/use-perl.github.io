<p>Well, the LL2 workshop's come and gone this year. A good time was had by pretty much anyone who wasn't really fond of Lisp Macros (I admit I took a potentially unwarranted shot at the lisp folks, but I think I can live with that. Dunno if it showed on the audio), but that's OK.<br/><br/>Video's up at <a href="http://ll2.ai.mit.edu/">the LL2 site</a> if anyone wants it.<br/><br/><b>Update</b> looks like both the audio and in some cases the video of the audience is in the stream. Haven't looked enough to find the snide comment, but I probably ought... :)</p>

I didn't realize it was a recurring thing or I'd have pushed to get perl6 talks in there.  Two Python talks and nary a perl6/parrot one?  That's wrong.  The grammar support in perl6 is worth a talk of its own.<p>

Even more amusing, I was the session chair for the python talks. The irony wasn't lost on me.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br> <br>There should be one next year. A grammar talk would definitely be in order, as it's one of the things that everyone hates to do. The MS research guy even talked about it as one of the places people fall down. (Doing grammar parsing with regexes and such)<br> <br>I really, <i>really</i> want a parrot talk next year. Everyone's writing languages and doing VM stuff, but they do the VM stuff because they have to, not because they want to. Nobody seems to like implementing languages, just designing them. Go figure.
