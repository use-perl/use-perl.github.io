<p>The perl foundation grant has run its course, so now it's time to find alternate funding. We got a lot of good work done in the past six months, and I'm happy with the progress that we've made. More needs doing, of course, but lots has been done.<br/><br/>Unfortunately that means I get to do the whole job hunt thing, as my family's grown accustomed to eating and suchlike things. Committments are making it tough--I've promised, as part of the perl 6 effort, to do the Zurich session, as well as doing the OS X tutorial. (And unlike OSCON, Ora's OS X conference doesn't do honoraria for tutorial sessions) That sucks time, as well as cash. (As ETH isn't paying for the Zurich trip, nor for any YAPC stuff after if I do that, and it's two weeks I can't work)<br/><br/>So, it's hunting time. Consulting, training, freelancing, and maybe telecommuting. Whee, fun, since it's me and a half-million other unemployed computer folks. If anyone has any really odd stuff they need done... (As I do C, perl, SQL, and all manner of bizarre things) <a href="mailto:dan@sidhe.org">drop me a note, please</a></p>

<tt>If you aren't already on the jobs@perl.org mailing list <br> &nbsp; &nbsp;see lists.perl.org <br> or checking the website, then you might want to do that. <br>  <br> Not only will you see job offers (some of which are <br> telecomute, but most of which will be local out-of-area <br> positions), but you'll also see the odd short-term contract <br> need. <br>  <br> If nothing else, the continual stream of postings can keep <br> you refreshed as to the sorts of skills folks are hiring <br> for, which can help when crafting resumes and inteviewing. <br>  <br> Best of luck<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) <br>  <br> I'll be in your shoes a year from now when the wife and I <br> move to Portland. <br>  <br> -matt <br> </tt>
