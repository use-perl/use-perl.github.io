<p>Thursday was a real heads-down day for me. There wasn't anything I felt obligated to go to, and I still didn't have my talks finished, so I spent most of the day working on them. Unfortunately I also managed to get a migrane started around lunch, which was just <i>so</i> much fun. I've never had one before, and I'm always up for trying something
once, but I think once is enough for me.<br/><br/>I also got a chance to talk with Ewan Birney  in the afternoon, after catching his keynote. That was good, and it gives me some things to make sure work for Parrot. Integrating well with Java will be a Good Thing, so we'd damn well
better make sure it happens.<br/><br/>The evening saw the Perl Foundation BOF, which was pretty useful, and I'm glad we had it. A bunch of stuff we hadn't thought of came up, Dave Cross volunteered to be the new Perlmongers coordinator type person, and we picked up a number of people that're willing and able to do stuff. (Including people who've been willing and able for a while but we didn't get coordinated enough to do anything useful)<br/><br/>After the BOF was the LAN party and auction, organized by the inimitable Casey West,  hosted by the folks from DynDNS, and lubricated by Stonehenge. Evil Plots (well, <i>an</i> evil plot) was hatched, and we shall see what comes of that.<br/><br/>Then was the P5P party, a rather low-key affair this year. We're all getting a bit older, and we're at a lull in things, so no great vigor. That 5.8 was just gotten out is likely a good part of that--everyone's just wasted from getting that set. (And a damn good release it was. Yay, Jarkko!)<br/><br/></p>
