<p>Wednesday came and went, which was reasonably good. Spent most of the morning down at the <A href="http://perlfoundation.org">Perl Foundation</a> booth. Not a huge amount of foot traffic, but that's OK. Got to talk to a bunch of folks about the foundation, and had the chance to talk with a some folks that I've been trying to hook up with. That's always keen.
<P>
Oh, and I spent the day toting around $titch, one of the stitch dolls that Robert brought. (I sort of ended up his caretaker Tuesday afternoon) I think it annoys the Python folks, but they're amusingly stuffy and fun to tweak. 
<P>
The first session of the morning was Damian and Larry's Perl 6 talk. Sat with Chip and Allison and, while most of it was stuff I knew, it's always interesting to hang around with Chip, and there was an interesting "Aha!" moment with multimethod dispatch. The afternoon was a bit more booth time, and then Damain's preparing for perl 6 talk.
<P>
After dinner were the BOFs. Went to the Ruby BOF, but alas the only people who showed were perl folks looking at ruby. Amusing but, alas, not useful. Then to Casey's "Who's code is it anyway?" thing. This stuff always seems more amusing when I'm not paying attention. OTOH, Chip does improv well, and you can always recreate Hong Kong Kung-fu movie action scenes with Stitch dolls.
<P>
The cool thing of the day happened at the ActiveState party. Turns out the Z-machine (yes, the engine that does Zork) has continuations. Who'd've thunk it? Not only are we 30 years behind Lisp, we're 25 years behind text adventure engines...</p>

I spent many hours playing on my Commadore 64.<br> <br>Here is one of my favorite things to do: (Besides cuss at it)<br>---<br> <code> <br>Clearing<br>You are in a clearing, with a forest surrounding you on all sides. A path<br>leads south.<br>On the ground is a pile of leaves.<br> <br>&gt;count leaves<br>There are 69,105 leaves here.<br> </code>
