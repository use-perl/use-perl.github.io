<p>Well, I'm back from YAPC::EU and the perl workshop at ETH. Suppose I ought to throw something up here.<br/><br/>YAPC was great, and it was really cool to meet a bunch of folks I wouldn't otherwise run into, given the costs and hassle to get from the EU to either YAPC::NA or OSCON. (I do <i>not</i> envy anyone stuck on a plane from the EU to the US west coast) A good time was had, and I learned a valuable lesson about pub crawling with London.pm people.<br/><br/>The week before we spent in Zurich, with two days of public workshop/conference/whatever, and three days around it locked in a room hammering out perl 6 stuff. Those three days were probably the most intense time I've ever had--the process was incredible, and I'm pretty sure I wouldn't have survived a fourth day. Still, I think the semantics of method calls, sub calls, prototypes, and variable typing is nailed down. The syntax is a little up in the air, but I don't do syntax, so that's fine. :)<br/><br/>The scariest thing is that I'm almost looking forward to doing it again...</p>

Don't, under any circumstances, attempt to match Greg McCarroll when drinking. Very, very important. (Note that I learned this by observation and anecdote, rather than firsthand experience, as your average five-year old child can drink me under the table<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

In my defense I did not attempt to keep up with Mr. McCarroll.  On numerous occasions I relinquished the opportunity when offered to have Yet Another Drink.  I have learnt my lessons at many-a-london.pm gathering.  Although I'm not sure that others had been a party to the same intense degree of training.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

Heh. I wasn't implying that anyone at the outing was attempting to demonstrate the folly of that action, though some of the folks at the other table (who were there when we arrived)  might've been foolish enough to try.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

Oh dear.  I'd forgotten all about those loons.  Of course the lunacy that night didn't really start until *after* Greg and i had returned to the hotel.    Everything was quite civilized up until that point, and then everything became strange.<br> <br><nobr> <wbr></nobr><i>/me declines to say any more at all</i> <br>
