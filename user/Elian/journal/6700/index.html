<p>Friday was Parrot Talk Day. All Parrot talks all day. Leon Brocard,
the illustrious acme, was my partner in crime, and a good time was
had. I did manage to finish all the slides before the talks they had
to be given for, though I admit that I was working on the last set
while Leon was talking. Luckily the slides took far longer to go
through than I expected, so I didn't have a dozen left uncovered for
that--I just didn't bother with the last dozen slides. :)
<P>
The Town Meeting was next. This year was just a general TPC/OSCON
meeting, rather than a perl town meeting, and it was rather less
interesting. The exact same questions were asked this year as last. I
swear, next year either we're going to put together an OSCON FAQ and
stick it on everyone's seat, or I'm going to run to the mic and just
rattle through all the obligatory questions and get the damn things
out of the way from the start. The easy access to wireless <i>did</I> provide the
opportunity to be snarky, which was fun. Alas, while Rael was on #perl
while he was on stage, it didn't occur to me to try and get him to
crack up until after the event was over. Damn. Something for next year
too. :)
<P>
After everything was done, a horde of us went out to the Gaslamp
district for dinner and a movie. Dinner was Mexican (which was good)
and the movie was Goldmember, which was also good, though not great. I
definitely, <i>definitely</i>, recommend seeing parody/homage movies
with perl folks. Especially Chip, Elaine, and MJD. Wildly fun, and
some of that was even the fault of the movie!
<P>
Afterwards, in three or four duelling cabs (no, don't ask, it's scary)
everyone made it back to the hotel. Nat had bequeathed his booze hoard
to the booze horde (OK, Ingy) and much silliness occurred in Ingy's
room. 'Twas fun, definitely. Lots of folks came and stuffed themselves
into too little room, but that's OK.
<P>
Tom Christiansen even dropped by, as he was around both to visit at
the conference and for the pride weekend that was immediately
after. (I may have to mug Tom and steal his t-shirts--he's managed to
find some really cool tie-dye) Spent some time chatting (but not
chatting up--I am rather older than he is) with the guy he brought
(the term "boytoy" was bandied about, but that's <i>not</i> fair) and
it turns out that he's a CS major at OSU, so we may well have
recruited someone else for the Parrot effort.
<P>
Oh, and if I was short or distant to anyone during the conference, I
do apologize. Between the undone talks and the nasty migrane, I wasn't
as social as I should've been until after the talk sessions on
friday. (So send me mail and catch me for stuff if there were things
that we didn't manage to get to!)</p>
