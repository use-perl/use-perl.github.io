<p>I'm looking to book my hotel for OSCon this year. I'm going, of course, but... $185/night at the cheapest, if I'm lucky, at the convention hotel. More likely somewhere around $200-210, not including taxes, fees, and whatnot. (Which likely brings it to around $250 a night) Yeek! While the Perl Foundation grant covers travel to some extent, there's a limit to what I want to burn the cash on. (Not to mention the issue of taxes on the travel portion of the grant, but that's a separate issue)<br/><br/>The Courtyard by Marriot in the Gaslamp district's $127/night base rate, which seems much more reasonable. Still a bit of a haul (about 4 miles) from the convention, but $80/night in savings covers a <i>lot</i> of cab fare.</p>

<p>Damned right it's expensive! But it helps to share a room -- it's even less than staying by yourself at the Marriott. I'm staying at the convention hotel, but am splitting the room with a friend. That he happens to be a Java advocate and Ant committer hopefully won't reflect poorly on me!<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)</p>

Under other circumstances I might, but... Given the number of talks I'm presenting, I think I'd just as soon have a room to myself. (Ignoring the issues of finding someone in advance to share the room with) Folks are coming to see good talks, and I'd rather not disappoint for lack of quiet time beforehand.
