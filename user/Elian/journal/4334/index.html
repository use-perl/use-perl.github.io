<p>Now I'm getting worm mail whose body claims it's a cure for the worm it's actually carrying.<br/><br/>So, why the fsck does <i>anyone</i> run Outlook? I don't get it.</p>

<h2>Mail Filters</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ziggy/">ziggy</a> on 2002-04-19T23:04:07</h3>
methinks it's time to write a plonk filter for that sender.  If you're not using procmail or Mail::Audit, it's a great reason to start.
<p>
There's a mail virus that *really* likes me; it's sent me about 100 pieces of spam in the last month, roughly totalling 50MB.  I read most of my mail on the server, so this works for me (no download-and-delete issue on the downstream pipe).</p>

Unfortunately they're all coming from different people--I don't think I've gotten two from the same person yet. I'm a little hesitant to just start throwing mail filters at the problem yet. I get a fair amount of unsolicited email as it is, and I'd rather not take the chance of throwing away someone's real mail.<br> <br>I'm running OS X, so it's not like I'm vulnerable to this particular problem. It's just damned annoying.

I installed SpamAssassin and haven't looked back.  Between procmail and SA, I can nuke most spam.  I don't shitcan spam, I store it in a folder that I check once every couple of days to see whether any unspam was accidentally trapped.  I believe they call this "gray" mail (as opposed to black and white shitcanning or passing through of email).<p>

LOL, just this past week I had a <b>quick</b> conversation with 'The Helpdesk Gestapo' when they came upstairs to install a new software package on my laptop:<br> <br> <b>helpdesk guy</b>: Oh, so you don't use Outlook for mail then?<br> <b>me</b>: Er, no, I prefer Mozilla thanks.<br> <b>helpdesk guy</b>: Well you <b>do</b> know that Outlook is the corporate standard and we don't support any other software.<br> <b>me</b>: Yes I'm <b>well</b> aware of the corporate standards with regards to Microsoft software.<br> <b>helpdesk guy</b>: Well, you really need to use Outlook going forward.<br> <b>me</b>: (lying through teeth)Ok I will, thanks.<br> <br>I've had the same (or similar) conversations with various members of our on-site helpdesk 'team' and it does no good to get into an argument with them about it.  I now just grin and say 'ok' just to get them out of my cubie<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

At some point last year we were given a fancy four-color booklet titled "[CompanyNameWithheld] Antivirus Quick Guide".  I pinned it to my cube front wall and used a black marker to make it even quicker: "Step 1: Don't Use Microsoft Products."<br>

Well, OK, that just changes the question a little - why does anyone work for a corporate?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>
