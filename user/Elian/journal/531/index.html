<p>Or over, at least.
<P>
The biggest problem with rolling out a design is all the stuff you
didn't know about. I had about five conversations at the conference
that went pretty much like:
<blockquote>
<B>Me:</B> Here's my design for the guts of perl 6.<BR>
<B>Them:</B> Oh. Have you considered <I>X</i>? (For some random value
of X)<BR>
<B>Me:</B> D'oh!
</blockquote>
I am <I>profoundly</I> glad that we didn't start implementing the core
six months ago, like I was really itching to do. (Yes, I really was,
though almost nobody believes that) I'm not sure if all those
conversations will ressult in things being done differently--I really
do like the design we have now--but I've a bunch of research to do to
find out if there are things that are better. That would really suck
to have to do if we'd done six months of implementation.
<P>
Oh, and in case anyone cares, character encoding sucks in ways that
are so deep and profound it's mind-boggling. Think Unicode'll solve
the problem? Wrong! I only wish it did.
<P>
Even once you convert your data to Unicode, if you can even <I>do</I>
that without losing information, that's only the first step. How do
you sort and compare it? Is a string with all Japanese text bigger or
smaller than one with all Arabic text? (And don't even get me started
on comparing Japanese strings with Chinese ones, since the two can
potentially use the <i>identical</i>Unicode characters, only they may
mean something else entirely, and certainly sort differently) Then
there's mixed-language strings, which are even worse for those
languages that use overlapping sets of characters. (How do you tell
that a phrase embedded in a Chinese string is Japanese or, in some
cases, Korean? That's important for purely mechanical things like
sorting and comparison)
<P>
Feh. String data sucks. I think I said that, though.
<P>
That means that, unfortunately, we need to tag strings with both
encoding types (Like UTF-8 or UTF-32) but we also need to tag it with
a locale. (Not to be confused with locales, which are a completely
separate field of suckiness. Go ask Jarrko about that) Heck, we really
need a way to properly
tag <I>substrings</I> with locales, so we can tell if a chunk of the string
is Japanese and not Chinese. Or even French and not Spanish. (Don't
think you get off easy ignoring the world outside the US and Western
Europe--different countries sort and compare accented/umlauted/tilded
characters differently)
<P>
String data <i>definitely</I> sucks.
<P>
On the other hand, life's not entirely bad. (Nat's gift of .NET books
from O'Reilly aside... :) Akira's out on DVD. Yay! (I am Pioneer's
mind-slave) It's a sweet transfer, and it looks and sounds really
nice. I even got lucky and found one of the two-disc collector sets
that's got a zillion production sketches and other nifty bits on the
second disc. I don't much care that it's in the tin, but it is a keen
little gimmie on top of it all. I can even tell the subtitling's
better than on my aging VHS version. (I'm one of the few folks in the
US to have the subbed and not dubbed tape, apparently) My Japanese
isn't actually good enough to tell what they're saying, but it's good
enough to tell that what was on the tape's subtitles wasn't quite
it. (I learn languages oddly. Go figure)
<P>
Oh, right, before I forget. Everyone should head over to the <a
href="http://www.yetanother.org">YAS site</A> and see about donating
to them for sponsorship stuff. They're the folks responsible for
sponsoring Damian this year. (And maybe next year, I'm not sure) While
I'm not entirely sure his wife thanks us for it (We, as a community,
definitely owe her big time), we as a community have benefitted
enourmously. Even if it's only $14 a piece (which is 2 lattes at
Starbucks, or half of Serial Experiments Lain Vol 1), every little bit
helps, and it does add up quickly.
<P>
And on a final note, if you happen by and see that <A
href="http://www.aimostudio.com/oldgallery/fanart/Haiku.jpg">this</A>
is by background, it's probably a clue that it's not a great day... :)
(I do rather like <a href="http://www.aimostudio.com">Aimo's</A> art,
though probably not the pieces you'd expect)</p>
