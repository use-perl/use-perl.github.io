<div class="span8">
<p>I've rewritten my <a href="http://www.puffinry.freeserve.co.uk/regex-extension.html">recursive regex</a> implementation, and I think it actually works properly at last.<p>
I have started wondering about the feasibility of replacing perl's regex engine with PCRE. The regex engine is supposedly pluggable already, but it looks as though plugging in a completely different regex engine would still be non-trivial. Any thoughts?</p>

<h2>Non default replacement</h2>

How hard would it be to make a module that caused all regular expressions lexically to use PCRE rather than the default one?<br> <br>Just a thought.  And secondly, what are the benchmarks like?

Doing it lexically would be trickier, because you'd have to either add a new set of OPs for the PCRE versions, or at least a flag for the existing ones. I was thinking it would be more along the lines of <code>use re 'debug';</code> (which is to say, not lexically scoped).
<p>
The first stage is to write a simple XS interface to PCRE, and then we can do some sensible benchmarks as well.</p>

<h2>Named backreferencing.</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Elthek/">Elthek</a> on 2002-05-23T15:50:33</h3>
I really enjoyed the recursive regex page.<br> <br>You mention:<br> <blockquote><div>The cure for this ill is to allow capturing groups to be named rather than numbered, and to decree that such a name remains in scope until another group is encountered using the same name.</div></blockquote>.. while talking about compositionality.  Has anyone looked at implementing this in either the Perl5 engine or PCRE?  Is anyone planning to?  I'd like to have a crack at it, but it'll probably take a long time and be horrifically messy; though I've studied Kleene Algebra/FSAs etc, I haven't hacked that deeply into the Perl source or regex engine before.<br> <br>Any thoughts?  Think it'd be a valuable thing to do?<br> <br>- Chris.<br>



<h2>Implementing re::pcre</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Simon/">Simon</a> on 2002-05-23T16:15:51</h3>
This is obviously something I've been thinking about recently. My concerns are mainly to do with what parts of Perl expect various things from the structure of a <code>REGEXP*</code>. For instance,  many of the regexp magic variables (<code>$+</code> and the like) dive into the <code>REGEXP*</code> structure directly. That may not be too much of a problem, since you can use <code>optimize.pm</code> to dike out those <code>GVSV</code>s and replace them with calls to a function in the <code>re::pcre</code> library.
<p>
So other than that, it ought to be pretty plain sailing. If you're going to do it, I'd suggest using the POSIX interface to <code>pcre</code>. Oh, the other thing to think about is what happens to regexp modifiers in <code>toke.c</code>. Your wrapper functions will have to take a Perl <code>REGEXP</code> structure, decode it, feed the arguments into <code>pcre</code> and then decant the results back.</p>
