<div class="span8">
<p>Recently I've been playing with <a href="http://www.ocaml.org/">O'Caml</a>, which is a charming language.<p>
It has a source filtering mechanism called <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/camlp4">camlp4</a>. At the heart of it is an extensible replacement parser, which makes it almost trivial to change or extend the language. One of the <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/camlp4/manual/manual006.html#toc16">examples in the manual</a> adds a new loop construct in six lines of code.<p>
Of course, camlp4 itself is written not in ordinary O'Caml but in the <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/camlp4/manual/manual007.html">"revised"</a>
(formerly "righteous") syntax invented by the author of camlp4.<p>
It's interesting that several of the "big" changes planned for Perl 6 are already features of O'Caml: extensible syntax, currying, stable multithreading.<p>
Oh, and it's (conceivably) <a href="http://www.bagley.org/user/doug/shootout/lang/ocaml/">faster than C++</a>.</p>

(I've begun using lexical subs as well some time ago<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-).)<br> <br>Do you know Scheme? One interesting thing in Scheme is continuations, which Ocaml (to my knowledge) is lacking, but parrot is promising to deliver.<br> <br>Scheme and Lisp in general are the prototype of extensible syntax languages. I haven't tried camlp4 yet, so dunno if it's going to be as clean.<br> <br>There are quite fast (and some very fast) scheme implementations as well. One thing that might make Scheme more similar to Perl than Ocaml, is that it's (generally) dynamically typed - some say that's a good thing.<br> <br>Currently I like the Scheme/Lisp syntax, it's clean, and it helps learning to think cleanly about all the zillion things one is doing with xml technologies - maybe it's even a fine implementation language for all of them.
