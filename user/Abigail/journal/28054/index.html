<div class="span8">
<p>This weekend, I finished the book <em>Op dun ijs, het verhaal van Peter Mueller</em> (On thin ice, the Peter Mueller story). Peter Mueller is an American speed skater and coach. The book tells the story of his (ice) life, first as a speed skater (he won the Olympic gold medal on the 1,000 meters in 1976), then as a coach. As a coach, he started with small countries like Austria and France, then moved to the Netherlands, first as a coach for the national team, later as trainer/coach for one of the commercial teams. Nowadays, he's trainer/coach of the Norwegian national team.
<p>
The book lets Peter kick against anything and anyone that crossed his way. For Peter, there are only two kinds of people in this world: people that are loyal to him, and bitter enemies that backstab him. There doesn't seem to be a middleground, and unfortunally the book focusses more on negative things than on positive things. The book is interesting in the sense that it lets Peter do all the talking - but that's also the greatest weakness of the book. A lot of accusations are made, but there's no room for anyone else to tell their side of the story.
<p>
Recommended for anyone interested in speed skating. The book is in Dutch, and I doubt there will be an English translation. But outside of the Netherlands, and possibly Norway, who's really interested in this sport?</p>

<h2>Speed Skating</h2>

Since you're such a fan of speed skating, I though you might like to know that my Perl code and I played a small* part in helping
<a href="http://www.catrionalemaydoan.com/" title="catrionalemaydoan.com">Catriona LeMay Doan</a catrionalemaydoan.com> win her Gold medal at the 2002 Olympics.  She came to the aerospace lab I work at <a href="http://www.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/multimedia/picture/engineering/nrc-iar_2m_tunn_e.html" title="nrc-cnrc.gc.ca">
to test different suits</a nrc-cnrc.gc.ca>.  She was very easy to work with; no "I'm a star" attitude, unlike the two male skaters that were here at the same time.<p><p>
* <small>The word "small" is here used as a short form for "almost infinitesimally insignificant compared to many other factors"</small></p>

All this is really unfair. For those of us who <i>are</i> interested in cycling or speed-skating, I think you owe it to us to translate these things. After all, it was only very recently that Tim Krabb&#233;'s <i>De renner</i> was translated into English, and wow, would I like to read more of that. But I'm too lazy to learn Dutch.

You think that's unfair? What's really unfair is that we have to pay a lot more for English language books than US or UK people. And we have an extremely limited selection to choose from.
<p>
If you fix that, I'll translate the book<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)</p>

You translate Flemish cycling coverage for me, I will send you books from America's large selection of them<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)
