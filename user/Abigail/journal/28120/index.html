<p>Yesterday, we did a 22.5km hike. More than half of it was over old, mediaeval quays. Since we have had a lot of rain the past weeks, the quays were very muddy, which made that the hike was a lot harder than it usually would be. But it was all worth it. We say thousands of birds, swans, ducks, several species of geese, common coots, great tits, birds of prey and more. Surprisingly many considering the season. Beside birds, there were rabbits, hares, sheep, and hunters. And we came across some <a href = 'http://static.flickr.com/36/76883465_076023447b_o.jpg'>lamas</a>.
<p>
The weather wasn't too bad for hiking. About 7 &degree;C, light wind (mostly from behind). No sun though. We didn't encounter any other hikers.  
<p>
We will do this route again; probably during spring or summer, to see the differences.</p>
