<p>During my job interview today, we were discussing working conditions, and the subject of dress code was mentioned. The company has a dress code - suits, however, IT employees don't have much of a dress code. About anything goes, as long as it isn't total rags.
<p>
A few years ago, the company tried to enforce a dress code on their IT department. But one guy treatened to quit his job the moment a dress code was being enforced, stating that <em>IT people wearing suits cannot be trusted</em>. The guy has left the company long time ago, but his statement is still often uttered in the company - even during board meetings.</p>

<p>I used to work at the Department of State in DC. Despite the fact that I was under peoples desks, pulling wire, in the ceiling, I had to wear a suit.</p>
