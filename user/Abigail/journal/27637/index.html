<p>Congrats Chicago! I'll do my best to be there.
<p>
<p>
But next year, can we please have some faster decision of when and where the next conference will be? Europe announced the 2006 conference in Birmingham at the closing ceremonies of the 2005 conference - giving Birmingham the opportunity to picth their conference. 
<p>
And please, update the YAPC website. Really, going to <URL: http://www.yapc.org> and still seeing that registration for the 2005 conference has opened as the newest news is not good publicity. And do we really need the fact that the venue of the 2003 European conference has been determined on the front page? If people want their boss to pay for a trip to a Perl conference, the outdated content of this page isn't going to help them.
<p>
Not that the site of the <a href="http://www.perlfoundation.org">Perl foundation</a> (in charge of electing the YAPC venue) isn't free of sins. Even today it has no mentioning of Chicago as next years venue - it still mentions September 16 2005 as the date to make a decision about the venue. Please, if the date chances, update your website. Keep us informed - people <em>are</em> interested. </p>

I can't talk to most of those points, but I did go ahead and add a blurb about YAPC::NA 2006 to the yapc.org main page... not sure if I'm the person that should be removing anything though.
<br> <br>
Hope that you can make it to the conference.

<p>TFP often does!  The problem is that many people volunteer and then fail to do anything.  I'm sure this pattern is familiar to anyone who's participated in an open source project for any length of time.</p>

I agree. but as you said it's the same problem that all open source projects facing. just have to deal with it like everyone else.<br><br>for a starter, i would look for perlfundation.org, yapc.org and perl.org to see if anything (other than perl development and donation) i can help but i fail to see any.

<p>
&lt;AOL&gt;Me too&lt;/AOL&gt;
</p>
<p>
If there was a 'submit event', or suggest correction link that mailed a an aliased list of volunteers, that would help immensely. Isn't that pretty trivial to write in perl?
