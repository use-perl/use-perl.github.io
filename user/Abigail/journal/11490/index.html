<p>Whee. Finally an entry after almost two years. Pudge had to update my email address so a new password could be mailed. The email address hadn't been valid for three years.
<p>
Anyway, last Saturday I give a talk named "what is Perl" at the Dutch Linux Users group. It was harder to write the talk than I expected. I only had an hour to talk, and I had no idea what those people knew about Perl. Ended up showing some useful bits of Perl (variables, typelessness of variables, hashes and arrays, regular expressions), and told some things about how Perl
is being developed, a bit of history, and at the
end, showed them how easy it is to install modules
using CPAN.pm. Went massively overtime, and still
had to skip parts of the talk. But it was fun, had
the chance to meet some new people (and old people as well, one of the other speakers was a teacher at the university, and I followed some of his classes, 16 to 18 years ago. I'm old....), and we
had an excellent dinner afterwards.
<p>
I've been invited back for some more advanced Perl topics. Yeah.
