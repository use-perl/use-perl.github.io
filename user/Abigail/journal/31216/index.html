<p>Yesterday, one of my cow-orkers was getting ready to install a SCSI card into a box. I asked him were the goat was he needed to sacrifice. Being a youngster, he had no idea what I was talking about. My other cow-orker and I explained to him that without a goat, a silver dagger and black candles, his chances of getting it to work properly were zero. He laughed, and went into the server room.
<p>
Half an hour later, he emerged. Still laughing, and claiming it all had worked. Perfectly. But then he logged into the box, the volume groups weren't there. They still aren't there, and he doesn't know what's wrong.
<p>
I told him that unless he sacrifices a goat, he'll never see his volume groups.</p>

FWIW, you can skip the silver dagger and use a spare rail from a 19" rack kit.  And burning packing peanuts make a great substitute for the candles.
