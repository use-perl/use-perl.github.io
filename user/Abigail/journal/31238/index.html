<div class="span8">
<p>I wrote a program that was monitoring three handles (pipes in this case). I want to do something when there's something to read on any of the pipes, and also when there's an error. Hence:
<pre>
my $p1 = open (...) or die;
my $p2 = open (...) or die;
my $p3 = open (...) or die;
my $BITS = "";
vec ($BITS, fileno ($_), 1) = 1 for $p1, $p2, $p3;
while (1) {
    my $rbits = $BITS;
    my $ebits = $BITS;
    select ($rbits, undef, $ebits, TIMEOUT);
    if ($ebits) {raise_hell ()}
    if (vec ($rbits, fileno ($p1), 1) == 1) {something ()}
    if (vec ($rbits, fileno ($p2), 1) == 1) {something_else ()}
    if (vec ($rbits, fileno ($p3), 1) == 1) {another_thing ()}
}
</pre>
But this didn't behave I wanted it to. Can you spot the mistake?</p>

<blockquote> <div><code>select ($rbits, undef, $ebits, TIMEOUT);</code></div> </blockquote>

<p>The first 3 arguments to <code>select</code> are value/return - on input you give a bitmask of the file descriptors you are interested in, on output only the bits corresponding "interesting" file descriptors are set. So it's likely that after the first call to <code>select</code>, all the bits were zeroed, and so for subsequent calls the arguments you passed in say that you're not interested in any file descriptors, so you never call any of your action functions. The solution is something like </p><blockquote> <div><tt>select ($rout = $rbits, undef, $eout = $ebits, TIMEOUT);</tt></div> </blockquote> so that <code>$rbits</code> and <code>$ebits</code> are never modified, with the action tests on <code>$rout</code> and <code>$eout</code>

I know, and if you look at the code, it's setting $ebits and $rbits in each iteration. $BITS is set once, and it's not modified. Just before the select loop, $ebits and $rbits are initialized with $BITS.

<p>Isn't there a module for this?  Your mistake is in writing your own buggy code instead of using somebody's better tested module.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:P</p>

I've no idea whether there's a module for this. But I'm pretty sure locating the module, reading the documentation, and convincing myself the module does what I want, and is bugfree would take longer than writing and debugging a few lines myself.

<p>Speaking of wheels, this seems an ideal candidate for a <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/POE/" title="cpan.org">POE</a cpan.org> session and POE::Wheel::FollowTail.</p>

Somehow it feels wrong to install a rather large selection of modules only to shave off a few lines of a less than 100 line stand alone script.

... specially if shaving off a few lines means writing others (probably as much as you've saved), from which at first glance you absolutely won't get what the heck they are about, and what's going on behind the scenes: that's the wrong way of abstraction.

Yes, it is called IO::Select, released with perl 5.3.7.

<h2>Wrong order</h2>

<p>Obviously, you should be doing <code>another_thing()</code> in response to <code>$p2</code> coming ready.  I wish you wouldn't post such trivial problems.</p>

<h2>fileno argument?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/runrig/">runrig</a> on 2006-10-06T16:29:40</h3>
Opening a pipe returns the pid. Don't you want to pass the filehandle, not the pid, to fileno()?



<h2>Can it really be that simple?</h2>

<p> <a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/functions/open.html" title="perl.org">open</a perl.org> does not <em>return</em> the filehandle, so it would appear that <tt>$p1</tt> and friends are not what you seem to expect based on the rest of the code.</p>

While that's a mistake in the fragment I gave, I didn't make that mistake in the program.

<h2>$ebits string is always true</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/uri/">uri</a> on 2006-10-06T21:00:03</h3>
well, you never say what you expect it to do nor what it seems to do. this is a classic case of saying it doesn't work without saying anything else. you should know better than that!<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br><br>one issue i see is that you don't handle when a socket/pipe closes. without removing a closed handle from that data it looks like it may do an infinite loop of reading zero bytes.<br><br>but the bug i see is the if( $ebits ) line. since $ebits is a char string and not likely be '0' or '', it will be true all the time. you need to either check those bits like with $rbits or do some check for any bit set (there is a ffs bit scan function somewhere out there).<br><br>and you don't need the == 1 when you check $rbits as it will do the right boolean test for you.<br><br>as for event loop modules, event.pm is very stable, trivial to learn and i think it would be even less code (and much clearer IMO) than you have now. pretty much 3 calls (looped if you'd like) to make read-events. and it will not have the 'bug' you have since it has been very clean for years.<br><br>uri
