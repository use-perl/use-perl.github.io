<p>Answering to <tt>brain d foy</tt>'s call:
<ul>
<li><b>The person who introduced me to Perl showed me that...</b> Well, the person "introducing" me to Perl didn't show me much. All he did was leaving the first edition of "Learning Perl" on my desk. I flipped through it, played a little with some toy programs, then forgot about Perl for over almost two years.
<li><b>I first starting using Perl to...</b> I had created a web site of a branch of major multinational; it was a static website mostly containing pictures and product specifications. Created from a messed up ASCII database dump and a CD of images using a shell/awk script. During the project, I realized there had to be something better than sh/awk, and I remembered that pink "Learning Perl" book. No longer having access to the book, I read all manual pages top to bottom. The rest is history.
<li><b>I kept using Perl because...</b> its form and ideas fit my warped brain. I can make it do things the way I want, unlike most other languages.
<li><b>I can't stop thinking about Perl...</b>, well, I can actually, but it requires an effort. But the language is huge, and it has a bunch of good people making up the community.
<li><b>I'm still using Perl because...</b> I'm too old and don't have the intiative to learn another programming language. I rather read a new book, and try out a new recipe in the kitchen than learn a new language.
<li><b>I get other people to use Perl by...</b> Not any more. I used to give Perl classes, and used to work in places where Perl wasn't used as the main language. But I don't do the classes anymore, and I'm working at a place that only uses Perl.
<li><b>I also program in ... and ..., but I like Perl better since...</b> SQL, C, and sh. SQL is too domain specific, with C I have to work too hard, and in sh it's too hard to do lower level stuff.
</ul>

I have no desire to spend a lot of time on something New.<br><br>Also agree on the "warped brain" thing.
