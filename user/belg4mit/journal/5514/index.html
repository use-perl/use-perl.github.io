<p>I have an entire range of Mnt TODOs.
Modules, websites, vaporware, etc.
So my question is this:<br/><br/>How do you keep track of your TODO list?<br/><br/>Traditionally a lot of my things
get hashed out on scrap paper
and stashed away in my file ladder,
never to be heard from again.
I also tend to send mail to myself
with an idea or two.<br/><br/>This doesn't work too well.<br/><br/>I've searched SourceForge, Freshmeat,
DaveCentral, etc. and found nothing
satisfactory although I don't know
quite what I'm looking for. I'd like
something lightweight, incredibly
simple interface, with a central data
store and remote access. Any ideas?
If it doesn't exist I might create it,
but I've been unable to flesh out a
good model myself.</p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

If you bash out some requirements (like how you want to use it, how much information you're likely to be wanting, whether you'll be wanting alerts, prioritising (by importance, by time it has been on the list, by function of the previous two, whatever), and all that sort of stuff), then we could be near a start.<br> <br>I'm tempted to do the 'start a committee' approach, make a mailing list (can do myself; with web archive), invite people and see what people want in a TODO program. I, for one, also wouldn't mind one (I currently use a stack of 75x125mm cards grouped according to location (where I'd have to be to do said task), project or importance depending on the colour of the moon; It all seems relatively effective).<br> <br>

I'll put more thought into a an additonal comment later, but to expand...<br> <br>One reason I tend to email myself so many little<br>notes is I have a custom CLI mailer I wrote<br>(http://web.mit.edu/belg4mit/bin/mailer)<br>It ought to be about that easy to add an entry.<br>(I should add the ability to invoke EDITOR)<br> <br>So there might be multiple interfaces, given<br>the requirements of incredible ease of use,<br>and access form anywhere. I'd guess a web interface, and some kind of CLI that might<br>map over it.<br> <br>Another thing is that management/organizing<br>entires tends to be non-trivial. Especially<br>for me, because I tend to end up with lots<br>of fragments of ideas, and to interweave<br>bits amongst various projects. So just now<br>I was thinking for the CLI perhaps a POD<br>like syntax, so that with a single invokation<br>multiple items could be added.<br> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; =item Foo<br> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Twiddle the bar.<br> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; =item Quux<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; =item warble<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; =item fiz<br> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Something pertinent to all 3?<br> <br>And data storage. Well it might be nice if<br>you could just open it up in an editor,<br>and such a flatfile scheme would reduce requirements. OTOH an actual database has it's<br>advantages, perhaps just use DBI defaulting DBD::AnyData?<br> <br>Of course another issue is that with the<br>emails, it's incredibly easy to add the<br>entries, and as previously mentioned, not<br>so easy to manage. However, actually getting<br>around to reading them etc. instead of<br>merely paying them lip service is another<br>matter. So err, I guess that goes with your<br>alert thing.<br> <br>This got a bit longerwinded than I thought,<br>and probably not too coherent, so I should<br>wander off and contemplate.

A quick bit, if a CLI is a handy wrapper<br>over a web interface (security in the web<br>(outside of exploits) is left to the end user)<br>then one needs to take some kind of security<br>into consideration. Entering a user/pass<br>everytime could be optional, but is not<br>convenient (or even say path to a key).<br>Probably an INI File for storing the info.<br>Likewise, perhaps the ability to bypass the<br>web interface if the database is local,<br>or the database is listening to an<br>socket that is accessible from the client.<br>Hrmm, ssh-tunnel?<br> <br>I suppose it seems I'm getting wrapped up on tangential details... Or maybe this is simply<br>quite an involved thing to do well, which while<br>not a problem, might explain why there are<br>few solutions.

FWIW, I've started using my POD Wiki for my Todo list. This enables me to add many different structures, and also allows me the freedom to create links from ideas to full blown project pages.<br> <br>I've only just started doing it, so I'll know better how it's going in about 6 months!

How well does it work?<br>I haven't gotten much done with this project.<br> <br>I was just thinking about it today, and decided<br>to start working on the transports soon. Had<br>some other ideas too. Like using GPG. And maybe<br>using MH mail as a possible backend/interface.<br>

It works well, depending on your expectations. Remember a Wiki is just a big notepad with hyperlinks. The one advantage it gives me is I can access and edit it from anywhere. (Of course being a Wiki, so could anybody else<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)

Unfortunately not. The interface is<br>more than I am hoping for. It also<br>seems to be lacking some of the other<br>interfaces (mail etc.). What probably<br>makes it seem like a good fit are<br>things like priority and completion<br>date, but those are not key features.<br>thanks though.<br> <br>PS&gt; When's the modulre request list coming?
