<p>I released a new version of Text::FIGlet
last weekend, not that anyone uses it
probably :-/ Anyways it was a good code-athon,
squashed many bugs (some were algorythm flaws
that left me in awe that it even worked
before ;-) It should be rock-solid now.
Who knows when next I'll get around to touching
it, not much left to do but the really hard
and less-used stuff, and maybe some
optimization (renders fine but loading
is slow and showfigfonts is glacial).
<p>
Next project is to fix [http://pthbb.org/software/flog].
I took a glance at it the other day, and
it sent shivers down my spine. Oh to be
confronted with one's legacy code.
<p>
I was contemplating ordering the last two
editions of The Perl Journal, bu the price
is out outrageous. It's not as though they
are years old, these are extra copies lying
around. Is it my fault local shops stopped
carrying it due to the problems surrounding
the change in publisher? So I read what
articles are online.
<p>
Becoming a little disenchanted with the web
community at large, and I should probably
be working anyways. So maybe I'll try and
cut back. Or at the very least update some
of my <a href="http://pthbb.org/stale.html">content</a>.
Much of it is actually older than it's marked,
I just happened to have switched to hosting
myself then :-P</p>
