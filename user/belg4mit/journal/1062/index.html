<p>Thought I'd mention the recently uploaded version of Belga Cron. It has a few fixed features, none of which ought to
compromise the apparent rock-solidness. So it's very near
release. See the TODO in the POD and vote on what's most 
important, or make your own suggestions.<br/><br/>http://pthbb.org/software/crond/<br/><br/>RESTRICTIONS<br/><br/>I'm thinking for now, Windoze users etc. ought to be content to use -X and -f until I decide whether or not to implement
non-un*x cross platform friendliness. Afterall no windoze I know of has effective UID's.<br/><br/>I've got a physics test tomorrow, and a bio test next week. My girlfriend is visting this weekend, and I've been very slack with the academics the last few weeks. So I ought to lighten up a bit. I'll still get some development done
as I'm using this at work as well.<br/><br/>And finally Bert is Dead! No more Bert is Evil!
I can;t say I found it especially funny, but it
was an interesting idea. And it's unfortunate
it had to go. Yet another homogenizing dumbing
down of the internut. Would you like fries with that?</p>

I'm kind of hoping someone has a mirror out there and just didn't tell anybody yet.  I thought it was hilarious (not in the rotten.com way of "that's so horribly twisted it's funny!", but in the way of all bizarre conspiracy theories), of course.  I'll miss it...but, then again, it wasn't mine to decide whether the world could look at it.  It's Dino's choice.
