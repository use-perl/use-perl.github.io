<p>Yesterday was the official birthday for the Copenhagen Perl Mongers, which by now is three years old.<br/><br/>So we celebrated with a technical meeting about XS and Inline::C (good stuff) and we had layer cake and chocolate milk (good stuff).<br/><br/>I haven't been a member since the beginning but anyway I would like to recapture were we are and what we have accomplished:<br/><br/><ol>
<li>We have out mailing list (a neccessity I guess)
<li>We have our homepage and we actually update it 
<li>We got a CVS server up and running
<li>We have an IRC channel, more (un)popular than ever
<li>We have had one Code-a-thon (homepage project) and we plan on having another soon
<li>We have organised a Scandinavian Perl Workshop
<li>We have organised two trips to YAPC::Europe (Munich and Paris)
</li>
</ol>
So what do we plan to do in the future:
<ul>
<li>Plan a trip to Belfast for YAPC::Europe 2005
<li>Code-a-thon weekend (Event Calendar)
<li>Help organise the Nordic Perl Workshop in Stockholm in 2004 together with Stockholm.pm
<li>Have more technical meetings...
</li>
</ul>
So all in all this looks pretty good :)<br/><br/>So happy birthday to my fellow Perl Mongers in Copenhagen Perl Mongers...</p>

I thought YAPC::Europe in Belfast would be in 2004.<p>

I guess I am still trying to change the fact that we ARE going to Belfast next year and perhaps having the YAPC::Europe in Copenhagen in 2005<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

Well, sorta.  I left Copenhagen shortly after so not much more happened.   I'm really glad you have regular meetings now, I'll surely attend next time I'm there - whenever that'll be.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br> <br>

<i>Hmmm, well then we just have to have a birthday party next march I guess, were cph.pm will be 5 years</i><nobr> <wbr></nobr>... or not.  It could reasonably be argued that the group isn't really started until the first meeting.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br> <br>
