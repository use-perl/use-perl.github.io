<p>Currently I have 5 spam mails received via the SMTP bug reporting interface in the queue for Date-Pregnancy and 2 in the queue for Business-DK-PO.<br/><br/>This is an increase and I do suspect that I am particularly seriously targeted, or am I the only one suffering from this?

Yeah, I get several spams via rt.cpan.org each week.

I guess the solution could be to address this with Best Practical, either by adding spam filtering to the mail server receiving the mail for rt.cpan.org or, since disabling the anonymous creation of tickets via SMTP are widely communicated and used.<br><br>jonasbn

I know they are already doing a lot of spam filtering, it's just not perfect.

perl.org does our spamfiltering for rt.cpan.org. Reporting to rt@perl.org (I believe that's the right address) will tell robert what's leaking through and what needs more eyes on it.

Well apart from the reporting to spam, what could the process be to handle this. One thing that bothers be is that it does not seem to address the issue in the queue without notifying the "requestor", meaning the spammer and hereby the spam probe get a positive response.<br><br>In the other RT3 installations I have worked with this mail response was voluntary, but this does not seem to be available in the rt.cpan.org installation/configuration available.<br><br>Would it be a good idea to enable this if possible??

Private comments that don't go to the end-user are very specifically not an option for rt.cpan. (We had too much trouble with them with the previous version of the site.).<br/><br/>I'd be open to other ideas, and even more open if you felt like hacking on them<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)<br/><br/>Email is a better forum for me than use.perl journals, though.
