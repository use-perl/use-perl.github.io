<h1>Bug in version.pl</h1>

<div class="span8">
<p>My little script which is shipped with Module::Info::File, the subclass of Module::Info seems to have a bug, it gives the following error: <code>"Can't call method "version" on unblessed reference at ./version.pl line 64"</code>.<br/><br/>I have not located the bug myself but I received a mail from another danish guy who got an error running it with the CGI module on a Linux box running perl 5.8.5 (perl, v5.8.5 built for i686-linux-thread-multi).<br/><br/>I have mailed back and forth with the guy in order to obtain some data to resolve the bug. Since the problem is not as simple a programming mistake from my side (unfortunately).<br/><br/>The problem is that the class Module::Info::File is a subclass of Module::Info, which is not my module and when calling the version.pl script with a module name (also the last resort), I use the method <code>new_from_module</code> from Module::Info.<br/><br/>So I have obtained the following data from the bug reporter:
<ul>
<li>version.pl is version 0.04, which is the latest shipped with
<li>Module::Info::File, which is version 0.07
<li>Module::Info, version 0.26 (which is latest version)
</ul>
I also mailed him a version, with an enable debug flag and got the following result:
<pre>
$VAR1 = {
         'name' => 'CGI',
         'dir' => '/usr/local/perl-5.8.5/lib/5.8.5'
       };
</pre>
Which also eliminates the problem if he had been using the script in an unforseen way (though the script can handle several types of arguments).<br/><br/>I also got the following:
<pre>
$VAR1 = bless( {
                'version' => '1.07',
                'name' => 'File::Find',
                'file' => '/usr/local/perl-5.8.5/lib/5.8.5/File/Find.pm',
                'dir' => '/usr/local/perl-5.8.5/lib/5.8.5'
              }, 'Module::Info::File' );
File::Find located in /usr/local/perl-5.8.5/lib/5.8.5 is version: 1.07
</pre>
This shows that the script is actually working. So I asked a fellow Perl Monger to test this script, since he was running perl 5.8.5, on FreeBSD though, but he could not replicate the problem and he got perfect data for CGI.<br/><br/>I have now mailed the bug reporter and asked him to test with other short module names like: DBI or DateTime, it is going to be interesting to see what shows up.<br/><br/>I am also working on a test to demonstrate the problem.<br/><br/>Suggestions for other attempts are more then welcome.</p>
