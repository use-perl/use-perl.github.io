<p>This entry is somewhat in line with my previous journal entry on comments in code.<br/><br/>Way too often we are so busy we do not get our code completely prepped for production.<br/><br/>This mean commented-out code is not removed, code is not peer-reviewed and POD is not updated (if written at all).<br/><br/>I have other issues like lacking tests, documentation aso. but lets stick to the topic.<br/><br/>I would live to see a proper staging process and use of a staging platform, I looked up the word in my dictionary and it said (somewhat edited):<br/><br/><quote> stage |st&#257;j| noun <br/><br/>*snip* <br/><br/>- each of two or more sections of a rocket or spacecraft that have their own engines and are jettisoned in turn when their propellant is exhausted. <br/><br/>*snip* 
</quote><br/><br/>Man, this is exactly what I mean, throw away the parts you do not need. I would love if we could would just go over the code at least once and remove the debris of the development.<br/><br/>And next we go over the code and isolate all debugging and verbose logging so it 
can be controlled using flags from a single point.<br/><br/>Other things we could do?<br/><br/>We can always adopt peer reviews when we get the time.

Nah, more in the line of:<br><br><code><br>print STDERR "We are now in func2\n";<br>print STDERR "we got params:\n", Dumper \@params;<br></code><br><br>We have a lot of such code. I attempt only to inject<br>when really desperately debugging or atleast isolating it behind<br><br><code><br>if (DEBUG) {<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... }<br></code>

<p>That&#8217;s the point: with Log4perl, you can leave it in. You configure at runtime precisely which logging messages you&#8217;re interested in (yes, <em>while</em> the program runs &#8211; not just at startup).</p>

<p>Furthermore, if you worry about expensive computations in your logging statements, you can pass a closure instead of a string, which will be invoked only if that statement is enabled. The logger call still happens, so this is not as efficient as <code>if (DEBUG) {<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... }</code> (which is completely optimised away at compile time if <code>DEBUG</code> is a false constant), but it's worlds more flexible and the remaining cost is usually negligible.</p>

<p>Log4perl is great stuff.</p>

I utilize log4perl with the Workflow distribution, but not for work currently. I will investigate if we can make use of log4perl in this setup.<br><br>Thanks,

<p>Ah, didn&#8217;t know you knew it already. A lot of people don&#8217;t, and logging is one of those things where it&#8217;s really really easy to understand and solve 30% of the problem, but it&#8217;s hard to imagine the whole problem and a lot of work to solve it well, so it&#8217;s common to get stuck at the 30% threshold.</p>

<p>I was stuck there too before I read an article about Log4perl. It really opened my eyes &#8211; I had been doing things in a pretty crappy way but it never occurred to me I could have better. So now whenever I see someone wringing their hands about log/debug statements, I tell them to look at Log4perl.</p>

<p>(After that article, I looked at other logging modules, because I wasn&#8217;t sure whether Log4perl is really that great or I just hadn&#8217;t seen any better before. Turns out it really is that great; only Log::Dispatch is close.)</p>

Well I don't - I am just bothered by unnecessary logging in already <i>crowded</i> logs.
