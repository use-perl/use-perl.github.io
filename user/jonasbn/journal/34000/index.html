<p>The summer holiday is almost over. Tomorrow I have to go back to work and I am actually looking forward even though things will be hectic and busy.<br/><br/>I have not had time to do any reading this summer and no coding. I did not bring any work with me as such - there was plenty of things I could do, but I did not have the energy. I fixed a few things to a release made just prior to leaving, but that was only about 3 hours of work.<br/><br/>So I have spent time with my boys and my wife, when there was a break I either went running or for a nap. I only went swimming 3 times or so, but the weather was not as good as last year and the water was really cold.<br/><br/>I did respond to the YAPC::Europe Committee questions to our application for YAPC::Europe 2008 and I have not heard anything further.<br/><br/>I feel very ready for the next 5 months of work, I am looking very much forward to doing some coding and work in general. Batteries are fully charged and I am so ready.<br/><br/></p>
