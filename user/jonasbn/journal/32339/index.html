<p>Got up and ran this morning at 6:30. Things are going very smooth, well everything, but the actual weight loss, but I expect it will start slowly.<br/><br/>I run 5 km. every second day and my average pace is actually below the 5 minutes/km., which was to be my third goal. So I am reconsidering my third goal and wondering whether it should be an increase in length of my current route, I know it can be extended to 7-8 km. This was the trip I ran when I was young and fit :)<br/><br/>The average pace/km has sort of increased by itself and I can feel that I run faster and faster and at a more steady pace - and things should improve even more when I loose the >10 kg, I am carrying as overweight - quite the bagage to drag around.<br/><br/>We are planning a trip to Bornholm in May, I am looking forward to taking the coastal route over there to see how it will go.<br/><br/>If anybody out there are running around with a pair of Nike+ on their feet and are in need of a rabbit/challenge I am all up for it.
I am not the fastest runner, but I am sturdy and with the improvement I have experience over the last two months, I will only become faster, so if you are in need of a challenge now is the time.</p>
