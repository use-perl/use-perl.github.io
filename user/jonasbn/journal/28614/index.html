<p>Ok, I was somewhat puzzled, I attempted to install Catalyst on OSX via CPAN and it did not work out, so I digged into the installation to see what went wrong.<br/><br/>Apparently the libwww-perl-5.805 installation broke on a missing prerequisite: HTML::Tagset <br/><br/>So I started examing the code and the Makefile.PL and I found out, that libwww-perl-5.805 mentions HTML::Tagset as a comment, but never uses the module - HTML::Tagset is used by HTML::Parser (as the comment says) - fair enough<br/><br/>So I had a look at the HTML::Parser Makefile.PL and it listed the prerequisite (at least it does in the lastest release on CPAN) and I would not expect Gisle to make such a <i>rookie</i> mistake.<br/><br/>So I started examining my installation to see whether HTML::Parser was there and it was. But I could not tell from where it had been installed on that is was located in: /System/Library/Perl/Extras<br/><br/>This directory is not something I have seen before, so after jumping around IRC looking for an OSX channel with the chance of finding a non-perl user, with a machine not tainted by CPAN installs - it came to me, my girlfriends computer!<br/><br/>So I checked it out and yes, in: /System/Library/Perl/Extras/5.8.6/darwin-thread-multi-2level, HTML::Parser was located, but HTML::Tagset was no where to be seen.<br/><br/>So apparently the standard Perl installation on Tiger holds ALL kinds of extras (interesting), but they have installed at least one module without meeting its requirements.<br/><br/>So when attempting to install libwww-perl-5.805, the HTML::Parser prerequisite is met, but the test break to a missing HTML::Tagset. <br/><br/>So how do I report this to Apple or should I ask Gisle to patch libwww-perl-5.805, the latter would be the fastest by far, but then again the <i>fix</i> does not belong there.</p>

I've never heard ot HTML::Tagset before, and it certainly wasn't needed to get <a href="http://handelframework.com/downloads/CatInABox.tar.gz" title="handelframework.com">CatInABox</a handelframework.com> up and running.

Well your machine had problably already moved past the state of clean install. The problem is not really the Catalyst install, but that Apple seem to have installed a module, without meeting its prerequisites.
