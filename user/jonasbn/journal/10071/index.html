<p>I have gotten the priviledge of maintaining the module XML::Conf for the late Ariel Brosh. This is a marvellous opportunity for me to get to learn to work with CPAN from the other side - and probably the reason why I asked for the 'job' in the first place.<br/><br/>Well when I initially examined XML::Conf for the first time, I just thought, well this module just needs some docs and some tests, but as I am working on the 0.03 version of the module, the Changes and TODO lists have become quite long.<br/><br/>This is the Changes and the TODO at the time of writing:<br/><br/>0.03  Sat Jan 18 18:48:43 CET 2003
        - Development taken over by jonasbn<br/><br/>        - Everything put under revision control<br/><br/>        - Added README file
        - Added TODO file
        - Added INSTALL file
        - Added AUTHOR file
        - Added LICENSE file
        - Added CVS tags to everything
        - Restructured distribution structure
        - Added t dir
        - Added lib dir
        - Added lib/XML dir
        - Rewrote test.pl
        - Added use of Test::More
        - Added t/basic.t
        - Added prototypes to all methods
        - Added NAME, DESCRIPTION, TODO, AUTHOR and COPYRIGHT paragraphs
        - Privatized the subs: val, setval, newval and delval<br/><br/>$Id: TODO,v 1.1 2003/01/18 18:39:09 jonasbn Exp $
<ul>
<li>Restructure distribution for easier use of test files as actual Unit-tests (will ma
ke it easier for me to maintain the module).
<li>Write tests
<li>Write documentation
<li>Add SYNOPSIS material when the tests are done
<li>Rewrite constructor to be able to handle a 'new' configuration and not just an existing.
<li>Make regression tests to find minimum versions of Tie::Hash and Tie::DeepTied
<li>Talk to Gabor (or whomever maintains Ariel Broshs HTPL distribution) about sepearating some of the modules, I for one need the Tie::DeepTied.
</li></ul><br/><br/>I have started by restructurizing the distribution for me to better have an overview of what is going on. Then I have started making unit-tests of the more basic methods to get a hang of what is going on. I am not the kind of guy who can read code as if it is a good book, I need hands-on experiences.<br/><br/>The task has proven a bit more complex than I thought, and trying to understand a module just for the sake of testing and documenting it is a bit more difficult than I thought.<br/><br/>Normally when I write or use a module I do it for some kind of reason, which is more pragmatic. But I guess that as soon as I get to know my way around this module things will speed up a great deal.<br/><br/>My goal is to have added unit-tests and documentation of all methods before I send this of to CPAN in a version 0.03. <br/><br/>BTW as you can see in my TODO I have added a bullet called regression testing, this project have spawned of a new project for me, a regression test framework, I will probably start on this as soon as 0.03 is shipped and I can start in some of the more 'interesting' tasks...</p>
