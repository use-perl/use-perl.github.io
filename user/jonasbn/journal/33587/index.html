<p>I am close to closing my goal for this month, I have set a goal on Nikeplus of 90 km.<br/><br/>Since I am aiming for the Copenhagen Marathon 2008, I have laid out this grand plan:
<ul>
<li>June 2007, 90 km<li>
<li>July 2007, 100 km</li>
<li>August 2007, 110 km</li>
<li>September 2007, 120 km, there is a 1/2 marathon in Copenhagen</li>
<li>October 2007, 120 km</li>
<li>November 2007, 120 km, Sparta free marathon training begins and runs until May 2008</li>
<li>December 2007, 120 km</li>
<li>January 2008, 120 km</li>
<li>February 2008, 120 km</li>
<li>Marts 2008, 120 km</li>
<li>April 2008, 120 km</li>
<li>May 2008, Copenhagen Marathon</li>
</ul><br/><br/>Next month (July) will be a bit special, since I will be on summer holiday, I will set a goal for 100 km, but I might surpass this since running on Bornholm is quite nice, but lets see what the legs say when I get started, anyway 100 km in July should be doable.<br/><br/>This gets me to August, a goal of 110 km will require that I run 10 km every second day and 6 km the other day. This is a variant from what I am doing currently where I run 6 km 2-3 times during the week and then 10 km during the weekend and of course with variations over that theme, since the kids, legs and weather do not always agree.<br/><br/>My goal is to run 10 km on every trip, 3 times a week, which will bring to 120 km/4 weeks (a month).<br/><br/>About the weather, I normally run in all sort of weather, but the other day I terminated a 10 km run at 5 km - the rain was really heavy - so running the 5 km was satisfactory, since I could just postpone my 10 km.<br/><br/>That is what I like about running compared to other sports, I can do it whenever and whereever I want to, I am not dependent on other people, it is just me.<br/><br/>Participating in the free Sparta marathon will make me depend on other, since these are organized trips, but it will be a grand help to somebody like me since I will be able to practice running with a certain pace and together with others. I tend to run a bit faster when running with others, which might not be such a good idea considering I have to run a marathon, but lets see when we get there.</p>
