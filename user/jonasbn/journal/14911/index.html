<p>Today was a good day, everybody in the team where working hard and we get a lot done. I got a new queue set up in RT3 for billing related tickets, which are handled by a different team than mine (luckily). So our figures cleared up a bit when all of that stuff was moved out of our queue. Some more cleaning pushed tickets to the development queue (not ours either) and things seemed to being going really well... <br/><br/>*BOOM*<br/><br/>The former team-lead of the team I am now in charge of was sacked, meaning we loose a member from our team, we loose a valuable resource, I loose my stand in - I loose a colleague with whom I normally eat my lunch and with whom drink my beer on friday afternoons... <br/><br/>I was shocked and it took some time to understand what was going on - I still don't understand why.<br/><br/>So I buried myself in work... sometimes I hate this business...</p>

<p>Picking up the slack from a lost colleague is trying in and of itself, but when it involves coding.. brrrr. Good luck to you.</p>

<p>By the way, you might be interested in reading a small rant I wrote a while back -- <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/WebDragon/journal/11823" title="perl.org">Lose the looseness</a perl.org><nobr> <wbr></nobr>... </p>
