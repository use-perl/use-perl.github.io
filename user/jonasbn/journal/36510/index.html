<p>I arrived in Stockholm Friday afternoon/evening with my wife, we met a fellow Copenhagen Perl Monger on the plane and took the fast train from the airport to the central station together.<br/><br/>After some (printed) Google map confusion we got our bearings and made it to hotel. We parted with <code>baest</code> in just before since he was going in the opposite direction.<br/><br/>After checking in I SMS'ed <code>baest</code>, saying that we would be going for a walk and dinner and then back to the hotel. I think he was a bit sick, because, he did not feel like locating the pre-workshop meeting at some local bar. I later talked to <code>tagg</code> on the phone, who was at the bar with <code>Grrrr</code> from Copenhagen Perl Mongers.<br/><br/>So my wife and I walked all over 'Gamla Stan' in Stockholm, we could not settle on a restaurant, so it simply ended with me having a kebab, before heading back to the hotel to sleep.<br/><br/>It felt very nice to be at a hotel, no kids, no noise - just relaxing.<br/><br/>I forgot to get a voucher for the hotel wifi in the lobby, but somebody left a wifi access point open for me, so I could check the wiki and stuff before going to sleep - amasing there are still so many open access points around.</p>
