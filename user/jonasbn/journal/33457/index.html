<p>I received a mail from Parallels about a forthcoming Parallels Desktop 3.0 update. You could save some money buying it now, but I went ahead since I expect to update anyway and I use this software professionally.<br/><br/>So when getting to the checkout I indicated I wanted to use a credit card. So it starts up this 3D payment contacting my net bank. I started the session in Firefox where my net bank does not work. So back to the starting point, I tried using Safari. The login dialog appeared, I entered my credentials and I got the information that my credit card could not be cleared.<br/><br/>So I went back to the Parallels website and attempted to change to payment method to back transfer. This was quite easy and the site sort of invited to this. So with the information in hand I attempted to transfer the money to Parallels. This resulted in a message from my bank saying that transfers to abroad could not be conducted between 21:00 and 05:00, crap - so I gave up.<br/><br/>Ok, so this morning I wanted to conclude my order with Parallels so I logged into my net bank. I attempted to enter all the information in to the abroad transfer form. If/when you enter something wrong in the form you get an error message. If you then correct the value and resubmit, you are told that the information is outdated. So you have to start all over again.<br/><br/>After several attempts (you have to enter alot of information). I gave up, since the clearance code for Germany was not accepted. So I went back to Parallels, chose Paypal and concluded the order.<br/><br/>It is amazing it has to be this difficult to pay something online. Paypal worked out, but the other thing would make it easier for me, due to the relation to my business.</p>
