<div class="span8">
<p>I have been working on fixing RT3 tickets for half a year now and I know I am going to do this for the next 6 months (at least).<br/><br/>The problem is that the sheer amount of work and the size of the team I am part of, I get really tired from the job (am I burning out?), meaning when I get home, I do not have any energy left to do any programming.<br/><br/>I have dreamed of becoming an ISV for quite some time and this is my ambition. But due to the factors pointed out above I cannot find the time and energy to realize this. Even though I have a network and everything it still requires a lot of foot work.<br/><br/>Apart from my ambition for my future I currently feel my career is stagnating - I do not get to do any programming and my personal preferences for a job are not fullfilled to the extent I would like to - I have tried to address this with my boss, but it does not seem to fit into his grand plan.<br/><br/>So I am considering the drastic move of terminating my current employment and going back to school.<br/><br/>I have followed an education which I never really finished -  I am not sure whether it is necessary to finish it, but I would like to use my brains a bit and do some programming again.<br/><br/>Possibly I would be able to finish my education in 2 semesters - that would mean that I would need to find out what I want to do by the end of 2004. Whether I should find a new job, start my of company or continue education.<br/><br/>Right now I am investigating whether I can start this semester, next thing will be to figure out the economic aspect. There are several scenarios - but lets see what happens...</p>

It's a tough decision, but keep in mind that changes are for the best. The economics is picking up rapidly now, and with a degree you'll have a better chance. Besides, the most important thing is to do something you enjoy. I realize how depressing your current situation can be...<p>
Just think out the economics thoroughly !</p>

Thanks for the encouraging words, the economics are of course difficult, but I live in a cheap place, I do not owe much and I don't have any children - so I think it is doable...

<h2>Try to educate yourself</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/htoug/">htoug</a> on 2004-01-07T09:17:36</h3>
I have felt the same 'burned-out' feeling that you describe. I took a decision at some point that I:<ul>
<li>would read a technical book at least every second month</li>
<li>learn a new language every so often</li>
</ul>All this after reading "The Pragmatic Programmer" [http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com] - a very inspirating book, that I can haertily recommend.<p>
I'm having a lot of fun now, trying to learn Smalltalk on the train going back and forth to work (I have an hour each way, so I can use my portable and get something done). I feel that I'm using my brain, and extending my knowledge now, and not stagnating.</p>

I have read the book twice (I have not taken up small talk yet), but I don't think the burn-out feeling is the worst. The problem is that feel like I am wasting my time at work, I could spend this time doing something MUCH more useful.
