<p>Our little family was increased with one more member Tuesday the 27th. March 2007. Our newest little boy 'Sylvester' weighs 3520 g. and is 52 cm. long. He was born by means of a planned cesarean at 10:53 AM.<br/><br/>Monday we attended a scheduled scanning, followed by a talk with a doctor. My wife requested a planned cesarean, our oldest son's birth taken into consideration.<br/><br/>So they attempted to schedule us for the following week, but we could only get a time slot the next day. So things got bit hectic anyway, but at least we got some sleep and everything went well.<br/><br/>We are all back home now and things are great, we are only a bit tired, due to new eating and sleeping patterns being introduced by Sylvester, but we are much more prepared this time and things are running smoothly.<br/><br/>I am attempting to find out what I did not get to finish and plan everything for when I get back and I also have a few NPW activities I need to attend, but perhaps it can be done, while I am on leave for the next two weeks or how for how long I can stretch it.
