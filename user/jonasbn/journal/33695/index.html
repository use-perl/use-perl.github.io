<p>My trusty old Canon Digital IXUS II bought in October in 2003, suddenly started acting up. The display on the back would be black or show a black with screen weird colours.<br/><br/>Turning the camera off and on would sometimes fix the problem. You could still take pictures, but in the end that stopped working too.<br/><br/>I have for sometime wanted to buy a new camera, but I was sorry that the trustworthy old IXUS was b0rken.<br/><br/>My wife took the camera to the shop where we bought it to inquire if what a repair might cost. The clerk asked if we had a extended insurance.<br/><br/>And guess what.<br/><br/>I signed a extended insurance eventhough I normally do not, but this was my first digital camera and I asserted that it was somewhat at risk.<br/><br/>So today I am going to pick it up, yay!<br/><br/>The story of my extended insurance for my SMEG refrigerator is completely different and has convinced me never to sign these extended insurances, but I must admit that I feel very lucky that I actually did this for the IXUS.<br/><br/>I also have extended insurance for my MacBook Pro. but not for my PowerBook, guess which one is not working :-/<br/><br/>but I am getting my IXUS back today, yay!</p>
