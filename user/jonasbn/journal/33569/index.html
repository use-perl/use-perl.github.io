<p>My workload has increased seriously. Most of the time I spend in front of the computer seems to be work related. Meaning billable hours, working on code related to or owned by clients.<br/><br/>This is of course good, but...<br/><br/>I does make me feel that I am disregarding my open source/freeware work, such as my CPAN modules.<br/><br/>I was so lucky that some of the work was directly on an open sourced module. Anyway a few nights ago I however got some work done on the Workflow module.<br/><br/><ul>
<li>I accepted and adapted a received a patch (thanks Jim)</li>
<li>I implemented some tests, raising the test coverage with a few percent</li>
<li>I added some more POD, addressing POD coverage</li>
</ul><br/><br/>It really felt good, eventhough it was peanuts.<br/><br/>My overall plan is to get as high test coverage as possible. When this is done I will analyse the code with Perl::Critic using relevant policies.<br/><br/>Based on this output I expect to refactor the code heavily, using the unit-tests to ensure nothing it broken. With the current coverage of about 68-69% we are still not at a level where I find it safe to do so, but we are slowly getting there.<br/><br/>The final product of the refactoring should perhaps be released 1.0.0.<br/><br/>Man, that would be good</p>
