<p>I have reached my first goal, I have run every second day for 4 weeks continuously. From the beginning of February I will increase the distance to 5 km and I will set up a goal on <a href="http://www.nike.com/nikeplus> where I have to run 70 kilometers in 28 days/4 weeks, (5 km * 14 days/runs).<br">http://www.nike.com/nikeplus> where I have to run 70 kilometers in 28 days/4 weeks, (5 km * 14 days/runs).<br</a><br/>My trips are much better than in the beginning and my average pace has improved, but I am not under 5 minutes/km, which will be my 3. goal.<br/><br/>The weather however is bad, the route is either wet or icy and it is cold.<br/><br/>Today was especially cold, but the sun was out, so I had a good run today. As the sun starts to rise earlier I expect I will start running in the morning, the important thing is to not run during rush hour, since the traffic is too heavy.<br/><br/>My Nike+ shoes and iPod have not let me down yet and are working without trouble.</p>

I looked at this too.  Do you like the shoes?  Have you noticed any changes in your health so far?

Nike have always been my preferred vendor in running shoes, they are expensive, but there shoes are very durable and last for a long time, I actually still have an old pair laying around.<br><br>Nike+ shoes are just Nike shoes with a small slot for insertion of the Nike+ chip.<br><br>For my health, it is a difficult time of year, so I have both had some cold, and a soar throat, but it has not stopped me from running. In general I fell very good, my weight started by going up a bit, as muscle mass increases (this is heavier than fat), but I expect my weight will start decrease at some point.<br><br>I ran 5 km today and if it was for some stop lights I would have done it in a continuous trip, but I had to alter my road due to weather conditions.<br><br>But overall I have gone from 0 to 5 km/run in a little more than a month and I feel good, mentally and physically.<br>
