<p>I have since I was working with Oracle's Workflow system wanted to implement a workflow system of my own in Perl. <br/><br/>I have regularly scanned CPAN to see where there was an existing workflow system and there was not.<br/><br/>I client of mine and I agreed that he needed a workflow system and I started implementing the first version of a Perl based workflow system around the 19th. of May.<br/><br/>Then to my surprise I discovered the other day, that an Workflow system had <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/cwinters/Workflow-0.03/">appeared</a> on the CPAN.<br/><br/>The system looks quite impressive and is currently out in version 0.03 (0.01 was released to the CPAN on the 13th. of may).<br/><br/>I will have to examine it some more to find out whether I should use this instead of my own, whether I would have anything interesting to contribute with or if I should continue with development of my own system.<br/><br/>Questions, questions, questions...</p>

<p>Thanks for the kind words! I've actually already got (and applied) a set of patches to the module from someone so it seems there's quite a bit of interest in this area. The trick is to make as many people as possible happy while still keeping it simple.

</p><p>There's a large functionality gap in that we don't implement parallel workflows, but that's grinding away as a low-priority process in my brain until YAPC::NA is over. Suggestions welcome!</p>
