<p>I went to my brother-in-law's girlfriends birthday party this weekend. It was an outdoor thing at a summerhouse. The weather was nice and we where all sitting outside drinking beer and small talking.<br/><br/>We came to discuss the aftermath of Tour de France, not the most intersting of topics, since there is so much speculation, but...<br/><br/>Apparently a 30 year old guy had <i>hacked</i> the danish participant Michael Rasmussen's email account by guessing his password. When it was first announced that the account I had been <i>hacked</i> I had explained my wife that they would probably catch the <i>hacker</i> fast since he seemed like a complete amateur.<br/><br/>He had attempted to sell the information retrieved from the mail account to a Danish news paper, for which Michael Rasmussen had been working over the course of Tour de France - so of course they had not bought the info/data, instead they had contacted Michael.<br/><br/>When I heard that the password had been guessed I was quite amused and I commented to my wife that calling the guy a hacker was a bit over the top, since there was no hack involved.<br/><br/>At the birthday party we discussed this and my wife mentioned my comment and one of the other guests, who has a law degree in IT, responded that it was more of a crack than a hack.<br/><br/>I was taken a bit by surprise and soon we where discussing more interesting aspects of hacking and legislation. The guy was actually quite enlightened from my perspective. His whole view on  legislation in conjunction with copyright and usage rights for digital media was quite interesting and I was quite surprised to discuss this with a non-hacker, who had a lot of insight and knowledge and opinions on the topics.<br/><br/>The next time I am in this forum of people I am certainly going to talk to the guy again, we have talked many times, but always about things like education, public vs. private sector etc. <br/><br/>He certainly made a lazy afternoon more interesting.</p>
