<p>I have got well underway with my documentation assignment. I called for a second information meeting with the other developmer today. We re-ran the meeting we started out with. A large part made more sense to me now that I have had a chance to look at the code. We are thinking about doing a Q and A session later on, I think this will be in a week or so.<br/><br/>I am thinking about doing an estimate for the documentation task, since I have no idea on how long this should take. I am planning to go on summer holiday on the friday the 13th. of July, so it would be nice to be able to be done by then or at least deliver the first revision of the deliverables I have set out to make.<br/><br/>I am currently writing POD, a general document on the system and a developer handbook. The handbook is however only filled with notes on namespace/overall structure, POD and unit-testing, the stuff I am currently involved in. I do not think I can deliver an especially specific developer handbook without some hands-on experience so I am thinking about asking for a development assignment for the system so I can finalize the developer handbook with a sort of reality check on all the prose and facts I am putting in the document.<br/><br/>Apart from documentation and POD I am also writing tests. This sort of let me do some coding, so my head do not fall of. It is however quite a change from programming all day - so I coding at night on either other client projects or open source projects.<br/><br/>So the assimilation proces has been halted since I am on total control of what I am doing, how I am doing it and when and I even get time to do some coding.<br/><br/>Absolutely marvellous, I am working on selling this workpackage to another department with the client, I think I mentioned this before. Let's hope they go for it, because this is actually turning out quite nicely (and it lets me ignore the fact that I still do not have contract).</p>
