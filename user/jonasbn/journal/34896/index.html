<p>The other day I was home with Sylvester (my youngest) who is sick. My wife is introducing Villads (my oldest) to the kindergarten, so I it was my turn.<br/><br/>We went to the doctor, shopping and he fell asleep in his baby carriage and I did not want to pull him up, so we went on with some business and visited two banks.<br/><br/>In the end I want to a coffee shop, sort of like Starbucks just another name. While waiting for to order I was approachedby a radio journalist. Who inquired if he could ask me some questions about coffee.<br/><br/>I agreed and he asked me the questions, sticking a small recorder, sized like and old mobile phone, in my face.<br/><br/>I forgot all about the interview, but hours later when my wife and Villads got home, I told her about the interview. She went into the kitchen to and turned on the radio and guess who's voice was coming out - mine,<br/><br/>What a weird coincidence.<br/><br/>I was quite impressed with the recorder, which I actually think was capable of transmitting the recording to the radio station for further editing, I did however not get around to asking the journalist questions about his gear, since it was my turn to order and soon after Sylvester woke up.</p>
