<p>A friend of mine notified me of a mentioning of Workflow, which I am currently maintaining on the Catalyst mailing list.<br/><br/>I am not subscribed to the list.<br/><br/>I read through <a href="http://grokbase.com/thread/2007/07/24/catalyst-using-workflow-with-catalyst-was-making-controllers-thin-and-models-thick/DUGfwILCDkqcugOcAQQZkxzqbNw#pmfQGCGrMCr4N1zKpQy_mn4fnyc">the posting</a> and I was not pleased.<br/><br/>After some days of attempting to ignore the posting I found out I could not let it go unanswered.<br/><br/>So I registered with <a href="http://grokbase.com/">grokbase</a> and attempted to reply there. It seems however you still have to be signed up to the mailing list, so I did that too.<br/><br/>I got a much more useful and constructive criticism from the author the second time around as I expected - I know the poster and I have met him in person.<br/><br/>But it was a nice heads up in these 'Tour de France' days with scandals and rumors. Remember that there are people behind the things you criticize and these people might have put a lot of effort into the work you are criticizing and if you criticize in a public forum, give them an opportunity to respond. <br/><br/>Ok it was not that big a deal, but it did ruin my sleep for single night.</p>
