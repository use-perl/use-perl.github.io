<p>The <a href="http://perlworkshop.dk/2004/abstracts/index.html">abstracts</a> we have received for NPW have been put online, the content of the workshop looks really good and the <a href="http://perlworkshop.dk/2004/speakers/index.html">speaker line-up</a> is as impressive as last year (we count 4 pumpkings this year)- I am really looking forward to a weekend of Perl.<br/><br/>I must admit I have been nervous whether we could reach the standard from last year, but it looks like we are going to succeed.<br/><br/>Now we just need the registrations to pick up - so we will have some attendees aswell, I will make some more announcements i diverse forums and see what happens.</p>

<h2>SAS--</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/nicholas/">nicholas</a> on 2004-02-20T12:30:31</h3>
<p>Finally I have fought the SAS website and won - it has let me buy tickets. Crap features I found included
</p><ol>
<li>Google links merrily to a page which is the start of the flight search; yet by step 4 it tells me that it can only sell me tickets if I'm Swedish, and sorry, if you want to change your country you have to go back to the start. ie the page I didn't even see.</li>
<li>It seems to suffer horribly from caching artefacts - it keeps telling me that it has no flights, but if I go back then forwards it will give me some.</li>
<li>Its love of using Javascript to fill out dropdowns after I select other dropdowns, not interlocked with the next button, means that it can decide that I want to use the alphabetically first airport in my chosen country (eg for the the UK, we're talking Aberdeen) rather than telling me I forgot something.</li>
<li>It's very happy to tell me all the flights at the current price, but I know that I can get some combinations at a lower price (I was looking at that price previously) and if I ask to change price there is a grinding delay, followed by a being sent back to the date selection page. I've already told you the bloody dates I'm flying on, and they aren't going to change.</li>
</ol>
Why do I bother? Why do they use monkeys to make websites, rather than user interface specialists?
