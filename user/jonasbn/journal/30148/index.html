<p>Saturday my friends had planned a polterabend for me, somehow I was suspecting something to happen, but it was a nice surprise and an even nicer event.<br/><br/>We went to a local park where we played football (soccer), and freesbee golf (with a course and everything). I had never tried freesbee golf before. The park had a nice course, resembling a golf course, but instead of a hole, there was a metal cage to catch the freesbee.<br/><br/>We also played a funny game resembling touch-rugby, but you had to where a velcro-vest and velcro thing on you behind. So you have  to throw the ball to your teammates whom would catch with the breast and if the ball fell to the ground you could only pick it up using the velcro on your behind - it was quite a spectacle and I guess the other users of the park got quite a show with 10 men running around shouting about '<i>buts</i>'<br/><br/>We went to a nice restaurent in Vesterbro and had some nice spicy food, followed by a lot of beer, but I had gotten up too early so I did not last long.<br/><br/>Next day I got up at 9:00, I could feel all my bruises and more sore legs from a lot of running - a perfect polterabend, a whole day with all the guys.<br/><br/>If any of you read this, thanks - I had a great time :)</p>
