<p>A third of the attendees showed up and I wounded up running around talking to a lot of people, unfortunately I did not get to talk to all of the people I intended, but I expect I can catch up during the conference.<br/><br/>domm came Monday afternoon to crash my sofa for one night, my oldest son was totally fascinated by his haircut, but wondered why he spoke swedish :)<br/><br/>domm has been so kind as to bring my kids some candy and a jigsaw puzzle - and some chocolates for me and my wife. It was really good to see him and this really sparked my expectations to the conference, since this is very my much what it is all about in my opinion.<br/><br/>I went out to eat and had a few beers with domm and some of the other early arrivals. I feel no stress and I am really looking forward to the conference. We never made it to the Globe as had been written on the WiKi, but I did not want to push people around all of Copenhagen.
