<p>I have had my first article published in The Perl Review, well actually my first public article published at all.<br/><br/>I have long wanted to publish something, I have several unfinished pieces on my laptop and I even inquired years ago with O'Reilly about their requirements and process for an article on 'Camelbones', which is written, but probably outdated by now.<br/><br/>The publishing process was not the normal one I expect, but I think it was good for me, else I would have been much more nervous anticipating the  actual publication.<br/><br/>The article kind of popped out of no where, by the magic touch of the fantastic editor of The Perl Review brian d foy.<br/><br/>Apparently he thought that <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/jonasbn/journal/32379">a journal rambling of mine</a> was good enough material to spark an article, so he edited, and I guess, edited, edited and edited - until something useful remained and there you go.<br/><br/>I am really proud to see a NPW special issue of The Perl Review and I can only recommend other to investigate the possibility of having a special issue for their Perl event.<br/><br/>I am also really proud to have an article in the Perl Review, even though it took my a bit by surprise and I am thankful to brian d foy, since this article is really his fault, I just ramble.<br/><br/>I do however hope this will not be my last article in either the review or anywhere, I tried publishing a few articles back in the days when I was working in a larger corporation, it seemed like a good way to communicate, but the forum was not right, the time was not right and the audience was not interested in articles on software development and the truth about <i>project warfare </i> in the current state of the company, but that is another story.<br/><br/>I actually think the article got published after a serious edit by a former colleague of mine and after I had left the company - heh.

Just want to say that it is a pretty interesting article, and we indeed hope that there are more of them coming from you down the pipe!<br/><br/>Not that I'm worried about it, mind you. Publishing is like a drug: you get a first one out, and then you feel the need to write a second one to prove it wasn't just a one-time instance. And before you even know it, you crave the attention of your adoring public so much that you can't stop... Don't believe me? Just wait, you'll see...<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)

Thanks for the kind words of encouragement - I will have to see if something that comes up is worth an article.<br><br>Thanks,<br><br>jonasbn

<p>Don't worry about that. Something always does, sooner or later.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>
