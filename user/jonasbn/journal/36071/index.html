<p>After some confusion and general <i>chit-chat</i>, the hackathon got started, I hooked onto DAGOLDEN and RJBS. It sounded as if they where digging into something I could follow and perhaps even contribute to.<br/><br/>The whole TAP thing and many of the other activities at the hackathon are simply beyond me and my interests and I have not been so good at following the QA mailing list.<br/><br/>Anyway, I attempted to pick up as much stuff as possible and I think I succeeded my head is about to fall of and I am so tired.<br/><br/>Well I got a chance to use <code>git</code> a bit and simply listened in on conversations between really clever programmers.<br/><br/>I am sometimes thinking it would be good for me to get to work some other programmers, I often work alone or with programmers on somewhat the same level - this exposure to other (cleverer) programmers is very inspiring.<br/><br/>I have tried other hackathons, but never of this size and format and it has been quite interesting up to now.<br/><br/>I am going $HOME tomorrow afternoon unfortunately, this hackathon has certainly met all my expectations and more. I would just wish I was able to contribute more.<br/><br/>Perhaps at my next hackathon, since this will not be my last hackathon.
