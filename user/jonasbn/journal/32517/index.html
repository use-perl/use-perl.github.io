<p>Today I was up and running at 6:30 AM, I reached my second goal of running 70 km in 28 days. I actually surpassed the goal with a few kilometers.<br/><br/>So now I am in consideration as to what my next goal should be. I think I can keep going every second day and I can even get up and run in the morning, apart from the weekends where I run later, but traffic is not so bad during weekends.<br/><br/>I have had two plans, either attempting to gain speed, by setting a goal for a faster pace or I could attempt to run further.<br/><br/>Both scenarios will be hard. I can see that my average pace has gotten better, so from 5.12 minutes/km in January to 5.00 minutes/km in February - and this would probably be doable, but I have no idea on what my goal should be for speeding the pace.<br/><br/>The second scenario would be to aim at running further in March, I was thinking about 80 or 90 km in 28 days - in average I run about 20 km per week, so if I could run further during the weekends I could increase this average, so should I stretch myself to 80 or 90? 80 can be done, 90 would require some serious effort and with March being longer than February I could reach 100 km for March, even though the Nike+ goals are only running for 28 days or some other intervals not compatible with calendar months.<br/><br/>It is hard to make this decision with my legs still being tired from the run this morning.<br/><br/>I will do some calculation and set a goal in two days, when I am supposed to start the next phase.<br/><br/>My weight has not decreased, but I can see on my body that things have changed, so there is nothing to do but continue. Well it does feel good to do something physical as opposed to sitting in front of the computer all day and running in the morning mean I can sit in front of the computer all day and in the evening without feeling bad.</p>
