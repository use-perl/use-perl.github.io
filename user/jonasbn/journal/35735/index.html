<p>I have been thinking about getting a new cellphone for quite some time. I have a Sony-Ericsson k700i, which can communication with my MacBook Pro via bluetooth. In addition I have a 3G USB data dongle for data communication, since the data communication via the k700i was not quite speedy enough (and the dongle got really cheap)<br/><br/>So when I say the iPhone I thought it would be nice to get a new phone and one that would integrate with my Powerbook, but apparently Apple did not want me to get an iPhone so I cannot officially buy one in Denmark.<br/><br/>I considered some alternatives like getting somebody to buy one for me abroad like in the US or UK, but I never really got around to it and my k700i still worked, but it was getting quite unstable with charging aso.<br/><br/>A friend of mine has an iPhone and she was going to London, so she asked if she should bring home an iPhone. I had just experienced my first major breakdown with my k700i being with out a phone for a whole day at a very bad time.<br/><br/>So I said yes.<br/><br/>So just a few days before my friend was leaving for London my k700i died. I experienced 3 days without a phone, most of it weekend, so that was not so bad.<br/><br/>But now I have an iPhone and it works.<br/><br/>There a few things I need to look into:<br/><br/><ul> <li>Danish keyboard <li>Terminal sessions terminating after a few seconds <li>And many other things </ul><br/><br/>But in general it just works.<br/><br/>I plugged the phone in my Powerbook and Jailbreaked it in 2-3 minutes, including activation and unlocking, using ZipPhone for OSX.<br/><br/>I then see that I am running the version 1.1.2 and an update was pending, I updated and repeated the above action.<br/><br/>I am sorry that Apple is not selling this phone officially in Denmark. It is just a piece of electronics and they should now their customers better.<br/><br/>Anyway I am happy and you can call me again</p>

For awhile, I had my iPhone on the French localization, then was bored one day on the train so I changed it to the German localization. None of the keyboards had the accented characters (or, I couldn't find them), so I changed it back to English. Somewhere in the guts various things survived. Some of the Mail and Safari stuff is still using French for the interface, the spell-suggester is using German, and most stuff is in English.
