<p>I have had Brian Ingersons <a href="http://kwiki.org/">Kwiki</a> installed and running for sometime. I use it for notes etc. it has proved very useful and works very well.<br/><br/>But today I discovered that my Kwiki was not responding in the expected way:
<code>
[Tue Apr 27 09:02:28 2004] [error] [client 127.0.0.1] Premature end of script headers: /Users/jonasbn/Sites/NotesWiki/index.cgi
</code>
Googling for Premature end of... is not especially useful.<br/><br/>All the Perl scripts associated with the Wiki compiled and it actually returned HTML when run on the commandline. So the bug had to be in the Apache configuration. So I had a look at the httpd.conf, but it also seem pretty ok, a simple helloworld test in the same directory worked ok - so I located Kwiki::CGI and had a looked at it - apparently this line made all the trouble...
<pre>
my $cgi_class = (eval { require CGI::Fast; 1 } ? 'CGI::Fast' : 'CGI');
</pre>
I have had FastCGI installed for some testing, but I do not use it anymore, but apparently it is used over CGI, when found in <tt>@INC</tt><br/><br/>I forced <tt>$cgi_class</tt> to 'CGI' and now it works again... I do not completely understand why it works on the commandline, but the force to 'CGI' does the job.<br/><br/>I have reported the <i>trouble</i> (I do not think it is a bug) using <a href="https://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/Bug.html?id=6145">rt.cpan.org</a> and I have written this journal entry in case others run into the same problem...</p>

<h2>Premature end of script headers</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/mattriffle/">mattriffle</a> on 2004-04-27T19:43:30</h3>
&gt; Googling for Premature end of... is not especially useful.<p>

That's the most basic of all Apache errors, so I wouldn't expect that it would be.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)  All it means is that the script didn't begin its output with a Content-type header.</p><p>

Which brings me to my point:  it might return HTML on the command-line, but does it begin with a header ("Content-type: text/html" almost certainly) and a blank space before beginning the HTML?</p><p>

Of course, differences in the environment between your account and the web server user could also account for the difference.</p><p>
