<p>Some time ago I contacted my hosting company and requested subversion hosting via a subversion hotel, I would like to host it myself, but I do not have the time to take care of the details.
After about a week they responded, they had setup a solution for me and I got the required users created again via the hosting company.<br/><br/>I have however not been able to nothing but browse the repository via a webbrowser, suspecting my svn-client I attempted to update to the ssl version using, fink, but I could not get it to build, so I looked around for alternatives and I located <a href="http://www.codingmonkeys.de/mbo/">Martin Ott</a>, the client on his site however did not work for, so I suspected it not being able to do SSL, but I noticed an interesting blog entry: <a href="http://www.codingmonkeys.de/mbo/articles/2006/08/24/subversion-hosting-offered-by-shelf-cloud>, so I set up an hotel with this <a href="http://www.shelfcloud.com/">Shelf Cloud</a> thing and until now it has actually worked out of the box. I also located an <a href="http://metissian.com/projects/macosx/subversion/">SSL enabled client</a> for OSX.<br">http://www.codingmonkeys.de/mbo/articles/2006/08/24/subversion-hosting-offered-by-shelf-cloud>, so I set up an hotel with this <a href="http://www.shelfcloud.com/">Shelf Cloud</a> thing and until now it has actually worked out of the box.

It is a but expensive, but I just have to get my clients to pay :)</p>
