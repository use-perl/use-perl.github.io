<p>Tonight I have mailed a lot of the potential sponsors for the Nordic Perl Workshop (NPW). At the same time I have mailed a few people whom I (we) would like to see as speakers at the NPW. I hope we can raise all of the funds to sponsor those of them who are interested in coming.<br/><br/>If you have not received a mail from me, do not be sad, either I have forgotten you or you are in my second batch - or I do not know who you are, so you need to tell be by submitting a paper.<br/><br/>Our funds are limited and our ambitions are high, so I just hope everything will work out, it usually does.<br/><br/>We are using ACT this year, ACT was used in Stockholm (2005) and Oslo (2006) so it is good to continue this effort.<br/><br/>The TODO list for the NPW is still long and I am attempting to find somebody to take over the budget stuff so I can concentrate on Speakers and Sponsors and general PR.<br/><br/>But perhaps it is just because I am tired the budget is hard to crack - maybe I should wait until tomorrow to have a go at it.<br/><br/>Everything is going according to plan and we have done this a few times, so unless something unforeseen comes up, I guess things will run smoothly.</p>
