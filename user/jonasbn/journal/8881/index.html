<div class="span8">
<p>Since I am hosting the Copenhagen Perl Mongers x-mas lunch I thought about making a quiz/contest.<br/><br/>Since it is normal to drink alot of alcohol,the quiz is quite simple, but Perl related. You simply have to pronounce names of Perl book authors e.g.<br/><br/><li>Doug MacEachern
<li>Sriram Srinivasan
<li>Gurusamy Sarathy
</li><br/><br/>and so forth... suggestions for a points system are more than welcome, and more names of course.<br/><br/> </p>

<h2>Names</h2>

You seem to have an extra "i" in Sriram Srinivasan's first name.<br> <br>And of course you'll be including the infamously unpronounceable Jarkko Hietaniemi, although I haven't quite understood what's so tricky about his name.  Maybe I'm missing some subtlety.

<h2>Hallowpeenos, anyone?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Ovid/">Ovid</a> on 2002-11-11T20:23:15</h3>
<p>Well, speaking as a reluctant citizen of the good ol' US of A, if we can't even pronouce jalape&ntilde;o correctly, I fail to see how we're going to figure out "Jarkko" (it's "yar-koe", yes?).  Heck, some pronunciations are even open to individual interpretation.  While some people pronounce "Ovid" as "ahh-vid" (which I am told is the correct pronunciation), I prefer "owe-vid".</p>

<p>Of course, I do agree that saying someone's name correctly is at least as important as adressing them as they wish to be addressed.  I have a coworker who introduced himself as "Robb" and later let people know that he's changed his mind and prefers "Robert".  I try to address him as "Robert", but everyone else seems to have ignored that.  I think that's a tad rude.</p>

But it's not the "Jarkko" that people remark on (and I believe you need to pronounce it with a doubled "k", as with Italian double letters).  It's the "Hietaniemi" that was featured in the YAPC movie, and that to me seems to be pronounced pretty much as it's spelled, if you try not to be too American/English about it -- pretend it's Spanish or Italian (except that the "h" is pronounced): hyeh-tah-NYEH-mee, four syllables.<br> <br>It's only 10 letters long, but that seems to be enough to trigger a panic reaction in some people.  Plus, as we've seen previously with Byelorussia and Hyakutake, Americans seem to have a problem with consonant + "y" sound + vowel at the beginning of a word, unless the vowel and consonant happen to be from a particular limited set of combinations.
