<p>I have been under a lot of pressure lately. Work has been pushing the limits of my sense of humour. It culminated with me snapping at my wife - not good!<br/><br/>So totally disillusioned over this and extremely sorry I went to work only to receive the bad news that my company did not get the assignment I had hoped for. I focused on something else and got through the day without making somebody else sad - and I picked up flowers on my way home.<br/><br/>The next day I was back fit for fight, I write a mail to the involved managers (project and line) and stated my dissatisfaction with the whole process. One of the managers approached me and explained me a lot about corporate politics. I had a hard time shaking the feeling, which had made me leave somewhat the same organization years ago - and I do not even work here anymore I am a freelancer.<br/><br/>Then I got an epiphany, I am working with a platform for which I was one of the primary architects. The platform, is pretty old and it has is flaws, but not many people have been keeping it up to date, actually only one guy have kept it alive and kicking.<br/><br/>Well it struck me that one of the original visions of the platform being capable of serving data from any sort of application, implemented in any language as long as it would talk our own proprietary protocol would do.<br/><br/>I immediately got a hold of the architect from the company, which got the assignment since I have been asked to represent the online team. I explained the architecture to him and my proposal, he seemed reluctant, he asked me to write this all down, perhaps to make me shut up and go away, or perhaps because it was too much information at one time, delivered at the speed of sound from an eager an impatient perl hacker playing architect.<br/><br/>So next morning I delivered a 10 page description of the setup<br/><br/>*silence*<br/><br/>The the technical line manager called me, starting to talk about my first mail addressing my dissatisfaction, I did really not want to discuss this over the phone, since I would possible get me in a situation where I would have to buy flowers for him as well. So I started about talking about how to move on, referring to my proposal. He just responded, <quote>But we are just going to <code>iframe</code> everything</quote><br/><br/>*clunk*, I think my jaw hit my desktop.<br/><br/>I said to him that I had to think and that I would get back to him shortly. I immediately started to collect material on why we do <b>not</b> like <code>iframe</code>'s in the online environment.<br/><br/>And this morning I called my technical lead (and old architect colleague) for whom I am currently filling it, to get the details in order.<br/><br/>So now it is back to the drawing board and my proposal will be updated and filled with arguments on why we should to the right thing.<br/><br/>I am seriously considering my future as a freelancer with this client, everything is so uphill and headless chickens are roaming the office celebrating 2008 as the year of bad decisions.
