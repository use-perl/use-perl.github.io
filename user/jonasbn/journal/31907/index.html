<p>I am continuing as a consultant with my current gig to the end of the year and as it looks right now I will probably continue for some months in the new year.<br/><br/>Anyway, I received a mail from a technician, a regular employee the other day, just 5 minutes before leaving.<br/><br/>I have been giving to assignments, implementing web GUIs to some technical backends, so I went over the two received specification commented on them and sent the revised editions to the respective authors one of the specifications had a lot of issues, so I suggested a meeting and luckily the guy (another consultant) showed up at my desk and we got the most critical issues out of the way pretty fast and I was able to continue.<br/><br/>The other guy however sent me a mail, inquiring what I was I was doing with his service. In my comments to his specification I had only requested the renaming of a single parameter, a long shot if the service was already put to use, but in order to strive for uniformity between the technical backends and at least for out side I tried.<br/><br/>I left work somewhat annoyed by his tone and attitude, this was a good thing.<br/><br/>When I later same afternoon wrote back to the guy that I had been employed to do implementation of the web part utilizing the API outlined by him in his specification I was much calmer and I did not write anything I would later regret.<br/><br/>Same night I received an even longer response...<br/><br/>He dismissed my suggested change, which I understand, but then he started to explain to me the problem with the features I was expected to use as if it was me who had requested this quick and dirty implementation.<br/><br/>I am in a completely different department and I know nothing of the inner workings encapsulated by the web service API's we use.<br/><br/>So I started writing a VERY long mail explaining the guy, my situation and the task at hand - then I thought of it, I would only escalate the problem and the guy's irritation with the requirements to his work, which was something imposed by people in his own department - so I just wrote a thank you for his response and that I would address the issues he mentioned with my project manager.<br/><br/>The situation is that we are timewise under such constraints that we can only succeed if we use the quick and dirty solution - but that is not for me to communicate to this guy.<br/><br/>So I backed of and thought of back when I had to write an apology to a complete development department after having roasted them for committing non-compiling code into the SCM of the project, I was in charge of the build process at that time, I was stressed, I was tired, I did not agree with the project manager on how to approach things and I was younger.<br/><br/>So eventhough this guy attitude bothered me, I know from experience that is probably has to do with anything else but my email. </p>
