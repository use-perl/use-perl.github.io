<p>This journal entry covers the last 2 weeks of my Perl activities.<br/><br/>I responded to a mail from the YAPC::Europe committee. It was not easy and required several calculations and assumptions, <a href="http://www.yas.org/">YAPC::Europe</a> is more than a year away and we still have no idea whether it will be in <a href="http://belfast.pm.org/">Belfast</a> or <a href="copenhagen.pm.org">Copenhagen</a>. But luckily we have some experiences from organizing the <a href="http://perlworkshop.dk/">Scandinavian Perl Workshop</a> in April.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.dkuug.dk/">DKUUG</a> has agreed on co-hosting the YAPC::Europe 2004 if it comes to Denmark.<br/><br/>Well now the mail has been sent now I can only hope for the best (eventhough none of the members of the <a
href="http://copenhagen.pm.org/">Copenhagen Perl Mongers</a> would mind going to Belfast AFAIK, including myself).<br/><br/>For the programming part I have been doing a lot of cleaning up, not as much as I had hoped for, but I am on summer vacation and the weather have been great and I have spent time with a lot of my friends.<br/><br/> - <a href="http://search.cpan.org/author/JONASBN/Games-Bingo-Bot-0.01/">Games::Bingo::Bot</a> have been updated (0.02)
 - POE::Component::IRC::Simple have been spawned (0.01)
 - <a href="http://search.cpan.org/author/SCHOP/XML-Conf-0.02/">XML::Conf</a> has been prepared for release (0.03)
 - Games::Bingo::Print separated out (0.01)
 - <a href="http://search.cpan.org/author/JONASBN/Games-Bingo-0.05/">Games::Bingo</a> cleaned up (0.06)
 
So all of these will reach CPAN shortly.<br/><br/>Some of my larger projects are showly taking shape, parts will probably see the CPAN sometime in the future.<br/><br/> - VB-POD parser (I will be using this at work)
 - Codebase (I might have to find a new name for this project)
 - YAPC Registration software (This is a very simple prototype)<br/><br/>I am also to create a prototype for my girlfriends fathers shop and my friend working at <a href="http://www.ruc.dk/">RUC</a> have asked me and our common friend to create a homepage for a project he is running.<br/><br/>The shop project until now gone quite well I have almost finished the specification and as soon as it is signed of I can start implementing the software.<br/><br/>The university project is quite simple and I have only received and outline for what it is supposed to look like, it does not seems a huge task.<br/><br/>The YAPC registration software is an idea for some component add-ons to the software we used for the registration with the <a href="http://perlworkshop.dk/">Scandinavian Perl Workshop</a>.
Hopefully <a href="http://paris.pm.org/">Paris.pm</a> will release parts of their software so we can make a common application for use by all hosts of YAPCs (and other workshops). I am thinking about doing a BOF on this in Paris.<br/><br/>So I have plenty to do - I could do with some more vacation it seems...</p>
