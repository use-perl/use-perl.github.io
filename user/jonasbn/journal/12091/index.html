<p>I remember the first time I encountered a list of known bugs I think it was in a manpage. My first thought was <i>"why don't they fix them instead of listing them?"</i>. I was younger back then and know for my own Games::Bingo project I have a BUGS file listing the currently known bugs.<br/><br/>Yesterday the BUGS file listed two bugs and I got around to fixing them encountering a third on the way, which I suspected was there, but I had difficulty narrowing down.<br/><br/>But now I know it and I can list it in my list of known bugs. I am considering writing a work-around for the bug, since it is quite difficult to solve since it is a design flaw (in my opinion for now), but making the work-around will imply that I list the bug in the BUGS file since it will still be there even though a work-around has been implemented.<br/><br/>Hmmmm... I can live with that - I guess I am getting older, more experienced and more tolerant. I still need to practice to become a better programmer and a better program designer though :)</p>
