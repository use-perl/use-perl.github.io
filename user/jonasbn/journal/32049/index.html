<p>I have not stopped running, I have just stopped writing about every step I take here in this journal.<br/><br/>I have kept a schedule of running every second day since the 23rd. of December and I feel I can continue, so...<br/><br/>I have set up a first goal of running every second day to begin with, this will go on almost to the end of January, there will be a short period until I set up my next goal, running 5 km every trip (also every second day). In the period in between I expect to run as normal, but I will have to locate a 5 km route using the routes I currently use - I am not so much for experimenting right now, since I am in the phase where I run for my life - it hurts, it is tough and not particularly fun, but it does feel good afterwards and know from previously that it will get better.<br/><br/>So when I have located my 5 km route (I have some ideas to expansion of my current 4.5 km route. I will set a new goal of running 70 km, in 14 trips over 28 days, this should bring me through february.<br/><br/>By the end of the february I should start to be able to run faster, which mean I will stay on the 5 km route, but I will set a goal of running the trip in less than 25 minutes, at Nike.com I will set this up as a pace goal, by the end of february I will have a better indication of what the pace/km should be.<br/><br/>So this is my 3 phase plan for now, since my second son will be born in the beginning of April I am not sure what my goal should be there a part from get to run at least once in a while, but I plan to keep going until summer where we are going to Bornholm, I just love to run on Bornholm the routes are magnificent, difficult and beautiful.</p>
