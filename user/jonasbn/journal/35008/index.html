<p>The other afternoon I was home alone with Sylvester, my wife was picking up our oldest son from the kindergarten. I have just rewired a few things, so my Apple AP was again connected to our stereo.<br/><br/>I could not help it so I put on some Sonic Youth, the album 'Rather Ripped', which I have not listened enough to.<br/><br/>I was carrying Sylvester around on my arm all attempts to put him down on the floor would result in crying, so we walked around the flat rocking to the guitars and drums.<br/><br/>He started to make his 'I am tired noise', which is a sort of like a humming and when it stops he either got distracted or fell asleep, but it indicates that he relaxes.<br/><br/>So we got to tune #6, 'Jams Run Free', with vocal by Kim Gordon. Apparently Sylvester's humming was in tune with the melody and at point it sounds as if Sylvester was humming along or singing along Kim Gordon.<br/><br/>In the end he fell asleep and I turned the music down. But I am very happy that Sylvester has the same taste in music as his father.<br/><br/></p>
