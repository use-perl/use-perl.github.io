<p>I was talking to Kaare one of the freelancers I am working with and we discussed work hours, I am quite busy these days and some evenings I am so tired it was hard to get off the couch and in front of the computer.<br/><br/>I normally claim that I have about 30 hours of effective programming in me per week and I am most effective in the morning, but these days I am really stretching it, I am putting in more than the 30 hours in my current contract and in the evenings and weekends I am also working on other projects.<br/><br/>One good thing is that I really, really like my job, so often getting off the couch and in front of the keyboard is hard, but the moment you start working it is ok and you can continue for several hours, even though it might not be the most effective time of day.<br/><br/>Kaare said, "Yeah, you just have to bootstrap yourself"<br/><br/>I really like that term, <i>self-bootstrapping</i> so I just had to mention it here in my journal.<br/><br/>I am considering making a schedule however where I start early with coding and then put meetings and other less demanding stuff later in the day. I normally have a crisis around 15:00, where I should probably just stop and go and pick up my son from the nursery - and then I could work some more after 20:00 where my son is put to bed.<br/><br/>Since as long as you are able to bootstrap yourself, you can also work evenings and actually get something done.<br/><br/>However I heard part of a radio show the other day, with a <i>famous</i> danish brain scientist, he claimed that often when humans face a hard to solve problem, we should acquaint ourselves with the problem and then do something else less complex. Apparently the brain is then still attempting to solve the problem in the back (of the head / &) and when we then revisit the problem it should be easier to resolve, if the solution does not present itself when doing something less complex.<br/><br/>So now I just have all the things needed to layout the plan, I just need to do it, guess I should do something simple now...</p>
