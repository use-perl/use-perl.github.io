<p>Well just to post a followup on my last journal entry. I had hoped to be able to release version 2, of my flagship product logicShop for the public by NPW 2006, it did not happen, currently I am unsure whether I will be able to be done by YAPC::Europe 2006, where I am giving an updated version of the logicShop presentation I gave at NPW 2006 on logicShop.<br/><br/>This is most annoying, but the number of contracting opportunities in Denmark currently are good and it is hard to not get things done, which mean better cashflow - I have to do something about logicShop version 2, also because it's release is required by some of my other projects, almost all of my other projects.<br/><br/>I hope I can burn some cash on some of my contracters and get some ground covered with logicShop and hopefully be able to make a public release soon.<br/><br/>The problem with a release is all of the other things I want to do,  in releation:
<ul>
<li>mailinglist</li>
<li>request tracking</li>
<li>website</li>
<li>blog</li>
<li>and a whole lot of documentation</li>
<li>and I want to clear out most of the TODOs 
</ul><br/><br/>So little time and so many projects...</p>

<h2>Saw your NPW presentation</h2>

<p>I saw your NPW presentation and was really impressed.  Don't let setbacks frustrate you<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>



<h2>Thank You</h2>

Thank you very much,<br><br>Well the first time I gave it I was quite talkative and it took 2 hours, so boiling it down to 40 minutes was quite healthy - I am sure the revision of the micro-ISV talk will have a positive effect, I am quite satisfied with the accompanying article.<br><br>jonasbn
