<p>My business is going well, so reading jobs ads is not anything I do.<br/><br/>BUT a few job offers got scoped under my nose.<br/><br/>These job descriptions list the following <i>buzzwords</i>:<br/><br/><ul>
<li>Perl</li>
<li>Catalyst</li>
<li>PostgreSQL</li>
</ul><br/><br/>And I talked to a guy who works as a freelancer for the company and he said it would not be a problem to be working on a Mac instead of a PC.<br/><br/>I must admit that I am extremely tempted to apply.<br/><br/>So why are a few job offers all of a sudden a temptation. Well I am going to be a father in April, so my time outside office hours will be limited even further. It is nice to have colleagues. I have experienced that while freelancing, where I sat in an office for two months, I really felt I was part of a team, being a social individual and a team-player, I found this very stimulating. And sometimes it would be nice to not wear so many hats as you have being self-employed and just working 9 to 5 would nice for a change.<br/><br/>Having a success being self-employed most mean you are working alot of hours and lately I have been burning the midnight-oil.<br/><br/>Well temptations are just distraction, so I just have to ignore them</p>

I have the 9 to 5 and sometimes think it would be nice to go "solo". I don't work with a team doing Perl though. I am it. So learning Perl is an uphill for me right now.<br><br>I tried to do some side work using TT2 but they were using it in such a radically different way than I was at work that it was hard to get up to speed (and the project was on a fast track so "learning" was even harder). I eventually bailed. I read the jobs sight but I don't go for anything.
