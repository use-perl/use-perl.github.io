<p>I woke up early, that is something I have become quite good at after I became a father. Or well it is probably the other way around I have become really bad at sleeping late.<br/><br/>After a shower and some breakfast, my wife and I went over the telecommunication situation. The had had no coverage since arriving in Sweden. So I called the customer service on a special number listed on the telco website for customers being abroad. I got to talk to a employee quite fast, which was nice taken into consideration I was abroad. I told her of our problem and she informed us that <i>roaming</i> was not enabled on the subscription, just as I figured. She would enable <i>roaming</i>, but it would not become active while we were in Stockholm/Sweden, hmrmf.<br/><br/>Anyway I took the simcard out of my iPhone and stuck it in her Nokia and everybody was happy, I put <code>tagg's</code> phone number in her phone book so she could reach me if needed.<br/><br/>Then I was off to the NPW - this was quite early and the streets where quite empty, but I did meet a craftsman on his way to work wearing a 'Bevar Christiania' (Preserve Christiania) hooded sweatshirt. Which I found quite amusing considering we were in the middle of Stockholm.<br/><br/>I made it to the venue timely on foot only to meet all of my fellow Copenhagen Perl Mongers and a few swedes standing outside the venue. It was fun to meet old friends and the weather was really nice.<br/><br/>After waiting for a while the organizers showed up, we got it and things got organized, I helped by setting up the coffee table and brewing coffee. I do not mind these things, I actually find these things quite amusing, it sort of takes the formality out of everything - and after all it is just a workshop, not a conference and it is grassroots and not professional.<br/><br/>So the scheduled talks started - one track only so you would not miss a thing. There was no wifi so people where not distracted by IRC, Eve Online and other time consuming activities, which I think was quite nice, it did however have one problem that you also lacked access to resources like Wikipedia during the talks (I do not know everything and some times it is nice to look things up on the fly), minicpan can handy for checking out modules on the fly however.<br/><br/>Jonathan Worthingtons talk on the Perl6 language was truly inspiring and it seems as if we have come a long way, yes there is a long way to go, but stuff is getting done and things seem like they are under control.<br/><br/>My own talk was crap, I talk way too fast, I have to practice presenting stuff more.<br/><br/>After the workshop I met up with my wife and we went walking in Stockholm, I crashed after having watched 'Atonement' at the hotel.</p>
