<p>I wrote <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/jonasbn/journal/36077">my journal entry</a> on the QA Hackathon Sunday before leaving for Copenhagen, so I did not really get to describe my traveling home.<br/><br/>I went from Linpro taking the subway to the central station. On the central station I went directly to the platform and the train arrived after two minutes.<br/><br/>When I got to the airport I gathered it would be the best idea if I could just get through security and then I could eat/drink/hack etc. So I appended my self to the line leading to the check-in counter.<br/><br/>When I got to the counter I just gave the lady there my ticket and my danish health insurance card. I had my passport in hand, expecting that I would need both (as in Copenhagen airport).<br/><br/>She just looked at the health insurance card and commented something like (translated from Norwegian).<br/><br/><cite> Funny you can use in Denmark considering they do not hold a picture </cite><br/><br/>I responded (translated from Danish)<br/><br/><cite> Yes, it is </cite><br/><br/>She concluded our business with the following remark (translated from Norwegian)<br/><br/><cite> Have a pleasant flight </cite><br/><br/>After this I went to the security check line, where I had to take out my laptop, take of my belt, shoes and jacket.<br/><br/>I should not present anything, I expected the hardest thing was over and I went to the flight information board. My flight was listed as <i>boarding...</i>, so I immediately headed towards the gate, so no eat/drink/hack for me.<br/><br/>I came to the gate presented my boarding pass and expired passport and I was let on board.<br/><br/>After an hours flight in a much more comfortable seat than the last time, where I was able to eat/drink/hack. I landed in Copenhagen airport, picked up some LEGOs for my sons and went through customs with nothing to declare, went on the subway and got home.<br/><br/>I only regret the loosing of a bootle of iKlean, which was confiscated in Copenhagen airport security check, since I had put in the wrong back.<br/><br/>I could have offered laptop cleaning at the QA hackathon in Oslo, well I must do that the next time.<br/><br/>So now I just need to renew my passport and get a new bottle of iKlean.
