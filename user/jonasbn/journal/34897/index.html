<div class="span8">
<p>logicLAB have placed their first <a href="http://jobs.perl.org/job/7215">job ad</a> on <url:http://jobs.perl.org>.<br/><br/>I have received several applications and some very nice resumes, but none of the applicants are based in Denmark.<br/><br/>So I have responded to all the telecommuters that I will keep their resumes, but I am looking for people capable of being on location.<br/><br/>I specified that there are some <i>on site</i> requirements. I actually do not care whether people show up everyday, as long as you get some exposure and you attend the agreed meeting and get the job done, but telecommuters does not quite fill that hole. If you consider writing a job ad for posting on <url:http://jobs.perl.org>, be aware what you specify when it comes to <i>on site </i> requirements.<br/><br/>Another group of applications is the people applying from abroad, which are willing to relocate to your country, in my case Denmark.<br/><br/>Unfortunately this is not relevant and the election last night did not change this. Getting people from abroad to work in Denmark is practically impossible and I do not have the resources to arrange this.<br/><br/>Currently I am examining alternative solutions and contacting some of all the Perl programmers I know. But it does not look particularly promising.<br/><br/>One plan is to start a company in Sweden, Sweden does seem to embrace foreigners in a more liberal manner than here in Denmark - but even that is resource demanding and I do not have too much time as it looks right now, which is the reason why I am hiring.</p>

<h2>Foreign applicants</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/tirwhan/">tirwhan</a> on 2007-11-14T12:44:40</h3>
<p>I'd just like to point out that if your foreign applicants are citizens of a country in the European Union there is practically nothing Danish laws (or indeed your company) can do which would prevent them from moving to Denmark and applying for a job the same way a Dane would. The free movement of persons withing the EU is one of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Freedoms_(European_Union)" title="wikipedia.org">four essential freedoms</a wikipedia.org> that lie at the basis of EU law after all, and significant barriers of other kinds have been broken down (such as the ban on importing pets into the UK and the limitation of number of foreigners in league football teams<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-) because of it.
</p><p>You were probably aware of that and were talking about applicants from outside the EU, so feel free to disregard my post.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: I am not Danish so have no direct knowledge what kind of shenanigans Danish law plays (and politicians continue to surprise me), nor am I looking for a job (I'm a happy little telecommuter and it'd take some major event for me to go back to traveling to work in my own city, let alone another country). I will however say that for those who haven't done it yet I heartily recommend taking a job in a different country. Even if you end up going back after a short period of time it'll leave you with an experience of a different culture which will improve you as a person, if nothing else.</p>



<h2>Telecommute only search</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/stu42j/">stu42j</a> on 2007-11-14T16:22:00</h3>
I just noticed that your job posting shows up when searching with the "Telecommute only" option.  This may be part of the confusion.  It seems to me that the "Telecommute only" option should only include "Onsite: none" postings.<br><br>On the other hand, job seekers often act a bit like spammers.  Sending their resume to as many people as possible, hoping that one will bite.  They often don't pay a lot of attention to the details and requirements.  (I've probably been guilty of this myself at times.)

I have mailed Ask about this issue, according to the definition.<br><br><cite>A job with no onsite requirement is assumed to be a telecommuting position</cite><br><br>My job posting should not appear in the telecommmuters section, since <b>some</b> on site presence is required.<br><br>I have not heard anything yet.
