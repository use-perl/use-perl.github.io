<p>Now I sit down for updating my journal, at this time I have been awake about 28 hours, and I'm entering my third crisis.<br/><br/>Having been working hard all night building environments for test etc. (The stuff I talked about in my last journal entry). Well by now I have so much knowledge on the process so I can automate it. Of course I wished yesterday that I had allready done this for everything, but only 25% percent of the proces is automated by now.<br/><br/>But anyway during the night I had a phantastic opportunity to sit back and talk to my friend Rias who is living in the states, and when he left the Copenhagen Perl Monger, channel (#cph.pm), I skipped over to see what was going on in #perl.<br/><br/>Here I met a guy who lives in Canada, whom I met at the TPC5 in San Diego. I wish I could have gone this year, but my finicial situation was not really geared for this kind of venture anyway I am going to YAPC::Europe next month and I am looking forward.<br/><br/>In the Perl channel - a guy (I cannot remember his name) posted an URL to some pictures from YAPC in the states, and one of the pictures really caught my attention (<a href="http://mengwong.com/photography/20020730-a/013.html">http://mengwong.com/photography/20020730-a/013.html</a>).<br/><br/>In this picture I see a lot of faces of people I have met or seen at TPC5, and I hope to see some of them in YAPC::E, because building this human network is really useful when working all night and all you local friends have gone to bed... <br/><br/>Well anyway that what I wanted to say, it is nice to have friends accessible 24-7, no matter where there are on the globe. <br/><br/>Well I hope I can sneak from work soon and home to my bed.</p>
