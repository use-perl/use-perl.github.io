<p>On may the 19th. of May I decided to participate in Copenhagen Marathon. This years Copenhagen Marathon was the 20th. of May, so I decided for 2008.<br/><br/>My running has started to pick up again and as it looks right now, I will be reaching my goal of 80 km. in 4 weeks this month. So I will aim for 90 next month.<br/><br/>I have started to loose weight and my weight decreases nicely. This was my primary goal and it feels good to do something physical when not in front of the computer. <br/><br/>My pace has become faster, but that is secondary.  Running farther is my primary goal, currently I am have several routes to pick from, so I can choose between routes of various lengths. 5, 6, 7 and 10 km. and probably longer, but 10 km seems to be my max currently.<br/><br/>For now I am slowly increasing the lengths of my runs. After summer I expect to start working towards the marathon for now I am just running to loose weight and preparing for the preparation :)<br/><br/>I made some reconnaissance trips on Bornholm where I will be for some weeks this summer so I have a 4 and a 7 km route laid out - and it is possible to locate a longer trip when there. I however expect to run everyday when there instead of longer trips. So when I return from Bornholm, fit for fight, I should be ready to lay out a plan for marathon preparation.<br/><br/>btw. I got a mail from my friend Alexander Klink, who is working on an <a href="http://kratosorange.sourceforge.net/">open source alternative</a> to Nike's Nike+ site based on Jifty, I expect to write more on this later.

Does <a href="http://earth.google.com/" title="google.com">Google Earth</a google.com> have a map available for Bornholm? I've used its 'Ruler' feature to plan out running paths around my house. It seems to work fairly well, and I don't need to go around checking the distance w/my car.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

Indeed <a href="http://usr.bin.dk/user/jonasbn/stuff/Bornholm.kmz" title="usr.bin.dk">it is</a usr.bin.dk>, but I normally do some reconnaissance runs with my iPod and use this to measure my trips. You can always set a distance and then, go back when the iPod informs you, that you have reached your half-way point.<br><br>jonasbn
