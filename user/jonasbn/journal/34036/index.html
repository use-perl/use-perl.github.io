<p>I read an article on the O'Reilly site entitled 'Perl is Dead. Long live Perl.'<br/><br/>The article was <i>okay</i>, I read it as an account on the development of Perl, with focus on Perl5 and Perl6 - the article however did get move into a minefield and this became really clear when I got to the comments. I was not surprised, of course the article had sparked a whole lot of responses of differing opinions and I was a saddened by many of the negative comments.<br/><br/>Often it seems as if we will never get out of this tar-pit of comparing editors, languages and the position of curly braces. A lot of energy seem to be wasted on discussing these things over and over again.<br/><br/>It is weird that people cannot embrace the diversity offered via the Internet.<br/><br/>This week I also listened to <a href="http://perlcast.com/2007/07/26/ross-turk-of-sourceforgenet/">the Perlcast interview</a> with Ross Turk from SourceForge. <br/><br/>He was asked about Google Code and whether Sourceforge regarded Google as a competitor, he answered no. His reasons for doing so are unclear to me. I have always meant that a little competition was good - I did however interpret his actual response and I think Ross might be of the same opinion.<br/><br/>I also saw <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1ynTV_E-5s">the lightning talks from OSCON 2007 with Andy Lester</a>, he spoke highly of Google Code and not so highly of Sourceforge :)<br/><br/>I think people are entitled to an opinion on topics for which they care and on which they have knowledge and/or experience.<br/><br/>I just think it is important to be constructive in  your criticism. The article was a good piece and it did not deserve the general negative response it got, even though one might argue that it asked for it :)<br/><br/>I am still a Sourceforge user, but I am considering using Google Code for one of my future projects. So I can see fo myself and I can make up my own opinion on Google Code and Sourceforge.<br/><br/>I am still coding Perl5 and I am not really following the Perl6 development actively, but I am interested in the future of Perl. I would love to learn more languages like Python and Ruby, but I simply cannot find the time to do so.<br/><br/>But I am happy that Perl6 is happening, Ruby happened and Google Code happened. So that Python, Perl 5 and Sourceforge have something to compete against so improvements can be made and things can evolve.<br/><br/>Diversity is in general what we got and we have differing opinions and all this is good and to quote a wise man who once developed a programming language "Be nice".
 
So I say long live diversity and death to uniformity and lets move on...</p>
