<p>Finally could I get around to making this release, the changes are plenty, many more than I would I like myself.<br/><br/>I will try to keep to release early and often from now on.<br/><br/>CHANGES:<br/><br/>- Added Acknowledgement section to the Games::Bingo POD
- Cleaned up some POD
- Started implementing the new Games::Bingo::Card class aswell as the different games (1, 2 and full card).
- Merged Games::Bingo::Card and Games::Bingo::Print::Card obsoleting the latter, this also means migrating the test files related to Games::Bingo::Print::Card to Games::Bingo
- Removed _generate from Games::Bingo::Card
- Added Games::Bingo::Constants, introducing these constants:
	NUMBER_OF_NUMBERS == 90
	NUMBER_OF_NUMBERS_IN_ROW == 4
	NUMBER_OF_ROWS_IN_CARD == 3
	NUMBER_OF_COLUMNS_IN_CARD == 9
	NUMBER_OF_NUMBERS_IN_CARD == 
		NUMBER_OF_NUMBERS_IN_ROW * NUMBER_OF_ROWS_IN_CARD<br/><br/>- Added a b/ directory containing *.t files, which demonstrate the errors found in 0.08
- Added b/bless.t, which is aimed at the bless bug
- Added b/short.t which is aimed at the number shortage bug
- Added b/sort.t which is aimed at the number sorting bug 
- Renamed get_number to get_highest_number in G::B::Column
- Changed get_higest_number so it actually does what the POD says
- Fixed the bless bug (SEE BUGS), added the new _flush method so the bless method is not called anymore
- Fixed the short bug (SEE BUGS), the new _flush method also fixed this problem
- Fixed bug in card generation code, where the picked numbers was put in the wrong collections
- Fixed sort bug (SEE BUGS), now the generated card is properly sorted
- Started cleaning up some of the tests, the many changes in the upcoming release 0.09 have had great impact on the test suite 
- Removed set_status method from G::B::Column, it is no longer used
- Fixed a bug in the pulled method in Games::Bingo</p>
