<p>I have by mistake made a namespace screwup by releasing DateTime::Pregnancy. I was kindly invited to join the <a href="http://datetime.perl.org/">DateTime</a> mailinglist by Dave Rolsky, so I did.<br/><br/>Here we had a discussion on the use of the DateTime namespace and I understood that I had made a mess. So I decided to pull the module from CPAN.<br/><br/>I will problably relaunch it in its current form under the name of Date::Pregnancy and I will then redesign aspects of the module to accomodate to the DateTime module requirements and I will mail these suggestions to the mailinglist before releasing anything the CPAN.<br/><br/>I understand the idea of what the hardworking people contributing to the DateTime::* namespace are attempting to do (look at my own efforts in Date::Holidays::*), so I will attempt to accomodate to this and will only release modules to the namespace after general acceptance by the people on the DateTime mailinglist.<br/><br/>To the <B>DateTime Lords</B>, thanks for your constructive reponses and now it is back to the drawing board</p>

The Date::Time issue apart, this is a nice idea.
<p>
I remember that during my wife's first pregnancy I wrote a script to tell me what week she was in.

It is the type of thing that I haven't had time to write at any time since then.<nobr> <wbr></nobr><tt>:-)</tt>

Good work.

Just out of curiosity, can you remember, which method your script was based on?<br> <br>jonasbn

Hmm... I don't know about what's the habit where you live, but here it's customary to start counting from the start of the last period. So that's well 2 weeks or so, before the actual pregnancy.
<p>No, <a href="http://www.birthingnaturally.net/pregnant/issues/duedate.html" title="birthingnaturally.net">it's not just here</a birthingnaturally.net>.</p>

Hello,<br> <br>We use the same calculation methods as described on the page you refer to.<br> <br>I have created some tests validating the numbers of my calculations against the numbers we got from our own doctor (in the case of my girlfriend's pregnancy) and these are a match (I am currently trying to obtain more test data).<br> <br>But I do not understand what you are referring to since the methods I use all are based on the first date of the last period (that is common for the 3 methods I have knowledge of), they are not based on a conception date.<br> <br>I have not implemented a calculate_conception_date even though I could possibly estimate it as well as I attempt to estimate the birthdate.<br> <br>Do I understand your post correctly, that there might be problem with the calculation of week and month number, which could be of by 2 weeks, is that what you are referring to?
