<p>After our meeting yesterday in Copenhagen Perl Mongers, I wrote a brief letter to the list about the things we agreed on should happen this year, apart from those I added a few things myself.<br/><br/><li>Code-a-thon
We are going to have a Code-a-thon more, we have much work todo, and we can easily be more ambitious. I also have several projects in the pipeline, which are kind of stuck or simply haven't started due to the number of hobby projects.<br/><br/><li>YAPC::Europe 2003
We are definately going again. It was great fun and I am considering submitting a paper myself.<br/><br/><li>T-shirts
People want new t-shirts (even though I still haven't gotten rid of the last ones), I am not going to involve myself economically the next time I think. But new t-shirts would be cool.<br/><br/><li>LF2003
We are participating at the <a href="http://www.linuxforum.dk/">LinuxForum</a> this year with a simple booth. We don't know exactly to do with the booth, but I aim at selling the remaining t-shirts. Apart from that we should make a flyer or something, which briefly presents Perl and Copenhagen Perl Mongers, I need to make a draft for this.<br/><br/><li>YAPC::Europe
After the last YAPC::Europe we talked about hosting the conference sometime in the future, maybe together with fellow scandinavian monger groups, but we might need to practice a bit, which brings me to the next thing.<br/><br/><li>Perl::Weekend
I talked to some swedes at #perl, I am thinking about inviting them to Copenhagen for a Perl weekend. I am thinking about contacting several of our other user groups in Copenhagen since they have experience and contacts to pull such a thing through. They are heavily involved in the LinuxForum mentioned earlier.<br/><br/>I will probably get back to many of these things in this journal over the next year.
