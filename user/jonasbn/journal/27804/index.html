<p>I was doing support on a large Unix platform left by Orange in Denmark (Orange Denmark was bought by Telia at some point).<br/><br/>Due to the nature of a RT3 installation on a no-longer-orange machine, I had to move the RT3 database to a new host.<br/><br/>I was provided with an AIX machine, which came from a cluster solution of sorts - it had practially no HDD space and due to time constraints I gave up, intending to revisit the task later on.<br/><br/>So I made a RT3 installtion on one of my own Intel boxes, running FreeBSD - it took no time and everybody were happy.<br/><br/>Over the summer I was sacrisfied due to some project/management black magic, so I want to meeting with the project manager located in Copenhagen, the consulting company running the gig and the consultant - which was to take my place (only a bit awkward) - but anyways I agreed to handover to the new (poor) guy and my machine would be delivered within a week.<br/><br/>Time passed... and I attemted to get things moving without luck.<br/><br/>So finally a break through when the consultancy company offered to buy my machine - so I mailed them a price, but things went silent again.<br/><br/>So now I am in a situation where I just want to go and get my machine, so just out of respect I mailed the UK project manager (a nice guy) today and told informed him of the situation.<br/><br/>I guess I have to make a decision on this shortly.</p>
