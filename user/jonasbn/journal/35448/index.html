<p>Another problem I have been working on for some days now is a good old UTF-8 problem. Perhaps it is just me, but I am simply being haunted by UTF-8 problems. UTF-8 seems so simple, but it can really be a pain.<br/><br/>I was given a web form application, quite simple, which utilize a simple framework which have been developed for this. This time however the application talks to an external back-end via XML over HTTP instead of sending mails or sticking stuff in a database.<br/><br/>So the form collects some simple data, a name among other things. This name does of course reflect normal danish names, so special characters are involved. So I was asked to encode the data as UTF-8 since this did not seem to be the case.<br/><br/>I have attempted at several different approaches without luck. I wrote up some tests. These tests do however pass nicely with UTF-8 working properly, but they are running outside the mod_perl environment, which so nicely demonstrate the problem.<br/><br/>So testing stuff with unit-tests would not have pointed to the problem, but when developing the stuff the application should have been tested with some proper data. So instead of strings like: 'hest', 'test', 'fest' - 'k&oslash;dp&aring;l&aelig;g', 'masse&oslash;del&aelig;ggelsesv&aring;ben' and '&aelig;blegr&oslash;d' should be test data candidates. Way to often we end up with these problems too late in the projects.<br/><br/>So tomorrow it is back to the drawing board. Where I have to find out how to eliminate XML::Simple from eating my XML when it encounters UTF-8 encoded strings.<br/><br/>So my chapter in the developers handbook should also contains something on test data.<br/><br/>My problem really is that it would be great if the tests could be run under mod_perl, so I could demonstrate the bug and test in the proper environment as I wrote in part 1.</p>
