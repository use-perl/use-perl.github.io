<p>Krak has a nice routeplanner online for danish streets and cities. It works as a charm. My sister called me the other day and asked me to print out two routes, since she was going to a wedding in the countryside.<br/><br/>I entered the address info for the two sites in two separate tabs in my browser and got two neat routeplans.<br/><br/>Then the fun begun...<br/><br/>I plugged in my Canon IP90, which I bought for keeping at home for these situations printing when you just need something fast or when working from home.<br/><br/>I put in a single sheet of paper and clicked the print button, request a more printer friendly version of the first route.<br/><br/>I print the pages starting from the last page, unfortunately the print job was two pages.<br/><br/>Ok, out came a page containing ONLY an ad - I had seen the ad on the page with the query result, but I had not noted it on the printer friendly page.<br/><br/>I suspended the job when the printer complained and inserted a blank sheet of paper.<br/><br/>I got the last page again.<br/><br/>My anger towards the lonely ad, was increasing.<br/><br/>After several tries (4-5 sheets containing only the ad)<br/><br/>I succeeded.<br/><br/>I am unsure whether it is Apple, Canon or Krak who is screwing up and my suggestion is that websites should have a environmental friendly version so the paper use is kept to an absolute minimum.<br/><br/>Not having to print would of course be the nicest, but it not always an option.<br/><br/>Anyway, I got the printed routes handed to my sister, discarding the many ads and left her to spin the countryside burning some gas.<br/><br/>Well the environment seems to loose in all scenarios and the ad seems so pointless when printing.</p>
