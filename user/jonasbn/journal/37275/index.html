<p>I reflected over a conversation I have ever so often with my oldest kid, since it resembled something I picked up when reading about GUI dialog design.<br/><br/>The conversation normally takes place at the dinner table.<br/><br/>Me: <cite>Do you want more dinner?</cite><br/><br/>Villads: <cite>No</cite><br/><br/>Me: <cite>Are you sure?</cite><br/><br/>Villads: <i>silence</i><br/><br/>Villads silence has many reasons, it can be that he has started to play LEGOs or watch TV.<br/><br/>If I continue inquiring he will most likely respond: <cite>No</cite><br/><br/>Which is of course not what he means, but it is the easy response.<br/><br/>So I need to practice dialogue with him to I can give him a proper chance to respond correctly to my questions.<br/><br/>Same pattern is important for graphical GUIs where I sometimes find myself confused about a certain dialogue, where positive and negative answers are required to complete a certain action. You often click the wrong button because of this.<br/><br/>So I do not blame Villads for giving misleading answers - I blame myself for confusing him.</p>

<p>The trendier thing to do would be not to ask at all and <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/neveruseawarning" title="alistapart.com">provide an "undo" option</a alistapart.com>.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

<p>Once in a while I put the plate in the kitchen in case of hunger, but eating habits is not really the issue, it is, but that is a different story. Anyway the dialogue is the problem and I need to be approach Villads differently in order to carry out proper conversations with him, instead of capturing him with weird adult non-sense, the situation simply reminded me of user experiences from GUIs.</p>

<p>A random book recommend, <i>How to talk so kids will listen, and listen so kids will talk</i>.  I have to say from personal experience that the advice really works.</p>

<p>like most uis, maybe he could benefit from less distractions (eg not allow legos or tv at the dinner table.)</p>

<p>That is one good solution. Focus on so many other activities around dinner, like the younger brother, cooking and setting the table - means that we often forget to turn off the TV and completely remove the LEGOs, which are then just simply moved to the end of the table.</p>
