<p>I am at my office today for the first time in a long time. A huge pile of letters was on my desk when I entered, so I started by processing that.<br/><br/>Then finally I got to the boxes. I had received a new cable for my Sennheiser headphones, where the left earphone sometimes fall out - this is the second cable I buy, but at least I can still get parts - and I guess they croak when you run over them with your office chair all the time.<br/><br/>The second box was a Matrox DualHead2Go digital adaptor, this lets me connect an additional monitor to my Powerbook, so I can have 3 displays, the one on the laptop included.<br/><br/>So I rearranged the desks in my Office so I could sit with a Sony Trinitron 420 GS monitor on each side of the laptop and I started unpacking and plugging in the cables.<br/><br/>I have an Apple Cinema display on location with one of my clients, so these Sony monitors are used at the office when I need to configure a machine or add an additional display to my MacBook Pro. Anyway I had ordered the digital version instead of the analog version since it is my plan to get an additional Apple cinema display and these use DVI - but I just could not wait.<br/><br/>So I started to plug everything in, but I could not get everything connect. Since my Sony monitors have VGA connectors, it would be better with the Matrox DualHead2Go analog edition. I had two VGA-DVI adapters, one is always in my back and the other one was luckily in my office. So I could connect one of the Sony's and the Matrox to by laptop, unfortunately I lack one DVI-VGA adapter to get the last Sony monitor connected, so I am still only running with two displays.<br/><br/>Anyway I can see in the preferences that I can choose a display resolution of 3840*1200, so now I am really thinking about getting a VGA-DVI adapter more so I can get this mega screen up and running just for the fun of it :)</p>
