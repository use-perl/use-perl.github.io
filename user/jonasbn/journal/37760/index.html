<p>I have been doing a lot of small projects lately so I have decided to do some evaluations of these here, this is the first. I have evaluated projects here before, but I think I am going to do this on a more regular basis.<br/><br/>The first project has been given the title: packages.<br/><br/><ul>
<li>- lack of focus, too much on the table</li>
<li>- bad or lacking requirements, too much interpretation of assignment</li>
<li>+ new super class</li>
<li>+ good additions to existing class</li>
<li>- project frozen/terminated due to technical issues in the back end (it would never work), project might however be revisited later. As written earlier other things could have been worked on instead, if this has been known from the start</li>
<li>+ introduction to Test::Class</li>
<li>- ancient XSLT engine on platform, parts of the implemented XSLT could be done more nicely with a more contemporary tool</li>
<li>- assignment procedure, the assignment should never have been initiated</li>
</ul><br/><br/>Update: Evaluating this entry made me think - I should write some more about the contents of the project to put it in perspective, so here goes...<br/><br/>Packages was a small web application implemented in a proprietary frameword used with one of my clients. The concept in the application was to give the user the ability to add and remove certain services to his/her mobile subscription.<br/><br/>The backend did do parts of the stuff, but not all the business logic related to make this work for the customers. We could implement the business logic in the frontend but decided it was a bad idea and we would much rather await another project which would address this.</p>
