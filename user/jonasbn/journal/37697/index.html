<p>Ever since I encountered my first Unix hosts (Ask and Embla) at the University of Copenhagen and I learned about the concept of host names I have always put effort into naming my hosts with good poetic and in my opinion cool names. I recall Rosenkrantz being my first private Linux server, I cannot remember what my first Linux workstation was called - perhaps I should dig into this. Later I have had Golem and Shelob running as FreeBSD servers on an intranet. My public server Leela suffered a disc crash, the other day (more on this in another journal entry) many hosts and many good names from many different resources.<br/><br/>Back when I was working at DTV I was once travelling with the train when I heard two guys about my own age discussing the naming policy of the servers at their place of work, I think they might have been students at DTU. The naming policy was the known planets, but one of them wondered why they had a machine named LV-426. They simply could not figure what it was and whether it was a moon or something - I remember smiling to myself, because I knew what LV-426 was.<br/><br/>Anyway for a long time used the name Hyperstation, taken from a song by Sonic Youth. I gave new host names to the machine I no longer used. Picking names from a accumulated list of good names taken from novels, movies and diverse other places.<br/><br/>But after changing to a 17" inch Mac Book Pro. I gathered it was time for a host name change also because Hyperstation is still in use, being a fairly new machine.<br/><br/>So I looked at my Sonic Youth song collection and <b>hoarfrost</b> stood out, so my new workstation has been named Hoarfrost.

<h2>hostnames at my work</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/arkturuz/">arkturuz</a> on 2008-10-20T15:14:03</h3>
At my work someone "clever" (read: windows admin with free time) got the idea to name all hosts according to the following scheme: company name (two letters), department name (two letters), workplace name (two letters) and the computer serial number (two digits). Sometimes it's just easier to remember raw IP addresses, instead of that mess.
