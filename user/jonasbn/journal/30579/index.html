<p>I gave my micro-ISV presentation, planned for YAPC::Europe to the Copenhagen Perl Mongers yesterday. After having worked on it all day, I kind of felt burnt out, the presentation was bad - bad, bad, bad.<br/><br/>I am really dissappointed with my own presentation and the presentaion and I hope I can get it fixed so I can deliver it with a bit more authority (pondus would be the danish word in lack of a direct translation).<br/><br/>I got some good feedback however, so things are not all bad.<br/><br/>At the same time I am really disappointed with my own performance at work... I am behind schdule on most things, I cannot seem to close anything at all, I have hired two freelance contracters to take the load of me and get somebody to discuss with. I was able however to write up the initial revision of a specification of a sub-system for one of the projects, which I have sent to a freelance contracter in India who have delivered good stuff to me before.<br/><br/>But still I am behind with everything and I do not exactly feel on top of things. I am afraid that some of all these projects will backfire so my planning will go totally down the drain.<br/><br/>Currently I am focussing on the delegation part of the whole mess, then I have to see if I can get some of the smaller things out of the way before all of the 3 contracters get back to me for more work and with more work.<br/><br/>Things on the home front are marvellous, Villads is back at the nursery, making a scene every morning, but when you pick him up later he is in a good mood and it makes up for my bad mood to hear him chatter away and laugh.<br/><br/>I turned down an opportunity to be test coordinator for a month with one of my clients, something I had hoped I had the time to do, but I have to be able to see the light at the end of the tunnel, if I am going to get over this.<br/><br/>Hopefully other similar opprtunities will arise
