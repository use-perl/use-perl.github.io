<p>Some of the things I added to the TODO when taking over this project was:
<ul>
<li>Write more POD, including a tutorial
<li>Write more tests (we need better coverage)
</ul>
I have with the latest releases applied some of the minor patches and fixed some of the easy bugs at the same time attempted to add tests to visualize the problems and give me an indication of when I had a working fix.<br/><br/>This added to the overall coverage and to the POD coverage aswell, but now awaits a few bigger things - and before jumping into these I would like to have better test coverage for the sake of regression test, I do not want to break anything, or at least not be able to find out what I broke.<br/><br/>So currently the POD coverage looks like the following (according to pod_cover):
<code>
Summary:
 sub routines total    : 135
 sub routines covered  : 75
 sub routines uncovered: 60
 total coverage        : 55.55%<br/><br/>hyperstation ~/develop/cvs-logicLAB/modules/workflow
</code><br/><br/>When the POD is covered I also expect to have a better understanding of larger parts of the code and I will be able to write the unit-tests to get the overall coverage up to an acceptable level, where it will be useful prior to addressing the major issues:
<ul>
<li>Workflow::Factory inheritance (currently not working)
<li>Dynamic configuration loading/changing
</ul><br/><br/>I myself have added the following things to the TODO list:
<ul>
<li>Change POD format to comply with Pod::Coverage (this is practically done, hence the report above
<li>Add better handling of missing filename parameter in Workflow::Config::Perl
<li>Add support for string based configuration a la XML::Simple
<li>There are a few other minor things, please see the TODO file in the latest dist.
</ul><br/><br/>The Workflow module is quite marvellous and I am learning a lot as I go along - it is sad Chris Winters do not have the time to continue his work, but then again I have a great opportunity to get my hands on somebody else's code and Workflow is big, but still very self-contained, just the kind of task I like.<br/><br/>Workflow seems to have a small but very active community and I plan to strengthen this a bit, possibly with the following initiatives:
<ul>
<li>Mailinglist
<li>Website with HTML documentation and more graphical content
</ul><br/><br/>Suggestions for other things are most welcome.</p>
