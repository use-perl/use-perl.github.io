<p>The SOAP task/sub-project I have been involved in all of a sudden became <i>high-profile</i>. This would mean that everybody in the organization knows what it is about.<br/><br/>This also meant that the project I had been informed was low-priority all of a sudden, should finish in practically no time, with status mails and status meetings all the time.<br/><br/>Well I can handle that I have tried it before, but it kind of screwed up my planning, since I run several projects in parallel for different clients.<br/><br/>So I wrote the other client and informed him that I was finishing off this <i>high-profile</i> project and after this focus would be on his project.<br/><br/>I received a mail later on from the client, asking why his project was not <i>high-profile</i>.<br/><br/>I am still pondering on how to explain him, that <i>high-profile</i> is not the same as high-priority and that I as a developer do not regard <i>high-profile</i> as a good thing.<br/><br/><i>High-profiling</i> tends to involve a lot of people whom are not associated with the project directly and but still have an opinion about it, they do not know technical details and/or the history.<br/><br/>These people are often not technicians, technicians are often very good at recognizing <i>high-profile</i> projects and do not want to be involved in them, they will help you out, they will come with advice - but you can always tell that they think: <i>"Thank god, it is not my project"</i>.<br/><br/>I guess I will have to explain the above thing to my client next week when we meet - leaving out the other people part.</p>

<p>Just say high-profile projects are mainly about politics because they involve too many people. Even manager types should immediately grasp what you are talking about and what your role is; they will just see it from their side and will not be aware of the way it looks from yours.</p>

The fact is that I am really disappointed of the project management in this case, the project manager is a nice guy, but the project had very limited chance of success given the provided resources, I am not thinking about people, but machinery, environments etc. - so too much was promised to the partner expecting the SOAP interface.<br><br>The only good thing is that I have not been held accountable for my unsuccessful attempt to solve the task at hand.<br><br>The integration towards the partner has been stalled and I am currently regrouping and I have been given the task of preparing the platform for the SOAP web services, meaning we are finally doing things buttom up, since the existing frame-work and was not able to support SOAP.
