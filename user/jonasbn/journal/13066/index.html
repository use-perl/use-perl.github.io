<p>I have been fighting all day with SOAP and VB.NET. I have read a lot of MSDN articles, without any luck, all in all I cannot get the web services to do as I want - and at the same time the tasks are pilling up and we are very busy.<br/><br/>It is fun to sit and play with the web services stuff, but I would like less stress and a few succesful experiences :-/<br/><br/>But know I am home to the REAL succes of the day, Games::Bingo::Bot is finished in the first version. Perl rocks. I had implemented the bot as a simple script containing all I needed, but I wanted to move the Games::Bingo related stuff into a separate module (class). So I started by moving it earlier this week, then I refactored the module to be a class and then everything stopped working :)<br/><br/>I had implemented the commands as normal subs and in order to keep everything neat I kept a list of references to these. I had never used code references in conjunction with OOP, but I implemented the same list of commands as an attribute in the Games::Bingo::Bot class and then I could still resolve the subs, which implement commands without mixing these up with the other subs (the constructor etc.)
But I could not get it to work, then it struck me, one of the old failures I used to make many years ago, was that I always forgot that the first parameter to a method was the object itself, so I ended up with this neat piece of code:<br/><br/><code>
if (my $sub = $gbb->{'commands'}->{$msg}) {
    my ($type, $answer) = &$sub($gbb, $nick);
</code><br/><br/>and it works perfectly.<br/><br/>So I wrote a bit of docs and I wanted to create the distribution of the Games::Bingo::Bot code. Then I found out I have really made a mess of the CVS file structure.<br/><br/>In order to have the namespace easily browsable the structure looks like this:<br/><br/><tt>
games dir
    bingo dir
         games-bingo source
         bot dir
               games-bingo-bot source
         print dir
               games-bingo-print source<br/><br/>aso
</tt><br/><br/>This mean that the Makefiles trigger each other and everything is somewhat entangles, if the makefile could just keep to what is in the MANIFEST file, but apparently not.<br/><br/>Another annoying thing I have been fighting before is, after changing to UFS from HPFS+ I have all these annoying ._<filename> files all of the filesystem and they interfere with the building proces...<br/><br/>ARGH!<br/><br/>This day has both been very good and really crappy... and tomorrow will probably be the same.</p>

So, when will a bingo bot show up in #perl?  And what will it be called?

Well it is called bingobot<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br> <br>it currently wants to run in a channel called #bingo, but that can be changed, later more easily when I get some configuration file going...<br> <br>Check CPAN, Games::Bingo::Bot, it should be indexed shortly.
