<div class="span8">
<p>I attended LinuxForum 2007 in Copenhagen both Friday and Saturday, heard a few talks, but no talks really rocked my boat. Was introduced to Xen virtualization, the talk was pretty technical and I was <i>hacking</i> on an upcoming module at the same time, but I got the picture and I later signed up for a seminar by Novell and IBM on Xen and SUSE, which will be held in Copenhagen Zoo???<br/><br/>I talked to a lot of people I have not talked to in a long time, perhaps I convinced a possible sponsor to sponsor the Nordic Perl Workshop. Have not heard from them yet.<br/><br/>Went to see Matt S. Trouts talk on Catalyst, I had heard the same presentation in Birmingham at the YAPC::Europe, but since it was the only Perl talk, I felt I had to be there.<br/><br/>In general most of the presentations where very config, system administration, desktop stuff - not so much development and hacking, which makes me look forward to NPW, where it will be primarily hacking or at least related to, the programme was not so appealing to me.<br/><br/>Had asked Matt to mention the Nordic Perl Workshop in conjunction with his presentation, but he ran out of time - this had been a plan B, since we had been denied to have a flyer for NPW in the conference bag - however due to contacts and I guess a little persuasion, we got the flyer in the bag, so Matt's mentioning of NPW was not that crucial. The talk was however not attended by as many as one could hope for, I do not think Perl plays the same role is used to in this community of Linux/BSD users - well it probably plays the same role, but not to the same extent.<br/><br/>I talked to our local book pusher and they where willing to send us a few titles for purchase at NPW - now I just have to mail them a list of interesting Perl books.<br/><br/>My former boss, now in a new ISP company gave a talk about using open source to run a business, to me a really inspiring presentation and I really miss our discussions on methodologies - I think I will have a look at SCRUM, which he mentioned, it seemed to have a lot of resemblance to what we do today in logicLAB.<br/><br/>All in all the conference was good, but I miss something, I hope NPW can make up for this... it is nice to see and hear about all the things you can do with software, but software has to be developed and I guess this is much more interesting to me.</p>
