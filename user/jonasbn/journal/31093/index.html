<p>One of the local freelancers I employed part-time, did not really deliver. I am very busy and I do not enjoy micro-management, I actually think it is a waste of everybody's time. But after not getting any feedback from the freelancer I contacted him to hear what was going on, I knew he was also engaged elsewhere, hence the part-time agreement.<br/><br/>He told me he was sorry, but he did not have the time, so I asked him to mail me a tar-ball of the stuff he had and cut him loose. So it was a minor set back, but nothing I cannot handle - so we move on... let's go the TODO list does not fix itself and it does not get any shorter...<br/><br/>At the same time one of my customers are experimenting with outsourcing to India, the setup is quite nice, it is like you have an employee extra.<br/><br/>So I have been answering a lot of questions, been clarifying a lot of things - but I must admit I prefer working with more independent Perl knowledgable people (like my own Indian contact), but price is an important factor for my client, so I do not question that.<br/><br/>The other local freelancer I am using is very independent and things are getting done with this project, which should have been done some time ago, but at least we are covering some ground and I can focus on other things and I actually get a lot of things closed.</p>
