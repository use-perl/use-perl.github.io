<p>I went to my office Wednesday. I had not been there for a month and stuff was piling up at home, work related stuff that had to go to the office and I had to check the snailmail.<br/><br/>Anyway just after I got in the snailmail arrived - and guess what the long awaited contract was there.<br/><br/>I read through it and I could not help laughing. The contracted ended on the 15th. August - which was Wednesday.<br/><br/>So I stuck the contract in my bag and went on with my work.<br/><br/>Thursday I was back at the client's office I signed the contract and sent it via internal mail to the Sourcing Office. I set the signature date to the the 16th. of August and notes that the CEO's signature was the 16. of July.<br/><br/>Anyway now I have the contract in place and can send an invoice and I can start looking into prolonging the contract for 3 months more.<br/><br/>It has takes 3 months to get the contract in place, so perhaps I will have the next contract by medio November when it expires, lets see how it goes this time around.</p>
