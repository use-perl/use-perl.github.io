<p>I went to VÃÂ¤xjÃÂ¶ in Sweden for two days last week, I had to stay over night since the travelling all the way back and forth between Copenhagen  and VÃÂ¤xjÃÂ¶ is time consuming.<br/><br/>So I was booked into a hotel, but this time I was very much on my own, since Johan who used to live here <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/jplindstrom/journal/30784">moved to London</a>.<br/><br/>So after I went out to eat I just took a single beer and headed back to the hotel to do some work instead, I should have had a beer for Johan aswell - and Johan would problably have drunk two, so I would have had to have two for myself aswell... it was good I just went back to the hotel.<br/><br/>Missed Johans company though...<br/><br/></p>

On the bright side, I probably had a few pints over here, especially if it was last Thursday.

I am going to London in two weeks I however do not expect that I have the time to see you, since I will only be there for the weekend, which is most unfortunate<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-/<br><br>I have to come and visit you some other time... just me, without having planned to do x-mas shopping...

Well, if you have half an hour off, maybe we can meet up for a coffee or pint? (ping me when it&#180;s more current).
