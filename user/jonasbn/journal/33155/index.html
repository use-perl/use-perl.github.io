<p>The 5th. Nordic Perl Workshop is over. I have had a marvelous Sunday at NPW. I was not able to attend much Saturday. I actually only participated in the preparation and the registration, then I was away for family affairs. I did however make the social Saturday night, well and Fridag night. I skipped the one Sunday since I was totally wasted.<br/><br/>All in all I have a very good gut feeling about the workshop, we made some rookie mistakes, but we have gotten a lot of good feedback and people seemed to enjoy themselves.<br/><br/>We have only had few complaints, Copenhagen was really showing it's most beautiful side, with sun and nice weather. Jos Boumans had to complain though over a shower, which I believe occurred while he was indoor attending the workshop :)<br/><br/>The BoFs did not work out at all, I guess we need to decide on a new strategy for this, it seems as if more hand-holding is needed that expected.<br/><br/>Josh McAdams did a lot of interviews, I cannot wait to hear them, he will even put some podcasts of presentations online, I think the first one is already there.<br/><br/>Richard Lippmann saved my day, he extended a lightning talk and occupied a vacant slot - so I did not have to do a talk. brian d. foy also filled in last minute for a missing talk - thanks guys! I canceled my lightning talk on building a test module with Test::Builder, I was simply not in the mood. I will have to give it some other time. I have written an article on the topic, perhaps I can get brian d foy to publish it in 'The Perl Review'.<br/><br/>I am back at work know I have a deadline tomorrow, but I am pretty relaxed, the workshop boosted my confidence in Perl so I feel like I can overcome any problem that might occur.<br/><br/>Thanks to all attendees, speakers, sponsors, staff, volunteers, organizers - you all really made it worthwhile.</p>

I did not create the original logo, but I copied it's looks to some t-shirt design. Here I just used<br>'American Typewriter' as found on a Mac.<br><br>The guy who made the logo (Casper) also uses a Mac.
