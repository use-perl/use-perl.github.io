<p>The other night I was starting to fill in information in our organizers Wiki somewhat late in the evening, I jumped directly to bed and experienced my first YAPC::Europe 2008 nightmare.<br/><br/>It was horrible...<br/><br/>The venue was too big so we had to walk and walk and walk to locate something (pretty basic nightmare pattern) - things where all chaotic, but running along. I guess that part was not a nightmare, just social realism sneaking in. <br/><br/>brian d foy did not attend and I could not get anybody to tell me why, the dream ended before involving any travel to Iceland and any volcanoes or marathons.<br/><br/>I guess this will not the last nightmare I will experience on this topic, but I will attempt to avoid doing Wiki stuff just prior to going to bed.</p>

Sounds like a lot of fun, I am up for it.  Of course a soak in the excellent hot springs needs to happen after<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

<p>We (former YAPC orgas) usually don't talk about this in public (especially during call for proposals for next years YAPC), but having nightmares is just on part of the job description. I sure had some, but the "best" YAPC nightmare probably was experienced by <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/cog/journal/" title="perl.org">Jose</a perl.org>, who even shared it with the audience in the opening talk of YAPC::Europe 2005 in Braga.</p>

I remember Jose's presentation in Braga. I even experienced nightmares for the first few Nordic Perl Workshops, but I thinking that my nightmares this time are not about organizing the event, but something completely different, I am however still interpreting. The theory is however work and Christmas stress related, so there is nothing to worry about since it is like this every year at this time.
