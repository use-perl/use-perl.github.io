<div class="span8">
<p>I made a rapid release of Workflow (Workflow 0.32_4) - which should address some of our problems, but the number of failing tests are still very high and I see more and more of the same diagnostics.<br/><br/><url:http://www.cpantesters.org/show/Workflow.html#Workflow-0.32_4><br/><br/>So I started to dig into the problems.<br/><br/><ul>
<li>Processing workflow_action.xml: No _parse_* routine defined on this driver (If it is a filter, remember to set the Parent property. If you call the parse() method, make sure to set a Source. You may want to call parse_uri, parse_string or parse_file instead.) [XML::SAX::RTF=HASH(0x8721d18)] at /home/stro/perl510/lib/site_perl/5.10.0/XML/SAX/Base.pm line 2616.</li>
<li>Cannot read '/home/david/cpantesting/perl-5.10.0/.cpan/build/Workflow-0.32_4-qVqkc9/t/struct/workflow_sqlite.sql': No such file or directory at TestDBUtil.pm line 93.</li>
<li>A third one was a failure to build XML::Simple, but I cannot consider that a failure on my side, I think this particular problem of test reports on fails not related to the distribution being testing is being discussed quite intensively on the perl-testers-discuss mailing list right now.</li>
</ul><br/><br/>Since none of these are emitted from the Workflow code base I did some <i>googling</i> in the first one.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=512040">One of the links I found</a> <i>googling</i> was at <a href="http://www.perlmonks.org/">Perlmonks</a> so I clicked that right away<br/><br/>Here is the explanation, snipped from Perlmonks, it does however originate from <a href="http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.cpan.testers/2004/04/msg131214.html">a test report</a>:<br/><br/><quote>
The problem in this case is a bug in the XML::SAX::RTF installer,
which registers itself in ...lib.../XML/SAX/ParserDetails.ini.
This ini file is used to determine the default SAX parser and
since XML::SAX::RTF was installed most recently, it is the default.
Unfortunately, XML::SAX::RTF is not an XML parser (despite
generating SAX events) so it should be removed from the
ParserDetails.ini file.<br/><br/>I have reported this problem to the module maintainer some time
ago, but I will try again and submit a patch this time.<br/><br/>Thanks for the test.

</quote><br/><br/>I wrote Grant to inquire on the status of the problem. Referring to <a href="http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=5943">the RT ticket</a> <br/><br/>I installed <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/erikray/XML-SAX-RTF/">XML::SAX::RTF</a> and I could reproduce the error.<br/><br/>I wrote Andreas KÃÂ¶enig, whom I had just recently met at YAPC::Europe because he had sent me some test reports indicating failure as well and asked him to send me his: <code>XML/SAX/ParserDetails.ini</code><br/><br/>His file did however look different from mine, but the reports looked somewhat the same. Since he did not have XML::SAX::RTF installed. So I started to examine <a href="http://search.cpan.org/src/GRANTM/XML-SAX-0.96/">XML::SAX</a> and I came to the conclusion that this particular snippet is the problem (from <a href="http://search.cpan.org/src/GRANTM/XML-SAX-0.96/SAX/ParserFactory.pm">XML::SAX::ParserFactory</a>).<br/><br/><pre>
    if (@{$self->{KnownParsers}}) {
        return $self->{KnownParsers}[-1]{Name};
    }
    else {
        return "XML::SAX::PurePerl"; # backup plan!
    }
<pre><br/><br/>So as Grant stated earlier, the most recent <a href="http://search.cpan.org/src/GRANTM/XML-SAX-0.96/">XML::SAX</a> parser installation is the parser used. It is quite an easy fix, take the <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/grantm/XML-SAX-0.96/SAX/PurePerl.pm">XML::SAX::PurePerl</a> (the topmost in the <code>XML/SAX/ParserDetails.ini</code>) so we do not get behavior based on installation behavior. <br/><br/>The problem is then how do we fix this?<br/><br/>I discussed with another Workflow developer on our mailing list about indicating requirements for modules not used directly by Workflow and that solution is not good and since <a href="http://search.cpan.org/src/GRANTM/XML-SAX-0.96/">XML::SAX</a> is well encapsulated inside <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/grantm/XML-Simple/">XML::Simple</a> and the parser is well encapsulated within <a href="http://search.cpan.org/src/GRANTM/XML-SAX-0.96/">XML::SAX</a>, we cannot really control this, since it is all a matter of configuration.<br/><br/>So what we might have to do is write a test, which attempts to find out what parser is used and then bail (fail) or continue... this will however still result in failing tests indicating that Workflow fails.<br/><br/>Installation of modules is mostly done by people so the <a href="http://search.cpan.org/src/GRANTM/XML-SAX-0.96/">XML::SAX</a> configuration is our weakest link, I would prefer to rewrite the above snippet to be:<br/><br/><pre>
    if (@{$self->{KnownParsers}}) {
		#defaults to XML::SAX::PurePerl
        return $self->{KnownParsers}[0]{Name};
    }
    else {
        return "XML::SAX::PurePerl"; # backup plan!
    }
<pre><br/><br/>So we know we always get <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/grantm/XML-SAX-0.96/SAX/PurePerl.pm">XML::SAX::PurePerl</a> unless the user has changed the precedence in his/her <code>XML/SAX/ParserDetails.ini</code>.<br/><br/>This will however break a lot of <a href="http://search.cpan.org/src/GRANTM/XML-SAX-0.96/">XML::SAX</a> installations, but the current implementation is stupid and yields unpredictable behavior - and we do not like unpredictable do we?<br/><br/>I have not gotten my head around the <a href="http://search.cpan.org/src/GRANTM/XML-SAX-0.96/">XML::SAX</a> feature system, perhaps this could be used to tweak <a href="http://search.cpan.org/src/GRANTM/XML-SAX-0.96/">XML::SAX</a> into behaving more predictably, but that will require patches to all parser distributions, <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/grantm/XML-Simple/">XML::Simple</a> and other places beyond my control and I feel like a I am straying from what I intentionally wanted to do, which was releasing Workflow 0.32.<br/><br/>About the other problem, I think this might have to be related to a definition of <i>root</i> directory, but I have not investigated this any further...<br/><br/>This situation calls for a quote from the Coneheads movie trailer (I have never seen the movie)<br/><br/>Coast guard using megaphone addressing refugees on a boat:
<quote>
We appreciate your situation, but we have problems of our own
</quote><br/><br/>I am not sure the quote is correct, but it always pop to mind when situations like this occur.</p>
