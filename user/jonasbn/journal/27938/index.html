<p>I finally got some time to sit down an try out <a href="http://www.activestate.com/Products/Komodo/">Komodo</a> for OSX, I had some problems with downloading the dmg from <a href="http://www.activestate.com/">ActiveStates</a> site, but a quick query to #perl and a helpful person could provide me with a different URL for download (thanks kgftr|konobi).<br/><br/>So after installation I setup a project based on one of my existing projects in CVS, imported the files and started working, there is nothing like hands on - and doing actual work in a project I new would be a good way to evaluate whether Komodo could add anything to my development.<br/><br/>I downloaded the professional edition, since it had version control integration, this is not in the persional edition for some reason (see: the <a href="http://www.activestate.com/Products/Komodo/editions.plex">feature comparison list</a>).<br/><br/>But everything was imported from the file system and I got started working. The editor seemed a bit slow, I had of course imported a HUGE project and there for the code scanned and revision control integration takes a lot of cycles and resources, so I am convinced that I need a faster computer, I am currently using a 550 mHz, TiBook - I think you can disable some of these features, but that kind of take the gas of Komodo if you ask me.<br/><br/>Today I imported a smaller project, which was under revision control in Subversion everything seems to work a bit faster, probably due to the size of the project.<br/><br/>I started working on integrating some of the build steps used in my Perl projects, like:<br/><br/><li>perl Build.PL
<li>./build test
<li>./build testcover<br/><br/>And this is SO easy, I have actually never tried an IDE where this was so simple - now I just have to figure a way to get it integrated into a menu.<br/><br/>Komodo is really cool and I think I will buy a license after my triel license runs out on the 23rd. of december.

The good thing (for me) is that one license for any OS I work on.



<h2>Rendering on OS X was goofy for me</h2>

I tried to run it on a G5 IMac and found that it couldn't keep up with my typing (the letters disappeared until I stopped typing)... and I don't type that fast.<br/><br/>I ran into other strange-ism with it. I really wanted to like it. And I wish they would add 'vi' key bindings.

<p>That is strange...when up to speed I probably type around 60WPM and it does fine on my G4 iBook.</p>

<p>"vi" bindings have been braught up in he newsgroup and that is a "to do".</p>

Well I experience the <i>slow cursor</i> aswell - I suspect the constant code analysis (evaluation) - I will try to disable this and see how it goes.
