<p>I have worked overtime for the last 3 days, I have a kid that will not sleep at night, my name gets mentioned at steering committee meetings as a bottleneck and I am turning 36 next week.<br/><br/>I have several journal entries I would like to write in order to reflect on everything, but I just do not have the time...<br/><br/>Could somebody at the end of the tunnel please turn on the light?</p>

<h2>Certainly</h2>

The locomotive has a shiny headlight on it. We can fire it up if if you don't want to wait 3 months.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

<p>I've got four kids, all under age <b>three</b>, and we have far more than our share of sleeping difficulties, as well.  And I'm on primary childcare duty most nights because my wife just had so many sleeping problems with child #2.  (3 and 4 are twins which arrived in August.)</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I'm at a brand new job, where I'm trying to put in some amount of overtime since I really have to get up to speed and I also want them to see value from me right away.</p>

<p>Hang in there!</p>

<p>Oh, and check out <i>Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Child</i>.  Poorly-organized, but the information in it worked wonders for our first child after the birth of our second, and also helped us get our second started on great sleeping habits (he is generally one of our best sleepers).</p>
