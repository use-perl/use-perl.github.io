<p>The <a href="http://perlworkshop.dk/">SPW</a> is over. I had planned to write daily updates on the progress of the SPW day by day, but the workshop acutally took up more time than I expected, but know I am 'back' - well I have the time to write in my journal again, so I might aswell reflect a bit on the just finished SPW.<br/><br/>The SPW went better than I had dared hoped for. The turn-up was amazing with about 71 regitrants (including speakers). The speakers did a marvellous job and the workshop had a high technical standard.<br/><br/>There are many things we need to do differently and the feedback from speakers and attendees have been great - both good and bad but very constructive.<br/><br/>The goal is to move the SPW to Stockholm next year, since <a href="http://copenhagen.pm.org/">Copenhagen Perl Mongers</a> are bidding in on the hosting of <a href="http://www.yapc.org/">YAPC::Europe</a> 2004 in competition with <a href="http://belfast.pm.org/">Belfast.pm</a>.<br/><br/>I have had a few ideas for a few new modules so I have to get started on these.<br/><br/>Thanks to all the people and speakers who participated in the SPW - you made all the hard work worthwhile...</p>

<p>Glad to hear it went so well and I'm sure we'll come next year. Maybe the apartment renovations will be done by then<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) And, you know, if you changed the name from scandinavian to nordic you might even be welcome to host it in Helsinki, too<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

Thank You very much,<br> <br>The name change suggestion was actually mentioned at a BOF the last day and since the workshop already have changed name once, from Copenhagen Perl Workshop to Scandinavian Perl Workshop, I do not see why we should not have yet another name change (YANC). The message is the same - Perl Workshop.
