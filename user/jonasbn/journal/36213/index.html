<p>I completed my longest run ever - running.<br/><br/>The last 7 kilometers were painful though and not having run in March shows it signs, I am however full of confidence and with 4 weeks left to the Copenhagen Marathon, I actually think I can get ready.<br/><br/>My legs felt quite sore when I finished. But it was in the mucles, I felt no other pain - so I am quite confident that it is simply a matter of training. No sore angles, feet or knees. My back was tired though.<br/><br/>When getting in the shower at home I however experienced a new sensation. Underneath one of my arms all of my skin was all red, above and below the armpit. Apparently my running shirt had irritated my skin the skin felt like I had got burned. So when I smeared it in lotion the pain came - the next time I think will use aloe vera.<br/><br/>This was quite interesting however. One thing is running and you can get into to shape to run really long runs, but does your gear work as expected.<br/><br/>I have had no problems with this shirt on my shorter trips, but apparently the combination of time and sweat made this occur and luckily I did not notice until I was in the shower.<br/><br/>One of my friends have given some advice on running a marathon, he said 'running socks' are your friends. and he was right. He also said 'vaseline' is my friend - I think he might be right.<br/><br/>So I am going to follow the advice on vaseline and duct tape to avoid friction problems while on the marathon.<br/><br/>Next weekend is 25 km. I will run in a different shirt to see how it plays along - I expect I need a wardrobe of at least one short and one long sleeved shirt for the Copenhagen Marathon since the weather might be good or bad, last year it was really hot, but lets see when we get closer, right now we have a fantastic spring time here and the weather is good for running and I need to cover some miles within the next four weeks.</p>
