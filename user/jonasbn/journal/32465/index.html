<p>A spanish guy contacted me, since he wanted to implement Date::Holidays::ES. He had some issues with Date::Holidays, which proofed to be a bug.<br/><br/>So I went through the module, which was getting more and more hard to maintain with weird exceptions in all corners of the module.<br/><br/>I added Kwalitee and Perl::Critic tests and started to clean, since there is more to good code than passing these tests :)<br/><br/>I read up on the Adapter pattern and thought that this was just what I needed.<br/><br/>Here are the Changes for the 0.09 release:<br/><br/><pre>
- Added no_indexing of t/ directory to Build.PL<br/><br/>- Updated README with pod2text appending of Date::Holidays POD<br/><br/>- Code cleaned a bit, much work still to be done<br/><br/>- Wrote some better DIAGNOSTICS and added 3 more Exceptions
    lib/Date/Holidays/Exception/InvalidCountryCodep.pm
    lib/Date/Holidays/Exception/NoCountrySpecified.pm
    lib/Date/Holidays/Exception/UnsupportedMethod.pm   <br/><br/>- Added a few tests adapters for some of the tests dating before the 
  refactoring (all tests now pass)
  
  t/lib/Date/Holidays/Adapter/NOPOLY.t
  t/lib/Date/Holidays/Adapter/OOP.t
  
- Renamed _loader in Date::Holidays to _fetch and _load, see also the similar
  methods in Date::Holidays::Adapter
  
  _loader.t obsolete and removed<br/><br/>- Introduced use of Error (Exceptions) for better diagnostics:
    Date/Holidays/Exception/AdapterInitialization.pm
    Date/Holidays/Exception/AdapterLoad.pm
    Date/Holidays/Exception/SuperAdapterLoad.pm<br/><br/>- Refactored the whole thing to a variation of an object adapter pattern,
  introduced:
  
    lib/Date/Holidays/Adapter.pm
    lib/Date/Holidays/Adapter/
    lib/Date/Holidays/Adapter/AU.pm
    lib/Date/Holidays/Adapter/DE.pm
    lib/Date/Holidays/Adapter/DK.pm
    lib/Date/Holidays/Adapter/FR.pm
    lib/Date/Holidays/Adapter/GB.pm
    lib/Date/Holidays/Adapter/JP.pm
    lib/Date/Holidays/Adapter/NO.pm
    lib/Date/Holidays/Adapter/PT.pm
    
  tests are located in t/Adapter:
    _fetch.t
    _load.t
    new.t
  
- Set severity to 3 for Test::Perl::Critic test
  ran code through perltidy to remove hard tabs
  
- Set severity to 4 for Test::Perl::Critic test
  added use warnings statement<br/><br/>- Changed the constructor to no longer be able to initialize a shallow object.
  If you want to make use of Date::Holidays ability to check all countries for
  a given holiday please, use it using full namespace. POD updated
  correspondingly.<br/><br/>- Addressed issue with method calling problems, OOP vs. Procedural vs. the weird
  mix I personally had boiled up, thanks to Florian Merges for reporting this.<br/><br/>  This has resulted in a minor cleanup and again I can see that the current
  architecture is not optimal, I am planning a major rewrite, to eliminate
  the problems of handling new classes introduced in the Date::Holidays::*
  namespace.
  
  I am not an authority of any kind, I just attempt to get things to play
  along nicely.
  
  New files introduced:
    t/NOPOLY.t
    t/OOP.t
    t/SUPERED.t
    t/ABSTRACTED.t
    t/PRODUCERAL.t
    t/new.t<br/><br/>  and the test classes (in t/lib/Date/Holidays):
    ABSTRACTED.pm
    NOPOLY.pm
    OOP.pm
    PROCUDERAL.pm
    SUPERED.pm    
    
- Updated MANIFEST.SKIP with more contemporary version<br/><br/>- Added t/critic.t, Test::Perl::Critic test, currently at severity 5.
  In addition to this I changed the 'return undef's scattered all over the code
  to simple return statements.<br/><br/>- Added t/kwalitee.t, Test::Kwalitee test, diabled check for symlinks since
  it reacted on symlinked .releaserc in directory, which however is NOT in the
  distribution even though it thinks so<br/><br/>  Added the following as a result of the Kwalitee test:
    t/pod.t
    t/pod-coverage.t<br/><br/>- Added use of Module::Load to Build.PL and to own _loader routine in
  Date::Holidays. I also added:
    t/_loader.t to isolate the actual test
</pre><br/><br/>This module might not be of much use in the real world, but at least it lets me practice a few things, which I do not always have the time with  such isolated cases.<br/><br/>From Date::Holidays 0.09 I have gotten the following:<br/><br/>- Hands-on with the Adapter pattern
- More experience with Error and Exceptions in Perl
- A sense for some more of the best practices from PBP
- Try out with the distribution file layout of <b>one-sub, one-test file</b> so when refactoring you just introduce the tests with the new subs and the ones that go you simply delete the .t files, no questions asked
- Use of .t files as entry point for debugging
- Hands-on with the Komodo debugger<br/><br/>0.09 will result in a 0.10, when the smoke settles , but it felt good to get the refactoring done, much POD to be written though and more tests to be implemented.</p>
