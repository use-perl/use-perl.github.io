<p>I was not able to get up this morning. I attended a friends <i>polter abend</i> yesterday, so I had to postpone my running trip at 07:00.<br/><br/>So when I got home I went running around 20:00. My plan was to extend my trip this wednesday. So I would be running 2 laps around the local lake, but tonight my legs felt good - and I was in a good mood, so I just kept going.<br/><br/>So I ran two laps in a good speed (I think I could have continued further). This is the trip I used to run 10 years ago (only faster), so now I can start working on increasing my speed...<br/><br/>The only problem about running this late is all the mosquito bites... wednesday I will be back to running in the morning.</p>

That, I did not know... you actually avoid the mosquitos by going in the morning? What, are they asleep?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-|<br> <br>This can be great information<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

Well it is a completely unscientific observation.<br> <br>I just gotten mosquito bites in the evening and not in the morning - I have observed (in eye and mouth) mosquitos in the morning (during summer), so perhaps the season also has something to say.<br> <br>I can perhaps obtain more data by running naked and exposing more skin?

<p>Yes, you do that, and then tell us something about it O:-)</p>
