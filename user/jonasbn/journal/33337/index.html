<p>Another day at the mine, I mean work, I mean the place I go to in the morning.<br/><br/>Well I got a mail today from my manager, my PC had arrived, a bit surprised I went to the IT department to pick it up. It was a nice Dell machine. I have seen my fellow developers use this running duel-head, so I was <i>hooked</i> right away.<br/><br/>After picking it up, unpacking and enjoying the nice smell of new computer, it struck me - this is another part of the assimilation scheme.<br/><br/>I had to reinstall all the applications I had been strugling with and even a few more, which was already installed on the machine I had used at first, this would leave me numb and easier to assimilate.<br/><br/>Well I went ahead, not having anything else to do. Well I have several CPAN modules, which need maintaining and other things, but my Mac does not have network access.<br/><br/>So I fired up my browser and started a bombardment of the IT department, requesting installation of apps, administrator access to the Windows workstation, a DVI cable so I could run dual-head, might aswell play by the rules. These people where however really patient and friendly so they responded to all of my requests and fulfilled the ones they could, but no DVI cable for me though. So I lost one of the carrots I had, the last one being starting to look at the actual Perl code.<br/><br/>At the same time I contacted some of the people I know in the building and I got myself some extra network cables etc. So hopefully I can at least spend some CPU cycles on my Mac until I get access to the Perl code I am supposed to work on.<br/><br/>Tomorrow I am spending all day at my own office, then I can really get some stuff done.</p>
