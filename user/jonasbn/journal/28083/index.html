<p>I have wanted to upgrade to Tiger for quite some time and I have for a long time known that the acquisition of a new PowerBook would be come relevant sometime in the future, but any way - I went to the local Apple reseller and bought 10.4/Tiger.<br/><br/>The installation went quite easy as the prior upgrades have done, my TiBook has been running: 10.1-10.3 and now 10.4.<br/><br/>BUT then the trouble began, apparently a lot of things have changed since Panther.<br/><br/>At first I found out that my httpd.conf and /etc/hosts had been overwritten, nothing to cry about - the httpd.conf was easily recovered from the renamed copy left by the installation.<br/><br/>The /etc/hosts file is only used by me for development, so I could easily add the stuff I needed - but nothing happened.<br/><br/>Apparently Apple have made several changes from Panther so following <a href="http://www.macwrite.com/criticalmass/mac-os-x-hosts-regrouped.php">this article</a>, I could back to a more *nix-like behavior like in Panther where the /etc/hosts file has the highest precedence.<br/><br/>Next problem, the Mail.app was not working at all, this <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/6985">simple fix</a> giving a feeling of success for a few hours - but Mail.app seems VERY wonky. I found a blog entry mentioned clearing the ~/Library/Preferences, not finding the idea of the <i>fix</i> particularly sane - it got me looking into the directory and there was quite a few things I could delete and then all of a sudden Mail.app started running for a longer period of time????<br/><br/>Moving on, next problem...<br/><br/>Getting my development environment up and running with the standard installation I expected to be a walk in the park - NOT!<br/><br/>Perl is no longer installed with parts of the source code leaving the CPAN installation semi-broken, the suggestion is to build your own - so I did, Locale test 99 breaks, so currently I am in a kind of limbo - I am tired and I do not know in what direction to move.<br/><br/>I REALLY REALLY miss my Panther :-/</p>

<h2>CPAN Problem?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/sigzero/">sigzero</a> on 2005-12-21T22:31:49</h3>
I have been using CPAN on Tiger for a bit now with no problems at all. What kind of problems are you having?

The problem was building stuff, the fix was to update Xcode (and related) - which I assumed had happened automatically, everything works swell now.<br><br>jonasbn
