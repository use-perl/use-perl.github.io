<p>I am currently revisiting my functional tests, which I developed for work, using Perl and Test::Harness.<br/><br/>The are getting a major refactoring and all because I was asked to run an acceptance test of one of our web services.<br/><br/>Well since I am not the kind of guy who believes in Unit-testing I though I would automate the test so I could run it over and over again. Our project seriously lacks unit-tests even though I have done my part to introduce both Nunit (XUnit framework for .NET and utPL/SQL, XUnit framework for utPL/SQL). I never got around to trying out the utPL/SQL, but at least it is there and the NUnit is really neat to work with.<br/><br/>Any way now I am automating the generation of a number of test scenarios and running them, and at the same time my functional test are being cleaned up. Perl is really magnificent for this kind of work, since it is truly a glue language, it makes you feel like 'I am the test king - I can do anything', and I seriously consider making a new presentation of Perl testing capabilities in the forum of Copenhagen Perl Mongers (when is the YAPC::Europe 2003 opening for proposals).<br/><br/>So everything is developing quite rapidly and the test code itself is getting better all the time, good to have some time coding Perl instead of VB.NET :)
