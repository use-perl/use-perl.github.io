<p>Well first day is (almost) over. The party I am travelling with
(Copenhagen Perl  Mongers) and I got here a bit late, so we actually
only made the lunch and Michael G. Schwerns presentation on tests...<br/><br/>Well as always Schwerns presentation was a chaotic experience, but
anyway it was both entertaining and very informative as always.<br/><br/>I am trying to lay out plans for what other presentations I want to hear
and I must admit there is a lot of interesting stuff such as:<br/><br/>- Source Filters
- ExtUtils::ModuleMaker 
- ELRIC (agent technology)<br/><br/>So tomorrow will be a long and hard day.<br/><br/>Right now I am in the mode to drink beer or catch up on some Perl
programming, but I am not sure I am fit for the latter, and the first is
probably more realistic eventhough we have to be here at nine tomorrow.<br/><br/>Well I am feeling the same experience as when I attended TPC5 last year,
a nice feeling of inspiration and urge to hack some Perl and I guess the
urge will be even greater tomorrow after having listened to the
presentations mentioned above.<br/><br/>Source Filters sound very interesting, but I have never had a chance to
use them, perhaps after tomorrow.<br/><br/>ExtUtils::ModuleMaker could be expected to very much in line with my
thoughts on some of the POD utilies I have on the draing board.<br/><br/>And finally agents have for a long time been one of my interests, sad
that the PerlAgent mailing list is so low-(no)-traffic.<br/><br/>Well that is it from me for now, hopefully I can write another entry
tomorrow.<br/><br/>This should have been uploaded, but unfortunately the wireless LAN
disappeared.<br/><br/>This should have been uploaded yesterday, but unfortunately the wireless
LAN disappeared.<br/><br/>Pictures can be seen at: http://gallery.legart.dk/YAPC/</p>
