<p>I got an answer from the author of Module::Info (Mattia Barbon) today. And as I anticipated he is probably going to reject my patches.<br/><br/>It is only the second time I send a patch to somebody and apparently I had the proces of using diff upside down :)<br/><br/>So just for the fun of it I have recreated the pathes (following the advice of Mattia) so I at least could get the hang of using diff properly.<br/><br/>I argued why the patches should be applied, but at the same time I understand Mattia and I respect his decision and that he is the author of Module::Info - and I am thankful that he got back to me with feedback.<br/><br/>Well I learned a lot from the proces - and I will propably make patches to modules again if I get the opportunity, but at the same time I have other things on the drawing board so there is no reason to dwell on this.</p>

<p>I seem to remember <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/schwern" title="perl.org">Schwern</a perl.org> offering this up to the highest bidder a few months ago so it could get the attention it deserved. It's mighty cool how it uses B::Utils to parse the opcode tree. I've been meaning to learn more about that for a few months and just haven't found the time somehow. It looks like Mattia has been applying quite a few patches since he took over, so I imagine he has some solid reasons for not applying your patch.</p> <blockquote><div> <tt>0.20<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; - Fixed a warning in module_info (thanks to Nathan Torkington)<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; - Corrected number of skipped tests for Perl versions earlier<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; thank 5.6.1 (thanks to Mike Fragassi)<br> <br>0.19&nbsp; Tue Apr&nbsp; 1 15:45:43 CEST 2003<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; + Added package_versions() (patch by Ken Williams).<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; - Fixed handling of v-strings in use/require.<br> <br>0.18&nbsp; Sat Mar&nbsp; 8 17:44:24 CET 2003<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; + Upgraded bundled B::Utils to 0.04 + Schwern patches.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; - Fixed detection of require() statements in non-trivial BEGIN blocks.<br> <br>0.17&nbsp; Sun Mar&nbsp; 2 11:01:55 CET 2003<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; + Added module_info.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; - Fixed a warning when enumerating packages.<br> <br>0.16&nbsp; Wed Jan&nbsp; 1 21:21:31 CET 2003<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; - Capture stderr output on MacOS Classic (thanks to Axel Rose for<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the patch)</tt> </div></blockquote>
