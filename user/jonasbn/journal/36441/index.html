<div class="span8">
<p>When I first started out as a freelancer, I spent many days at my office just fooling around, experimenting, maintaining my CPAN distributions etc.<br/><br/>This is of course not something you can live by and slowly work took over and all of my time became client time.<br/><br/>My original goal, which still is my actual goal was to develop some products and turn my business into a microISV, in order to
support this I do freelance consulting and this has totally taken over my complete business.<br/><br/>So I do not get to do much open source hacking or development on own products, all of my time is spent writing code for other 
companies and their products.<br/><br/>So I cannot really complain since I like programming, I get to program Perl and I get to work on with tools of my own choice on my own laptop.<br/><br/>Well these last months has shown me that I am sort of growing tired of this, tired of just being a resource. So I have hired a freelancer to take some of the load and I can squeeze in some other things, like some open source hacking etc. and perhaps even some new client so I can get exposed to some other problem areas.<br/><br/>So yesterday I took a <i>Google day</i>, lacking a better term describing this. But everybody seems to know what Google's policy is on this area.<br/><br/>Anyway I started working on a new module and got some work done on organizing YAPC::Europe 2008.<br/><br/>This was really satisfying and I can only say that I have to do this on a more regular basis.</p>
