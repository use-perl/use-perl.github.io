<div class="span8">
<p>I finally took a serious look at <a href="http://www.lastcraft.com/simple_test.php">simple-test</a>, a unit testing framework for PHP. Its is an xUnit based framework, which mean it looks a lot like the things I did in VB.NET at my prior job.<br/><br/>The use of a unit-test framework gives me a lot of things, things I might have mentioned in this journal earlier and which might hear other of advocates of unit testing saying.
<ul>
<li>A possibility of asserting what I do is correct
<li>Possibility of testing the code before delivering to my client
<li>The freedom to refactor things
<li>Elimination of fear in coding a language I am not that familiar with
</ul>
NUnit eased my way into VB.NET and I hope simple-test will do the same for PHP. I will probably have to start looking around for a Unit-test framework for Javascript since these are the languages in which I do most of my work.<br/><br/>The last bullet is probably the most important, since I do not have the time to fool around too much, since time is money when you are a freelancer and eliminating fear really helps getting things moving.<br/><br/>Some guy at the YAPC::Europe in Belfast gave a lightning talk, where he quoted a more experienced co-worker who had said to him: <i>"Never code in fear"</i>, inspired by this I am attempting to make this a rule of thumb in my business.<br/><br/>And I feel that things are improving...</p>
