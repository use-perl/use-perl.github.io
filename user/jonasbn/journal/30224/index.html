<p>I got a MMS from a friend today containing the text <cite>"It is happening again"</cite> a reference to the TV series "Twin Peaks" and something completely different, but I am having that kind of experience getting a laptop from Apple in due time to bring it with me on holiday.<br/><br/>My Powerbook is still suffering from insomnia, so I decided to order a new machine in so I can get my PowerBook handed in for repairs, I have the money to buy a new machine and I do not have the time to be without a laptop so that is the solution, not the most economical one, but from my perspective the most flexible one.<br/><br/>So, apropos flexibility, I ordered a new MacBook Pro on the 29th. of June and the order info indicated a delivery by the 10th. of July, not impressive, but what the heck I am in no hurry, as such.<br/><br/>But I am leaving for Bornholm on the 10th. to get married by the 22nd. and I would like to bring the new machine in order to configure it, before August and the next two quarters, which are booked with assignments.<br/><br/>So I called Apple and talked to some sweet norwegian girl who changed my delivery address to my home address, since I will be at home all day packing - no problem, mistake #1.<br/><br/>So all of a sudden they change the delivery date to the 12th. and the 13th. I should of course have changed the address all the way to the place I am going :-/<br/><br/>So I called Apple again, but now they want me to send them a copy of my passport in order to change my delivery address again - this might have to do with the fact that the items are in possesion of a courier of sorts.<br/><br/>I have no photocopier and I have no scanner. so...<br/><br/>Guess I have to call Apple again, what tone of voice should I use, the sobbing one or the angry one, what would a guy with a degree in Smartology do???<br/><br/><br/><br/> </p>
