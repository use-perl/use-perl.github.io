<div class="span8">
<p>I got contacted by a consulting firm. I am in their database, but the inquiry originated from <a href="http://www.itb.dk/site.aspx?p=31">the IT business interest organization ITB</a>. The ITB have launched a campaign to attract young people to the IT business since we are seriously lacking people in this sector in Denmark.<br/><br/>I have previously had a student in training in my company for a week and I very much believe in this concept for giving a people a glance into a world they have no chance of getting to know, while in school unless they have direct contact with the business via family or something.<br/><br/>So this new inquiry sounded very interesting and I mailed ITB the relevant information and indicated my interest.<br/><br/>Now I am officially a 'Role Model' with ITB and perhaps they will ask me to visit a high school or job fair to give my view and version on how it is to work in the IT business.<br/><br/>So yesterday I was invited to a workshop on being a role model and how you would go about adressing high school students.<br/><br/>I somewhat assumed what the audience at the workshop would be, so I wore my 2600 hooded sweatshirt, with the writing 'hacker' on the back. The last workshop I attended was the NPW, but this was different - And as I assumed I totally stood out. Ties, black suits, high-heels and lots of ironed pants - it looked like a business school class reunion.<br/><br/>I actually met a fellow Perl hacker whom I now from back when I was a Linux user and a member of the local LUG (SSLUG), he had however chosen to wear a more formal outfit - oh well.<br/><br/>In general the workshop was quite good. We got information from a journalist specializing in story telling and in the end the principle from <a href="http://www.filmskolen.dk/english/index.html">The National Film School of Denmark</a><br/><br/>And that guy (Poul Nesgaard) is really funny, I used to watch him on TV when I was a kid and he could still make me laugh.<br/><br/>So now I am just awaiting an invitation to go out and entertain young people with the delights of working in the IT business.<br/><br/>I am trying to gather as many anecdotes from my work as I can to see if I have any which can be entertaining enough to present to the targeted audience. </p>
