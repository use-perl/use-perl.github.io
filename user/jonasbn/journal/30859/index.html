<div class="span8">
<p>This morning at the breakfast table (with the other Copenhagen Perl Mongers who got up) we discussed an idea of mine about how to do the community calendar for the Perl community, so I whipped up a lightning talk.<br/><br/>The idea is to use plagger or parts of plagger to aggregate, handle and merge iCal feeds.<br/><br/>So I want to the talk on Plagger and it actually seems as if this is doable (or soon to be), using plugins, the difficult part is going to be the GUI manipulating the plagger configurations.<br/><br/>I talked to Jeff (the guy in charge of the lightning talk session), but there where no available slots, so I might do the presentation, so I might have to write up a spec. and have somebody else run with it. Which also the aim of the lightning talk actually - talked to MIYAGAWA directly instead.<br/><br/>Said hello to Josette Garcia who was at the O'Reilly stand, she is always helpful and really nice, nice to be able to put a face on a name.<br/><br/>My second talk went alright, it was also the talk I have done the most times, I can really recommend doing your talk several times, present it to your local PM before a workshop and at a workshop before a YAPC or something.<br/><br/>Found some of the guys who attended my Micro-ISV talk and inquired whether they had ambition of starting their own Micro-ISVs and it seems as if it is something people find intriguing, but taking the jump is a tough decision - well I know, I made the decision.<br/><br/>Good lightning talks especially the one on <i>undef</i>. cog gave a talk on synchronization of european workshops in order to attract foreign Perl speakers such as Damian, Larry, MJD et al. It is a good idea, but somehow difficult to implement in that sense the external factors surrounding the organization of a workshop are plentyful<br/><br/>The auction went quite well I got 5 books this almost completes my Apress Perl book collection and I got the Perl Hacks from O'Reilly, which was sold out at the at the O'Reilly stand. I only got Ovid to sign it though.<br/><br/>After dinner and some drinke I talked to a lot of different people, got to talk to some of the organizers aswell - they commented on my journal entry from yesterday, I am not totally clear on the problems within YEF (<b>Y</b>APC <b>E</b>urope <b>F</b>oundation) or whether it was me just interpreting what I heard.<br/><br/>This raises another problem and that is the transparency of these organizations I must admit the TPF blog really addressed this and the TPF work has become much more easy to follow. Perhaps we need something similar for the YEF.<br/><br/>I respect the people who do foundation work, I have however never really understood the complete goal of YEF. Taking a vote on the next YAPC::Europe foundation is the only visible thing, then there of course is <a href="http://act.mongueurs.net/">Act</a> (which finally is going open source). But since we have never had to make use of the YEF, my experiences in interacting with YEF are non-existant, but as far I as I know the YEF is not always an easy partner to work with, the NPW/Stockholm.pm waited a long time to get their money from YEF, which had been handled by YEF using Act. And this years organizers did not make use of YEF all the same, I have not been involved in YAPC::Europe 2006, but I recommended using Act to Stockholm.pm, because I think it is a good idea, I did not expect Stockholm.pm to experience these trivial problems.<br/><br/>But anyway, I think we should be able to have an open debate about YEF and we need to make YEF more transparent.
