<p>Why? why? why? do people call it YAPC::EU. EU is a political construct not a geographical region. Europe is a geographical region and the YAPC::Europe is set in this region - YAPC::Europe has nothing to do with politics to my knowledge. <br/><br/>If you look at all the other YAPCs all of these are referring to geographical regions and not political constallations, examples (North-America, Israel, Canada, Taiwan).</p>

&gt; If you look at all the other YAPCs all of these are referring to geographical regions and not political constallations, examples (North-America, Israel, Canada, Taiwan).<br> <br>Errrmmm... how exactly are Israel and Canada "geographical, not political"?  NA is a continent one can clearly see in a *geographical* map, and Taiwan is clearly an island (though I have this nagging feeling the island might have been called something else before the split of the Chinas).<br> <br>I cannot see anything obviously *geographical* separating Israel or Canada from their neighbours.  (If one wants to pick nits, the southern border of "North America" is also a bit vague.)<br> <br>That being said, I agree<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-) with your sentiment that "YAPC::EU" is silly, an unnecessary "acronymisation", but hey, that's how us geeks like to do things. TIMTOWTDI, HTH.<br> <br>

Heh, you are right borders and countries are just as political. I guess being irritated over the EU acronym, caused me to not think clearly on this fine saturday morning.<br> <br>And maybe its because I voted against the EU, the last time we where asked by our politicians...

<i>Taiwan is clearly an island (though I have this nagging feeling the island might have been called something else before the split of the Chinas)</i> <br> <br>No, the Chinese have always called it Taiwan.  Of course, they never called it the Republic of China before the 1950s.
