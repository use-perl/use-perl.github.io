<p>The machine has been running quite ok - no freezes etc. but a new sort of problem have occurred and judging from the content of the discussions on the Apple site in the support section - I am not the only one.<br/><br/>So I am considering doing another OS reinstall, now that I have a bare laptop and before I start to roll the back-ups back on.<br/><br/>The problem is that the sleep mode no longer works, which is kind of annoying, I almost never shut down my old TiBook I always used sleep.<br/><br/>If the next reinstall does not fix this problem I will return the computer once again.<br/><br/>I was expecting to work on my new computer and I have tonnes of code I need to write, so all this Apple-Crapable is really starting to get on my nerves.</p>

Hello,<br><br>May I ask what your specific sleep problem is, and maybe for some pointers to forum threads?<br><br>My TiBook recently stopped going to sleep -- the screen blanks and either I get the spinning beach ball, or a cursor that has nothing to point at.  I can only get out of this state by using the power button to reboot.<br><br>I haven't been able to find quite this set of circumstances in the Apple forums or other places, and it's rather obnoxious.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)<br><br>Thanks<br><br>-Matt<br>

Well the problem is that if I fold my laptop together it does not go into sleep mode - if I select the sleep mode from the menu, the pointer disappears and the machine freezes.<br><br>I am currently experiencing problem with the <a href="http://discussions.apple.com/category.jspa?categoryID=135" title="apple.com">Apple website</a apple.com>, where I could see that people had similar problems when search for "sleep", the posts are of newer dates (late january)<br><br>Weird that it is easier to put my one year old son to sleep than the PB<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-/

<p>With Panther, I had sporadic problems with putting my 15" Aluminum PB to sleep after I added third-party memory (a 1 GB Kingston something or other). Sometimes it wouldn't come out of sleep when I closed the shell while sometimes it wouldn't go to sleep at all. (And sometimes it even worked.) Using 'Apple | Sleep' worked more often but every once it in a while it still put the machine into a permanent sleep.</p>

<p>Upgrading to Tiger with the memory was impossible (it wouldn't even start) and I had to go back to 512 MB.  Recently, I picked up a GB from Crucial and it's worked perfectly.</p>

Putting the PB into sleep pushing the power-button and select sleep does not work either<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-/
