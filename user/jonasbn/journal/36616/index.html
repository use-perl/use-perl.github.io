<p>A long time ago I reported <a href="http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=22540">an issue</a> with a Catalyst plugin.<br/><br/><cite>
The POD indicates it is possible to set a temporary directory for use with
Catalyst::Request::Upload in Catalyst::Request::Upload.<br/><br/>This does however not seem to work.<br/><br/>jonasbn
</cite><br/><br/>A few days ago I received a response:<br/><br/><cite>
Can you provide us with a failing test case?	
</cite><br/><br/>The mail caught me at a very bad time and I was a very few keystrokes from responding:<br/><br/><cite>
Can you provide me with a succeeding test case?
</cite><br/><br/>But luckily I did not.<br/><br/>My problem is simply the response time from when I sent the request in the first place.<br/><br/>I created the ticket: Oct. 24th. 2006 and I received the response: May 26th. 2008<br/><br/>That is 1 1/2 year ago, the project I was working on is not longer relevant, I have the source code yes, but I cannot dig up the details of what I tried and what I did not try, back then I just read the POD and examined the code and I could not get it to work - so just for the record I created the RT.<br/><br/>I guess that due to time constraints I should just respond:<br/><br/><cite>No</cite><br/><br/>But it bothers me, that there might be a bug, which is not dealt with and perhaps this RT is just closed as irrelevant in order to <i>close 5 bugs a day</i> or something like that, I might however put too much into this since this might not be the case, but I have worked in a place where statistics got the boss high and the <i>5 a day</i> trend no matter how nice it sounds does come with a pitfall of things being closed too rapidly.<br/><br/>I just wrote a journal <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/jonasbn/journal/36615">entry</a> on a problem with test reports on old distributions and in my opinion <b>time</b> is a large part of the problem.<br/><br/>If we have bugs and issues deal with them while they are a problem and not 1 1/2 after, I would not expect many people would be ready to give you feedback on their bug reports after such a long time, they might have changed jobs, language, name... whatever, they have moved on, time goes by...<br/><br/>So if we have stuff queuing up for years and years I guess <i>5 a day</i> might be a way to <i>flush</i> things so we can move on. So perhaps this <i>5 a day</i> is not such a bad thing after all if handled responsively.<br/><br/>Which brings me to my next problem - Tests. <br/><br/>I was asked whether I had a failing test case - well I would love to have one, but testing this might not be as easy as it sound since the configuration part in Catalyst is somewhat weird. Back then I simply looked at the code after several unsuccessful attempts and since I could not locate where the problem might be, I thought I would let the more knowledgeable author examine the issue.<br/><br/>So with all this testing and stuff it has all of a sudden become the users job to carry the Burden of Proof. Would should this not be the authors job after all, he/she might now the code
better and should have test cases covering the usage scenario or at least the code statements.<br/><br/>But who am I to complain, this is open source, I could choose to fix it myself, take the time to write the test case or just get of the horse and drink my milk.
