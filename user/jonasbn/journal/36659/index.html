<div class="span8">
<p>Ok, I wanted to process the feedback I got from David Golden when he commented on my blog <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/jonasbn/journal/36580">entry</a> on a failing test report for Games::Bingo.<br/><br/>1. I just remembered that I had perhaps located an issue in the POD of my friend Claes' Javascript module also on CPAN, so I reported that first.<br/><br/><a href="http://rt.cpan.org//Ticket/Display.html?id=36659">#36659</a><br/><br/>2. So I reported the first issue to the Module::Build queue in <url:rt.cpan.org><br/><br/><a href="http://rt.cpan.org//Ticket/Display.html?id=36660">#36660</a><br/><br/>3. Then I attempted to report an issue in Pod:Html, but I was unable to find a queue by that name? <br/><br/><url:http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Dist/Display.html?Name=Pod-Html><br/><br/><quote>
	
Unable to find distribution<br/><br/>The distribution you specified, Pod-Html, could not be found. Please use the search or new ticket form at the top of the page to find the distribution's bug report page.
</quote><br/><br/>I even attempted to go to the queue via <url:http://search.cpan.org/>, but without success.<br/><br/>So I reported this to Best Practical instead using the listed email address<br/><br/>4. I jumped back to the HOME of mine in RT and then I saw that I had a reminder.<br/><br/><quote>
5.10 support - modules<br/><br/>#33759: Support for 5.10
Nobody Ã¢â¬Â¢ 12 days
</quote><br/><br/>I looked at it and it was nothing of mine...<br/><br/><url:http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=33759><br/><br/>So I reported this to Best Practical using the listed address again<br/><br/>5. I reported the pod rendering problem:<br/><br/><quote>
=item * 0
</quote><br/><br/>Using <code>perlbug</code>, this was my first bug report on Perl I think.<br/><br/>Anyway due to the issues with <url:rt.cpan.org> I was not able to report the issue with Pod::Html, so I still have one to go and with the Devel::Cover issue I <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/jonasbn/journal/36657">blogged about earlier</a>, I am almost up to my 5-a-day quota for tomorrow - if I can get those issues reported tomorrow.<br/><br/>Well anyway that should conclude my contribution to the 5-a-Day trend... hmmm something does not feel right... was I supposed to fix 5 things?

<h2>Pod-Html</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/rjbs/">rjbs</a> on 2008-06-12T02:09:10</h3>
RT queues are named after dists.  Pod::Html is not in a dist called Pod-Html, but perlbench.  I found this by searching search.cpan.org for <a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?query=pod::html" title="cpan.org">Pod::Html</a cpan.org> and then clicking the dist it found.

Hi rjbs,<br><br>You are probably right, I was looking at the distribution <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/dland/Pod-Html-1.09_04/" title="cpan.org">Pod::Html</a cpan.org> by DLAND.<br><br>This distribution does however not have an RT queue, so the queue problem is relevant. The issue related to the failing test report however should of course be filed with the correct distribution in the correct queue to have maximum effect.<br><br>perlbench was however not my first choice and it's maintainer is Gisle Aas who <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/jonasbn/journal/36657" title="perl.org">seem to show up everywhere I look</a perl.org> - what are the chances?<br><br>Judging from <a href="http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.cpan.testers/2008/06/msg1576738.html" title="perl.org">the report</a perl.org> it is hard to tell what Pod::Html we are talking about, so it requires knowledge on the inner workings.<br><br>I will report the issue to the correct queue, thanks for the help<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br>
