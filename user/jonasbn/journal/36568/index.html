<p>The team-lead of the team I am currently working as a freelancer I moving to a new position in a new company.<br/><br/>I planned to be out of office Monday and Tuesday so Friday I went to the bakeshop. The team is 6 people and we are two freelancers, one of the regulars was sick and the other freelancer was working at home, but somehow I screwed anyway.
So after careful counting <i>inside</i> my head, I ordered 8 strawberry cakes.<br/><br/>Then I went to the flower shop and bought a small beautiful cactus.<br/><br/>When I got back to the office I wrote a small letter to accompany the cactus and put it on her table. Then I picked up plates and forks for the cake. Then my mistake became obvious, we where only 6 and I bought 8 cakes - hey and I am in the technical end of the team, I am supposed to handle numbers and programming.<br/><br/>I found this quite funny - the others I think were to busy eating the cake.<br/><br/>The new manager of the team came by so we offered him cake, so I guess we are of to a good start and today he booked me to a meeting on the future collaboration, I do not know if I should bring cake and if so, how much??
