<p>I woke early before all of my family and I was wide awake right away. I jumped out of bed and started to make breakfast. The kids woke up and I got them seated and fed. I went on to pack the lunch bags for the kids and then skipped out of the door.<br/><br/>We got there early got registration set up pretty fast and mounted the video cameras in the 4 auditoriums. Everything got started, domm announced next years venue Lisbon and cog gave his 'How to get the most out of a YAPC' talk.<br/><br/>It was good to see so many familiar faces, I cannot remember any names but a few, it is so difficult when people have both real names and nicks and PAUSE ids and in addition I am bad with names.<br/><br/>The conference seems to run smoothly, apart from the WLAN, which does not cover so good in the auditoriums. We got approached by a lot of vegetarians who did not tells us they where vegetarians in advance. A lot of people also paid for a guest to the conference dinner without having a guest, so we will have some refunding to do, but that will have to be done after the conference.<br/><br/>The first day seemed to go quite well, I got home late and never made it to the Globe for the party there.<br/><br/>The Oslo.pm was handing out business cards promoting the next NPW in Oslo in April 2009, the front side had some text and the back side a picture of Larry Wall. When I got home my oldest sun showed me his pokemon cards, I told him I had a card too and showed him my Larry Wall card, so now Larry Wall is a part of his deck...
