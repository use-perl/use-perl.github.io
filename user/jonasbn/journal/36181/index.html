<p>I ran a half-marathon last Sunday, I could still feel it in my legs after two days. So I skipped the run tonight. Instead I will go running tomorrow - tomorrow is a holiday here in .dk.<br/><br/>Anyway Sunday I will have the chance to run the longest trip I have ever run: 30 km.<br/><br/>This will be the last test, so if I can run 30 kilometers I will sign up for the Copenhagen Marathon. <br/><br/>This will give me a month to get the last 12 km. into my legs.<br/><br/>I am however somewhat uneasy and concerned about the training pass Sunday. I no longer run trips shorter that 10 km. but 30 km. will be my longest trip ever and it goes well, well I will go for an even longer run.</p>

<h2>Watch out for injury</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Phred/">Phred</a> on 2008-04-17T21:04:37</h3>
<p>Your muscles may be recovered from the half marathon, but soft tissue such as in the ligaments and tendons takes a little longer to recover.  You're better off doing a little bit less than a little bit more, especially before the marathon.</p>
<p>Not to hold you back, just speaking as someone who has injured himself from pushing too hard in the past<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>



<h2>Hey dude!</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/larsgt/">larsgt</a> on 2008-04-17T21:35:08</h3>
Mind you legs. My knees gave in about the 30km point in training for Cph marathon. There is always next year<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;) Don't want to spoil you plans. Still hope you make it. Was London marathon the other day in typical British weather. Hope you get better weather if you do the Copenhagen one.<br><br>NB. Barcamb has been moved to the August 1. so I seriously thinking of comming over for YAPC::E. Is mostly doing Ruby currently but we are still largely a Perl shop. Should hopefully send a abstract your way at some point. We are desperately looking for qualified Perl people who want to move to the Cambridge area. So if you meet someone who's feed up with the 'topskat' then tell them to drop me a mail.
