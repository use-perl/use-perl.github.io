<p>Well today I have handed in my resignation. I had decided to address all my problems with my boss one more time (as written earlier in my journal), but my girlfriend talked me out of it. She had some good arguments for not addressing the problems again, since it would not do any good.<br/><br/>I will leave my current place of work by the end of february to a new carreer as freelance programmer and I have a lot of plans and ideas.<br/><br/>Thanks to all the people who have commented on my journal and the ppl on IRC - the moral support have helped me a lot.<br/><br/>Thanks,<br/><br/>jonasbn</p>

<h2>Why wait til end of month?</h2>

Sounds like a situation I faced a few months ago. Unfortunately, I gave them 4 weeks, instead of 2. Those 4 weeks were a living hell. My boss acted like a total asshole. The sad part is that I didn't need to give them 4, but someone on IRC talked me into it.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)

Unforunately I am bound for a month those are the terms under which I am employed (pretty much a standard in Denmark).<br> <br>But it is ok - I'll survive<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
