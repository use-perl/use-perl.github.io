<p>Got to the venue in time, nice to stay at a hotel close by so you do not have to go through all of town to get to the venue.<br/><br/>The beginning talks where quite ok, based on Cog's 'How to get the most out of a YAPC' I have adapted the motto: <cite>'Hi, can I buy you a beer?'</cite>.<br/><br/>I spent some time in the foyer coding and going through my articles for my presentations, I am somewhat afraid that the Micro-ISV is a bit too long, but I am doing the last presentation of the day so I think it will be ok if I use but more time.<br/><br/>I talked to acme and clkao and attempted to convince them to write an article on how to run a hack-a-thon, we have not had much success with our hack-a-thons in Copenhagen.pm<br/><br/>acme responded: <cite>'talk to clkao'</cite>, clkao responded: <cite>'I just cook and we hack'</cite><br/><br/>So I am not sure an article will come from that source, but it never hurts to ask :)<br/><br/>I had a longer talk with Ovid about fund raising for TPF, this is of course not his area, since he is <i>just</i> the grantmanager, so he only gives money out, he does not collect.<br/><br/>I attempted to explain my thoughts about setting up goals, like when <i>we</i> raised money for <i>the Damian</i>. It was fun and the whole community contributed and the game aspect was really boosting things, at least the way I saw it.<br/><br/>Unfortunately Ovid could not answer me whether this way of raising money was more or less successful than the normal way of fund raising, where you do not know exactly what you are contributing to apart from the overall good of TPF and the Perl community.<br/><br/>So my idea is to have the TPF, either set up goals either for an amount or a number of grants and then it will be up to the community to by a certain date fill in the slots. I guess having applicatans awaiting for the grant to be raised is a bad idea, since it will take out the momentum of things (or?).<br/><br/>Anyway then we can see whether we can meet the goals (and I can get a chance to get <a href="http://use.perl.org/article.pl?sid=02/06/30/2041258">the meter</a> up and running again).<br/><br/>I also talked to Ovid about the upcoming hack-a-thon in Chicago (again asking for an article), but he is not involved in the project as such and he referred to Andy Lester. So I have to contact Andy and poke him for an article.<br/><br/>So Andy if you read this, you have been warnedm, but anybody else with ideas on how to organize a hack-a-thon, I am very interested in your thoughts, ideas experiences, I attempted to write up a <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/jonasbn/journal/21823">workshop howto</a> for workshops and I miss a similar howto for hack-a-thons, but perhaps the document is useless or not necessary, because I never received any patches or feedback.

All I (where "I" means "Pete Krawczyk, half of the organizing team for YAPC::NA 2006, and I") did was:<br/><br/><ul>
<li>Find a hotel</li>
<li>Guess about how much money we'd spend on snacks and food</li>
<li>Make a spreadsheet of all the estimated costs</li>
<li>Write up a website (<a href="http://hackathon.info/" title="hackathon.info">http://hackathon.info/</a hackathon.info>)</li>
<li>Pitch the idea to the People In TPF Who Hold Purse Strings</li>
<li>Announce it</li>
</ul><br/><br/>The part about "evaluate how well it went" won't be possible until it happens.
