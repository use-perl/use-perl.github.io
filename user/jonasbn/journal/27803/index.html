<div class="span8">
<p>Around a month ago I delivered a system to a client (aftermath mentioned in my <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/jonasbn/journal/27498">journal</a>).<br/><br/>They contacted me yesterday about a bug in the system, so I had a brief look at it and started thinking about what the problem could be.<br/><br/>I mailed them that I would not be able to look at it before today ( I am quite busy with other things).<br/><br/>So today a took a copy of their database, replicated the problem - and started to fix it - after about 5 hours of work, debugging and programming the bug was fixed to my understanding - so I made a PDF print and mailed it to the client explaining the fix and awaiting their acceptance. In the mail I included my price for the fix.<br/><br/>No long time after I received a mail addressing that the fix had a cost.<br/><br/>I find it difficult to assert when a bug fix should be free and when it should cost something - the client terminated their contract with me after the delivery of the complete system and the system went live about a month ago.<br/><br/>The client tells me that this is not the normal way and that the bug is an obvious bug.<br/><br/>I can accept and fix bugreports, made just after a delivery, perhaps for up to two weeks after, but I have no intention of delivering lifetime support for free.<br/><br/>The fix is a part of the system, which has no value as such to me currently since it is a part of the system, which was custom built for the client and it will not be generalized until I find the time to do so (or a another client to pay for it). This mean it will not generate any income for me by other means.<br/><br/>So I was thinking about making a policy for bugfixes and a special price, like first two weeks it is free and the price for bugfixes after this has a special low-rate.<br/><br/>But I see a few problems with this, then all bugs have to be discussed with the client whether that where in the spec, or not . whether they are a bug or a missing feature.

<h2>Or you could...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/cog/">cog</a> on 2005-11-30T17:59:37</h3>
Another possibility would be to include a pack of X-hours of maintenance/bug-fixing with the solution. I've seen it done a bunch of times and I think it works rather well.<br><br>All you have to concern about is to make sure the client understands the different between fixing a bug and developing new functionality<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)



<h2>Sign Off</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/tomhukins/">tomhukins</a> on 2005-12-01T01:40:50</h3>
<p>
I don't deal with the financial aspects of my job, but I work closely with people who do.  I'd suggest you define what sign off means more clearly:  you say you "delivered a system".  For me, that means they accepted what you produced.
</p>

<p>
But do you have legal proof that they did?
</p>

<p>
I expect software developers to work with their clients to define acceptance criteria.  If this doesn't happen, anyone might end up dealing with the repercussions.
</p>

<p>
It's tough pulling together the legal resources to deal with a large company, but in my experience all such relationships share similar traits:  precise contracts matter because they define relationships.  Large companies need precision because they employ lots of people, often in undefined roles.
</p>

<p>
Decide what you want to achieve beforehand.  Define the technical criteria that matter to your client.  Then deliver.
</p>

<p>
Always allow your client to change their requirements, but explain the implications of this.
