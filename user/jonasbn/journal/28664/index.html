<p>I reinstalled Tiger on my new <i>favorite waste of time</i> sunday evening. After ended installation I was able to put the PB to sleep and it has been running ok since.<br/><br/>I am have started to reestablish everything, still lot of work to do before it starts to resemble my old TiBook - I have not been reading my private email for about a week or so and apparently a lot of people use this email address to get a hold of me, so I am going through the email and writing a TODO list, together with my unfinished TODO list from last week I have quite a list to work through today.<br/><br/>I am still a bit anxious about the machine and I have NOT updated to the lastest release of Tiger, right now I need to focus on work, then I can worry about not being up to date later on.<br/><br/>Perhaps I should have run some more tests on the machine, such as installing the Tiger updates sequentially to see whether it was one of these who break the sleep functionallity, then again, I do not really have the time and it is really not my task to do so and I simply have too much to do, to spend more time on this. <br/><br/>So for those of you interested I am currently running: Mac OS X 10.4.2 (8E45) and sleep works :)</p>
