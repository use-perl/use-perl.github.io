<p>I have just seriously burned my fingers on a small project.<br/><br/>Currently I am in the phase of finding out what the problem actually is.<br/><br/>The project was a small shopping website to a client, which daily works with graphics and layout.<br/><br/>We implemented the project in PHP as a plugin to our CMS solution also in PHP. We spent a lot of time getting the layout to look like the drafts we had received, but the primary focus was on the functionality of the shop and payment.<br/><br/>So now we have used the budgetted number of hours (and then some) and we have a working solution, which holds layout, which is ok (if you ask me).<br/><br/>But the client is not satisfied with the layout? and I guess there can be several hours of layout work left to get the last pixels correct in different browsers.<br/><br/>So what is the problem with small projects:
<ul>
<li>Our estimates are bad and wrong? (this introduces the problem of competitive prices)
<li>Layout heavy/focussed projects have differing client focus? (we tend to focus on functionality)
<li>Small projects do not have as much slack as larger projects?
</ul><br/><br/>I have done some reflection of the above and I think these are some of the things in need of being addressed are:
<ul>
<li>Better estimates (no caring about competition if this can be afforded
<li>Get help to deal with layout by professionals
<li>Choose larger projects over smaller ones (we already do this)
</ul></p>
