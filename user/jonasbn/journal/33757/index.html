<div class="span8">
<p>I just received the physical edition of Dr. Dobbs, just in time for the weekend. This meant I actually could take time to read some of it.<br/><br/>I feel over one of the first articles and dug in, I skipped the editorial. I have however come to enjoy editorials since they sometimes are good at providing an overview of something which often sound completely uninteresting, to me.<br/><br/>Anyway I read the article 'Are You Immune to Test Infection' which was on developer testing. The author addresses the lack of the developer testing embrace.<br/><br/>He states that the future of developer testing can have 3 outcomes:<br/><br/><ul> <li type="1">Long-term defeat, developer testing dies <li type="1">Small victory, used be certain groups and organizations <li type="1">Major victory, developer testing becomes a standard practice </ul><br/><br/>How he expect this outcome to manifest itself and when is somewhat unclear.<br/><br/>So I read the article a sort of call to arms.<br/><br/>He described the problem as being rooted in the developers - and I agree to some extent. He then go on to dividing the developers into 3 groups, based on <i>genetics</i>, outlining 3 developer profiles and their respective possible adaptation of developer test.<br/><br/><ul> <li>T1 gene - developers which embrace developer testing <li>T2 gene - developers which embrace developer testing with some time and encouragement <li>T3 gene - developers immune to developer testing </ul><br/><br/>For one I do not like the <i>gene</i> analogy, I am no biologist and eventhough genes might have something to say. I see the test adaption very much as a cultural problem.<br/><br/>The author makes an important point of managers and senior developers should use their influcence to get developer testing applied in their organizations, when climbing the career ladders.<br/><br/>I think this is good, formal requirements for developer testing is good.<br/><br/>But - I need to wrap this up.<br/><br/>I do not regard developer testing as a on-going revolution, developer testing has existed for a long time. With unit-testing and practices like test first development and the whole agile movement, developer testing has gotten a wider audience and much focus, all good things, but people have tested software since the first program was written.<br/><br/>Developer testing is here to stay and I believe in a state, that could translate to the author's 'small victory' - yes we have a lot of stubborn organizations, managers etc. who do not see the benefits of developer testing - and we have a lot of developers, who do not use developer testing.  But this does not necessarily make them bad programmers.<br/><br/>Developer testing is good, we can agree on that, but sometimes you are in a situation where developer testing simply is not possible due to time/budget constraints or other circumstances.<br/><br/>The practices of software development mostly live in a sphere where it is under control from some other dynamics, primarily the dynamics of market economy. Economic analysis of developer testing, will probably fall out to the benefit of developer testing in the long run, but sometimes we are in situations where TTM is more important and ROI is rooted in the TTM so JFDI is the way to go.<br/><br/>To get back to the 'Small Victory'. I imagine that developers are using developer testing when and where feasible based on many perspectives and personal judgment.<br/><br/>Perhaps not even controlled by managers, budgets or deadlines - but whether the developer in question has the time and overview to tackle the task/project at hand using developer testing as a practice.<br/><br/>I use developer testing with my CPAN modules. There are no budgets, no deadlines and I can take my time to do this sort of work.<br/><br/>I use developer testing on client projects to the extent feasible, it is not a formal requirement so it is very much up to me to adapt to the assignment, so I use developer testing for my own benefit, economically and professionally.<br/><br/>I only use developer testing in bug-fixing when I have the time and often bugs are fixed and changes applied in a more <i>hackish</i> manner, because JFDI is the way to go.<br/><br/>I would love to invite the author for a visit to the Perl community, I am sure he we would be impressed over a <i>hacker</i> community like this, which use developer testing in to an extend that would wet the pants on these test evangelists.<br/><br/>And I very much regard the Perl Community as a pragmatically driven group, that simply live by the mantra TIMTOWTDI.<br/><br/>One last word on the article; if you want to sell something, even an idea, do NOT compare it to a disease, no matter how good the resemblance is.

<p><blockquote> <div><p>sometimes you are in a situation where developer testing simply is not possible due to time/budget constraints or other circumstances.</p></div> </blockquote>

<p>This is self-contradictory &#8211; the more critical and time-constrained a project, the more important good tests are! If you are short on time, you cannot afford to waste time debugging, and a habitual testing culture will massively reduce the time it takes you to narrow down problems.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s kinda like saying &#8220;we don&#8217;t have time to make backups.&#8221; Boy are you going to regret that if anything goes wrong. The risk situation with tests is unfortunately different, because failure to write any one test will not result in catastrophy, but unlike with with backups where you can go lucky for years, you <em>will</em> run into a problem that could have been avoided by writing tests. And another such problem. And another. And another. Ad nauseum.</p>

<p>Which is exactly the sort of risk structure that human brains fail to evaluate properly. (Cf. fears about aerial terrorism vs traffic accidents.)</p>

<p>You cannot afford <em>not</em> to write tests!</p>

<p>First off, I agree. My only concern is that the "client" might not put that together and wonder why you aren't cranking out "code".</p>

I agree, and do not get me wrong I do developer testing myself.<br><br>This however, in my opinion, is something which is culturally controlled. I must sometimes change context in terms of culture an adapt to client expectations, budget and other constraints, since I work as a freelancer. Many of my clients have no idea what software development is, so either they buy the idea or they shun the idea (often the latter judging from budget).<br><br>And yes I regret this every time.<br><br>Working as a freelancer, coming from a corporate development culture where there was space for unit-testing have taught me something else. When I started out I attempted to adapt corporate development culture (the good things) to my projects, but lets just say, the clients where not ready, some of them where not even ready to get development done in the first place and should have stuck to Excel or whatever they had before. Corporate development is a luxurious world compared to freelancing for small companies.<br><br>I have surpassed my share of deadlines and paid the price also financially - so today I do developer testing when there is room for it in sense of budget and time. I always make room for it in my estimates and with my estimates improving I get to do more developer testing in the projects I do.<br><br>Unfortunately I sometimes get caught in a situation where I have to do more projects in parallel then there is not much time left for doing developer testing - and when I outsource I do not always have the time to learn the resource how to do developer testing.<br><br>Often I get a product, back where I then have to look into developer testing, something I do not always have time for and there was a reason I outsourced it in the first place.<br><br>I also get assignments with corporations, but when you are hired in as a freelancer you are sometimes assigned to projects, which are run in departments that are under severe constraints and therefore the development culture does not have room for best practices, so you do the best you can with time given.<br><br>I still think of myself as new in this business and I can feel that things are improving, with everything from client relations, to estimating and coding using good practices, so perhaps in a few years perhaps I can afford the luxury of declining clients not ready to pay for proper development, not hire resources which do not do developer testing and code using best practices, but until then I must have pragmatic approach to developer testing and some of the other good practices, but believe me I am very much aware of this fact.<br><br>So yes, I think it something we should afford, instead of paying the penalty later.<br><br>Comparing developer testing to backup is a bit drastic in my opinion.

<p>Actually it&#8217;s exactly what I was talking about.</p>

<p>Yes, failing to make backups is a huge mistake. It results in a huge catastrophe at some point.</p>

<p>It may <em>seem</em> drastic to compare tests with it, but it&#8217;s not. The difference is simply that instead of a single big catastrophe you get many small setbacks. You waste a lot of time at a later stage of the project that you could have saved by going more slowly in the beginning. &#8220;Give me six hours to chop down a tree and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe,&#8221; Abraham Lincoln supposedly said.</p>

<p>I appreciate that clients do not understand that testing is important and why; but in my opinion, that merely means you make room for it in the estimation without telling them about it. You are supposed to be a professional; that means you are supposed to know what it takes to deliver quality work, and your professional judgement is what you get paid for. If the client&#8217;s judgement of your activity is poor, part of your job is not to let them interfere with &#8211; just like a carpenter would make a big fuss if you told him to use some of your own old office glue instead of the proper wood adhesive from his materials, because it&#8217;s cheaper. He may do it if you insist long enough, of course, but he&#8217;ll warn you loudly and at length about the poor quality of work you are forcing him to deliver. It&#8217;s his <em>job</em> to have better judgement than you.</p>

<p>So I see it with software professionals: don&#8217;t give the client choices that the client is not educated to make wisely. It&#8217;s your job to make the right choices for him to the extent that you can. Anything else is irresponsible. You said it yourself: you regret it every time.</p>

<p>(NB.: this is not criticism. I am trying to provide another angle to look at the matter.)</p>

I do in no way take this is a criticism<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br><br>Since what we are discussion are founded in matters of opinion and I rather enjoy discussing the topic.<br><br>Anyway I am going to have you have the last word, since your argument is very sensible and reasonable and I agree.<br><br>You actually used an argument I always use, when talking about whether you should be working on some semi-configured workstation provided by a client, instead of your own.<br><br>I always argue that you do no require either the plumber or carpenter to use your toolbox when they show up on site.<br><br>Thank you for commenting, I will attempt to be more professional in the future and let developer testing be a part of the work package every time.<br><br>It will take some time before this practice will be fully adopted, but being aware of this, can only help - and in the end quality will also improve. For the happiness of both client and developer.

<p>Yes, exactly. We&#8217;re fully in agreement.</p>

<p>And I know &#8211; it&#8217;s not going to be easy. But software development is in a terrible state right now, with hardly any projects finishing in the estimated time and budget and with satisfactory deliverables, and that won&#8217;t improve unless we as practicioners make conscious and conscientous efforts to change the situation.</p>

<p>Therefore: onward ho.<nobr> <wbr></nobr><tt>:-)</tt> </p>
