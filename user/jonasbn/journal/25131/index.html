<p>We are attempting to arrange a Perl event in Copenhagen (next week) called PerlDag (PerlDay), you can see more at: <a href="http://www.perldag.dk/2005">http://www.perldag.dk/2005</a> due to the postponing of the Nordic Perl Workshop.<br/><br/>The event is a week away and we do not have enough papers to fill in the slots we need, so I have been mailing high and low to get some more talks.<br/><br/>We have a lot of people who have indicated interest in participating and we have the sponsors we need, it bothers me that what might kill the event is a lack of technical content.<br/><br/>We attempted to annouce this event on use.perl quite some time ago, but it is still pending. This would probably not have any influence on the number of papers/talks, but I am disappointed that use.perl, which is kind of the bulletin board of the Perl community is not addressing our story, if it should not be approved then disapprove it - just make a decision.</p>

<p>Comments made on IRC suggest that there have been some technincal problems with stories getting lost in the submission queue, but I think this is only part of the problem. I infer that the main problem is that the existing use.perl editors are busy people with too many other projects, and don't have the time to pay attention to <a href="http://use.perl.org/submit.pl?op=list" title="perl.org">the story submission queue</a perl.org>. use.perl needs active editors, which presumably means it needs to add some new editors. Otherwise we remain in the current daft situation where a parrot release announcement can sit on the queue for days.</p>

<p>Sounds reasonable.  Anybody know how editors get added?</p>

We recored the talks auf Autrijus, Chip and Leo at the Austrian Perl Workshop. I haven't looked at it yet so I can say nothing about the kwalite^wquality of the recordings. But if you're interested (and desperate<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-) I can send them to you and you can show them...

I have room to host if that's all you're looking for (although I'd want to ping each speaker first to be sure they were ok with that).<br> <br>-matt

Oh, I'm offering it to the world...<br> <br>Asking the speakers for permission is a good idea<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br> <br>Before finding a place to host them I'll have to convert the files a bit etc. I should also watch them to check the quality.<br> <br>WRT hosting, I'll think I put them on the Vienna.pm site. But if you can provide a mirror that would be cool!

I recall speaking to someone about some ad-hoc event, but I can't recall who now.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:(
<p>
I'm in town for <a href="http://geekcruises.com/itinerary/bb01_itinerary.htm" title="geekcruises.com">MacMania 3.5</a geekcruises.com>, and will overnight both the night before and after the cruise, to better coordinate my international flights.
</p> <p>
Oh, and if anyone knows the best way to kill 6 hours at CGD, please let me know!  I've got a sad layover.</p>
