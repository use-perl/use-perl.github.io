<p>I am WAY behind on a project I have been working on for a long time. The project is one of those, where you are not being paid, but you hope that the money will come in some day in the future. My partner on this feeds me plenty of other tasks and understand why we have do not have much progress - but anyway it would be nice get the first version finished.<br/><br/>At the same time I involved myself in a similar project with another partner, luckily in this project the partner entered with development resources aswell - so things here are behind but not as much as for the first project.<br/><br/>In general running projects like these are difficult, the two
projects have external interests, meaning that also requirements are set, not necessarily technical, but time-wise and this mean that there is a chance that the project in question conflict with other tasks/projects.<br/><br/>The challenge is to find a balance between projects, which get food and the table and those who do not.<br/><br/>I hope the growth and improvement of the codebase in my company future projects will become easier to develop, even though it seems a lot like Sisyfos work right now.</p>
