<p>Day 2 had no registration so things just started smoothly and continued all day quite smoothly.<br/><br/>tagg and I got invited to a YEF meeting and I signed up to the PR committee, I will write some more about this when I find out what it is all going to be about, I have plenty of ideas, but I better wait.<br/><br/>The conference dinner was to take place, so we had a lot of questions on how to get there. We had put the information in the Wiki, but all organizers and later helpful attendees did a lot of map pointing.<br/><br/>We tried to explain to the attendees that they should go via the metro, but not at a time since the metro here in Copenhagen is quite small. I went to pick up my wife and when I got to the restaurant, a lot of people was there and the party seemed to be on.<br/><br/>I got to talk to a lot of people and most people seemed to enjoy themselves.<br/><br/>I left a little early to be ready for the following day</p>
