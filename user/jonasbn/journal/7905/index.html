<div class="span8">
<p>The time is 04:14 AM and we are in the train heading home from MÃÂ¼nich at
the YAPC::Europe conference.<br/><br/>The conference has been a good experience socially and Perl-wise for me
and I guess the rest of the Copenhagen Perl Mongers.<br/><br/>	- I have gotten ideas for a few new modules
	- I have signed up as a smoke tester for perl5
	- I have restarted and had a little progress in some of my older projects
	
So all in all the confenrence has been a good catalyst.<br/><br/>I consider myself very open and I get to talk to alot of people, but I
hate the vacuum which arises at a conference when the day is over and
all the presentations have been made.<br/><br/>The lack of social events have inspired me to think about starting the
pm4p (Perl Modules 4 the People) group internally within the Perl
community, which should be an sub division in the Perl community acting
during YAPC's for people not being speakers and P5Ps and should be
capable of arranging more socially oriented events to strengthen the
network between ordinary Perl users and developers.<br/><br/>I do not think this should be tthat hard, since all there is to should
be to arrange a restaurent, bar or cafe, where people can meet up at the
end of a conference day.<br/><br/>So for the next YAPC::Europe I will try to present the concept of pm4p
for the rest of us.<br/><br/>The variety of subjects which are dealt with at a conference like
YAPC::Europe have ensured me that I could be a possible speaker and when
the next YAPC::Europe is getting close I think I will submit an
abstract, what the topic will be is not known by now, but I can think of
many thinks which could be possible topics for talks. So for the next
YAPC::Europe an abstract will be made for when the call for papers is
issued.<br/><br/>The discussion have been going on internally in the cph.pm, whether we
could host a YAPC::Europe venue sometime in the future and I think we
all agree on that it would both be fun and possible to do so, but we are
probably not ready just yet as a PM.<br/><br/>So cph.pm will in the near future possible work on some of our other
common projects, like our YAS donation project (the 'Cod-a-thon') and
other things such as a more active profile at the LinuxForum in
Copenhagen, which could prove to be a very good training in both hosting
YAPC::Europe and speaking at a conference. At last years LinuxForum, CPH.PM 
were only represented as a BOF, which is far from what should be the goal of 
what CPH.PM should and could do.<br/><br/>Anyway I am personlly keen on going to the YAPC::Europe next year, whereever 
it is going to be held (Paris?).</p>
