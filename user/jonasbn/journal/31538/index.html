<p>I just received a 23" Apple Cinema screen, it is really really nice. I am going to use it when working with one of my clients, where I am doing a lot of work - I have a contract to the end of the year for now, but they are quite interested in my webshop software and of course they will be busy next year aswell so expect more assignments.<br/><br/>When ordering the Cinema screen I also ordered a keyboard and this is where I screwed up - I ordered a Belgian keyboard, I have absolutely no idea how this looks, I like belgian wafles, belgian chocolate and belgian beer and the belgians seem like nice people, At least the one(s) I have met at YAPC::Europe conferences.<br/><br/>Anyway I called apple and they agreed to take the keyboard back, then even seemed to have a process for this so things ran quite smooth, they would order a new keyboard for me and everything seemed ok.<br/><br/>But the swedish guy I talked to might have misunderstood me, so later the same day I received a receipt for yet another Belgian keyboard - so I mailed him and I called the hotline again.<br/><br/>This time I talked to a guy who sounded irish, he promised me to look into it and he would call me back. I still have not heard anything - but I have received yet another receipt for a Belgian keyboard. If only this where beer, chocolate or something useful to me...<br/><br/>So I wonder what tomorrow brings I am going out of town on business for a couple of days, perhaps my desk will be drowned in Belgian keyboards when I return. </p>

The 23" ACD totally rocks. I love mine. There are a lot cheaper monitors, but I swear it has one of the best color displays I've ever seen.<br><br>At least you got yours cheap. I bought mine when it cost 3x as much.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-/
