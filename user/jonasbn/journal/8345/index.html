<p>We have now release first version of our new website - from a visitor perspective not much have changed, apart from a few links and some funky new dynamic colouring.<br/><br/>The system opens up for a lot of things and the number of features we need to make mean that we will have a lot of Perl coding to do in the future, which is good.<br/><br/>The system we have built is not among beyond the scope of our own ranks, but it is available from our CVS server and the system can be seen in use on our <a href="http://cph.pm.org">website</a>.<br/><br/>Now reminds to get the system fully running and extending our website (which was why we made the change in the first place) and we need to evaluate the Code-a-thon working method, to find out whether this method can be used for other of our projects.<br/><br/>The experience of working on a project, which is not  job related is really special and can only be recommended. I really feel that the Copenhagen Perl Mongers by now really have something in common and we have something apart from our common Perl interest that binds us together.<br/><br/>I think that that particular experience could and should be used by some of the professional project managers and other managers in our business - they often underestimate the interest people have in their job and its content and the best kind of team-building they can do instead of arranging all kinds of team-building events they should instead let people work together and spend the money on something which adds value to the normal working day.<br/><br/>But anyway, the Copenhagen Perl Mongers group have really become much strengthened throughout the last year and I am looking forward to the next year, meetings to come, YAPC::Europe 2003 and whatever the IRC channel and these funny people might bring me in the future.<br/><br/>I will come back later to the Code-a-thon etc. but this will have to do for now - cause I am dead tired.</p>
