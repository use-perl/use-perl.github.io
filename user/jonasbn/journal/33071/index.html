<p>Due to the birth of my second son my running schedule, somewhat screwed up. I was however able to take a few trips, but my goals where not met.<br/><br/>Things are settling now, still not as structured as before with running every second day in the morning prior to going to work. I do get out a run almost every second day, but when there is a slot. I was able to run a 10 km. trip this Saturday and I even kept my pace under 5 min./km.<br/><br/>My weight has even start to reduce, slowly, but I have lost 2-3 kg. Which is not much when you aim for 10-12, but it is a beginning. Perhaps eating some more healthy food can help out, until now I have not changed my diet, food seems to be the only luxury I have left :)<br/><br/>I plan to set some a goal from the 1st. of May. I still need to complete 100 km. in a month. May must be the month.
