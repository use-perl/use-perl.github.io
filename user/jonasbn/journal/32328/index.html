<p>Wrote some more potential speakers today. I have selected these people for their presentations and involvement in the past or their contributions in the last few years and whether they have spoken at NPW before.<br/><br/>We do in no way want to leave anybody out, but we have limited funds and I am not sure of how many of these people will respond positively and how many of the sponsors will respond positively.<br/><br/>Anyway if just some of these people come we will have an impressive line up.<br/><br/>We received the first paper today, one I did not see coming, so it was a welcome surprise... I hope we will get more papers this way, so everything do not get too arranged. The top controlled aspect is for our government not our workshop.<br/><br/>Man I have met so many funny, cool and sweet people I consider inviting them all, but I guess I will have to settle for the way we are doing it now, after all there are 3 European workshops within the next 3 months.<br/><br/>We have gotten some positive feedback, I hope I will be able to find out whether a third batch is necessary within the next few weeks.<br/><br/>We have set up a schedule of 30 minute talks so we need between 24 and 28 talks. We can adjust the schedule to accommodate the actual number, but for now this is what we are aiming at.  </p>
