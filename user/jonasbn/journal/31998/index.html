<p>ok, ok, I treated myself to another pre-christmas present.<br/><br/>I have been meaning to get started running again all of december, so yesterday I bought a new pair of running shoes, Nike+ and the kit adaptor for the iPod Nano, but my sister does, so I borrowed hers.<br/><br/>When I got home I was anxious to try it out so I took the shoes for a <i>spin</i>.<br/><br/>The trip was not long, but I have not been running for a long time. I have actually only been gaining weight and bodymass, so it was not my most athletic performance and the iPod was teasing me a bit. I am not really intimate with the iPod interface, so the wheel gave me some <i>beginners trouble</i>, but I got it running at the right volume and the rest of the trip went smoothly.<br/><br/>When I got home I plugged the Nano into my MacBook Pro and it asked whether I wanted to create a Nike account. It opened a browser and a flash thing started up with a lot of fields but no labels, so I could not see what I was supposed to enter where, after a few attempts with the same result, I pointed the browser to the Nike site (http://www.nike.com/nikeplus/), clicked create account - and bingo it worked out.<br/><br/>The data got sent to the site when I then authenticated from iTunes and I could see that the trip had been divided into two trips (my own fault), but the first was not even 200 m, I just erased it - so these are the stats from my first test run:<br/><br/><cite>3.47 km in 19 minutes and 35 seconds</cite> <br/><br/>I have scheduled my next run for tomorrow, before we leave for Bornholm and I expect a more smooth trip, perhaps not faster, I guess there is a long way and a lot of sweat to getting faster :)<br/><br/>Apart from the minor problem with the direct registration, I am quite impressed with the gear, the shoes are magnificent.</p>
