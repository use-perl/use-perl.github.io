<p>We (defekt, tagg and I) got to Birmingham tuesday morning, it was nice for a change to have some time to look at the host city. Wednesday the conference starts and we will not have time to see much.<br/><br/>So after checking in to the hotel we went for lunch (and something to eat), so we ate at some fancy cafe and then we went out to locate a pub. We walked by the canal, which I think is the most beautifyl part of Birmingham of the parts I have seen so far and we found a nice local pub where we could sit inside and look at the rain, our timing was just perfect since we did not get caught in the showers.<br/><br/>When it cleared again we went back to the hotel and coded a bit, I attempted to share the ethernet Internet connection from my MacBook, but with limited success, the other guys just had no bandwidth.<br/><br/>I read an article, in the very thin september issue of Dr. Dobbs, by Ivar Jacobsson on software development process. I feel asleep just after, so when I referenced the article in the elevator to the other guys later I was not sure whether my reflections on the article was article content or stuff I dreamt up, anyhow I have to re-read the article at some point.<br/><br/>We went to the designated place for pre-registration, a lot of people showed up and I saw a lot of familiar faces, by now with these YAPC::Europes events they feel more and more like <i>family</i> reunions, apart from the amount of crazy uncles are much higher than normal.<br/><br/>After pizza and beer we went back to the hotel and to sleep, no need to stretch it on day 0, since it will be a long week.</p>
