<p>I have been really busy the last few weeks. PHP programming is filling most of my life - I have been bugtracking and bugfixing an existing solution. This has been quite tough, especially because the end-client, do not really understand what we where trying to tell him.<br/><br/>We attempted to get the communication to go through the project-manager (the guy who hired me), but a constant bombardment of error reports of varying quality completely drowned everything aswell as threats and generally hostile messages, which just really <i>motivated</i> me to continue fixing bugs.<br/><br/>The end-client terminated the project a few days back, somehow this felt as a great relief and perhaps I can focus on some of my other customers, with whom dialogue and planning is much easier.<br/><br/>I succeeded in squeesing in a BoF on Perl programming at an <a href="http://bof.linuxforum.dk/bofs/perl">event</a> organized by the people behind <a href="http://www.linuxforum.dk/">LinuxForum</a> in Denmark. I attempted not to get to technical about it and showed of some of the cool features of Perl. I had originally planned on talking about 'Whipupability' and some of the cool cornerstone modules, but I ran out of time and instead I presented some of the solutions I have implemented as a freelancer, solution making use of WWW::Mechanize, XML::Simple, Spreadsheet::Excel etc.<br/><br/>I think the presentation went quite well, the audience seemed like Perl newbies, so I just showed highlights and gave them an idea of some of the things Perl can accomplish in very few lines. </p>

<h2>Encore?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/tagg/">tagg</a> on 2004-11-11T11:12:49</h3>
Maybe you would consider a repeat performace at a cph.pm tech meet? It would at least allow you to get a bit more technical.



<h2>Too Basic</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jonasbn/">jonasbn</a> on 2004-11-12T12:32:26</h3>
I think the material is too basic for the Copenhagen Perl Mongers crowd, then the meeting you should be held in order to attract new people?
