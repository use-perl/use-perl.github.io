<p>I am back in Copenhagen getting ready to go to work. My holiday was great. I almosy finished Games::Bingo. I ran into a design flaw, meaning I had to redo some stuff, it was I minor setback but a great learning experience trying to make a workaround.<br/><br/>I finished reading Steve McConnells 'Software Project Survival Guide'. I started reading the 'The Wiki Way', by Bo Leuf and Ward Cunningham. I learned just before I left that wikis are great as documentation systems and the more look into it the more I am convinced that it is true, good think I brought the book. The book is ok, it is not fantastic - I bought it during my XP frenzy-period and I always thought it was a bad buy, but now I think I can put it to use.<br/><br/>I have almost finished one of my proposed presentations for the Scandinavian Perl Workshop, now I just need to write the abstract for the presentation on software testing.<br/><br/>On the plane home I wrote an article on CamelBones development, I am going to use it as an abstract for SPW. Maybe I will send it to O'Reillynet or something, lets see when it is finished.<br/><br/>I am still considering sending some papers to YAPC::E, the deadline is not until 1st. of may so I will wait until after the SPW to see whether it is a good idea.</p>
