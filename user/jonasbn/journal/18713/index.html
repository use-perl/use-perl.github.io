<p>In this <a href=" http://www.infoworld.com/article/04/05/07/19FEtoptools_1.html">article</a> listing a top 10 of tools, Perl is rated #1.<br/><br/>Some of the other tools in the article are a bit wierd, but I guess all would have their own personal top 10 of favorite tools.<br/><br/>I think mine (just of the top of my head) would look something like:<br/><br/>1. Perl
2. Terminal.app or xterm
3. BBEdit
4. Vim
5. grep (and variations) 
6. find
7. xargs
8. bash
9. telnet
10. OS X<br/><br/>The list might look different tomorrow</p>

<h2>My tools</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jdavidb/">jdavidb</a> on 2004-05-12T18:27:47</h3>
<p>I wouldn't have ordinarily considered the terminal a tool; to me it's more like air.  Gotta have it to work.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<p>I'm kind of surprised to think of what I would list as my most important tools today.  If you'd told me this a few years back I never would have guessed it.</p>

<ol>
<li>Perl (of course)</li>
<li>Cygwin</li>
<li>Cygwin XFree86</li>
<li>ssh</li>
<li>vim (I tried to convert to Emacs in 2002 but got distracted when I was laid off)</li>
<li>CVS (only recently have I finally become an avid CVS user, despite plans to do so for four years</li>
<li>a spreadsheet program; I deliberately cite this generically, even though I am currently using the most popular proprietary spreadsheet package, because to me they are all the same</li>
</ol>

<p>Just for fun, I typed:</p><blockquote><div> <tt>history | awk '{print $2}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -n</tt> </div></blockquote>on the system I use most and found the following (excerpted):

<ul>
<li>8 du</li>
<li>10 rm</li>
<li>14 more</li>
<li>23 perl5.6.1 (I always type the version number because of systems I've been on where I had to use multiple versions; yes, it stinks that I'm using 5.6.1; it's not by choice)</li>
<li>24 su</li>
<li>26 grep</li>
<li>27 sqlplus</li>
<li>38 ls</li>
<li>44 cd (that's not a tool; it's a shell builtin<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) )</li>
<li>69 cvs</li>
<li>93 vi</li>
</ul>

<p>It was interesting to me, at any rate.  vi is vim, of course.  I wasn't surprised to see it and cvs come out on top.</p>

I was using this...

<p> <code>cat<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.bash_history|perl -ne 'm/^[a-z]+/&amp;&amp;$_{$&amp;}++&amp;&amp;$t++}for(sort{$_{$a}$_{$b}}keys%_){$c++;print  sprintf"$_\t$_{$_}\t%2.2f%\n",($_{$_}*100/$t)'</code></p>

Until tool number 6, I can guess what your daily work deals with, but when you cite spreadsheets, I don't have ideas about how you use them. I am always interested in ways to increase productivity and limit efforts: what do you use spreadsheets for?

<p>Heh.  Mostly for reporting my todo list and status to my boss.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)  But also as an output format for my users and stuff like that.  To be honest, I don't personally use them for much that could be described as technical.</p>

<p>Reviewing my tool list, it also doesn't show the large usage of Oracle.</p>

screen<br> <br>Once you get used to it, it too is "like air".<br>
