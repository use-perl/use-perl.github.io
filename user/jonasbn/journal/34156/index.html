<p>Apparently I am slowly evolving rather excentric quirks. The other day I was active on #YAPC, the general YAPC channel on IRC. Here I overheard a conversation between a speaker for the upcoming YAPC::Europe in Vienna and another user on the channel.<br/><br/>Apparently the speaker could not get his employer to pay for his travel to Vienna to attend and speak at the conference.<br/><br/>I have organized several workshops and I know what trouble it can be too miss a speaker this close to the event - of course you will survive, but this particular speaker, whom I have met at a previous YAPC::Europe, is a nice guy. His contributions to CPAN and the community are invaluable and him going is a good thing, since it will get him exposed to the community and as I have written before I regard this exposure as very important and a big asset of the Perl community.<br/><br/>Since I am not going myself and I was in a particularly good mood, I made a fast decision.<br/><br/>So I inquired whether he wanted a sponsor to cover for his travel expenses and after some talking back and forth - we agreed that I, eh my company, well my company is me anyway, would sponsor his travel.<br/><br/>So in respect to this year's theme of YAPC::Europe, "Social Perl", I have contributed without even going.<br/><br/>And now somebody owes me a beer :)</p>

No I have to skip this year, unfortunately the situation at $HOME is still somewhat unstable.<br><br>2 boys under 3 years old can really keep you busy.<br><br>But I will be back - I promise!
