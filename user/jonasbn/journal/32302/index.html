<div class="span8">
<p>I am currently in the process of setting up a new company together with a fellow Perl Monger and a client.<br/><br/>The formalities is almost in place, this change from being a one-man company to being part of a team again is quite nice.<br/><br/>In order to kick it off we have adopted several of Googles available services, such as <a href="http://www.google.com/calendar/">Calendar</a> and <a href="http://docs.google.com/">Docs and Spreadsheets</a>.<br/><br/>We have regular meetings, we write minutes of meetings, share them via google and last week we scheduled a pilot project to experiment with certain aspects of catalyst. So we outlined 8 deliverables, indicating 8 tasks set the time frame and then got going.<br/><br/>This way of working is more the way I would like to go and working in a team is really fruitfull, the problem is that we want to conquer the world from the beginning and we do not have the time since we are all engaged in other activities, so until the first big project arives we make small interations and attempt to get our processes and ideas streamlined.<br/><br/>So while working for other clients, we attempting to get this new business going and trying to get some of our existing clients to see the potential of the new business. The new business will focus on what we already do softwarewise, but not the consultancy part, so we are aiming at getting some of our existing migrated into the new setup.<br/><br/>I will probably journal more about this in the future...</p>

I work on some projects in a similar manner and I've also found <a href="http://hiveminder.com/" title="hiveminder.com">Hiveminder</a hiveminder.com> to be useful. You can have your own tasks and you can set up groups that you can all see and manage tasks in.

I thought about hiveminder and I think it will be cool for mapping our task cards onto eventhough I <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/jonasbn/journal/31938" title="perl.org">worked hard</a perl.org> to put up the boards to hold them.<br><br>Thanks for reminding me<br>
