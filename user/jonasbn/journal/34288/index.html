<p>In this ongoing project I am participating I was asked to brief the technical resource representing the department we are working for.<br/><br/>This guy is a fellow Perl monger, a very good friend and a former colleague.<br/><br/>I gave him a break down. After some discussion. We got to one of the critical part of the work package I had not put much effort into - I had just assumed it would sort of work as usual. I had been meaning to discuss it with him, but we just never seemed to have the time.<br/><br/>We had to get a few things nailed down, these belonged to another system so we called in another colleague, also a friend of mine and former colleague, after some discussion we had got things aligned and I stood with clarifications but also some issues I need to address with the project manager and other participants at the next status meeting.<br/><br/>I <i>hate</i> when this happens, I have overview of the problem, possibly a solution, but still I have to escalate the issue to make sure that my assumptions are correct.<br/><br/>It really bothers me to have made bad assumptions and I wish I would have addressed this early instead of being so <i>cocky</i>.<br/><br/>Anyway I have good friends and they might work for my client, but still I feel they are my colleagues and I trust their judgment intentions and even though they can pinpoint errors and so on on my side - I really appreciate that they help me out.<br/><br/>Man, I miss the days when we worked together I really enjoy when we have a chance to do so again, I would just wish for this to be more long term...</p>

... it helps sometimes to write 00_assumptions.t<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

The problem in this case would probably not be solved with your solution, since it was a matter of  subjective analysis - I neglected the requirements addressing the problem area and would probably have done so writing 00_Assumptions.t also.<br><br>I can only blame myself.

It is very satisfying when your are part of a really good team. I have been lucky enough to get that in back to back projects.
