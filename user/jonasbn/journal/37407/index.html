<p>When I started out with my company a good friend and fellow Perl monger, set up a CVS repository on one of his machines.<br/><br/>I have since then become quite happy about Subversion and I signed up with an external Subversion provider, which works really well for me. It is easy to use and it gives me what I need.<br/><br/>So I wanted to migrate the active stuff from CVS to Subversion - primarily my CPAN modules, so the term active is perhaps not the best description. Anyway - not having these in a repository I can access from everywhere have started to become problematic, so I decided to move the stuff to Subversion so I could at least pretend to be active.<br/><br/>So I started by making a tar-ball of the old repository directory on the CVS server.<br/><br/>I setup CVS on my workstation (<a href=" http://developer.apple.com/internet/opensource/cvsoverview.html>)<br"> http://developer.apple.com/internet/opensource/cvsoverview.html>)<br</a><br/>I <i>untarred</i> the tar-ball in the new directory and I was able to check stuff out.<br/><br/>So I checked out everything relevant (other stuff can just stay in CVS, no problem).<br/><br/>I copied my old working directories into the newly checked out working directories and commit the changes to my new local CVS server.<br/><br/>I then made a subversion dump using <code>cvs2svn</code>.<br/><br/>I sat up the projects with my provider each with a dump file.<br/><br/>So now I can move on and get some distributions released, which I should have shipped long ago (they are starting to sneak into production code with one of my clients).<br/><br/>I added an ohloh user to some of the repositories with read permission and added two projects to Ohloh.<br/><br/>I know people are all crazy about git these days and perhaps I will end up all excited about git as well and I know I am some years behind with my use of Subversion, but believe me I am behind with most things I do.<br/><br/>I do however like Subversion a lot and the tools available seem to quite good. So for now Subversion is what I am using.
