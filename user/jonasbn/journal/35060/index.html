<div class="span8">
<p>I am very much a release person. I work with Perl everyday and I attempt to use the concept of releases in as much as can. Another thing I use a lot is the CPAN distribution format.<br/><br/>Using the CPAN distribution format gives me a lot of great tools to distribute my work over several machines like test and production environments, sometimes it seems overkill if you want to test a very little thing, which is hard to test in your development environment, which is for me is my workstation, but I am also getting better at that part.<br/><br/>Well the release gives me the control over my distributions over time and when something is finished I tag it in CVS and create a release just as I do with my CPAN contributions.<br/><br/>But sometimes I am not the only one working on the code base, projects and assignments, which is ok.<br/><br/>But right now I am in a situation where I am closing projects for two other developers which is also okay, but the situation is somewhat, hmmm... chaotic.<br/><br/>The code I am supposed to finalize and put in production is in CVS (most of it), which at least is a beginning, but none of the projects was quite finished so I need to find out what state they are in, what the state of their dependencies are and get things finished.<br/><br/>And all I have is HEAD and the CVS log.<br/><br/>The CVS log can assist much in this, but I would have loved a Changes file since some of these applications are huge. I will get back to this is another journal entry.<br/><br/>By now I have things in CVS and I have tagged things, so I can get back to a state prior to my intervention and I can start to roll things into the test environment and start the test. Unfortunately some of the dependencies are not completely up to date, so it is very much a phase of experimenting, changing committing, releasing and testing...<br/><br/>So I am getting somewhere - slowly.<br/><br/>But one thing I do not understand about all this, is why are people not thinking in releases? I have subclasses Module::Build to suit our need and more and more of our applications are using it even though they will never go on CPAN. I version all of my releases and distributions so I can track what features get introduced where do I can clearly mark the dependencies, since I want to be warned at build time not at run time when deploying.<br/><br/>I understand and acknowledge the following arguments:<br/><br/><cite>The process of releasing is to much work, you have to update versions numbers, make sure things are okay and tag stuff in CVS</cite><br/><br/>Then automate the process so it is not so difficult, check Module::Release or something?<br/><br/><cite>Small updates and fixes are easier to apply directly where the code is running</cite><br/><br/>But what if the code is running in several places and do you remember to remove debugging statements, reset debugging flags and everything back into CVS.<br/><br/>So what other arguments are there NOT to use versioned releases, shipped as distributions, your reflections on the topic are most welcome, since I simply cannot work without process also as a mental tool and I do not really see an alternative other than chaos.
