<p>I really really like Devel::Cover, I have disturbed PJCJ and several occasions and it seems as if his tool is actually working and that I am the idiot.<br/><br/>I am writing documentation for this big provisioning system and if was the idea to add tests at the same time.<br/><br/>But as for Games::Bingo the test coverage report gave a lot of 'n/a's instead of useful data on coverage.<br/><br/>I reported this issue a long time ago to PJCJ via <a href="http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=24599">rt.cpan.org</a> and I have tried to figure out what the problem was, the scary thing was really that it seems as if I am the only one with this problem, so I expected that it was me who was doing something wrong. But I really needed help to understand what I was doing wrong.<br/><br/>So when this new coverage report came up with all the 'n/a's I turned back to Games::Bingo since this distribution is much smaller and it would be easier to look for the problem there.<br/><br/>After several attempts and clean up of the code, I got it working. I released 0.14 of Games::Bingo to CPAN. I was however unsure what specifically had made it work again - and I still am. <br/><br/>Anyway I applied some of the same patterns to the provision system code (the tests) and it worked out. The problem seemed to be: <code>BEGIN { use_ok(...); };</code> statements.<br/><br/><code>use lib qw(...)</code> might also play a part, but I have not been able to successfully isolate this complete yet, but I will try to.<br/><br/>I hope I will be able to deliver something concrete to PJCJ, perhaps even a POD patch or similar.<br/><br/>Oh and one last thing, the system I am too test currently has a coverage of 18.8%, so I am silently weeping into my keyboard.<br/><br/>Insert Unicode characters for tears here</p>
