<div class="span8">
<p>Every wednesday we meet at the office - all other days are spent with the current client.<br/><br/>These wednesdays are quite good, we have meeting, work on own stuff or other projects - and things are improving and moving on. The pace however is very slow, but I guess that is the price you pay when you spend all your time somewhere else and only have evenings and wednesdays - but somehow these days are very satisfactory and I am normally very tired after a day of planning/discussing and designing and of course coding.<br/><br/>I can only recommend getting sometime away from you client if you are working as a consultant. I think it is healthy.<br/><br/>I do however enjoy working as a consultant, but I must admit that I am a bit of a control freak, so just being a programming consultant is ok, when the tasks/projects are small and well-defined, but when things grow organically and project managers start to look clueless, coders start to speak passed eachother and everything starts to go haywire, I would prefer to have some control and power.<br/><br/>The project I am working on for my client has been going quite well for a long time, until we should have some deliverables from some other resources, then the signs started showing of a project going the wrong way. We are however still in a situation where things can be fixed and I think I will just focus on my assignment as a programmer, because some people could be provoked if I attempt to take control.<br/><br/>Well this was not what this entry was to be about, anyway - if I was to get a job, not working as a freelancer, I think I would like to be either a:
<ul>
<li>a quality assurance responsible</li>
<li>a project manager</li>
<li>a software architect</li>
</ul>
 
These are the aspects of software development, which intrigues me the most and I will never be a hot-shot programmer - I simply started programming too late and spend a lot of time persuing other activities and I can be quite good with people and processes.</p>
