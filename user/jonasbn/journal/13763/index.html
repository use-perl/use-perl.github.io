<p>I really wanted to keep a journal at the YAPC::Europe, since I forgot to do it as the Scandinavian Perl Workshop (well at that time I was quite busy), but this time simply too much was going on at the same time, so I really never got around to doing it, too many people to talk to, to many new modules to check out...<br/><br/>Well so now I am going to recapture a bit on the YAPC::Europe 2003. The arrangement was great, really great lecture halls and many interesting presentations (I even re-visited some I head in Munich last year).<br/><br/>I only have 3 things of negative critique, so here goes:<br/><br/><li>It would have been nice with some rooms with table so one could sit down and work (and talk with people)
<li>It would have been nice with some better handling of the BOFs, I think this is extremely important for the community (this is closely related to the point above)
<li>Finally, it would have been nice if you could stick around for a bit longer than 18:00, (Closely related with the two points above)
</li><br/><br/>These are all things we tried to do at the Scandinavian Perl Workshop, but there the problem was that many of the attendees were not used to doing BOFs and socialising like the people attending YAPC and OSCON.<br/><br/>But all in all the confenrence was really cool and the Paris.pm can be really proud of the event.<br/><br/>Well for my own presentation, I can only say I REALLY have to practice more. I am thinking about doing two lightning talks next year in Belfast. One on a serious subject and the other one on doing lightning talks, which can probably be used to finish the first one aswell, if I run out of time, like this year in Paris.<br/><br/>Well the disappointment over not getting the YAPC::Europe in 2004 went away fast, I guess we stated our point, when we complained and we have been encouraged to try againg next year for YAPC::Europe 2005, lets see what happens in the future, now we are looking forward to going to Belfast and visiting Belfast.pm.</p>
