<p>We have common network connection to the Internet in the block where I live. Lately the line has proven less and less stable. When leaving work yesterday I wanted to continue working from home. After a short time, the connection disappeared.<br/><br/>In the beginning of the week the same pattern obstructed me from reaching a client's servers via VPN. So I had to delay my delivery to them. As I have mentioned earlier, the night belongs to <code>cron</code> so I also ran in the problem of the SCM being taken offline at 23:30 - <i>argh</i><br/><br/>I have to talk to the people in charge of this. Perhaps I should monitor the connection so I can document the instability.<br/><br/>The lack of network yesterday had a positive side-effect however. So I was able to finalize the POD for Workflow, so the distribution now has a POD coverage of 100%. This does not say anything about the quality of the POD, but it does feel good to have ALL subs/methods mentioned in the POD.<br/><br/>The overall test coverage has increased to 73.0% and perhaps over the summer I can get closer to the 100%.<br/><br/>Well the release candidate for 0.28 of Workflow is getting closer. 0.27 has some failing tests I also have addressed.<br/><br/>It was not exactly $work related, but it felt good to do some work in another application than Word. It seems as everything I do these days however have to do with documentation - I need to do some more programming soon...</p>
