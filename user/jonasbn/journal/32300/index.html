<p>I am never really bleeding edge with anything, I simply do not have the time to be and I am not sure I have the patience to be so either, but that is a different story.<br/><br/>Yesterday I wrote my first AJAX snippet, I got a few AJAX books some months ago and yesterday I got my first AJAX assignment. I am taking over the implementation of an application with one of my clients, a large project with several applications and much to do.<br/><br/>So I downloaded the examples from the book and some of the code I had been pointed to by collegues (such as <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> and <a href="http://scbr.com/docs/products/dhtmlxTree/">dhtmlxTree</a>.<br/><br/>So looking at the examples and scimming through <a href="http://www.apress.com/book/bookDisplay.html?bID=10042">Foundations of AJAX</a> I located what I needed and got it up and running, I looked at the Java example provided and reimplemented it as a Perl CGI script instead and *ding* I had a asyncronous date validation implemented.<br/><br/>So now I have the VERY basics of AJAX somewhat in place, at least for the callback features and communication with server-side scripts.<br/><br/>So now I am moving on to the next hurdle a prototype of a AJAX application integrated with my clients framework (I think I have mentioned this framework before, I was one of the lead architects). Anyway it is a mod_perl based web framework, based on XSL, XML and Perl, multiple frontend and application servers.<br/><br/>So the idea would be to get AJAX running on the frontend and communicating with the existing applications servers and accessing their XML responding methods.<br/><br/>When have implemented something similar to the date validator in this framework end to end, I can move on the the real task at hand. Integrating a tree view with asyncronous updating per node with an existing application.<br/><br/>I have ideas for other of the applications, which could gain something from either DHTML or AJAX features, so now I just need to convince the client, but lets first see how the prototype goes. </p>
