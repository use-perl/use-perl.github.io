<p>My son turned 2 in January. He will be joined by a sibling brother in the beginning of April. This is going to be tough, he is just old enough to understand that he is going to share all his resources (grandparents, parents and things in general) at the same time, even though we have seen improvements with <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/jonasbn/journal/29451">his cousin</a>, he is quite the ego. <br/><br/>He is not old enough to ignore his own ego - he does however show good people skills and the ability to read people. The other day my wife took the bus with him, they barely got in the bus, because in was filled, so when they got the few stops they needed to go, my wife asked the bus driver whether they could exit via the frontdoor (normally for entering) and the bus driver declined - so my wife got herself and our son through the crowd towards the backdoor and on the way my son uttered, "the busdriver was sour", perhaps not in perfect danish, but he got the picture.<br/><br/>It also seem as the kicking and hitting is no longer the  preferred way of solving problems.<br/><br/>For a 2 year old he is talking a lot, somethings are for parents only to understand but he improves all the time and it does not take him long from hearing a word, asking about until he uses it himself. There are however words he just pick up and not get to use, but that is because he asks about everything he sees, like - flowerpot etc.<br/><br/>So I am concerned, happy and anxious about the forthcoming birth, I just hope #1 can handle it, well he has too, since #2 is coming to stay.</p>
