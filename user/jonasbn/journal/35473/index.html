<div class="span8">
<p>I am thinking about claiming a new title. Currently I refer to myself as software architect.<br/><br/>I do not hold any sort of formal education as an architect and I am pretty much self-taught.<br/><br/>I evaluated what it is that I do - and I write specifications and code. My specifications aim not to be BDUF, since I want to give the developers and even myself enough elbow room to navigate within the boundaries of the given assignment. So I attempt to outline these boundaries, using things such as API references and GUI mock-ups. I recommend some CPAN modules and perhaps provide some examples, but that is pretty much it.<br/><br/>So I am not sure this can be called true architectural work - so I consider claiming to be a software producer.<br/><br/>The only bad thing is the association with the movie business and when it comes to movies I have no concrete idea of what it is that a producer does, so...<br/><br/>What about hacker?<br/><br/>Or even: h4X0r?<br/><br/>I need coffee</p>

<p>Software developer?</p>

My favorite term is "computer programmer".  I don't know why everyone is keen on making up wish-washy titles like "architect" or "engineer" when "programmer" works fine.
<br>
Keep in mind that Knuth's famous books are "The art of computer programming", not "The art of software engineering" or "The art of computer science".

<p>&#8220;Software developer&#8221; is wishy washy?</p>

I prefer the word "program" to "software".  Program means something, software really doesn't.  JMHO.

<p>Software is a bunch of programs and possibly some data that together serve some real-world purpose, whereas a program is just one thing that runs as a single execution unit.</p>

<p>I can tell you I do more than just type programs into my computer from top to bottom in a single sitting. <i>The Art of Computer Programming</i>, to my knowledge, does not have chapters about version control or about drafting and verifying requirements. (Nor should it, FWIW.)</p>

<p>Programming is what you do in the moment when you wrangle code in your editor. Software development is the day-, week-, month- or years-long process in which programming happens <em>as a means to an end</em>.</p>

<p>And that is another case in point: I know it is not my job to create code. It is my job to create functionality. The less code I can write to achieve the required or desired functionality, the better. If the things for which I write code could be done without a computer with reasonable efficiency, my client would fire me and do them without a computer. From this perspective, calling myself a &#8220;programmer&#8221; would be sort of like a carpenter calling himself a &#8220;hammerer&#8221; or a &#8220;hacksawer.&#8221;</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not advocating highfalutin terms like &#8220;software engineer&#8221; (it&#8217;s not engineering except in a tiny number of cases), system architect (and who are the minions who build it?), senior software consultant (what does that even mean?), or any number of others. In contrast, &#8220;software developer&#8221; seems accurate and unassuming to me, but unlike &#8220;computer programmer&#8221; it puts the emphasis on the right thing.</p>

I really like the title 'Computer Programmer' and I always use that when in non-tech forums.<br><br>But as a professional freelancer where title, followed by CV is entry point to jobs - I must emphasize the importance of a proper title and probably the more <i>whishy-whashy</i> the better<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br><br>And in my daily work I do a lot of stuff not necessary computer programming, such as: design, layout, specification, project management, support, bug fixing, testing, documentation writing and a little system administration.<br><br>So 'Computer Programmer' comes a little short in that line of business, when putting this in some CV database.
