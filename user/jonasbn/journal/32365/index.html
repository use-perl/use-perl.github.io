<div class="span8">
<p>Our local LUG, (SSLUG) have a general programming list. A part from other languages, a Perl question gets posted once in a while.<br/><br/>Today some guy asked a question about reading two different things via STDIN, like this:
<pre>
./test.pl < fil1
</pre><br/><br/>After reading the file the program should ask questions to the user, recording the responses from STDIN.<br/><br/>The example outline was pretty simple:<br/><br/><pre>
#! /usr/bin/perl<br/><br/>use strict;
use warnings;<br/><br/>my @lines;
my $line;
while ($line = <STDIN>) {
    push @lines,$line;
}
#STDIN->clearerr;
#seek(STDIN, 0, 1);<br/><br/>my $input;
foreach $line (@lines) {
    print "$line";
    $input = <STDIN>;
    print "You said $input\n";
}
</pre><br/><br/>But the author of the question had problems getting the responses from STDIN.<br/><br/>I had no idea how to solve this, probably because I would never implement a program this way - but I found the problem quite interesting. So I read a few man pages, tried out a few things, but without luck - I was simply not familiar with that part of the Perl language.<br/><br/>I primarily do web and database stuff, I hardly ever work on files and if I do it is very basic operations and I love using Tie::Array.<br/><br/>Before I found a solution, the author posted the solution himself.<br/><br/>I refactored his original to give a more suitable example:<br/><br/><cite>A small program, which reads a number of questions from a file via STDIN, prompts the user for a response via STDIN and prints question and response in conjunction to STDERR.<br/><br/><pre>
#! /usr/bin/perl -w<br/><br/>use strict;<br/><br/>my @questions;
while (my $question = <STDIN>) {
    push @questions,$question;
}
close(STDIN);<br/><br/>open(STDIN,'/dev/tty');
foreach (@questions) {
	print "$_";
    print STDERR "$_";
    print STDERR <STDIN>."\n";
}<br/><br/>exit(0);<br/><br/>__END__<br/><br/>Usage: questions.pl <questions.txt 2>data.txt
</pre><br/><br/>What bothers me is the fact that I did not know how to do this is Perl, but as written earlier, I would never come across a problem like this and therefor not the solution.<br/><br/>I wish there would be an <i>open</i> variant of the Perl Cookbook, like a wiki, where these recipes/solutions providing basic solutions to basic problems using either CPAN modules or preferably basic Perl could be shared. <br/><br/>In order to improve as a programmer I guess is you have to be exposed to a variation of problems, but also a variation of tools, here meaning programming languages. I remember when going back from VB.NET and PL/SQL to Perl I saw Perl in a new light.<br/><br/>I also remember when I started out with 'Learning Perl', I loved solving the tasks, since this gave me exposure to Perl parts, without having being related to work or something else with a deadline, some legacy code or cultural dependency controlling the way you would or could solve the problem. Of course there is also a cultural influence imposed by the author and possibly the author of Perl and I could go on.<br/><br/>It is nice to sometimes to be able look at problem  with a white sheet of paper and be able to start from scratch. Break the problem down, prototype, experiment, understand and finally implement and solve the problem.<br/><br/>The paradigme I attempt to enforce it an approach of <i>divide and conquer</i>, but unless exposed to diverse problems the solutions will most often be based on the same, sometimes bad solutions and not necessarily the <i>best practice</i>... <br/><br/>I guess the bare bone nature outlined by the poster to the LUG list made me interested there was a working snippet to a simple problem, but not a solution.<br/><br/>Well anyway I might have to consider how to get exposed to a larger variety of problems one way or the other, so I can learn a wider variety of solutions and a wider use of Perl and other tools.</p>

<p><blockquote> <div><tt>#!/usr/bin/perl -w<br>use strict;<br> <br>die "Usage: $0 questions.txt [morequestions.txt<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...] &gt; answers.txt"<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; if not @ARGV;<br> <br>while( &lt;&gt; ) {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; print STDERR $_;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; print $_;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; print scalar &lt;STDIN&gt;;<br>}</tt></div> </blockquote>  <p>The key is that the question files must be given as commandline arguments, not passed in via redirection. The <code>&lt;&gt;</code> diamond operator will read from the files listed in <code>@ARGV</code> and you can read STDIN separately from it at the same time.</p>

Ah, much more in line with what I would probably do, however not as short and artistic.<br><br>Thanks for the solution it is very nice.

Yea, this is a suitable solution for<br> <br><br/><br/><tt>  foo.pl inputfile.txt</tt> <br> <br><br/><br/>But what if you want to do<br> <br><br/><br/><tt>  grep bar inputfile.txt | foo.pl</tt> <br> <br><br/><br/>instead?<br> <br>

<p>If you use bash, you can use process substitution instead:</p>

<p> <code>foo.pl &lt;( grep bar inputfile.txt )</code> </p>

Far too complicated<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

<p>It&#8217;s more reliable (<code>/dev/tty</code> isn&#8217;t always available) and more flexible (you don&#8217;t need Expect to feed it answers from a file, you just redirect standard input). But the clincher for me is that it&#8217;s still less and simpler code. Cf. Carter&#8217;s Compass.</p>

Well, that's a borderline. IMO the API should always be nicer than the guts<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
