<p>I had to run the last 500 meters to the venue in order to make it on time to hear Jonathan Worthingtons talk on Rakudo.<br/><br/>Packaging and checking out at the hotel took some time, because I had spent all morning in front of the laptop.<br/><br/>The talk was marvelous and I talked to Jonathan afterwards about different aspects of sponsorship and grants.<br/><br/>The rest of the day continued with nice talks and at lunch time I headed back to meet with my wife and get some lunch. We were flying home somewhat early so we had time to see the little guys before they where going to bed.<br/><br/>Our flight home was uneventful and we made it home, tired, but in a good mood from relaxing a whole weekend in Stockholm.<br/><br/>Then all hell broke loose...<br/><br/>Apparently small kids do not handle lack of parents quite well so the youngest would not sleep and kept crying - this had not been an issue over the weekend, but is returning triggered something.<br/><br/>This has now continued for a few days, but we are getting on top of things, with our zero tolerance sleep policy.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed Stockholm I got to see much more than previous times I have been here - I guess have my wife to thank for that. Looking at the aftermath of our weekend trip I can only say I am happy that YAPC::Europe is a local event.<br/><br/>The NPW was great I got to talk to a lot of people even though I did not attend the <i>socials</i> - Jonathan is a marvelous guy and I feel Perl 6 is in good hands.<br/><br/>People where doing all sort of crazy things in Perl and as always my head and notebook was filled with ideas and stuff to check out, implement and try out when coming back home.<br/><br/>The venue was nice, but a bit small, but perhaps the number of attendees was higher than anticipated by the organizers.<br/><br/>Btw. thanks to the organizers for organizing yet another nice low-key Perl event in our part of the world. Next years NPW venue has not yet been settled, but we are still hoping that we might extend our reaches so places like Iceland and Finland would be really nice.</p>
