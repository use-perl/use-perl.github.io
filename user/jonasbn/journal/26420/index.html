<p>This weekend I was paid a visit by Philippe 'BooK' Bruhat from Lyon.pm (Paris.pm) - it was nice to have time to talk with him - YAPCs are always so hectic you do not get to talk to all the people you want to.<br/><br/>BooK and his wife came for dinner saturday and we talked about everything but computers to the extent possible (the girls actually brought it up) - it was nice talking with BooK and getting to know him without talking Perl.<br/><br/>In the end we had to discuss YAPCs and Workshops though, since we both are interested and involved in these aspects of Perl mongering.<br/><br/>I hope BooK and his wife enjoyed their visit to Copenhagen and visiting my little family - we really enjoyed their visit eventhough it was short.<br/><br/>I hope I will be able to extent my hospitality again some other time, since I find the experience very enjoyable and I learn a lot.
I have only had one monger visiting where I did not have the time to meet up - most unfortunate and it still bothers me - JPIERCE I hope you will come by Copenhagen another time.
