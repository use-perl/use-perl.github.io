<p>Friday we had to pack all our stuff into boxes, so it could be moved over the weekend. So when I got in at 08:00 am monday morning, I went straight to the new location of the team I am associated with.<br/><br/>We have a saying in danish: <cite>Nissen flytter altid med</cite>, which translates to something like: <cite>The pixie always moves along</cite>. Kind of the situation I feel like I am in right now.<br/><br/>Anyway I found <i>my</i> spot, but I could not find my particular box. After going through all the boxed (just looking at labels) I just sat down and started working.<br/><br/>I went for a coffee and when I got back I saw a box I might have missed (believe me there was boxes every where). Well it was my box, containing:<br/><br/><ul>
<li>Perl Debugger pocket reference</li>
<li>My XSLT book</li>
<li>Pens and paper</li>
<li>A few cables</li>
<li>A my notes and printed specifications neatly organized by project.</li>
</ul><br/><br/>I guess my stuff filled a quarter of a box and I looked at some of the other seats, people had like 5-6 full boxes. I am glad I am an only an extern, anyway if I have to empty my own office, I would also be able to fill quite a few boxes - but it felt in this situation to travel light and I guess I should do some spring cleaning at my own office, not to wind up with too much stuff.<br/><br/>We are getting closer to christmas and I have 2 days of christmas shopping scheduled this week, which leaves me with 3 working days, so I am quite busy here up to christmas, I guess that is what it is like to be a pixie this close to christmas.</p>
