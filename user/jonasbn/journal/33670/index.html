<p>I have just finished the second draft and I expect to make a last and final draft tonight. The deadline is tonight, but I think I can squeeze it in between dinner, diapers and documentaries on tv.<br/><br/>A fellow Copenhagen Perl Monger stated I was curagious to send the application - because what if it is accepted.<br/><br/>This got me thinking and I am ready, if we do not apply I will regret it - and I know some of my fellow mongers, will sit in Vienna and think, "why didn't we apply, this is so much fun". <br/><br/>So tonight I will mail the application, I will cross my fingers and hope for the best.<br/><br/>I am not going to attend YAPC::Europe in Vienna this year, I am not in a situation where I can leave my wife with the two boys alone for such a long period.<br/><br/>Anyway, I hope and know the best bid will win and I will attend in 2008 no matter if it is in Copenhagen or not. Man I am so envious of the people who are going to Vienna. I will be on all the related IRC channels disturbing as much as I possibly can, well when not changing diapers or writing documentation. <br/><br/>Luckily there will be EuroBSDCon in Copenhagen in September in 2007, so I will have opportunity to attend one conference at least.</p>

<p>Now I'm curious, does 'hoping for the best' means you wish your proposal will be accepted, or not<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>

<p> <i>I am not going to attend YAPC::Europe in Vienna this year</i> </p>

That's a pitty! But do know how much work two kids are. Luckily, mine are already big enough (nearly 8 and 11.5 years) to be not so much of a hassle any more. No diapers, yay!

Well I will leave that up to the reader, I guess even you will have differing opinions on the meaning of best throughout organizing, executing and evaluating the forthcoming YAPC::Europe.<br><br>By the way I wish you guys all the best with YAPC::Europe in Vienna - I wish I could attend.
