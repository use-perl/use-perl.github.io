<p>I just moved all my stuff from a 15" inch MacBook Pro to a 17" using the <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1554?viewlocale=en_US">migration assistant</a>, I skimmed <a href="http://www.macdevcenter.com/pub/a/mac/2005/05/17/tiger.html">an article on the subject</a> briefly.<br/><br/>I have attempted to use it earlier on older versions of OSX without much luck, but this time it worked out.<br/><br/>I bought the 17" for a temp doing work for me. He moved on to another job. I had seen brian d foy's 17" MacBook Pro in Oslo, which he placed in the middle of the sole desk there and left on - a very nice machine. I have sworn to the 15" since my first TiBook, the 15" machine being leftout now is my third 15" inch - I wonder if I will ever be able to go back to that series again.<br/><br/>The screen is very powerful and the resolution matches my external display, so I do not experience the <i>hard</i> edges, that stop me from moving the mouse pointer between the display.<br/><br/>I did do one mistake and that was creating a user with the same name as on my 15", so I ended up with two users (jonasbn and jonasbn2), so I had to pull some stunts to get jonasbn2 to become jonasbn, like <a href="http://www.danfrakes.com/">ChangeShortName</a> has become easier and the tool is not necessary.<br/><br/>It seems as if everything got transferred, the only thing causing some confusion was a new <code>/etc/hosts</code>. I do wonder however why Unix was never gifted with the possibility of using a <code>~/.hosts</code>, who do you write to get this feature?<br/><br/>Anyway, the 17" works magnificently and it incredibly fast. The 15" might be donated to my wife who is running on a PowerPC based iBook, which I bought for her a loooooong time ago, I mean, in case she reads this, not so long ago...
