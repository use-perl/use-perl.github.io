<p>A few weeks back we changed ISP to gain more bandwidth for the same price. <br/><br/>Everything has been working ok (the story of the switch taking place while I was out of the office, screwing up a lot of things will have to wait until another time).<br/><br/>But all of a sudden the ADSL connection stopped working - this is really annoying and shows me how vulnerable we are and how dependent we are on the Internet access.<br/><br/>LUCKILY we had forgotten to shutdown the ADSL connection we had in the first place to a switch was made and we were running again.<br/><br/>This all made me think of the following things:<br/><br/>- Should I have the CVS repository locally? - right now it also acts as remote location backup
- Should we have a cheap-cheap backup line or can we do with Bluetooth and modems?
- We should remember to clean up configurations, it was nice that the old configurations worked, but it was also a potential security hole</p>

<h2>Another point to consider</h2>

The fact that price and quality often are connected<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
