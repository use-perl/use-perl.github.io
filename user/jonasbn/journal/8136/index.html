<p>Well running in to time problems again... I haven't had any time to code Perl. So I am very happy that at our Copenhagen Perl Mongers meeting last monday we decided on a date for our 'cod-a-thon'.<br/><br/>It is going to be fun to code something for 'yourself' and something which is not controlled by economics. And the people whom are going to participate will all be good friends and fellow mongers so we are going to have a ball.<br/><br/>It have just been payday which resulted in me ordering a Perl book and a basestation, so hopefully I can get to code some more Perl at home when I can take the laptop with me into the bedroom - I know that sounds a bit weird, but living in a two room appartment, makes the bedroom the livingroom and makes the livingroom the dinningroom simply due to the placement of the television.<br/><br/>I not much of a television viewer myself - I actually prefer the Internet (I don't mind a good documentary or movie), but TV really takes a lot of time - and computers don't??<br/><br/>Well anyway I am looking forward to being able to code some more or at least update this journal and dream of all the magnificent Perl code I should have written...</p>

I keep reading that as some sort of fish-eating contest.  If you spell it "codathon" or "code-a-thon" it's okay, but the other definitely starts with "cod".

Well english isn't my native tongue, but when inventing the term, I wanted to use the 'a' to end the word 'code', so it would sound a bit like the minister/reverend from Simpsons.<br> <br>But I see what you mean I will try to see if I can fixit<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
