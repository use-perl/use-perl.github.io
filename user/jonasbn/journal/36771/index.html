<p>The other night I was contacted by mst on IRC, I received a torrent of words, but I just leaned back and read on.<br/><br/>My <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/jonasbn/journal/36616">journal entry</a> entitled "Burden of Proof", had upset a few people.<br/><br/>I had offended the person (bricas) whom had attempted to follow-up on the RT ticket and I was told my mst that I had been too hard on him.<br/><br/>So I told mst that I would apologize to him, I felt there was not reason to go into a discussion about this.<br/><br/>I contacted bricas right away and apologized, since it had never been my intent with the journal entry to offend anybody. We talked back and forth with bricas and I think we worked things out.<br/><br/>After this I sat back with a feeling that I had experienced this before and I had. Well the roles where just different. So I dug up a <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/jonasbn/journal/33911">journal entry</a> - where I had been offended on some comments on one of the CPAN modules I am maintaining.<br/><br/>I was somewhat ashamed and saddened by the fact that I had offended bricas and that I had actually been in bricas situation and had still been so stupid as to attack his efforts and work, when I knew what it felt like to be attacked like that.<br/><br/>My intent of the journal was actually to address the problem of head-less bug squishing and lacking test and the problem of not processing bug reports when fresh. But I had still gone after the messenger and this was never the intent but still a fact.<br/><br/>So an apology was in order, no question about that.<br/><br/>Yesterday bricas was so kind to inform me that the issue I originally had reported had been addressed and fixed.

<p>I feel like we were able to work through whatever misunderstandings we had. I think it's easy to see that either side can feel invested in the issue and how a person can get upset if things aren't handled properly.</p><p>I'm just really glad the bug has been resolved!<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>
