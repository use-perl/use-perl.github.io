<p>I saw a TV show where they mentioned <b>Second Life</b> I was not particularly impressed by the idea, 3D graphics have never really rocked my boat, I grew up with comics so I am a 2D person. But the concept sounded interesting. Using the technigues of online gaming to create a peaceful online world.<br/><br/>So I finally downloaded the client, registered and logged in. I had one hell of time attempting to complete the tutorial, I did not find it particularly clear. I think actual games are more clean on the aspect of completion. I guess because it is essential as a gaming aspect, <b>Second Life</b> is perhaps to open-ended?<br/><br/>Anyway at some point I was allowed to travel to the actual world of <b>Second Life</b> I landed on some island with a lot of people speaking Dutch. Heh... so I moved on ended up in some island hosting gay bars, it was empty. So I moved on, met a single person on some small podcasting related island. Talked a bit, it was nice, like IRC, but the person I met I never would have met on IRC I guess since I primarily frequent technical/perl related channels.<br/><br/>So this brings me to the conclusion, that <b>Second Life</b> is just another time consumer, just like online gaming, something I would like to do if it took less time, since I do not have time to play <b>WoW</b>, <b>EVE-Online</b> or even <b>Second Life</b> the investment is simply too big.<br/><br/>It is hard to navigate around, there are no signs, it seems fairly unstructured and it is just vast and empty. So it simply made me feel alone. Should just have logged into <b>#perl</b> and just stuck around with all the other crazy Perl people.<br/><br/>If somebody would give me some guidelines I might revisit or if I get bored some late night, but else I think I will wait for the next generation of <b>Second Life</b> like communities...</p>

<h2>My impression of Second Life</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Alias/">Alias</a> on 2007-04-24T09:27:21</h3>
I've logged in a few times to see what happens when people are let loose on a relatively open computational space.<br><br>My first impression. Porn, furries and clothes shopping.<br><br>My second impression, SLOW. It looks like me that people have basically filled the place up right to the utter limits of lag survivability.<br><br>What I find interesting is I see the same thing in EVE Online. Fleet battles break down at about 200 people due to sheer load on the client (which is survivable if you take specific steps to reduce graphics complexity and such) and server (which is not survivable).<br><br>In fact, there's been a few fights that could easily made 1000-2000 but then the space is rent asunder and the server node goes down.<br><br>I wonder if this is part of the nature of these computational spaces, that they naturally fill to the limits of tolerability. Given that it is a shared free computational resource, the Tragedy of the Commons would seem to apply to this case.
