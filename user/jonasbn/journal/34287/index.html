<p>Sometimes you are lucky enough to get to work with talented people and talented people which are not necessarily programmers.<br/><br/>I am currently involved in a project with such a person. The person is the product manager, which mean that he is the original customer in this case. He wrote up the business case, the requirements and got the project going.<br/><br/>We had a meeting where we had to discuss a mail about some aspects of fraud protection we needed to build into the application.<br/><br/>I did not understand the mail, so we called for a meeting.<br/><br/>So the product manager explained it to me and the other technicians and the project manager.<br/><br/>And *boom* it struck me, what he was describing was a business rule hack.<br/><br/>It was simple and in it essence beautiful, I wish I could share it here, but I have to respect the clients business.<br/><br/>Anyway, we still had a possible <i>hole</i> in the application, but on my way back from the meeting, I was discussing the solution with a fellow technician and it struck me, using a variation of the <b>hack</b> we could close the last <i>hole</i>.<br/><br/>I love working with clever and talented people, I learn new things and I get inspired to think outside the box.<br/><br/>I wish there was a way to ensure a constant exposure to these talented people.<br/><br/>One way would be to hire them all, but I am not quite there yet.</p>
