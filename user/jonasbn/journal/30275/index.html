<p>TNT being the carrier assigned to deliver my new MacBook, did NOT get my shipment address change, so they called from my in front of my front door, to my girlfriend, so I was informed to call their customer service to reschedule the delivery.<br/><br/>First thing, I do not understand why they called my girlfriend, I have provided my mobile number when ordering the laptop.<br/><br/>Anyway I called TNT and was informed that their computer system was down and that I had to call back later.<br/><br/>So I did, I was then informed that in order to change the shipping address I would have to do this via Apple.<br/><br/>So I called Apple again and asked what had happened to the change of address I had requested earlier. They informed me it would take place now and that TNT would be informed.
They also informed me that the delivery would not be made to day, I am not totally unreasonable and I now it takes time to get to Bornholm so, I accepted :)<br/><br/>Checking the Apple website the next morning I could see that the address had still not changed, but instead of calling Apple I called TNT to hear where they expected to deliver and they told me Bornholm, today.<br/><br/>So I am very excited, it seems I will get my new MacBook Pro today.</p>

After hearing more stories like this, I begin to feel good about FedEx/UPS delivery here in the States. It's pretty rare that I have shipping issues like that.<br><br>That's not to say that it doesn't happen. I've have my fair share of servers with forklift damage, or packed in UPS boxes with duct tape, and they claim "it came from the factory that way". Yeah, I'm sure Compaq/IBM shipped out a server like that.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

When the iPod nano came out I ordered one and Apple used TNT to ship it to me here in Stockholm, Sweden.<br><br>After spending some time at the hub in China(?) they sent it to the European hub in Belgium (or Netherlands). From there they sent it to Riga and when I called to ask them why they had sent it to Riga their reply was: "Well, we ship the path that is fastest". 5 minutes later when I check the tracking service it said "Routing error. Possible delay" !!! argh!!! So another call to TNT and they admitted their mistake. It took a few days for them to send it back to the European hub and then another few days before they sent it to Stockholm.  Now, you'd think everything was fine but apparently they had changed their delivery time to daytime for private packages and I wasn't at home so they took it back. A call to TNT to ask them to ship it to work and I too got redirected to Apple Customer Services who can change the shipping address.<br><br>At the end I think it took them some 20 days to deliver my iPod.<br><br>On the plus side I got so frustrated I called TNT's customer service and spoke very freely about their service. The girl on the other side started crying so it was worth it =).<br><br>Maybe TNT's new slogan should be: "TNT - the logistics company that doesn't know logistics"<br><br>From now on I'll buy all my Apple stuff at the local Apple reseller.
