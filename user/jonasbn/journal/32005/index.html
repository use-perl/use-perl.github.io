<p>Ok, I got a blister on one of my toes from my first run, but I have decided to run every second day, so I went running again, blister or no blister.<br/><br/>The second run went technically much smoother, but my legs are not what they used to be and I expect it will take at least 3 months before I am back in shape.<br/><br/>I did not fight the iPod interface as much this time, so I improved my pace with 10 seconds per kilometer, there is still a long way to be below 5 minutes, which is my goal.<br/><br/>Which brings me to the Nike+ site/community, you can set up goals for your self, so I have calculated and set up a goal where I have to complete 14 runs in 4 weeks, this should be doable.<br/><br/>This was the only goal I found useful in my situation, even though I would very much like to setup the following goals:<br/><br/><li>a pace below 5 minutes per kilometer</li>
<li>a distance per workout of 5 km within 4 weeks</li><br/><br/>Since these are my immidate goals, these are however not configurable in the goals section of the Nike+ site, too bad<br/><br/>Here are my current stats:<br/><br/><cite>
4.43 kilometers in 24.04 minutes avg. pace: 5.25/km
</cite><br/><br/>So I am half a minute from my pace goal, half a kilometer from my workout distance goal and I have about 26 seconds to complete the last kilometer with a distance goal of 5 kilometers in 25 minutes.<br/><br/>My next trip is scheduled for tomorrow and we are on Bornholm, the route I normally run is by the sea and it is very varied (and tough), so I am anxious on how it is going to do, but the I have my secret weapon - the Powersong. I just have to figure out how to fire it up on the Nano during a workout...</p>
