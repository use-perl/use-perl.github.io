<p>No pun intended with the title, which is a paraphrased quote from <b>Black Adder</b>, should read <cite>nearly killed by a pygmy woman with a seriously sharpened mango</cite>.<br/><br/>Chris is probably taller than me, I have just wanted to use this quote ever since I first read about Chris' Mango project.<br/><br/>I have been following Chris Laco's Mango project from the side-line. Chris' Mango project is a generalization over his Handel framework, which is a CPAN downloadable shopping cart solution.<br/><br/>Please see: http://use.perl.org/user/jk2addict/journal/32952<br/><br/>We are currently working on a project where his Handel is integrated with our own logicShop and everything integrated in a Catalyst application.<br/><br/>It is my hope that logicShop 2.0.0 will emerge on the other side hopefully in an version, which can finally go <i>open source</i>, since this has been the plan all the way.<br/><br/>logicShop is however not aiming at Web 2.0 or anything, we are attempting to write a tool/framework to implement e-commerce solutions on top of. So I am not scared of Mango eventhough the announcement of the project gave me a scare, but I think we can live with two tools, nothing like a little competition and I think that our focus differs and therefor two different tools will evolve.</p>

You assume that I know what the hell I'm doing. The fact that you're using Handel furthers my assumption of your delusion.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br><br>I look forward to trading bits and stealing code from each other when logicShop is open source.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)
