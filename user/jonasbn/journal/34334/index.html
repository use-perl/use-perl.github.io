<div class="span8">
<p>Test Phases and Deliverables<br/><br/>I got a mail from a panicking project manager. Apparently he had been asked to present how we where to go about testing the project deliverables.<br/><br/>He sent out a test plan to all the involved parties.<br/><br/>The test plan outlined the follow test phases: <ul> <li>Module Test, performed by the developer in the development environment</li> <li>Integration Test, performed by all developers and coordinated by project management in test-environment</li> <li>User-acceptance (UAT), performed by testers in production environment</li> </ul><br/><br/>And it seemed as if we were supposed to document our tests in the module test phase.<br/><br/>So I wrote back to the project manager and asked what he expected for us to deliver. Since the test plan did not really specify. I reminded him that we were working on different platforms, with diverse tools etc. The Java programmer on the project concurred.<br/><br/>I did think about <b>TAP</b> when reading the response, but did not go into this.<br/><br/>So panick really struck the project manager, he even came by my desk.<br/><br/>So after some explaining he understood that the development was in good hands at least for the programming and configuration side. Since all people involved would test and document in their own format.<br/><br/>A business analyst working for 'Application & System Integration Development' stated that she was taking care of the integration test coordination and execution.<br/><br/>So we succeeded in calming down the project manager and we could go back to work.<br/><br/>So I looked at what I wanted to do and found out that I was not supposed to do any integration with the Java part until the Integration test, so happily I copied the examples from the Java Web service API specification, and mock... mock.. mock my tests are running as if there was a backend.<br/><br/>Man I love Perl and CPAN.<br/><br/>So my complete test suite can be called as if we are doing integration test or not.
