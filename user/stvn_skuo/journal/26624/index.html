<p><br><br><br/><br/>Years ago, after graduating from high school, I
considered joining the Marines as a means of
getting a college education.  &nbsp;&nbsp;
I went to the recruiting office and took the "written test" and was scheduled to take a physical exam weeks later. &nbsp;&nbsp;
The timely arrival of a college acceptance letter
with an offer of a scholarship diverted me away from the military.<br><br><br/><br/>Thinking back, I doubt I would have made it through boot camp.  &nbsp;&nbsp; I was fit and trim from having been on the swim team but I never did have the physique for any "real combat".<br><br><br/><br/>At the <em>Tomb of the Unknown Soldier</em> in Arlington National Cemetery, when I visited there on vacation, I saw The. Biggest. Guard. Ever. &nbsp;&nbsp;
He had a shaved head, crisp uniform, big stompy boots -- except that he barely made any sound as he patrolled back and forth -- and precise turns made while carrying a rifle. &nbsp;&nbsp;
Not the rat-tat-tat automatic weapon kind of rifle -- the kind with bolt-action that makes a satisfying click-click
sound (or so I imagine from seeing countless action movies, as I've never fired a gun).<br><br><br/><br/>What brought this to mind was seeing the funeral procession of William Rehnquist, the late Supreme Court Justice, on television this morning.&nbsp;&nbsp;
His pall bearers were his former clerks.  I'm not saying all his clerks eventually found desk jobs where their daily routine now involve lifting
items no heavier than a briefcase -- I'll just say that they seem a bit strained while transporting the casket.  &nbsp;&nbsp;Contrast that to the funeral of
Ronald Reagan, the 40th President, whose coffin was carried, seemingly effortlessly, by marching military guards.<br><br>
  
Either the recruiters for the armed forces have a great screening process to pick out the biggest, strongest guys, or they're putting steroids into MREs (yup, steroids).<br><br><br/><br/></p>

<h2>It takes determination</h2>

<p>I was never on any kind of sports team. I am 5'11" and when I went into bootcamp I was 220lbs of tub. I came out of bootcamp at a fit and trim 163lbs and you couldn't stop me. I ended up on the All Marine Judo team, went to the nationals, was meritoriously promoted while in the Marines, went through the first Gulf war and did 6 years before getting out.</p>

<p>I don't say this to brag. I say it to say that if a person has the determination to do something, it can be done.</p>

<p>I am very proud that I served.</p>

I went thru boot camp in the Army and then their infantry training. (for the National Guard)<br><br>Two years later I went thru the Air Force boot camp (active duty), which... compared to the Army training was essentially a paperwork drill.<br><br><i>I say it to say that if a person has the determination to do something, it can be done.</i><br><br>The reason I point out what I did was for point of reference.<br><br>If you went thru the Marine boot camp sixty pounds overweight... and survived... you were most determined indeed!<br><br>That is an accomplishment to be proud of, IMHO.
