<p><p>The majority of this week has been to start understanding the lay of the land in the Parrot world.  The first real obstacle seems to be the regular use of <code>void</code> pointers throughtout the code base.  This can make the code difficult to understand since you don't really know what's coming.  It also has the nasty side effect of preventing a true C++ compiler from compiling Parrot.</p>
<p>So, to begin, I created the following patches to begin the cleanup.</p>
<ul>
<li>RT #42107 [PATCH] Intel C++ is not gcc</li>
<li>RT #42110 [PATCH] Returning values from void functions</li>
<li>RT #42151 [PATCH] Assorted casting cleanups - part I</li>
<li>RT #42156 [PATCH] Make invoke() return opcode_t*</li>
</ul>
<p>All of the above were applied, although RT #42156 required some re-work on my part.</p>
<p>I also dug up the warnocked "RT #41837 [PATCH] integer overflow in include/parrot/sub.h" that had been submitted some time ago.  It fixes some integer overflow issues that the Sun compilers on Solaris x86 complain loudly about.</p>
<p>For the upcoming week, I see the cleanup of void pointers continuing.  I'm also looking into compiling on Borland C++ on Windows.  Borland can be much more strict than other compilers causing it to choke on things other compilers let past.  I should have an additional patch to help me out with Borland C++ tonight.  I also need to take a look at the segmentation faults I'm seeing when I test Parrot on Solaris.  I also need to test a couple of changes on HP-UX PA-RISC as well.  Finally, there have been some reported success of compiling Parrot on Cygwin.  I just need to work on those successes so that you don't have to be a regular on #parrot to compile successfully.</p></p>
