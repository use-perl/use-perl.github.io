<p><p>I was going to post <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/21684912@N00/69192836/"> this picture</a> as a response to the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hfb/56871376/">dog who ate tuits</a>.  Unfortunately, Simba (the cat) has decided to eat tuits in a very bad way.  Two evenings ago, he somehow got out of the house, and has disappeared.  Being an inside cat all of his life, sneaking out is never a good thing. With Winter now here with snow and near zero F wind-chills, this has been made a lot worse.  My hope right now is that he is in someone's garage and just hasn't had the chance to escape yet.  I'll stick with that for now.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong>  Simba was found under a bush a block away from our house by a woman who was putting up her Christmas lights.  I'll have to find out which house, since I thought I had looked through every pine tree and bush in a couple block range.</p></p>

Glad you found him -- I've had a cat vanish and it's not fun.  (Mine vanished twice -- once for a week, and once for I think 18 days)
