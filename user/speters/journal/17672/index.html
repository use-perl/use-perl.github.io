<p>Either the Perl-QA mailing list is down, or it just doesn't like where I'm sending my mail from, because my emails just don't seem to the making the list.  Well, not seeing an obvious Test:: module that would work for me to make sure 
that two references referred to the same thing, I wrote my own module.  
Before sending it off to CPAN, I'd like to see what you all think of it.  
Also, I have a couple of questions.  First, the module includes some XS, 
which is unusual for Test:: modules.  Do you think I should split my code 
into two modules (say Devel::References::Same and Test::References) or keep 
it the way it is.  Second, I'm not particularly in love with the names 
Test::Reference with the function "references_same".  I was thinking of 
Test::References::Same as a possible name for the module, but then I at a 
loss of what to call the function.  references_same_ok?  I'd appreciate your 
thoughts.<br/><br/>NAME
       Test::Reference - Check to see if two references refer to the same
       variable
 
SYNOPSIS
           use Test::Reference;
 
           my $val1 = 5;
           my $val2 = 5;
 
           my $a = \$val1;
           my $b = \$val1;
           my $c = \$val2;
 
           references_same($a, $b, "Will return ok");
           references_same($a, $c, "Will return not ok");
 
DESCRIPTION
       This modules allows you to test to see if two references refer to the
       same variable or not.<br/><br/>FUNCTIONS
       "references_same( $ref1, $ref2, $mesg)"
 
       Checks to see that the two references are references and that they both
       refer to the same underlying variable.

<h2>Stringified references don't work?</h2>

I am curious how you ended up using XS---I figure there must be a good story about that.  Did comparing them as strings not work for some reason?<blockquote><div> <tt>use Test::More tests =&gt; 3;<br>
&nbsp; <br>my $a = 5;<br>my $b = \$a;<br>my $c = \$a;<br>my $d = \$b;<br>
&nbsp; <br>my $e = [];<br>
&nbsp; <br>is( $b, $c, "Same scalar data" );<br>isnt( $b, $d, "Not the same" );<br>isnt( $c, $e, "Not the same" );</tt> </div></blockquote> <p> <br>As for names, I would go for Test::Ref, since the Perl operator is ref().</p>

<tt>It does OK with scalars, but some of the other reference types, no.<br> <br>For example,<br> <br>use warnings;<br>use strict;<br>use Test::More tests =&gt; 2;<br> <br>my $val1 = qr/foo/;<br>my $val2 = qr/foo/;<br> <br>$a = $val1;<br>$b = $val1;<br>$c = $val2;<br> <br>diag ref $a;<br>diag ref $b;<br>diag ref $c;<br> <br>is($a, $b);<br>isnt($a, $c);</tt>

<h2>A whole module for ... ?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/merlyn/">merlyn</a> on 2004-02-28T15:39:55</h3>
<blockquote><div> <tt>ref $a and ref $b and $a == $b</tt> </div></blockquote>That seems a bit heavy.

Well, if you want to do it the easy way...yeah, this works.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br/><br/>Thanks

<h2>What problem were you solving?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/petdance/">petdance</a> on 2004-02-29T01:09:40</h3>
What's the problem that you were solving?  I'm thinking that maybe this reference matching is really a different problem.

<p>I am testing to ensure that an object returned by a function is actually the same object received by a previous call to this function.  In OO terms, I testing to make sure a class is a Singleton.</p>
<p>I tried the XS route, until Randal's suggestion above, because I needed the address of what the <code>RV*</code>'s were pointing to.  The new route of <code>is((ref $a &amp;&amp; ref $b &amp;&amp; $a == $b), 1)</code> isn't pretty, but it works just fine.  Also, I got a good look at how <code>Test::Builder</code> and <code>Test::Builder::Tester</code> work, so I wouldn't say my little exercise was a total waste of time.  A cleaned up version of the <code>is</code> above might be nice, but I doubt if there are people clammoring for a new module to come out of that.</p>
