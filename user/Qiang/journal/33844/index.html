<p>well, I love to try out different kind of food. I even build a restaurant review website ( <a href="http://www.goodspot.ca">http://www.goodspot.ca</a> ) that is dedicated to the local restaurants so that i can find the best one right from my fingertips. :)<br/><br/>the site was built using CGI::Application, Template-Toolkit as an excuse to learn more about writing perl webapp. <br/><br/>it has been 6 months since i last touched the codebase. now i finally got some time and urge to make it work better (at least for me :)<br/><br/>the first thing i want to do is to refactor the code to make it easy to extend. currently it is one big module (Main.pm) that uses other module and handle all front-end requests. it is hard to maintain and i can't put the whole thing into my head. <br/><br/>the next thing would be to improve the current functionalities and adding more features. I have been thinking of it and i find it to be harder than the coding :D<br/><br/>on a whim, how many of you run a site like this? would be interested to know your experience. I know Dave Rolsky runs the <URL:http://www.vegguide.org></p>

I was surprised to find it wasn't in Mason.  : )



<h2>Open Source? Collaboration?</h2>

I'm in Ottawa and I'm going to pass your site onto my friends in the GTA, it's very slick.<br><br>I was looking to build a similar site but for rating something other than restaurants. Are you interested in sharing the code/collaborating on your code?<br><br>I have a few years experience working with CGI::Application and TT2.<br><br>Clayton<br><br>

thanks for your interest.<br><br>as i mentioned earlier, the code is bit mess. the first thing i want to do is to put in a built system so that it is easier to install and start running.<br><br>give me few week and i will provide you a link to the src tarball.
