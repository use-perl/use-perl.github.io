<p>We just got a push from <a href=apress.com>APress</a> that they will be glad to donate perl books to our members who contributing the <a href=http://wiki.perlchina.org/main/show/HomePage>'perlchina translation' </a>project. 
<p>
a little backgroud, We have translated about 30 articles since January perlchina started and more are coming. In return of showing appreciation for their effor, we decide to pick 4 or 5 best translated articles every two months and give the translator a Perl book/t-shirt/mug . but the fund is limited and APress 's donation is definitely a big help.<p>

this is the first time I have involved in building an online community. since january, we have gathered a small community of chinese perl users around perlchina. It's been exciting. But I have heard too many communities died out for one reason or another and I keep wondering how we can survive and seeking advice. <p>

we have the <a href=http://wiki.perlchina.org/main/show/HomePage>wiki site</a> for translation collaboration. forum for member communication. I am going to set up a newsletter to keep other less frequent users updated. hmm, it would be nice to hear how perlmonks becomes what it is now.<p>

oh by the way, the translated article i like the most is  <a href=http://wiki.perlchina.org/main/show/brian's%20Guide%20to%20Solving%20Any%20Perl%20Problem>"brian's Guide to Solving Any Perl Problem"</a> it's in chinese<p>

I wish someone could give me a link to that article when i started learning perl or programming. (even so, that article wouldn't have born yet :)</p>
