<div class="span8">
<p>I have been having this urge of using a wiki written in Perl for PerlChina. We used instiki(in ruby) before moving to mediawiki(in PHP). Reason why we use mediawiki is because Instiki was not stable at the time, Yahoo China happens to run few mediawiki for other OSS sites so it is easy for them to adopt us. <br/><br/>We need a wiki for collaborating on local meetup, communication between members for projects and hosting Chinese documentations, well there is a lot we can put in use with a wiki. Since we are a Perl user group and eating own dog food makes a lot of sense. <br/><br/>A good wiki in my book should be easy to install and maintain. has spam protection and ACL control. good web interface for managing wiki. should be file based and easy to customize through template. Personally I rate dokuwiki highly. pmwiki is not bad either. <br/><br/>Perl Wiki that comes closed to what I want are foswiki (twiki fork) and ikiwiki. foswiki has lots features but It doesn't have a good reputation for code quality. Ikiwiki is ok but it took me much more time to have it up and running than either dokuwiki or pmwiki. And it has much smaller community than the other two and fewer features. If I had to pick a perl wiki, I would have to go with ikiwiki.<br/><br/>Keep in mind, We don't get root access on the system and the way PHP wiki drop in and just work just makes me envy. Why can't we have something like that?  oh.. I digress.<br/><br/>enough rant. I go back to mediawiki.<br/><br/><b>UPDATE:</b> I should mention that oddmuse is also a good choice. It is very easy to install, stable with lots plug-ins.</p>

I've installed it on a clients intranet and so far its been well received.

<p>I am aware of MojoMojo. But it certainly doesn't meet my requirements - good feature set  but installation is no comparison to any of the wikis I mentioned.</p>

Yes unfortunately MojoMojo uses Catalyst / DBIx:Class so it is a big beast<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-(
<br> <br>
Still if u like something sweet &amp; small then u could do it 11 lines using the Squatting web microframework...  <a href="http://github.com/beppu/squatting/blob/master/eg/MicroWiki.pm" title="github.com">http://github.com/beppu/squatting/blob/master/eg/MicroWiki.pm</a github.com>
<br> <br>
In all seriousness I have been thinking of writing a lightweight file based Wiki using Squatting.  There is already a "fledging" Wiki app in Squatting example directory...  <a href="http://cpansearch.perl.org/src/BEPPU/Squatting-0.52/eg/Wiki.pm" title="perl.org">http://cpansearch.perl.org/src/BEPPU/Squatting-0.52/eg/Wiki.pm</a perl.org>

<h2>Try November</h2>

Right now it does not meet any of your requirements,
but you can improve it and contribute a lot back!

<p>I'm also looking for a Perl-based wiki.  So far ikiwiki has met my requirements (see <a href="http://ikiwiki.info/" title="ikiwiki.info">http://ikiwiki.info/</a ikiwiki.info> ):</p><ul>
<li>It's a "wiki preprocessor".  Given a filesystem full of source files, it will generate static HTML for publishing.  It's blosxomy in this regard.</li><li>It uses an existing revision control system, such as git or svn, to track changes.</li><li>It may run as a commit hook, so people can make changes by way of the filesystem and commits.</li><li>It includes a<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.cgi file so that edits may be made online.</li><li>It's pluggable, and it's not hard to write new plugins.</li><li>It is filesystem based, and it provides ways to auto-index subdirectories and their contents.</li></ul><p>Drawbacks:</p><ul>
<li>Difficult to install.  No CPAN distribution.</li><li>Ugly by default.  Not a lot of skins.  But at least it's skinnable by default.</li><li>Probably others, depending on preferences.</li></ul>

<p>have you try oddmuse? It is also a good choice. very easy to install and stable with lots plug-ins.</p>

<p>Thank you.  I haven't realy looked at oddmuse, but I will.</p><p>I glanced at it while looking for a new wiki, but I passed on it when I saw that it was based on UseMod.  I already use UseMod at <a href="http://poe.perl.org/" title="perl.org">http://poe.perl.org/</a perl.org> so I assumed oddmuse would be similar.  On your recommendation, I took a deeper look, and it seems I was mistaken.</p>

<p>oddmuse is based on usemod. <a href="http://www.oddmuse.org/cgi-bin/oddmuse/What_Is_Oddmuse" title="oddmuse.org">http://www.oddmuse.org/cgi-bin/oddmuse/What_Is_Oddmuse</a oddmuse.org></p><p>regardless of one big perl file, it meets my requirements. a real world example of oddmuse is emacswiki and it seems to be running fine. <a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/" title="emacswiki.org">http://www.emacswiki.org/</a emacswiki.org></p>

<p>It's dead easy to install on Debian, it just goes in automatically from the command line and it works really well. It is ugly out of the box but as you say it's dead easy to change it.</p>

<h2>pmwiki</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/stu42j/">stu42j</a> on 2009-02-02T15:56:36</h3>
<p>If you can't find a Perl wiki you like, PmWiki might be a good compromise since it is written by a Perl hacker.</p>
