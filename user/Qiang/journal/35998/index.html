<p>I finally decided to take some time off from work and visit my parent in china.  It has been 5 years since my last visit -- 2003 during the SARS breakout.<br/><br/>one of the main reasons is to try to help out the family business(printing). the business has been growing steadily and expanded to other cities.  as the only son in the family, my choice is to at least try it out before giving it up.  so I am going to be in beijing and possibly shanghai for a while. <br/><br/>if i get the time, I may have chances to try out some ideas:
	* write and host applications like the 37signals guys
	* resume a webapp ( a rewrite based on my goodspot.ca but more features )<br/><br/>also meet up with the people from perlchina.<br/><br/>it will be interesting!</p>

<p>I'm interested to know more about <a href="http://www.perlchina.org/" title="perlchina.org">perlchina</a perlchina.org>.
Is it an active group? (The site was last updated in 2005, it seems.)</p>

weird that i didn't receive any email about comments  like i used to. <p>

anyway, there aren't much activities on the website, except the BBS. we did 2 (maybe 3) times workshops in beijing last 2 years.</p><p>

there are perl usages and users that i am aware of in cities like beijing and shanghai. in fact, shanghai has more perl users than in beijing. if perlchina seems to be quiet, that's because there is no one taking the lead. but the interest on perl is definitely there.</p>

if my memories serve me right, you were participating an opensource translation project in a university.. if i was wrong, please introduce yourself.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) if you are in beijing/shanghai, maybe we can get together for a beer.
