<h1>YAPC vs Workshop</h1>
<h2><a href="/user/Qiang/">Qiang</a> on 2008-09-17T15:40:41</h2>
</div> <!-- /span4 -->


<div class="span8">
<p>I am just curious of the difference between naming a conference YAPC or Workshop.. to me, i feel that a workshop is a smaller size(around 100) than a YAPC. besides YAPC::Euro, YAPC::Asia and YAPC::NA, all i see is workshop, workshop and workshop. (okay, there seem to be a YAPC::Brasil happening)<br/><br/>do one have to get permission to use the word YAPC in their conference?<br/><br/>oh, by the way, Nov 8th, 2008 perlchina is planning a Beijing Perl Workshop or we can call it YAPC::Beijing or YAPC::China. You name it...</p>


<hr/>



<h2>YAPC::China?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/hanekomu/">hanekomu</a> on 2008-09-17T19:51:57</h3>
<p>I don't think you need permission to call it a "YAPC". Maybe a talk given by Philippe Bruhat (BooK) at YAPC::Europe 2008, <a href="http://yapc.tv/2008/ye/lt/lt2-05-book-perl-conferences/" title="yapc.tv">All the Perl conferences in the world</a yapc.tv>, is interesting for you.</p><p>As for the name, I think I would prefer "YAPC::China". That way you could have the YAPC in different cities each year and still call it "YAPC::China".</p><p>It's great that the Chinese Perl mongers have a YAPC now as well. And please tell us more about the conference - where is it, when, what talks there are, and, afterwards, how it was.</p><p>Have a fun and successful conference!</p>

<p>Well, if the name is as straightforward as "Chinese Perl Workshop", it still can be applied when you move the event to another city. Thus this  is not the feature of YAPCs. For example, look at German Perl Workshops (http://www.perl-workshop.de/en/index.html), they are moving each year.</p>

<h2>RTFM :-)</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/andy.sh/">andy.sh</a> on 2008-09-18T05:11:10</h3>
<p>There is an (old) article on TPF website which clearly explains the differences:<br><a href="http://news.perlfoundation.org/2007/04/perl_events_great_and_small.html" title="perlfoundation.org">http://news.perlfoundation.org/2007/04/perl_events_great_and_small.html</a perlfoundation.org></p><p>By the way, your question is a kind of questions which could be included into the FAQ for event organizers<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-) When I started to organized my first workshop in Moscow, I was asking the same; the same was asked by the organizers of the first workshop in Zagreb.</p>

oh, thanks for the link. that answered my question. we are going to have a 'Beijing Perl Workshop' as planned!

<h2>timezones!</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/domm/">domm</a> on 2008-09-18T14:06:26</h3>
Hm, Beijing is happening on 8th nov, and the Twin City PWS on 7th and 8th. If I remember the timezone difference correctly, we might have some overlap. Let's all meet on IRC for an Vienna/Bratislava/&#229;&#338;&#8212;&#228;&#186;&#172; Perl Workshop. Maybe we can also get some live video streams up &amp; running (as we did some years ago together with the French Perl Workshop)

<p>You were successful as I remember with the Japanese for Moose on use.perl.org, posting the Chinese characters.</p>

sounds interesting! looks like china is 6 hours ahead of vienna. if live video is doable, i can think of a lighting talk around 5pm beijing time<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
