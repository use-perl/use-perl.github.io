<div class="span8">
<p>today i went to the <a href="http://xrl.us/orp8i/">beijing software freedom day (SFD)</a>. hosted in ThoughtWorks office in beijing. there were another SFD hosted in different location at the same time. <a href="http://softwarefreedomday.org/">SFD</a> is to celebrate software freedom and promote open source and is happening around the world.<p>

there were about 70 (<b>UPDATE:</b> 130+ people) people attended and several talks and panel discussions presented. i got an opportunity to plug the coming beijing perl workshop in front of everyone. i also held my first panel discussion on 'open source localization and document translation', mozilla localization, wikipedia translation and i18n-zh project and more were discussed.<p>

SFD is a half day event. we finished it around 5:30pm then free books were given to speakers and a last minute talk on GIS was had.<p>

18 of us headed off for some chinese food after SFD. food was good but i spent most of the time talking to sun's oss community manager and a ex-military self-learned game developer.<p>

all in all, it was good time and i really enjoyed it. nice to see OSS movement like this happening in china. </p>
