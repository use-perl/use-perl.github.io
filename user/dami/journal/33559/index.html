The results and final report of the "Plat_forms" international 
programming contest were released yesterday in a press conference
in Nuremberg, and will be published today June 20th, 2007 on
<URL:http://www.plat-forms.org>.
</p>

<p>
For each of the categories Perl, PHP and Java, three teams
of three people each competed to produce a comprehensive
"social networking" application in just 30 hours.
</p>

<p>
Team Etat de GenÃÂ¨ve / Optaros was declared winner of the Perl
track. The Geneva solution, based on 
<code>Catalyst</code> and <code>DBIx::DataModel</code>, was
especially praised for its compactness. However, other Perl solutions
by "plusW" (Germany) and "Revolution Systems" (USA) were very close,
and it was hard for the jury to decide.  The report notes that
compactness and extensibility are consistent qualities of the Perl
solutions.
</p>

<p>
For the Geneva team, that was a really instructive experience.
It confirmed that we work with the right technology and skills
... but also showed that we still have some progress to make 
as a team in the priorization and quality insurance processes!
</p>

<p>
See <URL:http://www.plat-forms.org> for the complete report 
and for many interesting observations on these 3 development
platforms. A detailed report of what happened in Geneva 
team is published on 
<URL:http://www.plat-forms.org/2007/blog/archive/2007/01/29/journal-of-team1>
