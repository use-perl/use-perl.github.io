<p>So, a while back on the London.pm mailing list there was a certain amount of fear and loathing about Perl 6 and its development process.
<p>
I don't think the Perl 6 process is scary. I think the work that's been done so far is inspiring, so I took my replies on that thread, polished 'em up and turned them into an article, which you should be able to read on perl.com tomorrow.
<p>
I've enabled comments on this journal entry, if you want to comment on the article, you can do it here.</p>

Great article Piers.  Although some of the 'obvious' Perl6 code examples weren't exactly obvious to me I suspect that's more to do with a lack of grounding in the area - 'currying' is what I do to gravy beef...<br> <br><br/><br/>I feel more comfortable now with Perl 6 but have't put the Programming Ruby book back on the top shelf just yet.

Thanks a lot, I enjoyed writing it (it almost wrote itself...)
<p>
I have the pickaxe book around here somewhere and it's great. Must learn more about Ruby, if only so I can steal ideas and stick 'em back in Perl 6 modules. and if it all goes pear shaped, at least I'll be able to program in another cool language.
</p><p>
As for understanding the 'obvious' code, once you get the tao of the 'assertion' example, you'll be a long way to understanding currying and a bunch of other stuff. The trouble is, if I'd taken the time to explain everything it would have really killed the pace of the article and rather blunted the argument.</p>
