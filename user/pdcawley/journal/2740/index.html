Trying to stop semantic drift in this case is a completely losing battle.  One might as well have tried to stop "nice" from changing meaning from "silly" (at one time, its only meaning) to its current meaning of "pleasant".

... or my personal favorite, "don't like" as a synonym for "dislike".  Phooey!

Um... 'nice' has never meant 'silly'. It's precise meaning is 'precise'. And I still occasionally use it in that sense. But only rarely.
<br>
<br>And yes, I know it's a losing battle, but there's no harm in saying something.

Did you check the OED before disagreeing with TorgoX on a linguistic point?  Meaning number 1 of nice is "Foolish, stupid, senseless", common in the 14th and 15th centuries.<br> <br>Perhaps you're claiming that it never meant "silly" because "silly" really means "Deserving of pity, compassion, or sympathy"?

.....don't forget 'leveraging'!

For some reason I have less of a problem with that particular piece of verbing. It's not as if 'to leverage' had a meaning before it got appropriated to mean 'to use an existing thing to help achieve some other goal', or whatever. The neologism is so handy dammit.
<br>
<br>But 'methodology' is using an existing word and suffix and giving the resulting word a meaning that's at odds with the usual meaning of the suffix. And to add insult to injury there's already a perfectly good, two syllable word ('approach', or maybe even just 'method') that carries the appropriate meaning.
<br>
<br>Apart from that it's fine.
