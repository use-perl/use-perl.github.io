<p>So, yesterday we were working on a timetable app that you could query to find out the next bus due at a given stop. Right now we're working on loading up the timetable data (which can get surprisingly complicated; dealing with term times, bank holidays, sunday/saturday services...), and to make life easier we came up with the idea of a 'period' object which could hold the period for which a given timetable was valid.<br/><br/>This got implemented on top of Set::IntSpan, using Time::Piece objects for dates (which were then converted into 'days since 1/1/1970' inside the Period class).<br/><br/>All was going swimmingly until my pair mentioned that periods extending out to, say, 2099 were not desperately uncommon. A swift check of Time::Piece later we start looking for something that can handle dates outside the Unix era. It looks like Date::Simple is going to be our puppy. It suffers from the Y10K issue, but I think we're safe from that for now.<br/><br/>And on closer inspection, it looks like it fits our needs better anyway, no silly worrying about seconds.<br/><br/>Thank heavens for abstration. It's going to be almost trivial to replace Time::Piece with Date::Simple. Just a shame we didn't realise <em>before</em> we did the Time::Piece work... </p>

This doesn't help you much, but I definitely want to get some tuits to look into replacing Time::Piece's internal representation to using TAI, so that it can go to the year billion or whatever it goes to.

That's great news.
