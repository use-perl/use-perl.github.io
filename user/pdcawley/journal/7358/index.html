<p>I got some good news last night.<br/><br/>As you may know, I've been writing Perl 6 summaries, which I've been posting to the mailing lists, and which O'Reilly have been publishing on the the perl.com website. The reason that they haven't been published here on use.perl.org is that ORA will pay for exclusive content.<br/><br/>My plan was that I'd get them to pay my fee for the summaries directly to The Perl Foundation and I'd get to give the summaries back to the community <em>and</em> make some money to support Larry at the same time. <br/><br/>However, this proved a little tricky as O'Reilly weren't set up to be able to make the payments directly to TPF, they'd have to pay me and then I'd donate the money. But having the money cross the pond twice, shedding bank fees and commission in both directions just seemed silly.<br/><br/>So, last night I got word from Gnat that ORA have sorted out what needs to be done and payments for the perl 6 summaries will start flowing to the Perl Foundation. Hurrah!<br/><br/>And, this morning, I find that Dave Cross has written a 'linkshortener' for me. Life is good.</p>

<h2>Another good news</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/rafael/">rafael</a> on 2002-08-28T09:10:39</h3>
Robert <a href="http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2002-08/msg01449.html" title="mpe.mpg.de">fixed the problem</a mpe.mpg.de> that caused some messages from the
perl.org mailing lists to not show up on groups.google.com.<p>About this new payment facility to TPF -- probably they can do something for other authors wanting to contribute money to the fund. (Considering moving my P5P summaries to perl.com also... -- event though they're lower quality than yours.)</p>
