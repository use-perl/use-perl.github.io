<p>I spent the morning getting the new <a href="http://www.iterative-software.com/training/>training dates</a> up on our website, and hanging out on the <tt>#perl-help</tt> channel on irc.rhizomatic.net answering questions (or in one case, failing to answer the question but hopefully pointing the questioner in a fruitful direction...). 
<p>
Being helpful is deeply satisfying. Here's hoping I don't start getting impatient. Back when there were just the three of us at the old ISP, I ended up doing frontline technical support (along with everyone else), and you can only last so long before you want to kill some of your more annoying clients. If you ever reach the point where you phone a helpline and they recognize your voice, then the odds are good that the helpdesk people want your head on a platter.

<b>Perl proverbs revisited</b>
<p>
Forgive me for writing a paper in public, but I'd appreciate feedback on this stuff. Let's take a look at some of the proverbs I posted here yesterday.
<blockquote><tt>use strict;</tt></blockquote>
I hope this one is self explanatory. Unless you really are just writing a quick and dirty script that will never need to be extended or maintained in the future, then the hoops you have to jump through to make the code work with <tt>use strict;</tt> will mean you should have a much easier time later.
<blockquote>Learn about references</blockquote>
References are the gateway to much that is cool about Perl. `Real' datastructures, which can make your programming life <em>so</em> much easier, are built using references.<p>
Programming techniques like function, or object oriented programming are nearly impossible without some understanding of references. The list goes on.

<blockquote>Even when you're the only programmer, you're a member of a team.</blockquote>
"Hunh? How'd you work that out?"<p>
Well, it's like this. Except on very rare occasions you'll always go back and maintain your code. And in the time between now and then, you'll have learnt more stuff. Or forgotten more stuff. You'll almost certainly have forgotten the fine detail of how your program worked. In a very real sense you won't be the same you that wrote the program.
<p>
Now, if you've written the program as if you were a member of a team, then you should have used things like unambiguous variable and function names. You'll have commented your code sparsely and sensibly, being careful to document intent. You won't have used over complex syntax/algorithms simply for the sake of it. You won't have to remember the precise meaning and name of a million and one global variables.
<p>
This means that when you come to repair or extend your program you won't have to remember (or work out) as much stuff to solve your problem, you'll be able to fix things up with some confidence that doing so won't break something somewhere else. If you're <em>really</em> disciplined you'll even have a test suite to make sure of this. And you'll have added extra tests to confirm that the code you've added does what it's supposed to do.
<p>
All of this is stuff that you would (should?) have done if you were working in a larger team, so cultivate the good habits while you're working alone.
<p>
There's another sense in which all Perl programmers are part of a team. CPAN. Because of the generosity of other programmers you get to draw on their experience. For free. Be team spirited, if you find a bug and fix it, send patches back to the maintainer. If you've done something that's really handy, upload it to CPAN. Because you've been programming like you're a member of a team, you'll have something that is easy for others to use.
<p>
See, it all makes sense.</p>
