<p>So, I just went through the .com rite of passage and got downsized, but I'm not down about it. I'm hoping to get some freelance writing gigs and maybe the odd consulting day (but I'm <em>so</em> not banking on that consulting thing) and, what with one thing and another we should be okay. <br/><br/>But, it means Gill and I actually have some time on our hands. And Gill has her newly discovered big sister in Michigan. And YAPC's in Boca in June. And TPC is in Portland in July. And...<br/><br/>ROAD TRIP!<br/><br/>The only thing that's planned so far are the start and end dates (and places), at least one of the intermediate destinations, and a plan to spend some time in the Appalacians in search of some real(ish) mountain music.<br/><br/>If anyone can offer a bed for a night or two for a couple of Brits doing Boca->Michigan->Portland with laptop, view camera and rental car I'd be really pleased to hear about it.</p>

If you're coming as far up as VT I can probably provide both accomodation and consulting...

It is rather out of our way I'm afraid (much as I love the bits of New England I've seen), the plan (such as it currently is) is to head up in pretty much a straight line to Michigan, then drop back down to Chicago, on to Minneapolis/St Paul and then on through one of the Dakotas, over the rockies and then possibly heading to Portland via Seattle.<br> <br>However, looking at the map, it looks like a longer, but more rewarding and with less doubling back, route would involve driving a large chunk of the length of the Appalachians with detours for some of Washington, Philadelphia, NY, Boston and then up into Canada, around the top of the Great Lakes, down through Michigan and back onto the previously mentioned route.<br> <br>Pretty much our only fixed points at the moment are Boca Raton for YAPC, a couple of days in Fort Gratiot, MI to see family, and Portland for TPC.<br> <br>That leaves us with a fair amount of time in between. Given that the US is so staggeringly big by comparison to the UK I'm really not sure how long the driving part of that trip would take us, especially given that we don't want to spend all our time charging along freeways.

If you want to know driving times try
<a href="http://www.mapquest.com/" title="mapquest.com">Map Quest</a mapquest.com> as it has fairly decent estimates
for driving in the northern countries in North
America.

I think that might just be too insane even for me. And Gill just drew the line at three technical conferences in one year.<br> <br>Shame though.<br> <br>Mapquest is very cool though, I've already punched in the possible extended route and it looks like it's vaguely doable.
