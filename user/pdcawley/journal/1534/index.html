<p>join them and tell the world about your choice of listening. <br/><br/>None of this modern poppy muck for me. You can take your Cure and New Order, but give me trad. English song and trad. English singers and I'm a happy man. Oh yes, and radio 4 comedy. So, for the past few days I've had Kate Rusby, I'm Sorry I Haven't A Clue, Nic Jones, Just a Minute and, um, an American rock band called The Rainmakers (consistency? What's that?) on heavy rotation. And it's been lovely.<br/><br/>Oh yes, and the odd burst of Peter Cook. (And on one, faintly bizarre, occasion XMMS served up Damian's <i>Life, the Universe and Everything</i> talk.)<br/><br/>I can't rave enough about Kate Rusby though. I first heard her sing at Beverley festival and I remember thinking that she had a pretty voice (and was gorgeous to look at), but she hadn't quite grown into her material. A few years later I heard Sleepless and oh boy, had she ever grown into the material. She has the most beautiful voice and a deep understanding and appreciation of the big ballads that she sings. Just lovely. Up there with June Tabor, Maddy Prior and Norma Waterson.<br/><br/>Ahem. Rave over.</p>

<h2>Cure</h2>

I worry when people call the Cure modern - I mean, it's a band that's only a year older than me (couple of years if you take into account their time as "The Easy Cure").
<br>
<br>As for pop - um. Not really =)

In the context I'm talking about 'Modern' means 'written this century'. A lot of the stuff that Rusby sings was old when J F Child started to publish his collection of border ballads in the late 1800s.
<br>
<br>The Old Songs are just wonderful. Dark, gruesome shading into moments of staggering beauty. Listen to Pete Morton singing <i>Tamlyn</i>, Sinead O'Connor doing <i>I am stretched on your grave</i> (and going a long way over the top admittedly...) or (my favourite) Norma Waterson singing almost anything.
<br>
<br>Or listen to some American traditional music. Stanley Carter's reading of <i>O Death</i> from the <i>O Brother Where Art Thou</i> soundtrack for instance is just stunning.
<br>
<br>I confess I could go on about this for ever. Maybe I'll put a 'download this and blow your mind with traditional music' collection of MP3s together and let the address slip on IRC or something... But not quite yet.

Out of the stuff I have convenient, I do appear to have that Stanley Carter track (gf bought the CD).
<br>
<br>It's nice - but not what I'd want to listen to except when listening *to* it. i.e. it's not stuff I'd work to, play to, whatever to. Doesn't mean it's shite though =) Just deserves special attention.

<h2>Folk Music</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/davorg/">davorg</a> on 2001-12-07T10:19:08</h3>
<p>Actually my tastes are a little wider than just 80s indie bands (as Piers knows). The previous CD on heavy rotation was <i>The History of Fairport Convention</i>. For several mornings,
my neighbours had to put up with me singing
<a href="http://www.informatik.uni-hamburg.de/user/zierke/sandy.denny/songs/mattygroves.html" title="uni-hamburg.de">Matty Groves</a uni-hamburg.de> or <a href="http://www.mixed-up.com/lyrics/folk/hare.html" title="mixed-up.com">The Bonny Black Hare</a mixed-up.com> (warning: adult content) on my walk to the tube station.</p>
<p>Now, I realise that Fairport Convention aren't
<i>completely</i> traditional (they tend to take
traditional songs and re-interpret them in a more modern setting) but I really like a lot of the more traditional stuff too. The aforementioned <a href="http://www.purerecords.demon.co.uk/" title="demon.co.uk">Ms. Rusby</a demon.co.uk> is one of my favourites, and I'm pretty much guaranteed to love anything by the <a href="http://www.folkicons.co.uk/wcart.htm" title="folkicons.co.uk">Waterson/Carthy</a folkicons.co.uk> clan.</p>
<p>English folk music is sometimes overshadowed by it's Celtic neigbours, but there are some real gems if you look for them.</p>

I prefer <i>Little Musgrave</i> to <i>Matty Groves</i> to be honest. The tune seems to cut against the subject matter if that makes any sense.
