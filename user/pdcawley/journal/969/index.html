<div class="span8">
<p>Of course, I don't expect him to change his mind after reading this,
but what the hell, here goes.<br/><br/>Pudge says that we (I'm taking this to mean 'the US') cannot withdraw
from the middle east because:<br/><br/>"1. We do not give terrorists what they want."<br/><br/>Not true. A single successful terrorist attack in Beirut caused the US
to pull all their troops out of the Lebanon, sending the clear message
that terrorism works. <br/><br/>"2. We do not abandon our friends, and shall never abandon our allies"<br/><br/>Tell that to Manuel Noriega, Osama Bin Laden, The Taliban, Saddam
Hussein...<br/><br/>Okay, none of those people are exactly shining examples of humanity,
but they were all, at one time or another friends or allies of the US,
which does rather give the lie to Pudge's assertion.<br/><br/>"3. We use our alliances to further our own vital interests."<br/><br/>No denying that one. That's what alliances are for after all. Of
course, the US record of doing the Right Thing in its foreign policy
is somewhat patchy. Quite whether the Land of the Free should have
involved itself in, for example, toppling the democratically elected
(but left leaning) government of Chile is open to question. Especially
when the replacement was a mass murderer who makes Bin Laden look like
an amateur.<br/><br/>But I speak as a native of a nation that got rich on the back of the
slave trade, the ruthless exploitation of India and of the rest of the
Empire along with a whole host of other crimes about which we are
deeply embarrassed (and, in the case of our behaviour in Ireland at
least, for which we are still reaping the whirlwind). So I'm standing
on dodgy ground if I start using History as a stick with which to beat
the US.<br/><br/>Pudge continues: <br/><br/>"So while we are not doing anything wrong, we also are doing what is
right for our friends and allies, and what is right for us."<br/><br/>Now, this is the meat of it. It all depends on what you mean by wrong.
In the world at large, America is sometimes perceived as a 600 pound
gorilla with a big stick. (Where does it sit? Anywhere it likes.)
American foreign policy is little liked at the best of times, seeming
to sacrifice morality and human rights in the pursuit of the mighty
dollar and the comfort of the voters back home.<br/><br/>In the middle east it gives massive aid to Israel, another state whose
record is, um, spotty. In recent weeks and months, Israel has been
involved in a program of assassinating Palestinian leaders, both
military and civil. One can quibble about whether this is strictly
terrorism, or merely state sponsored murder. Pudge (on irc) seems to
think it's a legitimate act of war, but Israel has not declared war on
anyone, which makes that a somewhat interesting position to hold.<br/><br/>Israel's actions are roundly condemned by almost everyone as the
massive breaches of human rights that they are, but still the US pumps
aid into the country. Is it any wonder that almost everyone else in
the region hates them for it? Of course, when the traditional arab/jew
antipathy is added to the mix, it all gets even nastier, but even
without that antipathy there are reasons to question America's
unstinting support.<br/><br/>Remember, by the way that what counts here (if you want to build a
lasting peace) is the *perception*. This perception may well be
incorrect, but stomping around saying "You're wrong!" is no way to win
friends; you have to address people's concerns on their terms.<br/><br/>All that said, I don't advocate withdrawing from the middle east. That
would be absolutely the Wrong Thing to do. There have been times in
the past when I've been of the opinion that we (Britain) should just
wash our hands of the whole Northern Ireland situation and just let
the murderous bastards get on with killing each other, but to do that
would have been to avoid the responsibility we had for helping to
create the mess in the first place.<br/><br/>So what should we do?<br/><br/>It always surprises me that the US doesn't even appear to learn from
its own history. The US attained its independence from Britain by
ruthlessly exploiting their home advantage. They didn't have supply
lines to worry about, and they were sensible enough to try and avoid
pitched battles in favour of a guerilla war that sapped the morale of
the British troops who were a long way from home fighting an entire
people. There's no wonder that we lost.<br/><br/>Just like there's no wonder that the US lost in Vietnam.<br/><br/>Afghanistan makes Vietnam look like a walk in the park. Nobody has
successfully conquered and held the country since Alexander, and
Alexander was *very* clever in his approach -- he offered the people
of Afghanistan full Greek citizenship, with all that that entailed.
And being a greek wasn't a bad gig. Many of the volunteers fighting in
his army by the time he reached Afghanistan were natives of the lands
he'd conquered on the way there. <br/><br/>Everyone since has bounced off Afghanistan. Hard. We couldn't do it
and we had machine guns, rifles and a professional army that'd beaten
almost everything else the world could throw at it (except for you
lot, but the supply lines thing made a *big* difference). Russia
couldn't do it and they had tanks and all the other paraphenalia of a
modern army (well, not as modern as the US army, but still way better
equipped than the Taliban)<br/><br/>Bombs aren't going to work; Bush spoke the truth with his
crack about the camel and the tent. And even if they did, what'd it
achieve. Al Qaida is a Hydra; chop off its head and 7 new ones will
appear. We tried it in Northern Ireland with internment; we rounded up
all the leaders of the IRA that we knew about and locked 'em up
without trial (we knew they were baddies, but we didn't have enough
evidence that'd stand up in court) and inside a few months a whole new
command structure sprang up. We achieved nothing, but we pissed off
thousands of innocent (and not so innocent) Northern Ireland citizens,
and generally increased the support for Sinn Fein and the IRA. Not
exactly the smartest move in the playbook.<br/><br/>Then we tried shoot to kill, essentially letting the SAS off the
leash, though I think we tend to deny that. And *boy* did that not
work. That pissed off and politicized a whole new generation of
Catholics, thus helping the IRA get more recruits. It was also found
to be illegal (no surprise there then...)<br/><br/>And now, we have dialogue. We have a peace process and an IRA ceasfire
that has held for years. In the current climate, we might even manage
to get decommissioning. How did we get from there to here? It could be
argued that we forced the IRA to the table by a concerted 'attack' on
its constituency. By various means we worked to marginalize the
terrorist organizations, encouraging the people who would normally be
expected to support them to think of them as irrelevant, mere thugs
and bullies instead of the bold fenian men of songs and stories. And
the IRA helped us. WTF they thought they were doing when they bombed
Omagh is a complete bloody mystery. At the same time, we continued to
make it plain that, no matter what new atrocities were committed, we
were not going to give up the province without the assent of the
majority of the population, which isn't going to happen any time soon.
What hurts most is that we are freeing admitted and convicted
terrorists on license, because that's the price of Peace, and it's a
hard price to pay.<br/><br/>That's what I suggest we (the west) do in the middle east (and
everywhere else for that matter.) Engage with people. Listen to what
they want, and help them to achieve it. Don't enforce what's right for
us, work to make things right for all of us. Marginalize the likes of
Bin Laden by treating him with compassion and mercy. This
disproportionate response just makes him more important. Remember,
happy, prosperous people by stuff, which is good for everyone.<br/><br/>Both George Bush and Tony Blair make a thing about their Christianity,
but they're not acting like Christians. The core message of
Christianity is to turn the other cheek. Love thy neighbour as
yourself and all that. And the message of the parable of the good
Samaritan and of many of Christ's alleged deeds is that there is
nobody who is not your neighbour. The current, vengeful response runs
directly contrary to this and will, in the long run, make more enemies
for America and its allies.<br/><br/>The enormity of the attack on September the 11th is undeniable, and
maybe even unforgiveable, but if we ever want to achieve peace then we
are going to need to forgive. We must come to some accommodation with
these people (or rather, with the people who currently support them)
or be forever engaged in an endless round of attack and retribution
and, I contend, be forever seeing our rights and liberties eroded in
the name of prosecuting this fruitless war.<br/><br/>The current response sends a message to OBL and that message is 'What
you did really hurt us'. So, like any bully, he's going to do it
again. And again. And again. Until we kill him. And then his followers
will carry on his jihad. Hmm...<br/><br/>Surely it's better to pick ourselves up, dust ourselves off and carry
on with living free and happy, whilst at the same time extending the
hand of friendship to those who will take it and working on changing
the opinions of those who currently support the terrorists. After all,
as the Jewish proverb has it, "The best revenge is a life lived well."<br/><br/>Sorry that this has been so long, I didn't have the time (or maybe the
skill) to make it shorter.

<h2>OK</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/pudge/">pudge</a> on 2001-10-11T20:31:28</h3>
1. We were wrong to pull out of Beirut, and we regretted it.
<br>
<br>2. None of those people were ever our allies.  And they turned on us before we turned on them.  They were not our friends at that point.
<br>
<br>I never said assassination is a legitimate act of war.  I said it was war.  I said it was not terrorism.  I didn't say it was legitimate.  I do think it probably was, but I never said so on IRC in the discussion you're referencing.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)
<br>
<br>And no, I don't wonder why everyone else in the region hates the U.S.  I know it is because we support Israel, first and foremost.  And secondmost, and thirdmost.  But I believe our policies are right, so I don't care if they hate us.  There's nothing I can do about that.
<br>
<br>As to the problems of military action in Afghanistan<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... you make it sound like it is the U.S. vs. Afghanistan.  It isn't.  The most powerful military power in Afgahnistan right now, apart from the US/UK force, is the Northern Alliance, who, for now, are on our side.  And I'd wager that the majority of the people, for now, are on our side too.  That makes a huge difference.  Most of Afghanistan is not our target, most of Afghanistan is on our side.  So going into Afghanistan is not the problem you make it out to be.
<br>
<br>As to stopping the terrorists, yes, this won't stop them.  It isn't supposed to.  This is supposed to do exactly what it is doing: driving out the Taliban and crippling what little infrastructure they and the terrorists have.  The task of stopping the terrorists is much harder, and the U.S. and U.K. are not pretending otherwise.  Again, this is where the coalition comes in.  We hope that we can remain friends with these countries for this purpose and that they will help us.
<br>
<br>So now we get to what you think we should do: enagage with people and listen to what they have to say and help them achieve what they want.  Good.  But in the case of bin Laden, that cannot work.  So what else did you have in mind?
<br>
<br>I have no problem with not killing bin Laden.  But our government has a responsibility to stop him.  There is nothing disproportionate in the response: he is waging an ongoing war to kill as many people as possible -- in the previous WTC attack a decade ago, they tried to kill 250,000, and failed miserably, thankfully -- and we are doing what we can to stop them.  What is disproportionate about it?  I don't understand at all.  Perhaps you could be specific?
<br>
<br>I don't see why you think the response was vengeful.  I see it as the minimum necessary to take out the infrastructure that is continually used to wage these attacks against us.  What is vengeful about it?  The military actions, the political actions, they've all been measured to accomplish specific goals to prevent these people from being able to continue to try to kill massive numbers of people.
<br>
<br>The message bin Laden might be getting is that we are bullies, but I don't care what message we send to him, because he wants us all dead and doesn't care what we have to say.  That's not to say I want to nuke him, but I am unconcerned with sending messages to someone who won't receive them in the spirit intended, no matter what we do or say.
<br>
<br>Perhaps one good thing that can come out of this is that we will become closer friends with our neighbors in the Middle East.  Great!  But that will not include bin Laden and his followers, because they are irredeemably out to kill us.  Thankfully, most of the Arab world doesn't share their views.
<br>
<br>My interest is in defending ourselves.  Everything flows from that in this matter.  I am all for ceasing hostilities, but not in the face of someone who is actively trying to kill all of us.
<br>
<br>And the core message of Christianity is not to turn the other cheek.  Nope, no sir, not even.  The core message is to love the Lord your God with all your heart, mind, and soul, and to love your neighbor as yourself.  While that obviously means we should love bin Laden, it also means we should love Israel, and we should love the people who died, and who will die, by trying to stop them from doing it again.
<br>
<br>Remarkably, since those first few days, I have felt no desire to see bin Laden dead or to seek vengeance on him.  I have almost no emotion toward him whatsoever, but a bunch of anger.  But that anger manifests itself in a desire to make sure he can never do this again, either because he is locked up or dead.  I don't wish him dead at all, though.  And while I say he is irredeemable, I don't actually believe that<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... I do think that it is unlikely, and that we cannot work of the assumption that he might be redeemed, though.

What else do we do about bin Laden? Nothing. Maybe tighten security (without dramatically infringing on people's liberty). Ignore him. Don't make him important. Instead, work on convincing the ones who aid and comfort him to stop doing so. Paint him as an irrelevant madman, not as an evil genius, respond with reason and mercy and show him up for the evil, marginalised fanatic that he is. This approach has the cardinal advantage that it <em>works</em>. It's working, slowly in Northern Ireland, it's (hopefully) working in South Africa.<p>
Bombing Afghanistan back into the stone age with achieve precisely nothing, but it will make the bad guys all the more determined and enable them to point at the civilians killed whilst saying "Look what those bastards did. We are right to oppose them." Just like you're doing now.</p><p>
The only way that this cycle is going to get broken is if one side or another says "I'm not going to play this game by your rules any more."
</p><p>
Besides, where do we go from here? Suppose bin Laden does it again, what next? The point about speaking softly and carrying a big stick is that, once you start to swing the stick you've already lost.
</p><p>
I wish you were right; that the assault on Afghanistan could achieve something meaningful. But history seems to say that you are very wrong indeed.
</p><p>
Hmm... don't quite know what I was thinking putting 'turn the other cheek' in there first. I <em>meant</em> 'Love thy neighbour'. As an atheist the stuff about god is just verbiage, but the stuff about how you should behave is plain good sense.
</p><p>Unless my memory is seriously playing me up (it's been a long while since I read scripture), a few other choice quotes spring to mind.
</p><blockquote><div>
 Let he who is without sin cast the first stone.
<p>
 "Vengeance is mine." saith the Lord.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>
Essentially all this boils down to my unshakeable belief in the basic decency of the average human being. Treat people fairly (having come to some shared compromise about what 'fair' means in a given context) and you can expect them to do the same to you. Treat them in any other way and expect them to repay you for it.</p>

Do nothing?  He is actively trying to kill as many millions of Americans and Brits as he can.  This is not a game.  He is at war with us, whether we are at war with him or not, and he is clearly a big huge threat who has succeeded and will succeed again, left to his own devices.  It simply is not an option to, as you say, "Ignore him."  Unless you want many thousands more dead people.

<p> <em> Bombing Afghanistan back into the stone age with achieve precisely nothing</em>

</p><p>Agreed.  So it is a good thing we are not doing that.  Moot point.

</p><p> <em>The only way that this cycle is going to get broken is if one side or another says "I'm not going to play this game by your rules any more."</em>

</p><p>Agreed.  That is why we are, for the first time ever, forcing these people from their caves and holes and working with the entire Middle East to drive them out from under every rock they try to hide beneath.  We finally decided not to play by their rules anymore.  That's what got us into this mess.

</p><p>As to Bible verses, there's a lot in there against personal vengeance, and against not striking back to defend oneself.  I already said, this it not about vengeance, and I readily admit I have a problem with not striking back to defend myself.  However, there is also lexical evidence for two other principles: that of protecting those you are entrusted to defend, and that of the government having the power of the sword.  I won't get into a big Bible debate here, but please see that it is not as simple as you try to make it sound, primarily because this is not an individual affair, and because it, once again, is not about vengeance.

</p><p> <em>Essentially all this boils down to my unshakeable belief in the basic decency of the average human being. Treat people fairly (having come to some shared compromise about what 'fair' means in a given context) and you can expect them to do the same to you.

</p><p>That's all well and good.  But if someone is trying to put a gun to your head and has shown every sign that he is completely undeterred from pulling the trigger, don't you think you should try to stop him?</p>

He'll pull the trigger or he won't. If he's truly mad, he'll pull the trigger whatever I do. So I'll try and reason with him, get him to see that I'm a fellow human being and that my death diminuishes him. And if he won't listen? Ah well, at least I did the right thing.<p>
Any sudden moves on my part just make him more likely to pull the trigger. (And I have the physical prowess of an overweight duckling, so the odds are never going to be in my favour. But I'm not sure that that's relevant to the point you're trying to make.)</p>
