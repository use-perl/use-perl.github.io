<p>Hmm... I can't stand that song. Ah well.
<p>
So, at about 0630 I start hacking on Acme::Dice (the provisional name), Making `proper' classes for the syntax tree, making real modules, mucking with the Exporter, all that good stuff, and I end up with something that'll let do most of what I want (including <tt>roll 4d6 discarding lowest</tt>), I write some scanty documentation and start to think about writing good test cases.
<p>
While I'm thinking about said test cases, I replace the simpleminded <tt>diceman.pl</tt> add in that I wrote for dipsy with something that uses Acme::Dice. And life is good. Folks on #london.pm can test it for me, which they do. And things are looking good...
<p>
Then <b>blech</b> blows it up by telling dipsy to <tt>roll 1000000d6</tt> and my simpleminded (and painfully inefficient) syntax tree chews up all the available memory on dipsy's host box. Time for a rethink. The trouble is, I want to retain the ability to do <tt>explain roll &lt;<i>spec</i>&gt;</tt>, but that means I need to cache the results of rolls, so I'll need a memory efficient way of doing that.
<p>
At about this point Gill comes upstairs to tell me that it's now 1530 and she takes it that I won't be coming down for breakfast. Where <em>does</em> the time go?
<p>
While I'm busy catching up on some food and fluids, I start toying with evil ideas like storing the result of a group of die rolls in the form <tt>"13==(4 6 3)"</tt>, which will `numify' to 13. But that's evil bad and wrong. Looks like I'll be using a hash as a sparse array. And I'm already regretting cheating by using <tt>$die-&gt;{sides}</tt> instead of using proper accessor methods.
