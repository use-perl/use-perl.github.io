<p><p>Ah, it was a lovely week. My mac's drive died badly and without warning. My boss indicated that the app I'm in charge of should "consider" (read into that) using JSEE and JSP (I'm a mason, perl, etc... person). And I am dumb enough that I hadn't backed up the mac in fair too long (for my $month = 0; $month < $too_long; $month++)... </p>

<p> Perl needs a JSEE like system but it needs to be faster and well less JSEE like. But it needs to dress up like J2EE so managers and CTO and ? think it really is J2EE... I know <a href="http://poe.perl.org/">POE</a> is similar but how do we fight the Java hype? Maybe we don't... Paul Graham did have a nice point about Java in his <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/ideas.html">Start Up ideas</a> (that people get paid well for it being a dead end...) But is that just wishful thinking? I can do J2EE but do I want to do it? </p>
<p> I have been listening to <a href="http://www.mikeparkmusic.com/">Mike Park</a> for the last few weeks. He was in Skankin Pickle back in the third wave ska days but now he is writing really good folk music from a new perspective. He is Korean and his music is very enlighting for those of us not Asian. He addresses concerns that I'm sure many young Asian kids have with their own culture in America (and other places in world) like having loves that are not the same race and not having or wanting the same things in life that their parents do (that sounds pretty universal...). It is nice to hear some different voices in the music world. Give him a listen, buy his CD, support someone doing something different. </p>

<p> Here is a lesson for me. BACKUP your machine! </p>

<h2>Make perl look more like java</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/malte/">malte</a> on 2005-10-24T18:30:40</h3>
<p>First step: Make your URLs look more <a href="http://struts.apache.org/" title="apache.org">struts</a apache.org> like</p>

<p>Put that (or something similar) in your apache conf:</p>

<code>
    RewriteEngine On
    RewriteRule ^([^/]+)\.do your_perl_app.pl
</code>

<p>And then teach your MVC toolkit to parse the URLs correctly.</p>
