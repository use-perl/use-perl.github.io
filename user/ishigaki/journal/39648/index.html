<p>Well, the YAPC::Asia 2009 was over a few days ago. I talked on a bug reporting, and gave a few figures in a lightning talk. Here're the links for the slides. <br/><br/><URL:http://www.slideshare.net/charsbar/practical-bug-reporting>
<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/charsbar/top-tens-of-20082009><br">http://www.slideshare.net/charsbar/top-tens-of-20082009><br</a><br/>You can check other people's slides from here:<br/><br/><a href="http://conferences.yapcasia.org/ya2009/talks><br">http://conferences.yapcasia.org/ya2009/talks><br</a><br/>I believe videos will be published later, possibly around the end of this month.<br/><br/>Anyway, I must admit I was very disappointed in a sense, as I felt like I was attending an OSCON, not a YAPC. (If you attended the 2-day main program + dinner + all the 3 courses after that, it costed around $1150 (with a $200 discount applied) :/) However, I really enjoyed chatting/discussing/hanging around with the people, and the sessions I attended were very nice. If you're a web application (framework) developer, you'll be excited by the new PSGI project by miyagawa and others, and the "miyagawanize" by yusukebe was /the/ lightning talk of this YAPC. The purple thing is a small cushion for your chin, which Yahoo! Japan generously gave us as a souvenir for a conference or such several years ago.</p>
