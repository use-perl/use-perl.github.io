<p>It may be a bit late to report, but YAPC::Asia 2007 (April 4-5) is over with great success as ever, and the speakers and staffs enjoyed Hackathon at Hotel Dan (the Encode maintainer's place with fabulous view). Right now, you can see most of the slides at http://tokyo2007.yapcasia.org/wiki/?SlidesFromTalks (movies and voices are coming soon). Maybe more detailed journal would be posted by miyagawa, the lead organizer. I posted this just because YAPC::Asia of this year seems a bit less-known (Perl Review 3.2 didn't have its schedule in the Perl Calendar) and I feel sorry about that, especially considering the fact that we gathered around 400 attendees.<br/><br/>There were bunch of good talks, but for now, I name two of the lightning talks. The first one is a parody. If you know Dan, you'll find it quite funny.<br/><br/>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L022IsDrTX8<br/><br/>And try this one... though instruction is written in Japanese, you'll soon get the point: You can manipulate toy missiles from your web browser. Of course its backend is written in perl (with hacked version of Device::USB::MissileLauncher)<br/><br/>http://www.infomarks.co.jp/yapc2007/<br/><br/>My talk? Mmmmmm...

I'm sorry YAPC::Asia didn't get more publicity too. For next year, please feel free to send me any information you would like posted. Several people have access to update the TPR calendar and we're working on some other ways to bring together content from the various YAPCs. Sounds like you had a great conference even without the extra publicity!<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

Thanks for your kind words. I'll do so the next time when we have YAPC::Asia, though I'm not yet sure when and where it will be<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)<br>
