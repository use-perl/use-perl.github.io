<p><p>So it turns out that <a href="/user/nicholas">Nicholas</a> keeps posting things here to which I want to comment; thus, I finally had to create an account here.  Hello, world.</p>

<p>I've just come back from a trip that included visits to perl mongers in Vienna and Amsterdam; I blogged things about that trip <a href="http://www.eccentricity.org/news/2008/04/">elsewhere</a>.</p>

<p>The real reason I'm posting, however, is to talk about (natural) languages, which has become something of a habit for me.  In <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/nicholas/journal/36195">this post</a>, Nicholas was looking for a Latinate word for the (bad, evil, wrong, no one should do it ever, etc.) act of killing a kitten.  Now many people know that a cat is a Felis domesticus, so cat-killing would be "felicide".  Damian pointed out, and I concur, that the obvious word for kitten would be "felis" (or "feles", the proper nominative spelling) with a diminutive suffix, which gives "feliculus".  All this would give us "feliculicide", which works, but is kind of an unwieldy mouthful.</p>

<p>But it turns out that there is another word in Latin that can mean cat: coincidentally enough, that word is "catus" or "cattus".  This word (along with its Greek cousin "&#954;&#940;&#964;&#964;&#945;") has a direct (though not necessarily causativeÃ¢â¬âthe source for this word is very hard to pin down) relationship to the German "Katze" and the English "cat"; Cassell's English -> Latin section actually gives "catulus" for "kitten".  On the other hand, Lewis & Short think that "cattus" is a word for an unknown sort of animal, and that although "catulus" can be the young of any animal, it especially refers to puppies.  But "catulicide" is easier for English-speakers to say that "feliculicide", with its uncomfortable extra syllable.</p>

<p>Really I think this is just an example of Latin as an evolving language.  Lewis & Short aren't particularly keen on admitting as proper Latin anything that wasn't attested before the end of the Roman Republic, or thereabouts.  I think it rather likely, though I couldn't tell everything I needed to from the Thesaurus Linguae Latinae, that "cattus" was the usual medieval word for "cat", and that "catulicide" (the word, not the act itself, mind) will serve just fine.</p>
