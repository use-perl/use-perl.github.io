<p><p>It's been a while since I've given any sort of status update on my collation project.  I've spent most of the past few weeks writing the "conventional" half of my thesis, in which I have to prove that I can talk intelligently about medieval Armenian literature without hiding behind source code.</p>

<p>I have made some progress though.  As of a week or two ago, I re-tooled my collation engine to work with plain-text input, trivial TEI input, and TEI input in which each word is marked up with the &lt;w&gt; tag.  That last is important, because it means I no longer have to assume that words are whitespace-separated.  Now, as long as you provide semantic markup to define "what is a word?", and you provide a canonization function for your script if necessary, the collation engine should be able to handle any text in any script at all.</p>

<p>(The canonization function is meant to, well, canonize the orthographic variants within a script so that the collator will trivially recognize them as the same word.  So for Armenian, it means that the letter &#1413; is the same as &#1377;&#1410;, and the ligature &#1415; is the same as the two letters '&#1381;'+'&#1410;', and a few other things.  Since I don't want to learn the rules for all human languages, I just leave a place for the user to provide a coderef to do this.)</p>

<p>As long as I was re-tooling my code, I also took the opportunity to try this "test-driven development" thing that seems to be all the best-practices rage at the moment.  It certainly works to some extentÃ¢â¬âI have plenty of tests now, and find it very easy to run them every time I change some codeÃ¢â¬âbut as the project gets more complex, I'm finding it harder to have the patience to nail down the design and write the tests before I just plunge into the code.</p>

<p>Finally, as a reward for reading this far, I give you <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sHYDfITjHY">a TEI encoding</a> (with commentary; watch carefully) of Bob Dylan's "Subterranean Homesick Blues".  Well worth watching.</p></p>
