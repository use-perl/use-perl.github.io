<p><p>I have been in Paris this week, at the conference of the Association Internationale des Ãâ°tudes ArmÃÂ©niennes.  I gave another version of the talk I gave at YAPC.  Since this conference was more serious, my slides are somewhat more useful as standalone information, and so I've <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/tla/101011-manuscripts-approaches-to-the-digitisation-of-the-chronicle-of-matthew-of-edessa-presentation">put them online.</a>  Enjoy.</p>

<p>(Yes I am caught up in the Eurostar mess.  I don't know yet how I'm getting back to the UK.  I'll find out tomorrow.)</p></p>

<p>I am sorry to hear that you are stuck in France just at the moment.  At least you are not one of the poor sods who had booked a flight on XL</p>

<p>I didn't get stuck after all, actually!  Eurostar was running trains yesterday, and was very good about letting anyone who had a ticket onto the next train that was leaving.  They were running more slowly than usual, but they got me to London in time for my onward connection.</p>

<p>Ah, very good!  After reading the Scotsman, it seemed liked they had shut the entire thing down.</p>
