<p>Maybe it's just me but I find it crass that people use their use.perl journals as a free job ad space.  Yeah, yeah, you probably get very "targeted" advertising, the people that might be eligible for the job are likely to peruse the use.perl journals, and you really, really would like to fill that vacancy.  But I still do find it somehow tasteless.

<h2>hmm...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/spur/">spur</a> on 2004-09-03T10:23:35</h3>
I prefer to look at it this way:<p>
The people posting job openings know that there are some unemployed JAPHs at use.perl and want to give them an opportunity to apply for jobs they might not run into any other way. With many people here being friends by reading/commenting each other's journals daily, it sounds like a nice gesture.</p><p>
"Always look at the bright side of life..."</p>



<h2>Who you know</h2>

There is an old saying:<blockquote><div> <tt>It isn't what you know, it is who you know.</tt> </div></blockquote>Perl isn't just a language, it is also a community.<br> <br>Most of the time when someone post something about a job here, it is to point them to the "real" posting on an "official" job posting board.<br> <br>Sometimes, it will be foreshadowing of an upcoming posting.<br> <br>Many times it will say something to the effect of "give your resume/cvs to me and I'll get it in the right hands."<br> <br>That sounds like friends helping friends to me.



<h2>Seems okay</h2>

Certainly if headhunters were joining the site for the purpose of posting job ads, that would be completely unacceptable, and it's possible that this sort of thing could get out of control in the future. But I have no problem with what's happening now, which seems to be a reasonable offshoot of the extended conversation between friends (or at least acquaintances) that the journals seem to be.

<p>I agree.  I have no problem with the jobs postings so far.  I do not read each and every journal entry anymore, however.  If folks are signing up specifically for the purpose of advertising jobs, then I would reject it, but if people I know like Andy Lester or whoever want to say, "Hey, we have an opening," I am glad to hear it, even though I'm not looking.</p>

<h2>Not that bad</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jplindstrom/">jplindstrom</a> on 2004-09-03T17:32:57</h3>
Most people who have posted job ads here are regular contributors. So it's not a big deal that they also write about a Perl-related job opportunity. It's not like they're signing up in order to spam us (like the plague that has hit Yahoo Groups).<br> <br>(If anything, posts totally unrelated to Perl or tech are more "annoying" IMHO. Not that it matters that much.)<br> <br>Personally I think it's a nice touch, mostly because I would like to move on and take a job that involves Perl primarily. Maybe that makes me somewhat biased<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br> <br>So, is the tech and Perl job market growing at the moment, or is it just a trend around here?



<h2>suggestion</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jhi/">jhi</a> on 2004-09-06T11:59:30</h3>
I can understand that people want to use their use.perl journals as free ad space.  I just don't want to read those.<br> <br>Suggestion: if you have a Perl vacancy (or you want to advertise that you yourself are available for work), submit a front page story, class = job, instead of hiding them deep down in the journals.  Then I could just filter those stories away...<br>

Assuming we ever get that part of the code fixed where you can exclude topics and sections<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... grumble<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br>
