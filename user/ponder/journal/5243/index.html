<div class="span8">
<p>Being on site at a clients, I have been hired to do KSH scripting and Oracle SQL loader, but I have discovered that Perl is being used in the background quite extensively.<p>
I have discovered that one of the software packages used by the client is written in perl, and that the vendor's people that they have on site aren't perl programmers.<p>
It also became apparent that the sysadmin guys have had some difficulty with the installation - it seems that the vendor has build Perl on their boxes and shipped the binaries (HP-UX platform with DBI and DBD::Oracle).<p>
Unfortunately, the installation is looking for Oracle paths in a special place, not $ORACLE_HOME much to the chagrin of the sysadmins who are blocking this non-standard configuration in system test and production.<p>
/me comes to the rescue and offers to sort the problems out so that the client has a Perl built on their system - except that this needs to be approved by the infrastructure project manager (is this a valid use of my time?).<p>
Having made the offer, I wait and see what happens, albeit that the client has a semi-crippled Perl installation in that it cannot be extended with XS modules.</p>
