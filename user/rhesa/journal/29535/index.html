<p>It's a saturday morning, and it's my first free weekend in months. I feel like unloading some static. Don't read this, it's silly! My bozo bit seems to be stuck today, so I need a coredump.<br/><br/><h2>Perl gets a bad rap</h2>
First item is <a href="http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=547806">this post</a>: it tickles me, because i think it's weird to turn some cracker's actions into bad publicity for one of his tools.<br/><br/>"Gary told me over a couple of Heinekens [Heineken involved in NASA cracking attempt!!] that he used emacs to type his perl script." -- Anonymous bartender
Emacs is evil! Had he used vi, he wouldn't have been caught!<br/><br/>
<h2>web frameworks</h2><br/><br/><h3>Jifty is doomed!</h3>
Paul Graham <a href="http://paulgraham.infogami.com/blog/morepatents">holds a patent</a> on using continuations to fake subroutines in web applications -- and he suspects they have been made obsolete by Ajax anyway.<br/><br/><h3>Catalyst lost its Mojo</h3>
Inspired by the recent upheaval, I'm building a whole new framework from the ground up, and I'm calling it Devil::Fork. It'll take all the bad design decisions of all frameworks in existence, and extends them for all eternity. I'm already making a mockery of MVC with Devil::Fork::Trident.
The most important factor in the success of any framework is marketing, so I'm currently sketching Devil::Fork::Pitch. I wonder if <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Devil%27s_Advocate_%28film%29">Keanu and Al</a> are interested in a sequel...<br/><br/><h4>When HTML just isn't rich enough</h4>
I have plans for a gooey toolkit for a richer experience, and this will be its entry in the module list: Devil::Fork::You -- GUi toolkit based on Curses.<br/><br/><h2>The good guys are winning!</h2>
Apparently there aren't enough object factories yet. I was quite thrilled when the butchers came in to turn Perl objects inside out. But when a <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Moose">moose</a> weazeled its way onto the CPAN, I got worried. And now I see <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Class::Methodist">more religion</a> being considered for inclusion!<br/><br/>Listen, there are only four classes: Nobility, Bourgeoisie, Proletariat and Pariahs. It's worked forever. And they never mix. No need to go tampering with establishment!<br/><br/><h2>Form validators</h2>
Another area with lots of false prophets. CGI, Data::Formvalidator, CGI::Untaint, HTML::Widget, and more recently, Class::CGI all claim to make web data access safe. Nonsense! I have the definitive one, and it's going to be released as CGIx::Class. I really hope I can make fun of Ovid, Tony Bowden, Matt Trout _and_ Sebastian Riedel all in one fell swoop!<br/><br/><h2>Templating systems</h2>
Haha. That's too funny even for this clown. My work here is done.</p>

<h2>Nice!</h2>

Your entry gave me a good laugh. Thanks for sharing it.
