<p>Today, my Squeezebox (from <a href="http://www.slimdevices.com">http://www.slimdevices.com</a>) arrived in the mail. Its streaming server is written in Perl :-)<br/><br/>I've only glanced at the code, but it looks very well layed out, and uses great modules like TT2 and DBIx::Class. And it's all GPL'ed too, nice!<br/><br/>If you're looking for a good quality, wireless media player, the Squeezebox should be on your list.

I agree that the SlimServer code is in a good shape. They have some really good technical staff and in my experience also great support.<br><br>There are myriads of third-party plugins (with varying code quality) that make the device even more useful. The device is well manufactured, as far as I can tell and well though through. Having a free additional wireless bridge in the living room for my old laptop whose wireless card doesn't support WPA is just great.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br><br>Best regards,<br>Steffen<br><br>P.S.: Oh, and I forgot to mention that it's even great without running a server. I recall that there are 154 internet radio stations listed from Germany alone. But really, I got addicted to trying radio stations from all over the world.
