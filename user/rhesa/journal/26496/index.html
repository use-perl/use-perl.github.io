<p>Anyone know if that feed has changed? Up until Aug 17th, I'd get the latest journal entries, including body. After that date, nothing.<br/><br/>How do I keep track of who's writing what now?

Which feed is that?

Hi Aristotle,<br><br>This url: <a href="http://use.perl.org/journal.pl?op=top&amp;content_type=rss" title="perl.org">http://use.perl.org/journal.pl?op=top&amp;content_type=rss</a perl.org><br>used to have the journal entry content in the &lt;description&gt; field, but not since Aug 17th.<br><br>It used to be really cool that way, especially with my RSS to Email package, because I would just get new posts in my inbox. Now I only see the subjects. That means I can't see if a post is interesting, or not, unless I go open a browser and visit use.perl.org.<br><br>

I was just looking for an RSS feed for the journals yesterday and was disappointed when there was no description in the RSS and the links in the RSS ended up pointing to the entire journals instead of directly to the new entries.  Please add the descriptions back or at least point the links directly to the new journal entries.

yes, the fact that the links point to the complete journal also adds significant overhead<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:(

<p>Just use the one from <a href="http://plasmasturm.org/feeds/" title="plasmasturm.org">my scraped feeds</a plasmasturm.org>. It has full content, links to the individual entry pages, and you won&#8217;t miss entries.</p>

<p>Strange &#8211; I never saw that feed having any content.</p>

<p>In fact, it&#8217;s worse: it only shows the latest post from any single user, so if someone makes several posts faster than you poll the feed, you&#8217;ll miss entries. (Beatnik and TorgoX come to mind&#8230;)</p>

<p>All that compelled me to mix my own feed &#8211; see <a href="http://plasmasturm.org/feeds/" title="plasmasturm.org">my scraped feeds</a plasmasturm.org>.</p>

I could forward you some of the emails of previous feed instances to show you they did have content in the past. Maybe you missed it because you scrape yourself.<br><br>You may be right about the feed missing out on entries. It was still better than nothing.<br><br>Heh, I'm subscribed to some of your feeds<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br>It's a pity though. RSS could be so nice, when done right. Scraping sites is a constant battle against layout changes and other site admin whims...<br>

<p>In case of <i>use Perl;</i> the &#8220;scraper&#8221; actually fetches the very feed you&#8217;re complaining about. It then crawls all the linked journals, fetching <em>their</em> fulltext feeds, and picks the last day&#8217;s worth of entries from the individual journal feeds (so the number of total entries in the feed varies). That&#8217;s how I get a fulltext feed without missing entries without actually having to scrape, per se.</p>

<p>With the other feeds though, definitely, it has been a battle&#8230; the CPAN ratings feed f.ex. has been a constant supply of heartburn.</p>

Boy, do I feel like a complete and utter fool!<br><br>Aristotle, it turns out I was subscribed to your feed of the journals all along. It had simply fallen out of my reader while I was on vacation, so I went looking for it, completely forgetting where I had found it in the first place.<br><br>So, apologies to pudge, your feed is just fine. Even bigger apologies to you, Aristotle, and a big thank you for scraping for me<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br><p><nobr> <wbr></nobr>/me crawls back under his rock...</p>

<p>LOL!</p>

<p>And it&#8217;s my pleasure to provide the service &#8211; I did it for me first, and figured that if I wanted it, others might enjoy it as well, so there you are.<nobr> <wbr></nobr><tt>:-)</tt> </p>
