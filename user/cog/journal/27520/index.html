<div class="span8">
<p>In the project I'm currently assigned to I have to take an extra bus everyday to get to our client.

Yesterday, I noticed something different about the bus: a TV, with a channel called "Bus TV".

One of the things in that channel is a small episode of something like "Good Portuguese".

There's also something like this on the main Portuguese channel, in the morning (I know this because <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/include">include</a> usually turns the TV on in the morning).

One thing that I wonder is...

WHY?

Why on Earth are people who apparently don't know propper Portuguese grammar or don't know how to build a TV show allowed to do things like this?

Example 1:

On the regular TV, the question was if the correct way was to write "despensa" or "dispensa".

They proceed to ask a bunch of people on the street, and then they tell you the right answer: "despensa".

Sure, a "despensa" is a place where you store food and all that, but... "dispensa" is a form of the verb "dispensar" ("to excuse"), so it is also a valid Portuguese word.

Nevertheless, they claim "despensa" to be right and thus, by exclusion, "dispensa" to be wrong.

Example 2:

On the same TV show, they ask whether the correct form of writing is "refugar" or "refogar".

They claim the correct form is "refugar".

Very well, OK, but... "refogar" also exists!

I was so confused that I even checked with two dictionaries, and right I am! Both words exist! "Refugar" refers to rejecting something, while "refogar" refers to something cooking related which I won't explain in English. Take my word for it, OK?

Again, two answers are correct.

What's the point of the TV show, I ask?

Example 3:

On the so called Bus TV: is the correct form of writing "mini-reportagem" or "minirreportagem"? ("reportagem" is kind of a news piece, and I believe you can guess what "mini" means)

Personally, I thought the first answer would make more sense...

According to them, the correct answer is the second one...

I haven't checked this with anyone, but <b>here comes the fun part</b>: They proceed to explain why...

Their reason?

"The correct form is 'minirreportagem' because the first 'r' states that another consonant follows."

<p>...

<p>...

That's not right...

<p>...

<p>...

That's not even wrong...

<p>...

<p>...

WHY?

Why on Earth???</p>
