<p>So my current employer organizes this annual conference where I am at the moment.<br/><br/><strong>500 geeks</strong>.<br/><br/>3 days.<br/><br/>24 hours a day.<br/><br/>Among some of the most well known names, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch_Altman"><strong>Mitch Altman</strong></a> (who brought some of his projects with him, of which my favorite was the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch_Altman#Virtual_Reality">Virtual Reality</a> goggles) and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Huang">Andrew "Bunnie" Huang</a> are here (and yes, there's even a soldering station and a bunch of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chumby"><strong>Chumbies</strong></a> around).<br/><br/>There have been talks on a number of subjects (I gave a new talk myself: "How to survive your first few months of Perl"; but more on that later).<br/><br/>Josette, from O'Reilly, is also here, and O'Reilly books seem to be a huge success around this crowd.<br/><br/>Microsoft brough a bunch of <strong>XBoxes</strong> (I really enjoyed Halo 3 and Gears of War 2) and an <a href="http://www.allofus.com/news/article?id=213"><strong>Interactive Canvas</strong></a>, and a number of other partners brought several other gadgets and innovations (I briefly saw some <strong>hologram</strong>-related thing).<br/><br/>In one of the rooms, <strong>some folks are building 3 arcade machines</strong> (yes, those with the huge screens, the joysticks, and that things that eats your coins). I hear one of the machines will be one of the prizes on the upcoming contests.<br/><br/>Starting a few hours ago, a <strong>24 hour programming contest</strong> has started.<br/><br/>Tomorrow, each group will be presenting what they've accomplished in 90 seconds, and not a second more (some of you may recognize the idea as being originally from Yahoo!, I believe).<br/><br/>Judging by what I saw last year, we're in for a treat.<br/><br/>Given that last year several people complained that it was hard to find experts to help them, this year there is something new: the <strong>Codemasters</strong>.<br/><br/>The Codemasters are basically SAPO people who've been assigned a t-shirt with the name of the technology they excel at; then, since their boss is around, those people are forced to hang around and help everyone with their projects.<br/><br/>There's Codemasters on <strong>GIS, Maps, Photos, Videos, XMPP, Mail, Web Services, JavaScript</strong>, etc. I think there's about 20 Codemasters. I'm the resident Perl Codemaster, and so far I've been asked for help with several projects:<br/><br/> - There's a guy taking the opportunity to create his very own first CPAN distribution;<br/><br/> - There's someone doing something Jabber related (I was asked for help with installing a module);<br/><br/> - There's a guy who won't tell anyone what he's working on, but he was using regular expressions to parse C code;<br/><br/> - There's someone doing an image web crawler;<br/><br/> - Etc.<br/><br/>It feels good, doing my part, as small as it may be.<br/><br/>In about 20 minutes, a <strong>Quiz Show</strong> starts. I'm on one of the teams, and I'm eager to see what happens.<br/><br/>There's <strong>free food and beverages</strong> (beer too, yes) all of the 72 hours.<br/><br/>Everyone's badges have <strong>RFID tags</strong>, and there's an API that allows you to see where each person is ATM (of course, some people preferred not to wear the tags).<br/><br/>Unfortunately, there's no RFID reader in the bathrooms, or I'd have an interesting project of seeing the affluence there throughout the days.<br/><br/>It's being wonderful.</p>
