<p>48,984 tickets for the last concert in the tour.<br/><br/>You can buy tickets at FNAC... if you have their client card...<br/><br/>You can buy tickets at BP gas stations... if you have their client card and at least 1,300 points in it...<br/><br/>You can buy tickets at the stadium... if you are a member of the club and have a life seat...<br/><br/>You can buy tickets at other places... if you their client...<br/><br/>FFS, with all these places selling tickets (and each of them has a number of tickets assigned to it), will there be any tickets left for the common mortal???<br/><br/>I'm not making myself a client of any of those places just to buy tickets for U2. Actually, I will probably stop buying things in any of them if I don't get a ticket because of this [1]!!!<br/><br/>It's just not fair! I know I'm not an official member of the fan club, but I do own all of their cds! I really enjoy their music! <b>Is it fair that I can't buy a ticket now just because I don't like being commercially attached to a brand/company?</b> I am *not* giving my address and personal details just to buy a ticket! I'm buying my ticket someplace else and I will boycot all those places if I don't manage to do it!!<br/><br/>There!!<br/><br/>[1] - Not that I buy anything at the stadium, but they have a mall.</p>

Can you not buy them online or are you looking for somewhere you can get them with cash?

All the places where you can, allegedly, buy them online, are down.

<p>I just spent almost an hour in ATM machines, because starting from 14:00 you could buy them there. There were lines in all of them. No one could buy the tickets because the system would eventually return a "due to connections problem we were unable to process your request" kind of problem.

</p><p>When somebody finally got the part where he could buy the tickets (at about 14:30), he got a "<b>Sold out</b>" message...

</p><p>Sold out!!!!!!</p>

Strange,google brings up a rake of sites when I search for  u2 portugal tickets and they seem functional but then I didn't go very far into the ticket buying process as I don't want to risk accidently buying one.

Oh, and the gas stations? They don't have the tickets being sold yet, but a guy from a station started noting down how many people would go there just to ask about it.

<p>200 people in an hour!!!</p>
