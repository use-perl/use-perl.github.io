<p>I usually don't have much spare time, so I can't read as many books as <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/spur/journal/18659">spur</a> does.

<p>I can barely read one or two small chapters per day, and I usually do it before sleeping...

<p>So, when reading Solaris, and letting my mind imagine all those things happening, I tend to look at the bedroom door quite a few times during each chapter... but it's kind of nice... I guess... I mean, as long as those things *don't* happen!!!

<p>Great book, by the way.</p>

So I have a lot of free time, huh<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-) ?!<p>
How long does it take you to finish a very good book ? That's the measure, I think. I usually find that if the book is excellent, I finish it in 3 days even when I'm darn busy. But if the book's boring, it may take weeks even when I'm free.</p>

You're talking to a guy who spent three whole months doing nothing else but {sleep, go to work, have lunch, more work, go home, eat, work at home, sleep} while(1). And on weekend... more work!!<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-D<br> <br>And during all this time, I had Learning Perl Objects, References and Modules opened on chapter 5... and that *is* an excellent book<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-) I simply had not time to read it!!<br> <br>But to tell the truth, I finished "The Restaurant at the End of the Universe" last week, and I'm almost finishing Solaris by now, so... maybe it's not the time... the problem might be that you have enough money to spend on books and I don't<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-P<br> <br>Gotta find a new job<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)
