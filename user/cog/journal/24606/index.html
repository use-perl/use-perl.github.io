for those of us who never use their last name, or real name for that matter!

Actually, you use your real name when you send emails<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-) That's how I got to know who you really are O:-)

<p>BTW, how much will you pay me to refrain myself from telling the world that you are... cough, cough.

</p> <p>Anyway, I know what you feel... I just don't know if something can be done in that regard...<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-\ I will ask.</p>

If not, just stutter and repeat your (only) name as both first and last (and password too, if it's Joe<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

Unfortunately, I inadvertantly used my company mailbox to send the proposals to you. I don't usually use that for social and Perl type things. However, it really isn't difficult to find it. It's just that I don't use it for these sort of things, and am reluctant to leave it lying around.
<p>
However, I have found the solution<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... first name='Barbie', last name='-'. That'll do for me<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

You know... I know only one person who goes by a nickname and doesn't want people knowing how he's called in real life: you.

<p>OTOH, I know tons of people whose real name is widely known but that I'm sure would do *anything* as to not let people know they'd go by the nickname of "barbie"<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>

Particularly in the music business (I've been a roadie since 1984), having an unusual nickname means people remember you, and consequently phone you up to do lights and things for the likes of Debbie Harry, The Breeders and many others. Using my real name now is just too confusing.

Yeah, those kind of details are really important in the music industry<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

<p>There was this one guy (don't remember his name, but in his video he was a taxi; yes, he was *the* taxi, taking people from place to place on his back; great video; anyone knows who the guy is?) who once said in an interview "You should be different! Grow a beard, for instance! Even if you're a woman!"<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>

No, I don't *know* <code>chromatic</code><nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

<p>I've heard of him, but haven't met him<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>
