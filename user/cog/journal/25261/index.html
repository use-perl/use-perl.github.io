<p>I never imagined <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0401792">such a movie</a> would be possible...<br/><br/>Where can I find the comics?<br/><br/>Everything was just awesome, everything!<br/><br/>Well... maybe not the guy in front of me talking... he kind of stopped when I said something like "Could you keep it quiet, please?"<br/><br/>He started again a few minutes later... I think he was that kind of person with no self control...<br/><br/>I was going to say something again, but <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/include">include</a> prevented me from doing that...<br/><br/>Too bad... my second line was awesome :-)<br/><br/>As for the subtitles, they completely sucked!<br/><br/>Big time!<br/><br/>People just have to understand that Portuguese from Portugal and Portuguese from Brazil are two very different things, and putting a Brazilian to create the subtitles for a movie in Portugal is probably the worse thing you can do to a movie.<br/><br/>Also, apart from the Brazilian Portuguese, translating sentences out of context, without seeing the movie, is not also the best move to make.<br/><br/>If the guy made a pause when speaking, there would be two different subtitles with two separated sentences with a completely different meaning from the spoken words in the movie.<br/><br/>Also, I'm not really sure how "It's a long shot" can be translated by anyone to "It's a spear in Africa"...<br/><br/>What are they giving these translators to drink?<br/><br/>I feel I should write someone about it, but I don't who.<br/><br/>Hey, you! Yeah, you there making the subtitles for Sin City! No more Vodka for you next time!<br/><br/>The movie, though, rocked.<br/><br/><a href="http://imdb.com/name/nm0001675/">Robert Rodriguez</a>++<br/><br/><a href="http://imdb.com/name/nm0588340/">Frank Miller</a>++<br/><br/>I loved it. Simply loved it.<br/><br/>Me want more!</p>

<h2>The spear in Africa</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/cog/">cog</a> on 2005-06-18T14:22:36</h3>
Meanwhile, somebody told me "A spear in Africa" is a Portuguese expression...<br> <br>Well, it might be in Lisbon, but I had never heard it before, neither had <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/include" title="perl.org">include</a perl.org>, and even the guy who told me that admitted that "Um tiro no escuro" ("A shot in the dark"), which *<b>is</b>* a typical Portuguese expression, would've been a better choice of words.



<h2>Bored to tears</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/merlyn/">merlyn</a> on 2005-06-18T15:15:43</h3>
I didn't like it.  I like all kinds of movies.  The visual style was interesting, for the first 20 minutes.  Then it grew... tiring.  Like the first bowl of ice cream is great... but eating the whole carton is dumb.
<p>
I was also very confused by the shifting timeline.  It was hard to tell that we had not only changed locations, but times as well.  There were no visual clues.  At least "Pulp Fiction" had clear scene breaks.  But again, movies that jump around in time are "been there, done that".
</p> <p>
Overall, I nearly fell asleep.  Wooden acting, boring plot, characters to which I could not sympathsize.  I wanted to walk out half way through, but I said "maybe it gets better near the end".  No.  It didn't.</p>
