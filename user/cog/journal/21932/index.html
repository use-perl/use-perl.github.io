<p>Heck, I returned :-)<br/><br/>And they better be carefull with me, because I'm not the sort of player they can put off easily :-)<br/><br/>I've arrived at a point in the game (once again) where I feel really confortable about it: plenty of ammunition (because one shot for each enemy is sufficient) and my favorite guns:<br/><br/>1 - Knife - for those situations when you can actually approach the enemy by his back and remain unnoticed<br/><br/>2 - Revolver with silencer - Pretty cool for when you want to kill someone who's just behind the door; open the door, point to his head, right below the helmet, BAM! Or, actually, PFFF!<br/><br/>3 - Silent Machine Gun (can you believe this?) - for when you know three guys are entering the room running (it's advisable that you hide behind the door)<br/><br/>4 - Sniper Gun - need I say anything?????? :-)<br/><br/>5 - Snoop Gun (??) - Yep, it's really cool. I don't usually use the ammunition (it's scarce), but I use it's targetting device to see in the dark/fog/distance. *Then* I use the Sniper!! :-)<br/><br/>6 - Paratrooper Rifle - It's harder to shoot with this one than with the Sniper Gun, but it's automatic, and some guys don't die with a single shot, so...<br/><br/>Another item I use a lot is the binoculars :-)<br/><br/>My favorite missions are those where you can't let the alarm sound. I like it, planning ahead and studying their movements. He turns around, you go, kill him, hide, wait for the other, jump from behind his back when he runs to his dead friend, kill him too, kick the alarm system to smash it and proceed to the next obstacle. MUAHAHAHAHAHAHAH!!!!! >:-D<br/><br/>Oh... how I miss Metal Gear Solid...</p>

I think you mean "pistol with silencer."  You can't silence a revolver.  (Revolvers have a revolving cylinder for the shells.)<br> <br>Ever play the original Wolfenstein games?  Man, those were great.  CGA, sneaking around and looking for closet with the briefcase bomb in it.  When the guards walked, the PC speaker made this awesome click-click noise of the footfalls...

I don't know much about guns<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-) I just do the shooting<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br> <br>Oh, so that's where the "revolver" name comes from... ( *bangs his head to a door for such a ridiculous thing that had never crossed his mind* )<br> <br>I thought I had played the original games, but apparently not, because I don't remember any closets<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-| Maybe I'll google for some screenshots...

and you can maybe play (some of) it, if you want to do some work.
