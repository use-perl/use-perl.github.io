<h2>Great conference - great country.</h2>

<p>
As part of our honeymoon, I attended the first OSDC in Melbourne. It was quite a nice conference, and I enjoyed the fact that it was more than Perl. I saw several enjoyable talks by non-Perl people.
</p><p>
As for things to see, we drove down from Cairns (covering a distance of about 6500 km) - but we had a month instead of 10 days.
</p><p>
I haven't seen much of Melbourne myself, but Jetta did the partner program of the conference (as the only partner.... I wonder whether they've done last year, or whether they'll do one this year). Besides shopping, they also went to the zoo/aquarium.
</p><p>
Not far from Melbourne (which is unique in this vast country, normally, everything is far away from everything else) is <a href="http://www3.visitmelbourne.com/displayObject.cfm/ObjectID.9303EBAA-0912-4E32-A6E8DC5B85982919/vvt.vhtml" title="visitmelbourne.com">Phillips Island</a visitmelbourne.com> where you can watch koalas, and at dusk, penguins.
</p><p>
Further south is <a href="http://www3.visitmelbourne.com/displayObject.cfm/objectid.F9F5ECCA-B118-409D-8A8D0A4DB31330D0/vvt.vhtml" title="visitmelbourne.com">Wilsons Promontory</a visitmelbourne.com>, a national park with beautiful scenery and lots of wildlife to observe.
</p><p>
Of course, you could always take a plane to Queensland, and visit the Great Barrier Reef.
</p><p>
One of these days, I have to visit Australia again.</p>

Speaking of taking a plane, I considered the possibility of also visiting New Zealand but, for some strange reason, <b>a flight from Melbourne to Wellington is more expensive than a flight from Lisbon to Melbourne</b> (and back again, for both).

<h2>Hostel in Melbourne</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/reneeb/">reneeb</a> on 2006-10-17T12:22:57</h3>
Hi cog,<br/><br/>if you want to stay in a backpackers, I would recommend the <a href="http://www.friendlygroup.com.au/greenhouse_home.asp" title="friendlygroup.com.au">"Green House"</a friendlygroup.com.au>. It's a nice backpackers and it's near to the Flinders Street Station from which you have good train connections to the university. And it's next to the city center.
<br> <br>
I stayed there at last year's OSDC and I enjoyed it!
<br> <br>
How long do you stay in Australia?

I'm arriving on a Monday and departing Thursday of the week after. Considering I'll spend 4 days in the conference, I'll have 5 days for myself there, plus the day of the departure (I don't know whether I'm leaving in the morning or in the afternoon).
