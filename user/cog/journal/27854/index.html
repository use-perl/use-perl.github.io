<p>I'm posting this because I know there's a bunch of people here who enjoy music and challenges.<br/><br/><a href="http://virgindigital.com/wallpapers/virgindigital1280x960.jpg">This picture has 75 bands</a>.<br/><br/>Find them :-)<br/><br/>I'll post the ones I found so far (or that I think I've found) as a comment.<br/><br/>Apparently, there's some other bands you'll find but that really weren't supposed to be there... which is why some people are claiming to have found over 80 bands... O:-)<br/><br/>I'm also a bit confused with some symbols that seem to represent a singer... but a singer is not a band, is it?<br/><br/>Anyway, enjoy :-)<br/><br/>And remember, comments will be spoilers.</p>

I was thrilled to discover The Alarm and Talking Heads, but you've got them and most of the others I saw. Still, that leaves:<br/><br/><ul>
<li>Shakespear's Sister (sic)</li>
<li>The Pineapples from the Dawn of Time (dubious)</li>
<li>Flowers (band later renamed themselves to Icehouse)</li>
<li>The Angels</li>
</ul>

... and (thanks to your inspiration)
<ul>
<li>The Little Angels</li>
<li>Blondie</li>
<li>lostprophets</li>
<li>The Manic Street Preachers</li>
<li>Eminem (I'm dubious of this as there's one of him, not several)</li>
<li>Trio (a bit of a stretch admittedly)</li>
<li>Twisted Sister (was going to mention this last time, but I didn't think the two contortionists quite fitted)</li>
</ul>
PS: Icehouse<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... what a band. Will have to start getting all their stuff on CD so I can keep my vinyl intact<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

</p><p>Which car? Regards the plant Nicole thought she recognised it, but the name didn't inspire anything.
