<p>Greetings :-)<br/><br/>The organizers of YAPC::EU::2005 would like you all to know how things are going.<br/><br/>This is report #15 and here are some details:<br/><br/><b>200 attendees barrier broken</b><br/><br/>Alberto noted that we broke the 200 registrations barrier, and on we go.<br/><br/>Will we make it to 250?<br/><br/><b>Links to google maps on the hotel pages</b><br/><br/>If you look carefully at the Hotels webpage, at <a href="http://braga.yapceurope.org/index.cgi?BragaHotels">BragaHotels </a>, you'll see that most hotels now have a link to Google maps.<br/><br/>Courtesy of Alberto :-)<br/><br/>The maps are slightly outdated, of course, but the streets remain more or less the same, so those maps should be useful.<br/><br/><b>The venue on google maps (* IMPORTANT *)</b><br/><br/>And Alberto didn't stop there!<br/><br/>He also took the time to point out:<br/><br/>    * <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.56,-8.398&spn=0.007553,0.019692&t=k&hl=en">The Venue</a>
    * <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.548,-8.4355&spn=0.007553,0.019692&t=k&hl=en">The train station in Braga</a>
    * <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.5553,-8.4258&spn=0.007553,0.019692&t=k&hl=en">The bus terminal</a><br/><br/>All these links are accessible from the Hotels wiki page too.<br/><br/><b>More details on the conference dinner</b><br/><br/>Alberto took the time to include some pictures on the Conference Dinner webpage, so that you can see what you're going to eat (more or less).<br/><br/>You can find it <a href="http://braga.yapceurope.org/index.cgi?ConferenceDinner">here</a>.<br/><br/>Hum... yummi yummi...<br/><br/><b>More O'Reilly Books</b><br/><br/>O'Reilly is sending us two copies each of: Advanced Perl Programming 2e, Learning Perl 4e, Perl Best Practices and Perl Testing.<br/><br/>This is going to be a great auction :-)<br/><br/>Alberto... er... well, he read the e-mail first.<br/><br/><b>Behind the scenes action:</b><br/><br/>    * Volunteers have fled when we mentioned the fishnets. They were brought back and sedated; life is normal again;
    * A couple more logistic problems were solved this week; namely with the t-shirts and the conference proceedings (again, thanks to Alberto);
    * And the battle for attendees keeps on going. We now have Portugal on the lead with 69 people. UK follows with 46. Up next we have Netherlands with 12, Germany and Sweeden with 11 each, and United States with 9. The total of countries involved is now of 25. Act states that people are coming from 36 Perl monger groups. The complete list of countries can be found <a href="http://conferences.yapceurope.org/2005/stats">here</a>. The complete list of cities can be found <a href="http://conferences.yapceurope.org/2005/stats?show=cities">here</a>. 203 people registered with Act, 129 already commited (doing presentations or with tickets bought).
    * I was interviewed on Perlcast #15 regarding YAPC::EU::2005. The interview is available <a href="http://perlcast.com/audio/Perlcast_015.mp3">here</a>.<br/><br/>And that's it for now.<br/><br/>As always, the organizers can be reached at yapc@perl-hackers.net<br/><br/>Kind regards,<br/><br/>Jose and Alberto<br/><br/>Note 1: You can find the <a href="http://braga.yapceurope.org/index.cgi?FAQ">YAPC::EU::2005::FAQ here</a>.<br/><br/>Note 2: You can find the previous reports from the <a href="http://braga.yapceurope.org/index.cgi?SiteMap">YAPC::EU::2005 SiteMap</a> (bottom of the page).</p>
