<strong>Early bird registration fee</strong>

<p>If you want to take advantage of the early bird registration fee, now is the time. If you register until May 31st, the fee is 75Ã¢âÂ¬. Past that date, registration will be 100Ã¢âÂ¬.
<br />
If you haven't done it already, go on, point your browsers to <a href="http://yapceurope2009.org/ye2009/purchase">http://yapceurope2009.org/ye2009/purchase</a> and purchase your conference ticket.
<br />

</p>
<strong>Speakers</strong>

<p>We have an incredible list of 75 speakers preparing wonderful talks for you.
<br />
Larry Wall and Damian Conway will both be present (and will give keynotes), but that's not all.
<br />
If you take a look at the schedule you'll probably recognize names as brian d foy, Matt Trout, Dave Cross, Gabor Szabo, LÃÂ©on Brocard, Rafael Garcia-Suarez, Abigail, Barbie, Paul Fenwick, Marty Pauley and many others.
<br />
It's an incredible ensemble of people we're getting together just so you can hear them speak.

<br />

</p>
<strong>Training courses</strong>

<p>We're proud to present you with a nice selection of training classes happening before and after YAPC:
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://yapceurope2009.org/ye2009/talk/2113">Introductory Perl, by Dave Cross</a>, August 1st and 2nd
</li>
<li><a href="http://yapceurope2009.org/ye2009/talk/2116">Perl 6 for Programmers, by Gabor Szabo</a>, August 1st and 2nd
</li>
<li><a href="http://yapceurope2009.org/ye2009/talk/2109">Mastering Perl, by brian d foy</a>, August 6th and 7th
</li>
<li><a href="http://yapceurope2009.org/ye2009/talk/2107">New features of Perl 5.10 and Perl Best Practices, by Damian Conway</a>, August 6th and 7th
</li>

</ul>
<p>You can purchase your tickets for these courses on the conference website, at <a href="http://yapceurope2009.org/ye2009/purchase">http://yapceurope2009.org/ye2009/purchase</a>.
<br />
Each of these two day courses are charged at 220Ã¢âÂ¬ (if you're aware of the usual price they go by, you'll know this is a bargain).
<br />
We're very thankful to the trainers for doing this, bringing such incredible courses from such highly regarded Perl people at such a low cost.
<br />
IMPORTANCE NOTICE: all of these courses have a limit of attendees; if you want to attend, you should book ASAP.
<br />

</p>
<strong>Banners</strong>

<p>Now that we have most of the important bits sorted out (namely the schedule and the training classes), it is time to tell the world what's going on.
<br />
To that end, we created a set of banners you can use on your webpages, blogs and PM homepages.

<br />
The logos and instructions on how to use them are available at <a href="http://yapceurope2009.org/ye2009/wiki?node=Logos">Logos</a>.
<br />
Help us spread the word and make this one of the best YAPCs ever!
<br />

</p>
<strong>Receipts</strong>

<p>If you already payed and require a receipt, don't forget to fill in name, address and VAT number so we can start printing things beforehand.
<br />
Unless requested, receipts will be delivered at the conference.
<br />

</p>
<hr />

<p>That's all for this newsletter
<br />
Feel free to contact us at organizers@yapceurope2009.org for anything
<br />
conference related.
