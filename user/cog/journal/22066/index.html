<p>In my first year at the University, I remember I would only use Windows, and all I'd do with it was playing games... There was a friend of mine who was a great hacker (nagra), who would only use Linux and command-line interfaces, practically...<br/><br/>Now, years later, I was having an argument with him... He's using Windows, I'm using Linux. He uses all-fluffy tools... For reading mail, he's using becky; I'm using mutt (with procmail, postfix and fecthmail); for browsing, he's using netcaptor, while I'm using Firefox with a couple of extensions.<br/><br/>He doesn't even use Perl anymore!! He says it's "so 70's"...<br/><br/>At least he still uses Vim, once in a while, so not everything is lost...<br/><br/>But all in all, he's working in London, for Sony (and has worked in Japan, also), earning the big bucks, while I'm still stuck in Portugal...<br/><br/>f*ck... :-|</p>

<h2>Ask yourself..</h2>

Before you get envious, ask yourself "Who has the better life? Who has more fun?"<p>
Just think of the things he must be missing:</p><ul> <li>Belfast in late summer</li>
<li>The London Expierience</li>
<li>The YAPC::EU auction</li>
<li>appearing in fishnet this coming summer</li>
<li>the understanding and support from your fellow use-perl'ers</li>
</ul>
There is absolutely no doubt in my mind as to who has the better/funnier/more fulfilling life of you two.<br> <small>Is Sony hiring? Must find out... oh it's still on! Ups! Better erase the last bit.. &lt;click&gt;</small>

<i>Is Sony hiring?</i>

<p>IIRC, he was invited to go working for a London company right after the Interpol and CIA started chasing him... from there to Sony (in Japan), I guess it was just a small step for him<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>
