<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0372784">Batman Begins</a> is surely the best Batman movie I ever saw.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000288/">Christian Bale</a> finally manages to give a decent figure to Bruce Wayne.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0614165/">Cillian Murphy</a> plays Crane very well. At first it seemed he should be taller to play that part, but he surely seems to be a good actor and lives up to the part.<br/><br/>Great performances too are those of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000323/">Michael Cane</a> playing Albert, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000198/">Gary Oldman</a> playing James Gordon and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000553/">Liam Neeson</a> playing Henri Ducard.<br/><br/>These and many other excelent performances, associated to some awesome special effects and very good abilities from the team behind the camera (including <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0634240/">Christopher Nolan</a>, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0209144">Memento</a>'s director) make the final result a very good one (OK, maybe some of the jokes should be cut out).<br/><br/>In fact, this movie is so cool that I could even go without mentioning the subtitles...<br/><br/>IF THEY WEREN'T SO FUCK*ING BAD!!!<br/><br/>I mean... I knew something was wrong when <b>somebody said "Wayne" and it came out "Bruce"</b> in the subtitles, right at the beginning... but I'm not sure I was prepared for what came next...<br/><br/><b>Translating "You've not beaten me yet" to the Portuguese equivalent of "You've beaten me"</b> is bad enough, but continuously <b>mistaking "but" for "and"</b> and so on...<br/><br/>And I'm also pretty sure you'll agree that <b>"there's no one else left to rat to" is quite different from "there's no one else left to rat."</b><br/><br/>And so on, and so on... <b>"three hundred grand" got turned into "three hundred dollars"</b>, <b>Albert saying it was already "three o'clock [in the afternoon]" and that Bruce should get up got turned into "three a.m."</b><br/><br/>Actually, I think I could go on with this for... about two hours and twenty minutes, which is the duration of the movie.<br/><br/>Yep, that bad.<br/><br/>You know what? I've never done any drugs, but if I had, and if I were into it, I'd do my best to find out what these translators are having and get me some of that. <br/><br/>Man, that shit's gotta be *incredible*!</p>

<h2>What did you expect in the new Euroland?</h2>

All the good translators went to Brussels, didn't they?<br><br>I suppose a few are at the EuroParlement out in whichever of Alsace or Lorraine the stuck that in to keep it out of the Eurocrats' way<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...

<i>All the good translators went to Brussels, didn't they?</i>

<p>I certainly hope so, because Europe is screwed if the European Parlament is getting this kind of translations<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-\</p>
