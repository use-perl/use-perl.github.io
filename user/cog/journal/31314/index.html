<p>After over a year, we finally have internet at home. Stable and with a bunch of TV channels.<br/><br/>As for me, I've been enjoying my experience as a team leader so far. I've been very, very busy.<br/><br/>I'm also making plans to go to OSDC Australia, in December.<br/><br/>In other news, log is moving to new facilities. Still in Lisbon, but better located in several ways. Can't wait to be there :-)<br/><br/>Today we all left our stuff in some boxes and next Monday we'll be entering the new facilities and we hope to see the boxes on top of our desks and everything working :-)<br/><br/>It'll also be day I'll be welcoming two new members to my team, so I'll have plenty to do... as usual! :-)<br/><br/>I'll try to post more :-)<br/><br/>Cheers! :-)</p>

<p>I remember to have seen somewhere that you would be there at Brazil for YAPC::SA 2006 (November 3-5). Will you?</p>

I'd love to, but I won't be able to make it.<br><br><i>I remember to have seen somewhere that you would be there at Brazil for YAPC::SA 2006</i><br><br>Well, I've never submitted a talk to that conference, registered or even searched for flights... Not that wouldn't love going, but I just can't afford every conference I want to attend<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br><br>You're probably refering to <a href="http://perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=547971" title="perlmonks.org">this post on Perlmonks</a perlmonks.org>.
