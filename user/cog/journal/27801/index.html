<p>Early morning, on the subway:<br/><br/> - Excuse me, I wonder if you can help us... we're trying to get to the underground station of Angel...<br/><br/> - Then what ya doin' down "hear"?<br/><br/> - What?<br/><br/> - 'F ya tryin' get "ta" Angel, then what ya doin' down "hear"?<br/><br/> - Er...<br/><br/> [At this point the guy smiles and points the way... and it was a long way to the track we wanted]<br/><br/>It was already 09:07, we were 99% sure of being in the right building, but none of the people working there could tell where LPW was being held. One of them managed to take us to a Workshop, just not the London Perl one.We were near the entrance when we saw a familiar face walking in (followed by another familiar face):<br/><br/> - Abigail!<br/><br/> - Hello!<br/><br/> - And Josette!<br/><br/> - Hi!<br/><br/> [Abigail turns left and continues walking as if knowing the place like the palm of the hand]<br/><br/> - Abigail, do you know where the LPW is?<br/><br/> - Sure! It's down this hall and to the left.<br/><br/> - Oh, great, because we couldn't find anyone.<br/><br/> - Yes, I was the first to arrive.<br/><br/> - What do you mean, the first? It started at 09:00! - No, it starts at 10!<br/><br/>OK, so we weren't sure if LPW was starting at 8 or at 9... and it was starting at 10. Oh, well :-)<br/><br/>During the day I finally got to see Abigail's talk on Regexp::Common, which made me realize how incredible that module is, Nigel's talk on Goo, which was really cool, Aaron's talk "Perl at the Registry", thus not missing it for the third time in a row, Leo and Leon's talk on MighTyV (first time I see a talk with two speakers being this funny), and, of course, MJD's talk on Red Flags.<br/><br/>All of these talks were very nice, and I'm glad I went to all of them (couldn't go to more because I was, er... busy).<br/><br/>I also did a talk on creating CPAN modules. I know I've done this kind of talk before, but I decided to redesign it, so of all the slides I had before I used... one.<br/><br/>And the interesting thing? I never got to use it, because it was the "thank you" slide, and I decided to let the slide with the urls up, as people were hastily writing them down.<br/><br/>I got some feedback from the talk. It appears I managed to pass the message I wanted to pass, which is: "creating a package and uploading it to CPAN is really easy, you can do it too, and <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/cog/Acme-CreatingCPANModules-0.01/">here's how you do it</a>."<br/><br/>I also managed to talk a bit more with Josette, from O'Reilly, about pm groups and other stuff, which was great.<br/><br/>All in all, a very nice workshop :-)</p>
