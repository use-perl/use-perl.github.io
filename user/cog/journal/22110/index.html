<p>Too many things are happening and I have far too much work to post a longer entry detailing them all. I'll stick to the most important bits:<br/><br/>There's a presentation tomorrow.<br/><br/>For the client.<br/><br/>With a bunch of people who have been waiting for this product for some months now (hey, don't blame it on me, I was assigned to other projects meanwhile).<br/><br/>The CEO of our company will be there too.<br/><br/>The guy who should do the presentation won't be able to go.<br/><br/>Guess who's doing it instead...<br/><br/>You only needed one guess, right?<br/><br/>The problem is that we still can't show them the application working, just screenshots, because we still have no proper data...<br/><br/>I think I'll just go to the airport now... maybe if I beg really hard, who knows?</p>

Well - you must be used to it by now, so it should'nt be anything to make a fuss over.<p>
Just imagine the clients and your CEO sitting in fishnet while you do your presentation - that should add some spice to it<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-P</p>

It's not that I dislike doing things like this, but I'd apreciate it if they'd let me know sooner, so I could prepare myself.<br> <br>It's now 8 am. The presentation is schedulled to 10 am. I already have all the screenshots I need, but I don't have them in the right order yet, nor do I know what I want to say about each of them...<br> <br>Oh well... back to work.
