<p>After 82 days,

<p><code> 0:23  up 82 days, 22:50, 6 users, load averages: 0.75 0.68 0.48</code>

<p>I restarted.

<p>During all this time, Firefox crashed twice and mplayer did it a bunch of times.

<p>Yesterday, I finally managed. Finder crashed.

<p>And there was absolutely no way of putting it back to work again!

<p>I mean, it would start, but it just wouldn't do anything. It had been a long time since I'd seen an "Application not responding" sign.

<p>Anyway, I started closing everything, in order to do a restart...

<p>Looks simple, uh? No way! After closing every single application I had opened, I noticed I no longer had a menu on the top left corner. That's right, on the top left corner! The gray bar at the top had disappeared, as if it was transparent. The time still showed up on the right upper corner, though.

<p>I decided to restart by pressing the "magical" button and then selecting the "shutdown" option.

<p>I did that twice.

<p>It didn't work.

<p>So I pressed the button for a while more and finally managed to force my iBook to shutdown.

<p>From the moment I turned on the laptop (last night) so far, everything's been working fine.

<p>So my experience of how long I'd manage to keep it on went as far as 82 days, but I know it could have been longer, had I not done a couple of weird acrobacies with my camera and it O:-)</p>
