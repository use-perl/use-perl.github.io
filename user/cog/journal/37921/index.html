<p>Greetings, and welcome to the very first YAPC::EU::2009 newsletter.<br/><br/>In this issue:<br/><br/> - Conference theme
 - (Tentative) Dates and Venue
 - The lookout for sponsors
 - Communication means<br/><br/>So let's get started:<br/><br/>
<strong> - Conference theme: Corporate Perl</strong><br/><br/>	Next year's YAPC::EU theme is "Corporate Perl".<br/><br/>	"Corporate Perl" is not about guys in suits showing off their products (although suits are very welcomed, as they've always been).<br/><br/>	"Corporate Perl" is about how and why Perl is being used in the big companies.<br/><br/>	How many of us have heard of Wall Street companies using Perl?<br/><br/>	How many of us have heard of Perl-ran companies with teams of hundreds of developers?<br/><br/>	How many of us have heard of Perl systems making billions of dollars every year?<br/><br/>	How many of us have *heard* about this?<br/><br/>	How many of us have *seen* it?<br/><br/>	The time has come.<br/><br/>	The time to show the world how well Perl is doing, how alive it is, and how bright and shinny the community is thriving, has come.<br/><br/>	Granted, we won't be able to bring in every single company using Perl to the event, but if you consider that some of the people working at these places already attend YAPCs, all we really need to do is convince them to walk on stage and tell the world what they're doing with Perl.<br/><br/>	We can barely wait.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong> - (Tentative) Dates and Venue</strong><br/><br/>	We finally found the right venue.<br/><br/>	There's been meetings, phone calls, SMSs, emails, and faxes involved, but it seems we made it.<br/><br/>	We're currently waiting for the official confirmation (we already have the unofficial confirmation). We were waiting to get the paperwork on our side to let the world know the details, but we decided not to make you wait any longer.<br/><br/>	The conference should be held from the 3rd to the 5th of August 2009, at FCUL (Faculty of Sciences of the University of Lisbon), and as soon as we get the official papers, we'll share that information with you.<br/><br/>	Yes, we realize the conference will run from a Monday to a Wednesday. Trust us on this one.<br/><br/>	Yes, we realize the conference will be held on the first week of August. There were a lot of issues that prevented us from selecting different dates. As much work as we've put into this, it's always hard to ensure we get everything we want.<br/><br/>	Here's a <a href="http://yapceurope2009.org/ye2009/ads.html#4">short teaser of the venue</a>.<br/><br/>	More on this subject in the near future.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong> - New website</strong><br/><br/>	We have a new and clean website, which we hope appeals more to the theme of Corporate Perl.<br/><br/>	You can browse what we have so far and <a href="http://www.yapceurope2009.org/">pre-register</a>.<br/><br/>	We'd like to call your attention to the logo of the conference, which is a Perlish version of the Portuguese coat of arms (as suggested by brian d foy at the last YAPC::EU and selected by the attendees of that conference);<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong> - On the lookout for sponsors</strong><br/><br/>	We need money.<br/><br/>	Well, not us, the conference.<br/><br/>	There's no way we can put up a conference like this without money, and you can help us.<br/><br/>	How?<br/><br/>	Talk to your company. Put them in contact with us.<br/><br/>	We'll be speaking to a lot of companies in the months to come about sponsoring the event, but if you feel your company can help, please let us know.<br/><br/>	Sponsoring the event has several benefits, such as a number of free entries to the conference, advertisement, and others.<br/><br/>	Help us put together the best YAPC::EU possible.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong> - Communication means</strong><br/><br/>	We plan on being in touch with you (ir)regularly until the conference takes place.<br/><br/>	We'll be posting on the website, sending emails to the <a href="http://www.yapceurope.org//contact.html">conferences@yapceurope.org</a> mailing list, and posting small updates on our Twitter, Jaiku, and Pownce accounts (we also have a FriendFeed account that receives whatever we post on Twitter).<br/><br/>	There's also a feed of videocasts available at http://vimeo.com/user947461/videos/rss, where we'll post all the videos made by the organization.<br/><br/>	Feel free to spread the word. We appreciate that.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Feel free to contact us at organizers@yapceurope2009.org for anything conference related.<br/><br/>
See you at the next newsletter,<br/><br/>cog and ambs<br/><br/>
In our next newsletter:<br/><br/> - the confirmation of the dates (we hope; we're really working hard on this one)
 - our first sponsors
 - some travel tips and information
 - and more

<h2>Partners</h2>

<p>I recall that in Copenhagen, it was announced that you'd be allowing people's partners to attend for free.  I didn't notice this being mentioned here.  Has that been revoked?  If not, what are the rules/restrictions?</p>
