Perhaps you mean <a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/schubiger/" title="cpan.org">this</a cpan.org>?<br>

We have a winner!

<p>Also, have a look at <a href="http://cpanratings.perl.org/d/Sort-NoCase" title="perl.org">this</a perl.org><nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>

It's weird. He obviously knows what he's doing to some extent. The code is of pretty good quality and the modules are all packaged up really well. There're just largely pointless.<br> <br>All that energy should be channeled into sometihng more useful.

<p>Well, yesterday night someone from #perlfr managed to send him a SMS asking him to join #perl
discuss his module updates (most of the updates of yesterday were changing the shebang line in included scripts). <i>And he actually joined #perl!</i> Oddly enough, he wasn't flamed on arrival...<nobr> <wbr></nobr><tt>:-)</tt> </p>
<p>Several people explained the various problems with his uploads and code, he acknowledged that some of his modules were of Acme:: grade, and was very receptive to criticism, he apologised a few times, too. I was rather surprised that #perl could be so<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... decent and helpful.</p>

<p>As for saying that the modules are still here, even after having been moved to Acme::... You seem to forget that deletion on PAUSE takes a while (a week or so, IIRC).</p>

<p>Well I'm not. It's a wonderful community, and I'm pretty sure he'll manage to fit in, regardless of his modules<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-) And we'll all be there to welcome him<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-) And I hope he goes to YAPC::EU::2005<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

Well, first, if you (Steven Schubiger) read this, I did this module as a joke (sometime before you join #perl). Somebody sugested it, and I did it.<br/><br/>Although I did it, I didn't intend to maintain it, of course. If was a joke. It is already scheduled to deletion.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, I have more reasons on deleting it after the comments I heard above.<br/><br/>Cheers,
ambs.
