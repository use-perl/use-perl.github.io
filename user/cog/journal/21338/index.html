<div class="span8">
<p>How would you define a regex for a word?<br/><br/>No, it wouldn't be [a-z]+, as that would get things such as "z", which I don't think is a word in any language (am I wrong?)<br/><br/>So... do all words in every language contain at least one vowel? I think it would be too simple if it were so, but I can't think of any example...<br/><br/>Any other rules?</p>

<h2>Words</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/rafael/">rafael</a> on 2004-10-14T10:49:46</h3>
In French many single-syllable words can be elided before a wovel, so <i>d'</i>, <i>l'</i>, <i>j'</i>, <i>m'</i>, <i>t'</i> are valid words. <i>t</i> is a fake word used to adapt some ligatures (<i>comment va t-il ?</i>). <i>y</i> is an adverb of location (<i>j'y vais</i>), it counts as a semi-vowel.

Hmm... this is *very* useful information to what I'm doing<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-) Thanks<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br> <br>Anyone else would like to say something about his/her own language?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-) Or any other, for that matter<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

<h2>Vowels</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/htoug/">htoug</a> on 2004-10-14T11:30:03</h3>
There are several "words" that do not contain what is normally called a vowel.<p>
In english, y is not a vowel (I learnt that in school in Ireland, so I might be wrong), so the word rhythm does not contain a vowel.</p><p>
I had a jugoslav friend a long time ago, whose last name was Hrs, which he claimed was perfectly pronounceable (somewhat like 'hearse'), but I can't find any vowels there either.</p>

We were spending our holiday on the island of "Krk" in Coratia.<br> <br>One of the things I remember from my ancient greek classes in school is that there is a family of consonants called something like "muta cum liquida" which can behave like vowls. I think they are:<blockquote><div> <tt>r, m, n, l</tt> </div></blockquote>You can say those consonats for a prolounged period of time ("mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm") just like a vowel ("aaaaaaaaaaaaaa"), which is something you cannot do with 'proper' consonants ("t-t-t-t-t-t-t"). Hence they are called 'con-sonants'.<br> <br>I guess this doesn't help with your problem, but it's an interesting factoid, IMO.<br> <br>And probably it's all wrong, too, but IANAL (Linguist)<br> <br>

OK, that was a good answer... what I forgot to say was: I don't know the language nor do I have a list of its words<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br> <br>I'm doing this for something like fifteen different languages.
