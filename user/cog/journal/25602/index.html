<p>Google maps are absolutely wonderful.<br/><br/>I've been travelling through the world with them, and I never cease to amaze me.<br/><br/>For starters, I went to find some of the places I've been to, such as <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=london,+england&ll=51.501878,-0.121762&spn=0.004607,0.006707&t=k&hl=en">the London Eye and the Big Ben</a>, in London, England, or <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=toronto,+canada&ll=43.641461,-79.388430&spn=0.004607,0.006707&t=k&hl=en">the Skydome (er..

<p>The rectified oblique views can be disconcerting; Lady Liberty is particularly twisted from preferred perspective.

I was assuming the darker images were autumn / winter images with the deciduous leaves fallen, not Infrared or night. I stand by that theory.

<p>The <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=lisbon,+portugal&amp;ll=38.707892,-9.321996&amp;spn=0.007869,0.007767&amp;t=k&amp;hl=en" title="google.com">bridge over the road</a google.com> a bit east of your focus has a crisp shadow (left) and a bus with presumed headlights about to pass under. I suspect this is a late afternoon image with running headlamps already being somewhat effective.

</p><p>The nice red-tile roofs would not be so cheery cherry, nor the backyard pools so azure, in IR, even if the leafy lawns were false-colored to green (as they can be with 3-freq IR).</p>
