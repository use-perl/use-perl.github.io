<p>Sometimes, it works :-)<br/><br/>I can catch the Carris 22 out from my apartment and leave it only in the end of the route. That takes about 40 minutes, but I had to do it anyway to get to work.<br/><br/>From there, I get the Vimeca 13, and twenty minutes later I'm on the second floor of the client's building, ready to work :-)<br/><br/>Whoo-hooo! :-D<br/><br/>And it's confortable, and it's not crowded.<br/><br/>Only 13 people in it today...<br/><br/>The bus, not the building :-)<br/><br/>In the previous client I worked, it took me anywhere between half an hour to an hour by taxi to get there. It was much closer, but the traffic... oh, the traffic... :-\</p>

If you take public transport, you're at work in about an hour but it's less crowded. At your previous job, you took a taxi for 30 to 60 minutes and you were stuck in traffic? I'd take "not driving" for 30-60 minutes over "not driving" for 60 minutes guaranteed anytime<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)<br> <br>
But then, I take my car and arrive at work 15 minutes later.. if traffic allows. Ofcourse, I do get the occasional parking ticket<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

No, no, no.<br> <br>I guess I didn't explain myself right<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br> <br>First I get from home to the company I'm working at.<br> <br>That usually takes half an hour.<br> <br>At the previous client I was working at, I had to undertake an extra taxi ride from there, which took 30-60 minutes, depending on traffic.<br> <br>With this new client, I extend the first 30 minutes by bus to 40 minutes (I get off at the end of the line).<br> <br>From there, I catch another bus, which is a great bus, because I have so much space and it doesn't stop too many times. I can easily get a seat and use that time to read, check something on my laptop or simply relax...<br> <br>Did I say the seats are confy?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br> <br>So bottom line is:<br> <br>Previously: 30 minutes by bus + 30-60 minutes by taxi (did I mention I don't like taxis?)<br> <br>Now: 40 minutes by bus + 20 minutes by bus.
