<p>So I'm attending The Damian's course: Perl Best Practices.<br/><br/>I feared that I'd be throwing my money away, because after all I don't exactly consider myself in any form a beginner in this area (but I'm not an expert either), and I do have the book, after all (now I have two).<br/><br/>But the thing is:<br/><br/>* I was going to be in the same city...<br/><br/>* It was just going to be 200USD (I love it when people do things for the bennefit of the community)...<br/><br/>* I would have two pleasant days, watching Damian speak...<br/><br/>* I could still learn something...<br/><br/>* And who knows, maybe it would even look nice on my CV...<br/><br/>But quite frankly...<br/><br/>I really didn't expect it to be the way it is...<br/><br/><b>IT'S WAY BETTER THAN I IMAGINED!!</b><br/><br/>OK, it's not like it's the best thing ever since sliced bread, either; so I may have exagerated a little bit (but just a little bit) up there with the bold capital letters, but I really wanted to catch your attention :-)<br/><br/>The course really is good, and Damian indeed is an excelent speaker/entertainer, but that I already knew.<br/><br/>So the material's excelent too, but it's not like was expecting anything less, coming from him.<br/><br/>So what's so good about all this? It's that he gives out more information than what's in the book! He goes on explaining things, people ask questions that are sometimes not covered in the book, Damian answers, attendees share experiences...<br/><br/>It's really nice :-)<br/><br/>I'm glad I signed up :-)</p>
