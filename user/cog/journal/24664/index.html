<div class="span8">
<p>I don't know who translates movie titles to Portuguese, but I'm pretty sure they're not the brightest of people (at least not all of them).

<p>For purpose of illustration, I'm showing you the original title, the Portuguese title, and a litteral (as much as possible) translation back to English of that Portuguese title.

<p>For instance:

<p>- <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0376541">Closer</a>
<br>- Perto Demais
<br>- Too Close

<p>Get the idea? The movie is called "<b>Closer</b>", is advertised in Portugal as "<b>Perto Demais</b>", which is Portuguese for "<b>Too Close</b>".

<p>Here are some of the most recent ones (I had a leaflet from a cinema at home):

<p>- <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0361841">Little Black Book</a>
<br>- As Amigas do Meu Namorado
<br>- My Boyfriend's Girlfriends

<p>- <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0372588">Team America</a>
<br>- Team America - PolÃÂ­cia Mundial
<br>- Team America - World Police

<p>- <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0359013">Blade Trinity</a>
<br>- Blade Trinity: PerseguiÃÂ§ÃÂ£o Final
<br>- Blade Trinity: Final Chase

<p>- <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0368578">Are We There Yet?</a>
<br>- EstÃÂ¡s frito, Meu
<br>- You're Toast, Dude

<p>- <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0374180">Romasanta
<br>- Romasanta, A CaÃÂ§a ao Lobisomem</a>
<br>- Romasanta, The Hunt to the Werewolf

<p>- <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0405159">Million Dollar Baby</a>
<br>- Million Dollar Baby - Sonhos Vencidos
<br>- Million Dollar Baby - Dreams Won (?)

<p>- <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0395947">Back to Gaya</a>
<br>- Back to Gaya, Pequenos HerÃÂ³is
<br>- Back to Gaya, Small Heroes

<p>I especially like the translation for "Are We There Yet?"

<p>I mean, it's not that hard, is it? It's just "JÃÂ¡ chegamos?"

<p>And don't tell me it's a matter of culture or anything, because that's a sentence every Portuguese kid says in every car journey... several times!

<p>Sometimes they get it right, and sometimes they don't even bother translating the title (they use the original, as if everybody knew English).

<p>To end this rant, here's one of my personal favorites:

<p>- <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0120657">The Last Warrior</a>
<br>- O DÃÂ©cimo Terceiro Viking
<br>- The Thirtheenth Viking

<p><b>FFS!! The guy wasn't even a Viking!!!</b></p>

Having lived in S. Korea for a year and a half, I have seen my share of bad title translations.  I just don't think some of the examples you mention are all that bad:<br> <br>Team America is a 100% exact match<br> <br>Blade Trinity's tag line is:  The final hunt begins<br>which "Final Chase" conveys pretty much the same meaning.<br> <br>Romasanta isn't even an english title to begin with - the internatational english tag line is "The Werewolf Hunt" which "The Hunt to the Werewolf" also gets across the meaning in my opinion.<br> <br>The Last Warrior's american title was "The 13th Warrior" and it also had a working english title of "The Vikings".<br> <br>Oh, and "Little Black Book" - "My boyfriend's girlfriends" is exactly what the movie is about.  If the culture doesn't have the concept of "a little black book", I couldn't think of a better title.

Having checked IMDB again, I agree with you on Team America.

<p>As for Blade Trinity, I don't agree on adding tag lines to the movie title; at least not in this case.

</p> <p>Regarding Romasanta... well... OK.

</p> <p>The 13th warrior had a really bad translation, and as for the "Little Black Book", I can understand...

</p> <p> <b>However</b>...

</p> <p>You have to understand that these were just the examples I had at hand<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-) I could go on and on all day long, because each movie title has a worse translation than the previous one, and this is not just my opinion: <b>this is something people discuss from time to time, and I am yet to see a Portuguese person saying movie title translations from English to Portuguese are well done</b>.

</p> <p>See the "Are we there yet?" translation? We get that kind of translations all the time! And it sucks!</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t get your feathers in a ruffle. It may be silly at times, but it&#8217;s pretty standard fare for movie titles, I&#8217;m afraid. The same happens with German translations, the same happens with Greek translations (which are sometimes comically stupid), the same even happens with English translations &#8211; of German movies, in this case.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s just how it is.</p>

But it's not just the titles... They do the same (or, actually, worse) with subtitles.

<p>Most people either pay attention to the sound or to the subtitles; I, OTOH, have the handicap of using both. This means that I get suddenly confused when the two don't match.

</p> <p>Look what they've done with one version of <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0264695" title="imdb.com">The Hound of the Baskervilles</a imdb.com>:

</p> <p>"I could swear this was the right spot."
<br>"Ia jurar que havia aqui uma mancha."
<br>"I could swear there was a stain here."

</p> <p>They're looking for a body, the guy is sure they're on the right spot and he complains that there should be a stain on the ground? Of what, ketchup?

</p> <p>Sometimes, it seems that they don't even take the trouble of seeing the movie!<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-\

</p> <p> <small>(I have to start taking notes of these things when I see them, so that I have a handful of them ready)</small> </p>

more of the english movie titles translated into chinese are crap. you can hardly find out the movie you are looking for if you just search the chinese title.<br> <br>although, one of the reason i can come up with is that, the english movies first came out as pirated one. then it got popular and the legi movie adopts the same title as well.<br> <br>heck. the subtitle is almost as bad as the titile.
