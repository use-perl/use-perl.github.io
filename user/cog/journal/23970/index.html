<div class="span8">
<p>Greetings :-)

<p>The organizers of YAPC::EU::2005 would like you all to know how things are going.

<p>This is report #7 and here are some details:

<p><b>We have the major sponsors</b>:

<p>As you probably noticed by the "Meet the sponsors" special report, we have our three main sponsors settled. We have much to thank them and their support will make lots of things possible (some of them you'll see before, others you'll see in Braga).

<p>The sponsors are (no specific order): <a href="http://www.fotango.com">Fotango</a>, <a href="http://www.sapo.pt">Sapo</a> and <a href="http://www.log.pt">log</a>.

<p><b>We have a poster</b>

<p>The YAPC::EU::2005 poster is now available as a <a href="http://braga.yapceurope.org/images/poster.pdf">1.7M pdf</a> here (this is what you'd like to print) and as a <a href="http://braga.yapceurope.org/images/poster-small.png">160K png</a> at Poster (this is what you'd like to see if you don't want to spend too much bandwidth.

<p><b>Portuguese Power Plugs</b>

<p>We've posted <a href="http://braga.yapceurope.org/index.cgi?PowerPlugs">on the wiki a couple of pictures of the power plugs used in Portugal</a> and some adaptors you may use; they're at PowerPlugs. Remember, electricity in Portugal is 220 volts (wouldn't want your laptop fried, now would we?)

<p><b>More stuff from O'Reilly</b>

<p>We have received some more books from O'Reilly (including some copies of "Tim O'Reilly in a Nutshell"), some postcards, some copies of "Perl Success Stories" and some more material.

<p><b>Morgan Kaufman's book to be signed</b>

<p>The "Higher Order Perl" book, by Mark Jason Dominus, from Morgan Kaufman, will be signed by the author before coming to our hands. The process has already started.

<p><b>There's a YAPC in Brasil</b>

<p>There's a YAPC in Brasil. The organizers of the two conferences (YAPC::Brasil and YAPC::EU) are going to help each others advertising the others' conference in their own country. Hopefully, this will result in more Brasilian Perl mongers in Portugal, and vice-versa.

<p><a href="http://www.yapc.org/Brasil/">YAPC::Brasil</a> will take place in June, in Porto Seguro, Brasil.

<p><b>And finally, where are you going?</b>

<p>Where are you going? Sure, you're going to Braga, right? But are you also going somewhere else?

<p>Let me put it this way: if we realize that a considerable portion of you is coming to Lisbon, for instance (before or after YAPC), we might consider gathering and putting some information about that city on the webpage.

<p>So this is what we want: if you're going to spend some time on some other city rather than Braga (a Portuguese city, hopefully), email us (or perhaps even the list, so that other people also going to the same place may get in touch with you) and we'll act accordingly.

<p><b>Behind the scenes action:</b>

<ul>
<li>A small backup plan has been devised just in case we get too many people at the conference (I call it a small plan because it currently supports only an excess of 30 to 40 people)</li>

<li>Another backup plan has been devised for the same purpose. It's better, in the sense that it will accomodate more people, but... there's some disadvantages to it... As soon as registration starts (any time, now), we'll be able to see if we really need it or not.</li>

<li>I let my pharyngitis escape.</li>
</ul>

<p>And that's it for now.

<p>If there's anything else you need, the organizers can be reached at yapc@perl-hackers.net

<p>Kind regards,

<p>Jose and Alberto</p>
