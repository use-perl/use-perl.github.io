<p>I thought I'd post this here because it would probably be faster to have someone tell me "Hey, I had that issue a while ago" than looking everything up myself :-)<br/><br/>Some of this stuff might not even be iBook related.<br/><br/>* fetchmail: it says "SMTP connect to localhost failed; I used Google and all I could find so far is that I should start up something like sendmail to fix the problem... but I'm not sure if this thing has something like sendmail and, if it has, what's its name :-|<br/><br/>* shortcut keys: where on Earth do I assign a key sequence for a new terminal? :-|<br/><br/>* wireless: I keep having to insert passwords and stuff every so often... I can't seem to find an option to store the login/password and make it all magically happen<br/><br/>I think that's it for now...<br/><br/>One thing that surprised me was: "What? No make? :-|"</p>

1. get and install QuickSilver http://quicksilver.blacktree.com<br> <br>It will make everything shortcuttified.<br> <br>2. install the Developer Tools, they're probably in<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/Installers<br> <br>They will give you gcc, make, and all that rot.  Also, Xcode.

Hi,<br> <br>I'm going to try and answer some of your questions, but I would recommend that you don't try to use the same tools you used before, with other unix'es. Yes, they will work, but you'll be fighting the system. Mac's are different, although they have a UNIX underneath they should be used in the way as Apple intended. It will all make sense after a little while, and IMHO you'll be better off.<br> <br>I use Mail.app with IMAP+SSL and SMTP+TLS (with authentication). You tell Mail.app to syncronize all your folders and messages so that you can work offline if you want to.<br> <br>1. fetchmail: Mac OS X uses postfix. See here for help http://wiki.nunonunes.org/tiki-index.php?page=PostfixConfiguration<br> <br>After that, it should work.<br> <br>2. use quicksilver to create global shortcuts. With quicksilver installed, Preferences &gt; Triggers, and create a new trigger to run a apple script.<br> <br>Use the following apple script:<br> <br>tell application "Terminal"<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; do script ("cd<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.")<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; activate<br>end tell<br> <br>Use script editor to save it (i place mine at ~/Library/Scripts/)<br> <br>3. almost everywhere that a password is requested, there is a checkbox to store it in the keychain... Use it<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br> <br>You might check your keychain preferences, btw. I don't remmember the default configuration but there are defaults for locking the keychina after some time.<br> <br>That's all for now.

My space key has started sticking. It works if he tap it close to the center but not on the ends.
