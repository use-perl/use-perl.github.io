<p>I don't even know where to begin...<br/><br/>The whole experience was wonderful, amazing, and fantastic.<br/><br/>I don't think I've ever been to a country that feels so civilized, organized, safe, and polite.<br/><br/>Some people have asked me whether I'd go back to Japan...<br/><br/>Well, my friends...<br/><br/>It's not a matter of "if", it's just a matter of "when".<br/><br/>Some big thank-you's:<br/><br/><b>The organizers</b><br/><br/>Miyagawa-san, you guys rock!<br/><br/>The sandwiches and the noodles soup was great, but you guys really went over the top with that fabulous sushi dinner.<br/><br/>The only reason I flew back to Portugal instead of rolling here was because I'd probably end up in Australia (which wouldn't be a bad thing, but $work was waiting for me).<br/><br/><b>The attendees</b><br/><br/>I've been very well treated everywhere I've been to, but Japanese people are so very, very polite, and I just couldn't find an exception to this rule.<br/><br/>I also met some Coreans there which made me think this is probably not something limited to Japan, but likely to be the state of mind in a considerable part of Asia.<br/><br/>Thank you so much to everyone.<br/><br/><b>The speakers</b><br/><br/>Oh yeah.<br/><br/>The selection of speakers was very, very good.<br/><br/>Thanks, guys.<br/><br/>/user/ Pleased to meet you... Hope you guess my name... ~/<br/><br/><b>Marty and Karen Pauley</b><br/><br/>My wonderful hosts, Marty and Karen Pauley.<br/><br/>You guys were great :-)<br/><br/>There's a place here in Portugal where I go to when I need to find peace of mind.<br/><br/>Your house and company has the same effect. I'd go there more often, if it just weren't so far.<br/><br/>Thanks for taking me to all those places, including Kamakura, Yokohama and, of course, the /(a?)mazing/ Karaoke bar ;-)<br/><br/>Thank you so, so very much.<br/><br/>And I'll see you two again in... Oh, a couple of hours! I have to pick you up at the airport, for the Portuguese Perl Workshop :-)<br/><br/>My turn to be the host :-)<br/><br/><b>Casey, Chastity and Schwern</b> (who also stayed at the Pauley's)<br/><br/>You guys were great to hang around with :-)<br/><br/>Schwern, if I end up addicted to EVE Online, it's all your fault (and a bit of Adam's too).</p>
