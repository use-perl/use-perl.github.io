<p>It has happened a couple of times and it just happened again two minutes ago.<br/><br/>I have it on, there's battery (45%), the power adaptor is not connected and I'm not touching it.<br/><br/>Suddenly, for no apparent reason, it turns off!<br/><br/>No, it doesn't go into sleeping mode, it simply dies on me! Everything's dead!<br/><br/>The only way I seem to get it working again is by pressing the power button, which makes it start as if I had turned it off normally before that. Needless to say, all the windows I had open are now lost into oblivion.<br/><br/>What the hell is going on?? Is this thing broken??</p>

This is not normal, is it?

Though for me, it's on a WinXP laptop.
<p>To me, it happens if the CPU has been extremely busy for more than a few minutes. I believe that this may be a selfprotection mechanism, that kicks in when the CPU is getting too hot. Every time it did happen so far, there was hot air coming out of the ventilation grid holes.
</p><p>Now I know a PC and an iBook are not related at all, but it could be something similar, no?</p>

I get this when I have the laptop (PC) on the bed, I think it overheats when it's on the soft duvet.
So if I want to watch a DVD in bed I have to sit with it sort of balanced between my knees to make sure it doesn't overheat.  I did try putting it on a fairly thick plastic folder (on the basis that it's solid, kind of like a desk - as it manages to work for a whole day on one of those) but that doesn't seem to work either.

If the problem is overheating... and it's winter...

<p>Oh gosh, I don't even want to think about it...<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-(</p>
