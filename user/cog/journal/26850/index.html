<p><i>Brook's law:</i>
        <i>Adding man power to a late software project makes it later</i><br/><br/>Not always.<br/><br/>I am living proof that Brook's law not always prevails. No, it's not because I'm extremely good in what I do (&lt;joke&gt;which I am, of course, cough, cough&lt;/joke&gt;), it's just that Brook's law doesn't account for every possible scenario.<br/><br/>In this case, I was called to the rescue to perform a task that the main team could do anyway, but that could also be done by an outsider (thus saving precious time to that team), because it was a self-contained task for which no deep knowledge of the project was required. I simply (yeah, simply, I'll tell you about "simply") had to migrate a database, which proved to be a real PITA, but was doable anyway.<br/><br/>The project was late when I got there and was still late after I left, and the day after they told me the migration would have to be done again with some different specs over the destiny database (another PITA), but my point remains: the project was late, I was there, I finished my task, and I didn't delay the project further.<br/><br/>Hence, Brook's law not always holds.</p>

Actually, Brooks said that with the same caveat that you did. From <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/jplindstrom/journal/12254" title="perl.org">my notes</a perl.org> (not quotes) when I read the book:<br><br><i>Tasks can be implemented in parallell only if they are independent and require no communication effort on the part of the designers/programmers. If not, the communication effort adds overhead which may overcome the effect of more people.<br></i><br>



<h2>Correct</h2>

jplindstrom is correct in his reply -- Brooks Law is usually quoted out of conext.<br><br>In justifying his law, Brooks specifically cited the increasing number of interpersonal interfaces  (n**2) and the ramp-up time of the new staff (and the concomittant investment required by the existing staff in the new staff's ramp-up. If Rent on a pickup is less than on a bulldozer, or if there's a premium for early completion advantage; or if Supervisors get paid double rate<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...)<br><br>Splitting non-core tasks off and out-sourcing them is out of scope for Brooks law, always was. Brooks recognized that while 9 Women can not make a baby in one month, those same 9 women CAN clear as many acres in a month as one woman could in 9 months (if they *each* get a bulldozer and map, fuel,<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...).<br><br>(There *are* many hidden IFs regarding logistics - one working alone must do all his/her own logistics, whereas one of the 9 will be a logistics / supervisor with a pickup , so now you have 9 workers and get 8 person-months worth of work done with 9 person-months expended in 1 month, as compared to about the same 8 months worth of work done by one person in 9 months if she does her own supplies &amp; logistics. Economies of scale may help, if the team meetings and Reporting doesn't eat the savings. The Bonus for Early Completion _should_ overwhelm the savings or overhead. Should.)<br><br>Brooks, Mythical Man Month, <a href="http://isbn.nu/0201835959" title="isbn.nu">http://isbn.nu/0201835959</a isbn.nu>
