<div class="span8">
<p>Last year, while talking with Leon Brocard, he told me he felt he had good sense of orientation because of games... I disagreed, since I had also played games for a very long time and I would get lost quite easily... or so I thought!!<br/><br/>Last weekend I was in this contest in which 96 pairs fought, among other things, to reach a given point in the city (not even knowing where we were at first). So, after being first two out of three times, I must conclude I have good sense of orientation (at least I always know which way is north :-) ).<br/><br/>So what made me think I had bad sense of orientation after all? Well, after giving it some thought, it seems I just tend to follow directions too strictly... If someone says "take the second on the right", I will go through the second minor thing I fit in (1) :-) And that's why I have trouble finding places :-)<br/><br/>This means you always have to give me strict directions or very few directions and let me find things out myself :-)<br/><br/>So, Leon... you might be right... maybe it's all the Quakes and Dooms and stuff :-)<br/><br/>jac<br/><br/>(1) - This could be taken as a result of trying to find secret areas ;-)</p>
