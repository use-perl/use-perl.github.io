<p>In some cities, there are Portuguese flags every other window.<br/><br/>I could just say something like: "If only I had an euro for each flag..."<br/><br/>Instead, I'm going to say: "If only I had an euro for each flag placed backwards or upside down..." O:-)</p>

Yesterday I saw something that just shocked me... In the Italy - Denmark game there were many empty seats !!! FFS, you have a Euro championship in your country and people don't go to watch games ? Couldn't they just give some free tickets to school kids, or something...<p>
Also, did you guys *really* build 10 new stadiums for this ? This is impressive.</p>

<i>many empty seats !!!</i>

<p>I'm not aware of what is happening, but I heard there were people giving up
to see the games... which is weird...<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-| People buy the tickets and then they
don't go there???

</p><p> <i>Also, did you guys *really* build 10 new stadiums for this?</i>

</p><p>Yep... lots of controversy here...<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-) Many used to say it wasn't worth it and
all that... now you should see them posing for the pictures<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)

</p><p>Some of the stadiums already existed... they just built new ones next to them
and, in some cases, demolished the old ones, in other cases, made them
available for other teams... but yes, 10 new stadiums were built... (this *is* a weird country)

</p><p> <i>This is impressive.</i>

</p><p>Impressive? I find it amazing to see a stadium like <a href="http://www.stadiumguide.com/dragao.htm" title="stadiumguide.com">this one</a stadiumguide.com> (1) being erected in less then 6
months!!!<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-| I usually pass there (2) on the weekend and I did not think they
were actually going to make it in time...<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-| Well, I guess they had probably
already done all the hard work before...<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

</p><p>(1) - BTW, the pictures there, apparently, are from the time it was still
being finished.

</p><p>(2) - On the last picture, on the top right... see the road?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>
