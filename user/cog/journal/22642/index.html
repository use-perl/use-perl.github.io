<p>Having an iBook is really, really great. It behaves nicely, it looks cool, it's
fast and, so far, reliable, I don't have to wait for it to shutdown/startup, I
simply close it when I'm done and open it when I need it and it takes less than
10 seconds (maybe 2 or 3) to go into or out of sleep mode.<br/><br/>One thing that is good to have around is someone who already knows of all the
trouble of setting up a Mac computer, because that really saves time :-)<br/><br/>So far, I'm pretty pleased with this thing.<br/><br/>Current problems:<br/><br/>* I'd like to use the middle mouse button to open new tabs on Firefox, but I have no idea of how to do that yet (not I've tried very hard anyway)<br/><br/>* I can't compile anything :-| I'll try to install gcc sometime during the day (as soon as I get the time) to see if that solves the problem<br/><br/>I guess that's it for now :-)</p>

<h2>What about perl?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Beatnik/">Beatnik</a> on 2005-01-10T15:51:54</h3>
The iBook I tested had perl 5.8.3 (IIRC) but installing perl modules seemed a bit uhm hard. For the brief moment I had it, the user management on iBook seemed to prevent me from installing stuff. It complained about an administrator user?!? It was a default set-up tho.

First I had to install wget (there was no wget) in order to get the modules with CPAN;<br> <br>than I discovered I wasn't able to install modules that required compilation;<br> <br>than I discovered I wasn't able to install *anything* that required compilation;<br> <br>than I discovered there was probably a problem with gcc because I couldn't even compile a simple C Hello World...<br> <br>and that's where I am right now<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-| I've already downloaded gcc but hadn't got the time yet to try and install it, because I'm still receiving training on Bricolage (hurray!)<br> <br>I'm not sure what to think of this (the Perl issue) yet<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-|<br> <br>And no, there is absolutely no f*ck*ng possible way I'll drop Perl to start coding in something else<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

<h2>Just install the developers tools...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Elian/">Elian</a> on 2005-01-10T18:06:32</h3>
Apple ships a full set of dev tools, including gcc, make, and all the rest of the command line stuff you'd be used to, as well as a very nice set of GUI tools (Interface Builder and XCode). The install's optional since a lot of folks just don't need it, but it is there to install and it is free.<br> <br>Poke around and see if you don't have a developers tools installer somewhere on the machine, and if you don't then see if there's a dev tools disk in the set of CDs/DVDs that ship with Apple machines.<br> <br>If that doesn't get you anywhere, pop over to connect.apple.com, which is apple's developers connection website. You can register for a free account which'll let you download the latest releases of a lot of stuff, including the dev tools. (It's 300+M, so don't expect it to be <i>fast</i>, but it's there for the getting)

I've already installed the dev tools, but I still have that issue with gcc<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br> <br>I'm going to take a look at connect.apple.com<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

Try reinstalling, since something's apparently gone wrong. (You should have gcc in<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/usr/bin/gcc, so you wouldn't even need to fire off a new Terminal session to get it into your path) I don't remember the dev tools installer being particularly stingy in its defaults, but it can't hurt to customize the install and make sure everything gets installed. It's only disk space, after all...<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

Apparently, I'm missing some libs<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-|<br> <br>Not that I'm a gcc expert, but I think that both `echo $LD_LIBRARY_PATH` and `locate crt1.o`<br>should return some output, but they don't<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-|<br> <br>And yet, trying to compile a simple program returns me an "ld: can't locate file for: -lcrt1.o" error...<br> <br>This is not normal, is it?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-|

LD_LIBRARY_PATH is likely empty (I don't have one and GCC works just fine) though crt1.o should be in<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/usr/lib. Definitely looks like something's toast in your install, which is really weird -- Apple is generally <i>very</i> good about making sure the right stuff gets installed.<br> <br>A quick poke at the Shub-internet shows that this is a symptom of the DevSDK package not being installed, so you might want to fire up the dev tools installer and make sure that one's installed.
