<div class="span8">
<p>First, let me reconstruct what happened:

<p>My throat <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/cog/journal/23244">had been hurting now and then</a> for about three weeks.

<p>Last week I went to <a href="http://natura.di.uminho.pt/join2005">JOIN</a>... I was the guy in the front row, with his coat and gloves dressed and still shaking... at lunch, I had no appetite and the only thing I managed to eat was an apple... as a plus, each time I'd try to get up I would almost lose balance and fall... and off I went to bed...

<p>I went to a doctor late in the evening and I spent the rest of the week in a bed, at Magda's place.

<p>Anyway, now <b>I'm getting better</b>. I think I'm still a bit shaken, but at least yesterday I managed to get up and drive to Viana, and my throat doesn't hurt as much as it did in the beginning of the week.

<p>Speaking of bad things, I have three boxes of pills. One of them I have to take to the last pill...

<p>Now... that thing tastes <b>*so*</b> bad that twice already I almost threw up; I actually had to put a hand in front of my mouth to prevent myself from doing it!!

<p>I have to take three of those pills each day... and you know what's worse?

<p><b>Five</b> days worth of pills still left...</p>
