<div class="span8">
<p>A while ago I was having a discussion about smoking laws with some co-workers of mine.<br/><br/>Aside from whether it should be allowed to smoke in closed places, public places, etc, I mentioned the fact that people smoking on the street can be annoying too.<br/><br/>My point was that when I cross someone on the street who's smoking a cigarrette I have to put up with the smoke for a little while. Somebody said "Yeah, but it's just while you're passing the person by..."<br/><br/>That doesn't matter. Be it 5 seconds or 2 minutes, be it just the moment when the person lits up the cigarrette or the whole experience, it still annoys me and makes me cough. People smoking on the street annoy me, because I'm forced to inhale their smoke.<br/><br/>You might say "oh, you're not forced too."<br/><br/>Am I not?<br/><br/>4, 7, 4, 5, 6, 3, 2, 5.<br/><br/>That's the number of times I was forced to inhale smoke during the last eight days.<br/><br/>Sometimes just 5 seconds, sometimes a bit more.<br/><br/>Sometimes just someone passing you by on the street, sometimes someone in the step beneath you in a slowly-moving-escalator when you have no way to escape. Quite frankly, this pisses me off more and more each day.<br/><br/>Just to make it perfectly clear, I actually hold my breath some times. If I go down the street and see somebody coming in my direction smoking, I actually inhale before I get to the person and either hold my breath or exhale while I'm passing the person.<br/><br/>Those numbers are actually the ones I wasn't able to avoid.<br/><br/>That's 36 cigarrettes of which I was forced to inhale some part of during the last eight days.<br/><br/>Today, when I went out for lunch, the number was 6.<br/><br/>It annoys me and it annoys even more to know that these people who smoke have absolutely no idea of how much it does so.<br/><br/>To quote an old man I once saw in a train talking about the subject: "You have no respect for me if you lit up that cigarrette."</p>

My wife used to work at a small store.<br>  <br>Customers, smoking, would walk up to the door, take that last huge drag off their cigarette, throw the butt in the ashtray by the door, then walk in and exhale in her direction, a huge cloud of fetid smoke.<br> <br>  So enjoyable, that lovely second hand smoke.

<h2>Holding one's breath</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/autarch/">autarch</a> on 2005-08-16T16:34:27</h3>
I do that all the time myself.  If I see someone on the sidewalk smoking, I get a good breath at least 10 feet in advance.  If they're walking the same direction as me and I'm catching up, I'll often slow down.<br><br>I really think that nobody should ever smoke in public, except in some sort of designated smoking location.  It's just fucking rude to inflict your toxins on someone else.<br><br>I have mixed feelings about legislating this sort of thing.  On one hand, I love the restaurant/bar smoking ban here in Minneapolis.  Concerts are so much more enjoyable.  OTOH, because it's just Hennepin county, and the ban in neighboring Ramsey county exempts bars, it really hurts the Hennepin county bars.  This sort of things needs to happen state-wide, or better yet nation-wide, in order to not unfairly hurt some businesses.<br><br>And then there's the whole thing that laws suck.  People should just act civilly.  I know that's awfully idealistic, but my anarchist side says more laws are bad.

<p>You know what&#8217;s worse? I live close to a stadium, and there&#8217;s a convention taking place right now. The air is wafting this way, so my entire neighbourhood faintly smells of cigarette smoke right now.</p>

<p>The biggest irony of them all is it&#8217;s a <a href="http://www.wjt2005.de/" title="wjt2005.de">Christian convention</a wjt2005.de>.</p>

Are you sure it is cigarette smoke?  Perhaps they are <a href="http://thebricktestament.com/judges/gideon_demands_a_sign/jg06_19-20.html" title="thebricktestament.com">making offerings</a thebricktestament.com>.<br>

I do appreciate humour, but yes, I am pretty certain that what I smell is the smoke of cigarettes.<nobr> <wbr></nobr><tt>:-)</tt>

HATING HATING HATING<br><br>On my big euro backpacking holiday I was heading down through Spain to Morocco to go climb a mountain, but in the end I decided to turn around and go the other way, because the number of people smoking just got so insanely high.<br><br>And with outright bans on smoking even in pubs here in AU, maybe I can return to drinking socially again soon<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
