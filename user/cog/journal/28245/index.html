<p>For a couple of days, a known bank here in Portugal decided to throw "artificial snow" from the windows of a hotel in a famed Lisbon plaza.<br/><br/>Most people who heard about this found the idea to be very cool...<br/><br/>That's because they weren't there.<br/><br/>I passed the place to catch a bus. The road where the bus was supposed to pass was blocked, so I (and a bunch of other people) were at a complete loss as to where to catch it.<br/><br/>A policeman approached us and said "Are you waiting for the bus? It's not coming here. Go down that road at the right and wait for it there."<br/><br/>So we did.<br/><br/>To get there, we had to pass beneath the snow throwers...<br/><br/><b>Now for the snow.</b><br/><br/>You look up at it, seeing it fall down, and think "that doesn't look like snow..."<br/><br/>That's because it isn't.<br/><br/>It's soap!<br/><br/>So now you have soap falling on your head, and you're amazed as to why there are so many families taking photos of each others, smiling with their heads covered in soap^Wsnow...<br/><br/>I mean... that's something you can do at home, in the shower... ;-)<br/><br/>As for the bus, the drivers hadn't been told about anything, and were caught by surprise. I was lucky to spot the 22 and I went there to speak to the driver. I managed to get in, but the bus was about 15 - 20 minutes late because of the detour it had to take.<br/><br/>The old man waiting for the 48 wasn't as lucky as I was, and roamed to another place the 22 driver pointed him too, but even him said "...but I'm not sure. If I was the 48 driver, that's where I'd stop..."<br/><br/>Hurray for sharp minds at that bank.<br/><br/>Fortunately, the soap comes off easily. The only annoying thing is that they advertise "artificial snow" and then they hit you with soap, while blocking the road where at least 6 buses stop every 20 minutes each...</p>
