<p>Greetings :-)<br/><br/>The organizers of YAPC::EU::2005 would like you all to know how things are going.<br/><br/>This is report #14 and here are some details:<br/><br/><b>More subscribers on the mailing list</b><br/><br/>Yesterday we sent an email to people on Act that weren't on this mailing list, asking them to subscribe it.<br/><br/>We now have over 250 people here, and growing.<br/><br/><b>More hotels with special prices</b><br/><br/>"Hotel Parque", "Hotel Elevador" and "Hotel do Templo" contacted us with special rates for the conference.<br/><br/>These are four star hotels.<br/><br/>There are still three recommended hotels for the conference (one of which is completely booked already), but we now have 7 hotels with special rates, which is great.<br/><br/>These new three are located on top of the mountain, which is a very good place to hang around.<br/><br/>Check BragaHotels for more information.<br/><br/><b>Conference dinner</b><br/><br/>Looks like we're going to have a conference dinner afterall. The price is included in the registration. For non-attendees going to this dinner we will probably have a price, but just not right now.<br/><br/>The dinner is going to be held on Thursday, at the University canteen.<br/><br/>The food will be Portuguese. If you really want to know, it's called "RojÃÂµes" (it's meat; it's pork; keep reading if you're a vegetarian).<br/><br/>At this point, this is all the information we have, and even this can change at some point. We'll keep you posted.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, if you're a vegetarian, contact us.<br/><br/>If you're bringing someone with you, contact us.<br/><br/>The conference dinner also brings me to the next point, which is...<br/><br/><b>REGISTER YOURSELF</b><br/><br/>And convince your friends to register themselves too, if they're coming.<br/><br/>If you know you're coming, please do take the time to register yourself at <a href="http://conferences.yapceurope.org/2005/register">http://conferences.yapceurope.org/2005/register</a>.<br/><br/>It takes about 50 seconds, on average.<br/><br/>For the conference dinner, for instance, we have to say now how many people we're expecting. We can make a few arrangements to that number in the beginning of August, but nothing fancy. I assume we can also show up with a few more people than expected, but if lots of people we were not counting with show up... You get the point :-)<br/><br/><b>Behind the scenes action:</b><br/><br/>    * Volunteers keep being drafted and tasks keep being assigned. More on a future report;
    * More logistic problems being solved;
    * Meanwhile, the battle for attendees keeps on going. Portugal is on the lead with 66 people (38 commited). UK follows with 46 (29 commited). Afterwards we have Sweden and Germany with 11 each, Netherlands with 10 and United States with 9.
      The complete list of countries can be found <a href="http://conferences.yapceurope.org/2005/stats">here</a>
      As for cities, London seems to be on the lead with 14 people. Lisbon follows, with 11 (4 of which insist of writing Lisbon as Lisboa or even Lx). After that we have Braga 7, Birmingham 5, Porto 5, Stockholm 5.
      The complete list of cities can be found at <a href="http://conferences.yapceurope.org/2005/stats?show=cities">here</a>
      From the 195 people registered with Act, 123 are already commited, which means that they either paid their conference ticket or will give a talk.<br/><br/>And that's it for now.<br/><br/>As always, the organizers can be reached at yapc@perl-hackers.net<br/><br/>Kind regards,<br/><br/>Jose and Alberto<br/><br/><b>Note 1:</b> You can find the YAPC::EU::2005::FAQ at <a href="http://braga.yapceurope.org/index.cgi?FAQ">http://braga.yapceurope.org/index.cgi?FAQ</a><br/><br/><b>Note 2:</b> You can find the previous reports from the <a href="http://braga.yapceurope.org/index.cgi?SiteMap">YAPC::EU::2005 SiteMap</a> (bottom of the page)</p>
