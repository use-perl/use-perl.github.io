<p>So <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/domm/">domm</a> processed the Kwalitee ratings again and came up with some <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/domm/journal/23838">highscores</a>.

<p>The fact that I rank <b>7th out of 341</b> people pleases me very much, thank you O:-)

<p>But enough about me :-D Let's talk about you ;-)

<p>Do you have modules on the CPAN? If so, how did you perform relative to Kwalitee? If you're thinking "oh, that doesn't bother me"... well it should!

<p>It should because the metrics have been well thought so far, and having higher Kwalitee means your modules satisfy a bunch of standards that are really good to the CPAN.

<p>Anyway, there are some very interesting <a href="http://cpants.dev.zsi.at/graphs.html">graphs here</a>. The <a href="http://cpants.dev.zsi.at/active_cpan_ids.png">second one</a>, in particular, comes to confirm my suspicions: that a bunch of people apply for CPAN IDs and then don't upload any code!

<p>Hey, I'm not complaining about those people, I'm not! But there is something wrong, ain't there? Do they find it too hard to create a module? (<a href="http://perlmonks.org/?node_id=431702">hint, hint</a>) Do they lose interest for several reasons? Do they suddenly evaporate after clicking the submit button?

<p>:-|

<p>Perhaps it's a bit of everything... apart from the evaporation process, I'd hope...

<p>Anyway, just my $0.02 :-)

<p>Yours, with Kwalitee, cog</p>

<h2>7th?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jk2addict/">jk2addict</a> on 2005-03-25T19:00:46</h3>
Bah!<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-) I'd just uploaded my 6th module right before domm made the latest run, otherwise I'de be in the first list instead of 2nd in the =5 modules list.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-P<br> <br>For some reason I've become retardedly obsessed with those high scores lists. Maybe that's the point?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)



<h2>Empty CPAN directories</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Aristotle/">Aristotle</a> on 2005-03-25T23:15:15</h3>
<p>When I applied for my PAUSE ID, I had plans for several modules. The main one I still intend to pu up there has non-trivial distribution issues; the other has done better by someone else in the meantime. I have taken over maintenance of two other modules so far, one of which I haven&#8216;t done anything with, the other being Gtk::HandyCList which is the only thing I have uploaded, but only to deprecate it in the first place. If it hadn&#8216;t been for that one my directory would still be empty. I am now looking to take over another module which I have more concrete plans for.</p>

<p>I don&#8216;t know. There are a lot of half-designed projects in my head but very few of them ever even result in a new empty source file, let alone a released distribution. My hacking skills appear to be respectable, from what I can tell about them, but they&#8216;re currently not worth much, as I never put them to use on anything. I need to do something about my motivation&#8230;</p>
