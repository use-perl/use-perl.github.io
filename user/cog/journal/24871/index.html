<div class="span8">
<p>A quick description of some of the tools I use the most in my <b>iBook</b>:

<p><b>iTunes</b> - Back in the days when I used Windows there was Winamp. After some time I switched to Red Hat and I discovered mplayer. Nowadays, I still use mplayer a lot, but all of my musics are organized and played from within iTunes, which is a great tool for this effect (not perfect, but very good indeed).

<p><b>Desktop Manager</b> - People have told me, when I switched to a Mac, that I would never have to use multiple desktops again, since I'd now be able to see all my windows at the same time, just a little bit minimized so they'd all fit the screen... those people have clearly never used a dozen or two terminals, browser, music player, mail viewer, talker and others at the same time. Desktop Manager is a *must*, for me. YMMV.

<p><b>QuickSilver</b> - I don't think I make as much use of it as possible, but it's a great utility. Just type Control+Space and start typing the name of the application you want to start. Wonderful for launching applications you don't really want to have on the desktop or in the dock.

<p><b>Sidetrack</b> - This little one allows me to use my touchpad in the same way (actually, in an even better way) I used it in my Compaq.

<p><b>Firefox</b> - Need I say more? Some people keep telling me how great Safari is... Nope, Firefox for me, please. The power of its extensions is too good to be thrown away.

<p><b>Adium</b> - The first messaging program I used in this iBook was Proteus. It has some serious flaws... Now I'm using Adium, and so far... so good.

<p>and regarding mail... well, even though <b>Mail</b> has the advantage of integrating with the rest of the system, its power is still faaaaaaaaaaaaaar behind the one of Mutt :-)

<p>There are more, but I'll leave them for another entry :-)</p>

Dozens of terminals?  Do you use <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/screen/" title="gnu.org">screen</a gnu.org>?

The reason why I use "dozens of terminals" is the same why I don't use screen<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

<p>Memory issues<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

</p> <p>Even though I have a to do list, I won't look at it unless it is open and in a desktop I'll pass by, from time to time (and even then...)

</p> <p>I use a script I made some time ago to keep track of the money I spend... but I forget to note things down unless I have a terminal with it...

</p> <p>And so on, and so on...

</p> <p>So what I'm left with is a terminal for each of (might be missing something):

</p> <ul>

<li>to do list</li>
<li>yapc to do list</li>
<li>the next report for yapc</li>
<li>upcoming events</li>
<li>expenses</li>
<li>email (I use Mutt for personal mail)</li>
<li>MOOsaico</li>

</ul>

<p>Plus:

</p> <ul>

<li>one terminal for each writing project I'm doing (usually three to five)</li>
<li>a couple of terminals for whatever project I'm working on</li>
<li>two or three more terminals if I'm working on one of my modules</li>

</ul>

<p>As you can see, I'm already at about fifteen, and I haven't listed everything, just what came up to my mind O:-)

</p> <p>Yes, I know it's weird, but it works<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>

Try using Fire if you're not totally convinced that what you're using fits your needs.  I don't have a URL, but you can find it on versiontracker.<p>John</p>
