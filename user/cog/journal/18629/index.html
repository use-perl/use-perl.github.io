<p>Yesterday, for the first time in my life, I gave a try to KFC (not many KFC's in Portugal, but plenty of McDonalds everywhere)...<br/><br/>Is it just me, the bad luck, or that thing really sucks? :-\ I mean, a McChicken is much softer, and I don't have to grasp the burguer and bite it too hard, but a Colonel..? Oh, man...</p>

Going to KFC for a sandwich is not the best idea, IMHO.  Their chicken strips are pretty good.  Their fried chicken pieces range from "not bad" to "not not bad," depending on the day.  If I go to a KFC, which is rare, I get strips or "popcorn chicken" and biscuits.  Their mashed potatoes, like a lot of fast food, are disgusting but enjoyable if you're in the right mood.

Now I don't know whether to give that a try or wait till my mind forgets about yesterday first...<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

Take your time.  KFC (probably) won't go away overnight.  If you want<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/good/ fast-food chicken (and good, here, is relative to other fast-food) find a Chick-Fil-A.<br> <br>Unfortunately, I think they're only in the US.  So... well.  They're OK.

<p>Whenever I go to KFC I feel disappointed if I get anything other than the Original fried chicken.  However, I'm a fried chicken lover (I'm distinguishing fried chicken as in complete pieces, 8 per chicken, bones 'n' all, from chicken patty sandwiches, etc.); those who don't like this style of food probably wouldn't like KFC's main items.  Can't say much about the sandwiches; I've liked them all right the few times I've tried them, but I like the plain chicken so much it just seems like a waste to get a sandwich there.</p>

<p>I second the vote for Chick-Fil-A.  Top notch.</p>

<h2>Gotta have them in the US.</h2>

KFC just doesn't seem to work outside the US, just like bagels don't work outside New York, philly cheesesteak really does need to be in philly, barbeque has to be in North Carolina, and so on.<br> <br>Curiously, it's the first food I had when I got back to Rhode Island from our mob station (because it was on our side of the road and on the way to the hotel).  Finally, some good biscuits.  In Kuwait, they don't even have biscuits with KFC.
