<p>First, Sapo.<br/><br/>They said we'd have to wait 3 to 8 weekdays, and they quickly sent us a login and a password, indeed... which don't work.<br/><br/>Each time you call them, you have to dial in a bunch of information, from your telephone number to your username, wait about 10 minutes, and then you get to speak to a person who asks you for the very same data you just so painfully inserted. This is really stupid and I've seen more people complaining about this.<br/><br/>Then they (try to) figure out who you really have to talk to and 10 more minutes pass while you wait for your call to be answered by somebody else.<br/><br/>The commercial department keeps saying we must have an ATM machine or an alarm system on the same line, or that perhaps our line doesn't have ADSL coverage yet, and on they pass us to the techies.<br/><br/>The techies control and verify everything, which takes an extra 10 minutes, tell you *everything*'s OK and that you should tell that to the commercial guys. 10 more minutes and... FFS!!!!<br/><br/>Can't they just talk to each other? Or at least pick up the phone a bit more promptly?<br/><br/>AAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!<br/><br/>OK, enough about Sapo.<br/><br/><i>Ladies and gentlemen, please give a warming welcome to our new contestant for the "most anoying company award"</i><br/><br/>Oni enters.<br/><br/>If you've been reading my journal, you know by now that everything's settled with Oni. The contract has been dissolved, we decided and notified them we would keep the equipment and would not be refunded.<br/><br/>Now comes the weird part of it...<br/><br/>We just received... A BILL!!!!<br/><br/>An amazingly f*ck*ngl* detailed bill, which even includes the dates we've been on the internet and all that!<br/><br/>Nothing special about it, weren't it for the fact that we *never* had internet access!!!<br/><br/>AAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!</p>
