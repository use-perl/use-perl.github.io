<p>"Loja do CidadÃÂ£o" (literally "Citizen's Shop") seems to be a concept foreign people are usually not familiar with, so I'll start by explaining it, and then I'll go on with my little adventure (or at least part of it).<br/><br/>During your usual month, you probably have to pay gas, water, electricity... perhaps cable tv...<br/><br/>You might even have to take care of some paper work for your car, go to the bank, send a letter, get a passport, pay your taxes...<br/><br/>Imagine a building where you can find all the entities you have to deal with for these things (and more).<br/><br/>Exactly, that's the kind of shop this is, and, mind you, it was a great idea!<br/><br/>Imagine you just moved. You'll have to go to a bunch of these places to get some of the basic necessities for your new life (and some other not so basic, OK).<br/><br/>Having everything in the same place saves you a *lot* of time.<br/><br/>Anyway, my little adventure:<br/><br/>One person coming to Braga needs me to get him a paper certified (or something like that, details are irrelevant for my point).<br/><br/>First I went to the "Governo Civil", which is the entity that issues passports and, out of the two possible ones for what I needed, the one with the smallest line.<br/><br/>There were two counters.<br/><br/>You always have to take a ticket with a number, and then you wait for your number to be called.<br/><br/>The informations counter had about 20 people in front of me. The other one had over 100!! I'm glad I only had to go to the informations one. They told me I was at the wrong place.<br/><br/>So I went to the other place, "SEF - ServiÃÂ§os de Estrangeiros e Fronteiras" (Foreigners and Frontiers Services).<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I couldn't even take a number. There was a sign there stating something like "Due to the great affluence to our service we had to stop issuing tickets. We apologize for the inconvenience."<br/><br/>My point here is this: Even though these "Shops" really are a great idea, some services have more demand than others. Sure, they already get bigger spaces and more people.<br/><br/><b>That's not enough!</b><br/><br/>Make them bigger!<br/><br/>Get more people!<br/><br/>Also, I'm not sure that only two of these things for a city like Lisbon are enough.<br/><br/>So, anyway, it's a good idea, and it should be improved.<br/><br/>So now I'm trying to call them and Alberto will probably go to the Shop in Braga tomorrow.<br/><br/>Stay tuned.</p>
