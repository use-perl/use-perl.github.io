<p>Here are a few random thoughts on YAPC::NA<br/><br/>1)<br/><br/>I wasn't sharing a bedroom with anyone, I was by myself.<br/><br/>That was a good thing, since I actually forgot to take a pajama to Toronto.<br/><br/>2)<br/><br/>I took over 600 pictures, during this trip.<br/><br/>I also have 10 to 20 movies.<br/><br/>This actually poses as a problem...<br/><br/>How the hell am I going to put up all that stuff on my homepage?<br/><br/>3)<br/><br/>I met people from all over the world: India, Japan... even Canada, who would've thought...<br/><br/>I even met two people who spoke Portuguese.<br/><br/>One of them dreams of going back to Portugal.<br/><br/>The other one apparently will go there, for YAPC::EU.<br/><br/>4)<br/><br/>Whenever I travel to these things, my English gets better everyday that passes.<br/><br/>I think my brain simply adjusts to it.<br/><br/>Sure, it's still sucky, I guess, but it's way better in the last day than in the first one.<br/><br/>Actually, I guess the changing point is when you start thinking in English even without noticing.<br/><br/>5)<br/><br/>Toronto is a very nice city.<br/><br/>It's warm, clean, spacy...<br/><br/>And the architecture is just great.<br/><br/>I learned a bunch of stories about lots of Canadian buildings, including the one where there used to be a lawyer who would throw himself against the window (of a 30th floor or something) to prove people that the glass wouldn't break...<br/><br/>I'll take it as you can guess the end of that story...<br/><br/>I also saw a building that's actually bathed in gold...<br/><br/>6)<br/><br/>You know those things with just two wheels, you stand on top of them, you lean forward and on they go, you lean backwards and back they come?<br/><br/>I tried one of those.<br/><br/>I could get used to that thing :-)<br/><br/>If... it weren't so expensive, of course :-)<br/><br/>Also, I don't think Lisbon would be a good city to use one.<br/><br/>Toronto might be.<br/><br/>7)<br/><br/>I keep getting the sensation that earth's magnetic field messes up with my brain.<br/><br/>I actually feel something different when I'm far away from my point of origin.<br/><br/>Well... it could be jetlag...<br/><br/>Nevermind :-)<br/><br/>8)<br/><br/>I found out Abigail's gender for real.<br/><br/>I'm not telling.<br/><br/>And I'm sure there's more, but that's it for now :-)</p>
