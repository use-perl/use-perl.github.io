<p><a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0319061">Big Fish</a>, <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0315733">21 Grams</a> and <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0093779">The Princess Bride</a>. (hey, I don't have internet at home yet, what else am I to do?)<br/><br/>All listed on the <a href="http://imdb.com">IMDB</a> <a href="http://imdb.com/chart/top">top 250 movies</a>, and all very good movies.<br/><br/>Anyway, Big Fish and The Princess Bride are very enjoyable movies, both of which you can see with the family.<br/><br/>21 Grams, a good movie too, is not a light one, and it certainly isn't one of those flourished and happy flicks. You do not want to show this one to your kids, but you might want to see it anyway.<br/><br/>Big Fish surprised me, mostly because I had no idea what it was about. Speaking of which, I won't tell you much about these movies, because I don't want to spoil the fun out of anyone.<br/><br/>The Princess Bride was a special case for me. I once saw part of it when I was a kid, showing on a TV at a dentist office, IIRC.<br/><br/>The fact that I have a very good memory made the part of the movie I saw echo in my mind through all these years. I eventually found out (from the movie poster) the name of the movie, and yesterday I finally managed to see it. And I liked. It's even better than I imagined :-) (did I mention I have a very good memory? I know I wanted to mention that, I just don't know whether I already did...)<br/><br/>Anyway, see these movies when you have the time. I don't think you'll regret it.<br/><br/>Oh, wait, if you don't like movies jumping back and forth in time, you might be confused with 21 Grams. I know I usually like that kind of movie, but this one almost blew my head up :-\<br/><br/>Oh, and just in case you're thinking "The Princess Bride? Is it any good? Has it got any sports in it?", my answer would be "Are you kidding? Fencing! Fighting! Torture! Revenge! Giants! Monsters! Chases! Escapes! True love! Miracles!" :-)<br/><br/>Go see :-)</p>

Me no think it means what you think it means.<br><br>I chuckle every time I see Cary Ewles in X-Files or Mandy Patinkin in Dead Like Me. They'll never be anything other than PRincess Bride in my mind.

I enjoyed the movie, but I enoyed the book more.  (My wife didn't like the movie - she thought the movie did not match the book in quality.)<br/><br/>So, try reading the book and see whether it lives up to the movie for you.
