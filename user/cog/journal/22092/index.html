<p>I had been told I was supposed to show this thing working on Friday. I still am. And I will.

<p>But meanwhile, yesterday, late in the evening, they told me I'd be going to a meeting with the client this morning (in less than an hour) to show the system working...

<p>...

<p>...

<p>Say what?

<p>...

<p>...

<p>Come again?

<p>...

<p>...

<p>WHAT???

<p>...

<p>...

<p>And the problem is that the guy who schedulled the meeting did it in such a way that he's not able to go... In fact, no other local boss is able to go!!

<p>As a plus, I do need some more help from the guys back in Portugal to put this thing up, and they told me this *after* people back home had left (*way* late in the evening). And there's more! Today is a holiday back in Portugal, so there's no one there!!

<p>...

<p>So this is it... in a moment or two I shall be leaving to the client, with a girl who works here too (or worked, I don't know...)

<p>I don't even know what I'll say...

<p>Man...

<p>Wish me luck :-|</p>

<h2>Good luck!</h2>

and beat those pointy haired bosses with a pointy stick!



<h2>Why didn't...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jdavidboyd/">jdavidboyd</a> on 2004-12-04T16:08:37</h3>
you say "NO"!<br> <br>
If you aren't ready, it is detrimental to go and show your product.<br>
