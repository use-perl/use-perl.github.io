<p>I happen to know people working at Oni, Clix and Sapo. I also happen to know a bunch of people who know even more people working at these three companies.<br/><br/>Everytime I speak with someone Clix-related, they tell me "but now they're faster and they can give internet connection in no time."<br/><br/>That's a lie.<br/><br/>I still don't know one single person who managed to get the service from Clix, and yet every month there's someone claiming that now they're faster.<br/><br/>Both Clix and Oni-related people claim the problem is from PT.<br/><br/>Sapo-related people claim the problem with the two first companies are from internal chaos within those companies and claim their service is reliable.<br/><br/>When I complain that the Sapo service is expensive, Sapo-related people claim there's legal stuff preventing them from lowering the price.<br/><br/>When I complain that the very least they could do would be to increase my service, they claim that that's usually not possible because of physical constrains of the lines...<br/><br/>But somebody close to me actually canceled the service from Sapo... they called him back, lowered his price to meet the ones from Clix/Oni and raised his bandwidth...<br/><br/>Why can't I have the same thing?<br/><br/>Somebody who knows Clix people tells me now they're faster. I say they're not and the person keeps claiming "but my friend works there; he's telling me it's faster! If he says so, it's true!" And then goes out at me as I'm calling his friend a liar...<br/><br/>Well I am!<br/><br/>Half the people who tell me such things are liars.<br/><br/>The other half are misinformed.<br/><br/>I'm no longer complaining that company X or Y sucks, I am now complaining that the whole market, the three companies included, SUCK.<br/><br/>BIG TIME.</p>
