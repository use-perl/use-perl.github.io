<p><b>Conferences for Beginners</b>, by Jim Brandt, David Adler, Randal Schwartz, Michael Schwern<br/><br/>This talk was to explain what people should do to take the most out of a conference, and it focused a few interesting points:<br/><br/> * Decide what you want to see beforehand
 * Note down 5 points about each talk you see
 * Report back to your boss (so that he'll send you again next year)
 * Beware regarding security issues ("Don't use POP3 over the wireless!")
 * Finding and using the networks (in this case, IRC, blog aggregator, SubEthaEdit and the Wiki)
 * Meeting the Big Egos (how to go about approaching them)
 * Some cautionary points
 * And the post-conference activity (basically, keep in touch)<br/><br/><b>Opening Ceremonies</b>, by Josh McAdams<br/><br/>Josh came on stage and he told us a bit more about the conference:<br/><br/> * There will be a DVD
 * Over 60 talks
 * Around 400 attendees, representing 13 countries
 * 8 months planning
 * Dozens of volunteers
 * There's a job fair (with Acxiom, CheetahMail, Google, LiveText, Performics, ValueClick, Shopzilla, Follet Library Resources and a bunch of other companies; somebody already tried hiring me!)<br/><br/>Pretty good organization, I must say :-)<br/><br/><b>Keynote</b>, by Damian Conway<br/><br/>Damian got on stage with two purposes:<br/><br/> 1 - Thank ValueClick, which is sponsoring Damian into going to 4 different locations as a speaker, this Summer, Chicago being one of them;<br/><br/> 2 - Introduce Larry (Brilliant, Devout, Dedicated, Insightful, Witty, Inspiring and a lot of other adjectives I wasn't fast enough to write down).<br/><br/><b>Keynote</b>, by Larry Wall<br/><br/>Larry has just become a grandparent and he has a thing for wires.<br/><br/>His talk was on Blindness and, appropriately, was based solely on pictures... O:-)<br/><br/>Larry spoke about the several forms of blindness and presented us with some sentences that I think we should all think about:<br/><br/> - "There are several forms of blindness. Look again. Think again."<br/><br/> - "Another reason we're often blind is because we're going in circles."<br/><br/> - "Something's you don't see unless you have courage."<br/><br/> - "Something's you can't see unless the timing's right."<br/><br/> - "Sometimes we don't see things until after we've taken the picture."<br/><br/><b>So...</b><br/><br/>This was the morning.<br/><br/>But there was another talk...<br/><br/>After Larry spoke there's was a small break, but betweeen going to the bathroom, grabbing something to eat and talk to several people I ended up not being able to see Bill Odom's keynote :-(<br/><br/>I did manage to say hi to him the day before :-)</p>

Can you elaborate on that? Is it going to be a DVD on the whole conference?

I can't elaborate much ATM, but I've seen a sample of the recordings and I must say: <b>it's looking awesome!</b><br><br>Stay tuned<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)
