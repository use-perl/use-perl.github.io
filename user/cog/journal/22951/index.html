<p>Even though the process is now concluded (at least I hope so), I'd like to tell you about one of the adventures we had:

<p>The lady wouldn't tell us the name of the street, just an approximate location; we were supposed to follow her directions and call her when nearby; we thought there was something odd about it... when we got there, <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/include">include</a> said something like "There's no f*ck*ng way I'm getting out of the car in this area..."

<p>But if you think this is weird, you should hear this one:

<p>It happened to <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/include">include</a>, about five years ago. He asked whether the area was calm, and the lady replied:

<p>- Oh, it's a very peaceful neighbourhood. There's only one robber, he lives down there and I know him, so you shouldn't have any trouble... and this is your room...

<p>OH, THE SMELL!!! THE HORROR!!!!</p>
