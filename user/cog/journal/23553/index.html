<div class="span8">
<p>Greetings :-)

<p>The organizers of YAPC::EU::2005 would like you all to know how things
are going.

<p>This is report #6 and here are some details:

<p><b>Pictures of the venue</b>: We recently had another conference in one of the rooms where we'll host YAPC::EU::2005. There are some pictures from that conference <a href="http://natura.di.uminho.pt/join2005/dia1">here</a> and <a href="http://natura.di.uminho.pt/join2005/outras/">here</a>.

<p>The reason I'm mentioning this is because you might want to have a look at the room :-) Oh, and you might recognize Michael Schwern as the first speaker :-)

<p><b>When to get there and when to leave</b>: People were asking when they should arrive/leave in order not to miss anything. We have answered that in our <a href="http://braga.yapceurope.org/index.cgi?FAQ">FAQ</a>. Basically, we advise people to arrive at least on August 30th and to leave no sooner than September 3rd. But that's just to make sure you're not going to miss anything.

<p><b>Getting from the OPO airport to Braga made easier</b>: Getting from the OPO airport to the city of Braga will hopefully be made easier with <a href="http://braga.yapceurope.org/index.cgi?PortoAirport2Braga">this</a>. What you see there is not a final version and comments are welcome. More pictures will be added as possible.

<p><b>Reports on the website</b>: As you can see, the <a href="http://braga.yapceurope.org/index.cgi?SiteMap">Site Map</a> now includes the reports we've been sending to this mailing list.

<p><b>The Fishnets incident</b>: So that everybody could understand what's up with this fishnets thing, we posted the fishnets incident on the wiki. It's <a href="http://braga.yapceurope.org/index.cgi?TheFishnetsIncident">here</a>.

<p><b>Behind the scenes action</b>:

<ul>
<li>We already have two of the three main sponsors settled, and we're waiting for the third one to confirm they're sponsoring to let you know who they are;</li>
<li>I caught a pharyngitis.</li>
</ul>

<p>And that's it for now.

<p>If there's anything else you need, the organizers can be reached at
yapc@perl-hackers.net

<p>Kind regards,

<p>Jose and Alberto</p>

<p>... <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/BooK/journal/20963" title="perl.org">it's all my fault</a perl.org>.</p>
<p>My opinion it that the next group of organisers must perpetuate the fine tradition* of auctionning something of the next conference (orga T-shirts are just an easy target) at the end of each YAPC::Europe. <i>What could wrong, eh?</i> </p>
<p> <small>* Well, sure, it's a tradition... it already happened twice!</small> </p>
