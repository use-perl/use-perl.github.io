<div class="span8">
<p>So we went to see <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0320661">Kingdom of Heaven</a>.

<p>Here's what I recall from the movie:

<ul>
<li>At least two groups (probably three) of over ten people each having very animated discussions inside the theater;</li>
<li>Lots of people eating popcorn with their mouths open (and apparently doing an effort of making that clear to everyone);</li>
<li>Celular phones ringing;</li>
<li>Etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>Did I mention one of those groups had people standing?

<p>It did.

<p>The movie?

<p>Well, the movie appeared to be fabulous. Amazing.

<p>And that's why we left.

<p>We might go to the cinema again today and demand our money back.

<p>I will definitely see that movie, eventually. I was really enjoying it (we left about after half an hour).

<p>Why didn't we do anything about it? Well... it's not very dificult to convince *one* guy to shut up...

<p>But the whole theatre? I'm not that good.

<p>BTW, I applied <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/Alias">Alias</a>' <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/Alias/journal/23820">technique</a>  regarding movie trailers, this time.

<p>I went to see the movie with no previous knowledge about it, and I really do believe that's part of why I was enjoying it so much.

<p>It did feel weird to have my hands in my ears and trying to make some noise while they were showing the trailer for SWIII, though...</p>

As the theatre owner, I'd be a little wary of such a claim.  Had it been made in real time, I'd be happy to refund your tickets, but the day after seems... odd.

<i>seems... odd</i>

<p>But there's a reason, which is the fact that I was so upset with the situation that I could barely speak properly (I complained to one of the guys working there, but didn't say much and left; he didn't say a word and proceeded to the room I had abandoned).

</p> <p>I only complained once in a theatre, and I did it the following day (btw, that was the only time I ever complained of anything).

</p> <p>The guy I complained about?

</p> <p>He was fired.

</p> <p>Anyway, I assume there had been more complaints regarding that guy, because he was really rude when attending people (he made me look like a liar in front of a bunch of people). And, frankly, I think they do better without that guy, as at least four of us started going to a different theatre because of him. They probably lost some other customers too, because of him.

</p> <p>If I do decide to complain, I will. If they don't do anything about it (such as giving me my money back), I might request the "complaints book" (available in every commercial establishment in Portugal). If they refuse to give it to me, I am entitled to the right of calling the police, demanding the book and issue an additional complaint regarding the fact that they did not provide me the book as I requested.

</p> <p>I don't know how these things work in the states, but usually theatre managers in Portugal are quite fond of solving matters the easiest way, especially because a certain number of complaints (not a big one, I think) can make the establishment close. Permanently.</p>

<p>And if this one isn't, I'll simply never go there again and I'll do my best to keep people I know from going.</p>

I tried to reply to the root node<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... but failed to find the link. I guess this will do<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... anyhoo
</p>
Next time that happens, just politely query everyone in the audience: "Hey? Does anyone know how to unjam a jammed gun?" I think it's still legal to fire off some warning shots in Texas, but that's Texas.
