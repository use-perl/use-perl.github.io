<p>I had to interview 24 guys today, to pick 2 out of them... 11 hours in a row, with just 20 minutes to eat... my head now feels like a bowl of water...

That's really not a good way to interview people - it doesn't give you enough time to really get a good idea about the people you're interviewing, and, as you say, it turns your brain to mush.  With a mushy brain you can't make good decisions.<br/><br/>When I'm interviewing people, I don't like to schedule more than three or four in a day.

I couldn't agree more!!! But my boss doesn't see it that way...<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-(<br> <br>Anyway, the idea was not to pick 2 guys just out of those 20-30 minutes with each one of them... instead, we want to select those we're going to interview more carefully... This isn't as difficult as it may look... most of those guys really weren't up to it... I'm thinking about interviewing 4 of them one of these days and maybe other 4 in the next day...<br> <br>My brain really turned to mush, believe me...<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-) I still haven't recovered completely<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br> <br>But I must say this: when it comes to human resources, things are really complex... I'm sure I won't be able to pick the best 2 out of them... not with the time I have...<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-| but I hope I can pick 2 in the top 5, maybe... or at least 2 that are up to the task.
