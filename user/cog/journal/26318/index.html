<p>Yo, pretty ladies around the world
Gotta a weird thing to show you
So tell all the boys and girls
Tell your brother, your sister and your momma too
We're about to go down
And you know just what to do
<b>Wave your hands</b> in the air like you <b>don't care</b>
<b>Glide by the people as they start to look and stare</b>
Do your dance, <b>Do your dance</b>
Do your dance quick, mom<br/><br/>[Chorus:]
<b>Now c'mon baby tell me what's the word</b>
Now, word up
(ahh ahh)
<b>Everybody say</b>
When you hear the call you got to get it under way
Word up
(ahh ahh)
It's the call, word
No matter where you say it
You know that you'll be heard<br/><br/>Now while you sucker DJs
Who think you're fly
<b>There's got to be a reason
And we know the reason why</b>
You try to put on those airs
And act real cool
But you got to realize
That you're acting like fools
<b>If there's music, we can use it
Be free to dance</b>
We don't have the time for psychological romance
No romance, no romance
<b>No romance for me</b>, mom<br/><br/>[Chorus:]
C'mon baby tell me what's the word
Now, word up
(ahh ahh)
Everybody say
When you hear the call you got to get it under way
Word up
(ahh ahh)
It's the call, word
<b>No matter where you say it
You know that you'll be heard</b>
(woo!)<br/><br/>[Bridge:]
Word up
<b>(ahh ahh)</b>
Everybody say
When you hear the call you got to get it under way
Word up
<b>(ahh ahh)</b>
It's the call, word
No matter where you say it
You know that you'll be heard<br/><br/>Word up
<b>(ahh ahh)</b>
Everybody say
When you hear the call you got to get it under way
Word up
<b>(ahh ahh)</b>
It's the call, word
No matter where you say it
You know that you'll be heard</p>

I think you mean <a href="http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll" title="allmusic.com">Cameo</a allmusic.com>, maybe even <a href="http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:1v811v71zzba" title="allmusic.com">Gun</a allmusic.com>, but please not Korn! Anything but Korn!
<p>
Larry Blackmon must be cringing<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.. at least until he gets the royality cheque<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

I trust the first link you gave was not meant to return me a "Error 5 No Program Name Found"<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br><br>What's so wrong about KoRn?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br><br>Incidentally, I think I'm being hipnotized by this song...

<p>I did a cut-n-paste, but didn't realise the URL didn't contain the full path to Cameo. Try <a href="http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;searchlink=CAMEO&amp;uid=MIW060508170919&amp;sql=11:36xsa9tgb230~T0" title="allmusic.com">this one</a allmusic.com>
</p><p>I borrowed the first few albums and really tried to like them, but just found them annoying and uninspiring.

<p>Listen to the original or Gun's cover, they are much better.</p>

Somehow... I feel more inclined to hear <a href="http://image.allmusic.com/00/amg/cov200/drg400/g490/g49033a339a.jpg" title="allmusic.com">this</a allmusic.com> than <a href="http://image.allmusic.com/00/amg/cov200/drd600/d612/d612918s428.jpg" title="allmusic.com">this</a allmusic.com> O:-)<br><br>Still, I'll give it a try when I can<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-) (that is, when I find it)

The original "Word Up" by Cameo actually was quite a huge club hit, at the time (mid 80's, I think). I found it pretty decent, too. "Single Life" and "She's Strange" are some more of their better tracks.<br><br>And even though I have Korn's "Best Of" album, I've not yet found the courage to listen to their cover version. I've heard part of their cover of Pink Floyd's track, once.  Ugh.<br><br>I prefer Korn to be Korn. "A.D.I.D.A.S.", "Freak On A Leash", "Falling Away From Me", all great. But not this. Please.
