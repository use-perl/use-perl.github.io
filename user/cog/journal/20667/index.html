<div class="span8">
<p>This definitely seems to be the year of all bugs...<br/><br/>After my little adventure with the inchworm (which I presume is now living an happy and peaceful life in the garden outside), yesterday I found yet another weird bug in my room (I still have it and am trying to find a camera).<br/><br/>I'll try to describe it... imagine something 1 millimeter wide and 5 millimeters long, rectangular, grey, resembling part of a carpet (that plastic material in the bottom of some carpets), covered in dust (which I assume is part of its camuflage).<br/><br/>How it moves: actually, what I described isn't the *real* bug... this is kind of a carapace... the real worm is inside, and only about 2 millimeters of it come out at a time, hold on to something and pull the rest of it (nice way of moving, uh?) When it senses someone (don't ask me how, I don't think it has eyes) it quickly disappears (inside the carapace).<br/><br/>The worm inside is white and has a tiny black head (if not black, at least dark).<br/><br/>I get more and more bedazzled by nature each day that goes by :-)<br/><br/>You wouldn't know what kind of bug this is, would you?

<h2>Pics and movie</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/cog/">cog</a> on 2004-09-01T16:27:40</h3>
You can see some pictures and a movie of my latest bug <a href="http://natura.di.uminho.pt/user/jac/pics/others/unrated_yet/" title="uminho.pt">here</a uminho.pt> (the pictures aren't quite as good as viewing it by yourselves, but it's the best I could arrange for...)

<p>The <a href="http://natura.di.uminho.pt/user/jac/pics/others/unrated_yet/mov02560.mpg" title="uminho.pt">movie</a uminho.pt> is 18M long, but you can see the way it moves... In the background, you can hear some of us talking (in Portuguese) about the possibility of it having eyes and the possible creation of a bugzoo, since I'm finding new bugs every month<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

</p><p>Can anyone identify this bug?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-|

</p><p>I wonder... should I release it in a garden or inside a house? (it does look like dust...)</p>
