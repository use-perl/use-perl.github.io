<p>Last week the guys from Sapo told us we'd receive a message when everything was working.<br/><br/>Today we received the message.<br/><br/>We got home, tried everything, but nothing worked.<br/><br/>We called Sapo and it was settled that they'd solve the problem on their own.<br/><br/>Nothing new so far, right?<br/><br/><b>Prepare</b>.<br/><br/>We tried phoning from the telephone to one of our celulars...<br/><br/>Turns out, the number we now have is the number Oni gave us (on paper) a while ago.<br/><br/>That's not all...<br/><br/>Oni's password and username now work.<br/><br/>To be honest... I don't think I ever saw such disorganized companies in my entire life...<br/><br/>The last time we talked to Oni we were told PT hadn't transfered the line and that was the reason why our new number wasn't working, but that they'd ask for the transfer again that day. We said no, thank you, and cancelled everything.<br/><br/>That day I thought they were probably lying.<br/><br/>I guess they were.<br/><br/>First, we wouldn't have been given a new number if PT hadn't made the transfer; secondly, if PT hadn't made the transfer and they didn't ask for it again, why was it made now?<br/><br/>This really sucks...<br/><br/>So now we have internet...<br/><br/>I don't know for how long...<br/><br/>I don't know what's going to happen...<br/><br/>I don't know what we're going to do...<br/><br/>This is so sad that I can't help myself laughing...</p>
