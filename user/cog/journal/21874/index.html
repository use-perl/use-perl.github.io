<p>People tend to think that because you work with computers you must know everything there is to know about them! Whenever the slightest problem arises, you're the one they call. They get angry at you when you don't have the time (oh, yes, programmers have all the time in the world) or when you don't know what to do (because you *are* a programmer, so you should know).<br/><br/>Viruses, software that doesn't install successfully, games that don't work properly, or even certain levels of a game that one has difficulty passing!!!  And that's not mentioning people wanting to alter things in programs they bought!!<br/><br/>I don't know about you, but I've my share of these situations...<br/><br/>In the last couple of years, I started saying things like "Yes, but I don't use Windows, I have no idea what might be causing that" (truly!), or "I'm a programmer, that's what I do. I code. Show me code and I will fix it!", but that seems to no avail...<br/><br/>Here's a couple of the latest ones:<br/><br/>Trouble number 1:<br/><br/>Somebody from my family called me this weekend. His boss bought a new computer and is using it to listen to music. His problem arises when the screensaver starts... Apparently, there's some strange effect on the screen... but he doesn't know how to explain it... Eventually, we got to a point in the conversation where he was asking me why the screensaver would start if there was someone next to it listening to the music!<br/><br/>Trouble number 2:<br/><br/>Somebody from my family (again), who happens to be a psychiatrist, sent me a message saying her computer is behaving strangely, and asking me to go see it when I pass near by... My mother (who happens to have a sense of humor and knows what I go through with that) says that if the problem is the computer behaving strangely, then she, being a psychiatrist, should be the one to solve it, and not me!<br/><br/>Man... I know it's not their fault, but... for pity's sake!!!

You just need to sabotage your reputation...<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)  Dish out the standard: "Oh, you just need to format your hard drive and do a fresh re-install.  You made a backup, right?"<br> <br>Assume the rep. of being a computer savior does more harm than good (esp. within family), imo.  That's the underachiever in me.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)
