<p>It's really weird when you see emails passing between the client and your project manager and everybody refers to you as "COG" :-)<br/><br/>But it's cool, I like it :-)</p>

I've had senior investment bankers and board directors refering to me as Barbie before now. Mind you I was only ever introduced to them as Barbie, so they never knew my real name anyway.
<p>
It was weird the first time a board director for a company I worked for referred to me as Barbie, but then it was unusual for staff to use my real name, so perhaps they thought it inappropriate, and might sound like I was going to be reprimanded. Like how your parents ONLY EVER used your full name when you were about to get a telling off<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

BTW, I think I should tell you...<br> <br>When I was waiting for you in front of the Metropolitan hotel, back in Toronto, I thought of asking for you, but then I thought "Do you have a Barbie registered here?" wouldn't sound very well and wouldn't give any results, aside from a weird look from all the staff, of course...<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)
