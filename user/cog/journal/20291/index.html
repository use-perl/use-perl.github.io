<p>A friend of mine's father has passed away recently...

<p>I had no idea about this, but my friend actually quited his job to spend his father's last days with him, so it had to be some kind of illness...

<p>It must be terrible to go through something like that; must be like a race against time every single moment, always trying to say all those things you don't want to be left unsaid...

<p>I feel sorry for my friend... :-(</p>

Well, at least he got to spend the last month of his father's life with him.  Not everyone gets that chance.<br> <br>
My wife, Anita, just spent the last month of her mother's life taking care of her, and was very glad for that opportunity.  Anita's father passed away in 1986 from a heart attack in his sleep, thus there was no chance to say goodbye.<br> <br>Anita says that she much preferred the way her mom went, rather than her father.

Come to think of it, I guess you're probably right...<br> <br>Ok, I feel better now<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-) Just a little better, but I do<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

Yeah, but how many guys quit their jobs to care for the sick or invalids? Why is it always our job to quit our careers for babies, for the sick, for whatever?

Well, considering my own job at the time wouldn't allow me any time off to see my own father when he was ill and I only arrived hours before he died, yeah, I have issues how the US corporate policies often force people to quit their jobs for such things and it's often the women who do. Of course, being a bit more than tipsy probably didnt help the clarity of my expression of that.
