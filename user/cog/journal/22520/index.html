<p>Five countries total. This brings the number of countries I've ever been to up to... five! :-)

<p>Not bad at all, considering a year ago that number was two :-) I hope I get to travel more in the future :-)</p>

<h2>If only I could remember them all...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/merlyn/">merlyn</a> on 2004-12-31T21:00:31</h3>
This year I got to use my passport a bit more than normal, since I travelled overseas for one of the <a href="http://geekcruises.com/" title="geekcruises.com">Geek Cruises</a geekcruises.com>.  (That may seem weird to someone from outside North America, but we don't need passports as long as we don't go too far away from home.)
<p>
So, counting that, it's Italy, Greece, Turkey, Croatia, and then closer to home, St Martin/Sint Maarten, British Virgin Islands, Bahamas, and Mexico.  And it would have also included Australia, except they seemed to be unable to process my felonious status this year in time for me to attend the conference, so I had to bow out.
</p><p>
As for flights, I flew just over 60K miles with Delta Airlines, and just over 35K miles with Alaska Airlines this year, making it the 10th year in a row for their frequent flyer programs (both).  I think I was on the road about 24 weeks this year.</p>
