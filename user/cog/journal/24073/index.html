<p>The "Sunscreen Graduation Speech", by Baz Luhrmann

<p>These are some of the most useful advice I ever heard.

<p>I had heard/seen them before, and today somebody mentioned this again, in a presentation, saying it's the text that has been directing his life for the past four/five years.

<p><b>Yes, it *is* that good</b>.

<p>I've just been sent a link for it, which is <a href="http://www.mp3miracle.com/BazLuhrmann/Sunscreen/">here</a>.

<p>Now... if only I could find the videoclip :-)

<p>Regards to you all! :-)

<p>Oh, and trust me on the sunscreen ;-)</p>

If I remember correctly that song was a number one hit in Germany in 1998 oder 1999 - the original lyrics were about "the class of 97" iirc.<br/><br/>
anyway - a great song because it's so trivial and still extensive.

The first time I heard it was as a videoclip (I assume Lee Perry was the one "singing" it).

<p>The guy at the presentation I saw said something about it being a text he had found about five years ago... and then he suddenly started talking about the video, which didn't make any sense for those who weren't familiar with it, because he didn't explain any of this...

</p><p>Anyway, great advice, great music. It actually helps you to relax, and the advices it contains are very very good<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-) At least I think so...</p>

It's a fantastic speech, and though Vonnegut didn't write it, it really sounds like his style. The musical crescendos add drama.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

No, I'll have to see if I can find it.

Cog, mate, you're digging up some top-notch stuff. The sunscreen's lyrics are pinned on the wall of my office for quite a few years<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)
<p>
Curious, a whole self-help book in a few dozens of words.</p>
