<p>After a bunch of time, I decided to go to Orkut again, just to see if they had solved their problem (half of the requests would end up in a server error).

<p>Well, they haven't solved anything and they managed to get me off the site with a little tiny thing that I find incredibly annoying...

<p>Since I'm Portuguese, I now get the menus in Portuguese. I never said I wanted the menus in Portuguese. I hate menus in Portuguese. I have everything in English in my PC and I don't like being thrown Portuguese stuff without requesting it (which I usually do just to see how translations were done).

<p><small>(On a sidenote, I disliked when Google started to show up in Portuguese just because I was in Portugal)</small>

<p>As a plus, they haven't translated the whole site, so you press "Ajuda" ("Help") and you get a bunch of English pages.

<p>And that's not all! They're not particularly clever, because the translations are neither in Portuguese from Portugal not in Portuguese from Brazil. They're kind of both, except they're none.

<p>Also, in languages where you have two different words for "you" depending on whether you're being formal or informal (such as "tu" and "vocÃÂª" in Portuguese or "du" and "Sie" in German), it looks really stupid to keep changing between the two forms. <b>Especially</b> in the same sentence.</p>


<hr/>



<h2>And another thing</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/cog/">cog</a> on 2005-04-30T13:08:03</h3>
"commited" doesn't mean "namorando".

<p>"namorando" means "dating" (well, literally, it would mean "has a boy/girlfriend"); so if you're married, for instance, you're "commited", but you're not "dating", OK?

</p> <p>Also, that form, "namorando", might be used in Brazil a lot, but in Portugal you'd write "a namorar", or something like that.</p>



<blockquote>

<h2>committed vs. involved</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jmm/">jmm</a> on 2005-05-02T14:55:33</h3>
The standard example (in English) of how to distinguish between "committed" and "involved".  Consider a breakfast of ham and eggs.  To prepare that breakfast, the pig was committed, while the chicken was involved.

<h2>OpenBC</h2>

I can highly recommend the Open Business Club. <a href="http://openbc.com/" title="openbc.com">http://openbc.com/</a openbc.com> Extremely fast, HTTPS and as a plus written in Perl<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
