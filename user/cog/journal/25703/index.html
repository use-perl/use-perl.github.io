<p>Greetings :-)<br/><br/>The organizers of YAPC::EU::2005 would like you all to know how things are going.<br/><br/>This is report #13 and here are some details:<br/><br/><b>150 atendees barrier broken</b><br/><br/>And on we go. Next barrier is at 200, let's see if we make it.<br/><br/>Do remember, this is the amount of people registered. Some of them may not come, and surely others not registered will show up.<br/><br/><b>Call for Atendees</b><br/><br/>Some of you might have seen the Call for Atendees flying by.<br/><br/>It is also available <a href="http://braga.yapceurope.org/index.cgi?CallForAtendees">here</a>.<br/><br/><b>You should have booked your hotel by now.</b><br/><br/>The first of the three recomended hotels for the conference is all booked. There are no more rooms available in that hotel for the duration of the conference (this may change, of course, if someone unbooks).<br/><br/>This leaves you with two recomended hotels with rooms available. Book now. Check <a href="http://braga.yapceurope.org/index.cgi?BragaHotels">BragaHotels</a> for more details but also read the next point.<br/><br/><b>Staying at the students' residence</b><br/><br/>Finally (we were almost giving hope on this one), we have some information regarding the students' residence.<br/><br/>Basically, we have about 30 double rooms for the conference. Each room includes bathroom, phone, TV, a small refrigerator and an electric disk.<br/><br/>In each floor you'll find a laundry room (self-service) and, on the last floor, a kitchen, a study room, a living room, a gaming room and an informatics room [not sure what they mean by that, though].<br/><br/>The price per night is of 15.50 euros/person if two people are staying in a double room, or 18.50 euros if one person is staying in a double room. These prices do not include breakfast.<br/><br/>If you are interested, please send an email to yapc@perl-hackers.net with your name and staying dates. If you will stay with someone else, state so, and give us his/her name as well.<br/><br/>See also <a href="http://braga.yapceurope.org/index.cgi?UniversitaryResidence">UniversitaryResidence</a>.<br/><br/><b>BOFs, at last!</b><br/><br/>There is now <a href="http://braga.yapceurope.org/index.cgi?BOFs">a page for proposing BOFs</a> (that page needs an explanation of what a BOF is, btw... anyone up for it?)<br/><br/>At the moment, there are two proposed BOFs:<br/><br/>    * <a href="http://braga.yapceurope.org/index.cgi?PerlMongerBOF">PerlMongerBOF</a>
    * <a href="http://braga.yapceurope.org/index.cgi?RSIBOF">RSIBOF</a><br/><br/>The first one is advisable if you run (or want to run) a Perl Monger group and want to get/give advice on it. The second is advisable for people who suffer from RSI (Repetitive Strain Injury); basically, if your hands hurt when you type.<br/><br/>Do realize that you do not need anything to attend a BOF, you just simply show up. You do not need a Perl Monger Group to go to the first BOF, and you do need a medical condition to go to the second one. It's just people getting together and discussing a subject, that's all. Everybody's free (and welcome) to show up and join the discussion.<br/><br/>BOFs usually take place after the last talk of the day.<br/><br/>If you feel like going to one of these BOFs, go to the BOFs page, follow the link to its page and add your name there (BOFs, as you can imagine, do not take place if there's only one guy interested...)<br/><br/>If you want to propose a BOF, do it.<br/><br/><b>Changes to the <a href="http://conferences.yapceurope.org/2005/schedule">schedule</a></b><br/><br/>It so happens, at times, that for personal/professional/health reasons a speaker has to cancel his talk(s). Whenever that happens, we just get the person on the top of our backup list, change the schedule, and move on. We do not, usually, take the time to tell people about the changes, because it's usually a 20 minute thing.<br/><br/>This time, since we're having a three hour change on our schedule, we're telling you about it.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Tim Maher won't be able to come. We're all very sorry for this, including Tim.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, here's our substitute speaker: <a href="http://simon-cozens.org/">Simon Cozens</a>.<br/><br/>Simon will be presenting a three hour tutorial on Maypole. The schedule has been changed, and <a href="http://conferences.yapceurope.org/2005/talk/206">an abstract is available</a>.<br/><br/>Check also <a href="http://conferences.yapceurope.org/2005/user/439">Simon's bio</a> :-)<br/><br/><b>Behind the scenes action:</b><br/><br/><ul>
<li>Volunteers are being drafted and tasks are being assigned. More on this in a future report;</li>
<li>The Proceedings are being printed. Our thanks to our speakers, many of which took the time to write something about their talks;</li>
<li>Lots of logistic problems being solved;</li>
<li>The <a href="http://conferences.yapceurope.org/2005/stats">silent battle</a> between Portugal and UK goes on, as Portugal reaches 57 atendees and UK is left behind with 43... Following are Netherlands, United States and Germany, with 9 each. Mind you, these are not the numbers of confirmed atendees, just of registered ones.</li>
</ul><br/><br/>And that's it for now.<br/><br/>As always, the organizers can be reached at yapc@perl-hackers.net<br/><br/>Kind regards, </p>
