<i>Because the point was that both those groups appear to have <b>0</b> members</i><nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

<p>And our rather noisy <a href="http://www.pm.org/census/2005/12.html" title="pm.org">Boston</a pm.org> mailing list is shown as having 300 members and <b>0</b> posts per day. (And doesn't mention  sometimes-social meetings.)

</p><p>No poll / census is a perfect reflection of reallity -- the Map is not the territory.

</p><p>But yes, it <b>is funny</b> that the last two YAPC::EU's have been run by groups with (reportedly) no members.

</p><p> <b>(-:</b> Is this a sign that Barbie+Birmingham.PM should make some (read all) members redundant quickly, if she intends to succeed, or is this a measure of the price of success, that running YAPC results in total burnout?<nobr> <wbr></nobr><b>:-)</b></p>

Sorry, yes, to be gramatically correct I should have put brackets around the (+Birmingham.PM) so as a parenthetical it didn't count for agreement in number and gender.<br><br>Happy Holidays

But to be gender correct when referring to (this particular) Barbie, you would use <b>he</b> in place of <b>she</b>.

Ah. I see.<br><br>Well actually it says that those groups have mailing lists with no members. Which isn't quite the same as saying that the groups have no members. But obviously a mailing list with no members seems a little pointless and you'd generally expect most of the group members to be on the mailing list.<br><br>I deliberately didn't ask the group leaders how many actual members they had. Largely because from experiences with london.pm I know what a tricky concept membership can be<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br>
