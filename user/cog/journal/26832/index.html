<p>I usually don't watch TV, but <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/include">include</a> does, so I ocasionally get a glimpse of what he's watching.<br/><br/>Yesterday, a documentary on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_Bear">Polar Bears</a> was showing. I couldn't help myself from watching it :-)<br/><br/>I once saw a documentary on the very same animal and there's a part of it that echoed forever in my mind: "Man only has one natural predator, and that's the polar bear. A polar bear actually hunts man down in order to kill him."<br/><br/>A while further in yesterday's documentary and the narrator explains that the polar bear doesn't attack human beings (kind of like what they say about sharks). Wikipedia, BTW, apparently says nothing about this.<br/><br/>Conclusion: one of the two documentaries lied to me. See why I don't like TV?<br/><br/>This also reminds me of the time I used to collect small curiosities and use them as random signatures. One I had said that "ants never sleep." I gave up collecting curiosities when I found one that said "when ants wake up, they always turn to their left side" (and don't come throwing logic at me saying that if the first statement is true the second one is not false because that won't make me happier). Again, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant">Wikipedia says nothing</a> about this (I assume ants sleep and get to choose which way to turn when they get up).<br/><br/>But I digress.<br/><br/>Polar Bears.<br/><br/>Also on yesterday's documentary: "In fact, polar bears are less dangerous than dogs. Only 19 deaths because of polar bears were reported in the last 100 hundred years, while 300 people [I might have the number wrong] died because of dogs last year alone in the U.S.A. [give or change a word]."<br/><br/>No, no, no, no, no.<br/><br/>That's not the way to do that kind of comparison!<br/><br/>Of course there are less deaths because of polar bears than because of dogs! There's surely less deaths caused by lions than deaths caused by guns, but that's just because people aren't walking past lions every now and then. There's also less deaths being caused by big trees with coconuts falling down on people's heads than electrocution, but that's just because people are sticking their fingers in power outlets instead of staring at trees while somebody else is chopping them down!<br/><br/>If you want to see whether dogs or polar bears are the most dangerous animal, try adding the same number of polar bears as there are dogs to our cities, and we'll see what happens!<br/><br/>If you ask me, there wouldn't be many humans left behind to tell the story...<br/><br/>Nor dogs!</p>
