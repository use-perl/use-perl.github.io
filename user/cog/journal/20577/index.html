<p>I have done a once through of <i>"Perl Medic"</i> by Peter J. Scott and I must say it is a fantastic Perl resource.</p>

<p>I am reading it again though more slowly this time. I heartily agree with the cover blurb: <i>If you code in Perl, you need to read this book</i>.</p>

<p>I am almost a level 5 Perl programmer to the list given.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>

I've been hearing lots of good things on "Perl Medic"<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-) I guess it must be good<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-) It will probably be on my list<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

<h2>My Opinion</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/phillup/">phillup</a> on 2004-08-26T16:10:43</h3>
I've got a lot of the Perl books on your list, but I don't know where you are in needed / desired skills. I do mostly CGI programming with Mason... so, take this with that in mind.<br> <br>If I was limited to one Perl book from the list, it would be <i>Perl Cookbook</i>. It is a great book to have around when you have a common problem and you want ideas for a starting point. Without knowing more about your specific needs or desires, I'd say that is one of the best generalized books on the list. I also found it useful when I knew ways to solve the problem in another language and wanted to know the "Perl way". (I've been accused of using Perl to write C++ code.;-))<br> <br>I'd also say that while <i>Programming the Perl DBI: Database Programming with Perl</i> is a great book, it is dated in the extreme. If your database needs fall in the MySql category, then <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0735712123/ref=sib_rdr_dp/102-0127937-6087319?_encoding=UTF8&amp;no=283155&amp;me=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;st=books" title="amazon.com">this book</a amazon.com> has a pretty good section on using DBI.<br> <br> <i>Perl and LWP</i> is another book worth having if you <b>absolutely</b> must use that technology. But, WWW::Mechanize has made that much less necessary.<br> <br>If either of the above two books were updated, I would go out and buy them immediately. But, I would put the current versions near the end of the list.<br> <br>My most recent purchase has been <i>Perl Medic</i> and I really like the book. It has the best section on testing I've seen so far. I'm not sure if that says something good about the book, or something poor about how little information is in print on the subject... one thing that does bug me about this book is the way they typset the book. New lines of code are presented in italics (ever seen an italicized pipe... looks a lot like a slash) and it does not stand out well.<br> <br>OTOH, <i>Object Oriented Perl</i> is a most excellent read. Not just for the subject matter, but because it is just plain easy to pick out changed lines of code due to the way they typeset it. Highly recommended if you are looking for another book on OO programming with Perl.<br> <br>HTH<br>

<i>I don't know where you are in needed / desired skills</i>

<p>Mostly, I do Perl for fun and easiness of those terrible tasks, but I don't really have any specific needs... I've always been interested in expanding my skills and knowledge, but in no specific areas...

</p><p>I'm going to follow your advice and leave those other two books for later<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-) I will probably buy the Cookbook, this time<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

</p><p>If after making up my first list I still find space for another book, it will probably be "Object Oriented Perl". That's an interesting subject<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

<h2>One each</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Mr. Muskrat/">Mr. Muskrat</a> on 2004-08-26T19:05:31</h3>
<p>I recommend that you get (at least) one of each.<br>
Fiction:  <i>Rendezvous with Rama</i> or anything by Arthur C. Clarke.<br>
Perl: <i>Perl Cookbook</i> is the only book left on your list that I have read.  (I actually have most of those on my list as well.)</p>

<h2>Re:One each</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/cog/">cog</a> on 2004-08-27T08:55:10</h3>
OK, I'm getting the point with "Perl Cookbook"<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

<p>As for Arthur, I already have a couple of his books (2001, Expedition to Earth), but I have been hearing so many good thing on this one, and I can't find it in Portugal, so... I guess I'll have to send it in!<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

</p><p>Tell me, is that book a complete story, or is it just part of a greater one? (I've seen quite a few books with the name "Rama" on them...)</p>



<blockquote>

<h2>Rama</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Mr. Muskrat/">Mr. Muskrat</a> on 2004-08-27T12:44:21</h3>
It's definitely a complete story.  The other books in the series are supposed to pick up where this one leaves off but I never made it past Rama II.  (I didn't like the collabrative work.)



<blockquote>

<h2>Re:Rama</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jdavidboyd/">jdavidboyd</a> on 2004-08-27T13:58:43</h3>
I would say don't ever bother.  They go downhill, and I thought the ending was trite trash...

<p><blockquote><div> <em>Rendezvous with Rama</em> or anything by Arthur C. Clarke</div></blockquote>
If I had to pick one Clarke book to recommend, it would have to be <a href="http://isbn.nu/0345347951" title="isbn.nu">Childhood's End</a isbn.nu>.  The original "Rama" is indeed good, but it suffers from a very weak ending, IMHO.  Of all his books, "Childhood's End" is my all-time favorite.
