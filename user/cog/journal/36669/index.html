<p>It's like a preview of the apocalypse, and all it took was a strike.<br/><br/>The fuel transportation companies are on strike.<br/><br/>You should see the gas stations yesterday. The gas stations, and the havoc.<br/><br/>Most of them were closed, but the few ones that still had some fuel were packed with cars and people shouting at one another.<br/><br/>They all knew there wasn't much fuel left, so every car counted. The cars, and the people carrying cans and bottles.<br/><br/>Late in the evening, one could see parked cars along the freeways. Empty tanks.<br/><br/>This morning, the amount of cars on the road made the traffic lights seem pointless.<br/><br/>And all it took... was a strike.<br/><br/>The government started by saying there was no way they'd give in to the demands.<br/><br/>Maybe they don't really know how fragile a country can be, if you strike in the right place.<br/><br/>Around 5am, the strike was lifted.<br/><br/>The highway tolls will now be cheaper during night time, and other reividications were also met.<br/><br/>The gas stations are now being refueled, and the country should resume its normal laid-back lifestyle pretty soon.<br/><br/>It was... interesting to see.</p>
