<p>I'm thinking of going to the London Perl Workshop.

<p>I am also thinking about submitting one or maybe two talk proposals...

<p>My options would be (in my order of preference):

<ul>
<dd><b>Perl Black Magic Enhanced</b>: Obfuscation and Golfing; a second version of the Perl Black Magic talk I gave in Belfast, considering all the comments and suggestions people gave me</dd>
<dd><b>Perl Blue Magic</b>: using the CPAN</dd>
<dd><b>Perl Red Magic</b>: Object Oriented Perl</dd>
</ul>

<p>Since the workshop is only one day long, I know for sure I {shouldn't/don't want to/they wouldn't let me anyway} talk three times, and I don't even think I should talk twice (unless maybe I'd do it once on each track).

<p>But anyway, it's not up to me to decide whether I can or can not talk; that's up to the organizers. What I have to decide is whether I'm submitting something and, if so, what.

<p>If there's anyone going there who would be interested in listening to one of these talks, please say so :-|
</p>

<h2>Why red?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/schwern/">schwern</a> on 2004-10-13T17:55:28</h3>
<p>Black magic I understand.  But why is CPAN blue?  And OO red?

</p><p>Blue I can make sense of via Final Fantasy (and what can't be made sense of via Final Fantasy?).  Blue mages absorb power and spells from other mages.  So that makes perfect sense for CPAN.

</p><p>Red mages... <a href="http://www.nuklearpower.com/daily.php?date=010526" title="nuklearpower.com">The Red Mage</a nuklearpower.com> from FFI is a jack of all trades.  Fighter, White Mage and Black Mage.  Nope, not working for OO.</p>

CPAN is blue, mostly, because of the color of <a href="http://search.cpan.org/" title="cpan.org">this</a cpan.org> site. But I have other reasons, which I intend to present the day I finally give that talk<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

<p>As for OO being red... it's not like I have a good enough reason for this... but I needed a color anyway, and White, Black and Blue (and one or two more) were already taken... I like to associate OO with red, but I can't think of a decent reason why...</p>

See <a href="/comments.pl?sid=22560&amp;cid=34432" title="perl.org">my note</a perl.org> and what I'd like to see covered...

So... this means there's now a point to OOP and another to a lightning talk on colors O:-)
