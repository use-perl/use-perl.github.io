<p>So <a href="http://www.yapceurope2009.org/">next year's YAPC::EU will be held in Lisbon, Portugal</a>, and will be organized, once again, by Alberto and myself.<br/><br/>We have a lot of ideas and we're eager to get all of them accomplished.<br/><br/>Finally having a partner program is one of those ideas, as is having an arrival survival kit being sent to the attendees *before* the conference takes place (with a map, simple indications, etc).<br/><br/>A beginner's track will be part of our program, which is likely to both attract conference newcomers and delight the eyes, ears, and brains, of those who sometimes find the regular talks too technical.<br/><br/>You have one year to plan, so it's going to be harder for you to convince yourself that you're missing this wonderful conference because of somebody else.<br/><br/>We'll be with you all the way.<br/><br/>We're working to put together an amazing conference, we'll be pointing you to where to stay, where to eat, what do to, and how to get here, and we'll be preparing a partner program, so you can bring your family along with you to Lisbon, land where the good beer is really cheap and where you'll find an extraordinary cuisine waiting for you.<br/><br/>We'll be talking to you all year long to help you sort things out and to let you know how we're sorting things out too.<br/><br/>We're looking forward to the tenth YAPC::EU.<br/><br/>So should you.<br/><br/>In a future post, we'll explain what the conference theme is going to be.</p>

<p>I'm planning to map out my travels well in advance for 2009; any news when the YAPC::EU dates will be finalised?</p>

A 10 day conference! Just a single track then, I suppose?

<p>I assume that is the bracket within which they want to fall, not the final full length of the conference.</p><p>Err, I hope.</p>
