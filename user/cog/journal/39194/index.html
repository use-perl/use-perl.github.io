<strong>Current Stats</strong>

<p>We're now at 230 confirmed attendees.
<br />
Several people have registered to the different training courses (there are still some seats left) and the partner program currently has a group of 9 people (not counting the guides), and several inquiries from other interested people (yes, you can still register for the partner program).
<br />
It's going to be an amazing conference.
<br />

</p>
<strong>Further sponsors</strong>

<p>To the ranks of Booking.com, logicLAB, SAPO, Eurotux, log, Caixa MÃÂ¡gica, Best Practical, FCUL, Active State, TAP, O'Reilly, Apress, Onyx Neon Press, $foo magazine, The Perl Review and o3 magazine, the following now also get on board:

<ul><li><strong><a href="http://www.shadowcat.co.uk/">Shadowcat Systems</a></strong> - Not only is Shadowcat sponsoring YAPC::EU, they're also providing a <a href="http://yapceurope2009.org/ye2009/talk/1874">free 1 day workshop</a> in collaboration with EPO the day right after YAPC.</li></ul>

<strong>Send-a-newbie updates</strong>

<p>All the candidates were asked to answer a set of questions in order to help the jury select the lucky ones who will be attending this YAPC::EU.
<br />
The answers were given and the jury is now working their way through them. We can tell you that some of the replies were really impressive.
<br />
The selected candidates should be announced pretty soon.

<br />
Send-a-Newbie is currently at 1,745 euros. <a href="http://www.send-a-newbie.com/donate">You can still help</a>.

We're working on several things. Here are some headlines:
<br />

</p>
<ul>
<li>conference dinner - this year's conference dinner will be sponsored by Booking.com; we're taking care of the arrangements.
</li>

<li>coffee breaks - we're also working on these ones.
</li>
<li>conference proceedings - a number of speakers have written articles for the conference proceedings and we're now working on them.
</li>
<li>conference tshirts - we're working closely with a clothing company to make the conference tshirts.
</li>
<li>auction - this year we'll have two separate auctions: the silent one, with all the books, t-shirts and other cool things, and the live auction, with all the crazy stuff.
</li>
<li>several other things.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<hr />

<p>That's all for this newsletter, but you can count on further updates pretty soon.
