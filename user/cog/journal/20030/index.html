<p>I tried not to make a very long post, but this is what I got :-| If you manage
to read it all, I'll promise you a good picture O:-)

<p>My complaint about the hotel:

<p>Even though they said so in their webpage, THERE WAS NO INTERNET!!!

<p><b>Me</b>: Can we access the internet?

<p><b>Employee</b>: You'll need a computer...

<p><b>Me</b>: I have one on my back :-)

<p><b>Employee</b>: Then you can.

<p><b>Me</b>: What do I have to? Is it the plug between the beds?

<p><b>Employee</b>: No, you just unplug the telephone and connect there.

<p><b>Me</b> [not fully understanding what he had said]: Do I have to pay for
it?

<p><b>Employee</b>: Well... that depends on the server you connect to...

<p>And at this point... Of course I have Internet on the hotel
bedroom...  all I need is a modem! Duh! Following the same logic, I also have
access to cable TV, radio and air condicioned working properly... I simply have
to bring it all with me!!!!!

<p>Argh...

<p>Ok, now that I explained why I didn't blog all these days, here goes nothing
:-)

<p><b>The city:</b>

<p>Lots and lots of turists! In fact, I don't really believe there are any
other Spanish living in Barcelona apart from the ones working in the shops and
the restaurants.

<p>There's less people in the streets than in SÃÂ£o Paulo, but the floor is a
little bit dirtier...

<p>Food is much more expensive than in Portugal... as most things are. It's
hard to have a meal by less then 10 euros. Down the Rambla (see below) <a
href="http://natura.di.uminho.pt/user/jac/pics/2004-07-23%20-%20Spain/raw_IM000545.jpg.html">we
paid over 9 euros for an orange juice</a>!!! Ok, it was almost a litre of it,
but it really wasn't anything great :-)

<p><b>Language:</b>

<p>If you think these guys speak the same Spanish all over the country, you're
absolutely wrong :-)

<p>Near the northern border of Portugal, they speak Galaic, which is Spanish
with a mixture of Portuguese (actually, their writting is closer to Portuguese
than to Spanish).

<p>Near the border with France, they speak Catalan, which, IMHO, is Spanish with
a mixture of French and also a little bit of Italian :-)

<p>I already knew this, but I didn't think it would be so hard to express
myself or even understand them, from times to times. It was very rare for me to
fool anybody and be taken for a native speaker :-) (which isn't all that
dificult near the Portuguese border) They kept confusing me for English, French
or Italian :-)

<p>We went <a
href="http://natura.di.uminho.pt/user/jac/pics/2004-07-23%20-%20Spain/raw_IM000542.jpg.html">down
the Rambla</a>, one of the most famous streets of Barcelona. There were guys
playing music (and this even included a great pianist of whom I couldn't take a
picture :-( ), <a

artists</a> :-) Really impressing :-) I didn't even took pictures of half of them :-) Not even a third!! :-)

<p>Oh, if you want to take pictures to every single artist you see and don't
want to give a coin to every single one of them, please take the pictures while
they're distracted!! <a

<p><b>Other places to visit:</b>

<p>There's lots and lots to see in Barcelona. We went to the <a

<h2>Happens in the US too</h2>

<p>I have not stayed in a Motel 6 for quite a while even though the prices are reasonable and reason is a simple one: false advertising.</p>
<p>They advertised "high speed internet" in every room.  When I got into my room, I found a phone jack only so I asked.  I basically got the same response you did and promptly checked out with a full refund of my money.  I see now that they have changed the wording to call it "data ports" instead of "high speed internet".  I guess some people do learn.</p>

Yeah... it was really shameful... we chose that hotel precisely because it *had* internet access!<br> <br>Unfortunately, we only decided to check on that on our last day there<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-( (after realizing there was no access at the conference either!!!<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-| )
