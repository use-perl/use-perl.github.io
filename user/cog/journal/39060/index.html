<div class="span8">
<p><p>Greetings, and welcome to the sixth <a href="http://yapceurope2009.org/">YAPC::EU::2009</a> newsletter.</p>

<p>In this issue:</p>

<ul><li>partner program</li>
<li>numbers</li>
<li>receipts</li>
<li>making your personal schedule</li>
<li>send-a-newbie current status</li></ul>

<p>Let's get down to it:</p>

<p><strong>partner program</strong></p>

<p>We have finally settled the details for the partner program.</p>

<p>It's really wonderful and we're very excited about it.</p>

<p>	Details on the Partner Program - <a href="http://yapceurope2009.org/ye2009/wiki?node=PartnerProgram">http://yapceurope2009.org/ye2009/wiki?node=PartnerProgram</a></p>

<p>	Cost - 80 euros for adults and children 13 years old or older, 60 euros for children between 4 and 12 years old, free of charge for kids up to 3 years old.</p>

<p>We're more than happy to receive any comments and suggestions regarding the program, but please understand that we received lots of feedback from many attendees and we did our best to please everybody.</p>

<p>We're happy that we managed to cut down the cost from the original estimated value. We're also happy that the amount of activities in the program seems to be well balanced.</p>

<p>For any personal questions regarding this program (for instance, dietary needs), please do get in touch with us using the organizers address on the bottom of this email.</p>

<p>Speaking of dietary needs, the partner program currently doesn't include the cost of lunch.</p>

<p><strong>numbers</strong></p>

<p>We're currently at 184 confirmed attendees. These attendees are coming from 25 different countries.</p>

<p>There have also been several registrations for all the training courses (do remember there are limits of attendance for these ones, so please do register for those as soon as possible, to ensure you have a seat).</p>

<p><strong>receipts</strong></p>

<p>If you already payed and require a receipt, don't forget to fill in name, address and *VAT number* so we can start printing things beforehand.</p>

<p>Unless requested, receipts will be delivered at the conference.</p>

<p><strong>making your personal schedule</strong></p>

<p>ACT (Another Conference Toolkit), the framework we're using to manage several aspects and the website of the conference, has a nice number of cool features.</p>

<p>One of these features is the possibility of you marking the talks you want to attend.</p>

<p>If you look at <a href="http://yapceurope2009.org/ye2009/schedule?day=2009-08-03">the schedule</a> you'll notice a couple of things:</p>

<ul><li>if you're logged in, there's a star on the left of the talk name</li>
<li>after the name of the talk, you'll see a number</li></ul>

<p>The star is what you should press to mark the talk as one you want to attend.</p>

<p>The number is the number of people who have marked that talk.</p>

<p>So why is this useful?</p>

<p> 1 - You can get your personal schedule at <a href="http://yapceurope2009.org/ye2009/myschedule">http://yapceurope2009.org/ye2009/myschedule</a>;</p>

<p> 2 - We, the organizers, can tell which talks have the most demand; this is particularly useful so that we can, for instance, take two talks with lots of interest happening at the same time and move one of them one slot before or after in order to please more attendees.</p>

<p>About 60 people have already used this feature and started creating their own schedules. Join the fun!</p>

<p><strong>send-a-newbie current status</strong></p>

<p>The send-a-newbie project has received 1510 euros of donations so far and 32 applications have been submitted.</p>

<p>As it is, this means that ~3 people will be able to attend YAPC thanks to these grants (it can be more, if you <a href="http://www.send-a-newbie.com/donate">donate</a>).</p>

<p>The applicants should now be receiving a list of questions to answer.</p>

<p>Based on their answers and perhaps a few other aspects, a small group of people will be sorting these applications and select the lucky grantees who'll be spending three amazing days at YAPC::EU::2009.</p>

<p>While some of the details are being worked on behind closed curtains, we'd like to assure you the process couldn't be more honest and that at some point all the details will be unveiled.</p>

<p>That's all for this newsletter</p>

<p>Feel free to contact us at organizers@yapceurope2009.org for anything conference related.</p>

<p>See you at the next newsletter,</p>

<p>the organizers</p>

<p>In our next newsletter: lots of stuff!</p></p>
