<p>So how does <a href="http://www.griffintechnology.com/products/airclick/">this</a> work?<br/><br/><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/cogurov/54854069/">The set includes a remote control</a> with five buttons (play/pause, previous, next, lower volume, raise volume), <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/cogurov/54854077/">a receiver</a> you can easily connect to a USB port and a USB cord in case you need one.<br/><br/>You install the program shipped with the set (also called AirClick, apparently) and you're set.<br/><br/>What can you do with it?<br/><br/>You can send commands to certain applications.<br/><br/>Note: certain applications.<br/><br/>The version of the program I have (the one that was shipped) claims to work with DVD Player, Keynote, iTunes, PowerPoint, QuickTime Player, radioSHARK and VLC.<br/><br/>And that's it. You have to select which application you want it to work with and that's the list. There is, apparently, no way to work with something like Preview, for instance.<br/><br/>But anyway...<br/><br/>I had some wi-fi issues the first time I plugged this thing, but that's OK, it was only once.<br/><br/>You can walk around the house and use the control, which is actually great and which I find I'm doing a lot, true... but you know what? I actually use it even when I'm using the keyboard/mouse.<br/><br/>Why? Because it's easier to grab this little thing and press the button than changing desktop or trying to find another window and then find the right button. It really saves me time.<br/><br/>Plus, there's another advantage to this little gadget... you can actually control iTunes, for instance, while you're playing a full-screen game ;-) Got it? :-)<br/><br/>More: it works while the screensaver is on, which is great. Some may claim a security flaw or something, but not really; you see, the program *is* running. Why should it stop receiving commands when the screensaver starts? That would make no sense! It's a screensaver, not a hibernation of some sort!<br/><br/>All in all, I'm glad about it so far. It's saving me time and not giving me headaches.<br/><br/>Plus, I can now give presentations without having to reach my laptop to change slides.<br/><br/>That's just great.<br/><br/>Griffin claims the battery should last for the device's lifetime (but yes, there's a way to change it). Either they don't expect this thing to last long or they're not aware of how often I'm using this...<br/><br/>But not all's roses...<br/><br/>It would be great if I could control other applications, even if not on the list.<br/><br/>Pressing two (or more) button at the same time for another functionality could also be a good idea.<br/><br/>And it would also be a good thing if I could actually configure what each button does... :-)</p>
