<p>So I'm back in Portugal, and here are the top ten facts regarding my journey:<br/><br/>10 - <a href="http://www.luv.asn.au/">Speaking at the LUV meeting</a>, which was in fact my first exposure to a Linux Group (and I took a Mac with me).<br/><br/>9 - Simply <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/cogurov/319384863/">hanging around in Melbourne</a> and in Sydney.<br/><br/>8 - Going to the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/cogurov/sets/72157594415028535/">Chinese Garden of Friendship</a>, in Sydney.<br/><br/>7 - <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/cogurov/319385032/">Melbourne Aquarium</a>, where I saw tons of fishes I didn't knew existed and where I was accompanied by the expertise of Paul and Jacinta.<br/><br/>6 - <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/cogurov/316845081/">OSDC itself</a>, of course, with around 200 attendees which are not the usual guys from the other conferences I usually go to, many of whom I enjoyed delightful conversations with.<br/><br/>5 - <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/cogurov/319411165/">Haelsfield Sanctuary</a>, where I saw dozens of animals I didn't even knew existed, petted a wallabee and held a reasonably sized python with my bare hands (not at the same time, of course). Randal, do you have the photos yet? O:-)<br/><br/>4 - Going to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/cogurov/319391713/">a barbecue at Scott and Amanda's</a>... you see, their house runs on Perl, and I got to see the system! Way to go, Scott! :-)<br/><br/>3 - Finally <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/cogurov/319384632/">meeting Paul and Jacinta</a> (and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/cogurov/319385235/">their chickens</a>).<br/><br/>2 - Spending so much time with <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/cogurov/319407043/">Randal in the first week</a> and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/cogurov/316060544/">Adam in the second</a> (Randal and I were at the same hotel in Melbourne and Adam provided me shelter for the time I spent in Sydney).<br/><br/>1 - <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/cogurov/320392883/">Climbing the Sydney Bridge</a>: over three hours of walking and climbing that will remain in my mind for a very long time and that I recommend to anybody who can go there.<br/><br/>Of course, there were so many other things I enjoyed, but I just wanted to share a short list with you guys :-) I highly recommend that you go to Australia, if you have the chance :-) Also, they're pretty eager to get some more Perl programmers move there... ;-)<br/><br/>Thanks, Aussies!
