<div class="span8">
<p>Greetings :-)

<p>The organizers of YAPC::EU::2005 would like you all to know how things are going.

<p>This is report #10 and here are some details:

<p><b>We have a schedule</b>

<p>If you missed the special report regarding the schedule, know that <a href="http://conferences.yapceurope.org/2005/schedule">we now have one</a> (a schedule, not a special report).

<p><b>MongersStayingAt...</b>

<p>If you know where you're staying, go to the <a href="http://braga.yapceurope.org">wiki</a> and update the page regarding people staying at wherever you're staying.

<p>It's not just about other people knowing where you'll be, but also about us knowing how many people will be staying at each place (trust us, we need to know this).

<p>If you still don't know where you'll be staying, you should start thinking about it :-)

<p><b>T-shirt sizes</b>

<p>We're ready to order the tshirts, but here's what comes out of Act at the moment:

<p><code>$VAR1 = {
         'S' => 3,
         '' => 38,
         'M' => 20,
         'L' => 18
         'XL' => 15,
         'XXL' => 11,
       };</code>

<p>This means 38 people haven't made any choice regarding tshirt sizes.

<p>Those 38 of you, Could you please fill that information? Thank you :-)

<p><b>Bringing company to Braga?</b>

<p>If you're bringing someone with you (wives, kids, etc) to Braga but not to the YAPC, please tell us through <a href="http://conferences.yapceurope.org/2005">Act</a>, under "update your information", field "Coming with". We need to know how many non-atendees we'll have around, so we can sort some things out.

<p><b>Behind the scenes action</b>

<p><ul><li>A backup list of talks is being organized (if a speaker ends up not coming, somebody else will talk in his/her place; all these replacements should be noted in each day's announcements)</li>

<li>The Summer has apparently arrived to Portugal</li>

<li>The conference is still about three months away, but...</li>

<li>There's already over 100 people registered for the conference</li>

<li>There's already over 200 people subscribing this list</li>
</ul>

<p>And that's it for now.

<p>As always, the organizers can be reached at <code>yapc@perl-hackers.net</code>

<p>Kind regards,

<p>JosÃÂ© and Alberto</p>
