<p>I made it. I am now at the hotel.<br/><br/>The flight was OK. I slept during takeoff. Yes, during takeoff.<br/><br/>Yes, during takeoff.<br/><br/>How many times do I have to tell it so you'll believe me? I actually slept during takeoff! :-) Could be because I was so tired.<br/><br/>Anyway, this was the first flight I ever got up in. I think I'm getting used to this.<br/><br/>Getting to the hotel was a different story. After over 10 hours in the same plain, I found myself with a cab driver who insisted he didn't know the way, but he would always choose the wrong one, *regardless* of what I'd say. We passed near the hotel a couple of times, always having to drive some more because of the signs. When I changed the tone of my voice and started taking some clothe off (I was getting angry and really hot), he immediately found the right way.<br/><br/>Plus, it's raining! I didn't know the Summer in Brazil had this much rain, but apparently it does...<br/><br/>I did not came prepared for the rain... I brought clothes for the Sun, not the rain!!! Oh well, guess I'll have to wash some of it a couple of times... Unfortunately, the company doesn't pay for that sort of expenses.<br/><br/>I was so tired that I ended up dining in the hotel. Margaca (where's that cedilla?), if you're reading this, I did what you asked! I ate the biggest dessert they had!! It was great, and it had lots of pear, and cream, and chocolate, and icecream, and, and, and... and I can hardly move!!! And it's all your fault!! :-| We'll talk about this when I get to Portugal :-)<br/><br/>Meanwhile, I miss my girlfriend. Can't wait to be back, sweetheart :-)</p>
