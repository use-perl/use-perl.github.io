<p>It's been over seven months I'm in Lisbon and I still haven't got Internet access at home.<br/><br/>The first month I didn't have a place of my own.<br/><br/>The second month I hadn't chosen a provider.<br/><br/>The third month I didn't have a phone (needed for the provider we chose).<br/><br/>Somewhere on the fourth or fifth month we sent the papers in.<br/><br/>Twice.<br/><br/>We waited. Three months or so later, we got a package with "everything we'd need".<br/><br/>We tried setting things up, yesterday, but didn't have neither username nor password.<br/><br/>We phoned them, and they said we should have gotten a letter from them, about a month ago, with a notification that our phone number had changed, our username and password.<br/><br/>We didn't get that letter.<br/><br/>They said they would send the data in an email, in "24 to 48 hours".<br/><br/>Meanwhile, we tested the new phone number...<br/><br/>You try to call it and get a mechanic voice telling you that number doesn't exist.<br/><br/>You try making a call from home and get a busy signal.<br/><br/>You try phoning to the previous number... and it works, apparently (we didn't pick up).<br/><br/>We phone them... and they admit they don't know what's going on...<br/><br/>We now have the username and the password.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, in another city, Viana, I'm trying to switch from another provider to yet another one...<br/><br/>And it's an adventure too...<br/><br/>More later, stay tuned.</p>
