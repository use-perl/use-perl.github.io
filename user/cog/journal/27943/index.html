<p>I've always been interested (as anyone, I guess) in how many people actually read my journal.<br/><br/>Here's what I'll do today (and possibly in some conferences, if it works as intended):<br/><br/>On the bottom of this entry there will be a series of expressions.<br/><br/>Come to me during the day and say one of them. If you're the first to say that one, you get a chocolate :-)<br/><br/>Rules:<br/><br/>Rule #1: don't tell anyone about this. People will not get chocolate if they're forwarded to my journal by someone else... unless they start crying or sobbing... :-)<br/><br/>Rule #2: if possible, say the expression in front of as many people as possible, and as loud as you can. If there's no one around who hasn't got a chocolate yet, you won't get a chocolate; if people can't hear you, you won't get a chocolate :-)<br/><br/>Now, since the words (in Portuguese, this time) are pretty stupid, this is bound to be a very interesting day, particularly when people who really don't know what's going on start trying to say stupid words too, just to see if something (me giving them chocolate) happens :-)<br/><br/>Here's the list:<br/><br/>rabanetes estereofÃÂ©licos
macaquinhos de collans
pantufinhas de menina
pijaminhas cor-de-rosa
motoristas piquininos
abracinhos da branca de neve<br/><br/>This is bound to be a *very* interesting day O:-)<br/><br/><small>(offer limited to the availability of chocolate; limited to one chocolate per person; non cumulative with other offers)</small></p>

MOTORISTAS PIQUININOS!<p>
(I'm yelling in hopes that you'll hear this all the way from Toronto.  Hope my lack of ability to speak Portuguese does not cause a problem in comprehension.  At least I said it loud enough for a large number of people on use.perl to have heard me, modulo their lack of comprehending Portuguese.)</p>

By the way, I chose that particular phrase because I had some recognition of both of the words.  Piquininos was mentioned in "Children of the Mind" (the fourth book in the Ender's Game series by Orson Scott Card) as the basis of the nickname of one of the children.  Motoristas are, obviously, terrorists that use motor vehicles as their weapon - i.e. about one out of every four people I pass on the highway.

"Piquininos" actually has a typo, on purpose, so that the accent is funnier<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-) "Pequenino" derives from "pequeno", and both mean "small, or "short".<br><br>"Motorista" means "driver"<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br><br>So you chose "short drivers", but kind of in child-say. Unfortunately for you, somebody else on IRC had already tried that one!<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-D<br><br>You wouldn't believe how much fun I'm having with all this<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)
