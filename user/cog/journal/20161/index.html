<p>No, this is not a post on which one of those would win <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/zorknapp/journal/20150">a fight</a> between the two, should they get into one :-)

<p>This post is about a doubt I have, and that keeps confusing more and more each time I ask somebody about it :-)

<p>Is it "kilometer" or "kilometre"?

<p>According to a friend of mine, the first is tipically american and the second one european...

<p>However, <a href="http://britannica.com">Britannica</a> seems to <a href="http://www.britannica.com/dictionary?book=Dictionary&va=kilometre&query=kilometre">fail</a> to recognize kilometre :-|

<p>Can anyone *please* help me with this?</p>

<h2>Britanica is a strange beast...</h2>

<p>Briticanica is a strange beast and not the best source for spelling differences between English and American. The book started out in the UK with accepted English spellings (for the day - they do change), but was sold to an American publisher. For a number of years it was therefore policy to standarise spellings on American rather than English norms, but it was not done in one go, and it was a slow process, so spellings vary depending upon the edition you read. I had a conversation with one of their editors on the topic a number of years ago, so I got this from an insider. Basically everything was to switch from English to American, except some things, but even then there were many things that hadn't switeched.</p>

<p>Since my conversion with an editor, things have changed again, I now believe it's owned by a Swiss company, and so perhaps it should now change language altogether! They stopped producing paperware versions, and moved electronic...</p>

<p>Any quality English dictionary should have all recognised variants of given words, and a clue as to where and when the differing variants are or were spoken.</p>
