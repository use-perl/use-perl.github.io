<h1>My talks for YAPC::NA::2005</h1>

<div class="span8">
<p>I have two main talks, 40 minute each, to give at <a href="http://yapc.org/America/">YAPC::NA::2005</a>:

<p><b>Perl Black Magic unleashed - Obfuscation and Golfing</b>

<p>This one is practically ready. I have <a href="http://jose-castro.org/talks/lpw2004/perl%20black%20magic%20enhanced%20-%20more%20obfuscation,%20more%20golfing.pdf">160 slides</a> that took me 40-45 minutes to go through, <a href="http://london.pm.org/lpw/">last time</a>. I'm gonna take some of them out (about 20-30, at least) and probably substitute them with some more slides on the Golfing section. 

<p>I would like to include a section on Secret Operators, but I would need and extra 20 minutes for that... I know this talk will be the last of day 1, so there's no one else waiting for me to finish in order to start the next talk, but going on just wouldn't be fair, now would it? :-) At the most, one can take more time with questions and comments, but I'm not sure I'll be able to do the part on Secret Operators...which is a pity, because I was convinced this would be the last time I'd give this talk and, hence, my last oportunity to include a new section in it... :-\

<p><b>Perl Blue Magic - Creating Perl modules and Using the CPAN</b>

<p>As I said before, there's a couple of reasons why this talk is blue, and I will go through them on the talk itself.

<p>Anyway, I recently wrote a <a href="http://perlmonks.org/?node_id=431702">guide on creating Perl modules</a>, and am working on a new one (Perl Modules: Beyond Basics), so that means I know what I want to talk about.

<p>But here comes a problem: <a href="http://jose-castro.org/talks/yapceu2004/perl%20white%20magic.pdf">Perl White Magic</a> is fun because it has evolving code and a joke between each two problems. Perl Black Magic is also fun because people laugh at the tricks I show and there are also a couple of jokes. Both these talks are pretty straight forward, but...

<p>What am I gonna do for the Blue one? :-\

<p>My current idea is that of having slides and coding at the same time, actually creating a module (and possibly submitting it to PAUSE, if there's connectivity) during the talk. But so far that's it...

<p>I need a great idea :-\</p>

Looking forward to seeing your talk on Golfing and Obfuscation<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)  Has always been something that I found interesting and fun, but quite frankly suck at<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)  Would like to see your other talk, too, but it conflicts with something else I'm seeing.<br> <br>Good luck with your prep for these!<br> <br>Jason

The first I gave that talk, it conflicted with another one <i>*I*</i> wanted to see<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

<i>(and possibly submitting it to PAUSE, if there's connectivity)</i> <p>
There will be wireless and wired connectivity (modulo unexpected technical problems, of course).</p> <p>
I recall a mention once of a presenter running a wiki online during a presentation, with audience participation.  You could do a PAUSE submission of a group programming effort.  (That might be painful, though, unless the wiki used a clever source control backend to merge together simultaneous updates to the same file.</p>
