<p>This is the first Call for Papers for YAPC::EU::2005<br/><br/>Location: University of Minho, Braga, Portugal<br/><br/>Dates: 31 of August to 2 September of 2005.<br/><br/>Important deadlines:<br/><br/>        * Proposal Submission Deadline: Sunday, May 15th 2005
        * Speaker Notification: Monday, Sunday, June 19th 2005
        * Papers/Slides for Proceedings: Sunday, July 31th 2005<br/><br/>The theme for this year's conference is "Perl Everywhere"; we are therefore looking for talks on this topic. Show us on which platforms you use Perl and what for. We will also, of course, accept talks on topics that are not related to the theme.<br/><br/>If you have an idea for a talk you'd like to give, or a topic you'd like to hear a talk on, you should post a synopsis on our conference wiki (http://braga.yapceurope.org/index.cgi?TalkProposals) to see what others think. Proposed talks with a favourable response on the wiki have a better chance of getting accepted!<br/><br/>Please submit your proposals to no later than midnight GMT on Sunday, May 15th. Each submission should be for only one talk, and should include a brief bio, the talk title, the proposed length for the talk, and a brief description of it. An outline of the main points can also be helpful, and is required for tutorial proposals. Each speaker may submit as many talks as he/she wants to.<br/><br/>All speakers will have their registration fee waived.<br/><br/>We will be offering a number of time-slots for talks:<br/><br/>Standard: 20 minutes<br/><br/>This is the preferred format. It is expected that the majority of talks will be of this length.<br/><br/>Long : 40 minutes<br/><br/>Long talks are reserved for experienced speakers covering large topics. If you have an in-depth topic you would like to present in some detail, perhaps with considerable discussion, a double-slot may be available. However you should also consider splitting it into two standard talks (perhaps an introduction and a more advanced talk).<br/><br/>Tutorial: 3 hours (including break)<br/><br/>Half-day tutorials. These tutorials tend to cover a wide range of material on a certain aspect of Perl programming. For example, an XML tutorial could cover XML basics, to writing XML, to parsing XML, to practical uses of XML.<br/><br/>Conference organisers reserve the right to change the length assigned to a talk, if deemed appropriate.</p>
