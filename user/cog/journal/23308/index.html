<p><b>Problem</b>: uploading an image to Bricolage would produce the following error:

<p><code>fileparse(): need a valid pathname at /usr/local/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.6/Bric/Util/Trans/FS.pm line 864</code>

<p><b>Trying to find the cause/solution:</b> <small>(some steps may have been ommited/forgotten)</small>

<ul>
<li>tried with a different filename</li>
<li>tried with a different filetype</li>
<li>tried with an image that had worked before (system was migrated)</li>
<li>tried with a different browser</li>
<li>tried from different machines</li>
<li>even checked on the files permissions</li>
</ul>

<p>I went to the filesystem of the machine running Bricolage:

<ul>
<li>checked for permissions</li>
<li>checked for diskspace</li>
<li>tried finding the place where the images would be placed (and there they were, but empty (0 bytes))</li>
<li>checked the error log (nothing interesting there, but it turns out I had misread the log; more later)</li>
<li>checked if the database was up</li>
</ul>

<p>Meanwhile:

<ul>
<li>used Google</li>
<li>asked on irc</li>
</ul>

<p>None of this had helped so far

<p>I went to the code:

<ul>
<li>found the module causing the error</li>
<li>edited it so to understand what was causing the error (turns out the filename was being passed without any value to File::Basename::basename; a bit of hardcoding showed that there would be problems later on anyway)</li>
<li>found out which module was calling the function with a "die caller" on the line causing the error</li>
<li>edited that module (Bric::App::Callback::Profile::Media)</li><li>found the line calling the function that would die</li><li>debugged just to be sure there wasn't any filename (and there wasn't, $upload->filename was empty)</li>
<li>used Data::Dumper (and die) to check on $upload and $fh (the result of $upload->fh); turns out, $fh was undef (interesting, uh?); $upload is an Apache::Upload object</li>
<li>died with $upload->size just to check its value... it was 0</li>
</ul>

<p>And then I went out to lunch; on the way to the restaurant, it hit me: there was probably an area missing; the filename was getting there, because it was being written as an empty file; its contents, however, were not; one possibility would be a missing directory or something in an intermediate area.

<p>Of course that... searching for something that is missing isn't quite the easiest thing to do, right? This didn't work.

<p>Round 2:

<ul>
<li>checked the error logs again, and indeed there were problems writing the files (permission denied), but where?</li>
<li>checked for the configuration files, to search the temp directories for the upload stuff; no problems found there...</li>
</ul>
<p>Time for some new tactics:
<ul>
<li>tried cleaning the cache; didn't work</li>
<li>next step: update Bricolage; didn't work either</li>
<li>reinstalled libapreq; problem persists</li>
</ul>

<p>And that's where I am right now. Others have tried to help, but no one managed to come up with a solution so far... Ideas are welcome.

<p>We're still trying different approaches, but I'm not sure...

<p>What I think is that there's a temporary directory somewhere without permissions... I already checked the configuration, and TEMP_DIR is set to be /tmp, which has all the permissions she needs...</p>
