<p>I'm part of the <a href="http://belfast.yapc.org/">70% YAPC:EU speakers </a> that still haven't provided "material for the proceedings" (and yes, I'm ashamed).

<p>I finished an article (if you may call it an article) on special variables and command line switches yesterday.

<p>I am looking for one or two people to read it and give me some feedback... anyone willing to volunteer? :-| I would be very grateful, as I wrote this with very little time on my hands and I'm afraid I might have some mistakes and such that may have escaped my sleepy eyes, yesterday :-)

<p>I warn you right now it's scientific, but not a scientific paper... :-)

<p>Send me mail to jac [at] natura.di.uminho.pt if you're interested. Thanks :-)</p>

I didn't get anything. Did you send it to the
Yahoo account ? (maybe it was spam filtered ?!?!)

Yes, I sent it to the Yahoo account... yes, spam filtering is a possibility...<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-|

<p>Nevertheless, <a href="http://natura.di.uminho.pt/user/jac/stuff/articles/en/perl_white_magic.pdf" title="uminho.pt">here</a uminho.pt> it is<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>

Very nice read. It was difficult to understand what it's about from the start, but eventually I got it. A fresh attitute indeed. Pity that $_ itself isn't described - it's one of the more important variables out there...<p>
I saw no obvious problems except for a few very minor English flops, but I'm not the definite authority on that. You should also get a native English speaker (not necessary a JAPH) to take a look.</p>

Thanks for your time, spur<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br> <br>I guess you're right... $_ should be more described...<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-|<br> <br>Any volunteers to check on my English?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-|

I think I figured it out<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br> <br>The article has now a subtitle wich includes "vol 1"<br> <br>In a near future (I hope), I will be writting "vol 0", where I'll describe $_<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br> <br>I guess that's the only way to go around with it right now<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)
