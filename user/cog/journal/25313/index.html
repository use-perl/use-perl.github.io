<p>Greetings :-)<br/><br/>The organizers of YAPC::EU::2005 would like you all to know how things are going.<br/><br/>This is report #12 and here are some details:<br/><br/><b>Book your hotel room</b><br/><br/>The Hotel de LamaÃÂ§ÃÂ£es has told us (we asked) they only have about fifteen rooms left. Book as soon as you can.<br/><br/>If you don't make it in time, there are always <a href="http://braga.yapceurope.org/index.cgi?BragaHotels">other options</a>.<br/><br/><b>We're on IRC</b><br/><br/>The organizers (and a bunch of other people) can be found on IRC. The server is irc.perl.org and the channel is
#yapc.<br/><br/>We discuss a bit of everything in that channel.<br/><br/>Our nicknames (organizers) are cog and ambs.<br/><br/>That is also the channel for YAPC::NA::2005, which is next week, so expect traffic there to increase during that period.<br/><br/><b>Photos of Portugal</b><br/><br/>There are now some <a href="http://braga.yapceurope.org/index.cgi?PortugalPhotos">photos of Portugal on the wiki</a>.<br/><br/>They're not many, and there's not much information in that page, but it'll give you a taste of the country.<br/><br/>There are links, too.<br/><br/><b>Looking for the stars</b><br/><br/>Have you written/co-authored a Perl book, or perhaps created a module that everybody uses? Are you a Perl star?<br/><br/>Are you coming to YAPC::EU::2005?<br/><br/>If you think that people knowing you're coming will influence their decision on attending the conference (for good or bad), please tell us so at yapc@perlhackers.org<br/><br/><b>Getting the speakers on the mailing list</b><br/><br/>If you happen to know a speaker and know he/she's not on this mailing list, please try to convince him/her to subscribe :-)<br/><br/>Banging his/her head on the wall for about five minutes usually does the trick...<br/><br/>More than five minutes is not recommended, as they still have to be able to speak...<br/><br/><b>Behind the scenes action:</b><br/><br/><ul>
<li>The tshirts have been ordered</li>
<li>Some of the items for the bags you'll receive have already been purchased, others have been ordered</li>
<li>I'll be at YAPC::NA::2005 next week, so you can ask me questions in person, if you want</li>
<li>Alberto won't be at YAPC::NA::2005 because "somebody needs to work for this thing"</li>
</ul><br/><br/>And that's it for now.<br/><br/>As always, the organizers can be reached at yapc@perl-hackers.net<br/><br/>Kind regards,<br/><br/>Jose and Alberto</p>
