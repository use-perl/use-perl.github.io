<p>We <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/cog/journal/24736">finally</a> saw <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0320661">the movie</a>. I liked it. A lot.

<p>I had heard some very bad critics to it, which I don't think are fair.

<p>Some told me the movie was too long. They told me so in such a way that I thought, by the time it was almost ending, that there'd be still about an hour more. The duration was just fine.

<p>Some told me <a href="http://imdb.com/name/nm0089217/">Orlando Bloom</a> wasn't up to the part, but I disagree. Actually, I think he was very good; he gave of himself precisely what he had to for that part. And he was way better than <a href="http://imdb.com/name/nm0001557/">Viggo Mortensen</a> by <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0167260/">the end of the LOTR trilogy</a> anyway :-)

<p>No, it isn't the "best movie ever", nor even the "movie of the year", but it is quite good, and I'm happy I saw it :-)

<p>Regarding movie trailers, I am very happy that I didn't see any :-) I am almost certain that, had I seen one, I would have known a reasonable part of the story before entering the theatre. Boy, was I surprised when I saw the... er... OK, no more spoilers for today :-) <b>Go see :-)</b>

<p>And as for our last bad experience with movie theatres, we didn't complain or anything. No, the reason is not about the delay. It's simply that I feel that, although the theatre is responsible for bad behaviour inside it (they should be on the lookout for it and prevent/avoid/stop it), we would still be bothering ourselves and probably some other people that weren't even working there that day. Plus, it wouldn't solve anything, as what happened is already past. We'll simply stop going there, since we now know what expects there behind those doors.

<p>And anyway, 3.5 euros don't make me any richer :-)</p>
