<p>Why? Why did I have to start reading <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1857231589/qid=1112002222/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_10_1/202-3613777-8594242">Rendezvous with Rama</a>? And why did it have to be so darn good?

<p>I started reading it yesterday, and am now at about page 85 (of 250 or so). And I didn't read more because during the 5 hour bus journey I made I didn't have any light (I found out later that I could have ask the driver to turn the switch on, and I'd have had reading light in my seat).

<p>Anyway, I went to bed at about 1:30... I was having a hard time sleeping, and I think it was because of Rama... I just couldn't think of anything else, I guess...

<p>By 4 am I finally gave up... I turned on the light and started reading again! I'm not sure whether I read for half an hour or an hour more, but I know I read for a while...

<p>When I finally managed to fall asleep, I found myself in the weirdest of nightmares (no, it had nothing to do with Rama... oddly, it had to do with Perl!!! must check with a doctor...)

<p>Anyway, I got up at 8, so... I'm a bit sleepy... and can barely wait to pick the book up again :-|

<p>Damn you, <a href="http://www.clarkefoundation.org/">Arthur C. Clarke</a>!!! <small>(for being such a good writer)</small></p>

The first book is great, but the sequels pretty much suck.

<h2>Differing Opinion</h2>

<p>Well, I <em>loved</em> the other three books when I read them in grad school (back in the mid-90s). I found the stories much more compelling and believable than the first book. The third book pretty much blew my mind (the fourth wasn't as good). The style of the first book felt very dry and scientific to me&#x2014;very little character development, IIRC.</p>

<p>But that's just my opinion.</p>

I understand what you're saying (and I might check on the other books), but it's precisely the fact that the author doesn't hold you back with details and gives new material, new theories, new developments every new chapter that I like!

<p>And each chapter has only a couple of pages, which I love<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>
