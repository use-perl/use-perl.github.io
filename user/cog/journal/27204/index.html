<p>So after breaking the contract with Oni we now have to wait to get out money back.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, after a lot of browsing through the Sapo and NetCabo badly constructed webpages (because it's really hard to find what you're looking for), we decided to go with Sapo.<br/><br/>We also decided to go with the Wireless solution, which costs 99 euros.<br/><br/>Today we went out searching for a kit.<br/><br/>7 stores.<br/><br/>Out of stock.<br/><br/>In the first store we asked a bunch of questions, and with one of the answers we got to know that "all the modems have RJ45 connections, yes." Since we couldn't find the Wireless package anywhere, we finally decided to buy the regular one, at the 7th store, but only after the person behind the counter tried selling us a completely different thing and making a couple of weird statements which made me wonder if she was on drugs...<br/><br/>We got home.<br/><br/>We opened the box.<br/><br/>No RJ45 connection.<br/><br/>Only a USB one.<br/><br/>And worse... none of our computers seems able to detect that thing. It's just as if it were dead.<br/><br/><a href="http://use.perl.org/user/include">include</a> phoned Sapo and, as expected, went through some pointless conversation with a clueless person. He asks if it's normal for no lights to turn on on the equipment and the person claims he has to activate the service first (basically, claiming we can't possibly complain from the equipment malfunctioning without having gone through all the legal paperwork first); include asks with what OS's does the package work and the person claims the package works with all kind of computers... No, no, no, no, no, OS != computer. I don't even think that person is aware that there's more operating systems besides Windows...<br/><br/>I know this is my country, but truly... you can have it.</p>
