<p><a href="http://use.perl.org/user/Beatnik/journal/21942">Beatnik has cracked his head</a>. Fortunately, he seems to be in a good mood (the effects of the anesthesia haven't worn out yet, uh?)

<p>Anyway, this reminded me of <a href="http://use.perl.org/comments.pl?sid=23684&cid=36195">several things that happened to me while I was a kid</a> (and another one when I was 20 ;-( )

<p>For those who have read my comment and thought "Ouch": that's nothing!!!

<p>You know, I used to fall off my bed when I was kid. Once, I even fell out of bed with a blanket and a cushion, didn't wake up, rolled beneath the bed still sleeping, and got my mother worried in the morning, when she couldn't find me!

<p>But that's still not the funniest! The funniest was one time I did wake up... no, I did not wake up when meeting the floor... I actually woke up when my head got stuck between the bed and the side table!!! And yes, the rest of my body did meet the floor, it was just the head that got left behind!

<p>But if you think that's funny, you should really know what happened to my brother once :-)

<p>My mother used to dress him while he was standing on his bed. Then, she would take one step back, spread her arms wide open, say something like "Come" and he would jump to her arms (yes, kind of what made me bump into a wall once, if you read my comment).

<p>So one day we hear my brother crying. He was sleeping, woke up and started crying. Me and my mother started walking towards his bedroom, while he was walking in our direction. Now, when we saw each other, there were 11 steps of a stair between us, with him on top of those. My brother was still crying a bit, so my mother spreaded her arms and said something like "Oh, my poor baby. Come here."

<p>BIG MISTAKE!!!

<p>Because he did!! :-) He jumped through the stairs :-) Or at least two or three steps of it...

<h2>Say no to drugs :)</h2>

There are 3 stitches and to get me drugged would've taken at least 4 shots.. so I skipped the anesthesia and had the doctor sow me up without... without screaming

So you mean the doctor didn't scream?



<h2>Ok, own up</h2>

Tell us: Who held your hand while you were sewn up?<br>
She must have been *very* sweet for you to have appeared so manly<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-P<p>
Or... maybe they just used some duct-tape on your mouth....</p>

The nurse wasn't all THAT cute<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) They had my eyes covered so I couldn't see. I doubt the nurse stayed the whole 10 minutes. Duct tape? There is an idea!
