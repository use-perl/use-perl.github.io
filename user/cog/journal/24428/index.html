<p>Lisbon to Toronto (passing through Heathrow) and back again, by British Airways, flying there on 24th June and leaving Canada on the 29th, is at 700 euros (already with taxes).

<p>Should anyone have any suggestion regarding other airlines (neither TAP nor Portugalia fly to Toronto, apparently), I'm all ears.</p>

I'm flying Lufthansa via Frankfurt, which worked out the cheapest for me at just over &#163;500 (about 739 EUR). However, having a friend who works for Lufthansa, who is hoping to bump me up to business class helped to sway me<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)

If you can get to any budget airline airports, you might save a bit. According to <a href="http://www.departures-arrivals.com/europe-who-flies-where.htm" title="departures-arrivals.com">Who Flies Where</a departures-arrivals.com> there is a company called SATA that flies Lisbon to Toronto. And by the looks of their schedules they fly direct too!</p>

The link you gave me will be handful, thanks<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

<p>OTOH, SATA, unfortunatelly, has a sad history of leaving passangers stranded in Azores, from time to time<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-) Every company has the potential to have a plain malfunctioning, but I guess they just have bad luck and not that many spare plains O:-)

</p> <p>And whenever that happens, it hits the news, because people usually wait for a few days (or more).

</p> <p>Also, their site a little bit stupid... it shows me a big list of flights to Canada and another back to Portugal; I have to choose one of each and then hit a button and wait for the message (something like "No seats available for those flights"). Oh boy... talk about bad interfaces...<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-\</p>

<h2>nothing direct</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jmm/">jmm</a> on 2005-04-28T15:30:52</h3>
I'm surprised - I expected that there would be direct flights between Toronto and Lisbon (but not Braga), but checking Air Canada's routes shows that they have no Portugal destinations.  So, Portugal and Canada likely have no flight agreements (such agreements tend to be reciprocal and the Canadian side would be owned by Air Canada).  The "closest" direct flights would be to Madrid, which doesn't help really (London is more on the way).  Having a stop-over in New York might save a bit of time; going through London might give a (unlikely) chance to meet up with other EU attendees.
