<p>Yesterday I went out for a walk... I came home by 12:00. No, not midnight, midday! :-) Relax! It was all premeditated :-)<br/><br/>We went on a bus by 20:00, and arrived near FÃÂ¡tima somewhere around midnight. All I was expecting was a couple of masses and walking all night (that was the idea). The part about the masses... well... I'll skip that part, because I'm not really a Catholic... :-\ But let me tell you: I really enjoyed the whole thing! :-) There were dances and singing, lots of walking, things to eat... oh, and I went with my girlfriend (who is probably sleeping by now)... Cool :-) Oh, btw, now that I mention it: REALLY COOL!!! As in "freezing"!! :-) I don't think I took enough clothing with me :-)<br/><br/>I haven't slept yet (apart from maybe 2:30 hours on the bus, on the way back).<br/><br/>In other news, I'm flying to Brazil tonight (Summer... hum...). By chance, my father is flying in the following night, from Italy, so I guess I'll only see him in about a week or so.<br/><br/>Oh, yesterday I bought a book!! (been looking for this one for a long time) Dune!!! Maybe I'll take it with me to Brazil :-)</p>
