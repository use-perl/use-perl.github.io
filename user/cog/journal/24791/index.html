<p><b>KISS - Keep it Short, Sir</b>

<p>You want to keep your journal entries as short as possible (too much text frightens readers).

<p>If you're talking about different subjects, you might want to consider writing different journal entries.

<p>At the very least, try not making too big paragraphs. It hurts the eyes and makes tired readers skip your entry.

<p><b>Explain what you're talking about</b>

<p>Remember that many people reading your journal have no idea of what you're talking about.

<p>Going around saying "hey, this app rocks" won't bring as many people to it as it would if you'd just say what it does.

<p><b>Know that you can activate the comments</b>

<p>Don't forget to activate comments. Most new users do forget (I guess they just don't see it), and then they wonder why noone cares about them.

<p><b>You don't need a PAUSE ID (to have a journal here)</b>

<p>Speaking of new users: in a short trade of emails a guy once told me he thought one needed a PAUSE ID in order to get a journal here (he thought so because he was seeing the same ids on both places).

<p>No, you don't need a PAUSE ID in order to create a journal here.

<p><b>Add links</b>

<p>Links are nice.

<p><b>KISS - Keep it Short, Sir</b>

<p>Did I mention that you should keep your journal entries short?</p>

<blockquote> <div> <tt>Remember that many people reading your journal have no idea of what you're talking about.</tt> </div> </blockquote>Some of my friends and acquaintances read my blog. I've had some remarks about writing this or writing that and I notice that that stopped me from writing about issues that are too personal, when in fact, I shouldn't be bothered. My blog is place to rant. Sometimes it's just fun to be the only one who know what you're talking about and being able to look back at it later on and laugh.

<p>I don&#8217;t think short entries are key to anything. It&#8217;s just easier to get them right (and harder to waste effort when on them you don&#8217;t).</p>

<p>Structuring your text well when you post longer entries, however, is a must.</p>
