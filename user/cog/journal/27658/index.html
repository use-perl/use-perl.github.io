<p>Does anyone around here use wireless headphones?<br/><br/>If so, what are your thoughts on it?<br/><br/>I was thinking that since I can control my music from a distance it would also be interesting to hear it with my headphones, but not necessarily "tied" to my laptop.</p>

A friend and former coworker used to wear a pair of wireless headphones around the office all the time, blasting techno from shoutcast.  When he had the headphones on, that meant he didn't want anyone to distract him, even if he was on the way to the bathroom, or getting a Diet Coke.<br><br>He absolutely loved them.  These days he works from home, and so doesn't use them much, I think.

Did it require bateries, or was it rechargeable?<br><br>You wouldn't happen to know the model, would you? O:-)

It had two rechargable batteries, so that one could charge while the other was in use.  He loved that feature.  I don't recall the model, though, sorry.  In any case, I think he had problems with some plastic part breaking, and had to duct tape it back together, so I'm not sure you'd want that exact model anyway.

<h2>I use some...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Purdy/">Purdy</a> on 2005-11-21T13:43:47</h3>
Got <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001FTVEA/002-9202013-5656821?v=glance&amp;n=172282&amp;n=507846&amp;s=electronics&amp;v=glance" title="amazon.com">these</a amazon.com> for a great deal ($39) and I wear 'em throughout work.  Pay attention to <a href="http://bensbargains.net/" title="bensbargains.net">Bens Bargains</a bensbargains.net> - they'll let you know when a good deal comes up.<br><br>My only beef with 'em is that they overheat my ears after a while, so I take breaks every once in a while.  But great sound and tetherless.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br><br>- Jason
