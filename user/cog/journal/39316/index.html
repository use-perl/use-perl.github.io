<p>Greetings, and welcome to the eighth YAPC::EU::2009 newsletter.
<br />

<br />
In this issue:

<br />

</p>
<ul>
<li>current stats
</li>
<li>send-a-newbie results
</li>
<li>conference dinner
</li>
<li>quizz show
</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's get down to it:
<br />

</p>

<strong>Current Stats</strong>

<p>We currently have 288 confirmed attendees, and the number is still growing.
<br />
The partner program is still open and a few more people register to it every other week. We're already sorting out several of the minor details.
<br />

</p>
<strong>Send-a-newbie results</strong>

<p>The send-a-newbie program will be sending three people who've never attended a YAPC before and who wouldn't be able to do so on their own.
<br />
Alistair MacLeod, Alan Haggai Alavi and Rosellyne Thompson will be attending YAPC::EU::2009.

<br />
The donations for this program will be providing for the costs of their flights to and from Lisbon, their accommodation during the conference, and a few other minor expenses related to the trip. They won't have to pay for the conference registration either.
<br />
Thanks to all who donated and supported this project.
<br />

</p>
<strong>Conference dinner</strong>

<p>Booking.com will be sponsoring the conference dinner.
<br />
On the evening of August the 4th we'll enjoy a great meal in a fantastic restaurant by the Tagus river.
<br />
The menu consists of RodÃÂ­zio. If you've never heard of it, just know that they'll be bringing more and more kinds of meat to your seat during the whole thing.
<br />
There will also be other surprises and events during this dinner, including the Quizz Show.

<br />
For those of you who don't eat meat, this is the time to send us an email off-list and let us know that, so we can make arrangements for you too.
<br />
We want you all to have an amazing time.
<br />

</p>
<strong>Conference tshirts</strong>

<p>The conference tshirts have been ordered.
<br />
We did our very best to comply with the tshirt design that was auctioned last year, where possible.
<br />

</p>
<strong>Quizz Show</strong>

<p>The Quizz Show is going to take place during the conference dinner.
<br />
The <a href="http://yapceurope2009.org/ye2009/wiki?node=QuizzShow">rules are available on the wiki</a> and the Quizz Master is none other than Damian Conway himself.
<br />
Damian and JoÃÂ£o Pedro are hard at work preparing an amazing set of questions for the show; JoÃÂ£o is also taking care of the final hardware arrangements for this event (buzzers, lights, projection, etc.)
<br />

</p>
<hr />

<p>
<br />
That's all for this newsletter; there's less than one month to go until the conference takes place. We couldn't be more excited about it.
<br />
For anything conference related, feel free to contact us at organizers@yapceurope2009.org.
<br />

See you at the next newsletter,
<br />
the organizers
</p></p>
