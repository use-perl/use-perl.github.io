<p>In an effort to "organize" my things, my parents have decided to store my cds.

<p>I have just been through a search of my Smashing Pumpkins-related cds.

<p>I can only find 48.

<p>I have over 60.

<p>Many other cds are missing too, but my mother says everything's in that closet.

<p>I have already taken everything out and in again.

<p>In the cd boxes there are audio, software and empty cases all mixed up. There's no order and the cd cases are not even all facing the same side, which makes search much more amusing.

<p>Before they "organized" my stuff, mind you, the audio cds were in a pile, software in another one, etc.

<p>Boy, am I pissed off!

<p>Why do people always have to try and make my things better!?</p>

People should leave other people's stuff alone.  If they want it organized, they should have asked you.<br> <br>It's even more heinous because they lost stuff from your Smashing Pumpkins collection.  I'd flip my noodle.  Next to Rush and Pink Floyd, those guys are the best.<br> <br>Good luck making heads or tails of the mess.  And bring some good Smashing Pumpkins boots with you to YAPC::NA, will you?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)  I could use some!<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)
