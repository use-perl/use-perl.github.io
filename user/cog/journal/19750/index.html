<h2>Training</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jdavidb/">jdavidb</a> on 2004-07-08T16:23:24</h3>
<p>My new boss (8th of 12 now, I think) in 2002 asked what training courses she could send us to.  I told her I didn't think there were any useful Perl courses for me to attend, as most were pretty basic and I was probably capable of teaching them myself.  But then a little later I got to thinking that a conference would expose me to many advanced topics.  When I suggested it she immediately offered to spring for both YAPC::NA and TPC, but I was unable to make TPC due to a previously scheduled vacation.  If the company hadn't gone through a round of layoffs at the end of the year followed by budget cuts the next, I expect I would have now attended two more YAPC's.</p>

<p>Personally, back in the days when I thought I'd never get to attend a conference, I would have gladly provided my own expenses, lodging, and transportation if the company would have simply provided the time, and I often thought about making that suggestion.  Now that I'm married and sharing a budget with my wife, however, I don't think I could afford to make that offer any more.  (Well, maybe for a close YAPC.)</p>
