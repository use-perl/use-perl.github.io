<div class="span8">
<p>I have a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/cogurov/">free account on Flickr</a>.<br/><br/>Back when I started using it, I remember I checked the limitations of a free account and noticed two important things:<br/><br/>* maximum of three sets
* limit of 20MG upload per month<br/><br/>Now, that's what I remember... I know there were some other things, but I just remember those two, which are the ones I thought were important.<br/><br/>Also, I didn't think they were impeding enough in order for me to not use the site.<br/><br/>Now... I have just hit another limitation... 200 photos.<br/><br/>Every time I upload a new photo, I lose the oldest one...<br/><br/>Well, it's not actually lost, because it's still stored in their drives. I can get it back if I remove some of the newer photos or, I assume, if I buy an account.<br/><br/>I sent Flickr an email, asking if the limitation had always been there (aware that I could have just missed it before), and I got a reply that the limitation was there, and it actually was of 100 photos. Just recently, they say, they changed it to 200.<br/><br/>I find it odd that I missed the limitation when I read the faq the first time around... afterall, it's not a small thing... it's a big thing! It's a very important thing!<br/><br/>But they say it's always been there and I have no way to check it out...<br/><br/>Anyway, I am now considering to keep using Flickr or to store my photos elsewhere (I'm really not feeling inclined to buy an account at this point).<br/><br/>Can anyone tell me if you remember the limitation being there?</p>

<h2>I Remember</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/davorg/">davorg</a> on 2005-12-15T06:40:30</h3>
I certainly remember it being there. I signed up for a free Flickr account whilst I was on the Perl Whirl last October. I got to the 100 photo limit within a couple of days and decided to sign up.



<h2>Static link</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/rafael/">rafael</a> on 2005-12-15T09:40:04</h3>
I think the static link might still work, past the 200 photo limit. You know, like :<br/><br/><a href="http://static.flickr.com/18/23760940_8a868107fa.jpg" title="flickr.com">http://static.flickr.com/18/23760940_8a868107fa.jpg</a flickr.com>



<h2>There!</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/salgadation/">salgadation</a> on 2005-12-16T15:02:18</h3>
Remember perfectly being there. I signup and IMHO it&#180;s worth it.
