<p>So by 4 in the morning, really tired, I closed my iBook.

<p>I was sleepy, but not so sleepy that I wouldn't notice the fan not turning itself off and the sleep led not lighting up...

<p>I waited a few seconds and opened it again...

<p>Nothing changed... and I mean <b>*nothing*</b>!

<p>The led stayed off, the fan stayed on and the screen didn't show anything.

<p>Picked it up just to feel the temperature beneath it, but it was cooler than it usually is.

<p>Tried closing and opening it again a couple of times more... no success.

<p>Hit the "magic button".

<p>That'll teach him!

<p>A couple of notes: I had a bunch of programs running and the laptop was not connected to power (but battery was at about 69%).

<p>I need to think of my possibilities, because I'm hating to lose all the things I have opened, from time to time. Here are the more obvious ones:

<p><ul>
<li>Ask my boss to send the iBook for repair</li>
<li>Re-install OS X</li>
<li>Install something else</li>
</ul>

<p>Yep, that's how frustrated I am.</p>

<h2>similar on powerbook</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/lachoy/">lachoy</a> on 2005-05-20T11:45:21</h3>
<p>This started happening on my powerbook (aluminum 15") after installing 3rd party memory. It's annoying but not enough to fix (for me), especially when the workaround is pretty simple -- instead of putting it to sleep by closing the lid, click the Apple and 'Sleep'. It hasn't failed yet.</p>

<p>The other side-effect is that sometimes it'll freeze at startup, but IMO that's a good trade-off for the memory price I got ($200 vs Apple's $700).</p>
