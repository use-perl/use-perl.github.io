<p>It's been a month since <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/cog/journal/26218">I last complained about our lack of access from home</a>.<br/><br/>By then we already had payed for everything, filled out all the paper work, received word that everything was working and... nothing.<br/><br/>Nothing was working, and the telephone line hadn't, apparently, been switched to our new operator, as they claimed.<br/><br/>One month has passed.<br/><br/>During that month we have complained a number of times. First they told us to wait, then they told us to fill in a bug report, and finally they told us to wait again.<br/><br/>Last week we lost our patience.<br/><br/>We sent all the information we had to the ISP, and we've told them that if in 15 days time the issue hadn't been solved we would cancel the contract and fill in an official complain where possible (possibly with DECO, the Portuguese institution for consumer protection).<br/><br/>Today we called them again. They still have no news for us, and they gave us all the information needed for contract cancellation.<br/><br/>Apparently, all we have to do is call the number they gave us, tell them we wan't to cancel the contract and they give us our money back...<br/><br/>Assuming we'll still be without access by Friday (which I assume we will), we'll cancel the contract and go with an alternative.<br/><br/>It's almost as if they ignore us...<br/><br/>Wait a minute... they *do* ignore us!<br/><br/>Next week we'll probably buy one of those kits with cable TV and internet access. At least it's faster, and we still get cable.<br/><br/>Damned ISP's...</p>
