<p>So what's been going on with my (allegedly) RSI?<br/><br/>I'm using caps lock as control, which keeps one of my fingers in better condition; I'm also typing slower (and maybe less); this is, apparently, producing some results :-) It doesn't hurt so bad anymore.<br/><br/>I am also installing a program to help me on this (more on that later), and also trying to follow some of the other useful advices people gave me on my last journal entry (thanks, guys).<br/><br/>That entry was also useful in the sense that a friend of mine told me "hey, I have RSI too". He's been giving me some useful advices too.<br/><br/>But the funny part of it all was what my boss told me. He said: "I used to have some trouble with my wrists too. What I used to do was to code for half an hour and rest another one... Wait... That's a bad advice."<br/><br/>Eheh :-)</p>

<h2>CAPS lock - or opposite shift key</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/osfameron/">osfameron</a> on 2004-09-30T14:59:14</h3>
I don't think I've had RSI as such, but I occasionally get a twinge.  I used to find it especially hurt to type in CAPITALS.  I eventually worked out that I tend to hold down one shift key and keep it held down while I type the word.
<p>
If instead I make sure that I press the Left shift key while I'm typing a letter with my right hand, and vice versa, then it hurts less.  (I think this is what you are taught in standard touch typing.)
