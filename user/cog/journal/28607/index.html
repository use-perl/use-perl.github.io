<p><b>Yesterday, at the doctor</b>:<br/><br/>She was about to perform an electrocardiogram on me; she was acting very professionally, when I said:<br/><br/>- So... my heart is here, right?<br/><br/>- Yes... Tell me, what do you want to know? What is your question?<br/><br/>- Sometimes I feel some kind of pain in this place...<br/><br/>- You know what they say? That when there's something wrong with the heart, it's not usually the heart that aches!<br/><br/>- Oh, glad to hear that! I feel much more relieved now! It's probably my stomach, or perhaps a kidney, right?<br/><br/>I can't recall a woman in white laughin so hard in my whole life... :-)<br/><br/><b>Today</b>:<br/><br/>It's include's birthday.<br/><br/>Her girlfriend decided to send him some flowers, so early morning she phoned me while we were still at home, asking me for $job's address:<br/><br/>- Cog? Don't say it's me!<br/><br/>And there I was, thinking to myself: "Don't say it's who????"<br/><br/>So I kept my mouth shut until I understood what was going on.<br/><br/>The flowers have just arrived. They're nice :-)</p>
