<p>So yesterday we had our first Lisbon.pm Social.<br/><br/>Due to the last minute scheduling of the meeting (some people were only warned about it a few hours before it took place, apparently), many were not able to show up, as they already had prior engagements (some folks actually called while we were there, apologizing for not being able to come).<br/><br/>Anyway, there were about 60 people at the pub.<br/><br/>And of those, 6 were Perl Mongers O:-)<br/><br/>Oh well, maybe there were more, but I agree that it'd be difficult to find us in there, so we'll wait to hear people complaining O:-)<br/><br/>Things that were mentioned/discussed:<br/><br/>Phalanx, documentation, comments, Storable, Data::Dumper, YAML, JSON, Maypole, Catalyst, Linux, BSDs, LaTeX, Kwiki, the group website and mailing list, beer, orange juice, use.perl, Perlmonks, dildos, Ajax, Javascript, TDD, deep throat, PHP, development machines, PSP, Darcs, svk, svn, cvs, Trac, Ruby on Rails, etc.<br/><br/>It was a great meeting :-)<br/><br/>At some point, the meeting ceassed from being a social and started being a technical one, when one of the mongers got his laptop out and started showing us his Catalyst project. He went through the frontend, on to the code, and finally to some slides of a Catalyst talk. I think we already have a candidate to speak at our first technical meeting :-)<br/><br/>It seems our socials will take place on the last Wednesday of each month, because... well, because yesterday was one of those O:-)<br/><br/>And somebody thought of saying something on the mailing list which is really cool to convince people to show up early:<br/><br/><i>The last one to arrive is a PHP programmer!</i></p>
