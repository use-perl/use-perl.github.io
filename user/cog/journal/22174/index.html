<p>I bought three books today... and already read one of them!!! :-) In the train, from Lisbon to Aveiro (about two hours and a half, and I wasn't always reading).<br/><br/>Anyway, the book is Terry Pratchett's "Mort - The Play".<br/><br/>Right, "The Play"... I know it is probably easier to read and has less text in it, but nevertheless, I read a book in less than a day. My previous record (ever since I started noting these things down) was of six days: Bladerunner, by Philip Dick.<br/><br/>Hurray for me! :-)<br/><br/>What?<br/><br/>Oh, the book is nice, yes :-)<br/><br/>Hurray! :-)</p>

<h2>Normally I take about half an hour...</h2>

to read Asterix O:-)



<h2>The Hobbit in Eight Hours</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ajt/">ajt</a> on 2004-12-07T10:28:30</h3>
<p>Once I couldn't sleep, so I read "The Hobbit" overnight. While ill in hospital once, I had nothing to do all day, so I read "The Lord of the Rings" in about five days. If I have the time, then I can read a shorter Pratchett book in less than one day.</p>

<p>While I can read some things very quickly, it does not mean that I take it all in, but I do have a sufficiently usable facsimile of the book in memory.</p>

<p>When I was younger I had near photographic memory, these days it's not so good, as my better half constantly reminds me...</p>

Now I remember... once, in the hospital, I read the <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0870114638/qid=1102415645/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_27_1/202-8632951-4308636" title="amazon.co.uk"> autobiography of Gichin Funakoshi</a amazon.co.uk> in less than a day, too.

<p>It's amazing what you can read when you are stuck.</p>

The first time I read Lord of the Rings, I started on a Friday evening and finshed the entire set just before Sunday breakfast (which I ate and then went for a much-delayed sleep - I had been awake for about 48 hours, including about 36 hours reading the series with occassional stops for food).<p>

At the other extreme, when I read it to my son as a bedtime story, it took about a year and a half to get through the series, since it was at most a few pages per night.</p>

<p>That is quite impressive! Did you cheat and skip the songs and poems, or read it all?</p>

<p>Thesdays I only get to read when I'm ill and I can't think of anything better to do...</p>

<h2>I must read faster than that...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/btilly/">btilly</a> on 2004-12-10T01:05:04</h3>
I've read a book in a bath before.  Admittedly, a <i>very</i> long bath.  But <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0553250426/002-2003334-7499214?v=glance" title="amazon.com">it</a amazon.com> was also a fairly long book - 800 pages or so.<br> <br>My mother couldn't believe that I'd really read it.  So I had her flip to a random page and start reading until I figured out where it was and then tell her the plot at that point in the book.  After doing this 3-4 times with me figuring it out within a paragraph or two, my mother believed me.<br> <br>We wound up estimating my reading speed at something like 900 WPM.  My reading speed has varied over the years (when I read lots of technical material, it drops, fantasy and sci-fi raise it), but I don't think it has ever been better than that.
