<p>My mother called me, the other day...<br/><br/>It seems my car has developed a new problem and now there's some liquid coming from nearby the pedals. My brother took the car to a garage where they told him the direction is breaking and it must be replaced. They also told him this costs ~500 euros.<br/><br/>So now I really don't know what to do...<br/><br/>Paying 500 euros for this seems a waste of money, because no one's been able to find the problem that makes to engine go dead for no apparent reason even when you're on the highway doing 100km/h, which means this might be throwing money out the window, as the motor can go permanently dead any day.<br/><br/>Buying a new car doesn't seem appealing either. I think a car is too expensive for the use I give it, and I'm sure it'd take me a long time to pay for it...</p>

<p>Get a used car? You can find a small and old, but still quite decent used car for that much money, if you are lucky. If you raise the ceiling up to &euro;2,500 or so you can easily find a pretty well maintained car.</p>

<p>Make sure to mine your old car for spare parts that may be worth some money.</p>
