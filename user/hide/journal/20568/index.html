<p>Today I spent entirely too much time trying to install modules on RedHat boxes. 
<p>
My new notebook for work (IBM T41) is now running Fedora Core 2. I was attempting to update Test::Harness and kept running into a problem with one of the tests (test-harness.t test #40). Which is a known issue but for some reason I decided to find the cause. I didn't find it, but spent too long looking. Hopefully I'll be able to look again.
<p>
On a RedHat Enterprise Server v3, I've been trying to install CPANPLUS. There were a number of different errors that I looked through but wound up looking at the Makefile. The Makefile is a mess. Unmatched quotes, half a directive on one line, the rest as the value for another. Really weird. I have more to look into there too but it might be pointless as we might rebuild with Fedora Core 2 as we are not happy with RHES.</p>

<h2>Building modules on Red Hat</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/iburrell/">iburrell</a> on 2004-08-26T19:56:29</h3>
Red Hat Enterprise Linux may have the same problem that afflicted RH 9 and caused Makefiles to be corrupted.  The change that made was Red Hat making UTF-8 locales the default, for example en_US.UTF-8.   Older Perl 5.8 versions had a bug that produced corrupt Makefiles with a UTF-8 locale.

<p>
The solution is to set the C locale before building modules.</p><blockquote><div> <tt>export LANG=C<br>perl Makefile.PL</tt> </div></blockquote>

That was it exactly. I just finished the CPANPLUS install and can now move onto getting other work done. Thank you very much.

Yes, that's exactly it. Knowing what it is now, I've forced the install of Test::Harness.
<p>
Thank you.</p>
