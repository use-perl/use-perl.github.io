<p>I've had this idea for a home project for a number of months and just recently started working on it. I quickly created a database design (that was scrapped and rewritten based on input) and a SAX parser to load the data. Having heard good things about CDBI I felt this would be a good project for me to learn it on. I've been using DBI and SQL at work for a while now, and I'm quite comfortable with writing SQL queries to retrieve the data I need, but as this was an exercise in learning CDBI I really wanted to make it work.
<p>
The problem being that I want to retrieve data from one table that matched criteria in two other tables:
<p>
<pre>
            -----------
            - table_1 -
            -----------
     -------- pkey    ------
    |       - title   -     |
    |       - descr   -     |
   /|\      -----------    /|\
-----------             -----------
- table_2 -             - table_3 -
-----------             -----------
- pkey    -             - pkey    -
- fkey    -             - fkey    -
- date    -             - field_3 -
-----------             -----------

</pre>
<p>
select title, descr<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;from table_1, table_2, table_3<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;where table_1.pkey=table_2.fkey and date='2004-12-16' and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; table_1.pkey=table_3.fkey and field_3 = 'test';<br>
<br>
(please note these are only examples and haven't been tested)<p>
While this was easy to come up with in SQL, I was having a tough time figuring out how to achieve the same results in CDBI. At this point I turned to rjbs for guidance. He knew what I was looking for and explained to me what I needed to do. I just wasn't getting it, what seems so simple in SQL was becoming stressful in CDBI. rjbs stuck with me and answered my questions.<p>
I think I've got a solution now that involves retrieving the values of fkey from both table_2 and table_3, finding their intersection and returning the intersection through _ids_to_objects. Resulting in a list from table_1.
<p>
I want to thank rjbs for his help - Thank you!</p>

<h2>See UsingJoins on the wiki</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/TeeJay/">TeeJay</a> on 2004-12-17T09:09:24</h3>
There is a <a href="http://www.class-dbi.com/cgi-bin/wiki/index.cgi?UsingJoins" title="class-dbi.com">UsingJoins</a class-dbi.com> section on the wiki that is quite good.
<p>
The documentation also has quite a lot about using custom sql and Class::DBI provides things like sth_to_objects which allows you to 'SELECT __ESSENTIAL__ from table_foo a, table_bar b where %s' when used with SQL::Abstract.
</p><p>
I was working on something like this last night and it works a treat. I was working from Randal's rather handy example.
</p><p>



<h2>Just use SQL then</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/perrin/">perrin</a> on 2004-12-17T22:46:19</h3>
<blockquote><div> <tt>package TableOne;<br>
&nbsp; <br># set up columns and table here...<br>
&nbsp; <br>__PACKAGE__-&gt;set_sql('by_join' =&gt; qq{<br>select title, descr<br>from table_1, table_2, table_3<br>where table_1.pkey=table_2.fkey and date='2004-12-16' and<br>table_1.pkey=table_3.fkey and<br>field_3 = 'test'});<br>
&nbsp; <br># then, in some nearby code:<br>
&nbsp; <br>my @table_ones = TableOne-&gt;search_by_join();</tt> </div></blockquote>Using SQL directly is what makes Class::DBI so useful, in my opinion.  You always have an escape hatch when you need it.
