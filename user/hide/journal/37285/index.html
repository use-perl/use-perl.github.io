I had planned on writing a long entry as to where I've been, and what 
I've been up to for the last two years, however a cross between 
Fusion and Ubuntu killed that. So here is the abridged version.
</p>
<p>
The project I'd been working on for 3 years, finally received 
executive approval and funding, but the timeline was extremely tight.
A management change brought a lot of finger pointing, and changes to
how the department functions. Even though the department was successful
for the 9 years prior.
</p>
<p>
So I left. Took a new job almost a year ago doing SQL development in
a data warehousing, business intelligence, environment. Quite a bit
different than the transaction based database work I had been doing.
</p>
<p>
What about Perl? Well I haven't done any real Perl work in about a year
now. Although I have recently started a new project (more on that to
come).
</p>
<p>
For some reason, I haven't been receiving emails for my PAUSE account. I
was still getting lots of spam, so I didn't think there was anything
wrong. Because I wasn't getting any emails, I figured no one was using
the modules I wrote. Luckily David Bartle went out of his way to track 
me down over some issues with CPAN::Mini::Inject (and he supplied patches
with tests!). I've now changed the email address that PAUSE uses, and 
am receiving mail again. brian d foy has since contacted me with an
issue he's seen with Test::Output so I know it's really working.
</p>
<p>
To help things along, I've moved the repositories for these projects
off of my subversion server (that no one seems to know about) onto
github.
</p>
<p>
The repositories can be found at:
</p>
<p>
CPAN::Mini::Inject - <URL:http://github.com/ssoriche/cpan--mini--inject/tree>
</p>
<p>
Test::Output - <URL:http://github.com/ssoriche/test-output/tree>
</p>
