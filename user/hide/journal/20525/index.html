<p>I'm writing this very quickly (I hope) while I have a couple of seconds. I keep meaning to post here more often but I never seem to have the time.<p>
I was finally at a point in my personal life where I was starting to get time back for my projects. Having 2 kids (5 and 2) takes up a lot of time, and even more so with me working during the day and my wife working at night. The kids are just getting to the point where they don't require constant supervision and doing most things for themselves. Something strange must have come over me because I made the decision that we're going to get a puppy. <p>
On August 19th we picked up our 8 week old beagle puppy. She's more of a handful than the kids have been (so far). There goes any free time I had.</p>

Puppies are a pain at first while you litter train them, but once they're over that they aren't very much work - and they grow up so much faster than kids.<br> <br>Take lots of pictures - you'll miss those puppy days soon.

<p>Or not... in which case they can be a pain not only for a while but for a long time...<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-|</p>
