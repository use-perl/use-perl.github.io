<p>Wednesday evening, I came down with a bad cold.  It felt like someone was cooking my sinuses from the inside out.  I took a 3 hour nap, then couldn't fall asleep again until 2:00am, then slept through Chris Dolan's Perl Critic talk, as well as the talks about using YUI and cool javascript UI tricks.<br/><br/>I felt well enough to make the hackathon Thursday night, though.  The automated test runs are back up and going, we improved test coverage on WebGUI User a few points, and I learned a lot about Apache::Test.  It would be a lot simpler to have a real request object, rather than all the Test::MockObject hackery and request emulation that we do.<br/><br/>Doug has a branch where he's working on the new Photo Gallery Asset that has some new way of accessing the Asset's output directly, rather than running it through mod_perl.  This is cool, of course, but it still isn't testing the whole flow.<br/><br/>The WRE has its own test suite.  It would be good to have it added to the automatic nightly test run.<br/><br/>It has been a long time since I ran the full test suite through Devel::Cover.  It's time to do it again.</p>
