<p>For the upcoming Pittsburgh Perl Workshop in Oct and YAPC::NA 2009 I want to offer a speaker mentor program.  
<br><br>
I really don't know how I am going to do this just yet, but one thing I know is, I will need is slideware suggestions for potential speakers.
<br><br>
What do people like and why do they like it?  This is asked from the perspective of the speaker and as an audience member.
<br><br>
Wikipedia has not let me down it does give me a decent start but I would like to see what the Perl community has experienced.

<h2>I vote for HTML slides</h2>

<p>I've put together quite a few presentations as HTML slides using a script I wrote that you can <a href="http://wellington.pm.org/articles/slides/" title="pm.org">download from here</a pm.org>.  The notes.txt files should get you going but feel free to email me any questions.  The themes directory contains some short sample presentations to demo a range of different slide layouts.  There's a snippet of JavaScript that allows you to hit space to advance to the next slide so you don't have to fumble around with you mouse clicking on the arrows.</p><p>I wrote an article about this system in a recent Perl Review.  The main advantage for me is that because I create the presentation in a text editor I'm not tempted to waste time tweaking font sizes and other distractions that are very much 'in your face' with a program like Powerpoint.  I also like that I can dump the files on a web server or a USB stick and access them from any machine without special software.</p><p>HTML slides are easy to <a href="http://wellington.pm.org/archive/" title="pm.org">publish online</a pm.org> which is generally a good thing for users.  They can also be indexed readily by search engines and if you put code samples in them it's easy for people to copy and paste.</p>

<p>I've been using <a href="http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/s5/" title="meyerweb.com">S5</a meyerweb.com> for a while now and I generally like the authoring workflow, especially with PPI::HTML to do code colorization.  S5 is supposed to be resolution independent.  However, I got bitten badly at <a href="http://chrisdolan.net/yapcna2008/par-fuse-pdf.html" title="chrisdolan.net">YAPC::NA 2008</a chrisdolan.net> where I planned for 1024x768 but got 800x600, and lost the bottom and right of every slide.  Luckily, I had generous margins so the talk was not a disaster.  In retrospect, I should have just altered the text size with the browser's text zoom, but my brain skipped over that solution at the time.</p><p>My biggest advice to speakers, however, is to PRACTICE YOUR TALK.  Maybe perform it for a smaller group first (like your local perl mongers group).</p>
