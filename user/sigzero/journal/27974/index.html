<p><p>I sent my iBook in for repair. On the way back it gets delivered to a DHL warehouse and gets "lost". Like I believe it was lost. STOLEN is more like it.</p>

<p>Now I have to go through the whole claim process which I am very sure is a fast process.</p>

<p>Well I filled out the paperwork DHL sent me and faxed it back. They absolutely said it was their fault. I then called Apple and go the ball rolling there. Basically, Apple calls DHL and asks "is it lost?" If DHL says "Yes" then Apple gets me a new iBook. The discovery process is 48 business hours. Apple said I didn't have to worry about anything.</p>

<p>I hope someone likes their new iBook. I did.</p>

What about your loss of data/files? Invasion of your privacy, in case there's very personal data on the harddisk?

I backed up before sending it for repairs. The personal data part suck though. I will live and learn with that one.

I would have zero out the disk before sending it out to someone god knows who will inspect your computer.<br><br>is DHL paying apple the ibook for you? i am amazed how it can work out.

<p>Next time I will at least delete all the personal stuff.</p>

<p>I have extended care with Apple. DHL only pays a whopping $100 for lost items. I have no idea if there is some kind of agreement between the two companies.</p>

Most (all?) carriers let you insure your package to a higher amount.  I'm sure Apple does that (or as you said, have an agreement where they get higher coverage).<br><br>
