<p><p>TorgoX recently mentioned some statments from House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi about a conversation she had with Bush. I say she is a liar in the first degree. Here is a news item about her:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><b>Pelosi Didn't Know?</b></p>

<p>House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi says she was caught unawares by the Republican announcement of a bipartisan investigation into the Hurricane response, saying, "There's been no discussion about this except I called the speaker and said IÃ¢â¬â¢m getting press calls about a bipartisan committee."</p>

<p>But sources in both parties say the idea was discussed at the White House earlier in the day by congressional leaders in a meeting with the president with Pelosi attending. In addition, Speaker Hastert was heard discussing it with Pelosi as they were leaving the White House.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So she didn't know anything about a meeting that she attended AND was heard discussing?</p>

<p>Yeah right, I believe her. Don't you?</p></p>

<br>
The people of my state elected Nancy Pelosi to Congress and Arnold (Ahhhhhnolllld) Schwarzenegger as governor???<br> <br><br/><br/>Yes, the same state with the earthquakes, fires, mudslides, and riots.  &nbsp;&nbsp;
Coincidence?  I think not...

<h2>following the Party line</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/yudel/">yudel</a> on 2005-09-09T18:37:26</h3>
Discussing an investigation is not the same as discussing an annoucement about the investigation.<br><br>Given the Republican Party's refusal to allow any discussion on the Katrina aid bill, I see no reason to doubt Pelosi's claim that the Party did not want to allow any discussion about the makup of the committee.

<p>Did you even read what it said? The idea was discussed. What idea? A bipartisan committee. She said the was "NO" discussion about it.</p>

Quite frankly, I wouldn't list *any* politician as a credible source, democrat, republican, whatever.
