<p>I am just curious. I do not have formal education. I do like Perl though. Sometimes it is hard for me to wrap my head around how to do some things that "I" think should be easy. I recently changed projects to a Perl one where I will be maintaining some Perl and refactoring it. Is my path just reading reading reading and taking classes when time allows?<br/><br/>If you are not formally educated (meaning college) as a programmer what did you do?</p>

<h2>Read, Practice and Help Others</h2>

<p>I started by reading everything I could find on Perl.  Then I started using Perl to add functionality to my web site.  Later I started writing stand-alone apps so that I wouldn't have to buy some pricey piece of software. A short time after that I started using Perl at work to make my data entry job easier.  (Stop laughing, the job market sucked.)</p>
<p>It was at that time that I found Perl Monks.  I would read the posts every day and absorb as much as I could.  I started posting replies when I knew the answer (or thought that I did).</p>
<p>I've had several jobs since then and each new job is a step up.  I'm currently working as a (mostly) Perl developer with a snazzy title, "Senior Design Engineer".</p>
<p>I wish you all the best.  May it be a fun and enlightening journey!</p>

While I am college educated I didn't get a degree in programming. I picked up Perl while a software tester. It was mostly for stuff not directly related to the job.<br><br>I got better by reading, hanging out on clpm and reading everything. This started way back in 1996.<br><br>I've rusted somewhat because my current job as a sysadmin hasn't pushed my Perl skills.<br><br>I'm aiming to get sharp again.



<h2>Books, Conferences and Obfuscations</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/domm/">domm</a> on 2007-05-09T05:57:44</h3>
<p>I spend some one or two years at the university, but I was studying sociology and not computer science. When I started with Perl ~10 years ago, I learned all I needed from books like "Learning Perl" and "Advanced Perl Programming (1st Ed.)". In retrospect, my code from this time was horrible.</p>

<p>Then I started to go to conferences (<a href="http://vienna.yapceurope.org/" title="yapceurope.org">YAPC::Europe</a yapceurope.org>, German Perl Workshop,<nobr> <wbr></nobr>..) where I learned a lot (not so much on Perl itself, but more on general development strategies, testing etc). It also helps to give talks, because preparing a talk gives you a good excuse to look very closely at a topic.</p>

<p>The third foundation of my Perl knowlede is (or rather was) doing and decoding <a href="http://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=169437" title="perlmonks.org">Obfuscations</a perlmonks.org>. IMO Obfiscations teach a lot of interesting Perl, and doing things delibertaly wrong (from a design point of view) also teaches you how to do things right.</p>

<p>Currently, I keep up to date by reading use.perl (and occasionally PerlMonks) and by keeping a close eye on new CPAN uploads. And by reading books &amp; going to conferences...</p>



<h2>It was harder in 1988 :)</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/merlyn/">merlyn</a> on 2007-05-09T11:37:59</h3>
I read the perl-1 manpage.  That's how I got started.

I have started printing out the POD stuff (perlreftut, etc.) to read.

I started out with Learning Perl, I have given away copies of this marvelous book. It has assignments, this is what can really get you going, problems that need solving, hands-on is the best way in my opinion.<br><br>I am self-taught, I have some academic experience, but I never finished anything, there was simply too much work<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

<h2>I have thought a lot about this</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Limbic Region/">Limbic Region</a> on 2007-05-09T12:24:27</h3>
so much so, that I have been toying with the idea of writing a book on the topic.  In any case, here are a few links I have written that may be of some interest:
