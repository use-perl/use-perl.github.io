People are not assigned to work on certain projects.  The people who work on Perl 6 are working on Perl 6 because they are interested in Perl 6.  There's no reason to think that those working on Perl 6 would <i>want</i> to work on threading in Perl 5.</p>

I'll second that opinion and sentiment.<br/><br/>It looks like a page a toddler would love except it made mine cry. I just thought it was a joke, until I noticed the furor here. It's not April, is it?<br/><br/>YMMV. HTH. HAND.

<p>Here is a design I made:

</p><p> <a href="http://img515.imageshack.us/i/perl6.png/" title="imageshack.us">perl6.png</a imageshack.us>

</p><p>It only took a few minutes. I hope it fosters some talk and maybe helps understand why I think the current one is defective. It is only a work in progress, and we can change and improve on it a lot; but I just want to put this on the table to show that I'm not being deliberately obtuse; I seriously want the best for perl.

<p>A brilliant arsehole is still an arsehole. Many a free software project has gone to pieces because of people who thought the quality of their work should make up for their bad attitude &#8211; and then several of them ran into each other. That includes various phases in the lifetime of the very project you are disparaging for its lateness.</p><p>But feel free to continue to look down on others.</p>

<p>Good! (I&#8217;m not being sarcastic.) It just seemed you were trying to say bad general attitude can be justified.</p>

<p>No, of course having a terrible attitude is not justifiable. I had to consider not only eating my words but also my career before starting to post.

<p>I can understand that. I was quite disillusioned for a long time&#8230; recently people seem to have gotten into the project who are really pushing it along, though, so I&#8217;m finally feeling hopeful. And the thing about extremely ambitious projects is&#8230; well, the flip side of high risk is high rewards. (I still haven&#8217;t seen anything close to the awesomeness of Apocalypse 5 implemented anywhere else, even so many years after it was written. I still can&#8217;t wait to play with it.) I do cringe at the Camelia thing&#8230; maybe if that was my first renewed impression of Perl&#160;6 I&#8217;d be caustic too. As it is, it&#8217;s merely an irritation, hopefully one that can be fixed before too many people have a new reason to care about Perl&#160;6. We&#8217;ll see.</p>

<p>I think that a lot of that can be implemented using a mixture of FORTH-like defined words and parser combinators. I would make the syntax a lot simpler. But it would not be "perl 6", it would be something else entirely (because I don't own the brand *grin*).
</p><p>If you haven't already done so, have a chat with the factor guys. They have some really cool stuff.</p>

<p>I believe the quality is the overall good Huffman coding<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) If you were to apply that to a mixture of those langs, you could get something very very nice. I hope I will at one point have time to work on that, as a hobby or otherwise.

<p>Yeah, but I think it&#8217;s a bit more yet&#8230; along the lines of willingness to break regularity for the sake of Huffman coding, in spots where it will make a real difference. And it&#8217;s not just the parsing bit but the entire language around it as well, that&#8217;s huffmanised in a similar fashion. Whipuptitude and manipulexity&#8230; hard to describe.</p>
