<p>I will start this off by saying I like and respect this person as a Java developer.<br/><br/>[me]  $coworker is having problems with the CLASSPATH on the command line.
[dev] I don't know how to do that either.
[me] Really?
[dev] eclipse takes care of that for me and I haven't had to do that in years.
[me] Mmmm...uh...okay.</p>

I think this short talk explains so many things about the "parallel universes" or "camps" if you like (Perl, Java,<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...) where developers actually live.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)



<h2>Sounds amusingly familiar</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Yanick/">Yanick</a> on 2008-09-06T14:36:34</h3>
<p>Yup. At $work I've joined a Java project a few months back, and that total reliance on Eclipse to take care of all the under-the-hood details (and the ensuing side-effect that no-one really know how to tinker an ant file, or compile from the command-line)  is something that bemuse me to no end.</p><p>But then, this could also be a defense mechanism.  When I finally found a way for eclipse to show me the classpath used for the project, I must say that a little part of me died.  Ye gods was it ever prolix...</p>



<h2>Tools that work</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ChrisDolan/">ChrisDolan</a> on 2008-09-06T21:05:12</h3>
<p>Actually, this sounds like a success to me!  A high-level tool that is so successful that you don't need to read the specs for the low-level tool?  That's a successful abstraction.</p>

<p>You have a different definition of "success" that I do.</p>

<p>By success, in this case I meant that someone did not need to learn something that was not relevant to getting his/her work done.  Of what benefit is knowing the classpath syntax for command-line Java?  Analogy: using Perl makes knowing the order of arguments of the malloc function useless.  Automatic memory management is a success for Perl, like automatic project management is a success for Eclipse.</p><p>For reference, that classpath syntax is actually simple, but platform-specific (colon or semi-colon as path separators!).  On Windows: <code>java -cp path\to\file.jar;another.jar<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...</code>, on pretty much all other platforms: <code>java -cp path/to/file.jar:another.jar</code>.  In Ant, it's actually MUCH more complicated, involving path tags with nested pathelement tags, but it is platform-independent, happily.</p>

<p>Ah...at that level sure. But you are taking it to the tool level which is where your Perl analogy falls apart. eclipse is not Java and "I" would think a Java programmer would know the classpath syntax.</p>

<p>You only see the difference because the Perl project-management tools aren't good enough yet.</p><p>We'll be fixing that.</p>
