What about what I'd LIKE to do with it?<br><br>What I'd like to have is the CPAN index available as a SQLite database, plus the CPANTS dependency maps, plus the CPAN Testers statistics.<br><br>And then I want a Data::Package::SQLite class, that grabs all of these files every few days, lets me load them with a DBIx::Class loader, and work with them sanely.<br><br>And then finally there might be a simple way to programmatically get access to all the CPAN metadata floating around, but which is most certainly not simple and easy to use.<br><br>use CPAN::Metadata;<br><br>That should be it.

I'm sure you realise that CPAN Testers results is already available as an SQLite database:
<a href="http://testers.cpan.org/testers.db" title="cpan.org">http://testers.cpan.org/testers.db</a cpan.org> (large!)

Yep, I know. That's one of three.<br><br>And I've created Data::Package::SQLite to start heading towards installing that dataset.<br>

<h2>Various uses</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ajt/">ajt</a> on 2006-03-14T12:18:39</h3>
<p>I use it for various things. Works well as a simple backend DB in Maypole, and various apps we use at work. I'm even considering using it as a configuration file format - but that's one of my more outlandish ideas...</p>



<h2>Cross platform DB</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/grantm/">grantm</a> on 2006-03-14T23:02:50</h3>
<p>I wrote a web app for my wife to use and it needed a DB.  It also needed to run on her Windows machine.  My machine runs Debian (Ubuntu actually) so I was keen to use cross-platform components everywhere.  I did the development and testing on Linux then installed the Apache+Perl+mod_perl+kitchen_sink for Win32 from <a href="http://theoryx5.uwinnipeg.ca/" title="uwinnipeg.ca">Randy Kobes</a uwinnipeg.ca> and the SQLite PPM from his repository on the target Windows machine.  Everything Just Worked&trade; and setting up the database on Windows was a simple as copying one file from Linux.</p>



<h2>Scaling</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Matts/">Matts</a> on 2006-03-15T12:57:09</h3>
I'm using it to solve an interesting database scaling problem. Basically per-user quarantine storage for spam. This doesn't scale too well in a traditional database as you get a single index across one huge table clustered on (userid, column) and that index becomes very very hard to maintain and optimise. By giving every user their own DB I get around this issue, and it's very VERY fast.



<h2>SQLite helps me with house-keeping</h2>
