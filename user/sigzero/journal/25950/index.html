<p><p>When I read posts about people blasting Perl it is usually in two areas. The first area would be "line noise" or a variant thereof. The second would be the bad attitude of Perlytes.</p>

This is what happens when people forget that community and code are more important than opinions and ego. It's OK to disagree with someone, but always only in a polite manner...<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-\<br><br>- Salve

<h2>Storm in a teacup</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/TeeJay/">TeeJay</a> on 2005-07-29T15:30:12</h3>
I think this is (except for a handful of people involved) a storm in a teacup. Within hours we had a new list and a mirror of the wiki. Tony is continuing to develop Class::DBI. If you disregard the gossiping there is no impact on how you use the module.
<br> <br>
Also I believe that exactly because these kind of rows are so uncommon and how quickly friendly mongers come together to solve a problem when it occurs that just the opposite is true - Perl Mongers are (with very few exceptions) easy to get on with and friendly and happy to pull together when needed.
<br> <br>
If you compare this to the bitchfests and fallouts you see in other opensource projects, or worse those that happen behind closed doors within proprietary companies and software developers, this is pretty small (again except for sri and tony, both of whom will get over it in a week or two with any luck).

I agree. I wasn't actually trying to pin the "rightness or wrongness" of it. Just the perception.

Apparently we don't have a mirror of the wiki any more - Tony exercised his rights as copyright holder on much of it (and asserted rights as copyright holder on all of it) and got it taken down:<br><br><a href="http://cdbi-wiki.shadowcatsystems.co.uk/" title="shadowcatsystems.co.uk">http://cdbi-wiki.shadowcatsystems.co.uk/</a shadowcatsystems.co.uk><br><br>I also just read that he's threatened use.perl with legal action due to sri's post here:<br><br><a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/7463" title="oreillynet.com">http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/7463</a oreillynet.com> (about halfway down)
