<p>Does the latest version squelch some of the shortcomings?</p></p>

<h2>It's risen to 40%, not by 40%...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/bart/">bart</a> on 2007-03-22T21:37:16</h3>
As far as I can see, you misunderstood. The article says the number of developers that they asked, that say they use MySQL, has risen <em>to</em> 40%, a increase <em>by</em> 25% from the figure of from 32%, 2 years before. And that's a relative figure, it doesn't take into account how many developers there were and are. So, the effective number of people using MySQL may have risen more, or on the contrary, less, than 25%.

<p>Well, each version of MySQL does squelch some of the shortcomings. The problem is how many of them there are &#8211; squelching them one by one ain&#8217;t gonna make MySQL into a solid product for another decade or two.</p>

<p>I couldn't imagine doing data warehousing without a fully ACID-compliant, multi-mastered, concurrent, high-available clustering, column-locked database.</p>

<p>Yeah, you&#8217;re right, sorry. Things like values being simultaneously NULL and NOT NULL or surrounding spaces implicitly getting trimmed on textual comparisons are essential to effective handling of large amounts of data. And of course everyone needs to scale like eBay before their business leaves their living room.</p>

<p>I can write explicitly-typed Haskell code that can compile down to very fast C code while still being exceptionally safe, but sometimes I write shell scripts.</p>

<p>I could definitely have used writable views in MySQL as far back as 1999, but even after making the tradeoff to do without them, MySQL was still the best choice for that application.</p>

<p>When I need the equivalent of shell scripts in SQL-land, I use SQLite.</p>

<p>(Doesn&#8217;t even do types, while we&#8217;re on that topic. Funny though, its coercion story is sane anyway &#8211; whereas MySQL&#8217;s, despite the presence of types, ain&#8217;t.)</p>

<p>SQLite wasn't an option for that project (and I use it gladly for single-user projects, but not for multi-user projects).</p>

<p>Oddly, MySQL's conversion rules have never ever caused errors in my projects--and I continually have to look up the SQLite syntax for using types.</p>
