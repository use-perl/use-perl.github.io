<p>I use NearlyFreeSpeech to host some sites. I saw that they ran Python side by side using two versions. So I asked the question about running 5.10 along with 5.8.8 and was told FBSD doesn't have it as an official port. <br/><br/>*sigh*</p>

<p>There was just a thread about this on the freebsd-user list:</p><p><a href="http://lists.freebsd.org/pipermail/freebsd-questions/2008-December/189389.html" title="freebsd.org">http://lists.freebsd.org/pipermail/freebsd-questions/2008-December/189389.html</a freebsd.org></p><p>I'm a longtime FreeBSD user and promoter, but it really blows me away that getting 5.10 into Ports wasn't done ages ago, that it isn't a really big priority. This state of affairs does not reflect well on the OS.</p>

<p>I read that thread earlier today.  My favorite post is the one which suggests that it's somehow a failing of Perl that no one has made it work on FreeBSD, as if platform porters magically appeared out of sugarplum dreams, and if p5p were a mystical fairyland which eats garbage and excretes beautiful packages for every platform and operating system anyone might possibly want.</p>

<p>Yeah, I saw that lame a** excuse as well.</p>

<p>Their big problem is that they are scared to upgrade because they are afraid everything will break.  Which suggests to me that they could benefit from some unit tests.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>

<p>Well, from reading a bunch of threads it seems to me that they have pretty much removed the problem that upgrading Perl caused. The lingering fear is there. "Oh, we missed that!"</p>
