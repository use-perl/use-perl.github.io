<p>I will be presenting about A/B testing at OSCON.  Since I'm presenting in the web track, I can't assume that people have Perl.  Besides I've strongly recommended that people create a significance calculator as a web page, so I wanted to demonstrate what that looks like.  So I decided to kill two birds with one stone and write that in JavaScript.<br/><br/>For this purpose I've ported Statistics::Distributions from Perl to JavaScript.  Which is fine and dandy for my purposes, but now I'm wondering whether I can contribute this code to some project somewhere.  With Perl it is easy - everyone knows that CPAN is the place to do things like that.  With JavaScript, what are my options?</p>

<p>The last news update there was Jan 14, 2007.  The last upload listed on the side panel was Sep 28, 2007.  When I click on Contribute I'm taken to <a href="https://master.openjsan.org/jause/index.html" title="openjsan.org">https://master.openjsan.org/jause/index.html</a openjsan.org>, which my browser can't find.</p><p>When I look in Google for it I find that Ingy has something called Jemplate there which has a file dated Nov 2, 2007.  Maybe there is something more recent that hasn't updated.</p><p>But all in all this looks like a dead project to me.</p>

<p>Not only is it dead, it is dead enough that it has almost completed the cycle &#8211; there has been talk about a revival recently.</p>

<p>In fact, there's been CODING on the revival recently.</p><p>Give it a little while, and everything should be running again.</p>

<p>I'll have a port of Statistics::Distributions to put up there.</p><p>It is surprisingly useful to be able to do those calculations in a web page.</p>

<p>We had a bit of a system loss a while ago, and it's been stalled while people wait on me to get things going again.</p><p>Alias and I got some ducks in a row last week and have a clear plan going forward.</p><p>Once I complete a few more small steps towards getting things working, I will make a formal announcement.</p>
