<p>When I send mail boston-pm@pm.org I get:
<pre>
Hi. This is the qmail-send program at la.mx.develooper.com.
I'm afraid I wasn't able to deliver your message to the following addresses.
This is a permanent error; I've given up. Sorry it didn't work out.

&lt;boston-pm@pm.org>:
Sorry, no mailbox here by that name. (#5.1.1)
</pre>
Which sucks since I'm in the Boston area, travelling with my wife and son and intermittent internet access, and final arrangements for a meeting on Jan 19 have yet to be made. :-(<p>

<b>UPDATE:</b> That's just a bounce from a list member, but the list is working fine.  /me feels like an idiot...</p>

<h2>Boston.pm affected by PM.org changes</h2>

Although you diagnosed your own problem, your journal entry title may attract some folks looking for this answer regarding Boston.pm's impact from <a href="http://use.perl.org/articles/04/12/29/1522251.shtml?tid=8&amp;tid=16" title="perl.org">Perl Mongers Hosting Changes</a perl.org>, so I'll put it here:<blockquote><div> <tt>From: Ronald J Kimball<br>Sent: Wednesday, January 05, 2005 10:15 AM<br>To: Boston Perl Mongers Announce<br>Subject: [Boston.pm-announce] [ADMIN] Mailing list / Web site news<br> <br>Below is an email from Dave Cross about changes to the pm.org server, which<br>hosts our mailing lists and web site.&nbsp; I believe these changes have been<br>made or are now in the process of being made.<br> <br>Here is what you need to know right now:<br> <br>The boston-pm at pm.org address is currently invalid.&nbsp; I do not know whether<br>this is a permanent change or just a temporary side effect of the move.<br>LIST POSTS MUST BE SENT TO boston-pm at mail.pm.org instead.<br> <br>Our lovely new Kwiki is now inaccessible.&nbsp; In order to restore it, we will<br>most likely need to find a new host for our website.&nbsp; Suggestions welcome.<br> <br>Ronald<br> <br>From: Dave Cross<br>Subject: [pm_groups] pm.org hosting changes<br> <br>For several years, the pm.org server has been hosted for free by<br>Rackspace and we're very grateful to them for the help they've given us.<br>Unfortunately, that free service will be ending very early next year and<br>the pm.org server will be moving elsewhere.<br> <br>As part of the move we are going to have to scale down the level of<br>service that we provide for Perl Monger local groups. Once the new<br>server is established we will provide the following for free:<br> <br>&nbsp; * Web sites with static content only.<br>&nbsp; * FTP and/or WebDAV access to maintain web sites.<br>&nbsp; * Mailing lists.<br>&nbsp; * DNS<br> <br>The major changes will be that no dynamic content will be allowed and no<br>group leaders will have shell access to the server. We're sorry that we<br>have to put this restrictions in place, but the internet is a very<br>different place to what is was when we set the service up many years<br>ago. If you want to host your site on a less restrictive server that you<br>have more control over then we are, as always, happy to point the DNS<br>records at another server.<br> <br>[snip]<br> <br>Apologies for any inconvenience caused.<br> <br>Dave...<br>_______________________________________________<br>Boston-pm-a nnounce mailing list<br>Boston-pm-announce a t mail.pm.org<br>http://mail.pm.org/mailman/listinfo/boston-pm-announce</tt> </div></blockquote>
