<p>I gave my <a href="http://en.oreilly.com/oscon2008/public/schedule/detail/2605">talk</a>.  I was more than a little dazed while I gave it, but it seemed to go well.  Most of my audience was still there at the end, and they were still alive enough to laugh in the right places.<br/><br/>I won't <i>really</i> know how it went until I get my feedback in a couple of weeks.<br/><br/>Ideally this would be the time when I could sit back and enjoy the conference.  Unfortunately child care responsibilities made me come home after one day so I'll miss it.  However in a short time I saw a lot of familiar faces (eg Schwern, Robert Spiers, Damian, merlyn, etc) and met some interesting people (eg I had lunch with the CTO of Wikipedia).  Plus I enjoyed Damian's talk on scripting vim.  (Tip: Do not let him near your vim configuration anywhere near April 1.  Just..don't.)<br/><br/>For those who are interested, my <a href="http://elem.com/user/btilly/effective-ab-testing/">slides</a> are online.  I still have a couple of edits to make (mainly that I want to put in some of the actual questions I was asked), and it should be posted on the OSCON site some time this week.</p>
