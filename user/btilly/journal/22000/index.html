<p>The diary of <b>S</b>amuel <b>E</b>step <b>T</b>illy, <b>I</b>nfant.  As dictated to dad.<br/><br/><i>5:45 PM, Sat Nov 20:</i> Whaa?  My lovely swimming pool just drained to an alien place!<br/><br/><i>12:05 AM, Sun Nov 21:</i> Geez!  The last few hours have been <b>rough</b>.  And now my head is supposed to go through <b><i>what?</i></b>  Sorry, but my head doesn't do that!<br/><br/><i>2:23 AM, Sun Nov 21:</i> Ow, ow, ow, ow.  I guess my head <b>did</b> do that.  And what is this "air" stuff, don't they know that I have stuff in my lungs already, how am I supposed to breathe?<br/><br/><i>2:30 AM, Sun Nov 21:</i> Whew!  Much better.  The pediatricians have dried me tested me (APGAR 99), weighed me (7 lbs, 14 ounces), forgot to check my length (19 3/4""), and handed me to dad.  They think that I am a normal baby.  If I could talk I'd tell them that I'm a <b>perfect</b> baby!<br/><br/><i>9:00 PM, Sun Nov 21:</i> I think that I've got the hang of this baby thing now.  I've eaten, looked around, slept and pooped.  I think I'll saving peeing for when I can surprise dad.  But I've had a big day that I think I'll remember for life.  I'm exhausted!<br/><br/><i>6:00 PM, Mon Nov 22:</i> My parents finally agreed on a name.  Now they think I'm SET!  Silly parents!  I'm a baby, and I have mommy and daddy.  What else do I need?  But I wish they were a little smarter.  No matter how clearly I explain that a little poop doesn't mean I need a diaper change, daddy does it anyways. :-(<br/><br/><i>3:00 PM, Tues Nov 23:</i> I'm scared!  All of my stuff went away, and now I'm being moved from the only room that I've ever known!  But I get to find out about cars.  I think that cars..zzzz...<br/><br/><i>4:00 PM, Tues Nov 23:</i> *Yawn!*  blink blink.  Hey!  Nothing looks familiar!  But I still see mommy and daddy.  That's good.<br/><br/><i>10:00 AM, Wed Nov 24:</i> My parents sure look tired.  Why are they tired?  <b>I</b> am the one who has had to put up with strange surroundings!  Is it unfamiliar for them?  Why did they take me here?<br/><br/><i>7:00 PM, Wed Nov 24:</i> Daddy's back!  I don't know where he went, but he was gone and now I see him again.  He's got lots of stuff.  I'd figure out what it is but he just put something beneath my bed.  Now I hear the ocean and..zzz...<br/><br/>(to be continued)<br/><br/>Pictorial evidence exists, but uploading it is low priority so may take a while to happen.</p>

APGAR 99? Kids only score that high if one of their parents is a doctor. Oh, wait...

Congratulations!

<p>Congratulations on a safe and healthy homecoming.    I recommend you get a copy of <a href="http://isbn.nu/0761129588/" title="isbn.nu">What to Expect the First Year</a isbn.nu>.  I recommend it to all new parents -- it was a really big help to us.</p>
<p>Now, as to that "Daddy" concept: I hate to tell you, but at this stage in his life, there's no such person.  There are two people in the entire world, "Mom" and "Not-Mom".  Go figure.</p>

I know it's prehaps a bit premature, but if you're looking for  a name <i>(initials, that is)</i> for subsequent sibling to young SET, howzabowt <a href="http://www.acronymfinder.com/af-query.asp?find=Acron&amp;Acronym=hst&amp;String=exact" title="acronymfinder.com">HST</a acronymfinder.com>?
