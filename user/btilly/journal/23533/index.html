<p>I like <a href="http://www.gladwell.com/2004/2004_01_12_a_suv.html">this article</a> on that topic.<p>

For the record, I've rented an SUV before, but I had a pretty good excuse.  I was travelling with my wife and son, and it was the only vehicle that we could rent with rear seats (you can't have babies in the front seat) and enough luggage room. (You try travelling for a month with a baby and see how much luggage you bring!)</p>

<h2>Some truth some stretch</h2>

There's a lot of truth in that article, but it loses marks for focusing mainly on the safety of large american SUVs. Yes, these suck. However some of the european SUVs have very good Euro NCAP ratings for safety.<br> <br>I don't generally like SUVs because of the fuel economy (and subsequent damage to the environment). We drive one because my wife likes them and we're now a one-car family. But there's some FUD in that article.
