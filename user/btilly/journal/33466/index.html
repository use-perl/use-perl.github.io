<p>At $work I'm getting a few basic tools set up.  Since we use PostgreSQL, I'm using DBD::Pg.  With DBD::Oracle I grew to like some of the more flexible ways of entering parameters, so I look for that in DBD::Pg.  I find that there are three options.<br/><br/>1. The DBI standard ?.  If I was happy with that, I wouldn't be reading this documentation.<br/><br/>2. They allow positional parameters with $1, $2, $3.  Given that this is inside of Perl, I'm going to constantly be wondering whether I'm accidentally interpolating in variables.  Better than ? but I don't really like the syntax.  The visual disambiguation from variable interpolation was a reason to prefer DBD::Oracle's :1, :2 and so on.<br/><br/>3. They support full named parameters.  :foo.  :bar.  Yay!  I like it!  But they go on to say, <i>While this syntax is supported by DBD::Pg, its use is highly discouraged.</i><br/><br/>Huh?  Does anyone know why they discourage the cleanest and most flexible solution?  Personally whenever I get the chance to work by name rather than by position, I jump at the opportunity.  But I'm somewhat reluctant to use a feature that the software authors don't want me to use without knowing the reason for that dislike...</p>

<h2>Use them anyway</h2>

I'm using them since they where released a few years ago. Never had any troubles with it - so suggest you just ignore the warning<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)



<h2>... or try a portable alternative</h2>

If DBD::Pg developers don't trust their named placeholders, you've found a reason to try DBIx::Placeholder::Named<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)
