<p>For me the answer will shortly be, "across the continent".  More precisely, from Santa Monica to Philadelphia for a full-day party.<p>

This is for a party with friends that I know through <a href="http://z.iwethey.org/forums/render/board/show?boardid=1">zIWETHEY</a>.  I've been going to this party for a few years.  Given that some of my friends are driving over 12 hours each way, I figured that I can handle 5 hours on the plane each way.<p>

Part of me still has trouble believing that I'm really doing this though.</p>

<h2>Depends on definition of a party</h2>

I went across the country (with no other goal than the destination) for a "party" about eight years ago, but I figured it'd be a good time to meet some important contacts for my business at this "party".  But yeah, it was fly all day, party all night, fly back the next day.  Whee.

<h2>Well, you had an excuse - business</h2>

However I have the advantage that my party will last longer.  I'll be one of a half-dozen people whose trips come in on Friday for the Saturday party.  I leave on Sunday.  Doable.<p>

They are kind of business - this is a group that I'd fall back on for help and advice if I ran into problems.  And they're all in computing somehow.</p>

Ahh, but that's the normal excuse I appease my left-brain (and the IRS) with for every action every day of my small-business-owner life. My right brain knows better!
<p>
I mean, really, could a <a href="http://www.geekcruises.com/" title="geekcruises.com">cruise for something like Oracle developers or dot-net gurus</a geekcruises.com> be seriously considered "business" given my narrow training and consulting focus for my company? Not exactly.  But I still call it "business", even though most of the time I'm sipping on umbrella drinks by the Lido pool.
</p><p>
So yes.  Left brain said this "party" that I crossed country for for one day was "business".  In truth, it was just a party.</p>
