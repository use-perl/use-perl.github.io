<p>I got feedback from 12 people, which I'm guessing is about a quarter of the audience.  I had a number of people who either didn't know what to expect, or found the math a little hard.  The ratings averaged out to 3.67/5.  I have no idea how people tend to rate these things.  I'm guessing that is at the "improvement needed" end of the scale, which is not <i>entirely</i> surprising considering that it was the first talk that I ever did on this scale.  However I'd have liked to do better than that.<br/><br/>Does anyone have any idea how I should be scaling my expectations?</p>

<p>The average rating was 3.96.  Apparently nobody got a truly stellar rating.</p><p>So I clearly have some room for improvement.  But not a bad starting point given my material, the length, and my lack of experience speaking.</p><p>I can't say I'm really happy with that result, but I'm not overly depressed over it either.</p>

<p>At the very least, you got feedback.  I never found out anything about my "Logic Programming in Perl" talk.  I suspect it wouldn't have been too terribly good as I'm hardly a Damian or Dominus and it was a rather esoteric topic.</p>

<p>Don't worry about the comments too much. You'll do better next time.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p><p>The harshest comments come from people who have odd expectations that are totally beyond your control. A few people didn't like my Mastering Perl tutorial because it covered the same topics as the book. I'm not sure why they think I would leave stuff out of the book, or why a class of the same title as the book given by the author of the book would be that different.</p><p>Note the you should see two numbers in your evaluation: one for your talk and one for you as a speaker. They might hate your talk but like you as a speaker.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<p>Huh.  People on average thought exactly the same of the presentation and of me.  But different people thought differently of me and the presentation.</p>

<p>4.4 here, which I'm told is pretty good.</p><p>Only the damianesk keynotes get the really high scores though.</p><p>Comments, on the other hand, weren't very useful, as they didn't really add anything.</p>
