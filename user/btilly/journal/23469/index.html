<div class="span8">
<p>Metcalfe's Law is the claim that the value of a network scales as the square of the number of people in that network.  I believe this to be a grotesque overestimate, and a couple of years ago came up with a heuristic argument that not only was it an overestimate, but <tt>n log(n)</tt> was a much more reasonable estimate.<br/><br/>I wound up sending that as a brief note to <a href="http://www.dtc.umn.edu/user/odlyzko/">Andrew Odlyzko</a>, a fairly well-known researcher who discusses (among other things) the economics of networks.  (<a href="http://firstmonday.org/issues/issue6_2/odlyzko/">Content is Not King</a> and <a href="http://firstmonday.org/issues/issue8_9/odlyzko/index.html">The many paradoxes of broadband</a> are two of his papers relating to networks.)<br/><br/>We had a brief discussion and I forgot all about it.  Until he came back to me recently with the argument expanded out, and a few other arguments added in coming up with the same estimate.  And then he asked me if I wanted to be a co-author with him!  Rather generous, considering that he's well-known and he did all of the work...<br/><br/>If anyone is interested, here is <a href="http://www.dtc.umn.edu/user/odlyzko/doc/metcalfe.pdf">the result</a>.  Constructive feedback would be appreciated if anyone has some.</p>

You've <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/03/15/1820230&amp;tid=95" title="slashdot.org">made it to slashdot</a slashdot.org> on this!

Somehow I missed this when first posted here and on Slash-Dot, but stumbled on it looking for something else here. This is suddently timely with the Cogent/Level-3 peering smackdown.
An additional set of datapoints would be the Judge Gree break-up of Ma Bell and the inexorable re-integration of the Baby Bells with either each other or the "non-incumbent" erstwhile competitors. I'd be interested if you or your co-author have taken this further.
