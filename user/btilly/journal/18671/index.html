<p>...and I've proven to be unable to keep a daily journal.<br/><br/>Anyways I have a nephew coming to LA for E3.  I'm looking for ideas on how to entertain him.  Visiting his godmother seems likely.  There is a <a href="http://recfair.com/socal/">Renaissance Faire</a> to go to.  And  I have a cousin with a small plane who might be enticed into taking my nephew for a flight.  Can anyone think of anything else I should suggest for him?<br/><br/>I only need to entertain him Friday night and Saturday.  He will be at E3 until Friday, and he flies back early Sunday.</p>

You're in West LA, right?  Depending on what you or he might find entertaining, there's <a href="http://www.getty.edu/museum/" title="getty.edu">The Getty</a getty.edu> or <a href="http://www.santamonicapier.org/" title="santamonicapier.org">The Santa Monica Pier</a santamonicapier.org>.

Myself, when I'm in that general area, I find <a href="http://www.mccabes.com/" title="mccabes.com">McCabe's Guitar Shop</a mccabes.com> entertaining.

Next time I go there, I'll have to ask <a href="http://www.mccabes.com/mystery3.html" title="mccabes.com">about this</a mccabes.com><nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

Actually Santa Monica, but that is close enough.<br> <br><br/><br/>I hadn't thought about The Getty.  I'll run it by him, but I think that his mom would have more interest in his going there than he has in going.  As for the pier, I've been there and I'm not sure what the appeal is supposed to be, so I wouldn't be the best guide.

<p>A lot depends on his age.  He might enjoy just hanging out at the Santa Monica pier, or Venice beach.  If he's little, he'll like the carousel; if he's a teenager, he might like seeing the guitar man at Venice.  If he's older, and the weather's nice, there'll be lots of bikinis at the beach.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)</p>
<p>For me, visiting family usually means a gourmet tour: either Dim Sum at Monterey Park (my favor is <a href="http://harborvillage.com/" title="harborvillage.com">Harbor Village</a harborvillage.com>), or <a href="http://in-n-out.com/" title="in-n-out.com">In-n-Out burgers</a in-n-out.com>, depending on their mood.</p>
<p>If he likes the outdoors, go up to Topanga Canyon for a hike, and stop for lunch or dinner at the <a href="http://innoftheseventhray.com/" title="innoftheseventhray.com">Inn of the Seventh Ray</a innoftheseventhray.com>.  It's probably too late for the wildflowers in Lancaster, though.</p>
<p>If worse comes to worst, just grab a guidebook and pretend you're a tourist, too!</p>

He's 18.  I'll suggest the hike, and if he is not interested, keep note of those places as somewhere for me to try.  I'll avoid suggesting any burger places though as I'm not a big fan of burgers.  (No matter how good in-n-out is supposed to be.)
