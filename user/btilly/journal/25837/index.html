<p>I was asked if I was interested a couple of months ago, but it wasn't until yesterday that approval came through for the company to pay for it.  Of course then I had to OK it with my wife (because she's working and it will leave her with extra child care she wasn't prepared for).  That's OK as well, so I'm going!<br/><br/>So I bought my airline ticket, then tried to buy a conference ticket.  Wrong order.  O'Reilly can't process my order. :-(  I sent them an email, got no reply.  So I waited a while, tried again from the same form and got no confirmation page.  My credit card didn't show a charge, so I figured that there was a timeout on their end.  I tried from the start again, got to the end and again they can't process my order.<br/><br/>So right now I'm flying to Portland at the same time as a conference that I can't purchase a registration at.  Wonderful.<br/><br/>In other news, my employer is looking for another developer.  If you're good at Perl and are interested in working for Rent.com (a subsidiary of eBay) in Santa Monica, I can put you in touch with my boss.</p>

<h2>Problem solved</h2>

My credit card had a hold put on it because of unusual activity.<br><br>Well, I admit that I don't often fly in the middle of the week and then sign up for a conference, but it was legit.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br><br>All straightened out now.<br><br>Cheers,<br>Ben
