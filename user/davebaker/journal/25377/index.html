<p>Tonight I got into Toronto for my first trip to Canada and my first Perl conference ... wow. Big town, big hotel.

<p>While trying to get money out of the strange cash machine in the lobby of this residential dorm (the old Metropolitan Hotel), I met Mark Stosberg, who currently maintains CGI::Application. It was so much fun to be able to talk to him about it at dinner, and his Cascade application. He's very pleased with the new plug-in capabilities that have been built into version 4 of CGI::Application and with the plug-ins that have been written for it already.

<p>I think I passed Larry Wall in the hall. He's speaking tomorrow at 9:30 a.m.

<p>The high-speed Internet access in the rooms works very well. Costs an extra $5 per day, but on top of the already cheap room rate it's quite a deal.

<p>People have been friendly; there's a certain twinkle in their eye when they realize you're here for the Perl conference, too-- "Hey, another geek like me!"

<p>A Canadian fellow came all the way from the Yukon Territory. I believe I passed Autrijus Tang (sp?) on the street; I think he flew in from China.

<p>Really looking forward to the sessions tomorrow!</p>
