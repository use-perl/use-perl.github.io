<p>Yikes; I am having trouble getting an RSS feed for all new journal entries (not comments to entries, just new entries posted by anybody: the list that shows up at <a href="http://use.perl.org/search.pl?op=journals">http://use.perl.org/search.pl?op=journals</a>).

<p>The FAQ at <a href="http://use.perl.org/faq.shtml">http://use.perl.org/faq.shtml</a> tells me to use <a href="http://use.perl.org/journal.pl?op=top&content_type=rss ">http://use.perl.org/journal.pl?op=top&content_type=rss </a>; I subscribed to that via BlogLines but BlogLines isn't feeding me any entries, and when I tell BlogLines to give me the entries for the last 72 hours (etc.) I don't get any entries either. I wonder if that URL is correct on the FAQ page.

<p>I searched use.perl.org's journal entries and found this excellent RSS feed described by jbisbee at <a href="http://use.perl.org/comments.pl?sid=23628&cid=36097">http://use.perl.org/comments.pl?sid=23628&cid=36097</a>:
 <a href="http://use.perl.org/search.pl?tid=&query=&author=&op=journals&content_type=rss">http://use.perl.org/search.pl?tid=&query=&author=&op=journals&content_type=rss</a> -- it is working well for me now using BlogLines.

<p>[Update] The URL can be simplified and still works well for me using BlogLines: <a href="http://use.perl.org/search.pl?op=journals&content_type=rss">http://use.perl.org/search.pl?op=journals&content_type=rss</a>

<p>Which appears to work OK.  I haven't figured out how get a comments feed yet.</p>

Very nice! Thanks.

<p>I think I prefer the feed with new journal entries only, but the feed you've described for getting all comments (new journal entries and replies to them) is great to know about.

</p><p>I have determined that the reason the journal feed described in the FAQ -- <a href="http://use.perl.org/journal.pl?op=top&amp;content_type=rss" title="perl.org">http://use.perl.org/journal.pl?op=top&amp;content_type=rss</a perl.org>, which is described as "most recent journal users" -- hasn't been working in Bloglines for me is that the resulting RSS feed is the "Top 20" journal entries (that's the title showing up in Bloglines). I don't know what "top" means, but the feed does have 20 entries. The most recent entry was on March 1, so that's why I was seeing no entries when I subscribed and then asked BlogLines to show me entries from the last 72 hours.

</p><p>Do you know what the criteria are for "Top 20"? I can't find it in the FAQ.</p>

<p>If I click that in Firefox it shows up-to-date data. However, the feed is really useless: instead of showing posts, it shows the 20 <em>journals</em> that were <em>most recently posted to</em> (but it uses the title of the latest post on each journal as the title of the feed item).</p>

<p>It&#8217;s quite possible that Bloglines thinks that because it has seen these items before (albeit with different titles), they must be old and that the feed is not being updated.</p>

<p>Anyway, the <code>search.pl</code>-based feeds work sanely.</p>

That's it!

<p>The URL in the FAQ is generating a list of URLs of the journals themselves -- e.g. <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/uri/journal/?from=rss" title="perl.org">http://use.perl.org/user/uri/journal/?from=rss</a perl.org> is the URL for a recent entry in Uri Guttman's journal -- so the BlogLines feed reader and probably others ignore new journal entries if they've seen a previous journal entry by that particular user.

</p><p>That must be the reason why I was seeing no results at all when asking BlogLines for entries from the past 72 hours... when I went to BlogLines and expanded the time frame to 30 days, entries appeared. In the past 72 hours there had been no journal entries by a user whose journal URL BlogLines (not just me) had never seen before. (I guess BlogLines already had been monitoring the RSS feed and had been keeping track of already-seen user URLs before I came along.)

</p><p>Really appreciate your detective work. I love it when I figure out why something is happening the way it is. A friend of mine once counseled me not to take bugs in programming personally or subconsciously get mad with the computer for being difficult, by telling me "There's always a reason."</p>

<p>Oh btw, the feed I linked contains <em>only</em> comments (without content). You need the feed Domm linked for the <em>posts</em> (and it includes fulltext content).</p>
