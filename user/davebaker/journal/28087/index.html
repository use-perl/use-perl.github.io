<p>I was pleased to be able to write a neat little program (actually, about 5 megs due to the size of the data file that's appended to the end of the script) for my son, as a Christmas present.<br/><br/>He likes to listen to late-night AM radio, trying to find long-distance stations ("DX") whose signals are bouncing off the ionosphere to reach us here in western North Carolina.<br/><br/>The script was added to the "Code" section of perlmonks.org this afternoon.</p>

Ah, damned Perl Monks. If there is a more confusing site to navigate, I'd hate to see it. Looks like the administrators took the code offline; I was able to view it and copy it once.<br><br>I'll email it to you -- thanks,<br><br>Dave Baker

I have pasted the code into Perl Monks a second time, but without the data. Maybe the Perl Monks took the code offline because the data were so large (about 5 megs).<br><br>Also included in the supplemental posting I just made at Perl Monks is the URL of the FCC web site where you go to get the AM radio station data. Once you have the data, just copy it and paste it immediately after the __END__ line in the script (its last line).<br><br>

Yeah, there's a limit for code block sizes to about 64k. No wonder you can't get it all in.

Have you ever used PAR?<br><br>Wow, Autrijus Tang does wonderful work.<br><br>I was able to make self-standing executables (without the need for the end user to have Perl installed on his machine) in both Linux and Windows environments.<br><br>I wasn't able to make it work with a __END__ data section in the script, so I needed to split the data into a separate file and then read the data in the script using the standard open, flock, while $line= procedure.<br><br>Have you ever been able to make PAR work with an __END__ data section?

<h2>Cool</h2>

Nice to see someone else using Perl for Radio. I'm using Perl for VHF propagation prediction<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... similar DX experiene, but on a much shorter wavelength.
