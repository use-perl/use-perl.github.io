<div class="span8">
<p><p>One of the things you&#39;ll see in the changelog for the next stable release of Catalyst, is a reworked component resolution system. By &quot;component resolution&quot; i mean, fetching components from view()/views(), model()/models(), controller()/controllers() and component().</p><p>Back in May I posted <a href="http://lists.scsys.co.uk/pipermail/catalyst-dev/2008-May/001225.html">a message to the Catalyst-dev list</a> describing some issues with the way it was currently working. Although I painted a slightly convoluted picture of doom and gloom -- it turns out that all is not lost; you were probably relying on an &quot;undefined&quot; behavior to begin with (kind of like assuming &quot;keys %hash&quot; will return things in a particular order).</p><p>For example, consider &quot;MyApp&quot; with two views: &quot;Foo&quot; and &quot;Bar.&quot; Now, when you call &quot;$c-&gt;view()&quot; (i.e. with no arguments) what gets returned? Well, it depends. :) If you have none of the appropriate config (default_view) or stash variables (current_view, current_view_instance) set, then it&#39;s pretty much random.</p><p>If you write a test for the above, and see that &quot;MyApp::View::Bar&quot; is returned -- don&#39;t count on that test working in 5.7100 (the message I posted to the list has the technical details as to why). Though the test *may* continue to work, the above scenario will throw a pretty large warning:</p><blockquote><p><br />Calling $c-&gt;view() will return a random view unless you specify one of:<br />* $c-&gt;config-&gt;{default_view} # the name of the default view to use<br />* $c-&gt;stash-&gt;{current_view} # the name of the view to use for this request<br />* $c-&gt;stash-&gt;{current_view_instance} # the instance of the view to use for this request<br />NB: in version 5.80, the &quot;random&quot; behavior will not work at all.<br /></p></blockquote><p></p><p>(FYI, if your application only has one view, calling &quot;$c-&gt;view()&quot; is considered &quot;acceptable&quot; and will spare you the warnings.)</p><p>A similar warning is thrown for $c-&gt;model(). $c-&gt;controller() with no arguments will continue to return the controller for the dispatched action. $c-&gt;component (sans args) will also stay the same, returning a sorted list of all component names.</p><p>Another issue I discovered while re-working the code was a failed reliance on the &quot;regex&quot; fallback.</p><p>Consider another &quot;MyApp&quot; with two views &quot;Foo::Bar&quot; and &quot;Foo::Baz&quot;. What does &quot;$c-&gt;view(&#39;Foo&#39;)&quot; return? We&#39;ve maintained backwards compatibility on this one -- it will return all matching views (order unknown). It is important to note that this returns an array, so list context is important. We&#39;ve added a warning for this scenario as well:</p><blockquote><p><br />Relying on the regexp fallback behavior for component resolution is unreliable and unsafe.<br />If you really want to search, pass in a regexp as the argument.<br /></p></blockquote><p></p><p>As noted above, if you truly were just searching for views, pass it a regex (&quot;$c-&gt;view(qr{Foo})&quot;) and it will act as expected.</p><p>So, if you think you might be affected by these particular issues, <a href="http://bricas.vox.com/library/post/please-test-catalystruntime-57100-rc1-aka-57099_02.html">test out the dev release</a>! Don&#39;t say I didn&#39;t warn you. :)</p>

<h2>Great!</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ChrisDolan/">ChrisDolan</a> on 2008-07-18T00:58:27</h3>
<p>This is great news.  I was bitten by the regex fallback a year ago when I had a typo in my model name and Catalyst picked a related model instead.  The two models were similar enough that I didn't notice for quite a while.</p>



<h2>Oh, man</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ChrisDolan/">ChrisDolan</a> on 2008-07-18T02:31:30</h3>
<p>Oops, I tested this and found four accidental violations in my code: 3 x $c-&gt;view() and one case of model('DB::session') where I meant model('DB::sessions')</p><p>Please, could you add the $name to the warning message?  I had to fire up the debugger to figure out which model was causing the actual warning in my code.</p><p>Otherwise, I'm getting a perfect success with my biggest app using SVN rev 8135 in <a href="http://dev.catalyst.perl.org/repos/Catalyst/Catalyst-Runtime/5.70/trunk" title="perl.org">http://dev.catalyst.perl.org/repos/Catalyst/Catalyst-Runtime/5.70/trunk</a perl.org> (aka 5.7099_02)</p>

<p>SVN revision 8138 adds a new line about the value supplied. 5.70/trunk also has a couple more fixes for regexp fallback and ACCEPT_CONTEXT from component().</p><p>Thanks a lot for testing this out!</p>
