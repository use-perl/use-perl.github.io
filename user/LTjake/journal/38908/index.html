<p><p>Holy -- this weekly thing goes by way too fast!</p><p>Anyway, as promised, I&#39;m making my first QA tool post. This week, we&#39;re chatting about <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Perl-Critic">Perl::Critic</a>.</p><p>Perl::Critic has been around since late 2005. I was able to resist its icy gaze until last fall. So, why wouldn&#39;t I want to jump right in with Perl::Critic early on? Mostly what I imagined was putting a significant amount of time in to bend Perl::Critic policies to my will so I wouldn&#39;t have to change how I code. This is, of course, the wrong way to look at it.</p><p>There&#39;s nothing wrong with having a tool that confirms you&#39;re doing the right thing -- but what I really wanted was a tool that showed me the bad habits I&#39;ve learned and gave me a slap on the wrist every time I tried to use them. The easiest way to get started was to copy someone else&#39;s polcy file. RJBS was nice enough to comply.</p><p>For the Image::TextMode project, after adding my own tweaks to the policies, <a href="http://github.com/bricas/image-textmode/blob/0889b780fb657359c3494dbc85c200d8434b6e90/xt/perlcriticrc">this is the result</a>. A simple <a href="http://github.com/bricas/image-textmode/blob/0889b780fb657359c3494dbc85c200d8434b6e90/xt/author/critic.t">automated test</a> integrates it into my development cycle.</p><p>After running it against my code, it found some issues -- most of my which were pretty tame: 2-arg open, lack of pod, plus a few regex and character matching niggles.</p><p>In my policy file, I have two sections: Things I don&#39;t agree with and things I&#39;ve had to disable temporarily. I hope to eventually go back and clean up my code so I can remove the remainder of the temporarily disabled policies. The policies I don&#39;t agree with may change over time, but this is my current list of preferences.</p><p>I have yet to use this setup in any other project, but I think the tool is useful enough that I could put it into place from the very beginning of a project or go back and run it against all of my old projects over time.</p><p>Until next time...</p><p><br /></p>
