<p><p>I had been running <a href="http://www.trustix.net/">Trustix</a> 1.8 (well, some sort of 2.0 pre-release...) on my old home machine as a home web/cvs/test server. 3 months ago i upgraded to 2.0 Beta 1, and just this past weekend to the most recent 2.0 Final (Jul 18) [<a href="http://www.trustix.net/pub/Trustix/releases/trustix-2.0/ISO/">ISO</a>].</p>
<p>There was a bug in <a href="http://www.trustix.org/cgi-bin/wiki.cgi?BugsInAnaconda">anaconda</a> when trying to install my network config w/o specifying a gateway. I put in some faux information and re-configured the network device after the installation finished.</p>
<p>No servers are enabled by default, so I immediately enabled sshd, httpd and xinetd. After adding my user to the root group (so i can su to root while in an ssh session), i removed the monitor and keyboard from the box.</p>
<p>There's a <a href="http://www.cvshome.org/">cvs</a> rpm in the <a href="http://snow.trustix.org/contrib/rpms/">contrib area</a> which has worked well for me. I love being able to just tar up my cvsroot directory and seamlessly unarchive it to the new system. I forgot to copy over my cvspserver file for xinetd, but that wasn't too hard to re-do. I guess i should really be using some ssh tunneling or something...</p>
<p>I had tried unsuccessfully to install <a href="http://www.boutell.com/gd">GD</a> on a previous system via an RPM -- too many dependencies. Compiling from scratch was a snap (<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/CGI-Application-PhotoGallery/">CGI::Application::PhotoGallery</a> runs - no sweat). There's an odd problem when installing modules using the CPAN shell -- it doesn't give them enough permissions to let regular users "use" them. I can manually fix that -- but that can be a pain.</p>
<p>I'm kind of fond of pico as an editor (*gasp* :), so i grabbed the pine source, compiled it (... 45 minutes pass ...) and copied the pico binary out. I can manage with vi but I'm not 100% comfortable with it.</p>
<p>I'm going to setup a dev area for a <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/CGI-Application/">CGI::Application</a>/<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/GEDCOM/">GEDCOM</a> based family history webapp that i started this weekend. Our current family history site runs on "IGMMak Version 3.0" (1996), which is a sweet app, but isn't very pretty and lacks a few features my father and uncle (who run the site) are wanting. Hopefully, I'll be sharing more on that project here soon.</p></p>
