<p>First, I had to throttle back on the cpan-smoking. I had limited it to 10 packages per hour, but even that was killing my system (750 MHz Athlon running <a href="http://www.trustix.org/">Trustix</a> 2.0). So it's at 1 package/hr for now. For some reason it doesn't seem to be sending a report for every tested package -- I haven't attempted to debug that yet.</p>
<p>Also, another ASP gripe is with its if statement handling. Take the following example code:</p>
<p><code>
if not rs.eof and rs( "field" ) &lt;&gt; "value" then<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; response.write ","<br />
end if
</code></p>
<p>Where <code>rs</code> is a recordset object.</p>
<p>This code will ALWAYS cause an exception to occur because when a recordset reaches "EOF" you cannot retrieve any values from it. Thus it has to be written as:</p>
<p><code>
if not rs.eof then<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; if rs( "field" ) &lt;&gt; "value" then<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; response.write ","<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; end if<br />
end if
</code></p>
<p>Argh.</p></p>

<h2>And the VB guys don't care</h2>

Yeah, I hit that crappy VBScript/VB bug back in 97.  I happened to be at MS's TechEd in 2000 and had the dubious honor of being able to ask questions of the VB dev team.  I asked them about this stupidity and why they didn't do something about it.  Their response was that they didn't want to mess up existing code.<br>
<br>
I asked, well then, why didn't you just add a compiler directive for people who'd like to have a programming language that did what a logical mind would expect -- like the pcode/native code compilation option?  They declined to respond to that one.<br>
<br>
Little did I know that they were about to announce<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.NET, in which in typical MS fashion they would toss VB in the trash in favor of the new technology du jour.  They didn't answer because they didn't care.
