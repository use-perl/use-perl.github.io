<p><p>I have some <a href="http://www.alternation.net/">web space</a>. I want to put up a wiki. I don't have telnet access. <a href="http://search.cpan.org/src/KAKE/CGI-Wiki-0.28/">CGI::Wiki</a> looks great, but can i get it to work without having telnet access? I guess I'll have to try it.</p>

If you want, I'll let you host your Wiki on my server.
<p>
Another thought, being that your a perlmonk, you could talk to jcwren and get an account on the perlmonk user server.  They are nice about getting modules for ya, and you would have the benefit of another platform to test on.  Other benefits are; you.perlmonk.org, and you@perlmonk.org.  See jcwren's homenode on perlmonks, catch him on irc, or<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/msg him. Also be sure to wish him a belated birthday.</p>

<p>Hey! Thanks for the offer.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I'm paying ~$240/year for my hosting, so i'm going to try to use it. I haven't done squat with it in about 8 months - it really sucks to be pissing away that money.</p>
<p>I've thought about talking to jcwren, but haven't gotten around to it. I'll keep that in mind and let you know what i do.</p>
<p>Thanks again, mate.</p>

$240/year with no telnet access?  Do you have one of those Web Based control panel things?  Not even SSH access??  Seems to me that you need to look into some other options, bro.  Are you in a contract?  If I were you, maybe ask someone if you can get some kind of remote access, or check out another company.

<p>Right, well, I've paid for a year, so until next February, i'll just stick it out. I guess the only advantage i have over the pair plan is 600MB of space, and unlimited bandwidth. I have one of those web based panels, but you can't do much with it.</p>
<p>Looks like i'll make the switch to pair next year. Thanks for the advice! =)</p>
