<div class="span8">
<p><p>After <a href="http://www.diveintomark.org/">Mark</a>'s <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2003/07/21/atom_aggregator_behavior_transport_level.html">post</a> yesterday on how atom aggregators should handle http response codes, I decided to bring our (currently in-house-only) RSS aggregator up to speed. I think it's safe to assume that both RSS and atom aggregators should handle HTTP in the same manner.</p>
<p>The structure of the aggregator is a little weird because it's a server-based "what's new?" type app and not a desktop/personal news reader.</p>
<p>There are two main parts to the app that read a feed.</p>
<ol>
<li>the update_cache.pl script (scheduled to run every couple of hours)</li>
<li>the actual web app which reads only from the cache</li>
</ol>
<p>So, i really only had to deal with the update_cache.pl script since it's the only part that actually deals with external sites.</p>
<p>I was able to check off a few of the <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2003/07/21/atom_aggregator_behavior_transport_level.html">requirements</a> off right away.</p>
<ul>
<li>It already handled Etags and Last-Modified dates (even though it's in-house only right now, we want it to play nice with externals servers when the time comes)</li>
<li>Referer and User-Agent were set appropriately.</li>
<li>https is supported (simply by installing <a href="http://search.cpan.org/author/CHAMAS/Crypt-SSLeay-0.51/">Crypt::SSLeay</a>)</li>
<li>A requirement not on the list, but important to note is that it supports the file:// protocol so all local feeds can be read straight off the file system (it also returns a Last-Modified date! <a href="http://search.cpan.org/author/GAAS/libwww-perl-5.69/">LWP</a> rocks!)</li>
</ul>
<p>Adding gzip and deflate support was a snap -- along with sending the right header with my request</p>
<code>$request->header( Accept_encoding   => 'gzip; deflate' );</code>
<p>handling the returned data was too easy:</p>
<code>
if ( my $encoding = $response->header( 'Content-Encoding' ) ) {<br />
 &nbsp; &nbsp;require Compress::Zlib;<br /><br />
 &nbsp; &nbsp;$data = Compress::Zlib::memGunzip( $data )  if $encoding =~ /gzip/i;<br />
 &nbsp; &nbsp;$data = Compress::Zlib::uncompress( $data ) if $encoding =~ /deflate/i;<br />
}
</code>
<p>LWP was handling redirects automatically which was alright except that there needs to be a distinction between temporary redirects (300, 302, 307) and permanent ones (301). I had to add in a loop and use <code>simple_request()</code> so i could see what was returned after each request. After a permanent redirect, the URL will be permanently updated in the config file (temp redirects will not affect the config).</p>
<p>Speaking of redirects, code 304 Not modified is listed under <code>is_redirect()</code> -- which is a little misleading (but true to the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html">specs</a>).</p>
<p>I didn't make any special rules for any codes that fall under <code>is_error()</code>. It currently only reports that an error occurred -- I haven't decided how much of Mark's recommendation I want to follow for this app.</p>
<p>Other than that, I still need to look at authentication -- basic auth. is handled in the URL only, but that poses a security risk since i use URL as a key, stored in a user-cookie for customization purposes -- and proxy support.</p>
<p>Mark put up some <a href="http://diveintomark.org/tests/client/http/">tests</a> today. Sadly there are only atom based feeds so, i can't try to parse the data, but the status codes that they return seem useful.</p></p>
