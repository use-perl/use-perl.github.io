I'm sure it's nice, and perhaps to people who use feed readers, the location of another feed doesn't matter much.<br/><br/>I'm a "tech" person, but I have repeatedly tried and given up on feed readers....I just don't want another information stream to feel like I need to get "caught up" on.<br/><br/>I like reading the journals at use.perl because there are several of them, and there is usually something new and interesting being posted.<br/><br/>So, I'm in the camp that would read your stuff if it was cross-posted back here.<br/><br/>Enjoy the new service!<br/><br/>   Mark

I've decided to start cross-posting my perl-related entries. Basically, use.perl is a subject-specific place, and I don't want to be left out.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br><br>I do wish that I could read use.perl in a more planet-like manner, though. Of course, I could set up my own planet installation...<br><br>Thanks for your reply!

<p>Add <a href="http://use.perl.org/search.pl?op=journals;content_type=atom" title="perl.org">http://use.perl.org/search.pl?op=journals;content_type=atom</a perl.org> to your feed reader &#8211; there&#8217;s your planet. There&#8217;s even an equivalent feed for all comments, but it doesn&#8217;t have the text of the comments.</p>

Unfortunately, if your posts don't appear on the use.perl recent journal entries list, I'm never going to see any of your posts.<br><br>Sigh... another community member lost to the great "out there".

You could just mark every user as "friend"<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)...I guess the moral to the story is that if certain sites want to keep their userbase then occasional site upgrades are warranted.  I notice that at Vox one can enter hyperlinks with a button click and a paste; unlike some sites where you still have to hand enter html markup.

<h2>Me too.</h2>

I also have been <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/stu42j/journal/32986" title="perl.org">trying out</a perl.org> Vox for <a href="http://stu42j.vox.com/" title="vox.com">personal blogging</a vox.com>.  It has some nifty features but I'm finding some things I don't like and may not be able to get over:<br><br><ol><li>Bad password security</li><li>No post preview feels weird</li><li>Anonymous comments not allowed</li></ol><br><br>Preview is on their todo list as is OpenId support but I get the feeling they consider no anonymous comments to be a feature.

Not having a preview button bugs me too -- I'm glad they're adding it!

<p>Anonymous comments are disallowed on use.perl as well. If they weren&#8217;t I would probably not have gotten an account here.</p>
