<div class="span8">
<p><p>I've just finished writing a little <a href="http://cpanratings.perl.org/d/Email-Store">"review" of Email::Store</a>. I'd like to elaborate slightly on my usage of said module.</p>
<p>Various groups that use our machines have mailing lists. Up until recently no one has ever asked for a browse-able archive of list messages. The higher ups agreed that this would be a good idea as it would also allow our public lists to be archived and searched on the web.</p>
<p>We're always looking for something that gives us fine control over most aspects of display/functionality -- So, in my infinite wisdom, I decided that Email::Store might be worth a shot.</p>
<p>I had originally gone with an SQLite DB backend only for convenience sake. Email::Store sets up all the necessary tables once you issue a <code>Email::Store->setup</code> command. I then created a little script that slurped and fed a few hundred messages to <code>Email::Store::Mail->store</code>. SQLite didn't seem to be holding up too well, so i switched to MySQL and things were speedy once again.</p>
<p>Having a decent test bed of message, I then put on my web app hat and wrote a bit of CGI::Application and TT2 to display a list a new messages, their message bodies, their related threading and such. After only a day's work, I had a good enough mockup to show my boss who was pleased and urged me to continue.</p>
<p>I really wanted to add some monthly statistics (messages/month). After some talking with <a href="http://simon-cozens.org/">Simon</a>, he helped me to work through my first plugin for Email::Store -- Email::Store::Mail::DateParts. It simply breaks down a message's date (stored as an epoch based integer normally) into its day, month and year parts. It also allows you to get the number of message in a particular month (as well as a listing of those message), or a break-down of each month of a given year. It's only about 150 lines long, of which at least 25% is SQL!</p>
<p>Over the course of the week I had added a few things like attachment downloading, quoted message coloring, highlighted urls (mostly stolen from Simon's <a href="http://buscador-dev.simon-cozens.org/">Buscador code</a>.</p>
<p>I've picked away at it a few times since then, tweaking a few bits of it here and there. It's nearly ready to "launch" -- another success story for perl (in a mostly ASP based organization of all places :).</p></p>

<h2>Sounds cool! Hope you can share the code</h2>

I'd love to implement your solution; hope you can share the code.<br/><br/>Thanks!



<h2>Any place on the Web where we can see the project?</h2>

Hello! I wonder if you were able to place your project on a publicly accessible Web site. Would sure love to see it in action.
