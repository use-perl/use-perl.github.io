<p><p>Right around the time that people were (most recently) bitching about RSS, I had a meeting in regards to a new project where in the client wants to be able to send out a sort of "broadcast message" when they have a new document available for the public to consume.</p>
<p>The first thing that came to mind was that you're not going to "broadcast" anything unless the person you're sending the message to really wants this information (i.e. I'm not designing some sort of spam system!).</p>
<p>Secondly, besides having a plain old opt-in list, RSS might be of some use.</p>
<p>Basically, I'd be creating an RSS feed, and along with having our own web site parse and display the feed, it would allow any one else with an aggregator to use it. Bonus. I'd also have to come up with some sort of way to allow other people to (easily) include the feed on their website (javascript..?).</p>
<p>RSS gives us some extra opportunities with little (our feed on other sites) or no (users' aggregators) extra work. Is this a real world solution, or am I dreaming?</p></p>

Sounds like a great idea to me. Implementing a bit of javascript that they could drop in their page would be a good way of doing this. I know I remember seeing javascript parsing RSS in some webpages before. After poking around for a bit I could only find two javascript libraries for parsing XML/RDF
<a href="http://jibbering.com/rdf-parser/index.html" title="jibbering.com">jibbering's javascript rdf parser</a jibbering.com> and
<a href="http://xmlhack.com/read.php?item=414&amp;v=1" title="xmlhack.com">MinXML</a xmlhack.com>. There's probably something tuned exactly to RSS out there somewhere.

<p>I think, rather than having the javascript parse the RDF, that it might be easier to just use javascript as another syndication method.</p>
<p>Palminfocenter.com (<a href="http://www.palminfocenter.com/view_story.asp?ID=5199" title="palminfocenter.com">link</a palminfocenter.com>) has a javascript link you can add to your site. It's just a bunch of <code>document.write</code> statements. Which would be no problem to do when I'm generating the actual RSS feed as well.</p>
<p>It's not as exciting, but it would work.</p>

Oh yeah, that's much simpler, and less error prone than parsing RDF in Javascript. Good thought!
