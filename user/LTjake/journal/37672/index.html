<p><p>Recently, two CPAN releases have brought a certain amount of nostalgia to my mind&#39;s eye.</p><p>Andy Armstrong contacted me a number of months ago in relation to my <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Games-NES-Emulator/">6502 CPU</a> work.&#160; Mostly he was disappointed in the lack of a test suite. I felt much the same way, and had really wanted a test suite for the next release. After numerous hours of searching, I stumbled upon the <a href="http://monkeycoder.com/monkeynes/">MoneyNES project</a>.</p><p>That particular project has a set of scripts to test all (well, not quite all) of the ops and basic memory functions available to 6502 processors. I was able to write a <a href="http://search.cpan.org/src/ANDYA/Acme-6502-0.73/t/monkeynes.t">simple parser</a> to bind Acme::6502 to the test scripts and I instantaneously had a good number of tests for Andy&#39;s code.</p><p>To this end, for the <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Acme-6502/">latest release of Acme::6502</a> I was able to fix a few bugs including:</p><ul><li>Fix PLP to clear B flag instead of setting it</li> <li>Fix TSX to set N and Z flag based on the value of X</li><li>Emulate a page boundary bug in JMP instructions</li><li>Fix BRK to set B flag</li></ul><p></p><p>Unfortunately, I was also able to find a few issues with the test suite. These were sometimes hard to spot but Andy is very knowledgeable and I was also able to find a really cool <a href="http://e-tradition.net/bytes/6502/">javascript-based 6502 emulator</a> which confirmed our suspicions. I&#39;ve sent patches to the suite upstream, and the author was very responsive -- though he says the project is dormant for now.</p><p>So, apparently Schwern owes me some Euros* ;)</p><p>The other bit of nostalgia deals with BBS-era art. I have a couple text mode art modules (<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Image-ANSI/http://search.cpan.org/dist/Image-ANSI/">1</a>, <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Image-XBin/">2</a>) on CPAN already. In reality there are at least 5 variations on the standard &quot;ansi art&quot; format. I&#39;ve compiled a fairly detailed set of modules to handle these formats and uploaded it to CPAN in the form of <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Image-TextMode/">Image-TextMode</a>.</p><p>I&#39;ve uploaded some <a href="http://code.alternation.net/tmp/textmode/">sample renderings</a> so you can see the variety of formats and options available. Among those options we have:</p><ul><br /><li>&quot;9th bit&quot; -- the standard font is 8 bits wide, but typical displays used 9 bits (8th bit repeated).</li><br /><li>&quot;iCEColor&quot; -- basically non-blink mode, last bit of the attribute byte now becomes part of the background color data</li><br /><li>&quot;ced&quot; -- black-on-gray</li><br /></ul><p></p><p>The formats vary on 3 different aspects:</p><ol><br /><li>Font -- Sometimes it just an 8x8 font instead of 8x16. Sometimes it&#39;s the &quot;Amiga&quot; font. Other times it&#39;s a completely custom font so artists can have free reign over the blocks</li><br /><li>Palette -- Allowing different colors allowed for a more truer representation for meat-space-based drawings (hello skin tones!), but I always found that the palette limitation forced artists to be truly creative. Anyway, the Tundra format actually allows for any number of colors on a 24bit spectrum.</li><br /><li>Dimensions -- why be stuck with 80 columns, when you could do 160? or 234? or some other random number?</li><br /></ol><p></p><p>The sad truth is that by the time most of these advances came along the &quot;scene&quot; was already on its way out, and judging but their usage, people really only believed there was &quot;one true format&quot;&#160; -- the standard 8x16 font on a 16-color, 80 cols display.</p>
<p>This was one of my first experiments with <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Moose/">Moose</a> -- which ended up being quite enlightening. I still have some room to grow as far as using Moose to its full potential, but I&#39;m definitely sold.</p><p>* Andy tells me he won an auction wherein Schwern was to add a test suite to Acme-6502 :)<br /></p>
