<div class="span8">
<p><p>I've only mentioned it <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/LTjake/journal/15341">once before</a>, but I'm working on exporting FOAF from Gedcom. I hadn't touched it in a while, but I've recently revisited it.</p>
<p>The current implementation "works" (e.g. <a href="http://www.alternation.net/gedcom/I0123/">HTML View</a>, <a href="http://www.alternation.net/gedcom/I0123/foaf">FOAF View</a>), however it fails to split things up along family unit lines (i.e. what children are associated with which spouse and which family, exactly, was this person a part of as a child).</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre>
Person X
--------

	FAM 1 (C)
	---------
	Parent A
	Parent B

	FAM 2 (S)
	---------
	Spouse 1
		Child 1
		Child 2
		Child 3

	FAM 3 (S)
	---------
	Spouse 2
		Child 4

	FAM 4 (S)
	---------
	Spouse 3

	FAM 5 (S)
	---------
	Spouse 4
		Child 5
		Child 6
</pre>
<p>The above example shows that Person X is part of 5 families. 4 as a spouse and one as a child. You can also see, specifically, that Children 1-3 were with Spouse 1 (hence a family unit).</p>
<p>It's important to note that each person and family unit is given a unique ID.</p>
<p>I was hoping to use foaf:Group to associate each person with their respective families, though I'm not exactly sure how.</p>
<p>You might have noticed that I've omitted any siblings of Person X in the above example. That may cause a problem due to the fact that the foaf:Group in which Person X is a child would be split over multiple files.</p>
<p>If foaf:Group had an inverse (<a href="http://rdfweb.org/topic/UsingRelationship">see wiki entry</a>) then i might be able to just say that Person X is a memberOf families 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 and aggregate those files, focussing on Person X's relationships. Though i don't see a way to show relationships between people in groups.</p>
<p>Ideas anyone?</p></p>
