<p>Apologies, I forgot last post to refer to the text i was nagging about, put the link in afterward. This will be complaining about Adams recent post <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/Alias/journal/37523>. <br">http://use.perl.org/user/Alias/journal/37523>. <br</a><br/>Let's start with alias last words: "And I totally expect the language generalists are going to hate it." I think they suck most, because the rest of his writing is perfectly reasonable and every bit clear mind comes along these thougths when meditating about these problems.<br/><br/>I will state that I also want to write perl 5/6/7 as long as i stick to this body, maybe longer, but there always will be some more formats like YAML/Conf, HTML/XML(XRC), some C or LISP, maybe even some ruby/python or even php and so on I want also edit with my editor. Furthermore I always envisioned Kephra as removing artificial borders, between GUI/commandline, languages, people, principles and ideas and many people aren't willing or in that lucky position to code fulltime perl. So its not that his logic don't make sense to me, but emotionally its not my ideal. Spiritual issues are most important to me. In my understanding they inhabit the greatness of perl and also should inhabit Kephra (see POD in Kephra.pm for details).<br/><br/>When reading Adams first lines i thought ... and exactly this is one of the reasons i started Kephra (allright the last post was just about features but it was a responce to a feature discussion). The next big feature for 0.3.11 will be introduction of syntaxmodes, which i planned for long and will lay the basis, that every function will work correctly on each language (comment will be the first).<br/><br/>What adam criticised to be crappy is also crappy in my understanding but I know generalist can do better.  Simply its much harder to hide that a solution is crappy or unelegant in a generalist program. So we have to be excellent, easy as that. I plan a lot ahead to get close to that. And i want to have a slightly different organisation structure than in Emacs or Eclipse to have some force to ensure that the important parts developed as extension integrate well and don't have much bloat.<br/><br/>i believe Generalism is the natural state of creativity, not only the direction most oversized brainchilds go. And i'm very glad that adam expect that i will grab gabors debugger as soon its usable. because thats exactly what i'm gonna do. (except when i don't :) )<br/><br/>have fun</p>
