<p>while finishing my build tools for now (some features missing yet) and getting instant CPAN and winball releases from the same codebase, which is a significant step toward complete cpanification, I want to share some other idea, which I came to, while talking with jonathan on 10.gpw in erlangen.<br/><br/>Allright I create with Kephra a real nice editor that workes for me well and gets better every day in some decent pace. But its old technology by in large . Once in dresden told me jÃÂ¼rgen, head of the german perl workshop, which features once had Lisp-IDE in the old days. Its 20 years after that and still not that much progress, even if you look at eclipse at visual studio. Allison said something similar about progress in programming languages. Also in dresden i talked at the time with leo, dreaming about running Kephra on top of Parrot und giving you the golden opportunity to extend you editor in the language you prefer. But jonathan noticed that ther is much more to gain from parrot. while using parrot compiler tool you would get full intospection for the so called dynamic languages. In that way you get always correct highlighting, completition, debugging, etc. etc. for your code, no matter which libraries are currently loaded or how complex the project is. That is something you hardly get, when you try  it the static way from the outside, like visual studio and eclipse do.<br/><br/>so will i drop all and start a new editor based on Parrot. Of course not, Kephra was always about have as much features running as possible, now. But i like the idea. <br/><br/>we will see ....</p>

The SF mailing list &amp; forum don't seem to be used, so I hope you don't mind me asking this here...<br><br>I've had problems trying to run kephra.<br>First I downloaded kephra-0.3.6-src.tar.gz from SF.<br>When I tried running `src/kephra.pl` I got the following error message:<br><br>Not a directory at src/kephra.pl line 53.<br>BEGIN failed--compilation aborted at src/kephra.pl line 59.<br><br>The svn url given on the page <a href="http://kephra.sourceforge.net/site/en/downloads.shtml" title="sourceforge.net">http://kephra.sourceforge.net/site/en/downloads.shtml</a sourceforge.net> didn't work, so I got the url from the SF project page, and checked-out:<br><a href="https://kephra.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/kephra/dev/base" title="sourceforge.net">https://kephra.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/kephra/dev/base</a sourceforge.net><br><br>`perl Makefile.PL` runs ok<br>`make test` fails because all the test files refer to the module "Kepher" instead of "Kephra" and to "bin/kepher" instead of "bin/kephra"<br><br>`perl -Mblib bin/kephra`<br>fails with the same error message as above.<br>Am I supposed to hand-edit the variables listed underneath "# Makefile.PL configuration:" (lines 42-46) ?<br>If so, what am I meant to edit them to?<br><br>

sorry for not reply ussually i monitor the sf.net page. as you see the svn link only didn't worked properly because i first created the new page and later checked into the new svn. now this should be resolved.<br/><br/>for clarity. the 0.3.6 release never ment to be able to install in traditional UNIX way. we came from windows, make win packages and are currently working to make this possible. the tgz is only created, that interested programmer can build it by hand or can help us with that. its just a matter of copy, meet the prerequest and stting 2 pathes, but were pretty close get woking Module::Install work properly. 0.3.7 or 0.3.8 should have no problem here. The makefile in the 0.3.6 wrote somebody else who was interested but left when it was half ready.<br/><br/>excuse us for inconvinience but its an important todo for me since a while. expect that we fix it or even better help us with that. *g*

yes and the rename issue is also resolved some time ago, just check the svn or grab a nightly.

<h2>one step forward...</h2>

I've temporarily deleted the BEGIN block from bin/kephra and hardcoded the following variables:<br><br>$Kephra::temp{path}{config} = 'share/config';<br>$Kephra::temp{path}{help} = 'share/help';<br><br>Now, if I run `perl -Mblib bin/kephra` I get the following error message:<br>Can't locate object method "DragAcceptFiles" via package "Wx::StyledTextCtrl" at<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/home/cafranks/checkout/kephra/blib/lib/Kephra/App/EditPanel.pm line 27.<br><br>I can't seem to get any further forward with the Wx documentation.<br><br>I'm running Wx 0.81, perl 5.8.8, linux<br>



<h2>Wx::STC</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/sir_lichtkind/">sir_lichtkind</a> on 2008-03-06T10:55:43</h3>
Wx::StyledTextCtrl is the Wx::STC. i know that mattia is nowadays making lot of work on Wx::STC but because for maybe this reasons the windistro of kephra still uses wxperl 0.57, its also one of my top todos and with latest progress i maybe can resolve that also.
