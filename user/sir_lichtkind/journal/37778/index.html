<p>i've read here voices that endorse O. but i really think thats not smart. I know bush is a jackass and mccain a lam0r but given the gang of crooks around obama and his already broken promises I expect no good from him.<br/><br/>I see here a repeating pattern that already have been in action last years in england and germany. in both "countries" were "elected" guys that could convince citizens to be "change" and "good for the people" and they did more gainst them than their apparent opponents would get away with. <br/><br/>Last month I talked with an old friend of my father. He is a businessman in construction, which means he is surrounded by cheaters. He don't even speak english but after one look at Obama he said "he is a very talented speaker and a very good liar".<br/><br/>This game is played for centuries, so people please wake up.</p>

<p>I really really hate advice along these lines. Yes, the system is completely corrupt, and no one of true integrity can get far enough to be voted for. So what should we do?</p><p>Simply saying "don't vote for Obama" is spectacularly useless. The question is not what we <em>shouldn't</em> do, but rather what we <em>can</em> do to change things.</p><p>My take on this is that this year, if you care about improving the world a little, you might as well vote for Obama. He sucks, but sucks a little less than McCain, and there's no other viable choices. In 2000 I did vote for Nader, because I thought the Green Party stood a chance of getting 5% of the popular vote in my state, which would've given them major party status, a major milestone.</p><p>That said, in your local elections, there are often better choices from third parties, and those candidates may well be viable. For example, for my state representative, I will be voting for <a href="http://www.farheenhakeem.org/" title="farheenhakeem.org">Farheen Hakeem of the Green Party</a farheenhakeem.org>. My district is quite lefty, so the race is really between her and the Democratic candidate.</p><p>Even more important than voting, however, is getting involved in some sort of activism aimed at improving the world. Real change won't happen because of a politician like Obama who repeats "change" over and over. It happens when people get together and make a concerted effort to change people's minds, and work towards real justice.</p><p>I've been very involved in <a href="http://www.exploreveg.org/" title="exploreveg.org">animal rights activism</a exploreveg.org> over the past 12 years or so. I spend many hours each week helping my animal rights organization. I hope that this contributes to making the world better.</p><p>I hope you're doing something too, besides just telling us who to note vote for.</p>

of course, i buy natural/local or grow food myself, go everywhere by bike i can, educate myself and other people, also bit involved in spirituality.<br/><br/>shure its counterproductive to tell others what to do but i wanted to keep this shout short and not discuss every pro and con. it was just a short reaction when i saw how many perl monks where too blind to see obamas new clothings.

<p>I don't consider myself a spiritual person, and yet I care about people. People will have different paths towards similar ends.</p><p>The best way to change the world is to advocate for <em>practical</em> change. Saying "be spiritual" is useless, and may even be counter-productive if you're talking to an empiricist like myself. Saying "care about others" is no better.</p><p>Instead, you can say "The environment is a major issue, especially global warming. If global warming continues we will all suffer. Here are a few steps you can take to start reducing your carbon output."</p><p>That's useful. So is saying stuff like "Person X is an unusually worthy politician, please support their campaign and vote for them if you can" or "please support this specific piece of legislation by contacting X and asking them to vote in favor of it."</p><p>My experience as an activist has been that you can't just tell people "X is bad", whether that X is meat, Obama, or global warming. You also need to provide some sort of practical advice on how that person can help.</p>

my point was that it is spiritual to care, no matter how you name it.
<br> <br>
and thats really the way to heal and solve our problems. to waste time with that election is no solution. i just wanted to maybe help somebody to see that fraud, because you must be first aware of these things and be able to recognize these when they come in new clothes so you can't be tricked. Global warming and many othe sudo problems distrac to many people.
<br> <br>
you have to trust yourself and heal you from psychic problems before you can help anybody. than recognise that we are one and that diversity is good. when different opinion can't set you up than you are ready to educate.
<br> <br>
shure i often explane things with more details, don't worry this time i just wanted raise my voice quickly. Maybe i will write here more often about such issues and discuss it more in depth. thanks.



<h2>Re:What to do instead?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/sir_lichtkind/">sir_lichtkind</a> on 2008-11-01T21:10:58</h3>
allright, i could start with the simple stuff: clean your body. eat the least meat you can do, no soft drinks, no junk food, no industrial sugar or salt, tooth paste without floride. organic food is not only more healthy but it tastes also much better. but thats the usual stuff you can read everywhere.
<br> <br>
what i really believe is most powerfull way to empower yourself is connect to god. when you calm down, thoughts are still and you know god from inner experience. Since i do that, i feel more like myself, more powerfull, more focused and nearly nothing drags me down. That has nothing to do with any religion or theology.
<br> <br>
The other important thing is to feel the feeiling of love in your heart and try to stay in it more and more.
<br> <br>
when you have enough individuals that are strengthen that way nothing will be impossiple and they definitally will not fight about different opinions.

<p>As I said, I'm not spiritual, I don't believe in god, and I don't think that the "feeling of love in your heart" means anything. I disagree with almost everything you're saying (except eat less meat and eat organic), but at least it's something people can do.</p><p>I'm sure what you say would resonate with some people, though, and at least it's more positive than "don't vote for Obama, that's not smart".</p>

This is a fiction.  Not voting says you don't care.  It's not making a statement that none of the parties are good enough for your vote.  It's not telling the politicians that you're sick of their rubbish.  It's saying you don't care enough to vote.  That you're happy with whoever the people who do vote pick.
</p><p>There is no way to distinguish between people who are too lazy to vote and people who think they're making a statement, thus <b>everyone</b> who doesn't vote must have been too lazy.  Those who really do want to make a statement by not voting, submit informal votes.  Get yourself to a voting both, wait in line, and then vote for Scooby Do.  That's a  much more effective statement than ignoring the election (but it still says you're happy to let the rest of the voting population pick for you).
</p><p>
If you don't vote, you are just as responsible for the elected party as if you had voted for them, because perhaps, if everyone else who didn't bother to vote had actually done so, then you might have gotten a different result.
</p><p>
If you don't vote, you are part of the reason that smaller parties and independents can't provide a decent alternative.  You want to change the how elections are run?  Vote for the candidate who behaves mostly in the way you want candidates to behave.
</p><p>
Not voting is self-disenfranchisement.  It's lazy.  But, most importantly, <b> <i>not voting is NOT making a statement!</i> </b>.  It should never be considered "<i>a perfectly acceptable choice</i>" for anyone who has a political opinion.

You may not like Obama, and if you were an american citizen you could use your vote to express that, but telling others to not vote is just wrong.
</p><p>
Stop and ponder for a moment the fact that this conversation would be been impossible just 20 years ago. An East German and an American having a political conversation in a public forum (Not to mention the fact that you have made several comments involving god and spirituality which also would have not been possible). It most certainly was <b>not</b> apathy and inaction on the part of the German people that brought down the Berlin Wall.

Well you presume to know the inner working of Obama's head and that he is consciously misleading people. That is a big assumption which you have backed up with nothing more than your perceptions and the observations of a coworker of your father. Have you ever meet Obama? Looked him in the eye? Spoken to him directly? Have you even seen him speak (in person, not on television)? Have you seen him speak on television without being surrounded by the noise of pundants and the slants they throw? I highly doubt you can answer more than one of these questions with a yes, but yet you feel you can call him a liar? This is rather swift judgement you are passing.  Even if you can point out a case where you think Obama was misleading or even outright lied, can you give me a full analysis of the situation and not distill it some childish idea of right and wrong? The world just isn't that simple, truth is not so clear a concept, good and evil are not so clearly defined, and it is a folly of youth to think so.
</p><p>
FWIW, Non-violent non-cooperation <b>is</b> a political action, but if you were to ask Gandhi or one of your countrymen who was old enough to remember I suspect neither of them would suggest that not voting would be a good idea. They performed their protests and actions specifically so that they <i>could</i> have a say in the way their government was run.

One of the things I have found over the course of my life and travels is that face reading abilities are not always transferable across racial and cultural boundries and are greatly diminished when filtered through the television. So again, unless you have talked to him yourself and looked him directly in the eye, I am not buying your "expertise".
</p><p>
But honestly, I will vote for Obama tomorrow because I know that even <b>if</b> (and I stress IF because I really don't agree with you) he individually is a liar and those around him are crooks, they are a better kind of crooks then those surrounding John McCain (see also: the last 8 years).

<p>Not being in the USA nor a USA citizen, I have no particular reason to believe that Obama is a liar nor that he has a string of broken promises.  Not knowing how good your father's friend is at reading people, I can't really use that as evidence.  However, due to reading many news sources from a variety of countries, I have been unable to avoid learning a little about Obama and McCain and of the two I prefer Obama.  If there were a third option, perhaps I'd prefer that person, but I haven't heard of a third option.
