<p>My brother asked me recently this question, because after his quick view over the net pages it seemed to lack great, shiny and distinctive features. He never used Perl but this question is also relevant to many programmer here, because Padre promises some big features Kephra don't seems to have on it's list and Eclipse and Netbeans (what he uses beside Notepad++) seem to play in another class.
<br><br>
First of all Kephra is very stable (we achieved to close the last known bug/issue last week) and in itself complete, which I consider a feature. Las week I read that eclipse has issues(clear bugs) that weren't fixed in 6 years, with no hope for the future.
<br><br>
My positive reason to use Kephra: I'm very fast with it. I'm used to a lot of function that I even could not tell if asked so the precise answer to my brothers question came to me days later.
<br><br>
For instance in regular formated code there is one command in one line. And when you rewriting code you move lines and delete lines, copy lines. That are all things that I do within Kephra directly. &lt;Ctrl&gt; + &lt;Alt&gt;  + &lt;Cursor&gt; moves the current line (like in open office, but they choose this key binding independently). &lt;Ctrl&gt; + &lt;Shift&gt; + &lt;C&gt; copy the line, &lt;Ctrl&gt; + &lt;Alt&gt; + &lt;L&gt; and &lt;Ctrl&gt; + &lt;Alt&gt; + &lt;RL&gt; chops the left or right part of the line (devided by the text cursor (caret)).&lt;Ctrl&gt; + &lt;Shift&gt; + &lt;Del&gt; deletes the current line. this all are smaller things, misplaced in buzzword ejakulations, but to me its important. Beside that there are some larger features in the queue.
<br><br>
P.S. Yesterday i fixed the line move feature a bit. The curser moved always to the begin of the line, not anymore. And the notepad, that shows the first signes to slowly morphing into emacs-orgmode (which i admire and want to have in kephra ASAP), hast this feature now too. I use this often as todo list, where easy moving lines by priority is good to have.</p>
