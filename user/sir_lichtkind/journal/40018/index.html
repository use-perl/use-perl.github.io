<p>last time I used this topic, it was just about the line editing commands. of cource there is more. and the major idea is to pay attention to what you need right now, while you trying to achieve something another way that you do in your imagination. Its the Perl principles, brought into the realm of coding.<br><br>
One of the first things we did extra to the basic edit functions was an idea of manuel. He brought this up, even before the perl workshop in dresden and I called it, lacking a better term, braceindent. You may know autoindent which let you start after pressing enter with a new line the has same indentation like the last one had. Kephra has that too but if you press enter after an open curly bracket ({), your next line is indented one tab or several spaces more (depends on your settings for that document). It also creates the matching brace below you cursor, already correctly indented. But many may not like that, so this partial behaviour is also optional.
<br><br>
Of course Kephra highlights matching brace, but you can also navigate through matching braces with very easy key combination, just alt+cursor not that crypting things you may found elsewhere. I did this because braces reflect the logical structure (blocks) of code and if you can easy navigate them you may easier get to the position in code you looking for than with a search. Folding commands which also mainly ease navigation and orientation in code lay on key commands that are very similar to allow fast navigation. Sometimes you want to select easily also whats inside a block/braces or string. Vim reminded me on that and  one of the next Kephra versions (0.4.4) should bring that too.
<br><br>
0.4.3 is just too close. most features are written and im currently just cleaning the cage.
