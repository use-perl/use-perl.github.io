<p>I loved it, i was well prepared and it was good talk for a first time but I want to say something about the pictures i had in it.<br/><br/>Ok i had Screenshots with the Program and with Sourcecode, i had some nasty picture of larry introducing my screenshots like a cheer leader, i used some more pictures like a cartoon joke of nostradamus, the beautyful flying Gnu from gnu savannah homepage, the news icons from our webpage but I also tried to tell one consistent story with the old known car and well respected car metaphor.<br/><br/>A naked motor in a testbed, when i discussed technical data, a funny look under a engine bonnet  when i comed to sourcecode, a sketch of the since 30 jears by car industry downtroddened stelzer motor illustrating the working principles .. and so on.<br/><br/>I love the picture of the old car with wrenched on cesna-wings which indeed could fly, pasted under the headline "and now we take off". the next slide were about my plans to make pce the free perl IDE.<br/><br/>Consequentially, on the last slide was a flying UFO. Not only to show that the engineering inside PCE is not advanced as it could be but also because i feel that there is a huge gap between things people spend time with and really important things. Even if I enjoyed it much to stay an this perl workshop. And yes i do really think that this so called UFO's are real. To cite Dr. Steven Greer: everybody with an IQ over mud knows this.</p>
