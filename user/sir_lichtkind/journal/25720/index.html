<p>After joyfull discussion with Ali.as I have seen how important it is to put sources in CVS and next day i did it. still not much clue this in general but it is really eays with tortoise.<br><br><br/><br/>Thanks dave Baker yes i will write here more regular but if you really understand german you can go to my german devlog to read progress up to now.<br><br><br/><br/>its still bit like a commandant on the titanic, from  all direction comes water, linux version still cant be released, christian renz seems to be buisy (he wanted to do the mac port), old wxperl has issus the new even more(or better to say we have issues with it, mattia does a great job), PPI 1.0 is in and that problem seems to be solved, minor fixes these days but still not finished. Lets say tomorrow will come 0.3. :)<br><br><br/><br/>I startet an tutorial about wxperl on the wiki of our community (in german) under <URL:http://wiki.perl-community.de/bin/view/Wissensbasis/WxPerlTutorial>
<br><br>
The other thing i plan is the wikipedia article about perl. the german one(written by me in large parts) is much better(more info, better structure) then the english. when i consider the article nearly complete i try to translate it. i hope i get here some help that some people read it and make corections before i put it into en.wikipedia.</p>

Do not use CVS.  Do not collect 200 revisions.  Really, its better to just skip all the problems an entire generation of programmers had to live with and jump straight to SVN.  It even works with Tortise.<br>

yes mrs schwern vollkommen richtig, I wantet svn or even svk before we even installed cvs but its not there yet on sf.net. we will move ASAP that was the plan since beginning of time.

SourceForge.  Blech.  They'll get around to upgrading around 2009.  Meantime, might I suggest <a href="http://www.openfoundry.org/index.pl?section=en_index" title="openfoundry.org">OpenFoundry</a openfoundry.org>?  You get SVN and RT and a wiki and forums.  <a href="http://rt.openfoundry.org/Foundry/Project/?Queue=82" title="openfoundry.org">SVK</a openfoundry.org> uses it.

even if sf.net has shortcomings and my feelings to it are not the best, its still most popular and good enough(tm). I believe that svn will emerge there 05 or first half of 06 and wie already own a wiki on our server and its perfect for us till its an for team member only. Open  foundry seems likable but there are more reasons to switch to (support perl?)
