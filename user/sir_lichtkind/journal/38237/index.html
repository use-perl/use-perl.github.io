<p>Tycho sounds a bit like silence in slawik languages but here I mean Tycho Brahe. He was in the 15-hundrets a cutting edge scientist, having most precise data and contact to other big researcher like the later to be known Johannes Kepler.
<br><br>
But why I'm telling all this? because afterwards everybody is wise, like an old german saying claimes and he shows a great example how things can go wrong even under the name of science. He had the data to knew that there was something out of sync with the theory that earth is middle of solar system. but he hadn't courage to think things through or maybe was to weak to question authority so he made a fairly ugly compromise to be seen <a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datei:Tychonian_system.svg">here</a>. I have more beautiful photos of ancient drawings of that at home. But my point is: that's exactly how scientist act 'til today. thats how they came with monsters like string theory. just drop the shit einstein and others once proclaimed and there will be far simpler and more elegant solutions like that explanation that all planets go in near cycles around the sun.
<br><br>
Einstein did the same kind of mistake, making our dimension the center of existance and everything had to fit relatively to the observers material eye. but what if the center of all matter/energy is somewhere else and what we experience is just one expression/dimension with some really special attributes like linear time? I think that espcially einsteins ideas about gravity are fundamentally flawed and thatswhy even with 11-dimensional supergravity and branes moving throug 26 dimensional space they don't fit into the rest of physics. (remember the complicated formulas people once had to calculate planet positions on base of geocentric view :)). so einsteins argument for his so called relativity theory (if it calulates the reality, the theory underneath must be right) is an error like pointed out by many (also velikovsky in a letter to him). to be fair, einstein died weeks after this, but i don't think its likely that he would change he views, given what list of peoples writings he read before, like bose (einstein-bose-condensat), heim etc. and that couldn't change him too. So maybe he will be remembered as a kind of Tycho Brahe by our ancestors.

ask questions folks! :)</p>
