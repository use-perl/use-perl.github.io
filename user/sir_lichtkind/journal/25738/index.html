<p>Yes PCE (i still searching for final name) is in many ways unusual, and im happy that some people do welcome the idea and want to help me, but i have to do better job to explain what i'm about to do. <br/><br/>its not only about to show the world: perl is great for some kinds of desktop applications, also not (only) about to have an free perl IDE. 
Its about making the best Editor around there.
That was my and hopefully will be my primary goal. that i choose perl, is just an consequence.<br/><br/>I want a program with and spiritual TIMTOWTDI attitude. there is no question vi or emacs for me i want to have both in one programm(i mean way of UI, its clear that i cant copy all the features in next years). I want to have an really rich featur set, but much slicker to use than eclipse which is  the horse designed by comitee. like linux i look for an sane balance between centralism(me as emporer) and extensibility. It should please different kind of people and bring also "new" features.<br/><br/>and in case anybode read this: comments are always welcome, and suggestions were alwayd considered.<br/><br/>
PS: The comments were disabled accidently.</p>
