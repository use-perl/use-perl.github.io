<p>after finishing the newest 2 Perl 6 related articles for $foo, there is now more time for kephra. last days I implemented the much recommendet feature of moving tabs. its now just movable by keyboard but maybe by mouse will follow.<br/><br/>currently i do bit of try and error in various directions. Of cource there is ongoing cpanification. after fixing some shortcommings in the makefile.pl and meta.yml (install_share semes still be a problem) there is also the thing with pluging in the pathes that provided by File::UserConfig.<br/><br/>The other feature I would like to see is printing, the new statusbar including a new field for coding. on that you could immediately change the coding of the doc. Yes we now that missing UTF support is a shorcomming. but there are lot of other things too so im bit distracted in many directions.<br/><br/>the plugin API is still a draft. ithin i will call the extentions and not plugins, because the can hook into eny event and appear anywere in the menu  so the can extend the app in every direction. modul i just want to call that class of extentions with own panel that can slide in and out. maby that naming is confusing.. will see. <br/><br/>had also discussion with a guy who wants folding, which also just needs enabling. hope i get productiv season.<br/><br/>but look how long its ago that we released last stable and how far (feature wise) v0.3 is behind v0.3.7.6 . i consider to publish 0.4 soon, even if there is no working cpan distro or no config dialog. it would complete the move from proton-ce.sf.net to kephra.sf.net.</p>
