<p>yes Kephra makes progress. I'm messing with internals and I hope to see daylight soon. meanwhile I wrote some helper scripts for our designer to convert icons and test them in toolbar, if they make pixel fuzz. A test script that I wrote for me checks integrity of most configs and if they are in sync with the inline defaults. that took me too much time to check them by hand. now it takes only 2 secs.
<br><br>
Preparing 0.4.2 I have to say that this version will not bring to much new features. yes kephra does not crash anymore if you delete an open file and the folding keeps the same if you switch documents for and back. there are also now links in the menu to oben our website and some other minor adjustments.
<br><br>
Beside the new HTML-entety converter are the 2 big fields that 0.4.2 improves tabbar and folding. the key and mouse handling of folding reached a stage that I'm satisfied with. other editors have 4 fold functions. We too, but our do much more. we have not open/close for singe/recursive folding but toggle functions for single/recursive folding on the current node and also toggle functions for sibling-fold (if you collapse a sub, all subs are collapsed) and toggle all nodes. All 4 can be done via menu, keyboard and mice. but hej maybe you want to interrupt me: there are only 3 main button on the mouse. True but you can click lust button while holding the right :). This may sound horrible on paper but honestly you seldom need the fold all and to me its very intuitive, to use more force (2 buttons) to change all nodes.
<br><br>
the other thig is the tabbar. i switched to AUINotebook to. It looks more serious and has moveable (with mouse, with keyboard you could do since 2 versions) tabs. i want also add the feature that you can choose where the new opened file appears. leftmost, rightmost or left or right beside the current doc. finally there is still the UTF bug i hope to kick till this or next release.
<br><br>
there also more things goning on but i will show them if there ready to present.</p>
