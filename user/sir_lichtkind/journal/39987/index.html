<p>(or caring about details part three)<br><br>
Kephra 0.4.3 will come soon and the beside the finally arriving utf support it will also have markers. its the same thing notepad++, kommodo and scite call bookmarks. Not that I want to be different, but its not the same thing as the bookmarks Kephra has for nearly 2 years and I also believe that these terms are more correct.
<br><br>
Nowadays that browser often set the standard, what UI means, a bookmark is a link to specific location, which marker's aren't. You make marks in your rifle or book and go just from one to the next to search the places you previously highlighted. Thats what Kephra marker do. Only with nicer icons and more TIMTOWTDI in the UI. Of course you have the known key binding, but you can also use them by mouse directly (toggle with left click on the marker margin) or by context menu (right click on the marker margin) or navigate them with icons in the searchbar.
<br><br>
The Kephra bookmarks have numbers and you press the key (ctrl+number) to jump directly to that spot. A fast way to navigate, if you have to switch between 2 or more places often. Marker highlight more places of interest that can also be set by search functions or an debugger. And marker can be saved in session files and file history. So if you open a file again all your marks are still there, but the bookmarks turned into marker because there could be a conflict. Every bookmark has an uniquely given number.
<br><br>
Nontheless: after a restart of the app all the bookmarks and marker will still be there. I even found a way to set and delete bookmarks by mouse (middle click on marker margin). Present bookmarks will deleted or the free bookmark with the lowest number will be set. because bookmarks got new nice white icons with its number in it you can see which bookmark is on the spot.
<br><br>
Yes that all are not the biggest IDE features, but we tend to make one well thought out and complete before we move on. And Kephra 0.4.4 will be about something completely different.</p>
