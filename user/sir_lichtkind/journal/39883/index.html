<div class="span8">
<p>As the <a href="http://trac.wxwidgets.org/wiki/Roadmap">Wx roadmap</a> points out, all major goals for the next big release are met. They write: "We hope to make 3.0 in the first half of 2010.". Yes, Wx development is slow (meaning conservative) but why wait for so long?
<br><br>
For the Perl world Wxwidgets 3.0 could have some impact. The unification of several codebases speeds up development and Wx, already mature and feature-rich could improve faster to something that enables professional large WxPerl apps. Something I've been advocating for years.
<br><br>
I hope it improves especially in following parts: writeable XRC, more consistent AuiNotebook (see my last post), native filebrowser as a an integrated widget (not a dialog), improving WxHTML, simpler API and more powerful tree control, easier access to the accelerator table. I like it very much that Wx people care about details and gradually improve to remove all the itches sooner or later and there are lot more corners to sweep. But i have the feeling that some larger things are still missing. When i have some ideas about that i will post it.
<br><br>
have fun</p>

&#8230; still no KDE GUI? "Native" look and feel, what an impudent claim!

your request for a qt binding seems natural to me, but but ithink there were license problems, since the qt license is much more strict. it would appear to me much much more balanced to appreciate what robin&amp;vadim&amp;co achieved. after all ot is a small team that maybe have not enough free manhours to write such binding.

It's not exactly my request, tons of people with <a href="http://google.com/search?q=site:daringfireball.net+taste" title="google.com">taste</a google.com> want this. Not only Qt, but KDE. Both have had Free software licences since at least 2002. I have the impression licencing is a mere pretext argument and the blame lies solely with the lack of work power.
<p>
I do appreciate the effort; however my criticism is founded on their claim to native look and feel. It is just plain not true!</p>

I searched again and found nothing substantial in both mailinglist which should discuss this topic. So mayby its lack of manpower, maybe lack of demand or of demand * manpower.
