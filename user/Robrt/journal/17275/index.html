I discovered tonight that SBC's DSL tech support has been outsourced
to India.  They were very nice, but the first person I spoke to wasn't
particularly helpful.  I finally spoke to someone else who was willing
to trust me and not follow the script.  She couldn't tell me that they
were in India, just International, but when the second lady had the
same accent as the first, it was pretty obvious.

</p>

<p>It still isn't clear exactly what happened, but it looks like their
authentication server decided to forget my passwords.  That would have
been the first thing I would have checked when a user is reporting an
Access Denied error, but I'm not in tech support.

Those folks work nights to do call center work.  That would get *me*<br>pretty addled, anyway.<br>
