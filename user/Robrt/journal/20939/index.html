<p>I am 856 messages behind on my rss/blog/journal/newsfeed folder. </p> I think this means that I need a new approach to reading (or "not reading") them.</p>

<h3><a href="/user/Aristotle/">Aristotle</a> on 2004-09-20T00:04:03</h3>
<p>Unsubscribe from as many high volume feeds as you can stand to. If any remain, hit &ldquo;mark all as read&rdquo; and don't even try to catch up. I have about 60 feeds in my aggregator, but they're almost exclusively slow-moving blogs and low-volume article-oriented sites, so I'm never more than two or three dozen items behind. Following just three high-volume neewsfeeds was 10&times; as stressful as following 60 low-volume blogs is.</p>

<p>And the great thing is all these people in my blogroll work for me as filters &mdash; I still don't miss the really cool stuff worth noticing, because it will pop up on someone's blog anyway! I just don't waste so much time with all the chaff anymore. I see a greater diversity of cool stuff, and it's usually delivered with an opinion piece or pithy remark. That makes it much more interesting than constantly absorbing a tidal wave of raw information. Occasionally I peek into some of those high-volume sites and randomly pick things that pique my interest to see if I can contribute some preprocessing back to the pool.</p>

Yeah, what Aristotle said.<br> <br>I've been using the jabrss thing lately.   It really sucks with high-volume feeds as they overwhelm everything else, but when all the feeds are lower volume it's great.  One of the reasons it's great is that if I don't have time to read something it'll just be gone, so I'm never beind -- I just miss stuff.   (And that's really how it should be).<br> <br>
