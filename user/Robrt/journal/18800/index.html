<p>Not a chance.  The fact that they made it through the first week is impressive... but without a TV crew to keep them from dying... I'm not convinced they'd make it past the first month.</p></p>

<h2>Sounds like the 'pioneers house' series</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/TeeJay/">TeeJay</a> on 2004-05-18T17:03:40</h3>
I watched the pioneers house series with interest as it was a joint production between channel 4 and pbs or somebody. It was quite good. In the end some of them got the hang of it, but probably not well enough to avoid starving in the next 18 months.
<p>



<h2>Bah</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/pudge/">pudge</a> on 2004-05-19T00:40:43</h3>
I grew up right down the street from houses that were built in the 1600s.  I could swing it.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)  But why would I *want* to?  If they had their druthers, they wouldn't have.

<h2>Humbug!</h2>

You're also resourceful and intelligent.. you'd never get picked for Reality TV.

<h2>Worst of the bunch</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/VSarkiss/">VSarkiss</a> on 2004-05-23T00:43:09</h3>
<p>I watched <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wnet/1900house" title="pbs.org">1900 house</a pbs.org> and really liked it.</p>
<p>I liked <a href="http://www.pbs.org/manorhouse" title="pbs.org">Manor House</a pbs.org> even more.  The best of the bunch, if you ask me.</p>
<p>I thought <a href="http://ww.pbs.org/wnet/frontierhouse" title="pbs.org">Frontier House</a pbs.org> was kinda lame.</p>
<p>But <a href="http://www.pbs.org/colonialhouse" title="pbs.org">Colonial House</a pbs.org> was the worst of the bunch.  What a bunch of whiners.  None of them should have signed up for it.</p>
<p> <small>Yes, I like PBS.</small> </p>



<h2>No way</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/delegatrix/">delegatrix</a> on 2004-05-26T13:48:50</h3>
Entertainment Weekly had a side bar about this show.    The 'cast' begged for a toothbrush in the first week.
