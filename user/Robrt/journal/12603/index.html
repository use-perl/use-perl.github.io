        I'm sitting in the beautiful new Terminal 7 at JFK in NY.
        Home to United and British Airways, it also happens to be
        where the Concorde departs from.  Not wanting to pass up what
        might be a once in a lifetime experience, I'm planning on
        mugging the closest rich looking british fellow and stealing
        his ticket.  A little jaunt to London would be nice, and I
        could be back in Los Angeles in time for afternoon tea.  (Or
        at least Scotland Yard.)
</p>
<p>
        There's a nice little Coffee (and Tea) shoppe between gates 7
        and 6.  Gate 6 is the concorde gate, and gate 8, which is next
        to gate 7, is where my flight is departing from.  I'm sitting
        there, only slightly annoyed that there is no 802.11, and that
        the complimentary telephone jacks for notebooks appear not to
        be functioning.  
</p>
<p>
        On the positive side, I have a great view of one of the
        Concorde's (G-BOAD, for any of you who keep track of this kind
        of thing.)  being prepared.  It leaves 15 minutes after my
        flight departs, so I won't get to see (or hear) it leave, but
        it would have been very silly (yet quite cool) to schedule
        that.
</p>
<p>
        It's a small funny-shaped plane.  The windows are all tiny.
        (Very tiny.)  The plane has weird curves and stabilizers.
        There is what appears to be a small army filling it up with
        fuel, food, and luggage.  Likely, it's the same amount of
        people preparing my 767, but the proportions are quite
        different.
</p>
<p>
        I'm sad that this plane will make it's last regularly schedule
        flight in the next few months.  It seems like a step backwards
        in technology to give up on supersonic speeds, even if they
        are expensive.  ($6000 for a one way seat!)  
</p>
<p>
        This lounge has a great view.  It's a quiet hour of the
        morning, so there aren't planes nose-to-tail going by, but wha
        does pass is quite interesting.  A JAL 747.  A Jet Blue plane
        with a nice checkered tail, and another with stripes.  The DHL
        cargo center is across the way.  A good selection of silvery
        AA tubes and white and purple FedEx cargo planes.  (Insert
        obligatory link to <a
        HREF="http://www.airliners.net">airliners.net</a>.
</p>
<p>
        A United 767 has just stopped its nose about 20 feet from my
        toes as an Argentine Airlines jet lands behind it.  Airplanes
        are amazingly cool and fun.  I should go back to practicing
        with Microsoft Flight Simulator and start budgeting to become
        a commercial jet pilot.  See the world!  
</p>
<tt>5:03 AM PDT / 8:03 AM EDT</tt>
<p>
        Fifteen minutes till boarding and a uneventful flight to Los
        Angeles.  Time to rest the fingers and stretch the feet.
