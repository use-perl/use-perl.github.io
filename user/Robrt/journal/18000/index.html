<p>
<p> You may have recieved some bounces from one of the perl.org MX's
in the past few days.  This is not because things are actually
bouncing, but because someone in Australia (202.12.233.xx) is
re-injecting posts via the nntp server.  (This is why email->news
gateways, especially when combined with news->email gateways can be
very very bad.)  </p>

<p> We've blocked him or her.  But this is the second time we've
blocked him.  (And second IP address.)  Maybe he'll get the hint this
time.  If you get one of these bounces, you can just ignore it.  Your
message has made it to the list.  </p>

<p> I'm thinking about modifying the posting facility to reject the
identifiable looping posts, but I'm worried that if the error says:
<tt>SomeHeader not valid in posts.</tt> this persion will just
<tt>$msg->Header->delete("SomeHeader")</tt> and suddenly we lose our
ability to block them.

<p>what you can put down to stupidity.</p>
<p>What makes you think that the cuprit is maliciously feeding these posts back? Rather than just being capable of not learning from previous mistakes.</p>
<p>Surely by putting in such a header and checking it, you are no worse off in the short term, and the worse that can happen is that you return to the current situation where some moron succeedes re-injecting posts?</p>

I just didn't want to call him/her stupid, because I was being "nice".

the thing is he doesn't quite succeed now, ezmlm detects the loop and rejects the message.<br> <br>It'd be even worse if the mails actually did make it back to the lists.<br> <br>
