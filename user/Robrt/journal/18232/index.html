<p> As you might expect, I own lots of computer books.  Quite a few of
them are <A HREF="http://books.perl.org">perl books</A>.  Most of them
I've read, some of them I use as reference.  Now I've got a book to
use as a gift.

</p>

<p>Peter Scott's <A HREF="http://www.perlmedic.com">Perl Medic</A> is
presented as a book for "Transforming Legacy Code", but it could also
be called "Perl Best Practices" or "The Things Every Perl Programmer
Should Know."</p>

<p>That may sound silly, but more than once I thought: "This feels
like it was taken straight from my brain."  Anyway, on to more details.</p>

<p>The book is structured as if the reader was being handed a program
to maintain or update.  It talks about different ways one might
receive a program, and the different conditions it might be in.  (From
"Bad" to "Really Really Bad perl4 code.")  It then proceeds to walk
you through analyzing the code and figuring out where to take it, and
how to slowly test, mutate, and update the code to run on systems now
and into the future. </p>

<p>The tone and style of the book is lightweight and fun, which makes
it an easy read.  (And one that you don't want to put down.)  It
manages to squeeze in everything from <tt>use warnings</tt>, testing,
debugging, and modules to the differences between Perl versions and a
case study.  The book doesn't stop at just the how, but delves into
the <b>why</b> each piece is important.</p>

<p>If you're a moderately advanced perl programmer, there probably
isn't anything new in this book.  But buy it anyway.  And buy it for
your co-workers.  It is a good reminder and overview and will help you
make your code cleaner and easier to maintain.  Good code isn't just
for rewriting -- if you write it well in the first place, imagine all
the time you can save later.</p>
