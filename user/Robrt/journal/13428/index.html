LXG is an extraordinarily bad movie.  Don't waste your $9.  (Unless you're going with 15 friends totally wiped after a week of OSCON and you're exploring the Portland light-rail late at night)</p>

<p>(For full understanding of the meaning of "wiped", you should have seen Gnat's eyes after the movie.  They reminded me of Wyle E. Coyote after a particularly bad day.  Of course, if I'm making that comparison, I'd have to say that Gnat <i>conference planner extraordinaire</i> caught the roadrunner.)

<i>Addendum:</i><br>
If anyone knows where the chair that was on the deck went... I'm still curious about it!  I'm positive we saw the chair... everyone leave the deck and lock the door.. and then a shot where the chair wsa gone.

<h2>It's ok if you're exhausted</h2>

I saw the last show on Saturday night, after walking around a fair amount and spending five and a half hours playing Go earlier that day.  I was exhausted enough that the movie actually was entertaining, mostly because I couldn't focus enough on all the stupid parts.



<h2>That's Nothing ...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/gnat/">gnat</a> on 2003-07-14T05:58:19</h3>
... compared to how they looked on <i>Saturday</i> night after only a few hours sleep and a trip through the wondrous Portland medical system.  Jenine had a massive allergic reaction to something (bad movies, possibly) and we had an Adventure.<p>

I slept until past midday today, and for another four hours in the evening, and I plan on sleeping in tomorrow as well<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...</p><p>

You could sleep (should?) until August, and nobody would hold it against you.  (Except maybe Jenine.)
