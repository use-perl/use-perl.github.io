<p><p>
<TT>$WORK</TT> had a special showing of <A HREF="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0257568">Kangaroo Jack</A> tonight.  Having nothing better to do, I stayed and watched.</p>

<p>
Now for some Q&A</p>

<ul>

<li><b>What does this have to do with perl?</b><br>

Not much, although perl was used in the making of the movie.  It was
the primary glue used to drive the "pipeline" (which is the sequence
of programs used to render and composite images.)

</li>

<li><b>How do you know this?</b><br>

My <tt>$EMPLOYEER</tt> (actually my <tt>$DIVISION</tt>) created the
digital kangaroo.  At one point I was sitting in a cube next to
artists who were manipulating Jack.

</li>

<li><b>How awful was the movie?</b><br>

Surprisingly bad.  Yet, it was bad enough to be funny and
entertaining, withoug being mind numbingly stupid.  (It was also #1 at
the box office last weekend.)

</li>

<li><b>The kangaroo was CG?  It looked really good!</b><br>

Yes, it was CG, whenever it did anything complicated.  Mostly - some
scenes were an animatronic dummy, and others were a real kangaroo.
Apparently it's quite difficult to get a jacket onto a live kangaroo.

</li>
