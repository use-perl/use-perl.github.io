As you may have already noticed, email is a little funny this week.
The mail servers for perl.org and cpan.org are getting hit amazingly
hard by the MyDoom virus itself and the bounces generated by virus
scanners that kindly inform you that the virus is forging emails with
your account.

</p>

<p>

There have been some very obnoxious delays in mail delivery, things
coming out of order, etc..

</p>

<p>

It's hard when you're a mail forwarder (like cpan.org), because some
users don't want email blocked for any reason.  Others want you to
filter as much as possible.  We tend to err on the safe side, and
not-touch.

</p>

<p>

Anyway, we've been playing with a variety of different tweaks to our
mail system (written in perl, of course) in order to get mail through
faster.  Its helping, but there are still moments when you can't even
get a TCP connection to the server.  Some of these things may make
mail servers unhappy.

</p>

<p>

The mailing lists have been relatively clean, because they're behind a
wall of protection that would make the trojan man proud.  BUT - things
have been slipping a little, so we've put in place some subject line
filtering.  So, don't send an email with a subject of "hi" or "test"
or "this is a test" to the mailing lists and expect it to get through.

</p>

<p>

I'd like to put in place "Windows filtering" like <A
HREF="http://use.perl.org/user/merlyn/journal/17094">merlyn</A> did on his
machine, but google isn't helping me find anything similar for
iptables.`

</p>

<p>

I'll continue to monitor the systems, and will try and send out an
update if anything interesting happens.

</p>

<p>

<small>p.s. If anyone wants to finish qpsmtpd-server
(i.e. Qpsmtpd::SelectServer), let me know!.

<p>Could this be why some of my cpansmoke test reports <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/LTjake/journal/17103" title="perl.org">aren't showing up</a perl.org> on the list?</p>
<p>For some reason I doubt it, but I thought I would ask...</p>

Yes.  Lots of mail is horribly (and I mean *horribly*) delayed.

What state is in right now?  I might want to take a look at it.

<p>I think it sort-of works.  A little bird told me it needs to work around issues with circular data structures, memory usage, and calling exit().</p>

Feel free to contact me direct about it (matt at sergeant.org). It's just been a little complex fitting it into the qpsmtpd execution model (which is modeled around tcpserver's idea of running separate processes for each connection), and there still appear to be bugs which hang the server.

... it should be quite possible to get to work well though.  The basic architecture was designed to make such things possible.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)  (but you already know that)<br> <br>
