This morning was fun, went to Adam's Open Source Presentation Tools
presentation.  I'm not quite sure I agree with his conclusion that
AxPresent is the best solution.  It does look nice, generates PDF, and
can't be that hard, but the one thing it doesn't have (that made me go
with Powerpoint in <A HREF="http://www.vmware.com">VMware </A> is the
immediate visual feedback of what's on a slide.  For simple things,
sure, a text format is good... but this is the wrong place for that discussion.
</P><br/><br/>Next up, Casey talked about Imager.  Imager is cool.  But I knew that already.
</P><br/><br/>I picked up and went back to main room to hear Simon expound on his
favorite modules.  Nothing much different, I agreed with just about
everything.  I'm not convinced that POE belonged on there, but that's why it's Simon's list and not mine.
</P><br/><br/>Dominus's Mailing List Judo was great, and luckily he didn't hurt
himself.  (He was throwing himself around the stage quite a bit.)
Note to self: Bribe the pumpking before sending in the next patch to
p5p.
</P><br/><br/>
Then I became <A HREF="http://use.perl.org/user/gnat/">Nathan
Torkington</A> and gave his talk.  Well, it became my talk:
<U>Something Something Faster</U>.  Actually, it was a
compressed/abbreviated/rushed version of my <U>Optimize Your Perl
Code</U> to be presented at TPC6.  Considering I didn't have my notes,
the talk went pretty well.  I'm quite happy about that.  -- It was fun being Nat.  I got to use a whole lot of fun words in a very high quantity. <b>;)</b>
</P><br/><br/>Next was lunch.  Geoffrey organized pizza and soda for everyone.  It
was much appreciated by all.  (And the pizza was pretty good too.  Not
NY pizza, but still decent.)  
</P><br/><br/>After lunch, I briefly became Simon and gave a four minute
introduction to perl-op trees.  Then Simon came running in late from
lunch and tolds us about optimize.pm.  (WHICH IS REALLY REALLY COOL!)
Kudos to Arthur Bergman who added the optimize::int and optimize::tie
modules.  (The former is a variable by variable version of 'use
integer'.  The latter optimizes tie storage and retrieval.)
</P><br/><br/>Later that afternoon, Dominus gave a wonderful <U>Conference
Presentation Judo</U> talk, There's a bunch of information in that
talk that is going to be very useful in revising the TPC talk.
</P><br/><br/>And finally, I rushed out the Kida talk to a small group of tired folks.<br/><br/></P><br/><br/>Right now, the lightning talks are going on.  Very cool as usual.  If my wrist wasn't hurting, I'd write more.<br/><br/></P><br/><br/></p>
