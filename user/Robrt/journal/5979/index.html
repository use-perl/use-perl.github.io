<p>One of the $20 bills we received (AG82774969B, Series: 1996 ) contained a link to <A HREF="http://www.wheresgeorge.com/">Where's George?</A>.   We went and put an entry in for YAPC.  Apparently it was last seen in Toronto on April 12th.  Someone's boyfriend had brought it back from Chicago.

Anyone want to buy a lot of Perl Mongers T-Shirts?  We can get you a good deal!

My dad found this website off a 20 he got once, and has been hooked, spending lots of time marking bills, and reading their message board. And he thinks I need new hobbies!<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:o)

Spend a few bucks and get a stamp.  Makes stuff much easier.  Also, sort out your bills by denomination, and then series, before entering.  It makes it easier to use the not-very-friendly interface.

My dad does all that. He is number 19 of people who have entered bills. Lake Larry is his username on there.<br> <br>I've kicked around the idea of making a Perl/Tk interface to enter a large amount of serial numbers, etc. My dad used to get a bundle of 1's from the bank in order, and it would have been real easy to enter them all that way.<br> <br>Or at least make a new entry form that interacts with theirs entering them all for you.

#19, huh?  I've only had 5 hits.
<p>
I've thought of doing something like that, too, but not via tk.  I'd just have a textfile like:
</p><blockquote><div> <tt>
20 1995 BT95203423J<br>
10 1995 A434092458M
</tt> </div></blockquote>
and then the program (using the yet-to-be-written WWW::WheresGeorge, of course) would submit 'em to the site.  There's really no better tool for batch data entry than a plain text editor.
<p>
Let me know if you're serious about doing it.  We can prob'ly crank some code pretty quickly....</p>

I've noticed that "Lake Larry" is no longer listed in the California Where's George listings.  Has he moved to another state?  I hope all is well with him.   I enjoyed watching the dynamics of him and Ish Kabibble at the top of the Calif. rankings.<br/><br/>-- Mike (San Jose, Calif.)

He has not moved, just found other hobbies.
