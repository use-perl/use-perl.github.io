Hi Robert, <P>
 
On the O'Reilly site it says you're using Linux to make better Disney movies.  
Are you in a position to talk to Disney about their support of the CBDTPA  
bill, and how it might outlaw Linux, and what that will mean to their film  
production? <P>
 
Am I being too paranoid about CBDTPA, or do you agree that it will kill Linux  
in the United States? <P>
 
Thanks <P>

I've trimmed identifying information about the sender.<br/><br/><P>
If I had a big enough lever, there are lots of things I'd try and change about Disney.  It is a relatively stereotypical "huge company".  Things move slowly.  One hand doesn't necessarily know what the other is doing.  ("How is that possible?" you might ask)  Disney spans the globe.  It has divisions all across the United States, througout Europe, Asia, and probably a top-secret installation in Antarctica.
<P>
In other words, even if I could figure out which division is supporting Mr. Holling's bill, there would be very little I could do to "make an opinion known." 
<P>
Not that I follow the party line, but the high level politics just doesn't affect those of us down here in the trenches.
<P>
Do I like the <A HREF="http://www.google.com/search?q=CBDTPA">CBDTPA
</A>?  Of course not.  But pestering people at work will not help anyone.
