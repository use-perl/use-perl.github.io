<p><p>
I uploaded a module to CPAN two days ago, and within a day recieved
two automated messages from CPAN testers stating that my module had
failed tests.  The reason?  They didn't have the dependencies
installed.

</p>

<p> At first I was annoyed, but after a few hours I came to the
conclusion that I was happy to receive these emails.  Its a little
nudge to me to do things right, and put the appropriate information in
the Makefile.PL, instead of "assuming" people will read the README.
</p>

<p>I've uploaded a new version that should pass the installation test
(I hope), but I expect I'll receive an email in a few hours letting me
know one way or another.</p>

<p>Keep up the good work, CPAN testers!
</p>

<p>
<i>about an hour later...</i>
</p>

<p>After writing the above, I committed the cardinal sin of CPAN, I uploaded a module without running <tt>make test</tt>.  Thanks again to CPAN testers, my stupidity was made clear to me in short order, and I've uploaded a new version.</p></p>

<h2>You're welcome</h2>

The whole CPAN testers thing is a joy to behold.  I'm not one of the hardcore guys with multiple smoke machines to test everything that comes in, but I do make a point of using CPANPLUS to report my pass/fail on every module that I install.
<p>
Those of you who do use CPANPLUS, please consider turning on the reporting functionality, and reporting back test results of your installs.</p>



<h2>Try release</h2>

<p>
<tt>make test</tt>, and <tt>make disttest</tt>, both.
</p><p>
Take a look at the <tt>release</tt> script that BDFOY created, and that I now maintain, and that Ken Williams just objectified.  It takes care of all those rigors of releasing that we'd just as soon not deal with.</p>

Where please? Is it easy to find on CPAN?

It's in my home directory on CPAN (~petdance).  You should also be able to install Module::Release from the CPAN shell and get it along for the ride.

Ah, thank you very much...
