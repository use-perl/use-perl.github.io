<p>Today was a very good day at YAPC.  As noted earlier, the day started off with Larry's keynote, where he compared the different characters from Lord of the Rings to different kinds of people in the perl community, and encouraged everyone to get along.
</P>
After that, I spent some time helping out the conference organizers by selling t-shirts and other Perl Monger materials.  At $5 for a t-shirt, $3 for a hat, and $1 for a mouse pad, it's a serious steal.
</P>
I popped into the last half of Jesse's RT talk, at about the time he was going into fast-mode to try and squeeze all the content in.  I had to leave a few minutes early to get back out to the PM table to sell things during lunch.  We had some more brisk buisness.
</P>
After lunch I popped into Damian's Perl6 talk, and had some perl6 concepts reinforced.  I'm not convinced on the total utility of the language as a tool anymore, but it will definitely be a very interesting and flexible computer programming language, of the likes never seen before.
</P>
At the break I popped out to see people and ended up chatting the afternoon away with some friends and new acquaintances.  <B>Project X</B> was also discussed and implemented in a quiet hacking session taking the hours between 5 and 11pm, followed by the requisite beer.
</P>
Now it's back to the room to find my desktop at home is not responding to packets anymore.  It seems to be there, but not all there.   <B><TT>:(</TT></B>.  I must ignore that fact and work on my presentation and get some sleep.
</P>
All in all today was a good YAPC.  There's some interesting stuff tomorrow, so it should be good too!
</p>

Are you suggesting perl6 has less utility than perl5 ?

<i>Are you suggesting perl6 has less utility than perl5 ?</i> <br> <br>I think Robert means that Perl6 might be less useful for quick one off / one-two-three line type programs.
