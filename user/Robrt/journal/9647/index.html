We'll see how <i>Mega</i> this ends up being when I finish writing it.
I'm sitting in a Cosi in Philadelphia on the University of
Pennsylvania Campus, borrowing wireless from across the street.  I
won't say this is one of my old haunts -- it used to be a Xando, and I
probably visited it four times in four years.</p>

<p> Apparently there is something weird about my notebook or the
hostap 802.11 drivers, if you put the notebook to sleep it really
really really doesn't want to reassociate when you wake up.  I had to
reboot to get back on the net after I moved the car to a spot with an
hour on the meter. 
</p>

<p> Speaking of the car, I took my first semi-awake GPS enabled trip
today.  About 100 miles (as the crow flies, 120 as the roads go) from
NY to PHL.  The GPS let me know that the spedometer in my father's car
reads about 3 MPH fast.  I also averaged about 40 MPH over the trip.
(I don't think I have ever seen the New Jersey Turnpike quite so
screwed up for no reason.  No serious crashes, just heavy traffic in
the middle of nowhere.) 
</p>

<p> The GPS will be much more interesting when I don't know where I'm
going, and can plug a route in and have it tell me when to turn right.
But it was still nifty.  I had WAAS turned on, so I was getting
differential readings, an accuracy of 10 feet.
</p>

<p> The trip wasn't all happyness and light.  Something is funky with
the clutch on my the car.  We'll figure that out on Sunday.
</p>

<p>I had something perlish to say, but I forget what. </p>

<p>Anyway, enough rambling.  The East Coast is still here.  And it
SNOWED for me.  Soon to dinner with phl.pm.</p>

&lt;/ramble&gt;
