<p>I was exchanging email with one of my favorite netpreneur's, <A HREF="http://www.cassingham.com">Randy Cassingham</A>, and was reminded of how many people don't know what he does.  So, I decided I'd plug him here.  
<P>
Among <i>many</i> other things, he's the acclaimed author of <B><A HREF="http://www.thisistrue.com/">This is True</A></B>....<br/><br/><P>
<blockquote>
This is True is a weekly syndicated newspaper column by Colorado humorist Randy Cassingham. True reports on bizarre-but-true news items from legitimate newspapers from around the world (never "tabloids"). Each story ends with commentary by Randy -- a tagline which is humorous, ironic or opinionated. An online pioneer, True has been publishing online weekly since June 1994.
</blockquote><br/><br/><P>
I've been reading This is True for several years, and I've been a <A HREF="http://www.thisistrue.com/upgrade.html" >premium</A>  subscriber for over three years.  It's one of those $20 a year things that brings high quality <i>truly funny</i> material into your inbox once a week.  I know it's some of the best money I spend every year.  (And that doesn't include the gift subscriptions I buy you if I can't figure out what else to get you.)
<P>
The coolest part?  This is Randy's full time job.  He is making money on the internet.  <I>(Yes mom, it's possible!)</I>  He has a huge amount of readers every week.  (Enough to fill a decent sized city.)  I should also note that Randy's a cool guy, who has done a lot.  Here's the bio from his website.
<P>
<blockquote> Randy Cassingham has a university degree in Journalism, but he has never been a conventional news reporter. His unbounding sense of curiosity has led him to explore a number of careers, including commercial photographer, freelance writer (including magazine articles, technical articles, fiction, and screenplays), editor, publisher, ambulance paramedic, search and rescue sheriff's deputy, process engineer, business consultant, software designer, and an entertaining speaker. He is an expert on using the Internet to reach a diverse international audience with entertaining human interest content, and publishing and distribution on the Internet -- and he has definite opinions about where all this is going. Randy is also one of the leading experts on the ergonomic Dvorak keyboard, and has literally "written the book" on the subject; he is also a technical advisor to the American National Standards Institute's keyboard standard committee. His column This is True is one of the largest subscription features on the Internet, with readers in more than 190 countries; it's also carried in print publications in three countries. </blockquote><br/><br/><P>
Anyway, enough rambling and cutting and pasting.  <A HREF="http://www.thisistrue.com">Go</A> look at Randy's work.  <A HREF="http://www.thisistrue.com/subscribe.html" >Subscribe</A> to his mailing lists.<BR>  Upgrade to a premium subscription.  <BR> Laugh. <BR> Laugh some more. <BR>  And support the internet economy......

<h2>Truly funny?</h2>

I dunno... I don't find him all that hilarious.<br> <br>I don't think of something as <i>truly funny</i> if it doesn't make me laugh out loud.  And very little does.<br> <br>Hmm... Dave Barry does, usually at least once per column.<br> <br>
