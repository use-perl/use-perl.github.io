<p>Thursday, I went downtown to pickup some servers for a friend.  It still amazes me how much I can fit into my tiny sportscar.  The office building where the hosting facility was has more security than most airports.  In the basement Bank of America has a processing center where armored cars bring money.  It also is a big fiber hub, with InterNap, Level3, and others.</P><br/><br/>Getting almost 400 pounds of equipment into my car is no easy feat, and I was helped by a good samaritan.  Since he gave me his card, I'll plug his business.  (I was going to put his name here, but decided that might not be appropriate, and better to err on the side of safety.)</P><br/><br/><BLOCKQUOTE>
