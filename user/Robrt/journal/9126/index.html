<p>Some of you may have heard me bitching about my new computer.  Its wonderfully fast, but sadly, the case fan makes way too much noise.</P>
Today's mission had two parts:
<OL>
<LI>Obtain tinsnips to remove metal grating over fan to reduce cavitation.  Mission accomplished.  The fan now has a moderate whine instead of a grating dull roar.
<LI>Purchase a new quieter case fan.  I'm sure the one provided with my case was cheap.  Mission aborted.  PC Club didn't have anything that said "Quiet Fan".  CompUSA seems to have cut back on this kind of parts and the salesperson barely spoke english, didn't understand the concept of a case fan, and most importantly, didn't get "quiet".  Finally, I broke my vow not to return to Fry's.  I wandered around for a while but didn't have enough information to purchase what I wanted, and didn't want to deal with a return.  So, I'll do more research and buy a fan online.
</OL>
</P>
</P>
P.S. Did you read the part where I took tinsnips to my computer case?  Just the thought scares me.

<h2>Quiet PCs</h2>

<a href="http://www.quietpc.com/" title="quietpc.com">quietpc.com</a quietpc.com> is a good starting place for other PC quieting activitites. I've tried running a fan at a lower voltage. That seems to be worth a dB or two. Friends swear by the SilentDrive drive enclosures, though I haven't been near enough to one to judge the difference.

Earlier this evening I purchased a Papst Fan from <a href="http://www.1coolpc.com/" title="1coolpc.com">1coolpc.com</a 1coolpc.com>.  Some reports have this fan listed as only 12dB.  So, it should be somewhere between 12dB and 20dB, which should be a improvement over the fan I have now, which is probably 30-40dB.

<br>hmn, a while ago I bought a pile of fans to replace a broken one in a computer I don't use anymore.<br> <br>I got them from SVC - http://www.heatsinkstore.com/<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...  They have rpm and db ratings for most of their products and good prices, I think.  <br> <br>Not sure I can recommend them though.  A month after I ordered I remembered and had to send them several emails with "dudes, send me the stuff already or my bank will take my money back" before some guy called and gave a story about being new there.  "Sure sure, just send them damn fans already!"<br> <br>
