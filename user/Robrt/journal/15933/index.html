<div class="span8">
<p><p> I hate Fry's.  Sure, its geek heaven.  Gadgets, Electronics and 
Washing Machines.  But its the kind of place where you go in for one 
thing, and unless you are extremely strong willed, come out with a lot 
less money. 
</p> 
 
<p> There are other issues, of course.  The salespeople tend to swarm, 
and be dumb as doornails, almost over-eager to help take more money 
from you.  They have a "liberal" return policy, as long as you don't 
mind standing in line for an hour.  Everything returned is clearly 
marked on the shelf, although generally not "marked down".  </p> 
 
<p>So, my tale of woe begins a few days ago, with me telling <A 
HREF="http://www.askbjoernhansen.com">Ask</A> that it was his job to 
get ethernet cables for our new servers.  He didn't, and decided I 
should just go to Fry's and buy them for him.  So... since its Friday 
afternoon and nothing was getting done at work, I did.  They weren't 
as cheap as I hoped, but Ask is paying. 
</p> 
 
<p>If I had been stronger, I would have checked out immediately after 
picking up 20 7 foot ethernet cables.  (10 white, 10 blue). 
</p> 
 
<p>Instead, I browsed....  </p> 
 
<p>It's not all bad, I think I got a lot for the $266 I spent:</p> 
 
<blockquote> <p> A skin for my iPod.  Wall mounts for my speakers.  A 
optical mouse for work.  Some video cables I had been pining for. 
(Cheap ones.)  A USB2 Compact Flash Reader.  A "CoolPad" for my 
laptop.  (Ok, I fell for it.)  A handheld sewing machine.  A wireless 
presentation doohickey.  (For the presentations I seem to be giving 
more and more often.)  And two DVDs: <A 
HREF="http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0087803/">Nineteen Eighty-Four</A>. 
And <A HREF="http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0079945/">Star Trek: The 
Motion Picture</A> <A 
HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00005JKHP">The 
Director's Edition</A>.  </p> </blockquote> 
 
<p>I know I'll probably get the most flack for ST:TMP, but dammit, I  liked that movie.</p> 
 
<p>At least I have entertainment for tonight....</p> 

<p>Plus.. I can imagine shooting Ask in a photon torpedo casing into a sun or something.
</p>
 
 

</p>

<h2>Fry's</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/dws/">dws</a> on 2003-11-22T03:10:33</h3>
You had your chance. The photon torpedos were in the isle next to the power supplies, but they all had return stickers on them. I don't know if I'd trust photon torpedos from Fry's, even if they didn't have return stickers on them. Standing in the return line with them would be a real nuisance.



<h2>Photon Torpedoes into the Sun</h2>

Then you should know that they don't shoot photon torpedo caskets into the sun until the second movie.  ST:TMP is the one where Neo and Trinity merge with VGER.  And it's an odd movie, so I hope it was at least 50% off.
<p>
Oh, and what did they <i>add</i> to the director's cut?  <b>More</b> footage traversing the vast expanse of the hyperintelligent magellanic cloud?  Or an extra swear word to make doubly sure it didn't merit a G rating?</p>



<h2>coolpad</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/hfb/">hfb</a> on 2003-11-22T16:08:29</h3>
I've had one for years and it remains one of the best bits I've ever gotten on a whim and I use it all the time since these new powerbooks are even hotter than the wall streets. It saves your legs and the powerbook.
