<p>Did I ruin the day of a Radio Shack employee today?</P><br/><br/>Quite possibly.  I was venturing into "the hut" with a specific purpose - <i>noise cancelling headphones</i>.  (As long as I don't ask the staff for anything more complicated than "Do you have any of these?" I can deal with that place.) </P><br/><br/>So, I purchased the headphones (to be discussed in a future journal) and a $3 booklight.  The salesdroid tried to sell me the $15 extended warranty, which I turned down on principle.  Sure, if it breaks they'll replace it, but it shouldn't break, and I really don't want to give them more money.</P><br/><br/><b>He neglected to try and push batteries on me</b>.  To operate the products I needed two AAA's and one AA.  Being a smart ass, I mentioned this to him.  He just looked back blankly.  An older man next to him (possibly the manager) gave me a quizzical look.  Not that I was going to buy them anyway....</P><br/><br/><I>You've got questions -- We've got clueless salespeople who can't even make sure you have the right batteries to operate the things you buy here.</I></p>

How well do the headphones work?
<p>
I've been contemplating a pair of Sony MDR-NC5 noise cancelling headphones for my next plane trip. They seem pretty reasonable for $80, though a quick peek at Radioshack.com finds Aiwa ones for $50, are those the ones you have?</p>

Well, I haven't really tested them out, but they definitely reduce computer disk noise and washer/dryer noise.  The real test will be tomorrow at work.  Two external SCSI drives combined with an already-loud computer lead to noise.

<h2>Batteries</h2>

I bought a battery-operated thing for my daughter months ago, at some toy store.  There was a sign that said if you are not asked if you want batteries, you get them for free.  The guy at the counter was distracted, so I hoped, and sure enough, I got my receipt, and he said Have A Nice Day, and I had him!  I said, "I'm sorry to do this to you, but you didn't ask me about batteries."  Mmmmm, freebies.  They were cheap non-alkalines too, but oh well.
