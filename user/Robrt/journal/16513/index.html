<p><p>LOS ANGELES -  It is almost 11pm on December 24th here at LAX.  It seems just
 like any other late-night in the United terminal, except a little bit quieter. 
 All the shops have closed, and there's a still feeling in the air.</p>

<p>The feeling might be of expectation, as those curled up on the the pleather seats contemplate the gifts awaiting them in Chicago, or other points East.  It might be of wearyness, as people wait for their connection to depart.</p>

<p>Outside the terminal, things seem oranger than normal.  There are cones galore, making a feeble attempt to seperate the terminals from the adjoining roadway.
  The number of men with guns was surprisingly low, but the day's peak travel time passed hours ago.  There was some re-direction of cars, and a taxi receiving 
a full workover, but mostly quiet.</p>

<p>To my dismay, my parking lot was almost full, forcing me to park in the boonies, or maybe it was Santa Monica.  Hopefully I'll be able to find the car when I
 return, and it won't take hours to get there. </p>

<p>Here's hoping for a quiet flight, or something approximating it.  With blankets.  Lots of blankets.   As this is te last flight East tonight, it's the last chance for people to get home for Christmas morning.  Saner heads have not left things for the last minute.  (And then there's me, I'd rather not go at all.)</p>

<p>Merry Christmas.  Happy Hanukah.  Felicitious Kwanza.  Harmonious Solstice (Belated).  Or whatever else you choose to celebrate or not celebrate.</p>
