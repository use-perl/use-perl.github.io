<p>Last weekend, while my export-from-hell was running, I went bike shopping.  I've got it narrowed down to a <A HREF="http://www.giant-bicycles.com/us/030.000.000/030.000.006.asp?lYear=2003&bikesection=8828&range=104&model=10618">Giant  Sedona</A>,
<A HREF="http://www.specialized.com/SBCBkFamily.jsp?bl=comfort&my=2003&fan=Expedition" >Specialized  Expedition</A> (2002 model), or the <A HREF="http://www.bianchiusa.com/site/bikes/cross/09_boardwalk.html" >Bianchi</A> <A HREF=" http://www.bianchiusa.com/site/bikes/07_Boardwalk.html" >Boardwalk</A>.  The first two come in under $300.   The latter under $600.
<P>
The Bianchi is definitely a better bike, a little lighter... slightly roadier (less mountainy).  But I think it might be more bike than I need.  I don't have a good grasp on how much I'll ride it - hopefully this won't be another toy that sits in a corner.  
<P>
Anyone have any reccomendations?

What kind of bike are you looking for?  I'm not in the bike market anymore, but it sounds like you're in the market for a hybrid.  Where you live, you'd probably prefer a more roady bike than a more mountany one; I'm guessing you're going to be spending a lot of time on the flats and on pavement.
<p>
I had a Bianchi road bike years ago, and it was an absolute dream to ride, but only when I could ride it all out.  I got spoiled riding it on a 5+ mile loop closed to traffic, and riding it in close traffic (and stopping constantly) just wasn't fun anymore.  Then again, I'm more of a roadie, and I'd rather walk on a boardwalk than dodge pedestrians while riding a bike.
</p><p>
You don't sound like you're going to take this bike out for long rides, so just get the most comfortable bike you'd like to ride for a few leisurely miles at a time.  If you've got any interest in longer rides, though, get the Bianchi.  It might be twice as expensive, but if you do in fact use it more than twice as much (e.g. keep it out of the corner), then it's money well spent.</p>

Yes, thats what these bikes are, although they're being called "comfort bikes" instead of hybrid.  They're very nice to ride.  I was essentially looking for a hybrid, but got steered this direction.  (I had a hybrid before, and loved it.)

<p>That was my initial assumption too, but I'm questioning that.  Historically, I've not been a big mountainy person, but there are mountains four minutes from here (I practically live _on_ the mountain.), and the fire roads are decent to ride on.  I'd like something I can at least take up there once in a while.  Previously my bikes have been for transportation, but never really over a few miles.
</p>
<p>  I'm not just not sure where this new bike will fit yet.
