<p><P>
Tonight I had my long awaited cooking evening.  It started out rough because I forgot to return a  set of keys so had to make a quick errand.
<P>
The experiment tonight was <i>Ann's No-Sugar-Added Apple Pastries</I>.  Ann discovered something similar in San Diego at OSCON, and they were delicious.  I decided I wanted to try and make them myself, and she dictated an experimenal recipe to try.  Essentially Apples and Filo dough.  So.. I tried it!
<P>
I won't go over the details, but suffice it to say it was touch and go at some points.  But cooking is more of an art than a science.. or something like that.
<P>
The end results seem to be tasty, if not the prettiest things in the world.  The true test will be tomorrow at the picnic I bring them to.
<P>
Here's what I learned:
<UL>
<LI>When the dough has instructions for thawing, follow them!
<LI>Even if something says 'ungreased pan' - a greased pan won't hurt.
<LI>Pans out of the oven are very hot.
<LI>Home-made applesauce is easy to make and delicious.
<LI>Apple Vanilla Ice-Cream Milkshakes are delicious
</UL>
<P>
Ok... time for eating!</p>
