<p>For the past few months, on and off, I've been working on a new search interface for one of my favorite tools.  The fun part - I wanted it to be a naturalish query language, SQL based.  (So, it would be SQL-like => Internal Object Representation => Real SQL).  </P>
I've tried many things, from SQL::Statement to Parse::RecDescent.  I looked at Parse::Yapp, and even considered shishi.  What did those modules get me?  A lot of frustration.</P>
This afternoon, after another losing bout with Parse::RecDescent, I threw up my hands.</P>
At that point, I went back to first principles and wrote a simple tokenizer.  In goes the SQL, out comes some standardized tokens.  The best part?  It was easy.  Regexp::Common helped with quoted strings, and I was in the home stretch.  A simple state machine later, and I had a working SQL-like search tool.</P>
Lesson:  Sometimes a pre-existing modules isn't the way to go.  It can overcomplicate things and make you work in the wrong direction.  KISS works!</p>

<h2>and I hope you looked at the other solutions</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/merlyn/">merlyn</a> on 2002-11-28T16:02:23</h3>
like <a href="http://search.cpan.org/author/EBOHLMAN/Text-Query-0.07/" title="cpan.org">the Text::Query package</a cpan.org>, which seems to describe itself as solving a similar problem?



<h2>Pre-existing modules</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ziggy/">ziggy</a> on 2002-11-28T16:10:44</h3>
I came across something recently that questioned the wisdom of not reinventing wheels.  I can't remember where I read it, but it the tone was something like "reinventing wheels can be a good thing".  The justification was that not every problem is identical, and we need problem solvers much more than we need solutions in search of a problem.
<p>
I'm pretty sure it wasn't referring to the pathological case of templating modules on CPAN though.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)
</p><p>
In any case, I'll try and find a citation, but it's going to be difficult.  I used to keep track of what I was reading on my Pilot, but haven't used my Pilot in over a year.  There's an off chance that it might have been in Pete McBreen's <i>Questioning Extreme Programming</i> or Richard P. Gabriel's <i>Patterns of Software</i>, but I can't say for sure either way.  (Both books are wonderful and certainly worth reading.)</p>



<h2>Almost...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Robrt/">Robrt</a> on 2002-11-28T18:57:49</h3>
I didn't know about Text::Query, but it wouldn't do the job, because I need a tool that can do algebraic combinations of [key op value] triplets.  It also suffers, like many many other modules, from anti-documentation-itis.
But anyway, my wheel is round enough for now.
