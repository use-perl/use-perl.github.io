<p> This is actually yesterday's hack, but something got in the way of
writing it up.  A few weeks ago I purchased an <A
HREF="http://www.apple.com/ipod">iPod</A>.  I love it, although I'm not using it enough.  The next logical step is to be able to use it in my car.
</p>

<p> I purchased a <A HREF="http://www.radioshack.com">Radio Hut</A> <A
HREF="http://www.radioshack.com/product.asp?catalog%5Fname=CTLG&product%5Fid=12%2D1999">CD-to-Cassette
Player Adapter</A>.  Looks good, right?  WRONG!  It doesn't work in my
car's casette player, because of how it uses tension on the spindle to
detect end-of-side.  It would happily play five seconds, reverse,
reverse, play, reverse, reverse, play... for eternitiy.  </p>

<p>That's not good, so I googled, and a suggestion was made to make
one of the spindles spin freely.  After some little screws removed,
and an accident or two involving opening the case upside down, and
watching the gears fall to the floor.... I had an adapter that worked.</p>

<p>Sort of.  The next phase was to put one of the pieces back to
prevent another piece from wiggling and making noise.  Progress.  BUT
- after all that, the sound quality is horrible.  There is a noticable
hiss that makes it unsuitable for listening to music. </p>

<p>I'm thinking about returning the adapter and trying an <A
HREF="http://www.radioshack.com/product.asp?catalog%5Fname=CTLG&product%5Fid=12%2D2053">irock! 
Wireless Music Adapter</A> instead.  It uses FM radio to transmit,
which gives another place for interference.  In Los Angeles there is a
FM station almost every 4 Mhhz, which doesn't leave much of a gap.
Another option is a <A
HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00005T39Y/">Sony
adapter</A> which has gotten decent reviews on usenet.  (Plus, it's
cheaper!)
</p>

<h2>Reducing adapter hiss</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jordan/">jordan</a> on 2003-10-08T15:58:38</h3>
Try turning the volume up on the iPod to full and adjusting on the Car Stereo to taste.  I find this noticibly reduces the tape hiss with the adapter I use.



<h2>iTrip</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ask/">ask</a> on 2003-10-11T04:43:35</h3>
I bought an <a href="http://griffintechnology.com/products/itrip/index.html" title="griffintechnology.com">iTrip</a griffintechnology.com> for Viridiana's iPod.  That was in July and they just started shipping them apparently.  In any case, it didn't get here yet so no review yet.<br> <br>

<h2>adapters</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/mattriffle/">mattriffle</a> on 2003-10-13T20:21:40</h3>
Either MacWorld or MacAddict (can't remember which)
ran an article this month comparing various iPod
adapters for the car.

Their conclusion was that none of the FM transmitters worked very well, and you were better
off with a casette adapter.<p>

I've been using the one that came with my wife's
CD player for almost a year, with no real problems.

Well, one morning last week it did the
play-reverse-reverse-play thing, but it was fine
that afternoon and has been since.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)</p><p>
