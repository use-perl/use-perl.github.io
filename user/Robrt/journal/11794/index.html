I had it working the first few times I tried it, but never again.<br>  It reads journal items okay, and tells me who a user is, but the post doesn't work.

Hmm, so how did you get it to work?  Or, perhaps, I should try it again...  Maybe something wasn't set right for a while, and now it is?  I guess I'll find out...

I use the SOAP interface to use.perl.org to post the majority of my journal entries.  If it isn't working, I don't know about it<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

Well, that's exactly what I've been trying to do.  With no luck, though.<br>  I downloaded the use.perl.el file, and the xml.el and xml-rpc.el files.  I load those in my init.el for xemacs.<br>
I've modified my use.perl.el so it points to the directory where my journal_client file sits, and I've made all the necessary symbolic links for its use.<br>
It worked the first day I tried it, but it hasn't worked since.  Actually, it <i>receives</i> okay, but it won't post.<br>
I wonder how I could troubleshoot it.<br>
Oh well, glad it works for you.  Maybe I'll get it going someday.

I don't use any such things with emacs.  And it hasn't changed in many moons (since I wrote the code, I should know<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-).  Maybe your authentication is not working, I have no idea how you are authenticating.  That would be the first place to look.
