<p>I now understand why Fox chose to not show the 2 hour premiere of Firefly first.  It's too weird - it would have scared too many people off.  Having seen the following episodes and knowing what the characters were like, the "origins" episode made much more sense.</P>
Hopefully another network will pick it up.</p>

The only reason I could think of why they wouldn't broadcast it was that it was two hours long.  I thought it did a great job of setting the stage and revealing the characters.  I particularly love those Mal moments, such as shooting the horse or the cop.<p>

Did you notice the ob.nudity thrown in to ensure that Fox took the pilot?  Never seen again in the rest of the series.  It felt rather dirty, actually--gratuitous and undignified, given the rest of the series.</p><p>

It is quite possible that the sites I read were wrong - but I'm pretty sure the two hour length had nothing to do with it.  That's SOP for pilots.  Another interesting tidbit was that this wasn't actually the original pilot, but a slightly tweaked version.  Joss apparently reworked some parts of it.
<p>
I agree with the ob.nudity - it did seem a little too gratuitous - very un Joss like.  Speaking of that scene, it seemed that the "gentleman" in the beginning looked a lot like the police officer/spy.  Apparently they were different people, because they didn't make anything of that fact.  (I should check that on the ReplayTV.)
</p><p>
The Shepherd's character was very strange in this episode.  If I hadn't known there was "more to him" already he would have made a lot less sense.

I've been reading <a href="http://www.whedonesque.com/" title="whedonesque.com">Whedonesque</a whedonesque.com>  recently.  Lots of interesting stuff.</p>
