You may remember, a few months ago, I went on a hunt for ways to quiet
my computer down.  I never achieved the silence I wanted... but now
I've had to backtrack....  It all started a few weeks ago when I
rediscovered SMART (Self-Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting
Technology) disk monitoring... <i>Wayne's world style flashback.</i>

</p>

<p> I installed <A
HREF="http://smartmontools.sourceforge.net/">smartd</A> on all of the
perl.org boxes, because we like to know what's going on.  Everything
looked peachy.. no errors.. and everything was at a nice 21 degrees
Celsius.
</p>

<p>Since I installed it in the data-center, I had to install it at
home too.. and that's where the fun started.  One of my drives at home
was reporting a bunch of errors and a toasty 47C.  Oy!  Double what
the other machines had.  The fan was pushing hot air out the back of
the machine.  Not good!
</p>

<p><i>Return to the present</i>.</p>

<p>Today, I've replaced my super-quiet fan with a louder, more
powerful one, seperated my hard disks, so they were no longer pressed
against each other.  The SMART reported temperature has dropped to
41C, which still seems high to me.  It's possible that that's actually
2x the temperature.  SMART is funny that way.  Or, maybe my fans aren't doing what they wanted.</p>

<p>Needless to say, I'm worried about my disks failing.  Time to start
planning the "next generation" disk setup.  It's gonna be RAID0.. and
hopefully it'll be quiet.  Maybe external SATA enclosures will be
ready. </p>

<p>Time for the Simpsons!</p>
