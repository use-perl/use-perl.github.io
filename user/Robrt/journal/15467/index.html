I have violated the <b>AV Non-proliferation treaty</b>.  Tonight I
attempted to reconnect my VCR into my media setup, and discovered I
did not have the appropriate cable.  It was being used!  I dug and I
dug, but I could only find two RCA cables, instead of the three I
needed for stereo.

</p>

<p> I think that's my punishment.  Although really, a VCR, ReplayTV,
Cable Box, and DVD player is not excessive.  (And I'll admit I don't
have enough inputs for everything.)  On the down side, they are
generating a lot of heat.  I think I need to get a few silent fans to
move the air around.</p>

<p>What I really need is a proper AV router.  Maybe I should have
gotten the more expensive receiver, but it would have been much more
audio electronics than I needed.</p>

<p>I'll just have to pay the price and order some more cables.</p>

<h2>Cables</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/petdance/">petdance</a> on 2003-10-30T15:52:58</h3>
I can mail you some cables.  I have enough red/yellow/white RCA cable sets to open my own Radio Shack.



<h2>Excessive</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/pudge/">pudge</a> on 2003-11-11T17:33:10</h3>
Is <a href="http://pudge.net/tmp/closet.jpg" title="pudge.net">this</a pudge.net> excessive? DirecTiVo, tape deck, VCR, DVD player, AV receiver, laptop (MP3 player), and PS2 (can't see it, next to receiver, but you can see the 2.4GHz wireless controllers for it).  From <a href="http://pudge.net/tmp/room.jpg" title="pudge.net">here</a pudge.net> it probably doesn't appear excessive (note absence of all cables, except for speaker wire).  The subwoofer is behind the TV, the surround speakers are not visible in that picture.<br> <br>Also not visible in the closet is the hub and AirPort Extreme base station to connect laptop and PS2 to the network, and the 900MHz wireless speaker transmitter.<br> <br>Note the little circle at the bottom of the right-hand speaker wall plate, it's an IR receiver that goes into the closet.  And behind the closet is the master bedroom, where we have another DVD player, DirecTV box, VCR, and receiver, and another IR receiver going to the closet, and the laptop and PS2 and TiVo are all duplicated out to the bedroom.<br> <br>I have only one more plan for further proliferation, to retire the other DirecTV box and install a DirecTiVo HD Series 2 or whatever, and then retire the laptop (will have TiVo Home Media Option), and get HD programming.  Both TiVos will probably work in both rooms.  It'll need a new satellite dish, and the box I want does not happen to currently exist.  I know DirecTV is coming out with this box, though not sure if it will be compatible with Home Media Option.  That would totally suck if it is not.
