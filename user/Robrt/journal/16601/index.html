Today was a day of too much mucking around, and not enough real
progress... a short summary...

</p>

<ul>

	<li>Got a <A HREF="http://www.supercuts.com">haircut</A>.
	(Ok, this was important.)</li>

	<li>Spent the afternoon playing with <A
	HREF="http://www.wirlab.net/kphone/">kphone</A>, which is a
	  software SIP (VoIP) phone.  I eventually got it to work with
	  <A HREF="http://www.pulver.com/fwd/">Free World Dialup</A>,
	  which lets me make 800 number calls through my computer, or
	  call <A HREF="http://www.tellme.com">TellMe</A>, or any
	  other FWD users.  On the plus side, it's free.  On the
	  negative side, it still doesn't work right.  I had lots of
	  fun getting incoming sound to work, but outgoing sound is
	  totally screwey.  (Thanks <A
	  HREF="http://www.tux.org/user/ricdude/EsounD.html">esound</A>.)
	  Or maybe I should blame the crappy i810 audio chip in my
	  box.  I think I'm finally going to have to cave in and get a
	  proper sound card, like a SB Live! or Audigy2.  Maybe even
	  one of the external USB2 devices, for simplicity.</li>

	<li>Then, I upgraded my machine to the 2.6.0 kernel, because
	<A HREF="http://people.redhat.com/arjanv/2.6/">Arjan</A> made
	it too easy.  This time, it actually worked.  None of the
	rough spots that plagued my last attempt.  Well, except for
	the oddness related to the ATI FireGL graphics driver... it
	decided I no longer had the appropriate card in my
	machine.. but compiled fine and all that.  It was a sign that
	I should switch to the <A HREF="http://dri.sf.net">DRI</A>
	driver.  The machine definitely feels a little smoother, but
	we'll see what happens.  I burned two CDs and the CPU meter
	didn't even flicker.  (tap-tap, is this on?)</li>

</ul>

<p>
And now, back to my 2003 todo list.</p>
