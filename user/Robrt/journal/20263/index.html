Tonight I dared visit South Street Philadelphia Cheesesteaks.  Here's my review...
</p>

<blockquote>
  It was not a good sign when I walked into the restaurant and the
  menu said the 'steak was made with a mix of american and provolone
  cheese.  Anyone who has had a <b>real</b> Philadelphia cheesesteak
  knows that
  they should be made with <A
  HREF="http://www.kraftfoods.com/cheezwhiz/cw_index.html">Cheeze
  Whiz"</A>.  I ordered anyway - and a few minutes later it showed up,
  piping hot.  It smelled ok.  It looked ok, although it was kind of
  small.  The bun seemed relatively authentic and mushy and the meat
  had the appropriate texture.  But there was still something wrong.
  So, I asked my traveling partner <A HREF="http://gsrescue.org/bios04/dbsocks.htm">Socks</A> what he thought.  He wouldn't
  touch it.  He wouldn't smell it.  He wouldn't lick it.  It is
  <i>not</i> a good sign when a dog won't touch meat and cheese. I ate
  it anyway.  It hasn't killed me yet - but I'm definitely not going
  back.  $5.50 for a mediocre 6" steak is highway robbery.
</blockquote>

<p>The obvious, you should have already known this, moral of this story?  If the sign says "Philadelphia Cheesesteak" and your're not in Philadelphia, go elsewhere.</p>

I refuse to eat a chessesteak away from Philly -- even when I was in Michigan for six years I didn't touch anything claiming to be one.  And when my parents moved to Massachusetts, I would bring some up for them in a cooler.  I guess I'm a good son.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

You're safe ordering a cheesesteak within about a 50 mile radius of Philly.  The borders are roughly the Jersey Shore south of Long Beach Island, Trenton, the Lehigh Valley, Lancaster, and Newark, DE.  This means at a local pizza place or deli, of course, not a national chain like Subway.  But then, why would anyone eat at Subway when they're in Philly?

Nice round slices of a good sharp provolone is a perfectly acceptable cheese for a cheese steak (or hoagie).
<p>
But slices of American "cheese", or a mix of that with real provolone is just sacrilege.  Wiz is perfectly acceptable, but I never liked it myself.  I'd rather have a plain steak with ketchup than cheese wiz, but that's just me.</p>

<blockquote><div> <i>But slices of American "cheese", or a mix of that with real provolone is just sacrilege.</i> </div></blockquote>

"Sacrilege" is perhaps too strong a work.  Even in Philly, ask for a cheesesteak at any Mom &amp; Pop shop and you're going to get American cheese.  Order a pizza steak, and you'll get mozzarella.  You can get provolone instead of American (since they already have it for Italian hoagies) but it's rare that anyone does that.

<blockquote><div> <i>Wiz is perfectly acceptable</i> </div></blockquote>

I've never seen anyone put Wiz on a steak outside of the bigger, touristy places like Pat's, Jim's, and Abner's.  It's unheard of in NE Philly.
<p>
Like Ziggy, I recommend provolone for your steak (at Tony Luke's you can pay an extra buck for some really excellent aged sharp provolone).  Save the Wiz for your cheese fries.</p>

Provolone is the best IMO, but good deli American cheese -- which is just a mild cheddar -- is fine.  American cheese gets a bad knock because of all the processed American cheese foods out there.

Ask them where they get their rolls.  If they use a <a href="http://www.amorosobaking.com/" title="amorosobaking.com">reputable baker</a amorosobaking.com>, then consider ordering something.  Otherwise, just accept that you can't get a good steak sandwich/hoagie outside of Philly and be done with it.
<p>
(Lee's is OK for steaks and hoagies.  They don't suck, but they're not the best in Philly either.)</p>

But they're even hard to find in Philly, let alone in LA.<br/><br/><blockquote><div><i>Lee's is OK for steaks and hoagies.

I was upset when their store down the road in Wynnwood closed last fall.  I still haven't found a decent substitute sandwich to eat during Eagles games.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:(

Shhh, walt!  You don't want to cause a run on Sarcone's rolls.  They're hard enough to get as it is!
