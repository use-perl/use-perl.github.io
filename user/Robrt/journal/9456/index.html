<p><p>
	It's approaching the wee hours of the morning, and I've just
	completed watching the final episode of <A
	HREF="http://www.scifi.com/taken">Stephen Spielberg presents
	<B>Taken</B></A> on <A HREF="http://www.scifi.com">SciFi</A>.
</p>

<p>
	It takes a special kind of show for me to dedicate 20 hours of
	my life to it, especially at 10 hours a week.  The only other
	time I've watched this much of the same series (in such a
	short time) was earlier
	this year when I watched the first five seasons of <A
	HREF="http://www.buffy.com">Buffy The Vampire Slayer</A> over
	the course of about three months.  (Two hourly episodes every
	weekday.)
</p>

<p>
	After the first episode of Taken, I was hooked.  I had no idea
	where they were going with the story, and they hadn't royally
	screwed it up yet.  I was very intrigued by it starting with
	Roswell in the 40's, and didn't expect it to cover 50 years of
	realtime.  (I didn't learn that fact until later in the week.)
</p>

<p>
	From a technical standpoint the show was outstanding.  The
	effects were well done (as one would expect from DreamWorks),
	the historical accuracy good enough to
	fool me, and just as important, they stayed with the common
	mythos: Little gray men; Medical experiments; Multiple
	abductions; Family links; Mental projection; A child hybrid --
	it was all
	there.
</p>

<p>
	As a big <A HREF="http://www.thexfiles.com/">The X-Files</A>
	fan, I had certain expectations for anything dealing with
	"the alien conspiracy", and it definitely met those.  I was
	able to make connections with what I knew, and find
	interesting differences and similarities.  
</p>

<p>
	Most importantly - I felt compelled to watch.  It was good
	drama.  "Good TV."  The characters were interesting and the
	relationships between them were intriguing.  Three families
	whose fates are intertwined.  Destiny (and more) passed from
	parent to child.  Because I watched every episode the next day
	(thank you <A HREF="http://www.replaytv.com">ReplayTV</A>) I
	had opportunities to watch two episodes in one night.  It was
	hard to resist -- but I did, until tonight.
</p>

<p>
	When I first heard about this, I didn't understand how big an
	event SciFi was making of it.  They dedicated over eight hours
	a day to show episodes.  (A _third_ of their programming.)
	Plus, 10 hours on weekends, recapping the previous week.  They
	changed their logo at the same time.  I can only hope that
	others loved the show as much as I did and SciFi continues to
	produce creative original programming.
</p>

<p>
	Having ranted quite a bit above about what I love, I feel
	obligated to point out one thing I didn't like.  I think the
	first 9 episodes were wonderful.  They kept me on the edge of
	my seat.  The 10th and final episode was disappointing.  It
	was predictable and cliched.  Maybe they just ran out of time
	-- It's easy to imagine how difficult it was to create a 20
	hour seamless miniseries -- if it was longer, things only get
	harder.  I'm not quite sure what exactly bothers me, except
	for the feeling that all the loose ends came together a little
	too cleanly.  Everyone got what they deserved (where
	"deserved" isn't quite the right word.)
</p>

<p>
	If you didn't watch Taken (and I'd guess that a majority of
	you, kind readers, haven't) you should try and do it.  Don't
	bother with the <A
	HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/044024126X/"
	>book</A>.  I think there will be a <A
	HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00005JM39"
	>DVD</A> eventually.  Rumor has it that SciFi will be
	reshowing it in February, if not before.
