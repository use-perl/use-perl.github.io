If you've been following <A HREF="http://planet.perl.org/">Planet
Perl</A> or <A HREF="http://askask.com/">Ask's Journal</A> you'll know
that we lost our main perl.org mailing list server (<tt>onion</tt>) on
Monday when we installed <b>really cool</b> <A
HREF="http://www.cyclades.com">Cyclades</A> <A
HREF="http://www.cyclades.com/products/powermanagement/">AlterPath
Power Management</A> hardware.  And then we had a big release at work,
and couldn't get back to the <A HREF="http://www.ix2.com">data
center</A> to fix it.
   </p>

<p>Last night around 11:02PM, Ask started <A
HREF="http://www.memtest.org">memtest86+</A> to see if that was the
problem.</p>

<p>It wasn't.</p>

<p>This morning I went to the datacenter to try and fix it up.  First
goal was making it work under FreeBSD.  Sadly, this didn't work.
Basically, <tt>onion</tt> wouldn't re-stabilize under FreeBSD.  It
liked to spontaneously reboot.  (And usually while <tt>fsck</tt>ing.)
The FreeBSD 5.2 Rescue CD threw lots of errors.  Single user mode was
no better.</p>

<p>The only thing that I could keep running on the machine for more
than 2 minutes was the <A
HREF="http://www.tux.org/pub/people/kent-robotti/looplinux/rip/">
(R)ecovery (I)s (P)ossible Linux rescue system</A>.  It booted.  It
let me ssh.  It let me mount the FreeBSD partitions.  It even let me
run <tt>agetty</tt> so I could use our wonderful <A
HREF="http://www.cyclades.com/products/3/alterpath_acs">console
server</A>.

<p>Using RIP, I was able to get all of the raw partitions over to our
big disk machine, and from there we moved the files to the new
mailserver.  Luckily, I discovered that somewhere in our all 100Mb
network was something limiting me 10Mb/s.  This meant that the onion
backup would have taken over a day.  <b>not good</b>.  A little bit of
quick repatching, and we were back up to real speeds.</p>


<p>Anyway, As I write this, Ask is tweaking the configuration, I'm
messing with postfix, and hopefully mail will start to flow in the
next few hours.  </p>

Nice work guys. It really is a thankless task, and I think you and Ask do a storming job.

Thanks for all the hard work.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<p>

I got my subscription confirmation overnight from my attempt to subscribe to the qpsmtpd list a few days ago, so in my case mail is flowing again.</p><p>

<h2>Origin of onion?</h2>

<p>I take it the box was named "onion" because it brought tears to your eyes?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)</p>

No, it was onion because of the <a href="http://www.wall.org/user/larry/onion/onion.html" title="wall.org">2nd State of the Onion</a wall.org>.   The first perl.org box I ran was called tmtowtdi.perl.org.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br> <br>Now most of the boxes are called exciting things like "x1", "x2" and so on.<br> <br>
