I shall treat everyone to rambling missives about <A
HREF="http://conferences.ora.com/oscon/">TPC</A>, at least until I get
tired writing them.

I had the best intentions to depart LA early and arrive in San Diego
mid-afternoon.  Luckily, I knew it was only a two hour drive, so even
if I didn't leave early, I could still get to San Deigo at a
reasonable time.  I left Burbank at about 1:43, after a quick stop in
the office to print out some slides.  (And *something* was down, which
complicated things, but everything printed happily.)  <I>Pause here to
plug in natural keyboard.</i> I didn't have to pack light, because I
was driving, which made it easy to just throw things in the car.
Anyway, now that I've rambled enough in this paragraph, lets just say
I made very good time to San Diego, it took me about two hours, which
is just about the legal limit.
</P><br/><br/><P>
The hotel was easy to find, and is quite pretty.  I was able to park
very close to my room, so not much lugging going on.  The downside, is
that this room is about as far as you can get from where the
conference is actually happening.  It's a little small, but just fine
for me.  Interestingly enough, this particular room has an Ethernet
jack, and link, but no packets going over it.  A call to the
front-desk shortly after midnight denies all knowledge of internet
access in the rooms.  I <b>know</b> others have been successful, so
I'll have to ask again tomorrow.  It's my own fault for waiting so
long.  I probably don't need internet access in the room, but it's
always nice to have, right?  (And then I could setup wireless and go
sit by the pool!)  The hotel is really pretty with great views of the
marina and navy base, but the food and beverages are amazingly
overpriced.
</P><br/><br/><P>
In the line for Speaker Registration, I bumped into Adam, Lisa, Nat,
Damian, Allison, Jos, Ingy, Casey, and others.  Vee (who has an
amazing amount of patience) was giving out badges and trying not to
get too frazzled by everyone's antics.
</P><br/><br/><P>
Spent the rest of the day hanging out, working on a secret project
with Ziggy, attending a PDP Workers meeting, and hanging out some
more.  Nat had his video camera and was starting to piece something
together.  I'll be curious to see what he puts together.  Ask let me
play with his cool digital still camera.  (Nikon D1X).  Just like with
my camera, I took a bunch of dark and blurry pictures.  Also, my odd
fetish for palm tree pictures caused me to take a few.  (I guess
that's what happens when you move to California and palm tree's are
novel.)
</P><br/><br/><P>
Ok, back to working on the presentation, and watching a little more of
this murder/road-trip movie on Showtime.  More tomorrow, if you're
lucky.</P>
