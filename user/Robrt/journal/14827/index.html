The Primetime Emmy broadcast was tonight.  Oddly enough, even though
it was in Los Angeles, it was tape-delayed on the west coast.  (In Los
Angeles.)


</p>

<p> On a brighter note, some good shows won awards: <A
HREF="http://www.scifi.com/taken">Taken</A> won best mini-series.
Firefly took "Outstanding Special Visual Effects For A
Series". beating Buffy and 3 nomiations for Enterprise.  I was happy
to see <A HREF="http://www.usanetwork.com/monk">Monk</A> take best
male actor (and "Outstanding Main Title Theme Music").  The "Creative
Arts" category group awards have some interesting nominations in there.  Good shows got nominated.
</p>

<p> Anyway... it's good to see shows I like getting recognized.  (Oy.
I'm obviously been affected by my close proximity to Hollywood.)  </p>

I agree with you about Tony Shalhoub.  He did a really good job playing Adrian Monk.  I used to watch Wings and thought he was great playing Antonio as well.<br> <br>As for the awards as a whole, why oh why didn't they just have John Stewart as the presenter?  Was it just me or was Gary Shandling embarrassingly unfunny?  Maybe he just had an off night.

I've never really liked Gary Shandling's humor.  And I'll admit I wasn't really paying attention to his piece.
