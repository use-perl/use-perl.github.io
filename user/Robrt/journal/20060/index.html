I'm going to attempt to try and write daily missives from OSCON, I
suspect I'll slip as the week progresses -- but I've got to at least try. 

</p>

<p>

Today started with a bright and early wake up at 6:30 to get to the
airport for my 9:20 flight.  Extra special thanks to my friend Troy
for driving me.  Much easier to not have to worry about the car.  The
flight was quite uneventful, and the view was beautiful.  My luggage
took a while to come off the plane, but I shouldn't complain about
that.

</p>

<p>Checking in at the hotel was uneventful, and I got exactly the room
I wanted, after a little bit of prodding.  A non smoking room on a
high floor (facing the river) with a king bed.  (Conveniently it is
right under Jesse so I can latch onto his wireless.)

</p>

<p> The afternoon was spent at the Oregon Brewers Festival, where good
food and good beer was had.  That was after a mishap with my laptop -
it just didn't want to do the right thing and talk to the conference
network.  Quite disturbing!  The Mac-folks had me <b>very</b> close to
running out and buying a 12" powerbook.  </p>

<p>Now, my laptop seems happy, the card is definitely not fried.  I
love my ThinkPad.  I'm not ready to retire it.  We'll see what happens
in the morning.  I may get dragged to an Apple Store.  At which point
someone may take my VISA from my wallet.....</p>

<p>I'm looking forward to some tutorials tomorrow.  Possibly Matt
Sergeant's "STOP SPAMMING ME!" (which will cover some of qpsmtpd, not
that I need to know more about it) or Single Sign On in the morning.
Maybe Single Sign on or Advanced DBI in the afternoon.  Or maybe I'll practice the RT presentation for Tuesday.</p>

<p>This has been a brain dump.</p>
