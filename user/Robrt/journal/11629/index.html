<p><p> I want to know who at <A HREF="http://www.sun.com">Sun</A>
decided that <i>servers</i> should have power management enabled by
default.  </p>

<p>Ask and I went to the data center today to find out why one of our
boxes dropped off the net.  It went to sleep!  </p>

<p><tt>powerd</tt> is now disabled.</p></p>

<h2>depends on your definition of default</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/hfb/">hfb</a> on 2003-04-14T05:37:40</h3>
<p>with a manual install the powerd question is part of the routine so it's only on by default if you aren't paying attention or don't have it configured in your jumpstart config. Besides, most people who can afford $20k and up for a server usually can spare a few bucks for a UPS<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) kill vold too.</p>

I've pondered that question myself in the past
as well. I finally decided to blame environment friendly California. SUN is located in California,
and I wouldn't be surprised if there was a state
law demanding this to be turned on by default.
And it it isn't true, I'd like to believe so.

<p>it's not on by default though as it asks you 3 times if you wish to enable it. I suppose they figure the random amateurs won't notice and it might save a lot of power on desktops and idling boxes...but it seems to catch a few people who should know how to read the banner on reboot asking if you<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/really/ want to enable powerd<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<p>If it asks you three times I don't think it can really be considered 'default'<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

It definitely didn't ask me three times.

<p>You must have just missed them then as it asks and even waits for a response on the reboot though I don't recall if it has a timeout. </p>

<p>from the manpage...</p>

<p> <i>The default behavior is  mandated  by  the  U.S.  Government Environmental  Protection  Agency as a requirement for EnergyStar compliance. The user will be prompted to confirm this default  at  system installation reboot, or during the first boot after the system is unconfigured by sys-unconfig(1M).</i> </p>

<p>and since it asks to confirm, I don't think it's technically a default install like, say, nscd or something like that.</p>
