You've heard all the hype: <b>Digital Movies</b> - no film involved -
sharper, clearer, cheaper!  Personally, the hype didn't do anything
for me.  I didn't rush out to go see Star Wars on a digital screen.
</p>

Well, I've seen the light: <b><i>Digital is the future.</i></b>
</p>

At my $DAYJOB, at a ${MAJOR_MEDIA_COMPANY}, I've been working with
the team working toward a filmless production process.  Since our
movies are mostly made with computers, this allows us to create a
completely digital pipeline.  In the short term, we're not aiming to
get rid of film entirely, and aren't going to distribute the films
digitally.  The system we have will allow us to eliminate costs and
film processing turnaround, as well as cut down on color variances.
</p>

The big question, and what's important to the artists is <b>how does
it look?</b>.  And the answer?  It's <i>gorgeous</i>.  For the past
few days we've been testing our system and comparing it to film.  It's
sharper, the darks are darker, and I think some of the colors are
nicer.  With the proper digital source, side by side with film, you'd
choose the digital one.</p>

Things aren't perfect yet, but they're improving.  Raw resolution is
lower (with our current equipment) and the projector bulbs are not
quite as bright, leading to sizing issues.  But, these are being
worked out and the next generation systems will project brighter,
sharper, and bigger sizes.</p>

It may take ten or fifteen years, but digital projection is coming to
a theater near you, and the first time you see it, you'll realize that
you don't miss the grain, jitter, and scratch marks one bit.

<h2>but what about the compression?</h2>

When I last got hard data, film captured seven orders of magnitude of light, from the brightest bright to the darkest dark.  The best CCDs at the time could capture only three.
<p>
Now, that may not make much difference if you're showing it on a video screen (in fact, you can't possibly see the difference), but it makes a big impact in a movie theatre, which can reproduce the full dynamic range.
</p><p>
Have the CCDs become sensitive enough to get a bigger dynamic range, or is it still compressed?</p>

I have no idea, we make animated movies, so no CCD's are involved.  But, I expect that CCD's are improving rapidly....

Ahh.  Well, maybe that's why you think video works in place of film.  You weren't ever shooting film. {grin}

<h2>Cool Job</h2>

<p>Sounds like you have a really cool job with the Mouse Factory. When I was working for them all I got to do was write systems to count video sales<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:(</p>

It varies from "cool" to "mind numbingly frustrating".
