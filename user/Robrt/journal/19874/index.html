<p><p>So, it's been a year now.  I still haven't received one email telling me that the next edition of TPJ was ready.</p>

<p>I emailed Kevin Carlson, the editor, on June 20th , to followup on our discussions from a few months ago -- when he promised they were switching mail sending systems and the problem would be resolved soon.  Usually he gets back to me quickly, but this time... just silence.  So, like any good internet denizen, I'm announcing it in my blog.</p>

<p>Sending emails isn't hard.  Really.  You can even use perl for it.</p></p>

I wrote an article a few weeks back that's supposed to be going in the August issue. I know Kevin was on holiday for a few weeks so he may be piling through a backlog of mail.



<h2>As a columnist...</h2>

... I find that even the notifications <i>I</i> am supposed to get to "pick" up the new edition are only randomly delivered.
<p>
What's up with that? {sigh}</p>



<h2>But even without notifications</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/yudel/">yudel</a> on 2004-07-26T19:40:16</h3>
The issues keep coming out. The June issue is currently featured at http://www.tpj.com



<h2>Apologies for the mail thing</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/TPJ_edit/">TPJ_edit</a> on 2004-08-02T17:57:28</h3>
This is Kevin from TPJ here - sorry to all who are having mail troubles with TPJ. The tpj.com mail goes through mail servers that we (or I guess I should say "I") don't administer. They live at the company's facilities and are run by their admins. They've got a really restrictive spam filter running, and it appears not to be working right anyway. Folks are getting bounces that list a a URL that should explain why the mail bounced, but right now, that URL is giving a 404. <br>
<br><br/><br/>I'm going to try to work it out with our corporate IT folks. There must be something we can do to improve the situation. Again, I apologize.<br>
<br>
Further, lots of people don't get the announcement e-mails, which are not handled by our corporate servers. Those are sent out through Topica. I know, I know--before the booing and hissing begins, let me just say we're limited by the arrangements made company-wide for mail list administration. I'm working to try to improve this situation, too. <br>
<br>
Anyway, I want to thank all the folks who have stuck with us through the difficulties. Obviously, we've got some infrastructure issues we need to work out with the IT powers-that-be here at CMP. We'll do our best to keep getting a quality magazine out to you. Luckily, none of these infrastructure problems hamper our ability to get the magazine done. We've been publishing the digital TPJ every month since Nov. 2002. <br>
<br>
We do have an RSS feed, for those with RSS readers. It's certainly more reliable than the e-mail. I hope that will help ease some of the difficulties.<br>
<br>
