<p>I think that <code>perl Build.PL --install-base<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/var/lookie/here</code> is what you want. Give it a try!</p>

It's similar, but intentionally not the same as the byzantine demented logic of PREFIX.  The real problem is that neither CPAN nor CPANPLUS support the Module::Build arguments, even though the latter will run Build.PL scripts in preference to Makefile.PL.

I <b>like</b> the <i>the byzantine demented logic of PREFIX</i>.  It does what I expect it to, and works like all the other packages installed into my local site_perl referenced by <tt>$ENV{PERL5LIB}</tt>.<br/><br/>And then there's this beauty:<blockquote><div> <tt>rspier@bear ~/.cpan/build/Module-Build-0.25$ perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/tmp/foo<br>Sorry, PREFIX is not supported.&nbsp; See the Module::Build<br>documentation for 'destdir' or 'install_base' instead.</tt> </div></blockquote>

You might like it, but it's really, really, really complicated to support.  I think install_base will do what you expect it to do too.  I think what you really dislike is that if you have PREFIX set as a standard argument for CPAN or CPANPLUS, it just doesn't work with Module::Build, which is annoying.

--install_base produces a different structure than PREFIX does, so <tt>use lib</tt> or <tt>$PERL5LIB</tt> are different for each.

<p>So does PREFIX.  The heuristics of how PREFIX works drifts from version to version of MakeMaker especially between 5.x and 6.x.  Part of the problem is nobody can really quite agree on how it should work.  The other part is its attempts to make the PREFIX layout match the system layout.  Fix one thing, break another.  For the longest time modules installed on Debian came out funny because they put things in<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/usr/share.  I've tried to get a handle on it but its like trying to eat jello with a fork.  Its really quite insane.

</p><p>I'd love to see Module::Build's Makefile.PL handle PREFIX but its quite a bit harder than you think.  Times two.  About the only thing that could be done is to somehow pull the logic out of ExtUtils::MM_Unix-&gt;init_INSTALL and make it a function of ExtUtils::Install or something so Module::Build and ExtUtils::MakeMaker can share the same code.  Good luck.</p>

we try to support it, but there's so many features lacking from Module::Build it's not even funny.<br> <br>From the latest development snapshot of CPANPLUS, these issues (among others) are still open:<br> <br>=head1 KNOWN ISSUES<br> <br>There are some known issues with Module::Build, that we hope the<br>authors will resolve at some point, so we can make full use of<br>Module::Build's power.<br> <br>=over 4<br> <br>=item * Passing build flags to 'new_from_context'<br> <br>This is sadly not possible untill Module::Build is patched to support<br>this feature. This means you are stuck with the default behaviour of<br>the Build.PL in the distribution.<br> <br>=item * Uninstall modules installed by Module::Build<br> <br>Module::Build doesn't write a so called packlist file, which holds<br>a list of all files installed by a distribution. Without this file we<br>don't know what to remove. Untill Module::Build generates this<br>packlist, we are unable to remove any installations done by it.<br> <br>=item * Unable to figure out a distributions prerequisites.<br> <br>Module::Build only reports back to the user the prerequisites that were<br>not fulfilled. Prerequisites that a distribution has, and that are<br>already installed, are not reported back. Needless to say, this makes<br>it impossible to reliably generate distributions for packagemanagers<br>reliably.<br> <br>=item * Module::Build's version comparision is not supported.<br> <br>Module::Build has it's own way of defining what versions are considered<br>satisfactory for a prerequisite, and which ones aren't. This syntax is<br>something specific to Module::Build and we currently have no way to see<br>if a module on disk, on cpan or something similar is satisfactory<br>according to Module::Build's version comparison scheme.<br>As a work around, we now simply assume that the most recent version on<br>CPAN satisfies a dependency.<br> <br>=back<br> <br>=cut<br> <br>not to mention a compatibillity mode which would allow users and all kinds of scripts that have existed forever use things like PREFIX etc...<br>

<i>Passing build flags to 'new_from_context'</i> <br> <br>Looks like you can do this now.  Unfortunately, it's not documented.<br> <br> <i>Uninstall modules installed by Module::Build</i> <br> <br>I wrote code to write packlists a long time ago.  I should nag Ken to apply that patch.<br> <br> <i>Unable to figure out a distributions prerequisites.</i> <br> <br> <i>Module::Build's version comparision is not supported.</i> <br> <br>It has requires(), build_requires(), recommends(), and conflicts() methods that return the hash reference that the user specified.  Then you can call check_installed_status() for these and it will return information what version the user has, what version is wanted, and an error message.
