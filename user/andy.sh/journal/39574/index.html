<h1>The lack of comments in Iron Man</h1>

<p>There are 195 authors listed on Iron Man page (I have registered two separate blogs myself).<br/><br/>Two hundred is definetely cool. But what really sad is that the number of commens tends to zero. <br/><br/>Iron Man initiative should nominate "Iron Commenter" position as well :-)</p>

<h2>Commenting vs posting response</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/revdiablo/">revdiablo</a> on 2009-09-03T20:18:26</h3>
<p>There is some tension between commenting and posting a response.  Since Iron Man rewards posting to your own blog, it probably incentivizes response posts.</p>

<p>Let me clarify a bit my initial thought.</p><p>Iron Man was partially about "blogging for indexing by Google". But those posts that are left without comments will look in search results as those multiple forum questions where someone asked to help solving a problem and no one knows the solution for years.</p><p>The same with posts about Perl. Does that if I've written "I like Perl" and received no replies mean that no one really like it? What will other people see?</p>

<p>Sounds like we need to get linkback's going (where oh where did 2003 go?) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linkback" title="wikipedia.org">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linkback</a wikipedia.org></p>

<h2>Every blog has its own commenting interface</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/rhesa/">rhesa</a> on 2009-09-03T20:36:43</h3>
<p>I've been meaning to comment on occasion, only to be greeted by captchas and other nonsense that made the barrier too high. Say about use.perl what you will, commenting works great.</p><p>Ironman bloggers: get a decent spam filter and stop relying on half-baked JS and captchas that only repel serious humans anyway!</p>



<h2>Business as usual</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Aristotle/">Aristotle</a> on 2009-09-03T22:31:28</h3>
<p>This is all pretty normal.</p><p>Probably 85% of the posts on use.perl have no comments. Even of the ones who have, probably something like half only have one comment (and maybe a response to that by the journal owner).</p>
