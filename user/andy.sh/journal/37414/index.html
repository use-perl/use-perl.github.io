<p>This post is not really about Perl language, but still is about languages. To illustrate how these two are connected, here is a story which happened in the evening after Ukrainian Perl Workshop, at which we had guests from the UK, Jonathan Worthington and Peter Edwards.<br/><br/>Jonathan, Peter and three of us from Moscow (Alex, Ivan and me) moved to the sightseeing place over the river Dnipro. (Here I could start speaking about how beautiful Kiev is, how nice it is to stand in the night and see the lights of the city laying along the river :-)<br/><br/>It happened that we stood in two groups (at least one UK citizen in each), talked about different things, and when joined back (in a half an hour maybe), we suddenly understood, that at that time both groups were discussing linguistic things! I do not remember what we were talking about with Jonathan, and remember that Alex explained Peter Russian synonyms.  </p>
