<p>Very soon, in a month, there will happen joint conference "Perl Mova + YAPC::Russia".<br/><br/>Dates: 12-14 June 2010.
Place: Kiev, Ukraine.
Site: <a href="http://2010.yapcrussia.org>.<br">http://2010.yapcrussia.org>.<br</a><br/>It is the third Perl Mova (Ukrainian Perl workshop) and the third YAPC::Russia, which moves this year to Ukraine.<br/><br/>We will have three days, each for different things.<br/><br/>* 12 June. Hack meet. 
* 13 June. Talks day.
* 14 June. River trip. <br/><br/>While the first two days contain more or less standard Perl activities, hacking and speaking, on the third day we plan extraordinal Dnipro River Trip.<br/><br/>I've already hired the ship: <a href="http://yapcrussia.org/img/ekolog.jpg>. We will pass along Kiev riverside (which includes beautiful sightseeing of the right side of Kiev, including world-wide known domes of Lavra), and then go to the island somewhere in so called "Kiev sea". Trip continues from 10 am to 6 pm on Monday, 14th of June. <br">http://yapcrussia.org/img/ekolog.jpg>.

Conference's site is <a href="http://2010.yapcrussia.org>. It will be cool, and you may also feel of what we are going to propose for YAPC::Europe in 2011.<br">http://2010.yapcrussia.org>.

I am now in Kiev for a week holidays, and it is so nice here that I'd like to stay longer, until the conference.</p>
