<p>TwinCity Perl workshop was the last one I attended this year. So far, I was at 8 Perl workshops and YAPCs during 2008 (Jonathan wins with being at 10 events :-)<br/><br/>TwinCity was the most unique one I've ever seen. Not because it was 100th or 101st grassroots event, but also because it involved more people from the areas which were not covered by Perl events earlier (Slovakia, I mean). That is really great.<br/><br/>At the second day in Bratislava there were more people then during the first one (that's just my private non-scientific estimate, Domm and Jozef should know exact figures).<br/><br/>As always, after everything is finished, I regret that spent those days less efficient than I could, including chatting with people, more investigating the projects, not counting German and Slovak languages. <br/><br/>Unfortunately the weather was not shiny both days, and later at the day of hakathon, but that does not matter. Vienna airport, despite its free Wi-Fi, has left the feeling that there are two categories of people who are able to make wrong impression of the country and its inhabitants: these are embassies staff and officers at the control area in airports. Sometimes it is difficult not to propagate their behaviour to all the people who live in country. <br/><br/>Anyway, thanks a lot to the organizers, the event was really great, both venues were nice (including Jonathan's apartments for the hackathon), beer and food more than acceptable. In fact, I expected less good things :-) <br/><br/>Hope that the format of twin-event will be used in future.</p>
