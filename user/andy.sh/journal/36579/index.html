<p>This workshop was the first ever Perl workshop in Croatia. I was happy to be invited there. It was in April but I did not write about it (as well as about several other Perl events; I will cover them later).<br/><br/>The workshop was organized by local Zagreb.pm group with the help of HULK (<a href="linux.hr>) and HrOpen (<URL:open.hr>) and it was hosted at the Faculty of electrical engineering and computing (FER, <URL:fer.hr>) of the University of Zagreb. The date was chosen so that the workshop appears right before three days of DORC/CLUC conference.<br">linux.hr>) and HrOpen (<URL:open.hr>) and it was hosted at the Faculty of electrical engineering and computing (FER, <URL:fer.hr>) of the University of Zagreb. The date was chosen so that the workshop appears right before three days of DORC/CLUC conference.<br</a><br/>Website of the workshop was based on Act but appeared a bit late to attract more people. Anyhow there were 14 people registered (not much) butÃ¢â¬âif I am not mistakingÃ¢â¬âeveryone showed up (attendance of 100% is a great result and never achieved at lager events). The venue was so called "Black Auditorium" at FER, it was too large for the audience, but that does not matter.<br/><br/>I arrived in Zagreb in the evening before the workshop, and two of the organizers picked me up at the airport and moved to the hotel. A bit later we went to see the venue, and although it was 11 p.m. we were allowed to enter the faculty without any questions.<br/><br/>The workshop started in the morning of the next day. As I mentioned, there were 14 or 15 people. Very notable thing is that people from several counties came there. Most were from Zagreb, along with people from Bulgaria, United Kingdom, and me from Russia. It was additional pleasure that all talks were in English. Very cool for local event not to use local language even when there are not too much people from outside.<br/><br/>On the photos below people over 30 are depicted, yes, that is a real fact of current Perl world, but in the audience there were much younger people (which is good and means that Perl is in the field of interest for them).<br/><br/>Dobrica talked about his Perl-based emulation of old 8-bit processors. 
<a href="http://perlrussia.ru/ws/hrpw2008/3.jpg><br">http://perlrussia.ru/ws/hrpw2008/3.jpg><br</a><br/>Later the speed of emulator run at modern computer was compared with the prototype, which win :-)
<a href="http://perlrussia.ru/ws/hrpw2008/5.jpg><br">http://perlrussia.ru/ws/hrpw2008/5.jpg><br</a><br/>Vlatko (another organizer) had a talk "Perl usage in Penetration testing".
<a href="http://perlrussia.ru/ws/hrpw2008/6.jpg><br">http://perlrussia.ru/ws/hrpw2008/6.jpg><br</a><br/>Toni Prug came from the UK to talk about how to apply Perl for managing thousands of Wi-Fi routers.
<a href="http://perlrussia.ru/ws/hrpw2008/2.jpg><br">http://perlrussia.ru/ws/hrpw2008/2.jpg><br</a><br/>And I talked about new elements in Perl 5.10, and about how to tackle with a headache of Russian encodings (we have about 10 of them).<br/><br/>There was video recording and I am still waiting to see it somewhere online.
<a href="http://perlrussia.ru/ws/hrpw2008/4.jpg><br">http://perlrussia.ru/ws/hrpw2008/4.jpg><br</a><br/>I hope the event will not stop after that first time and will be annual. I am looking forward for HRPW 2009 already. I suggest the organizers to invite people from neighboring countries (at least from Serbia and other post-Ugoslavian countries).<br/><br/>Huge personal thanks for Vlatko Kosturjak, Dobrica Pavlinusic, Kristian Zimmer and Nikola Kapralevich for inviting me and organizing all the things I was very happy with. Separate thanks for the unknown hero who proposed to visit lakes and waterfalls.

<h2>It's was really a nice workshop</h2>

It's was really a nice workshop. Hopefully we'll have more of Perl stuff in Croatia. Although I'm quite familiar with new Perl 5.10 stuff, your talk about it was interesting, especially when combined with pictures of Zagreb (the DORS/CLUC version).
