<p>Short version: <a href="http://sayperl.org/">SayPerl.org</a> site launched. It provides English translations of Perl posts from around the world.<br/><br/>Long version:<br/><br/><a href="http://ironman.enlightenedperl.org/">Iron Man</a> and <a href="http://planetperl.ru/">PlanetPerl.ru</a> demonstrated that there are lots of Perl folks who write about Perl and you never heard of them.<br/><br/>Even more, on Iron Man we see lots of non-English posts, and those of us with non-native English usually can read only their native language and English. For example, lots of Japanese posts appear, and I can only see pieces of Perl code understandable there.<br/><br/>Copy-pasting post URLs into Google Translate on a daily basis is quite annoying. I catched myself at starting reading recent Italian posts about the forthcoming YAPC::Europe, and then switching to Google Translate, as I can't read much Italian yet. The same is with German. Both of them are more easily understandable than Japanese though :-)<br/><br/>Today I launched <a href="http://sayperl.org/">SayPerl.org</a> site which is a blog posts aggregator combined with automatic translator into English.<br/><br/>All posts, not depending on their original language, appear on SayPerl.org in English, thus I can now read all of them, including Japanese, Farsi and Chinese!<br/><br/>Of course, automatic translation is not yet perfect, but thanks to Google, it gives fast and suitable results, especially when the target is English.<br/><br/>To demonstrate advantages of SayPerl.org, compare these two posts, original and translated: <a href="http://img.onperl.ru/sayperl-fa.gif>. The word "Rakvdv", which looks as it would be written by ancient Romans, is clearly understandable now.<br">http://img.onperl.ru/sayperl-fa.gif>. The word "Rakvdv", which looks as it would be written by ancient Romans, is clearly understandable now.<br</a><br/>I will try to fix some issues and add more functionality to the site during the following weeks.<br/><br/>As for technical details, I only wish to mention yet another problem with handling Unicode. It happened with <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?WebService::Google::Language">WebService::Google::Language</a>. Such errors are one of the most common issues with Perl modules today (remember, for example, <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/kappa/journal/39707">another issue with Unicode arose</a> when Alex was coding PlanetPerl.ru).<br/><br/>Start using <a href="http://sayperl.org/">SayPerl.org</a> right now!</p>

<h2>Nice work!</h2>

<p>311 aggregated feeds is a bit too much for me to follow, but it's a good idea and a simple, clean design.  Too bad Japanese is so hard to machine-translate, though...</p>



<h2>Excellent!</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Ovid/">Ovid</a> on 2010-03-27T07:28:31</h3>
<p>Nice job.  It's interesting reading folks from around the world.</p><p>Out of curiosity, why include blogs already in English?  It's a lot more content, but as educated_foo pointed out, that's a lot to follow.</p>

<p>I grabbed all the links I found on IronMan and PlanetPerl, leaving language detection to Google.</p><p>But you may use <a href="http://sayperl.org/!en/" title="sayperl.org">sayperl.org/!en</a sayperl.org> to filter English.</p>
