<p>Rotating YAPC::Europe venue is simple. Well, it looks simple as long as you have 10-20 European capitals.<br/><br/>Rotating country-sized workshops seems to me a much harder task. It is much harder problem here in Russia. But I've got the solution: make more events per year :-) I'll explain.<br/><br/>Russia is a country whose length is more than six thousands kilometers. And if you include to this calculation our enclave, Kaliningrad, you obtain about eight thousands wide. Its height is more than three thousands kilometers, if not counting territory outside the continent north to the North pole.<br/><br/>Large distances cause difficulties in easy travelling between remote towns. No doubt that Perl users are located primarily in larger cities. When an event is hosted in one of them, you get lots of attendees from the city in hand, less from other major ones and negligibly small number from other towns.<br/><br/>Look at Germany, where Perl workshops change place during last seven years. It is very easy to get from Berlin to Erlangen. But it is much harder to get from Siberia to Moscow.<br/><br/>That is why I was very excited when Vladivostok.pm said at last that they decided to host a workshop. Yes, it will not be as large as workshop in Kiev, but it gives an opportunity to attend Perl event people who lives far from the capital.<br/><br/>Another two cities I am thinking about in my future plans are Rostov-On-Don and Saint-Petersburg. Both of them have at least one active guy who is strong enough to tackle with organization headache.<br/><br/>We are also happy to have at least two neighbouring countries where people understand and speak Russian. These are Ukraine and Belarus. Even more, Russian is second official language in Belarus.<br/><br/>There are already three PM-groups in these countries: Minsk.pm, the capital of Ukraine, Kiev.pm, the capital of Ukraine and newly born Odessa.pm, a city on the coast of the Black sea. <br/><br/>Earlier this year we had the first Ukrainian Perl workshop in Kiev, and next year I am going to move it to Odessa for once. Unlike Russia, travelling to Odessa from the capital is much easier. (But it is harder to travel there from Moscow, can you imagine that direct flight costs as expensive as a flight to Vladivostok!)

<h2>Vladivostok: Japanese hackers may be interested</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/mr_bean/">mr_bean</a> on 2008-06-10T07:55:23</h3>
Vladivostok is closer to Japan than Taiwan is.<br><br>Japanese perl hackers went to Taiwan for Taiwan's OSDC.tw conference in April, so they may be interested in going to Vladivostok too.<br><br>Even the Taiwanese hackers might be interested in going.
