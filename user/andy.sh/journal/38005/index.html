<p>Multiple blogs, better control of friends, allow anonymous responses, filtering responses, trackbacks, news aggregation, tagging, probably multimedia embedding (I know many would argue that point), source code coloring, richer HTML or other markup, etc.  Plus full individual customization to turn off annoying features we don't want (such as tons of useless JavaScript).</p><p>Basically, a site which looked like it's been invented some time in the past few years would be nice.

Marketing is evil and like Bill Hicks said to PR-guys: kill yourself. you satans little helper and there is no rational behind what you are doing.<br> <br>
but on the othe hand, its no marketing, to have a nice looking and usefull site with fresh content. while I understand jrockaway attitude, there lies no problem because such a site would not scare him away from perl, but he would appreciate it, when wie achieve something good. But perl noobs could be scared away, which raises the question what is it we have a site like use.perl for?
<br> <br>
perl.org is our directory, perlmonks the forum and knowledge base. I think it should be something in between some destilled know how from forums, where the state of the art perl is today and some possibilities to trakc recent delopements, so we also don't need to pollute perlmonks with so much release announcements.
<br> <br>
So back to action. i forewarded this question but so far no feedback from german folks. will push this issue a bit further.

<p>I reiterate Ovid's statement, marketing is not evil. There is good marketing and bad marketing, but dismissing it as evil is to miss the point entirely.</p><p>use.perl was an active and very current site when I joined, it's only real problem is that it doesn't have a dedicated active development team, in the way that PerlMonks has. The code is based on SlashCode and as far as I'm aware that's still the case. The data might not be available, but the code is there. Unfortunately no-one has felt moved to work on improving it and keeping up with the latest trends and features, at least not to the degree that everyone seems to be wanting these days.</p><p>Many other blog sites have come into being since and have embraced the world of AJAX, customisation, etc, because they've been designed that way from the beginning. Unfortunately use.perl was designed before all the new trends came along. Making it fashionable and evolving it requires a team of enthusiastic developers.</p><p>However, coming back to marketing, whether you like it or not a website is part of marketing. use.perl is part of the promotion of the Perl developer community. Currently everyone posting to use.perl is part of that community already, but they are a small part of the Perl user community as a whole. Now while the whole of the user community are unlikely to want to join use.perl and post to it, there are other things that can (and often do) feature on use.perl that would interest them as a reader. Presenting a website that doesn't provide them with a clear front page, or has a confusing navigation, is likely to put them off coming back and using the site as a valuable resource.</p><p>The collective wisdom on use.perl is a valuable resource that is largely hidden when you first view the site. It's only once you get involved that you become more aware of the discussions, ideas, thoughts, projects among many other things that reside here. Maybe use.perl only needs to reorganise the way it promotes it's content, possibly add some features that aid usability, but it also needs someone to do it<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

If that's true, and I'm not convinced it is any more, use.perl.org is the defacto perl news site. There are others, such as Perl Buzz but this place is "blessed" by www.perl.org.<br/><br/>The question is - would pudge be open to collaborations to improve this site? - if not, any discussion about improving it is wasted.

Yes, it's not listed under "Community", it's in the news feed.<br/><br/>Part of this whole perception issue that is so baffling to me is that people, including you, seem to think that a listing on a perl.org site somehow makes the site more valuable.  We need to get away from this image of the Ivory Tower of perl.org.<br/><br/>Let's let 1,000 flowers bloom!

No matter what we here "suggest", most of the first time Perl users go the the page that comes up first when searching perl in google. That page is www.perl.org<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.. as it should be.

However, the problem is that perl.org is almost as ugly as this site.

I really would like help with that situation, but as with most of the current Perl community, good interface-, visual- and/or content-design is not my strength. Perl Foundation should put a bigger effort in to this.

As I've said in another posting, Perl has more than enough everything else, except good marketing. Making it even better is necessary and exiting but the marketing requires a serious priority now!

<p>This is the difficulty with the JFDI culture.  The people who have done the work are not required to continue doing it or to maintain the sites.  This means many of us have no idea who is in charge of any given site or what it would take to make some changes to it (do you need to hack on slash, combust, etc.  Can you get svn access or is it git now, and how much effort does it take to get one change onto the site?)  For any small change, the effort of figuring out who to send it to and getting it to happen is going to be far bigger than the actual change.</p><p>This also makes it difficult to put monetary donations to work, and in general we need a widespread amount of frequent, small changes (the sort of thing where it is efficient to have one person able to do+manage it all, which becomes a full time position.)  Currently, the Perl Foundation doesn't have any paid positions, but perhaps it should.</p>

I think JFDI can not apply here. I (or preferably anybody else from the community with some visual design talent) could easily prepare a new layout for this site, for example (yes, there is one proposal in this discussion thread also), but I don't see it's possible to just prepare a complete new marketing strategy for *.perl.org and send it to a webmaster (or volunteer him/her self to make the changes).</p><p><div class="quote"><p>This also makes it difficult to put monetary donations to work, and in general we need a widespread amount of frequent, small changes (the sort of thing where it is efficient to have one person able to do+manage it all, which becomes a full time position.)

Most visible part is to modernize the *.perl.org sites, starting from the visual appearance but also content and everything has to be organized better. I think this is preparing for the Perl 6, since we need the audience and should start building the premises for that. Looking from this perspective, couldn't some part of the Ian Hague grants used for this purpose?</p><p>I'm also starting to realize that discussing this on the comments of some journal entries is not the best way. Discussion gets very easily distracted and it's very hard to follow it. Is there a mailinglist or another forum that should be used? I see that there's a lot a interest for this makeover to happen, but people get very easily lost..</p>
