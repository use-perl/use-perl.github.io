<p><p>Today was mostly code review, but I sneaked in some extra fixes to the tests I was writing yesterday.
</p><p>
ladynik0n gave me a teapot! I walked home with it. People were staring at me from cars and pointing.
</p><p>
We don't owe the state any taxes.

I worked quite hard on the way home on a project to make it easy to edit benefit flows. <a href="http://spectrum.myriadcolours.com/user/marnanel/ebony-2.xml">This is what I've got so far, if you want to play.</a> You need a browser that can do SVG (Opera, recent Firefox, IE with a plugin, or Safari from CVS); if you don't have one, don't worry about it.
</p><p>
In the "what <em>were</em> they <em>thinking</em>?" department, here's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0425148696">a book review from Amazon</a>:<blockquote>Someone in Rev. Lucas Holt's rundown, Austin, Texas parish has chosen to ensure God's vengeance by dispensing his own brand of justice... this serial killer has selected his victims based on the words of a hymn... Holt, an attractive middle-aged Episcopalian priest, was assigned to the down-in-the-chalice church of St. Margaret's; his sadistic bishop relishes the church's demise and that of its unconventional shepherd as well. Does the Bishop also realize that Holt exudes sex appeal to a variety of women: his church secretary, hookers, an aspiring female politician and not the least, a lady from his own past--tough police Lieutenant Granger... <strong>Himself a priest,</strong> (my emphasis) the author has endowed his long-suffering but oversexed protagonist with great intuitive sleuthing abilities.</blockquote>Clearly, we're dealing with the Rev. Mary Sue here.

Firinel made lovely breaded fried tomatoes and aubergines for dinner. While I was helping cook, I was talking to Riordon.<br>
Me: Well, you have some Scottish blood.<br>
Rio: Because Daddy Alex is part Scottish?<br>
Me: And not only that, but you have some Welsh blood too.<br>
Rio: Because some people in your family are Welsh?<br>
Fin: That's a strange use of the word "blood".<br>
Me: Why?<br>
Fin: Usually, people use it to mean biological parentage.<br>
Me: Oh! Do you know, I completely forgot.<br>
Fin: What's funny is that you were assuming Rio inherits genes from both her <em>fathers</em>.
</p><p>
I made another unsuccessful attempt to get on planet.gnome.org. I was told that the only requirement needed was a GNOME CVS account, which I have, but when I asked to be added, everything went silent again. I'll ask again in a week or so.
</p><p>
desh came up and told me that he has reason to pester everyone in the Systems team except me. So we'll have to find something for him to pester me about, too. I hope it's not Joule breaking or something.</p></p>
