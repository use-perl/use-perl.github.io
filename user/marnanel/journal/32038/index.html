<p><a href="http://www.livejournal.com/poll/?id=643792&qid=1&mode=ans">What people suggested for resolutions last year</a>; I didn't do any of them except "find a church" (actually, I found two).
<br><br>
<b>In January 2006</b>, <a href="http://marnanel.livejournal.com/743189.html">went to see A+J</a>; got discouraged writing translation code; went to the philly-poly pubmeet; <a href="http://marnanel.livejournal.com/752084.html">spirit butter</a>; got taught to knit by a random traveller on the train; <a href="http://marnanel.livejournal.com/753857.html">I didn't get glaucoma</a>; helped redecorate at ArtSphere; held a "teach-in" about Unix at the Wooden Shoe; was attempting to write a 6502 emulator in Perl; first visited St Gabriel's; two obvious depressive episodes.
<br><br>
<b>In February 2006</b>, I attempted to fix my first GnomeLove bug, <a href="http://marnanel.livejournal.com/772613.html">but failed</a>; tried to fix my second, <a href="http://cvs.gnome.org/viewcvs/metacity/src/display.c?rev=1.277&view=markup">and succeeded</a>; fixed <a href="http://marnanel.livejournal.com/789421.html">many other bugs</a> over the <a href="http://blogs.gnome.org/view/newren/2006/02/26/0">course</a> of the month; it snowed a lot; made pancakes; got ashy.
<br><br>
<b>In March 2006</b>, I was given GNOME CVS access; <a href="http://marnanel.livejournal.com/807052.html">I measured out my life with kitten toes</a>; had a review at work which was rather positive; <a href="http://firinel.livejournal.com/1934747.html">went to the Rodin museum</a>.
<br><br>
<b>In April 2006</b>, we went to visit Sarah in Cleveland; I figured out a really spiffy perl test system at work; <a href="http://marnanel.livejournal.com/826758.html">for night can only hide, and not destroy</a>; I switched to Ubuntu from Debian; Sharon got a job in Philly so I didn't need to catch the bus any more; <a href="http://marnanel.livejournal.com/835649.html">the free tax filing project was announced</a> (things have changed a bit since then, though); <a href="http://marnanel.livejournal.com/832515.html">someone made a fan site for the adventure game I coded in 1995</a>.
<br><br>
<b>In May 2006</b>, I was interviewed by a Welsh TV company and I confirmed that my spoken Welsh is indeed rather bad because of the lack of conversation partners here; I visited St Mark's for the first time; I switched to gmail; I made a gtk BBC Micro emulator up to the point where it booted and then dropped the project for something more urgent.
<br><br>
<b>In June 2006</b>, I was added to Planet GNOME, and so I started making day posts generally public; <a href="http://marnanel.livejournal.com/857865.html">we went on an interfaith walk</a> (which was my first pgo post); we <a href="http://marnanel.livejournal.com/862306.html">went to the beach</a>, where it was cloudy, and played pool; it was first seriously suggested by a psychologist that I might have Asperger syndrome; I was interviewed for another position in my company, and we both decided I would be much better doing what I was currently doing anyway; Rio learned some C; her goldfish died; <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marnanel/202385111/">I discovered my highest priority</a>; <a href="http://marnanel.livejournal.com/885285.html">will programming exist on high with Thee?</a>
<br><br>
<b>In August 2006</b>, Sarah came over and we all went to the naked beach; <a href="http://marnanel.livejournal.com/896671.html">I tried to write an englyn</a> (I know <em>now</em> it should be aaaa); after several visits with different psychologists I was <a href="http://marnanel.livejournal.com/900682.html">finally diagnosed with (mild) AS</a>; <a href="http://marnanel.livejournal.com/901224.html">my youngest sister got back in contact</a>.
<br><br>
<b>In September 2006</b>, I started an englyn (<i>Does dim bara o dan y tir Ã¢â¬â mae d&#373;r / a cherrig ac aur gwir...</i>) which I haven't yet finished; Fin went to visit Sarah; I took over maintaining fast-user-switch-applet; we completely rethought translation at work and I became much more confident about looking after it; I started UVB treatment for psoriasis.
<br><br>
<b>In October 2006</b>, Rio was baptised; metacity-theme-2 was released; blueskywonder visited; I became infected with MRSA; pinkstuff crashed; Rio was a fantastic bluebird in the Halloween parade; I put up the first coloured lights at work (which has now escalated to something looking like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Blackpool_tower_and_illuminations.jpg">Blackpool in the autumn</a>).
<br><br>
<b>In November 2006</b>, <a href="http://marnanel.livejournal.com/927497.html">I made a Welsh spellcheck for Firefox</a>; <a href="http://marnanel.livejournal.com/932617.html">I visited Sarah</a>; <a href="http://marnanel.livejournal.com/935619.html">a squirrel visited us</a>; <a href="http://marnanel.livejournal.com/928811.html">I was admitted to the GNOME foundation</a>; <a href="http://marnanel.livejournal.com/928744.html">we let off fireworks</a> for Bonfire Night; <a href="http://marnanel.livejournal.com/929277.html">I volunteered as a nonpartisan election observer</a>; <a href="http://marnanel.livejournal.com/932231.html">we went to the art museum</a>; <a href="http://marnanel.livejournal.com/935401.html">I was mistaken for a priest</a>.
<br><br>
<b>In December 2006</b>, it was mostly quiet, since I was working very hard on getting the tax thing released. But Sarah came to visit us; krasota and explodingcat visited; A+J came and we climbed Hawk Mountain.</p>
