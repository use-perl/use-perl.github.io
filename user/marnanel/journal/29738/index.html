<p>We woke late for a weekday but early for a Saturday, because it was time to go up to <a href="http://www.shuppsgrove.com/">Shupp's Grove</a> and help out with SaraMae's stand: they needed Fin to help out with power tools setting up the electrical supply. Rio stayed to run her own table today with them today and made $3. She is very proud of this.
<br><br>
When we came back I tried to compile GNOME again so I could work more on Metacity next week. It all fell quite easily into place.
<br><br>
I set up a myspace account because I was curious what all the fuss was about. I still don't know. It looks like just another blogging site with some social networking features.
<br><br>
I finally got VoIP working, and had a long talk with my father.
<br><br>
Rio and I went to the park, and met a little girl called Juanita, and her father, Abdul. Abdul and his wife both work at the shop round the corner, so I'd met them before, but never to talk to (it's hard to chat to people in a shop when they're working). He asked me about England, and told me he wants to visit Stonehenge one day. "My parents-in-law are in England," he said, "but we don't talk because I'm a Muslim." "How does that work out?" I asked. "Well," he said, "every time they talk to me they try to convert me to Christianity." I think it sounds like being as pushy as they're being is the worst thing they could be doing if they want him to hear more about Jesus, actually.
<br><br>
We had Chinese for dinner, since we didn't on Friday. I realised that most weeks we all get a different order and then Rio's leftovers go in the fridge, even though she gets a small, and then they often go bad. So today I ordered nothing, and ate the remainder of Riordon's food, and there was no waste.</p>
