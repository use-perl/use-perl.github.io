<p>As I mentioned earlier, I hacked BBC Micro stuff on the train. I got into work early, and refactored that piece of code I told you about where I'd tried to be too clever. I'm quite glad of the way it works, now.
<br><br>
Later, we spent most of the morning planning the new iteration, Iteration Zhoosh. I'd suggested the name before Iteration Zho, but that's because I'd never heard of a zho (which is because I'm not a Scrabble player), but I'd heard plenty about zhooshing, which is <a href="http://www.chris-d.net/polari/">Polari</a> for "beautify" or "comb". Hence the topic in the chatroom:<blockquote>(2006-05-30 10:53:24) ***Alec of the Wood has set the topic to: As feely homies..we would zhoosh our riahs, powder our eeks, climb into our bona new drag, don our batts and troll off to some bona bijou bar.</blockquote>At lunchtime I went to the 12:10 service at <a href="http://www.saintmarksphiladelphia.org/">St Mark's</a>, where I <em>was</em> the congregation.
<br><br>
<center><b><big>Hello</big><br>
<small>My name is</small></b><br>
<big><i>the congregation</i></big></center>
<br><br>
During private prayer afterwards I was struck by an insight about my life, which I'm still thinking over, though like a dream it might lose a lot by being put into words. Maybe I could make a sonnet of it or something. Anyway, I don't want to write about it here, but maybe I should start a Bible study / prayer journal. I'm not sure whether I should leave it readable to a list of people who want to see it or just to me. Your opinions on this are appreciated.
<br><br>
In the afternoon, I tried to solve a big UTF-8 problem, but barely got it put together by the time it was time to leave.
<br><br>
I hacked a <em>small</em> amount on the BBC Micro emulator on the train. The reason I didn't debug more was the one line<blockquote><code>EmulatorPC += ( signed char )( *EmulatorPC++ );</code></blockquote>(EmulatorPC is char*.) Now, for those of you who know a little C but not much, that DOES NOT increment what EmulatorPC points to (which is good, since it points at machine code). Instead, it
<br><br>
1) takes what EmulatorPC points at<br>
2) increments EmulatorPC<br>
3) adds the number we found in 1) to EmulatorPC
<br><br>
You might THINK that this was legal C, because addition is commutative, but it IS NOT, and it DOES NOT WORK. Except it does. gcc doesn't complain about it at all. But part of what I needed to do involved changing EmulatorPC from auto to static, and then all hell broke loose and the program didn't run. Debugging virtual machines is no fun at all.
<br><br>
There was so much traffic on the road that the power went out on my laptop before we got home. I spent the rest of the time reading <a href="http://itech.fgcu.edu/faculty/wohlpart/alra/gilman.htm"><cite>The Yellow Wallpaper</cite></a>, which is very interesting and enjoyable, and I'll post my thoughts on it later.
<br><br>
Sharon has an ending date for her job. I see buses in my future.
<br><br>
Fin made a gorgeous tofu salad. I wish I could tell you how good it was. It was <em>good</em>. Rio and I went out and swung on the swings afterwards and talked about things.
<br><br>
I have a big plan about learning Welsh, which I'll post more about when I know more, in the next few days.
<br><br>
I was delighted to discover that two people think I'm a journeyer on <a href="http://advogato.org/person/marnanel/">Advogato</a>. I like being part of big projects.
<br><br>
It occurs to me that I didn't tell you people what the myspace account I'd set up was. It's <a href="http://myspace.com/marnanel">here</a>. Friend me if you like, or don't. I'm not particularly impressed with the system, but there must be <em>something</em> in it, because there are millions of people using it. On the other hand, you could say the same about Windows.</p>
