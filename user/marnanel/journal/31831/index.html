<div class="span8">
<p>Many good things happened today.
<ul>
<li>We had something to fix at work. We discussed the ideal way to fix it, which would have meant overtime and stuff. I came up with Plan B, which people thought was a bad one, and then Plan C, which people thought was promising. Then when other people went to lunch and I went out to get chocolate, I was hit with Plan D; I ran back and told people I could find, and to my relief they all said it was a very good one. I think it may have saved us a week's work or more, and deadlines are coming towards us fast now, so this is a good thing.</li>
<li>Fin made muffins. Aunt Cindy made pineapple upside-down cake. They were both very good. Also, we had chili for tea, and I had a new kind of hot sauce on it, which was lovely.</li>
<li>I finally decided to do something with <a href="https://launchpad.net/people/marnanel">my launchpad account</a>, and joined the <a href="https://launchpad.net/people/desktop-bugs">Ubuntu Desktop Bugs</a> team, since so many of metacity's bugs come from there. Also, it's because I run Ubuntu anyway and so I'd like to help out a bit where I can. If you run Ubuntu and you'd like to help out with coding or graphics or docs or testing, maybe you should do similarly.</li>
<li>I had the sort of job offer which you are very flattered to receive. I won't be going, because I think I'm needed where I am, but it was a happy thing.</li>
<li>Our HR person confirmed that a perk of my job is that hospital bills are settled in full by the company. This means that the bill which we received for firinel's stay in hospital last month will not be a problem for us, which is good because it was more than the cost of a trip to England. Just one reason I love the place I work.</li>
<li>My new CPAN module almost works well enough to upload it (I'll tell you what it is when it's ready, which may be tomorrow). I have delayed the release somewhat by refactoring something important, and I still need to formalise the tests.</li>
<li>Happy conversations with firinel and moominmuppet.</li>
</ul><br/><br/>It did sadden me, though, that today was the day where a <a href="http://cynnerth.livejournal.com/2159978.html">building</a> near a friend of mine <a href="http://cynnerth.livejournal.com/2161376.html">collapsed</a> and killed three, and on the day when that guy in Oregon, whom I'd been hoping for, <a href="http://firinel.livejournal.com/2133908.html">was found dead</a>. This has made today a solemn one; it reminds me of the shortness and fragility of life, and that we need to live to the full to honour those who die. In particular, it reminds me to tell you all that I'm very glad you're around, and in particular and in no particular order and among others I'd like to mention riordon, moominmuppet, firinel, onib, machineplay, naltrexone, and floatyfish. You people are irreplaceable. Thank you for sharing your lives with me.</p>
