<li><a href="http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/sbdb.cgi?sstr=14024;orb=0;cov=0">(it's true!)</a></li>
<li>Today was a day of fixing lots of little bugs. We had a company meeting (which was alarmingly originally scheduled to run between "12/20/06 11:00 AM EDT" and "12/26/07 11:45 AM EDT"&mdash; imagine the beauty and majesty of a 53-week meeting!) where we discovered among other things that we're all getting a 2% cost of living increase. I thought 2% wasn't very much until I realised it's 2% more than I'm getting and all the bills are already paid, so it's a bit more money every month and nothing particularly to spend it on. Yay.)</li>
<li>I went to the Shoe to buy Firinel a present, and it cost $10, and I had $10 and some pennies. There is tax on books in Pennsylvania. The staffer gave me a quarter. Sometimes people's little kindnesses amaze me.</li>
<li>The other day I went to Chinatown to buy some tea for plexq. The only directions I had were "turn north at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paifang">arch</a> and go down Tenth Street until you find a shop which looks like it only stocks pocky." I am pleased that these were sufficient instructions.</li>
<li><a href="http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/this_britain/article2091881.ece">"Essentially what we have here is an immaculate conception..."</a> but only if you have <em>absolutely no idea</em> what the words "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immaculate_Conception">immaculate conception</a>" refer to. (Clue: there was a human father involved.)</li>
<li>I have been hacking around with the Metacity compositor, as promised. I have successfully #ifdefd out the bling, and added a bunch of comments (I'll check it in in a few minutes). Currently there are two major problems: on startup (rather than during regular use, in my experience) it sometimes <a href="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=385699">makes some windows invisible</a> until you minimise and restore them (it seems to be sensitive to the window configuration, and having Firefox open seems to make it more likely; the invisible windows *are* getting mapped); and <a href="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=387761">it segfaults when you replace it</a>. Currently you have to enable the compositor at configure time, and then you get a gconf key you have to turn on. When these have been fixed it might be good enough to enable by default (though people should probably still have to turn it on with gconf for now).</li>
<li>To the person who said they'd like to buy me stuff for fixing the compositor: thank you, I'm very grateful for the thought&mdash; but shouldn't you be buying it for S&ouml;ren who did most of the work? (Then again, I suppose he was paid. :) )</li>
<li>Today's Film Clip I Rather Like: <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=9uSiyn7t_0o">6A's holiday video</a>. Rather funny. They need to do something about the sound, though.</li>
