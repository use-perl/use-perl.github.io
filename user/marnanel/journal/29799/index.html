<div class="span8">
<p>Today was the day that my journal first appeared on <a href="http://planet.gnome.org/">planet.gnome.org</a>, so hello to those of you reading it there. I'm Thomas, poet, would-be linguist, and programmer; I'm from Cambridge in England and I live in the suburbs of Philadelphia with my partner <a href="http://firinel.org/">Firinel</a> (Fin for short) and our daughter Riordon, who are both awesome people I'm lucky to have in my life. I work for an organisation that does <a href="http://www.citypaper.net/articles/2006-04-06/cb.shtml">awesome things</a>. If you want to know more about who and where and why I am, you should read my <a href="http://marnanel.livejournal.com/profile">bio on LiveJournal</a>.
<br><br>
I am feeling <em>so much</em> better today. I must have slept for over twelve hours on Friday, and today I woke up feeling almost back to normal. When I came down to check my email I found a cup of coffee waiting beside my keyboard. Did I mention that Firinel is an awesome person?
<br><br>
SaraMae and Sharon (Fin's grandmother and mother) wanted us to go out to <a href="http://pottstowndiner.com/">the diner</a> with them, so we sat and drank tea and ate croissants. A while ago, someone somewhere on LJ was saying that French prosody doesn't really map to English ideas of where the stress lies in a word, and that when a French word is loaned into English, British English tends to stress the first syllable (BAL-lay) and American English the second (bal-LAY). I don't know enough about prosody to know whether this is true, but I present the anecdotal evidence of my very English attempt to order a croissant in America:
<br><br>
Me: I'll have a croissant, please.<br>
Waitress: Go ahead.<br>
(long pause)<br>
Me: Um, what are we waiting for?<br>
Waitress: I thought you said you had a question.<br>
Me: No, no, a croissant.<br>
Waitress: Oh, a croisSANT.
<br><br>
Later we came home, I did some washing up, and we briefly went to <a href="http://www.zerns.com/">the sale</a>. We didn't see any kittens, though.
<br><br>
I believe I fixed <a href="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=114305">metacity bug 114305</a> today (removing old dead code to do with menu icons). This is part of a much bigger project to <a href="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=102547">revise the entire theme format</a>, which is about half done. I would have been almost done by now, but I broke my laptop a few weeks ago. (I have to say that <a href="http://www.solutionsforprogress.com/">the people I work for</a> were extremely good with helping fix it, and deserve heaps of kudos.)
<br><br>
My current pet project is a port of <a href="http://www.cloud9.co.uk/james/BBCMicro/Xbeeb/">xbeeb</a> to GTK. It's tentatively called gbeeb, at least unless <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/poll/?id=738666">enough people decide</a> it should be called plasticdaffodil. There are still a million things to fix, but I think it's now good enough to do an 0.01 release, so I'll try and get onto that, but first I'll need to learn a lot more about how to set a program up with autotools: I'll dig around and see if I can find a primer anywhere. Thanks to all of you who've expressed interest in testing or playing with it; if anyone else is interested, <a href="http://marnanel.livejournal.com/857772.html?mode=reply">let me know</a>. (If you don't have an LJ account, you can leave an anonymous comment.)
<br><br>
I've lost about eight pounds in about a week, quite possibly because I didn't eat much on Friday. I don't think this is anything to worry about; I'll probably get it back soon enough.
<br><br>
If any of you are going on the <a href="http://www.pjvoice.com/v6/eventinfo.asp?EventNum=413">Philly Interfaith Walk for Peace and Reconciliation</a>, we might see you there. Either way, peace to you all.</p>
