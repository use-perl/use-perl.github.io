<li>It's been a happy weekend shared with our beloved Moominmuppet who came to spend a few days with us. It's always good to see her. We didn't do very much other than snuggle up and watch films together, but that's a good way to spend a weekend in December!</li>
<li><a href="http://search.cpan.org/user/marnanel/DateTime-Calendar-Liturgical-Christian-0.02/lib/DateTime/Calendar/Liturgical/Christian.pm">New version</a> of DateTime::Calendar::Liturgical::Christian up: this just fixes the prerequisites, rather than adding any new code. If you know much about the calendar of the Orthodox, Roman Catholic or Lutheran churches, I still want to hear from you.</li>
<li>BBC News has had a lead story up for most of this evening about <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/6188465.stm">the decision</a> of two Virginia congregations to split away from the Episcopal Church, ignore the Windsor Report, and make public their support for the &uuml;ber-homophobic Church of 
<a href="http://www.anglican-nig.org/PH2006message2nation.htm">"we encourage prohibiting the legality of homosexuality"</a> Nigeria. I don't see why this is such big news, really. Everyone knew they were going to vote that way, and it's sad that they feel the need to ally themselves with people with such opinions, but it's not like they're anywhere near a majority in the church. Heck, it's not like they're anywhere near a majority in that <em>diocese</em>. It's happened a thousand times before: they will leave, and there will be arguments about it, and then we will get on with living out the good news in the world.</li>
<li>I picked up my knitting needles for the first time in months. I thought I'd start again with something easy, so I'm making a scarf for Riordon's doll Tiffany.</li>
<li>We went with SaraMae and Sis to get their Christmas trees, from a Christmas tree farm out in the middle of nowhere somewhere near Collegeville. You have to ride in a wagon pulled by two draught horses to get to the trees, and when you ride the wagon back they give out hot chocolate or (what Americans call) cider. It's lovely.</li>
<li><a href="http://mail.gnome.org/archives/desktop-devel-list/2006-December/msg00145.html">Someone posted to d-d-l requesting a compositor in Metacity!</a> For those who don't know, Metacity has had most of a compositor for a while; S&ouml;ren wrote a lot of it, but he's since been reassigned to other duties. I am turning over the idea in my head of disabling most of the code, just leaving in (say) drop shadows and minimise/restore animations, and then releasing it with that turned on. Then we can re-enable new parts as we ensure they work. Who thinks this is a good or bad idea?</li>
