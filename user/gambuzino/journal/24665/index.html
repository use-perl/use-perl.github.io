<p>(This entry is cross-posted from my personal weblog at <URL:http://nowhereland.nunonunes.org/archives/2005/05/a_better_flickr.html>)


<p>Sooo... Last night Tuxa went to a farewell dinner she and her friends threw for a colleague and I was left home alone without the usual many urgent things to do, so I took a stab at the Flickr modules I'm starting to write.</p>

<p>And now I'm trying to decide which is the better approach to take.</p>

<p>One possible approach would be to create a Flickr object which has a method for each of the <a href="http://flickr.com/services/api/">Flickr API</a> calls, such as <em>$flickr-&gt;photos_getInfo</em> or <em>$flickr-&gt;people_findByEmail</em> and so on.<br />
The object should then return a hash structure that closely resembles the documented result for that call, so for example the <em>$flickr-&gt;photos_getInfo</em> method (described <a href="http://flickr.com/services/api/flickr.photos.getInfo.html">here</a>) should return something along the lines of the following:</p>
<pre>
{
  id => "2733",
  secret => "123456",
  server => "12",
  isfavorite => "0",
  license => "3",
  rotation => "90",
  owner => {
             nsid => "12037949754@N01",
             username => "Bees",
             realname => "Cal Henderson",
             location => "Bedford, UK",
           },
  title => "orford_castle_taster",
  description => "hello!",
  visibility => {
                  ispublic => "1",
                  isfriend => "0",
                  isfamily => "0",
                },
  dates => {
             posted => "1100897479",
             taken => "2004-11-19 12:51:19",
             takengranularity="0",
           },
  permissions => {
                   permcomment="3",
                   permaddmeta="2",
                 },
  editability => {
                   cancomment="1",
                   canaddmeta="1",
                 },
  comments => 1,
  notes => [
             {
               id => "313",
               author => "12037949754@N01",
               authorname => "Bees",
               x => "10",
               y="10",
               w="50",
               h="50",
               content => "foo",
             },
           ],
  tags => [
            {
              id => "1234",
              author => "12037949754@N01"
              raw => "woo yay",
              content => "wooyay",
            },
            {
              id => "1235",
              author => "12037949754@N01",
              raw="hoopla",
              content => "hoopla",
            },
          ],
}
</pre>

<p>This kind of approach appeals to me because it gives me access to just the plain data, in a easy way, without all the XML-parser-generated-cruft, in a much more "perlish" way.</p>

<p>But while I consider this an improvement over the current <em>Flickr::API</em> module (which is great, by the way, and will be used as the foundation for all of this), it may still be too low-level for many people to use.</p>

<p>So there is another possible approach (OK, there are <em>many</em> other possible approaches but I'm focusing one on in particular) ;-) which is to create a set of higher-level objects which represent an entity like a "person" or a "photo" or a "photoset".</p>

<p>Then the user would simply ask the object to instantiate, say, the Flickr user whose email is something@somesuch (using <em>flickr.people.findByEmail</em> on the background) or the photo whose id is someid (using <em>flickr.photos.getInfo</em>). Then, if the user wanted some more information on the photo, for example, she could ask for the lens aperture used (<em>$photo-&gt;apperture()</em>) and the object would fetch the EXIF information for the photo in question (using <em>flickr.photos.getExif</em>), load it into the <em>$photo</em> object and return the information.<br />
A major point to make here is that the object would fetch information in a "lazy" manner, so as to limit the number of interactions it has to have with the Flickr server.</p>

<p>My immediate needs are more than adequately met by the first approach to the modules and, therefore, I guess I'll surely implement them right now, but the second approach could be very interesting indeed...<br />
But then, now that I think about it in a more structured way, the second way depends on the first one to process all the results from the raw API and convert them into useful data, so I may well end up implementing it too in the future...</p>

<p>What I haven't figured out just yet is which name-space to use.<br />
Should I go for <em>Flickr::API::Methods</em> (as in <em>Flickr::API::Methods::people_findByEmail()</em> or <em>Flickr::API::Methods::photos_getInfo()</em>)?<br />
Or maybe go for <em>Flickr::Tools</em>...<br />
Or I could go with <em>Flickr::Photos</em> (<em>Flickr::Photos::getInfo()</em> for instance), <em>Flickr::People</em> (<em>Flickr::People::findByUsername()</em>). Actually I think I like this last version best...</p>

<p>As for the higher-level modules I'm not entirely convinced they should even be in the Flickr namespace at all... But then I don't have to decide on it just yet so let's see what my mind is aimed at when I get to it.</p>

<p>If anyone reading this has any kind of comment, remark, idea, suggestion or tough about the subject I really would appreciate the feedback.</p></p>
