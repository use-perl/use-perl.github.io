<p>Dear Log,<br />
<br />
It seems that ActiveState's Komodo (I use it as a perl editor) doesn't like me anymore. I was trying to download a series of http-files using <code>LWP::UserAgent</code> but I always got a 501 http-error returned when I requested the second file.<br />
<br />
Having tested and debugged my file as careful as possible I opted to take the file home from work and give it a try on my PowerBook which runs on Mac OS X.<br />
The BIG surprise: It worked like it was supposed to work.<br /><br />
Once I was back at work I just did run the perl script from the command-line and the result was astonishing: The script didn't break! Once i did run in it again from Komodo the error appeared again.<br /><br />
So... after ridding myself of Komodo, my question is: Which Editors are out there and usable on a windows system? For my Mac I usually use Vi/Vim/BBEdit.<br />
<br />
Perl 5.8/ActiveState's Komodo 2.3<br />

<h2>Editors</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/RobertX/">RobertX</a> on 2003-06-18T18:04:14</h3>
I use 2. One is ViM and the other is SciTE. I have both customized to do stuff without leaving the editor. Never had a problem with either. SciTE is easier to customize but ViM lets you do just about anything.



<h2>OpenPerl IDE</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/djberg96/">djberg96</a> on 2003-06-18T19:07:24</h3>
The best Perl editor/debugger for Windows is IMHO OpenPerl IDE which you can find at http://open-perl-ide.sourceforge.net/.
<p>
A newer option on the scene is to use Eclipse with the Perl plugins.</p>

Unless it has changed. I didn't like that fact that even if you are creating 1 file it creates a project file. I don't need it to be doing that.<br/><br/>Has it changed? Is it being actively developed?

Sorry to hear that Komodo doesn't like you anymore!  I'd love it if you could send me the key bits of your script so that I could reproduce the problem, and ideally fix it for the next release.<br/><br/>We're trying hard to make it the best Perl IDE out there -- help us do that by filing bugs (our bugzilla is down for a couple of hours due to a drive failure, but that should be fixed very soon).<br/><br/>Cheers,<br/><br/>--david ascher

David, I posted the bug under Bug # 25845.<br>
<br>
For everyone else willing to take a look at the perl code... just send me your e-mail address and I will reply with the code.<br>Thanks.<nobr> <wbr></nobr><strong>/neuroball/</strong>

A shareware app, that suits me fine. It has loads of user submitted template, syntax and completion files for all kinds of languages. It does colour highlighting too.
</p><p>
But the best bit for me is the regex engine. It'll do grep across the current selection, file, files loaded or within directories, and sed across any file loaded. Also when you click a line in the search results pane, the app will automatically load the file (if not already loaded) and put the cursor on the first character of your search. A handy way to jump between files.
</p><p>
Well I like it<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)</p>



<h2>Emacs - of course</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/htoug/">htoug</a> on 2003-07-07T13:17:36</h3>
Emacs is <b>the</b> editor. Comes complete with syntax-colourer, debugger interface, WWW-browser and probably also templating system.<p>
It runs on a wide variety of platforms, (nearly) all Un*x flavours (incl OS-X) and Win32.</p><p>
There is a quite steep learning curve, but once you are up and running, it gives a nice productivity boost - IMHO.</p>

<i> There is a quite steep learning curve</i>
<p>
???  Between tab-completion for commands, apropos help, and the way it flashes key combinations in the minibar when you use the full "M-x command-name" to which they are bound, it seems to me that Emacs has one of the shallowest (if longest) learning curves around.  Of course, my main point of comparison is Vi, which has to be about the least newbie-friendly editor alive (unless you count "ed", "THE STANDARD... text editor").
</p><p>
Find a regular Emacs user, steal his/her config file, and you're good to go.
