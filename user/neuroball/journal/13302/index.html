<p>My, my, my,<br />
<br />
It's around 1.40 in the morning and I am sitting here reading use Perl; and writing in my Journal. What the hell is wrong with me that I am unable to sleep the first night in a new bed/location?<br />
<br />
I had the same problem during the very long train ride of around 34h from San Diego up the coast to Portland. Knowing that I was unable to sleep I got my bed made around 6pm and finally met morpheus around 12pm.<br />
<br />
Next to this I had a lot of time to study Perl 6 Essentials the newest Perl book from O'Reilly as of wednesday (or so)... and liked what I learned about Perl 6. Now I just have to learn Parrot-ASM (it's just 18 years ago since I used ASM the last time)... and then I can hopefully help the Perl 6 porters/rewritters.<br />
<br />
So... for now I think I better hit the pillow again, otherwise I will do the same today (at 8.45am) that I did last year at Lincoln Stein's talk... taking short naps. D'oh. But still, I learned a lot and even bought his tome (sp??).<br />
<br />
Hope I will have a better stamina this year around. BTW. Lincoln, there was nothing wrong with your talk...<br /></p>
