<p>Here's Yet Another Bad Practice That Makes Me Wince Every Time I See It:<br/><br/>when people use <i>setup</i> as a verb, when they should write <i>set up</i> -- two words.<br/><br/>Other things are similar, but not quite as ubiquitous.  E.g. "everyday", as in the ridiculous "floss your teeth everyday".<br/><br/>And WTF is up with "albeit"?  Last Saturday was bizarre.  I read like half a dozen articles (both on line and in print) in a row, and <i>every single one</i> used the word "albeit".  The RNG in the Matrix needs a good thump, or something.

<h2>Verbs vs. adjective</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/petdance/">petdance</a> on 2002-07-15T17:19:55</h3>
It's frustrating to me that people don't understand that the same word (or same sounding pair of words) can have two different parts of speech.  They know it instinctively ("run", for example), but don't actively think about it.

Well certainly they don't think about it in those terms, because most people don't know what "parts of speech" means!<br> <br>But if one would take that angle to justify using "setup" as a verb -- well, that's just wrong, plain and simple.<br>



<blockquote>

<h2>Re:Verbs vs. adjective</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/petdance/">petdance</a> on 2002-07-15T18:33:48</h3>
But that's my point: If they think of it and realize that "set up" is the verb and "setup" is the noun, it wouldn't be a problem.

<h2>Everyday</h2>

<p>I blame <a href="http://www.geocities.com/SunsetStrip/Towers/5236/everyday.html" title="geocities.com">Buddy Holly</a geocities.com>.</p>

Well, apparently he had sense enough to write "every way" as two words... That makes me think that the "everyday" spouge predates Holly.<br> <br>:-)<br>
