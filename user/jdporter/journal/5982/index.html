<p>Yup, I'm programming in Perl at work.<br/><br/>We had this nasty old perl program floating around, and when I looked into it, I could not believe the insanely bad programming.  I'd like to say that the programmer was a converted Fortran hacker, but that would be too generous.  I can't even assume that this programmer learned how to write perl by looking at Matt's Scripts.  It's more like, he selected about 1 in 5 random lines from perltut, and kept only those bits that worked without modification.  As a result, the only array operations he knows about are:<br/><br/>  for ( @a )<br/><br/>  @a = &lt;F&gt;;<br/><br/>  $a[$i] = ...<br/><br/>That's sure not much to go on.
He didn't even know how to assign a list to an array.  He thought the way to initialize (or "blank out") an array was with<br/><br/>  $a[0] = "";<br/><br/>WTF?!!!<br/><br/>He also didn't know about push.  In order to add an element onto an array, he would do the following:<br/><br/>  open F, "&gt; file";
  for ( @a ) {
    $line = $_; # lord have mercy.
    print F "$line\n";
  }
  print F "new item\n";
  close F;
  open F, "&lt; file";
  @a = &lt;F&gt;;
  close F;<br/><br/>This was done in about two dozen places in this ~5000 line program.  As you can imagine, it ran like a dog.<br/><br/>Also, this programmer knew nothing about lexical variables, subroutine arguments, or subroutine return values.  All variables global; no use strict or perl -w.   ;-P<br/><br/>(more later...)

Weren't you telling us about this on the DC.pm list months ago?  Not that that's a problem -- such insanity deserves a wider(?) audience.

I feel your pain.  In the next couple of days I'm going to have to modify a (somewhat) smaller program (1876 lines).  No strict, no -w.  At this point I'm still trying to figure out what the bloody thing actually does<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)
