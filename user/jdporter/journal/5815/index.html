<p>Seems like some people actually use their journals to write down what they're doing that day.  I suppose I could give it a try...<br/><br/>I'm going for a hair cut tonight.  First time in months, and man am I overdue.  Jeni has decided to let me get a color this time (after years of pleading). Probly because she has a coupon for it.<br/><br/>Did anyone watch American Idol last night and the night before?  I was very skeptical at first, because it was such an obvious rip-off of Pop Stars.  (Fox copying WB. Imagine!)  But it turned out not to be.<br/><br/>One thing that was cool was that the show was broadcast live.  LOTS of unscripted moments.  I can't believe how awful some of the contestants were, at this semifinal level.  That girl Rhodesia... words can not describe.  What the hell was she thinking, with "Daydream Believer"?  Anyway, there's no way she could win, because not only must they have vocal talent, and showmanship, but they have to have The Look.  That rules out a lot of people, including people with talent.<br/><br/>My fave: Ryan Starr.  The girl can obviously sing. I bet she really could sing anything thrown at her.  Also I have to give her extra marks because she looks *exactly* like one lover from the days of my youth, and also a lot like another sweetheart of not so long ago.<br/><br/>Jeni and I are planning to go see Norah Jones in concert tomorrow night at the 9:30 club.  Now there's a girl with talent.  Diana Krall WISHES she could sing half so well as Norah Jones.
  Norah Jones++
