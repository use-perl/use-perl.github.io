<p>I'm also getting really sick of people not knowing the difference between "its" and "it's".<br/><br/>Come on, people, it's very simple.  "it's" is a contraction of "it is" (or "it has").  If what you mean isn't a contraction, don't write "it's"!<br/><br/>The possessive pronoun is "its".<br/><br/>Thank you.

<p>Sounds like you know some people who could use <a href="http://angryflower.com/bobsqu.gif" title="angryflower.com">Bob the angry flower's quick guide to the apostrophe, you idiots</a angryflower.com>.  Actually, since people don't know the difference between plurals and possessives, can't tell you the difference, and certainly don't know whether an apostrophe goes there or not, it's no suprise to me they don't know the difference between "it's" and "its."</p>

<p>I'm bothered more by "alot" and "would of."  "I would of finished that if I'd had more tuits."  What they mean is "would've," but apparently precious few were paying attention to the contractions we learned in the second grade.</p>

As for "try and do something" as distinct from "try to do something"... <br> <br>*sigh*<br> <br>

Thank you for that BtAF link. Never saw it before.  I particular busted a gut over <a href="http://angryflower.com/cubepu.gif" title="angryflower.com">this one</a angryflower.com>.

<p>Actually I never read the series regularly before.  I think someone was passing that link around on slashdot, though I recently saw a post here that went to a page that linked to it.</p>

<p>Go pacifism.  Heh.</p>
