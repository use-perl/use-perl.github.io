So I was on call this weekend, and at 4:00 AM this morning, my phone starts blowing up.  So I jump up in a fit of Sysadmin rage to see what the hell was going on, only to check my emails and notice that the DBA's and another Sysadmin were performing a DB upgrade.  What a waste, I could have been sleeping.  
</p>
<p>
Oh well, I silenced my phone and went back to bed for an hour.

</p>
<p>
Screen doesn't want to cooperate for me today on my sandbox:<br/><br/>
<code>Sorry, could not find a PTY.                                                                                                       </code>
<br/>
<code>[screen is terminating]</code>
<p>
Why did that have to happen on the day I honed my sweet new .screenrc?!
</p>
<p>
Oh yeah, I forgot...It's Monday.
</p>
<p>
Sysadmins hate Mondays in particular because all the crap that the developers forgot to mention the previous week, and the crap you put off because you were so busy comes barreling down on you like a metric ton of bricks.  It's okay though, we get through with teeth grinding and massive amounts of caffeine.  Some of us have cigarettes to "help" some of us have xanex; pick your poison.  
</p>
<p>

I think I'm going to research the average life span of a sysadmin.  I'd predict it being significantly shorter than most.  I'd also be curious to see what the leading cause of death is for a sysadmin as well.  
</p>
<p>
Don't misunderstand!  I love my job.  In fact, I get some kind of sick pleasure from it.  I swear I was a Sub in another life and Windows NT Server 4.0 was my Dom.
