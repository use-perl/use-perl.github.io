<p>This is my first ever blog/journal entry anywhere. I think this announcement was the final incentive for me to break that barrier.<br/><br/>What is the Perl College?<br/><br/>	The Perl College is a creative merger of job training and job
	fairs. Here are its primary goals:<br/><br/>	* Provide free top quality training to qualified
	  junior level Perl developers
	* Improve their Perl skills to the intermediate level
	* Match the new graduates with Perl jobs in the hiring companies
	* http://perlhunter.com/college.html<br/><br/>	The Perl College was created to address these issues in
	recruiting Perl coders:<br/><br/>	* A shortage of intermediate level Perl developers
	* A surplus of junior level Perl developers
	* Some are not developing Perl full time
	* Many are looking for a career developing Perl but can't get
	  needed training and experience
	* Companies lacking the resources to train Perl developers<br/><br/>	We are currently seeking both sponsors and students for this
	unique education/recruitment opportunity.<br/><br/>Hiring Sponsors: Thirty great applicants - cheap!<br/><br/>	Imagine how much it would cost in both time and money to find
	and train a qualified applicant for your Perl jobs. The Perl
	College dramatically improves the efficiency of this process by
	pre-screening and accepting only the most motivated
	students. Then we take it one step further. We take those
	already highly motivated students and train them up to a solid
	intermediate level of Perl skills. Efficiency, cost
	effectiveness and quality results - what could be better for
	your Perl recruitment needs?<br/><br/>Student Candidates: Put yourself ahead of the competition.<br/><br/>	If selected you will have a week of free training from Damian
	Conway (valued at $3000). Plus you will exposed to employers who
	are actively seeking intermediate level Perl developers.
	Competition to get in will be fierce so put your best foot
	forward. Don't wait to apply as we will take only the thirty
	most qualified students.<br/><br/>For more information on The Perl College, and how to apply to be a
sponsor or a student go to these pages:<br/><br/>	http://perlhunter.com/college.html

<h2>Uri the Perl head-hunter</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/brian_d_foy/">brian_d_foy</a> on 2008-03-01T21:38:04</h3>
The thing you didn't mention is at the bottom of your <a href="http://perlhunter.com/students.html" title="perlhunter.com">Students</a perlhunter.com> page:<p><blockquote><div>The Perl Hunter is your exclusive employment agent for hiring sponsors for six months after these classes are over<br></div></blockquote><br><br>Basically, in exchange for providing a week of training, you're going to take the substantial recruiter fees for placing any of these thirty students over the next six months. It's not that I disagree with that, but you could tell the truth up front rather than hiding it behind "supporting that Perl community and Damian Conway".<br><br>Also, I wouldn't value a week of Damian's classes at $3000. I know what his prices, and it's not $90,000 per week. You're fibbing a bit there to make the students think they are getting more than they are. Basically, they get a free week of class, but have to pay for their own travel expenses so you can get a big recruiters fee by placing them in a job. It doesn't sound to me like they get such a good deal. But then, that's what recruiters do.



<h2>The value to the students</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Damian/">Damian</a> on 2008-03-03T06:01:18</h3>
Uri can certainly defend himself, but I thought I ought to comment on the parts of brian's message that relate to me too:<p><blockquote> <div><i>
Also, I wouldn't value a week of Damian's classes at $3000. I know what his prices, and it's not $90,000 per week. You're fibbing a bit there to make the students think they are getting more than they are.
</i></div> </blockquote>
My corporate prices certainly aren't $90k a week (though I'm always open to offers!<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)

<p>But Uri's statement is nevertheless still pretty accurate. Although these classes are a new idea, they're definitely not like my corporate offerings, since my corporate rates exclude venue, organisational, and logistical costs (which corporate clients still have to pay, but not on a per-student basis).

</p><p>In terms of cost structure, these classes are much more like the public classes I have run in various cities (including Boston back in 2001 and 2002). For those Boston classes, the prices were $500 per student per day. Allowing for the actual inflation rate over the last six years, today that'd be equivalent to about $585 per day. If we also add in the depreciation of the USD over that period (about 40% against the Australian dollar!), then $3000 for five days is probably quite a reasonable estimate of what they'd have to pay...if they had to pay. Which, of course, they don't...</p><p><blockquote> <div><i>Basically, they get a free week of class</i></div> </blockquote>

Yep, precisely.<p><blockquote><div><nobr> <wbr></nobr><i>...but have to pay for their own travel expenses...</i></div> </blockquote>

Though, to be fair, Uri <i>has</i> negotiated block rates for (comparatively) cheap accommodation, is coordinating room-sharing for the participants so as to halve even that cost, and is also trying to find crash space amongst local mongers for those for whom the expenses are an issue. The venue is right on the 'T' too, so if they're local to Boston (the most likely case) then their travel expenses are going to be about $15 for a weekly transit pass.<p><blockquote><div><nobr> <wbr></nobr><i>...so you can get a big recruiters fee by placing them in a job.</i></div> </blockquote>

A fee that the students don't pay either, as far as I know.<p><blockquote> <div><i>It doesn't sound to me like they get such a good deal. But then, that's what recruiters do.
</i></div> </blockquote>

Hmmmmm. I don't have a problem with recruiters making money if they provide a useful service (which is why I'm involved in this particular exercise). More relevantly, I'm not sure I see how Uri making money on this venture diminishes the value to the students of getting a week of my training for free.

<p>If there really is an ethical issue here, I'd genuinely like to understand it. Because I'm certainly don't want to exploit anyone...I just want to help provide an opportunity for everyone (myself included) to benefit.

Hi Damian!<p><div class="quote">If there really is an ethical issue here, I'd genuinely like to understand it. Because I'm certainly don't want to exploit anyone...I just want to help provide an opportunity for everyone (myself included) to benefit.</div> My only problem is that in this announcement, Uri doesn't mention the fact that by participating as a student, you are agreeing to a six-month obligation.  That should be stated up front IMO.  It is not a problem with you or the "College," just this announcement of it.  The important thing is that everyone who participates knows what they are getting into, and I imagine this obligation would be made clear before they agree to participate, of course, but still, I think such things should be stated up front.<br>

Thanks, Pudge. I do see your (and Brian's) point in that regard, and I appreciate you both taking the time to help me understand it.

<p>On the other hand, I certainly don't think we should infer any malice on Uri's part. None of the other eight conditions/requirements for being a student are mentioned either, though all nine are plainly stated on the <a href="http://perlhunter.com/students.html" title="perlhunter.com">student information page</a perlhunter.com>, to which the announcement directly links.

</p><p>You're also correct in assuming that they can't possibly enrol without having the condition fully explained to them, and agreeing to it. I'd also point out that the agreement amounts to accepting that Uri will get a bonus from a third party if he manages to help the student get a job as a direct result of this event...which doesn't seem to be a particularly onerous or disadvantageous obligation for the student.
