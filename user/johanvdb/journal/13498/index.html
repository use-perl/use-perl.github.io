<p>I need to write database components for a medium complexity database, I'm talking about a 30 tables here, with a lot of foreign keys ...<br/><br/>The problem being that I don't have time to do it by hand - and also because I'm too lazy to write 30 database classes - so I'm looking for an OO database wrapper. Choice seems to be abundant, tangram, class::dbi, alzabo, ... <br/><br/>Skimming the docs of those I think I need to settle on Class::DBI or Alzabo. I'm not sure which one will fit my needs ...  so I'm experimenting with both of them ...

If you haven't already see the <a href="http://poop.sourceforge.net/" title="sourceforge.net">POOP report</a sourceforge.net>. Also, Perrin Harkins gave a presentation as OSCON this year comparing Class::DBI, Tangram and SPOPS, and he's threatening to write an article doing the same. That's not much help for you now, but just for future reference.

<p>I'd be interested in hearing what your conclusions are. I've been working on a similar project, that I had been doing by hand but then thought that I should perhaps do it in Class::DBI, and now have been floundering trying to decide what to do.</p>

Alzabo will automate a huge amount of your work, but it obviously involves a significant time investment.  The added bonus is that you can use it to manage your schema at the DDL level too, and as of 0.72 it's gotten pretty smart, so it tracks column &amp; table name changes and preserves your data whenever it can.<br> <br>Class::DBI is a much smaller time investment to learn, and it's not a resource hog<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)  But my suspsicion is that any large, complex schema that you use with Class::DBI will force you to rewrite some portion of Alzabo, or to repeat the same things over and over.
