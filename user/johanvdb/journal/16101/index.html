<p>Nothing to do with Perl ... and probably just something I want to get out of my heart ...<br/><br/>Anyhow ... during a business trip to Boston I had a brief window to do some shopping. High on my shopping list was an RC plane from estesrockets.com I wanted to buy for me and my nephew. <br/><br/>I grabbed two RC planes (SkyRangers), paid for them and went back to the hotel. The day after, at my hotel room I checked the goods and to my astonishment one of them was already used. Probably somebody at wall-mart - probably personell - had been playing with it until it was beyond repairs and quietly changed it with a new one in the store.<br/><br/>A pity, I did not have the change to go back to the place-delict, the Wall-Mart in Framingham, MA, otherwise I would have gone back and made my point clear.<br/><br/>Now, I had to travel back with one broken RC plane, which I payed 30$ for! <br/><br/>Well, first impressions count they say, and this was my first trip to the US. One thing I learned, never thrust a store in the US, especially not Wall-Mart!<br/><br/>I send them an email, complaining about the matter, but why should they bother? They never answered ...<br/><br/>Johan  </p>

I called the wall-mart store in Framingham to file a complaint - an international and as such an expensive call - it was just real-american-fun!<br> <br>The first person would pass me through to a manager<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... I waited<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... the second person would pass me through to a manager<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... I waited<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... the third person would pass me through to a manager<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... I waited<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... I gave up on the fourth!<br> <br>Jeezes! Customers first, My ***!<br> <br>

The stuff that Walmart sells is generally manufactured in China (not exactly the<br>Land of Strong Unions), and the company doesn't treat workers well in their<br>stores, either.  If I had a job at Walmart, I'd do my best to avoid doing<br>anything.  Why should Walmart workers feel any loyalty to the people who own the<br>company?<br>

<h2>Sure it's crap...but it's cheap crap</h2>

The only time I ever buy stuff there is when someone gets me a gift card. I tried looking for shoes there once, but there was absolutely nothing that was wearable. And don't even get me started on their labor practices. The local grocery workers union here is on strike, and Wal-Mart is (purported to be) one of the causes. Sure you pay cheaper prices there, but you (or I guess not you, since you don't live here) make up for it by paying higher taxes to pay for the welfare that their employees collect.

The people who run Walmart are pretty effective.  It's just that their values<br>are totally repulsive to me, and hopefully also to many other people.<br> <br>I guess people who have been snowjobbed with nationalism and religion have<br>trouble thinking about this systematically, though.<br>
