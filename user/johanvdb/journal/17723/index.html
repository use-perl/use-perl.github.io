<p>I think I need to give up my main email address after 6 years. Why? SPAM! I get 400+ spam messages a day, and thanks to spamassassin I can manage that quite well ...<br/><br/>But now, spam has entered a new phase ... I get a lot of bounced and rejected mail from mail that got sent with my email address. These mails seem to contain virusses and who knows what else ...<br/><br/>This all started one week ago ... maybe I'll let the storm pass by, but I think it is better to bounce all spam mail for a short period, including the bounced ones ...<br/><br/>If this does not help, I'll need to shut down my old email address ...<br/><br/>Does this phenomenon sounds familiar to anybody? I wonder if I would shut it down for a month, that I would get back to the old - 5 messages a day - state ...<br/><br/>johan</p>

<h2>Joe-jobs</h2>

Yes, it's called a "joe-job", and it's one of the things that SPF will specifically squash.  (SPF -&gt; http://spf.pobox.com)
<p>
Also, do you have any catch-all addresses?  MANY joejobs were coming to me at "garbagestring@petdance.com", so I turned off my catch-all address.</p>

Hmmm<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... They contain mail seamingly sent from my email address to others, like e.g. the php mailing list, graphviz and such. I get bounces from them because e.g. the mail sent to them seems to contain a virus or got sent to an unknown account at that host.<br> <br>I'm not sure if this falls under the category joe-job also?<br> <br>johan

<h2>Joe Job</h2>

This is how I stopped the majority of the bounces from getting into my inbox...

<h2>SpamAssassin for virus bounces.</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/schwern/">schwern</a> on 2004-03-03T00:33:49</h3>
I've been using the same pobox email address for more than a few years now and its gets absolutely clobbered with spam, viruses and virus bounces.  Mostly from being in the Perl documentation.  My current setup is a lightly tweaked SA + pobox.com's own spam filtering and that cuts out most everything.

<p>Virus bounces were a bit more of a problem.  Fortunately, <a href="http://www.exit0.us/index.php/VirusBounceRules" title="exit0.us">SA to the rescue!</a exit0.us>  Unfortunately the scores on those aren't tweaked very well and the recommendation that you just chuck anything that matches one of these rules is equivalent to tossing all bounces.  I'll send you my own rules if you like.

</p><p>Meanwhile, I hold out for SPF.</p>



<h2>Bouncing Spam</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/chromatic/">chromatic</a> on 2004-03-03T00:56:05</h3>
<p>You're fed up with people bouncing spam to you and your solution is to bounce spam to other people?  That doesn't seem very useful.</p>

I hope he really means "reject" rather than "bounce".

<h2>Envelope from</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Juerd/">Juerd</a> on 2004-03-03T19:39:15</h3>
Use an envelope from different from your From: header and ignore all bounces not coming from there.<br> <br>This works very well for me. Although juerd [[AT]] convolution [[DOT]] nl is my mail address, I use an envelope from of juerd [[AT]] c4 [[DOT]] convolution [[DOT]] nl. Both addresses exist, but the c4 address is never used for anything besides bounces (and SPF checks, hopefully). All bounces coming in at the non-c4 address are delivered to<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/dev/null.
