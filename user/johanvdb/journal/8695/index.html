<p>Recently I read an <a href="http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2002/09/24/axkit.html">article</a> on perl.com that really showed the strength of using SAX and family.<br/><br/>This got me going and experimenting with custom SAX event handlers and generators.<br/><br/>Now, the place I work is full of ÃÂ¼bergeeks - in the positive sense of the word - a few of them are building there own Personal Video Recorder and introduced me into a special XML format, called <a href="http://membled.com/work/apps/xmltv/">XmlTV</a>. This format is used to describe TV program listings, like channel, hour and show that is on the telly. <br/><br/>Their favourite system, <a href="http://freevo.sourceforge.net/">freevo</a>, seems to be build with Python - and that is a pity off course. It should have been build in Perl. Looking at CPAN, we find a lot of modules that would aide in the development of such a thingy ... SDL for the graphics (no no, no browser here please ), handling of XMMS and MP3 files and off course LWP HTML::TreeBuilder and the XML modules for <a href="http://www.samag.com/documents/s=1272/sam05030008/">scraping</a> usefull information for TV addicts from the web.<br/><br/>Well, all this led to me developing a <a href="http://search.cpan.org/author/JOHANVDB/XML-Generator-XmlTV-0.11/">thingy that can generate this XMLTV</a> format - theoretically from any source - in Perl (*** note: I put it offline, sometimes it is too dangerous to write perl modules ***). And I've build it as a SAX event generator, so you can plug it in into any application you want (?) if you prefer to work with XML stuff, that is. <br/><br/>I'm also toying around with Perl 5.8.0 recently and especially with the threading capabilities of Perl 5.8.0. I've written the classic Producer/Consumer application. And that got me wondering about the differences between the threading model in Perl and Java. I don't now how, but the low level threading support in Perl seems a bit too low-level for some stuff.
having read a book on Java threading (shame on me), I really would like the following constructs in Perl:<br/><br/>  sub do_stuff : Synchronized {
     Wait;
     $do_stuff_var++;
     NotifyAll;
  }<br/><br/>and<br/><br/>  ...
  # critical code section
  synchronized {
    do_critical_stuff;
    more_critical_stuff;
  }
  ...<br/><br/>Let's see what we can do in this area ... more soon.<br/><br/></p>
