<p>Do you know The Perl Review? Do you know you can subscribe it? Do you know that brian d foy and I are preparing for an European edition so you can pay less? But, we need subscribers. We need more european subscribers such that we can print in Europe (well, Portugal).</p>

<p>Given the current strength of the euro, subscribing at the overseas rate wasn't too expensive, anyway.<nobr> <wbr></nobr><tt>;-)</tt>
What will happen to European subscribers who (like me) already have a subscription?</p>
<p>Last question: I remember having read about a PDF version of the paper TPR... Did I dream about it? I much prefer holding a paper review than a PDF journal, but if a PDF edition of TPR exists, my desire for completeness must be fulfilled...</p>

Current European subscribers continue subscribed. No news<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
<p>Yes, the PDF version exists. brian sent them to the subscribers. DIdn't you receive it?</p>

<p>No, I didn't. I subscribed after the first wave of subscription, because I needed to know my new address.</p>

<i>subscribing at the overseas rate wasn't too expensive</i>

<p>I think that was not the point... the point was that printing TPR in NA and sending it to Europe would be more expensive than sending it to NA... hence, we Europeans would have to pay more.

</p><p>By printing TPR in Portugal, I believe these costs would be reduced.</p>

Wait... we will not send them to NA. We will print at US and EU.



<h2>Re:That's good news</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/BooK/">BooK</a> on 2004-10-15T07:37:28</h3>
<p>Do you think there will be noticeable differences between the two editions? Like differences in paper, printing, etc. I guess the content will be same, except for a few lines somewhere near the cover page.</p>

At the moment, the US edition is on normal "legal" paper (80g paper, I think). At the moment, the best budget I have (also for legal paper) is about 108g paper (a little better).

The paper may end up being a little different, and the covers may differ slightly because the ISSN, bar codes, and what not might be different.  I'm also trying to arrange advertising to cover the cost of printing, so the European edition may have different ads, too.

<p>But, but... I'll have to subscribe to both editions, if I want my collection to be complete!</p>

If we start printing in the EU, you'll get a pro rata refund for the remaining parts of your subscription.  That basically represents the postage I don't have to pay to send it Air Mail to you, which is currently $US2.40 an issue.  That's a lot just in postage: about 6 times the US postage rate.

I guess I could convice the place where I work to subscribe. Have you got any ideas how much a subscription will cost?

Hmmms. I have to ask brian and to get the prices for some fundamental stuff like envelopes and stamps. At the moment, non-US subscription is $30US. I think that if we got enough subscribers we can go for the $16US of US subscriptions (about 16 euros... maybe).
<p>
<b>NOTE:</b> this is just an idea of the price.</p>

That's about right.  I don't expect the cost to be that much different in the EU or the US.  Alberto's working up the cost, and from there we can set a price.
