<h1>Best Perl Release Ever!</h1>

<div class="span8">
<p><p>YAPC::EU::2008 in Copenhagen ended today. During the conference a lot of people said something like: <i>Perl 5.10 is the best Perl release ever!</i>. I think that who repeated this most was Damian Conway. Given his talks content I can understand why. But it wasn't the only one.</p>
<p>Now, what I can't understand is why <a href="http://ftp.cpan.org/src/README.html">http://ftp.cpan.org/src/README.html</a> still says that perl 5.10.0 is a testing release, 8 months old.</p>
<p>I discussed this previously in perl 5 porters mailing list, but some months elapsed and no news. It is <b>really</b> important to re-tag that distribution with a <b>stable</b> tag, if it is really the best Perl release ever. Another option is to make 5.10.1 available. I know Rafael has some milestones for 5.10.1. But it might be more important for the Perl community to have 5.10.1 wide spread than to wait for really new cool features.</p>
<p>Why? For instance, because some Linux distributions will not include perl 5.10.x while it is tagged with <b>testing</b>. Also, because we all know that changes from 5.6 to 5.8 were basically from internals (Unicode, especially). But the changes from 5.8 to 5.10 are significally a breath of fresh air. We should make 5.10 the best Perl release ever for all users, and not just those geeks that want to use the new features.</p></p>

<h2>Just My Opinion</h2>

<p>I deeply respect and admire the work of everyone who's contributed to the Perl core, from tests to documentation to smoke results and bug reports.  I still believe that the Perl 5 release process is badly broken, and the fact that the first "major" release of Perl 5 in five and a half years is a "testing" release is a symptom of that.</p>

<p>I can't use it at work because of that label.</p>

<p>Here's the pickle.  People don't want to label their software as stable until other people test it and report it as stable.  Other people don't want to run unstable software.  As a consequence, alphas don't get tested.  Betas don't get tested.  Release candidates don't get tested.  Stable testing releases don't get tested.</p><p>Release labels don't work.  Long feature freezes which produce labeled releases don't work, at least if you want to produce stable software that people will use.</p><p>I owe the world a long rant about this, but I'll work on that later, and depress everyone who's been paying attention by saying "In addition, those other people don't <em>upgrade</em>, either."</p>

<p>Oh I agree. "I" would definitely use it at work. I keep hammering away at doggedly stubborn management.</p>

<p>&gt; Stable testing releases don't get tested.</p><p>90% of Strawberry Perl downloads are the stable testing release (500-1000 a day)</p><p>10% of Strawberry Perl downloads are the stable release (50-100 a day)</p><p>Dunno about the rest of the platforms, but the Windows world is testing the hell out of 5.10.0.</p>

<p>That's really interesting!  Do you have a conjecture as to why this is?  I'd love to know how to duplicate this for other projects.</p>

You did not ask me but here is my take on it:
<p>
For one, the <a href="http://strawberryperl.com/" title="strawberryperl.com">Strawberry</a strawberryperl.com> web site <b>does not say testing</b> and all things equal people tend to go with the higher version.
</p><p>
IMHO In the Windows world it is much more common to download your software while most of the linux/UNIX people will go with the one that is in the distro.
<br>
Besides we don't have numbers for download to Linux/Unix.</p>
