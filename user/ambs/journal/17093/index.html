<p><p>Speaking of Simon, when I invited him I was preparing a Perl session. The interesting, was his answer: should I talk about Perl or Ruby?

<p>I know ruby already (well, I know it exists, and I did see some code examples) but I wasn't expecting this "change" from Simon.

<p>When I compile Ruby, I love to have a autoconf/automake installation scheme (shame on Perl) but I hate not having tests (shame on Ruby).

<p>I still didn't have time to learn Ruby, but can you guys, who read this, point where Ruby is better than Perl, and where Perl is better than Ruby?</p>

<h2>Where is Ruby better....</h2>

I think there are two places where Ruby is better than Perl:  OO and threads.  Since Ruby was designed with both in mind, they are both much better implemented in Ruby than in Perl.

I love perl OO<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-) I hate to have to compile Perl again to have threads<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:(

&gt; When I compile Ruby, I love to have a autoconf/automake installation scheme (shame on Perl)<br> <br>I'm always very curious of what people find to be so excellent in autoconf/automake (*).  If you are referring to the Perl Configure by default being interactive (shame on GNU configure), I can't really see what GNU configure has that either Configure -des or configure.gnu don't have.<br> <br>(*) Personally I find the GNU configure/build system to be an abomination.<br> <br>

<p>In fact, I do not mind to have iteraction (ok, configure for Perl as too many iteraction<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)). It is true, also, that Perl Configure has many interesting lines<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

</p><p>Although I do not think that GNU configure/build system is an abomination (of course it could be better, but I think they accept suggestions) I like to have a package, and know how to install it (to have a recipe). configure &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make check &amp;&amp; make install...

</p><p>Ok, you can say perl is similar (Configure &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make test &amp;&amp; make install) but you know that, I also know that. For a new user, he will waste some seconds/minutes to discover (not bad, he will learn something). For some others, they will think that Perl configure/build system is an abomination<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

</p><p>OK, after all this text, I didn't gave any good reason why I prefer configure/automake... maybe because we are too used to it...</p>

Where Perl is better:<br>
=====================<br>
Speed<br>
Unicode support
<p>
Where Ruby is better:<br>
=====================<br>
OO and Exception handling<br>
Extensions<br>
Threads<br>

Syntax is arguable (just talk to Python people!), but I prefer Ruby's.</p>

Only to say I like ugly syntaxes. I hate Python. Too much clean, and I can't manage to like forced indentation. I like to indent it, but when I have the time<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)
