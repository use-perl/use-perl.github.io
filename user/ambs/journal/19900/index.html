<p><p>For some time I've been observing that most Perl hackers use Mac (Leon Brocard and Simon Cozens, at least, which I can remember).
<p>I, on the other hand, have been working with Linux (Slackware). What can I gain buying a Mac?</p></p>

<h2>My experience</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/melo/">melo</a> on 2004-07-17T20:30:53</h3>
I used linux for 8 years I think. two years ago I bough a TiBook. I don't think I'll ever go back.<br> <br>I got tired of compiling modules and software and fixing little things to make the basic environment work. Granted: linux is more efficient than Mac OS X, but my Mac *always* works. I never had to fix nothing serious in 2 years of everyday use.<br> <br>Sleep and hibernation just work. Since 10.3 (Panther release) you can compile most opensource software if you really want to. There are at least 3 distributions of open source software, and at least fink (http://fink.sf.net) has binary packages. And the bundled Mac software is very good (things like iTunes, iChat, Mail.app) although you have to give them a chance. Lots of things in the Mac world work better if you allow yourself to try to do things the way Apple thinks its best.<br> <br>In the end, switching made more productive because I didn't had to fight everyday with the machine to get some work done.

<p><nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) the price has gone down. I'm writing this in a 2 years old machine. You can buy a iBook with the same power under euro 1000. That's not terrible expensive, if you compare features with PC's.

It's Unix with a friendly face. That's all I need.

You must be rebooting a lot, then.
<p>n.b. I'm assuming the "friendly Mac" is still the first thing you see when booting...</p>

The friendly Mac doesn't come with OS X I don't believe. And OS 9 wasn't unix, and it was therefore useless to me.
