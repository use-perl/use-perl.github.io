<p>The Perl Foundation is looking at giving some grants ranging from $500 to $3000 in February 2009.<br/><br/>In the past, we've supported Adam Kennedy's PPI, Strawberry Perl and Perl on a Stick, Nicholas Clark's work on Perl internals, Jouke Visser's pVoice, Chris Dolan on Perl::Critic and many others (just check http://www.perlfoundation.org/grants for more references).<br/><br/>You don't have to have a large, complex, or lengthy project. You don't even have to be a Perl master or guru. If you have a good idea and the means and ability to accomplish it, we want to hear from you!<br/><br/>Do you have something that could benefit the Perl community but just need that little extra help? Submit a grant proposal by January 31.<br/><br/>As a general rule, a properly formatted grant proposal is more likely to be approved if it meets the following criteria<br/><br/>* It has widespread benefit to the Perl community or a large segment of it.
* We have reasons to believe that you can accomplish your goals.
* We can afford it (please, respect the limits or your proposal should be rejected immediately).<br/><br/>To submit a proposal see the guidelines at http://www.perlfoundation.org/how_to_write_a_proposal and TPF rules of operation at http://www.perlfoundation.org/rules_of_operation. Then send your proposal to tpf-proposals@perl-foundation.org. Note that starting with this round, proposals should be properly formatted accordingly with our POD template.<br/><br/>On February 1st, proposals will be made available publicly (on this blog) for public discussion, as it happened in the previous round. So, please make it clear in your proposal if it should not be public.
