<p><p>I work at a Portuguese University and would like to prepare a two days tutorial about Perl. I would like to invite some gurus (not many, some, only) to come and talk.

<p>At the moment, thinking of any of Larry Wall (but I think he will not be interested), Damian Conway, Simon Cozens, Leon <em>Orange</em> Brocard.

<p>Of course I must invite people accordingly with the money I have to pay the trips, and with the contents of the tutorial (which I will define shortly on any next post!)

<p>Any other people you can advice me?

<p>Ok, I understood the idea! <b>MJD</b> is now in my list too!</p>

I would consider <a href="http://www.stonehenge.com/" title="stonehenge.com">Randal Schwartz</a stonehenge.com>. He's been introducing people to Perl for a while now, and has a nice list of established <a href="http://www.stonehenge.com/perltraining/courses.html" title="stonehenge.com">courses</a stonehenge.com>. I guess I'm biased because I learned Perl from reading his <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0596001320" title="amazon.com">Learning Perl</a amazon.com>, and wonderful <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0201419750" title="amazon.com">Effective Perl Programming</a amazon.com>. Larry and Damian are great speakers, but if you are looking at introducing people to Perl Randal would be great pick.

Randal is undoublty a good choice, but as he works giving courses I do notk now if he would like to give a course free (only with trip and hotel paid). But is another one to contact<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

Mark Jason Dominus was referred to in a journal entry a couple of months ago.  His web site has a standing offer to give a free talk to perl groups if expenses are covered.

Yes, get MJD!  He's a superstah, he's fun, and he has days worth of fascinating talks already prepared.

<p>That's what I clicked here to say!  But apparently it's already been said.</p>

<p>mjd's teaching style is superb.  Somewhere I read he's consistently rated "even higher than Damian."</p>

It was in his own Conference Presentation Judo talk.</p>

I can second this.  He came by to our local Perl Mongers a few years back.  He would have talked well into through the night, except that the venue we were at through us out.<br> <p>I hear that they reconvened at a local Pub and a good time continued to be had by all, although I couldn't attend.<br> </p><p>And... All for free!  You cover his expenses and he's there.<br> </p><p> <a href="http://perl.plover.com/" title="plover.com">A sampling of his wit and wisdom is on-line for your reveiw</a plover.com>.</p>

<ul><li><i>except that the venue we were at through us out.</i></li></ul>  <br>Doh!  I meant to say that "except that the venue we were at threw us out."<br> <p>Normally, I wouldn't bother with the correction, but I thought I should correct that seeing as non-native English speakers will have enough trouble with my (non)idiomatic english without the solecisms.</p>
