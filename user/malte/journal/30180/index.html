<p><p>We recently tried to deploy an application on a new machine (x86_64, Suse Linux 10) but couldn't get Crypt::SSLeay to compile which we need to do SSL-Requests through LWP.</p>

<p>As an alternative we implemented a new Protocol-Implementor for LWP that makes https requests using wget. Of course, we found out that wget had really buggy http header handling until version 1.10 which is not widely deployd yet. But once you install the new version it works fine. The module supports basic authentication, http headers, get and post which is enough to use it as a transport layer for SOAP::Lite.</p>

<p>There are probably quite a few bugs lurking in this thing and it only really works with newer version of wget, but it might still be interesting for some desperate people :)</p>

<p>If people are interested we'll release it to CPAN once things have settled done here a little.</p></p>

<h2>IO::Socket::SSL</h2>

Did you try IO::Socket::SSL?  It's an alternative to Crypt::SSLeay.  It does depend on Net::SSLeay however.  Also, when I last used it, timeouts didn't work properly.  But apart from that it works fine.

<p>We didn't try it, but it looks like it might run into silimar compilation problems. We can't really try it out now either, because the problem only occurs on the production machines (Which is really weird because the test machines are 99.999% identical).</p>

<p>Does the module provide an Interface to LWP? If not it might be a good thing to implement the neccessary glue.</p>

LWP auto-detects Crypt::SSLeay vs IO::Socket::SSL and does the appropriate thing.

<p>We actually moved to Crypt::SSLeay because of the timeout issue, but both should work.

</p><p>What was the compilation issue?

Hhmm, I don't really remember the exact issue. What I do remember is that other people on the net (at least according to google<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) seemed o have has similar problems with Crypt::SSLeay, specific archs and the latest version of OpenSSL.

I just went through the hassle with Crypt::SSLeay yesterday and wasted a few hours of my life.  moving to IO::Socket::SSL solved things perfectly.  so, thanks.
