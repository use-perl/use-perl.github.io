Wow. It's like it's 1997 all over again.<br> <br>You might like to read some of the criticism of Matt's CGI decoder that you'll find all over the web. And then incorporate fixes for those problems in your code.<br> <br>Two obvious problems that spring to mind:<br> <br>* No support for the ';' parameter separator which is now recommended over '&amp;'.<br> <br>* No support for multiple parameters with the same name.<br>

<p>I know. Thats why I said there are bugs in there. However, if you know you will only get &amp; separators and all you want to transport via the URL is some integers or booleans values, than it works pretty well.</p>

<p>As opposed to Matt's decoder there is no security hole in that code.</p>

<p>All the bugs you mentioned are easily fixed. My point was, that having a thing like the CGI object in JavaScript is nice<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) That's all.</p>

Why do you think that Matt Wright created the "foreach my $pair (@pairs)" snippet?  I wrote it; it appeared in my form-mail program, which was distributed in late 1993 or early 1994.<br> <br>Needless to say, this was when HTML forms were still brand new, and having a form that sent e-mail was considered novel.  Once forms and CGI were more established, and once there were libraries (cgi-lib.pl and CGI.pm) that parsed parameters for you, why would you ever do it yourself in production code?<br> <br>I still have the e-mail from Matt Wright (then 16 years old) in which he apologized for having taken my form-mail program, removed the GPL, replaced my name with his, added several security issues, and distributed it on the Web.  He also agreed to stop distributing form-mail, and all of the other CGI programs in his collection, because the problems were making it not worthwhile.  Needless to say, he didn't follow through on his promise to me -- and caused a lot of pain for many years to come.

Sorry. You're right. I knew that Matt's program was based on your code. We've discussed it before in email (when I found that UK ISP Demon were still distributing your original program).<br> <br>At least Matt now <a href="http://scriptarchive.com/nms.html" title="scriptarchive.com">mentions</a scriptarchive.com> the nms versions of these programs on his site. He even distributes slightly altered versions of them, tho' the links are hard to find and he refuses to link directly to <a href="http://nms-cgi.sf.net/" title="sf.net">our site</a sf.net>.

<h2>You know...</h2>

<p>I was always of the mind that Javascript should have been extended further (db libraries, cgi, etc.).</p>

<p>When I was first learning it I was thinking it was a nice first language but it needed just a bit more.</p>

<p>Use <code>location.search.substr(1);</code> instead of throwing away anything beyond the 256th character.</p>

<p>Split on<nobr> <wbr></nobr><code>/[;&amp;]/</code>, not <code>"&amp;"</code>.</p>

<p>Call <code>decodeURIComponent()</code> on your split strings.</p>

<p>Use <code>this[pair[0]].push(pair[1])</code> instead of <code>this[pair[0]] = pair[1]</code>. Remember to check for non-existent elements and assign them a <code>new Array</code> if needed, since JS does not have autovivification.</p>
