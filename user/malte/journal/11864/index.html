<p><p>Arggggggggg, I hate Adobe Premiere. I mean I love it, but not right now. It simply won't do normal audio playback anymore. Playback of single clips works, scratching on the timeline works, but for regular timeline playback there is no audio. Damn. I used to be able to work around this by opening a different project that still works and then returning to the original one, but not anymore.</p>

<p>Hmm, time to go party. Maybe Premiere just needs some time to chill.</p></p>

<h2>Premiere</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/furn/">furn</a> on 2003-05-20T14:33:41</h3>
I had a similar problem and found that Premiere treats DV and AVI or QT projects differently on the project level. When I started a project all in DV then everything was OK and when I saved in QTime  and returned to the project, -- and brought in DV I had trouble.,I had the same problems that you describe. It took a lot of fiddling to finially get things to work (actually this happened to me twice, I am ashamed to admit, and on the second time I didn't remember what I had done the first time to fix it) It is expecially fustrating because it almost works and you look for the error in the audio etc. It is a format problem.
