<p><p>Models are subclasses of ENGINE::MVC::Model. They may choose to reimplement the init() method that is called upon
instance creation (on every request). A model has a controller. It has no idea about its views.</p>

<p>A model implements an interface. An unlimited number of views may make use of that or a subset of that interface.
Models usually implement the Facade design pattern. You can see model as a _view_ on your business objects, whatever they
may be.</p>

<p>Models and views form an nxm relationship. There may be n views displaying a single model, and there may be m models being
displayed by 1 view. A typical gui application (website) usually has multiple views that share common background
functionality, so you save a lot of work here.</p>

<p>This kind of total separation of presentation- and business logic makes it very easy to separate the two parts into
independent work processes.</p></p>

But have you seen <a href="http://pagekit.org/" title="pagekit.org">Apache::PageKit</a pagekit.org>, which purports to be a very similiar design?  I haven't used it, but it seems to be based on an MVC approach.

<p>Indeed, PageKit has a similar approach. PageKit has the extra advantage of being released. So, if you want to use an MVC system now you are much better off with PageKit.</p>

<p>Software is not the point, though. At least my system wasn't terribly hard to implement. The development <b>Process</b> is much more important assuming that you can't sell your customer something that's already done.</p>

<p>Don't mistake ENGINE::MVC with a kitchen sink. It won't program your website. It doesn't provide much functionality at all. All it does is providing the programmer with a way to do things, so he can keep his head focused on actually implementing things.</p>
