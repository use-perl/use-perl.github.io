<p>I went snowboarding the last 3 weekends, and I must say I never felt this relaxed in all of my life. I live in northern Germany. Unfortunately, there are no mountains around, so we have to drive 300 kilometres to get to a rather mediocre place but its still worth the effort. There is nothing better than being the damn first to cruise through last nights snow.<br/><br/>Anyway, back to real life. I went through Euro conversions for 2 major sites and it went rather smooth although I must admit there were some bugs. Im happy this stuff is over. I didnt even notice christmas and new years eve due to all the work concerning the Euro.<br/><br/>Last week was kinda fun, not much work, so I had time to try something new. I developed a Model-View-Controller Framework for web pages and it works so well you cant believe it. Inheritance and delegation of of Views and Models is very, very powerful. Development goes way faster. <br/><br/>The reason I did the whole thing is because I wanted to separate visual aspects from programming logic,... but I hate templates. Not really, but my beloved Mac BBEdit has no syntax markup for any of the template modules and I love syntax highlighting. Thats why my code always looks like this:
print 'some stuff ',$foo,' some more stuff';
This way my syntax markup shows me exactly where within the HTML mess there are Perl parts.<br/><br/>In other news: I wrote a UML visualizer in JavaScript (think Visio, JVision, etc.). You can drag classes around connections between them will update on the fly. Possible connections right now are is-a and has-a but they can be easily extended. I always wanted to have something like this for Perl and I guess it shouldnt be too easy to do that using this JavaScript app, if you have a simple Module which (at runtime) gets passed either class names or objects and then walks their isa trees and evil guts. If you are interested in this please comment or drop me a mail, so I get motivation to put the thing on CPAN.<br/><br/>->malte</p>
