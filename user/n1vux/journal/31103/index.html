<p>My Linux laptop (thinkpad) was NFG for 24 hours, with GRUB Error 17.
 [Duration was unrelated to severity, just I had other things to do
after I noticed the issue. ]<br/><br/>Problem was caused by shutting down hard (power switch) during boot
(due to real life intervening). Apparently I powered down at exactly
the wrong moment during boot ...<br/><br/>Error 17 means the MBR was read ok, but the /boot filesystem is NG,
format not recognized. Loosely translated, this means  /boot
superblock was corrupted.<br/><br/>Why would shutdown write a superblock? Mis-calculated dirty-buffer
flush, maybe? Who knows what hardware does when power is removed? sigh<br/><br/>Wasn't really all that hard to fix, once I dug around ... finding the
RIGHT args for the FSCK to not fsck-up, of course ... but getting to
the point where I could FSCK at all was awkward.<br/><br/>Google for Error 17. (Of course I have alternate computers. This does help.)<br/><br/>Boot Knoppix 5 DVD from UK Linux (Pro) Magazine.<br/><br/>See that /dev/hda2 and /dev/hda4 are auto-detected, have icons on
Knoppix desktop.<br/><br/>HDA2 is clean. HDA3 is swap (/mnt/hda2/etc/fstab agrees it should be),
but where's /dev/hda1 => /boot ?   FSTAB says it should be ext3 on
hda1.<br/><br/>Gpart can't guess, it's says everything is 0 size. That's helpful.
Just helpful.  Can't gpart find and use default alt-superblocks in its
heuristics ???<br/><br/>Knoppix didn't even create a block device for hda1 since it wasn't
automountable.  So I had to
 #  cd dev
 #  ls hda*                  # see hda hda2 hda4  all looking similar
 #  man mknod          # haven't used this command in YEARS !!
 #  mknod b 3 1 hda1   # follow pattern
 #  chown root:disk hda1
 #  chmod g+w,o-r hda1
to match the others.<br/><br/>Once I did that, it still won't mount -r; it informs me it's got a bad
superblock (as I'd figured).<br/><br/>And FSCK refuses to do anything with bad superblock either.<br/><br/>I had to read the Man page to find out the default backup-superblock
position for a 1K block size, and then ask it "are you 1k blocksize"
by doing
 # fsck.ext3 -b 8193 -B 1024 -n /dev/hda1
to see if it was a 1k blocksize /boot, in which case it would have
simple errors,  or if (since /vmlinux is a big file) someone made it
2k or 4k block, that would die gloriously and I'd try the other
default -b's for -B 2024 and -B 4096. Since it was ok but for block 3
on 6+ pass, I ran it for real.
 # fsck.ext3 -b 8193 -B 1024 -n /dev/hda1
It prompted to ignore a read error and prompted to re-write superblock.<br/><br/>So then I
 #   mount -t /dev/hda1 /mnt/hda2/boot
and poke around to see that it looks good.  Ok, time to try booting again.<br/><br/>Then I remembered to
 #   umount /mnt/hda2/boot
before
 #  umount /mnt/hda2
so we're clean, and before shutdown Knoppix for reboot and remove DVDrom
 ... and see Grub choice menu come up.<br/><br/>Yeah! Knoppix wins again!<br/><br/>I'm glad that worked, since I'm still not sure how to mount the
several volumes in /dev/hda4 via LVM from Knoppix, if I'd had to
rescue my data.  Knoppix 5 has an LVM command, but ...
