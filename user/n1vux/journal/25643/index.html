  Sky Blue, and Not Violet?</STRONG> </A><STRONG></STRONG>
  <DD>ÃÂ«The hues that we see in the sky are not only determined by the laws of 
  physics, but are also colored by the human visual system, shows a new paper in 
  the American Journal of Physics. On a clear day when the sun is well above the 
  horizon, the analysis demonstrates, we perceive the complex spectrum of colors 
  in the sky as a mixture of white light and pure blue. When sunlight enters the 
  earth's atmosphere, it scatters (ricochets) mainly from oxygen and nitrogen 
  molecules that make up most of our air. What scatters the most is the light 
  with the shortest wavelengths, towards the blue end of the spectrum, so more 
  of that light will reach our eyes than other colors. But according to the 
  19th-century physics equations introduced by Lord Rayleigh, as well as actual 
  measurements, our eyes get hit with peak amounts of energy in violet as well 
  as blue. [...]<BR><BR>The sky's complex multichromatic rainbow of colors 
  tickles our eye's cones in the same way as does a specific mixture of pure 
  blue and white light. This is similar to how the human visual system will 
  perceive the right mixture of pure red and pure green as being equivalent to 
  pure yellow. The cones that allow us to see color cannot identify the actual 
  wavelengths that hit them, but if they are stimulated by the right combination 
  of wavelengths, then it will appear the same to our eyes as a single pure 
  color, or a mixture of a pure color and white light. </STORY2>ÃÂ»

  Force</STRONG>      
 </A><STRONG> </STRONG> 
<DD>ÃÂ«Physicists at the SLAC accelerator have measured, 
  with much greater precision than ever before, the variation in the weak 
  nuclear force, one of the four known physical forces, over an enormous size 
  scale (a distance of more than ten proton diameters) for so feeble a force. 
  Although the results were not surprising (the weak force diminished with 
  distance as expected) this new quantitative study of the weak force helps to 
  cement physicistsÃ¢â¬â¢ view of the sub-nuclear world.&nbsp;... The SLAC work is, 
  in effect, a 21st century analog of the landmark 18th experiments in which the 
  intrinsic strength of the electromagnetic and gravitational forces were 
  measured (by Charles Coulomb and Henry Cavendish, respectively) through 
  careful observation of test objects causing a torsion balance to swing around. 
  The weak force, in the modern way of thinking, is a cousin of the 
  electromagnetic (EM) force; both of them are considered as different aspects 
  of a single Ã¢â¬ÅelectroweakÃ¢â¬Â force.&nbsp;&nbsp;ÃÂ»
<P> -&nbsp; <I>Reuse of a classic 
  experimental&nbsp;design to measure a radically expression of a related force. 
  This&nbsp;experiment indirectly measures the weak force by measuring a parity 
  violation.</I>&nbsp;
