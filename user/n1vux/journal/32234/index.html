<p><P>General advice has been that if the OS is patched for the DST change, Perl will be OK between March 11 and Apr 4, when US DST starts 3 weeks early this year. e.g., <url:http://www.perlmonks.com/?node=daylight+savings>
<br>
</P><br/><br/><P>
However, RedHat Enterprise Linux 3's Perl 5.8.0 doesn't notice that the DST date for the OS changed. I grabbed <A HREF="http://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ahp.com+dst.pl ">a "dst.pl" test script from HP Support's forumsscript</A>
and it's working fine everywhere else, but appears to report "unpatched" on the RHEL3 system that is patched according to ZDUMP(8) and release levels.
<br>
</P><br/><br/><P>
Is this perhaps GCC 2 => GCC 3 transistion legacy  baggage? 
</P><br/><br/>
<P>
That was my guess, and <code>nm(1)</code> seems to support -  it reports built with GLIBC232 while RHEL3 is GLIBC323 (subtle, these two numbers). But NM also appears to say it's dyanmically linked and I don't see an older glibc on the box?
</P>
<P>Anyone know for sure?
</P>
<P>=====================</P>
<P><strong>UPDATE #1</strong></P>
<P>GLIBC2.0 seems to have been a red herring, perl -V says it was built with GCC323, and if I build a new HelloWorld0311.c that expands a time_t value between 2007-03-11 2AMEST and 04-04 2AMEST, it behaves identically. Report from a colleague with a RHEL2.1 system is that perl is correct there, but not on his RHEL3 with home-built Perl 5.8.8 too. This starts to make sense, since Red Hat notes on DST said they were issuing a LIBC patch for RHEL2.1 but only an Olson TZ (zoneinfo) file for RHEL3.
</P>
<P>I think we need a RHEL3 LIBC patch to have Perl and C <code>localtime()</code> working.
</P>
<P>=====================</P>
<P><strong>UPDATE #2</strong></P>
<P>See BLU.org discussion - <url:http://lists.blu.org/pipermail/discuss/2007-January/052070.html>. Either redeploying <code>/etc/{.|locales?}/localtime</code> from <code>/usr/share/{.|lib}/zoneinfo</code> after patching or applying <strong>all</strong> RHEL3/4 patches not just the suggested one seems to be the trick. Perhaps the patch failed to refresh because our RHEL3 install is missing the needed </code>tzconfig</code> utility, but it looks like <code>cp</code> would do the trick.</P>
<P>=====================</P>
<P>
FYI, <A HREF="http://search.cpan.org/search?query=DateTime%3A%3ATimeZone&mode=module"><code>DateTime::TimeZone</code></A> is another issue ... it has it's own Olson TZ/zoneinfo, that's it's whole point, it's independent, so it <strong>needs</strong> to be updated instead of or in addition to the OS, that's a feature.

<h2>DateTime::Timezone - already fixed</h2>

Presuming 2007a of the Olson Database is up to date, apparently <a href="http://search.cpan.org/src/DROLSKY/DateTime-TimeZone-0.59/Changes" title="cpan.org">DateTime::TimeZone</a cpan.org> is already ok.

Yeah. If you've downloaded since 0.36 or 0.38 even since Olson 2005l had it.  And the only reason to HAVE DT::TZ is if you WANT to grab these early and often, so hopefully this is the one module people update on their production servers. But someone probable has an old copy<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...
