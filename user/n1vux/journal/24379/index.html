><B>DNA solves mystery of Gibraltar's macaques</B></A>
<DD>ÃÂ«
In 1942, after Gibraltar's famous macaques dwindled to almost nothing, Prime Minister Winston Churchill ordered their numbers to be replenished due to a traditional belief that Britain would lose Gibraltar if the macaques died out. The clandestine move was taken to bolster Britain's morale during WWII. Ever since, scientists have wondered where the macaques came from. Now, an analysis of mitochondrial DNA from 280 individuals reveals they came from Morocco and Algeria.ÃÂ»<br/><br/><P> - <I>Nice to discuss a <A HREF="http://www.winstonchurchill.org/">Churchill</A> <A HREF="http://www.nd.edu/user/ndmag/w0405/gibraltar.html">success</A> amid all the

<DD>ÃÂ«The nebula N214, is a large region of gas and dust located in the Large Magellanic Cloud, where massive stars are forming. Its main component, N214C is of special interest since it hosts a very rare massive star. Using ESO's NTT, astronomers from France and the USA studied in great depth this unusual region by taking the highest resolution images so far. They discovered an unusual blob and the existence of two distinct stellar populations.

<DD>ÃÂ«Galaxies are so massive that they not only can bend light from more distant objects, distorting their shapes, but can actually magnify their light, making objects appear just a bit brighter.
This ability to make objects brighter, called cosmic magnification, is predicted by Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, but confirming it has eluded scientists. Now, astronomers at the University of Pittsburgh think they've finally pulled off that feat.ÃÂ»
