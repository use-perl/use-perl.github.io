  ><B>New method for trapping light may improve communications 
  technologies</B></A> 
  <DD>ÃÂ« A discovery by Princeton researchers may lead to an 
  efficient method for controlling the transmission of light and improve new 
  generations of communications technologies powered by light rather than 
  electricity.&nbsp;[...] [<EM>They</EM>] tested whether quasicrystals -- an 
  unusual form of solid -- would be useful for controlling the path of light by 
  constructing a three-dimensional, softball-sized model of such a structure 
  with 4,000 [<EM>count of one</EM>          
                
           
   ] centimeter-long polymer rods.&nbsp; [...] A quasicrystal is an 
  unusual form of solid composed of two building blocks, or groups of atoms, 
  that repeat regularly throughout the structure with two different spacings. 
  [...] They observed how microwaves were blocked at certain angles in order to 
  gauge how well the structure would control light passing through it. Building 
  the physical model was a breakthrough that proved more valuable than using 
  complex mathematical calculations, which had been a hurdle in previous efforts 
  to evaluate the effectiveness of photonic quasicrystals in blocking 
  light.ÃÂ»&nbsp; (<EM>PR; photo on PU site.</EM> ) 
  <DD>ÃÂ« [O]ur quasicrystal is far from optimized because it consists solely of 
  thin rods connecting lattice points. A [...] more equal filled/void ratio 
  would reduce polarization effects and enhance the gap overlap while 
  maintaining the nearly spherical Brillouin zone. Laser tweezers used for 
  particle trapping or two-photon polymerization would allow the construction of 
  a quasicrystalline matrix of dielectric components with a photonic bandgap in 
  the visible spectrum.ÃÂ» [<EM>Conclusion of preprint</EM>]

  Traffic Congestion</STRONG></A> 
  <DD>ÃÂ« In all networks, like road or airline traffic networks, the Internet, 
        cancer tumors or industry supply chains, you need to pass packets from 
        node to node, such as cars, information or data. But which are the most 
        efficient, decentralized networks or hub-like centralized ones? 
        According to <EM><A 
  href="http://www.trnmag.com/Stories/2005/072705/Traffic_model_maps_congestion_072705.html">Technology 
  Research News</A>  </EM> (TRN), researchers from 
        Oxford University, U.K., have designed <A 
        href="http://www.trnmag.com/Stories/2005/072705/Traffic_model_maps_congestion_072705.html"><STRONG>a 
        model which maps traffic congestion</STRONG></A>. This model combines 
        roads going through the center of a city and other ones avoiding it. And 
        they found that, from a cost point of view, it would be sometimes better 
        to close roads going through cities than adding more. They also think 
        that these conclusions can be applied to almost all kinds of networks, 
        biological ones or created by humans. ÃÂ» [RP]
        <BR>
        
        <P>ÃÂ«Researchers from Oxford University in England have tackled 
          the problem [of network optimization] by examining the congestion 
          costs within a network model that combines paths that go around the 
          perimeter of the network and central hubs that provide shorter paths 
          through the network. Real-world networks are too complicated to 
          describe exactly mathematically. The researchers' model is simple 
          enough to solve exactly, yet realistic enough to provide insights into 
          real networks.
        <BR>The research is aimed at finding ways to ease bottlenecks 
          in networks involving manufacturing, the Internet and traffic, and 
          ways to disrupt networks like tumor blood flow and terrorist supply 
          chains. The findings could also help design better 
      networks. ÃÂ» [OU]
