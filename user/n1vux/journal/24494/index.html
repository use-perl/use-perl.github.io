<DD>ÃÂ«"The <A 
href="http://www.lofar.org/">LOFAR</A> (Low Frequency Array) telescope is a new 
IT radio-telescope which will use about 20,000 simple radio antennae when it's 
completed in 2008. At this time, it will cover an area with a diameter of 360 
kilometers centered over the Netherlands. Its small radio antennae will detect 
radio wavelengths up to 30 meters, and because the ionosphere can bend some of 
these radio waves, the Lofar images might be somewhat blurry. So all the 
information captured by these antennae will be digitized and sent to a computing 
facility at a rate of 22 terabits/second today, and almost 50 terabits/second in 
2010. This is the reason why Lofar needs Stella, an IBM supercomputer installed 
recently in Groningen, also in the Netherlands, to process signals from up to 13 
billion light years from Earth. Stella consists of 12,000 PowerPC 
microprocessors and has a computing power of 27.4 teraflops. <A

details and a picture about the Lofar-Stella interaction."ÃÂ»

<DD><A href="mathworld.wolfram.com/BenfordsLaw.html ">Benford's Law</A> (actually 
first discovered by Newcomb, rediscovered by Benford and then by&nbsp;<A 
href="http://www.nigrini.com/">Nigrini</A>) says that dimensioned numbers occur 
such that the leading significant (decimal) digit is distribributed 
logrithmically -- which is to say, "1" is the first digit 30% of the time, not 
11% as one might assume. (10% would be naively assume.)&nbsp; A more general 
principle is called "<A 
href="http://www.cut-the-knot.org/do_you_know/zipfLaw.shtml">Zipf's Law</A>" (<A 
href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ZipfsLaw.html">*</A>), whereby "the quantity 
under study is inversely proportional to the rank". These are both generalized 
under the category of "power laws" and <A 
href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Self-Similarity.html">self-similar 
scaling</A> phenomena, which are the subject matter of Chaos, Fractals, and 
Dynamical Systems. This has lead to a <A 
href="http://www.aicpa.org/pubs/jofa/may1999/nigrini.htm">recent advance in 
forensic accounting and auditing</A>, to the extend that there is now a 
best-practice&nbsp;<A 
href="http://www.auditnet.org/articles/JFA-V-1-17-34.pdf" >Auditor's guidance on 
Benford's Law</A>. More recently, <A 
href="http://blogs.salon.com/0001330/2004/09/25.html#a1786">Benford Law on 
Leading <STRONG>two </STRONG>digits</A> was applied to Venezualian electoral 
forensics.
<P>The lastest studies in theoretical physics deconstruct the <A 
href="http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0504185">Frequency of occurrence of numbers 
in the World Wide Web</A>&nbsp;as a <STRONG>sum </STRONG>of power-law 
  distributions. 
  
  <BLOCKQUOTE>  <br/><br/><P>ÃÂ«The detailed statistics of numbers in the World Wide 
    Web [show] that their distribution is a heavy-tailed dependence which splits 
    in a set of power-law ones. In particular, we find that the frequency of 
    numbers associated to western calendar years shows an uneven behavior: 2004 
    represents a `singular critical' point, appearing with a strikingly high 
    frequency; as we move away from it, the decreasing frequency allows us to 
    compare the amounts of existing information on the past and on the future. 
    Moreover, while powers of ten occur extremely often, allowing us to obtain 
    statistics up to the huge 10^127, `non-round' numbers occur in a much more 
    limited range, the variations of their frequencies being dramatically 
    different from standard statistical fluctuations. These findings provide a 
    view of the array of numbers used by humans as a highly non-equilibrium and 
    inhomogeneous system, and shed a new light on an issue that, once fully 
    investigated, could lead to a better understanding of many sociological and 
    psychological phenomena.ÃÂ»</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
