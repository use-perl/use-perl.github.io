  <B>Einstein Year 2005: Measuring the shape of distant stars using 
  gravitational microlensing</B></A>
<DD>ÃÂ« An international team 
  of astronomers has used a phenomenon first predicted by Einstein in 1936, 
  called gravitational lensing, to determine the shape of stars. This 
  phenomenon, due to the effect of gravity on light rays, led to the development 
  of gravitational optics techniques, among them gravitational microlensing. It 
  is the first time that this well-known technique has been used to determine 
  the shape of a star. ÃÂ»

sees orbiting stars flooding space with gravitational waves</B></A>
<DD>ÃÂ«A scientist using NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory 
  has found evidence that two white dwarf stars are orbiting each other in a 
  death grip, destined to merge. The data indicate gravitational waves are 
  carrying energy away from the star system at a prodigious rate, making it a 
  prime candidate for future missions designed to directly detect these ripples 
  in space-time. ÃÂ» 
  <DD>ÃÂ«The short orbital period implies that the stars are only about 50,000 
  miles apart, a fifth of the distance from the Earth to the Moon, and are 
  moving in excess of a million miles per hour. According to Einstein's General Theory of 
  Relativity, such a system should produce gravitational waves - 
  ripples in space-time - that carry energy 
  away from the system at the speed of light.ÃÂ» <BR>  
            
             
             
            
       
<BR>- <I>Now we've got a specific testable prediction -- we've got an object that theory says should be washing us with gravity waves,
and the frequency those waves should be modulated. Can we detect them? Are our current 
instruments sensitive enough to do so?</I>

  of weather patterns necessitates rethinking of reforestation methods </B></A> 
<DD>ÃÂ«Forest landowners can greatly increase the survival rate of pine tree 
  seedlings by changing when and how they plant, according to research conducted 
  at the Texas A&amp;M University Research and Extension Center . "There's been 
  too many (reforestation) failures over the last decade or so," said Dr. Eric 
  Taylor, Texas Cooperative Extension forestry specialist. "Some landowners have 
  had to replant two, three or even four years in a row because of poor seedling 
  survival." ÃÂ» 
<P>- <I>This could be significant to 
  even small foresters; fall plantings could be much more cost-effective as well as restoring the habitat quicker.</I>

  (Prime) Gap</B></A> 
  <DD>ÃÂ«Despite early hiccups, number theorists say they have finally proved a key 
conjecture about <A HREF="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/PrimeNumber.html">prime numbers</A>: 
that the smallest possible gap between two large 
prime numbers continues to shrink, relative to the natural logarithm of the 
smaller number, as the numbers increase. ÃÂ» 
  <P>- <I>This is related to the <A HREF="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/PrimeNumberTheorem.html">Prime Number Theorem</A>, 
  which counts primes less than N, but sheds more detail on the distribution of those primes.
Intuitively, this is saying that the gaps between primes do not grow as fast as the nubmers,
and pairs of primes can be found pretty much as close as one desires, 
which gives new hope for the
