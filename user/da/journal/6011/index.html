<p>I don't have a journal entry for day one because day one, I spent my time hacking on some code that I promised would be done Monday.  I like this wireless network.

I actually left Brown 100; I went to Dave Rolsky's "Alzabo: Less SQL, more (Data Modelling and OO)" which is a project worth investigating.  Alzabo is sort of an alternative to DBIx::RecordSet; it's a RBDMS data modeller, that also creates OO methods to manipulate the database.  Cool looking stuff, and at least with HIS demos, it seemed to make hard stuff easy.  Sort of worried by the program docs, where he says you should wrap Alzabo calls inside an 'eval'...
<P>
MJD's Tie::File talk is good.
<P>
Update after lunch...
<P>
"Something Something, Faster"- Robert Spier did an impression of gnat, which I have an excellent picture of (which I will upload tonight).
<P>
This was an Optimization talk gnat gave at OScon earlier this year.  It took three hours then.  Robert did it in 40 minutes.  It was excellent.  (more later).</p>

<h2>Eval</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Matts/">Matts</a> on 2002-06-27T18:06:52</h3>
I suspect Dave probably suggest to wrap Alzabo calls in eval (not exec). This is perl's exception handling mechanism, and does not have the "compile" overhead of eval'ing a string. See perldoc -f eval. Or come to OSCon and see my talk on Perl's Exception Handling Techniques.

/self smacks forehead.<p>you're absolutely right.  it was a think-o. Thanks..</p>



<h2>Re:Eval</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/autarch/">autarch</a> on 2002-06-27T20:28:12</h3>
No, I recommend wrapping all Alzabo methods in a little script (one per method) and calling that via exec()!<br> <br>Really, I swear.<br> <br>Talk about performance.  Yee haw!<br> <br>;)

Yah, the picture adds a lot, and it was definitely an applied talk.  I was impressed.<br> <br>I wish I'd had the oomph to set up the pics two months ago; it only took 15 minutes after all.  But I went directly from YAPC to another week-long event, and work took over when I got back.  <br> <br>I guess I didn't learn enough from the talk...
