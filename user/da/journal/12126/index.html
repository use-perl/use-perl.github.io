<p>Signs that I should pass up on a project offer.  This was a phone interview by the lead perl developer of $company.<br/><br/>1) He asked for a phone interview at 9:30pm (local timezone for both of us).<br/><br/>2) "We don't have funding for the project yet, but I'll know in the next two days.  Can I interview you on Saturday?"<br/><br/>3) "We want to have this done in four weeks. How many hours are you available between now and then?"<br/><br/>4) $company was so secret he couldn't tell me the industry or size, "but it was big".<br/><br/>5) "how old are you?" (this interview question is still illegal in US and Canada).<br/><br/>At this point, I know I don't want the project, but maybe I knew somebody to recommend to him who likes this sort of atmosphere.  Then comes:<br/><br/>6) "I'm thinking this could be a project for 3 people. But I might add a few more people if it looks like it isn't going fast enough." <br/><br/>As quickly and politely as I could, I removed myself from the conversation.</p>

The "done in a few weeks" combined with "throw more people at the problem midstream" instills unending confidence in me.
