<p>This morning, I locked my keys in the car.  On a hot day.  With the dog also in the car.  Due to Rover, though, I had the rear window cracked, so I successfully snagged the keys from the ignition with two coat-hangers attached together.  
<p>
The timing was particularly bad, because I was on the way to pick up my sweetie at the airport, and was early enough that I figured I'd pick up lunch on the way.
<p>
Oops.
<p>
So, this evening, I feel I need to breathe a huge sigh of thanks that the first time I've ever done this, I did it with the window cracked open, so that I only inconvenienced myself for half an hour, instead of inconveniencing both of us for half a day while some tow-truck driver did their magick.
<p>
The learning experience this time seems to be: have backups. Preferably, a box with a good magnet stuck to the bottom of the car.  And, of course, always check for keys before leaving the car.</p>

<h2>In A Pinch</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/chaoticset/">chaoticset</a> on 2004-06-04T14:53:46</h3>
Same with me a few years ago, but with no dog and no cracked rear window.  I actually ended up purchasing a crowbar from a nearby store and prying one of the doors until there was a crack large enough to get the keys through.  That car got sold and eventually wound up delivering pizzas nearby, but it still has marks from the crowbar.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
<p>
Good times...</p>



<h2>Extreme measures</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/da/">da</a> on 2004-06-04T15:36:02</h3>
I guess that works.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)
<p>
Yeah- if the situation were dire enough, I would've broken the window (rather than let Rover bake), but thank God it wasn't nearly that bad.
</p><p>
It turned out my sweetie's plane was late, too; I got there just on time.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>
