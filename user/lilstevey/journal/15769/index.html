<p>Not a bad week perl wise, and quite a busy on the social front too. I'm going to stay focused on tech for this blog though, as part of the reason for doing it is to keep myself motivated on projects.
<BR><BR>
On the debian box front, things are progressing nicley. Although I was out on tuesday night and thursday night until the early hours doing non-tech stuff, and had a Birmingham.pm social on wednesday, I've still managed to grab enough time from somewhere to get CVS installed, get it talking to wincvs, and download Apache 2.x, modperl, perl and postgres ready to get them installed, and I've downloaded a small number of the cpan modules I think i'll need into a seperate cvs module. I've always been a fan of keeping tiers of installs seperatly, and making all my cpan modules, so that I can stay aware of dependency changes, after all assumption is the devils tool. Spoke to a mate about Ant last night and it sounds pretty smart - I look foward to giving it a go.
<BR><BR>
As I mentioned above, had the Birmingham.pm social on wednesday evening, which involved the usual drinking of beer, and dining on food, all in all, another pleasant sesh. Got a copy of sams mod_perl developers cookbook to review for the <A HREF="http://birmingham.pm.org/">birmingham.pm</A> website, and first impressions are very favourable. Its a big book, and although I've only read chapter one so far, I've already picked up a few usefull tips, which bodes well for the rest of the book. Had some more thoughts on how I'm going to construct my first cpan module - its going to be sql related I feel.</p>
