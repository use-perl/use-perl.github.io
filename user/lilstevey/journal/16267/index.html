<p>Don't particluary like not having lekker days, so try to avoid them, but today has been challenging in terms of none lekker avoidance initiative.
<BR><BR>
Today there were some problems with the trains south of Birmingham, which led to quite severe delays, which has led me to owe my employer two and a half hours of life, however it was pretty unavoidable* as a train had broken down in one of the tunnels.
<BR><BR>
However, these troubles were amplified by a new condition they had north of birmingham called "whintar" - apparently itÃ¢â¬â¢s a season that happens between summer and spring, which coupled with the other new season "oughtum", they found a couple of years back which causes leaves of trees to magically drop off, now makes a total of four seasons a year - crazy heh?
<BR><BR>
Anyway, more on whintar. Apparently, they have discovered, that it gets pretty darn cold during whintar, and something called "fwoscht" can form on things, giving it a pretty, yet cold, white coating ( a bit like dandruff only less icky, and water based ). Apparently, some of this fwoscht accumulated on some of the overhead power cables, which caused chaos in the train network.
<BR><BR>
This has lead me to the worrying thought, that if a world class country like Britain, with all of its management institutes churning out truly exceptional visionary leaders can be unstuck by only a day of whintary conditions, imagine what a country like Switzerland's rail network must be like! I would have thought that if they did have trains, the timetable would be such a shambles that only the totally desperate would catch them.
<BR><BR><BR>
<SMALL>
*They could have course realise that the Wolverhamton to Coventry rail link, which is one of the busiest in the country, requires more than two tracks, and begin a project to expand it to four. After all, its so crowded that any slight delay by any service causes a domino effect across the entire timetable. Most of the land by the track is unpopulated, and the few bits that are could be doubled up, or a tunnel placed beneath existing track, but no doubt someone somewhere has thought of a few b******t excuses as to why that isn't palatable.

<h2>Wrong Kind Of Air</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ajt/">ajt</a> on 2003-12-10T13:56:18</h3>
<p>I blame this modern air, it's too viscous for trains to move through it!</p>

<p>It has nothing to do with nearly a century of under-investment and poor management, it's all the fault of air!</p>
