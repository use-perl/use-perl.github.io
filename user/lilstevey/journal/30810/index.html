<p>This has been one of the most exhausting days of my life.
<BR><BR>
Walking up snowdon on sunday was considerably easier, and less tiring. Don't get me wrong, it was enjoyable, and great to see people enjoying youself, but day 1 of yapc takes it out of you - the first morning especially.
<BR><BR>
Whilst for attendees its day one proper - tuesday being a "day zero" evening event, for organisers its very much day 2, after the previous day spent setting things up, and months ( or in our case years ) of preperation. Somethings are out of our control - despite putting a great deal of time into schedualing, there were always going to be capacity and schedualing issues, and the morning saw a little dissapointment when some talks were full, and people had to be turned away. I felt quite bad when I heard people hadn't been able to see talks they had wanted to see.
<BR><BR>
I missed the three talks I really wanted to see today, Leo's and Alisons perl 6 sessions, but I'm hoping I can grab a session tommorow.
<BR><BR>
So far, despite a couple of issues I'm feeling generally positive about the experience.</p>

I walked up Snowdon on Monday.  Shame it was so damned foggy at the top...  I chickened out and got the train back down, though.
