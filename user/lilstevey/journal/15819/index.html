<p>It was all going smoothly for a while, then I tried to install samba. I've never installed samba before, but I ought to have known it wouldn't have been straight foward. It looks like its working from a linux perspective, but whenever I run tests from windows, all I get back is an error 5. Some searching will be nescessary.
<BR><BR>
Any way. I saw Kill Bill the other day ( and again ) <A HREF="http://www.broadway-plaza.co.uk">Broadway Plaza</A>, a new cinema and bowling complex near five ways in Birmingham has been giving away free tickets left, right and centre. I wasn't to sure what to expect, but this is Tarantino at his finest. The attention to detail and powerfull plot, coupled with a sequence of cliche ridden scenes make a very powerfull combination. You can almost see him as a video store clerk editing bits together of different films to make his own productions.
<BR><BR>
Once again, there is clever dialogue "If I had joined the army 30 years ago I would be General by now", " And if I had joined the army 30 years ag I would be emporor, and you'd still get the saki!", and, just as in Pulp Fiction, he manages to mix humour and violence disturbingly well, for example the the knife fight in the house near the start of the movie, when the daughter comes home from school, leaving the two women standing smiling, faces covered in blood with knives held behind their backs.<BR>Unapologetically violent, whilst providing more depth than many other films, its a film that deserved to be made. Oh I forgot the music - once again its a bizarre mix of tunes, and sound effects which adds the polish to an already stunning production.<BR><BR>
I'll be buying the DVD as soon as it comes out, and look foward to seeing the next one.<BR><BR>
Just like other Tarantino movies, its a film that deserves to be talked about, from comments about the square Uma draws with her fingers, which is reminiscent of  pulp fiction, but fortunately not animated this time, to queries on why O'Ren sheaths the Samuri Sword when it is coverd with blood ( I was unaware of the faux pas until a friend pointed it out to me ). </p>
