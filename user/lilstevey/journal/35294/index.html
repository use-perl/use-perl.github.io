<p>I like portable computers. I like the convenience of being able to take a portable machine with me.
<BR><BR>
However, I have a small issue with the design. There doesn't seem to be a great deal of creativity applied to it, and they all seem to need this breakable hinge to connect the keyboard unit to the screen part.
<BR><BR>
Why? Wouldn't it be cheaper to have a screen with a thicker base so it would self support, with a socket for a keyboard and mouse - they are mass produced low cost components anyway.
<BR><BR>
And why am I saying this - because I had a hinge break on one of my laptops, and also because I view the complexity as a cost - the hinge may only be a small component, but when you add some of the other mechanical parts (keyboard and pointer for example ) there starts to be a lot of moving parts, which in my simple rule book means more bits to go wrong and hence more things to test.
<BR><BR>
And the simple all in one box form should lend its self to a kit form, potential reducing construction cost, increasing the ability to customise and making it simpler to fix things that go wrong.
<BR><BR>
There are downsides - the traditional laptop is quite portable - however I feel that a lot of Portability issues are easily met using the age old device called "A Bag".
