<p>I've been reading "Antipatterns - Refactoring Software, Architectures, and Projects in Crisis", after a friend leant me a copy and said I would enjoy it.<BR><BR>
Before reading this I had never heard of an anti-pattern, I had heard of patterns ( mainly through curosity after I began to notice a trend whereby any old project that involved a degree of seperation between layout and content claimed to follow the "MVC" philosophy ).<BR><BR>
AntiPatterns refer to common practices or software architectures that come into being due to either insufficient or misguided influences during a project life cycle( An analagous situation is where people hide there money in the cookie jar, or under the mattrees, because they imagine that no-one else would have thought of that ). - see <URL:http://www.whysmalltalk.com/articles/demers/rottenapplets.htm> for an example<BR><BR>
The AntiPatterns have names such as "StovePipe system", "Golden Hammer", and one everyone must have heard of "Spaghetti Code". The book is quite damning in places, but ( I feel at least ) that the negativity is largley justifiable, and adds to the pleasure of reading. Some of the symptoms and anecdotal evidence used ( such as "We're not sure what this bit does, it was written by thingy who left the company a couple of years back" ) adds to the quality and depth of the presentation of the material<BR><BR>
A book containing just the descriptions, symptoms and causes of these patterns, illustrated by dilbert, as this one is would be a good read in its own right, but this book goes further ( hence the refactoring bit in its subtitle ), to suggest ways and means of addressing some of the issues raised in the antipatterns.
<BR><BR>
All in all its a good read. Some sections ( Lavacode for example ) brought back memories of frustrations gone by, and I find it strangley reassuring to know that some of the flaws I have percieved in systems that I have worked upon are recognised, catagorised and documented. If you can find a copy it's well worth a read.</p>
