<p>I have a hobby - I like to gamble online occasionally. Not overly larger amounts, but just a little wager here and there when I feel like it.
<BR><BR>
Coral had an offer on where they aould give me a tenner if I paid a tenner so I gave them a go.
<BR><BR>
I'm not overly impressed with the site, and when it gave me a obscure message when I tried to put a triple on Arsenal to win the triple, I decided to write to the Customer Service Department. I took the opportunity to enquire why they did not offer a secure login, instead leaving everything over http, because its been bugging me.
<BR><BR>
I found the reply "stimulating", so I thought I would share it ( Names blocked out ):

Dear YYYYYYYYYYYY,
<BR><BR>
Thank you for your message.
<BR><BR>
Our Trading Department confirm that pre-season specials, ie clubs to win one or more specified triophies, were available at set prices prior to the start of the competitions.
<BR><BR>
Unfortunately it is not possible to combine your selection at the three separate event prices to do the treble as this does not represent the true odds (for this reason the bet is incompatible).
<BR><BR>
Whilst for technical reasons, we are no longer able to offer odds on your bet online, you may be able to obtain a specific treble price in our shops or via our telephone betting service.
<BR><BR>
Our IT Department confirm that for technical reasons with relation to our Security Certificate, we are currently unable to offer the login in a secure environment (as on our International site). This will however be updated in due course and we confirm that all account operations (eg deposit, withdraw, update information) do still take place in a secure environment.
<BR><BR>
Kind regards
<BR><BR>
