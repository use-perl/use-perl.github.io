<p>Hmm. we seem to have been suffering a little bad luck in the local eateries. Our Day -1 dinner seemed somewhat unstable in terms of quality - my girlfriend couldn't eat her meal because it was so bad ( Fortunately a few others have reported positive reports ).
<BR><BR>
 Unfortunately, my day 0 meal at the nearby pizza wielding bar also turned out to be really bad. Burnt, dried out and ridiculously late. I have eaten at the same establishement many times and its never been that bad, In fact its been consistantly brilliant, and I've only had cause to complain once before, for a slightly delayed and confused order and was more than satisfied with the result, this time however, it was so bad I couldn't be bothered. I sincerly hope that none of the attendees suffered the same fate.
<BR><BR>
I know some of you had a lucky escape, and hope in particular the "conceirge crew ;)" found somewhere pleasant.
<BR><BR><br/><br/>On the good news, the pre-reg seemed to go well at the bar, no doubt helped immensly by the onsite organisers and volunteers - I was personally flying round the West Midlands delivering, transporting, and collecting.
<BR><BR>
So far, despite the food, I feel positive, and lots of people seem to be enjoying themselves, I hope it continues. I hope everyone who has been able to make the time to come over enjoys it.</p>
