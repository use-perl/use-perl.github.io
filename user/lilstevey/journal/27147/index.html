<p>Multibuys and bundles have long been a way of presenting the customer with the percieved gain in exchange for raising funds for a particular product. I found myself approaching a deal from a different perspective this morning though.
<BR><BR>
I popped into a newsagent to grab myself a copy of one of my favorite magazines, and a bottle of coke. The bottle of coke came in at ÃÂ£1.19 ( ouch ) and the magazine came in at ÃÂ£3.40, giving a pocket damaging total of ÃÂ£4.59.<BR><BR>
On my way to the cashier, I noticed that they had an offer on, buy a newspaper, get the coke for half price. I asked the cashier what the cheapest paper they had was, and they replied that it was the star at 20p, giving me a 40p (ish) saving on the total price, as the coke was lowered to the 60p mark, bringing the total down to ÃÂ£4.19<BR><BR>The cashier then suggested, that if I bought the times for 60p then I would get a further discount, as the coke would now be free, and I would get an additional 40p off the cost of my magazine. So, taking them by their word, I did so, and the total went down to ÃÂ£3.79 - a further gain of 40p, as the cost of the times cancelled out the saving on the coke.
<BR><BR>
Tommorow I'm tempted to see if I can get a free coke with two copies of the daily star for 40p.</p>

<h2>McDonalds breakfast combo</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jmm/">jmm</a> on 2005-10-13T15:33:16</h3>
I had the same sort of issue pointed out to me a while back at McDonalds.  It is (or at least at that time it was) cheaper to buy a McMuffin combo than to buy a McMuffin and a medium orange juice.  So, get the combo and throw the hash brown in the garbage and save money.  Financially, if not ecologically, sound practice.

<h2>Environmental Aspect of Bundles.</h2>

And the shame of it is, there is no value in a second hand hash brown, or an old newspaper.
<br> <br>
Its not like you can ebay, or freecycle them - it is kind of inevitable that they end up going in the bin.
