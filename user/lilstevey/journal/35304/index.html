<p>Over the last few days, mesin, n me fine missus have bin watchin the bbc 1981 hitchhikers guide to the galaxy. Its been a thoroughly enjoyable series. We tried to find series two. We couldn't. It felt a bit odd that it finished in episode 6. Is that just our faulty memory and imagination playing tricks with each other?
<BR/><BR/>
We are trying to watch the filmy cinemary version.
<BR/><BR/>
deep thought.
<BR/><BR/>
So Very Very Wrong.
<BR/><BR/>
Relation ship between Arthur and Trillian.
<BR/><BR/>
Wrong. Why does it drag on so?
<BR/><BR/>
What I really really can't get over is that I thought there was more than six episodes in the tv series -  were the rest in my imaginanation?
<BR/><BR/>
Me missus is just asking where slarty bardfast is.
<BR/><BR/>
Help me. Tell me they filmed series two in the eighties... please...<BR/><BR/>
Oh yes. The jack daniels bit. Just tried adding it to my burgers, which generally tasted just plenty fine as I had em. Turned out they weren't any better, maybe a tad worse. Next time I'll stick to how they were.</p>

<p><nobr> <wbr></nobr>...but there were only 6 episodes on TV.
</p> <p>
Sounds like the film is as bad as I imagined it would be (after seeing Marvin on the trailer I've always made great efforts not to watch it!).

Drat.<br> <br>
I may have to try the radio based varient in order to get my fix.
<br> <br>
Slarty turned up in the end. I think I found the film mildly entertaining the first time I watched it, but it pales in comparison to the original.
