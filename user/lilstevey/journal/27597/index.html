<p>despite my best attempts to reduce the number of ongoing interests and projects, there still seems to be far to many, and I seem to be far too curious to stop finding things interesting.<BR><BR>
I'm going to try to list everything I've potentially got on or want to do privately, and then rank them and discard some of them.
<BR><BR>
First on the public discard list is my Cheese PC project. Originally conceived as a cheap way of getting myself a portable computer, the idea behind this was to use relativly standard kit in order to make a low cost computer. I got as far as buying and borrowing a LCD 12" VGA screen, power tool batteries, Mini Itx motherboard, a mini keyboard, harddrive etc, and getting a rough idea of what to do when I finally got it all plugged in.
<BR><BR>
The plan was to initially develop a mains powered, all in one box PC shaped like a wedge of cheese. the screen would be on one flat side, with the fat end of the wedge at the base of the unit, and make use of a plugin keyboard, stored seperately when not in use. I was thinking of installing Linux as an operating system, in order to keep costs down, and then getting more complex, adding battery power, improving portability and advancing the project towards a kit form which would probably involve a case, a cd or download and a list of standard components.
<BR><BR>
I think its a good project, but also a very time consuming one, and now I have coughed up the hard earned dosh for a laptop, there isn't the pressing personal incentive to get it done. Unfortunaly I never got around to buying a power transformer for the VGA monitor, so now I have to decide whether to buy an adapter and sell the screen, sell the screen as is, in an unknown condition, or buy the transformer and try to make use of its staggering 640 x 480 resolution ( A monitor for the router perhaps? ).<BR><BR>
I get the feeling that reducing my todo list, in the short term, at least might require an increase in current efforts, a lifestyle maintenance investment of sorts. </p>
