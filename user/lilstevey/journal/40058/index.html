<p>Not a great deal perly of late - winter solstice, xmas and the upcoming new year has absorbed much of my free time.
<br/><br/>
I thought it might be worth blogging some of my tv watchings though. Saw Avatar 3d in the cinema which was quite an emersive experience - not sure the story could have carried it without the amazing effects though. Highlight of tv thus far has been "The gruffolo" on bbc 1, closely followed by top gear - which despite what I perceive to be increasing friction between May and the others was still an amazing piece of television. If they do End it, I hope they manage to do a few one off specials such as the south america trip - It was up there with the asian trip ( was it korea or vietnam? ) and the african venture a couple of series ago or so. 
<br/><br/>
Anticlimax of the "holiday" was Dr Who on chrimblemas day. I'm dissapointed in some ways that Tennant is leaving, but very thankfull that Russell T Davies is moving onto new projects. I don't think that I could write as well as him, but thats because I'm a developer. How's this for an alternative last episode arc:
<ul>
<li>Corrupted by the events on Bowie Base, Who tries in vain to redeem himself, falling more and more into a spiral of self destructive behavour</li>
<li>
His "Daughter" returns - remember her from that cloning episode - and becomes companion for some of the adventure before realising that something very wrong is afoot.
</li>
<li>
She then tricks the doctor into leaving her in charge of the tardis key.
</li>
<li>
Who realises his mistake, and in something of a battle, takes an all or nothing gambit and gambles on his daughter not being able to re-generate, plunging them both into a certain death situation.
</li>
<li>
But... Who is wrong - Daughter regenerates into new doctor, scapering off with the key ... Who, corrupted by his own power regenerates into The master, played by Mr Simm.
</li>
</ul>
And with that brief blog I'll trundle off to bed and prepare myself for the end of 2009.</p>

Sorta like <i>Star Wars</i>? Or <i>The Matrix</i>? Or most any great sci-fi movie? I guess I don't really understand the criticism.</p>

<h2>Re:Criticism or observation?</h2>

Whilst I enjoyed avatar, I didn't personally rate it as highly as any of the three* star wars films, the first matrix, or what I perceive as other sci-fi classics such as The Cube, Metropolis, Bladerunner, or Sunshine - all of which I would happily go back to the cinema to see.
<br> <br>
My reasoning? I personally found the plot devices a little obvious and the story quite linear. I found the exploration of pandora delightful, the film charming, but felt it lacked some of the depth that would have been needed to make it one of my all time favorites. That said, movies are a personal thing, and one man can get out of friends what another would from spaced.
<br> <br>
<small>* my opinion of the most recent triligy of films sharing the title mentioned is similar to that expressed in south park's excellent critique of the most recent Indiany Jones film. </small>
