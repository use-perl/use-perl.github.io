<p>I've managed to get a bit further with my Garden
prep, and following a bit of time away, in which my housemate has been doing a sterling job clearing some of the rubbish which I have generated I think I am getting close to completing what I can for this year.<BR><BR>
Having cleared out an awful lot of weeds I was left with four reasonably large beds. In order
to keep up the feel of the garden, this now barren expanses needed to be populated with something.<BR><BR> Unfortunately, due to the scale, something larger than tubs was needed, and after a bit of contemplation I decided that just laying a load of grass seed might not be the most prudent option.<BR><BR>
Enter the magic of Bulbs. By shopping at Poundland, Aldi, and Wilkinson I've managed to get what seems to be a ridiculous amount of bulbs for somewhere in the region of twenty to thirty quid ( about 100 tulips, similar number of Daffs, and a fair few snowdrops, alliums and fritillaria, and a good selection of a few others ) which should give good coverage from February to June/July, if all goes well.<BR><BR>
I'm hoping for good weather tommorow, so I can finish the planting, hopefully give the lawn its last mow, and finish for this year. It'll then just be a question of weeding, waiting and hoping I haven't messed anything up.</p>
