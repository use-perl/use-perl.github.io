<p>I think I'm starting to achieve one of them - having signed up for french night school. I think there are three others left, but I think i've lost one for this year as I'm dubious with what I can achieve on the guitar front. Maybe that'll be one for 2006.</p>

Are you starting French or advancing?<br><br>I daily enjoy the cartoons at Le Monde, although many are regarding continental politics quite obscure to this American.  <a href="http://www.lemonde.fr/" title="lemonde.fr">http://www.lemonde.fr/</a lemonde.fr> (Right hand column, box labelled "Voir" (See) half way down with multiple tabs, click tab "Dessins du jour")<br><br>Wallace Stevens, late Poet Laureate of Hartford, CT (US) said that for him, ''French and English constitute a single language.'' I do see his point.<br><br>Enjoy!

I'm just getting back into it. I got a good grade in G.C.S.Es ( Age 16 exams ), but foolishly didn't keep practising, and almost all of it has slipped out of my head. I'm now studying a level equivalent to the year before the 2 year GCSE course, which is quite basic, verbs, tenses and such like.
<br> <br>
The main thing though, is that I'm doing it, getting practise, and next time I'm over in france I should be able to get by a little easier. It's the begining of a journey.
<br> <br>
Thank you so much for the link - I had thought of buying a paper on a regular basis, but not reading one on line ( Doh! ). Maybe after a few weeks of reading I might get my head around the  cartoons.
<br> <br>
Perhaps in a few years I will be in a position to appreciatte Wallace Stevens comment - for now, for me, there is still a great deal of work to be done.

<p>I likewise walked away and came back much later.  It's much easier the second time -- Partly because you've been there, partly because you're doing it because <i>you</i> want to, and you're reading what you <i>want</i> to read.

</p><p>I am pretty much away again now<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-( , but I know that's not permanent.

</p><p> <i>The main thing though, is that I'm doing it, getting practise, and next time I'm over in france I should be able to get by a little easier. It's the begining of a journey. </i>

</p><p> yes indeed.

</p><p>Paper papers have the advantage you can read them on the Tube/Metro/T and other places that even laptops are annoying or awkward. I picked up a nice, old (used) patent-leather vestpocket French-English dictionary to help me read <a href="http://www.monde-diplomatique.fr/" title="monde-diplomatique.fr">Le Monde Diplomatique</a monde-diplomatique.fr> on the Tube, when I was <i>really</i> into reading French (and getting a non-US/UK view of world politics).

</p><p>Enjoy!</p>
