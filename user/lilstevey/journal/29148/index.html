<p>And still the mission goes on. Having produced a prototype, that proved that using a java soap client to talk to a perl backend seems to work quite well for CRUD style operations, its now time to start tightening down the screws.

Axis seemed a lot more supported than apache soap, so first thoughts were moving the codebase onto there, and its looking quite promising.<BR/> After doing a little reading, it seems that document-literal services seem to be a better fit:

Although soap::lite seems a little cludgey for non-rpc stuff - any one know of something or a technique that would let me build a response from a stream of SAX events?</p>

<h2>SOAP::Lite</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/domm/">domm</a> on 2006-03-29T12:26:43</h3>
<p>I justed ditched SOAP::Lite in favour of some custom-written, specialised code (for MMS-handling). I'm basically using Template::Toolkit to generate SOAP requests, and various XML-tools to handle SOAP requests (plus LWP, MIME, etc).</p>

<p>It's just <b>so</b> much easier to satisfy various very picky SOAP-servers by issuing handcrafted requests that just work, than to suffer the never-ending agony caused by SOAP::Lite.</p>

Thanks for your thoughts. I've had some mixed experiences with SOAP::Lite. It did really really help me at first, and the learning curve for it ( at least for perl -&gt; perl comms ) was good. it worked reasoanbly well when I started using it for java2perl too, although a little a little kruft started appearing around the edges.
<br> <br>
But as I demand more of it the intuitiveness of the interface seems to go down significantly.

<h2>SOAP::Lite::Simple</h2>

I used SOAP::Lite::Simple to connect to the FTC's Do Not Call service.  It lets you write your SOAP messages by hand but takes care of lots of the boring details for you.
