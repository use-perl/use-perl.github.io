<p>I've had a few dealings with an online retailer now called <A HREF="http://www.firebox.com">firebox.com</A>, and I've been constantly impressed with them - not only for doing things right, but also correcting things when they have gone wrong.
<BR><BR>
My latest experience is quite cool though. I'm on there mailing list, and haven't ordered anything from them for a while, so they sent me a mystery voucher. I typed it in on site and it came to ÃÂ£6. I was quite chuffed - ÃÂ£6 to spend towards anything with no catches. So I found a "pettree" for ÃÂ£5.95. Its a living cactus in a keyring.
<BR>
So I placed the order, typing in my voucher code at the right point, and choosing the cheapest delivery they did - ÃÂ£3.95, bringing the total order up to ÃÂ£3.90 for goods and delivery with the voucher.
<BR><BR>
The very next day, the parcel company they use attempted to deliver my pet tree. They tried again yesterday succesfully as I made sure I was in. With the order came a free bag of sweets.
<BR><BR>
I'm left feeling slightly guilty as I'm very chuffed with my purchase and cannot see how they have possibly made money on it, so I thought in order to resolve these mixed feelings, and seeing as how a lot of the products they sell are <A HREF="http://www.firebox.com/index.html?dir=firebox&action=product&pid=1118">Geek Friendly</A>, that a mention on my blog may help me feel better about the transaction.
<BR><BR>
It seems to have worked.</p>
