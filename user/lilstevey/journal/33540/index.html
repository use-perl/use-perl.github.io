Hi,
</P>
<P>
I've been running a little campaign that may interest some UK based Perl Mongers. Its about Bog Trolls - those chaps who sit in the 'bathroom' in pubs and clubs with a tray of aftershaves and lollies.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately for the customer, the presence of the Troll isn't advertised, and the first time you hear of it is when you stumble into the toilet afting paying the pub in question for a few jars of ale.
</P>
<P>
Unsuprisingly, many toilet visitors do not require to buy food stuffs stored in a pub bathroom, and aren't that bothered by the sprays. Many Trolls then try to secure funds by offering an enhanced service - such as turning on a tap for you, or passing you a paper towel.
</P>
<P>
I have heard people tell of occasions when the troll has removed towels, or soap from the pub, forcing customers to pay for a service that should be complimentary. A search of the internet will yield tales of abuse and intimidation
</P>
<P>
I think it's time to call time on this behavour, and to preserve an important part of British Culture. Lets stamp this practise out before it spreads to every pub in the country. Demand your traditional right to pee in peace. Please sign the petition at <A HREF="http://petitions.pm.gov.uk/BanTheBogTroll/">http://petitions.pm.gov.uk/BanTheBogTroll/</A>, and visit the site at <A HREF="http://www.banthebogtroll.com">http://www.banthebogtroll.com</A>. The banthebogtroll.com websites primary purpose is to act as an easy to remember URL to pass onto friends should you encounter this whilst Drinking - I don't make any cash out of the ads.
