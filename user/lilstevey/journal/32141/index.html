<p>I've booked one trip to Vienna, and am now planning another one for later in the year.
<BR/><BR/>
For the later trip, I've started off with a flight to Prague. The plan is to spend the weekend there with the missus, and then find our way to vienna, before returning, possibly by another city the folowing weekend.
<BR/><BR/>
I'm now trying to link up the journies. It looks like the best option for <A HREF="http://www.internationaltrainline.com">Prague to Vienna might be the train</A> ( ÃÂ£49 for first class ) as I don't seem to be able to find reasonably priced flights.
<BR/><BR/>
For the return trip I am contemplating a trip on <A HREF="http://www.ddsg-blue-danube.at/english/html/e_lbud_fp.asp">hydrofoil down the danube</A> ( though it looks pricey ) to Budapest and spending the night there before flying back ( maybe via <A HREF="http://www.wizzair.com">wizz air</A> ).
<BR/><BR/>
Another option would be to fly back from vienna to an interim destination nearer blighty on the saturday ( maybe using <A HREF="http://www.airberlin.com/">airberlin</A> ), before making the last bit of the journey on the sunday ( perhaps direct to BHX would be a good thing ).</p>

<p>We're looking forward to meet up with you</p>

<blockquote><div>It looks like the best option for Prague to Vienna might be the train ( &#163;49 for first class ) as I don't seem to be able to find reasonably priced flights.</div></blockquote>

<p>Train is surly a good option, it taks a bit more than 4 hours, which is not that much slower (if not faster..) than going by plane (if you add waiting for check-in, getting to/from the airport etc). Though I don't know about Chech trains, in Austrian trains second class is rather comfortable. The main reason to travell first class are probably that there's less noise and a bit more comfortable chairs... So personally I would take a second class ticket.</p>

<blockquote><div>For the return trip I am contemplating a trip on hydrofoil down the danube ( though it looks pricey ) to Budapest</div></blockquote>

<p>There's also a new (since summer 2006) hydrofoil going to Bratislava, which isn't that expensive. But then Bratislava is smaller than Budapest, but it definitly offers enough sights for a one-day visit.</p>

<p>If you have any more questions, drop me an email..</p>
