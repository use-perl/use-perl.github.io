<BR><BR>
It might just be me becoming more and more of a grumpy ole get, but I got it lodged in my head that a lot of the ""problems" of this Country" can be put down to a cargo cult mentality.
<BR><BR>
Rather than list them all and turn this into a kind of rant, i'll just hightlight one, Cargo Cult Management. If I were being generous, I would say it could be due to a consequence of British culture, in that there can be a tendancy to promote to management to reward success, as if greatness in one role naturally implies greatness in another, and failing to recognise that in expert in a field deserves respect and reward.
<BR><BR>
Once promoted to the management role, there is a problem. Often there can be a stigma of suggesting that training is appropriatte, as leadership is often seen as a natural attribute rather than as a skill that can be developed. Admitting the need for help becomes perceived as an admission of failure.
<BR><BR>
And the scene is set. Fueled with the dangerous cocktail of self importance and ego over the promotion, coupled with doubt over their own ability, a talented individual is turned into a monster: having responsibility and power without the skill or understanding to weld it properly, cursed to imitate others and attempt to cover up their own failures for fear of becoming discovered.</p>
