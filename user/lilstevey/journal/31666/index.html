<p>I'm moving at the moment, and its quite a time consuming exercise.
<BR/><BR/>
Whilst the moving proper is done ( the launch if you were ) lots of little post-launch maintenance jobs are now necessary ( such as building a shed - couldn't have been done prior to lauch because you don't go putting up sheds on someone elses land. )
<BR/><BR/>
This has restricted availability, and as such time is a little scarcer, and trade-offs have to be made. One such trade-off is money for take away food - we purchase food as a service rather than preparing it inhouse in order to maximise the time available for our core activities.
<BR/><BR/>
This weekend we didn't have time to go food shopping, so we ended up ordering a delivery pizza in for tea from a new pizza place. I used them a couple of years back and they were alright.
<BR/><BR/>
However, the pizza took a while to get to us, and by the time we were at the 4th or fifth slice it was cold. well, not cold, but luke warm pizza. Either way it wasn't too tasty, and the missus chucked all references to the said establishemnts phone number. By this morning however, after a night in a fridge it was cold, and more solid as a result.
<BR/><BR/>
This morning the pizza was quite pleasant. I therefore summise there is a corralation between how hungry you are, the temperature of the pizza and the tasteyness of said food product.
<BR/><BR/>
I further summise the presence of a window in the temperature spectrum whereby taste is considerably deminished. This window lies somewhere south of "piping hot" but higher than "fridge". No doubt the major players in the pizza market have investigated this. I would suggest that the supplier of last nights feast had not, or didn't care much for our custom.
<BR/><BR/>
And there was me thinking it was just cheese-on-toast++.</p>
