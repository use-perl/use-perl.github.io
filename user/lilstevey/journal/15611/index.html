<p>All I am trying to do is copy some data off an 8 gig bigfoot drive, onto another drive so I can use a stripped down old PC thats generally falling apart as a linux box to do some development and testing on. it really shouldn't be too much to ask for.
<BR><BR>
I had another go at my preparation the other day. I managed to get windows 98 to boot of my ide 1 primary hardrive, with the bigfoot as priamry on ide 2, and a cdrom as secondary on ide 2. This works consideralby better than trying to boot off windows 95 on the bigfoot, as 98 recognises the cd without any worries.
<BR><BR>
The first problem I notice is that the PS2 mouse causes a conflict with the seconary IDE controller. So, I need to use a serial mouse insead, and disable the PS2 port. Apart from I don't have a serial port - as the socket on the case had fallen off due to the screws no longer holding. So I manage to dig out the motherboard to serial port cable ( its an old AMD K62 motherboard so on board sockets were a bit ahead of its time. ) Once connected the mouse still didn't work - I had turned it off in the bios when I unplugged the cable last time. So, after several more reboots I finally manage to get the serial mouse working, and resolve the conflict with the hardrive.
<BR><BR>
So now I can see the hardrive in system in control panel, but not as a drive. It doesn't seem to have a letter. So then I run Fdisk. The drive is apparently one lump of data, with no partitions.
<BR><BR>
Then, casting my mind back to when my machine was a mere P75 I remember the last time I had an issue recognising this self same drive, when I installed Ontrack to get around bios limitations. Looking at the maxtor website it looks like this might be the source of my worries. So now I have to find a way of removing it. Not too sure if just blasting the mbr is the best way fowards so I might see if I can dig up a copy of ontrack on floppy, and see if I can find a floppy drive to bung into this box. It is becming apparent to me that it would have been more efficient to get a second job and just buy a pc to use as a dev box from the income.</p>
