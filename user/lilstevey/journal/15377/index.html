<p>Finally decided to get around to getting myself a use perl account. Been a long time coming really, but been going on a bit of a get things done mission recently - not sure if its because I'm in the countdown to my 30th birthday ( quite looking foward to it, should be a good laugh ), or if its just winter setting in, and I'm trying to do stuff before I have to hibernate, but for what ever reason I'm here now.
<BR><BR>
Hopefully in the next few months I'll have helped to make a film see <A HREF="http://use.perl.org/user/barbie/journal/14490">Barbies journal</A> for more info on that one, Got my first module uploaded to CPAN ( it really is overdue, I just have to discipline myself to sit down and write one of the ideas I keep thinking of. ), and more immediately get my unix box up and running at home so that I can do some proper coding. At the moment I need to get some data off the windows partition so I can format it and have more space available for linux, and for some reason, my windows machine won't recognise a second drive, even though the bios does. I'm sure sitting down and trawling through google will yield some answers - maybe its a job for the weekend.<BR><BR>
And with that, I'll think I'll bring my first journal entry to a close.</p>
