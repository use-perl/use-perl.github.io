<p>Since I finished my changes to what will become the pluggable regex
API in perl 5.10 I've been working on writing re::engines again, first
on Plan 9 and then on finishing PCRE which audrey and yves started
(but didn't quite finish).<br/><br/>I based the new PCRE wrapper on the Plan 9 and upgraded the underlying
PCRE library to 7.2, and aside from a bug in how split is handled it
works for most of the cases where the Perl engine does.<br/><br/>Having wrapped PCRE running Perl's own regex tests under PCRE becomes
really easy. There are almost 1300 test for the regex syntax in
t/op/regex.t in perl core. Running these under re::engine::PCRE
reveals the following incompatibilities (and some bugs) between it and
Perl:<br/><br/>(?{}) and (??{}) tests fail (obviously). Getting at least (?{}) to
work might be possible with pcre's callout mechanims but I haven't
looked closely at that.<br/><br/>A few tests such as "bbbbXcXaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa" =~
/.X(.+)+X/ fail because PCRE recurses away and runs into its internal
MATCH_LIMIT while recursing. Using pcre_dfa_exec() instead of
pcre_exec() yields a match but the DFA routine has different matching
semantics.<br/><br/>One test fails because PCRE treats [a-[:digit:]] as an invalid range
while Perl takes it to mean a character class matching 'a', '-' or a
[:digit:]. Perl is probably being too permissive in this case.<br/><br/>"aba" =~ /^(a(b)?)+$/; say "$1-$2" will yield "a-b" under PCRE but
"a-" under Perl. That is, PCRE eats the inner (b) while perl goes with
the outer +. Both match the entire string.<br/><br/>Perl accepts curly modifiers on (?!) e.g. /foo(?!bar){2}/ but PCRE
doesn't. I couldn't get Perl to do anything useful with that
though. /foo(?!bar{2})/ works in both engines and doesn't match "foo"
followed by "barbar".<br/><br/>PCRE does not match <<!>!>!>><>>!>!>!> against
^(<(?:[^<>]+|(?3)|(?1))*>)()(!>!>!>)$ but Perl does. I haven't looked
into why.<br/><br/>PCRE does not support (*FAIL) and (*F) which cause the pattern to
fail, nor does it support (*ACCEPT).<br/><br/>Three tests try to match \x{85} against \R in an UTF-8 upgraded string
("\305\205") in a pattern that wasn't compiled with PCRE_UTF8. This
isn't a PCRE issue but an API usage problem in re::engine::PCRE, the
best solution is probably to upgrade all patterns and strings to
UTF-8 before calling pcre_compile/pcre_exec.<br/><br/>PCRE accepts numeric keynames such as ^(?'0'ook)$, ^(?<0>ook)$,
^(?<1a>ook)$. These all match the literal string "ook" and set up the
named capture "0" or "1a". Perl does not currently accept named
buffers that start with a number.<br/><br/>re::engine::PCRE doesn't support multiple named match buffers under
the same name while Perl does. At first I thought this was a PCRE
limitation but it turns out that I just didn't know about the
PCRE_DUPNAMES option:)<br/><br/>So aside from inline eval re::engine::PCRE is pretty much a drop-in
replacement for Perl's engine. And perhaps more significantly PCRE's
compatability can now be tested (and errors fixed) by running it
against Perl's own test suite.<br/><br/>To run Perl's tests on PCRE get blead and re::engine::PCRE 0.10
(coming to a CPAN near you), build it and run:<br/><br/>    perl5.9.5 -Mblib t/perl/regexp.t<br/><br/>By default it skips the failing tests, these can currently be enabled
by commenting out line 86 in regexp.t:<br/><br/>    @pcre_fail{@pcre_fail} = ();</p>
