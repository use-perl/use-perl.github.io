<p>I decided to create this journal after hearing how Casey West used it @ use.perl.org and figured it would be cool to give it a shot.
<P>
I became a "Just Another Perl Hacker" back in the spring of 1995 when I started messing around with the web.  I was a sophomore at the University of Nebraska at Omaha at the time and I wanted to make a national web presence for the fraternity I was in.  What started off as a small project snowballed into national recognition and I even spoke at two regional conventions and a international convention in Toronto.
<P>
I wormed my way into Ameritrade through my self taught knowledge and worked there full time for 3 years while finishing up my Management of Information Systems Business degree.  After I graduated I interviewed for about 3 months and flew all over the country picking and choosing over potential employers.  In April of 1999, I started with eData.com (now Seisint) and I work with very talented people and our group in very tight knit.
<P>
I went to Perl Whirl looking for a spark and I what I found was my passion.  I'm not sure what form it will take.  I want to start by setting some goals:
<ul>
<li> Get the local Perl Mongers up and running.  I tried once before, but I didn't try hard enough :)
<li> Submit some cool stuff I've done to CPAN.  I may just consider it play around stuff, but someone else may find it very useful.
<li> Attend as many Perl conferences as I can and have a Perl training budget that is separate from my normal savings.
<li> Follow Perl 6!  After Damian's Perl 6 talks and literally watching the language take shape before me, I've really looking forward to what the future holds. :)
<li> Last but not least, ADVOCATE PERL!  
</ul>
Perl Whirl was great and I actually lost weight even though the food didn't stop coming.  I worked out as frequently as I could and Heather made sure we got all the great excursions (a couple really wiped me out).
<p>
Thank you Casey for the suggestion to start the journal and hopefully I'll be meeting a lot more cool and interesting people in the Perl Community.
<P>
