<p>I'm jazzed because Adam Glass of FLUX (Florida Linux Users eXchange) has asked me to do a Debian install presentation.  I really enjoy using Debian because all the work is taken out of compiling things.  Most people complain because Debian is harder to install than most distros, but once you get past the install its smooth sailing.  Not only that, but because Debian is completely volunteer, to upgrade your packages is free (no more downloading and burning ISOs) :)
<p>
I've also gotten everyone in the office switch to Debian.  At first they gave me crap for even suggesting it, but once I got it installed, they realized how easy it is to maintain and UPGRADE.
<p>
My only real goal for the presentation is to open people's mind to the Debian packaging system and show them how easy it can be.

Debian was a bitch for me. I'm going back to Mandrake.
<br>
<br>With Debian I got broken upgrades, fuxored dselect, terrible laptop install, no sound, no apm, no networking after boot. I'll be glad to be rid of it.
<br>
<br>And Mandrake has urpmi now, so all the hoo-ha over apt-get is over, IMHO.

Debian on a laptop is even harder to do becasue of all the propritry hardware.  I had the EXACT same problems you're talking about (networking, apm, etc) .  I got sound to work, but only after reading a couple of cryptic HOWTOs.  But I'm still going to stick with Debian because I've figured out most of the issues, and in doing so, I've found out how stuff actually works.

I'd accept that argument if Mandrake didn't install and detect everything perfectly smoothly. *shrug*
<br>
<br>Yeah, I got sound and networking working too, but only after spending way too much time on it. And my time is worth more than that to me.
