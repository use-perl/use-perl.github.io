<p>Awhile ago I came across this <a href="http://www.jbisbee.com/perl/callerid/bcidl-1.0.14.tgz">perl script</a> that would use your modem as a caller id and would read the data coming in over the phone line and do something with it.  Until now, I've been logging my calls to a MySQL database and pulling them up through a web browser <a href="http://biz.dyndns.org:8080/">here</a>.
<p>
This weekend I got thinking about logging my e-mail as it 
came in to a transparent term at the bottom of my display and  make it stack below.  I got that working just fine by
 adding some hooks into my Mail::Audit script that printed the "from" and "subject" of my e-mails to a log that I could tail.
<p>
 Once I got e-mail logging to work, I though it would be cool to also log my phone calls to the same file.  The problem was that the modem was hooked up to my server and the log file was my workstation. It turns out that they guy who wrote this caller id script
thought all of this in advance, so build in, is a daemon 
that requires you to authorize yourself with a user name, password, hostname, and port (the hostname and port is where
you plan on listening for the UDP broadcasts).
<p>
Now that I have e-mail and my phone calls logging through
 common interface, I had another fun idea.  In the past 
when I played with <a href="http://www.misterhouse.net">misterhouse</a>, I came
across
<a href="http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/festival/">festival</a> text-to-speech synthesis and figured it would be
really cool if I could add hooks to say a certain phrase
for a particular e-mail address or phone number that came 
through.  I decided to do a little hash lookup on phone 
number or e-mail address that would provide the phrase that  I want festival to say.
<p>
With the help of Perl I can alert myself of important e-mails and screen calls in style :)
