<p>What are recommendations the tools that you use to build, test, automate change logs, and release your CPAN modules?  About 2 years ago I used Module::Release, but at this point I'm looking to re-evaluate my options.</p>

<h2>Module::Install</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/hanekomu/">hanekomu</a> on 2008-06-24T14:34:08</h3>
<p>Module::Install works for all of my distributions, and a combination of svk, ShipIt, Module::Changes and Dist::Joseki makes releasing all painless.</p>

<p>It's a bit involved though; I'd like to write about my toolchain if and when I get the time...</p>

<p>What don't you like, or what is missing, from Module::Release that would make it work for you? Maybe I can fix that.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

I remember that after version 1.12 (the patch you got from Ken Williams) the module stopped working for me.  I had to backport to an old version to get things going again.<br/><br/>I should have dug a bit and let you know what broke, but I was too lazy at the time.  (My own fault)  Looking now, it seems there are hooks for svn and git so it looks like I'll give it another go.<br/><br/>-Jeff

It's been a long time since I've posted anything to use.perl.org and I'm wondering if I'm missing the link to edit the contents of my previous comment.

<p>Let me know if there is anything else you need in Module::Release.</p><p>The trick, however, is not to rely on what Module::Release does, but how it does it so you can extend it on your own. I never really meant it to be used out of the box. Customize the release script to do whatever you need it to do.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p><p>(and no, you don't get to edit previous replies, just the top-level posts).<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>
