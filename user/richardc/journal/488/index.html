<p>Okay, so I hate the web.  That's an oversimplification and of course I'm using a browser to type this in, but soon I'll put a stop to it once I write a counterpart to j2m[0], but for now this is really sucking.<br/><br/>
Right now I need to vent about kmtrace - the KDE version of mtrace.<br/><br/>kmtrace, like mtrace before it, is a memory leak hunter.   It's good at it, in a quick roundup I did a while back I didn't find anything else that worked quite so well.  Let's however cut to the chase, I'm not venting to sing it's praises.<br/><br/>So anyway, after a few days using it, and being prodded by Leon, I start to build a few automated tests using it for gravel's[1] libswfparse.<br/><br/>All is fine, then halfway through the test run it starts segfaulting, and won't stop.<br/><br/>"Crimeny!"[2] I think, "I seem to have broken something badly here"<br/><br/>So I wander away, then wander back and go to the first resort of an idle debugger, strace.<br/><br/>It turns out that when kmtrace runs it creates a tempfile named a bit like ~/.kde/tmp-`host`/kmtrace[A-Z]+.tmp, then neglects to remove it.  Sooner or later it tries to permute itself a new name, buffer overruns itself and dies in flames.<br/><br/>So, answers on a postcard - should I be running some other part of KDE to watch and reap ~/.kde/tmp-`host`/[3] or is kmtrace just ropey, and should I file a bug report there rather than just complain here?<br/><br/>Software - I wouldn't trust it, I've seen who writes it.<br/><br/>[0] <a href="http://unixbeard.net/user/richardc/lab/journal_to_mail/j2m">http://unixbeard.net/user/richardc/lab/journal_to_mail/j2m</a><br/><br/>[1] <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/gravel/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/gravel/</a><br/><br/>[2] Swearwords may have settled in transit<br/><br/>[3] I only run Konqueror and kmtrace from KDE, having my software looking like windows is of no interest to me.</p>
