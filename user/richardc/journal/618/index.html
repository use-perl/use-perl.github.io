<p>So, I'm back home now.  Journey was a little stressful, but that's what comes of being a bonehead I suppose.
<p>
I'm glad to say that reports of mirths demise were slighly  exhaggerated.  It seems the magic smoke has escaped from the LCD controler but it's driving an external monitor just fine.  I'll dig into it further when I've had a chance to back it up properly and sleep for a while - at worst I've lost it as a laptop, but it'll still make a decent machine for hacking on cross-platform things.
<p>
Had a great time at YAPC::Europe, apart from when I fluffed things.  Spent much more time hacking C than Perl though, which was odd really.  On the metro out to the airport I was drawn into some of mstevens twisted plottings, and threw in a few bad thoughts of my own, could be cool given a suitable tuit delivery.
<p>
Start work for object1 tomorrow.  Hope I don't oversleep.</p>
