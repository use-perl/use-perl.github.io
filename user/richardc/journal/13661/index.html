<p><p>Awoke with a mild headache, clearly it was sinus trouble and not possibly any form of hangover, oh no.</p>
 <p>Breakfasted with Belfast.pm, then wandered to the venue to set up my
 laptop for Nick Clark's <i>When Perl Isn't Fast Enough</i> talk.  Having
 already read chunks of the talk in an early form I helped Earle debug
 his DHCP issues and then wandered about a little.  Leon captured some
 of my soul in exchange for a nice orange badge, and I helped out a
 little with converting a flat-file based app to use <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?DBD::SQLite">DBD::SQLite</a>.</p>
 <p>Returned from lunch a little late and accidentally conspired in an
 interruption to one of MJD's tutorials.  Ooops.</p>
 <p>Checked in with Simon who had been doing chunks of work on <code>Siesta</code>,
 tossed a few executive decisions in his direction and started to catch
 up on email.</p>
 <p>Stole code from Ingy's Kwiki Slideshow thing to make flipping slides
 more responsive - using the javascript that visits the next link on a
 (simulated) keypress is much much quicker than launching a galeon
 bookmarklet from the command line.  I just got it finished in time to
 use it for my <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Device::Ericsson::AccessoryMenu">Device::Ericsson::AccessoryMenu</a> talk which I did as
 part of the London.pm filler hour.</p>
 <p>The CPANTS bof was thought provoking.  Some of the thoughts could even
 be classified as non-destructive.  Expect a flurry of hacking on that
 sometime around Friday.</p>
 <p>Went for a nice relaxing walk with blech down to the Eiffel Tower from
 the big needle thingy.  He took <a href="http://XXX.">photos</a>, I mumbled a bit
 about how to code up some more CPANTS metrics, though I'm very tempted
 by attempting a piescrow bot instead.</p>
 <p>Got back to the hotel and ran into a chunk of Belfast.pm and Mark
 playing cards.  Diabolical schemes were plotted over pizza, and we
 were warned of the complexities of paying for cabs over the water.</p>
 <p>Being too hot too sleep I knocked a few things off the <code>Siesta</code> TODO
 list taking us down to two items, one being a slightly tedious bit of
 the web interface, the other to batten down the hatches for a release.
 Now that's JIT programming in action.</p>
 <p>Oh, and retro-blogged to Saturday.</p>
