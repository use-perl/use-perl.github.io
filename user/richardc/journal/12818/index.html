<p><p>Realising that I'm going to have to play with huge mboxes until I canwhittle on the london.pm mbox, so to get some testing done more
quickly hacked in a caching stage with <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Storable">Storable</a>.  Now mbox load is
about 2 seconds compared to 60 or so, but that's just because we just
pull in the preparsed messages.</p>
<hr />
<p>Wrote some skeletal internals docs for Mariachi.pm.  Realised I could
fit 'reticulating splines' into the output, so I did.</p>
<hr />
<p>Simon tried to tell me that I was referencing Sim City 2000 (from back
in '95), for it speaks the words 'reticulating splines', but no, it
was Populous from 1989, which just used to print it.</p>

<hr />
<p>Got slightly annoyed with the amount that my version of
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Mail::Thread">Mail::Thread</a> was drifting from SC's CPAN release, especially that
the patch I want to apply is getting so big it's hard to keep track of
where I've screwed up.  Imported a fork into my personal svn
repository and rearranged the files.  Didn't really help yet, but it
felt so good.</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="http://sympa.org">sympa</a> has a really gay acronym for a name.  Maybe
it's because it's French.</p>
<pre> # Sympa - SYsteme de Multi-Postage Automatique</pre>
<hr />
<p>Just installed <a href="http://bugzilla.org/">Bugzilla</a> on a clients server.
That step was easy enough - just install some modules, copy your files
into a directory on the webserver, tweak apache, create a database,
edit a file, run a script - but sweet jesus, is that thing still ugly.
Just the view/update bug page makes me want to retch.</p>
<p>Sure it's learnable - the client has long since learned it which is
why we're lumbered with using it - but even for simple things it just
causes me pain.  Just what joker thought it'd be smart to put the add
comment box on the other side of the close buttons far far away from
the existing description and comments?  Their time shalt come, you
mark my words.</p>
<p>Argh!</p>
<p>I find myself hoping people will log more bugs over at
<a href="http://rt.cpan.org">rt.cpan.org</a>, just so I can spend some more time
with RT.</p>
<hr />
<p>Fucked about with the layout of this again, as getting ranty runs over
multiple paragraphs.  Now "\n--\n" is an entry marker, "\n----\n" is a
day.</p>
<p>Of course now I'm thinking about redoing it in wiki-format, or maybe
pod, with a -&gt;HTML/RSS formatter for if/when this goes public.  Those
wheels just keep getting reinvented.</p>
<hr />
<p>Yes. pod it is.</p>
<hr />
<p>Got back from pub.  Moved the common code between
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Email::Folder::Mbox">Email::Folder::Mbox</a> and <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Email::Folder::Maildir">Email::Folder::Maildir</a> into
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Email::Folder::Reader">Email::Folder::Reader</a>, and then started to think about adding
documentation to the rest of <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Mariachi">Mariachi</a>.</p>
<p>Said thinking got sidetracked by updating my work CD wallet.</p>
