<div class="span8">
<p><h2>Overly and repeatedly dumb.</h2> <p>So today I figured it'd be a good enough time to try and speedup
 Timesink some.  For those not keenly stalking me or my pet projects
 <a href="http://unixbeard.net/svn/richardc/timesink">Timesink</a> is my web-based
 RSS aggregator which I wrote a while back on migrating away from
 a dying mac and NetNewsWire.</p>
 <p>Anyway, there are a couple of parts of it which are kinda slow, one is
 the "what's unseen" calculation in the web frontend, and another is
 the scraper.</p>
 <p>Now the unseen code looks like this:</p>
 <pre> package Timesink::DBI::Subscriber;</pre>
 <pre>
 sub unseen {
      my $self = shift;
      my $feed = shift;
      my ($sub) = Timesink::DBI::Subscription->search({ feed => $feed,
                                                        subscriber => $self });
      my %seen = map { $_->item => 1 } $sub->seen;
      return grep { !$seen{ $_ } } $feed->items;
  }</pre>
 <p>That is; given the subscriber find out how many items in a given feed
 are unseen by that subscriber.  That you get the actual objects is
 somewhat a side effect as the web inferface only really cares about
 the final count.</p>
 <p>Okay I think, after determining that this is the slow spot with
 <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Devel::Profiler">Devel::Profiler</a>, time to rewrite that as a quick SQL query.  </p>
 <p>Small flaw in that plan, my live instance runs on mysql 4.0.16, and
 won't get upgraded till 4.1 until <a href="http://debian.org">debian unstable</a>
 does that for me, so I'm stuck with <a href="http://www.mysql.com/doc/en/Rewriting_subqueries.html">painful rewriting to emulate it</a>.  After
 about half an hour of that, I eventually admited defeat and added this
 comment:</p>
 <pre>
  +# XXX I be the slowest routine in Christendom.  a sub-select would
  +# probably help, if mysql 4.0 wasn't lame.</pre>
 <p>So moving on to the second step.  Work on the speed of the scraper.</p>
 <p>Now the scraper itself is fairly quick, it's only really waiting on
 upstream servers handing out RSS documents to parse, so if I could
 just parallelise the downloading that it's going to take less time,
 even if it's not really quicker.</p>
 <p>Now I could see two ways around that, something finicky with
 <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?LWP::Parallel">LWP::Parallel</a> or the brute force forking of <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Proc::Queue">Proc::Queue</a>.</p>
 <p>Given that I didn't want to rewrite <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?LWP::Simple">LWP::Simple</a>'s mirror routine I
 decided to plump for forking, just so long as I remembered to
 disconnect the dbh I'd be fine, or so I reasoned.  So this was my
 first stab:</p>
 <p>Before:</p>
 <pre>
  for my $feed (@feeds) {
     my $rss = $self->get_rss( $feed ) or next;                         
     $self->scrape_feed( $feed, $rss );   
  }</pre>
 <p>After:</p>
 <pre>
  for my $feed (@feeds) {
      my $pid = fork;
      die "couldn't fork $!" unless defined $pid;
      if ($pid == 0) {
          my $rss = $self->get_rss( $feed ) or next;
          $self->scrape_feed( $feed, $rss );
          exit;
      }
  }
  1 while wait != -1; # reap the kids</pre>
 <p>Spot the deliberate mistake?  Well even if you did, I didn't for a
 time.  Then <a href="http://rafael.net0.nerim.net/blog">Rafael</a> asked me why I
 was grabbing his RSS 30 times a minute.</p>
 <p>So I scratched my head, and eventually saw my mistake.  Back in the
 old single process model if get_rss didn't return new rss that was
 your clue to check the *next* rss feed.  Once I'd moved that into a
 multi-process model the job of the child is not to try again, but to
 exit gracefully.  The fix was as simple as:</p>
 <pre>
  -         my $rss = $self->get_rss( $feed ) or next;
  +         my $rss = $self->get_rss( $feed ) or exit;</pre>
 <p>Case solved I thought, and went off to watch teevee.</p>
 <p>Of course it doesn't end there.  But there's bonus points if you guess
 my next (and hopefully final mistake of the evening).  </p>
 <p>Yes that's right, I'd forgotten to install the fixed version of the
 module, so come the next time the script ran it picked up the old
 DoS-happy version of the module and looped all over again.  D'oh.</p>
 <p><b>---</b></p>
 <h2>Nothing for months, and then two modules come along in one day.</h2>
 <p><a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?IO::Automatic">IO::Automatic</a> and <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Parse::Debian::Packages">Parse::Debian::Packages</a> pretty much sprung to
 my fingers unbidden today, the latter a side effect of adding debian
 support to Leon's cool new <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Module::Packaged">Module::Packaged</a> module, the former is a
 TT-like trick extracted from some code I found myself banging on.  </p>
 <p>Enjoy.</p>
