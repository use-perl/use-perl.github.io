<div class="span8">
<p><p>When I joined <a href="http://www.fotango.com">Fotango</a>, I asked my new overlords if I could get a Mac laptop as my work machine.  Being good
 masters, or as part of their open source slave programme - the
 distinction isn't clear, they equipped me with a shiny powerbook (and
 after some supplier issues a working one.)</p>
 <p>The upshot of this is that for the last couple of months I've been
 migrating into it, and embracing stuff like iCal and Rendezvous.</p>
 <p>Here's a run-down of the kool-aid I've supped to date.</p>
 <p><b>---</b></p>
 <h2>Fink</h2>
 <p>I've always treated the system shipped perl with great suspicion,
 mostly because it's often old, the modules I want aren't packaged for
 it, and if I manually install/upgrade modules they get trampled by
 system upgrades.  As a result I generally install my own into
 /usr/local/perl5.xx and tend that while letting the system take care
 of itself.</p>
 <p>Well with the laptop I went with fink, because compiling binary
 modules against fink-managed libraries has bit me before, the system
 perl is a 5.8.1-era thingie (a late 5.8.1 RC at least) so new enough,
 and it's easy enough to write package descriptions so the modules I
 want can be made available as packages.</p>
 <p>It's going well so far, I got a
 <a href="http://unixbeard.net/svn/richardc/talks/fink_perl_packaging/">talk</a>
 out of it, and more <a href="http://unixbeard.net/svn/richardc/finky/unixbeard/main/finkinfo/perl/">package descriptions</a>
 than you'd normally shake a stick at (caveat: I rarely shake sticks,
 which may skew the sample).</p>
 <p><b>---</b></p>
 <h2>iTunes/iPod</h2>
 <p>Actually, I drank of the iTunes kool-aid with the release of the
 Windows version, but I have imported all my albums into the new
 machine.  With
 <a href="http://www.pol-online.net/index.php?page=freeware">X-Tunes</a> it's a
 dream.</p>
 <p>New to the mix is a 15Gb iPod.  Given that no new technology
 acquisition goes unpuninshed I ran into a typical iPod problem - my
 music collection is bigger than it is.</p>
 <p>iTunes has smart playlists, so I can say 'give me 15Gb of music', but
 the drawback is that I can say 'of albums' or 'of songs', and
 'randomly', but that either gets me the first 15Gb of albums every
 time, or incomplete albums.</p>
 <p>The solution of course was to write a
 <a href="http://unixbeard.net/svn/richardc/misc/ipod_playlist">script</a> that
 uses <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?File::Find::Rule">File::Find::Rule</a> and <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Mac::Glue">Mac::Glue</a> to populate a playlist with
 15Gb of randomly selected albums.  Because that's a bit slow it also
 uses <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Term::StatusBar">Term::StatusBar</a> so you can see how far through you are.</p>
 <p><b>---</b></p>
 <h2>Mail.app</h2>
 <p>I read a lot of email.  OK, I skim a lot of email.  I used to deal
 with all of it using mutt on penfold, and then I switched to using
 Mail.app's imap mode.</p>
 <p>That was all good, apart from Mail.app's mail filtering rules don't
 want to filter into imap hosted folders.  That's not so much of a
 problem for my on penfold because everything goes through procmail and
 Perl in a long-tended configuration
 (<a href="http://unixbeard.net/svn/richardc/mail/">scripts</a> and
 <a href="http://unixbeard.net/svn/richardc/dotfiles/.procmailrc">.procmailrc</a>
 in the usual places.)  At the office however, the imap server is a
 magic multi-domain virtual-user setup, so running procmail just isn't
 an option.</p>
 <p><a href="http://imapfilter.hellug.gr/">imapfilter</a> to the rescue!  Though it's
 got a slightly quirky configuration file (and what doesn't), I managed
 to bend it to <a href="http://unixbeard.net/svn/richardc/dotfiles/.imapfilterrc">my will</a> and now
 everything is all well and filtered in the office too.</p>
 <p><b>---</b></p>
 <h2>Rendezvous</h2>
 <p>Or is that Zeroconf?  Or should that be
 <a href="http://www.multicastdns.org/">mDNS</a>?  Or is that just a part of the
 <a href="http://www.zeroconf.org/">zeroconf standard</a>?  I've a dread feeling
 that I'll have to put together another list like I did for the
 vCalendar debacle.</p>
 <p>Anyway, it's really cool to watch things show up in <a href="http://www.tildesoft.com/Programs.html">Rendezvous Browser</a>, especially if you're
 using modules you wrote to do it.  More services should advertise
 themselves.</p>
 <p>While I was busy debugging
 <a href="http://unixbeard.net/svn/richardc/perl/Net-ZeroConf-Backend-Howl/">Net::ZeroConf::Backend::Howl</a>
 George Chlipapa released <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Net::Rendezvous">Net::Rendezvous</a>, which I must install and
 play with at some point, as it could well completely obsolete my 3
 dists before I even got round to releasing them.</p>
 <p><b>---</b></p>
 <h2>iCal</h2>
 <p>Apart from the <a href="http://unixbeard.net/user/richardc/cgi/blog.cgi/os.pod/Friday_20th_February__2003_-_Fun_with_Calendars">adventure of parsing ics</a>,
 it's been really rather painless.  </p>
 <p>On my  todo list is to set up a private DAV share on unixbeard.net so
 that we can put household events like "I'm going to FOSDEM, feed the
 fish" in it, as we still seem not to have bought a paper 2004 calendar
 for the kitchen.</p>
