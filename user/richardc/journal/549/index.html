<p>Okay, so everyone's posting that they're going to YAPC::Europe tomorrow, but what the hey.<br/><br/>Cleared up some of the todo-list, some much faster than I really expected to.<ul>
<li>Wax::On Wax::Off has reached a state of written, with big thanks going to Paul Mison (aka blech) for doing a lot of work on the video encoding.
<li>Simon seemed to indicate a way to generate, and he gave me a book about make, the sweetheart.  Leafing through it I already see a few ways to make the build system on gravel that extra bit hairier :)
<li>Object 1 were goodly enough to offer me a job in which they're happy for me to spend some R&D time on gravel and other Open Source stuff.
</ul>
So that just leaves debugging driftnet, and getting to/speaking at YAPC::Europe.<br/><br/>(un?)forunately listening to ingy talk to london.pm has put bad ideas into my head, so it looks like I'm going to have to start a few more things, oh and my laptop is playing up too so there's that to fix[0].<br/><br/>Should sleep, though as ever I find it harder when I know I have to be up fairly early the next day.  Bah.<br/><br/>[0] If anyone knows why a wallstreet running linux would stop responding to /dev/adb[1], and how to fix that, I'd be really keen to hear from you.
[1] For those unitiated into the ways of the mac, the ADB device manages the keyboard, mouse and power management unit - if it stops playing you lose the use of the keyboard, not so good on a laptop.</p>
