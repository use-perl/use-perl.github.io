<p>It's been a while, but then I've been busy.  In the last month I've
been to YAPC::Europe (rocked), been through two laptops (sucked), and
started a new job which got me exiled to Edinburgh to be on site.
I've managed to fit in some random hacking in the meantime, and spent
the weekend back in London.  Anyhow let's skip to the end.
<p>
<p>
Algorithm::MarkovChain is getting factored into 4 distributions,
A::MC, the algorithm and a pure-perl hash storage implementation.  The
other three chunks will provide storage via MLDBM, DBI and Inline.
<p>
The Inline one is really cool, it Inline::C to interface to glibs hash
type.  That and some aggressive key sharing to make a 40% memory
footprint saving over the regular perl implementation.  It's notably
faster for the seed operation too, which was nice.
<p>
I'm splitting it to make it all easier to test and maintain sane
dependencies, but doing the testing is proving difficult, writing
tests before code really is the way to go.  The lack of tests is why
they're not yet on CPAN, but if you're feeling impatient take a peek
here[0]
<p>
I've also found a new itch - I want to be able to do a two-way sync on
maildirs and have the right thing come out of the other end.  Notes on
the tool[1] I may build to achieve this are online[2], code to follow.
<p>
<p>

London.pm took a trip out to Brighton on Saturday, more specifically
it was the people on #london.pm who could deal with the short notice
nature of the deal.  We rode ponies, it rocked.
<p>
Anyhow, on the train out we were chatting about documentation,
specifically forcing people to document their interfaces.  Suddenly
the idea of Pod::Coverage floated through the air.  mstevens captured
it on paper which he gave to me to turn into real code.  I drafted in
Simon for some extra glob magic but it mostly wrote itself.  Version
0.02 is out now[3], it's a really nifty idea, I hope I'm doing it
justice.
<p>
Writing it has also given me an excuse to play with Devel::Cover -
run, don't walk, run to CPAN and install that right now, it rocks
really hard.  All I have to do now is work at getting the expression
coverage up on P::C (statement coverage is at 100%, because we were
slightly extreme, and wrote most of the tests first), and things will
be superfine.
<p>
<p>

One thing I've noticed recently is that people are being extra polite
to me, while I'm looking more and more like a tramp.  Admittedly this
has mostly happened when shopping or dealing with people at
Airports[4] but even so it's a little disconcerting.  I have two
concurrent theories, they're practicing their customer relations extra
hard for comedy value, or they think I'm some eccentric millionaire.
Both are fairly cool :)
<p>
<p>

I've had a really inspiring weekend, let's see what the week holds.

from London, laptops rock.
