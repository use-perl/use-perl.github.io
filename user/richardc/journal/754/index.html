<p>So I'm bullying old versions of perl onto my laptop to test out Pod::Coverage (as well as some things for $day_job), I hope to push it back to at least 5.004_04, as yet I've only been hacking against 5.6.1.
<p>
Anyhow, sitting at the CPAN shell I tell it to install Pod::Coverage, which it starts to happily, asking about the prerequisites and installing them nicely.  Then it's my turn.
<p>
All the tests explode.
<p>
From a quick poke it seems that Devel::Peek has moved into the core, and grown the CvGV subroutine.  Unluckily this is the exact same subroutine that is used to identify if a subroutine was defined by the package P::C is examining, or just imported into it.  This is a handy trick, since we don't really want to come down on people for using external modules and not documenting the things that got supplied by them.
<p>
My first thoughts are to factor this out into a derived class, but that's not so great as this routine is fairly useful as a default, and it's an interface/behaviour change that would be best avoided.  Will give this more thought when I go home. Watch this space, or perl-qa</p>
