Terribly sorry for your loss. Losing a pet you've had for so long is incredibly difficult, especially when you have to make the decision in her best interest.



<h2>My Condolences</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Ovid/">Ovid</a> on 2007-02-05T12:11:28</h3>
<p>I'm sorry to hear this.  It's always a sad thing to lose a pet, particularly one which has been part of your life for so long.</p>



<h2>Sorry to hear it</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/VSarkiss/">VSarkiss</a> on 2007-02-05T14:50:27</h3>
<p>Shelby's picture is as beautiful as your sentiment.  I hope your heart heals soon.</p>



<h2>oh my gosh!</h2>

First of all I am very sorry for your loss!  I too just lost a very important part of my life yesterday, she was my precious dog named Shelby.  She passed away after a quick downhill slide, as yor Shelby did, into severe arthritis in her hind legs.  It got so she could barely get up or down without help. Like yourself I had my Shelby for 11yrs.  In my sorrow tonight,since I could not sleep, I came to the computer and did a search for the heck of it for "goodbye Shelby" and to my amazement your submission came up under google.com.  What is even more amazing to me after reading everything, when I looked at your pic of Shelby, your dog looks very much like my dog!  I miss my dog so very much and I know time will help heal but I am really glad I was up tonight to find your submission!
