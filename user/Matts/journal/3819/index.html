<p>Last night I went up to Birmingham to give my shiny new AxKit talk. Apart from lots of futzing with the projectors and display resolutions it went well, and I think the talk was well received. Apart from my talk, Richard Clamp confused everyone talking about attributes and perl internals, and amused everyone with his Acme::Your talk, and there were a couple of other talks too. All in all it was a good tech meeting, though it's clear that Birmingham.pm is in the early stages of development, as everyone was very quiet compared to london.pm. I'm sure we'll be seeing great things from them though.<br/><br/>Unfortunately both Richard and I missed our trains home as we sat in the pub yammering away about Perl 6, p5p, etc. Very kindly Robin offered to drive me home, as it was only 50 miles out of his way (?!?!). Thanks Robin!<br/><br/>Anyway, a good evening had, hopefully by all, and I'll get slides online later today.</p>

Many thank yous for coming along and giving the talk Matt, it was great advert for axkit, and I think a few of us have come away with a better understanding of what it does and how it works.<br/><br/>Glad you got home okay. Hopefully, it hasn't put you off coimg to another talk<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br/><br/>I have generated interest from some of the Linux groups, so there is a good chance it will be a bit noisier next time around.
