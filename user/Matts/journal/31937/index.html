    massively impressed with it. This picture was taken in the dark (just a
    small under-cupboard light in the kitchen switched on, enough to obtain
    focus), and yet you would never guess that.<br/><br/>    Taken with the flash pointing away behind me to the left so that the

<h2>nice!</h2>

Wow, that <b>is</b> impressive. To my untrained eye the light looks more like late morning through a window rather than dark + flash.



<h2>Bounce flash</h2>

Bounce flash is indeed very nice! This is an excellent example. I can't wait for my flash unit I asked for christmas =)



<h2>Photography and flash</h2>

That's great stuff. I've received many compliments about family photos after learning to properly use a flash unit. Which model of Nikon camera are you using?

That's the D70. A great camera that is still way ahead of my abilities.

I was considering buying a D70 because of the good prices with everyone upgrading to newer models. However, I was surprised on my birthday with a Pentax K100D. It has a 6M sensor which is a very close relative of the D70's. I frankly can't see any reason for anything more at this point. I'm much more limited in my ability to see and compose photos than anything else. It's a blast for sure.

Yup, and got a very good review on dpreview.<br><br>I sometimes envy the new 10Mp cameras but really all I wish for over the D70 is faster (and better) autofocus and better low-light performance (though I don't find the D70 bad by any stretch).
