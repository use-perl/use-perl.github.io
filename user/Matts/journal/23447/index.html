<p>Yesterday we tried to call BT (British Telecom) from Canada to get our phone line disconnected following the move. We did this from here because for a while I still had a machine connected to an ADSL line at home.<br/><br/>Unfortunately BT have outsourced their call center to India.<br/><br/>First of all we waited 3 times for 20 minutes on hold until the remote end disconnected us. Not good. Then when we finally got through the whole process took us nearly 25 minutes due to numerous misunderstandings occurring because of language barriers and misheard words. The best part was when the lady on the other end tried to give us the disconnection reference. It started with "DQV", but first I got "B for Bee" (which I assume now was "D for Dee" - useful), and then "Coo-eee". It took me about 10 minutes just to get the reference number.<br/><br/>No wonder we were on hold so long if a process that should have taken 5 minutes took 25.<br/><br/>Clearly this sort of outsourcing is saving BT money, which is good for the shareholders. But frankly as a customer I don't give a damn.<br/><br/>They really should have just outsourced this stuff to Wales or Scotland instead. At least then the wages go back into the local economy, but more importantly the customer would remain happy.</p>

<h2>Money?</h2>

<p>They're <em>making</em> money on all the calls they forwarding for you.  It's a profit centre!

<blockquote><div>They really should have just outsourced this stuff to Wales or Scotland instead.</div></blockquote><br/><br/>Then you'd <i>really</i> see some comprehension problems! &lt;ducking&gt;

I'm mystified as to why the difficulty of getting customer support isn't a top priority in reviews.<br> <br>I generally avoid companies who've outsourced their support (for the reasons you describe above, not from some form of national pride or whatever!), but finding this out when you're shopping around for a service provider just isn't easy.   (Word of mouth is the only way to discover it reliably I've found.)<br> <br>Of course, it's a moot point in Ireland and the UK anyway, being stuck with monopoly telcos for many services<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:(



<h2>Duh!</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Aristotle/">Aristotle</a> on 2005-03-02T15:23:16</h3>
Of <em>course</em> it's saving them money! When the customer gets frustrated about their support calls time after time they eventually learn not to bother. Simple, isn't it? Everybody wins! Wait, what?
