<div class="span8">
<p>At this year's YAPC::NA I tried to take a different tactic for the conference - instead of bringing my laptop everywhere and being anti-social I took my camera everywhere to be anti-social instead. :-)<br/><br/>I got some fairly decent photos. Most could have been a lot better if I just could force myself to remember one thing:<br/><br/>  CHECK YOUR SETTINGS!<br/><br/>I took so many pictures at needlessly high ISOs - very frustrating. I think I've saved most of them by converting to black and white (for some reason my eyes don't mind grain in B&W images). I've also converted some pics to B&W for purely artistic reasons.<br/><br/>I was also experimenting this week with setting the white-balance manually. I'm not going to do that any more as along with getting the settings all wrong too frequently, I also found that the builtin settings often got it wrong too.<br/><br/>The final boob I repeated several times was to leave the hood on my lens while taking flash photos, leaving a big shadow in some pictures. I've had to crop a few pictures quite severely to take that out.<br/><br/>I feel like such a n00b when it comes to photography. Which is all the more reason why I find it so much fun.<br/><br/>I'll post a link when they are all converted from RAW (probably take most of the day!).</p>

Hopefully not because you&#8217;re not converting them all manually? Or if so, please tell me you&#8217;re doing so because you&#8217;re touching each of them up as you go, not because you don&#8217;t know how to batch-convert them.<nobr> <wbr></nobr><tt>:-)</tt>

No, I'm touching up (only levels and curves and stuff) manually and then batch converting. It's very slow converting RAW to JPG on this Mac so it took most of the day (I guess Wedding photographers buy faster machines!)<br> <br>Now I'm doing the sorting process (moving things to different folders). Should be done by lunchtime.

Capture One is expensive but completely amazingly effective for batch "touching up" and conversion.  That's after you learn the somewhat strange UI...<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

I only bought C1 LE which is $100 so that doesn't break the bank. The only thing I miss from -Pro is the arbitrary rotation stuff. I'm kind of hoping they'll add that to LE in 3.8.

I took some pictures (mostly during the cruise) with my Treo.  On past form, they'll be horrible.  Blurry things that I hope will at least be useful as reminders of what I did and saw.
