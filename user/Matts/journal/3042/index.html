<p>More performance tests today (after fixing some mem leaks). I imported my 72MB axkit.org log file into an SQLite database. The import took a while - about 10 mins perhaps. Though I guess that's not *too* bad...<br/><br/>Following that I started doing some queries on it, like what are the most popular URLs, what are the most seen 404's, etc.<br/><br/>Results are coming back in under a second. This thing is amazing. I didn't even put an index on it, so it was doing a full table scan, and stuff like:
<tt>
SELECT url, count(*) as count FROM access_log
WHERE url like '%.xml'
GROUP BY url
ORDER BY count desc
LIMIT 50
</tt>
was coming right back at me instantly. Brilliant stuff. I'm going to investigate using this here at work for some offline query stuff.</p>

<h2>How's it look without disk caching?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Elian/">Elian</a> on 2002-02-22T17:54:46</h3>
I'd bet a good part of your performance is coming from the OS caching the file in memory. How's the performance look if there's not nearly so much cache handy? (Still good, I expect, but...)

I'm no good at that sort of low level thing... How would I find out?

The most sure way is to bounce the machine before doing the read test. That's probably a bit much, so the next best way would be to try the read test again after you're pretty sure that the disk caches have been flushed. Running Mozilla for a while's a good way to do that.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

<h2>Fork &amp;amp; Threads</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/djberg96/">djberg96</a> on 2002-02-22T18:12:14</h3>
How does SQLite handle fork?  Can a child inherit a database handle or will it choke (like most RDBM's)?
<p>
Also, have you tried using Perl's threads to run concurrent queries?  If you don't have a threaded Perl, there's always the "Inline" modules.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
</p><p>
Just curious.</p>

Well it locks the entire DB on updates anyway, so I wouldn't recommend it much for multi-user systems.<br> <br>I'm curious about all that stuff too, but it's hard to setup those sorts of tests. Well actually not *that* hard - I could just set it up under mod_perl, but I don't have that many hours in the day<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)

<h2>Third party support</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/lachoy/">lachoy</a> on 2002-02-23T06:01:00</h3>
<p>The next version of SPOPS, which will come out whenever I wake up -- I have a strict no-bleary-eyed CPAN release policy -- includes support for SQLite. (Oracle too, but let's keep on message.)</p>

<p>One thing I noticed is that SQLite doesn't seem to like table definitions with an explicit 'NULL' declaration. For instance, the following will fail:</p>

<p> <tt>
 CREATE TABLE testme (<br>
   id   int not null primary key,<br>
   name varchar(20) null<br>
 )</tt> </p>

<p>with a <tt>DBD::SQLite::db do failed: near "null": syntax error at<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...</tt> </p>

<p>Other than that, everything is peachy. Great work!</p>

Watch out for the memory leaks though<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-D<br> <br>I've got a fix for some of them, but I'm still seeing slight leaks. I'm wondering if that's not in the underlying library though, since leaking 1 scalar per request would see more leakage than I've seen so far.

I'm glad I checked the latest CPAN releases before releasing this version of SPOPS -- I see you put the   <tt>$dbh-&gt;last_insert_rowid</tt> method in, which means that I don't have to use the random string key generation method<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)
