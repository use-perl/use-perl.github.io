<p>It appears that sergeant.org (my domain) has fallen off the PIR. This sort of shit keeps happening to me - I'm starting to feel victimised.<br/><br/>For those that don't know, the <a href="http://www.pir.org/">PIR</a> runs the .org top level domain. Sergeant.org has gone on "HOLD" because of a DNS screwup. Unfortunately there's no quick way to resolve this - it's just a wait for them to re-enable me thing.<br/><br/>I guess the PIR's actions are a good thing - they help ensure that people are running things properly. I just wish there was a bit more notice given - I didn't find out until I couldn't resolve sergeant.org any more. My guess is they do this to stop squatters and spammers.<br/><br/>Ah well, just one more case of learning how little I really know about DNS :-)</p>

<h2>HOLD because of DNS?</h2>

Did they tell you what kind of DNS problem they put it on hold for?  This is the first time I've heard of a domain being put on hold for some kind of DNS issue, and I'm very curious.

The PIR record says "CLIENT HOLD" and I didn't receive any email or any other prior notice about it. If you can find out what "CLIENT HOLD" means I'd be very happy - as I can't find out from their FAQs or anywhere.<br> <br>I added a bogus DNS server to the whois records to see if that wouldn't trigger a re-check of it. Still on "hold" though.<br> <br>Anyone want to offer me outsourced DNS?

CLIENT HOLD is equivalent to the NSI REGISTRAR-HOLD, which usually would indicate that the domain expired.  It seems no coincidence that the registry expiration date on the domain is 19-Jan-2005 - the registry expiration date is generally extended by a year even when the domain isn't renewed, to account for redemption periods, grace periods, and all that stuff.  I'd check with your registrar about the expiration status of the domain.

You're right. It had expired. Yet I received no notifications that it was about to (I've checked and double checked). How frustrating! (yet I suppose it's good that I didn't lose it).<br> <br>Thanks for your help.
