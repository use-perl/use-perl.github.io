<p>Today I realised that after my laptop died, I had lost the sources to XML::SAX::PurePerl, because I had never checked it into my CVS repository (which is backed up every night). Thank god for CPAN eh?<br/><br/>Anyway, I downloaded it and immediately discovered that it doesn't work *at all* on perl 5.00503. Mostly because of some wierd issues:<ul>
<li><tt>binmode($fh, ':raw')</tt> for some reason this caused: <tt>Useless use of private variable in void context</tt>, at compile time. I got around that by sticking it in an eval"" block. I'm sure there's a better way, but I was being lazy.<br/><br/><li><tt>unpack('U*')</tt> of course doesn't work on non-unicode aware Perls, so I check the perl version and use 'C*' on 5.00503.<br/><br/><li>The different encoding tests of course don't work on perls without PerlIO. So I skip those tests now.
</ul>Seems to work, and I'd love some more feedback from people trying it.</p>

&gt;Anyway, I downloaded it and immediately discovered that it doesn't work *at all* on perl 5.00503. Mostly because of some wierd issues:

<br>
<br>It also doesn't work.
<br>
<br>You should check out the perlfunc entry for binmode(). It says:
<br>
<br>DISCIPLINE can be either of ":raw" for binary mode or ":crlf" for "text" mode. If the DISCIPLINE is omitted, it defaults to ":raw".
<br>
<br>Just drop the ":raw", will you? The result of putting it in an eval block just makes this fail, so the handle stays in text mode, which is bad.
