<p>I didn't really do much on Tuesday - winding down from giving my tutorial was enough. I briefly attended MJD's "Welcome to my bin" which was interesting in places, and I enjoyed pointing out that most of the things he has written are now part of the standard tools - I was That Guy (not really though). I didn't stay until the end because I was still tired and wired.<br/><br/>Had lunch with Geoff, although we didn't really get chance to catch up as we had a big table.<br/><br/>In the afternoon I mostly vegged.<br/><br/>Unfortunately in the evening I was supposed to meet Heather back in our room at 6pm, but my brain had wired in "Meet in the lobby of the Marriot at 5:30". So I screwed up really badly and that didn't bode well for the rest of the night. I watched Larry's talk, and Paul Graham's talk (which was excellent, even if I didn't entirely agree with everything in it - it was partially flamebait) and I stayed on and watched Damian's "Life, The Universe, and Everything". As always Damian was a superb and entertaining speaker but I was falling asleep towards the end and had a headache so I crashed.</p>
