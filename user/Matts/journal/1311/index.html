<p>So, according to gnat's journal, the 2002 TPC call for papers is soon to go out. That means I have to start thinking about what to talk about.<br/><br/>I have several ideas, of course I'd like to talk about AxKit, and the stuff we're doing here at work, and maybe the "Why SOAP Sucks" talk again - I enjoyed doing that. But beyond those, I'm not sure what else to talk about. 2001's presentations I did are <a href="http://axkit.org/docs/presentations/tpc2001/">here</a>.<br/><br/>Some ideas:<br/><br/>- XML::SAX and friends.
- Exceptions (again)
- Generating PDFs with PDFLib.pm
- "The Perl XML Talk"
- Non-compiler-compiler rec descent parsing in Perl<br/><br/>Is there anything specific that people would like to hear me witter on about?<br/><br/>(oh, and yes I'm going for a marathon again - I need some way to pay for my trip :-)</p>

well i haven't seen the AxKit talk so maybe you cover this (though looking through the slides, it appears not)
<p>
how about a talk on the process of building a tool like AxKit?  best coding practice, trade offs you made, success in interesting people in the work, etc.</p>

It's quite a boring story.
<br>
<br>I was already a Perl-XML geek. I wanted something to do server side XML transformations, and was jealous of other tools (e.g. cocoon) to do this. So I wrote one around mod_perl. It was pretty crap at first, but it evolved into AxKit, which is still crap in places, but better than it was. People got interested because I wasn't the only one who wanted server side XML transforms. And also because I was *very* noisy about it all over the place. Advertising is everything.
<br>
<br>It's getting to the point now where we can really clean it up a lot. And some of the stuff in there is really nice (like the XSP implementation), and I usually do talk about the XSP implementation because I'm so proud of it<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)
