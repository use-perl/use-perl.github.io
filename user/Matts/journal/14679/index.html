<div class="span8">
<p>There are many many modules on CPAN to parse emails. So of course I wrote my own.<br/><br/>I've had this email parser written for a while now, and while it deals nicely with RFC compliant mails I've wanted for a long time to add support for all those annoying RFC deviations - binary headers, binary body parts, etc.<br/><br/>So this week I wrote a test suite, bumped up the perl requirement to 5.8, and started hacking on a test suite that would include lots of problematic emails. Once I'd got the tests together it became fairly easy (though not <em>very</em> easy!). So now I have a mail parser that nicely handles binary headers and decodes them to UTF-8 (as well as doing the same for MIME encoded headers). Unfortunately I can't reveal exactly how it's done as it's proprietary technology (it involves a lot of heuristics, and a lot of evil test emails that we see). But it's been an interesting project.<br/><br/>Interestingly this system now displays more broken emails as the original author intended than any email client I have access to. Perl++!</p>

Are you going to release this magic beast?

Unfortunately I don't think so. I can ask about it, but the heuristics are probably considered IP.<br> <br>The other tragic thing is the API sucks. I wish I could start again with a sane API, but now I have so many applications that use the code I think I'd have to start again with a new module name.

Simon's Email::MIME never really got much past the "Design the first part of an API" stage. Perhaps that would be the right vehicle to usurp and make go.
