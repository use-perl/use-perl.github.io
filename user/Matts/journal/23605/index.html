<p>In moving to Canada one thing we didn't anticipate is having all these extra rooms. In the UK we had a living room; in Canada we have a formal living room, a family room, and a rec room. We also have a games room in the house here.<br/><br/>So yesterday we managed to fill the games room, which was the last big space we didn't have furniture for. For the equivalent of about ÃÂ£30 we bought a second hand table tennis table.<br/><br/>Last night Heather and I played for about an hour. It was huge amounts of fun, and pretty good exercise too. Now I have something that I can take my mind off work with.</p>

funny, I just bought a table-tennis table last week, to go with our table-football table and dartboard...<br/><br/>thinking of putting it outside in the yard for some al fresco ping pong.  I guess that's not a luxury you can afford up in the frozen wastes<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)

Not yet, but in a month or so we should be seeing 20C days (at least we were this time last year when I was here).<br> <br>Time to get our patio heater working...

Last month I was in Bangalore for <a href="http://www.tacticaltech.org/asiasource" title="tacticaltech.org">Asia Source</a tacticaltech.org>.  The organizers set up a table, which provided many hours of healthy entertainment.  I routinely got spanked at the table, but enjoyed every spanking.
