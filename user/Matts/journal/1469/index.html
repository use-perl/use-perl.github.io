<p>Today we did the leaves. We have a <a href="http://home.sergeant.org/NewHouse/dsc00080.jpg">rather large</a> oak tree in the front of our house, which has, of course, shed its leaves now. I'm a big fan of petrol garden equipment - it's better made than electric equipment, and lasts longer, and tends to be more powerful (grunt grunt). So I bought myself a <a href="http://www.machinemart.co.uk/product.asp?p=030610024&r=2177&g=123">Partner BV24</a> to do the leaves. It's great at blowing, but kinda crap at sucking. It rains a lot here so the leaves get heavy, and when they get sucked up, the water gets squeezed out of them and it drains away through the cloth back, all down my trousers :-)<br/><br/>So I resorted to blowing then picking up manually. And we filled 28 large garden sacks of leaves before we ran out. There's still a huge pile left. Ugh. Ah well. At least it's almost done.<br/><br/>We also got the remaining little niggly bits of the house finished: the board to cover the dropped part of the sliding wardrobes in the master b.room, unpacking things from the spare room, building the ikea wardrobe in the spare room (which allowed us to completely finish the spare room), putting up shelves in my office, and hanging pictures everywhere. It really feels like home now.<br/><br/>Overall, a very productive weekend (though no perl produced ;-)</p>
