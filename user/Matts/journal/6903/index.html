<div class="span8">
<p>I talked a little bit about closures in my Exceptions talk at OSCon, taking my description from Damian's excellent book:<br/><br/><i>"In Perl, a closure is just a subroutine that refers to one or more lexical variables declared outside the subroutine itself"</i><br/><br/>Simple enough definition, right?<br/><br/>Well one thing I got to thinking about is file scope. Does this definition of closure extend to file scope?<br/><br/>e.g. instead of:<br/><br/><pre>
{
  my $x = 0;
  
  sub foo { print $x++ }
}
foo(); foo();
</pre><br/><br/>we can have:<br/><br/><pre>
# begin file
package Foo;<br/><br/>my $x = 0;<br/><br/>sub foo { print $x++ }
__END__
</pre><br/><br/>.. and in a separate file:<br/><br/><pre>
require "file1.pl";
Foo::foo(); Foo::foo();
</pre><br/><br/>This appears to have the same effect - the lexical variable $x is outside of the scope when we call the function, yet that function still has access to the variable, even though that scope has "finished".<br/><br/>However I brought this up on #london.pm and two perl programmers I respect most highly completely disagreed with me that these are closures. And maybe they are right in that they're not implemented internally as closures, but I think they act like closures, and look like closures, so for me it's easy enough to think of them as closures.<br/><br/><b>Where was I going with all of this?</b><br/><br/>Well what I'd like to do is look into the adding some sort of "proper" class semantics to perl 5. Yes I know I should wait for Perl 6, blah blah blah, but I have reasons for doing this so don't try and persuade me not to (mostly its that I want to stop being the annoying person on p5p who has something to say about everything - the guy from MJD's presentation who ruins everyones ideas (most recently regarding YAML - I wish I'd kept my mouth shut), but who has never actually contributed to perl's core - so I want to get to know the guts and see what doing this would take).<br/><br/>Here's how I expect a class to look under my scheme:<br/><br/><pre>
class Foo;<br/><br/># I'm not hot on the "invar" keyword, but it's only syntax ;-)
invar $x;
invar $y;<br/><br/>sub set_x {
  my ($param) = shift;
  $x = $param;
}<br/><br/>sub get_x {
  $x;
}
</pre><br/><br/>The idea being that $x and $y there would be "instance variables". Now really this requires a totally new variable type in perl (as far as I can tell - otherwise you have to do it with source filters, and thats not the aim here - I'm looking for OO done right, not stuck on with sticky tape). So we already have my and our variables (lexicals and package vars) but we also need instance variables.<br/><br/>So tying these two together - the problem with lexical vars is they become closures, and I don't want one copy of the variable being tied into the sub - I want each invocation of that sub to get the right instance variable when it is called. The problem with package variables is similar - you get one instance of them. To do this right it needs to plug deep into the perl internals, and probably gets pretty scary. Hence the desire for a new type of variable.<br/><br/>Anyway... signing off for now. Lots to think about.</p>

<h2>Don't wait for Perl 6</h2>

 <p> <i>Yes I know I should wait for Perl 6, blah blah blah, but I have reasons for doing this so don't try and persuade me not to</i> </p>  <p> Why should you wait for Perl 6?  Perl 5 is a perfectly viable platform for such experiments.  I expect Perl 6 to arrive eventually and be worth moving to, but many people are still skeptical.  Skeptical or not, the Perl 6 development effort ignited some spectacular development fireworks in the world of Perl 5, and we're all reaping the benefits.  If you have ideas, don't let anyone dissuade you. </p>

I've ranted a few times on <a href="http://www.perlmonks.org/" title="perlmonks.org">Perlmonks</a perlmonks.org> when people get "closure" and "anon sub" mixed up. <p> A closure is any subroutine that needs to grab its environment because it's going out of scope, and may or may not be named. </p><p> An anonymous subroutine is a coderef, and may or may not be a closure. </p><p> I've got code to demonstrate all four types of subroutines (named vs anonymous, closure vs not) at Monks somewhere.</p>

Yes, but contrary to what #london may be claiming, both of Matts samples represent closures.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)  Just check against Damians definition!

Right.  The examples at the top of this thread are named subroutines that are closures.  Similar to this:
<code>
BEGIN {
  my @DoW = qw(Sun Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat);
  sub DoW {
    my $n = shift;
    die unless $n == int($n) and $n &gt;= 0 and $n
That's definitely a closure and yet it's a named subroutine.</code>
