<div class="span8">
<p>Yesterday was my first day back at work after moving house. We moved from our rented bungalow to a house we bought about a mile down the road (still in Kitchener, Ontario).<br/><br/>I'm exhausted from it all. To start it all off, on Friday the 26th we went on a 4.5 hour canoe down the Grand River for our wedding anniversary (11 years!). That was fun and memorable and very tiring. Then two days of packing before getting the keys on Monday afternoon and starting to move things over and prepare my office for painting.<br/><br/>On Tuesday we painted my office and moved some more bits and pieces.<br/><br/>Wednesday was moving day. The movers arrived not knowing we had a piano and a large screen TV. Ah well it all turned out OK, and we managed to move shaving off an hour and a half from the salesman's estimate (I attribute that to how much stuff we moved ourselves, and how organised all the boxes were).<br/><br/>Thursday and Friday I chopped down ten 20ft high cedars from the back yard - they were obviously put up for privacy but cedars on the far side of the yard have grown tall enough to give full privacy to the entire yard, so they were superfluous. Chopping them down was easy - chopping them up was a bitch of a job. All those small branches meant using the secateurs a lot resulting in very sore hands.<br/><br/>Saturday I finished chopping up the cedars and did some errands and other bits around the house.<br/><br/>Sunday I unpacked my office (mostly).<br/><br/>On Monday I rested. During all the time I was doing the cedars Heather had unpacked the entire rest of the house. Amazing work.<br/><br/>This week the tilers are in - ripping up the old (plain boring white) tiles that are in the foyer and tiling throughout the foyer, kitchen, dinette, bathroom and utility room. When they pulled out the dishwasher they found a mouse nest and hundreds of mouse droppings, so we'll take the opportunity to get a new dishwasher (this one is 17 years old and rusty).<br/><br/>And this weekend my mum arrives for a 2 week visit. So we have a lot of cleaning up to do after the tilers leave.<br/><br/>I'll be back in action in October I think :-)</p>

<h2>back in action</h2>

...Depends on how you define 'action'.  I'd say you've quite <em>been</em> in action, you and Heather both.
<p>
I like the word "secateurs".  I'm going to start using it instead of "pruning shears", and if it isn't a Canadian word, I'm going to make it one.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>



<h2>congratulations...</h2>

on the 11-year anniversary!
