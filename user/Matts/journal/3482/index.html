<p>DBD::SQLite 0.11 is now on CPAN. This upgrades to SQLite 2.4.0, adding views and a few other niceties. I also had to fix the transaction model because running under mod_perl with Apache::DBI it continuously locked up solid. This was because under AutoCommit=0, I would immediately do a "BEGIN TRAN", which locked the database, and even when I issued a commit, it would do "COMMIT TRAN" followed by another "BEGIN" immediately. So now it only does "BEGIN TRAN" when you actually execte some SQL, and just flags whether I'm in a transaction or not. I believe this is how DBD::Sybase does it too.<br/><br/>I also found a couple of bugs in the core SQLite library, which I mailed the author about and he said he'd fix them in the next release (they're nothing major - just cause compiler warnings).</p>

<h2>This has me wondering...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/djberg96/">djberg96</a> on 2002-03-13T16:33:48</h3>
I wonder what the performance is on huge (over 1 GB) unindexed tables, say using a basic 'select'.
<p>
I also wonder if there are any free vector/text based solutions out there (besides csv/dbm).
</p><p>
Thanks for the info.  I *do* take interest in these posts, in case our Oracle server is taken from us.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:(</p>

Damn.  I was hoping you already had something set up.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
<p>
If I get a chance, I'll give it a shot in the next couple of weeks.
</p><p>
Oh, and in case anyone wants a rough comparison of an RDMS versus a commercial text-based solution (in our case, it was BRS by Dataware Technologies), we had eight databases joined, at roughly 4 GB per database, and I could get about 100,000 results in less than a second.  With Oracle, I hit my IO limits on a single unindexed 1GB table before I get results.
</p><p>
And you only <b>think</b> I'm exaggerating.</p>

<h2>PPM?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/lachoy/">lachoy</a> on 2002-03-14T00:28:41</h3>
Want me to make a PPM available for this? (I have a few already at the <a href="http://openinteract.sourceforge.net/" title="sourceforge.net">OI SF site</a sourceforge.net>.) I just built DBD::SQLite on NT 4.0 with VC++ and all tests passed, superfine. I'm getting ready to run the SPOPS tests using it as well, but I'm sure they'll be ok too.

Most of my other modules are on Randy Kobe's archive. It would probably be best to coordinate with him, I think...

No problem, will do. I'll let you know when I get something usable.

OK, Randy now has it in his archive.

Cool. I emailed Randy and it seems like we might setup a mirror between the sites, so he can have whatever gets put up on mine and vice versa.
