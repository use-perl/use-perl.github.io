<p>Busy day. Teleconference at 7am today. Unfortunately all the actions out of that were mine (build a plugin to detect empty emails according to certain criteria and log in our RADAR system). To be completed today. Bah.<br/><br/>Instead I set about to do everything BUT the one thing I had to do.<br/><br/>Cleaned up messagelabs.com being listed on rfc-ignorant (someone thought our postcode was wrong on our whois record - how lame is that? Seems like a spite listing to me)<br/><br/>Fixed some bugs on our dns builder.<br/><br/>Improved connection throughput in qpsmtpd running on our spamtrap.<br/><br/>Wrote a webpage about why I block emails with foreign characters in.<br/><br/>Made our spam signatures 5 times faster (at the expense of more RAM).<br/><br/>After all that I was rather tired and didn't want to do the thing I was supposed to do. But I decided to just push on and get it done.<br/><br/>So I finished that too. I'm rather tired now, need to go lie down :-)<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>In other news, at the weekend we went to the St Jacobs' Farmer's Market - a fantastic market with all sorts of fresh fruit, meat and veg. We managed to find a butcher who had lamb necks! They were completely unfilleted, so I had to do that myself, but the price was certainly right - we arrived at just before 4pm so he wanted to get rid of them - we paid $25 for 5 full necks (that'd cost me at least 20 quid in the UK).<br/><br/>Made Jamie Oliver's North African Lamb with Couscous last night for the In-Laws. We forgot to buy chillis, so it was rather mild to say the least, but still delicious. Filleting lamb necks is hard work though - must try and find a butcher who'll do it for me.</p>

<p>What's your definition of "foreign characters"?</p>

I block anything where the Subject or From header is encoded in gb2312 or windows-874 or ISO-2022-JP. I simply can't read those emails.<br> <br>I also block emails where the From/Subject contains high 8bit characters that aren't encoded according to RFC 2047. I know this isn't a requirement of email, but I've had to add it to my list of draconian measures to keep my spam load down.
