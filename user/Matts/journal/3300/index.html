<p>I want to setup a couple of web sites. I've been thinking about this for a while now, and I think it's time has come (probably long past).<br/><br/>The sites will be www.twatsinsaxos.com and www.twatsinclios.com, and be dedicated to those shaved head wannabes who mod and tune their tiny wee cars to look like serious twatmobiles, and put massive great big stereos in them so they can scare the pidgeons.<br/><br/>I'm sure they'd all appreciate a site like that for them to show off their twatness.<br/><br/>At the bottom of every page in bold will be the text: <b>"It's still a (clio|saxo), moron!"</b></p>

You'll be pleased to know that <i>shaved head wannabe's</i> are alive and kicking on this side of the pond too.  Over here they like to use Honda Civic's.  So, I'd like to add <i>twatsincivics.com</i> to your list<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br> <br>I'm not sure what a <i>Saxo</i> is though as they didn't make those the last time I lived in England ('95), if they're anything like the Renault Clio then I know <b>exactly</b> what you mean<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

Never! I've owned 4 Honda Civics. The Civic is probably without a doubt the finest car in the world, in my not so humble opinion<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)

You should check out the <a href="http://www.riceboypage.com/" title="riceboypage.com">Riece-Boy pages</a riceboypage.com>.

Haha, the <a href="http://www.riceboypage.com/adventures/" title="riceboypage.com">Adventures of Rice-Boy</a riceboypage.com> is very funny.<br> <br>Sad that people would do that to a poor civic. I mean the very <em>name</em> should prevent those attrocities!

<h2>The Riceboys thing</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/dramoth/">dramoth</a> on 2002-03-05T13:43:15</h3>
I was just about to mention that when I noticed that someone else had mentioned it.
<p>
Back home in Australia, there are a lot of these asian guys buying stock asian cars and putting lots of go fast gear on them and these huge stereos in them... when you know that as soon as they pump up the volume, the car is going to start bouncing along the road.
</p><p>
At least if you are going to do shite like that... get a car with some decent street cred... not a 'hyundai' or a 'daewoo' or a 'honda civic' (no offense Matt, but these are a prime target for the riceboy syndrome back home)... get a celica or a supra or a lancer... something with grunt and good lines...</p>



<h2>Ummm...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/djberg96/">djberg96</a> on 2002-03-05T14:06:16</h3>
You do realize that "twat" is slang for "pussy" here in the U.S., right?

Perfect.

Why do I have this awful feeling I've missed a joke that everyone else is laughing at but me?
<p>
You can all sod off!</p>

<h3><a href="/user/Matts/">Matts</a> on 2002-03-05T14:52:46</h3>
Oh no, I just love to hear of US slang that's completely different in the UK. Things like fanny, fag and twat just make me laugh. A lot.
