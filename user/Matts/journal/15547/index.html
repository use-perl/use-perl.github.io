<p>Yesterday or last night we were burgled. I'm not entirely sure when it was, because they only went into the shed (stole our Lawnmower and a can of petrol). They left the side gate open, which is how we knew something had happened - because the dogs were in the front yard this morning.<br/><br/>I feel amazingly calm about it. Mostly because the lawnmower was 4 and a half years old, and was always too big for our current garden anyway (we bought it for our house in Scotland which had a much larger space to mow). And I really hope they use the petrol in a car or motorbike, because it's stoked full of two-stroke oil for the winter, so they'll get a really crap run from it in a car.<br/><br/>I do feel a little bit dumb about it . We bought new side gates months ago but I just never got around to putting them up. I guess now I have a really good reason to do it :-/<br/><br/>We think it may be related to a guy who came around to "check us out" a few weeks ago. He was posing as a gas meter reading man. Wanted to come through the house to get to the meter, but my wife insisted he go around the side. Two weeks later the guy from British Gas came around, and was surprised about our earlier visitor, and so we put two and two together.<br/><br/>I'm fairly sure this would have happened yesterday during the day. With the dogs in the kitchen (kept in by a dog gate) all they would have done is bark a lot. Nobody would have really noticed much. If it was last night I'd be surprised the dogs wouldn't have awoken by the noise.<br/><br/>Makes me want to leave this place even more.</p>

<h2>Sorry to hear that</h2>

Matt,
<p>Really sorry to hear about this - recently someone tried to force our front door and even something as relatively 'minor' as that gives you the creeps.
</p><p>May your villain lose his big toe in a bloody lawnmower accident...</p>



<h2>Also sorry to hear about your misfortune</h2>

When I was a teenager, my home was broken into three times, once while my mother was sleeping.  It's a very unpleasant experience.



<h2>Sorry to hear about this...</h2>

I hope they do use that gas in a really expensive car!



<h2>I think you're right</h2>

sounds like the "gas man" was the would-be burglar, alright.  Don't they carry cards?  Worth checking them in future, seeing as that seems to be an M.O. being used, then.<br> <br>BTW my apt was broken into about 7 years ago, *while I was asleep*.   I dreamed that someone was breaking down the door, and lo and behold, I woke up when they successfully broke it down and the door slammed open -- someone really *was* breaking down the door!<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)<br> <br>Luckily, some shouting (from the bedroom) scared them off.  Just as well for me, as they'd brought a 3-foot long, inch-thick solid iron fencepost along to break the door down, and that could have easily been used to break my head down if they felt that way inclined.<br>



<h2>So Was I</h2>

Someone broke into my truck last night, stole a whole bunch of stuff (backpack, cd player, DC power adaptor, electric razor).  They got stuff out of a couple other cars and a garage down the street.  Luckily, they got scared off and left most of the stuff.  I'm still missing the backpack and cd player.<br> <br>My feelings were/are also calm, something about everything is replaceable, at least no one got hurt.  However, plans for the nightvision web cam are now coming along nicely.



<h2>Burglary</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/pudge/">pudge</a> on 2003-11-11T16:16:01</h3>
Someone broke into my previous home, after we had moved out.  They stole an interior door, and broke a window.  I felt even that was a violation, and the house was ENTIRELY EMPTY.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)
