<p>You only have to look at the Jimmy Carter presidency to find one that is worse.</p>

We still haven't had anything worse than the Alien &amp; Sedition acts, and that was only President #2.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... but we're getting pretty close.

True...I was parsing backwards though. There are probably a couple of more that were pretty bad as well.

But then are they worse, relatively to the standards of their time period?

That is a point many tend to overlook....

Well, the first thing Jefferson did when he took office was to pardon anyone convicted under the Alien &amp; Sedition acts, then got those overturned. I'd say they violated the then-current expectations.

Of course, Jefferson was probably the worst vice-president ever, since he spent most of his time undermining Adams.

<em>Well, the first thing Jefferson did when he took office was to pardon anyone convicted under the Alien &amp; Sedition acts, then got those overturned. I'd say they violated the then-current expectations.</em><br><br>No one was ever convicted under the Alien Act.<br><br>People really should separate those two things.  They are entirely different.  The Alien Act was a concession by Adams to something he disagreed with, in order to preserve his waning relationship with his party; but as it gave him sole authority to act under it, he figured, what's the harm, since he would simply never use it?<br><br>The Sedition Act was a similar concession, except he did not have the authority under it, and frankly, it was probably only signed because Abigail Adams convinced him to do it.  He was leaning the other way.  It's the one thing she ever did that I can recall that I think was entirely wrong about.<br><br>Anyway, I think Jefferson was a terrible President.  But not as bad as Carter.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br>
