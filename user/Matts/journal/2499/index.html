<p>It really is a testament to CPAN how much I rely on their service day in and day out. So when it comes to something like the last couple of days where CPAN is broken, it really shows up quite quickly for me.<br/><br/>But I'm not pissed, not at all - you know why? Because up until now CPAN has been available almost around the clock, without grumble or hickup. So this once in a blue moon occurance simply reminds me of how much I owe the CPAN administrators.<br/><br/>So I'm going to have a cup of tea and raise a mug to Andreas and Elaine and Jarkko and their team, and instead of downloading software I'm going to write some instead :-)<br/><br/>Anyway, I have faith that all will be OK tomorrow - www.cpan.org seems to have fixed files on it (including my local CHECKSUMS file which seesm to have broken), so it's just my local mirror that's borked right now, and I expect that'll be fixed during the next rsync.</p>

<h2>don't get all gushy now :)</h2>

<p>You should be able to resume the regularly scheduled grumbling any time now. I haven't heard exactly what the problem is but current information I have indicates that PAUSE is currently experiencing some technical difficulties relating to the gzipped index files in<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/modules<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...so hopefully this will cleared up soon.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>



<h2>I had the same problem</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jdavidb/">jdavidb</a> on 2002-01-31T19:23:23</h3>
<p>but I just picked another mirror and everything was okay.  Didn't think about it again until today, when I realized that I'm still using my original mirror and everything is okay.</p>
