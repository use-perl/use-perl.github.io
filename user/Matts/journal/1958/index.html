<p>Oh dear. Seems like my advice to Terrence Brannon about not calling his module "DBIx" fell on deaf ears. And he also seems to have credited me with the code, whereas it was actually autarch that wrote those DBI utility functions that I include in DBIx::AnyDBD's example files. Gah. Writing a DBI abstraction layer seems to be the next right of passage after writing a template processor (both of which I've done).<br/><br/>I wonder if "XML Parser" will be the next thing everyone and her mate will want to write...</p>

<h2>Heh</h2>

We wrote our DBI abstraction layer BEFORE writing our templating code (well, to be fair, we mostly just use Template, with a few additions).  But concerning our DBI layer, at least we had the good sense to not release it as a separate generalized module for others to use.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)



<h2>Hey, I remember that code</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/autarch/">autarch</a> on 2002-01-07T17:29:38</h3>
That code's been in a lot of places!
<br>
<br>First, I wrote something like it for my first programming job.
<br>
<br>Then, I rewrote some of it for the bottom level of Alzabo (the Alzabo::Driver class).  But when we were working on WebBoard UX (fuck you, Chatspace!) I took some of it and used it there.
<br>
<br>I didn't realize you had included it with DBIx::AnyDBD but that's cool.  And now for some insane reason Terrence thought a DBIx module was needed (Terrence, put down the crack pipe.  Its bad for you) and used it once again.
<br>
<br>I am so famous.
<br>
<br>In all seriousness, I'd appreciate a note in the DBIx::AnyDBD sample code along the lines of "some of this code was written by David Rolsky" or something like that.

Done. But I can't say when I'll be releasing an update<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)
