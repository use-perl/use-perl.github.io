<div class="span8">
<p>Today I had another look at POD parsing - there are a few small bugs in Pod::SAX's parsing of L&lt;> items that are inherited from Pod::Parser. For example it won't correctly parse <code>L&lt;&lt; A link with a file reference: F&lt;foo/bar> >></code> because it treats the "/" as a L&lt;> separator, then barfs because it sees the F&lt; part and tries to treat it as a File reference, but can't find the end of it because the L&lt;> parser swallowed it. All too horrible (and confusing to describe - so I don't expect readers to grok it any more than I do!). Basically what needs to be done is treat the text inside the L&lt;> as the post-processed text equivalent after stripping all sequences inside. Unfortunately my parser doesn't provide me access to all that, and I'm not sure I'm up to the job of re-writing all the internals.<br/><br/>In short, I think it might be time to port Pod::SAX to using Pod::Simple instead of Pod::Parser. Though only because that might be the lesser of the two evils ;-)<br/><br/>"time" of course is relative. I don't exactly <em>need</em> that feature, and I'm sure there are very few users of Pod::SAX (aside from those who might use the AxKit Wiki) so it's very much non-urgent. Maybe I'll file myself a bug report in RT ;-)</p>

<h2>Pod::Simple::SAX?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/TorgoX/">TorgoX</a> on 2003-01-03T00:49:05</h3>
I'd love if you did a SAX interface to Pod::Simple !  You'll probably notice that the basic Pod::Simple interface is already pretty SAX-like, so I just needed someone to come by and put a proper SAX wrapper around it.  I think SAX is great, but I'm not <em>totally</em> familiar with every last detail of it, so I shyed away from being the one to actually do up the Pod::Simple::SAX, since I didn't want to make a mess of it.
<p>Feel free to email me any questions you might have about some of the less well-documented parts of Pod::Simple::*.
</p><p>I really meant to have all of Pod::Simple::* prettied up by now, but moving house across two timezones this past month caught me by surprise!</p>

I think ultimately that'll be the best approach. All I lack now is time to JFDI<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)<br> <br>Especially with my xmas hols almost over<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-(
