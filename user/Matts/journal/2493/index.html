<p>Last night I was getting ready to go to bed, and trying to kick off a network install of the shiny new Mandrake 8.2 beta, which looks luverly from the descriptions. Finally I can get Debian off my damn laptop. The laptop was sat on my desk, next to my monitor and below my double book shelves - two large mahogany shelves attached to the wall with all my tech books on - in all about 40 books.<br/><br/>I was running through the slow annoying bits of the install - choosing packages and so on, when I started to hear this strange noise, like our cats playing with something, but it sounded like it was coming from the other side of the wall in my office. Now on the other side of that wall is the stairwell, so it wasn't too likely there were cats there. So I was confused. The noise continued for about 10 seconds, not really much time to think a lot. Then when the 10 seconds were up, there was an almighty crack, and the entire bookshelves came crashing down, crushing my laptop, breaking the ornaments sitting on the edge (a dragon and wizard that my wife made when she was a child), and basically scaring the crap out of me.<br/><br/>So now I have four massive great big holes in the wall. I have to patch, paint, and re-hang the shelves. This time with LARGER screws!<br/><br/>Too many heavy tech books I guess. :-(<br/><br/>Oh, the laptop ironically is fine. Screen seemed crushed and twisted, but the darn thing is just fine. Shame really, I hate that laptop ;-)</p>
