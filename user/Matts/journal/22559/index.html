<p>T-minus one day.<br/><br/>The movers arrived at 8:30 this morning (we were expecting them at 11am) to finish packing, and to start loading the container (due to arrive at 1pm). Everything went a bit mad for a while as we tried to figure out what should and shouldn't be packed, and coordinate everything. Meanwhile Heather is sick as a dog with "DNV" (diarrhoea 'n' vomiting) and worried she can't fly, which is a rather major disaster. Managed to pick up the transit van without too much trouble - I'll drive it to the airport and my friend Jon will drive it back.<br/><br/>Right now everything is packed and we're awaiting the container. The movers think it might be an overload. Meaning some stuff has to go as a part load. :-(<br/><br/>Oh, and I managed to get the cars sorted - our two vehicles are being picked up by British Car Auctions on Thursday and they'll send us a cheque when the sale is complete.<br/><br/>And in a final flash of genius I decided that since we haven't sold the house yet, the server and DSL line can stay until we do, thus neatly solving the sergeant.org/axkit.org issue for a bit longer. PHEW!</p>

...does that mean you won't ever see it back? Do you even care?

No, since I'm staying at MessageLabs I'll be back periodically, and I'll just get them to ship it to me whenever it comes to the time.<br> <br>Plus I have to return to finalise the sale of our house, whenever that occurs.<br> <br>My only worry is if it goes tits up while I'm away, there's nothing I can do to fix it.
