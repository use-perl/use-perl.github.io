<p>No, I'm not leaving use.perl, but it seems there are quite a few people who have done. The only thing I want to say about this is don't expect me to read your journal if you leave.<br/><br/>Now the flip side of this is what is doing these journals all about? Mostly it's a purging - people like to pour their hearts out. Or talk about some geeky development thing they're doing. It's not necessarily about people reading what you've written. In fact on issue for me is a record of things I've accomplished over the year.<br/><br/>But <i>the</i> big part of it for me (and why I come back here every day) is the feedback/replies. If you leave, you lose that. At least from me. I don't expect I'm important enough to anyone that this may bother you, but I may not be the only person who won't read your ramblings any more.</p>

<h2>because I can't be bothered to read every blog</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/TeeJay/">TeeJay</a> on 2002-07-11T10:01:53</h3>
Why people feel the need to move to a different blog and stop posting to use.perl.org journals I don't know. I barely have time to post a journal on here occasionally, if I was serious about blogging then I'd automate the process so that each journal submission would go to each of my blogs.<br> <br>On the same note, if I have to surf half a dozen blogs to read your journal I won't bother.<br>



<h2>You're not alone</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/pdcawley/">pdcawley</a> on 2002-07-11T10:46:55</h3>
Definitely not alone. I like the community here; and the 'one stop shop' nature of it. Life's too short to go checking 10 different sites every day for other journals.



<h2>All I can say to that is....</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jouke/">jouke</a> on 2002-07-11T10:53:10</h3>
Amen<br>



<h2>Yet another &quot;me too&quot;</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/robin/">robin</a> on 2002-07-11T10:54:16</h3>
I read most of the journals on use.perl, checking at least two or three times a week. When people have left, I've looked at their new blog sites once or twice and then forgotten about them.<p>
I'm sure that the loss of me as a reader doesn't matter to any of the journal authors. But I'm sad to be losing interesting writers.</p>



<h2>Outer blogs</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/rafael/">rafael</a> on 2002-07-11T11:12:07</h3>
I don't read other blogs, except, sometimes, <a href="http://www.axis-of-aevil.net/" title="axis-of-aevil.net">Axis of AEvil</a axis-of-aevil.net> and <a href="http://www.askbjoernhansen.com/" title="askbjoernhansen.com">Ask Bjoern Hansen</a askbjoernhansen.com>. No matter how much those blogs are relevant, I can see that there aren't much comments on them (well, in fact Elaine's blog doesn't allow comments). I think the overall fanciness of these prevents readers to leave comments ; whereas a user journal on use.perl, as it presents itself as part of a community, is probably more appealing to feedback.



<h2>Not Leaving - Diversifying</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/davorg/">davorg</a> on 2002-07-11T11:23:31</h3>
<p>Obviously I can't speak for everyone who has non-use.perl blogs, but I can explain why I've set mine up.</p>
<p>I'm not leaving use.perl. I'll still be posting a lot of stuff here (or, at least, that's the plan). It's just there is stuff that I'd like people who aren't part of the Perl community to see as well and asking them to come here seems a bit strange to me. Like a party where two different groups of people don't mix.</p>
<p>I'll see how it goes for a while. Maybe I will get a lot less comments. Maybe I'll find that my only friends are those in the Perl community &nbsp;:-/</p>

On my long-term todo list is to hook up <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/user/rael/lang/perl/blosxom/" title="oreillynet.com">Blosxom</a oreillynet.com> with the aggregator Blagg, to allow me to have a single place to post to my use.perl. journal and my O'Reilly Network log.<p>

The ORN blog is supposed to be for work-related things, like conferences and Perl, but because use.perl has such a better interface for posting, I never use ORN.  And all my friends are here.</p><p>

What I want to be able to do is mark a post as for ORN, use.perl, or both.  At that point my laziness will have been maximized.  Of course, it'd take a day of programming to get there, but that's "overhead", right?</p><p>

I read nvp, elaine, ask, and clintp's journals.  I know there's a web site that aggregates every Perl-related RSS feed there is, but I sometimes wonder about setting up a Perl journal-specific <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/meerkat/" title="oreillynet.com">Meerkat</a oreillynet.com>, just to help me manage my journal reading a bit better.</p><p>

As someone who posts fairly rarely to his general blog and even more rarely on use.perl.org, I'm with Dave here. I made a decision last July or so to only post Perl stuff here, and there's not that much I've done since that I think is of interest.<br> <br>Other people evidently feel that the word 'journal' is more important than the word 'perl'. Fair enough.<br> <br>Perhaps what's missing in the wider world of blogs like aevil's, davorg's, ask's, boojum's and my own is the 'Friends' interface and the interconnectedness of the comments interfaces. But the software is getting there for that; I can get <a href="http://www.ician.co.uk/index.rdf/" title="ician.co.uk">rdf</a ician.co.uk> of what's recently been updated on Dave's site and he doesn't have to lift a finger. MT has comments enabled by default. With not much time and effort, you could tie things together again even over sites.<br> <br>I think I've wittered enough for now. But I've got Bad Ideas going now.<br> <br>

<h2>Hear, hear!</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jdavidb/">jdavidb</a> on 2002-07-11T14:06:06</h3>
<p>I'm with you.  I only read something if it's on one of my regularly visited sites (this one's in the top two) or if I see an interesting link to it.  I'm sorry to see some people go, but I don't intend to add individual independent blogs to my list of regularly visited sites.  So the only way to get me to visit another blog will be to write something interesting and have someone think it interesting enough to post a link here or somewhere else in my immediate vision.</p>

<p>Plus, Slash works the way I think.  After I started reading slashdot and this site (a little over a year ago), I started being very disappointed that the rest of the web doesn't allow me to post comments, receive the benefit of mass user moderation, and so on.  Cheap slash knockoffs usually cause frustration as well.</p>

<p>The great thing about this site is we have a cohesive community.  Separate that across twenty sites and you can't tell who's who across sites.  We'll all become schizophrenics. &nbsp;:)</p>

<p>That said, I do believe its appropriate for some to keep multiple blogs if they have multiple interests.  My random life details go here along with Perl and other programming because this is the only blog I have.  I might start, say, a religious blog some day, which I certainly wouldn't keep here.  In that case, Perl and programming would stay here, and I don't know what I'd do with the random life details.</p>

If you want "outsiders" to read then that's when an "outer" blog starts to make a little more sense - at least to me.<br>

Sorry, I do agree with that, I guess I should have considered that. To that end if you do have friends outside of the perl community who would like to read your musings (I don't) then fair enough.<br>

 This seems a flimsy argument to me..<br>If these people are you friends/family whatever<br>presumably they are going out of their way to<br>read a blog as it is. What difference does it<br>make where it is? To them a link is a link.<br>

<h2>Re:Outer Blogs</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/vek/">vek</a> on 2002-07-11T20:16:19</h3>
Well yes but some outer blogs could be part of a more encompassing "page" with photos or other misc pages - not <b>just</b> the blog itself.  Personally I'd like to stay on the same site with the same "look &amp; feel" instead of remembering "Ok I go to use.perl.org for his blog, foo.bar.org for his photos and someotherfoo.org for his other stuff.  Yes technically they're just links but all 3 sites could look different and act differently.  That along with the fact that you are more likely (but not always obviously) to write geeky stuff down in use.perl.org journals and perhaps your other non-geek friends &amp; family really couldn't give a rats arse what version of Mozilla you're currently trying out<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br> <br>But why all the whining &amp; fussing?  If you want your own blog somewhere else - great, go for it.  If you want to just write stuff here - super, terrific.  If you want to write stuff here <b>and</b> your own blog - more power to ya.  Don't take these journals so seriously, jeez.

<h2>And another me too</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/autarch/">autarch</a> on 2002-07-11T17:07:00</h3>
To be perfectly honest, there's no one person who writes journals here on use.perl that is _so_ compelling that I'd actually make a point of reading their own site.<br> <br>However, the fact that there are _lots_ of people who write journals, all in one convenient location, gets me to read quite a number of journal entries.  Some I read because I know them in other contexts, like Matts here, who I worked with for a while.<br> <br>Others I've met in conferences or seen their talks or they just write well enough to make it worth reading.<br> <br>But for me the compelling part of the journals here is the gestalt.  It's great to have the comments and sometimes a thread starts in one journal and someone writes a journal entry in response and so on.<br> <br>All of which is to say that it's the community as a whole that I enjoy rather than any single member's contribution to it.  I do wish Elaine and others would come back, because I enjoyed reading their responses.<br> <br>But there's exactly _one_ blog outside of use.perl I read on a regular basis, and that one is maintained by one of my closest friends.  She's really busy (single motherhood is _incredibly_ difficult) so I don't get to hang out with her all that often so the blog is a good way to catch up, basically &nbsp;;)
