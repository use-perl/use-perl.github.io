<p>Family gatherings are strange events, and in these current times are even stranger than ever.<br/><br/>I have noticed lately that family gatherings have deteriorated into old(er) people staring at strange youths who spend all their time staring into portable communication devices, with varying emotions on their faces as the machines beep and whirr and as they punch buttons on these things.<br/><br/>Nobody seems to talk to the person next to each other any more :-(<br/><br/>Is this the future? Or am I just being a really old fart?</p>

I see what you mean though.  Of course, considering everyone my age in my family happily punches away at their computers for as much time as they can get, and both my brother-in-law and I work in the same field, at the same company, it's pretty understandable.  After all, if you've got IRC, why do you have to meet in person?



<h2>maybe you looked up from your laptop for a change</h2>

I've noticed this in all parts of daily life but, thankfully, most of my family aren't geeks so family gatherings are mercifully gadget-free. It's ironic that these things that people are declaring as 'revolutionizing' communications seem to do the exact opposite with regard to meatspace interactions which don't include the digital solliloquy of email or the navel gazing of blogs. It's the future I suspect unless more people start to notice this trend soon and start to actively resist the downward slide.

<h2>The Other Side Of The Coin...</h2>

My SO is going to the <a href="http://www.bigspringjam.org/" title="bigspringjam.org">Big Spring Jam</a bigspringjam.org> in Alabama, and I am required for attendance.  Despite the fact that I recognize perhaps 7 acts from last year (and I only like 3 of them), I have been forbidden from bringing a laptop or PDA to said event, which was how I was planning to spend my time there.  Each time I ask, "What will <em>I</em> do, though?" she repeats again that there is alcohol for sale there.
<p>
My only option, then, is to drink until the music's over.  I've never been drunk for three days straight before, but I guess there's a first time for everything.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:(</p>
