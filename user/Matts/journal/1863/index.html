<p>There's absolutely nothing better in this world than getting up to a brilliant blue sky and frost on the ground, and taking the dogs out for a walk up the hill behind our house, with the wonderful crispy crunch the ground makes when its this cold. The pale orange sun just trying to shine through the trees, and the moon still shining with a morning haze around it. Fabulous.<br/><br/>Of course after that I wanted to go back to bed. Alas no, I had to go to work. Luckily the christmas period is a slow one for viruses and exploits, so it's been easy enough catching up. There's a couple of new gotchas out there - a gzip bug, an IE GetObjects() bug (no surprise there then), but nothing too serious to worry about.<br/><br/>So it's back to writing my anti spam code. Looks like SpamAssassin got some interesting new code over christmas, which I'll be checking out. And then I need to start integrating the spam db code I've been writing with my spamassassin interface, and update some of my code for the changes people have made here since I wrote it initially a couple of months ago. And then I'll be stopping spam like no tomorrow :-)</p>

There's nothing worse than having to lever oneself out of bed in pitch darkness and be dragged slipping and sliding down the icy pavement (sidewalk) by the dogs as we make our way to the village green. The only orange glow comes from the sodium vapour street lights!
