<p>Our boiler stopped working last night. We had a minor panic, tried to relight it (the pilot light was out), failed, tried a bit more, failed some more. So we considered the fact that it was Saturday night, and that the heating would go off shortly anyway, and went to bed.<br/><br/>Got up to a chilly house (why do our boilers never fail in the summer!), switched on an electric heater (one heater doesn't heat a 4 bed house very well though!) and Heather set about calling plumbers.<br/><br/>We just had the guy around. Sunday callout charge is ÃÂ£75/hour plus VAT. He knew what was wrong within minutes. Replaced the thermocouple (a ÃÂ£8 part), put everything back together and invoiced us for just under ÃÂ£100.<br/><br/>I'm seriously considering re-training to be a plumber! However he did say it was about 10 years training to become a full CORGI registered plumber...</p>
