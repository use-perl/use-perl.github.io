<p>Storing lenses in an air conditioned room will mean they spend about 20 minutes covered in condensation when you take them outside.<br/><br/>Time to start storing my lenses in the cold storage room I think, where the humidity matches the outside much closer.</p>

as I have this problem in reverse...going from -30C outside to +20 inside. Geez, how bloody cold do you keep the AC?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

It's not really the temperature but the humidity... We keep the AC at about 24 I think, plus we have a built-in de-humidifier, but at 30 outside and 80% humidity, the steam just sticks itself to the front glass<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

Ah, I didn't think it got that hot and humid in Kanukia.  Ziploc bags are your friends.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

I don't really understand how that would help... Surely the lens will still be going from inside (cold) to outside (hot and humid) even if I keep it in a ziploc while in storage?

<i>Surely the lens will still be going from inside (cold) to outside (hot and humid) even if I keep it in a ziploc while in storage? </i>

<p>Depends if they're going to be USED in the hot-and-humid, or transported to a 3rd less-humid place, I guess.

</p><p>Taking any optics from any ambient storage to a different ambient usage environment causes issues. My spectacles fog over when stepping from the car to open the driveway gate during a heat wave. Telescopes have to come to <a href="http://www.dewbuster.com/faq/4_performance.htm" title="dewbuster.com">thermal equalibrium</a dewbuster.com> before good seeing is possible.</p>

It keeps the moisture in the air away from the lens or the camera while it adjusts to the outdoor temperature, i.e. when I bring a metal camera like the Leica inside after being used out in -30C for a few hours, I put it inside a large ziploc  to minimize the shock and condensation. Of course, it has few electronic bits to worry about and my concern is the film rather than the camera or the lenses. I've had my face freeze to the bloody thing outside in the winter before.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) Of course, we don't have artic indoor A/C here so I don't have to worry about it in the summer.
