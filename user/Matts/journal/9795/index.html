<p>in Ohio even if it's on Boston Street<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) If you're in Boston then for the spam conf you should drop us a line as we aren't cashing in our one-way tickets until the 23rd.</p>

OK, *now* I feel dumb. Thanks for being my proof reader<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br> <br>I'll check my schedule when I get there, and let you know though. If you're close to MIT maybe we can get together for a beer.

<p>That would be fun as there are a number of nice pubs near MIT and it would be nice to see you before we head off to the ultra-frigid north<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) Jarkko will probably be reading his email more regularly than I will at that point so drop him an email if you are free.</p>

<p>And don't feel dumb about missing the address as the Getty Geographic thesaurus shows 29 Cantons each in a different US state and 25 different Bostons so it's hard to tell where something is without a zipcode for many places in the US. It's a big country and the settlers weren't all that original in their naming schemes<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

The timing may have been a bit coincidental, but I assure you that this has nothing to do with you being in Boston on the 16th.
<p>
The address is for Boston <i>Street</i> in Canton.  Canton is a town in Maryland not too far away from Baltimore.  (The 410 area code is a dead giveaway; 410 is the greater Baltimore area, while 617 would be a more likely area code for Boston/Cambridge.)
</p><p>
But if you are at all interested in stopping in on a talk on Wine and Jewish Culture while you're in Boston, by all means stop by.  It's about a 6-8 hour drive, or a roughly two hour flight.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)</p>
