<p>I was reading "Programming Ruby", A.K.A. the Pick Axe book last night. And it makes me wish that I could use Ruby every day. It's just so damn clean, and it's OO model is just *right*, and its threads are just so *simple*, and ... ok, I'll stop now.<br/><br/>I guess I just wish I could do my job in Ruby, rather than Perl. Actually I probably could - they're pretty flexible about just using what works here. But then the axkit people would get all edgy that I'm going to move away from Perl, and I'd be lynched :-)</p>

<p>I've been moving towards Ruby too. I hear there is strength in numbers. Andy Wardly likes Ruby as well. Hey, garbage collection is nice you know<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

Hey, I like Ruby too.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
<br>
<br>It may well do to perl's user base what Python never did. (Or could, I think)

  This is pretty much all we need<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-) I'd switch right away... It might require porting some stuff from CPAN, and running a little SOAP server to access Perl for a while, but so many things are just done right there that it's very tempting.

Be warned, the previous comment comes from the same guy (or gal?) who tempts people publicly (or at least in IRC) to make a switch to Postgres (from MySQL).  Everytime I see that guy on PM with red eyes, I think of darobin!<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)

I'd venture to make the same suggestion. The slowdown with Pg is probably about 10% now from MySQL, which is negligable, but Pg will also be much faster on complex queries, because frankly it's query optimiser is light years ahead of MySQL's. In fact I'd say it's as good as Oracles (though maybe not as good as Sybase's).

arg - not you, too!  *laugh*  Seriously, I do envy having foreign keys, stored procs, views and triggers, but not at the current expense of rewriting a massive amount of CGI programs.
<p>
Hmm<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... maybe I'll write my new stuff using Pg (I do have a server running in conjunction with MySQL)... that'll be my entry into the dark side.</p>

Oh yes, it's lovely isn't it. I've kind of fought shy of doing anything serious in it, but I'd *love* to see large chunks of the Ruby Way making it into Perl 6.
