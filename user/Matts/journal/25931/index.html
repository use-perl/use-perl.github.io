<p>Last week I was at <a href="http://www.ceas.cc/">CEAS</a> in Palo Alto. It was a good conference. Most of the talks weren't directly applicable to what I do (some were, the majority weren't) but there was some interesting stuff in there. The hallway track was excellent, and I met some people who I only knew online before, which is always nice.<br/><br/>This week it's been back to the grindstone at work, mostly doing documentation (blech). I feel like I need a holiday, but there's so much I need to get done.<br/><br/>I had been complaining to <a href="/user/geoff">Geoff</a> that my camera didn't auto-focus right with my 50mm 1.8 lens, and decided to do some testing this week after I got back from CEAS with a bunch of slightly off-focus pictures. It turned out that my whole camera was off focus by about 20mm, which was quite a shock.<br/><br/>I called Nikon and they said I'd be without my camera for 3-4 weeks. After a post to the <a href="http://www.sergeant.org/view/PhotoGeeks">PhotoGeeks</a> mailing list one of the replies contained a link to someone who had adjusted their camera for backfocus themselves. Tools required: Just a 2mm allen key. So after crapping myself about scratching my sensor I decided this was better than being without my camera (I could always claim it on insurance if I really damaged it - "err, the cat scratched the sensor"). So I managed to get the backfocus issue fixed, which is wonderful news.<br/><br/>We now move in just over 4 weeks. The movers we booked have turned out to be shite. They won't deliver boxes to us - we have to pick them up between 7 and 9 am on Saturday. There goes my weekend lie in. They also won't give us any documentation of the insurance they have. This is making me very nervous, and we're calling other movers tomorrow to see what/who else is available.</p>
