<p>Using OpenOffice 641c here at work. I have to say this is a very <b>very</b> nice <em>open source</em> word processor. I tried really hard to like KWord and AbiWord, but I just couldn't get along with them. They would quite simply get things like bullet points, indenting, formatting, and so on, just plain wrong. And I couldn't cope with it. OpenOffice just gets stuff right. It has that pedigree feeling to it (and so it should - it's quite an old product). I'm very happy with it.</p>

Then you'll know the pain of OpenOffice.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br> <br>I tried using it as a replacement for PowerPoint. No joy. Crashes, eats files (completely), mangles slide drawing, goes wacky in the middle of slideshow presentations.<br> <br>Don't Go There. You won't like it...

<p>Been there. Done that. Had to recreate a 150 page presentation from the original notes in two days. Won't be using Open Office Presenter again for quite some time.</p>

<a href="http://axpoint.axkit.org/" title="axkit.org">I wrote my own</a axkit.org>. No need for a crappy presentation tool ever again. AxPoint simply kicks ass, and since it's just an XML file I edit in vi (or whatever) I know I'm not going to lose data.

Yeah, but there's that whole XML thing. Ick.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:) Plus PDF files are lacking in action, though that's not generally a bad thing. (I'm finding myself wanting it, though, in moderation)<br> <br>I've been using AppleWorks' presentation module of late on my OS X laptop. It's OK, but I'm hitting its limits. I'm probably going to end up springing for PowerPoint, like it or not. <br>

What kind of actions do you need? AxPoint does bullet point transitions, slide transitions, graphics transitions, table transitions etc. Yeah it's not quite sliding in from the left, but it's usually enough for a tech-oriented presentation.

<p> <a href="http://www.cpan.org/authors/id/M/MS/MSERGEANT/" title="cpan.org">Matt Sergeant</a cpan.org> is probably not the right person to say that to. At least if you're looking for agreement.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

It's true. And I agree. XML is ick.<br> <br>It just happens to be the ick with the best tools<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)
