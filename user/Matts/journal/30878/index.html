<p>AxKit2 based webmail is coming along well. I now have the basic framework in place so that the backend maintains as many IMAP connections open as it needs, and will query the backend IMAP server in an entirely non-blocking manner (so other requests can proceed in parallel). I've got a basic IMAP webmail viewer working (shows folders, folder contents, and displays the email), and all works nicely with AJAX goodness (so the main page loads, then the folders load asynchronously, etc).<br/><br/>It's ugly as hell right now, but one of the Dahuts is helping me with that, so hopefully in the next couple of days we'll have a really nice (read-only) IMAP webmail setup. Then I'll work on mail sending, which should be fairly straightforward.<br/><br/>Do people still want/need a better webmail than Squirrel?</p>

<h2>Dethroning the Squirrel King</h2>

<blockquote> <div><i>Do people still want/need a better webmail than Squirrel?</i></div> </blockquote>

<p>I'm using SquirrelMail for my personal server, and I must say that it's a software that's hard to beat. It's not the most glamorous mail client there is, but it does its job, and it does it very well: it's a breeze to install, and it has all the right features to please all the spectrum of my users, from the powerusers to my techneophyte mother-in-law. Not to mention that it has a substantial amount of plugins to play with too.</p>

<p>But it also has a terrible flaw: it's written in PHP.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-) So do we need something better than Squirrel? Perhaps not. Do we want it? Hell yeah!<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>

I've been working on and off on a perl based webmail, also using N::I::Simple.  I'm interested in those non-blocking changes you made.<br><br>I have lots of ineresting interface elements I've wanted to add, or have added as well.  Perhaps we could chat sometime and see if they fit.  I'm on MagNet always.<br><br>The squirrelmail people did a good job, but they weren't desiging for end-users in the beginning and the refactoring is suffering as a result, imo.
