<p>Last night my wife and I watched "Thelma and Louise" - a movie Heather bought off e-bay.<br/><br/>Oh. My. God.<br/><br/>I never thought in my youth "What a dumb fuckwit Thelma is".<br/><br/>We decided in the end it should have been called: <em>"Louise And Her Stupid Friend"</em>.</p>

Nothing drives me batshit now more than reading books or movies in which the plot is driven by stupid behaviour whose only reason is to drive the plot.  Kim in "24" is currently redlining my silly cow-ometer in that respect.<p>

Kim's sole function in 24 (this season and last) is to provide a distracting yet somewhat violent plot line to fill out ~24 hours of writing.  That, and insure that there are some characters who aren't middle aged in the script.
<p>
I wish Kevin Smith would do one of these Alias/24 type action dramas.  At least when the characters go all silly, you know it's for comic relief.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>

So true!  She's only there for jiggle relief, I'm sure, and her constant whining overwhelms the few jiggles she does provide.  I sure hope she gets shot in this season.  It won't happen, but I can hope.<p><blockquote><div> <i>Alias</i> </div></blockquote>

I watched the ep after the Super Bowl.  I don't get what people see in it, other than a jiggling woman.  Does she get her duds off in every episode, or was it just that one?  Either way, it was incredibly uncompelling--one of those evil organization plots, kinda like "The Pretender", that just don't hold up.  It's barely as frightening as KAOS, let alone SPECTRE.<p>

If your introduction to the series was the post superbowl titilating version of Sydney "What was wrong with the black one?" Bristow, then it probably would seem lame.  We've been watching it since the first commercial free episode of the first season.  When it's good, the writing is fast paced, coherent, self-consistent, and entertaining.  There's some suspension of disbelief, but nothing like Austin Powers/007.  When it's bad, it feels like a good week on ST:TNG.

Just that one, really.  Most of the time, there are a lot of costume and makeup changes, and the outfits usually have enough fabric to remind you that this is a Disney-owned channel.  Mostly, it's the same kind of allure as Xena, Buffy or any of the modern "let's watch some girls kick everyone else's ass" type show.

The real evil dude is Arvin Sloane, her ex-boss at SD-6.  The way they pulled a deus ex machina out of their hat to kill the central theme of the series (destroying Sloane, SD-6 and the Alliance) did suck a little much.
<p>
But if they didn't almost kill the series mid-season, it wouldn't be the second annual shark-jumping episode.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-S</p>
