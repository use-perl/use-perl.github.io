<p>Apparently my iBook is on its way back. I never got a call from the engineer, despite stuffing a fiver and a note [*] saying to call me in the battery compartment (at <a href="/user/pdcawley">pdcawley's</a> suggestion, so I blame him ;-)<br/><br/>Let's hope its all fixed.<br/><br/>[*] I even put the note on the back of a particularly funny dilbert cartoon. You just can't trust repair technicians these days!</p>

<p>And Pudge has had no end of troubles with his Powerbook - http://use.perl.org/user/pudge/journal/9937</p>
<p>Are Apple notebooks less reliable than say IBM/Dell ones or is this just par for the notebook course?</p>

I'm not sure. I think it's two different issues though - pudge had problems with Apple support (US) being crap at repairing his powerbook, whereas I had a pretty good experience (except for the issue with the fiver) - they repaired my ibook and sent it back in 3 working days total (sent on day 1, repaired on day 2, sent back on day 3), which is pretty amazing.<br> <br>On the other hand this is the second time I've had to send my ibook back, which doesn't make me too happy with their reliability. And I've read on the 'net quite a few other people had the faulty backlight problem I had (though none with the same problem as this time).<br> <br>And you also have to remember I'm a really heavy user of this ibook - I open and close the screen about 10 times every single day (including weekends). That's a lot of use.<br> <br>Having said that I have a VAIO that I've never had go wrong... but it's battery lasts 40 minutes. If the VAIO had to go into repair I wouldn't miss it as much as the iBook, so you make your choices I guess.

I have always had good experiences with Apple repair, until recently.<br> <br>Yesterday I sent my PowerBook to Apple for good.  A replacement, new computer, should be on the way by next week.  While I would not have intentionally traded over a month of time without my computer for a new one, it is good that after all this, I am getting a new one.
