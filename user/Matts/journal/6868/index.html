<p>In XML::LibXML and XML::LibXSLT we share memory allocation code by simply copying the perl-mm.c files between the two projects (yes this is naive, but it works). This works fine on all OSes except Mac OSX, apparently, where it complains about multiple definitions.<br/><br/>So I tried making the memory allocation code external (this'll work no problem I thought to myself!). But it doesn't like that either because it can't find the code now. Gah!<br/><br/>So has anyone got any idea how I might fix this?</p>

For the Mac:: stuff, I defined the same function names and variables in multiple shared libraries, and dyld complained mightily.  I put the functions in a single XS file, and access them from the others.  So, for example, Foo.xs defines Foo(), and Bar.xs calls Foo() freely, and I put use Foo; at the top of Bar.pm, Baz.pm, etc.  And, of course, Bar.xs has to include "../Foo/Foo.h" to get the definition<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...<br> <br>Does that sound like what you were running into?  And does my approach seem Wrong?  I don't do a lot of C or XS<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... I just look for something that works, and this seems to.<br>

That sounds like it might work. I'll give it a try.

Not really wrong, however if you are porting alot of code that might not be possible, a good trick then is to disable -flat-namespace

Ahhh.  Hm.  But I wonder if I can even compile the rest of it without -flat-namespace, as my code is relying on Carbon's flat headers.  Bah.

I bounced off this the other day, I eventually realised I could use the linker against itself and deleted the<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.c file from the XML::LibXSLT tree. <p> The symbol leaks over when LibXSLT.pm uses LibXML and it just magically works out.</p>

That totally doesn't work for me - I get:<br> <br>dyld:<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/usr/bin/perl Undefined symbols:<br>_PmmSvNode<br> <br>Which is one of the functions.<br> <br>(and yes, XML::LibXML is loaded before XML::LibXSLT is bootstrapped).

Hmm,  I guess this is probably that I'm building against a locally-built 5.8.0 rather than the supplied 5.6.0. <p> Looking at the output of perl -V for both perls their linker flags do differ, which could explain it: </p><p><nobr> <wbr></nobr>/usr/bin/perl (5.6.0) <br> Linker and Libraries:
    ld='cc', ldflags ='' </p><p> perl5.8.0 <br>  </p><blockquote><div> <tt> Linker and Libraries: <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; ld='cc', ldflags =' -flat_namespace'</tt> </div></blockquote>  <p> The Dynamic Linking linker options <code>lddlflagsall</code> are the same for both perls, so I suspect it's the differing <code>ldflags</code> that are letting it work for me.</p>

doh, hit save rather than preview.  I mean lddlflags not lddlflagsall
