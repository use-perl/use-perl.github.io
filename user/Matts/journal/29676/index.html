<p>I've just got back from a crazy busy week in the UK. On Wednesday I found out that the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/21/business/yourmoney/21spam.html?_r=1&oref=slogin">NY Times article</a> that we did the interview for a few weeks ago suddenly got pushed up to publication the following weekend. That meant Thursday a photographer was coming up from London to get some pictures. My colleague Nick who was also a feature of the article wasn't going to be in that day and he was gutted he missed out on getting his picture in the paper. On Wednesday night I had to wait up for Heather arriving in the UK - we finally got to sleep after her not-fun journey at about 2am. So of course bags under my eyes I had to dress smart and appear presentable.<br/><br/>All that said I think the pics came out well, and the article was very good. It was cool having Heather read the article as she usually has no idea what I do at work, and she now knows a lot about the kind of thing we deal with day-to-day.<br/><br/>After that, this past weekend was a friend from University's wedding (James Ball, who married Naomi). We had an absolute blast at the wedding, and I'm processing some pictures now and hope to blog some when they're all uploaded and I can pick the best few from the day.</p>
