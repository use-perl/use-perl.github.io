<div class="span8">
<p>Last week I got a letter from the Inland Revenue (UK) telling me I had understated my pay by several thousand pounds and that as a result they were going to claw back over 2000 pounds in taxes.<br/><br/>After speaking to them on the telephone this week it turns out that this is because when I had my contract changed from Star to MessageLabs (basically the same company) my P60 had an entry on it stating "Earnings in this employment (Figures shown here should be used for your tax return if you get one)". So I did - wouldn't you?<br/><br/>The taxman I spoke to said that if he was just a layman he would have done the same. Sadly his sympathy carries no weight in this.<br/><br/>The several thousand pounds in my "previous employment" that I omitted (nothing told me I needed to include them as far as I can remember) - the earnings at Star, made up the now required clawback.<br/><br/>Of course MessageLabs don't want to help me out with this - apparently it's my screwup not theirs. So now just before I have to find the money for a downpayment on a house I now also have to find 2000 pounds to pay to the Inland Revenue. Like most people buying a house there's no leeway in my finances right now.<br/><br/>Several very angry swear words come to mind.</p>

You've done a lot of good work and code that I and others use every day. I'd be happy to donate to the cause if it would help.

No really this is my problem, and I will get through it. It's just really pissing me off.<br> <br>I give code for fun, not to hope for anything back.

Never hurts to offer. Charma is like that.
