<div class="span8">
<p>For some reason I managed to stumble across <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSM7BUmx6hY">The Trouble with Atheism</a> on YouTube, which seems chock full of bad anti-atheism arguments:
<ol>
<li>"If we all became atheists tomorrow, would the world suddenly become a better place?"
<p><p>
Unfortunately religion (or lack of it) can't influence this. Some people are just "bad", and religion can't change that. Why would you assume it could, when your next argument pretty much says it can't?
<li>"The soviet union's atheist regime killed 20 million"<p><p>
Yes they killed many. For political reasons though. Should we be only allowed to say that one type of dogma is bad?
<li>"Atheism is becoming a religion of its own, with its own Gurus (implied: gods) and its own sacred texts (showing The Origin of the Species)"<p><p>
I think it's fair to say that most atheists come to atheism from a perspective of science. And as such, no atheist would argue that TOotS is the one-true-word - we treat it like any scientific paper - as data that has some truths and some misinterpretations, but some very interesting observations that required more study. And there has been MUCH about TOotS that has been proved and disproved over the years.
<li>"Belief in a negative"<p><p>
No, atheism is simply a lack of <i>blind</i> faith. A lack of "just believing" for the sake of it. We tell people all the time it's not natural to believe in things that don't have any basis for belief (the tooth fairy, santa claus, the flying spaghetti monster) yet we blindly accept religion because the book is old.
<li>snide comments about being "Fundamental Atheists"<p><p>
You can't <i>be</i> a fundamental atheist. I'm sure as I can be that 100% of atheists would <i>welcome</i> some proof that there is a god that should be worshiped. And if such proof were presented there would be no more atheism. We're (pardon the pun) fundamentally not fundamentalists. We believe in proof before belief.
<li>Particle accelerators can only show what happened 1 millionth of a second after the "big bang" so therefore choosing god or "no god" is just a matter of preference.<p><p>
I'm sorry, but wasn't the earth created about 6000 years ago according the bible? Religion doesn't even begin to cover the scientific discoveries about the origins of the universe, so I don't see how you can get into a religious argument about it. Did "God" just decide in his infinite wisdom to omit that stuff from the Christian bible, or did the true authors of the bible simply have no concept of how far back the universe went?
</ol>
I could go on. The whole documentary is a bizarre concoction of strawmen. I'm surprised it even got aired.
<p><p>
For anyone wanting to reply to this: only reply today if you agree to comment (good or bad) on one of my photographs tomorrow.</p>

<p>Those are horrible reasonings.</p> <p><div class="quote"> yet we blindly accept religion because the book is old</div>  <p>I do not think that is entirely true though. Certainly faith has to play a part in it but I don't think I would consider what I have as a "blind" faith at all. Maybe that is just me.</p>

<p>I will gladly comment on your pictures. I wasn't sure if I was supposed to do that or not. I really enjoy them though and have a for a while.</p>

The blind part is admittedly subjective. The belief is in your "soul" or your "heart" or in some way invisible to the rest of the world. As such it is without external validation.<br><br>A good counter example would be the sun rising every day. I don't just believe that because it has always happened (though that would be a perfectly valid reason for believing it), but because there is a whole bunch of other information about how things rotate around the sun, how the gravitational field affects those things, how fast things rotate, etc. These things are my proof of why things happen. A belief in a god provides no such thing - just a "because my book says so".

<p>That just takes the cake &#8211; the irony is killing me. The Nazi regime had the Vatican&#8217;s full blessing, y&#8217;know? And what about the inquisition? The crusades?

<p>No, it wasn&#8217;t.</p>

<p>The funny thing about your question is, though, that most &#8220;religious&#8221; people don&#8217;t even know the Bible themselves. Such people don&#8217;t actually believe anything coherent, they just have a pile of ideas they&#8217;d like to be true because they find them comprehensible, convenient, or both.</p>

<p>Mind, this goes both ways &#8211; a lot of antitheists would do well to take a few lessons in epistemology. And my avoidance of the term &#8220;atheist&#8221; is deliberate: it used to mean &#8220;antitheist&#8221;, but nowadays people seem to want communicate a weird intangible &#8220;not really antitheist but more than just agnostic&#8221; notion when they use it &#8211; a classic distinction without a difference if I ever saw one.</p> <p><blockquote> <div><p>only reply today if you agree to comment (good or bad) on one of my photographs tomorrow.</p></div> </blockquote>

<p>I would also say "full blessing" is incorrect as well. Certainly the Roman Catholic church did bad things but I am pretty sure the Pope didn't say "Go kill millions of Jews, it's okay." and even if the Pope did say that I would say <i>ding ding</i> not "christian". I could go on for days about the "Pope" as well. Gah!</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re gonna get into that sort of game, I&#8217;m also going to declare &#8220;political, nothing to do with atheism&#8221; for the Soviet Union claim and then the argument disappears in a puff of smoke. Just as well, really, since that leaves the advocates of faith in a better position than if their argument was valid but wrong.</p>

Nah, don't do that. Most people automatically assume the crusades were "christian" and I would say historically that they were not. I would also go with your point of "political, nothing to do with atheism". Why? Sometimes people want to lump things into politics that just don't belong. Now whatever world view you hold certainly contributes but that doesn't always mean you can label something "christian" or "atheist".<br><br>I have a hard time labeling anything from that period done by the "Pope" as "christian" anyway.

From Wikipedia:<p><div class="quote">The Crusades were a series of military conflicts of a religious character waged by Christians from 1095-1291, usually sanctioned by the Pope in the name of Christendom,[1] with the goal of recapturing Jerusalem and the sacred "Holy Land" from Muslim rule and originally launched in response to a call from the Eastern Orthodox Byzantine Empire for help against the expansion of the Muslim Seljuq dynasty into Anatolia.[2][3]</div> Looks pretty christian to me.

I actually read that and I don't agree with wikipedia.<br><br>The original crusades (Pope Urban II) were defensive measures against almost 4 centuries of Muslim conquest and warfare.<br><br>There is a lot of history in that period. Just because the Roman Catholic church and the "Pope" were involved, doesn't make it "christian".<br><br>It is a very good study in history, politics and yes religion.<br>

Well, it is a mixed bag with the Crusades.  Not as Christian as many atheists want to believe, but not devoid of Christianity either.<br><br>It's similar to the Iraq War: many people think it is a religious war, when it clearly is not, but there are certainly religious motivations and influences behind many of the people involved (on all sides).<br><br>As to fixing Wikipedia<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... jeez, one simple fix can take weeks to defend and then it will still be removed anyway.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

It played politics and tried to stay out of it, and you could call what it did appeasement, which I suppose you could awkwardly turn into a blessing of some kind, but it was not a "full" blessing, certainly.<br><br>That said, as I mentioned to Matts, this argument is offered in response to the notion that Christians are bad (because of the Crusades etc.) and atheists are good.  Dawkins spends pages going on about the Inquisition, and yet never explains the essentially atheist regimes of Hitler, Stalin, and Mao.<br><br>Mentioning these atheist regimes makes no sense on its own, but only in response to the claim that Christians are worse than atheists.  And the point of bringing it up is not to make atheists look worse, but to make EVERYONE look bad.  Yes, as you say, Christians have done terrible things.  They are just as bad as atheists.<br><br>Your notes about the age of the Earth and the meaning of "atheist" I addressed in my other post as well.<br><br>Cheers.<br>

For example -- and I know this does not hold true across the spectrum of nations, it is just an example -- perhaps a "Christian nation" like America allows more freedom than an "atheist nation" like China, and thus has more social problems like murder and abortion.  Does that mean America is worse than China, or that its Christian values (in this case, freedom) have more negative results than those of its atheist counterpart?  Some people in China certainly think so, but I'd disagree, as would most people in the West, who believe in freedom (regardless of their religious views).<br><br>Again, this is just one example.  Another may be that America has gun rights built in to its Constitution and therefore we have more gun violence, but that a. is not necessarily a bad thing (e.g. a few more people die, but tyranny is averted) and b. does not necessarily reflect directly on anything to do with religion (at least, no moreso than any other expression of liberty).<br><br>And how does one even define Christian morals?  Some people claim a government committment to the poor is a Christian value, but I could not disagree more: government charity, while in some cases more effective in curtailing the actual problem of poverty, is a poor substitute for the Christian value of individual charity, and comparing the results and saying whether one stacks up better to "Christian values" is, at best, like comparing apples and oranges.<br><br>Etc.<br>

<p><blockquote><div>The Origin of the Species</div></blockquote>

<p>With my pendantry hat on, that book is actually called "The Origin of Species". It's all a little confusing given that the plural of "species" is "species", but the book is supposed to explain the origin of all species (although it prevaricates slightly on Man and doesn't really make that connection clear - for that you need "The Descent of Man")</p>

<p>I resent even having to refer to myself as an atheist; it's such a stark reminder that the normal state (statistically at least) is to be theist. Why can't the believers be called irrationalists instead?</p>

<p>Because then the atheists would claim rationality. And most self-claiming atheists I met had more of a "There is no god. Period." attitude.</p>

<p>I'd rather have the word spread that knowing and believing are two absolute different pair of shoes. And that goes for both camps, since I personally actually see science as faith or belief. At least with those people that say that a proven theory must be how reality is. But this would become a rather large discussion<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<h3><a href="/user/Aristotle/">Aristotle</a> on 2007-04-11T16:48:11</h3>
<p>Because he said it better than most of us could&#8230; a transcript of Richard Feynman from <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=8777381378502286852" title="google.com">The Pleasure of Finding Things Out</a google.com>:</p> <p><blockquote> <div><p>If you expected science to give all the answers to the wonderful questions about what we are or where we are going or what the meaning of the universe is and so on, then I think you can easily become disillusioned and then look for some mystic answer to these problems. How a scientist can take a mystic answer I don&#8217;t know because the whole spirit is to understand&#8230; &#8211; well nevermind that, anyway I don&#8217;t understand that. But anyhow; if you think of it &#8211; the way I think of what we&#8217;re doing is: we&#8217;re exploring, we&#8217;re trying to find out as much as we can about the world.</p>

<p>People say to me &#8220;are you looking for the ultimate laws of physics?&#8221; No I&#8217;m not, I&#8217;m just looking to find out more about the world, and if it turns out there is a simple, ultimate law that explains everything, so be it; that would be very nice to discover. If it turns out it&#8217;s like an onion with millions of layers and we&#8217;re just sick and tired of looking at the layers, then <em>that</em>&#8217;s the way it is. But whatever way it comes out, it&#8217;s nature, it&#8217;s there, and she&#8217;s going to come out the way <em>she is</em>. And therefore when we go to investigate it we shouldn&#8217;t predecide what it is we&#8217;re trying to do except to find out more about it. If you say, but your problem is <em>why</em> do you find out more about it: if you thought you were trying to find out more about it because you&#8217;re going to get an answer to some deep philosophical question, you may be wrong &#8211; it may be that you can&#8217;t get an answer to that particular question by finding out more about the character of nature. But I don&#8217;t look at it&#8230; &#8211; <em>my</em> interest in science is to simply find out about the world, and the more I find out [?that?it?is?then?] like to find out.</p>

<p>Ah, there are very remarkable mysteries about the fact we were able to do so many more things than apparently animals can do, and other questions like that. But those are mysteries I want to investigate without knowing the answer to them. And so all together I can&#8217;t believe the special stories that have been made up about our relationship to the universe at large because&#8230; they seem to be&#8230; too <em>simple</em>, too connected to&#8230; too <em>local</em>, too <em>provincial</em>. The Earth! He came to the Earth! <em>One</em> of the aspects of God came <em>to the Earth</em>, mind you. And look at what&#8217;s out there! How can it&#8230; it isn&#8217;t in proportion.</p>

<p>Anyway, it&#8217;s no use arguing, I can&#8217;t argue it, I&#8217;m just trying to tell ya why the scientific views that I have do have some effect on my beliefs.</p>

<p>And also another thing has to do with the question of how do you find out if something is true. And if you have all these theories of the different religions, have all different theories about the thing, then you begin to wonder. Once you start doubting &#8211; just like you&#8217;re supposed to doubt &#8211; you ask me if the science is true, I say &#8220;no no, we don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s true, we&#8217;re trying to find out, everything is possibly wrong.&#8221; Start out understanding religion by saying &#8220;everything is possibly wrong. Let us see.&#8221; As soon as you do that you start sliding down an edge, which is hard to recover from. And so what the scientific view &#8211; or my father&#8217;s view, that we should look to see what&#8217;s true and what may be and may not be true&#8230; Once you start doubting &#8211; which I think is, to me, is a very fundamental part of my soul, is to doubt, and to ask, and when you doubt and ask it gets a little harder to believe.</p>

<p>You see, one thing is, I can live with doubt, and uncertainty, and not knowing. I think it&#8217;s much more interesting to live not knowing, than to have answers which might be wrong. I have approximate answers and possible beliefs and different degrees of certainty about different things but I&#8217;m not absolutely sure of anything and there&#8217;re many things I don&#8217;t know anything about, such as whether it means anything to ask why we&#8217;re here and what the question might mean. I might think about it a little but if I can&#8217;t figure it out, then I go on to something else. But I don&#8217;t <em>have</em> to know an answer. I don&#8217;t have&#8230; I don&#8217;t feel <em>frightened</em> by not knowing things; by being &#8220;lost, in a mysterious universe, without having any purpose&#8221; &#8211; which is the way it really is as far as I can tell, possibly.</p>

<p>It doesn&#8217;t frighten me.</p></div>

</blockquote>

<p>He also once captured it this way: &#8220;Religion is a culture of faith; science is a culture of doubt.&#8221;</p>

<p>I think a lot of antitheists forget to doubt their doubt, though. That&#8217;s what I meant when I referred to epistemology. I find very few people who really grok the notion of doubting on a fundamental level; the notion of skepticism.</p>

<p><div class="quote">He also once captured it this way: &#8220;Religion is a culture of faith; science is a culture of doubt.&#8221;</div> He must not have known very many religious people.  Nearly all of the great Christians in history have had tremendous doubt, from the Apostle Peter himself down through C.S. Lewis.<br><br>Faith is not in opposition to doubt; faith expects doubt.  That is why, for some of us, the practice of apologetics is so important: because we prove to ourselves the logical consistency of belief, so we have something solid to fall back on when we doubt our faith.  As Steve Taylor sang (borrowing from Flannery O'Connor): "Shivering with doubts that were left unattended / so you toss away the cloak that you should have mended / don't you know by now why the chosen are few?  / it's harder to believe than not to."<br><br>Every religious person experiences doubt.

<p>I had to sit on this comment for a couple of days to choose my words, even though it felt wrong right away.</p>

<p>You don&#8217;t give Feynman enough credit. He said religion is a culture of faith; he did not say religion is a culture of blind faith. This is the crux of the entire issue: the doubt you describe is a means, not an end. It is a stepstone to faith (whether it be stronger faith or negative faith).</p>

<p>In contrast, doubt is not a state to be resolved for a skeptic. The basic tenet is acknowledgement that any interesting question is fundamentally unanswerable. To excerpt the salient part of the transcript:</p> <p><blockquote> <div><p>I have approximate answers and possible beliefs and different degrees of certainty about different things but I&#8217;m not absolutely sure of anything and there&#8217;re many things I don&#8217;t know anything about, such as whether it means anything to ask why we&#8217;re here and what the question might mean.</p></div> </blockquote>

<p>We cannot <em>prove</em> anything interesting about the world. We can prove no more than tautologies. Tautologies aren&#8217;t useless: all of mathematics is tautologies. But mathematics is not science &#8211; mathematics does not follow the scientific method. The scientific method does not produce proofs. None of the knowledge we have obtained using the scientific method is proven in any sense of the word.</p>

<p>In science, all we have are theories. Even electromagnetism, arguably the best understood force and phenomenon, is just a theory. We have a lot of confidence in that theory, because observations have lined up with it time and time again &#8211; but <em>no inevitability follows from that</em>. I would not advise that you stick your fingers in a wall plug. However, we do not have <em>proof</em> that you will be shocked and killed by electrity if you do, just sufficient observations that it is clearly unwise to assume otherwise.</p>

<p>So what was it faith in the religious sense that drove Einstein to amend his formul&aelig;? Maybe &#8211; I don&#8217;t know what was going on in his mind. What I do know, however, is that it was clear that relativity <em>did</em> fit much of the data, and in many respects did so very well. To then assume that the theory is incomplete is not a stretch, nor does it necessitate faith in the religious sense. Would he have tried to salvage the theory by adding ever more complex tweaks in response to ever more striking contradictions?</p>

<p>Well, scientists do that. But then, Feynman went on many times and at length about the difficulty of maintaining intellectual honesty and not fooling yourself. He criticised a lot of the &#8220;science&#8221; being done as pseudoscience, done without the necessary care and checking. That is not science.</p>

<p>He was perfectly on the mark: religion is a culture of faith &#8211; science is a culture of doubt.</p>

I was saying that faith in scientific evidence is similar to faith in religious evidence, so saying that scientific faith is not at all like religious faith because religion is not based on scientific evidence is question-begging.

Descartes said, "cogito ergo sum," "I think, therefore I am."

Then there is a second part to the argument which argues that the cause is Personal.  It argues affirmatively that the universe must have been created by a personal, willfull, cause, and that no other beginning is even <b>possible</b> (not merely unknown).<br><br>I was not entirely clear by linking merely to that one Wikipedia page; William Lane Craig touches on this a bit in the <a href="http://www.leaderu.com/truth/3truth11.html" title="leaderu.com">conclusion of his kalam summary</a leaderu.com>, but of course, the argument goes far deeper than that.<br><br>The way I like to explain it is that if the first cause were not personal, acting from infinity (that is, outside of time), then the universe would have been created an infinite time ago (which was already argued in the first part of the discussion to be, at best, unlikely, though I'd claim it impossible), because an impersonal cause could not decide to create the universe, and being outside of time, nothing else could <b>cause the cause</b> to do so either.  In order for a finite universe to have been created, the cause must have decided to create it, which means it must have been a personal cause.<br><br>You can, of course, argue against this logic, but the argument is a sound and strong one.<p><div class="quote">I'd welcome something better than that, if you can provide something.</div> There's more, of course, as I mentioned.  My belief in the existence of the man Jesus Christ is well-supported by the physical evidence (far moreso than any other alternative explanations), and logical deduction makes me believe that the things written in the Bible were believed, by the people who wrote them, to be true.

You are assuming scientific knowledge is superior to other forms of knowledge, and in order to do that, you argue from a scientific position, when instead you need to argue it from an epistemological position.  And that is very difficult, since the concept of scientific knowledge itself is based on the same basic philosophies as those of religious belief.<br><br>But again, I am not doing what you say.  I am more in tune with Sir Isaac Newton, whose very deep, personal, religious belief in the Christian God caused him to believe that therefore the universe was ordered, and understandable.  There is no line of demarcation between religion and science.  They are not the same thing, of course, but they are not opposing forces.  It's like saying that words are superior to numbers, or music superior to lyrics.  You may not like both, and certainly some people who like music hate lyrics and vice versa, but most of the rest of the world doesn't actually see the problem.<br>

<p>Maybe quantum mechanics does turn out to be deterministic rather than stochastic, once we find out enough about it. There are many scientists who are trying to formulate a deterministic foundation for QM.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t see a <em>need</em> for such, though. I can equally well accept the current view, in which existence in the microcosm is acausal, and causality in the mesocosm and above is merely an emergent phenomenon of the incessant, unfathomably numerous interactions of the microcosmic.</p>

<p>Is this what reality is actually like? Many people, even scientists, find the idea unsatisfying. I&#8217;m wary of such calls for a deterministic explanation where they are demanded merely because a stochastic nature for the cosmos is counterintuitive; the human mind is ill-equipped to grasp stochastic processes and emergent phenomena because our intuition is shaped by our experience of the mesocosm. Of course, just because you&#8217;re paranoid doesn&#8217;t mean they&#8217;re not out to get you; and just because a theory is counterintuitive doesn&#8217;t make it more or less likely to be the correct explanation.</p>

Einstein didn&#8217;t incorporate an artificial fix just because he fancied his theory a lot.</div> And how is that different from religious belief?  I believe in Jesus for many solid reasons too.  It is not just that it "sounded rationally convicing," although that is true too.<p><div class="quote">Along the same lines, I&#8217;m rather skeptical of much of the accepted model of contemporary mainstream cosmology, because so much of it relies on so much less observation than, say, electromagnetism.</div> Sure, and you should be skeptical.  Just like I am skeptical of global warming, which has similar observational difficulties.<p><div class="quote">PS.: it just occured to me, after writing the above, that you chose to accentuate your argument by pointing to a belief of yours (that Jesus was real (which I believe as well; and hey, Einstein did too, despite his stated disbelief in a personal god)), whereas I chose to accentuate mine by pointing to how much I have no confidence in. Surely Mr. Feynman must have been joking&#8230;</div> Actually, I had some other beliefs that I have less confidence in (like the evolution of man), but excluded it since I didn't want to stray too far from the point.<br>

The nice thing about science though, is that for the most part you can test your beliefs.<br><br>It's still belief, but it's belief with the option of (non-absolute) proof.

<p><div class="quote">"If we all became atheists tomorrow, would the world suddenly become a better place?"</div> That is a bad anti-atheism argument, but it is a good anti-atheist argument, depending on the atheist, as some atheists actually do, like Dawkins, push the view that religion is the primary cause of many of the world's problems, especially war.<p><div class="quote">"The soviet union's atheist regime killed 20 million"</div> Same thing here.  This does not prove atheism is bad, it proves that those, like Dawkins, who claim that belief in God is worse than atheism are smoking crack.<p><div class="quote">No, atheism is simply a lack of blind faith</div> Atheism has two distinct meanings, and in the U.S., it more commonly means -- in my long experience here -- belief in no God, instead of what I am told is more common in the UK, which is lack of belief.  This is a perfectly legitimate criticism of atheism in the first sense.<p><div class="quote">I'm sorry, but wasn't the earth created about 6000 years ago according the bible?</div> No.  That is an extrapolation based on an interpretation.<br><br>Comment on a photograph coming soon!<br>
