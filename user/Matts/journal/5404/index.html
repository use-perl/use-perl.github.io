<p>Went to see AOTC on Saturday. I was terribly dissappointed in it, especially after everyone said how much better than Episode 1 was. I thought it was tripe - way too much time spent on that whiny prat Anakin and his bitching about how ready he is. The boy needs a slap. It made me wonder if somehow Lucas was trying to garner some sympathy for him, what with the whole scene on tatooine. Yet I felt nothing. I actually laughed a bit. Yeah, the end was good. As was most of the beginning, but I'm wondering how they're going to wrap up the whole gap between Episode 2 and Episode 4 in the next film - seems like an impossible task.<br/><br/>Anyway, it's been nice to have a couple of extra days off work for the Jubilee. We haven't really done things that we said we would - instead we've just kinda messed about around the house and garden. Got sunburnt on Saturday though... The queen looked bored as all hell on TV last night. I think she just wanted to go home, and didn't really care about the party in her garden.<br/><br/>Gloucester didn't seem to have much in the way of Jubilee celebrations. A few fireworks, that's all. There were lots more flags up around Bath when we went there the other day, but then you'd expect that from a place like Bath.<br/><br/>Going to try and get AxKit 1.6 out tonight. Lots of interesting changes there. And hopefully I'm going to try and get more done on my POE tutorial for TPC. We may also take a drive up to Stratford if the weather holds.</p>

Are you sure the flags wern't just up for the yearly Music festival?

It's possible, but the big "Street Party" ones seemed unrelated to any Music Festival.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)<br> <br>Plus they've built an enormous flower crown at the base of the hill up to the University.

Ah, they change that every six months or so anyway...I wouldn't read anything too much into it.  I suspect you're right though.  I wonder if they lifted the ban on drinking in the street for the occasion.
