<p>I spent a fair bit of the weekend fiddling around with Asterisk and softphones on the mac. I want to get an asterisk system setup where I can have an answering machine here built into my server, and email me voicemails, and use it for outgoing conference calls.<br/><br/>I struggled for ages at first to get Asterisk setup - mainly because it just plain doesn't work out of the box on an intel mac. There are binary packages (which run under rosetta I assume) but they don't work. Compiling it myself it all works if I disable pbx_dundi.so and chan_agent.so - that took a while to figure out let me tell you!<br/><br/>So finally with it all working and a couple of free SIP/IAX accounts setup, I try and get the softphones to work. Let me just be straight up about this - it's all utter shite. The only promising option is the Gizmo project, but that requires you connect to their SIP network and doesn't work behind a firewall. Lame. I can't count the number of apps I tried (about 8 I think). I finally settled on JackenIAX.app, which sort of mostly works, but crashes when you answer the phone. Lame.<br/><br/>So for now inbound calls will be routed to my mobile during the day, and to an answer machine at night. I still haven't got a proper inbound number setup - need to consult with $work to see if they'll pay for that (it's only $2.50 a month, plus call charges).<br/><br/>All in, I'm a bit disappointed considering how long the intel macs have been out.<br/><br/>[Oh, and yes I know skype works perfectly well, but I want Asterisk]</p>

Did you try <a href="http://www.loudhush.ro/" title="loudhush.ro">LoudHush</a loudhush.ro>? It only does IAX, not SIP. And while I haven't tried connecting to an Asterisk server, I did successfully connect (and make a call) to an outbound-only IAX provider.

Yes, it's shocking slow on intel. And it crashes. Why would I pay $16 for it?

Bummer. I've only used it on PPC, and it seemed fine the little time I used it. Good to know about Intel though.

Hi!<br/><br/>I don't have an Intel mac to test JackenIAX, so it's debugging via remote<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br/><br/>But I'll be happy to get a crashlog sent to me. Just use the contact page here:

Did you try our idefisk softphone yet ?<br/><br/><a href="http://www.asteriskguru.com/tools/idefisk_mac.php/" title="asteriskguru.com">http://www.asteriskguru.com/tools/idefisk_mac.php/</a asteriskguru.com><br/><br/>It should work fine on both intel and ppc.
(The next version - to be released in a few weeks will feature SIP too).
