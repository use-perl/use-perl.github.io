<p>My co-worker Martin had an interesting problem at work this week. After the latest MS critical upgrade and reboot he could no longer open a particular email. His email client told him he didn't have the correct rights. HIS email client.<br/><br/>And the IT department couldn't solve it.<br/><br/>[*]<br/><br/>So now we have not just a DRM system that possibly protects documents that shouldn't be read, but a DRM system that protects documents that *should* be read. A buggy DRM system. Why am I not surprised? This is certainly a place I never expected computers to go. They were supposed to empower us, not be facilitators in taking power away from us.<br/><br/>[*] I may have some of the details wrong here, as I didn't pay too close attention to it - I'll post corrections on monday if I have any of this wrong.</p>

<blockquote><div>His email client told him he didn't have the correct rights</div></blockquote>
<p>This sounds suspiciously like what my boss said his copy of Outlook said. Although he has not yet told me whether he found out what that e-mail was, who it was from, or whether our IT people could sort it.</p>
<p>The poor guy - his dual boot has been stuck mostly in Windows since he became a manager. Maybe I should encourage him to report to the world his <a href="http://hates-software.com/" title="hates-software.com">love of software</a hates-software.com> </p>
