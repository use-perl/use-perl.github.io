<p>I'm back in the UK now, after what seemed like a very long journey home. I was so very thankful for the waiting car at Heathrow (it works out cheaper for MessageLabs to provide a car than pay for parking) and napped a bit on the road home.<br/><br/>The flight seemed very cramped on the way back. I think despite all the worry about DVT, these new planes have even less legroom than before.<br/><br/>On the plus side, the plane was equipped with on-demand personal entertainment. Thats right - no more waiting for the movie to start/end, plus you can pause it and rewind/ffwd. That's pretty cool, and it made me wonder how they make that work for 400 passengers. Do they have one big 8-way Xeon for everyone or do they have a shared disk and CPUs in every chair? I thought it was quite interesting to think about anyway, and the image quality was very good.<br/><br/>The last couple of days we had free we spent between OMSI, shopping, and chilling. I splurged and bought an AirPort Express. I'm just playing with it now trying to get it to do all the things I want it to do.<br/><br/>Back to work tomorrow. I promise I will blog about the last few days of OSCon this week.</p>

A couple of new US airlines have satellite TV at every seat now, in addition to streaming music and movies.  At the start of one flight I saw them rebooting the system and caught a glimpse of a Linux startup screen, Tux and all.  I'm told that TiVo had something to do with this.

Someone (JetBlue?) is now offering XM Satellite Radio on their flights.  XM is only available over the US[*], which is fine, since this particular airline is currently a domestic carrier.

<p>

Imagine -- 100 channels of radio programming that don't suck, and no iPod batteries to recharge midflight!

<small>*: And Canada?  Their literature talks about service in the lower 48 only, but that should reach ~90% of Canada's population.</small></p>
