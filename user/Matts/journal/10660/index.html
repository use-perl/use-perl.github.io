<p>Hit Cmd-Shift-4 and the pointer turns into a cross-hair. Select the area you want to screenshot by dragging the mouse.

<p>called Snapz which apple started to bundle in with Jaguar. You can get the Pro X version for a small upgrade price http://www.ambrosiasw.com/utilities/snapzprox/. I've been using this for years. I *heart* AmbrosiaSW<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

Really? I'm pretty sure the shortcuts that Matt described are built-ins rather than nabbed from Snapz (which is a great product by the way). I certainly don't have Snapz on my machine, but do have the shortcuts.<br> <br>Oh yeah, screenshots can be command-line generated as well, though I'm not really sure what this offers you over the keyboard shortcuts: maybe scriptability (and aliasing capability).

<p>hmm...I thought apple had started bundling Snapz since it came with my dual powermac last fall and that shortcut Matt mentioned is exactly like the snapz shortcut. </p>

Cmd-shift-4 has <i> <b> <a href="http://www.nobleswan.com/misc/keys/keys.html" title="nobleswan.com">always</a nobleswan.com> </b> </i> been <i>screenshot of the selected area</i> all the way back to the 680x0 Macs.  Cmd-shift-3 has always been capture the entire screen, and Cmd-shift-[12] used to be eject the internal/external floppy, back when that made sense.
<p>
Ambrosia's product patched the Mac traps to override the standard behavior and use their product instead.  It may well come pre-installed with some recent mac models for some period of time.  (My iBook didn't come with Quicken this summer, but my iMac did this fall.)  All I can say is that I never got Snapz with my Macs.
</p><p>
The interesting and obvious difference with OS X is that the screen shot is a PDF file.  It used to be a bitmap, and changed to a PICT file in some reasonably modern release of MacOS.</p>

<p>Apple apparently bundles it only with the powermacs along with Omnigraffle and Omnioutliner. I've used snapz for so long I forgot the crap one that the old Mac OS had by default. Snapz will export the screenshots to PDF or jpeg or quicktime movies. It's a pity Apple didn't license snapz as part of the OS since it's so much more usable than the one that the os has.</p>

<p>I just don't understand Apple's new love affair with PDF.</p>

Me either.<br> <br>but if you hold down ctrl it goes to the clipboard which is better.

Eh. It's a bitmap embedded in a PDF, so you can open it with bitmap apps (e.g. photoshop) and get what you want. PDF's a very flexible format.

<h2>Re:PDF love</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/TorgoX/">TorgoX</a> on 2003-02-20T07:21:46</h3>
So why the PDF? Why not just generate a PNG instead?

<h2>Re:PDF love</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/darobin/">darobin</a> on 2003-02-20T13:02:35</h3>
<p>
  Because the entire interface is PDF. PDF has some excellent features for a high-level graphic interface. Just dumping some PDF is simple for them I guess.
</p>

<p>
  Of course, they should have used SVG, but unfortunately the REC came out a little too late for them. However the model is almost exactly the same, and it's no coincidence.

  Care to elaborate? (not on the saving of a snapshot but on using PDF for UI).

<h2>It messes up with BBEdit</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/graouts/">graouts</a> on 2003-02-19T12:01:06</h3>
It is quite a cool functionality but that prevents me from using cmd+shift+4 within BBEdit and an AZERTY keyboard to switch to window 4. Anybody has a workaround to this?



<blockquote>

<h2>Re:It messes up with BBEdit</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Matts/">Matts</a> on 2003-02-19T13:29:40</h3>
Don't use BBEdit. It really does suck<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)

<h2>Re:It messes up with BBEdit</h2>

So what do you use instead?!  (and don't say emacs or vim...)



<blockquote>

<h2>Re:It messes up with BBEdit</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Matts/">Matts</a> on 2003-02-20T08:24:14</h3>
I use Project Builder. It sucks too, but slightly less than BBEdit. I also use jEdit, which doesn't suck but is slow on my G3. I look forward to getting the G4 so I can switch to jEdit full time.

If you think BBEdit sucks, you likely haven't used it much.

Maybe this is something odd to do with the AZERTY layout, but for me (UK QWERTY), command 4 will switch to the fourth window; I don't need shift.<br> <br>Perhaps you could email Bare Bones support? They're usually responsive, even when it turns out to be a silly user error (like my expectation that C-w would work the same in Emacs mode as it does in the shell; it doesn't, and hence it does a different thing in BBEdit too). The address is support [at] barebones.com.

<h2>I use this, too</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/petdance/">petdance</a> on 2003-02-19T14:52:40</h3>
I use this shortcut, too, so that I can print my calendar from Entourage.
<p>
That's right, Entourage doesn't have any print functionality that prints a calendar like I see on the screen, which is EXACTLY the format I want on paper to go on my bulletin board.</p>
