<p>Like Garfield, I hate mondays. Catching up on mountains of emails, trying to get back into the swing of work, and recovering from a tiring weekend.<br/><br/>We managed to find a nice roll-top bureau to put under the stairs on Saturday. It was really cheap (ÃÂ£120) although I guess you get what you pay for... It was self assemble, and while most of the instructions were sane enough, some parts said "Varnished side". So I loyally made sure the varnished edge pointed in the right directions at several points in the construction. Did it go together right like that? Did it buggery. Some git in the manufacturers warehouse had obviously varnished the wrong edge in a couple of spots. Grrrr! So apart it came while I rearrange it.<br/><br/>That done, Sunday I spent doing the tech review of the new O'Reilly book "Perl and XML". The picture on the cover is of two monkeys. Hmm.<br/><br/>I also managed to get through the Perl Review while having a nice relaxing bath. It looks like it could be an interesting magazine. I think they should try and sell some advertising though, and stick with the PDF format. I guess that's contraversial, as people like free things, especially if there's no advertising. But I'd rather the Perl Review were financially viable than free.<br/><br/>Finally, in bed I read some of the shiny new "mod_perl Cookbook". It's a Sams book, who aren't exactly renouned for excellent technical publications, however this seems to be the one to break that rule - at least so far (I'm only on page 78 out of 600+). The cookbook style makes it both readable, and more importantly, flickable - I can flick it open to just about any page and read something new and cool. Anyway, mine is a preview/review copy, so I'm going to read it a lot more thoroughly and post a review on somewhere like Take23.org or maybe perlmonks or maybe even here.<br/><br/>Today I'm going to try and hack out XML::Handler::AxPoint, which will mean I can do my XML/PDF presentations on my Win2K laptop a lot easier than I can at the moment (64M of RAM plus Apache + mod_perl on NT2K don't really go too well together). I guess I should just get some more RAM :-)</p>

<h2>Get RAM</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ajtaylor/">ajtaylor</a> on 2002-02-04T17:19:15</h3>
Yes, Matt, you really should get more RAM. I'm amazed you can even do anything at all w/ only 64MB. You should have at least 128MB for W2K. It's been very stable for me, but it does like memory. And add mod_perl + AxKit on top of that, and your drive must be swapping like crazy!<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)
<p>
I don't know how prices are across the pond, but RAM is still relatively cheap here. It's worth it to stock up if you can.</p>
