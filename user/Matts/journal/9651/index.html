<p>Here's my xmas plans:
<ol><li>Read "Machine Learning" by Tom Mitchell
<p><em>Nope. Haven't touched it :-(</em>
<li>Figure out all the little details of Ken's AI::Categorize module(s)
<p><em>Haven't even downloaded it.</em>
<li>Start up take23.org again (maybe)
<p><em>Nope.</em>
<li>Hack on AxKit a bit
<p><em>Nope - but I will get to this next week</em>
<li>Figure out what the hell I'm going to buy my wife for christmas...
<p><em>Done. Tickets for Les Mis on New Years Eve.</em>
<li>Eat lots, get fat
<p><em>Done, though I seem to have managed to not put on much weight. Whoop!</em>
<li>Go to the gym lots, get fit
<p><em>Got sick. Conflicts with gym time.</em>
<li>Fix up a few of my perl modules I've been procrastinating on
<p><em>Done. Whoop!</em>
<li>Spend some time with family, and away from my computer more ;-)
<p><em>Failed miserably. Wife bought me "Medal of Honour, Allied Assault" for xmas, and it's really hard to put down.</em>

Still one week to go though. :-)</p>

<h2>MoHAA</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/gnat/">gnat</a> on 2002-12-28T22:30:02</h3>
W00t!  I hear you on Medal of Honor.  If I had my druthers, I'd be playing it non-stop.  Now's the time, by the way, to play--before you have kids.  Gaming time disappears after you have kids.  I still haven't finished MoHAA, and I got it soon after I got my Mac in the middle of the year.  Orwant picked it up after me, and has already (I believe) finished it.  Not that I'm occasionally jealous of his childless wastrel lifestyle.<p>
