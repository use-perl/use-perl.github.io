<p>Well I had a great conference, and will write more up on it later. I'm a little hung over this morning as we decided that since we got upgraded to a huge room we should have a small party. So I invited as many people as I could (most people were heading off on Friday) and asked everyone to bring something to drink. We bought in 4 huge pizzas (which was the big cost for us) and we had a few bottles of wine and beer.<br/><br/>Loads of people turned up, there were probably about 30 people here at one point. Surprisingly for a party that size there were only a couple of mishaps - someone was sick in the bathroom (though whoever it was didn't leave much of a mess) and someone else used my wife's Chanel eye makeup (which Heather will throw away now as she's very sensitive about that kind of thing). Besides those minor things we both had a good time, and enjoyed seeing friends.<br/><br/>Today is the FlÃÂ¼gtag which we'll probably just watch from the balcony of our hotel room. We're pretty much all geeked out now, and want to spend some time with each other.</p>

<p>Have you considered the possibility that you probably haven't searched well enough?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>

You know, I wasn't going to say anything but now that you mention it, geoff did seem to have a just a <i>little</i> extra sparkle...
</p>
<p>Seriously, though, great party. Sucks that someone decided that your more than ample hospitality wasn't enough and helped themselves, but fsck 'em-- what goes around comes around.

<p>Cheers,</p>
