<div class="span8">
<p>Following on from chromatic's journal entry about quieter tests I thought I'd make a full journal post about Test::Verbose.<br/><br/>If you test, you <b>need</b> Test::Verbose.<br/><br/>The simple "tv" command line it installs will run all your tests, some of your tests, or an individual test. Unlike "prove" it is an interface to "make test" rather than a separate script for running tests, so if you make changes you don't need a separate "make" phase to get things into blib.<br/><br/>More importantly though is you can run tv with the -q option to make it only display errors, -qq to make it only display the final results table, or -qqq to make it display nothing at all (but exit with a relevant return code). This last option makes it perfect from cron job smoke tests.<br/><br/>Try it out today. You won't go back.</p>

<h2>make test</h2>

It does require a makefile, no?<br> <br>I don't have that for my applications. A typical directory structure looks like this:<blockquote><div><nobr> <wbr></nobr><tt>/project<br>&nbsp;<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/bin<br>&nbsp;<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/lib<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/My<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Module.pm<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/The<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/Other<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mod.pm<br>&nbsp;<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/t<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; My-Module.t<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; The-Other-Mod.t</tt> </div></blockquote>The<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.t files contain a 'use lib "lib", "../lib";' to point to the module directory.<br> <br>Like chromatic I usually just type perl t/FILENAME to run a certain test file, but I also enter the t directory and run prove to test them all.<br> <br>If I have a huge amount of modules in my lib dir, what kind of makefile setup would I have? One for each? One for them all? Where would it go?

You would have one Makefile.PL with a very simple contents:<blockquote><div> <tt>use ExtUtils::MakeMaker;<br>WriteMakefile(<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; NAME =&gt; 'projectname',<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; AUTHOR =&gt; 'me',<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; VERSION =&gt; '1.0',<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; ABSTRACT =&gt; 'this is my project',<br>);</tt> </div></blockquote>You can change a few of those to extract better info, but you don't really need it.<br> <br>ExtUtils::MakeMaker will find all your<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.pm files under a lib/ directory.

<h2>Use prove</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/petdance/">petdance</a> on 2005-01-12T17:47:18</h3>
<i>prove</i> is now standard with Test::Harness and Perl itself.  I'd rather that people start/keep using it.

<h2>Re:Use prove</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Matts/">Matts</a> on 2005-01-12T20:33:35</h3>
But prove doesn't do the same thing. It doesn't call "make test", and since it has been designed <em>not</em> to call "make test", it very likely won't every be changed to do so by default, right?

<h2>Re:Use prove</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jplindstrom/">jplindstrom</a> on 2005-01-12T20:56:36</h3>
I'm ignorant: why is that better?

<h2>Re:Use prove</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Matts/">Matts</a> on 2005-01-12T21:10:59</h3>
Because with prove my t files have to contain "use lib 'lib';" in order to see changes in my lib directory, and that could cause odd errors if you're not very careful (overriding a blib directory that you don't expect it to do).

See <a href="http://use.perl.org/comments.pl?sid=24468&amp;cid=37425" title="perl.org">http://use.perl.org/comments.pl?sid=24468&amp;cid=37425</a perl.org> for the handling of this.
<p>
And, if it doesn't do what you want, ask.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>

It doesn't do what I want. I want something that runs "make test".<br> <br>What if my files aren't just in lib/, but are in completely separately named directories, each with their own Makefile.PL - MakeMaker picks this up and gets everything into blib, but prove won't see them.<br> <br>See XML::Parser for an example of this.

<h2>Re:Use prove</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/petdance/">petdance</a> on 2005-01-13T15:35:13</h3>
OK, that's not going to work then.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)
<p>
The #1 reason to have <i>prove</i> is so that you don't have to have a Makefile or run <i>make test</i> at all.  So in this case, it would defeat the purpose of running prove.
</p><p>
Is there anything we can/should add to Test::Harness to make it more useful to you?</p>

<p>A way to print only summaries and failures with diagnostics would be nice.</p>

Andy updated prove a while back at the request of David Wheeler and myself with an option to include the local lib directory.<blockquote><div> <tt>-l, --lib&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Add lib to the path for your tests.</tt> </div></blockquote>So<blockquote><div> <tt>MyModule$&gt; prove -lv t/.*t</tt> </div></blockquote> will run all test files in t/ with lib/ included in @INC.
