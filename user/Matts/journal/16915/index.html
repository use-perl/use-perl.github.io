<p>OK, so it's now been months since I wrote in my journal. For any regular readers here I apologise for not keeping up with updates.<br/><br/>Life has been pretty hectic lately, but I think is starting to head back towards normality. Here's the major happenings in the last few weeks/months:
<ul>
<li>We finished version 1.0 development of the quarantine system. It works, and is now running for several thousand users. And I'm mostly happy with the design and the code.
<li>We hired someone else to work on the quarantine system so I can get back to developing our anti-spam engine. Yay!
<li>My in-laws came to stay (from Canada) for 4 weeks over christmas.
<li>I re-subscribed to spamassassin-dev and spamassassin is now (pretty much) completely migrated over to being a project at the ASF (apache.org). We'll have to see where this leads - maybe I'll get back into development of it, maybe I won't. Not sure yet.
<li>I re-wrote our anti-spam engine mostly from scratch so that it would be much easier to add in components, and also give us better logging and improved functionality.
<li>The spam team here is now 5 people (currently 8 though with 3 contractors doing asian language stuff), and I'm no longer heading it up - which is a good thing as heading up the team is time consuming management stuff.
<li>I started cycling to work.
<li>I sold my sports car and bought something cheaper (and more comfortable!).
</ul>
And various personal things happened in between all that.<br/><br/>Overall though I'm looking forward to getting back to a bit more R&D work, and possibly releasing a few more CPAN modules now I've been surpassed as the most prolific CPAN author :-)</p>
