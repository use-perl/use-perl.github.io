<p><b>5 lines of code per 10 minutes is a good average.</b><br/><br/>That may seem crazy, but I'm talking averaging over a month or a year. And of course I'm talking Perl - for C multiply by 10 or 100. Plus some people code in their sleep so average over the entire 24 hour period.<br/><br/>Today was a good example. I wrote 3 lines of code the entire day because I spent the rest of the day looking up documentation and reading mailing list archives and working through problems in my head. So it puts my averages down. Other days I code more, or I wouldn't hit Matt's Rule.</p>

<h2>NoCodMo</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Yanick/">Yanick</a> on 2007-02-09T14:47:50</h3>
Musing about the average # of lines per day makes me think of the NoWriMo. NoWriMo, standing for November Writing Month, is an world-wide event where writers get together and pledge to write 50,000 words in one month (guess which one?). There's no condition put on the quality of the work, mind you; the goal is just to provide a motivation to unclog the ol' production pipe.<br><br>In addition of the NoWriMo, there's the NoEdMo, which is for editing. Which makes me wonder if, next November, I shouldn't jump into the bandwagon and create a NoCodMo of some sort... A giant, month-long hack-a-thon. It has its appeal, in a nightmarish kind of way.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

Actually I think that would be brilliant. Goal produce one functional non-trivial application in a month. Not a bloody framework, nor a quiet little module that someone might find useful(1), but a god-as-my-witness-user-interface-driven application. Choice of GUI is left to you, HTML, GTK, TK, Wx, Flash, who cares<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... but build a full application in 30 days.<br><br>I would probably sign on and do something like that.<br><br>1) Not that you can't create these too in the process of building The App, but I'm finding that you'll never feed your children only writing meta-code.

&gt; Actually I think that would be brilliant.<br><br>My. Thank you.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br><br>&gt; Goal produce one functional non-trivial application in a month.<br><br>Yup, that could be a good goal. Actually, finding a goal (or set of goals)<br>that will attract and make sense for a large amount of people will<br>be the hard part. Building an application is already a good metric,<br>although a mite fuzzy. Lines of code, as commited to a repository, might<br>be another, but then we'll have to find a good target to reach -- which<br>will doubtlessly wildly vary in function of the used language. Some<br>serious thoughts will have to go into this.<br><br>&gt; I would probably sign on and do something like that.<br><br>A potential follower, excellent! Well, check my blog here<br>from time to time. If I attempt anything, it'll be posted there.<br>
