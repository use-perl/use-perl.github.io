<p>Databases are whacky things. Programming for them is very different to hacking Perl. Well it's not *so* different, but where you get performance differences is always, umm, odd.<br/><br/>Now after my earlier annoyance the postgresql team have documented this temp tables bug in their FAQ, and also put in a work around which is to use EXECUTE (which executes a string as SQL) so that the table name isn't cached.<br/><br/>After all that I refactored some of it. It turned out that my incling to move everything into a stored procedure was premature. Pg's SP language (plpgsql) isn't all that fast, so things were actually quicker being done inside perl-space, via a pre-prepared statement.<br/><br/>Then I discovered something I should have figured out a while ago - what was taking so long was the inserts into the temporary table. So I got cunning. I figured out a way to implement it using a couple of views and a simple join. So now I could make everything happen in a single perl loop, a dash of sort (using the Schwartzian Transform), and a slice of umm... slice.<br/><br/>The other thing I did was found a great short article about optimising Pg on linux systems. It amounts to increasing the shared memory and setting a few extra Pg parameters. Doing that pretty much tripled the speed of the thing.<br/><br/>So now what was taking between 600 and 1000ms takes about 60ms. Which means I can actually deploy this now (if we decide to do so). Schweet.<br/><br/>Maybe one day I can actually talk about what the hell it is I'm doing with this database ;-)<br/><br/><b>Update:</b> The article in question was <a href="http://www.phpbuilder.com/columns/smith20010821.php3?page=1">this one</a> at phpbuilder</a>.</p>
