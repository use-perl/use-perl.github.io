<p>    Having returned home from England to miserable weather it brightened up
    yesterday so I decided to take my bike out for a short ride - I needed
    the exercise and it would be good to combine my hobby with excercise.<br/><br/>    So I planned a simple route on google maps, didn't look far and took me
    past a lake and a river. Packed my camera and off I went. Took a wrong
    turn once - onto a road that just wasn't on google. Bah. But had a nice
    ride. Realised shortly into the ride that it probably wasn't such a
    "short" ride. I think it was about 25km. And I haven't cycled in over a
    year.<br/><br/>    I also got a puncture. This was a major downer as I had nobody to call
    to come and get me, and no spare, no pump, no repair kit. So I had to
    walk the remaining 3km home. And it got COLD as the sun went down, and
    while I was warm enough in just a t-shirt when I was cycling, walking
    was a different matter.<br/><br/>    Oh and my butt is still sore from the damn sadle. Why can't they invent
    a comfy bike seat? I have one of those gel covers, but I guess my body
    just isn't designed for sitting on a thin wedge of leather.<br/><br/>    Anyhow, upshot is I did get some fairly decent shots off. Which given
    that I'm heading to Boston just now, is good because I can post some
    this week. Here's the first - the Grand River at Fountain St Bridge
    looking toward Cambridge.<br/><br/>    <a href='

<h2>leather saddle?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/dug/">dug</a> on 2006-03-27T18:54:56</h3>
Have you tried a leather saddle?<br><br>My father puts some serious miles on his bicycle, and has been happy with his leather saddle.  They take a while to break it in, but in his words, "Instead of your ass conforming to the saddle, the saddle conforms to your ass".<br><br>-- Douglas Hunter
