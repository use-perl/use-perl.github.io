<p>I managed to get the parse of large.xml (a 70K file) down from 9 seconds to about 7 or 8 seconds. Not a huge improvement - and I didn't feel my time was terribly well spent, at least until I tried bleadperl (5.7.2 current), where previously it had been significantly slower (about 17 seconds) and was now down to about 8 or 9 seconds (it will always be slower because it does many more unicode checks when running under a unicode capable perl). So that's good.<br/><br/>Well good is perhaps an overstatement, since libxml2's "xmllint" program takes 29ms to parse the same file. Ah well, I think it's time to stop worrying about parsing performance, and start thinking about full compliance instead.<br/><br/>Why does perl make for such a crappy parser?</p>

<h2>Why?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/mirod/">mirod</a> on 2002-02-01T10:26:40</h3>
Because Perl s***s at XML<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;--) (I will hunt you down  anywhere you hide muaaaahahahaha!)



<h2>It may be obvious, but...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/godoy/">godoy</a> on 2002-02-01T12:15:11</h3>
Matt, it may be obvious, but have you compared the algorithms used at xmllint and your Pure Perl parser?
<br>
<br>C allows some optimizations where Perl allow them to occur in other places.

The problem is that Perl is just slow. Not really much I can do about that. When you compare it to C, where it can do really nice things like char = ++*p to get the current character and move to the next byte in a string . With perl a similar idiom is: $char = substr($str, 0, 1, ''), which has a lot more overhead (same for a regexp to do the same). Character-wise coding in perl has always been a bit of a pain.

Err, that should have been char = *p++.
<br>
<br>My C sucks<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)

<p>Maybe someone needs to write a character-array manipulation class, a la PDL for huge matrix crunching.  The class would gain a lot in efficiency for trading away the many capabilities Perl ordinarily gives.  This would be something gross in XS, I'm sure.</p>

<p>Or maybe, if I'm thinking of writing a custom text-manipulation class for <b>Perl</b>, something's dreadfully wrong with the world.  In much the same way that we always took XML::Parser's dependence on a C parser as an indication that something was wrong (and we were right).</p>

<p>Remember the C&lt;less&gt; pragma?  You could supposedly <tt>use less 'memory'</tt> or whatever, and the interpreter would switch optimizations around to trade speed or whatever for memory.  It'd be cool if you could trade off abilities on a scalar for efficiency.  As in, declare that this scalar can never be bound to a regex operator such as m// or s///.</p>

<p>What am I rambling about?</p>

<h2>Profiling</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jdavidb/">jdavidb</a> on 2002-02-04T18:15:09</h3>
<p>I'm presuming the answer is "Yes," but did you profile the code?</p>

<p>matts: "Yes, jdavidb, I profiled the code and discovered 80% of the processing occurs in statements like <tt>$c = substr($buf, 0, 1);</tt>  Get off my case!<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)"</p>

Hehe, yeah I did profile, lots. (out of interest, anyone know why "use File::Temp" causes DProf to segfault?)
<br>
<br>I'm going to post something to perlmonks including the profiling output and the heavy subs in question. Maybe someone there can help out.
