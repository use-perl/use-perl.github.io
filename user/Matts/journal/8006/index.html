<h2>Templating the K-Hole</h2>

It's HTML::Template...  on K!

<h2>Not Yet Another Template Module - Argh!</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/merlyn/">merlyn</a> on 2002-09-25T17:22:50</h3>
Yeah, especially with the arrogance of this phrase:
<blockquote><div> <i>Although there are many different template modules at CPAN, I couldn't find any that would meet my expectations. So I created this one, with following features:
</i> </div></blockquote>
and then goes on to build something that looks like it was stolen partially from <a href="http://www.tt2.org/" title="tt2.org">Template Toolkit</a tt2.org>, except without the thousands of manhours of development and usage.
<p>
I don't see anything there that couldn't be done trivially with TT2.  In fact, you could probably hack a 50-line TT filter, and run it inline. {grin}</p>

You know, I think these competing implementations are a good thing.  This particular one will probably be used by nobody but the author and be largely ignored, but...<br> <p>It was probably a good exercise for the author to write it, debug and document it and since he went to all the trouble, isn't it good that he offers it up to others?<br> </p><p>Who knows?  Maybe this one will find a niche as a TT-lite that runs fast and is easy to extend because of it's simplicity.  If it becomes really successful, maybe it will be extended to be identical to TT and be just as fast.  Wouldn't THAT be a good thing?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>

The problem is it confuses CPAN newbies. People go there and search for "Template" and get back so many hits they don't know what to do with them.<br> <br>People really aught to ask somewhere (like modules@perl.org) before uploading these.

Yeah, maybe so.  <br> <p>But, CPAN is kinda anarchic, no?  I mean, there's no submission/rejection criteria, right?  There's a lot of good reasons not to have that, too, right?  What are we to do, except encourage people to be responsible?  Maybe CPAN should support a "See Also" link at the top level for related modules.<br> </p><p>I guess that's all you're doing with your LART award.  Encouraging responsible use of CPAN.</p>

<h3><a href="/user/Matts/">Matts</a> on 2002-09-26T06:43:23</h3>
Yep, exactly.<br> <br>It's been suggested that gbarr puts a link from the search.cpan.org module page to either a page on perlmonks or use.perl where people can comment on the module. I think that's probably the best way to handle something like this.<br> <br>Alternatively allow user ratings plus comments direct on the site, though that can be incredibly demoralizing for anyone involved in giving away their hard work for free.

<h2>Looks similar to HTML_Template_IT</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/broquaint/">broquaint</a> on 2002-10-02T17:36:16</h3>
The syntax and interface has distinct echoes of PHP's own templating system <a href="http://pear.php.net/manual/en/packages.templates.it.php" title="php.net">HTML_Template_IT</a php.net>.
