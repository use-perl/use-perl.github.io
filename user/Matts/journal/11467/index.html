<p>My wife was singing this yesterday.
<i>
        The soldier came knocking upon the queen's door
        He said, "I am not fighting for you any more"
        The queen knew she'd seen his face someplace before
        And slowly she let him inside.<br/><br/>        He said, "I've watched your palace up here on the hill
        And I've wondered who's the woman for whom we all kill
        But I am leaving tomorrow and you can do what you will
        Only first I am asking you why."<br/><br/>        Down in the long narrow hall he was led
        Into her rooms with her tapestries red
        And she never once took the crown from her head
        She asked him there to sit down.<br/><br/>        He said, "I see you now, and you are so very young
        But I've seen more battles lost than I have battles won
        And I've got this intuition, says it's all for your fun
        And now will you tell me why?"<br/><br/>        The young queen, she fixed him with an arrogant eye
        She said, "You won't understand, and you may as well not try"
        But her face was a child's, and he thought she would cry
        But she closed herself up like a fan.<br/><br/>        And  she said, "I've swallowed a secret burning thread
        It cuts me inside, and often I've bled"
        He laid his hand then on top of her head
        And he bowed her down to the ground.<br/><br/>        "Tell me how hungry are you? How weak you must feel
        As you are living here alone, and you are never revealed
        But I won't march again on your battlefield"
        And he took her to the window to see.<br/><br/>        And the sun, it was gold, though the sky, it was gray
        And she wanted more than she ever could say
        But she knew how it frightened her, and she turned away
        And would not look at his face again.<br/><br/>        And he said, "I want to live as an honest man
        To get all I deserve and to give all I can
        And to love a young woman who I don't understand
        Your highness, your ways are very strange."<br/><br/>        But the crown, it had fallen, and she thought she would break
        And she stood there, ashamed of the way her heart ached
        She took him to the doorstep and she asked him to wait
        She would only be a moment inside.<br/><br/>        Out in the distance her order was heard
        And the soldier was killed, still waiting for her word
        And while the queen went on strangeling in the solitude she preferred
        The battle continued on<br/><br/>THE QUEEN AND THE SOLDIER, Suzanne Vega

<h2>Suzanne Vega</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/petdance/">petdance</a> on 2003-04-07T01:56:31</h3>
I love "The Queen And The Soldier".  Anyone who thinks they know Suzanne Vega because of "Luka" or "Tom's Diner" should pick up the first album.  It's brilliant.  "TQ&amp;TS" is my favorite song on there, but "Cracking" and "Small Blue Thing" and "Freeze Tag" are all gems as well.
