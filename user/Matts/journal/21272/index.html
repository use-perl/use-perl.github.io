<p>Some of you know already that in the coming months my wife and I shall be moving to Canada. For the past 6 months now we've been waiting for my Permanent Residence application to go through, and finally today we received my passport back with a tiny laminated page containing my immigration visa.<br/><br/>Work-wise is undecided yet. I've asked MessageLabs if they will consider me working as a telecommuter from Canada, and I haven't had official word back from them yet so I continue to look at other options.<br/><br/>Meanwhile we've put the house on the market, and spent a few weekends now getting the house ready to have its picture taken. Hopefully when the estate agent comes around tomorrow it will be spick and span for them.<br/><br/>When we move is entirely dependent on when we sell the house (that's where all our equity is). So I shall keep you all informed via this journal. Lots to do (as I'm sure you can imagine) so I'll get back to it now.</p>

We want to be close enough to Heather's parents so she can visit regularly, but far enough away that it's a "trip" to get there<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br> <br>They're in Kitchener, Ontario.<br> <br>Assuming I can telecommute we'll probably live where we can get the best value for money house-wise (as long as I can still get broadband there!).

Very cool. You'll have a short drive to YAPC next year! And you'll be close to Buffalo. It's a great area to live in.

Awesome.<br> <br>The KW perl mongers are at your disposal, in case you need remote hands for anything in this area.<br> <br>And I'm sure the same goes for the Toronto PMs, just give a shout.<br>
