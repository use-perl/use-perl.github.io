<p>I had a play with TextMate today. It seems to fix a bunch of things I don't like about TextWrangler (which is my editor of choice).<br/><br/>So is there anyone who started using it only to give it up? If so why?<br/><br/>The major thing that's missing (that I like in TW) is Open via SFTP. Seems like that might get added to TextMate at some point as there appears to be a bunch of requests for it.</p>

I have a full version of BBEdit to do web stuff with and I am a Vim user. I didn't see how TM gave me anything worth switching from Vim from for my normal editing tasks and BBEdit gives me all the bells and whistles for my web editing.

I'm also a paid up BBEdit user, (and long-time vim user) but have long ago ditched BBEdit for TextMate. Strong points of TextMate include really powerful and straightforward extensibility, a vibrant (largely applescript free!) community, and an incredibly responsive and sensitive developer. Weak points are few and becoming fewer, but one that might bite down the track is that it can choke rather badly on large files (think large xml files, for instance): the parsing code needs an overhaul for such tasks, and I'm pretty sure it's coming in TextMate 2.0 (free upgrade for 1.x owners, and due to be released around the time of 10.5).<br><br>Anyway, definitely worth an extended trial period to see if it hits the spot. Advantages over BBEdit/TextWrangler? Look and feel, latex mode (really superior), and ease of development (of personal bundles, for instance).<br><br>Re the sftp issue: I use transmit or fugu in the main, but have lately taken to using MacFuse/sshfs to access remote files. Depends a lot on your pipe to the remote machine, but if it's "considerable" you might want to give that a go.<br><br>Cheers,<br>Paul

I tried using sshfs once but my net connection is just too flaky here for it, and it doesn't recover very well from disconnects. I guess I could use TextWranger the few times I need ssh edits.

Using Cyberduck or Transmit or one of the [s]ftp clients that supports an external editor isn't horrible in the cases where you need to edit on an external site. However it does suck to end up lacking the things like easy integrated navigation etc (having to swap between Cyberduck and TM to chose files etc is a pain).<br><br>I had a TM snippet at one point that would rsync my working directory properly which was really quite nice. TextMate has for me won the Text Editor Wars and is one of the two applications that means I will be using OSX for the foreseeable future.
