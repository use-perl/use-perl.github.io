<p>Got an email this morning saying that the changes I'd made to <a href="http://www.messagelabs.com/">our AV software</a> meant we couldn't release a new version. Basically I'd used File::Spec->rel2abs, but our servers use perl 5.00503, which has an old broken File::Spec. Darn it. I guess I need to fix the release system so we can pull an old version from CVS in case it all goes tits up.<br/><br/>Anyway, on top of that, ssh++ - it allowed me to fix the bug while drinking my coffee in my dressing gown in the kitchen :-)<br/><br/>Also this week <a href="http://xml.com/pub/q/perlxml">perl XML god</a> Kip Hampton added support to AxKit for separating the content and the style providers (historically these were tied together due to lack of cluestick on my behalf, and because I always imagined the only use of alternate providers was in a humungous CMS system where you'd want to get everything from a database). This will mean I can finally do some of the neato things that I want to be able to offer via AxKit - like direct delivery of POD via AxKit. And so in order to do that last night I hacked together most of Pod::SAX - a Pod parser that produces SAX events. Or a SAX parser for Pod. Whatever you want to call it ;-)<br/><br/>I'm also pretty darn sick of this infuriating Nigerian Scam. SpamAssassin seems to not be doing a very good job with it, because it's constantly changing. It's also written in a very business-like manner, so I suspect it's always going to be very hard to distinguish between it and real business emails. Very annoying.</p>
