<p>Yesterday was a bit of mayhem for me. I had two things to do, both in London.<br/><br/>Of course I took the train, but due to the joys of British Rail (or whoever happens to be running this little corner of hell at this time), my train was cancelled (not without announcing the train was coming, of course, and having everyone walk the 500 yards to the platform in the pouring rain, and nobody announces it is cancelled - they are too afraid, they just change the text on the display. *bah*). The next train took me to Bristol so that we could all change to a train that might actually arrive to take us to London. That train took a detour due to flooding. I arrived in London an hour and a half later than I needed to.<br/><br/>A short taxi ride later and I was at the MessageLabs offices in Gt Portland Street, where the film crew (ok, the camera man and the interviewer) were set up already waiting for me. We did the filming, which went very quickly (despite being filmed outside the gents toilets, and all the traffic and noise that caused), and I think went reasonably well (watch out for a series on the internet on CNBC some time soon).<br/><br/>Then I had to jump in a taxi and head off to IISS in central(ish) London for a small conference with the E-Envoy and various other high level IT personel from banks and defense departments. The conference was all about the use of Open Source in government (which the UK seems to have a fairly good policy on, as far as I could make out - though I don't have the time to study it in detail). It was interesting in places, and Alex (my co-worker) and I gave a talk on how open source has affected the anti-virus and anti-spam worlds (and some personal insight into open source from me).<br/><br/>Finally got home at about 9pm, where I saw a Badger as I pulled into our street! Nice end to the day.</p>
