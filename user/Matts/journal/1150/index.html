<p>I've been working hard on getting XML::SAX::PurePerl conformance up. To that end I used the Oasis XML conformance test suite, specifically James Clark's section of tests, which seem really well suited to how I like to work (unfortunately I don't think I can ship them with the module due to licensing restrictions).<br/><br/>So, now XML::SAX::PurePerl will parse all but one of the 119 test cases in the valid/standalone directory. That leaves a lot of test cases left to look at, but I think it's better to work on the ability to parse valid documents than to detect invalid ones. At least at first.<br/><br/>Oh, and the document it won't parse?
<tt>
&lt;foo :="bar"/>
</tt>
Yes, that is valid XML.<br/><br/>So, that got us thinking about why it was valid. Well the colon character is a valid character for the start of an XML Name. Which allows you to do XML smileys! So the following is a valid XML document, and parses with both expat and libxml2:
<tt>
&lt;:-/>
</tt>
Yes, <em>of course</em> I've updated my .sig accordingly. Sad XML geek as I am.<br/><br/>In other news, I bought some RAM this week. Thought the axmachine could do with a boost given current ram prices. So I ordered a measly Gig of RAM. It arrived. It's busted. It basically reports itself as 128M of RAM, and then only if I put it in with other memory. *sigh*. So I now have to call the company I bought it from. Nuts.<br/><br/>Domain transfer (axkit.org, axkit.com, sergeant.org) is *still* not going well. I'm on the Network Solutions/Verisign Chat Support as I type this, with a guy called Matt trying to find my faxes. Needless to say they can't find them. HOW FRICKING USELESS ARE THEY!!! It's now been nearly 3 months since AxKit.org was active, and I know people are not using it or being turned off because of the downtime, and there's bugger all I can do about it. Yes, I'm very very very annoyed about this. Until you've been without email, and know you're losing potential customers and users hand over fist, and THEN had to deal with NetSol you haven't known this level of frustration :-/<br/><br/>Finally, Clinton sent me a note last night to say that he thought his tone on clp.misc was a bit off. I didn't really want to set off an avalanche of other people talking about it. I guess I need to take more care with what I put in here. [THINK HAPPY THOUGHTS... OMMMMMMMMMMM]<br/><br/>Update: NetSol is now telling me that the NIC's I have (one for each domain - don't ask) are personal, not business NICs, so I have to fax them <b>again</b> with picture ID to authorise the transfer. Check for yourself - I see "FastNet Software Ltd" on all my NICs, so I don't see how those are personal! So now I have to go home and find my passport, get a photocopy of it so I can fax it, and send them yet another 3 faxes. Bother!!!</p>
