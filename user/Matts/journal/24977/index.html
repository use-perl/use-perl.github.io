<p>This morning our fridge has decided it no longer wishes to keep things cold. Not so bad for me as I drink my coffee black, but Heather is suffering without her morning coffee.<br/><br/>So we've called our realtor to ask if she can measure the size of the fridge space in the new house, and later today we'll be out shopping for a new fridge. Bah!<br/><br/>I'm torn between a shiny stainless steel one (looks great, costs a lot) and a plain white one (does the job, costs less). We'll probably go for white because the house we're moving into isn't our dream home, and the kitchen is just average - a stainless steel fridge would probably look overkill in it.</p>

When we moved into our new house, the woman who built the place was a KitchenAide fanatic. It seemed only fitting to buy a nice KA stainless side by side.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br> <br>How about a fridge with the tv/internet screen so you can post to use.perl while you cook?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

Well we bought a side by side, but there was no way I was spending $5000 (CAD) to get the fridge with the TV!<br> <br>A whole afternoon wasted on that though<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-/

You wouldn't believe the fingerprints that will show up.

Actually we've bought the stainless one. The fingerprints I can deal with because we don't have kids<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br> <br>I've had S/S appliances before and they're easy to clean if you remember one rule: You MUST dry it with a dry paper towel after cleaning it or the streaks will look worse than the dirt did.
