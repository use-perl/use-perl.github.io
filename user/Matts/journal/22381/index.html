<div class="span8">
<p>On Friday I sent an email to our PR agency regarding some predictions for 2005. In it I said the following:
<blockquote><i>The 419 scammers will become more targeted, collecting more details 
about the recipients they send to and customising mails appropriately. 
They have the manpower to do this due to their use of cheap labour, and 
the customised messages will make people more likely to respond to 
them. This is a case where google may work against you - if your email 
address can be found in google it is likely that a spammer can find out 
more details about you.</i></blockquote>
And today I got the following 419 in my inbox:
<blockquote><i>From: 	  support@promoagency7564.org
Subject: 	Urgent letter to Sergeant Matt

The interesting thing is that there are no web pages out there linking that email address to my home address (well, I guess there's one now!). So they must be googling for the full name. That sure is a lot of effort to go to!</p>

<h2>Spam predictions overrun by events</h2>

I've just started getting spam that uses some sort of Markov chain to assemble jibberish. I wasn't aware of spam filters that use any kind of Markov analysis to defeat spammers, so either I'm behind or the spammers are getting a leg up.

Yes I have been getting this for a while.
<p>
Fortunately markov chains are so far used in subjects I already know to avoid, and if they start using markov chains in the subjects I can spot and delete them as easily.
</p><p>
yes, this is all by hand - about 400 mails a day (after trivial filters, list filters, etc)

<h2>Its from your DNS contact details</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/TeeJay/">TeeJay</a> on 2004-12-20T17:08:35</h3>
I got this same mail last night - hardly customised - it got your surname and firstname in the wrong order.
<p>
The only place it could have got my address from was DNS records. I assume you have your address in some DNS records somewhere too.
</p><p>
I guess they just munge each domain, looking for email and post addresses.. ick.

No, whois was my first thought but that's not the case.<br> <br>Note that all the details can be found separately, but they *do* require google searching to put them together.
