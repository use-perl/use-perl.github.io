<p>I'm writing this in my hotel "room" in portland, but we nearly didn't come...<br/><br/>On Friday I had the day off to prepare to come, I expected to spend the day packing, doing a few chores, and finishing my tutorial (eek!). However after mowing the lawn, doing a few outdoor chores, and lying down for a nap I woke with sore eyes.<br/><br/>The eyes got worse throughout the day, until at about 10pm I could barely keep them open, and was *incredibly* photosensitive. Every time I opened my eyes they welled up with water. So Heather called the doctor.<br/><br/>At 11pm I was in the emergency doctor's surgery. I was completely blind by this time, and Heather had to guide me like a blind man to the surgery. The doctor decided it was probably just a horrendous allergic reaction, so gave me super-strong steroids and super-strong anti-biotics. Oh, and he told me not to come to Portland.<br/><br/>So since we'd already paid ÃÂ£850 for Heather's flight, and were due to pay over ÃÂ£500 for the kennels, we said we'd see how I was on Saturday morning. Our car was picking us up at 7am (yikes!).<br/><br/>At 2am I woke up no better - couldn't see.<br/><br/>At 6am Heather woke me and I was a little better. So I said screw what the doctor said and we were going to get on that plane if it killed me.<br/><br/>After a pretty bad trip (not much room on the plane to LAX, and then a 3 hour delay in LAX) we got here, and we have a free room upgrade - I said "room" above because we've been given an apartment with dining room, kitchen, etc. It's HUGE!<br/><br/>For those who are here - see you soon!</p>
