<p>I have (compared to a lot of people I meet in this industry) a small brain. I don't have a PhD, I didn't do well in my degree, and I don't grok a lot of stuff immediately. I'm not suggesting that's in any way unusual, it's just something that's been on my mind lately.<br/><br/>I'm actually learning much more computer science stuff since graduating than I ever learned while at University. I think I was just too young while I was there - I was far more interested in sleeping late, and "spiritual growth". Now I actually find it fun learning things from the Dragon book about eliminating left recursion, and other things like that. Well OK, perhaps not fun. But at least I actually understand what I'm reading now, rather than hardly taking it all in.<br/><br/>Right now I'm trying to learn about Bayesian Probability. I seem to vaguely recall something about that at Uni, but it was over my head then. It's still over my head now - lots of maths. But hopefully I'll actually stick it out this time around.</p>

<h2>Learning outside of University</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ziggy/">ziggy</a> on 2002-04-16T14:30:42</h3>
I had the hardest time in my Numerical Methods class.  Had to repeat it, because it was much more interesting to plan six months abroad than deal with math.
<p>
Turns out that the first project on my first job out of school had to do with doing Yield-to-Price calculations on fixed rate bonds.  And that meant doing using Newton's method.  Funny thing is, until that point in time, none of that had any meaning.  Once I had an application for Newton's method, it all cleared up (and I had to explain it to my colleagues, who were still hacking around with the binomial method).
</p><p>
It also was the crux of a big boost in performance for this one piece of software; it saved <i>seconds</i> per calculation, which really started to add up when you have dozens or hundreds of bonds to reprice.</p>



<h2>Post School Learning</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/gizmo_mathboy/">gizmo_mathboy</a> on 2002-04-16T15:07:18</h3>
I sort of feel your pain. I did ok in my degree and did horrible in my stab at grad work. However, I must have picked up on that "don't stop learning" thing. I have a monstrous collection of technical texts and am always reading something (on the web or in book form).<br> <br>It does take me awhile to pick on some CS type stuff because my degree was in aerospace engineering and programming was mostly used as a took to finish an assignment as compared to being the assignment itself.<br> <br>In any case, my desire to read, continue learning, and a strong curiosity has left me with a brain full of info that I can use everyday (or not everyday since some it is rather esoteric<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)



<h2>Bayesian Probability</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/gnat/">gnat</a> on 2002-04-16T22:08:07</h3>
Yes, lots of maths.  Yes, headaches ensue.  If you're learning about it for AI/machine learning kinds of situations, I recommend Tom Mitchell's <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=tom+mitchell+machine+learning&amp;sourceid=opera&amp;num=0" title="google.com">Machine Learning</a google.com> textbook.  The easiest to understand of any, although (if you're like me) you'll still need to spend a lot of time with flashcards and note-taking to have it make sense.<p>

Orwant's got the brain I'm most envious of.  He can look at almost any math I run across and understand it.  I'm planning a brain transplant at OSCON, but don't tell him that.  I'll bring the adze and the slotted spoon if you bring the fermented grain anaesthetic<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...</p><p>

hey, cool. We can make a movie and call it Brain/Off.<br>

<h2>University and Youth</h2>

I agree with you completely. When I was an undergraduate, I had a lot of <i>growing up</i> to do, and learning maths was rarely my top priority. I think that's mostly necessary - if you look at people who were utterly devoted to their studies, most of them are curiously immature and unworldly.<p>
Recently (the past year or two) I've been getting seriously interested in logic and computer science, and studying with a ferocity that I never could muster when I was supposed to be doing it. In fact, after working as a programmer for the past five years, I'm going to do an MSc starting this autumn and planning to follow it with a PhD.
</p><p>
Learning something because you <i>want to know</i> is <b>so</b> much easier than learning something because you need to in order to pass an exam!</p>
