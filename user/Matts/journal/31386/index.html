I think this is dangerous. For a long time perl didn't make a lot of guarantees -- until the documentation was updated to detail them. But perldiag is right there detailing the error messages, and people do parse for them, every single day, because they have no other choice right now.

<p>... which is why Yves, Schwern, and myself have argued over the past few days over providing a better interface to warnings and error messages.  Parsing natural language is fragile.  There are better ways to make things unambiguous.</p>

Yeah I got around to reading most of the rest of the thread now (spent the weekend in Hospital after my wife fell on her head while ice skating, so this weekend I've had very little time to catch up on p5p). I just thought that one early post was rather dangerous thinking.

I think she'll be fine. They're keeping her in for observation right now, but I'm sure she'll be out soon.
