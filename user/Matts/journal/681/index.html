<p>No Perl here.<br/><br/>The house is still a nightmare. We stripped the wallpaper from the walls in the master b'room this weekend. It revealed large cracks and plaster falling off the walls. Nice.<br/><br/>So I tried to plaster on my lunch hour. BIG MISTAKE. Plastering is a skill. A skill that I don't own.<br/><br/>Much sanding, replastering, re-sanding later. Walls are smoothish, and ready to paint. At least *I* thought they were ready to paint. I got a call today at lunchtime - more plaster has fallen off the walls.<br/><br/>We also had a quote for removing the Artex(tm) from the ceiling in the lounge/dining room. Unfortunately it's fuxored everything, and needs an entire new ceiling. Nice. Though ÃÂ£800 doesn't seem too bad for that, it's ÃÂ£800 I'd rather spend on something else. Like the boiler that's also broken. Argh.<br/><br/>I resubbed to a bunch of mailing lists from work today, so I feel a little more connected to the outside world. I fear the long term that I'm losing AxKit.org for will have a detrimental effect on AxKit in general, and that saddens me. I wish we'd have moved over to apache.org in time (AxKit is now an official apache project), but I guess I should've expected this to happen - things never go smoothly in this world. Too many ducks to line up.<br/><br/>I wish Perl could help me with the decorating.</p>
