<p>I got all excited this morning. The UPS man came. I figured I was finally getting my copy of "XML and Perl" - the new book by Ilya Sterin and Mark Riehl. Ilya promised to get marketing to send me a copy.<br/><br/>Unfortunately no, it wasn't that book. It was instead "Processing XML with Java". Whoopie.<br/><br/>I got involved with this particular book when the author slagged off perl's XML capabilities, and it's status as a programming language in general. I just felt that didn't have a place in the book at all, but perhaps on usenet. So I ended up helping to review the book (or at least that part of it). In the end, the author barely changed what he said, but added in the foreward that we disagreed on this ;-)<br/><br/>Eek, that's now the second Java book I own.<br/><br/>In other news, I've now taken over the CDB_File module, because it had bugs in it and the author was unreachable. So I'll upload 0.92 later, and hopefully anyone who gave up on it because of memory and filehandle leaks (e.g. acme) can give it a try again.</p>
