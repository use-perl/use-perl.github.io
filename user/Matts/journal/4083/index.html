<p>I just worked out that OSCon is going to "cost" us $3000 before ents. That breaks down into:<br/><br/>Heather's flight: $800 (mine is paid for as a tutorial speaker).
Hotel: $1300 (approx)
Kennelling: $650 (3 cats and 2 dogs)
<a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/pub/w/15/see_do.html#meals">Partner meal ticket</a>: $200<br/><br/>Add evening meals and entertainments onto that and it's one heck of an expensive trip... (Of course I'm still looking forward to it).<br/><br/>O'Reilly are paying $1000 per tutorial. So it's not all doom and gloom (except that appears to have changed from a few weeks ago when it was $1500) for me. However I can't imagine not giving tutorials and thinking of going...</p>

One thing that has started becoming popular (or maybe it always was and I didn't know about it) around here is petsitting.  Leave your pets at home and hire someone to stop by however often you need to feed them and even play with them for about 1/2 hour a visit.  Clean the litterbox if necessary.
<p>
For us, it was much, much cheaper, though we just had one cat.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

or trade off with a buddy.<br> <br>We pet sit for our friends, and they do the same for us. No money involved<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)<br> <br>-matt<br>

Should only ever have been advertised this year at $1000.  If you saw it somewhere at $1500, I will spank whoever posted that<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<p>

It's not easy kicking your own ass, but if you do it covered in baby oil wearing a black leather corset and a ball gag while being spanked by a dozen cheerleaders in crotchless nun costumes, it's actually rather fun.<p>

nun!" responses)</p>
