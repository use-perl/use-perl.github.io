<p>First day back at work today. Clearing the email backlog (which isn't too bad - not like a mid-year holiday) and getting up to speed again.<br/><br/>The last few days of the holiday I started working on take23.org again. I feel really bad about letting this site go, so I want to make sure that when it comes back that it looks after itself. That to me implies user comments, and making it trivial to author news items and articles.<br/><br/>The current system is a hacked together CMS that uses XML and files stored directly in the filesystem. It works OK but nobody likes to write stuff directly in XML. So the new system will use the Wiki code from the AxKit CMS to support writing articles in POD (most article submissions were in POD anyway).<br/><br/>On top of that I'm writing a generic user comments package, so that for any given URL a "Add Comment" link can be created, and as long as you're logged in (the package includes all the usual user management code) then you can comment on that URL (in POD, WikiText or sDocBook). Comments are threaded. But I'm not about to go and create a slash-like moderation system.<br/><br/>All in all I think it'll be a pretty neat site for mod_perl users to read news and articles. The only thing to do after it's all together is make sure that I get some good people signed up to help create site content.</p>

You're really doing something that Moveable Type does well. It maintains editable stories, takes comments, and spits out flat files.<p>
I'm currently working with MT that spits out XML, using templates I created, and XSLT that I wrote to turn it into XHTML 1.1, in the long run I'll be adding stylesheets for RDF/RSS/etc.</p>

None of this is integrated into AxKit though. If I do it my way I get to help the AxKit community.
