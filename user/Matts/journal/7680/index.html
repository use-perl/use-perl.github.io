<p>The screen on my iBook has a loose connection. At certain angles it will flicker until I move it.<br/><br/>I hope I don't have to send it back, since it's a US iBook - I bet I have trouble sending it to a UK repair centre if I have to. :-(<br/><br/>Anyone else had trouble? I open and close my iBook about 4 or 5 times a day, so I guess it gets a lot more abuse than most. But the hinge looks sturdy and I expected better.</p>

The screen on my ibook died after just under a year of use. I put it to sleep one day, and when I opened it back up, it woke up, but the screen stayed black. When I shone a light through the apple at the back, you could see something on the screen, so it was obviously the backlight that had died, but the lcd was fine.<br> <br>I took it to the reseller (in Australia) I bought it from to get it fixed. In the end, it took seven weeks for them to fix, and I think they basically replaced everything in it except the keyboard and the hard-drive. The last repair guy I spoke to told me that after replacing the screen, the logic board, and a few other things, they finally figured out that one of the cables to the screen (presumably the backlight) was dead/loose, so they replaced it, and the problem was magically fixed.<br> <br>I doubt there is much difference between a UK and US iBook, other than the power adaptor, and maybe the DVD drive.

You're right - it's the backlight. The screen is there, it's just not lit up...<br> <br>Damn. Now to get onto Apple to see what can be done.
