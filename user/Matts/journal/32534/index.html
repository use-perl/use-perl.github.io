<p>So today I changed my default web browser from Safari to Firefox. I finally got fed up of the (now well documented) Safari slowdowns.<br/><br/>I will really miss some of the nicer features (mostly the RSS reader, but also better rendering of most things), but I think I'll get over it.</p>

I have yet to seem them. I might go Camino though.

Ah, I read up on it and I rarely do some of the "culprit" items.

Anything involving flash seems to do it for me - even if I close the used tabs.

<p><div class="quote">Anything involving flash seems to do it for me - even if I close the used tabs.</div> Yup, flash seems to be the killer when you have multiple tabs open. Camino b1 has a flash blocker and I am sure FF has the same thing.

At least the guy who is on the Safari team knows about it and so it might get fixed "quickly".



<h2>Re:Slowdowns?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/thisisbradley/">thisisbradley</a> on 2007-03-02T15:39:36</h3>
The documented "performance issues" are already fixed - you can install the latest WebKit build (the browser engine behind Safari) from  <a href="http://nightly.webkit.org/" title="webkit.org">http://nightly.webkit.org/</a webkit.org> and watch your performance skyrocket<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;) <p>

(The guys who wrote the safari performance article re-ran their tests against the WebKit nightly and updated their article to note that the performance was better or equal to FF)

Cheers,

<h2>cocoa &quot;emacs&quot; key bindings?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/merlyn/">merlyn</a> on 2007-03-03T04:50:14</h3>
I continue to use Safari because it has two things Firefox doesn't:
<ul> <li>Cocoa key bindings</li>
<li>The Services menu</li>
</ul>
Until Firefox gets those (say "never"), I can't give those up.  How are you doing without those?

There are still two things driving me nuts right now (obviously I don't have exactly the same usage patterns as you do, but mine are personal to me):<br><br>1) Firefox doesn't use OS-X widgets. This affects me in one critical way - double clicking on an IP address does not highlight the whole IP. This works in every other OS-X application, and I use this about 200 times a day. This is pushing me back towards Safari in a big way.<br><br>2) The RSS reader. Safari's is sweet. I like the fact that it's nicely integrated into my toolbar bookmarks, and tells me when there's "new stuff" for me to read. I just saw that there's a Dashboard thingy for google reader bookmarks, but I tend to rarely use Dashboard, so I'm not sure that would solve it.<br><br>There are other subtle GUI issues, but overall I'm OK with firefox for now.<br><br>What I don't want to do is end up having to pay for Leopard just to get a faster browser.<br><br>PS: Great news on your Expungement (ok so there's no such word, but you know what I mean). It's about bloody time. Hope to see you up in Canada soon.
