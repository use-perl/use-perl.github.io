<p>$mates{"Greg Tod"}++; # G'day<br/><br/>Last night I got taken out to dinner by someone who read I was stuck in a B&B in Gloucester this week. Greg is a really nice Aussie who bought me dinner and a few beers in exchange for Perl-XML war stories. Hope I didn't bore him too much. It seems not as he even thanked me in email this morning!<br/><br/>If anyone else wants to buy me dinner, my diary is open! :-)<br/><br/>So, the guy who lived in the house we're buying here in Gloucester did kill himself (which we knew), and it he did it by cutting his wrists open (which we didn't know), and he did it in the 3rd bedroom, which is to be my office (which we kinda suspected due to the suspicious nature that room was presented in). Neither of us is really looking forward to this move now, and we're also running out of money, as the complete bastards at Oxford Uni expect Heather to pay ÃÂ£1800 college fee, even though she's living out of college. No wonder Oxford is so damn rich! There goes the bathroom (the house needs *everything* re done).<br/><br/>Drive home tonight. Miss my wife and my pets. I look forward to being jumped on by <a href="http://home.sergeant.org/Pets_and_Home/DSC00004.JPG?size=half" >Shelby</a> and <a href="http://home.sergeant.org/Pets_and_Home/DSC00005.JPG?size=half" >Murphy</a>.<br/><br/>I really want to get together an SDK bundle for Perl and XML, but things aren't quite there yet... I want all the stuff to work together using SAX, but it doesn't yet.<br/><br/>DOM interop was a dream that will never work. Actually it will work, but only on Java. Strange that. The reason is that you can't pass an XML::DOM tree to XML::LibXML functions and expect it to work, because XML::LibXML works in C-space. You can do that in Java because it's all one BOM (Binary Object Model), and all the base classes are the same. Doesn't work with Perl. Or Python. Or ... I'm not sure if it would work with C++. It might, provided the base classes were the same.<br/><br/>I keep dreaming up sources for SAX generators. How about a filesystem generator for SAX events? Then I could really easily build a system like Randal Schwartz's Stonehenge::Photo for doing my online photo album, but in AxKit so I can easily re-style it using XSLT. And how about a Win32 registry SAX generator? Or an INI file SAX generator? Lots of neato ideas. No time to do them.<br/><br/>I also want to get XML.pm working, but I think there are a few blocks in it's way yet. See the perl-xml list archives for details, but basically it would be a way to request a DOM or SAX implementation, and have it just find the right one on your system. But the blocks are that the implementations aren't compatible as yet. e.g. XML::DOM and XML::LibXML and XML::Sablotron::DOM all use different function calls for parsing stuff. That needs to be fixed I guess. And SAX generators are free to use different function calls too.<br/><br/>I'm burning CDs for .NET at the moment. Microsoft in all their wisdom had .NET beta 2 expire at the end of last month (only the UK version mind, all other versions still work). In further wisdom they decided that you couldn't just download a patch to fix that - you had to re-download all 4 CDs again. Not fun. I hate Microsoft more and more. I think work here knows that, as I came into work today to find a large "Microsoft Certified Solutions Provider" banner draped over my computer. No comment.</p>
