<p>This week's "I, Cringely" talks about <a href="http://www.pbs.org/cringely/pulpit/pulpit20030327.html">TiVo</a> and how it's changing television. His conclusion: More reality TV shows because they're cheap to make.<br/><br/>AAAARRGGHHH!!! I think if that happens I'll rip my satellite dish out of the wall and stick to DVDs.<br/><br/>Went out to dinner with Cringely on Friday night (picture the scene - Cringely, Heather and myself at a small french restaurant in Cheltenham - you can imagine the grilling he got from Heather about the name-change thing ;-). The night was mostly uneventful. The most interesting comment of the whole Cringely visit was that Palladium and TCPA or whatever it's called today is all about entrenchment - the computer manufacturers want to become irreplacible, and TCPA gives them irreplacibility. The other side of that is that TCPA doesn't benefit the consumer one tiny little bit. Scary thought.</p>

Why wait?
<p>
Broadcast TV (and cable for that matter) is primarily a vehicle for transmitting news (stock up on bread and milk -- there's a snow storm coming; a senior Al Qaeda planner has been arrested), watching sports (GOOOOOOOOOOOAL!), and previewing original productions that you want to view on DVD.
</p><p>
(The Simsons on DVD is simply fantastic -- the color and clarity is stunningly gorgeous.)</p>

<p>I am all for the TV-on-DVD revolution, but as far as I know, my shows aren't there yet.  My list includes Smallville, the District, and Gilmore Girls.  For the time being I am actually attempting to completely tape two of those series.  I was doing the same for Sailor Moon before I found it on DVD and was awakened to the possibilities.</p>

<p>It's so nice to be able to pop in a show to watch in the evenings when there is <i>nothing</i> on anymore (all my favorite syndicated shows are gone and the 6 to 9 timeframe is a wasteland), plus skip the commercials.</p>

<p>As for news, I get that on the Internet, and as for sports, I never care unless it's the Olympics.  Keeping news.google.com and the Drudge report up in Phoenix tabs probably makes me one of the most informed people in this city.</p>
