<h2>what is refactoring</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/pault12/">pault12</a> on 2002-12-04T21:05:24</h3>
<p>In my universe, refactoring simply means eliminate as much copy&amp;paste as possible.</p>

<p>Usually that would result in actually rewriting a lot of 'broken' things. Of course, one may  always put an API layer around some crappy component, but to me that is orthogonal to refactoring.</p>

<p>
Or, more accurately - placing a nice API around some crappy componenet - that is not an essence of refactoring.
</p>

<p>
Eleminating copy &amp; paste - <b>that</b> is an essence of refactoring.

<h2>Cut 'n' paste is only part ofit</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/autarch/">autarch</a> on 2002-12-04T21:31:37</h3>
Eliminating redundant code is certainly one major goal of refactoring.  But it's also just about improving the readability and _design_ of the code on an ongoing basis.  For example, in the Refactoring book, Fowler talks about a refactoring called "rename method".  This is exactly what it sounds like.<br> <br>This won't eliminate any cut and paste, but if you have a misnamed method (or variable, or whatever) then renaming it can certainly improve code readability.



<h2>Unfinished Business</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jonasbn/">jonasbn</a> on 2002-12-07T10:59:48</h3>
DO NOT GO INTO THE BATHROOM  would imply an unfinished refactoring, but only in the eyes of the last refactorer.<br> <br>The problems are in my opinion really:<br>
&nbsp; - when to stop refactoring<br>
&nbsp; - when is code finished<br> <br>Postulating that code never is finished would imply refactoring can never be called complete and therefore refactoring is a tool to 'make the best of it for now'.<br> <br>My kitchen table is not fastened to the element beneath it, I can still cook and do the dishes, but I would not recommend having several people running around my kitchen at the same time cooking for many people.<br> <br>If code can obtained a state of being finished, then a refatoring can take place to make the code readable, fast, reliable and compliant with whatever standards it has to follow. Only a an addition rewriting etc. would legalise yet another refactoring.<br> <br>So if a refactoring is simply a 'curly-braces' removing then don't.
