<p>Apparently our sysadmins managed to track the DoSer to the company where he was originating the attacks from. The company immediately suspended him, and now we're strongly considering legal action.<br/><br/>Think we should do it, or will it be more likely to bring on harder-core DoSers who know how to hide themselves better?</p>

<h2>Wow</h2>

Holy crap!  You mean it wasn't some script kiddie?  Jeesh.
<p>
As for legal action, it depends on how much you think you've been hurt.  My initial inclination is to say yes, though it's too bad you can't go after the individual (or can you?).  The company will probably settle anyway.</p>

We would go after the individual, not the company. Anything else would be stupid I think.

...what you should do, but I don't think that you should let the threat of retaliation affect your decision.



<h2>DoS</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/TorgoX/">TorgoX</a> on 2002-03-20T19:31:35</h3>
Why where they DoSing you?  For fun?  Or "that'll teach them a lesson"?
<p>I say kill 'em all!</p>

We're an ISP. They were mailbombing a customer of ours (bouncing spam back to them through open relays). Apparently either a disgruntled ex-employee, or someone who got burned by them in one way or another. I don't have all the details sadly.<br> <br>Mostly I say "send out a message". I mean, what he was doing was illegal. But then again, I can't see the courts coming down too hard on him - the damages were a few hours work for a few people every time he launched an attack (which he did quite a few times). In all probably a few thousand pounds. I see far more heinous crimes being committed in the world.

... but I think yes, you should prosecute the individual.  I really would hate to do it myself, but I really think threat of serious action is the only thing that stops them sometimes.  So, someone needs to be the example for everyone else.

I have to agree.  There are lots of script kiddies out there who think it's fun to waste time, money and resources by performing DoS attacks.  As long as they feel they can act childishly without consequences, this behavior will continue.

Does that rhyme with "tosser"?<br/><br/>I think the world ought to know.
