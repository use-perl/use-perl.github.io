<p>A lot has been said about the london bombings, so I won't repeat all that here, except to say that <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4671577.stm">this article</a> is probably the best piece of writing I have seen on the subject.<br/><br/>My one main observation has been that those most angry about the bombings seem to be those who do not live in London (or even the UK for that matter). I urge all those people to read the above article.</p>

<p>Maybe what people outside the UK don't realise is that <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4661753.stm" title="bbc.co.uk">bombing London is nothing new.</a bbc.co.uk> And even that list is incomplete, as it misses out <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/1056797.stm" title="bbc.co.uk">dissident replican bombs since the provisional IRA restarted its ceasefire</a bbc.co.uk> (Scroll to the bottom for the London bombings). (And yes, note, <b>ceasefire</b>, a ceasefire that has been broken without warning before). Until last Thursday it was <b>less than 4 years since the previous bomb in London</b>. Sure, this lot are nastier (no warnings, all out attempt to kill as many people as possible), but Londoners are used to this sort of shit, and just deal with it. For example, the driver of the bus that blew up is <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/4666265.stm" title="bbc.co.uk">"not going to be intimidated" and has vowed to continue working</a bbc.co.uk>. The only differences this morning from last Monday were police standing at the station, and a lot of billboards with newspaper headlines about the bombing. That's all. London has been around for 2000 years, and it will still be here, obdurate as ever, long after the latest wave of attackers give up and go home.</p>

<p>Also interesting are <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4670099.stm" title="bbc.co.uk">this, well, blog from a woman on the carriage that was bombed south of King's Cross</a bbc.co.uk>, and a <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/4672195.stm" title="bbc.co.uk">summary of various blogs' reactions</a bbc.co.uk> </p>

London has been around <i>much</i> longer than that, geologically speaking.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)
<p>
It's just that the violence in London comes in waves, starting(?) with the Romans <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_invasion_of_Britain" title="wikipedia.org">~2000 years ago</a wikipedia.org>.  At least the great fire and the Blitz are all in the past.  This, too, shall pass.
</p><p>
At the end of the day, remember that there may have been a bomb or two, but at least the <a href="http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0289043/" title="imdb.com">zombie invasion</a imdb.com> hasn't started.  (Yet.)</p>
