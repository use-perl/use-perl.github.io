<p>I'm sick. I hate being sick. There's simply nothing worse IMHO. Just a cold, but there's probably not much worse than a cold - you're not sick enough to be bed-ridden, yet you feel crappy, achy, and your nose produces more fluids than you can consume. Yuck. OK, I'm whining. My mother has breast cancer fer chrisake - that's definitely worse. Shutup, Matt.<br/><br/>To top that off this week's task at work (well, at home today feeling sorry for myself) is to re-architect our Skeptic anti-virus code. It's 16,000 lines of Perl 4. Luckily it uses strict, otherwise I think I would have quit already. It didn't however compile cleanly under -w, so first I went through and fixed all those issues. Now I have to pull the code apart into modules.<br/><br/>The painful thing is I've done this once already. But it failed when it went live, because the original author decided he didn't like my <tt>for (@ARGV)</tt> and changed it to <tt>while (shift @ARGV)</tt>, thus terminating the loop when it saw a zero on the command line. Of course one of the parameters in "live" is almost always zero, causing a barforama. ARGH! Why do people have to touch my code!... This time I'm going to use GetOpt::Std, and he can shove his custom param parsing code :-) So after pulling the release, Alex (the Perl 4 coder) decided to continue coding his old code, instead of the re-architected code. So he sent me a copy last week, so I could merge in the changes again after about 2 months of me working on different things. I got a 20,000 line diff. Nightmare. So I decided rather than try and merge that amount of code, I'd be better off starting again from scratch. Oh what I wouldn't do for a refactoring editor for Perl ;-)<br/><br/>The good news is my shelves are back up. I used 4 inch frame fixings this time, instead of the widdly little 1 inch wallplugs I used last time. Should hold the thing up methinks, even against the mighty weight of Tipler's "Physics". Sadly my desk is still a disaster area. I need to get some tuits together to tidy it.</p>

Kill him now. Quickly, before he breeds.<br> <br>Well, I'm sort of working on (and mostly off) a perl refactoring engine, but I doubt very much that anything I come up with is going to work well with perl 4 type code.

Well I've got it working under -w now. So the refactoring begins. I was kinda hoping you'd say "The refactoring browser is now working!", but then I'd be way too lucky, and that shit never happens to me<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)<br> <br>As for killing him, I would but anti-virus experts are impossible to find, let alone hire... I'll have to train him in the art instead<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

Hmm... Kill him. Kill him now. But if you can't manage that, teach him.<br> <br>I think I like the sound of that.

<p>
If someone could get myself, Piers, you, Rafael, Simon, and Ziggy in one room to concentrate on it for a week, we could cross several Rubicons.  Schwern could get us sandwiches.

&lt;/optimism&gt;

You mean like a hackathon?  I wonder <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/os2002/" title="oreillynet.com">where</a oreillynet.com> we could get together for one whole week?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)
