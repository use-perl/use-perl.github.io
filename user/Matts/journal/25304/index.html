<p>The other night we watched the movie <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0362269/">Kinsey</a>. Apart from being a well constructed movie with some great acting, I found it's portrayal of the deeper questions fascinating.<br/><br/>Kinsey blew the lid off American sexual politics in the late 1940s-50s. But the movie alledges he was also a sexual experimenter himself. This I didn't know (and it may well have been artistic license).<br/><br/>The movie asked the question: Should it be OK to have extra marital sex - it's purely physical after all, and the only thing that really stops us is social etiquette. While the middle part of the movie seemed to suggest that all this was OK (and I think this disturbed my wife a bit), towards the end of the movie it became clear that this messing around was seriously affecting their relationships. It seems humans are much more complex beings than Dr Kinsey imagined them to be after all.<br/><br/>Overall the movie seemed to conclude that social etiquette is there for a reason - so that people don't get hurt. And I thought that was an excellent point to get across in the film.<br/><br/>Well worth the rental fee.</p>
