<p>Happy new year everyone!<br/><br/>An update on our move to Canada:<br/><br/>On Christmas eve we sold our TV and Fridge. That made for a strange Christmas - not that there's anything good on the TV anyway, but it helps you fall asleep after a big Christmas dinner. With no fridge all the leftovers had to go into the dogs :-)<br/><br/>This week has been absolutely crazy here - Heather's friend Ali turned up on Tuesday to basically say her goodbyes and help out a bit with the preparations. On Wednesday morning (after a drunken night with Ali) at 8:30am a big Pickfords van arrived outside the house to do all the packing. I think they were in a bit of shock when they saw the house at how disorganised we are.<br/><br/>On Wednesday lunchtime my mum and her husband arrived from York to stay a few days to say their goodbyes. Everything kind of went a bit mad there with 7 people in the house and trying to sort out what the packers should be packing and what they should be leaving.<br/><br/>Our life is now mostly packed into boxes and wrapped in bubble wrap, ready to go into a 20ft shipping container. I still don't believe it will all fit :-)<br/><br/>I've now booked the transit van to take us to the airport, and I have commandeered the help of my friend Jon from work to drive us there.<br/><br/>It's all starting to feel very real now, and saying goodbye to my mum at the railway station on the 31st was really tough. Everyone has now left - Ali took the last of our plants away this morning (can't take any with us), along with a bunch of things to take to her local charity shop.<br/><br/>I may not get chance to write again. No idea what's happening to my servers yet - I was supposed to get that sorted before Christmas. I've dropped the TTLs on my domains to 3600 now though so I can hopefully switch things over at the last minute.<br/><br/>Best wishes for 2005 everyone, and see you all on the other side!</p>

Glad to hear things are moving along, and I hope the last bit isn't too stressful.  Give a shout when things stabalize a little bit on this end. I'm sure that kw.pm would be happy to give you a very warm welcome.  Might even be unseasonably warm for this time of year when you get here- supposed to be above freezing for a while.
