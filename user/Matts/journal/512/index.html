<p>Last day of the conference today.<br/><br/>Had all sorts of interesting conversations yesterday. All the Apache guys are really keen to get AxKit incorporated into the ASF. They've been offering any help that I need to get things going there. These guys rock.<br/><br/>We had a Web Client libraries BoF, in which Gisle Aas showed some slides about all the different options for HTTP requests, including LWP and HTTP::GHTTP. He showed some benchmark results at the end where HTTP::GHTTP came out significantly worse than all the other options (12s vs 1.5s for 50 requests). We aren't really sure what's wrong - ghttp should be much faster, and we did some straces which showed that ghttp is slowed down by doing multiple read() calls, and there's some kernel level slowdown there. Oddness.<br/><br/>I also spoke to Graham Barr, who would like me to run with the idea I had for converting Error.pm to a source filter so that you can get around the closures issue. So I've been looking at the source code for Switch.pm, which is kinda scary, I need to talk to Damian Conway to get it figured out, I think.<br/><br/>Later today I have a Guru session, where I sit in a room and can be pestered about XML or AxKit issues. Should be fun if anyone turns up :-)<br/><br/>Then finally we have the Lightning talks. Should be fun. I'm going to do a couple of slides on Attribute::WebService just in case Dominus can fit me in (I only need 30secs, not 5 mins).</p>
