<div class="span8">
<p>This week I'm trying to learn objective C. It's quite a nice language, with reference counted garbage collection (albeit manual reference counting), and fairly loose typing (compared to C++ or Java that is).<br/><br/>The syntax is rather strange though. I think that's the most offputting thing about the language. To call a method on an object, it looks something like:
<pre>
[myobject method]
</pre>
But then if there's a parameter to go into the method, it has a colon in it:
<pre>
[myobject doSomethingWith:anotherobj]
</pre>
It's also got some named parameters stuff, so you can have:
<pre>
[foo insertObject:bar atIndex:5]
</pre>
Note that the first parameter is <code>bar</code>, but it's almost not a named parameter. This is interesting because I use this kind of call style in Perl a lot, where I'd do:
<pre>
$self->method($param, %options);
</pre>
Which seems to be pretty much the same thing, except Objective-C has it built into the language, and comes with parameter checking.<br/><br/>Anyway, I'll post more as I code up more interesting things.</p>

<h2>It's a direct lift from Smalltalk</h2>

Smalltalk:<br> <code> <br>anArray insert: anObject at: 5<br> </code> <br>Objectionable C:<br> <code> <br>[array insertObject: object at: 5]<br> </code> <br>Quite cute really. Makes it a lot easier to use simple type suggesting variable names 'cos they're not having to do double duty to describe what they're for as well as what they are.

I don't understand your final point about variable names. Could you expand on it?<br> <br>Someone once suggested to me it was nice that Obj-C was nice because it showed you very clearly what parts were method calls, and what parts were just regular C code. I'm not sold on that yet, as I don't really have a problem with that in other languages. But my mind is open on it, and the OS X tools are nice enough that it won't sway me either way.

Consider a Smalltalk method declaration<blockquote><div> <tt>OrderedCollection at: anInteger put: anObject</tt> </div></blockquote>The method selector tells you what each argument is <em>for</em>, the parameter name tells you what it <em>is</em>. Actually, good Smalltalk style is to only use type suggesting variable names for method argument names. The method body that I lifted the above from, for instance, continues:<blockquote><div> <tt>&nbsp; | index |<br>&nbsp; index<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:= anInteger asInteger.</tt> </div></blockquote> <code>| index |</code> is Smalltalk for <code>my $index</code>. Note that there's an assumption in the implementation that the first argument won't necessarily be an integer; the name of the variable simply implies that it will be treated as an integer.<br> <br>There's a better discussion of Type Suggesting and Role Suggesting variables in Kent Beck's <i>Smalltalk Best Practice Patterns</i>, a book I never seem to stop recommending; even if you don't do Smalltalk, it's full of good stuff for anyone who does OO programming in a dynamic language. It's warped my brain to the extent I keep finding myself writing <code>variableNamesLikeThis</code>, which would be okay for private stuff, but runs counter to perlstyle for stuff I might want to release.
