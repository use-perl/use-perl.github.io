<p>Python has a good games API. Java has fairly decent 2D gfx stuff. C# has good infrastructure for writing games.<br/><br/>What happened, Perl?<br/><br/>I was thinking about this while out with the dogs this morning (where I do most of my deeper thinking). It's been years since I collaborated on a really fun project <em>just for fun</em>. AxKit is fun, for example, but in a more geeky way, and I wrote it initially to scratch an itch.<br/><br/>When I was in school, a bunch of Amiga-using friends and I got together to write a game. We started off using AMOS (a basic variant) and one of the guys used Deluxe Paint to do the space-ship designs (he was a shit-hot artist, and the gfx were *amazing*). It was a lot of fun getting together at the weekend to hack on it, and see how far the others had gotten on things.<br/><br/>We never finished it - I think Kick-Off 2 came along, and that was the death of the project (and the death of a few joysticks!). But it was serious fun. And I miss that. I miss writing games.<br/><br/>Maybe it's time to have a look at the Python games APIs and see what we can steal.</p>

<p>Check out <a href="http://www.frozen-bubble.org/" title="frozen-bubble.org">Frozen Bubble</a frozen-bubble.org> is a really nice game written in perl, with help from the <a href="http://sdlperl.org/" title="sdlperl.org">perlSDL</a sdlperl.org> library.</p>



<h2>SDL</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jjohn/">jjohn</a> on 2002-03-20T16:20:57</h3>
<a href="http://www.libsdl.org/" title="libsdl.org">This</a libsdl.org> is a "direct" access video/audio library for Linux. Supposedly, there are Perl bindings in the works.



<h2>SDL seems to be it.</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Matts/">Matts</a> on 2002-03-20T16:56:25</h3>
There's a Perl SDL module. Looks like I'm gonna have to go play with this for a bit. Screw XML for a while<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)
