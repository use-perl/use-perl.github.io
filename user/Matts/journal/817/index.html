<p>This economy sucks. I hear about more and more people being laid off, and some excellent people I know who just can't find work.<br/><br/>My good friend Kip Hampton, for example, writes the Perl and XML column for XML.com. He knows more breadth of subject about Perl and XML than anyone I know. Yet he hasn't been able to find work for months. If you're a company looking for someone like him in Boston, talk to him.<br/><br/>I know Kip reads my journal (Hi Kip!), so I hope he's not offended by this. I'm just really pissed at this economy. Before the whole dot-com boom these people (I know of several in similar situations) would have been happily working on various tech projects, not necessarily web related. I even know of a few IT departments who need more staff, but HR has a hiring freeze on, so they can't do anything about it. That sucks.<br/><br/>House-wise we have a new kitchen going in this week (yay!), which puts us in a bit of a sticky situation regarding how to function during the week without a kitchen (boo!). But there's a really good Chinese take away up the road (yay!) and some good Pizza places around (yay!). I'm going to get fatter this week :-/ Finally got the insides of the wardrobes built in the master b'room (b::room?), so we can get some clothes hung up. Really feel like we're starting to have a home again now.</p>
