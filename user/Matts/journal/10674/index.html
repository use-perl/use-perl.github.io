<p>This rant is inspired by me just looking at the source code for Text::Tiki, but I certainly don't intend to single that parser out...<br/><br/>Why is it that wikitext [1] parser writers foist upon us broken crappy regexp based parsers that break at the slightest deviation from the spec, don't treat the document as a structure and truly believe that they are just parsing "text" and only need to produce "text". What if I don't want to produce HTML but actually want to *do* something with that data?<br/><br/>Repeat after me: "s///g is not a parser!"<br/><br/>Some day I'm going to find time to finish off Text::WikiFormat::SAX and show people what its all about.<br/><br/>Rant over.<br/><br/>[1] And this includes WikiText, TikiText, UseModText and all the various flavours that I've had the misfortune to look at the source code of.</p>

<p>Must admit to being an idiot in that it took me quite a while to figure out what thingy to click to reply to this.</p>

<p>We talked about this on IRC and I agreed with you.  I went and looked at HTML::Parser, which I think we figured out was a good model for what we want to be able to do with WikiText. It's all in XS, so I ran away.  Bad move?  Me no spik C.</p>

<h2>Better Alternatives???</h2>

Have you looked at the source for TWiki??  Its regexp based as well.<br/><br/>I realize that regexp based parsing/expanding is a primitive mechanism and painfully slow at times.  However, its also pretty darn powerful as well.<br/><br/>Im interested in your thoughts on how to make a better parser/renderer for something like TWiki a reality.<br/><br/>--John Cavanaugh

Powerful? Sure, in that it can do a lot. No, in that it doesn't help the software understand the structure of the data at all. Regex is a very limited language.

<h3><a href="/user/Matts/">Matts</a> on 2003-02-20T08:35:25</h3>
The problem with Twiki's parser (and all the other ones) is they all look something like this:<blockquote><div> <tt>&nbsp; $text =~ s/someformatting1/&lt;somehtml1&gt;$1&lt;\/somehtml1&gt;/;<br>&nbsp; $text =~ s/someformatting2/&lt;somehtml2&gt;$1&lt;\/somehtml2&gt;/;<br>&nbsp; $text =~ s/someformatting3/&lt;somehtml3&gt;$1&lt;\/somehtml3&gt;/;<br>&nbsp; $text =~ s/someformatting4/&lt;somehtml4&gt;$1&lt;\/somehtml4&gt;/;<br>&nbsp; $text =~ s/someformatting5/&lt;somehtml5&gt;$1&lt;\/somehtml5&gt;/;</tt> </div></blockquote>Which is great if you want HTML, but what if you want to parse the twiki text to put the data into a semantic search engine (where titles or bold text might have more relevance) - you have to parse once to HTML and then parse the HTML, and that I think is a broken model.<br> <br>The parsers should be written as frontend+backend - where the frontend basically tokenises the Wiki text and the (default) backend turns those tokens into HTML. But another backend might do something completely different.<br> <br>The model I'm talking about is that used by Text::WikiFormat::SAX, but people are very afraid of proper parsers (witness how long it took people to adopt to using HTML::Parser instead of regexp based parsers), because they mean you have to think of your source as data rather than text. Plus Text::WikiFormat::SAX is broken, mostly because nobody uses it so I have no incentive to fix it<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)

<h2>Three Reasons</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/chromatic/">chromatic</a> on 2003-02-20T02:05:47</h3>
<ul>
<li>Writing a proper parser is hard</li>
<li>We're not as smart as you are</li>
<li>A terrible regex implementation that gets the job done pretty well today is a heckofalot better than a beautiful, perfect event-based parser that isn't here yet</li>
</ul>

<p>
I'm only about halfway kidding.

I agree with all your points but the second one<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)<br> <br>Since Text::WikiFormat::SAX doesn't work properly I'm obviously not as smart as you think I am<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)<br> <br>But in all seriousness this is something I hope to put right, in a similar way to trying to put right the whole XML parser nonesense. That way I can put my code where my rant is, or something like that.

<h2>and they use different regexes!</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/kellan/">kellan</a> on 2003-02-20T03:50:35</h3>
I might almost forgive them if they implemented the same regex, but each person implementing a different  regex based "mini-language" is the worst.<br> <br>Maybe its not too late to get gnat to include recipes on using Parse::Yapp, and Parse::RecDescent in the next cookbook.
