<p>CPAN ratings is nice. I like this feature.<br/><br/>However they round badly IMHO. If you have one vote less than 5 it becomes impossible to have a full 5 stars on your module page on <a href="http://search.cpan.org/">search.cpan.org</a>.<br/><br/>For example, DBD::SQLite has 5 votes. 4 of which are 5 stars, and one is 4 stars. That should result in 4.8, which should be rounded to 5.<br/><br/>But it gets rounded down to a 4.5.<br/><br/>Of course it may just be too much pride that is making me think this.</p>

<p>Not having built it nor looked at other ratings, maybe they just made a conscious deciscion to round that way?

</p><p>I would prefer the 4.8 though. The reason being is there really is a difference in a 4.5 and a 4.8 rating.</p>

All I really mean is that with the current setup I would guess that even with 4.99, you'd still have four and a half stars, which doesn't feel quite right.

But the four-and-a-half stars really means exactly that: almost a 5. Is the module really that perfect?<br> <br>In all honesty, I wouldn't expect to get a perfect five for more of my in-depth modules. I figure that I've probably left something out or there's something I could have worked out better.<br> <br>And lastly, be thankful that your record hasn't been marred with a 1- or 0-star rating because someone should have been using rt.cpan.org instead<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

I'm trying to leave personal feelings about the particular module out of this. I'm not suggesting DBD::SQLite is perfect.<br> <br>What I'm asking about is the fact that the only way to get 5 stars is to have NOBODY give you 4 stars. Even if you had 100 votes at 5/5, 1 down vote would skew you down, which doesn't quite feel right.
