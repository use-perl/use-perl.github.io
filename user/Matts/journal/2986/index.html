<p>Wowsers, I just counted my CPAN modules, and I have 46 different distributions in my CPAN directory. I never knew I had uploaded so much [*]. Of course I can't take all the credit - a few of them are written by other people that I offered CPAN space before that person had a PAUSEID (mostly AxKit modules by <a href="/user/kingubu">Kip</a> and <a href="/user/darobin">Robin</a>), but still, that's an awful lot of modules. I guess I should delete some that aren't really relevant any more, but I don't <em>want</em> to reduce my module count. Hey I have more modules than Dr Conway ;-)<br/><br/>[*] no, I know it's not a competition, and I have plenty of crap in there, I was just surprised when I did the count.</p>

Are these different distributions entirely, or multiple versions of the same distributions?

Heh, I have 46 distributions too (including different versions of the same things)!  Whoa, a tie<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...

Different distributions. Counting multiple versions is cheating<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)

Pah.<br> <br>Well, I have well over 30, I think.  Many of them are binary distributions of other people's modules, and some are MacPerl dists, Newton versions of the docs, utlities, etc.  Maybe half are actual module distributions.

<h2>Does that count Time::Piece?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jdavidb/">jdavidb</a> on 2002-02-21T18:10:34</h3>
<p>And anything else you might have done that's gone into the core?</p>

<p>Time::Piece is my favorite, even though you're known for the XML stuff.</p>

Time::Piece is not in the core.  jhi decided not to include it.

<p>Oops.  Did I just expose the fact that I don't keep up?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<p>I knew Larry had pretty much decided not to include anything in the core so administrators would realize they are supposed to install modules.  So I knew it would be going away eventually, anyway.</p>

As pudge said, it's no longer in the core, which is a shame because it reduced most of the time/date FAQ's to just "see L&lt;Time::Piece&gt;"<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br> <br>I don't disagree with the decision though, and I got some free Jarkko hacking out of it<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-) But I do think if we're going to exclude things from core then module installation needs to be a little easier for some people (and that's a route I'd rather go down than including gob loads of XML modules in core).
