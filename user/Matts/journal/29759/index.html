<p>After the mosquito problem (which is now in full throws with the current 34ÃÂºC weather) there's yet another bug problem at the Sergeant household.<br/><br/><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpenter_bee">Carpenter Bees</a>.<br/><br/>They've decided that the framing above our deck is the perfect place to live. So far there are only 3 holes, and I'm now keeping them away with residual spray. But I'm clearly going to have to treat that part of the deck too (I figured it could last another year without treatment).<br/><br/>Oh, and we have mice in the basement and in the walls too. Some of which decided to nest in Heather's suitcase. So the mouse traps are now out, loaded up with mature cheddar :-)</p>

<h2>Peanut Butter</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/runrig/">runrig</a> on 2006-05-31T19:13:45</h3>
We had Vector Control out for a rat problem, and he said to just load the traps with fruit (e.g. dried apricots), but they weren't working until I coated the bait with peanut butter. He said that they can lick off the peanut butter without setting off the trap, but apparently our rats and mice weren't that careful<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)



<h2>Bees and Mice</h2>

Hi Matt:<br/><br/>Is your deck pressure treated lumber?<br/><br/>Once you get rid of the bees with the spray, they should not be back (as long as you get them all).<br/><br/>Any ideas how the mice got in the house?<br/><br/>Emba33

It was pressure treated, but it's pretty old now I think (probably 5 or 6 years old) and has been left untreated. We actually had the main part of the deck treated this year, but omitted the pergola which is where they nested. So now the bees are gone (and they don't seem to be returning) we'll be treating that part too.

Make and LifeHacker are both linking to a DIY site's translation of a Chinese mosquito trap project, recycling a used 2L soda bottle.<br>

Yup I built one at the weekend. So far I've caught about 5 mosquitos.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-(
