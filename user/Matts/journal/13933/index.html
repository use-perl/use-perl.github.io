<p>I hate RPMs. They never seem to work quite right.<br/><br/>RPMs are the corporate standard for installing and keeping track of things at MessageLabs. So today I've been frantically building RPMs that got missed or forgotten by Martin who was tasked with building the initial batch (it's not his fault - it's a horrible job and I probably forgot to tell him which ones we needed).<br/><br/>On the plus side, cpan2rpm rocks. It's a little buggy, but actually produces usable RPMs.<br/><br/>Todays biggest nightmare was DateTime and DateTime::Format::Strptime. The latter depends on DateTime::Language and DateTime::Language::English. You can find DateTime::Language in DateTime::Calendar::Coptic (wtf is Coptic?). Great. But DateTime::Language::English is nowhere to be found on CPAN.<br/><br/>Much hair pulling ensued.<br/><br/>Eventually I gave up and googled for it. Turns out DateTime::Language (and ::English) was part of an OLDER version of the DateTime module. *sigh* So I went off to backpan and downloaded DateTime 0.13 and built it, and everything went swimmingly.<br/><br/>Oh, and I also had a horrible problem with mod_ssl.<br/><br/>The bug in my error_log was: "Unable to create SSL Proxy Context"<br/><br/>Joy of joys. WTF?<br/><br/>Google was no help. The only other person to have *ever* seen this problem was Japanese, I think.<br/><br/>Eventually I got it through sheer luck and bloodymindedness.<br/><br/>LoadModule proxy_module *must* come before LoadModule ssl_module, otherwise Apache won't start. I have no idea why this happens, except to say: Dynamically Loaded Libraries. Bad idea.</p>

<h2>Coptic</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/chromatic/">chromatic</a> on 2003-08-06T01:34:59</h3>
<p>"Coptic" basically means "Egyptian Christian".  I seem to recall it's derived from the ancient Greek word for Egypt at the time.  Think Greek Orthodox with an Egyptian twist and you're not too far off, for various values of "not too far off".</p>

Oh.  Sorry.</p>
