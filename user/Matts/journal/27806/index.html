<div class="span8">
<p>I've spent the best part of the whole morning restoring a Mac OS X installation due to the latest OS update destroying some libraries completely and preventing me from being able to get to the login screen. I had to go back and do a system install from my 10.3.0 disk and then run SoftwareUpdate a few times.<br/><br/>So I've lost LOADS of applications that ended up in /usr/bin. A quick diff shows that 190 apps aren't in /usr/bin that were in my previous system, and I fear just copying them over won't be a very good plan.<br/><br/>Not only that, but my printer settings have gone, and these were very carefully customised for photo printing. My monitor calibration settings are also all gone, so I have to do all that again. I'm sure I'll discover other things as time goes on.<br/><br/>Today computers suck.</p>

<h2>backups...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ask/">ask</a> on 2005-11-30T21:09:47</h3>
Not that I'm that good at taking regular backups (knock on wood), but I can highly recommend getting a firewire driveand cloning the system drive occasionally.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>... but you knew that already.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br><br>
&nbsp; - ask

<h2>Re:backups...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Matts/">Matts</a> on 2005-12-01T21:34:52</h3>
Yeah. I do actually keep a copy of<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/Users/matt on an external firewire (actually USB2) drive, but didn't have the space to also store the whole drive.<br><br>Maybe it's time to upgrade that drive. Two days wasted on this now (mostly because I cocked up when restoring something from<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/usr/lib and had to start over from scratch again).

I had a similar problem with my Mac except the drive complete croaked. I figured $100 bucks was worth it for a new fireware drive off newegg. Useful apps get installed in other places than just<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/Users, now I just mirror the whole thing...<br/><br/>Good luck on the restore, it sucks to have to do.

<h2>Fink</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ChrisDolan/">ChrisDolan</a> on 2005-11-30T23:46:19</h3>
I recommend using Fink next time around. Then you can do simple things like the following to get started:<br><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; fink install mysql<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; fink install dbd-mysql-pm586<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; fink install xml-parser-pm586<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; fink install svn-client-ssl<br><br>etc.  See fink.sf.net<br><br>

<h3><a href="/user/Matts/">Matts</a> on 2005-12-01T21:36:21</h3>
I do use fink. Fink wasn't lost in this debacle - it's still all there and working fine.

<h2>use linux!</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jmason/">jmason</a> on 2005-11-30T23:53:01</h3>
Get a proper OS!<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)<br/><br/>Not, but seriously -- I'm looking forward to eventually running all my machines as Xen instances, so I can roll back when crap like this happens.
