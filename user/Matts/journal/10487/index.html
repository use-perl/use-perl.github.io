<p>Now Time::Piece (porting to use base DateTime) is down to 5 tests failing. 3 of those are because DateTime doesn't support isdst (yet?) and 2 because I think DateTime.pm's implementation of day_of_year is broken (at least according to Time::Piece's test suite). The test in question creates a Time::Piece object from the epoch 951827696 which is "2000-02-29T12:34:56" (note it's feb 29th), and the day_of_year for Time::Piece is supposed to return 59, whereas DateTime's API returns 61 (it's offset is different, so using the same offset that's 60).<br/><br/>Counting up (31 days in January, 29 in Feb) I see no way it could be 61, no matter where you start.<br/><br/>Still, DateTime.pm isn't even at 0.01 yet (it's 0.01_00), so at least everything else works nicely.</p>

I fixed it.  I'll release a new version soon.

Are you going to support isdst too? That would be nice as I don't really know how to implement it at the Time::Piece level.

I can add is_dst to DateTime::TimeZone.  It doesn't really make sense as a DateTime.pm attribute, though, since DST can only be determined in the context of the given zone.  Does that seem reasonable?<br> <br>BTW, it'd be best to discuss this on the datetime@perl.org list<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)

Well it's a combined feature of the time and the timezone, so I suspect it's best left in DateTime.pm, either that or you're going to have to pass a DateTime object into your $timezone-&gt;is_dst() method.<br> <br>Whatever you decide on though I'll make it work in Time::Piece.<br> <br>(and yes I know I should join the list, but I just don't have time right now, so I'd rather get Time::Piece working with DateTime without joining if I can, and it seems I can<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

My last post didn't make much sense.  Sorry.<br> <br>What I mean was that I can implement DateTime-&gt;is_dst, but under the hood it will actually get that info from a DT::TimeZone object.  And the only kind of time zone object that will ever return true is_dst is one based on the Olson DB.  So an offset only time zone will always return is_dst of 0.<br> <br>Does that make more sense?<br> <br>Anyway, see DateTime.pm 0.03, which I just uploaded to CPAN.  It implements DateTime-&gt;is_dst.
