<p>I've been cycling now for over 6 months. I had a very long break over the winter due to a long running cold, but I'm now back into it full swing. I've clocked well over 300 miles on the bike (not that much, but it's quite impressive to me).<br/><br/>I'm *still* exhausted every day by the time I get home. I'm sure I must be fitter but I don't feel it at the end of my journey. Of course I live on a big hill so this is partly to be expected.<br/><br/>I haven't lost any weight from this. This is a bit of a surprise to me - I really thought the weight would drop off (I'm still around 200 pounds). Of course losing weight is a simple equation - calories in > calories out. Or as a co-worker of mine puts it: mouth-hole is bigger than the asshole.<br/><br/>I'm quite tempted to do more cycling (such as a cycle across the US - hah!), and can recommend it - I still make it to work faster than I would in the car (though our offices are moving so that will change real soon now) and I feel like I'm doing my bit for the environment, which gives me a feeling of peace.</p>

<h2>Hacker's Diet</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jdavidb/">jdavidb</a> on 2004-06-21T19:40:07</h3>
<p>You've probably long since heard of the <a href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/" title="fourmilab.ch">Hacker's Diet</a fourmilab.ch>, which basically expounds on the simple calorie formula you described.  However, I think it's invaluable, so if you haven't, I'm sure you'd enjoy checking it out.  (Or for anyone reading who hasn't.)  The author basically asserts that trying to exercise your way to lower weight is futile, though he certainly doesn't discount the value of exercise.  He just believes in a primarily calorie-count-oriented plan of action with exercise as an optional side feature.</p>



<h2>Muscle</h2>

Keep in mind that if you're biking often (especially up and down hills) there's a good chance you're building leg muscle.  That means you could be losing fat without losing weight.
<p>
A body fat measurement is in order I think.  Then, another one every 3 months or so.</p>

<p>I got ahold of a scale that purports to measure body fat percentage electrically.  Its reliability is horrendous, however.  It varies extremely based on the moistness of the bottom of my feet, in addition to other factors I can't fathom.  I figure it's better than nothing, though, and I track and trend my body fat percentage daily with the same calculations I use for body weight (from the Hacker's Diet).  I figure eventually it would be nice to get a real measurement done, with caliper or even better, with submersion.</p>

I've got one.<br> <br>I was also a <a href="http://www.gems-calibration.com/whatisaametrologist.htm" title="gems-calibration.com">metrologist</a gems-calibration.com> for 13 years... take that for what it is worth. Throw in a few bucks and you can buy a cup of coffee somewhere...<br> <br>Anyway, you are right about the variation. But, from a measurement standpoint, that is to be expected. (Consider, the thing shoots an electric current from one leg to another. The current has to pass thru (and along... there are multiple paths) one leg, the core of your body, and down the other leg. Anything that changes the current flow will change the reading.)<br> <br>You should make sure your feet and the unit are dry. Then, use it three times in a row... if it doesn't give you the same reading, plus or minus one digit... I'd suggest not using it. It has to be repeatable over the short run before you can expect it to be repeatable from day to day.<br> <br>I'd suspect low battery levels if it deviates between two consecutive readings a few seconds apart.<br> <br>The next issue is going to be just like weighing yourself... you have to be consistent about the time of day, etc.<br> <br>I have found that my most meaningful data comes if I use the same routine. Get up in the morning, strip, take care of my "daily ritual" (toilet), and weigh immediately (after washing my hands).<br> <br>Don't even drink any water before-hand... too much of a variation. Remember, the current is passing thru your body core. I use the bathroom first because I can't "standardize" how much I'm "holding" from the previous day... so emptying out before hand is as close as I can come to being the same from day to day.<br> <br>I can take that data, and using just that data... show you where I've taken long walks/runs/bike rides. And... you  can see when the "super compensation" of carbohydrate replenishment is done. For me, the deviations line up very well with my activity levels and has been quite repeatable in this regard.<br> <br>But, you have to be a real stickler about making sure all of your data is taken under the same conditions <i>if you want to make sense of the variations.</i> <br> <br>It gets worse. By noting that the data is shifting with the state of carbohydrate balance in the legs (depleted vs. super-compensated) we come to realize that <i> <b>the device is not intended for use under those circumstances.</b> </i> (In other words... it is not accurate under these conditions.) Instead, it is intended for use by a "normal" person whose body is in its "natural" state.<br> <br>(Never mind the irony of such a person not caring about the data this device provices.)<br> <br>So, if you want an "accurate" reading of actual body fat. You will need to wait 3 - 7 days for your body to fully recover from your rides and "stabilize"... so that you minimize the effect on the device due to carbohydrate balance in the muscle.<br> <br>It also assumes that you do not deviate too far from the normal populace in body structure. So, if you are extremely fat or fit... it will be less accurate for you.<br> <br>All in all... I think it is good for trending information, but I wouldn't get too hung up on the actual numbers.<br> <br>YMMV

<p> <i>You should make sure your feet and the unit are dry.</i> </p>

<p>Actually the instructions for this unit say your feet should be somewhat moist.  That's kind of annoying, as "somewhat" moist is nowhere near precise.  I usually don't worry much about it, but I usually weigh right after my morning shower, so my feet are in some varying stage between dry and sopping.</p>

<p>You're right, you can't get too hung up on the numbers.  I keep the info, but if I ever got really serious about it, I'd have to find a more accurate method.</p>

<p>Incidentally, I always consume one 12 oz caffeinated drink before weighing (half before my shower, half afterward).  That probably affects things a bit, but at least it's the same amount each day.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)  If I didn't have the soft drink, I probably would fall asleep in the shower...</p>

<h2>My Commute and Weight</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/mako132/">mako132</a> on 2004-06-21T23:32:45</h3>
I started biking again after a 5 year layoff (2nd kid born), back in mid-April.  My current commute is about 4 miles 'in' and 8.3 miles 'out'.     In the morning I have to drive the kids to school and I have the bike on the roof rack, until I drop the car off at my wife's job.  Hence why 'in' != 'out'.  Starting Wednesday, school is out so I'll be biking 8 miles both ways.<br> <br>I've lost about 8 lbs.  So I'm down to (coincidentally) about 200 lbs. But I also play basketball MWF during lunch.<br> <br>My main suggestion is to not reach for something high fat after you come home exhausted.  Try fruit or high-protein.  Avoid grapes though, or you'll be pooping like a tuba section.<br> <br>I could lose far more weight if I ate better, especially on the weekends when I'm not doing much.  If I were one of those salad-eating guys I'd probably be down to 190.  For example last Friday I had a foot-long egg and sausage sub<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-0<br> <br>So the way I look at it, if I can have more days where I'm eating less than usual, cut down on the days I pork it down, I'll come out ahead.<br>



<h2>Same Here</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/gnat/">gnat</a> on 2004-06-23T12:27:15</h3>
I get up at 4:45am and do a half-hour bike ride.  We own the world's best random number generator disguised as a set of portable scales.  I too have found that my weight doesn't seem to change a whole lot based on just exercise.<p>

I've been trying to moderate my intake.  My approach is three-fold: don't put too much on your plate, don't feel bad about leaving food on your plate, and only snack on things that make you poop.  I've eaten more fruit in the last few weeks, I think, than I did last year.  I lost a few pounds on this regimen after two weeks, but then YAPC intervened and, as anyone who saw me eat at YAPC will attest, my self-control went out the window.</p><p>

I have a bunch of conferences coming up this year, so I'm going to have to learn restraint in the face of temptation.  It's so hard when it's new food (e.g., wings) and there's no chance of putting leftovers in the fridge for later.  That'll be my challenge over the coming months<nobr> <wbr></nobr>...</p><p>

Good luck with the riding.  See you at OSCON!</p><p>

I enjoy the extra work time, and it makes getting up early worth it.  I've had to totally stop my late nights, though, so I watch no TV now.  I try to get to bed around 9pm at night, which means basically "as soon as the kids go to sleep".  That's real hard to get used to, not to mention when I change timezones for travel and can't bikeride but am expected to party late.  Uh, I mean, network.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<p>

In the words of Bart Simpson, "there's a 4:30 in the <i>morning</i> now?"</p><p>

To be honest, I don't ride that far.  I try to ride in a high gear so it's hard work, but it's only about 4 miles.  I get more mileage telling people the hour I rise than the distance I ride<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p><p>

<h2>Bad News</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Ovid/">Ovid</a> on 2004-07-01T05:41:01</h3>
<p>Damn.  I've started biking like mad for weeks now and I religiously weigh myself first thing every morning (well, not <em>first</em> thing, but no need to get graphic.)  I've not lost an ounce, either.  I wondered if I was doing something wrong, but I see now that I will, in fact, have to watch my diet more.  Bummer.</p>
