<p>This week it has been scorchio here - over 30 degrees every day. Unfortunately working in the basement I haven't seen any of this - instead it's felt absolutely freezing down there.<br/><br/>I of course put this down to the fact that basements are just colder than upstairs. Logical, see?<br/><br/>Today my wife pipes up - "Do you think it could be that we unblocked the vents and so we're blowing cool air into the basement from the A/C?"<br/><br/>DUH!<br/><br/>When we moved in all the vents down here were blocked up. It seemed freezing so we unblocked everything to let some heat in. Now heat rises and the vents are in the roof so this didn't make a huge difference, but it was better than nothing.<br/><br/>In the summer with A/C on this is a whole different ball game. Cold falls, so it fell quite happily from the ceiling vent into the basement, making it much colder than anywhere else in the house. So that's all blocked up again now - we'll see what effect it has.</p>
