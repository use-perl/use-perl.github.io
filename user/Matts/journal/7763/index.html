<p>My annoyance at Tony Blair and George Bush is now incredibly pent up and I feel like I'm going to burst. I can't talk about it at work for fear that someone will disagree with me (mustn't talk politics and all that). And I'm sure there are those here who will disagree too, but it just seems to me that Bush is doing nothing more than trying to make a name for himself - to try and go down in history. Either that or to finish what his Dad started. Bah.<br/><br/>Personally I'd rather have Clinton back. His sexual antics made me feel a whole lot safer than Bush's attempts to destabilise the gulf yet again.<br/><br/>ARGH! OK, I feel marginally better now. Maybe it's time we had a revolution :-/</p>

the conservative PM'ers?  Perhaps if Clinton figured out a way to accept Bin Laden when <a href="http://216.239.53.100/search?q=cache:Q-qqyWOCcgwC:www.infowars.com/saved%2520pages/Prior_Knowledge/Clinton_let_bin_laden.htm+was+clinton+offered+bin+laden%3F&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8" title="216.239.53.100">he was offered</a 216.239.53.100>... well, you can figure out what impact that would have made, especially on Sept. 11th.

How can anyone say with any degree of accuracy whether that would have had any effect on the Sept. 11th attacks whatsoever?  Is it not possible that Bin Laden's followers would have attempted to extract<nobr> <wbr></nobr>/more/ vengeance from us if we'd captured/killed their leader than they did with him alive and well?  Speculation on mistakes of the past is pointless, even dangerous, when it dwells only on one side of the issue.

I agree - my point was that Matts was only looking at this issue from one (liberal) perspective and that is quite limited.  All of us each have a limited perspective and no one, even our political leaders, is without fault.  But I do believe it's safe to assume that they're (the political leaders) operating with a greater perspective (and intel) than you (and me - saying <i>you</i> in a general sense).

In my doctors waiting room I read an article in Time Magazine about how the Bush administration ignored the research and knowledge passed on from the Clinton administration about Al Qaeda.

Was it an old issue of Time?  This story has been bouncing around for the last 11 months.  It's an accepted fact among the policy wonks on the Sunday morning talkshows, and the Bush administration officials have been occasionally reminded about it.

not that old, a few months ago.   They have the article or one quite like it online: <a href="http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,333835,00.html" title="time.com">Could 9/11 Have Been Prevented?</a time.com>.

Do a search on any combination of these terms: Dan Burton, Clinton, China, Chung, Lee.  Then let me know how "safe" you feel.

Oh, and just for good measure, do a search on "Al Gore" + "Occidental Petroleum" just in case you were about to play the environmentalist card.</p>

Bradley -- What did he do for New Jersey? If he can't govern one state well, then what makes you think he would have done well with a whole country?
<p>
McCain --- Is a one trick pony with only one issue and almost no support in congress. His presidency would have most likely resembled Carter's without the brilliance and honest humanity.
</p><p>
Clinton -- How rose colored do you glasses have to be to continue to believe this man was so good? What did Clinton really do during his term? The "boom" of the economy during his years is turning out to be a sham. I wonder what the real growth is once you adjust the numbers based on the billions that are being discovered as falsely reported over the past five years.  He allowed Iraq to thumb their noses at us repeatedly, did nothing to stabilize the Isreal/Palestinian conflict, involved us in more seperate "Peace Keeping" missions than any other President, ignored massive amounts of information on terrorist activity, and in general allowed the world to believe the US had lost the teeth to defend themselves -- and so we got 9-11.

I couldn't be more glad Clinton is gone -- the only thing that would be better is if Hillary Rodham Clinton would be finally prosecuted for the illegal business deals she was involved in.</p>

<i>"What did Clinton really do during his term?"</i> <br> <br>This is an ignorant comment, which I'll file alongside those who suggest Carter also achieved nothing during his administration.<br> <br> <i>"The "boom" of the economy during his years is turning out to be a sham"</i> <br> <br>It wasn't a "boom" in the economic sense. The economy saw a very steady rise during this period, and it experienced a shake down, and is now on the rise again. I don't see how you can blame income tax fraud on the Clinton administration though, unless I'm seriously missing some slip up Clinton made. Did he pass a law to explicitly allow income tax fraud?<br> <br> <i>"did nothing to stabilize the Isreal/Palestinian conflict"</i> <br> <br>What about the Wye deal?<br> <br> <i>"and in general allowed the world to believe the US had lost the teeth to defend themselves"</i> <br> <br>So prosecuting Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman and his cohorts is so easily forgotten...

I notice that you selectively removed my favorable comment on Carter; typical of an attempt to maintain a viewpoint that doesn't stand up to the light of day.  I did state that Carter's presidency was marked by brilliance and humanity. Carter had almost every trait we might have desired in a President but two -- the support of congress, and the willingness to deceive those around him; the lack of these two traits are what severely hampered Carter's ability to affect the changes he desired.<br> <br>The economic boom, "It wasn't a 'boom' in the economic sense..." -- well then you agree with me when I said "The 'boom' of the economy.. was a sham"; why did you choose to argue the point?<br> <br>What aspect of the fraud do I lay on Clinton's administration? What has been going on is not "income tax fraud", it is corporate fraud and the defrauding of the investing public. The Clinton admistration took the teeth out of the SEC via massive budget cuts to the point where they could no longer maintain any semblence of regulatory control over companies reporting or the fraudulent relationships between companies and the investment houses recommending them.<br> <br>The "Wye Deal", as I said what did Clinton really do during his term? The "Wye Deal" was never implemented, it never became more than words on paper; as is true of so much of the Clinton propaganda -- balanced budget ( not without tapping Social Security and stripping much needed budgets to the bone -- SEC, military, etc.) or universal healthcare ( nope, not yet ) which were two of his biggest platforms.<br> <br>Now, I predict that you will raise the exception that a President can do nothing without congress and that a republican congress can be help at least partially responsible for everything that occured during Clinton's term. Very well, then all we can hold against Clinton are the actions which can be attributed to him: Monica Lewinsky, bald face lying to the American public about something as inconsequential as a BJ, White water, the renting of the White House for personal funds, etc.<br> <br>Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman -- wow, he is serving a life sentence for the attempted murder of 2000 plus individuals. Such a strong reaction is sure to give fanatical terrorists a pause for thought. I bet their entire foundation was shaken to the core when they thought they might have to face 3 square meals, cable tv, a workout room, and a warm bed for their entire life and all they would have to do is try and kill 2000 people! Thanks.. but no thanks, and good riddance to Clinton.

International politics is a lot more complex than it seems.  No one says exactly what they mean.  Everything they say and do means something else.  It's all about putting pressure on other parties, not about the substance of what is said in a press conference or interview.<br> <br>Right now, it appears that the US and UK have maneuvered Iraq into accepting weapons inspectors (something last week Iraq said would not happen at all; then this weekend said would only happen with certain conditions; then yesterday said could happen unconditionally!).  Right now, it appears that the situation got PLAYED by Bush, that there won't be a war (for now), and that the US will get exactly what it wants: its people in Iraq dismantling their weaponry.<br> <br>All along people have been saying war is inevitable, that Bush just wants war, that this is a vendetta, that Bush is ignoring the international community.  And yet, Bush whipped everyone into a frenzy so much that they handed him, in no time at all, exactly what he wanted in the first place!  Saudi Arabia has siad they couldl launch any military action against Iraq from their airfields.  They "save face" by saying "we didn't change, Bush did."  But all Bush did was bring it before the UN, something that was likely going to happen in any event.<br> <br>Well, it is not over yet, of course.  The US is pushing for even more concesssions (although, again, we don't know if they really care about those things or are playing the game of international politics, which they've executed brilliantly thus far).  And Iraq has only offered a piece of paper, which isn't very descriptive or binding; the US and UN needs to direct how things are done, not Iraq.  But I see little reason not to admire how this has turned out thus far.<br> <br>And I pray my optimism isn't premature.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br>
