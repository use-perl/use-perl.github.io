<p>OK, so these releases are a bit confusing, so let me explain:<br/><br/>DBD::SQLite is the active release of the driver, tracking the current release of sqlite (currently 3.0.4)<br/><br/>DBD::SQLite2 is the old release of the driver, tracking sqlite 2.x (currently 2.8.15), and I won't be updating it very much at all. Everything is renamed, including all the internal C functions, so that you can definitely load both DBD::SQLite and DBD::SQLite2 in the same program and not have conflicts. The only significant changes since 0.31 are the update to sqlite 2.8.15, and the addition of the busy_timeout API from DBD::SQLite-1.0.<br/><br/>And yes, before the bikeshed painter brigade comes out, I know the "2" on the end makes the second one look more up to date. There are multiple reasons I chose this scheme.<br/><br/>Available on CPAN as soon as local CPAN mirrors update.</p>

Care to translate that for those of use across the pond?

I dunno if you did this in response to my email to you suggesting exactly that, but thank you anyway!

I actually replied to you, but my email bounced because I can't implement rDNS due to $lame_ISP.<br> <br>I'd discussed this with other people before, but your email did push me to work on it, so thanks. I don't think you'd renamed all the internal C functions, which I had to do so you could load both modules in the same perl process without conflicts, but I knew I had to do that beforehand anyway - which is why I took so long to actually release it.
