<div class="span8">
<p>Today I had to compile a C project with over 200 .c files. If I'd used a Makefile I would have had to list every .c file (yes, I could auto-generate).<br/><br/>Instead I downloaded and used "Cons" - a little known perl utility for software construction. The "Construct" file became:
<pre>
$cons = cons->new(
	CFLAGS => '-O2',
	LIBS => '-levent',
);
$cons->Program("dnsserver", <*.c>);
Default(qw(dnsserver));
</pre>
So I went digging to see why the project hadn't been updated in a long time. Turns out the author didn't like perl OO so just stopped.<br/><br/>There's now an SCons project in Python that's getting a lot of attention, and owes its history (and some of its syntax) to Cons.<br/><br/>Perhaps it's time for a back-port to perl. I used Cons instead of makefiles to get away from indentation being significant!</p>

<p>I&#8217;d rather write something more akin to Ruby&#8217;s Rake in Perl. There&#8217;s <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/TinyMake/" title="cpan.org">TinyMake</a cpan.org> on CPAN, but it&#8217;s too limited and I didn&#8217;t like the code. I&#8217;ve already sketched it out a little but didn&#8217;t start yet.</p>

Rake frankly looks awful. No automatic dependency generation (as far as I can tell) and you basically have to write the compile commands yourself, rather than having the library do it for you. You might as well just write a Makefile!<br><br>Perhaps I've missed something though - I only went through the tutorial.

<p>And that&#8217;s awful? Sure, it doesn&#8217;t do automatic dependencies, but Rake is Ruby and Rakefiles equally are Ruby &#8211; so unlike with Make, implementing arbitrarily complex functionality either in the build script or as a subclass of or some form of plugin for the engine is straightforward.</p>

<p>Cons&#8217; architecture so fixated on one optimising for the compilation of C code that you can&#8217;t reasonably use it for anything else. If you want to repurpose it in any way, you have to hack on Cons&#8217; guts&#8230; and have you <em>seen</em> them? It&#8217;s terrible. As far as I&#8217;m concerned, that&#8217;s far more awful than Rake.</p>

<p>What I want is a dependency resolver framework that comes with a basic implementation of abstract and simple file-based tasks, like Make, but whose recipes are written in a real language, and whose API has a servicable hooks to expand its behaviour and capabilities. Providing Cons-like features <em>on top</em> of that would be pretty easy and sane. Cons is not.</p>

Sounds like it's the implementation/internals you don't like (which I agree with) rather than the concept. I think that's spot on.

<p>More or less, yeah. I have no beef with the featureset of Cons, just with the things <em>absent</em> from its featureset.</p>

<p>F.ex., I&#8217;ve wanted to write a build script for my website; it&#8217;s currently powered by <code>make</code> and libxslt&#8217;s <code>xsltproc</code> tool. But I&#8217;d like to be able to use XML::LibXSLT instead, register a few XSLT extension fuctions right inside the build script, along with one or two functions to drive transforms, and then use those in my task recipes.</p>

<p>If I were using Ruby and Rake, that would be very easy. With Cons, not so much.</p>

<p>So I&#8217;d want a closure-based API much like Rake&#8217;s, first of all; the C-specific features should be layered onto that as a separate module. It might not even need to be a build engine plugin &#8211; if there is a module to easily extract dependencies from C sources, simply <code>use</code>-ing it in the build script and writing a bit of code to glue it into the rule registration would suffice.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s the great thing about build scripts being written in a real language: you can actually drive the build engine computationally. Fowler mentioned this when he wrote about his experience in switching his bliki build process to Rake: he didn&#8217;t even need the Make-ish pattern match/automatic rule support that Rake provides. It was just as easy to write a loop to register rules.</p>

Yup - I agree with all of that.<br><br>I *think* Scons provides all that (and more).
