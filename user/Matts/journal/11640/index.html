<p>Some spammer is mass spewing emails with subjects like "&lt;name>, Fuck their Faces then spurt chunks all over them!!!!" joe-jobbed against all sorts of domains that appear to have nothing in common. Friends have alerted me to their situation, and all I could say is "me too".<br/><br/>I'll post more details about the spammer in question as a response to this journal entry when I find out more details. Meanwhile, if you've been joe-jobbed by this spammer, post a response to this journal (I know there are at least two other journal entries here on use perl about this) containing the headers of the original email (assuming the bounce contained them) and I'll find out more details.</p>

I've been getting this things for months, though the combination of my name plus my domain is recent. A procmail rule to deep-six emails that are HTML-only catches half of them.

And a good thing I just check my spam file. There was a rather important false positive.</p>

Yes it would appear that they screen scraped  use.perl.org's member list somehow and used it to seed the 'From:' email header.  I've been relatively spam free up until this point to.  I guess I'm not getting spam at this point, just bounces, but it still sucks.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:(

<h2>I don't think it's use.perl.org they've scraped</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/wickline/">wickline</a> on 2003-04-15T01:46:28</h3>
My theory...<blockquote><div> <tt>On or before March 28th, someone harvested some addresses<br>
&nbsp; <br>They pulled from several technical mailing lists<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; (or possibly from NNTP interfaces to those lists)<br>
&nbsp; <br>Those included perl lists, but were not exclusively perl.<br>
&nbsp; <br>Around March 28th, that list was used<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; (to send the 'Swiss Group' spam)<br>
&nbsp; <br>By around April 5th that list saw wider distribution<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; (probably sold to some other spammers)<br>
&nbsp; <br>Around April 5th, someone used the list in their spamming<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; software to generate bogus From headers and presumably<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; genuine To headers. I've been the victim of having an<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; address of mine used in the From: header of a spam<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; message, and on that occasion I received hundreds of<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; bounces and complaints. From what I'm seeing, I'd say<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; that their software is generating a new bogus From:<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; header for each recipient.</tt> </div></blockquote>I've been getting these since at least April 5th. The From: header seems to be my domain name (wickline dot org) with some semi-random username on the front of it. Some of the usernames lead me to suspect that perhaps user names are being harvested from some perl source. For example, here are a few user names from today: Koenig, guntermann, iandstanley, tbekel, xpix, artis, tzoompy, giegerich, leonvs, fila, Boubaker, jkeen, tori, palmieri.<br> <br>Yes. Those are all from today. Each of those users at my domain was used in the From: header of a bounced spam message. Also, a Google search for each of those usernames and perl (ie "Koenig perl") will turn up hits. So, it seems likely that some perlish source was harvested. However, I'm not sure it's use.perl.org. Some other spam I've seen has left me thinking that someone recently harvested a variety of geeky mailing lists.<br> <br>Shortly before all this started, I saw spam on previously unspammed addresses used to post to various mailing lists. The spam was sent March 28th, and always had a subject which read<blockquote><div> <tt>Re: user@example.com,&nbsp; Swiss Group Switzerland ! Earn up to 2 daily in the Swish Stock Exchange !</tt> </div></blockquote>and the email addresses were those I'd used to post to various geeky lists (not the user@example.com above). They were usernames (at my domain) like the following:<blockquote><div> <tt>m_module_authors<br>m_perltrainers_digest<br>m_libwww_digest<br>m_pause<br>m_listbox<br>m<nobr>_<wbr></nobr>   to-validatorlist-re_tagclosing</tt> </div></blockquote>Note that the last username was never used in a perl-specific list. The first four were perl-specific, and the penultimate username was used in many contexts some years ago. At about the same time (March 28th), I also saw this same form of spam at several work email addresses. Some of those had been used to post to mailing lists, and others were not.<br> <br>Most of my mailing list addresses have been safe. Those are all older email addresses. All of my more recent subscriptions have been with usernames (at my domain) in the form m-list-subscribe-list_name_here. The 'list' and 'subscribe' in the address seem to scare off the address harvesting spiders.<br> <br>So, I've been getting joe-jobbed bounce messages since about April 5th. I also got a small batch of joe-jobbed spam on April 7th. The following usernames (which I've never used from my domain, so I'm assuming must be joe jobbed) appeared in the To: headers of spam messages: gerald_bahorich, losing, gregory_adams, jeff_richmond. The joe jobbed To: headers may or may not be related to the From: header situation. My hunch is that they're two separate things.<br> <br>On April 12, the St. Louis perl hackers mailing list got a couple bits of spam, but those may not be related. That list hadn't seen spam previously (for around a year that I'm aware of). My cpan address gets a few bits of spam each day, but that's nothing new.<br> <br>Matt, if you want full headers of any of these, please reply to this message. Otherwise, I'll figure you have plenty to work with at this point. Besides, the full headers (from the bouncing MTAs) won't be all that useful.<br> <br>here are a few likely looking snippets reported by the bouncing MTAs though.

<h2>Addresses on CPAN</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/bart/">bart</a> on 2003-04-16T20:23:46</h3>
It seems like many people who have put modules on CPAN are in the same boat. Perhaps the existence of the next file can be part of the problem:
<blockquote><div> <a href="http://www.cpan.org/authors/01mailrc.txt.gz" title="cpan.org">authors/01mailrc.txt.gz</a cpan.org> </div></blockquote>
Can somebody explain to me why this file even exists?
