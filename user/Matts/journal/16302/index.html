<p>My current computer (ted) that runs axkit.org and pretty much my entire network is slowly dying. It's started making horrible noises. So I have two options:<br/><br/>- Fix the noises (this probably means just a new PSU as it's the fan making the noise)
- Get a new computer.<br/><br/>On the latter option I have been looking around at what I can get. I can go for basically three types of machines:<br/><br/>- A 1U machine (because one day I may wish to rackmount it)
- A cheapo build-it-yourself box from somewhere like Scan
- A pre-built desktop<br/><br/>So the other day I went and looked around PC World (yes, don't say it, I know) for their cheapest options. I found that the cheapest PC they sell is the eMac. Strange, but true.<br/><br/>So now I'm left with a dilemma - can I run my network (email, DHCP, DNS, Web, NAT, firewall, etc) from an eMac? I think probably yes, but it might prove more difficult than getting a cheapo build it myself box and sticking linux on it.<br/><br/>Two interesting side-points: I don't have a monitor in the house any more (last one broke so I threw it out) so the eMac solves that problem nicely. And secondly you don't seem to be able to buy a PC for less than ÃÂ£500 (I don't *need* a P4-2.5Ghz thank you - ted is a P3-500 and manages just fine). If anyone knows different I'd like to hear it.</p>

1U boxes are all very well but they don't really care about the noise they make. This may be of concern in a residential setting<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)<br> <br>
Have you thought about one of <a href="http://linitx.com/shop/product_info.php/cPath/6/products_id/301" title="linitx.com">these</a linitx.com> ? - small, fanless, reasonably quick and not too expensive.

<h2>I have a eMac</h2>

I have a eMac at home and it does basically what you are asking for.<br/><br/>1000 euros, + upg to 1Gb ram from crucial, and it's great!<br/><br/>Ideally it would run Mac OS X Server, but normal panther works fine. You could also run Yellow Dog Linux. It's up to you.

Plus, if you get AppleCare you are totally covered for 3 years. I usually don't go for the extra cost service agreements on things like electronics, but when I think of all the things that can happen with a computer over 3 years, it seems like a good deal. This is especially true if you're going to have it running 24/7 as a server.

<h2>watch out for noise</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jmason/">jmason</a> on 2003-12-12T17:58:46</h3>
cheapo PCs make a huge amount of noise.  However if you're going for something slow it should be a bit quieter<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)<br/><br/>The mini-ITX boxes seem really nice, FWIW.



<h2>Quiet, unobtrusive boxes</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/dws/">dws</a> on 2003-12-12T18:20:51</h3>
For my last box, which replaced an old P133 home file/database server, I went with a VIA mini-ITX single-board system. They're small, low-power, and are reasonably quiet. They run RH8 just fine, and people are building them into <a href="http://www.mini-itx.com/" title="mini-itx.com">just about anything</a mini-itx.com>. (This <a href="http://www.mini-itx.com/projects/windowsxpbox/" title="mini-itx.com">dual boot mod</a mini-itx.com> is particularly clever). And (at least in the US) they're fairly inexpensive. I built one out for about $325 USD, but that didn't include a 60Gb drive rescued from a different system. The downside is that the on-board graphics are limited to 1024x768, that hardly matters if you're mostly headless.



<h2>3rd option</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/djberg96/">djberg96</a> on 2003-12-12T19:15:09</h3>
<i>So I have two options:
</i><p><i>
- Fix the noises (this probably means just a new PSU as it's the fan making the noise)<br>
- Get a new computer.</i>
</p><p>
You forgot "turn up the stereo".<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-P</p>
