<p>I came home today and my wife said: "Would you mind fixing the lights upstairs? I think they blew with the outside light this morning". So I check, and they are indeed all off upstairs. So I change the bulb in the outside lamp (and it comes on as I screw it in), and trot off to check the fusebox...<br/><br/>Unfortunately we have the old fashioned wired fuses. No RCD here (RCD == Residual Current Device for anyone whose dad isn't an electrical engineer. Its those little switches rather than a big ceramic fuse), so I yank out the light fuse (live of course - don't want to bring down my server on the other circuit). Fuse is fine. Damn!<br/><br/>Damn because I'm now lost for ideas. There's no power up here. Everything is dead. Yet the fuse is fine. So what am I supposed to do? I went into the loft to check we hadn't had a squirrel chew through any cabling, but everything *looked* fine.<br/><br/>And Dad's phone is engaged.<br/><br/>Oh, and the drains are backed up again. This is the third time since just before christmas now, and it's getting annoying (and expensive!) to have them unblocked. We don't chuck anything strange down, honest. We're not really sure what to do about it.<br/><br/>Stupid house.<br/><br/>Ideas on how to fix this gratefully received.</p>

<p>You're going to need a schematic and check all the switches just in case there is some sort of weird continuity of circuits and check the light sockets upstairs to see if there is any current at all and check your ground. Other than that I'd call a professional as electricity demands respect<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<p>Ask your wife what kind of conditioner she uses on her hair...I have grouchy plumbing too that acts up when I use particular kinds of ooey-gooey hair care products. Draino Max works like a charm but it does eat old pipes so a weekly dose of enzymes works better for long term.</p>
