<p>I'm getting pretty dismayed at the state of this ibook. The screen has started to flicker once again! I can't believe it! I'm really annoyed now. So it looks like it'll have to go back once more to be fixed.<br/><br/>Very very unhappy with the quality of this bit of hardware. It's no good looking great if I can't use it.</p>

Yech: another case of the flickering backlight...<br> <br>http://discusssearch.info.apple.com/WebX?128@216.ACfWaxFBdXF.12@.3bb8aa5f<br> <br>(From http://www.macintouch.com/ibook2001pt9.html   )<br> <br>"We are a AASP Plus (authorized apple service provider) and Apple dealer in Canada and have seen the ibook backlight issue. I have fixed a number of these by taking the bottom case off and correcting the routing of the display cable. It appears to chafe during the opening/closing operation. Of all the ones I have done none has come back or has had the problem return. It takes me about 15 minutes to complete the operation/repair."<br> <br>Of course the repairers should be familiar with what's required, but it certainly won't hurt to let them know that you're aware of it too. Word from the forum above is that the replacement cables now have a protective casing around the piece of the data wire that rubs up against the hinge.<br> <br>Best of luck,<br>Paul

Thanks for the thread. Very interesting reading. I fear that my current cable already has the protective shielding around it, though perhaps not. It was repaired for almost exactly this problem about 3 months ago (which would be about three months after I got it).<br> <br>It certainly makes me think an extended warranty is worthwhile.<br> <br>Very disappointed to have to be using my vaio once again (tiny keyboard, 40mins battery life!).
