<p>Yes, like davorg my new year's resolution is to lose weight and get fit. I had the same resolution last year, and did really well - I joined a gym, went regularly, and felt great. However it all ended when the dot-com crashed and I ran out of money - no money to go to the gym any more.<br/><br/>However I've decided I'm going to go about it in a really radical way this year. In order to get to the right weight for my height, rather than lose weight I've decided to gain height.<br/><br/>I figure I need to be about 9 foot tall by the time The Perl Conference comes around. So expect me to be quite visible this year.</p>

<h2>9 feet tall?</h2>

Would it help to motivate you if we just started calling you Hagrid?<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;-)

That's really more of a <a href="/user/gnat/" title="perl.org">gnat</a perl.org> thing.  Think about it -- he has to work with dangerous animals (the <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/" title="oreilly.com">bestiary</a oreilly.com>, as well as Larry, the Damian, and the like), he lives way out on the fringes of civilization (Colorado is close to Wyoming, which is definitely NOT civilization), and he always stands out in a crowd (though it's probably because of his taste in clothing and not his height).

I'd better stop here, before I cast Snape and Mad-Eye Moody.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>
