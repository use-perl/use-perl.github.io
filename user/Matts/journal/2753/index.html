<p>I made bread today. There's really nothing quite like it - I think it's probably the best thing in the world to cook.<br/><br/>You get 10 minutes of vigorous exercise kneeding the dough, and god knows I need all the exercise I can get these days!<br/><br/>You get to wait whilst a living being creates the air bubbles in your dough, making it twice the size. Making bread is a biological and chemical experiment!<br/><br/>You get the most fabulous smell as it cooks.<br/><br/>And finally, you get to sit with your wife around the breakfast bar stuffing your faces with freshly cooked bread that you just cooked to perfection. Deeeelicious.<br/><br/>We even took <a href="http://home.sergeant.org/Bread/">pictures!</a>. The "turtle" is my wife's design. She should be teaching kindergarten not high school, dontcha think?</p>

We were given a bread machine recently, and while it isn't as fun as making it yourself, it's a lot easier, and usually just as delicious.  Mmmmmm, bread.



<h2>Darn you!</h2>

Darn it Matt, now I really want to make some bread! But I'm thinking something w/ pumpkin because I have a lot of it sitting in my pantry.

I have yet to master bread (my first attempt came out as a flatbread).  Your pictures look amazing!  ct/<a href="http://use.perl.org/user/skyhook/" title="perl.org">skyhook</a perl.org> recommended <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1580080030" title="amazon.com">this book</a amazon.com> when it comes to bread.
