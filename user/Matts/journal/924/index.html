<div class="span8">
<p>A lot of people are concerned about AxKit.<br/><br/>This is fair enough - the domain (axkit.org) has been down now for over two months, although it seems like longer.<br/><br/>Don't Panic!<br/><br/>AxKit is not dead. Far from it. Well actually not *far* from it, but it's definitely not dead, it's just been sleeping.<br/><br/>There are two reasons for the slowness:<br/><br/>1.<br/><br/>The house we moved into took longer than we hoped. We had planned on 2 rooms a week for renovation. It's taken us over twice that length of time. Which isn't surprising really - I think we've done remarkably well to completely redecorate a 4 bedroom house from top to bottom in about 10-12 weeks (assuming we finish in the next 2-4 weeks). We ran out of money to do the bathroom unfortunately (and the bathroom is scary, believe me -- how would you like an Avocado suite with smoky pink mirrored tiles on the wall???), but the rest of the house is starting to look stunning.<br/><br/>2.<br/><br/>This is split into two parts:<br/><br/>a) Getting DSL installed took longer than it was supposed to. And once it was installed, it didn't work, so I had to wait 2 weeks to get the engineers back out. Not fun. But it works now, and it's fast. Much faster than before, so we can rejoice.<br/><br/>b) Once the DSL was installed, I went about getting my domains transfered over from Demon, my old ISP. To do that I could have either gone through NSI's transfer procedure, and pissed about with them and paid them way too much, or do what I decided to do instead, and go through a TUCOWS registrar, and manage the domains myself, via the web. Of course that all went wrong too. The first time through, I sent transfer requests to Demon on company headed paper, and I paid for the transfer to LowCostDomains. And I waited. And waited... Eventually I called Demon, who told me my transfer request wasn't valid (thanks for calling me!), as my domains were registered under Fastnet Software Ltd, not AxKit.com Ltd, which was the paper I'd used. Yes, I changed my company name earlier this year to solve a dispute with a US company. So, after getting email rejections from LCDN, I re-sent a transfer request to Demon, and re-paid for the transfer to LCDN. I called Demon to ensure everything was OK. They said yes. That was 5 days ago. I'm still waiting for the transfer.<br/><br/>So please, fret not about AxKit. People have been busy in the background for the last two months working on real solutions using AxKit. For example, Simon Cozens and the other people at Oxford University Computing Services have been re-designing their site around AxKit, which is pretty cool. And UpMyStreet.com are ready to go live with a new WAPTV based site using AxKit. We're not dead. We'll be back stronger than ever soon.</p>
