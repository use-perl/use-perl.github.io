<p>Technically this would probably be called an Advanced Fee Fraud, not a Nigerian Scam. But it's interesting anyway...

<p>If this is a scam, is there some subtlety to it, and if why is it named "advanced fee"? Advanced in the sense of an advance of money, rather than advanced as in relative timing of someting, or advanced as in sophisticaed?</p>
<p>From my reading of the message, he intends that you ship the car out to him (initially at your expence) before his payment (via the third party) clears. Hence the scam would be that the payment never clears, but the car is well on its way by then (or delivered and disappeared). If so, the reward is one car. I thought that people usually preferred money to material goods in these things.</p>

The former - advanced as in the money is advanced to the scammer.

<h2>yup, it's a scam</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/geoff/">geoff</a> on 2003-10-06T02:27:33</h3>
it works because banks typically have a short window under which they can deny you access funds you deposit, from 3 to 7 days in the US.  that means that if you deposit a fake $10,000 check, the bank is required to give you access to that money after 7 days, regardless of whether or not they have actually recieved the funds themselves. so, 6 weeks later when the bank discovers <i>you</i> deposited a bad check, they promptly require <i>their</i> money back.<br> <br><br/><br/>you can find details of this particular version of the scam all over the internet, such as <a href="http://www.nbc10.com/money/1511315/detail.html" title="nbc10.com">here</a nbc10.com>, and <a href="http://www.komotv.com/stories/27505.htm" title="komotv.com">here</a komotv.com>.  <br> <br><br/><br/><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0767906845/qid=1065406950/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_1/002-4425332-7514450?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846" title="amazon.com"> <i>The Art of the Steal</i> </a amazon.com> by Frank Abagnale (of <a href="http://www.dreamworks.com/catchthem/" title="dreamworks.com"> <i>catch me if you can</i> </a dreamworks.com> fame) is a very good read, and full of descriptions of this kind of thing.
