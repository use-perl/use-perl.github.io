<p>Well, the house is now 99% done. The bathroom guy finished up today (only 4 days later than expected) and the double glazing guys finished yesterday.<br/><br/>Fantastic.<br/><br/>Or not.<br/><br/>The double glazing guys scratched two of the windows (either going in, or before they got here), the side panels on our french doors were the wrong shape frames, so aren't finished or fitted properly. The fire escape window was fitted to a back window (with a 30 foot drop) instead of to my office window which looks out over the flat garage roof. There's a defect in the glass of the master bedroom window and they made a pigs ear of the trim on the window in my office. Bah! They're coming out to fix it all next week.<br/><br/>The bathroom guys is sick of us and this project. But unfortunately he's attached the overflow on the bath skew-wiffy so there appears to be a gap that water will flow through and probably just go down underneath the bath. I'm sure he can re-adjust it quite easily though.<br/><br/>But thats not the worst of it...<br/><br/>The middle wall in the house appears to have dropped about an inch. Maybe an inch and a half. And its a brick wall. We have no idea why (and no particular desire to find out). We now have a choice - hope it doesn't get worse (which would probably break all the tiles in the new bathroom) and live with it, or get out now before it all falls down :-(<br/><br/>We'll most likely pick the path of least resistance - hoping it doesn't get worse. Nuts.</p>

<p>Maybe get a structural engineer to come look at that wall as there are some solutions these days that might keep you from having to move. My dad had a sinking garage slab that he had some guys come out and pump in a hydraulic mud solution of some kind more than 20 years ago and I'm sure the technology is better now even if they can only just stabilise it.</p>
