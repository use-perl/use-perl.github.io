<p>Today we're just about moving in to our new (rented) house.<br/><br/>We held off for just over a week because we could. It's nice to be able to be elsewhere and get the house organised from afar in our own good time. However I'm ready to move in now - I just want my own place again.<br/><br/>So I've been working from my new office today. On the plus side I have 4M DSL - it flies! On the downside though the office is in the basement, so it's a little on the cold side, and a little on the dark side. i think some brighter and better bulbs will help though. I feel completely disorganised in here - I have no shelves so I have boxes full of books in one corner, and everything else strewn across my desk.<br/><br/>Work sent me a printer. Unfortunately they sent me a HP LaserJet 1000. Little did I know this was a WinPrinter. Grrrr. So I spent hours trying to get it to work on my mac, only to have to give up and get it working on a Windows laptop and share the printer. Only even shared it didn't work - I had to get some fancy filter called foo2zjs installed first. This all sounds very straightforward but has taken me hours and hours to get working. Compare this to my last printer - a nice Postscript capable printer that took me about 2 minutes to setup. I hate printer manufacturers.<br/><br/>We'll probably move in proper tomorrow. We don't have the pets here yet, and we want them with us.<br/><br/>So now I have to figure out what I'm going to do with the games room here. There's room for a Snooker table in there, but I can't afford one of those. There's certainly room for a pool table and a table football table (not sure I can afford those either, though I'm more likely to find them second hand here, and they'd be easier to get down the basement stairs!). Alternatively I may just turn it into a big <a href="http://www.cambridgepartybouncers.co.uk/images/Big_picture_for_web_page.jpg">ball pond</a> and dive in. Wheee!</p>

have you got craigslist in that city?  it's the best way to find cheapo crap, especially good for the big stuff like table football tables that people would really want to get rid of quickly when they move.<br/><br/>actually, I have a room like that -- still haven't got the table football table yet, although the dartboard is ready to be hung on the wall<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)

Unfortunately, though large enough for a perl mongers group, kitchener/waterloo is too small for craigslist; only a quarter-million people in the two cities.<br> <br>However, there's freecycle.org, which supplies free crap, with all the likelihood of getting a snoocker table (that is, low).  Good for old furnature, at least.<br> <br>There's also kw.forsale .
