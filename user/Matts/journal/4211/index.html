<h2>One Easy Answer</h2>

Jim Carrey as Murdoch.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)

Nah, I think Dwight Schultz could <b>still</b> pull this off convincingly, no need to replace <b>him</b><nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

<h2>Tough call</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/rjray/">rjray</a> on 2002-04-15T20:57:01</h3>
<p>I'd have to agree with Jim Carrey as Murdoch, though unlike the rest of the cast Dwight Schultz could probably still do his part just fine.</p>
<p>Michael Clarke Duncan would make a convincing B.A. Perhaps Ben Affleck to play the part of "Face"? The hardest to pick would be the Colonel, of course. My first thought is Anthony Hopkins, but he's a little British to be a US Army vet. Maybe Donald Sutherland?</p>

<h2>Quick Entry</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Purdy/">Purdy</a> on 2002-04-15T21:19:26</h3>
Like word association - not much thought:
<p>
<b>Hannibal:</b> Willam Defoe<br>
<b>Face:</b> Pierce Brosnan<br>
<b>B.A.:</b> Mr. T (I pity the fool that tries to replace him<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;))<br>
<b>Merdoch:</b> John Malkovich<br>
</p><p>
Jason</p>



<h2>A Team meets Star Trek</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/belg4mit/">belg4mit</a> on 2002-04-15T22:16:45</h3>
For some reason..<br> <br>I think Patrick Stewart could pull off Hannibal.<br>Lieutenant Barkley would make a good Merdoch.<br>Michael Dorn as B.A. Tom Paris (Voyager<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-/) as Face.



<h2>Hmm</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/vek/">vek</a> on 2002-04-15T22:23:45</h3>
Lets see now:<br> <br> <b>Murdoch</b>:  Dwight Schultz<br> <b>Hannibal</b>: Alan Alda<br> <b>Face</b>:     Rob Lowe or Hugh Jackman       <br> <b>BA</b>:       Michael Dorn (<a href="http://use.perl.org/user/belg4mit/" title="perl.org">belg4mit</a perl.org>++)<br>



<h2>We used to play this game.</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/ct/">ct</a> on 2002-04-16T13:24:15</h3>
I've had long conversations with friends, usually over cards and involving intoxication, about this very issue.<p>

(btw, I'm afraid this won't be very original, as everyone else seems to have already mentioned mine)</p><p>

For me, the only one I can see as Hannibal is Anthony Hopkins.</p><p>

B.A. is a tough cast. Do you try to imitate Mr. T, chains, mohawk and all? I'd recommend no. I see a guy like Michael Clark Duncan or Ving Rhames doing well.</p><p>

The Face. It's hard to classify what Dirk Benedict was in the 80's. I guess he was supposed to be sexy. I do like the Ben Affleck suggestion someone had, that hadn't occurred to me. My thought was Matthew McConahay.</p><p>

Ahh yes, Murdock. This is the hardest role to cast. It can't be Jim Carrey, he'll just be, well, Jim Carrey. I know it sounds odd, but after recent viewings of 12 Monkeys and Fight Club, I lean a bit towards Brad Pitt in this role. He's proven he can be the on the edge lunatic. The other way to go might be Ben Stiller, though I wonder if he'd be able to disappear from the screen, of if he'd be just "Oh, look, Ben Stiller."</p><p>

Just to be complete...</p><p>

<b>Airwolf:</b> <br>
Stringfellow Hawk: Ewan McGregor<br>
Dominic Santini: John Rhys-Davies or Danny DeVito<br>
Archangel: Donald Sutherland</p><p>

<b>Knight Rider:</b> <br>
Michael Knight: Hugh Jackman<br>
Devon Miles: Michael Caine<br>
Voice of KITT: Anthony Hopkins<br>
Mechanic Chick: Sandra Bullock</p><p>

And the biggie...</p><p>

<b>Dukes of Hazzard:</b> <br>
Bo Duke: Matthew McConahay<br>
Luke Duke:<nobr> <wbr></nobr>....</p><p>

This one stumps me...</p>



<h2>Hm</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/pudge/">pudge</a> on 2002-04-16T15:45:02</h3>
Hannibal could be Tommy Lee Jones.<br> <br>Or Samuel L. Jackson.
