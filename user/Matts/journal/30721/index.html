<h1>Image resizing for a gallery using Imager</h1>

<div class="span8">
<p>I don't know if I've lamented on this blog before about the performance of image resizing (using Imager) for my gallery. It takes about 5 or 6 seconds to fully resize an image from 3000x2000 down to 800 pixels wide. That's because Imager uses a bicubic (I think) smoothing algorithm to make the resize look nice. If you use the "preview" quality type it's MUCH faster, but the results are horrible.<br/><br/>Ever had one of those moments lying in bed where you think: "I wonder if this would work?". I used to have those and forget them, so I now keep a pad of paper and pen by the bed and write them down. This morning it was the following algorithm:
<pre>
    # resize $file of type $type to $size, put data in $out
    
    my $image = Imager->new;
    $image->open(file => $file)
        or die $image->errstr();<br/><br/>    my($w, $h) = ($image->getwidth(), $image->getheight());
    
    my $doublesize = $size < (($w > $h ? $w : $h)/2);
    
    if ($doublesize) {
        $self->log(LOGINFO, "Doing an initial shrinkage in preview mode");
        my $thumb = $image->scale(qtype => "preview",
                                  $w > $h ? (xpixels => $w/2)
                                          : (ypixels => $h/2)
                                 );
        
        $image = $thumb;
    }
    
    my $thumb = $image->scale(qtype => "normal", 
                               $w > $h ?
                                   (xpixels => $size)
                                 : (ypixels => $size)
                             );
    
    if ($doublesize) {
        $self->log(LOGINFO, "sharpening $thumb");
        
        # Sharpen a bit with a convolve filter
        $thumb->filter(
            type=>'conv',
            coef => [-0.2, 1, -0.2]
            );
    }
    
    $thumb->write(data => $out, type => $type)
        or die "Cannot write to scalar: ", $thumb->errstr;
</pre>
Resizes now happen within about a second or so. Not as fast as Epeg, but the results are a LOT prettier.</p>

<h2>Reading code</h2>

<p>That&#8217;s a nice snippet. It would have been easier to follow a prose description though: &#8220;if the image is more than twice as large as the target resolution, use <code>preview</code> mode to quickly cut it in half before downsizing normally, and then sharpen the result a bit afterwards.&#8221;</p>

<p>Anyway, I&#8217;m filing this idea away.</p>

sorry - I should have added a description.<br><br>Still, it made you read the code<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)

<h2>Tried Imlib2?</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Simon/">Simon</a> on 2006-08-22T22:04:14</h3>
Memories supports resizing with Imager if it has to, but prefers Image::Imlib2, which is lightning-fast for image resizes. So much so that it generates the resized versions of pictures on the fly without noticable performance degradation.

I haven't. Harder to install? I guess it requires libimlib2...

I installed it from distro packages and of course didn't have any trouble, on both Debian and CentOS.

<p>I was recently planning to switch an app from ImageMagick to Imlib2 for thumbnails and wrote a benchmark to see how much improvement I would get.  I just added Imager for comparison:</p>

<code>
          Rate  imager  magick preview  imlib2<br>
imager  4.92/s      --     -2%    -64%    -82%<br>
magick  5.04/s      2%      --    -63%    -81%<br>
preview 13.5/s    174%    168%      --    -50%<br>
imlib2  26.8/s    445%    432%     99%      --<br>
</code>

<p>So, Imlib2 is faster than even Imager's preview mode.  Of course Imager does a lot of things that Imlib2 doesn't but for thumbnails, Imlib2 is the fastest.</p>

<p>P.S. Why can't I use pre tags here?</p>

Use &lt;ecode&gt; tags<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br><br>Thanks - looks like I need to investigate Imlib2.<br><br>I suppose working on Win32 is too much to ask.

The next release of Imager will add a new scaling qtype that's faster than normal but better quality than preview.  It's still slower than I like.
