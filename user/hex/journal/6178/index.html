Tuesday was the occasion of the first <a href="http://london.pm.org/mailman/listinfo/bots">bots list</a> meetup. The same people as usual, although in a different context: acme, alexr, blech, hex, hitherto, mattb (one of the <a href="http://pants.heddley.com/">pants</a> people, who I was meeting for the first time), mbm, muttley, Trelane, Yoz, zool, and a bloke at the other end of the table who I didn't know and whose name I didn't catch.
</p>
<p>
The meet happened at the <a href="http://grault.net/cgi-bin/grubstreet.pl?The_Hen_And_Chickens,_N1_2NA">Hen and Chickens</a> pub in Islington, mainly because it's next door to Trelane and muttley's digs, and their <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/internetnews/story/0,7369,740754,00.html">data cloud</a> extends into it, so you can get bandwidth there if you have a laptop with a wireless card. Which, of course, several people did.
</p>
<p>
The conversation was of a high quality, and very interesting. However, asking me to remember what people said in a conversation the night before is like trying to reconstruct cinders into a piece of wood. So I shan't. In addition to that, my range of hearing in noisy places like pubs is very small - on the order of about three feet. So most of the time I couldn't hear anything except the two or three people nearest to me. Luckily, Trelane <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/2shortplanks/journal/6166">has a better memory</a>. 
</p>
<p>
One thing I can remember, as Trelane mentions, is that I showed him (using acme's shiny iBook) the code I was writing for an IRC bot that will put things onto a <a href="http://www.wikipedia.com/wiki/What+is+a+wiki">wiki</a>. It wasn't in much of a state at that point: I had some code that connected to a wiki, HTTP GET'ed the content of a page and POSTed something back, and some other code that connected to an IRC server and sat on a channel; I still had to tie it together. He told me about his <a href="http://twoshortplanks.com/bots/basic/">basic bot framework</a>.
</p>
<p>
After closing time the several of us who were still there went next door - if you were paying attention, you know where that is - and had pizza. Some people played Halo on the Xbox, which I hadn't seen before. Very shiny indeed. (It looked familiar, and I couldn't work out why; then I realised that it was because the game had been developed by <a href="http://www.bungie.com/">Bungie Studios</a>, who did <a href="http://www.bungie.com/products/marathon/marathon.htm">Marathon</a> for the Mac way back when. I can't believe that that was <em>seven years ago</em>, to be honest. I was fifteen. A kid. Hell, I'm hardly an adult now, but still, that was an eternity ago.)
</p>
<p>
At some late point people started going home, and Yoz kindly offered to give someone a lift. I had code rattling around my skull, and really needed to get it out; zool offered the use of bandwidth and a sofabed in the place in Chalk Farm where she was staying (I guess you could call her an itinerant programmer), and I accepted. Yoz drove us over and then vanished into the night.
</p>
<p>
Inside the flat, on the lower ground floor of a house facing a church, zool made some tea, set up her laptop (also called yoz - don't ask) for me to use and then promptly fell into a coma-like sleep. I worked on my bot, and at about 3:30am I had managed to get it working. Taking this as a good sign, I pulled out the sofabed and fell asleep, listening to the rain sound like a river outside the window.</p>
