pause.perl.org uses an invalid security certificate.

The certificate is not trusted because it is self signed.

Luckily it - I'm using FF 3.0b4 - has a very nice new mechanism that lets you add an exception for specific servers, but really I don't think we should be seeing this in the first place... could our lovely PAUSE people please fix this?

The problem is that the certificate is self-signed. FF3 just has a different dialogue for approving such a cert, but all browser will prompt you about it.<br>

No, I'm not paying for it<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-) Sorry if this post came across as ungrateful.
<p>
Hmm. Well, I'm really no expert in the field of authentication, encryption and so on. I was just taken aback a little by the wording of the error message, mainly the word "invalid".
</p><p>
It would be a nice gesture if some Perl-friendly organization would certify PAUSE, like <a href="http://wire.dattitu.de/archives/2005/05/29/Securing-KDEs-bugs.html" title="dattitu.de">GoDaddy did for KDE</a dattitu.de>.</p>

GoDaddy seem willing to do it for any open source project <a href="https://www.godaddy.com/gdshop/ssl/ssl_opensource.asp?ci=5988" title="godaddy.com">https://www.godaddy.com/gdshop/ssl/ssl_opensource.asp?ci=5988</a godaddy.com>

I'm just saying nothing's changed except the browser's handling of self-signed certs. Admittedly, that change is rather jarring, since it looks a lot like a "failed to connect to server" error, as opposed to the old "insecure cert" popup.<br><br>The GoDaddy option does seem like a good one.<br>

<p>
Yep. I just got it for rt.cpan.org as well and it surprised me again.
</p>
<i>The GoDaddy option does seem like a good one.</i>
<p>
Indeed. I shall try and find someone to bring it to their attention.</p>

There are other ways to get a free cert: <a href="http://cert.startcom.org/" title="startcom.org">http://cert.startcom.org/</a startcom.org>

<p>Thanks for the heads up!</p>

<p>On Sat Apr 19 2008 PAUSE will switch to a <b>cacert </b> certificate. Please
<a href="http://pause.perl.org/pause/query?ACTION=pause_04about#ssl" title="perl.org">prepare your browser</a perl.org>.</p>
