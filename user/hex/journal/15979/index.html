Today I uploaded <a
href="http://search.cpan.org/user/emartin/Locale-Object-0.1/">Locale::Object
0.1</a> to CPAN. The point of this little collection of modules is to be able to pass information about countries and what currencies they use, what their ISO identifiers are and so on around as objects.
</p>
<p>
I'm very happy to have got this done. It marks a personal watershed; the modules' data source is a DBD::SQLite database, which is the first time I've written any code to use one. In fact, in the last week I've learnt both SQL and recursive object structures in Perl. The modules are being released as part of <a href="http://opensource.fotango.com/">Fotango's open source program</a>; it's also the first time I've ever done any professional programming. It's been exciting.
</p>
<p>
I've been working here at Fotango for about six months now. The effects of having a job that includes Perl on a day-to-day basis are really starting to show - I've written more Perl here than I ever have before. I started trying to learn something like two years ago, so I'm wondering if I've now hit the steeper part of the sigmoid curve of Perl knowledge accumulation. I see good times ahead.

Woot. I had visualised some kind of Buddha-like state of total knowledge eventually... then I guess it's more of a <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WabiSabi" title="c2.com">Wabi Sabi</a c2.com> thing. Onwards and upwards!
