<h1>Problem with numeric scalars in an SQLite DB</h1>

<div class="span8">
<p>My module <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Locale-Object/">Locale::Object</a> comes with an accompanying SQLite database that contains a bunch of locale information. Since I released it, SQLite has had a <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/version3.html">major upgrade from v2.8 to v3.0</a> and the database format has completely changed. So, I'm in the process of making a new release with a db file in the new format. (I should have done this earlier, actually, since I've had a couple of emails about it. My apologies to anyone I've inconvenienced.)
<p>
Thing is, I've hit a problem. The process of dumping the old database and reading it into the new format by doing <tt>sqlite OLD.DB .dump | sqlite3 NEW.DB</tt> worked just fine. However, some of my data changed.
<p>
Some of the tables in the db contain a bunch of three-digit ISO codes used to identify countries and so on. Quite a few of these codes start with a zero. On checking the newly created database with sqlite, though, I discovered that all the leading zeroes had vanished.
<p>
Talking to DrForr on <tt>#perl</tt>, I discovered that SQLite now has <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/datatype3.html">a concept of column types</a>, and so I recreated the tables in question, changing the columns to be <tt>TEXT char(3)</tt>, thinking that this restriction would force it not to consider the values as numbers. But that didn't work:
<p>
<code>
foreach (@rows)<br>
{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;my ($code_alpha2, $code_alpha3, $code_numeric, $name, $dialling_code) = @{$_};<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;# Yes, this is crap, but I don't care right now:<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;$code_numeric = '0'  . $code_numeric if length($code_numeric) == 2;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;$code_numeric = '00' . $code_numeric if length($code_numeric) == 1;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;print "country: $code_alpha2 / $code_numeric\n" if $code_numeric =~ /^0/;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;my $sth_update = $dbh_new->prepare("INSERT INTO country VALUES (?,?,?,?,?)");<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;$sth_update->execute($code_alpha2, $code_alpha3, $code_numeric, $name, $dialling_code);<br>
}<br>
</code>
<p>
The kind of stuff that gets printed to STDOUT is <tt>country: bm / 060</tt>, but when I check the database in sqlite, it says <tt>bm|bmu|60|Bermuda|1441</tt>. Still stripping the zeroes!
<p>
I've tried a few different approaches, but none have worked. Leon suggested overloading "" to force stringification(?), but I'm finding it extremely hard to understand either what <tt>perldoc overload</tt> or the Camel have to say about overloading.
<p>
Can any of you help?
</p>

Warning: I know nothing about SQLite!<br> <br>However, sometimes I've had something similar happen when using DBI and trying to convince MySQL to store data a specific way. (For example, when you have an enum column type with a value of '1' as a possible entry. You can also deal with enum columns by position and sometimes MySQL thinks you want the first enum value.)<br> <br>How I overcome it is by "forcing" the datatype like so:<blockquote> <div> <tt>&nbsp; $string . ''</tt> </div> </blockquote>Use this instead of $string where you want it to specifically be considered text.<br> <br>Likewise, something like this:<blockquote> <div> <tt>&nbsp; $number + 0</tt> </div> </blockquote>Seems to force the value of $number to be treated as a number.<br> <br>HTH

No dice. Thanks for the idea though.
