Okay, this is hardly on a par with the Pugs diaries, but then again I'm not a fucking scary genius like Audrey. Bear that in mind, sunshine, alright?
</p>
<p>
Anyway. After another six or so hours of hacking away on and off I now have a super-basic photo album system working, complete with tags. Although at present if you want to put photos <em>into</em> it you have to do it with SQL. By hand. But it works. Obviously sorting out out a tool for that is the next step.
</p>
<p>
My to-do list after that:
</p>
<ul>
<li>thumbnailing on upload</li>
<li>use real templating system instead of Just Printing Shit Directly</li>
<li>better URLs, none of this x.cgi?foo=bar rubbish</li>
<li>per-directory and per-photo annotation</li>
<li>RSS feeds: all photos, per-tag</li>
</ul>
<p>
Talking of SQL, I discovered on the way that SQLite changed binary database formats again in January. Of course, the way I discovered it was an SQLite error message: "<tt>unsupported file format(1) at dbdimp.c</tt>". This caused me no small confusion, since I'd created the database with a freshly-downloaded <tt>sqlite3</tt> binary. I eventually found out via careful Googling that the format had changed and worked out that I needed a newer DBD::SQLite. But honestly, how hard would it have been for the SQLite guy(s[?]) to implement some form of version number parameter in the format? An error saying "This database was created by a newer version of SQLite" would have been <em>much</em> more helpful.

* This is my thrilling code name for the project. "use PhotoThing;" - so elegant, no? (Er, no. - Ed.)

<h2>Distributable SQLite files...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/Alias/">Alias</a> on 2006-04-15T23:26:36</h3>
OK, so SQLite files are forwards-compatible.<br><br>And yet DBD::SQLite keeps upgrading to meet the new versions.<br><br>What I've love would be a DBD::PublishableSQLite, so that I could generate SQLite database using oldest version of SQLite compatible with the current version, and then anyone with anything newer could read it.<br>



<h2>compatibility</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jerakeen/">jerakeen</a> on 2006-04-16T10:18:48</h3>
I thought the only change was to BLOB columns. What are you putting in BLOBs for a <i>gallery</i> application?
<p>Also, I really like Image::Imlib2 for generating thumbnails. Way nicer to use than ImageMagick.</p>

Oh, I'm not using BLOBs. I just had the confusing situation of DBD::SQLite apparently not recognising a database created by the latest version of the sqlite3 app.
<p>
Thanks for the tip - I'll definitely check out Image::Imlib2.
</p><p>
Oh, and thanks again for many happy years of YAPI.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<h2>Maybe use F-Spot?</h2>

<a href="http://f-spot.org/Main_Page" title="f-spot.org">F-Spot</a f-spot.org> has a *very* nice gui for this already.  If you could get that to export its information to a database, then you'd have it...
