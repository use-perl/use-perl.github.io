<p>A while back I put my CV on <a href="http://jobsite.com/">Jobsite</a> because all the recruiters read it and there's plenty of good work to be found. In due course it got me a good gig. However, shortly after that I started getting recruitment spam from some company called <a href="http://www.huxley.com/">Huxley Associates</a>. For PHP jobs. As you can imagine, I didn't ask for it. Nor had I ever heard of them, let alone subscribed to any kind of mailings from them. Somewhere I found that to unsubscribe from their spam, you had to mail a certain address. Here's what I sent:

<pre>
Date: Mon, 10 Sep 2007 15:17:43 +0100
From: "Earle Martin" <jobs(at)downlode.org>
To: audit.data(at)huxley.com
Subject: Data removal request

Please remove my name and email address (jobs(at)downlode.org) from your
system and do not email me again.
</pre>

Here's what I just found in my inbox:

[Pound signs replaced with "GBP" because I can't work out how to get this hateful piece of software to display HTML entities.]
</p>
Yes, that's eight pieces of spam in less than fifteen minutes. On a Sunday. Please boycott Huxley Associates. They are spammers.</p>

This stupid cow has been spamming for ages, and admits it if you phone her.  I grumbled about her in <a href="http://www.cantrell.org.uk/david/journal/index.pl/id_idiot-recruiters" title="cantrell.org.uk">January</a cantrell.org.uk>.  In my case, she was trying to sell me people with irrelevant skills, and had obviously either guessed the address or used one that someone else had given her.
