<div class="span8">
<p>Recently I had to implement a SOAP client and a SOAP server. Well, I didn't actually have to, I volunteered. Shows how stupid I am.<br/><br/>I will start with the conclusion. Note that this is my opinion, others may disagree, but Perl and SOAP don't match. Not quite yet, at least. I mean, SOAP is designed by a committe and adopted by the Java community and Microsoft. I can't imagine anything more developer unfriendly. In the other corner we have our more or less relaxed Ã¢â¬ÅWe can do itÃ¢â¬Â Perl. But I found hope. More on that later.<br/><br/>My last visit to SOAP in Perl land was some 5-6 years ago when the World was young and Perl land was unstructured as Hell. (Actually I don't know if Hell is unstructured or not, perhaps it's written in Java. That would make sense, I guess). <br/><br/>But I digress. At that time there was only one real choice if I recall, SOAP::Lite. The Ã¢â¬ÅLiteÃ¢â¬Â in SOAP::Lite is a misnomer. Perhaps it started out as Lite, but now it just feels big and bumpy.
Actually, as far as I can see, SOAP::Lite really only supports RPC/Encoded. The documentation mentions partial support for Document/Literal but I believe it's not really there.<br/><br/>RPC/Encoded doesn't really fit the bill if you want well structured schema based remote actions, so for this Catalyst project, so I was aiming for RPC/Literal. There's also Document/Literal, but RPC/Literal fits almost exactly together with Catalyst's Component model.<br/><br/>I've already complained about SOAP::Lite, but fortunately there's a new module that can compile schemas and apply them to SOAP. XML::Compile from Mark Overmeer seems like a fresh breeze of air and just understands the SOAP protocol.<br/><br/>Daniel Ruoso has built Catalyst::Model::SOAP and Catalyst::Component::SOAP on top of XML::Compile in order to help build Catalyst applications easier. I would add that the Model part feels almost finished. The Controller bit needs a lot in the SOAP Envelope packing/unpacking. But at least it got me going.<br/><br/>Developer pain.
Some of you may know already Ã¢â¬â and somewhere in a dark spot in my mind I had it stored Ã¢â¬â that you need a WSDL file when doing SOAP.  Wouldn't it be nice to have a tool to write it for you? My hopes where high when I found Pod::WSDL on CPAN. It's a really nice idea to embed the parameter and type informaion in the methods Pod. But again, Pod::WSDL can only output RPC/Encoded. <br/><br/>Now, WSDL files are not hard to hand write if you know what you are doing, it's just a tedious and error prone task. So if you have some spare time, pick up Pod::WSDL (it's unmaintained at the moment) and add RPC/Literal and Document/Literal. The source code looks well laid out and easy to understand. Please implement a more economic solution for complex types. If each complex type really relly needs its own package, at least make Pod::WSDL find it within one file.<br/><br/>As an added benefit, by implementing SOAP in the Catalyst application I got rid of Catalyst::Plugin::XMLRPC. That's a good thing because it had a mysterious habit of leaving all the requests as open files. I mean A LOT, it could be thousands, depending on how busy the 'webservices' bit was.<br/><br/>I have plans to extend Catalyst::Controller::SOAP with some SOAP Envelope unpacking and response handling based on the wsdl file. When I get time...

I guess SOAP::Lite is as lite as SOAP is simple and object oriented.

A number of years ago I did a presentation called "Why SOAP Sucks, Why SOAP Sucks!". At the start of it I had enough paper to contain all the specs required to fully understand SOAP (XML, SOAP, WSDL, UDDI, XML-Schemas, and possibly something else)... The entire thing comes to just over 1000 pages.<br><br>Anyone who can understand all that and build an interoperable system deserves a medal. Sadly there is nobody who does.

Heh. Exactly my feeling<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)<br><br>I gave up understanding why namespaces are called <a href="http://something/" title="something">http://something/</a something> (apparantly Microsoft calls them <a href="http://tempuri/" title="tempuri">http://tempuri/</a tempuri> by default). It doesn't point to anything, and it's generally confusing.

<p>Because namespaces are URIs, and that in turn is because those are (generally) globally unique identifiers. That&#8217;s all. In the context of namespaces the URI doesn&#8217;t have any meaning beyond being a unique identifier. That&#8217;s fine, as URIs don&#8217;t have to be retrievable, even those with schemes you&#8217;re used to thinking of as retrievable, such as &#8220;<code>http:</code>&#8221;. You can use any other scheme though. For namespaces I like to use &#8220;<code>tag:</code>&#8221; when I don&#8217;t plan to put anything at the address in question.</p>

Your ears must have been burning, because only a few hours ago I posted a question about <a href="http://perlmonks.org/?node_id=670330" title="perlmonks.org"> SOAP on perlmonks </a perlmonks.org>). I'm also planning to use Catalyst::Controller::SOAP and XML::Compile, and had the exact same questions about generating the server side response. I'd love to collaborate with you on the C::C::SOAP changes you mentioned, if you like. Email me at drew at drewtaylor dot com.
