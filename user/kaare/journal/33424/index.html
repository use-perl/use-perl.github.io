<p>I bought a new car last Tuesday. Well, it's a used car, but new to me :-)<br/><br/>I discovered that more than 95% of my driving is for business purposes. Either to and from a client, purchasing items or delivering these items to customers.<br/><br/>So I needed a bigger car than my trusty old Seat Cordoba. I've been looking for the right choice for over a year now, but didn't find the right combination of price, size, and service cost.<br/><br/>Recently I learned that a Toyota HiAce with 9 seats exists as an option for me with an ordinary driver's license. I found one in Jylland (some 450 kilometers away) and bought it after advice from my Nephew. He's very interested in cars, always updated and is educated as a Car mechanic.<br/><br/>Me? I see cars as a tool for getting from A to B. Of course some cars have better design, smarter features than others. But the price impact is almost always too great. Especially with the Danish tax system that has implemented the great "Take one, pay three" offer.<br/><br/>I have to get used to two things. First, it's with automatic gear. I've never tried this until now, but apart from a restless right arm, it's great.
Secondly, the new car is BIG! It's one meter longer than the Cordoba. The difference in plain traffic isn't that big. But when parking, or when space is limited, it's another story.<br/><br/>Impact to the environment was also a factor to consider, and one reason it took so long to decide on a car. But I had to admit to myself that we couldn't do without.</p>
