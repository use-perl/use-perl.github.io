<p>I'm writing this journal from my new laptop, an Acer Aspire 5920. This thing has a dual processor Intel CPU, 2 GB RAM, and all the ports and connectivity we are getting used to (4 USB, Infrared, Bluetooth, 811.G wifi. etc).<br/><br/>Actually it has the first laptop keyboard I feel comfortable with. Only missing is the separate numeric keypad.
It even comes with a webcam, so I can see them when I chat with friends and family.<br/><br/>The most encouraging is that OpenSUSE 10.3 installed with almost no problem. Only wifi sent me googling for a couple of minutes.<br/><br/>Using wifi is still a little strange though. I had to switch from Network Manager to ifup/down. I don't quite understand what the problem is, but if I try to connect with Network Manager, it doesn't get an IP address. I could experiment with fixed addresses; perhaps I'll do that one day.<br/><br/>Overall I'm impressed what you're getting for your money these days. A new laptop with very competitive hardware for DKK 5,000.- (around EUR 665,-).<br/><br/>I had to buy a new laptop because my 3-year old one suddenly began to turn off completely after being on for only a couple of minutes. And these days it's easier (and probably cheaper) to buy a new and much stronger computer.<br/><br/>So I've been tinkering with this for the last couple of days, restoring relevant data from my old and customizing it the way I like it. A rather big job :-)</p>

You said<p><div class="quote">I had to buy a new laptop because my 3-year old one suddenly began to turn off completely after being on for only a couple of minutes.</div> That's the protection against CPU overheating.<br><br>I've <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/bart/journal/25398" title="perl.org">had the same problem</a perl.org> (only not <em>that</em> bad yet): with me, it was dust in the chimneys.<br><br>Just open up the laptop, and check the cooling system for dust, and clean it out with a vacuum cleaner? I assume that will solve the problem &mdash; at least, if the fan actually works.

I did try that with no result, alas. I suspect the CPU fan or the fan for the Graphics Adapter, but I didn't put too much effort into it.<br><br>Anyway, I was already considering a new laptop before the event. After all, it's my main tool in my consulting business, so it should perform reasonably.<br><br>And a three year old laptop with 512 MB RAM is simply antiquated now. The development in this area has been impressive for the last three years!
