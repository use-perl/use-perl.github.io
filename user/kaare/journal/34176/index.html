<p>How dificult is this!<br/><br/>I need a new PC, mainly for coding Perl. Well, "need" may not exactly be the correct term, but when the laptop reacts with a rubber like response and is getting warm enough to keep the coffee warm, at least I have a wish for something better, more productive.<br/><br/>I'm that kind of person who doesn't really care about hardware. Only checking the price / performance and features whenever I need a new thing of some kind.<br/><br/>So to see that I can get an Athlon 64 Dual Core 5000, 2 GB RAM and a harddisk that could have acted as a data center 10 years ago for a few thousaned DKK makes the heart beat faster and eyes glimpse extra.<br/><br/>Wasn't it only for Perl coding, you say? Well, my experience tells me that it's better to overshoot the current target if I want to be happy with the computer for a couple of years. And that is my plan.<br/><br/>But of course we have the old fashioned snake in this Paradise. Of course I will be running Linux, and out of habit I'm checking compatibility, believing that no problems remain.<br/><br/>Perhaps I'm getting too close to the problems, perhaps I just took chances in the past. But I'm surprised to hear about motherboards not supporting Linux, sound and wireless devices not being recognized and more.<br/><br/>Graphic adapters are the classic problem, but AFAICS most cards from the leading vendors work right out of the box. At least GeForce seems to be well covered.<br/><br/>And then I need to decide if I will build it myself (either a kit or assemble all parts from different shops) or buy a ready-to-use computer.<br/><br/>What do you think?<br/><br/>Investigating the different combinations already cost me a lot of time. But at least it's great fun :-)</p>
