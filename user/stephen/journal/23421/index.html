<p>Ahh, glorious...
<p>Today my Prius arrived at the local dealership. I'd been waiting for it since about last May.
<p>I've got to say that the biggest pleasure is in using something extremely well-designed. The keyless entry and ignition system, so that you don't need to fumble for keys in the rain. The built-in Bluetooth. This is a car built by engineers who worked hard to understand how people actually use their cars. 
<p>And, of course, the hybrid drive system. When this car stops at a stoplight, it <strong>stops</strong>. No idle motor. Nothing is consumed. I could probably wedge the brake pedal, leave it there for a week, and then get back in and drive away without any problems. Most people measure efficiency in terms of miles per gallon, but consider how much time, in the course of our driving careers, we spend stopped at stoplights, stop signs, in traffic, or in drive-throughs.
<p>So after six hours I still love it. Of course, it's been raining steadily all evening, so I've only gotten to drive it around a bit and sit around in the driveway making "vroom vroom" noises.
<p>Ok, I didn't make "vroom vroom" noises. But only because I was imagining it in electric mode.</p>

<h2>New Prius, Old Prius</h2>

I'm glad you're enjoying your new car.  I have the 2001 model, and I'm thinking about trading it in for a 2005.  I test drove the new one and like it lots.
<p>
The biggest thing I miss is that I can't fold down the back seat in my version.  Also, the new version has better suspension and gets better mileage.
</p><p>
The console controls I'm not so sure about.  I think they violate KISS, but it's something I could get over.</p>

I found the console defog controls immediately after I grumbled to myself that it was too inconvenient to turn on the defogs through the touch screen while trying to back out of my driveway. The overall effect was that of Japanese engineers precognitively  reading my mind. I was impressed.

I like my 2004 Prius very much.<p>

I wasn't able to get the navigation system and Bluetooth, because at the time I got mine the dealer had 3 coming in, and 2 were already pre-sold.  I took what I could get, to avoid the wait you are
just finishing up.</p><p>

My only complaint is that my package didn't include a cassette player, and I haven't found an FM transmitter for my iPod that works very well in the car.</p><p>
