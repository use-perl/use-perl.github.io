<p><p>
A couple of days ago I wrote an entry titled <b>Problem Learning Perl</b>. It was a bit embarrassing and probably whiny but I got solid results from it. A number of people were kind enough to reply explaining the things I was having trouble with. I thank them all again.</p>
<p>
I found out several informative facts about Perl and how to use it. I also found out something about myself. I am visually-impaired Perlwise. What I see and what is written are not actually the same in some cases(maybe in many cases, I haven't asked about everything that puzzles me).</p>
<p>
The reason for the impairment is partly the languages I have used in the past. In all of them spacing is <b>important</b>. In Cobol, nothing <i>runs together</i>. This is a new concept that is still foggy for me. I am slowly learning what 'free-form' actually means.</p>
<p>
The rest of my problem is me. Like a lot of people, I see what I want to see and I can be pretty stubborn about it. I can change my view of Perl by study and hard work. I am not so sure changing me will be that easy.</p>
<p>
I want to thank <b>htoug</b> and <b>jbisbee</b> for becoming Fans. The concept of Fans is very strange to me, but I do appreciate the fact.</p></p>

I - like several others here - become fan of the people whose journals I want to read. Ie. the people whose journals in some way look as if they may be rewarding to read.<br>
On this site it means nearly everyone.<p>
I would be nice to have had a feature like <cite>Notify me of every new journal except the ones I specifically don't want</cite>, but becvoming a fan of (nearly) everyone does almost the same, and sends a nice signal to the journaliser (or whatever you call the one who write the journal).</p><p>
