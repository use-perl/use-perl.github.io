<p>As a nation, this probably affects us more than any other. Not that any first world country is immune, but I am sure the curse hits us the hardest.<br/><br/>What am I talking about? Succintly put, moving our junk to a new place. Americans have to have more junk than any people on earth. I am no exception, I am a pack rat <I>extraordinaire</i>, expecially concerning books.<br/><br/>I just got through moving to a new, bigger house with a new, bigger basement. I threw away literally a ton of stuff. Pickup truck-loads and trailer-loads of worthless crap. I stored boxes and boxes of books. And finally we are all moved in.<br/><br/>So why do I have [b]more[/b] than I started with. The new, bigger basement is an obstacle course, mostly of boxes, but also unpacked gear. My wife complains about not having cabinet space in the kitchen ([i]but, Honey, you said this kitchen was bigger![/i]).<br/><br/>Heracles' labors in the Augean Stables were a quick sweep-up compared to this move. And it is nothing special. I am sure that most or all of you have done the same. Stood looking at the packed boxes to be muled to the truck or car and thought to yourself, '[i]Where did all this crap come from?[/i]'<br/><br/>It came from years of saving stuff you couldn't use but just knew would come in handy someday. It came from the things your realtives left you or gave you. It came from stuff friends dumped on you that maybe you could use but they didn't need. It came from all those things you bought and now think '[i]Why the hell did I buy [b]that[/b]?[/i]'<br/><br/>My universal remedy is...[b]don't do that[/b]. Don't buy it, don't keep it, don't let others lay it on you. Be hard, be stern, be coldand most of all, don't be like me because I haven't done any of it.</p>
