We got about 2 inches of snow here over an inch of ice so we didn't go out today. This is the Sunny South where snow you can actually see on the ground constitutes a state of emergency. Besides, going out on the roads is dangerous. People down here cause wrecks when it rains hard, much less when it snows. And by the way, this isn't some yankee talking. I was born and raised here and lived here almost all of my life.</p>
<p>
Anyway I spent most of the day reading <i>Programming Perl</i>. After all this time on Perl Monks and reading other books I think I might be getting some good out of it. Not that I am in danger of turning into a <b>PERL GURU</b>, but I think I made a little progress. I can only hope. I bought a copy after the one I bought through Amazon turned out to be the 2nd. edition(independent seller, not directly from Amazon). <i>Caveat suckor</i>.</P>
<p>
Thankfully there was nothing on TV to distract me. Even CSI:Miami was a repeat. Does anyone think Caruso becomes a pompous windbag at times. I don't know if it is him or the writers speaking through him. Oh well, it's only TV.</p>
<p>
I think I mentioned in my last entry that I am getting ready to move in a month or so. Things are being sorted and thrown away and packed in boxes already. But nothing will move until the loan is approved. One of those many sheets I signed for the loan was certainly a contract with the Devil. If not him somebody must own my soul now. There was no way I read all of them. I have signed so much paper that a Giant Sequoia must have died to provide it all. If I don't get the loan I'll sue'm for Repetitive Stress Injury.</p>
<p>
Of course I can't afford a moving company to come in and whisk this junk all magically away. We may be able to afford to rent a large truck for one day to pack the big items in and take them to the new house. That will be the extent of it though. Only furniture and appliances will go then. The rest will go by carload and pickup truck over time. Maybe I should get a dumptruck for easy unloading of the big stuff.</p></p>

<h2>CSI: Miami</h2>

It's a combination of the writers and Caruso's tendency to overact -- but, to their credit, the writers have written the character to play off Caruso's strengths as an actor.  Horatio tends to be overemotional, Caruso overacts a little...Horatio seems to be everywhere, Caruso's fairly energetic on the screen.
<p>
I think the most charitable thing that could be said about the contrast in main characters was that the producers decided that they wanted to make a complement to Griss -- a CSI for people who may or may not like the characters in Vegas.
</p><p>
The other thing, though -- both shows do enough procedural stuff that if you're purely interested in the scientific/investigative aspects, you can still watch both of them and get enough of that.
</p><p>
I've heard rumors of a CSI: New York, but I've also heard that NY wants it shot in New York.  My SO remarked that there's an awful lot of people running around New York already acting like cops (all the L&amp;O series, NYPD Blue, etc.) and I worry someday that there will be a terrible accident involving a lot of confused identities.  (That, or else there'll be so many actors doing cop shows in NY that there will be <em>shows</em> about actors doing cop shows...)</p>
