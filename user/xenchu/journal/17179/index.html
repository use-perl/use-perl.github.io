I sprang from bed this morning with a song in my heart...not really. I drug out after a lousy night of no sleep. It might be insomnia, it might be nerves but basically it means I don't sleep.</p>
<p>
As usual when that happens I got on and read PerlMonks and Use Perl and one or two other sites. Just to keep my mind from jumping around too much, trying to get sleepy enough to go back to sleep. Didn't work. Even taking a shower didn't work this time. My day at work yesterday was less than stellar. It will be incentive to have a better day so I can get some sleep tonight.</p>
<p>
I was reading Programming Perl(3rd.ed.) last night (<i>that</i> almost put me to sleep) and realized that I would have to reread the whole damn book to pick up what I missed the first time. Either that or pick another book to read first. Maybe try <b>merlyn</b>'s Learning Perl Objects, References and Modules. Or Learning Perl? Still, if I don't understand the subject in Programming Perl then I don't fancy my chances with a different book. I don't consider Learning Perl a simpler or easier book. There is, of course, the possibility that I am too thick to understand it from any book. I'll have to think on that one.</p>
<p>
Oh well, time to go to work. We were supposed to have freezing rain last night but that missed us. Maybe everyone can stay on the road this morning.</p> </p>

<i>Maybe try merlyn's Learning Perl Objects, References and Modules. Or Learning Perl?</i>

<p>Now those are great books (not that Programming Perl isn't, but those are more well suited for starters and all).

</p><p>I recall having a friend of mine trying to learn Perl by reading Programming Perl... he eventually gave up and asked me for another book; I advised him to read Learning Perl first.

</p><p>My friend still knows little of Perl, but it's his fault, since he hasn't read the book yet.</p>

Those are all fine tomes, eh.  But if they're just not connecting for you, the following book may be worth a read - it's a fave of mine.<br> <br>Elements of Programming with Perl<br>Andrew Johnson<br>Manning Press<br>ISBN 1-884777-80-5<br>
