Sitting, waiting for my wife to bring lunch. I was supposed to go work out in the gym today with the guy in the next cube. But he came around and told me he was going to run outside which I am not in shape enough to do yet. So I got a bit miffed and decided that I would stay inside and do nothing. That'll show <b>him</b>.</p>
<p>
I have to teach another class tomorrow. I am calling this one Guerilla Regex, because I am not really sure about what I will be telling the class. Most of what is in the slides came straight from one book or another but sometimes it might as well be in a foreign language for all the understanding I have. The only thing I am sure of is that I know more than the people in the class and that will have to do. The only thing I can do is not lie and tell them when I don't know something.</p>

Anyone been to Yafro yet? If you are into nude women it is a good place to look. Supposedly all the pictures people post there are of themselves. Anyway it is worth checking out if you like that kind of thing. The Url is www.yafro.com. Oh and you have to register, but it is free.</p></p>
