The Karma Fairy sneaked up and whapped me with her wand again. And, as before, I have no idea why. Could it be the (ahem) quality of the writing? Spelling? Punctuation? Good Grammar? The position of the stars? Sweet Fanny Adams?</p>
<p>
I feel like a blindfold man in a darkened house at midnight, stumbling from place to place. Suddenly someone hands me a cookie. A paper cookie but a cookie. Better than nothing but what's it <i>for</i>? Did I do something or did I refrain from doing something?</p>
<p>
Most <i>Mysterious</i>.</p>

<h2>Karma...</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/jordan/">jordan</a> on 2004-02-11T01:50:48</h3>
Is pretty meaningless here, and nearly meaningless on Slashdot, where it (and the code that runs this site) originated.<br> <p>The idea is that when you've demonstrated enough good posting, that you aren't just some wicked troll or something, you'll get to post with a "Karma bonus" that'll give your posts an automatic +1 rating.  I've got the Karma bonus, so I could always post at 2, but I have it turned off and only apply it when I think I've definitely said something worthwhile.<br> </p><p>This can be important on Slashdot where you don't really want to read the postings at 0 or (shudder) -1.  You might not want to waste your time on 1s.  I've browsed Slashdot at 3 or even 4 so as to not waste time with the crap and me too comments.<br> </p><p>As I said, all this is pretty meaningless here, but this place, amoung other things, is pudge's playground for the Slashcode, so we have all the features of Slashdot, even one's that don't make much sense here.</p>

Ah, then the karma points are food pellets for lab rats.</p>
