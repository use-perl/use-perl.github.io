My asthma is rearing it's ugly head again. Consequently I am staying home away cold air and (hopefully) the falling barometer. No an especially bad attack but it always leaves me tired.</p>
<p>
Last Friday at work I spent a good bit of time entering alias in my Solaris system logon. I wanted convenient shortcuts for the perldoc commands. The format I used was:

    <pre>alias perlobj='/usr/perl5/5.6.1/bin/perldoc perlobj'</pre>

And the shortcuts all seemed to work. I entered
a shortcut for each perldoc. All nice and convenient. Monday when I tried them thay had all disappeared, vanished, gone. You may imagine my dismay. I don't know whether to try again or just type in the entire path each time I want to read a document.</p>
<p>
My wife's new boss might be in today. She will certainly give him the benefit of the doubt (she gives everyone that benefit) but it should be interesting to hear what she thinks about him or her.</p>
<p>
Oh, wow! I just noticed! I got another karma point! Whatever that means, whatever it is for. How many do I need before I get my secret decoder ring?</p></p>

<h2>persistency of aliases</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/cog/">cog</a> on 2004-02-10T15:07:40</h3>
<p>If I understand correctly, you simply typed </p><blockquote><div> <tt>alias perlobj='/usr/perl5/5.6.1/bin/perldoc perlobj'</tt> </div></blockquote>

<p>If this is what you did, then it's just normal that those definitions go away with your session.

</p><p>That's what files such as<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.bashrc are for (try adding your alias line to it; the file should be in your home directory and is run every time you open a shell; if the name of the file isn't<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.bashrc for Solaris, it's probably something like<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.profile).</p>

If you learn by making mistakes, I oughta be Einstein by now. That is exactly what I did. And, of course, when I enter 'alias' on the command line the computer shows me alias in<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.profile (or<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.login or whatever). The system shows all alias but not where they are located.</p>
<p>
Staggeringly obvious - when you see it.</p>
<p>
Thanks, <b>cog</b>!</p>
<p>
By the way, your English is amazing. I would never have guessed it was not your first language (my assumption since you were born in Portugal). The only thing that might possibly give you away is your grammar is better than that of the average American. I am awed.</p>

<h2>Karma</h2>
<h3><a href="/user/chaoticset/">chaoticset</a> on 2004-02-10T16:00:26</h3>
Karma points can be redeemed for prizes at the Karma Store.  Merely go to any Karma Store near you, and select from their wide varieties of cookware, foodstuffs, luggage, clothing, accessories, etc.
<p>
In the event that there <em>is</em> no Karma Store near you, merely drop those Karma points in an envelope, burn it, and wait for whatever you've wished for to arrive!</p>

Just what I do when I want something and <b>don't</b> have karma points.</p>
