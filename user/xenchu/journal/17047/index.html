I have written about a Perl class I was supposed to start taking today. Because of the weather the class was put off a day but not cancelled. Now I will have to drive to the site of the class through lousy conditions on (perhaps) icy roads. To top it all, my classmate and I can't leave on the aproximately 200 mile trip until 3 in the afternoon. To say I am not looking forward to the trip is to say...I am not looking forward to the trip.</p>

<p>
Time to get ready for the trip. I hope to write more about what happens when I get back.<p>
<p>
Good luck to <a href="http://use.perl.org/user/chaoticset">chaoticset</a> with his game matrix thingy.</p></p>

I had heard that in foreign countries some people had to drive an awfull long way to get to their jobs or their classes, but I had no idea it could be like that...<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-|<br> <br>I spent five years living right next to the university where I studied, taking me about 5 minutes on foot to get to my Perl classes... and most of the time I would get there late...<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-|<br> <br>200 mile? I mean, I do love Perl, but that's way too much... How long will those classes last?

<p>
It is a three-day class and this is the last day. I didn't even have to drive down as I expected to.</p>
The class is OK. I got very frustrated yesterday when I didn't take my Perl book to class and needed it badly. Other than that I have no complaints.
